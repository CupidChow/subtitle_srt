1
00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:02,759
So,

2
00:00:03,519 --> 00:00:05,129
if you don't get a heart transplant,

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,189
I hear you'll die in a few months.

4
00:00:08,999 --> 00:00:11,999
If they have to watch their own child die,

5
00:00:13,869 --> 00:00:15,439
it's best their pain is as brief as possible.

6
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:23,279
Dad.

7
00:00:33,519 --> 00:00:34,559
Father.

8
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:38,989
What...

9
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:40,959
What is...

10
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:44,429
What is all this? You two...

11
00:00:45,169 --> 00:00:46,829
What were you just talking about?

12
00:00:47,529 --> 00:00:48,639
Who's dying?

13
00:00:51,709 --> 00:00:52,709
Dad.

14
00:00:54,309 --> 00:00:56,009
What are you doing here?

15
00:00:56,339 --> 00:00:57,509
Explain...

16
00:00:58,109 --> 00:00:59,649
Tell me properly.

17
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:02,849
What did I just hear?

18
00:01:05,249 --> 00:01:06,719
I'm asking why you're at the office.

19
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:09,289
I brought you your lunch, you brat.

20
00:01:12,389 --> 00:01:17,129
What? Why would you bring me lunch? Why are you even here?

21
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:20,699
Just explain yourself, you punk!

22
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,509
How much did you hear?

23
00:01:33,749 --> 00:01:36,619
That if you don't get a heart transplant...

24
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:39,949
you'll die. That's what Seong Jae...

25
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:16,619
I feel like I've let my guard down too much.

26
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:19,429
So I'm trying to maintain a professional distance.

27
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:20,789
I'm sorry, Eun Oh.

28
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:22,159
It seems we...

29
00:02:22,899 --> 00:02:23,959
just missed each other.

30
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:26,099
I've already moved on.

31
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:27,669
From now on,

32
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:30,199
I'm going to keep things strictly professional.

33
00:02:53,859 --> 00:02:54,959
When...

34
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,099
and how did you find out?

35
00:02:59,999 --> 00:03:02,899
I didn't actually go to Tokyo on a business trip.

36
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:06,239
I was in the hospital for three days getting emergency treatment,

37
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:10,779
and on top of that, I had a full workup.

38
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:13,879
You weren't on a business trip?

39
00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:18,349
There are too many people on the transplant list,

40
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:21,659
so they say it's unlikely I'll get one in time.

41
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:25,389
So now...

42
00:03:27,029 --> 00:03:28,129
You get it now, right?

43
00:03:28,429 --> 00:03:29,429
What...

44
00:03:29,929 --> 00:03:32,869
Understand what?

45
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:34,869
Fine.

46
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:39,739
This acute myo-something, or whatever.

47
00:03:41,109 --> 00:03:44,279
How does that make any sense? A healthy guy like you?

48
00:03:45,249 --> 00:03:49,879
You have lots of sports gear. How can you have a heart problem?

49
00:03:52,289 --> 00:03:55,259
A few months ago, I went to the ER for severe body aches.

50
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:00,859
And the viral myocarditis had already started back then,

51
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:05,299
but they missed it. It kept progressing until...

52
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:07,499
it suddenly got worse.

53
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:10,539
I already told you all this.

54
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:12,669
Do I have to repeat myself?

55
00:04:13,369 --> 00:04:17,139
- Did you get a second opinion? - Dad.

56
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:20,549
The one thing I need you to do for me now...

57
00:04:21,849 --> 00:04:24,549
is make sure Mom, Ji Wan, and Su Bin don't find out.

58
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:28,419
I want to live as if nothing is wrong.

59
00:04:30,719 --> 00:04:31,989
For as long as I have left.

60
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:35,099
Do you hear yourself, kid?

61
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:39,569
The eldest son's sick. We must unite and find a solution, you punk.

62
00:04:43,099 --> 00:04:44,099
Seong Jae.

63
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:47,769
Can you take my father home for me?

64
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,909
I have some things I need to finish up here today.

65
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:54,549
Are you out of your mind? In your condition?

66
00:04:54,609 --> 00:04:57,519
Forget about work and business! Go home right now.

67
00:04:57,579 --> 00:04:59,389
This is exactly why I wanted to keep it a secret.

68
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:04,689
If I go home with you right now,

69
00:05:06,089 --> 00:05:07,759
what's going to change?

70
00:05:08,299 --> 00:05:09,699
What are you going to do with me there?

71
00:05:12,469 --> 00:05:13,469
What?

72
00:05:13,799 --> 00:05:17,539
You need to rest. That's the first thing. Rest.

73
00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:19,539
But...

74
00:05:20,409 --> 00:05:22,939
why are you giving up already?

75
00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:26,609
It could be a misdiagnosis. Another hospital might disagree.

76
00:05:26,679 --> 00:05:29,249
- Let's try another hospital, okay? - Dad.

77
00:05:32,349 --> 00:05:34,389
I have a follow-up appointment on Monday,

78
00:05:35,589 --> 00:05:37,289
so you can come with me and see for yourself.

79
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,689
There's no need to go to another hospital.

80
00:05:57,539 --> 00:05:58,549
Father.

81
00:05:59,149 --> 00:06:00,409
Please, come with me.

82
00:06:01,849 --> 00:06:03,919
How can I leave Ji Hyuk here?

83
00:06:04,349 --> 00:06:06,419
Are you crazy? Are you out of your mind?

84
00:06:09,559 --> 00:06:10,589
Father.

85
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:14,129
Who do you think this is hardest on right now?

86
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,319
So that's what this was all about, Ji Hyuk.

87
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:43,889
I'm so sorry.

88
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:00,369
So, what brings you all the way to the office?

89
00:07:02,179 --> 00:07:04,279
I came because you've decided to see this through to the end.

90
00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:07,009
I want a divorce.

91
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:10,449
A divorce? Why would I give you a divorce?

92
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,889
You're refusing to get a divorce?

93
00:07:14,749 --> 00:07:17,059
Don't you remember what my family...

94
00:07:17,059 --> 00:07:18,559
and everyone in the business world...

95
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:20,159
had to say when I remarried you?

96
00:07:21,529 --> 00:07:25,569
An orphan who only finished high school. A widowed waitress.

97
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:27,629
Of course, I didn't care about any of that.

98
00:07:28,939 --> 00:07:32,909
A gold digger who seduced Chairman Park with just her looks.

99
00:07:33,769 --> 00:07:35,339
I heard every terrible thing they said.

100
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:37,909
But none of it mattered to me.

101
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:43,149
So why would I turn around now and admit that they were all right?

102
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:46,449
It would prove I've been deceived for 26 long years.

103
00:07:48,089 --> 00:07:49,659
Get another divorce because of you?

104
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:53,159
I will not have another divorce in my life.

105
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:56,999
If you have no intention of divorcing me,

106
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,199
then why did you push me to this point?

107
00:08:00,369 --> 00:08:01,429
Take a guess.

108
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:07,039
Reading and manipulating people... Isn't that your specialty?

109
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:11,009
I never, ever forgive anyone who deceives me.

110
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:13,509
And yet, he says he won't get a divorce.

111
00:08:15,549 --> 00:08:16,879
What could I possibly want?

112
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:19,689
You snake.

113
00:08:20,289 --> 00:08:23,019
What is it? What is he thinking?

114
00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:27,789
I know you, Park Jin Seok.

115
00:08:28,659 --> 00:08:30,699
You could never forgive me.

116
00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:32,529
Bingo.

117
00:08:34,999 --> 00:08:37,669
So even groveling and begging won't work.

118
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:41,839
If you even knew that I had a secret safe,

119
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:45,549
you weren't trusting me 100 percent, were you?

120
00:08:46,479 --> 00:08:47,809
When exactly did you find out?

121
00:08:48,479 --> 00:08:49,819
I deserve to know that much.

122
00:08:51,749 --> 00:08:54,149
I didn't know. I never even dreamed of it.

123
00:08:54,689 --> 00:08:57,659
Not until I realized you were lying to me.

124
00:08:58,359 --> 00:08:59,759
But then I found out.

125
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:02,959
That Woo Jin took a leave of absence to get a liver transplant.

126
00:09:04,429 --> 00:09:07,099
And don't get the wrong idea. Seong Jae didn't tell me.

127
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,739
It wasn't Seong Jae who told you?

128
00:09:11,939 --> 00:09:14,769
"Ko Seong Hui has been deceiving me like this?"

129
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:17,079
Someone who could deceive me. Was that who she was?

130
00:09:18,579 --> 00:09:20,549
So, I started thinking.

131
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:22,519
What are you up to?

132
00:09:24,819 --> 00:09:27,689
I was thinking of wearing the watch we bought in Rome.

133
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:29,719
- I have my book club today. - Right.

134
00:09:32,689 --> 00:09:35,459
One stack each. You really never change.

135
00:09:36,129 --> 00:09:38,669
Rather modest for a chairman's wife, don't you think?

136
00:09:39,129 --> 00:09:41,699
Excuse me? I have buildings, apartments,

137
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:45,569
jewelry, and cash. I've got it all in here.

138
00:09:46,309 --> 00:09:49,409
You always opened the safe right in front of me,

139
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:52,249
as if to say, "I'm not greedy. All of my assets..."

140
00:09:52,349 --> 00:09:56,019
"are where my husband can see. I even gave you the password."

141
00:09:57,849 --> 00:10:00,349
A woman who cared that much about money...

142
00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:04,459
wouldn't possibly be satisfied with something so simple.

143
00:10:05,729 --> 00:10:08,699
That must be a decoy safe, meant to fool me.

144
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:11,129
Of course. In that case,

145
00:10:11,729 --> 00:10:14,829
where would she have hidden her real fortune?

146
00:10:16,869 --> 00:10:17,999
Right.

147
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:22,539
After my father passed away, you redecorated the entire house.

148
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:24,739
So it was all too obvious.

149
00:10:33,389 --> 00:10:35,619
A place I would never suspect.

150
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:37,619
Somewhere I'd never touch.

151
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:39,729
And there it was, a remote, right out in the open.

152
00:11:18,729 --> 00:11:21,529
(Ji Eun Oh Files)

153
00:11:27,109 --> 00:11:28,209
So that's how you found out.

154
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:31,949
You're really something else.

155
00:11:33,349 --> 00:11:37,449
When I trusted you, I never had a single doubt.

156
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:40,319
But once I knew you were deceiving me...

157
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:46,559
I can be just as clever as you. No, even cleverer.

158
00:11:49,629 --> 00:11:52,729
If you're not going to divorce me, why did you clean out my safe?

159
00:11:53,429 --> 00:11:56,869
I used the properties you gave me as gifts...

160
00:11:56,939 --> 00:11:59,569
to build my own wealth. Why would you take that from me?

161
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:03,379
And what proof do you have that I took it?

162
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:07,349
You took out mortgages on them in your name.

163
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:12,019
- Park Jin Seok. In your name. - Is that so? How odd.

164
00:12:12,849 --> 00:12:13,849
You're insane.

165
00:12:20,029 --> 00:12:22,899
You really are the man I chose.

166
00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:27,799
But why are you so angry without even hearing me out?

167
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:31,869
The truth is, you can't see what's truly in someone's heart.

168
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:36,909
If you felt my feelings were real, then they were.

169
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:41,149
And if you were happy, then it was me who made you happy.

170
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:44,219
So does it matter if my feelings were real or not?

171
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:46,919
Gosh, I hate all that nonsense.

172
00:12:47,689 --> 00:12:51,319
Look, even if I was only nice to you for your money,

173
00:12:51,389 --> 00:12:54,759
- it's also a sincere kind of love. - What?

174
00:12:56,829 --> 00:12:58,099
But you...

175
00:12:59,329 --> 00:13:01,729
don't seem like you could accept my kind of love.

176
00:13:03,069 --> 00:13:06,209
Then I guess we've expired, haven't we?

177
00:13:07,769 --> 00:13:10,809
We can't be complete strangers because of Yeong Ra.

178
00:13:11,439 --> 00:13:12,449
Right?

179
00:13:12,909 --> 00:13:16,649
And you can't leave me, Yeong Ra's mother, destitute.

180
00:13:16,719 --> 00:13:18,449
Not that you could, anyway.

181
00:13:19,289 --> 00:13:22,389
Let's handle this divorce with some class.

182
00:13:23,089 --> 00:13:27,029
Let me live in a style befitting Yeong Ra's mom and your ex-wife.

183
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,699
I already told you, we're not getting a divorce.

184
00:13:31,929 --> 00:13:34,429
I'm sure you don't want to. For now.

185
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:36,539
But our relationship is already broken.

186
00:13:38,099 --> 00:13:39,109
Look,

187
00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:42,239
I won't ask for any of your assets in the settlement.

188
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:44,309
Just give me back what's mine.

189
00:13:44,809 --> 00:13:47,779
If this goes to a divorce lawsuit with those mortgages,

190
00:13:47,849 --> 00:13:50,219
you'll be completely humiliated and forced to divorce me anyway.

191
00:13:50,979 --> 00:13:52,719
And those mortgages will be nullified.

192
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:57,059
What is this nonsense you keep spouting?

193
00:13:57,559 --> 00:13:59,089
How are you going to divorce me?

194
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:01,559
On what grounds? Have I done anything wrong?

195
00:14:02,599 --> 00:14:05,099
The at-fault party can't file for divorce.

196
00:14:06,699 --> 00:14:08,399
And how am I the one at fault?

197
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:10,299
What?

198
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,809
That I said my daughter was dead when she was still alive?

199
00:14:13,109 --> 00:14:14,839
That was before we were married.

200
00:14:15,739 --> 00:14:18,579
Was it because I didn't tell you Woo Jin needed a liver transplant?

201
00:14:19,009 --> 00:14:20,709
Or that I looked for my daughter for the transplant?

202
00:14:21,449 --> 00:14:24,619
That was my motherly love for the son I had actually raised.

203
00:14:25,219 --> 00:14:27,819
How did any of that hurt you?

204
00:14:28,349 --> 00:14:32,459
- Did I ask for a liver, or money? - Shut that trap!

205
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:36,499
Do you still see me as the same fool who used to trust you?

206
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:39,529
How dare you spout such utter nonsense?

207
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,899
You loved Woo Jin so much?

208
00:14:42,669 --> 00:14:44,099
That love didn't extend to your daughter?

209
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:47,909
Is that why you lied that she died of pneumonia when she was one,

210
00:14:48,209 --> 00:14:51,139
and even filed a death certificate for a child who was still alive?

211
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:53,809
All so you could marry me.

212
00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:56,819
You're the one who did something so vile.

213
00:14:58,119 --> 00:15:00,019
You've been lying to me from the very beginning.

214
00:15:00,849 --> 00:15:02,519
And lying about Woo Jin's liver transplant?

215
00:15:03,259 --> 00:15:05,259
That was so you could steal the heir position from Seong Jae.

216
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:06,889
He had to be healthy for that.

217
00:15:08,359 --> 00:15:11,629
Yeong Ra's marriage was just a way for you to satisfy your own vanity.

218
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,799
You spent your whole life subtly undermining Seong Jae.

219
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:18,599
You think I'd divorce the likes of you...

220
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:20,709
and go through another divorce?

221
00:15:22,239 --> 00:15:24,779
You will die as my wife.

222
00:15:26,349 --> 00:15:30,419
Then what are you saying? What do you want from me?

223
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:32,949
What? You just said you wouldn't divorce me.

224
00:15:33,219 --> 00:15:37,659
What? You've hidden all my money. So, should I just move back in?

225
00:15:37,789 --> 00:15:40,329
How dare someone like you set foot in my house!

226
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:41,689
Then what am I supposed to do?

227
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:45,129
You won't divorce me, won't pay me, and you won't let me come home.

228
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,729
So what am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to live?

229
00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:51,569
Go back to where you came from.

230
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:54,469
Where I came from?

231
00:15:56,939 --> 00:16:00,909
I'm putting you right back where you were before you met me.

232
00:16:02,479 --> 00:16:03,579
What did you just say?

233
00:16:04,349 --> 00:16:08,349
Go back to the life you had without me, as Ko Seong Hui.

234
00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:10,059
In the gutter.

235
00:16:11,489 --> 00:16:13,229
Are you out of your mind?

236
00:16:13,689 --> 00:16:18,199
That's your punishment for deceiving me for 26 years.

237
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:23,099
I want you out of this house by the time I get home.

238
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:26,709
Didn't I tell you I don't want to see your face when I get back?

239
00:16:28,239 --> 00:16:31,279
Honey, please. Why are you doing this? Why?

240
00:16:31,579 --> 00:16:33,509
Why are you doing this? Let go of me!

241
00:16:37,179 --> 00:16:38,719
Dad told me to give this to you, Mom.

242
00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:42,119
I left 2,000 dollars in that account for you.

243
00:16:42,189 --> 00:16:46,259
That'll last you what, three days in a hotel before it's gone.

244
00:16:48,189 --> 00:16:50,029
Park Jin Seok, you crazy jerk.

245
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,729
You expect me to leave with nothing and fend for myself?

246
00:16:54,229 --> 00:16:55,939
Why should I?

247
00:16:56,569 --> 00:16:58,339
After everything I've done for you?

248
00:16:58,909 --> 00:17:01,569
I ironed your underwear, I looked after your health,

249
00:17:01,739 --> 00:17:03,779
I cooked for you, and met your needs.

250
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:05,809
I even went to college to keep up.

251
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:09,519
And you'd kick me out with nothing? You think I'll let you?

252
00:17:13,149 --> 00:17:14,989
Or would you rather I have you committed?

253
00:17:15,989 --> 00:17:16,989
What?

254
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:22,499
If the wife of Shoe Joy's chairman screams her head off in his office,

255
00:17:22,999 --> 00:17:24,999
people might just think she has a few screws loose.

256
00:17:26,499 --> 00:17:27,969
You don't have any other family.

257
00:17:28,729 --> 00:17:29,939
Your legal guardian...

258
00:17:31,069 --> 00:17:32,239
is me, and me alone.

259
00:17:35,239 --> 00:17:36,679
Now, take out your phone.

260
00:17:44,579 --> 00:17:46,449
(Standard)

261
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:50,859
Listen carefully.

262
00:17:52,289 --> 00:17:55,289
If one word of this gets out, you're dead.

263
00:17:56,459 --> 00:17:58,899
If I hear so much as a peep from you,

264
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,669
you'll disappear without a trace.

265
00:18:03,569 --> 00:18:06,739
Don't go running to law firms and letting things slip.

266
00:18:07,909 --> 00:18:10,839
Honey, I'm Yeong Ra's mother.

267
00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:15,179
And what about you? Did you ever really love me?

268
00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:20,049
If you had, you'd have given Woo Jin your name.

269
00:18:20,289 --> 00:18:23,959
You just let him live as Han Woo Jin in the Park household, on eggshells.

270
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,089
Don't make excuses.

271
00:18:25,929 --> 00:18:28,189
I couldn't change his last name because of my parents, but...

272
00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:30,529
I raised him as my own son.

273
00:18:31,099 --> 00:18:32,399
And Woo Jin knows that.

274
00:18:33,399 --> 00:18:37,099
My pockets are empty. Where will I sleep and eat?

275
00:18:38,399 --> 00:18:39,969
Find a job that offers room and board.

276
00:18:41,209 --> 00:18:42,639
You're a good cook,

277
00:18:43,009 --> 00:18:44,179
so I'm sure you'll have plenty of options.

278
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,679
Get out.

279
00:18:52,719 --> 00:18:54,949
I guess I never really knew you.

280
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:57,859
But...

281
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:01,489
you don't know everything about me, either.

282
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:30,689
Yeong Ra, it's me, Mom. Yeong Ra, open the door.

283
00:19:39,269 --> 00:19:40,269
Mom?

284
00:19:41,269 --> 00:19:43,039
Unbelievable.

285
00:19:46,209 --> 00:19:48,979
How could you want to slum it in a place like this?

286
00:19:49,639 --> 00:19:51,539
- My gosh. - What are you doing here?

287
00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:56,449
"Mom, how have you been?"

288
00:19:58,479 --> 00:20:00,149
Mom, how have you been?

289
00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:04,089
After everything I did to raise you,

290
00:20:04,719 --> 00:20:08,129
I get kicked out, and you couldn't even call me once?

291
00:20:09,399 --> 00:20:11,959
I figured you'd call if you needed anything.

292
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:13,669
Is that so?

293
00:20:15,739 --> 00:20:16,739
Darn.

294
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,039
Now,

295
00:20:22,439 --> 00:20:24,239
I'm here because I really need my daughter.

296
00:20:25,379 --> 00:20:26,379
My gosh.

297
00:20:27,109 --> 00:20:30,719
- What happened with Dad? - I need to sue for my money.

298
00:20:31,449 --> 00:20:32,619
Get me 200,000 dollars.

299
00:20:33,949 --> 00:20:34,949
Did you say 200,000 dollars?

300
00:20:35,789 --> 00:20:39,129
Your father went behind my back and used my official seal...

301
00:20:39,429 --> 00:20:43,359
and mortgaged all of my properties so I can't sell them.

302
00:20:43,999 --> 00:20:45,399
I have to sue him to get them back.

303
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:48,329
How can you even think of suing him?

304
00:20:48,669 --> 00:20:51,969
- You should be begging Dad. - Don't butt in. You know nothing.

305
00:20:53,809 --> 00:20:55,469
I'll tell you everything later.

306
00:20:56,509 --> 00:20:57,779
I don't have 200,000 dollars.

307
00:20:58,779 --> 00:21:01,579
You have those stocks your grandfather left you.

308
00:21:03,819 --> 00:21:05,649
Sell them as soon as the market opens on Monday.

309
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:09,459
Of all the rotten luck, it's the weekend.

310
00:21:11,189 --> 00:21:12,189
Got it?

311
00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:15,129
I'll think about it.

312
00:21:15,429 --> 00:21:17,729
What's there to think about?

313
00:21:18,259 --> 00:21:21,329
You saw me get kicked out with just the clothes on my back.

314
00:21:23,499 --> 00:21:24,869
And give me one of your credit cards.

315
00:21:27,509 --> 00:21:29,239
Don't you have anything to say to me?

316
00:21:30,779 --> 00:21:32,379
You're supposed to say you're sorry.

317
00:21:33,049 --> 00:21:36,379
If I can't land on my feet, you'll be a laughingstock too.

318
00:21:38,449 --> 00:21:40,549
So you'd better convince your father.

319
00:21:41,149 --> 00:21:44,359
Tell him to stop treating me poorly and give me back my property.

320
00:21:45,089 --> 00:21:47,759
And if he won't, tell him I'll divorce him. Got it?

321
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,399
Remember, you are my daughter.

322
00:21:53,999 --> 00:21:55,069
Just a second.

323
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:58,299
Unbelievable.

324
00:22:02,509 --> 00:22:03,809
I can't give you the card.

325
00:22:04,179 --> 00:22:05,209
It's in Dad's name.

326
00:22:06,009 --> 00:22:10,079
You knew I was coming and got out some cash for me.

327
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:12,689
How much?

328
00:22:13,149 --> 00:22:14,149
Five hundred dollars.

329
00:22:14,719 --> 00:22:18,289
What? 500? Not 10,000...

330
00:22:18,689 --> 00:22:21,159
Not even 5,000, but 500?

331
00:22:23,229 --> 00:22:24,529
Transfer 10,000 dollars to me right now.

332
00:22:26,269 --> 00:22:28,569
My OTP authenticator and everything are at home.

333
00:22:31,939 --> 00:22:33,739
Then go home and transfer the 10,000,

334
00:22:34,409 --> 00:22:36,639
and send the 200,000 as soon as the stocks sell.

335
00:22:37,209 --> 00:22:38,839
I'll text you my debit card account details.

336
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:42,679
Okay.

337
00:22:54,789 --> 00:22:55,829
Park Yeong Ra.

338
00:22:58,459 --> 00:22:59,469
Ji Wan.

339
00:23:00,029 --> 00:23:01,799
What are you doing out here alone in the cold?

340
00:23:07,069 --> 00:23:08,069
Are you crying?

341
00:23:09,709 --> 00:23:10,809
Hey, what's going on? What's wrong?

342
00:23:11,309 --> 00:23:12,409
Did something happen?

343
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:15,549
- It's nothing. - Nothing? You're crying.

344
00:23:16,219 --> 00:23:17,619
I'm asking you, what's wrong?

345
00:23:18,479 --> 00:23:20,719
You left like you wanted nothing to do with me.

346
00:23:22,289 --> 00:23:23,619
I had something to deal with.

347
00:23:24,619 --> 00:23:27,929
Why are you suddenly showing up and prying into my business?

348
00:23:29,229 --> 00:23:30,229
Your business?

349
00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:33,629
You said we were battle buddies,

350
00:23:34,969 --> 00:23:37,439
but you left like you didn't want me to ever contact you again.

351
00:23:38,069 --> 00:23:39,669
Same with the day you came for the recommendation letter.

352
00:23:41,709 --> 00:23:42,739
That was...

353
00:23:44,509 --> 00:23:47,379
That was honestly to help you stand on your own two feet.

354
00:23:48,649 --> 00:23:50,449
So why are you here today?

355
00:23:53,819 --> 00:23:55,089
I'm here about that thing.

356
00:23:55,959 --> 00:23:58,319
The collaboration you proposed.

357
00:23:59,889 --> 00:24:02,529
You're going to be my story writer?

358
00:24:02,659 --> 00:24:05,059
No, I'm saying I'm doing it.

359
00:24:05,529 --> 00:24:09,469
I'm not doing it for you. I'm doing it because I want to.

360
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:13,269
I can get a security job anytime, but being a webtoon story writer...

361
00:24:13,609 --> 00:24:15,369
- Co-writer. - Right.

362
00:24:15,869 --> 00:24:19,009
Being a co-writer isn't a chance that comes around all the time.

363
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:21,149
So this "Urban Rapunzel..."

364
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:23,579
I really want to give it a shot.

365
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:26,189
If you haven't changed your mind, that is.

366
00:24:26,289 --> 00:24:28,689
Me? Of course not!

367
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:30,959
Then from now on,

368
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,489
we're not Ms. Yeong Ra and her bodyguard anymore.

369
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,039
Father.

370
00:24:48,469 --> 00:24:50,309
- Have some water. - What?

371
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:03,689
Su Bin might be home, so why don't you go to your room?

372
00:25:04,289 --> 00:25:06,729
Su Bin's out. She's out.

373
00:25:07,689 --> 00:25:08,689
Seong Jae.

374
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:12,029
Our Ji Hyuk... What are we going to do about him?

375
00:25:15,529 --> 00:25:16,539
Father.

376
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:18,969
First of all,

377
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:23,579
I hope you'll try to understand how Ji Hyuk feels first.

378
00:25:24,639 --> 00:25:28,079
What? Are you saying I shouldn't tell his mom?

379
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:31,379
You're taking this hard as it is,

380
00:25:31,749 --> 00:25:34,389
can you imagine how his mom will react if she finds out?

381
00:25:36,219 --> 00:25:37,659
Ji Hyuk must always feel...

382
00:25:38,419 --> 00:25:40,859
like his life is just fading away.

383
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,299
If he has to watch the two of you in shock and pain on top of that,

384
00:25:45,929 --> 00:25:47,399
can you imagine how hard that'd be for him?

385
00:25:47,969 --> 00:25:51,339
No way. This can't be it. We have to look into it again.

386
00:25:51,399 --> 00:25:53,769
If we look, we will find another way.

387
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,009
How can they suddenly say...

388
00:25:56,009 --> 00:25:58,039
that only a heart transplant can save him?

389
00:25:58,209 --> 00:26:00,109
Medical care in this country is top-notch!

390
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:02,679
No matter what you do, Father,

391
00:26:03,819 --> 00:26:06,449
please just let Ji Hyuk do what he wants.

392
00:26:08,219 --> 00:26:09,219
What?

393
00:26:09,789 --> 00:26:12,089
I also went to convince Ji Hyuk today.

394
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:14,189
I told him to tell the family everything.

395
00:26:16,059 --> 00:26:17,699
But after seeing how you're reacting,

396
00:26:19,399 --> 00:26:21,099
I think Ji Hyuk was right.

397
00:26:31,379 --> 00:26:33,309
(Thirty Houses)

398
00:26:41,149 --> 00:26:42,189
The lunchbox...

399
00:27:13,789 --> 00:27:14,789
Dad.

400
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:21,559
It's like you knew when you made this.

401
00:27:23,859 --> 00:27:24,999
It's delicious.

402
00:27:28,869 --> 00:27:31,239
And not too salty.

403
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:38,409
I'm sorry, Dad.

404
00:28:25,689 --> 00:28:26,989
Is he crying?

405
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,629
Why would he be crying right after leaving our house?

406
00:28:37,769 --> 00:28:40,739
Be home by seven. We need to talk.

407
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:50,519
What?

408
00:28:52,249 --> 00:28:53,549
What's going on?

409
00:28:54,689 --> 00:28:56,259
Why was he at our house?

410
00:29:14,569 --> 00:29:15,569
Dad.

411
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:24,549
Dad, why is the door locked? Are you in your room?

412
00:29:25,449 --> 00:29:28,449
I was just taking a little nap.

413
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:32,059
You've been in your room this whole time?

414
00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:36,659
I'm tired, so I'm going to get a little more sleep.

415
00:29:39,329 --> 00:29:40,499
Okay.

416
00:29:43,539 --> 00:29:44,969
Dad's voice...

417
00:29:50,979 --> 00:29:52,309
This is strange.

418
00:29:52,809 --> 00:29:55,549
Seong Jae just left our house.

419
00:29:56,349 --> 00:29:59,319
Dad was the only one home, and he says he was napping?

420
00:30:00,619 --> 00:30:01,749
Something's off.

421
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:05,419
Dad's voice is hoarse, too. Like he's been crying.

422
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:09,489
Did he come to ask for our blessing again?

423
00:30:10,729 --> 00:30:12,559
And then Dad must have chewed him out.

424
00:30:14,369 --> 00:30:18,069
But wait, Dad said he was napping. Why is he pretending not to see him?

425
00:30:21,609 --> 00:30:23,439
So he did come to ask for Dad's blessing.

426
00:30:24,139 --> 00:30:27,449
Seong Jae must've gotten chewed out, and Dad must be really upset too.

427
00:30:28,879 --> 00:30:31,419
Why didn't Seong Jae say a word to me?

428
00:30:34,489 --> 00:30:36,589
(Seong Jae)

429
00:30:38,689 --> 00:30:39,689
No.

430
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:42,729
If he asked for their blessing, he would've told me.

431
00:30:44,829 --> 00:30:45,929
So what's going on?

432
00:30:48,869 --> 00:30:53,769
Since you both knew before me, I'll just be frank.

433
00:30:56,379 --> 00:30:58,279
As you both know,

434
00:30:58,579 --> 00:31:00,909
I truly loved and trusted your mother.

435
00:31:02,309 --> 00:31:04,749
That she was pure, without any ulterior motives,

436
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:08,149
and a person full of love.

437
00:31:08,749 --> 00:31:09,759
That's what I believed.

438
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:14,129
And you know how much I hate being deceived,

439
00:31:14,389 --> 00:31:18,199
and how much I despise liars. You both know that.

440
00:31:22,129 --> 00:31:24,399
I have decided not to forgive that woman.

441
00:31:29,169 --> 00:31:30,239
Does that mean...

442
00:31:30,939 --> 00:31:32,379
you're getting a divorce?

443
00:31:32,939 --> 00:31:34,179
Not really.

444
00:31:34,879 --> 00:31:36,679
But we're not going to live together, either.

445
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:40,789
After deceiving and lying to me for 26 years,

446
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:42,989
she has to pay the price.

447
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:47,159
Then what on earth are you planning to do?

448
00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:51,929
She'll have to survive out there on her own.

449
00:31:58,339 --> 00:32:00,469
To the both of you, I am so,

450
00:32:01,269 --> 00:32:02,469
so sorry.

451
00:32:04,909 --> 00:32:05,909
Seong Jae.

452
00:32:07,549 --> 00:32:10,019
I'm sorry for being so blind.

453
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:13,919
Yeong Ra.

454
00:32:15,189 --> 00:32:18,259
I thought your mother raised you with only love and care,

455
00:32:19,789 --> 00:32:22,029
and I'm sorry for neglecting you.

456
00:32:24,529 --> 00:32:27,029
Dad, are you okay?

457
00:32:28,299 --> 00:32:31,839
Don't worry. Your dad's a grown-up. I'm fine.

458
00:32:45,879 --> 00:32:46,919

(Terra Law Firm, Neorium Law Firm)

460
00:32:48,989 --> 00:32:52,159
Don't go running to law firms and letting things slip.

461
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:54,489
Or would you rather I have you committed?

462
00:32:57,199 --> 00:32:59,159
I don't need a major law firm.

463
00:32:59,729 --> 00:33:03,739
If I sue over the secret mortgage, it's an open-and-shut case.

464
00:33:04,299 --> 00:33:06,239
You'd be facing criminal charges, too.

465
00:33:08,139 --> 00:33:09,439
Have me committed?

466
00:33:10,579 --> 00:33:15,079
You think you can threaten me, and I'll just go work in a kitchen?

469
00:33:33,399 --> 00:33:34,399
(Why is it so dangerous?)

00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:51,249
(May they rest in peace.)

474
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:52,319
(That happens to so many people.)

475
00:33:52,379 --> 00:33:53,719
(The list is too long. You must prepare for the worst.)

476
00:34:01,089 --> 00:34:03,299
Where have you been? What took you so long?

477
00:34:04,499 --> 00:34:05,799
Dad, you're home.

478
00:34:05,859 --> 00:34:10,299
- I had... I had to meet someone. - Who?

479
00:34:10,499 --> 00:34:11,499
Where's Ji Hyuk?

480
00:34:12,099 --> 00:34:16,239
- In his room. Should I get him? - No, just let him be.

481
00:34:16,979 --> 00:34:19,579
I'm not feeling well either. I think I'm getting sick.

482
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:20,809
I should go lie down.

483
00:34:21,849 --> 00:34:23,149
Did you take anything for it?

484
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:28,649
Is Dad sick or something?

485
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:31,389
Does Dad have cancer?

486
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:44,969
I can't get one full day...

487
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,809
of peace and quiet.

488
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:51,739
Why are you lying to me?

489
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:54,779
What if I told you...

490
00:34:56,509 --> 00:34:59,619
that I like you? I...

491
00:35:01,049 --> 00:35:03,219
The misunderstandings I had about you,

492
00:35:04,759 --> 00:35:06,189
they're all cleared up now.

493
00:35:07,229 --> 00:35:08,929
Eun Oh says the misunderstanding's been cleared up.

494
00:35:10,429 --> 00:35:11,499
And so,

495
00:35:12,759 --> 00:35:15,229
I've forgiven you for everything.

496
00:35:16,269 --> 00:35:17,599
And she's forgiven me.

497
00:35:18,339 --> 00:35:20,769
And what if I mean it when I say...

498
00:35:21,669 --> 00:35:23,579
I like you again?

499
00:35:24,309 --> 00:35:25,539
Eun Oh...

500
00:35:26,779 --> 00:35:28,609
She has feelings for me again.

501
00:35:29,579 --> 00:35:30,779
It seems we...

502
00:35:31,319 --> 00:35:32,379
just missed each other.

503
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:36,149
I've already moved on.

504
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:40,689
Moved on? Who am I kidding?

505
00:36:14,229 --> 00:36:15,889
Hey, Mom. You're home.

506
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:19,359
I didn't hear you come in.

507
00:36:20,699 --> 00:36:21,699
Eun Oh.

508
00:36:22,069 --> 00:36:24,639
Why are the tofu pockets still here, untouched?

509
00:36:24,899 --> 00:36:26,069
Oh, that.

510
00:36:26,499 --> 00:36:29,269
I was at the office, but felt under the weather, so I came home.

511
00:36:29,809 --> 00:36:31,279
So you haven't eaten anything all day?

512
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:33,039
I guess not.

513
00:36:34,209 --> 00:36:35,249
By any chance,

514
00:36:35,809 --> 00:36:38,019
did something happen with Ji Hyuk?

515
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:39,779
No.

516
00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:42,519
Ji Hyuk didn't come in to work today.

517
00:36:43,419 --> 00:36:44,489
I'm sorry, Mom.

518
00:36:45,059 --> 00:36:47,459
I should've put the lunchbox in the fridge.

519
00:36:47,889 --> 00:36:49,429
You should eat something, then.

520
00:36:49,589 --> 00:36:54,099
It's okay. I had snacks at work, so I'm just going to get some rest.

521
00:36:54,369 --> 00:36:56,199
Okay, sure. Gang Oh, let's give her some space.

522
00:36:56,199 --> 00:36:58,039
You get some rest.

523
00:36:58,669 --> 00:36:59,669
Let's go.

524
00:37:15,989 --> 00:37:16,989
No...

525
00:37:19,159 --> 00:37:20,289
Something's...

526
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:22,159
not right.

527
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:24,699
No, I guess it means I like you.

528
00:37:25,099 --> 00:37:27,999
I like you so much, I can't stand it. I...

529
00:37:29,029 --> 00:37:30,369
I have to win you back.

530
00:37:30,939 --> 00:37:33,939
Eun Oh. I swear, for the rest of my life,

531
00:37:34,139 --> 00:37:35,569
you're the only one for me.

532
00:37:36,109 --> 00:37:40,209
How can I earn your forgiveness? That's my biggest worry.

533
00:37:40,409 --> 00:37:43,719
Besides your mom, there's no one who worries about you more than me.

534
00:37:43,919 --> 00:37:45,119
It seems we...

535
00:37:45,649 --> 00:37:48,519
just missed each other. I've already moved on.

536
00:37:49,989 --> 00:37:51,419
Ji Hyuk...

537
00:37:53,629 --> 00:37:55,159
is lying.

538
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:11,679
Since when did you start snoring?

539
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:15,679
Of course you're exhausted.

540
00:38:37,069 --> 00:38:40,239
You finally have a Sunday off for the first time in forever.

541
00:38:40,409 --> 00:38:42,269
And of all days, it had to be when I have to work?

542
00:38:42,739 --> 00:38:44,339
I'll take next Sunday off, too.

543
00:38:44,879 --> 00:38:46,609
- Really? - Yes.

544
00:38:46,679 --> 00:38:48,209
Go on, hurry to work.

545
00:38:48,749 --> 00:38:51,679
Who knew working on a weekend would be this bad?

546
00:38:52,649 --> 00:38:54,049
I'm off.

547
00:38:54,049 --> 00:38:55,449
- Have a good day. - Have a good day.

548
00:38:59,459 --> 00:39:00,789
I'm heading up, too.

549
00:39:18,139 --> 00:39:19,709
Dad is definitely acting weird.

550
00:39:25,379 --> 00:39:27,619
Ji Hyuk still isn't at the office?

551
00:39:30,889 --> 00:39:33,989
He's not one to take a Sunday off like this.

552
00:39:34,689 --> 00:39:36,489
While I was on my business trip,

553
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:39,429
I did some thinking about my position as CEO.

554
00:39:40,099 --> 00:39:42,269
He said he wanted to focus on the company.

555
00:39:42,869 --> 00:39:44,899
So why isn't he here on a Sunday, when he always comes in?

556
00:39:57,019 --> 00:40:01,619
Su Bin, tell Ji Wan to come on up. Let's order in and have lunch.

557
00:40:03,019 --> 00:40:04,019
Dad.

558
00:40:05,189 --> 00:40:06,189
Yes, what is it?

559
00:40:07,089 --> 00:40:10,089
What should we order for lunch? How about some bossam?

560
00:40:11,729 --> 00:40:13,969
Bossam sounds good.

561
00:40:14,429 --> 00:40:16,829
Bro, what's gotten into you? Taking Sunday off?

562
00:40:17,539 --> 00:40:18,839
Su Bin, order the bossam.

563
00:40:19,339 --> 00:40:20,509
Let's get bossam.

564
00:40:20,809 --> 00:40:22,539
- Sounds delicious. - Awesome!

565
00:40:26,479 --> 00:40:27,709
Wow, this is delicious.

566
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:30,349
Ji Hyuk, have some noodles. I'll get you some.

567
00:40:30,419 --> 00:40:32,079
No, it's fine. Don't.

568
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:36,289
I've had indigestion lately, so I'm avoiding spicy and salty food.

569
00:40:36,349 --> 00:40:38,219
- I see. - I'll take those noodles then.

570
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:39,519
Sure.

571
00:40:39,819 --> 00:40:43,829
Ji Wan, if you get the security job, you should start saving every month.

572
00:40:44,129 --> 00:40:45,659
You have to save up for marriage, right?

573
00:40:45,799 --> 00:40:48,229
Geez, I'll handle it myself.

574
00:40:49,529 --> 00:40:50,739
I'll handle it myself.

575
00:40:54,809 --> 00:40:57,109
Su Bin, how have you been lately?

576
00:40:57,739 --> 00:40:59,609
Want me to set you up with someone?

577
00:41:00,909 --> 00:41:02,379
You should worry about yourself.

578
00:41:03,479 --> 00:41:06,579
Word on the street is you've got a massive crush.

579
00:41:07,419 --> 00:41:10,289
For real? You? With an unrequited love?

580
00:41:10,889 --> 00:41:12,559
Aren't you the one who's always getting crushed on?

581
00:41:14,189 --> 00:41:17,129
Dad, you can't keep a secret, can you?

582
00:41:18,629 --> 00:41:20,669
Wait, how did you know about that anyway, Dad?

583
00:41:21,369 --> 00:41:24,039
You're telling me.

584
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:28,509
When was the last time we ordered in without Mom?

585
00:41:29,009 --> 00:41:33,039
Forget that. It's been ages since the three of us had takeout.

586
00:41:34,879 --> 00:41:39,219
- I know. I've been too busy. - Seriously.

587
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:42,919
Ever since you got a job, you've barely been home on weekends.

588
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:47,089
You're right. I've been out way too much.

589
00:41:49,859 --> 00:41:53,299
Is this the normal life you wanted to have?

590
00:41:57,769 --> 00:41:58,899
Dad, what's wrong?

591
00:42:00,199 --> 00:42:01,569
Are you not feeling well?

592
00:42:02,139 --> 00:42:06,239
No, it's nothing. I was just thinking about old times.

593
00:42:13,919 --> 00:42:16,119
Ji Wan, I'm at my studio.

594
00:42:16,549 --> 00:42:18,089
Unbelievable.

595
00:42:19,319 --> 00:42:21,759
I have to run. I'll see you all later.

596
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:23,859
Hey, okay. See you.

597
00:42:34,769 --> 00:42:39,239
(Vice President Park Seong Jae)

598
00:42:39,539 --> 00:42:41,579
What am I doing here on a Sunday?

599
00:42:43,479 --> 00:42:45,979
I have decided not to forgive that woman.

600
00:42:47,049 --> 00:42:49,749
After deceiving and lying to me for 26 years,

601
00:42:50,149 --> 00:42:52,059
she has to pay the price.

602
00:42:53,419 --> 00:42:55,789
You think I can't handle this?

603
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:00,869
I should have moved out sooner.

604
00:43:03,739 --> 00:43:05,439
I wonder if everything's okay at Ji Hyuk's place.

605
00:43:12,739 --> 00:43:14,679
You're at the office again today, aren't you?

606
00:43:15,479 --> 00:43:16,479
Wait.

607
00:43:17,579 --> 00:43:19,619
Why is Su Bin texting me all of a sudden?

608
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:23,919
Shoot, what should I say?

609
00:43:25,689 --> 00:43:28,089
I'm heading to your office. I need to talk to you.

610
00:43:30,329 --> 00:43:31,329
Here?

611
00:43:37,399 --> 00:43:39,939
It's been a while since I've just relaxed on a Sunday.

612
00:43:43,209 --> 00:43:45,379
The air is nice and crisp. It feels good.

613
00:43:58,789 --> 00:44:00,629
- Mom. - Oh my.

614
00:44:00,689 --> 00:44:01,759
(Jameon Medical Devices)

615
00:44:01,859 --> 00:44:04,729
Look at my mom working so hard.

616
00:44:04,929 --> 00:44:08,129
Ji Hyuk, what a surprise. I thought you had the day off.

617
00:44:08,869 --> 00:44:11,139
I was just out for a walk.

618
00:44:11,299 --> 00:44:12,369
I see.

619
00:44:12,369 --> 00:44:14,839
It's only three bus stops away, so it's a nice walk, isn't it?

620
00:44:15,439 --> 00:44:17,179
Wait. Do you walk here too, Mom?

621
00:44:17,709 --> 00:44:20,509
I'm usually in a rush in the morning, so I take the bus,

622
00:44:20,509 --> 00:44:22,109
but sometimes I walk home.

623
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:25,719
I see.

624
00:44:26,779 --> 00:44:27,989
What really brings you here?

625
00:44:29,419 --> 00:44:32,259
I just wanted to see where you work.

626
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:35,059
Am I not supposed to just drop by like this?

627
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:36,829
Don't be silly.

628
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,459
It's just a little out of character for you.

629
00:44:42,699 --> 00:44:44,669
What? How am I being weird?

630
00:44:45,469 --> 00:44:50,069
You were never the kind of son who'd go out of your way to visit.

631
00:44:52,209 --> 00:44:53,209
I guess you're right.

632
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:55,249
I guess I...

633
00:44:55,579 --> 00:44:58,749
I guess I was just too busy having fun on my own.

634
00:44:59,949 --> 00:45:01,919
That must've upset you, Mom.

635
00:45:03,249 --> 00:45:04,859
I suppose I was upset at times.

636
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:08,759
But that's just how all kids are when they grow up.

637
00:45:10,229 --> 00:45:11,429
Back then, I thought time...

638
00:45:12,329 --> 00:45:13,829
would last forever.

639
00:45:16,969 --> 00:45:18,499
Go on, get back to work.

640
00:45:29,609 --> 00:45:30,949
She didn't send anything yesterday,

641
00:45:30,949 --> 00:45:32,879
and she's just sending it now?

642
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:35,149
I'm letting you know so you're not left waiting.

643
00:45:36,289 --> 00:45:38,059
I won't be sending the 10,000 dollars,

644
00:45:38,489 --> 00:45:40,159
and I'm not selling my shares on Monday, either.

645
00:45:41,829 --> 00:45:43,389
What is she talking about?

646
00:45:43,999 --> 00:45:45,759
I can't give you the money I received...

647
00:45:46,099 --> 00:45:47,829
from Dad's side of the family.

648
00:45:48,369 --> 00:45:50,129
You deserve to be punished for what you did.

649
00:45:50,739 --> 00:45:52,769
What you did isn't something that can be easily forgiven.

650
00:45:53,499 --> 00:45:55,309
So, just like Dad wanted,

651
00:45:55,769 --> 00:45:58,979
I think you need to earn a living and beg for forgiveness.

652
00:45:59,609 --> 00:46:00,609
Take care.

653
00:46:01,209 --> 00:46:02,449
Has she lost her mind?

654
00:46:03,409 --> 00:46:06,279
(Daughter Yeong Ra)

655
00:46:10,619 --> 00:46:12,959
(Mom)

656
00:46:17,729 --> 00:46:19,429
Yeong Ra, what's wrong?

657
00:46:20,229 --> 00:46:21,229
Ji Wan.

658
00:46:23,369 --> 00:46:25,499
If you don't want to talk to her, just don't answer.

659
00:46:27,709 --> 00:46:29,569
My mom asked me for money,

660
00:46:29,869 --> 00:46:31,709
but I texted her that I wasn't going to send it,

661
00:46:32,309 --> 00:46:33,309
and now she won't stop calling.

662
00:46:34,479 --> 00:46:35,549
So that's what this is about?

663
00:46:37,009 --> 00:46:38,179
Then just turn off your phone.

664
00:46:39,079 --> 00:46:41,719
Right. Why didn't I think of that?

665
00:46:45,819 --> 00:46:48,229
And if she comes here, you're here, so...

666
00:46:50,829 --> 00:46:52,999
What if she shows up when I'm not here?

667
00:46:54,099 --> 00:46:55,169
I'll just...

668
00:46:56,129 --> 00:46:57,169
not open the door.

669
00:46:58,839 --> 00:47:01,309
Why did you even call me over when you're so tough now?

670
00:47:02,209 --> 00:47:03,439
When did I call you over?

671
00:47:03,769 --> 00:47:06,509
You texted me, saying you were at the studio.

672
00:47:07,409 --> 00:47:08,909
I said I was at the studio.

673
00:47:09,179 --> 00:47:10,449
I don't remember asking you to come over.

674
00:47:10,849 --> 00:47:14,249
- Come on, that's like an invite. - No, it's not.

675
00:47:18,489 --> 00:47:19,789
Your insides must've been screaming.

676
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:22,359
A little.

677
00:47:23,089 --> 00:47:26,529
I was alone, and my mind just kept wandering back to my mom.

678
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:28,229
You did the right thing.

679
00:47:28,769 --> 00:47:30,999
There's nothing like work to keep your mind off things.

680
00:47:31,469 --> 00:47:34,039
Let's start by mapping out the episodes today.

681
00:47:35,569 --> 00:47:36,569
Maybe we should.

682
00:47:36,909 --> 00:47:39,639
I tried outlining a story based on your notes,

683
00:47:39,939 --> 00:47:41,309
and the story possibilities are endless.

684
00:47:41,749 --> 00:47:44,119
So I'm thinking of aiming for over 200 episodes this time.

685
00:47:45,019 --> 00:47:46,179
Over 200 episodes?

686
00:47:46,919 --> 00:47:49,089
The phone is turned off. Please leave a message...

687
00:47:49,389 --> 00:47:51,359
Yeong Ra actually turned her phone off?

688
00:47:54,659 --> 00:47:56,429
So, Park Jin Seok has her wrapped around his finger.

689
00:47:59,129 --> 00:48:02,129
Why didn't I realize he'd cut off her allowance?

690
00:48:04,539 --> 00:48:06,669
Did he expect this to go all the way to a lawsuit?

691
00:48:10,309 --> 00:48:12,179
(Standard)

692
00:48:15,449 --> 00:48:16,449
Park Jin Seok.

693
00:48:17,109 --> 00:48:19,679
Fine. You're really something else.

694
00:48:20,849 --> 00:48:21,849
But...

695
00:48:22,249 --> 00:48:25,119
you don't know me as well as you think.

696
00:48:26,389 --> 00:48:30,259
I'm going to put you right back where you were before you met me.

697
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:33,099
Not a chance.

698
00:48:53,219 --> 00:48:54,689
Darn it.

699
00:48:55,789 --> 00:48:57,319
A hundred dollars is all I have.

700
00:49:03,689 --> 00:49:04,999
Even if you back me into a corner like this,

701
00:49:06,429 --> 00:49:09,029
you can't send me to the rock bottom you're hoping for.

702
00:49:20,949 --> 00:49:21,949
Su Bin.

703
00:49:22,449 --> 00:49:23,449
How have you been?

704
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:32,359
Come on in.

705
00:49:32,619 --> 00:49:36,559
(Shoealls)

706
00:49:36,629 --> 00:49:40,829
Want something to drink? My secretary's not in today, so...

707
00:49:42,529 --> 00:49:43,529
I don't want anything.

708
00:49:54,649 --> 00:49:55,749
Does my dad have cancer?

709
00:49:57,479 --> 00:49:58,479
What?

710
00:49:59,449 --> 00:50:00,619
Just be honest with me.

711
00:50:01,549 --> 00:50:04,619
Why were you at my house yesterday? Why did you leave in tears?

712
00:50:08,359 --> 00:50:10,289
You saw me leaving?

713
00:50:11,159 --> 00:50:13,399
Yes, I saw you.

714
00:50:14,499 --> 00:50:18,139
You left crying, and Dad was the only one home.

715
00:50:19,139 --> 00:50:23,309
I thought you came for his blessing and he'd given you a hard time.

716
00:50:23,909 --> 00:50:25,979
But you wouldn't do that without talking to me first.

717
00:50:27,439 --> 00:50:28,849
But then my dad was acting weird.

718
00:50:29,779 --> 00:50:31,319
He must have seen you,

719
00:50:32,049 --> 00:50:34,519
but he said he was taking a nap with the door locked.

720
00:50:35,819 --> 00:50:38,489
Then he went out and didn't come back until late.

721
00:50:39,319 --> 00:50:41,329
He said he wasn't feeling well and just wanted to rest.

722
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:45,959
I see.

723
00:50:46,999 --> 00:50:50,769
I've thought about it over and over, and I'm sure it has to do with Dad.

724
00:50:52,569 --> 00:50:54,309
Something's wrong with my dad, isn't it?

725
00:50:55,769 --> 00:50:57,939
Please, just tell me.

726
00:50:58,209 --> 00:50:59,879
Does my dad have cancer or something?

727
00:51:00,579 --> 00:51:01,709
No.

728
00:51:02,349 --> 00:51:03,349
It's nothing like that.

729
00:51:03,949 --> 00:51:05,819
This is exactly why I wanted to keep it a secret!

730
00:51:07,919 --> 00:51:09,449
Then why were you crying?

731
00:51:13,219 --> 00:51:15,489
You were right.

732
00:51:16,729 --> 00:51:17,759
I went to ask for his blessing.

733
00:51:18,699 --> 00:51:20,629
I tried begging him one more time.

734
00:51:22,269 --> 00:51:23,569
What did you say to him?

735
00:51:24,969 --> 00:51:26,969
What reason did Dad give for saying no?

736
00:51:28,969 --> 00:51:29,969
It's just...

737
00:51:35,549 --> 00:51:37,509
What did Dad say while he was crying?

738
00:51:39,549 --> 00:51:40,549
Was your father crying?

739
00:51:42,449 --> 00:51:44,219
You didn't even know my dad cried?

740
00:51:49,629 --> 00:51:51,359
You weren't there to get his blessing.

741
00:51:53,629 --> 00:51:55,899
Please, just tell me.

742
00:51:56,829 --> 00:51:59,669
This is about my dad, so I have a right to know, don't I?

743
00:51:59,869 --> 00:52:02,939
Did Dad tell you not to tell me? Did he ask you to keep it a secret?

744
00:52:07,209 --> 00:52:10,749
If you're not going to tell me, then I'll go ask him myself.

745
00:52:11,449 --> 00:52:14,079
If something's wrong with Dad, Mom has to know.

746
00:52:15,089 --> 00:52:16,089
Your mother?

747
00:52:19,919 --> 00:52:21,429
Okay, Su Bin.

748
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:26,599
You're good at keeping promises, right?

749
00:52:27,899 --> 00:52:29,529
If you say you won't say anything, you won't.

750
00:52:30,229 --> 00:52:32,399
And if you promise to break up with someone, you do it, right?

751
00:52:34,339 --> 00:52:35,909
You won't waver.

752
00:52:37,269 --> 00:52:38,609
And you can handle this, right?

753
00:52:41,179 --> 00:52:42,849
Yes. I can.

754
00:52:46,679 --> 00:52:47,749
It's not your father.

755
00:52:49,949 --> 00:52:50,959
It's Ji Hyuk.

756
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:55,359
Ji Hyuk's the one who's sick, Su Bin.

757
00:52:58,159 --> 00:52:59,159
What?

758
00:53:03,829 --> 00:53:04,839
Honey.

759
00:53:05,169 --> 00:53:06,999
- Have some fruit. - I don't want any.

760
00:53:07,269 --> 00:53:09,539
Dad, come on. Have some with me.

761
00:53:12,179 --> 00:53:13,179
All right.

762
00:53:15,049 --> 00:53:16,579
Hey, what's with you?

763
00:53:16,649 --> 00:53:18,819
You listen to Ji Hyuk more than you listen to me.

764
00:53:22,619 --> 00:53:24,659
Roasted sweet potatoes are here!

765
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:28,729
Hey, what's this? They still sell sweet potatoes?

766
00:53:28,759 --> 00:53:31,259
Didn't you know? Before you get to the main road,

767
00:53:31,329 --> 00:53:34,869
a guy comes on Wednesdays and Sundays. He's there every year.

768
00:53:35,069 --> 00:53:37,199
Really? I had no idea.

769
00:53:38,199 --> 00:53:40,099
What are you doing out so late?

770
00:53:40,569 --> 00:53:43,309
You haven't been seeing Seong Jae again, have you?

771
00:53:43,709 --> 00:53:46,909
No, Mom. If you can't even trust your own daughter,

772
00:53:47,209 --> 00:53:49,049
I might as well just go see him for real.

773
00:53:50,249 --> 00:53:51,719
I'm just worried about you.

774
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:54,919
If you're so worried, then stop bringing up Seong Jae.

775
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:56,489
You're just making me miss him.

776
00:54:00,519 --> 00:54:02,459
(Take pill)

777
00:54:02,529 --> 00:54:05,499
Shoot. I just remembered I have something to do.

778
00:54:05,559 --> 00:54:09,469
Okay. Go on upstairs and work. I'll bring you up some coffee.

779
00:54:10,499 --> 00:54:12,139
He can't have coffee.

780
00:54:12,699 --> 00:54:16,109
No, that's all right. I'll just grab a glass of water.

781
00:54:17,409 --> 00:54:20,279
Ji Hyuk, I'll bring it up with some sweet potatoes.

782
00:54:20,709 --> 00:54:23,309
It's a good excuse to escape Mom's nagging.

783
00:54:24,749 --> 00:54:26,279
Sure, thanks. I appreciate it.

784
00:54:31,989 --> 00:54:36,129
Su Bin, no way. What's all this? Why the royal treatment?

785
00:54:36,959 --> 00:54:38,059
No reason.

786
00:54:38,459 --> 00:54:41,029
You're working so hard after taking over the company,

787
00:54:41,429 --> 00:54:43,069
and I realized I've been kind of thoughtless.

788
00:54:45,269 --> 00:54:46,999
My little sister, I'm touched.

789
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:51,039
But you must be going through a lot with Seong Jae.

790
00:54:52,779 --> 00:54:53,779
Su Bin.

791
00:54:54,479 --> 00:54:55,579
Things have been tough lately, haven't they?

792
00:54:57,749 --> 00:54:59,279
Tough? What are you talking about?

793
00:55:01,949 --> 00:55:04,859
I'm completely over it, so take your time and eat.

794
00:55:05,989 --> 00:55:07,489
- Get some rest. - Okay.

795
00:55:14,229 --> 00:55:15,769
She's just putting on a brave face.

796
00:55:16,999 --> 00:55:18,339
How could she not be hurting?

797
00:55:19,839 --> 00:55:22,169
It's hard enough for me just thinking about Eun Oh.

798
00:55:33,049 --> 00:55:34,789
Poor Ji Hyuk.

799
00:56:01,309 --> 00:56:03,379
- I'm off. - Okay. Have a good day.

800
00:56:18,999 --> 00:56:21,299
Father, shall we go?

801
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:24,169
Sure, let's go.

802
00:56:29,909 --> 00:56:32,079
The CEO isn't in yet.

803
00:56:32,409 --> 00:56:34,009
He isn't?

804
00:56:39,619 --> 00:56:42,589
He's been taking some kind of medicine lately.

805
00:56:53,699 --> 00:56:54,999
Excuse me, Mr. Cha.

806
00:56:55,669 --> 00:56:59,169
I need his approval on something for the Life 30 project.

807
00:56:59,699 --> 00:57:02,209
Do you know what time the CEO's doctor's appointment is today?

808
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:06,339
A doctor's appointment?

809
00:57:08,179 --> 00:57:09,949
He's been taking medicine constantly.

810
00:57:15,019 --> 00:57:16,019
Has he?

811
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:24,859
I'm sure this is a lot to take in.

812
00:57:26,629 --> 00:57:27,629
It is.

813
00:57:29,169 --> 00:57:31,369
Is there anything in particular you'd like to know?

814
00:57:31,799 --> 00:57:32,869
Please, ask.

815
00:57:33,869 --> 00:57:37,369
My son told me some of it,

816
00:57:37,869 --> 00:57:39,739
and I've also done my own research online.

817
00:57:40,179 --> 00:57:43,209
So I have a general idea of what dilated cardiomyopathy is,

818
00:57:43,709 --> 00:57:45,349
and what his current condition is.

819
00:57:45,949 --> 00:57:47,749
I understand the basics.

820
00:57:48,419 --> 00:57:49,419
In that case...

821
00:57:51,459 --> 00:57:56,129
Can you tell me how many people are ahead of him on the waitlist?

822
00:57:56,429 --> 00:57:59,959
And what about an artificial heart? Is that an option?

823
00:58:05,569 --> 00:58:07,139
For a heart transplant,

824
00:58:07,569 --> 00:58:10,139
it has to be a living heart from a brain-dead donor.

825
00:58:11,809 --> 00:58:15,079
That's why it's hard to give you a precise number on the waitlist.

826
00:58:16,509 --> 00:58:18,549
The patient's condition is also a factor.

827
00:58:25,659 --> 00:58:26,989
Realistically speaking,

828
00:58:27,719 --> 00:58:29,759
the situation isn't promising.

829
00:59:00,189 --> 00:59:02,589
Your numbers haven't changed much.

830
00:59:03,989 --> 00:59:05,799
You've been taking your medication, correct?

831
00:59:06,599 --> 00:59:07,599
Yes.

832
00:59:08,899 --> 00:59:10,169
My father...

833
00:59:11,169 --> 00:59:12,369
Did he seem to understand everything?

834
00:59:13,539 --> 00:59:14,539
Yes.

835
00:59:27,419 --> 00:59:28,419
Ji Hyuk.

836
00:59:29,619 --> 00:59:30,619
Let's go.

837
00:59:31,689 --> 00:59:32,689
Sure.

838
00:59:42,099 --> 00:59:43,569
It's like trying to catch a stroke of luck...

839
00:59:44,299 --> 00:59:46,069
that may never come.

840
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:51,239
He said the only way is to wait for a stranger's heart.

841
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:53,079
That's right.

842
00:59:53,639 --> 00:59:56,049
But still, let's not lose hope.

843
00:59:57,209 --> 00:59:58,219
I just...

844
00:59:59,449 --> 01:00:03,119
I don't want you to live your life...

845
01:00:03,189 --> 01:00:05,189
as if you're just checking items off a bucket list,

846
01:00:07,059 --> 01:00:09,089
as if you've already accepted the end.

847
01:00:09,629 --> 01:00:11,289
This sense of responsibility for the company,

848
01:00:11,999 --> 01:00:13,559
or any regrets you have about our family.

849
01:00:14,999 --> 01:00:16,069
Things like that.

850
01:00:17,099 --> 01:00:18,669
I hope you can let it all go.

851
01:00:21,299 --> 01:00:22,709
It's not like that.

852
01:00:24,069 --> 01:00:25,109
I just...

853
01:00:25,609 --> 01:00:27,079
want to live a normal life.

854
01:00:29,749 --> 01:00:30,749
I see.

855
01:00:31,579 --> 01:00:32,779
Well, that's a relief.

856
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:36,289
Thanks, Dad.

857
01:00:39,819 --> 01:00:42,129
You thank me for the silliest things.

858
01:00:43,189 --> 01:00:44,359
Go on, head to work.

859
01:01:12,459 --> 01:01:14,419
You could've at least waited for me to answer.

860
01:01:14,689 --> 01:01:15,729
Has he?

01:01:42,349 --> 01:01:45,359
Hey, Yeon Ju. I just sent you a photo.

864
01:01:45,719 --> 01:01:47,559
Can you find out what this medication is for?

865
01:01:49,459 --> 01:01:51,459
Okay, great. Thanks, I appreciate it.

(Certificate of All Registered Matters - Condominium)

869
01:02:05,939 --> 01:02:09,249
Of the seven collateral mortgages, I didn't consent to a single one.

870
01:02:09,709 --> 01:02:12,919
So your husband really forged your seal...

871
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:14,419
and did all this?

872
01:02:15,319 --> 01:02:18,419
All seven properties were mortgaged on the same day.

873
01:02:18,919 --> 01:02:21,859
And I got no money in my account from Park Jin Seok.

874
01:02:22,859 --> 01:02:25,629
I never once gave him my ID or my official seal.

875
01:02:27,799 --> 01:02:31,129
You said he was insanely jealous, but this is on another level.

876
01:02:31,669 --> 01:02:34,169
I told him I wanted a divorce as I couldn't stand his jealousy.

877
01:02:34,939 --> 01:02:36,309
So he decided to trap me.

878
01:02:40,539 --> 01:02:42,909
So you want to file a lawsuit to contest all of these?

Except for these two. They were anniversary gifts.

881

I just want to get back the assets I've built up on my own.

01:02:57,829 --> 01:03:00,459
Most people in your position would want to fight for these too.

883
01:03:05,499 --> 01:03:06,599
How about it?

884
01:03:07,069 --> 01:03:08,739
Would you like to retain me today?

885
01:03:11,979 --> 01:03:13,509
I can't afford the retainer fee.

886
01:03:14,839 --> 01:03:17,579
- Pardon? - I told you before.

887
01:03:18,449 --> 01:03:21,149
He hid everything, the gold bars, the cash, all of it.

888
01:03:22,519 --> 01:03:24,919
In that case, I'm afraid I can't take your case.

889
01:03:25,889 --> 01:03:27,559
What if you get paid after we win?

890
01:03:28,459 --> 01:03:30,989
I'll give you a 20 percent contingency fee.

891
01:03:31,899 --> 01:03:35,369
Their total value, minus deposits, is over 40 million dollars.

892
01:03:35,799 --> 01:03:37,229
Then the contingency fee would be...

893
01:03:37,569 --> 01:03:38,699
Eight million dollars.

894
01:03:40,569 --> 01:03:43,409
(Attorney Han Seong Ju)

895
01:03:43,469 --> 01:03:47,139
Isn't this an open-and-shut case to invalidate collateral mortgage?

896
01:03:48,379 --> 01:03:51,979
Once we're in court, we'll have access to the CCTV.

897
01:03:52,049 --> 01:03:53,679
It'll show who used my Power of Attorney.

898
01:03:53,949 --> 01:03:56,019
And there's no record of any money being deposited into my account.

899
01:03:56,319 --> 01:03:58,889
Plus, most importantly, I'll be testifying.

900
01:04:02,759 --> 01:04:04,999
Are you saying you don't think you can win?

901
01:04:05,159 --> 01:04:07,329
No, it's not that, it's just...

902
01:04:07,929 --> 01:04:11,069
I know my offer is unconventional, Counselor.

903
01:04:11,869 --> 01:04:13,799
So please, take some time to think it over.

904
01:04:14,069 --> 01:04:15,639
Say, five minutes?

905
01:04:16,109 --> 01:04:17,509
That should be enough time, don't you think?

906
01:04:18,379 --> 01:04:21,339
If you say no, I have a meeting with another lawyer to get to.

907
01:04:24,249 --> 01:04:26,249
(Younglim)

908
01:04:27,679 --> 01:04:29,349
(Yeon Ju)

909
01:04:31,689 --> 01:04:33,389
Hey, Yeon Ju. What is the medicine for?

910
01:04:36,129 --> 01:04:37,159
What?

911
01:04:52,239 --> 01:04:54,479
If we can draw up a contract for a 20 percent contingency fee,

912
01:04:54,679 --> 01:04:55,749
I'll take the case.

913
01:04:59,419 --> 01:05:01,989
If we win this lawsuit to invalidate collateral mortgage,

914
01:05:02,149 --> 01:05:05,489
can we use it to file for a divorce lawsuit as well?

915
01:05:05,589 --> 01:05:07,759
Of course. This will establish that your husband is the at-fault party.

916
01:05:08,659 --> 01:05:12,259
Then I'd like you to handle the divorce lawsuit too, Mr. Han.

917
01:05:13,059 --> 01:05:14,529
Since you already know all the details.

918
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:18,569
Of course. It's to your advantage to have me handle the divorce too.

919
01:05:19,699 --> 01:05:21,099
Then...

920
01:05:21,369 --> 01:05:22,509
Let's draw up the contract right now.

921
01:05:23,539 --> 01:05:27,139
Since your husband threatened you, I'll add a confidentiality clause.

922
01:05:28,109 --> 01:05:32,319
So when can you file the complaint? The sooner the better.

923
01:05:32,749 --> 01:05:37,349
I'll need a marriage certificate, your recorded statement,

924
01:05:37,419 --> 01:05:40,289
and bank statements with no actual monetary transactions.

925
01:05:40,359 --> 01:05:41,559
Then we can file the complaint right away.

926
01:05:43,159 --> 01:05:45,029
That's quite a lot to prepare.

927
01:05:47,459 --> 01:05:49,029
How about this, Mr. Han?

928
01:05:49,929 --> 01:05:52,939
I have a better idea.

929
01:06:26,639 --> 01:06:29,639
(Our Golden Days)

930
01:06:29,739 --> 01:06:31,509
I'm done opposing you two.

931
01:06:31,809 --> 01:06:33,039
Just focus on yourselves.

932
01:06:33,339 --> 01:06:35,879
From now on, you... I mean, Ms. Ji.

933
01:06:35,879 --> 01:06:38,409
You're just my employee. Nothing more, nothing less.

934
01:06:38,519 --> 01:06:41,079
Just you watch. I'm going to be Lee Ji Hyuk's girlfriend.

935
01:06:41,179 --> 01:06:43,319
I wonder what you'll pull next.

936
01:06:43,319 --> 01:06:45,189
You're clearly backed into a corner now.

937
01:06:45,359 --> 01:06:47,119
We can do that right away, can't we?

938
01:06:47,359 --> 01:06:49,689
If we can pull that off... But will it really work?

939
01:06:49,759 --> 01:06:51,429
Give me 200,000 dollars from the money I gave you.

940
01:06:51,429 --> 01:06:52,829
It's your responsibility.

941
01:06:52,899 --> 01:06:54,359
Hey, Ji Eun Oh!

942
01:06:54,459 --> 01:06:57,799
Of all people, why did it have to be Ji Hyuk? Please, just save him.

943
01:06:57,869 --> 01:07:00,869
Please, just save him. I'm begging you.
