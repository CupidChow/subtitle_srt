1
00:00:01,094 --> 00:00:03,834
Ji Hyuk! Mom was in a car accident and rushed to the hospital.

2
00:00:03,894 --> 00:00:05,964
She's unconscious. Just hurry.

3
00:00:06,234 --> 00:00:07,234
Please.

4
00:00:08,404 --> 00:00:09,574
Please, no.

00:00:10,604 --> 00:00:12,504
(Emergency Room, Family Waiting Area)

6
00:00:16,444 --> 00:00:17,444
Dad!

7
00:00:18,114 --> 00:00:19,384
She has passed away.

8
00:00:20,314 --> 00:00:23,114
She was already in cardiac arrest when she arrived in the ER.

9
00:00:25,524 --> 00:00:28,524
What do you mean she passed away?

10
00:00:35,964 --> 00:00:36,964
Doctor.

11
00:00:37,594 --> 00:00:38,634
Doctor, but...

12
00:00:39,334 --> 00:00:40,334
No...

13
00:00:41,534 --> 00:00:42,534
Ji Hyuk.

14
00:00:43,434 --> 00:00:44,434
Ji Wan.

15
00:00:44,844 --> 00:00:47,844
Ji Hyuk, what is it? How's Mom?

16
00:00:48,714 --> 00:00:51,844
Your mom? What about her?

17
00:00:52,144 --> 00:00:54,684
I got a call saying Mom was in a car accident.

18
00:00:57,754 --> 00:00:58,954
Doctor.

19
00:00:59,884 --> 00:01:03,154
Wait, wasn't it Jo Ok Rye who passed away?

20
00:01:04,654 --> 00:01:07,624
- Grandma? - They were in the same accident.

21
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:10,964
Ms. Jo Ok Rye had a cardiac arrest in the ambulance,

22
00:01:11,334 --> 00:01:13,064
so she was already deceased upon arrival.

23
00:01:13,564 --> 00:01:17,074
Ms. Kim Da Jeong had a CT scan for a concussion,

24
00:01:17,234 --> 00:01:18,774
and is currently waiting to be admitted to a room.

25
00:01:20,044 --> 00:01:24,544
But why were they in an accident together...

26
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:27,744
- Mother. My mother. - Dad!

27
00:01:27,984 --> 00:01:28,984
- Dad. - Dad!

28
00:01:29,054 --> 00:01:30,914
So, my grandma is the one who passed away?

29
00:01:32,624 --> 00:01:34,254
- Where's my mother? - Doctor!

30
00:01:36,124 --> 00:01:38,894
Is it true? Is my grandma really gone?

31
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:41,764
- Sir, you need to be quiet in here. - Ji Hyuk, your grandmother...

32
00:01:42,564 --> 00:01:44,234
A staff member will be here shortly to assist the family.

33
00:01:44,294 --> 00:01:45,304
Where is my mother?

34
00:01:45,364 --> 00:01:47,304
Please wait a moment, and we'll escort you to the morgue.

35
00:01:48,004 --> 00:01:51,304
- Go check on Mom. I'll handle Dad. - My mother...

36
00:01:51,374 --> 00:01:53,274
- Please follow me. - Mother...

37
00:01:53,344 --> 00:01:54,344
- Just go. Hurry up. - Where is my mother?

38
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:56,644
- Dad. - Ji Hyuk, your grandma...

39
00:01:56,944 --> 00:01:58,614
- I asked where my mother is! - Dad.

40
00:01:59,484 --> 00:02:01,454
- Dad, please calm down. - My mother.

41
00:02:01,514 --> 00:02:02,584
- Mother! - Please...

42
00:02:03,214 --> 00:02:04,214
Mother.

43
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:13,364
- Mom. - Mom.

44
00:02:15,194 --> 00:02:16,194
Your grandmother...

45
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,404
Is your grandmother really gone?

46
00:02:22,734 --> 00:02:23,734
Yes.

47
00:02:24,304 --> 00:02:26,674
But I don't know. I still can't believe it, Mom.

48
00:02:27,504 --> 00:02:28,974
Ma'am, how are you feeling now?

49
00:02:29,514 --> 00:02:31,844
- Are you very dizzy? - A little.

50
00:02:35,854 --> 00:02:38,524
What's my mom's condition?

51
00:02:39,424 --> 00:02:41,994
The CT scan showed no major issues,

52
00:02:42,324 --> 00:02:45,824
but we'll keep her for a few days to monitor for concussion symptoms.

53
00:02:46,524 --> 00:02:48,364
We'll let you know when her room is ready.

54
00:02:48,694 --> 00:02:50,094
She needs absolute rest.

55
00:02:52,434 --> 00:02:53,534
So...

56
00:02:57,274 --> 00:02:59,404
Grandma really is gone, then?

57
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:05,014
But Mom, what happened? Why were you two in a cab together?

58
00:03:06,214 --> 00:03:07,584
We went to the department store.

59
00:03:09,784 --> 00:03:12,354
Your grandmother came to my shop wanting to buy me some clothes.

60
00:03:14,954 --> 00:03:18,894
I must have been out of my mind. Why did I even go with her?

61
00:03:23,594 --> 00:03:25,304
Mom, don't cry.

62
00:03:25,804 --> 00:03:28,174
You need absolute rest. Please don't cry.

63
00:03:28,874 --> 00:03:30,004
He's right, Mom.

64
00:03:30,534 --> 00:03:34,774
Don't cry. Just lie down. We can't lose you too.

65
00:03:34,844 --> 00:03:35,944
Please, don't cry.

66
00:03:44,114 --> 00:03:46,624
Dad. Why don't you sit down over here?

67
00:04:05,844 --> 00:04:07,844
(Vice President Park Seong Jae)

68
00:04:11,814 --> 00:04:12,884
Hey, Su Bin.

69
00:04:13,714 --> 00:04:14,714
Seong Jae.

70
00:04:17,014 --> 00:04:18,554
My grandmother passed away.

71
00:04:21,454 --> 00:04:22,554
My grandma...

72
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:26,924
She's gone.

73
00:04:31,394 --> 00:04:32,804
What do you mean?

74
00:04:34,204 --> 00:04:35,474
Gone?

75
00:04:36,834 --> 00:04:41,274
Grandma insisted on taking Mom to the department store for clothes.

76
00:04:41,774 --> 00:04:43,574
And then, some car just came out of nowhere...

77
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:46,444
Mom's okay, but...

78
00:04:47,284 --> 00:04:48,854
My grandma...

79
00:04:49,614 --> 00:04:51,184
She had a heart attack.

80
00:04:56,194 --> 00:04:58,564
Su Bin, listen, Ji Hyuk is calling me right now.

81
00:04:59,094 --> 00:05:01,634
Let me talk to him. I'll call you right back.

82
00:05:04,764 --> 00:05:05,804
Hey, Ji Hyuk.

83
00:05:06,534 --> 00:05:08,704
What is all this? Did Grandma really pass away?

84
00:05:10,774 --> 00:05:11,774
Yes, Seong Jae.

85
00:05:13,044 --> 00:05:14,304
I can't believe this is happening.

86
00:05:16,244 --> 00:05:17,714
Hey, how's your mom doing?

87
00:05:18,714 --> 00:05:19,884
My mom's fine, but...

88
00:05:22,654 --> 00:05:24,514
Grandma passed away from a heart attack.

89
00:05:25,754 --> 00:05:26,924
Which hospital are you at?

90
00:05:27,424 --> 00:05:31,194
I'll let your work and friends know, so just have Ji Wan handle the rest.

91
00:05:31,354 --> 00:05:32,394
No, don't worry about it.

92
00:05:34,324 --> 00:05:36,094
Both my father and I...

93
00:05:37,834 --> 00:05:39,164
have decided to keep the service small.

94
00:05:41,434 --> 00:05:42,774
This must be really hard on your father.

95
00:05:44,174 --> 00:05:46,444
Make sure you take good care of him. I'm on my way, Ji Hyuk.

96
00:05:48,244 --> 00:05:49,274
Oh, no.

97
00:05:50,974 --> 00:05:51,984
Yes.

98
00:05:53,084 --> 00:05:54,184
Okay, I understand.

99
00:05:55,184 --> 00:05:57,114
Yes, I'll pass that along to Cheol Min as well.

100
00:05:58,724 --> 00:05:59,754
And...

101
00:06:00,454 --> 00:06:01,524
Ji Hyuk...

102
00:06:02,894 --> 00:06:04,724
He specifically asked not to tell Eun Oh.

103
00:06:06,524 --> 00:06:07,524
Right.

104
00:06:08,124 --> 00:06:09,134
Got it.

105
00:06:10,294 --> 00:06:12,964
So, he can start practicing walking, right?

106
00:06:13,434 --> 00:06:15,574
He keeps insisting on using the wheelchair.

107
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:18,174
He can start with some light walking.

108
00:06:18,804 --> 00:06:21,144
Walking a little bit at a time will help with his recovery.

109
00:06:22,744 --> 00:06:23,814
See?

110
00:06:25,414 --> 00:06:28,654
- I understand. - Call us if there are any problems.

111
00:06:36,524 --> 00:06:38,224
Now, I can finally breathe easier.

112
00:06:39,094 --> 00:06:40,224
And you heard what he said, right?

113
00:06:40,764 --> 00:06:43,194
You need to focus on recovering as quickly as possible.

114
00:06:43,594 --> 00:06:46,404
I'll practice walking with the caregiver,

115
00:06:47,234 --> 00:06:48,374
so you can go home now.

116
00:06:50,904 --> 00:06:51,904
Woo Jin.

117
00:06:53,504 --> 00:06:55,874
Ever since you started having liver problems,

118
00:06:56,744 --> 00:06:58,814
I've had to come here behind Chairman Park's back.

119
00:06:59,444 --> 00:07:02,254
Don't you forget how I've been living on pins and needles.

120
00:07:04,514 --> 00:07:07,924
Making you so wary after I remarried and brought you into this family...

121
00:07:08,994 --> 00:07:11,024
I did it because I wanted to make it all up to you.

122
00:07:11,654 --> 00:07:12,694
You know that, don't you?

123
00:07:18,234 --> 00:07:20,364
When you get out of the hospital and go back to the US,

124
00:07:20,864 --> 00:07:22,434
you need to kick it into high gear.

125
00:07:23,274 --> 00:07:25,074
Manage your last semester well...

126
00:07:25,444 --> 00:07:28,844
and ensure you get better grades than Park Seong Jae, okay?

127
00:07:29,544 --> 00:07:30,544
I...

128
00:07:31,644 --> 00:07:35,314
Mom, do you still believe I can beat Seong Jae?

129
00:07:37,854 --> 00:07:38,884
Of course, I do.

130
00:07:39,454 --> 00:07:41,684
Because you have to beat Seong Jae. No matter what.

131
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,824
No matter how much Park Seong Jae has changed,

132
00:07:45,324 --> 00:07:46,664
you will become even stronger.

133
00:07:56,004 --> 00:07:58,844
Here are the scholarship candidates, sent from each school.

134
00:07:59,144 --> 00:08:00,644
You need them sorted by the end of the year, right?

135
00:08:00,644 --> 00:08:01,674
Yes, ma'am.

136
00:08:07,984 --> 00:08:10,154
I just felt a little dizzy,

137
00:08:10,484 --> 00:08:14,054
but Seong Jae dragged me here for a CT scan.

138
00:08:14,954 --> 00:08:16,554
As of today, Seong Jae is the Vice President.

139
00:08:16,894 --> 00:08:18,154
Seong Jae was the one who found it.

140
00:08:18,894 --> 00:08:21,024
The subtle difference between 3A and 2A grade.

141
00:08:22,864 --> 00:08:24,894
I made sure he had no ambition,

142
00:08:25,234 --> 00:08:26,804
so why has he suddenly changed?

143
00:08:28,104 --> 00:08:30,234
People don't just change for no reason.

144
00:08:31,374 --> 00:08:34,044
Because Seong Jae changed, Chairman Park changed too.

145
00:08:46,854 --> 00:08:48,524
(Detective Agency)

146
00:08:50,224 --> 00:08:52,194
Have you hired us before?

147
00:08:52,194 --> 00:08:53,924
No. This is the first time.

148
00:08:54,824 --> 00:08:57,634
If you can start today, I'll pay an extra 50 percent.

149
00:08:57,964 --> 00:09:00,564
Yes, we can start immediately. Please send us the subject's info.

150
00:09:05,004 --> 00:09:06,004
What am I going to do...

151
00:09:06,304 --> 00:09:08,174
Seong Jae, what's wrong?

152
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,314
Ji Hyuk's grandmother passed away.

153
00:09:12,414 --> 00:09:13,644
I just came home to change.

154
00:09:15,584 --> 00:09:16,614
Ji Hyuk?

155
00:09:17,854 --> 00:09:19,424
Isn't that Ji Wan's older brother's name?

156
00:09:25,964 --> 00:09:29,464
Wait, so is it Ji Wan's grandmother who passed away?

157
00:09:31,264 --> 00:09:32,264
Yes.

158
00:09:32,764 --> 00:09:33,864
Why all of a sudden?

159
00:09:34,264 --> 00:09:36,634
But I heard she was even going to be in a fashion show.

160
00:09:37,004 --> 00:09:38,604
She was in a car accident,

161
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,474
and I guess the shock caused a heart attack.

162
00:09:42,844 --> 00:09:46,144
That's terrible. Ji Wan must be so devastated.

163
00:09:47,244 --> 00:09:50,484
We're all in shock. I still can't believe it myself.

164
00:09:52,284 --> 00:09:53,984
She was in such good health, too.

165
00:09:56,454 --> 00:09:58,254
I guess you really never know when your time will come.

166
00:09:58,794 --> 00:10:01,024
Yeong Ra, I'm going to go change.

167
00:10:01,524 --> 00:10:02,534
Okay.

168
00:10:28,024 --> 00:10:29,054
No.

169
00:10:29,854 --> 00:10:31,624
It's my mother-in-law's funeral.

170
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:37,664
I should be there to see her off. How can I just lie here like this?

171
00:10:38,064 --> 00:10:40,364
There's nothing for you to do, Mom.

172
00:10:41,064 --> 00:10:44,104
Ji Wan went to get her portrait,

173
00:10:44,474 --> 00:10:46,574
and Ji Hyuk is handling the funeral arrangements.

174
00:10:46,944 --> 00:10:48,744
He didn't even invite anyone from AP.

175
00:10:49,214 --> 00:10:51,944
Dad wanted a small service, just for the family.

176
00:10:54,184 --> 00:10:57,454
You should at least go. You need to be there.

177
00:10:58,054 --> 00:11:01,854
- Isn't the caregiver coming soon? - I'll go when they get here, Mom.

178
00:11:10,494 --> 00:11:11,494
Mom.

179
00:11:13,404 --> 00:11:16,404
Mom, you need to stay in bed. Okay?

180
00:11:23,644 --> 00:11:24,644
Ji Hyuk...

181
00:11:27,814 --> 00:11:29,114
Mom... Thank you.

182
00:11:33,054 --> 00:11:34,254
I know this isn't the time, but...

183
00:11:38,094 --> 00:11:39,264
Thank you for being okay.

184
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:43,294
I was so scared, thinking...

185
00:11:44,634 --> 00:11:46,204
something terrible had happened to you too.

186
00:11:50,874 --> 00:11:54,044
But how is your father holding up?

187
00:11:56,014 --> 00:11:57,014
Dad...

188
00:11:59,544 --> 00:12:00,814
He's just in a daze.

189
00:12:02,284 --> 00:12:04,454
It's because Grandma's passing was so sudden.

190
00:12:07,584 --> 00:12:08,854
I don't think it's sunk in for him yet.

191
00:12:12,564 --> 00:12:16,864
It doesn't matter how old he is. His mother is still his mother.

192
00:12:22,204 --> 00:12:24,004
Make sure to look after your father, Ji Hyuk.

193
00:12:28,074 --> 00:12:29,114
I will.

194
00:12:30,244 --> 00:12:32,884
You just focus on resting like you were told,

195
00:12:34,684 --> 00:12:39,524
and if you feel nauseous or dizzy, tell the caregiver right away. Okay?

196
00:12:41,254 --> 00:12:44,724
Stop worrying about me. The living have to go on.

197
00:12:46,024 --> 00:12:47,664
Go on, get back to the funeral preparations.

198
00:12:48,224 --> 00:12:49,864
Your father won't be able to think straight.

199
00:13:05,144 --> 00:13:06,144
Okay.

200
00:13:07,314 --> 00:13:08,444
I will.

201
00:13:25,164 --> 00:13:27,864
Hey, I brought Grandma's portrait.

202
00:13:29,334 --> 00:13:30,334
Okay.

203
00:13:51,394 --> 00:13:52,794
Grandma...

204
00:13:54,764 --> 00:13:56,934
Did you frame it?

205
00:13:58,634 --> 00:13:59,634
No.

206
00:14:01,334 --> 00:14:02,474
Grandma...

207
00:14:03,874 --> 00:14:05,474
It turns out she had it prepared already.

208
00:14:08,244 --> 00:14:09,244
Grandma...

209
00:14:20,784 --> 00:14:22,324
Grandma...

210
00:14:24,954 --> 00:14:28,864
It wasn't your time yet. Grandma...

211
00:14:29,964 --> 00:14:32,464
It's too soon.

212
00:14:32,964 --> 00:14:37,634
Grandma!

213
00:14:41,274 --> 00:14:45,114
It's too soon. Grandma!

214
00:14:48,444 --> 00:14:49,654
No...

215
00:14:50,114 --> 00:14:51,314
Su Bin.

216
00:14:52,884 --> 00:14:55,324
It's time to put up Grandma's portrait.

217
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:59,124
No, not my grandma!

218
00:15:06,104 --> 00:15:08,504
Grandma...

219
00:15:12,604 --> 00:15:13,874
Oh, dear...

220
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:54,884
The last time we were all together was at Ji Hyuk's wedding.

221
00:15:55,114 --> 00:15:57,054
And now, we're all here for her funeral.

222
00:16:02,724 --> 00:16:04,154
Is Dad going to the restroom?

223
00:16:08,324 --> 00:16:12,964
Sang Cheol's taking this hard. He hasn't even had a drink.

224
00:16:14,464 --> 00:16:16,634
She passed so suddenly, without any warning.

225
00:16:17,104 --> 00:16:20,344
- He must be full of regrets. - At least it wasn't like his dad.

226
00:16:20,804 --> 00:16:24,514
This is better than enduring a long illness like his father did.

227
00:16:24,614 --> 00:16:25,984
Hey, this is his mother we're talking about.

228
00:16:26,484 --> 00:16:27,944
How can you compare that to his father?

229
00:16:29,014 --> 00:16:32,054
Not being able to show his mother he got a new job...

230
00:16:32,854 --> 00:16:34,424
must be what's really weighing on him.

231
00:16:35,324 --> 00:16:37,194
He's been the provider all his life, you know?

232
00:16:38,824 --> 00:16:41,494
- See you around. - Yes, see you. I'm heading out.

233
00:16:41,994 --> 00:16:43,564
- All right. - Thank you for coming.

234
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:52,004
Thanks for coming, everyone. Go home. You have work tomorrow.

235
00:16:52,174 --> 00:16:54,904
Yes, of course. Take good care of your father.

236
00:16:55,544 --> 00:16:56,974
And I'm sorry I didn't get to see your mom.

237
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:02,814
Su Bin will collapse at this rate. She won't stop crying.

238
00:17:04,414 --> 00:17:07,954
Ji Hyuk, you see our friends out. I'll go check on Su Bin.

239
00:17:08,084 --> 00:17:09,854
Okay. Make sure she eats, Seong Jae.

240
00:17:10,424 --> 00:17:11,424
- Let's go. - Bye.

241
00:17:13,364 --> 00:17:14,364
All right, let's head out.

242
00:17:21,234 --> 00:17:22,234
Su Bin.

243
00:17:23,104 --> 00:17:24,574
Come on, you should at least have some soup.

244
00:17:27,244 --> 00:17:28,744
I don't have an appetite.

245
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:10,154
What's taking him so long?

246
00:18:11,454 --> 00:18:12,924
He's been gone for a while now.

247
00:18:20,164 --> 00:18:21,524
Where on earth could he have gone?

248
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:32,844
Mom!

249
00:18:35,044 --> 00:18:36,644
Mom...

250
00:18:40,344 --> 00:18:42,144
Mom, I'm sorry.

251
00:18:42,144 --> 00:18:44,284
I'm so sorry...

252
00:18:47,754 --> 00:18:49,324
Mom...

253
00:18:53,664 --> 00:18:54,724
Mom.

254
00:18:57,194 --> 00:18:58,194
Please...

255
00:19:01,364 --> 00:19:04,234
Please. No... This can't be happening.

256
00:19:15,314 --> 00:19:18,254
I'm so sorry, I am!

257
00:19:18,454 --> 00:19:19,484
Sorry...

258
00:19:23,154 --> 00:19:26,024
Mom...

259
00:19:43,844 --> 00:19:45,144
What are you doing just sitting here?

260
00:19:46,314 --> 00:19:47,584
Haven't you found your dad yet?

261
00:19:48,744 --> 00:19:49,914
Seong Jae, my dad...

262
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:53,554
He was saying, "Mom..."

263
00:19:56,754 --> 00:19:59,364
and just sobbing.

264
00:20:02,424 --> 00:20:03,434
What?

265
00:20:03,934 --> 00:20:06,234
I've never seen him sob like that before.

266
00:20:08,604 --> 00:20:09,734
It was so jarring,

267
00:20:11,134 --> 00:20:12,134
and I was just stunned.

268
00:20:14,374 --> 00:20:15,574
Your dad...

269
00:20:16,914 --> 00:20:18,344
was sobbing?

270
00:20:19,014 --> 00:20:20,344
Thinking about it now...

271
00:20:24,384 --> 00:20:25,484
I never realized.

272
00:20:27,554 --> 00:20:30,154
I knew Grandma was my dad's mother,

273
00:20:32,594 --> 00:20:33,964
but the idea that for my dad, Grandma was...

274
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:38,094
what my own mom is to me.

275
00:20:40,004 --> 00:20:41,204
It never even crossed my mind.

276
00:20:43,474 --> 00:20:46,274
When I heard Mom was unconscious and rushed to the ER,

277
00:20:47,604 --> 00:20:49,214
I honestly thought I was going to lose it.

278
00:20:55,414 --> 00:20:57,154
I was terrified I was going to lose her.

279
00:20:59,984 --> 00:21:01,424
All the things I should have done for her...

280
00:21:02,754 --> 00:21:03,824
All my regrets...

281
00:21:06,624 --> 00:21:09,434
My entire life with her flashed before my eyes.

282
00:21:11,264 --> 00:21:12,334
All I could think was, "Not yet."

283
00:21:15,134 --> 00:21:16,134
"It's too soon."

284
00:21:19,004 --> 00:21:20,174
My heart just seized up,

285
00:21:23,414 --> 00:21:25,274
and it felt like all the blood had drained from my face.

286
00:21:32,684 --> 00:21:35,124
My mom's gone, so I can't really know.

287
00:21:39,494 --> 00:21:41,464
But I think I get what you were feeling.

288
00:21:45,264 --> 00:21:46,304
My dad, too...

289
00:21:49,234 --> 00:21:52,134
That's exactly how he must have felt about his own parents.

290
00:21:57,114 --> 00:21:58,114
Only now...

291
00:21:59,644 --> 00:22:00,784
Why is it only now...

292
00:22:02,044 --> 00:22:03,684
that I'm finally getting it?

293
00:22:04,784 --> 00:22:06,224
Honestly, back then,

294
00:22:07,124 --> 00:22:09,494
my father's life was on the line,

295
00:22:10,154 --> 00:22:13,264
so I felt like I couldn't apologize to my own son.

296
00:22:14,724 --> 00:22:15,994
Because if I did,

297
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:19,064
it would've felt like I was blaming my own sick father.

298
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:22,204
It was because of my own father that I made you give up your dream.

299
00:22:22,264 --> 00:22:24,404
Should I beg for your forgiveness?

300
00:22:31,274 --> 00:22:35,214
I wish I'd understood him better, even a little.

301
00:22:52,534 --> 00:22:54,204
I was just on my way down.

302
00:22:55,164 --> 00:22:56,374
I have to ask you something first.

303
00:22:58,004 --> 00:23:00,104
I noticed your car is still parked out front.

304
00:23:02,204 --> 00:23:05,674
Manager Lee Ji Wan will submit his resignation to Dad himself.

305
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:08,814
Finally, you're starting to make sense.

306
00:23:10,454 --> 00:23:12,584
So, when are you meeting with Vice President Lee?

307
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:14,424
Vice President Lee Sang Hoon?

308
00:23:16,154 --> 00:23:17,154
I won't meet him.

309
00:23:18,124 --> 00:23:19,124
What?

310
00:23:20,364 --> 00:23:22,494
Dad already said I didn't have to.

311
00:23:23,734 --> 00:23:26,704
Then just tell him you want to meet. That you changed your mind.

312
00:23:27,204 --> 00:23:28,234
Why should I?

313
00:23:29,604 --> 00:23:30,634
You really don't know?

314
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:32,034
No.

315
00:23:32,874 --> 00:23:35,944
I don't want to see him, so I don't get why I have to.

316
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:43,854
What?

317
00:23:54,094 --> 00:23:55,224
Yeong Ra.

318
00:23:55,864 --> 00:23:58,334
Do you still not feel well?

319
00:23:59,234 --> 00:24:01,464
Then you should go to a doctor. Why are you cooped up at home?

320
00:24:03,104 --> 00:24:04,774
I'm not really sick.

321
00:24:04,974 --> 00:24:06,074
I think I've just got the winter blues.

322
00:24:06,644 --> 00:24:07,974
My studio's a bit chilly.

323
00:24:08,344 --> 00:24:11,714
Well, why did you rent such a cheap place?

324
00:24:12,014 --> 00:24:14,584
Because she treats it like she's just playing house.

325
00:24:15,184 --> 00:24:18,484
Why does she need an office when she lives in this huge house?

326
00:24:18,484 --> 00:24:19,654
It's not like she has a job.

327
00:24:23,324 --> 00:24:24,794
Are you feeling down too, honey?

328
00:24:25,394 --> 00:24:26,924
That doesn't sound like you.

329
00:24:28,594 --> 00:24:31,364
Especially since we launched her career with a solo exhibition.

330
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:35,734
Well, she's the one who said she didn't want to paint anymore.

331
00:24:37,034 --> 00:24:39,034
I might find a new career path there.

332
00:24:39,804 --> 00:24:41,344
Right, of course.

333
00:24:42,404 --> 00:24:45,744
You've been so busy up until now, so take your time and think it over.

334
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:49,514
You should explore your dreams before you get married.

335
00:25:03,064 --> 00:25:06,534
Why does she need an office? She doesn't even have a job.

336
00:25:08,334 --> 00:25:09,674
What does she mean I don't have a job?

337
00:25:10,374 --> 00:25:11,904
She knows perfectly well I'm a webtoon artist.

338
00:25:14,944 --> 00:25:16,214
You're nothing on your own.

339
00:25:16,844 --> 00:25:18,814
You even had a ghost painter.

340
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:20,884
You have nothing that's actually yours.

341
00:25:21,744 --> 00:25:24,154
Wait, you have your webtoon.

342
00:25:24,584 --> 00:25:27,784
But you can't even publish it. So, you're a nobody.

343
00:25:28,354 --> 00:25:29,424
Resign.

344
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:31,724
And give me the car keys.

345
00:25:32,354 --> 00:25:35,164
Let's not see each other again.

346
00:25:38,394 --> 00:25:40,834
He tried so hard for me, and yet...

347
00:25:42,404 --> 00:25:43,874
I shouldn't have been so cruel.

348
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:50,244
And right after that, he heard that his grandmother died.

349
00:25:55,614 --> 00:25:58,214
Looks like Dokgo Chan and So Ri will spend Christmas together.

350
00:25:58,584 --> 00:26:00,184
Where do you think they are now?

351
00:26:01,124 --> 00:26:03,894
They're heading to Busan, so maybe somewhere around Daegu?

352
00:26:04,424 --> 00:26:05,454
Daegu...

353
00:26:06,624 --> 00:26:08,194
I wonder if the malls there are picked clean.

354
00:26:08,594 --> 00:26:11,534
It'd be sweet if they picked out gifts for each other.

355
00:26:12,594 --> 00:26:16,004
Then let's go to a department store on Christmas Eve.

356
00:26:16,304 --> 00:26:17,304
For research, you know.

357
00:26:17,704 --> 00:26:18,774
I can't that day.

358
00:26:19,304 --> 00:26:21,574
I promised my grandma I'd take her to the Nam Hun Ah concert.

359
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:25,774
With your grandma on Christmas Eve? To a concert like that?

360
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:29,044
My grandma's birthday is on Christmas Eve.

361
00:26:29,444 --> 00:26:31,684
And I've never once done anything special for her.

362
00:26:42,494 --> 00:26:43,494
Pretty cool, right?

363
00:26:43,794 --> 00:26:45,594
A grandson taking his grandma to a concert.

364
00:26:50,704 --> 00:26:52,174
It's the other way around.

365
00:26:52,434 --> 00:26:55,744
So for men, when you bow, your right hand goes on top.

366
00:26:56,144 --> 00:26:59,344
And for women, your left hand goes on top.

367
00:27:00,514 --> 00:27:04,054
Next, raise your hands to eye level, and your palms...

368
00:27:07,424 --> 00:27:08,424
Where are you going?

369
00:27:09,324 --> 00:27:10,994
You're dressed all in black.

370
00:27:12,294 --> 00:27:14,924
Ji Wan's grandmother passed away, so I'm going to pay my respects.

371
00:27:15,794 --> 00:27:18,194
What? Why would you go there?

372
00:27:18,734 --> 00:27:19,764
Because I want to.

373
00:27:21,564 --> 00:27:22,564
I'll go with you.

374
00:27:22,934 --> 00:27:24,274
I'll go give them the condolence money.

375
00:27:24,274 --> 00:27:25,304
You stay in the car.

376
00:27:26,874 --> 00:27:30,144
I don't want to just give money. I want to pay my respects properly.

377
00:27:30,644 --> 00:27:33,514
- Bowing and paying my respects. - And why would you do that?

378
00:27:34,484 --> 00:27:37,254
What kind of employer attends an employee's family funeral?

379
00:27:38,214 --> 00:27:40,024
Show some class.

380
00:27:40,724 --> 00:27:42,384
He's not my employee.

381
00:27:42,384 --> 00:27:44,894
He's the one Dad asked to protect me.

382
00:27:45,194 --> 00:27:46,994
And he's the younger brother of one of Seong Jae's friends.

383
00:27:47,964 --> 00:27:49,064
Mom.

384
00:27:49,394 --> 00:27:50,594
You're the one who needs to show some decency.

385
00:27:52,934 --> 00:27:53,934
Hey!

386
00:27:57,734 --> 00:28:00,504
Yeong Ra, don't! That girl...

387
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:44,154
Dad, there are no visitors now. Please get something to eat.

388
00:28:57,994 --> 00:29:01,204
Step before the deceased's portrait to offer a flower.

389
00:29:04,434 --> 00:29:06,074
Dad, hold on.

390
00:29:15,814 --> 00:29:18,514
Then, bow twice,

391
00:29:18,514 --> 00:29:23,024
and silently wish them peace or say your final goodbyes.

392
00:29:32,664 --> 00:29:34,034
Hello, Grandma.

393
00:29:35,434 --> 00:29:37,604
I'm a close friend of Ji Wan's.

394
00:29:39,574 --> 00:29:41,744
May you rest in peace, Grandma.

395
00:29:47,844 --> 00:29:48,944
Ji Wan.

396
00:29:55,684 --> 00:29:59,454
I'm Park Yeong Ra. I'm a friend of Ji Wan's.

397
00:30:00,164 --> 00:30:01,394
A friend, she says.

398
00:30:01,924 --> 00:30:04,134
I'm very sorry for your loss.

399
00:30:04,634 --> 00:30:05,994
Thank you.

400
00:30:06,294 --> 00:30:09,874
So you really do see me as a friend, at least.

401
00:30:24,554 --> 00:30:26,054
How did you get here?

402
00:30:31,524 --> 00:30:34,564
Of course, I should be here. She's my bodyguard's grandmother.

403
00:30:36,264 --> 00:30:37,394
You're very thoughtful.

404
00:30:40,204 --> 00:30:43,574
You must be upset you couldn't take your grandma to the concert.

405
00:30:57,454 --> 00:30:58,884
I'm such a fool.

406
00:30:59,314 --> 00:31:00,824
What did I do for her last birthday...

407
00:31:03,254 --> 00:31:05,024
And the year before that...

408
00:31:06,494 --> 00:31:08,064
Her birthday was only ten days away.

409
00:31:15,304 --> 00:31:18,674
How many grandsons even think about taking their grandma to a concert?

410
00:31:19,904 --> 00:31:21,444
It's like you two went together.

411
00:31:21,974 --> 00:31:23,244
What would you know?

412
00:31:23,644 --> 00:31:25,214
I bet that's what your grandmother thinks.

413
00:31:25,774 --> 00:31:28,884
Now that she's passed, she can read your mind.

414
00:31:29,544 --> 00:31:31,214
She'll be with you in spirit, right?

415
00:31:37,224 --> 00:31:38,924
I really hope so.

416
00:31:45,964 --> 00:31:47,134
Park Yeong Ra.

417
00:31:47,404 --> 00:31:50,404
Wait, did you drive here yourself? Are you out of your mind?

418
00:31:51,434 --> 00:31:53,174
I told you. I can drive.

419
00:31:53,204 --> 00:31:56,274
That stalker is still out there awaiting trial.

420
00:31:56,274 --> 00:31:58,114
Have you lost your mind?

421
00:32:00,214 --> 00:32:01,214
Right.

422
00:32:01,584 --> 00:32:03,414
It's been ages since he showed up, so I'd forgotten.

423
00:32:07,854 --> 00:32:10,794
Besides, I need to start doing this on my own.

424
00:32:11,024 --> 00:32:13,594
Attending a funeral is a big part of being an adult.

425
00:32:14,364 --> 00:32:15,424
Give me the keys.

426
00:32:15,424 --> 00:32:19,234
I'll drive myself. What, are you my bodyguard?

427
00:32:19,864 --> 00:32:24,374
I haven't resigned yet. So, I'm still your bodyguard.

428
00:32:25,574 --> 00:32:27,274
A bodyguard who's at his grandma's funeral.

429
00:32:27,274 --> 00:32:28,674
I don't want to make you drive me home.

430
00:32:32,514 --> 00:32:34,084
You've gotten a lot braver.

431
00:32:35,784 --> 00:32:36,954
I wonder who I have to thank for that.

432
00:32:38,714 --> 00:32:40,254
I'm not scared anymore either.

433
00:32:41,784 --> 00:32:43,254
Not scared at all.

434
00:32:44,524 --> 00:32:45,724
I'm not afraid.

435
00:32:46,964 --> 00:32:48,294
What's that supposed to mean?

436
00:32:49,424 --> 00:32:50,494
Yeong Ra.

437
00:32:51,294 --> 00:32:52,794
You wouldn't know about this, would you?

438
00:32:53,434 --> 00:32:54,864
When there's a warning,

439
00:32:58,134 --> 00:32:59,334
it's easier to defend yourself.

440
00:32:59,734 --> 00:33:00,904
Easier?

441
00:33:01,344 --> 00:33:05,344
How is it easy when you don't know when, where, or what will happen?

442
00:33:06,574 --> 00:33:08,444
She warned me, didn't she?

443
00:33:08,544 --> 00:33:11,554
That she'd arrange a fatal accident that could kill me.

444
00:33:12,184 --> 00:33:13,184
That was the threat.

445
00:33:13,654 --> 00:33:17,054
If that's the case, it lays everything out for me.

446
00:33:18,024 --> 00:33:20,894
The scenarios are predictable, which makes it easy to defend.

447
00:33:23,864 --> 00:33:27,004
You're not scared of my mom?

448
00:33:28,104 --> 00:33:29,364
Director Ko...

449
00:33:29,764 --> 00:33:32,634
She can't tell the Chairman unless I resign first.

450
00:33:33,074 --> 00:33:35,604
And you're afraid your family will be torn apart,

451
00:33:35,604 --> 00:33:37,714
so you can't tell him about Woo Jin's liver transplant.

452
00:33:38,014 --> 00:33:42,044
She has even more to lose. So, we're at a stalemate.

453
00:33:44,284 --> 00:33:45,484
I know that.

454
00:33:45,754 --> 00:33:48,884
So, I'm the wild card here.

455
00:33:50,124 --> 00:33:51,254
But I...

456
00:33:53,324 --> 00:33:54,994
have no intention of backing down.

457
00:33:56,094 --> 00:33:57,764
I'm your bodyguard, aren't I?

458
00:33:58,434 --> 00:34:01,934
And it's not just about stalkers, you know.

459
00:34:05,534 --> 00:34:07,374
It means protecting your life.

460
00:34:08,304 --> 00:34:09,444
At least, for as long as I'm your bodyguard.

461
00:34:14,284 --> 00:34:18,784
Hey, I was a college athlete. I'm not going down that easily.

462
00:34:20,424 --> 00:34:23,754
So, the decision is up to you.

463
00:34:24,294 --> 00:34:27,924
At the very least, that beloved series of yours...

464
00:34:28,294 --> 00:34:29,694
I'll make sure you get to finish it safely.

465
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:31,864
That's all you wanted, right?

466
00:34:36,804 --> 00:34:37,804
Give me the car keys.

467
00:34:45,344 --> 00:34:47,984
Seeing how my grandmother was here yesterday and gone today...

468
00:34:50,414 --> 00:34:52,354
makes me realize you never know when your time is up.

469
00:35:00,494 --> 00:35:01,594
I'm leaving.

470
00:35:09,434 --> 00:35:11,474
You could die on the way home.

471
00:35:27,384 --> 00:35:30,294
Here are today's files. Upload them, and you can go home.

472
00:35:30,424 --> 00:35:31,424
Okay.

473
00:35:40,334 --> 00:35:41,704
She's running a fever.

474
00:35:45,374 --> 00:35:46,904
- Seong Jae. - Hey.

475
00:35:47,104 --> 00:35:49,604
Hey. What are you doing back here?

476
00:35:53,374 --> 00:35:55,384
It's your grandmother's funeral. Of course, I should be here.

477
00:35:56,784 --> 00:35:59,854
In that case, Seong Jae, could you take Su Bin home?

478
00:36:00,154 --> 00:36:03,384
Maybe it's from all the crying, but she has a high fever.

479
00:36:03,724 --> 00:36:05,854
I think she should sleep at home tonight.

480
00:36:07,424 --> 00:36:09,224
Should we get her an IV?

481
00:36:09,724 --> 00:36:10,894
I don't think it's that serious.

482
00:36:12,334 --> 00:36:15,204
I'm just worried she'll keep crying if she stays here.

483
00:36:15,534 --> 00:36:17,304
Just pick up some medicine for her on the way.

484
00:36:19,204 --> 00:36:20,204
All right, got it.

485
00:36:27,984 --> 00:36:29,484
I'm home.

486
00:36:29,884 --> 00:36:30,984
Yeong Ra.

487
00:36:31,754 --> 00:36:33,354
I thought you were going to stay home.

488
00:36:33,984 --> 00:36:35,524
Where are you coming from?

489
00:36:36,584 --> 00:36:40,294
Mr. Lee's grandmother passed away, so I went to the funeral.

490
00:36:40,724 --> 00:36:42,194
Mr. Lee's grandmother?

491
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:47,164
We could've just sent some condolence money. Aren't you cold?

492
00:36:47,564 --> 00:36:48,704
My thoughts exactly.

493
00:36:50,434 --> 00:36:52,674
But he's been protecting me for months.

494
00:36:53,134 --> 00:36:56,004
I felt it was right to go pay my respects in person.

495
00:36:57,474 --> 00:36:58,514
You're right.

496
00:36:59,414 --> 00:37:03,444
- He protects you every day. - And he saved my life.

497
00:37:04,814 --> 00:37:05,914
That's right.

498
00:37:07,624 --> 00:37:09,524
- I'm heading up. - All right.

499
00:37:15,864 --> 00:37:19,194
She went all the way to a funeral for his grandmother, not a parent.

500
00:37:20,964 --> 00:37:23,834
I think she's been spending too much time with him.

501
00:37:25,274 --> 00:37:27,344
So you forgot too.

502
00:37:28,004 --> 00:37:31,044
He is Yeong Ra's lifesaver.

503
00:37:31,474 --> 00:37:34,714
If she'd been abducted that day, who knows what could have happened?

504
00:37:44,794 --> 00:37:46,224
That's right.

505
00:37:46,494 --> 00:37:49,194
Menopause is making me so forgetful. I keep forgetting things.

506
00:37:51,334 --> 00:37:54,064
I was just worried Yeong Ra is losing her class.

507
00:37:54,964 --> 00:37:57,534
After all, their upbringings are so different.

508
00:37:58,904 --> 00:38:00,544
But there are things to be learned from that, too.

509
00:38:00,944 --> 00:38:02,774
She's learned how to look after the people around her.

510
00:38:03,674 --> 00:38:05,514
Yeong Ra has really matured.

511
00:38:25,794 --> 00:38:26,794
Right now,

512
00:38:27,134 --> 00:38:29,634
you might think that what you have is enough.

513
00:38:30,834 --> 00:38:31,834
But listen to me.

514
00:38:32,374 --> 00:38:33,904
If you let this chance with Jinhwa slip away,

515
00:38:34,244 --> 00:38:36,674
you'll never be able to climb any higher than this.

516
00:38:37,844 --> 00:38:41,184
- Mom. - You'll have to marry down, right?

517
00:38:42,184 --> 00:38:44,254
Just imagine taking that one step down.

518
00:38:45,314 --> 00:38:48,524
The kind of pecking order and all the classism you'll face...

519
00:38:49,484 --> 00:38:50,994
I'm telling you, you have no idea.

520
00:38:51,594 --> 00:38:52,894
All that classism and discrimination.

521
00:38:53,924 --> 00:38:55,624
When I married your father,

522
00:38:55,664 --> 00:38:58,434
do you have any idea what I endured, even after we got married?

523
00:39:00,094 --> 00:39:02,704
Dad's family treated you like a gold digger,

524
00:39:03,134 --> 00:39:06,004
and you were shut out and ostracized by the industry.

525
00:39:07,174 --> 00:39:09,174
To be a woman worthy of your father,

526
00:39:09,704 --> 00:39:12,274
I went beyond high school by getting my master's at night,

527
00:39:12,344 --> 00:39:13,914
completed an executive management program,

528
00:39:14,184 --> 00:39:16,514
took English, Japanese, and etiquette classes,

529
00:39:16,514 --> 00:39:18,814
and volunteered at different places. I did everything I possibly could.

530
00:39:19,854 --> 00:39:22,124
Mom, I...

531
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:25,324
I'm fine not marrying into a family on the same level as Jinhwa Group.

532
00:39:25,524 --> 00:39:26,524
Are you out of your mind?

533
00:39:27,464 --> 00:39:30,064
You only get one life. Do you really want to throw it away?

534
00:39:31,534 --> 00:39:32,794
Some guy like Lee Ji Wan?

535
00:39:34,064 --> 00:39:36,564
Do you know what your life would be like...

536
00:39:36,564 --> 00:39:38,074
with a guy like that? With no support at all?

537
00:39:39,074 --> 00:39:42,304
In less than three months, you'll be worried sick about money.

538
00:39:42,904 --> 00:39:45,774
Those clothes you want to buy? You could never afford them.

539
00:39:46,614 --> 00:39:48,884
You'll go to department stores and look at the price tags first.

540
00:39:49,314 --> 00:39:52,114
Actually, you probably won't be able to go to department stores.

541
00:39:53,084 --> 00:39:54,754
You'll be lucky if you can even shop at an outlet.

542
00:39:55,054 --> 00:39:57,294
Makeup, food, art shows, trips...

543
00:39:57,724 --> 00:39:59,154
You'll have to check the price on everything first.

544
00:40:00,394 --> 00:40:03,764
I have absolutely no intention of marrying Mr. Lee Ji Wan.

545
00:40:05,034 --> 00:40:06,264
Lie down with dogs, and you'll get up with fleas.

546
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:08,934
That means, don't even let him near you.

547
00:40:10,164 --> 00:40:12,574
If the wrong rumors start, it will only lower your stock.

548
00:40:13,604 --> 00:40:14,604
Mom.

549
00:40:14,944 --> 00:40:16,974
Please, don't be so dramatic about it.

550
00:40:17,674 --> 00:40:19,674
Ji Wan is just my bodyguard.

551
00:40:20,384 --> 00:40:21,614
You don't need to worry so much.

552
00:40:25,484 --> 00:40:28,324
Even Dad said I did the right thing by going to pay my respects.

553
00:40:28,554 --> 00:40:31,194
I don't even know if we're on the same page right now.

554
00:40:32,194 --> 00:40:33,794
We're going to have to talk about this later.

555
00:40:34,564 --> 00:40:35,564
Okay.

556
00:40:36,624 --> 00:40:38,064
I really have to use the bathroom right now.

557
00:40:45,974 --> 00:40:48,074
So this guy is pretty capable.

558
00:40:49,144 --> 00:40:50,674
He's the problem.

559
00:40:53,344 --> 00:40:54,944
All right. I see.

560
00:40:55,944 --> 00:40:57,044
You two...

561
00:40:57,984 --> 00:40:59,314
I'll take you both out in one shot.

562
00:41:00,554 --> 00:41:02,784
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

563
00:41:03,124 --> 00:41:04,194
What do you want to eat?

564
00:41:04,554 --> 00:41:06,724
The porridge.

565
00:41:07,894 --> 00:41:11,594
I wish he'd brought more of it. You enjoy it so much.

566
00:41:12,294 --> 00:41:14,904
He said he learned how to make it from his grandmother.

567
00:41:16,704 --> 00:41:19,834
Once you're done, it'll be all gone, so I'll make you some.

568
00:41:20,174 --> 00:41:22,674
Gosh, it's okay. I don't need to eat porridge anymore.

569
00:41:24,244 --> 00:41:26,844
All right. I'll make you lots of other delicious food.

570
00:41:27,484 --> 00:41:29,314
Okay, go on and eat your porridge.

571
00:41:29,814 --> 00:41:30,984
Yes, okay.

572
00:41:44,334 --> 00:41:45,334
Hey, Su Jeong.

573
00:41:45,864 --> 00:41:46,964
How are you feeling?

574
00:41:48,404 --> 00:41:49,934
I'm recovering well.

575
00:41:50,474 --> 00:41:51,474
That's a relief.

576
00:41:53,034 --> 00:41:54,804
What's this? Just calling to check on me?

577
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:56,374
Or are you bored...

578
00:41:56,544 --> 00:41:58,014
and just want to chat?

579
00:41:59,144 --> 00:42:00,244
Actually...

580
00:42:00,914 --> 00:42:03,714
Ji Hyuk told me not to tell you,

581
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:05,954
but I think you need to know.

582
00:42:06,514 --> 00:42:08,784
Ji Hyuk's grandmother passed away.

583
00:42:13,454 --> 00:42:15,494
What? His grandmother?

584
00:42:16,694 --> 00:42:17,694
What happened all of a sudden?

585
00:42:24,574 --> 00:42:25,674
I see.

586
00:42:27,674 --> 00:42:28,774
Where's the funeral home?

587
00:42:29,904 --> 00:42:33,014
Don't even think about it. Ji Hyuk will kill me if you go.

588
00:42:36,544 --> 00:42:38,054
Just send him a text with your condolences.

589
00:42:38,784 --> 00:42:39,784
Get some rest, Eun Oh.

590
00:42:48,294 --> 00:42:49,324
Ji Hyuk...

591
00:42:49,824 --> 00:42:51,864
He lived with his grandmother for so long...

592
00:43:17,594 --> 00:43:19,054
Wait, is that Eun Oh?

593
00:43:20,294 --> 00:43:21,464
Oh, it's her.

594
00:43:22,324 --> 00:43:23,934
What is she doing here?

595
00:43:25,064 --> 00:43:26,894
(CEO Lee Ji Hyuk)

596
00:43:28,134 --> 00:43:29,134
Eun Oh.

597
00:43:30,574 --> 00:43:32,034
Why don't you ever listen?

598
00:43:32,534 --> 00:43:34,804
Are you in any condition to be paying respects?

599
00:43:35,204 --> 00:43:37,874
You must still have stomach pains. Why would you come all this way?

600
00:43:38,644 --> 00:43:39,714
Who told you?

601
00:43:40,114 --> 00:43:41,514
I specifically told them not to tell you.

602
00:43:42,444 --> 00:43:44,254
Gosh, you're really giving me an earful.

603
00:43:45,254 --> 00:43:46,254
What?

604
00:43:49,184 --> 00:43:50,284
Here, just take this.

605
00:43:52,124 --> 00:43:53,254
What's this?

606
00:43:53,894 --> 00:43:55,224
It's your grandmother's porridge.

607
00:43:55,864 --> 00:43:57,534
The one you brought me when I was in the hospital.

608
00:43:58,734 --> 00:44:00,134
You learned how to make it from your grandmother...

609
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,164
and brought it to me, remember?

610
00:44:03,234 --> 00:44:05,574
Wait, you still had some of this left?

611
00:44:06,334 --> 00:44:07,974
You brought me so much...

612
00:44:08,274 --> 00:44:10,974
that my mom froze it in single-serving portions.

613
00:44:11,814 --> 00:44:14,114
I checked today, and there was one serving left.

614
00:44:15,414 --> 00:44:17,314
But since it was your grandmother's porridge,

615
00:44:18,414 --> 00:44:20,684
I thought it would be best if you ate the last one.

616
00:44:22,284 --> 00:44:23,784
You haven't been eating, have you?

617
00:44:25,394 --> 00:44:26,394
This...

618
00:44:29,764 --> 00:44:31,294
I made this batch with my grandmother.

619
00:44:33,394 --> 00:44:34,404
She nagged me the whole time.

620
00:44:37,264 --> 00:44:38,774
Nagged you? Why?

621
00:44:39,704 --> 00:44:40,944
She was teaching me,

622
00:44:43,104 --> 00:44:44,314
and I was the one who was supposed to cook.

623
00:44:46,244 --> 00:44:47,914
But she ended up mincing the abalone...

624
00:44:50,314 --> 00:44:51,484
and the beef too.

625
00:44:54,454 --> 00:44:55,524
She even checked the seasoning for me.

626
00:45:00,024 --> 00:45:01,624
Because I'm useless at mincing things like abalone,

627
00:45:02,494 --> 00:45:03,624
and I can't season to save my life.

628
00:45:08,704 --> 00:45:10,564
So it really was her porridge after all.

629
00:45:11,634 --> 00:45:12,934
No wonder it tasted so good.

630
00:45:17,814 --> 00:45:19,074
Hurry and eat it while it's warm.

631
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:23,514
May your grandmother rest in peace.

632
00:45:25,184 --> 00:45:26,184
Eun Oh.

633
00:45:29,554 --> 00:45:30,954
Just for a little while, while I eat this...

634
00:45:32,554 --> 00:45:33,754
Can you stay here with me?

635
00:45:57,914 --> 00:45:58,954
It's really good.

636
00:46:29,014 --> 00:46:30,014
Su Bin.

637
00:46:30,514 --> 00:46:31,514
Let's go home.

638
00:46:37,424 --> 00:46:38,424
Su Bin.

639
00:46:41,064 --> 00:46:42,394
Grandma...

640
00:46:43,394 --> 00:46:45,134
You made her so happy.

641
00:46:47,464 --> 00:46:50,104
She had such a fun time appearing on your YouTube channel,

642
00:46:51,474 --> 00:46:53,374
and she even got to debut as a model because of it.

643
00:46:55,444 --> 00:46:57,104
Plus, all your subscribers loved her so much.

644
00:47:04,044 --> 00:47:05,214
You know what they say?

645
00:47:07,284 --> 00:47:08,324
If you cry too much,

646
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,624
they say the person who passed can't move on.

647
00:47:15,394 --> 00:47:16,394
Really?

648
00:47:17,394 --> 00:47:18,394
Yes.

649
00:47:19,794 --> 00:47:21,604
So for your grandmother's sake,

650
00:47:22,534 --> 00:47:23,534
try to stop crying.

651
00:47:37,954 --> 00:47:38,954
Su Bin?

652
00:48:06,014 --> 00:48:07,014
Su Bin.

653
00:48:07,344 --> 00:48:09,044
If you wake up, take more medicine and go back to sleep.

654
00:48:09,914 --> 00:48:11,114
I'll come get you early tomorrow morning.

655
00:48:54,124 --> 00:48:55,194
Seong Jae.

656
00:48:56,024 --> 00:48:57,024
Seong Jae.

657
00:48:59,664 --> 00:49:00,904
Hey, Su Bin.

658
00:49:01,734 --> 00:49:02,734
You're awake?

659
00:49:04,064 --> 00:49:05,104
How are you feeling?

660
00:49:06,074 --> 00:49:09,104
Seong Jae. What are you doing sleeping here?

661
00:49:10,744 --> 00:49:11,744
I was waiting for you to wake up...

662
00:49:12,114 --> 00:49:14,544
to give you your medicine and make sure your fever broke.

663
00:49:19,684 --> 00:49:21,984
It's gone down a little, at least.

664
00:49:23,724 --> 00:49:26,754
They said to take another dose. Just a second.

665
00:49:29,464 --> 00:49:30,464
Oh, boy.

666
00:49:34,534 --> 00:49:35,534
Here.

667
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:40,434
Thanks, Seong Jae.

668
00:49:43,874 --> 00:49:45,814
I'll be sleeping in Ji Hyuk's room,

669
00:49:46,514 --> 00:49:48,544
so you should change into pajamas and get some rest.

670
00:49:49,644 --> 00:49:51,314
You're going to sleep in Ji Hyuk's room?

671
00:49:52,854 --> 00:49:55,684
I couldn't just leave you here while you're sick.

672
00:49:56,854 --> 00:49:59,954
Call me if you feel any worse at all, okay?

673
00:50:01,294 --> 00:50:02,294
Okay.

674
00:50:04,024 --> 00:50:05,034
Make sure you take your medicine.

675
00:51:01,284 --> 00:51:02,284
All right.

676
00:51:02,924 --> 00:51:04,494
You've all been through so much.

677
00:51:05,094 --> 00:51:06,954
Su Bin, go take your medicine and lie down.

678
00:51:09,894 --> 00:51:13,764
Mom, you should go rest. Ji Wan, can you get her bed ready?

679
00:51:13,894 --> 00:51:15,664
- Okay. - All right, Ji Wan.

680
00:51:15,934 --> 00:51:17,804
Just get my bed ready, then you get some rest, too.

681
00:51:18,634 --> 00:51:20,374
I think I'll go to Grandma's room for a minute.

682
00:51:21,004 --> 00:51:22,874
Mom, why don't you rest first?

683
00:51:23,504 --> 00:51:27,214
I'll take care of your mom, so you all go get some rest.

684
00:51:27,984 --> 00:51:29,784
Hey, didn't you say you have to go into work?

685
00:51:30,184 --> 00:51:32,684
I'll hold down the fort, so don't worry. Just go.

686
00:51:35,184 --> 00:51:36,854
All right. I'm counting on you.

687
00:51:38,194 --> 00:51:39,194
I'm heading out now.

688
00:51:43,894 --> 00:51:46,764
Poor kid. He must be exhausted.

689
00:52:11,824 --> 00:52:13,194
I still can't believe it.

690
00:52:14,624 --> 00:52:16,424
That she's gone just like that.

691
00:52:21,364 --> 00:52:24,104
Mother...

692
00:52:25,834 --> 00:52:27,534
Because of the lingering effects of the car accident,

693
00:52:28,144 --> 00:52:31,214
I thought it was a blessing you couldn't be at the funeral home.

694
00:52:33,644 --> 00:52:36,714
I never should have gone shopping with her.

695
00:52:39,354 --> 00:52:40,884
I'm such a fool.

696
00:52:43,584 --> 00:52:48,094
Don't think she died in an accident because you two went shopping.

697
00:52:48,964 --> 00:52:51,394
Think that she gave us what she truly wanted to give...

698
00:52:51,834 --> 00:52:54,064
before she left us. Okay?

699
00:52:58,934 --> 00:53:01,004
But she left us so suddenly.

700
00:53:02,844 --> 00:53:04,674
You can really think of it that way?

701
00:53:06,244 --> 00:53:07,644
Aren't you resentful?

702
00:53:10,244 --> 00:53:14,214
When she gave me her first modeling paycheck,

703
00:53:15,054 --> 00:53:16,054
she said it felt like a spring day.

704
00:53:18,724 --> 00:53:20,424
So then...

705
00:53:22,464 --> 00:53:25,594
Why did she have to leave on a spring day of all days?

706
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:32,734
I'm glad she got to see a spring day before she passed.

707
00:53:35,274 --> 00:53:36,744
That's enough.

708
00:53:55,594 --> 00:53:58,034
You just never know when your time is up.

709
00:54:07,334 --> 00:54:09,074
I have your new work schedule ready for you.

710
00:54:11,744 --> 00:54:12,744
What?

711
00:54:22,484 --> 00:54:23,484
Honey.

712
00:54:24,224 --> 00:54:25,254
I'm off to work.

713
00:54:25,854 --> 00:54:27,224
Okay. Have a good day.

714
00:54:40,074 --> 00:54:41,074
Where are you going?

715
00:54:42,874 --> 00:54:43,874
To my studio.

716
00:54:45,344 --> 00:54:46,344
Your studio?

717
00:54:46,644 --> 00:54:49,614
Feel free to drop by whenever. The address is on the invitation.

718
00:54:54,054 --> 00:54:55,654
And it'd be even better if you brought Dad with you.

719
00:55:00,124 --> 00:55:02,794
That driver has some nerve, trying to pull a fast one.

720
00:55:05,464 --> 00:55:07,264
They have no idea who they're dealing with.

721
00:55:26,514 --> 00:55:27,514
Reporting for duty.

722
00:55:34,994 --> 00:55:35,994
Let's head to the studio.

723
00:55:42,334 --> 00:55:44,734
I love the smell of my studio.

724
00:55:46,404 --> 00:55:48,374
Gosh, you mean the smell of mold?

725
00:55:48,904 --> 00:55:51,674
It's not like you could air the place out.

726
00:55:52,314 --> 00:55:54,814
I never thought I'd be back here again.

727
00:55:56,144 --> 00:55:57,144
This feels so good.

728
00:55:58,014 --> 00:55:59,014
I'm happy too.

729
00:55:59,784 --> 00:56:01,754
Hello, my desk. Good to see you again!

730
00:56:04,124 --> 00:56:07,024
But are you really not scared?

731
00:56:07,324 --> 00:56:09,794
No. I told you. I've got it all figured out.

732
00:56:11,194 --> 00:56:12,734
Then tell me the details.

733
00:56:13,334 --> 00:56:14,804
So I can stop worrying.

734
00:56:15,464 --> 00:56:16,464
Delivery!

735
00:56:21,604 --> 00:56:24,974
Pepper spray, a taser,

736
00:56:25,244 --> 00:56:27,444
and a collapsible baton.

737
00:56:28,784 --> 00:56:30,914
My gosh, what is all this?

738
00:56:31,184 --> 00:56:32,284
Our first line of defense.

739
00:56:35,884 --> 00:56:38,294
We'll be unstoppable with these three.

740
00:56:39,994 --> 00:56:41,894
I should give Dokgo Chan one of these batons.

741
00:56:44,224 --> 00:56:45,234
Seriously?

742
00:56:46,634 --> 00:56:48,464
Everything's about your webtoon with you.

743
00:56:50,504 --> 00:56:53,874
Yeong Ra, I'll teach you self-defense.

744
00:56:54,474 --> 00:56:55,504
Self-defense?

745
00:56:57,674 --> 00:56:59,944
You mean like the kind Dokgo Chan taught So Ri?

746
00:57:00,114 --> 00:57:03,514
Exactly. If you can master just a few of those moves,

747
00:57:03,584 --> 00:57:05,884
whether it's a random attacker or some stalker,

748
00:57:06,284 --> 00:57:07,584
you'll be able to take them down yourself.

749
00:57:09,784 --> 00:57:11,394
Okay, I'm in. Teach me.

750
00:57:11,694 --> 00:57:13,124
Okay, I'll start teaching you tomorrow.

751
00:57:14,254 --> 00:57:15,324
Not tomorrow.

752
00:57:15,624 --> 00:57:17,564
I'll learn after I'm done with my current series.

753
00:57:17,994 --> 00:57:19,334
I'm a little behind right now.

754
00:57:19,934 --> 00:57:20,994
By then...

755
00:57:21,634 --> 00:57:22,904
I won't have time.

756
00:57:24,004 --> 00:57:27,234
- Why not? - I have to move on with my life.

757
00:57:28,004 --> 00:57:31,574
I told you I'd protect you until you finish this series, right?

758
00:57:32,174 --> 00:57:35,514
And you asked your mom to let you finish this one series.

759
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:38,514
So after that, my job here is done, isn't it?

760
00:57:41,114 --> 00:57:42,484
Yes, but...

761
00:57:44,384 --> 00:57:45,794
So what are you going to do?

762
00:57:47,894 --> 00:57:48,894
I'm going to...

763
00:57:52,994 --> 00:57:53,994
This.

764

(Bodyguarding, Past Exam Questions Workbook)

765
00:57:55,564 --> 00:57:56,604
Bodyguarding?

766
00:57:56,864 --> 00:58:00,434
There's this top security firm in the country.

767
00:58:00,834 --> 00:58:03,344
I'll get a job there. That's why I'm studying for the certification.

768
00:58:04,974 --> 00:58:05,974
What about me, then?

769
00:58:06,314 --> 00:58:09,384
You silly goose. Once that stalker is behind bars,

770
00:58:09,484 --> 00:58:12,784
- you won't need a bodyguard. - No, that's not what I meant.

771
00:58:13,814 --> 00:58:15,424
After I finish this series,

772
00:58:15,824 --> 00:58:18,224
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

773
00:58:18,924 --> 00:58:20,724
That's for you to decide.

774
00:58:21,594 --> 00:58:23,994
You asked your mom to let you finish this series.

775
00:58:24,594 --> 00:58:25,664
Doesn't that mean...

776
00:58:25,994 --> 00:58:27,834
you don't plan to continue as a webtoon artist?

777
00:58:29,264 --> 00:58:30,334
That's...

778
00:58:31,474 --> 00:58:34,274
I said that because I thought I couldn't be a webtoon artist.

779
00:58:35,344 --> 00:58:37,144
Dad would obviously be against it anyway.

780
00:58:38,104 --> 00:58:39,144
Right.

781
00:58:39,514 --> 00:58:41,144
If it's too hard to go against your dad's wishes,

782
00:58:41,714 --> 00:58:43,444
then maybe you should just do what he says this time.

783
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:45,914
Ji Wan.

784
00:58:46,514 --> 00:58:48,284
Why are you talking to me like we're strangers?

785
00:58:50,154 --> 00:58:53,224
In your life, everyone but you is a stranger.

786
00:58:53,654 --> 00:58:55,964
And in my life, everyone but me is a stranger.

(Jamun Medical Devices)

788
00:59:04,234 --> 00:59:05,304
Welcome.

789
00:59:05,804 --> 00:59:07,104
Can I look around?

790
00:59:07,504 --> 00:59:08,504
Of course.

791
00:59:09,174 --> 00:59:11,974
Would you like a brochure to start? Yes, right this way.

792
00:59:15,944 --> 00:59:17,444
You can look over this for now.

793
00:59:17,784 --> 00:59:19,484
- Thank you. - Hello...

794
00:59:21,014 --> 00:59:22,024
Ji Hyuk.

795
00:59:22,784 --> 00:59:23,784
Mom.

796
00:59:24,754 --> 00:59:26,194
What are you doing here?

797
00:59:27,024 --> 00:59:29,164
I thought we could go home a little early today.

798
00:59:29,794 --> 00:59:31,864
How are you feeling, Mom?

799
00:59:33,134 --> 00:59:36,004
I'm fine. It's your father I'm worried about.

800
00:59:36,804 --> 00:59:39,704
What's wrong with Dad? Is he sick?

801
00:59:40,334 --> 00:59:42,004
He's just been lying in bed all day.

802
00:59:42,974 --> 00:59:46,844
I prepared the sauce for his noodles and just told Su Bin to boil them,

803
00:59:47,174 --> 00:59:48,784
but I heard he barely ate.

804
00:59:49,814 --> 00:59:51,584
He's still taking Grandma's death really hard.

805
00:59:53,814 --> 00:59:55,724
It's more than that. He's been strong for the family,

806
00:59:55,984 --> 00:59:57,524
and Grandma was a huge source of his strength.

807
00:59:58,994 --> 01:00:00,654
But now that she's gone,

808
01:00:01,424 --> 01:00:02,694
the burden he's carried since leaving his job...

809
01:00:02,694 --> 01:00:03,964
has finally crushed him.

810
01:00:05,094 --> 01:00:06,094
I guess so.

811
01:00:07,194 --> 01:00:11,164
In that case, should we pick up his favorite jokbal?

812
01:00:12,604 --> 01:00:13,634
Should we do that?

813
01:00:17,304 --> 01:00:18,314
Mom.

815
01:00:20,614 --> 01:00:22,044
He's still not awake.

816
01:00:22,414 --> 01:00:24,714
What? He's still sleeping?

817
01:00:26,114 --> 01:00:28,524
I've never seen him like this in my entire life.

818
01:00:33,124 --> 01:00:35,064

820
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:41,804
- Where are you going? - To the bathroom.

821
01:00:42,634 --> 01:00:45,974
Dad, I got jokbal from your favorite place.

822
01:00:47,034 --> 01:00:49,144
You and your mom enjoy it. I don't have an appetite.

823
01:00:49,304 --> 01:00:50,604
Dad, then how about...

824
01:00:50,944 --> 01:00:53,374
we grab a drink together at Uncle Yeong Bo's diner?

825
01:00:54,114 --> 01:00:55,384
No, I'm good.

It wasn't easy getting your number, Ji Hyuk.

I'm back in Korea.

830
01:01:23,274 --> 01:01:26,114
I'm texting because I have something to say in person.

I'm actually in your neighborhood right now.

Come to the cafe down the street.

834
01:01:37,884 --> 01:01:40,424
If you can't make it today, I'll wait for you tomorrow.

835
01:01:42,794 --> 01:01:44,594
I'll keep waiting until you agree to meet me.

836
01:01:46,094 --> 01:01:48,234
She's crazy. What is this about?

837
01:01:57,244 --> 01:01:58,344
What is this all about?

838
01:01:59,344 --> 01:02:02,884
- I'm sorry. Please, sit. - I'm not staying. What do you want?

839
01:02:03,514 --> 01:02:05,184
You've got some nerve, Jung Bo A.

840
01:02:06,114 --> 01:02:09,084
Why were you so insistent on meeting when I told you to just text me?

841
01:02:10,684 --> 01:02:11,754
Well...

842
01:02:12,454 --> 01:02:14,654
I came because my conscience wouldn't let me rest.

843
01:02:15,094 --> 01:02:16,094
Your conscience?

844
01:02:17,224 --> 01:02:19,394
I am so sorry.

845
01:02:19,964 --> 01:02:21,064
I'm really sorry.

846
01:02:21,594 --> 01:02:22,934
This was all in the past.

847
01:02:23,464 --> 01:02:25,034
Why would you show up now and act like this?

848
01:02:26,204 --> 01:02:29,074
I didn't know my father was capable of that.

849
01:02:30,174 --> 01:02:32,844
That he would do something like that to your parents...

850
01:02:32,914 --> 01:02:35,544
I never would have imagined it in my wildest dreams.

851
01:02:37,684 --> 01:02:38,854
Something like what?

852
01:02:40,254 --> 01:02:41,924
I didn't know what was going on when I told you...

853
01:02:42,424 --> 01:02:45,554
to get a big settlement from us. But forget a settlement.

After my father did something so disrespectful,

855
01:02:48,394 --> 01:02:49,824
why didn't you tell me?

856
01:02:50,824 --> 01:02:51,864
What are you talking about?

857
01:02:52,494 --> 01:02:53,734
What? Just tell me.

858
01:02:55,264 --> 01:02:56,264
Wait, don't tell me...

859
01:02:56,904 --> 01:02:58,204
You really don't know?

860
01:03:46,854 --> 01:03:47,884
Dad.

861
01:03:51,354 --> 01:03:52,454
I was wrong.

862
01:03:55,694 --> 01:03:57,124
I was so completely wrong.

863
01:04:00,234 --> 01:04:01,334
I am so sorry.

What a clueless fool. Those two are headed for trouble.

Eun Oh really took the money?

868
01:04:59,794 --> 01:05:02,164
How was I supposed to tell you that they humiliated me?

869
01:05:02,164 --> 01:05:03,294
How was I supposed to bring it up?

870
01:05:03,364 --> 01:05:06,364
You were bound to be hurt even more. You foolish kid.

you're the only one for me, for as long as I live.
