(Episode 31)

2
00:00:08,138 --> 00:00:09,568
There are some red flags.

3
00:00:09,838 --> 00:00:10,968
You got the commission in the spring.

4
00:00:11,968 --> 00:00:14,268
And she's been getting close to you all this time.

5
00:00:18,108 --> 00:00:20,408
What if I told you...

6
00:00:21,048 --> 00:00:22,848
my own buried secret?

7
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:25,918
I have a daughter I lost.

8
00:00:25,918 --> 00:00:27,288
What if they didn't abandon you,

9
00:00:27,988 --> 00:00:29,658
but lost you instead?

10
00:00:29,658 --> 00:00:31,758
No. This is impossible.

11
00:00:31,758 --> 00:00:32,888
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:33,758 --> 00:00:35,328
You were right in front of me, and I didn't even recognize you.

13
00:00:37,358 --> 00:00:38,868
I should have looked harder.

14
00:00:40,298 --> 00:00:42,138
She knew who I was from the very beginning.

15
00:00:43,398 --> 00:00:44,598
She knew all along.

00:00:57,978 --> 00:01:00,648
(Gaon Foundation)

17
00:01:01,758 --> 00:01:03,318
So she approached me on purpose?

18
00:01:04,018 --> 00:01:05,858
She tricked me for the liver transplant.

19
00:01:06,328 --> 00:01:07,428
I won't let her get away with this.

20
00:01:12,598 --> 00:01:14,198
If you save your brother,

21
00:01:14,628 --> 00:01:16,868
the three of us can make up for all the lost time.

22
00:01:17,338 --> 00:01:18,538
Let's live together.

23
00:01:19,468 --> 00:01:20,468
I'm...

24
00:01:22,038 --> 00:01:23,178
getting a divorce.

25
00:01:24,338 --> 00:01:25,678
I'll do the liver transplant.

26
00:01:26,778 --> 00:01:28,248
I'll save my brother.

27
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:34,118
So that's who she really is.

28
00:01:35,918 --> 00:01:37,558
To think she'd go to such lengths.

29
00:01:46,368 --> 00:01:50,438
(Gaon Foundation)

30
00:01:50,638 --> 00:01:52,838
Yeong Ra's engagement party will be on Christmas Eve?

31
00:01:54,308 --> 00:01:56,138
That sounds perfect.

32
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:57,438
(Director Ko Seong Hui)

33
00:01:57,508 --> 00:02:00,248
Yes, ma'am. I'll let Yeong Ra know.

34
00:02:01,818 --> 00:02:02,878
Okay.

35
00:02:07,218 --> 00:02:08,718
With Woo Jin's situation resolved,

36
00:02:08,718 --> 00:02:10,258
things are going well for Yeong Ra too.

37
00:02:14,858 --> 00:02:16,258
(Seong Jae's Matchmaker)

38
00:02:17,258 --> 00:02:18,268
Hello?

39
00:02:24,538 --> 00:02:25,838
Seong Jae really said that?

40
00:02:27,338 --> 00:02:28,908
Oh, no.

41
00:02:31,038 --> 00:02:33,308
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

42
00:02:34,918 --> 00:02:38,548
I should be on cloud nine, but my sister just had to ruin it.

43
00:02:38,788 --> 00:02:43,188
How can you say that? From her perspective, she's right.

44
00:02:44,018 --> 00:02:47,328
No. I'm rethinking our relationship.

45
00:02:48,698 --> 00:02:52,368
She's making me question my whole stance on blood ties.

46
00:02:53,268 --> 00:02:54,728
Don't say things you don't mean.

47
00:02:55,338 --> 00:02:56,638
It's just so frustrating.

48
00:02:57,398 --> 00:02:59,938
Mom, I contacted HQ about your recipe.

49
00:02:59,938 --> 00:03:01,208
See? I am useful too.

50
00:03:01,608 --> 00:03:04,878
What? We can't manage without her? If she wants to go, let her.

51
00:03:06,608 --> 00:03:07,648
What do you mean, "go?"

52
00:03:09,478 --> 00:03:11,178
Is Eun Oh going to live with her birth mother?

53
00:03:12,388 --> 00:03:14,448
No, it's just an expression.

54
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:22,428
I have a lot of work, so I'm pulling an all-nighter.

55
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:25,628
- Make sure Mom gets home safe. - She says she's working all night.

56
00:03:28,768 --> 00:03:31,268
- She is? - She must be really swamped.

57
00:03:31,638 --> 00:03:32,808
It's not like this is her first all-nighter.

58
00:03:37,908 --> 00:03:41,278
She didn't call me. She texted Gang Oh instead.

59
00:03:42,378 --> 00:03:44,248
She's already pulling away from me.

60
00:03:44,918 --> 00:03:46,388
Is Eun Oh planning on leaving me?

61
00:03:47,248 --> 00:03:48,588
Is that why she's acting this way?

62
00:03:49,088 --> 00:03:50,088
What?

63
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:53,428
Because you raised her for 20 years, you think you're her real mother?

64
00:03:53,758 --> 00:03:56,528
I am her birth mother.

65
00:03:56,898 --> 00:03:59,228
Do you even know where Eun Oh and I stand right now?

66
00:04:02,668 --> 00:04:05,508
I can't send Eun Oh to a woman like that.

67
00:04:10,808 --> 00:04:12,078
(Choi Yun Seon)

68
00:04:14,478 --> 00:04:15,748
Yun Seon.

69
00:04:24,758 --> 00:04:27,658
What's the good news that made you call Yeong Ra over?

70
00:04:28,728 --> 00:04:30,928
Because the good news is for Yeong Ra.

71
00:04:31,428 --> 00:04:35,398
I was going to tell Yeong Ra first, but I wanted you both to hear it.

72
00:04:35,598 --> 00:04:37,398
So I waited for you to come home.

73
00:04:38,838 --> 00:04:40,208
What is it, Mom?

74
00:04:42,538 --> 00:04:45,078
An engagement on Christmas Eve. How lovely is that?

75
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:46,878
They called today.

76
00:04:48,148 --> 00:04:49,648
On Christmas Eve?

77
00:04:51,078 --> 00:04:52,548
That's a lovely date, Yeong Ra.

78
00:04:54,318 --> 00:04:55,518
I don't want to do it.

79
00:04:57,018 --> 00:04:59,028
What? What's wrong with Christmas Eve?

80
00:05:01,388 --> 00:05:02,398
It's just...

81
00:05:05,998 --> 00:05:07,628
Dad, I don't want to get engaged.

82
00:05:08,438 --> 00:05:11,168
- My gosh, Yeong Ra... - And I don't want to get married.

83
00:05:11,938 --> 00:05:13,368
Hey, what is this nonsense?

84
00:05:13,538 --> 00:05:14,768
What do you mean, you don't want to get married?

85
00:05:16,178 --> 00:05:17,208
With him...

86
00:05:17,778 --> 00:05:19,478
I can't even kiss him.

87
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:20,778
What?

88
00:05:26,718 --> 00:05:28,288
Gosh, she's so naive.

89
00:05:28,858 --> 00:05:32,728
- You haven't kissed him yet? - They've only met a few times.

90
00:05:34,228 --> 00:05:37,198
Just looking at his lips gives me the creeps.

91
00:05:38,028 --> 00:05:39,428
I can never, ever kiss him.

92
00:05:41,228 --> 00:05:44,038
- You and I need to have a talk. - Just stay out of this for now.

93
00:05:47,568 --> 00:05:50,078
Well... It looks like they just had a little fight.

94
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:53,508
It's best if she talks to her mother about these things first.

95
00:05:53,808 --> 00:05:56,618
The problem isn't a fight. She can't stand him touching her.

96
00:05:56,978 --> 00:05:58,488
Then what's the point of an engagement party?

97
00:05:59,748 --> 00:06:00,748
Yeong Ra.

98
00:06:01,858 --> 00:06:04,088
I'm going to ask you again.

99
00:06:05,758 --> 00:06:06,758
You...

100
00:06:08,358 --> 00:06:11,058
You liked Jinhwa Pharmaceuticals' Vice President Lee, didn't you?

101
00:06:12,398 --> 00:06:15,438
If I say I didn't like him, Mom will never let it go.

102
00:06:17,538 --> 00:06:19,038
I did, but...

103
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:23,878
when I held his hand, it was all clammy and gross,

104
00:06:24,508 --> 00:06:26,278
so then I thought about kissing him,

105
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,118
and I realized there's absolutely no way I could.

106
00:06:30,048 --> 00:06:32,788
Then of course, you can't. Call off the engagement.

107
00:06:34,748 --> 00:06:39,528
- But we've already agreed. - Just say we're postponing it.

108
00:06:40,888 --> 00:06:43,998
Besides, what's the rush? Yeong Ra is young and beautiful.

109
00:06:44,598 --> 00:06:47,198
And you said Seong Jae should marry first.

110
00:06:49,238 --> 00:06:50,598
Okay, fine.

111
00:06:51,268 --> 00:06:53,268
I'll take care of it.

112
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:55,278
Just as I thought.

113
00:06:55,538 --> 00:06:57,738
Mom can never win against Dad, can she?

114
00:07:14,758 --> 00:07:17,558
You little thing! How dare you talk to your dad first?

115
00:07:19,668 --> 00:07:20,728
I'm sorry.

116
00:07:21,568 --> 00:07:23,238
I had no other choice.

117
00:07:23,968 --> 00:07:27,068
No, that was completely out of line.

118
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:29,878
What kind of stunt were you trying to pull?

119
00:07:30,978 --> 00:07:31,978
I'm sorry.

120
00:07:38,788 --> 00:07:40,488
You may not get engaged this time, but I'll make sure...

121
00:07:42,058 --> 00:07:43,858
you marry into the Jinhwa Pharmaceuticals family.

122
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,728
So pull yourself together and get your head on straight.

123
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,578
Of course, Mom wouldn't give up that easily.

124
00:08:04,278 --> 00:08:05,548
I knew she'd be like this.

125
00:08:08,348 --> 00:08:10,148
I have to find a way out of this, and fast.

126
00:08:23,028 --> 00:08:24,158
What's gotten into you?

127
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:27,668
Judging by Yeong Ra's reaction, she clearly never liked him at all.

128
00:08:28,768 --> 00:08:30,798
Doesn't Yeong Ra discuss everything with you...

129
00:08:31,098 --> 00:08:32,938
and tell you every little detail?

130
00:08:34,968 --> 00:08:37,738
I guess I raised Yeong Ra to be too obedient.

131
00:08:38,338 --> 00:08:42,778
I kept saying he was a catch, so she must've thought it was fine.

132
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:46,548
She said she liked him, so I just took her at her word.

133
00:08:47,788 --> 00:08:49,458
Were you just being greedy for that Jinhwa Group connection?

134
00:08:50,358 --> 00:08:51,358
What?

135
00:08:54,128 --> 00:08:55,188
I guess I was.

136
00:08:55,998 --> 00:08:58,458
No, I was greedy.

137
00:08:58,998 --> 00:09:03,498
I thought, "It would be so wonderful if she married into Jinhwa Group."

138
00:09:08,008 --> 00:09:10,078
I can understand feeling that way as a mother,

139
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:13,008
but no matter what, Yeong Ra's feelings come first.

140
00:09:13,478 --> 00:09:15,748
So let's just drop it. She's our daughter, not a son.

141
00:09:18,348 --> 00:09:19,618
All right.

142
00:09:24,588 --> 00:09:26,388
You want me to start paying for household expenses?

143
00:09:26,928 --> 00:09:29,828
You have a steady paycheck now, and you even got a raise.

144
00:09:29,898 --> 00:09:34,398
I need to save up for my wedding. That's why I'm crashing here.

145
00:09:34,768 --> 00:09:36,838
Mom and Dad at least have this house.

146
00:09:37,138 --> 00:09:39,638
If I can't save up, I won't ever get married.

147
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:41,708
Do you have any idea how big the mortgage is on this place?

148
00:09:42,008 --> 00:09:43,808
Mom and Dad don't have any retirement savings either.

149
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:47,908
Gosh, you're so shameless.

150
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:51,248
You have no savings because you're always quitting your jobs.

151
00:09:51,318 --> 00:09:52,418
Hey, they weren't the right fit for me.

152
00:09:52,488 --> 00:09:55,188
You're not even dating anyone, so what else are you spending on?

153
00:09:55,858 --> 00:09:58,258
What makes you so sure I'm not dating anyone?

154
00:09:58,688 --> 00:10:02,728
I haven't seen you on your phone talking to Hong Mi in forever.

155
00:10:03,628 --> 00:10:06,928
I even heard you crying alone in your room.

156
00:10:08,068 --> 00:10:10,868
I don't get why girls these days are so sly.

157
00:10:13,008 --> 00:10:14,008
Except for one.

158
00:10:15,538 --> 00:10:16,538
And who's that?

159
00:10:18,908 --> 00:10:23,518
- A vixen's got you hooked. - Hey, that's not it at all!

160
00:10:23,818 --> 00:10:27,488
Until Dad gets a full-time job as an electrical technician,

161
00:10:27,748 --> 00:10:29,418
let's chip in for living expenses, Ji Wan.

162
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:33,058
For us to just eat and sleep here for free when Mom's working...

163
00:10:33,128 --> 00:10:34,328
Does that seem right to you?

164
00:10:35,398 --> 00:10:38,528
No, but we have Ji Hyuk.

165
00:10:38,898 --> 00:10:41,868
Think about Dad. Try to see it from his perspective.

166
00:10:42,238 --> 00:10:46,908
Given how things are with Ji Hyuk, you think Dad would take his money?

167
00:10:49,008 --> 00:10:51,038
Fine. How much do I have to chip in?

168
00:10:52,878 --> 00:10:55,648
(Youth and Rock)

169
00:11:01,788 --> 00:11:04,688
This is Serim General Hospital. Regarding your recent application,

170
00:11:04,758 --> 00:11:06,858
we regret to inform you that your application was unsuccessful.

171
00:11:11,898 --> 00:11:13,268
- Hey, Sang Cheol. - Yes?

172
00:11:13,268 --> 00:11:15,598
Come on in and have a drink. It's on the house.

173
00:11:15,798 --> 00:11:17,768
Man, I'm not in the mood to drink right now.

174
00:11:18,038 --> 00:11:21,468
So you failed three interviews. Is that a reason to be so down?

175
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,108
You're just getting started.

176
00:11:24,038 --> 00:11:26,748
I'm not even getting any interviews unless they're in the countryside.

177
00:11:26,808 --> 00:11:29,648
So what? You work a tough job all day...

178
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:31,578
and can't even go home?

179
00:11:32,218 --> 00:11:34,988
I'm not making any money. How can I face them at dinner?

180
00:11:35,688 --> 00:11:37,358
Especially since Da Jeong is working now too.

181
00:11:38,388 --> 00:11:40,058
Oh, boy.

182
00:11:40,688 --> 00:11:41,758
Come on. Get up.

183
00:11:43,228 --> 00:11:44,228
Whatever.

184
00:11:44,858 --> 00:11:46,428
(Part-Time Gig, Recruiting Women for Food Tasting)

185
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:47,898
(Short-Term Banquet Server: Seoul, Gyeonggi)

186
00:11:53,808 --> 00:11:54,868
What?

187
00:12:08,088 --> 00:12:09,858
Why was he sitting there looking so miserable?

188
00:12:11,588 --> 00:12:13,328
He should just go inside and have a drink.

189
00:12:15,258 --> 00:12:16,258
Yes.

190
00:12:18,558 --> 00:12:20,028
What's going on with you two?

191
00:12:20,728 --> 00:12:22,138
You should contribute 1,000 dollars every month.

192
00:12:22,538 --> 00:12:23,898
Su Bin and I decided...

193
00:12:23,898 --> 00:12:25,968
to pitch in 500 dollars each for living expenses.

194
00:12:26,808 --> 00:12:28,308
What brought this on all of a sudden?

195
00:12:29,408 --> 00:12:32,178
Mom has a point, and so does Dad.

196
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:36,448
But Dad is the head of this family. We still have to respect that.

197
00:12:37,378 --> 00:12:39,118
He's been the sole breadwinner his whole life.

198
00:12:39,188 --> 00:12:42,618
But now, Mom's the one working, and Dad's looking for a job.

199
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:47,088
We shouldn't assume, like you do, that Dad can't be an electrician.

200
00:12:47,158 --> 00:12:48,758
We shouldn't just write him off.

201
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:51,628
Hey, doesn't she sound like our big sister?

202
00:12:52,598 --> 00:12:53,968
Our baby sister's all grown up.

203
00:12:54,998 --> 00:12:58,768
If you pay for everything yourself, it would really hurt Dad's pride.

204
00:12:59,608 --> 00:13:01,608
That's why it's better if we all contribute.

205
00:13:02,278 --> 00:13:04,678
And luckily, my YouTube channel is making decent money now.

206
00:13:06,748 --> 00:13:08,048
I'm so proud of our baby sister.

207
00:13:08,878 --> 00:13:10,748
Let's tell Dad together when he gets home.

208
00:13:11,378 --> 00:13:13,448
All right, we'll see you later, Mr. CEO.

209
00:13:13,748 --> 00:13:14,748
Okay.

210
00:13:15,088 --> 00:13:16,088
Let's go.

211
00:13:28,328 --> 00:13:29,598
What is even happening...

212
00:13:30,538 --> 00:13:31,798
Gosh, this is so complicated.

213
00:13:33,108 --> 00:13:34,238
What am I supposed to do?

214
00:13:37,508 --> 00:13:38,608
I'm home.

215
00:13:39,808 --> 00:13:42,578
What kept you so late? Have you eaten?

216
00:13:42,748 --> 00:13:45,348
I had to take care of something. I already ate.

217
00:13:46,118 --> 00:13:48,988
- You're home! - Dad, you're back!

218
00:13:49,588 --> 00:13:51,718
- Dad, you're home. - Hi.

219
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,458
Why are the three of you stampeding down here?

220
00:13:54,528 --> 00:13:58,298
We wanted to share the results of our sibling meeting.

221
00:13:58,728 --> 00:13:59,728
A meeting?

222
00:14:00,328 --> 00:14:02,698
Mom, Dad, listen up!

223
00:14:03,438 --> 00:14:06,968
Your youngest, who was always broke, is finally earning her own money.

224
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:09,138
I've passed 100,000 subscribers on YouTube!

225
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:11,338
Actually, the current count is 135,000.

226
00:14:11,638 --> 00:14:13,778
So, no more allowance for me.

227
00:14:14,048 --> 00:14:15,618
I can start contributing to the household expenses.

228
00:14:16,178 --> 00:14:18,148
Ji Wan and I will each contribute 500 dollars.

229
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:20,288
Ji Hyuk, being the oldest, will put in 1,000 dollars.

230
00:14:21,188 --> 00:14:24,618
With my siblings pitching in, I can't just get a free ride.

231
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:29,058
Dad, now that Mom is earning money too,

232
00:14:29,228 --> 00:14:31,028
you don't have to carry the burden of expenses alone.

233
00:14:31,528 --> 00:14:33,528
You can just focus on landing that electrician job.

234
00:14:37,398 --> 00:14:40,868
Honey, what do you think? The kids are so insistent.

235
00:14:42,738 --> 00:14:44,108
What's there to even think about?

236
00:14:44,638 --> 00:14:46,878
They're earning their own money, so they want to chip in.

237
00:14:48,008 --> 00:14:50,918
See? All your hard work has paid off.

238
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:06,698
What are you doing?

239
00:15:07,128 --> 00:15:08,798
Just wiping the floor.

240
00:15:09,298 --> 00:15:11,468
You always wipe the floor before you lay out the bedding.

241
00:15:11,898 --> 00:15:13,738
I know, but why are you...

242
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:17,208
Seriously, why are you acting so out of character?

243
00:15:17,438 --> 00:15:21,448
Since you're working now, I should help out around the house.

244
00:15:21,908 --> 00:15:24,378
Honey, what's with you? You don't have to do that.

245
00:15:24,448 --> 00:15:28,518
It's fine. I was bored and needed something to do. Don't mind me.

246
00:15:33,728 --> 00:15:34,728
Move aside.

247
00:15:41,968 --> 00:15:43,868
She said I was lost in Busan.

248
00:15:44,968 --> 00:15:47,568
So why was I adopted from the Cheongju Orphanage?

249
00:15:48,808 --> 00:15:50,138
Was the Busan story a lie?

250
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:53,148
Did she abandon me at the Cheongju Orphanage?

251
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,918
The people at the orphanage were very clear.

252
00:15:55,918 --> 00:15:58,118
They said you were abandoned.

253
00:15:58,618 --> 00:16:00,118
With no name or anything.

254
00:16:04,188 --> 00:16:07,258
(My twin was raised, but I was put up for adoption. Remarried?)

255
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:10,798
But if we're twins,

256
00:16:11,598 --> 00:16:13,198
why was I the only one abandoned?

257
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:16,168
Did she keep him because he was the son...

258
00:16:17,938 --> 00:16:19,138
and got rid of me because I'm a girl?

259
00:16:20,338 --> 00:16:24,038
- Brother! - Yu Ra!

260
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:27,378
- Brother! - Yu Ra!

261
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,948
Brother!

262
00:16:30,378 --> 00:16:34,188
- Yu Ra! - Mom!

263
00:16:34,318 --> 00:16:36,588
Yu Ra!

264
00:16:37,118 --> 00:16:39,388
Yu Ra!

265
00:16:46,228 --> 00:16:47,228
What was that?

266
00:16:48,228 --> 00:16:49,398
Was that a dream?

267
00:16:50,438 --> 00:16:51,598
Or a memory?

268
00:16:54,038 --> 00:16:55,108
Was I...

269
00:16:55,638 --> 00:16:58,778
at the same orphanage as my twin brother?

270
00:17:07,618 --> 00:17:09,788
Where on earth did he go so early?

271
00:17:11,158 --> 00:17:13,928
Ji Hyuk. Heading out this early again?

272
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:17,628
- You'll wear yourself out. - No, I'm fine.

273
00:17:18,298 --> 00:17:20,428
By the way, has Dad already left?

274
00:17:21,198 --> 00:17:23,338
Yes. He was gone when I woke up.

275
00:17:24,198 --> 00:17:26,238
Okay. I'm off.

276
00:17:26,668 --> 00:17:27,668
Okay.

277
00:17:32,748 --> 00:17:34,678
This early... He must be at the day labor market.

278
00:18:05,178 --> 00:18:07,678
Hey, what's with the long face?

279
00:18:09,848 --> 00:18:10,848
Mr. Lee.

280
00:18:12,118 --> 00:18:14,748
No, Ji Hyuk, I was just regretting not listening to you.

281
00:18:19,288 --> 00:18:20,288
I'm sorry.

282
00:18:21,228 --> 00:18:22,258
And...

283
00:18:23,698 --> 00:18:24,798
I need your help.

284
00:18:27,828 --> 00:18:29,598
Why don't you just say you won't do the liver transplant?

285
00:18:31,338 --> 00:18:33,338
She's not the type to give up that easily.

286
00:18:34,168 --> 00:18:36,778
I've been thinking back on the past six months,

287
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:39,378
ever since we first met by chance on the subway.

288
00:18:40,178 --> 00:18:41,808
It feels like she planned everything meticulously.

289
00:18:42,378 --> 00:18:44,618
That's how desperate she was for my liver.

290
00:18:45,178 --> 00:18:46,418
What you want is what's most important.

291
00:18:46,988 --> 00:18:48,718
What can she do if you refuse?

292
00:18:49,758 --> 00:18:52,528
Because I can't predict what she'll do.

293
00:18:53,888 --> 00:18:55,628
And I don't want to be manipulated by her.

294
00:18:56,058 --> 00:18:58,628
Are you scared of your birth mother?

295
00:19:01,128 --> 00:19:02,668
Are you afraid you'll go soft on her?

296
00:19:05,398 --> 00:19:06,768
I'm not scared,

297
00:19:08,938 --> 00:19:12,108
but she's just really good at making me lower my guard.

298
00:19:16,648 --> 00:19:18,178
I'm glad that you're healthy.

299
00:19:22,288 --> 00:19:23,688
That's why I want to find it.

300
00:19:25,258 --> 00:19:26,688
Hard proof...

301
00:19:27,788 --> 00:19:29,028
that she abandoned me.

302
00:19:33,768 --> 00:19:36,198
When Mom and Dad filed for my full adoption,

303
00:19:36,498 --> 00:19:38,298
I had no personal information, you see.

304
00:19:38,768 --> 00:19:41,638
No name, no social security number, no guardian information. Nothing.

305
00:19:42,238 --> 00:19:44,208
That's why they didn't need a guardian's consent.

306
00:19:44,538 --> 00:19:46,278
But for her to have found you...

307
00:19:46,748 --> 00:19:49,948
means she's the one who left you at the Cheongju Orphanage, right?

308
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:51,678
Exactly.

309
00:19:52,348 --> 00:19:55,548
And to find me, she must have gotten my adoptive parents' information...

310
00:19:56,188 --> 00:19:57,858
from the Cheongju Orphanage.

311
00:20:04,758 --> 00:20:05,758
Yeong Ra.

312
00:20:06,468 --> 00:20:09,068
Ji Wan, I'm not going to marry him.

313
00:20:09,538 --> 00:20:11,168
I told my dad I couldn't go through with it.

314
00:20:11,798 --> 00:20:13,668
- Really? - Yes, really.

315
00:20:14,408 --> 00:20:17,978
So? Wait, you didn't tell your mom,

316
00:20:18,038 --> 00:20:19,608
but you told your dad?

317
00:20:20,308 --> 00:20:23,178
If I told my mom first, there's no way I could win.

318
00:20:23,818 --> 00:20:25,278
So I brought it up in front of Dad.

319
00:20:26,148 --> 00:20:27,618
What did you say?

320
00:20:28,288 --> 00:20:31,958
I told him I couldn't even kiss the VP of Jinhwa Pharmaceuticals.

321
00:20:32,058 --> 00:20:35,328
No way! How did you even think to say that?

322
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:37,858
Wait, so what happened?

323
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:39,898
He said I didn't have to do the engagement ceremony.

324
00:20:40,598 --> 00:20:42,798
He said I didn't have to, right in front of Mom.

325
00:20:43,238 --> 00:20:44,638
An engagement ceremony?

326
00:20:45,098 --> 00:20:46,508
You were supposed to have an engagement ceremony?

327
00:20:46,938 --> 00:20:48,168
You never said anything about that.

328
00:20:48,608 --> 00:20:50,378
Oh, that's...

329
00:20:51,408 --> 00:20:53,578
It wasn't something you could have fixed,

330
00:20:53,848 --> 00:20:55,078
so I just didn't tell you.

331
00:20:55,608 --> 00:20:58,578
So you've been worrying about this all by yourself?

332
00:21:00,618 --> 00:21:04,118
I just knew there was no way I could go through with it.

333
00:21:04,588 --> 00:21:05,588
My gosh.

334
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,758
Park Yeong Ra, you've really grown up.

335
00:21:08,528 --> 00:21:09,558
I'm proud of you.

336
00:21:10,058 --> 00:21:11,098
I know, right?

337
00:21:11,428 --> 00:21:15,398
Right. So, you're not being forced to marry that guy, right?

338
00:21:15,598 --> 00:21:16,598
No!

339
00:21:19,768 --> 00:21:22,708
Hey, your mom's in her office. What do you want to eat?

340
00:21:45,058 --> 00:21:48,828
All that's left is to tell your dad about you becoming a webtoon artist.

341
00:21:51,698 --> 00:21:52,738
That might be pushing it.

342
00:21:53,668 --> 00:21:55,338
Dad won't approve of that either.

343
00:21:58,608 --> 00:21:59,848
It's okay.

344
00:22:00,748 --> 00:22:02,008
We've got plenty of time now.

345
00:22:03,118 --> 00:22:04,578
Just take your time and think about it.

346
00:22:05,978 --> 00:22:06,988
About what?

347
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:10,458
There are two kinds of people in this world.

348
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:14,228
You have to decide which one you're going to be.

349
00:22:15,488 --> 00:22:18,298
What are the two kinds?

350
00:22:20,068 --> 00:22:23,438
Those who live for themselves and those who live for others.

351
00:22:23,938 --> 00:22:27,808
People who live the way they want and those who do what they are told.

352
00:22:29,238 --> 00:22:31,778
The talented and the ordinary.

353
00:22:33,048 --> 00:22:37,718
Ji Wan, you have a way of saying things that really stick.

354
00:22:38,778 --> 00:22:39,788
Hey, I've got another one.

355
00:22:40,588 --> 00:22:44,588
Those who act when the time's right, and people who hesitate forever.

356
00:22:44,788 --> 00:22:45,788
You.

357
00:22:46,328 --> 00:22:48,188
Neiro keeps calling me about you.

358
00:22:51,298 --> 00:22:53,898
Do it. Let's do it! Let's sign the contract!

359
00:22:54,928 --> 00:22:55,928
For real?

360
00:22:57,268 --> 00:22:59,808
For my dad, Seong Jae's marriage comes first.

361
00:23:00,768 --> 00:23:03,578
So that buys me at least a year.

362
00:23:04,278 --> 00:23:05,708
I can publish my series during that time.

363
00:23:06,178 --> 00:23:07,578
Okay, sounds good.

364
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,418
At least you're taking baby steps forward.

365
00:23:11,718 --> 00:23:13,518
Since the contract will be under your name,

366
00:23:13,518 --> 00:23:15,018
you take 50 percent.

367
00:23:15,388 --> 00:23:17,758
Hey, that's way too much.

368
00:23:20,628 --> 00:23:22,458
But what's the pay?

369
00:23:23,158 --> 00:23:25,098
I'll ask them right now, okay?

370
00:23:34,938 --> 00:23:36,678
Dad, I don't want to get engaged.

371
00:23:37,878 --> 00:23:38,978
Call off the engagement.

372
00:23:43,018 --> 00:23:46,318
Just as Woo Jin's issue is resolved, now it's Yeong Ra and Seong Jae?

373
00:23:49,658 --> 00:23:51,088
Let me get Woo Jin's surgery over with first.

374
00:23:52,688 --> 00:23:54,328
I can deal with everything else after.

375
00:24:10,808 --> 00:24:12,408
How can I help you?

376
00:24:12,578 --> 00:24:15,808
Hello. I'm here because I have a few questions.

377
00:24:15,908 --> 00:24:17,948
Could I please see the director?

378
00:24:17,978 --> 00:24:22,618
I'm glad you've grown up well. Now, what was it you wanted to know?

379
00:24:23,158 --> 00:24:26,688
By any chance, when I was abandoned here,

380
00:24:26,928 --> 00:24:29,258
was my twin brother with me?

381
00:24:29,928 --> 00:24:32,528
You were alone when you were transferred here.

382
00:24:33,498 --> 00:24:35,128
Are you saying she came from somewhere else?

383
00:24:35,128 --> 00:24:39,868
Yes. She was originally at Persimmon Tree Orphanage in Paju,

384
00:24:40,138 --> 00:24:44,378
but there was a big fire there, so she was moved here.

385
00:24:45,508 --> 00:24:49,578
Then would there be any paperwork from the transfer?

386
00:24:49,718 --> 00:24:52,548
That orphanage burned to the ground,

387
00:24:52,678 --> 00:24:56,288
so all we have are a few brief notes from their director.

388
00:24:56,488 --> 00:25:00,088
"Abandoned child, identity unknown. Name, Yu Ra."

389
00:25:00,158 --> 00:25:01,388
That's all it says.

390
00:25:02,058 --> 00:25:03,698
Do you have the contact information...

391
00:25:03,698 --> 00:25:06,698
for Persimmon Tree Orphanage's director?

392
00:25:06,968 --> 00:25:09,428
It was a private orphanage,

393
00:25:09,428 --> 00:25:12,138
so I don't know what happened to them after it closed.

394
00:25:12,438 --> 00:25:15,338
What about a year ago, then?

395
00:25:15,638 --> 00:25:19,278
Did anyone come looking for her full adoption records?

396
00:25:20,248 --> 00:25:23,818
Yes. Someone asking where a child named Yu Ra had been adopted.

397
00:25:23,918 --> 00:25:26,248
A man did come by asking that.

398
00:25:26,948 --> 00:25:28,118
And you told him?

399
00:25:28,188 --> 00:25:31,788
Of course not. Without documents proving his relation to the child,

400
00:25:31,858 --> 00:25:33,328
we would never give out that kind of information.

401
00:25:35,228 --> 00:25:38,728
If she didn't get my parents' address from here,

402
00:25:38,898 --> 00:25:40,768
there's no way she could have found me.

403
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:46,768
Did anything unusual happen around that time that stands out?

404
00:25:47,568 --> 00:25:52,038
Nothing was stolen, so I can't say it was a burglar, but...

405
00:25:52,138 --> 00:25:55,678
we did find a window that was broken from the outside and left open.

406
00:26:19,438 --> 00:26:21,238

410
00:26:34,018 --> 00:26:35,448
That must be how she stole the records.

411
00:26:35,888 --> 00:26:38,988
If she has your old address, she'll find you eventually.

412
00:26:39,928 --> 00:26:40,928
But...

413
00:26:41,358 --> 00:26:43,628
we have no proof that she's the one who took them.

414
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:45,728
That's true.

415
00:26:47,568 --> 00:26:49,098
So, what's our next move?

416
00:26:50,538 --> 00:26:52,568
I need to think about it a little more.

417
00:26:53,868 --> 00:26:55,808
Thanks for your help today.

418
00:26:58,508 --> 00:27:01,248
Just the six-month lease on the art space alone...

419
00:27:01,748 --> 00:27:02,978
That alone is suspicious enough, you know?

420
00:27:05,578 --> 00:27:06,588
I know.

421
00:27:07,018 --> 00:27:08,048
Look,

422
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:11,988
if there's more you want to do, tell me. Don't do it alone.

423
00:27:15,128 --> 00:27:16,428
It's just... I keep...

424
00:27:16,728 --> 00:27:19,158
getting this feeling that I'm missing something.

425
00:27:21,428 --> 00:27:22,968
I just don't know what it is.

426
00:27:27,538 --> 00:27:31,478
Eun Oh, didn't you say you got a checkup with her?

427
00:27:33,308 --> 00:27:34,448
What if at that time...

428
00:27:35,608 --> 00:27:38,378
she already ran the compatibility test?

429
00:27:45,658 --> 00:27:47,688
There's no way Eun Oh would do that.

430
00:27:48,128 --> 00:27:50,798
I saw Eun Oh the day after you brought her home.

431
00:27:51,758 --> 00:27:53,528
Kids can sense things.

432
00:27:53,628 --> 00:27:55,568
She didn't leave your side for a moment.

433
00:27:56,738 --> 00:28:00,768
Even in the car on the way home, she kept holding my hand.

434
00:28:00,838 --> 00:28:03,138
Think about how you and Yeong Min raised Eun Oh.

435
00:28:03,238 --> 00:28:06,108
You raised her more carefully than I raised my own daughter.

436
00:28:06,508 --> 00:28:10,248
Eun Oh won't go to her birth mother. Your bond is stronger than blood.

437
00:28:10,318 --> 00:28:11,318
No way.

438
00:28:11,818 --> 00:28:13,018
You think so?

439
00:28:13,318 --> 00:28:18,188
Sun Hui, you have to tell Eun Oh. Tell her how awful that woman is.

440
00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:22,728
She won't believe me. She can't possibly believe me.

441
00:28:22,788 --> 00:28:26,128
Do you have any idea how elegant and refined that woman seems?

442
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:29,368
Eun Oh's only seen her good side. But the side she showed me...

443
00:28:29,428 --> 00:28:31,468
Tell Eun Oh all about her true, snake-like nature?

444
00:28:32,338 --> 00:28:33,908
Eun Oh would never believe it.

445
00:28:34,368 --> 00:28:37,538
She's that bad? I can't even imagine.

446
00:28:38,878 --> 00:28:43,218
She was confident in Eun Oh's trust, so she had the nerve to come to me.

447
00:28:43,318 --> 00:28:46,378
Even if she's her birth mother, they met a few months ago, right?

448
00:28:46,448 --> 00:28:50,418
She first met her as a major client who saw her interior design talent.

449
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:55,428
So of course, she doted on Eun Oh. She even arranged a medical checkup.

450
00:29:00,328 --> 00:29:01,328
What is it?

451
00:29:04,038 --> 00:29:05,438
The medical checkup...

452
00:29:07,908 --> 00:29:10,838
- So that's why she did it. - What?

453
00:29:11,538 --> 00:29:12,638
(Queue Number 0005)

454
00:29:12,978 --> 00:29:15,578
Hi, I seem to have lost my medical results form.

455
00:29:15,848 --> 00:29:18,848
- May I see your ID, please? - Yes.

456
00:29:27,728 --> 00:29:29,488
My MRI results are missing.

457
00:29:32,458 --> 00:29:34,368
Right. For the MRI,

458
00:29:34,368 --> 00:29:36,668
the contrast agent might make you feel cold,

459
00:29:36,738 --> 00:29:37,868
so don't be alarmed.

460
00:29:38,738 --> 00:29:40,768
Let's ask for it again. It must've been omitted by mistake.

461
00:29:45,178 --> 00:29:48,108
The MRI isn't on the list for your exam.

462
00:29:48,508 --> 00:29:50,678
Are you sure you had it done at this hospital?

463
00:29:51,278 --> 00:29:54,688
Our records show you only received an abdominal CT scan.

464
00:29:57,718 --> 00:29:58,718
I see.

465
00:30:03,998 --> 00:30:05,698
To see if I was a suitable donor,

466
00:30:06,128 --> 00:30:07,928
she found out in advance, right here.

467
00:30:08,698 --> 00:30:13,068
An MRI shows the liver's position, size, and vascular structure.

468
00:30:15,338 --> 00:30:18,978
Once she confirmed you were a match, she pushed you for DNA registration.

469
00:30:22,078 --> 00:30:24,378
It must've made you think of your birth parents.

470
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:28,288
Have you ever been curious about your birth parents or missed them?

471
00:30:29,348 --> 00:30:33,088
What if they didn't abandon you, but lost you instead?

472
00:30:35,288 --> 00:30:37,698
After finding out my liver was a match,

473
00:30:37,958 --> 00:30:39,128
only then...

474
00:30:39,428 --> 00:30:42,198
she manipulated me into searching for my birth parents.

475
00:30:43,338 --> 00:30:44,398
So that's what this was all about.

476
00:30:56,948 --> 00:30:58,518
Something doesn't add up.

477
00:30:58,818 --> 00:31:03,048
No record of the MRI means she must've had an accomplice here.

478
00:31:04,018 --> 00:31:05,258
But why go to such lengths?

479
00:31:07,258 --> 00:31:08,288
I wonder.

480
00:31:10,528 --> 00:31:13,998
Even if I turned out to be a match, to be a liver donor,

481
00:31:14,128 --> 00:31:16,968
she would've needed DNA proof of a biological relationship.

482
00:31:19,138 --> 00:31:20,138
Director.

483
00:31:20,968 --> 00:31:23,308
- Good day, sir. - Yes. Keep up the good work.

484
00:31:34,318 --> 00:31:35,548
Anyway,

485
00:31:35,948 --> 00:31:38,458
I need to go and think this through calmly.

486
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:40,188
Okay.

(Madagascar Volunteer Service Commemoration, November 2015)

489
00:32:06,448 --> 00:32:07,448
Right.

490
00:32:11,218 --> 00:32:12,388
I get it now.

491
00:32:14,628 --> 00:32:17,098
If I hadn't been a suitable match for the liver transplant,

492
00:32:18,258 --> 00:32:20,028
she would've just ended it right there.

493
00:32:20,898 --> 00:32:24,238
So if this hospital hadn't confirmed you were a match for the transplant,

494
00:32:25,238 --> 00:32:28,008
she never would've revealed that she was your mother.

495
00:32:29,868 --> 00:32:31,438
If my liver hadn't been a match,

496
00:32:34,108 --> 00:32:35,708
she would have had no use for me.

497
00:32:58,938 --> 00:33:00,138
I'm going to keep working.

498
00:33:00,238 --> 00:33:02,968
We wanted to share the results of our sibling meeting.

499
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:04,808
Ji Wan and I will each contribute 500 dollars.

500
00:33:04,808 --> 00:33:07,348
Ji Hyuk, being the oldest, will put in 1,000 dollars.

501
00:33:07,508 --> 00:33:10,318
Dad, you don't have to carry the burden of expenses alone.

502
00:33:10,578 --> 00:33:11,818
You can just focus on landing that electrician job.

503
00:33:12,648 --> 00:33:14,748
I'm your father. I'm the head of this household.

504
00:33:15,688 --> 00:33:18,388
Some head of the family. I'm just the one who's unemployed.

505
00:33:41,778 --> 00:33:43,148
Being young is so nice.

506
00:33:44,248 --> 00:33:45,348
They all look so vibrant.

522
00:35:03,928 --> 00:35:05,728
What if you went as a duo with Sang Cheol?

523
00:35:06,428 --> 00:35:09,298
The first singer from Myeongseong's Business Administration Department!

524
00:35:09,928 --> 00:35:12,738
- Hey, that's a great idea. - And Sang Cheol has the looks.

525
00:35:12,798 --> 00:35:15,008
Hey, you jerk, since when do you sing with your face?

526
00:35:15,338 --> 00:35:18,708
Hey, stop egging me on. I'm the eldest son.

527
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:22,808
- Then just make it big as a singer. - Man, my father sold our cows,

528
00:35:23,078 --> 00:35:25,448
and his dad worked the anchovy boats to send us to college.

529
00:35:25,518 --> 00:35:27,188
How can I become a singer when it's such a gamble?

530
00:35:28,088 --> 00:35:31,488
Look, I'll start my own business and make a fortune. No question.

531
00:35:32,358 --> 00:35:33,358
Same here.

532
00:35:34,028 --> 00:35:35,188
I'm not cut out for business, though.

533
00:35:35,988 --> 00:35:37,128
So I'm going to get a good, stable job.

534
00:35:39,958 --> 00:35:44,638
(Myeongseong University)

535
00:35:47,408 --> 00:35:48,408
Oh, wait.

536
00:35:50,978 --> 00:35:52,478
(Kim Yeong Bo)

537
00:35:55,508 --> 00:35:58,248
Hey, Yeong Bo, you won't believe where I am right now.

538
00:35:58,918 --> 00:36:01,288
Sang Cheol, Byeong Ho's dead.

539
00:36:03,188 --> 00:36:04,318
Hey, what... What are you talking about?

540
00:36:05,058 --> 00:36:07,788
But he was perfectly fine when I spoke to him last week.

541
00:36:08,758 --> 00:36:09,888
You're joking, right?

542
00:36:10,298 --> 00:36:12,128
The funeral is going to be in Mexico.

543
00:36:13,058 --> 00:36:14,198
I guess you can't make it either, right?

544
00:36:26,238 --> 00:36:29,508
It's the first day, so my heart is pounding.

545
00:36:31,378 --> 00:36:33,788
One. Two.

546
00:36:34,318 --> 00:36:35,318
Three.

547
00:36:35,848 --> 00:36:39,018
(Senior Model)

548
00:36:39,518 --> 00:36:41,388
Yes. I'm outside Grandma's class right now.

549
00:36:42,228 --> 00:36:44,998
She's shaking because she's nervous. It's adorable.

550
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:47,068
Are you sure you can handle this by yourself?

551
00:36:47,128 --> 00:36:50,198
Come on, don't worry about it. You just take the week off and rest.

552
00:36:50,268 --> 00:36:54,108
- I'll even handle the editing. - You're going to edit, too?

553
00:36:54,868 --> 00:36:57,808
Right now, I need something to throw myself into.

554
00:36:59,278 --> 00:37:03,108
Okay. For our next class, wear something...

555
00:37:03,208 --> 00:37:05,678
form-fitting on the bottom so I can see your walk.

556
00:37:06,318 --> 00:37:07,718
And please bring high heels as well.

557
00:37:08,388 --> 00:37:09,388
High heels?

558
00:37:09,788 --> 00:37:12,358
Oh dear, I could break a bone if I fall.

559
00:37:14,258 --> 00:37:18,498
One, two, three, four, five.

560
00:37:19,198 --> 00:37:21,168
Good. Again.

561
00:37:22,098 --> 00:37:25,698
Now, walk as if you're balancing a jar on your head.

562
00:37:26,298 --> 00:37:28,738
You wouldn't want it to fall or break, would you?

563
00:37:29,008 --> 00:37:31,138
I've carried my share of water jugs on my head.

564
00:37:32,738 --> 00:37:36,918
Okay, again. Straighten your back, and don't let the jar fall.

565
00:37:37,648 --> 00:37:42,548
One, two, three, four, five.

566
00:37:43,148 --> 00:37:45,318
That's it. That's the feeling.

567
00:37:48,428 --> 00:37:50,158
All right, let's try that one more time.

568
00:37:53,428 --> 00:37:54,428
Su Bin!

569
00:37:54,928 --> 00:37:56,568
- Hey! - Grandma!

570
00:37:58,468 --> 00:38:00,338
Hello, everyone. Hi.

571
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:07,378
Grandfather made me your manager so you wouldn't give up.

572
00:38:07,808 --> 00:38:09,048
Oh, my goodness.

573
00:38:10,178 --> 00:38:12,678
But why were you filming me in secret?

574
00:38:13,078 --> 00:38:16,788
Are you planning on exploiting me for your YouTube channel?

575
00:38:17,918 --> 00:38:19,818
The idea came to me yesterday.

576
00:38:19,818 --> 00:38:21,858
My grandma's second chapter in life,

577
00:38:21,928 --> 00:38:22,928
her journey to becoming a senior model.

578
00:38:23,858 --> 00:38:26,758
I thought it'd be fun to film it. Plus, we'll have great memories.

579
00:38:27,368 --> 00:38:32,068
I was worried you'd get cold feet, so I secretly filmed the first day.

580
00:38:32,868 --> 00:38:33,868
Second chapter in life?

581
00:38:35,108 --> 00:38:39,008
My senior model journey? Wow, that has a nice ring to it.

582
00:38:39,708 --> 00:38:43,278
It's because you're the one who's so amazing and special.

583
00:38:43,978 --> 00:38:46,548
- I'm special? - Totally.

584
00:38:46,978 --> 00:38:49,888
Who else is this adorable at age 88?

585
00:38:51,158 --> 00:38:53,988
You're already so popular with my YouTube subscribers.

586
00:38:54,488 --> 00:38:57,328
They're still begging me to make more videos with you.

587
00:38:57,928 --> 00:39:00,158
Modeling in this would be great publicity.

588
00:39:00,398 --> 00:39:02,068
I saw in the comments...

589
00:39:02,568 --> 00:39:04,438
that everyone wanted to see more of me.

590
00:39:05,698 --> 00:39:07,408
I got permission from the academy director, too.

591
00:39:07,868 --> 00:39:10,478
We agreed to blur out any students who don't want to be on camera.

592
00:39:13,578 --> 00:39:15,778
(Shoealls)

593
00:39:15,778 --> 00:39:19,478
Good. As for the list of reporters to invite to the new product launch,

594
00:39:19,878 --> 00:39:21,988
- let's go with this. - Understood.

595
00:39:23,288 --> 00:39:26,218
This new line and the packaging look great, Mr. Vice President.

596
00:39:36,068 --> 00:39:38,138
Get them, Ha Eun, and yourself together,

597
00:39:38,738 --> 00:39:39,768
take a vote, and let me know...

598
00:39:40,608 --> 00:39:43,208
which one of these two you'd buy.

599
00:39:43,468 --> 00:39:46,738
All right, I'll do it. And I'll keep it top secret.

600
00:39:47,348 --> 00:39:50,578
This can't leak before the launch. It's strictly confidential.

601
00:39:53,118 --> 00:39:54,488
After making her do all that...

602
00:40:00,288 --> 00:40:01,858
I should've given her one of these.

603
00:40:08,868 --> 00:40:12,298
Thank you so much for staying late to help me today.

604
00:40:12,468 --> 00:40:13,698
Please. It was nothing.

605
00:40:15,208 --> 00:40:16,338
Anything for the woman I like.

606
00:40:17,178 --> 00:40:18,178
Of course, I'd help.

607
00:40:21,378 --> 00:40:23,108
Did I not mention that before?

608
00:40:23,878 --> 00:40:24,878
That I'm not giving up on you?

609
00:40:25,718 --> 00:40:26,718
You did.

610
00:40:27,988 --> 00:40:29,548
Do you not even remember what you said?

611
00:40:30,018 --> 00:40:31,018
So you do remember.

612
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:32,658
Then why aren't you telling me to stop?

613
00:40:33,188 --> 00:40:34,828
Since I'm grateful to you today,

614
00:40:35,388 --> 00:40:36,758
I'll let it slide just this once.

615
00:40:37,528 --> 00:40:39,258
I'll wait until you can forgive me.

616
00:40:43,798 --> 00:40:44,798
See? You smiled.

617
00:40:45,738 --> 00:40:46,768
It's cold. Get inside.

618
00:40:48,638 --> 00:40:50,268
Okay, I'm going.

619
00:41:01,848 --> 00:41:03,148
I'm home.

620
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:05,918
Oh, Mom.

621
00:41:06,488 --> 00:41:09,028
Isn't it too early to close the restaurant?

622
00:41:09,458 --> 00:41:10,458
I know.

623
00:41:11,098 --> 00:41:13,098
I came home early because I have something to tell you.

624
00:41:16,468 --> 00:41:18,768
What is it about? Here, have a seat.

625
00:41:30,208 --> 00:41:32,848
Mom, did something happen?

626
00:41:35,048 --> 00:41:36,148
Eun Oh, I...

627
00:41:37,188 --> 00:41:41,158
I just need to ask you one thing. What if...

628
00:41:42,388 --> 00:41:45,798
What if your birth mother isn't who you think she is?

629
00:41:46,658 --> 00:41:47,868
What would you do?

630
00:41:53,438 --> 00:41:54,438
Mom.

631
00:41:55,308 --> 00:41:56,638
Just say whatever is on your mind.

632
00:41:57,208 --> 00:41:58,208
It's okay.

633
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:02,948
If I tell you this, you might resent me,

634
00:42:04,648 --> 00:42:09,248
or even come to hate me, but I still have to say it.

635
00:42:11,158 --> 00:42:13,058
A while back, that woman...

636
00:42:13,258 --> 00:42:16,888
She had you get a deluxe health screening.

637
00:42:17,128 --> 00:42:20,158
That day, what kind of tests did you get?

638
00:42:21,668 --> 00:42:24,198
I'm just worried that it might have been some kind of...

639
00:42:24,768 --> 00:42:26,638
preliminary suitability test.

640
00:42:27,408 --> 00:42:28,838
All sorts of thoughts are just running through my head.

641
00:42:34,048 --> 00:42:35,048
Mom.

642
00:42:36,008 --> 00:42:38,178
Why are you talking like you've committed a crime?

643
00:42:40,618 --> 00:42:41,618
What?

644
00:42:45,088 --> 00:42:48,128
You're the only mom I have.

645
00:42:50,128 --> 00:42:51,128
As for her...

646
00:42:51,698 --> 00:42:53,758
That was just on the off-chance.

647
00:42:53,828 --> 00:42:56,398
It wasn't because I wanted to find my birth mother.

648
00:42:57,368 --> 00:42:58,368
But...

649
00:43:00,668 --> 00:43:03,738
how am I supposed to feel if you're walking on eggshells around me?

650
00:43:05,378 --> 00:43:06,378
Don't be like that, Mom.

651
00:43:08,848 --> 00:43:09,848
I'm the one who should be sorry.

652
00:43:11,048 --> 00:43:12,418
I'm really sorry.

653
00:43:14,518 --> 00:43:16,848
That's what mothers do. We walk on eggshells with our kids.

654
00:43:25,628 --> 00:43:26,998
About what you said...

655
00:43:28,198 --> 00:43:29,228
I'll seriously look into it.

656
00:43:30,598 --> 00:43:31,598
Because you're my mom.

657
00:43:33,398 --> 00:43:34,408
You'll look into it?

658
00:43:35,508 --> 00:43:36,508
Yes.

659
00:43:37,638 --> 00:43:38,638
Okay.

660
00:43:45,348 --> 00:43:46,678
Have a good night.

661
00:43:48,788 --> 00:43:51,588
Excuse me, we're closing now.

662
00:43:54,328 --> 00:43:56,158
- Sorry? - We're closing.

663
00:43:56,228 --> 00:43:57,598
Already?

664
00:43:59,058 --> 00:44:00,098
Okay, I'll get going.

665
00:44:07,438 --> 00:44:09,708
If I go home, I'll just end up thinking about Seong Jae again.

666
00:44:28,288 --> 00:44:30,998
Gosh, where is she wandering around this late?

667
00:44:49,448 --> 00:44:50,818
That looks like Seong Jae.

668
00:44:51,948 --> 00:44:53,318
No, it can't be.

669
00:44:54,888 --> 00:44:57,458
I can't go over there. I can't.

670
00:45:14,138 --> 00:45:15,138
The new model.

671
00:45:16,738 --> 00:45:17,738
I wanted to give you this.

672
00:45:19,408 --> 00:45:20,878
You helped me out a lot.

673
00:45:26,918 --> 00:45:28,148
So this is why you came.

674
00:45:38,398 --> 00:45:39,698
Then I'll wear them well. Thanks.

675
00:45:45,268 --> 00:45:46,268
All right.

676
00:45:47,168 --> 00:45:48,168
Take care.

677
00:46:26,208 --> 00:46:27,208
Sorry.

678
00:46:28,578 --> 00:46:32,278
I'm sorry. How am I supposed to fix this?

679
00:46:32,648 --> 00:46:33,878
Why did I just hug you?

680
00:46:38,218 --> 00:46:40,388
What do you mean, "why?" You hugged me because you like me.

681
00:46:43,188 --> 00:46:44,298
Let's just date for 100 days.

682
00:46:45,128 --> 00:46:46,698
I know what you're worried about.

683
00:46:47,398 --> 00:46:50,098
But I just... I like you,

684
00:46:50,168 --> 00:46:52,468
so let's not worry about a future that might not even happen, okay?

685
00:46:52,938 --> 00:46:56,808
So let's just give this a try, without thinking about the end.

686
00:46:57,638 --> 00:46:59,808
This kid's got a way with words.

687
00:47:03,148 --> 00:47:04,378
You just smiled.

688
00:47:10,518 --> 00:47:11,518
If we...

689
00:47:13,018 --> 00:47:14,588
start dating and then break up,

690
00:47:16,728 --> 00:47:20,028
can you promise to just let it be a memory that's ours and ours alone?

691
00:47:20,298 --> 00:47:24,838
Without Ji Hyuk or our parents ever finding out.

692
00:47:25,898 --> 00:47:28,808
Of course. People get together and break up all the time.

693
00:47:29,008 --> 00:47:30,568
Who reports their whole dating life to their family?

694
00:47:31,538 --> 00:47:33,708
And if one of us has a change of heart,

695
00:47:34,008 --> 00:47:36,348
we'll use a code word. Cuckoo.

696
00:47:38,218 --> 00:47:39,218
Cuckoo?

00:47:39,618 --> 00:47:42,748
If you get that text, it's over. No questions asked. The end.

698
00:47:43,118 --> 00:47:45,158
And we'll cherish it as our own secret memory forever.

699
00:47:46,118 --> 00:47:47,218
And we'll go back to the way we were.

700
00:47:52,198 --> 00:47:53,198
Deal?

701
00:48:00,098 --> 00:48:01,108
Well...

702
00:48:05,778 --> 00:48:06,778
Deal.

703
00:48:37,008 --> 00:48:38,008
Yes!

704
00:48:38,278 --> 00:48:41,048
This is unreal. Me, with Seong Jae? For real?

705
00:48:43,878 --> 00:48:44,878

Man...

707
00:48:54,728 --> 00:48:56,658
What have I gotten myself into?

708
00:48:59,998 --> 00:49:00,998
Right.

709
00:49:01,428 --> 00:49:02,928

710

There's a 99 percent chance Su Bin will be over it in 100 days.

711
00:49:11,238 --> 00:49:12,808
Gosh, why am I taking this so seriously?

712
00:49:21,218 --> 00:49:22,218

What?

715
00:49:35,598 --> 00:49:37,028
What are you doing here?

716
00:49:37,798 --> 00:49:40,868
I had a feeling you'd be heading to Persimmon Tree Orphanage.

717
00:49:41,638 --> 00:49:45,138
Otherwise, the CEO would escort you to work.

718
00:49:46,438 --> 00:49:48,908
You don't have to come with me today. I feel bad.

719
00:49:50,248 --> 00:49:52,018
So you're headed there.

720
00:49:53,418 --> 00:49:56,788
It burned down and was never rebuilt.

721
00:49:57,118 --> 00:49:58,118
Why do you still want to go?

722
00:49:59,318 --> 00:50:00,818
I need to do this so I won't have any regrets.

723
00:50:01,758 --> 00:50:03,328
I want to at least go back to where it all started.

724
00:50:06,298 --> 00:50:07,298
I'm coming with you, then.

725
00:50:07,998 --> 00:50:09,868
In a way, I'm the one who started all this.

726
00:50:10,628 --> 00:50:11,898
So I need to see it through to the end, too.

727
00:50:12,668 --> 00:50:13,668
All right, let's go.

728
00:50:22,708 --> 00:50:24,008
I think we're almost there.

729
00:50:27,418 --> 00:50:29,788
Hey, look. That's the persimmon tree.

730
00:51:06,458 --> 00:51:07,458
Here you go.

731
00:51:08,328 --> 00:51:10,128
Thanks.

732
00:51:39,958 --> 00:51:41,328
It wasn't a dream.

733
00:51:45,798 --> 00:51:49,298
My brother and I were here together, but...

734
00:51:51,338 --> 00:51:54,168
That woman tore us apart.

735
00:51:55,338 --> 00:51:56,868
Wait, if you were with your brother,

736
00:51:57,368 --> 00:51:59,278
why were you sent to the Cheongju Orphanage...

737
00:51:59,278 --> 00:52:01,778

But if I'm remembering correctly...

742
00:52:17,998 --> 00:52:18,998
Right here.

743
00:52:19,598 --> 00:52:21,168
She only took him.

744
00:52:28,338 --> 00:52:31,838
This persimmon tree here, it's over 60 years old.

745
00:52:32,678 --> 00:52:34,608
It's been here since before I got married.

746
00:52:37,508 --> 00:52:39,678
Ma'am, do you happen...

747
00:52:40,218 --> 00:52:43,288
to remember the orphanage that used to be here?

748
00:52:43,788 --> 00:52:44,858
Of course, I do.

749
00:52:45,518 --> 00:52:49,158
Oh, dear. But it burned down, right to the ground.

750
00:52:50,188 --> 00:52:55,168
Everyone was hauling water buckets to try and save the kids.

751
00:52:57,668 --> 00:53:00,868
- You have an amazing memory, ma'am. - Oh, please.

By any chance,

755
00:53:08,178 --> 00:53:09,978
do you remember the orphanage director?

756
00:53:10,378 --> 00:53:12,078
Of course.

757
00:53:12,648 --> 00:53:15,488
We were all neighbors. How could I forget?

758
00:53:22,028 --> 00:53:23,058
Please, have some.

759
00:53:27,658 --> 00:53:28,668
Excuse me, but...

760
00:53:29,428 --> 00:53:30,598
Before the fire,

761
00:53:30,598 --> 00:53:33,138
weren't there twins at the orphanage? A boy and a girl.

762
00:53:34,608 --> 00:53:36,308
The year of the fire...

763
00:53:38,678 --> 00:53:40,378
Yes, there were.

764
00:53:41,778 --> 00:53:42,948
They were at the orphanage together?

765
00:53:43,408 --> 00:53:44,678
No.

766
00:53:45,518 --> 00:53:48,848
When the fire broke out, only the girl was left.

767
00:53:53,618 --> 00:53:54,788
That heartless witch.

768
00:53:57,388 --> 00:53:58,398
Sorry?

769
00:53:59,058 --> 00:54:00,898
She abandoned both of them here,

770
00:54:00,958 --> 00:54:04,128

(1998, Persimmon Tree Orphanage)

774
00:54:15,078 --> 00:54:16,108
Hi.

775
00:54:16,978 --> 00:54:21,078
They called each other brother and sister but were the same height.

776
00:54:21,518 --> 00:54:23,118
So I assumed they were twins.

777
00:54:26,118 --> 00:54:27,618
- Mom. - Yes?

778
00:54:27,688 --> 00:54:28,888
You're talking about that story, aren't you?

779
00:54:29,488 --> 00:54:33,958
Before the fire, a woman claimed to be their mother showed up...

780
00:54:34,058 --> 00:54:35,768
and only took the son.

781
00:54:36,328 --> 00:54:37,428
That's right.

782
00:54:38,368 --> 00:54:41,738
I was just flabbergasted that a mother could be so heartless.

783
00:54:42,468 --> 00:54:45,878
No, Woo Jin has an ear infection, and I need to get it treated.

784
00:54:46,278 --> 00:54:49,508
But you have no proof that you're their mother.

785
00:54:49,908 --> 00:54:52,318
But the kids are calling me Mom right now.

786
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:56,518
You abandoned them and didn't leave their names, ID numbers,

787
00:54:56,588 --> 00:54:58,818
or even the parents' names.

788
00:54:59,558 --> 00:55:02,228
And now, you think you can show up and take one of them?

789
00:55:02,988 --> 00:55:04,428
Absolutely not.

790
00:55:06,658 --> 00:55:09,168

so I barely managed to make a copy of her ID,

794
00:55:20,808 --> 00:55:22,778

why didn't you send those records with her?

01:02:21,698 --> 01:02:22,698
Oh, my.

877
01:02:23,298 --> 01:02:25,238
- Eun Oh. - I am...

878
01:02:25,938 --> 01:02:27,438
not going through with the transplant.

879
01:02:29,338 --> 01:02:30,338
What?

880
01:02:30,868 --> 01:02:32,938
I know you sought me out on purpose from the very beginning.

881
01:02:33,608 --> 01:02:36,778
It was no coincidence. Everything, from the very beginning until now...

882
01:02:36,848 --> 01:02:39,378
I know you planned it all, so...

883
01:02:39,878 --> 01:02:42,118
don't bother making excuses. Just leave.

884
01:02:42,548 --> 01:02:44,048
And don't ever come looking for me again.

(National ID Card, Name: Ko Seong Hui)

886
01:03:02,168 --> 01:03:03,738
That son of yours...

887
01:03:04,838 --> 01:03:07,308
is never getting my liver.

(Our Golden Days)

889
01:03:50,618 --> 01:03:53,918
What is Mom up to? I'm dying of curiosity.

890
01:03:54,088 --> 01:03:55,188
Han Woo Jin?

891
01:03:55,328 --> 01:03:58,228
I knew you were up to something, acting sly in front of your dad.

892
01:03:58,288 --> 01:04:01,998
- So this was it. - The donor you struggled to find...

893
01:04:02,268 --> 01:04:03,998
Is it Ji Eun Oh, by any chance?

894
01:04:04,568 --> 01:04:06,298
Please, just say something to your sister.

895
01:04:06,668 --> 01:04:08,368
You're offering a million dollars just to say something to her?

896
01:04:08,538 --> 01:04:11,738
He must be your son. It's not like I'm your daughter.

897
01:04:11,808 --> 01:04:13,238
What older brother? I don't have one.

898
01:04:13,508 --> 01:04:16,508
Are you okay with your brother dying because of you?

899
01:04:16,508 --> 01:04:17,978
That would make you a murderer.
