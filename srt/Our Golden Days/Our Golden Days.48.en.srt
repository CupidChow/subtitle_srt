00:00:01,227 --> 00:00:02,697
(Episode 48)

2
00:00:02,767 --> 00:00:04,637
If you truly care about me,

3
00:00:05,497 --> 00:00:06,937
even if it's just for one day,

4
00:00:07,537 --> 00:00:09,407
please be my boyfriend.

5
00:00:10,637 --> 00:00:11,877
You can't regret this.

6
00:00:30,827 --> 00:00:31,827
This is...

7
00:00:35,167 --> 00:00:37,027
a lot more dangerous than I thought.

8
00:00:42,537 --> 00:00:43,537
What is?

9
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:49,447
It makes me forget all about tomorrow.

10
00:00:55,317 --> 00:00:56,347
So...

11
00:00:58,987 --> 00:01:00,387
don't go changing your mind.

12
00:01:09,567 --> 00:01:11,297
So, it's come to this.

13
00:01:14,767 --> 00:01:15,767
It has.

14
00:01:30,287 --> 00:01:32,757
What? Who could that be at this hour?

15
00:01:34,257 --> 00:01:36,127
Stay here. I'll get it.

16
00:01:40,197 --> 00:01:41,197
Who is it?

17
00:01:47,567 --> 00:01:49,667
You punk. What the heck are you doing here?

18
00:01:52,137 --> 00:01:53,137
You two,

19
00:01:54,177 --> 00:01:55,447
what are you doing here?

20
00:01:56,347 --> 00:01:57,947
Why are you hanging around Yeong Ra?

21
00:01:58,217 --> 00:01:59,677
You're not her bodyguard or her driver anymore.

22
00:01:59,817 --> 00:02:01,917
I'm not "hanging around" Yeong Ra.

23
00:02:02,647 --> 00:02:04,147
We're working on a collaboration.

24
00:02:05,217 --> 00:02:07,957
Mom, Ji Wan is the webtoon artist I'm collaborating with.

25
00:02:09,227 --> 00:02:11,057
So, he finally got his hooks in you.

26
00:02:12,057 --> 00:02:14,627
- Get out. - Why should I?

27
00:02:15,627 --> 00:02:18,337
You're not my employer anymore, and this place...

28
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:19,767
is my office.

29
00:02:20,337 --> 00:02:21,437
Excuse me?

30
00:02:22,407 --> 00:02:24,107
Mom, what are you doing here?

31
00:02:25,377 --> 00:02:26,707
Tell him to leave, and then we'll talk.

32
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:30,747
Ji Wan, can you give us three minutes?

33
00:02:31,817 --> 00:02:32,817
Three minutes?

34
00:02:33,977 --> 00:02:36,787
Got it. I'll be right outside.

35
00:02:48,127 --> 00:02:49,297
Why are you here?

36
00:02:50,327 --> 00:02:52,637
If this is about money, we already talked about this.

37
00:02:54,097 --> 00:02:57,367
I can't give you Dad's family money without his permission.

38
00:03:04,007 --> 00:03:05,447
I'm not here for money.

39
00:03:07,147 --> 00:03:08,147
A house.

40
00:03:09,347 --> 00:03:10,347
A house?

41
00:03:10,917 --> 00:03:12,157
You already know.

42
00:03:13,457 --> 00:03:16,887
Your father put a mortgage on every one of my properties...

43
00:03:17,157 --> 00:03:18,627
and siphoned off all my cash.

44
00:03:19,457 --> 00:03:22,127
He claimed it was a namesake, but your dad was behind it all.

45
00:03:22,527 --> 00:03:24,937
But you exposed him, thinking it was Dad!

46
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:26,897
How could you?

47
00:03:27,137 --> 00:03:29,637
He tried to drag me down with him. What choice did I have?

48
00:03:30,537 --> 00:03:32,837
In the end, everyone just looks out for number one.

49
00:03:34,377 --> 00:03:37,007
Let's just drop this, Yeong Ra. I'm exhausted.

50
00:03:38,047 --> 00:03:40,147
Can't you see how tired your own mother is?

51
00:03:41,047 --> 00:03:43,717
I should at least have a place to rest my head.

52
00:03:44,747 --> 00:03:45,787
So?

53
00:03:48,927 --> 00:03:52,227
I need you to convince Dad to get me a house.

54
00:03:52,657 --> 00:03:55,967
You're the only daughter your father and I have together.

55
00:03:56,467 --> 00:03:58,197
He won't be able to say no to you.

56
00:03:58,997 --> 00:04:00,367
And what if he says no?

57
00:04:02,337 --> 00:04:04,807
Then it just means you didn't try hard enough.

58
00:04:05,607 --> 00:04:07,177
In that case, you can just get me one.

59
00:04:12,347 --> 00:04:15,717
Honey, look at the state of you.

60
00:04:16,447 --> 00:04:18,557
It's so obvious you don't have a mother looking after you.

61
00:04:20,057 --> 00:04:21,827
I'm dressed like this because it's comfortable to work in.

62
00:04:23,187 --> 00:04:24,787
If you've said your piece, you can go.

63
00:04:25,097 --> 00:04:26,197
I have work to do.

64
00:04:27,527 --> 00:04:29,397
What? Go where?

65
00:04:29,797 --> 00:04:31,497
I told you. I have nowhere to go!

66
00:04:32,167 --> 00:04:35,137
So you're just going to stay here?

67
00:04:36,507 --> 00:04:39,277
I'm not leaving until you get me a house.

68
00:04:39,277 --> 00:04:40,637
What else can I do?

69
00:04:51,187 --> 00:04:52,757
Ji Wan, come on in.

70
00:04:53,687 --> 00:04:55,187
I'm staying right here.

71
00:04:55,957 --> 00:04:57,257
Then you can wait outside.

72
00:05:01,227 --> 00:05:02,467
Ji Wan, let's get back to work.

73
00:05:03,167 --> 00:05:04,627
Okay.

74
00:05:08,437 --> 00:05:11,207
Maybe I should move the table.

75
00:05:17,807 --> 00:05:20,177
You're the one who changed Yeong Ra, aren't you?

76
00:05:21,177 --> 00:05:24,647
Just as soon as I'm back on my feet, I'll make you pay.

77
00:05:26,657 --> 00:05:27,657
(Listings matching my criteria)

78
00:05:27,717 --> 00:05:29,787
(Deposit: 50,000 dollars, Monthly rent: 4,100 dollars)

79
00:05:31,627 --> 00:05:35,327
"Fine, you call me Driver Ji, and I'll call you Young Lady."

80
00:05:37,367 --> 00:05:40,067
(Fine, you call me Driver Ji, and I'll call you Young Lady...)

81
00:05:41,097 --> 00:05:42,467
Wait, what was next?

82
00:05:43,367 --> 00:05:44,837
The next part was...

83
00:05:46,407 --> 00:05:47,877
"Don't speak so casually?"

84
00:05:48,477 --> 00:05:49,907
I don't think that's it.

85
00:05:52,177 --> 00:05:54,817
Woo Jin, you saw the news, right?

86
00:05:55,787 --> 00:05:58,387
Everything I said is true.

87
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,587
Park Jin Seok treated you like a stranger,

88
00:06:01,887 --> 00:06:04,327
and it really broke my heart.

89
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:06,897
That's why I did it, you know?

90
00:06:08,927 --> 00:06:12,497
But now, Mom has nowhere to turn.

91
00:06:13,437 --> 00:06:14,967
You're all I have.

92
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,577
So please, help me.

93
00:06:19,537 --> 00:06:20,977
Just call me, please.

94
00:06:26,247 --> 00:06:28,347
One can only eat toast for so long.

95
00:06:29,717 --> 00:06:32,387
I'll make kimchi bean sprout soup for breakfast tomorrow.

96
00:06:34,887 --> 00:06:36,557
I'm pretty sure we have some bean sprouts.

97
00:06:42,197 --> 00:06:43,297
What's this?

98
00:06:48,437 --> 00:06:50,607
I guess he was craving some bulgogi.

99
00:06:51,837 --> 00:06:53,877
- I'm home. - Hey.

100
00:06:54,077 --> 00:06:55,147
You're home.

101
00:06:56,477 --> 00:06:57,477
Dad.

102
00:06:57,877 --> 00:07:00,877
- Can I talk to you for a second? - Sure.

103
00:07:13,397 --> 00:07:14,957
What are they being so secretive about?

104
00:07:23,007 --> 00:07:25,937
Yes, what's up? Is something wrong? You're not well?

105
00:07:27,237 --> 00:07:32,217
No, it's nothing like that. Dad, what's for lunch tomorrow?

106
00:07:32,547 --> 00:07:34,077
Bulgogi over rice.

107
00:07:34,647 --> 00:07:38,087
Then, could you maybe make a little extra?

108
00:07:38,557 --> 00:07:39,957
What? You want more?

109
00:07:40,357 --> 00:07:42,287
Hey, you know you're not supposed to overeat.

110
00:07:42,827 --> 00:07:44,827
Why? Have you been extra hungry lately?

111
00:07:45,557 --> 00:07:47,257
No, it's not like that.

112
00:07:48,027 --> 00:07:50,667
I was thinking I might have lunch with Eun Oh tomorrow,

113
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:54,067
and Eun Oh... Well, she doesn't eat a lot.

114
00:07:54,867 --> 00:07:56,437
With Eun Oh?

115
00:07:57,867 --> 00:07:58,977
Well...

116
00:07:59,537 --> 00:08:01,507
Eun Oh and I are dating now.

117
00:08:02,777 --> 00:08:03,777
What?

118
00:08:05,747 --> 00:08:10,287
Wait a minute... Eun Oh? Even though she knows?

119
00:08:12,257 --> 00:08:13,257
Yes.

120
00:08:14,917 --> 00:08:16,157
You see, I...

121
00:08:17,057 --> 00:08:18,627
I was no match for Eun Oh.

122
00:08:20,927 --> 00:08:23,897
Right. And you know Eun Oh.

123
00:08:23,967 --> 00:08:26,567
She's not the type to give up easily.

124
00:08:27,097 --> 00:08:28,967
All right. Okay, I get it.

125
00:08:29,167 --> 00:08:32,137
Making extra? That's no problem at all.

126
00:08:44,017 --> 00:08:46,357
I guess not. He's all smiles.

127
00:08:47,017 --> 00:08:49,427
What? What are you talking about all of a sudden?

128
00:08:50,027 --> 00:08:52,797
Nothing. I just thought maybe Ji Hyuk was sick.

129
00:08:54,127 --> 00:08:55,197
Honey.

130
00:08:56,227 --> 00:08:57,267
Ji Hyuk...

131
00:08:57,797 --> 00:09:00,497
and Eun Oh are officially dating.

132
00:09:01,537 --> 00:09:02,537
Really?

133
00:09:03,767 --> 00:09:06,707
Wow, are you really that touched that your son found love?

134
00:09:07,207 --> 00:09:09,007
Look at you. You're about to cry.

135
00:09:09,177 --> 00:09:13,047
No, it's just... Ji Hyuk has been through so much.

136
00:09:14,447 --> 00:09:16,747
Now that I think about it, I'm a little hurt.

137
00:09:17,087 --> 00:09:21,017
So Ji Hyuk told you that in private? And not while I was here?

138
00:09:22,027 --> 00:09:26,497
It's because I'm Eun Oh's friend, so he was just giving me an update.

139
00:09:26,697 --> 00:09:29,727
He must've been so proud to share, after having a crush for so long.

140
00:09:29,997 --> 00:09:31,327
I know, but still.

141
00:09:31,397 --> 00:09:35,607
Didn't you say you went on a date with Ji Hyuk to some dessert cafe?

142
00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:36,667
Without me!

143
00:09:49,147 --> 00:09:50,947
I start working at 10am.

144
00:09:51,687 --> 00:09:52,917
I need you to be out of here by then.

145
00:09:54,187 --> 00:09:56,287
Bring a blanket and a sleeping mat when you come tomorrow.

146
00:09:57,357 --> 00:10:00,397
Are you seriously going to keep sleeping here?

147
00:10:01,597 --> 00:10:04,427
I have no choice until I find a place of my own.

148
00:10:05,937 --> 00:10:09,867
Oh, just go with him now and get the blanket and mat.

149
00:10:10,267 --> 00:10:12,977
How am I supposed to sleep here with just this one rug?

150
00:10:15,177 --> 00:10:18,477
You decided to sleep here, not me.

151
00:10:20,977 --> 00:10:24,147
Fine... I know.

152
00:10:26,517 --> 00:10:27,757
That's why...

153
00:10:28,117 --> 00:10:30,727
you have to convince your dad. You must.

154
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:36,167
Let's go, Yeong Ra.

155
00:10:58,447 --> 00:10:59,517
I'm home.

156
00:11:01,087 --> 00:11:02,127
Come here for a second.

157
00:11:08,827 --> 00:11:09,827
Yes.

158
00:11:11,067 --> 00:11:14,867
Tell Woo Jin to get in touch. I want to see him.

159
00:11:17,007 --> 00:11:18,537
Woo Jin? Why?

160
00:11:19,577 --> 00:11:23,907
What kind of question is that? We were father and son for 26 years.

161
00:11:25,077 --> 00:11:28,017
And what about his mother? What are you planning to do?

162
00:11:29,817 --> 00:11:31,617
Why are you so concerned about her?

163
00:11:32,087 --> 00:11:33,517
She's Yeong Ra's mother.

164
00:11:34,657 --> 00:11:37,787
We're family, too. We have the right to know what's happening, Dad.

165
00:11:42,497 --> 00:11:43,497
Fine.

166
00:11:44,567 --> 00:11:46,397
I suppose it's time I told you.

167
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:47,997
Sit down.

168
00:11:49,107 --> 00:11:51,307
Yeong Ra, you should join us, too.

169
00:12:07,787 --> 00:12:10,527
For 26 years, she and I were husband and wife.

170
00:12:11,427 --> 00:12:14,257
And we even had Yeong Ra together. She's Yeong Ra's mother.

171
00:12:14,397 --> 00:12:17,767
I'll tell you why I'm pushing her into a corner.

172
00:12:20,337 --> 00:12:22,237
I'm doing this my way.

173
00:12:22,637 --> 00:12:25,737
I'm giving her the punishment that fits her true character.

174
00:12:27,137 --> 00:12:28,807
From the very beginning,

175
00:12:29,647 --> 00:12:32,377
I've realized all she cares about is money.

176
00:12:33,917 --> 00:12:35,717
With her eyes only on the money,

177
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:39,217
her acting was so disgustingly good, she deceived me to my very core.

178
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:45,827
Yeong Ra, you, Woo Jin, and Ji Eun Oh.

179
00:12:46,627 --> 00:12:51,527
For money, she'd abandon, deceive, and use her own children.

180
00:12:53,667 --> 00:12:57,037
She drove a wedge between me and our children,

181
00:12:57,937 --> 00:13:00,077
and blinded me to what was happening.

182
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:03,807
Then why don't you just divorce her?

183
00:13:04,907 --> 00:13:07,777
If we divorce, she'll claim her share of the assets.

184
00:13:08,347 --> 00:13:11,587
If I release the mortgage, forget about any remorse...

185
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:14,587
or apology. Not a chance.

186
00:13:16,257 --> 00:13:19,327
She'll walk away with a fortune and live it up.

187
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:22,527
And we'd be left with 26 years of being deceived,

188
00:13:23,027 --> 00:13:27,237
and the emptiness and injustice of all we lost.

189
00:13:27,697 --> 00:13:28,807
The pure outrage.

190
00:13:30,337 --> 00:13:32,407
All of that would be our burden to bear.

191
00:13:33,737 --> 00:13:37,207
They'll remain, fully intact, and torment us for a long time.

192
00:13:38,347 --> 00:13:39,347
I can't let that happen.

193
00:13:40,477 --> 00:13:41,547
So,

194
00:13:42,647 --> 00:13:44,447
you want to get revenge on her?

195
00:13:45,347 --> 00:13:46,457
Revenge?

196
00:13:47,957 --> 00:13:50,087
What is there to gain from revenge?

197
00:13:51,257 --> 00:13:52,357
Ko Seong Hui...

198
00:13:53,197 --> 00:13:55,097
She robbed me of my years.

199
00:13:55,727 --> 00:13:57,227
She stole all those years.

200
00:13:58,797 --> 00:13:59,867
She made my son...

201
00:14:01,167 --> 00:14:05,307
survive on the kindness of his friend's parents.

202
00:14:07,977 --> 00:14:11,347
She almost made Yeong Ra a sacrifice...

203
00:14:11,347 --> 00:14:12,877
for an arranged marriage.

204
00:14:13,877 --> 00:14:14,917
As for Woo Jin,

205
00:14:16,587 --> 00:14:19,757
he was pressured and exhausted by her demands to take your place.

206
00:14:21,757 --> 00:14:25,997
I spent 26 years trusting and loving a woman like that.

207
00:14:27,697 --> 00:14:29,227
I can never get those years back.

208
00:14:33,597 --> 00:14:34,737
Dad.

209
00:14:35,967 --> 00:14:38,037
Dad, you've been hurt so deeply.

210
00:14:39,307 --> 00:14:43,177
That's why I just sent her back to where she came from.

211
00:14:45,307 --> 00:14:46,947
Everything she gained through deceit.

212
00:14:47,517 --> 00:14:48,987
I had to make her leave it all behind.

213
00:14:51,387 --> 00:14:54,187
After living in luxury for 26 years,

214
00:14:55,357 --> 00:14:57,427
what's so harsh or unfair about this?

215
00:14:58,127 --> 00:14:59,227
If she has any humanity at all.

216
00:15:03,427 --> 00:15:07,137
Yeong Ra, Seong Jae. I'm sorry to you both, but...

217
00:15:07,697 --> 00:15:10,367
I had to do this.

218
00:15:11,367 --> 00:15:14,437
No, this is what has to be done.

219
00:15:16,777 --> 00:15:20,477
Dad... I knew how betrayed you felt, but...

220
00:15:22,787 --> 00:15:23,787
Why?

221
00:15:24,587 --> 00:15:27,187
Because I've been drinking and agonizing every day,

222
00:15:28,087 --> 00:15:30,057
do you think I'm struggling because I can't let her go?

223
00:15:31,957 --> 00:15:35,927
I've just never seen you this much of a wreck.

224
00:15:38,267 --> 00:15:39,267
Right.

225
00:15:40,637 --> 00:15:41,667
I'm struggling.

226
00:15:44,307 --> 00:15:47,107
I feel empty. Hollow.

227
00:15:50,647 --> 00:15:51,977
Of course, it's hard.

228
00:15:53,847 --> 00:15:55,147
Of course, I feel empty.

229
00:15:57,887 --> 00:15:59,157
For 26 years...

230
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:03,527
She was the woman I loved.

231
00:16:06,397 --> 00:16:09,367
The wife I trusted.

232
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:15,267
Dad.

233
00:16:19,707 --> 00:16:21,077
This is me dealing with it.

234
00:16:23,347 --> 00:16:26,077
My own arrogance, my mistakes,

235
00:16:27,047 --> 00:16:29,847
self-blame, regret.

236
00:16:31,647 --> 00:16:32,657
The injustice of it all.

237
00:16:34,457 --> 00:16:35,687
That's what I'm going through.

238
00:16:39,397 --> 00:16:40,597
I'm sorry, Dad.

239
00:16:41,657 --> 00:16:42,997
I was being insensitive.

240
00:16:45,467 --> 00:16:47,567
Not as foolish as I've been.

241
00:16:51,767 --> 00:16:52,777
Dad.

242
00:16:53,537 --> 00:16:56,577
Mom came to my studio.

243
00:16:58,507 --> 00:16:59,517
I know.

244
00:17:00,077 --> 00:17:02,747
What am I supposed to do?

245
00:17:05,347 --> 00:17:07,117
Do whatever you want.

246
00:17:08,887 --> 00:17:10,757
There's no denying she's your mother.

247
00:17:18,497 --> 00:17:19,497
All right.

248
00:17:23,067 --> 00:17:25,307
- Dad. Are you okay? - Yes.

249
00:17:29,077 --> 00:17:30,907
- Let's go. - Yes, okay.

250
00:17:53,537 --> 00:17:56,207
I told you it would be a fake address.

251
00:17:59,207 --> 00:18:01,037
Moved in before the mortgage was set up...

252
00:18:01,037 --> 00:18:02,447
and moved out again a week later?

253
00:18:03,377 --> 00:18:06,747
The new address I checked is a room in a cheap boarding house.

254
00:18:07,177 --> 00:18:09,387
But no one there has seen them come or go.

255
00:18:10,487 --> 00:18:11,787
They wouldn't be living there.

256
00:18:13,487 --> 00:18:15,417
The address before moving to our neighborhood.

257
00:18:15,687 --> 00:18:18,587
Find the real address and start asking around from there.

258
00:18:19,357 --> 00:18:21,297
Also, look into Park Jin Seok's family records.

259
00:18:22,297 --> 00:18:23,367
All their addresses, too.

260
00:18:24,197 --> 00:18:27,537
And get me a Myeongdong Middle School yearbook.

261
00:18:33,877 --> 00:18:37,777
Oh, no. What do I do? How am I going to face him?

262
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,157
Oh, Ji Hyuk!

263
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,087
Did you sleep well?

264
00:18:52,327 --> 00:18:54,357
Yes. I slept well.

265
00:18:55,867 --> 00:18:56,897
You could actually sleep?

266
00:18:57,867 --> 00:18:59,937
I was tossing and turning all night.

267
00:19:01,897 --> 00:19:05,167
I guess I tossed and turned a bit, too.

268
00:19:07,207 --> 00:19:11,107
Let's have lunch together in my office later.

269
00:19:12,007 --> 00:19:13,217
Okay, sounds good.

270
00:19:38,937 --> 00:19:39,937
Why are you empty-handed?

271
00:19:41,337 --> 00:19:42,607
I didn't bring any bedding.

272
00:19:44,107 --> 00:19:46,317
Did he say where he's getting me a place?

273
00:19:47,077 --> 00:19:48,217
He's not.

274
00:19:49,517 --> 00:19:51,487
Did you tell your dad I was here?

275
00:19:52,117 --> 00:19:53,117
Yes.

276
00:19:53,617 --> 00:19:55,217
But he didn't say anything about it.

277
00:19:56,827 --> 00:19:59,197
So you didn't even ask?

278
00:19:59,797 --> 00:20:02,227
- You didn't try to convince him? - I didn't.

279
00:20:02,997 --> 00:20:04,067
What?

280
00:20:04,627 --> 00:20:06,597
Why? Why not?

281
00:20:06,667 --> 00:20:10,737
You tried to ruin Dad online to save your own skin.

282
00:20:11,007 --> 00:20:12,367
You tried to destroy him.

283
00:20:13,237 --> 00:20:15,177
How could I possibly ask him to get you a place after that?

284
00:20:15,337 --> 00:20:16,777
Because you're my daughter.

285
00:20:17,107 --> 00:20:19,717
You are my daughter. And I am your mother.

286
00:20:21,747 --> 00:20:24,917
This studio is 300 dollars a month with a 3,000-dollar deposit.

287
00:20:26,487 --> 00:20:28,557
From the advance for my new project, my share...

288
00:20:29,087 --> 00:20:30,687
was 5,000 dollars. I'll give all of it to you.

289
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,897
You'll have to earn the money to pay your own rent.

290
00:20:35,127 --> 00:20:36,797
You expect me to live in a dump like this?

291
00:20:37,067 --> 00:20:40,667
- Earn money to get a nicer place. - Park Yeong Ra!

292
00:20:41,037 --> 00:20:44,807
How dare you treat me like this? After everything I did to raise you?

293
00:20:45,337 --> 00:20:47,937
I gave you the best of everything all so you would be successful.

294
00:20:48,007 --> 00:20:49,177
That's a lie!

295
00:20:50,007 --> 00:20:54,317
You raised me to gain from marrying. None of it was for me!

296
00:20:55,247 --> 00:20:59,717
Moving up in the world is what's best for you.

297
00:21:00,657 --> 00:21:03,827
And now that your mother has been backed into a corner,

298
00:21:04,257 --> 00:21:06,827
it's your duty to help me get my assets back.

299
00:21:07,157 --> 00:21:09,127
That's the only way you'll maintain your own status!

300
00:21:09,197 --> 00:21:11,227
Mom, stop. Please, just stop!

301
00:21:13,037 --> 00:21:14,597
Mom, have you no shame?

302
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:17,967
Mom, why won't you beg Dad for forgiveness?

303
00:21:19,207 --> 00:21:21,407
And you won't even apologize to me.

304
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:23,547
I mean...

305
00:21:24,247 --> 00:21:25,477
Aren't you sorry?

306
00:21:27,047 --> 00:21:28,947
Mom, don't you feel sorry for what you did to Dad?

307
00:21:30,347 --> 00:21:32,617
Your father never gave me a chance to apologize.

308
00:21:33,457 --> 00:21:35,927
He's the one who stole my assets first!

309
00:21:35,987 --> 00:21:39,597
But you were wrong first! Terribly wrong!

310
00:21:39,897 --> 00:21:42,397
Then you should have begged! You should've asked for forgiveness!

311
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:47,297
You should've begged him to forgive. Just look at the things you've done!

312
00:21:47,867 --> 00:21:48,967
My gosh!

313
00:21:50,507 --> 00:21:51,667
Yeong Ra.

314
00:21:52,407 --> 00:21:56,247
You can't just judge someone...

315
00:21:56,307 --> 00:21:58,607
until you've walked a mile in their shoes.

316
00:21:59,447 --> 00:22:03,387
What I did wasn't meant to hurt your father.

317
00:22:03,747 --> 00:22:04,787
So?

318
00:22:05,847 --> 00:22:07,957
You're saying you have no intention of asking for forgiveness?

319
00:22:08,487 --> 00:22:10,287
He's the one who cleaned out my safe,

320
00:22:10,687 --> 00:22:13,497
threw my dossier in my face, and said to get out.

321
00:22:13,497 --> 00:22:15,327
That man threw me out!

322
00:22:15,827 --> 00:22:19,127
After he found out about your past and all of your lies,

323
00:22:19,637 --> 00:22:21,297
how did you expect Dad to react?

324
00:22:21,867 --> 00:22:24,807
And me? What about Seong Jae?

325
00:22:27,677 --> 00:22:31,307
So please, just tell Dad you were wrong.

326
00:22:32,577 --> 00:22:33,577
Mom.

327
00:22:34,877 --> 00:22:37,247
Mom, please just act like a decent human being.

328
00:22:39,457 --> 00:22:40,817
A decent human being?

329
00:22:41,987 --> 00:22:43,757
Apologize to Eun Oh, too.

330
00:22:45,357 --> 00:22:48,327
Deep down, you feel sorry too, don't you?

331
00:22:49,467 --> 00:22:52,967
You want to apologize to Eun Oh, but your pride won't let you, right?

332
00:22:54,967 --> 00:22:57,307
I had my reasons, and it's all in the past now.

333
00:22:57,567 --> 00:22:59,037
I even gave her money!

334
00:23:00,777 --> 00:23:01,807
Mom...

335
00:23:03,947 --> 00:23:05,507
Mom, why are you like this?

336
00:23:07,347 --> 00:23:08,847
How did you become this kind of person?

337
00:23:11,687 --> 00:23:13,187
I can't listen to any more of this.

338
00:23:14,917 --> 00:23:18,057
Who are you to judge me? To condemn me?

339
00:23:18,927 --> 00:23:22,697
You know nothing about my life, and you dare lecture your mother?

340
00:23:28,637 --> 00:23:30,537
If you're not going to convince your father,

341
00:23:31,007 --> 00:23:33,637
then sell your stocks and get me a proper apartment!

342
00:23:37,277 --> 00:23:38,277
No.

343
00:23:39,077 --> 00:23:41,777
Fine. Then I'll just have to live here.

344
00:23:48,817 --> 00:23:50,387
Ever since I started publishing my webtoon,

345
00:23:51,257 --> 00:23:54,357
I haven't spent a penny of the money I got from Grandfather or Dad...

346
00:23:55,227 --> 00:23:56,597
because I wanted to be a real adult.

347
00:23:58,797 --> 00:24:01,037
But since I'm always working, I don't really need much money.

348
00:24:02,497 --> 00:24:04,107
So you need to get a job, Mom.

349
00:24:04,867 --> 00:24:06,007
You have to work first...

350
00:24:06,307 --> 00:24:07,807
if you want to eat and pay your rent.

351
00:24:08,407 --> 00:24:09,577
Park Yeong Ra.

352
00:24:18,387 --> 00:24:19,717
This is 5,000 dollars.

353
00:24:21,057 --> 00:24:22,057
This is...

354
00:24:23,127 --> 00:24:25,427
the last money I will ever give you as your daughter.

355
00:24:27,427 --> 00:24:29,997
I'll never give you any money from Dad's family, so give up.

356
00:24:31,967 --> 00:24:34,237
If you come back, I won't open the door,

357
00:24:34,597 --> 00:24:36,407
and I won't give you another dime.

358
00:24:37,667 --> 00:24:38,667
Pack your bags.

359
00:24:40,737 --> 00:24:42,507
Are you kicking me out?

360
00:24:42,907 --> 00:24:44,407
This is my studio.

361
00:25:20,047 --> 00:25:23,247
You're my daughter, all right. You're just like me.

362
00:25:28,387 --> 00:25:29,387
Goodbye.

363
00:25:29,457 --> 00:25:31,827
You'll live to regret this. It won't even take a year.

What happened?

367
00:25:57,747 --> 00:25:58,817
My mom...

368
00:26:01,587 --> 00:26:02,987
I've finally seen her true colors.

369
00:26:04,887 --> 00:26:05,957
What do you mean by that?

370
00:26:13,337 --> 00:26:14,937
I don't have a mother anymore.

371
00:26:17,967 --> 00:26:20,507
I don't have a mother anymore.

372
00:26:23,647 --> 00:26:24,647
Yeong Ra.

373
00:26:29,717 --> 00:26:32,017
I'm not crying because I'm sad.

374
00:26:33,757 --> 00:26:35,487
I'm crying because I'm relieved that she's gone.

375
00:26:39,357 --> 00:26:41,127
So she really showed you her true colors.

Hey, Myeong Hui.

378
00:27:01,217 --> 00:27:03,017
Why are we changing the date of our get-together?

379
00:27:06,687 --> 00:27:08,587
It's the anniversary of Eun Mi's husband's death?

380
00:27:08,857 --> 00:27:10,427
Of course. We have to change it.

381
00:27:11,427 --> 00:27:15,457
I'll check my schedule this month and post it in our group chat.

382
00:27:16,397 --> 00:27:17,397
Okay.

383
00:27:22,037 --> 00:27:23,767
That's right. It was in the winter.

384
00:27:24,007 --> 00:27:27,337
Eun Mi's husband died of heart failure.

385
00:27:30,547 --> 00:27:32,677
He loved salty food,

386
00:27:32,777 --> 00:27:35,577
so having to eat bland food was the hardest part for him.

387
00:27:37,087 --> 00:27:40,317
Ji Hyuk's dad used to love salty food, too.

388
00:27:44,687 --> 00:27:46,597
Why are you dumping salt in there?

389
00:27:46,897 --> 00:27:50,767
I don't like salty food lately, so I made it bland on purpose.

390
00:27:52,227 --> 00:27:53,367
Ji Hyuk's father...

391
00:27:53,737 --> 00:27:55,597
Could there be something wrong with his health?

392
00:27:56,167 --> 00:27:58,767
- Hey, put him down! Dad! - My goodness.

393
00:27:59,137 --> 00:28:00,937
Can I get some water?

394
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:05,507
Ji Hyuk, what brings you down? Do you need something?

395
00:28:05,647 --> 00:28:07,977
I just had to use the bathroom.

396
00:28:08,747 --> 00:28:10,747
Didn't you just go a little while ago?

397
00:28:11,017 --> 00:28:15,357
I think we should have Ji Hyuk move into my mother's old room.

398
00:28:15,417 --> 00:28:18,827
- How would you know that? - I'd love that.

399
00:28:20,557 --> 00:28:22,057
It's not Ji Hyuk's father...

400
00:28:22,727 --> 00:28:23,797
It's Ji Hyuk?

401
00:28:26,437 --> 00:28:27,537
No, it can't be.

402
00:28:29,437 --> 00:28:32,307
"Awaiting Heart Transplant." Why were you looking that up?

403
00:28:33,137 --> 00:28:36,747
At work, one of my coworkers is in that situation.

404
00:28:37,347 --> 00:28:41,047
Early to mid-30s, I think. A guy.

405

Everyone dies eventually. It's the same for everybody.

406
00:28:49,987 --> 00:28:53,097
No, that can't be right. So why is my heart racing?

410

What should we get? Jajangmyeon, spicy pork?

411
00:29:26,227 --> 00:29:27,397
Jajangmyeon sounds good to me.

412
00:29:41,607 --> 00:29:42,607
This is delicious.

413
00:29:45,647 --> 00:29:48,577
Is that all you have to say? "This is delicious?"

414

How am I supposed to talk when I'm eating?

Eun Oh.

416
00:29:56,157 --> 00:29:59,027
We've had countless meals together over the past ten years,

417
00:29:59,457 --> 00:30:02,657
and I have never once seen you eat this quietly.

418
00:30:03,727 --> 00:30:06,697
That was different. You were my senior.

419
00:30:08,367 --> 00:30:11,607
So, did you always act this proper with other guys you dated?

420
00:30:17,207 --> 00:30:18,507
Come on.

421
00:30:18,947 --> 00:30:23,647
No, it's just our first date. I'm not the type to play coy.

422
00:30:24,047 --> 00:30:26,657
It's just that the dynamic has suddenly changed.

423
00:30:28,687 --> 00:30:29,687
And?

424
00:30:32,857 --> 00:30:35,257
Then why are you so casual about it?

425
00:30:35,727 --> 00:30:36,997
How are you so good at playing it cool?

426
00:30:41,437 --> 00:30:42,497
You think so?

427

What?

431
00:31:06,857 --> 00:31:09,257
Should we check out Seongsu? Or maybe Hannam-dong?

What's this?

435
00:31:22,507 --> 00:31:23,977
Porridge. My grandma's recipe.

436
00:31:25,947 --> 00:31:27,917
So this porridge is the "something" you had to give me?

437
00:31:28,747 --> 00:31:31,047
I'm actually about to head out. I have plans.

438
00:31:31,387 --> 00:31:34,417
You think you would've let me come if I said it was just porridge?

439
00:31:34,817 --> 00:31:37,887
I'm meeting Ha Eun soon anyway, so I just came to drop this off.

440
00:31:38,657 --> 00:31:43,197
I know you have a lot on your mind. Just have some for breakfast.

441
00:31:46,867 --> 00:31:49,167
You can't keep worrying about me like this.

442
00:31:49,237 --> 00:31:51,407
I get us being in touch because of Ji Hyuk, but...

443
00:31:52,567 --> 00:31:56,007
- If you keep doing this... - Scared you'll kiss me again?

444
00:32:02,117 --> 00:32:03,147
Yes.

445
00:32:04,687 --> 00:32:08,087
Well, so I'm here as your girlfriend today.

446
00:32:09,787 --> 00:32:12,427
- What? - My parents...

447
00:32:12,687 --> 00:32:14,997
gave me permission to date you.

448
00:32:18,797 --> 00:32:19,797
Wait, why?

449
00:32:20,137 --> 00:32:22,097
Didn't they see the YouTube video about my family?

450
00:32:22,667 --> 00:32:23,667
They saw it all.

451
00:32:24,707 --> 00:32:26,577
And they still want you to date a guy like me?

452
00:32:27,477 --> 00:32:30,377
They saw their dear daughter was unhappy...

453
00:32:30,377 --> 00:32:32,407
because she wasn't over you.

454
00:32:32,477 --> 00:32:33,647
That must be why.

455
00:32:38,187 --> 00:32:40,487
After all they know about my family, I just don't see how they could...

456
00:32:41,517 --> 00:32:42,987
approve of me.

457
00:32:44,287 --> 00:32:45,757
And with Ji Hyuk being so sick...

458
00:32:46,997 --> 00:32:50,297
I think my brother's condition swayed them a bit, too.

459
00:32:50,897 --> 00:32:53,837
Because you never know what could happen to someone.

460
00:33:03,847 --> 00:33:06,547
So I made a lot of porridge, just in case.

461
00:33:06,847 --> 00:33:09,077
I thought your father might be having a hard time, too.

462

My dad?

463
00:33:16,457 --> 00:33:18,427
Actually, it was my dad who told me to make a lot.

464
00:33:18,787 --> 00:33:20,157
I was just following orders.

465
00:33:22,527 --> 00:33:25,867
Stick it in the fridge and heat it up in the morning.

466
00:33:26,527 --> 00:33:27,537

do you want to work together in the conference room?

472
00:34:11,777 --> 00:34:14,147
You know we'd never get any work done.

473
00:34:15,347 --> 00:34:18,587
I'll ask the CEO to let it slide.

474
00:34:19,547 --> 00:34:22,817
Go home on our own time, and don't let this affect our work.

475
00:34:23,757 --> 00:34:25,557
We literally just set those rules.

476
00:34:25,627 --> 00:34:27,257
(We literally just set those rules.)

477
00:34:27,527 --> 00:34:29,097
Fine, you got me.

478
00:34:34,137 --> 00:34:35,967
Do you want to come see me for a bit?

479
00:34:38,767 --> 00:34:39,767
I'd love to.

Honey! Sang Cheol!

481
00:34:45,907 --> 00:34:48,047
What's that smell? Is that bulgogi?

482
00:34:57,657 --> 00:34:58,727
It's not seasoned at all.

483
00:35:08,137 --> 00:35:10,937
We had a lot of meat for bulgogi. Did he make it just for himself?

484
00:35:14,537 --> 00:35:16,077
But he didn't even eat it here.

485
00:35:21,717 --> 00:35:22,847

00:39:25,387 --> 00:39:27,857
Why wouldn't you tell me?

533
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:32,797
- Who are you to hide this from me? - What gives you the right?

534
00:39:38,567 --> 00:39:39,567
Ji Hyuk...

535
00:39:40,807 --> 00:39:42,807
It's what Ji Hyuk wanted.

536
00:39:43,477 --> 00:39:45,747
He was scared of seeing you fall apart like this.

537
00:39:46,877 --> 00:39:48,077
Think about Ji Hyuk.

538
00:39:48,617 --> 00:39:49,617
Are you the one who's dying?

539
00:39:51,317 --> 00:39:52,317
That kid...

540
00:39:53,017 --> 00:39:56,317
He should be having the best time right now.

541
00:39:57,187 --> 00:39:59,457
Can't we just let him enjoy it?

542
00:40:00,727 --> 00:40:05,697
He's finally found someone he loves and wants to spend his life with.

543
00:40:06,367 --> 00:40:08,197
And you're going to burden him with your grief on top of that?

544
00:40:08,797 --> 00:40:10,367
Can you imagine how heavy that would be for him?

545
00:40:12,167 --> 00:40:13,167
So?

546
00:40:14,177 --> 00:40:15,807
You're telling me to pretend I don't know?

547
00:40:16,637 --> 00:40:17,647
Yes!

548
00:40:19,677 --> 00:40:21,047
Can't we just let Ji Hyuk...

549
00:40:21,747 --> 00:40:24,017
forget all this and live a little?

550
00:40:26,317 --> 00:40:28,187
No. I don't think I can.

551
00:40:28,887 --> 00:40:31,827
My heart breaks, and I cry just thinking about it.

552
00:40:32,727 --> 00:40:35,127
How am I supposed to face him and pretend nothing's wrong?

553
00:40:36,327 --> 00:40:37,327
I can't.

554
00:40:38,427 --> 00:40:42,697
How could I? How can you even ask me to?

555
00:40:43,397 --> 00:40:44,607
You're his mother. You have to bear it.

556
00:40:45,967 --> 00:40:48,507
You're his mother, so do it. Bear it!

557
00:40:49,907 --> 00:40:52,907
Ji Hyuk leaves for work early in the morning,

558
00:40:53,407 --> 00:40:55,347
and he gets home late at night, you hear?

559
00:40:55,877 --> 00:40:56,877
So all you have to do is...

560
00:40:57,617 --> 00:41:00,717
say a quick hello and go to your room. Got it?

561
00:41:02,757 --> 00:41:05,257
No. I refuse.

562
00:41:05,887 --> 00:41:09,157
I'll take him to every hospital in this country.

563
00:41:09,827 --> 00:41:10,997
And I'll be the one making his meals.

564
00:41:13,967 --> 00:41:16,897
Honey, I'm his mother.

565
00:41:19,537 --> 00:41:21,977
Honey, I am his mother!

566
00:41:23,437 --> 00:41:25,947
And I'm supposed to let him leave with a lunch you packed?

567
00:41:26,907 --> 00:41:28,247
Oh, Ji Hyuk!

568
00:41:38,427 --> 00:41:42,327
What do I do...

569
00:41:50,167 --> 00:41:52,437
Honey, what are we going to do?

570
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:56,077
What's going to happen to our Ji Hyuk?

571
00:42:01,117 --> 00:42:02,747
- I'm home. - What?

572
00:42:02,817 --> 00:42:04,547
- My gosh, Dad. - Yes.

573
00:42:04,947 --> 00:42:06,147
Anyway, where's Mom?

574
00:42:06,147 --> 00:42:08,457
Your mom was tired, so she went to bed early.

575
00:42:10,317 --> 00:42:11,327
I see.

576
00:42:12,057 --> 00:42:13,057
Dad.

577
00:42:13,857 --> 00:42:15,897
That bulgogi rice bowl was amazing.

578
00:42:16,427 --> 00:42:18,227
Eun Oh loved it.

579
00:42:18,527 --> 00:42:21,137
Oh, really? Good, I'm glad.

580
00:42:21,597 --> 00:42:22,737
Go on and get some rest.

581
00:42:23,137 --> 00:42:25,567
And sometime this week when Ji Wan is free,

582
00:42:25,907 --> 00:42:26,937
I'll have the rooms swapped.

583
00:42:30,507 --> 00:42:32,147
Okay, thank you, Dad.

584
00:43:12,987 --> 00:43:15,557
I thought you said you already ate. Why are you eating porridge?

585
00:43:16,387 --> 00:43:17,387
Oh, right.

586
00:43:17,827 --> 00:43:19,487
Dad, this was for tomorrow's breakfast,

587
00:43:21,127 --> 00:43:22,227
but would you like some now?

588
00:43:23,397 --> 00:43:26,267
I was feeling a little peckish.

589
00:43:26,797 --> 00:43:27,797
Sure.

590
00:43:35,777 --> 00:43:37,247
- How is it? - What?

591
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:38,607
Is it to your liking?

592
00:43:39,047 --> 00:43:41,117
Yes. It's actually pretty good.

593
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:44,447
The housekeeper is quite the cook, isn't she?

594
00:43:45,447 --> 00:43:46,787
The housekeeper didn't make this.

595
00:43:47,887 --> 00:43:48,887
Then who did?

596
00:43:50,627 --> 00:43:51,627
Su Bin did.

597
00:43:52,757 --> 00:43:53,757
I think she saw the article about me.

598
00:43:54,297 --> 00:43:55,457
She brought it for me.

599
00:43:59,167 --> 00:44:01,067
Have you two been seeing each other behind my back?

600
00:44:03,497 --> 00:44:04,507
No.

601
00:44:05,207 --> 00:44:06,207
But...

602
00:44:07,307 --> 00:44:08,507
I'm thinking of giving her another shot.

603
00:44:17,217 --> 00:44:19,747
I'm surprised a young woman can make porridge this well.

604
00:44:23,927 --> 00:44:25,657
From what I noticed when I met her,

605
00:44:26,187 --> 00:44:27,427
she seemed like a fine young woman.

606
00:44:35,497 --> 00:44:36,497
Dad.

607
00:44:37,067 --> 00:44:38,067
Would you like another bowl?

608
00:44:38,367 --> 00:44:39,367
Yes.

609
00:44:43,607 --> 00:44:44,607
Here, let me.

610
00:44:53,247 --> 00:44:54,957
My father really enjoyed it, too.

611
00:44:56,057 --> 00:44:57,427
When he first met you,

612
00:44:58,187 --> 00:44:59,487
he took a real liking to you.

613
00:45:00,527 --> 00:45:01,527
Really?

614
00:45:02,927 --> 00:45:03,927
I'm so relieved.

615
00:45:21,217 --> 00:45:24,747
Oh, my son! Look how handsome you are!

616
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:27,087
Hey, Mom.

617
00:45:27,857 --> 00:45:29,317
Why is your face so puffy?

618
00:45:30,557 --> 00:45:32,787
I was tired yesterday, so I went to bed early,

619
00:45:33,127 --> 00:45:34,127
but I guess I overslept.

620
00:45:34,427 --> 00:45:37,567
I see. Mom, when was your last physical?

621
00:45:38,067 --> 00:45:40,637
I had one last year. Now, hurry up and get going.

622
00:45:41,167 --> 00:45:42,967
Come on, at least get a blood test.

623
00:45:43,197 --> 00:45:45,337
- All right. - Okay, I'm off.

624
00:45:47,637 --> 00:45:48,807
Have a great date.

625
00:45:59,447 --> 00:46:00,547
You held it together well.

626
00:46:01,687 --> 00:46:02,687
I'm proud of you.

627
00:46:05,957 --> 00:46:07,057
Was that really the right thing to do?

628
00:46:08,897 --> 00:46:11,927
You saw how happy he was just now.

629
00:46:13,167 --> 00:46:16,437
He's having the time of his life right now,

630
00:46:17,297 --> 00:46:20,007
and if he finds out what you know, it'll all stop right then and there.

631
00:46:21,307 --> 00:46:23,537
Let's not be the ones to take that happiness away from him.

632
00:46:26,947 --> 00:46:28,577
Okay, all right.

633
00:46:29,177 --> 00:46:30,217
I get it.

634
00:46:32,317 --> 00:46:34,117
I understand now that I've seen his face.

635
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:46,127
(Solnae Mansion)

636
00:46:56,037 --> 00:46:57,237
Who is this?

637
00:46:58,347 --> 00:47:00,507
I'm Lee Ji Hyuk's girlfriend.

638
00:47:02,647 --> 00:47:03,817
Why are you laughing?

639
00:47:04,187 --> 00:47:06,987
Just hearing you say you're my girlfriend.

640
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:09,287
Get in.

641
00:47:26,407 --> 00:47:27,477
Which one do you think is the prettiest?

642
00:47:54,837 --> 00:47:55,837
Look at the painting.

643
00:47:56,437 --> 00:47:57,467
Why are you looking at me?

644
00:47:58,367 --> 00:47:59,367
What?

645
00:47:59,667 --> 00:48:02,637
I was looking at that painting over there.

646
00:48:04,407 --> 00:48:07,407
You admire them from a distance, do you?

647
00:48:07,817 --> 00:48:10,247
So what, you think your face...

648
00:48:10,477 --> 00:48:12,747
is prettier than that painting or something?

649
00:48:17,687 --> 00:48:20,027
So you're saying you don't like your boyfriend's face?

650
00:48:25,067 --> 00:48:27,367
What? Eun Oh, aren't you going to answer me?

651
00:48:34,207 --> 00:48:35,207
Here.

652
00:48:37,277 --> 00:48:39,047
You should've started liking me sooner.

653
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:44,917
When would you have wanted me to start liking you?

654
00:48:48,857 --> 00:48:50,787
The winter of my first year on the job.

655
00:48:51,427 --> 00:48:53,487
That's when I started to like you.

656
00:48:54,457 --> 00:48:55,897
It started way back then?

657
00:48:56,457 --> 00:48:59,967
- Why? - At the club's year-end party.

658
00:49:00,127 --> 00:49:03,867
Remember, Kim Jong Sik was there? The guy four years ahead of you.

659
00:49:04,207 --> 00:49:05,967
That was the first time I'd ever met him.

660
00:49:07,537 --> 00:49:12,077
The guy who was hitting on you? And?

661
00:49:12,907 --> 00:49:15,577
He waited for me to come out of the restroom...

662
00:49:16,017 --> 00:49:18,647
and asked me to a musical on Christmas.

663
00:49:19,217 --> 00:49:21,817
So I shut him down right away, but...

664
00:49:22,087 --> 00:49:23,917
he just wouldn't let it go.

665
00:49:24,957 --> 00:49:28,097
He was an intimidating senior, so I was in a really awkward spot.

666
00:49:29,457 --> 00:49:31,897
And then, you showed up, just like that.

667
00:49:33,497 --> 00:49:36,197
I remember telling him to stop.

668
00:49:37,267 --> 00:49:39,937
"Knock it off. She said she's not interested."

669
00:49:40,467 --> 00:49:41,577
And then, that guy said,

670
00:49:42,237 --> 00:49:44,137
"What's this? Are you two dating?"

671
00:49:45,077 --> 00:49:48,017
"Ji Eun Oh, you just lead people on, don't you?"

672
00:49:48,717 --> 00:49:50,577
That's why I was about to hit him.

673
00:49:51,117 --> 00:49:53,547
No, what you did was even cooler than hitting him.

674
00:49:54,657 --> 00:49:58,327
"She's not someone you can treat so sleazily."

675
00:49:58,587 --> 00:50:01,897
"I can't stand to watch it, so stop it right now."

676
00:50:02,397 --> 00:50:04,497
"Because she's a junior I really care about."

677
00:50:06,427 --> 00:50:08,697
Wow, you remember all that?

678
00:50:09,937 --> 00:50:12,107
In that moment, my heart just skipped a beat.

679
00:50:12,837 --> 00:50:14,537
It did.

680
00:50:16,307 --> 00:50:19,277
You were always the type who couldn't stand injustice,

681
00:50:20,747 --> 00:50:21,747
but that day...

682
00:50:22,617 --> 00:50:24,617
Why did you seem so different to me?

683
00:50:27,587 --> 00:50:28,787
So that was the day.

684
00:50:30,057 --> 00:50:31,057
You've waited a long time.

685
00:50:33,587 --> 00:50:34,957
I'm sorry for giving you a hard time.

686
00:50:42,397 --> 00:50:43,997
Being with you like this...

687
00:50:45,607 --> 00:50:47,007
feels like a dream.

688
00:51:05,327 --> 00:51:07,187
(Lee Mi Yeong)

689
00:51:07,357 --> 00:51:09,227
- Min Ah. - Yes?

690
00:51:09,297 --> 00:51:12,767
The guest I'm serving in room three. He's single, right?

691
00:51:21,137 --> 00:51:22,137
What?

692
00:51:22,877 --> 00:51:24,347
Why do I get two drinks?

693
00:51:24,907 --> 00:51:28,817
It's because your voice sounded a little hoarse.

694
00:51:30,047 --> 00:51:31,417
It's homemade.

695
00:51:31,687 --> 00:51:34,617
Drink it before you get a bad cold. It'll help your throat.

696
00:51:35,017 --> 00:51:37,787
Wow, that's very thoughtful of you.

697
00:51:37,927 --> 00:51:40,387
Thanks. My throat was actually feeling a little scratchy.

698
00:51:40,997 --> 00:51:43,257
So, are you new here?

699
00:51:43,757 --> 00:51:44,767
Yes.

700
00:51:45,027 --> 00:51:47,267
So I'm sure my service wasn't perfect.

701
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:50,137
What? That's not the case at all. Hold on.

702
00:51:53,767 --> 00:51:54,807
For the ginger tea.

703
00:51:55,107 --> 00:51:57,407
No. You really don't have to. It's just...

704
00:51:58,147 --> 00:51:59,477
No, here you go.

705
00:52:00,747 --> 00:52:03,177
Come on, just put your money away. All right?

706
00:52:12,187 --> 00:52:16,157
You've found no trace of them, and you want more money already?

707
00:52:16,727 --> 00:52:19,597
You gave us a lot of targets to track, ma'am.

708
00:52:20,367 --> 00:52:22,667
We're stretched thin tracking the family, too.

709
00:52:23,837 --> 00:52:25,137
I'll wire you 1,000 dollars.

710
00:52:25,507 --> 00:52:28,277
But you have to find them within a month.

711
00:52:29,137 --> 00:52:31,877
Once you find out where they are, I don't care how you do it.

712
00:52:32,247 --> 00:52:33,907
Make sure you keep them there. Got it?

713
00:52:40,987 --> 00:52:41,987
I'm home.

714
00:52:42,257 --> 00:52:43,757
Hey, you're back.

715
00:52:44,257 --> 00:52:47,027
So, how was your date? Did you have fun?

716
00:52:47,957 --> 00:52:49,527
What's with all the questions?

717
00:52:50,427 --> 00:52:53,297
- Where's Mom? - She has a bit of a cold.

718
00:52:54,697 --> 00:52:58,307
Ji Hyuk. How was your date? Was it fun?

719
00:53:00,137 --> 00:53:02,237
Since you're asking, Mom, I should answer.

720
00:53:05,147 --> 00:53:06,207
It was interesting.

721
00:53:07,707 --> 00:53:12,187
My junior becoming my girlfriend... How do I put it?

722
00:53:14,217 --> 00:53:15,957
It was just... It was nice.

723
00:53:17,827 --> 00:53:18,927
Really?

724
00:53:24,597 --> 00:53:25,927
Ji Hyuk, you go on ahead.

725
00:53:28,937 --> 00:53:31,437
Go on, hurry. Shoot...

726
00:53:31,767 --> 00:53:33,337
I forgot to wash the rice.

727
00:54:06,267 --> 00:54:07,267
Mom.

728
00:54:10,437 --> 00:54:11,447
I'm sorry.

729
00:54:14,007 --> 00:54:15,017
What?

730
00:54:15,847 --> 00:54:16,847
For what?

731
00:54:19,387 --> 00:54:20,387
I'm sorry.

732
00:54:23,687 --> 00:54:24,787
And thank you.

733
00:54:32,867 --> 00:54:34,027
My big boy...

734
00:54:34,837 --> 00:54:35,997
You've really grown up.

735
00:54:38,737 --> 00:54:40,467
To think you can apologize and thank someone...

736
00:54:41,477 --> 00:54:43,307
all in one breath.

737
00:54:48,277 --> 00:54:50,077
That's all thanks to you and Dad.

738
00:54:54,417 --> 00:54:55,487
That's right.

739
00:54:56,917 --> 00:54:59,287
Come here, let me give my grown-up son a hug.

740
00:55:28,017 --> 00:55:29,057
Mom.

741
00:55:33,457 --> 00:55:34,527
I'm okay.

742
00:55:40,397 --> 00:55:41,467
I'm really okay.

743
00:55:57,847 --> 00:55:59,347
That perceptive kid.

744
00:56:00,147 --> 00:56:01,657
He figured it out after all.

745
00:56:02,387 --> 00:56:04,187
And his mom was so good at hiding it.

746
00:56:23,577 --> 00:56:24,977
So Mom found out, too.

747
00:56:38,987 --> 00:56:41,127
- Ji Hyuk, by any chance... - Dad.

748
00:56:42,927 --> 00:56:45,567
Don't you start apologizing, too.

749
00:56:46,967 --> 00:56:49,367
Mom must have caught on.

750
00:56:50,697 --> 00:56:54,907
Yes. Your mom's intuition is uncanny.

751
00:56:57,507 --> 00:56:58,647
Thanks, Dad.

752
00:57:01,107 --> 00:57:03,677
I can only imagine how hard you must've tried to convince Mom.

753
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:09,457
Dad, you weren't too harsh on Mom?

754
00:57:10,317 --> 00:57:11,327
You...

755
00:57:11,987 --> 00:57:13,757
How can you be so okay with this?

756
00:57:15,227 --> 00:57:18,327
There's no way you can be okay. How can you be so calm about it?

757
00:57:19,927 --> 00:57:21,297
Don't you feel it's unfair?

758
00:57:22,097 --> 00:57:24,537
Having a father like me, you've suffered so much,

759
00:57:24,767 --> 00:57:27,107
and after going through all that, just when life was looking up...

760
00:57:28,277 --> 00:57:29,777
How can you be so nonchalant?

761
00:57:31,347 --> 00:57:34,277
Hey, kid. Forget about your mom and everyone else. Who cares?

762
00:57:34,607 --> 00:57:38,217
Just say what's on your mind. Get angry, get frustrated,

763
00:57:38,287 --> 00:57:39,487
and cry when you want to cry.

764
00:57:40,887 --> 00:57:42,457
Stop overthinking it.

765
00:57:43,857 --> 00:57:45,827
Just live how you want to live, you knucklehead.

766
00:57:49,757 --> 00:57:53,167
But this is me, doing exactly what I want.

767
00:57:53,797 --> 00:57:55,037
And I'll keep doing that.

768
00:57:56,567 --> 00:58:00,407
You're the one who needs to stop overreacting.

769
00:58:13,087 --> 00:58:14,087
Dad.

770
00:58:19,857 --> 00:58:21,997
- Okay. - I'm okay.

771
00:58:22,627 --> 00:58:24,897
My son's all grown up.

772
00:58:44,947 --> 00:58:46,817
(Shoealls)

773
00:58:46,887 --> 00:58:49,757
So if you leave today, you won't be back for a year?

774
00:58:50,787 --> 00:58:51,787
That's right.

775
00:58:54,387 --> 00:58:56,697
Thank you for raising me, Dad.

776
00:59:00,497 --> 00:59:01,967
And I'm so sorry for everything.

777
00:59:03,537 --> 00:59:04,597
Don't be.

778
00:59:05,237 --> 00:59:06,507
I'm sorry, too.

779
00:59:08,307 --> 00:59:11,707
For whatever reason, I failed to be a proper father...

780
00:59:12,947 --> 00:59:13,977
to you.

781
00:59:14,747 --> 00:59:18,077
I didn't feel the same way about you as I did about Seong Jae.

782
00:59:18,347 --> 00:59:19,347
But...

783
00:59:21,247 --> 00:59:22,987
I did raise you as my own son.

784
00:59:23,317 --> 00:59:24,517
Don't you forget that.

785
00:59:27,687 --> 00:59:28,727
I won't.

786
00:59:31,567 --> 00:59:32,867
Take care of yourself, Dad.

787
00:59:33,667 --> 00:59:34,667
You, too.

788
00:59:40,537 --> 00:59:42,077
- Enjoy your meal. - Thank you.

789
00:59:42,137 --> 00:59:43,137
Thank you.

790
00:59:44,137 --> 00:59:45,147
Eun Oh.

791
00:59:50,977 --> 00:59:53,317
If your flight's tonight, you should've come a few days ago.

792
00:59:53,587 --> 00:59:54,987
Why take the first train this morning?

793
00:59:56,257 --> 00:59:57,717
Woo Jin, you must be exhausted.

794
00:59:58,057 --> 01:00:00,557
I'm fine. I'll just sleep on the plane.

795
01:00:00,757 --> 01:00:02,057
Besides, I'm well-rested.

796
01:00:02,927 --> 01:00:05,297
You said you transferred and are restarting your MBA, right?

797
01:00:05,867 --> 01:00:08,197
Yes. The program's focus is a much better fit for me.

798
01:00:08,637 --> 01:00:10,367
So you haven't decided if you're coming back to Korea yet?

799
01:00:11,397 --> 01:00:12,667
After I graduate,

800
01:00:12,937 --> 01:00:16,337
- I plan to work abroad for a while. - I see.

801
01:00:16,977 --> 01:00:17,977
That's so cool!

802
01:00:18,247 --> 01:00:19,907
Now, I have a brother who lives abroad!

803
01:00:22,747 --> 01:00:24,017
I'm sorry, Yeong Ra.

804
01:00:24,717 --> 01:00:26,217
I wasn't much of an older brother to you.

805
01:00:27,617 --> 01:00:28,617
It's okay.

806
01:00:29,287 --> 01:00:31,387
Seong Jae and my dad...

807
01:00:31,857 --> 01:00:35,357
They were both so under Mom's thumb, none of us could get close.

808
01:00:36,397 --> 01:00:37,727
It wasn't your fault.

809
01:00:40,867 --> 01:00:41,867
Woo Jin.

810
01:00:42,697 --> 01:00:43,867
What about your mother?

811
01:00:47,337 --> 01:00:52,077
Mi Yeong, can you take room three? They specifically requested you.

812
01:00:52,647 --> 01:00:53,647
They did?

813
01:00:55,977 --> 01:00:57,247
Could it be Mr. Hwang?

814
01:01:11,897 --> 01:01:13,527
I'll start you with some hot towels.

815
01:01:14,727 --> 01:01:15,737
As for your order,

816
01:01:16,097 --> 01:01:18,267
please press the call button when your party is complete.

817
01:01:22,137 --> 01:01:23,537
No more ginger tea?

818
01:01:25,347 --> 01:01:26,677
Did you switch to that herbal tea?

819
01:01:30,547 --> 01:01:33,047
You never thought I'd show up here, did you?

820
01:01:34,957 --> 01:01:36,157
(Lee Mi Yeong)

821
01:01:36,817 --> 01:01:38,017
Ms. Lee Mi Yeong?

822
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:44,297
Coming all the way here? That's a low blow, don't you think?

823
01:01:45,097 --> 01:01:46,867
I came because I knew you'd be here.

824
01:01:48,437 --> 01:01:50,837
You said to hit rock bottom again, like when I first met you.

825
01:01:50,937 --> 01:01:52,067
So, here I am.

826
01:01:52,967 --> 01:01:53,967
This is your rock bottom?

827
01:01:55,137 --> 01:01:58,907
You're not divorced, so you can't just find a new man.

828
01:01:59,377 --> 01:02:00,547
You're here to get your hands on some money.

829
01:02:02,247 --> 01:02:04,447
You're probably looking for some single guy with money.

830
01:02:04,877 --> 01:02:07,417
Once you get his heart racing for you,

831
01:02:07,787 --> 01:02:09,817
you'll feed him some sob story,

832
01:02:10,587 --> 01:02:12,187
and he'll lend you the money, won't he?

833
01:02:13,487 --> 01:02:18,397
But what would our dear Ko Seong Hui need all that money for?

834
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:22,297
Are you playing the victim?

835
01:02:23,197 --> 01:02:25,207
Or are you still not over me?

836
01:02:26,207 --> 01:02:30,677
Even if you borrow money around here to try and find Park Jin Seok,

837
01:02:30,877 --> 01:02:32,147
you'll never find him.

838
01:02:33,807 --> 01:02:36,517
Why don't you just save up your tips and get a room?

839
01:02:38,947 --> 01:02:40,917
Do you still have people watching me?

840
01:02:44,087 --> 01:02:48,757
That's because you refuse to go back to the gutter where you belong.

841
01:02:51,497 --> 01:02:54,597
I told you not to set such pointless goals.

842
01:02:55,667 --> 01:02:59,467
As long as you have a goal, I'll never stop being angry.

843
01:03:04,077 --> 01:03:05,707
You're not staying to eat, are you?

844
01:03:06,507 --> 01:03:08,947
At least pay for your meal and go.

845
01:03:10,077 --> 01:03:11,377
I'm staying for dinner.

846
01:03:13,247 --> 01:03:17,217
So what's the best set course here? Well? Give me a recommendation.

847
01:03:23,427 --> 01:03:25,267
You crazy jerk.

848
01:03:34,767 --> 01:03:35,807
(Lee Mi Yeong)

849
01:03:36,407 --> 01:03:38,747
Mi Yeong, what do you think you're doing?

850
01:03:39,177 --> 01:03:40,277
I quit.

851
01:03:46,717 --> 01:03:49,317
Mom, I'm leaving.

852
01:03:49,987 --> 01:03:51,057
I'm at the airport now.

853
01:03:52,257 --> 01:03:53,357
Take care.

854
01:03:54,257 --> 01:03:56,697
No! Woo Jin.

855
01:03:56,697 --> 01:03:57,797
(My Son, Woo Jin)

856
01:04:00,297 --> 01:04:03,597
The phone is turned off. You'll be connected to voicemail.

857
01:04:03,767 --> 01:04:06,907
- Please leave... - If you leave me, too...

858
01:04:21,287 --> 01:04:22,757
I'm so happy today.

859
01:04:24,617 --> 01:04:25,627
Me, too.

860
01:04:38,097 --> 01:04:41,737
You're driving, so only for three seconds.

861
01:04:42,277 --> 01:04:43,907
- Three seconds? - Yes.

862
01:04:44,637 --> 01:04:45,647
Okay.

863
01:04:53,917 --> 01:04:57,387
What? Ji Hyuk? What's wrong? Ji Hyuk!

864
01:04:58,857 --> 01:04:59,857
Hold on...

865
01:05:04,257 --> 01:05:06,927
Ji Hyuk! Are you okay?

866
01:05:06,997 --> 01:05:09,697
- I can't breathe... - Oh, no.

867
01:05:09,697 --> 01:05:13,437
Ji Hyuk! Stay with me! Ji Hyuk!

868
01:05:28,047 --> 01:05:30,257
- Dad. - Yes?

869
01:05:31,587 --> 01:05:33,527
Ko Seong Hui sent me a text.

870
01:05:35,027 --> 01:05:37,897
She says she has something important to tell you.

871
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:41,127
She says she's at the front gate right now.

872
01:05:42,697 --> 01:05:43,697
Really?

873
01:05:44,537 --> 01:05:45,807
Let her in.

874
01:05:47,067 --> 01:05:48,237
You want me to let her in?

875
01:05:49,137 --> 01:05:50,337
She said she has something to say.

876
01:06:03,487 --> 01:06:06,057
- I'll head upstairs. - No, you stay here.

877
01:06:18,937 --> 01:06:19,937
Honey.

878
01:06:21,737 --> 01:06:24,537
I was so wrong.

879
01:07:08,587 --> 01:07:11,157
(Our Golden Days)

880
01:07:11,317 --> 01:07:15,927
What's wrong? Do you know them? You should only be looking at me.

881
01:07:15,997 --> 01:07:18,927
Did it ever occur to you that I lied because I loved you?

882
01:07:18,997 --> 01:07:21,827
Forget it, honey. You're finished now.

883
01:07:21,937 --> 01:07:25,767
I bet we're the only couple with a wedding night like this.

884
01:07:25,837 --> 01:07:29,177
Can't he last a month more on ECMO? You never know what might happen.

885
01:07:29,237 --> 01:07:31,037
Miracles do happen, you know.

886
01:07:31,107 --> 01:07:33,377
Stab me. I'll rip my own heart out.

887
01:07:33,447 --> 01:07:36,847
I can't let Ji Hyuk go. I can't.

888
01:07:36,917 --> 01:07:39,817
Give me a burial at sea, just like my grandmother.

889
01:07:40,187 --> 01:07:43,357
Whenever you go to the ocean, think of me.

890
01:07:44,017 --> 01:07:45,087
Thank you for everything.
