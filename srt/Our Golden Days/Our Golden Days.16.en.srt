1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,110
- Ji Hyuk!
- My gosh. You came.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:05,810
I'm back.

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,380
Grandma, Mom.

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:09,510
What do you mean, you're back?

5
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:14,250
- I mean I'm home, Mom.
- So you came back for good?

6
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:15,690
That's right.

7
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,960
I've come back
to live with you again.

8
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,290
- Oh, that's wonderful. I'm so glad.
- Ji Hyuk.

9
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:23,700
Oh, I'm so glad.
Where have you been all this time?

10
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,200
I even tried texting and calling
from numbers you wouldn't recognize,

11
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,230
but you just went
and changed your number.

12
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:32,600
- I'm sorry.
- I'm just so glad you're home.

13
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:33,710
Ji Hyuk!

14
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,410
- What's going on?
- It's so good to have you back.

15
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:38,710
- Ji Hyuk!
- Hey, Ji Wan. Can you get my bags?

16
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,710
Oh, my goodness. Just look at me.

17
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,680
- Goodness me.
- But what's with this suitcase?

18
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,750
- Your brother's home for good.
- Really? He's going to live here?

19
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,090
What? After I lugged
your heavy bags for you?

20
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:56,190
- What's this?
- This? It's for Mom and Grandma.

21
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,370
My gosh, you didn't have to
get us anything.

22
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,800
- Thank you, Ji Hyuk.
- Don't mention it.

23
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:27,830
It's all for you. Eat up.

24
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:34,100
Mom, I don't deserve all this.
You really went all out.

25
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:36,500
I feel so guilty.

26
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:39,440
You came back to us in one piece.

27
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,570
What?

28
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:46,040
You don't mean you all thought
something had happened to me?

29
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,550
What else were we supposed to think?

30
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,780
After you went and changed
your phone number.

31
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,180
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:53,950
I really am sorry.

33
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,460
- At the time, I just...
- It's okay.

34
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:00,290
I'm just so happy
you walked back in on your own.

35
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,030
Come on. You thought
he was just dropping in for a meal.

36
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,030
That's what I thought,

37
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,770
but I'm so proud
he made this decision.

38
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,940
How did you come to
such a mature decision?

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,300
You're proud of me?

40
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,770
Mom, are you feeling all right?

41
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,240
Seriously, why would you be proud
of a brat like me?

42
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,350
Hey. For a parent,
nothing else matters.

43
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,450
What matters is that
my child has come home safe.

44
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,750
That's the most important thing.

45
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,920
That doesn't mean you're completely
off the hook, though.

46
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,330
I know.

47
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,560
I can finally relax,
knowing you'll be living at home.

48
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,500
Right, Mother?

49
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,440
It feels like my feet are finally
back on solid ground.

50
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,140
But where's Dad?

51
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,140
Is he avoiding me because I'm back?

52
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,950
No. He doesn't know you're here.

53
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:58,750
Dad's going to a prep school
for an Electrical Tech license.

54
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,720
To be an electrical technician?
But Dad's a humanities guy.

55
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,660
After he gets the license and gets
about a year of work experience,

56
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,060
he'll get an industrial electrician
certification as well.

57
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,500
When's the exam?

58
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,430
Whenever I ask him,
he just says it's still a ways off.

59
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,570
Okay, enough talk.
The eel is getting cold.

60
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,280
- Go on and eat, Ji Hyuk.
- Yes, let's eat.

61
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,410
- You should eat too, Mother.
- Thank you for the meal.

62
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,480
- It's eel!
- This looks delicious.

63
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,620
This is so good
it's making me tear up.

64
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,360
- Let's try some.
- You have the first bite.

65
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,890
It's delicious, Mom.

66
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,260
Hey, you.

67
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,130
You haven't had dinner, have you?

68
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:51,670
- I already ate.
- Was that pastry all you're having?

69
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,070
Let's go grab some dinner together.

70
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,010
I'm not hungry.

71
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,950
Your stomach says you are.

72
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:08,790
How about some gukbap and soju?
What do you say?

73
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,790
I'll just eat when I get home.

74
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,930
What kind of business are you doing?
Where did you even get the money?

75
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,870
I'm not using my own money.
I have investors.

76
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,410
Investors?

77
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,370
Oh, so it must be going well then.

78
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:33,340
Su Bin, let's talk about all this
later, okay?

79
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,950
Yes, lay off. What's important is
he's back and healthy.

80
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,720
Ji Wan.
Listen to you, what a hypocrite.

81
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,650
You were the one who talked
the most trash about him.

82
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,420
Hey, that was different.

83
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:48,090
Hey, it's time for me to head back.

84
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,900
Right, you normally work late.
How long will you be doing this?

85
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,870
Actually,
it's a pretty good fit for me.

86
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,430
The driving part?

87
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:01,210
No, driving isn't my main focus.
My main job is being a bodyguard.

88
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,870
I'm heading out.

89
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,410
- You, little...
- Bye.

90
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,450
Look at him go. He never sits still.

91
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,850
I guess Ji Wan really must enjoy it.

92
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,290
Maybe since he works for Seong Jae,
Ji Wan is taking this seriously.

93
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,190
He has to be there by 9 a.m.,
but he always leaves at 8 a.m.

94
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,360
Ji Hyuk. So, this whole time...
Where were you?

95
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,130
Am I not even supposed
to ask you that?

96
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,470
Please, just drop it.

97
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,970
Man, I'm starving today.

98
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,850
This is delicious, right?

99
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,850
It's been a while.

100
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,820
- Is Ji Wan back already?
- It's been a long time, right?

101
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:49,720
- I'll get this.
- Oh, honestly...

102
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:58,800
Sang Cheol,
you came home so early today.

103
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:02,770
- Yes. What's going on, honey?
- Dad! Ji Hyuk's here.

104
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,500
I'm home, Father.

105
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,710
What are you doing in my house?

106
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,070
Honey.

107
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,540
For everything...

108
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,510
- I'm sorry for everything.
- Well, forget all that.

109
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,920
Answer my question.
What are you doing in my house?

110
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,990
It was time for me to come home.

111
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:25,490
What? Time to come home?
What do you mean, "It was time?"

112
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,360
What are you doing waltzing in here?
Who said you could?

113
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,990
I didn't come back for your sake,
Father.

114
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,730
I came back for Mom.

115
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:35,530
Doesn't Mom own half of this house?

116
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,100
Even if your name is on the deed.

117
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:39,670
What? What did you just say?

118
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:44,780
You don't think this house is yours
just because you paid, do you?

119
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:48,580
Hey, I've never even thought that,
you little punk.

120
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,020
Then we're good.

121
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,920
What do you mean, "we're good?"

122
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,990
This brat still thinks he's right.

123
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:59,620
Not being right
isn't the same as being wrong.

124
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,630
You're saying
you weren't in the wrong?

125
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,930
So you think
you can leave on a whim...

126
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,130
and just waltz back
in as you please?

127
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:11,340
- I'm sorry.
- Sang Cheol, that's enough.

128
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,570
She's right.

129
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,710
Ji Hyuk, why don't you
just go upstairs?

130
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,740
- I'll just go upstairs.
- Where do you think you're going?

131
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,110
Oh, is that right?

132
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,650
A 50-percent stake. Fine. I get it.

133
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:27,290
But in return,
while you are in this house,

134
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,850
stay out of my sight, you brat!

135
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,770
Dinner is ready in the kitchen.
Come and eat.

136
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,880
Why didn't you tell me?
Did you decide this all on your own?

137
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:55,280
How could you let him in this house
without saying a single word to me?

138
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,390
I bought eel to cook for you,
but you said you weren't coming.

139
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,720
Suddenly, I thought of Ji Hyuk.

140
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:09,390
So I called him on the off chance
he could come over and eat.

141
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,930
While you were going to be out.
Yes, to feed him and see how he was.

142
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,930
But he showed up
with his bags all packed.

143
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:21,540
So you didn't beg him
to move back in?

144
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,140
I didn't.

145
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:27,040
But I thought it was a good chance
for you to see Ji Hyuk too,

146
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,850
so that's why I called you again.

147
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,850
I feared you wouldn't come if I said
Ji Hyuk was here beforehand.

148
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,620
No, but before you welcomed him back
with open arms,

149
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:38,660
you should have told him
you'd have to talk to me first.

150
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,230
How could you say that
about our son who just came home?

151
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,660
You know what? Let's just drop it.

152
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:48,430
We chose to have him.
Did he ask to be born?

153
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:50,970
What?

154
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:52,670
You know it's true.

155
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,840
So no matter what,

156
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,310
we're responsible for him
because he's our child.

157
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,750
Whatever.
You've got it all figured out.

158
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,000
Does it smell?

159
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:25,070
- I washed them every week.
- No, I mean it smells nice.

160
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,970
Wait, you washed them every week?

161
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:31,010
Because I never knew
when you'd be back.

162
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,080
I guess this is
one of those moments.

163
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,550
I'm speechless, Mom.

164
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,750
There's so much I want to say,

165
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,790
I just don't know where to begin.

166
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,690
I know.

167
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,560
Don't say anything. It'll come out
when the time's right.

168
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,260
So, Dad wants to be
an electrical technician?

169
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,300
You didn't stop him?
You should have.

170
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,830
How could I? You know how stubborn
your father is.

171
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,700
Once he says he'll do it, he does.
That's your dad for you.

172
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:04,780
Anyway, you should get some rest.
I thought you had an early start.

173
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,740
Yes.

174
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,280
Ji Hyuk.

175
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:15,220
I'm so grateful you've come back
safe and sound.

176
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,010
Hey, stop!

177
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:52,160
What? What are you doing?

178
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,990
I'm taking a shower.

179
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:58,300
What? I really have to go.
How can you just cut in front of me?

180
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:04,600
That doesn't sound like a shower.
I really have to go!

181
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,640
- Grandma! Hurry up!
- What is it?

182
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:14,850
Son, it's me. This is an emergency.
Son!

183
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,580
- Mother?
- Yes, it's me.

184
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,950
Just a second.

185
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:26,120
- Right, okay.
- See? You weren't even showering.

186
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,430
Hey, is there a law that says
you must wash your hair in a shower?

187
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,470
Sang Cheol.

188
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,730
"Mom owns half of this house?"
How dare he.

189
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,070
Then let's split
the bathroom in half. That little...

190
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,650
(Chondroitin 1200 for Your Joints)

191
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,290
What's that? What kind of medicine
are you and Mother taking?

192
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,920
Are you sick?
Mother, are you not feeling well?

193
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:03,190
No, it's a gift from Ji Hyuk.
It's for my sore knees.

194
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,530
Mother has trouble getting up.
How did he know to get this for us?

195
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,170
Do you want some too?

196
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,940
On second thought, no.

197
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,310
He's always running up the mountain
behind the house.

198
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:17,480
Of course.
He even runs half-marathons.

199
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,110
His knees are solid as a rock.

200
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:23,080
Then I guess I don't need any.
I'm fine.

201
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:27,050
You sound a little jealous, though.

202
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,650
Jealous?
You don't understand me at all.

203
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:34,730
This kid, doing whatever it takes
to kiss up to his mom. Incredible.

204
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:38,160
Oh, Ji Hyuk brought some fruit.
Why don't you have some of that?

205
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:40,870
No, Mother. I'm good.
You go ahead and have some.

206
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,410
- Ta-da!
- Oh, my goodness.

207
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,350
It's not your day off.
What's all this for?

208
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:00,750
The Mapo project is finished,
so I don't have to leave so early.

209
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,120
I wanted to make you breakfast
since it's been so long.

210
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,390
Oh, my.

211
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,490
And I have something to tell you.

212
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,860
About what?

213
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:13,230
Let's eat first.
It's nothing serious.

214
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,070
Go on.

215
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:21,540
My daughter makes
the best French toast.

216
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,640
- Mom.
- Yes?

217
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:27,750
So...

218
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,880
You know how I was always worried
about not getting enough work?

219
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,880
Well, I don't have to be anymore.

220
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,050
I'm going into a partnership.

221
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,560
- A partnership?
- Yes.

222
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,530
A company in a similar field
made me an offer,

223
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,560
and I've decided to go
into business with them.

224
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,700
They get lots of turnkey requests,
you see.

225
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,970
But, sweetie.

226
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,940
After your dad's business failed,
you always said...

227
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:57,780
you'd stay on your own
until the business was stable,

228
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,980
then hire one person and stay small.
You wanted to keep it small.

229
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:06,620
So what's this about a partnership?
Why the sudden change of mind?

230
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,750
That's why we're just doing
a three-month trial first.

231
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,790
So let's just leave it at that.

232
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:23,700
Oh, that's right.
I have a breakfast meeting today.

233
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:26,040
- I'll see you later.
- What?

234
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,340
But...

235
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,650
She fixed this whole breakfast,

236
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,010
so what's this
about a breakfast meeting?

237
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,700
I guess
you didn't stay here last night?

238
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,640
I'm not staying here anymore.

239
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:03,340
I'm commuting from home.

240
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,340
You moved back home?

241
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:10,110
You're awfully curious
about your partner's private life,

242
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,520
Ms. Ji.

243
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,390
Let's have a quick meeting.

244
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:24,060
The Gangha-dong apartment client
wants a French-inspired style.

245
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:27,360
I think Designer Kim Ji Seon
would be a good match for them.

246
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,000
And for the Mangin-dong villa,

247
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,570
I was thinking we could assign that
to Designer Lee Ri Na.

248
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,970
I thought you'd pick
your own project first.

249
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,340
You must be waiting
for a specific project.

250
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,010
If it were up to me...

251
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,910
I'd start with this one.

252
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,250
Oh, I see. We haven't heard back
from them yet.

253
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,520
That's right.

254
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,920
All right. I'll tell Mr. Jo
to draw up their contracts.

255
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:57,130
- Is that everything?
- Yes.

256
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,660
What?

257
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,460
What's going on?

258
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:03,570
- Why is everyone in so early?
- What about you?

259
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,100
I have a coffee bean delivery today.

260
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,910
Having a meeting already?

261
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:10,740
Bingo. And it's over.

262
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,210
Oh, by the way,
you're looking well today.

263
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:15,810
I always look this good.

264
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,550
That's not what I meant...

265
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,360
He moved back home.

266
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,920
Oh, really?
He went back to his old place?

267
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,400
- Oh, good morning.
- Right.

268
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,660
Good morning.

269
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:41,070
What's with everyone?
Why are you all such early birds?

270
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,050
Hey, you're in early.

271
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,550
This isn't connected, you see.

272
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:57,390
Then why are you wearing
the headset?

273
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,790
People don't talk to me
when I wear it.

274
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,660
Right, good point.

275
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,030
All right, get to work.
I'll text you if I need anything.

276
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,270
Mom.

277
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,440
We need to go dress shopping.

278
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,610
I have plenty of gowns
to wear to recitals.

279
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:25,920
The Berlin Phil concert
calls for something more elegant.

280
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,720
He didn't say
it was the Berlin Phil.

281
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,160
He asked if I liked classical music,
and when I said yes,

282
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,260
he just suggested
we go see a concert.

283
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:40,060
Hyeonyu Group is the main sponsor
of the Berlin Philharmonic concerts.

284
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,400
I see.

285
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,140
I'll schedule it
for sometime this week.

286
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,540
Okay.

287
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,310
Okay, get ready. All right?

288
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:05,990
My heart just won't stop racing.

289
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,560
And with Yeong Ra's exhibition
coming up,

290
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,700
I'm worried he might show up
and cause a scene.

291
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,130
I even got a prescription
for tranquilizers.

292
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,640
Tranquilizers?

293
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,140
Why didn't you say something sooner?

294
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,770
I was waiting.

295
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,080
You've been so busy lately.

296
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:29,610
I know you always check on me
when you get a chance.

297
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:34,150
I don't care how busy I am.
For you to be this worried,

298
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,050
to the point
where you'd ask for my help...

299
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:38,920
All right. Don't worry.

300
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:47,200
What? Are you telling me
this huge motorcycle just vanished?

301
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:51,030
After we received
that panoramic photo,

302
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,870
I had my team go through
the month's worth of CCTV footage...

303
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,470
that we had stored from that time.

304
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:00,680
But we found
no footage of it leaving.

305
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,720
What, did he hide the darn bike
in his bedroom?

306
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,260
A truck.

307
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,130
Excuse me?

308
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,100
You said
there were no CCTV blind spots...

309
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,730
between the area and the main road.

310
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,230
- Right.
- After the bike went in,

311
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:28,240
have you looked into any trucks
leaving that alley or neighborhood?

312
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,680
- No, we didn't think to...
- Then I want you to check.

313
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,280
If he's not caught by her exhibition
and something happens,

314
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,980
I won't just stand by
and do nothing.

315
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:44,560
(Director Ko Seong Hui)

316
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,560
(Director Yun)

317
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,300
Yes, Director Yun.

318
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,930
Any good news?

319
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,370
Still?

320
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:58,640
I mean, how much longer?

321
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,710
Seriously,
how long do I have to wait?

322
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:07,440
What do you mean it's difficult?
I went out of my way to ask you.

323
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,850
Fine. Understood for now.

324
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:16,120
Darn it.
I'm dead if Park Jin Seok finds out.

325
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,560
So you're forcing me
to go there myself.

326
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,270
Director, Ji Hyuk moved back home.
He'll be commuting from now on.

327
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,300
All of a sudden?

328
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,580
That's great.

329
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,620
Here you go.

330
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,920
- You really don't have to do this.
- Just get in.

331
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:06,270
- Hey, but...
- One month.

332
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:11,740
If I can win him over in a month,
I'll tell him I'll quit my job...

333
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:16,080
to be a full-time content creator.
It's a promise, so let's seal it.

334
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:19,480
Come on.

335
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,620
Your thumb.

336
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,360
Hurry up.

337
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:32,560
- Goodness, this is so childish.
- Hey, wait a minute!

338
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:37,770
Hey. You've been talking
to my brother, haven't you?

339
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,900
- You knew where he was, didn't you?
- Of course, I did.

340
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:44,310
My gosh, I feel totally betrayed.
And you didn't even tell me.

341
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,410
Hey, I'm Ji Hyuk's friend,
not yours.

342
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,180
That's true.

343
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:52,550
Okay, fine. I'll let that one slide,

344
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:56,550
but you can't tell my brother
about this little scheme of ours.

345
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,160
I'm telling you.
Ji Hyuk is home now.

346
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,920
I know that, knucklehead.

347
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,430
I'll give you the rules on the way,
so take notes on your phone.

348
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,330
That's the whole reason
I'm dropping you off nearby.

349
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:10,600
Got it.

350
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:13,770
(Shoealls)

351
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,740
Ms. Lee Su Bin?

352
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,210
Hello. I'm Lee Su Bin.

353
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:23,850
Right this way.

354
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:30,750
Mr. Kang, this is Lee Su Bin.
She'll be joining you as manager.

355
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,490
And Su Bin, this is
Assistant Manager Kang Seong Mo.

356
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,660
Hello. I'm Kang Seong Mo.

357
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,830
I'm Lee Su Bin.
It's a pleasure to work with you.

358
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,760
You can get changed
in the locker room.

359
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:42,330
(Lee Su Bin, Manager)

360
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:44,740
Okay.

361
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:51,810
This client got back to us quickly.
They didn't make you wait.

362
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:53,710
I know.

363
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:58,420
So, what's the problem
they wanted to discuss?

364
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,150
There are 4 bedrooms and 1 bathroom.

365
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,820
They want to remove one bedroom,

366
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:07,660
add another bathroom,
and open up the kitchen.

367
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:10,560
That means we'd have to redo
all the plumbing and wiring.

368
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,000
Sounds like a fun project.

369
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:13,930
And obviously,

370
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,700
the quote was high?

371
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:21,570
But their budget is
only 100,000 dollars.

372
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:25,140
Then we'll have to reduce the work
to fit their budget.

373
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,120
Ms. Ji.

374
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,290
What are you trying to get at?

375
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:40,090
It's an old detached house,

376
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:43,330
and the layout is fascinating,
so I'd love to do it.

377
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:44,960
Exactly.

378
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,760
A 60 to 70-year-old house
with a yard needs...

379
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,100
a complete structural overhaul.

380
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:51,940
It's right up your alley,
I'll admit.

381
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,710
We can cut 20,000 dollars
if we use cheaper materials.

382
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:58,340
Then just have them give up
on moving the kitchen.

383
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,710
Let me do it for the experience.

384
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:05,850
I'll make up for the loss
with other projects.

385
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,180
Ms. Ji Eun Oh.

386
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,220
The client said she hated having
a separate kitchen her whole life.

387
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,560
She moved into this house
right after she got married.

388
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:16,460
Now, she wants to live here
for the rest of her days.

389
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:18,160
For every project
you're in charge of,

390
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:20,430
I get a five percent cut
of the total construction cost.

391
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:24,130
- Right, so on the next one, I'll...
- Why should I?

392
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,070
Ms. Ji Eun Oh.
Are you running a charity?

393
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:30,770
What is this, an art project?

394
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:34,440
My cut is already factored into
the profits of the next project.

395
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:37,310
Why are you giving me an IOU
for my cut?

396
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:40,080
And on our very first project
as partners, no less.

397
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,550
Do you think this partnership is
some after-school club?

398
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,460
I know it isn't.

399
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:48,660
- I know, but...
- Then don't be greedy.

400
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:53,200
- Greedy?
- Is money the only kind of greed?

401
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,470
Insisting on getting your way
is a kind of greed too.

402
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:58,000
Especially with nothing
to show for it.

403
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,140
That five percent
of the official quote.

404
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:07,110
I can just pay you out
of my own pocket, right?

405
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,650
Absolutely not.

406
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,150
- Why not?
- That's not how business works.

407
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,350
And it goes against my principles.

408
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,450
The Suri-dong house project.

409
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:19,260
If they accept the quote,
we'll start.

410
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,360
If they don't, revise the plans...

411
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:24,830
to fit their budget.

412
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,260
My turnkey manager took losses...

413
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,370
working on a project
with my name on it?

414
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:34,140
I won't tolerate rumors like that.
They're here for Mamdaerozip.

415
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:36,370
Just drop it.

416
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,440
I'm going to get some air.

417
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:51,550
So naive. That's why
I wanted you as a partner.

418
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:53,690
Gosh, as if I'm not busy enough.

419
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:13,980
These are the client inquiries
I've sorted for today.

420
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,380
Another group project?

421
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,550
Hyunmyeong Apartments went viral
on the parenting forums.

422
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:24,750
Multiple units doing demolition
and rewiring at the same time...

423
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,420
means all the noise is done at once.
They love that.

424
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:30,190
And our moving company partnership
is a big hit too.

425
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,530
I see. Oh, hey, did you eat dinner?

426
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,440
You bought me a sandwich
when you came back from the site.

427
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:39,940
I did?

428
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,110
Oh, right.

429
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,810
- I'm done for the day.
- Okay, great work.

430
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,850
What the heck? She's still not back?

431
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,920
Come on, we have to finish
our conversation.

432
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:04,630
(Ji Eun Oh)

433
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,100
Gosh, why isn't she picking up?

434
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:17,870
- Well, I'm going to take off.
- Okay. Have a good night.

435
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,940
- See you the day after tomorrow.
- Yes, get home safe.

436
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:21,010
Have a good one.

437
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,620
I didn't come back for your sake,
Father.

438
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:35,430
It was time for me to come home.

439
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:03,720
Oh, my goodness.

440
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,290
If you drink it like this,

441
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,090
you feel like you're drinking a lot
even when you're not.

442
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:12,130
Who in the world drinks beer
with a straw?

443
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,570
Well, there's no law against it.
Go on, try it.

444
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:32,350
When you want a drink
but can't really let loose,

445
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,250
that's when I use a straw.

446
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:37,750
How do you read others so well
when you're still so young?

447
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:42,760
When a man with an exam coming up
isn't even studying...

448
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,430
and is just clutching a beer?
It's a dead giveaway.

449
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,800
So what's your excuse, Ms. Ji?

450
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:50,930
This?

451
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,570
Because I'm incredibly frustrated.

452
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:59,880
You know how it is?
They're right, and you're still mad.

453
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,250
Do I ever.

454
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,580
I sure do.

455
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:06,020
I've got a guy like that
driving me crazy too, so I...

456
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,220
Listen to this old man unloading
all this on you, young lady.

457
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:15,790
Hey, life is frustrating.
What does age have to do with it?

458
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:20,960
So who could possibly get under
our tough manager's skin?

459
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,340
Hey, why isn't Ji Eun Oh back yet?

460
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:32,180
I'm not sure.

461
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,140
She didn't call you or anything?

462
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,250
She just left with her cell phone,
nothing else.

463
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,050
It's been over an hour.

464
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,020
I haven't heard anything from her.

465
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,630
She's not picking up.

466
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,500
She'll turn up, I'm sure.

467
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,770
If she's not even answering for you,
isn't that weird?

468
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,140
When Eun Oh gets really focused,
she often misses calls.

469
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:01,140
Try calling her again.

470
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,770
I have plans. I need to wrap this up
and get going.

471
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:09,610
This girl, honestly.

472
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:18,090
She should've called if she had to
leave in the middle of a meeting.

473
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,760
Besides, why did she have to
storm out like that?

474
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,460
She's never been this irresponsible.
Why is she putting me through this?

475
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,230
Wait a second.

476
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,570
What if something happened to her?

477
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:32,370
(112 Police)

478
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:35,510
No. That's crazy.

479
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,310
Seong Jae.

480
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,880
(Park Seong Jae)

481
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:45,720
(Park Seong Jae)

482
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,430
(Chief Director Park Seong Jae)

483
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,400
(Missed Call, Lee Ji Hyuk)

484
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:11,740
Ji Hyuk? I wonder what's up.

485
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:14,480
You have a voice message.

486
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:19,480
Why aren't you picking up?
Seong Jae, are you with Ji Eun Oh?

487
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,880
If you are, let me know right away.

488
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:25,560
Ji Eun Oh is missing!
She stormed out over 1.5 hours ago.

489
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,420
And her phone is off!

490
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,700
Missing?

491
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,610
Oh, Mr. Park.

492
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,310
Hey, Eun Oh.

493
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,850
Where are you coming from?

494
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:55,990
- What about you?
- I was just on my way home.

495
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:57,490
What about you, Eun Oh?

496
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:02,660
I just felt like taking a walk
in the rain.

497
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:04,430
Really?

498
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,860
Why?

499
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,870
Well, Ji Hyuk called
saying you were missing,

500
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:14,240
- so I was out looking for you.
- Missing?

501
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:17,140
But I told him I was just going out
for some air.

502
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,980
Gone for 1.5 hours for "some air?"
Who wouldn't be worried?

503
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,950
Has it been that long already?

504
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:30,320
I was stressed and had to step out.
I met someone for a beer.

505
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:32,160
Who'd you meet?

506
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:35,690
A friend.

507
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,690
Oh, you have a friend around here?

508
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,460
I do now.

509
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:43,870
I'd better call Ji Hyuk.

510
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:46,070
Oh, no, it's okay. Don't bother.

511
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:47,800
He's probably gone home
for the day anyway.

512
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,570
You know he moved back home, right?

513
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:53,580
Oh, right.

514
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,150
Right, so he actually goes home
after work now.

515
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:01,750
Being partners isn't always easy,
is it?

516
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,920
No.

517
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:08,660
It was silly,
but I got so stressed earlier.

518
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,530
Why? What aren't you seeing
eye-to-eye on?

519
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,030
No. It's not that.

520
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,400
The problem was me.

521
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:18,500
You've been bottling up your stress,
haven't you, Eun Oh?

522
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:21,440
Yes. We haven't gamed in a while,
have we?

523
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,470
I've been busy too.

524
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:26,540
Speaking of which,
should we make plans?

525
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:36,790
How about tomorrow?

526
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:39,320
Maybe after lunch?

527
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:43,560
- Unbelievable. I was worried sick.
- That sounds like fun.

528
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:45,700
See? Gaming is an addiction.

529
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,970
Ji Hyuk!

530
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,070
I'm going to head in first.

531
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:57,870
I'll message the group for Su Jeong.
See you tomorrow.

532
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:07,450
I knew I'd find you two
messing around.

533
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,920
No, we were just making plans.

534
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,920
I heard you went home. Good.

535
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,030
That was the right call.

536
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:18,960
This isn't a safe neighborhood.
She just stormed out,

537
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,660
so you can't just assume
she'll be okay.

538
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:23,230
- I just got here...
- Was it so hard...

539
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,070
to say something, that she's okay?

540
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,140
- No, that's not it.
- What's with you two?

541
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:30,940
Why are you two meeting and giggling
this late at night?

542
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:35,380
I just found her five minutes ago.

543
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,750
I was looking for her
after you called.

544
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,310
You should've called me
the second you found her.

545
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,480
What were you two
so cheerfully talking about?

546
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:43,750
Are you lecturing me?

547
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:45,190
Are you trying to get me riled up?

548
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:47,390
And that thing with you three
hanging out all the time.

549
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,730
You're leaving me out on purpose,
aren't you?

550
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,230
Of course.
Would you tell someone like you?

551
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,800
Ji Hyuk.

552
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:59,100
Why do you think
I have to tell you everything?

553
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,840
Eun Oh and I have our own dynamic.

554
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,440
Dynamic?

555
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,140
While I was gone,

556
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:09,150
did something happen
between you two?

557
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:11,410
Maybe.

558
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:12,750
What is it?

559
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,320
Would Eun Oh...

560
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,890
want me to tell you what happened
between the two of us?

561
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,520
Is that right?

562
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,630
I suppose she wouldn't.

563
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:26,160
Fine. Don't tell me.
It's not like I cared anyway.

564
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,370
I was asking because you were being
so weird and secretive.

565
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:32,970
Why did Eun Oh storm out
like that anyway?

566
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,770
- Did you two have a disagreement?
- That's not your business either.

567
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,240
Then why were you looking for her,
pale as a ghost?

568
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,080
Because there was a reason to,
you jerk.

569
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:43,180
That's what I'm asking.
What happened?

570
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:44,950
You didn't hear anything
from Eun Oh?

571
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,480
About what?

572
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:49,320
If she didn't tell you,
then you don't need to know.

573
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,850
Go on. I still have some work to do.

574
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,230
What in the world happened?

575
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:17,510
What should I do?

576
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,020
Ms. Ji.

577
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:24,950
Ji Eun Oh!

578
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:26,690
Eun Oh!

579
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,760
Would Eun Oh...

580
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:32,360
want me to tell you what happened
between the two of us?

581
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:40,740
You fool.

582
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,510
What were you thinking today?

583
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:59,790
Honestly, 150,000 dollars
is the right estimate.

584
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,530
(Mamdaerozip Quote,
Total 158,500 Dollars)

585
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,040
Not heading out?

586
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:17,240
No, I'm going to stay a bit longer.

587
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:18,840
What time is "a bit longer?"

588
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:22,580
Why do you want to know?

589
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:26,150
We don't have construction tomorrow,
so let's just wrap up and head home.

590
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,750
Because that's what I'd prefer.

591
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:53,380
He's right.
It's not like we're that busy yet.

592
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:14,530
Your daughter
hasn't been by at all lately.

593
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,430
I know. She's been busy.

594
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,500
It looks like
you're just trying to keep busy too.

595
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,970
- Sorry?
- Are you worried about something?

596
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:25,640
Oh, I shouldn't be so nosy.

597
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:28,080
I'll be on my way now.

598
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,110
All right. Bye.

599
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,020
She's right.

600
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,290
It's been quite a while
since Eun Oh...

601
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,120
stopped by.

602
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:46,500
She keeps coming home late too.

603
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,500
Are you Gang Oh's mother?

604
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,770
We're friends of Gang Oh's
from high school.

605
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:59,010
Gang Oh mentioned you run
a Korean BBQ place around here.

606
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:01,210
So why's he working at a pickup bar?

607
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:05,080
- Mom, I'm off. I'm late.
- Okay.

608
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:07,280
A pickup bar?

609
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,320
Where is that?

610
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:14,960
Oh, no. I...

611
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,530
I can't believe I said that
in front of Eun Oh.

612
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,500
What have I done?

613
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,140
Hey, I'm not just an employee here.

614
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:27,470
Then what are you?

615
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:31,410
- I'm the owner.
- My gosh. Seriously?

616
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,580
My friends and I invested together
to co-own it.

617
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,450
That's why I work the floor too.

618
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,820
You're an owner already?
How old are you?

619
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,950
Me? You first.

620
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:45,350
- You can't be older than me.
- What?

621
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:50,730
Hey! Ji Gang Oh.
Quit flirting with customers.

622
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:55,130
Get in the kitchen, now!
We're buried in dishes, you brat.

623
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:56,970
What was that about?

624
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,740
Unbelievable.

625
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:11,050
Hey, Yang Jin Gu!
Did you tell my mom I work here?

626
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:15,550
I'm telling you, I clearly said
it was the Couples' Bar in Hongdae.

627
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,450
You think I'd get the name
of our own bar wrong?

628
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:19,920
Seriously... Yes, one second!

629
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:26,530
Mom,

630
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:29,100
how could you do this to me?

631
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:44,850
What?

632
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:24,750
You came for this, didn't you?

633
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:28,290
You punk. Knowing it wasn't yours,
you should have returned it.

634
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:32,460
It looks like you were using my room
as your study.

635
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:34,460
Is it inconvenient
that I'm here now?

636
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,530
What, you think I need
a special place to study?

637
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,330
I can do it anywhere.

638
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:39,870
Father.

639
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:42,840
Have you really
thought this through?

640
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,440
What about?

641
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:46,280
An electrician's license.

642
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:48,940
It's pretty far removed
from your old line of work.

643
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:52,150
And you? What about you?

644
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:54,350
I hear you're starting
some unheard-of business.

645
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,890
Why don't you worry about yourself?

646
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,470
This kid... I swear.

647
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,370
Gosh, that's ridiculous.
The nerve of him.

648
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:14,370
Yes, you punk. Just you watch.

649
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,610
I'm Lee Sang Cheol. You got that?

650
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:18,570
He opens a pathetic business...

651
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:20,240
and thinks
he can talk to me like that.

652
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:28,780
My exam is today, of all days.
That clueless kid had to jinx me.

653
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:31,890
That's kids for you.

Yes! It's been ages
since the crew assembled.

665
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:29,880
That's on me. I've been so swamped.

666
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:32,280

- Both.
- Shall we?

- Both.
- Let's do both.

they're sneaking around doing,

I will.

672
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:48,400
- Yes.
- This is going to be fun!

673
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:50,530
Let's try that if it works out.

674
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,800
- Oh, really?
- We should...

00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:01,280
What did I even do?

676
00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:02,950
Come on, you're mad.

677
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:05,180
No. I told you. I'm not.

00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:32,040
Where did they go?

682
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:39,450
(Beauty Academy,
Raw Beef Restaurant)

683
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:47,620
Where are they?

684
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:51,560
(Face Orthodontist)

685
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,070
Isn't that Su Jeong?

686
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:02,770
Oh, no. What do I do?

687
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:12,750
What the...

688
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:14,420
A gaming cafe?

689
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:16,950
Unbelievable.

690
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:28,000
Yes, whatever. Have fun.

691
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:32,200
- Wow, you get better every day.
- Oh, that's hilarious.

692
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:36,740
Oh, Ji Hyuk? You're out here?

693
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:41,910
What are you, a bunch of kids,
running around in a pack like that?

694
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:45,310
Hey, what's that supposed to mean?

695
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:48,880
- I know what you're up to together.
- You do?

696
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:50,850
I did some guessing.

697
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:52,920
Knowing how childish
you three are...

698
00:45:58,060 --> 00:45:59,060
You're playing video games, right?

699
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:05,600
It's so obvious.
There's Seong Jae, who gets bored,

700
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:10,310
Eun Oh, who's totally impulsive,
and Su Jeong, who was a big gamer.

701
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:13,310
Come on, at your age,
all you do is play games?

702
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:14,410
Seriously?

703
00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:17,750
Yes, have fun. Sure.

704
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:29,790
No, I swear I didn't say anything.

705
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:33,230
- Me neither.
- But he seemed so sure of himself.

706
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,530
How did he know?

707
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:42,200
Making such a big secret
out of nothing.

708
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,140
Wait, what was I even doing?

709
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:54,520
It's not like Seong Jae and Eun Oh
went by themselves.

710
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:56,590
Su Jeong was with them.
The three of them went,

711
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:58,990
and I followed them
just to find that out?

712
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:01,220
No, that's not it.

713
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:04,630
They totally ditched me.
And it's not the first time.

714
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:07,000
Okay, fine, Eun Oh is one thing.

715
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:10,500
But for you to do it too, Seong Jae,
that's what got me so riled up.

716
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:13,140
My gosh...

717
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:15,370
Still, I feel pretty pathetic.

718
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:23,080
Why?

719
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:25,050
Why, Cheol Min?

720
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:30,190
You look like you feel pathetic.

721
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:32,820
Oh, did you hear that?

722
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,420
Oh, is this headset
not connected or something?

723
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:37,960
I was talking about the look
on your face.

724
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:39,800
It shows, right?

725
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:43,030
It's all over my face, right?
"Pathetic loser."

726
00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:44,470
I don't know about that.

727
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,070
That wasn't what I meant, but...

728
00:47:57,950 --> 00:48:00,480
- Hey, man.
- When should I start?

729
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,320
We're almost done wrapping up here.

730
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,120
Really?

731
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:06,460
When can you start?

732
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,330
- Hello.
- Oh, you're here.

733
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,830
That office I saw last time,
is it still available?

734
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,160
I'd like to sign the lease now.

735
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:28,010
We need to talk.

736
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:32,050
Let's go see Hyeon Su together.

737
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:33,980
Together?

738
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:35,550
Yes.

739
00:48:36,290 --> 00:48:38,150
I know it's late to be saying this,
but I can't continue...

740
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:40,490
as the president
of Value of Hangyeol.

741
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:43,430
So I'm going to tell her officially.

742
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:47,560
First, I wanted to say I'm sorry
for dumping this on you.

743
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:51,170
You're not dumping anything on me.

744
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:55,070
I probably won't be able to do
alumni volunteering either.

745
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,240
I discussed it with Hyeon Su
a while ago.

746
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:01,110
Since no one else in the association
wanted to be president.

747
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:03,580
Is that so?

748
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:07,520
But still, it's best
you tell her in person.

749
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,390
Since she's the biggest sponsor.

750
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:13,360
(Jung Hyeon Su Architecture Lab)

751
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,260
So you're going into business
together?

752
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:17,860
Just the two of you?

753
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:22,060
Yes. We get many turnkey requests.

754
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:26,700
You two are something else.

755
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,410
Also, I should have told you
this sooner.

756
00:49:30,870 --> 00:49:33,080
- The cafe manager job...
- Of course, you can't.

757
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:37,580
Right.
One or two projects a year was fine.

758
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,350
You can't make a living
on just 1 or 2 projects a year.

759
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,220
You made the right call.

760
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:46,620
You kids are grown up
and starting a business together.

761
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:52,060
I was only able to get into
interior design thanks to you.

762
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:53,130
That is true.

763
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:56,400
And I was able to open my own office
thanks to you.

764
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:57,470
Darn right, you were.

765
00:49:58,770 --> 00:50:00,940
I've been very grateful
for the office space.

766
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:04,940
I'm planning to move
to a new office.

767
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:08,740
Okay. Mamdaerozip lives up
to its name and is doing so well.

768
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:12,080
- When?
- Pretty soon.

769
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:20,890
Thanks for everything, Ji Eun Oh.

770
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:28,500
Working for Value of Hangyeol
was rewarding, thanks to you.

771
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:30,500
I had a great time,

772
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:32,530
and I'm grateful.

773
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:36,710
Thank you for all your hard work.

774
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,640
I'm grateful to you as well.

775
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:41,010
For everything.

776
00:50:56,690 --> 00:50:57,690
So...

777
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,930
What have we decided to do
about that thing?

778
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:05,730
I think we need to answer the client
for the Suri-dong house soon.

779
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:07,500
I'm still considering it.

780
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:10,940
Come on, Ms. Ji.
You're so indecisive.

781
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:14,540
You really need to think about it?
Especially in front of your partner?

782
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:23,020
Mr. Lee, don't jump to conclusions.

783
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:26,720
I'm actually trying to figure out
how to persuade the client.

784
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:29,160
Brilliant as always.

785
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:31,290
In that case, while you're at it,

786
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:36,030
your partner hopes
you don't drop the quote too much.

787
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:44,770
Figures.

788
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:53,980
Ever since you two became partners,
you enjoy bantering more and more.

789
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:58,390
Yes. If I'm partners with him
for just one year,

790
00:51:58,450 --> 00:52:00,120
I think I could make
some serious money.

791
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:04,260
- That's why you decided to do it.
- What?

792
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:07,530
You said it was for your family,
that's why you partnered with him.

793
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,370
You're right, I did.

794
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:13,770
That's why I decided to do it.

795
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:15,340
So I'd better make a lot of money.

796
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:31,020
She's got her hands in everything.

797
00:52:37,790 --> 00:52:40,100
- Welcome.
- I'm just looking. Thanks.

798
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:47,770
No one can know we know each other.
It's an absolute secret.

799
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,010
Okay, you can stand up now.

800
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:54,480
How do they feel?

801
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:57,810
These are more comfortable
than the other pair.

802
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:58,880
I'll take these.

803
00:52:58,950 --> 00:53:00,780
Okay, I'll get you a new pair
from the back.

804
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,590
Where did you find
this smart cookie?

805
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:10,060
If I was going to impose on you,
I couldn't bring a dimwit.

806
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:11,690
As soon as she clocked in,

807
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:13,560
she asked
which were the bestsellers,

808
00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:17,130
took photos of every shoe,
wrote down the model numbers,

809
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:19,670
and noted all their features.
She was actually memorizing them.

810
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:21,840
Did she?

811
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:25,410
Whenever it gets slow,
she just keeps studying.

812
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:30,480
Sorry for the wait.

813
00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:33,580
Let me just make sure
this is a fresh pair.

814
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:35,980
How do they look?

815
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:42,990
She's sold 7 pairs today.
And it's only her 1st day.

816
00:53:43,790 --> 00:53:46,190
- I'll get these ready for you.
- Ms. Lee.

817
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:48,300
Could you help this customer,
please?

818
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:49,560
Mr. Kang.

819
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:53,170
One moment.

820
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:55,870
Welcome!

821
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,240
Hi.

822
00:53:57,710 --> 00:53:58,710
Hey!

823
00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:02,180
What are you doing here? You said
we couldn't risk being seen.

824
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:05,610
It's your first day.
I was worried and came to check in.

825
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:09,920
What's there to worry about?
I've had many part-time jobs.

826
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:11,620
You have?

827
00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:15,060
Hurry up and go.
The assistant manager is watching.

828
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:16,220
What?

829
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:19,190
Then, please come back
and see us again, sir.

830
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:22,130
Wait, what?

831
00:54:30,110 --> 00:54:32,310
The quote is just
so far over our budget.

832
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:35,880
My kids are telling me to sell
and move into an apartment.

833
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:39,480
So, are you thinking of doing that
as well, ma'am?

834
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:41,150
No.

835
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:44,290
I want to spend the rest of my days
in this house.

836
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:49,790
Then, ma'am, would it be okay
if I paid a visit to your home?

837
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:52,160
I wasn't the one
who did the initial measurements,

838
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:55,560
so I'd like to see the house myself
and discuss some options.

839
00:55:07,310 --> 00:55:12,250
My husband was born in this house.
I've lived here since we married,

840
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:13,950
so I've grown very attached to it.

841
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:16,020
I can imagine.

842
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:20,490
Let me take a good look around,
and I'll try to lower the estimate.

843
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:23,530
Please, I'm counting on you, Ms. Ji.

844
00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:25,390
Of course.

845
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:35,170
Hey, Eun Oh. Speak of the devil.
I was just about to call you.

846
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:36,840
- What's up?
- She's here.

847
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:38,710
- Director Ko.
- What?

848
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:47,920
- Director Ko, what a surprise.
- I know, sorry for dropping in.

849
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:50,950
Why didn't you call me?

850
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:53,490
I couldn't.

851
00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:56,990
I wasn't even sure if you'd be here,

852
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:59,090
but I felt I had to come right away.

853
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:01,630
Is something wrong?

854
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:07,940
I did something I never do today.
I took a nap.

855
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:12,010
I only dozed off for a second,
and I had a dream.

856
00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:14,280
What did you dream about?

857
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:15,980
In the dream...

858
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:19,850
You know that glass sculpture
I gave you as a gift.

859
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:23,690
It shattered.
It was completely smashed to pieces.

860
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:26,220
What?

861
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:29,720
But it felt so real.

862
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:32,630
It didn't just fall and break.

863
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:35,330
It was crushed to pieces,
as if something had stomped on it.

864
00:56:37,530 --> 00:56:39,870
So I just had to come see
for myself.

865
00:56:42,470 --> 00:56:43,540
I see.

866
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:47,780
Did something happen again?

867
00:56:48,710 --> 00:56:51,410
Or is that other problem
still not resolved?

868
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:58,520
My brother still hasn't come home.

869
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:04,130
Get rid of it, Eun Oh.

870
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:07,260
I don't think
it was a very lucky gift.

871
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:08,730
Instead...

872
00:57:10,330 --> 00:57:13,270
Take this.
I bought it when I was in Paris.

873
00:57:13,370 --> 00:57:15,300
And I happened to buy an extra one,
just in case.

874
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:18,310
It was so beautiful,
I figured I'd give it to someone.

875
00:57:19,610 --> 00:57:21,880
- No, I couldn't possibly.
- No, I insist.

876
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:24,050
Here, feel this.

877
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:26,180
It's so soft and plush.

878
00:57:28,450 --> 00:57:30,020
I think what you need...

879
00:57:30,890 --> 00:57:32,450
is a little warmth.

880
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:40,830
Please take care of yourself.

881
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:45,470
Thank you.

882
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:55,580
Oh, honey.

883
00:57:57,850 --> 00:57:58,980
What was that?

884
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:04,620
Honey, you can't spring this on me.
Why is this trip so last-minute?

885
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:09,790
Our physicals are in two days.
You skipped them last year too.

886
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:15,330
Just a second.

887
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,170
Yes, I'm listening.

888
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,670
So, when will you be back?

889
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:25,940
I wonder if I can reschedule.

890
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:32,610
It's so hard to get an appointment.

891
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:34,920
I wonder
when I should reschedule for.

892
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:41,360
Who's that?

893
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:44,890
She looks familiar.

894
00:58:51,770 --> 00:58:53,170
Oh, where are my manners?

895
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,240
That must have been awkward for you.

896
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:56,700
Not at all.

897
00:58:58,110 --> 00:58:59,610
That could work.

898
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:04,510
You heard, right? My husband
and I have physicals in three days,

899
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:06,950
but he's going to Germany
on a business trip.

900
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:08,720
Yes.

901
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,020
Come with me, Ms. Ji.

902
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:14,320
I hate hospitals as it is.

903
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:17,790
I especially can't stand
those all-day checkups,

904
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:20,030
and my husband usually
has to drag me there.

905
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:23,230
And the appointment
is already paid for.

906
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:25,630
You should take his spot.

907
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:28,770
Oh, no. I couldn't.

908
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:31,610
When was the last time
you had a proper physical?

909
00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:34,510
Back when I was with my old company.

910
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:37,010
Then you're long overdue.

911
00:59:38,350 --> 00:59:40,920
You'd just be keeping me company,

912
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:43,450
so won't you please come with me?

913
00:59:50,990 --> 00:59:52,230
Hey, is that what
you were talking about?

914
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:54,400
No way. I've got goosebumps.

915
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:57,700
Wait, she didn't even know it broke.

916
00:59:57,770 --> 00:59:59,330
How could she have
a dream like that?

917
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:03,000
Especially with Gang Oh
stressing you out so much lately.

918
01:00:04,670 --> 01:00:05,670
Tell me about it.

919
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:09,280
It's like she knows
exactly what I'm feeling.

920
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:11,410
It's so surreal.

921
01:00:22,690 --> 01:00:23,690
Mom.

922
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:25,990
Mom, don't you think
you should be going to the hospital?

923
01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:27,500
No.

924
01:00:28,030 --> 01:00:32,630
No, I'm fine, really.
Don't worry. Just get ready.

925
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,770
Mom, I think you have a fever.

926
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:41,880
I'm fine. Now, hurry up and go.

927
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:45,380
You haven't had a drop of water
since last night.

928
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:47,720
How can you take me anywhere?

929
01:00:50,390 --> 01:00:53,490
Just go and get your checkup done.

930
01:00:54,290 --> 01:00:56,460
And for that lady...

931
01:00:57,090 --> 01:01:00,330
Tell her that I'm very grateful.

932
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:01,900
Okay?

933
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,630
- Ms. Ji.
- Hello.

934
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:44,340
You skipped one dinner,
and it shows.

935
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:46,170
It's because you're too thin.

936
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:49,040
After our checkups, I'll take you
to a great restaurant I know.

937
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:51,780
Okay. Oh, right!

938
01:01:51,850 --> 01:01:54,450
My mom insisted I thank you.

939
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:57,890
I actually haven't been feeling
my best lately,

940
01:01:58,090 --> 01:02:00,520
so she's grateful for letting me get
such a thorough physical.

941
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:03,860
I guess you and your mom
talk about everything.

942
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:06,430
Not everything.

943
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:09,760
I'm jealous.

944
01:02:33,020 --> 01:02:34,290
Oh, are you done already?

945
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:39,230
Shall we go?

946
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:41,060
Yes.

947
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:46,460
(Our Golden Days)

948
01:03:46,790 --> 01:03:51,330
A businessman, dressing like that?
And you have it all figured out?

949
01:03:51,430 --> 01:03:53,600
Getting left at the altar?

950
01:03:53,870 --> 01:03:55,800
- Don't you tell Sang Cheol, dear.
- Mother.

951
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:58,240
I'll run away from home if you do.

952
01:03:58,310 --> 01:04:03,240
Knowing all the facts on paper,
does that mean you truly know them?

953
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:05,010
You only know me on the surface.

954
01:04:05,110 --> 01:04:07,720
On days you go home after 10 p.m.,
I'll be the one to take you.

955
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:10,990
Is Seong Jae making a move?
Is he done playing Daddy Long Legs?

956
01:04:11,090 --> 01:04:14,520
No man spends time on a woman
he isn't interested in.

957
01:04:14,890 --> 01:04:18,590
There are two kinds of love.
The kind you realize first.

958
01:04:18,690 --> 01:04:20,330
And the kind others notice
before you do.

959
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:23,160
