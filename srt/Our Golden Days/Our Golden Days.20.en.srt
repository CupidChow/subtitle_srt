1
00:00:00,117 --> 00:00:01,587
If you don't incorporate my feedback,

2
00:00:02,032 --> 00:00:03,832
I'm not approving the design.

3
00:00:05,332 --> 00:00:06,602
I'm not doing it.

4
00:00:08,042 --> 00:00:09,802
I'm the client, and you're refusing my request?

5
00:00:11,472 --> 00:00:13,212
You're unbelievable.

6
00:00:13,512 --> 00:00:15,742
I'm telling you I'm fine,

7
00:00:16,112 --> 00:00:18,752
so why do you have a problem with it? Why?

8
00:00:18,982 --> 00:00:20,482
Seriously, what is your deal?

9
00:00:20,552 --> 00:00:23,222
I don't know. I don't know why I'm doing this.

10
00:00:23,382 --> 00:00:24,822
I guess I must like you.

11
00:00:30,122 --> 00:00:31,122
So?

12
00:00:32,192 --> 00:00:33,562
So, what will you do about it?

13
00:00:34,902 --> 00:00:37,502
What? Are you going to ask me out or something?

14
00:00:38,402 --> 00:00:39,632
Dream on.

15
00:00:41,242 --> 00:00:42,902
You need to sort out your feelings on your own, you know?

16
00:00:45,142 --> 00:00:46,172
So she knew?

17
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:50,782
I'm going to step out for a minute.

18
00:00:51,252 --> 00:00:52,582
Pull yourself together while I'm gone.

19
00:01:02,022 --> 00:01:04,732
(Jung Hyeon Su Architecture Lab)

20
00:01:05,892 --> 00:01:08,102
Of all the stunts to pull. Seriously.

21
00:01:11,232 --> 00:01:13,532
Does he realise how many times he's caught me off guard?

22
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:14,702
I guess he figured if he said that,

23
00:01:14,772 --> 00:01:18,072
I'd be flustered and speechless. Unbelievable.

24
00:01:19,472 --> 00:01:21,612
And why is he sticking his nose into my nap room?

25
00:01:22,312 --> 00:01:25,112
When is he going to drop that whole "I'm your senior" act?

26
00:01:32,452 --> 00:01:33,852
Lee Ji Hyuk, you crazy fool.

27
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:37,762
I guess I must like you.

28
00:01:38,332 --> 00:01:39,992
You need to sort out your feelings on your own, you know?

29
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:43,732
So it was that obvious.

30
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:46,102
And I thought I was hiding it so well.

31
00:01:47,072 --> 00:01:48,472
But still,

32
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:51,612
how could she shut me down like that in a split second?

33
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,612
I knew it would never work out anyway.

34
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:56,242
Never make that mistake again.

35
00:01:57,012 --> 00:01:58,752
Just stick to work.

36
00:02:05,552 --> 00:02:06,922
How am I going to smooth this over?

37
00:02:18,502 --> 00:02:19,932
Oh, hey.

38
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:22,872
Take the blueprints and review them. I'll get your feedback tomorrow.

39
00:02:23,942 --> 00:02:25,872
And don't tell me what to do with my own personal space.

40
00:02:26,672 --> 00:02:29,312
Just mark down anything you want to add or revise.

41
00:02:31,382 --> 00:02:32,382
All right.

42
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,532
She won't even hear me out.

43
00:02:54,332 --> 00:02:56,872
I was nice to you because you lived and worked hard.

44
00:02:57,472 --> 00:02:58,472
Remember your place.

45
00:02:59,642 --> 00:03:03,142
Stay away. I don't have to give someone a chance...

46
00:03:04,382 --> 00:03:05,982
if I don't think they suit me.

47
00:03:07,482 --> 00:03:08,482
Do I, Eun Oh?

48
00:03:11,052 --> 00:03:12,122
Is she throwing it back in my face?

49
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:16,722
So she knew I liked her all along and was just pretending she didn't?

50
00:03:18,792 --> 00:03:19,792
I'm losing my mind.

51
00:03:22,662 --> 00:03:23,662
Son.

52
00:03:26,032 --> 00:03:27,432
By the way, lately...

53
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:30,772
Are you and Ji Hyuk having one? A war of nerves.

54
00:03:31,072 --> 00:03:32,072
Oh, please.

55
00:03:32,642 --> 00:03:35,112
What father has a war of nerves with his son?

56
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,612
I'm just really upset with Ji Hyuk, that's all.

57
00:03:38,412 --> 00:03:41,052
Don't give me that. Honestly.

58
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:43,752
Fathers and sons.

59
00:03:43,752 --> 00:03:46,192
It's always man to man. That's just how it is.

60
00:03:47,322 --> 00:03:50,022
It was like that when you grew up, and I've seen it all over.

61
00:03:50,622 --> 00:03:53,932
Once a son becomes a man, they both try not to back down.

62
00:03:53,992 --> 00:03:55,662
That's what a war of nerves is.

63
00:03:56,132 --> 00:03:59,032
I was never like that with my own father.

64
00:03:59,402 --> 00:04:01,402
Oh, please. Of course, you were.

65
00:04:02,772 --> 00:04:04,472
Whenever your father would say something,

66
00:04:04,742 --> 00:04:06,472
you'd say, "I'll handle it myself."

67
00:04:07,012 --> 00:04:09,542
Then your father would fly off the handle,

68
00:04:09,812 --> 00:04:13,552
and then you two wouldn't speak to each other for over two weeks.

69
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:16,382
Well, back then,

70
00:04:17,052 --> 00:04:18,922
it was probably because Dad was being unreasonable.

71
00:04:21,692 --> 00:04:23,322
But now...

72
00:04:24,062 --> 00:04:25,892
You're the father now, aren't you?

73
00:04:26,662 --> 00:04:29,132
How can a parent ever win against their own child?

74
00:04:30,602 --> 00:04:34,072
Why does a parent always have to be the one to give in?

75
00:04:34,532 --> 00:04:36,442
No, it's not about winning.

76
00:04:36,872 --> 00:04:41,542
He's 33 now. He's old enough to know better,

77
00:04:41,642 --> 00:04:45,812
but he insists he's always right. I should discipline him.

78
00:04:46,482 --> 00:04:47,582
Oh, good grief.

79
00:04:48,652 --> 00:04:51,322
I guess it's true what they say about fathers and sons being beasts.

80
00:05:00,692 --> 00:05:01,762
You're back already.

81
00:05:02,862 --> 00:05:03,862
Yes, because of your grandma.

82
00:05:03,862 --> 00:05:05,902
I had a feeling you'd come home because of her.

83
00:05:06,432 --> 00:05:07,602
So you didn't leave after all?

84
00:05:08,302 --> 00:05:09,802
I told you I wasn't leaving.

85
00:05:09,902 --> 00:05:13,442
I know, you brat. Of course, you're brazen enough to stay.

86
00:05:15,812 --> 00:05:16,812
Ji Hyuk.

87
00:05:17,242 --> 00:05:19,052
What brings you home so early?

88
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:20,682
Because of Father.

89
00:05:22,052 --> 00:05:23,382
You were right.

90
00:05:24,022 --> 00:05:26,022
- Have you eaten? - Not yet.

91
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:27,222
Okay.

92
00:05:27,552 --> 00:05:29,292
It's about time my son got a home-cooked meal.

93
00:05:29,592 --> 00:05:32,092
- Go wash up. I'll set the table. - Okay.

94
00:05:32,662 --> 00:05:36,362
What, does he not have hands? Tell him to make his own dinner.

95
00:05:36,732 --> 00:05:38,172
Mom, it's okay. I'll get it myself.

96
00:05:42,602 --> 00:05:43,702
Just go wash up.

97
00:05:48,512 --> 00:05:50,512
It's that soy-braised pork Dad loves.

98
00:05:53,012 --> 00:05:54,282
Oh, it's good.

99
00:05:56,722 --> 00:05:57,882
What is it? Do you need something?

100
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,192
Mom.

101
00:06:00,892 --> 00:06:02,192
Why aren't you saying anything?

102
00:06:03,492 --> 00:06:04,562
About what?

103
00:06:05,292 --> 00:06:06,832
You must have your own take on this, right?

104
00:06:07,332 --> 00:06:10,002
Like telling me to apologise to Father or something?

105
00:06:10,862 --> 00:06:11,872
No.

106
00:06:12,732 --> 00:06:15,572
I don't know exactly why your father's acting this way,

107
00:06:15,772 --> 00:06:17,872
and frankly, I don't know why you are either.

108
00:06:18,772 --> 00:06:21,982
Since I don't know the whole story, how can I tell you two what to do?

109
00:06:22,412 --> 00:06:23,682
You two sort it out yourselves.

110
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,352
Just...

111
00:06:25,682 --> 00:06:27,682
don't go raising your voices in the house.

112
00:06:29,582 --> 00:06:30,582
I'll try to be careful.

113
00:06:31,752 --> 00:06:32,892
By the way, Ji Hyuk...

114
00:06:33,952 --> 00:06:36,522
Let's just drop the whole thing about living expenses.

115
00:06:36,962 --> 00:06:37,962
Come on, Mom.

116
00:06:38,262 --> 00:06:40,692
I agree with your father on that.

117
00:06:41,032 --> 00:06:43,902
So let's not talk about it anymore.

118
00:06:44,502 --> 00:06:46,172
Fine. For now.

119
00:06:46,902 --> 00:06:48,772
Ji Hyuk, you got home early.

120
00:06:49,502 --> 00:06:52,012
I saw Dad's shoes by the door. Is he home too?

121
00:06:52,572 --> 00:06:53,942
Yes, he's in his room.

122
00:06:54,542 --> 00:06:56,312
So, Ji Hyuk was totally right.

123
00:06:56,642 --> 00:06:57,882
How did he guess that?

124
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:00,012
Dad!

125
00:07:00,312 --> 00:07:01,782
The nerve of that kid...

126
00:07:02,452 --> 00:07:03,822
"I knew you'd be back?"

127
00:07:04,182 --> 00:07:07,292
What does he know, acting so smug? That brat.

128
00:07:08,892 --> 00:07:10,662
- Dad. - Yes, hey.

129
00:07:10,662 --> 00:07:11,762
I'm home.

130
00:07:13,462 --> 00:07:17,462
Dad, where did you sleep last night? Do you know how worried I was?

131
00:07:18,332 --> 00:07:19,472
I'm sorry about that.

132
00:07:19,932 --> 00:07:22,602
Next time you have a fight like that, make sure I'm home.

133
00:07:22,872 --> 00:07:24,972
I'll kick Ji Hyuk out for you.

134
00:07:25,242 --> 00:07:27,972
Oh, sweetie. What could you do? You silly kid.

135
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:39,022
Three units left at Hyunmyeong Apts, with no defect claims so far.

136
00:07:39,152 --> 00:07:41,422
We've started on five units at the Ohyang Apartments,

137
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:44,122
and we're prepping for construction on 27 homes at Yeonseong Apartments.

138
00:07:45,092 --> 00:07:46,562
What's the status on our hiring search?

139
00:07:47,292 --> 00:07:49,162
The application deadline is this week,

140
00:07:49,162 --> 00:07:50,502
and interviews are next week,

141
00:07:51,102 --> 00:07:53,272
but individual contracts are flooding in.

142
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:55,272
We need to hire a site manager first.

143
00:07:56,942 --> 00:07:58,342
When would you like to meet?

144
00:08:03,542 --> 00:08:05,882
(Ji Eun Oh)

145
00:08:05,982 --> 00:08:07,212
(I want a mini-showroom with an open layout.)

146
00:08:07,282 --> 00:08:08,582
(The materials list will be sent today.)

147
00:08:08,652 --> 00:08:10,452
I want a mini-showroom with an open layout,

148
00:08:10,452 --> 00:08:12,122
so the staff can move around and work comfortably.

149
00:08:12,652 --> 00:08:14,752
The materials list will be sent today.

150
00:08:16,992 --> 00:08:18,562
I asked to set up a meeting, and this is what I get?

151
00:08:19,692 --> 00:08:22,432
He's so ridiculously fickle. It's unforgivable.

152
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:25,002
He's the one who let it slip.

153
00:08:32,072 --> 00:08:34,142
Oh? Ms. Ji.

154
00:08:34,712 --> 00:08:35,782
Hello.

155
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,082
Good timing. I was about to send you Lee Ri Na and Kim Ji Seon's...

156
00:08:39,082 --> 00:08:41,722
- final turnkey project plans. - I see.

157
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:44,522
I'm actually here to meet with Mr. Lee.

158
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,852
I sent you a text about that.

159
00:08:47,922 --> 00:08:51,122
I'm having lunch with the staff today.

160
00:08:52,262 --> 00:08:53,492
Then I'll just join you.

161
00:09:02,072 --> 00:09:04,002
Cheol Min, you want to grab lunch with us?

162
00:09:05,972 --> 00:09:08,682
I avoid the lunch rush. It's always too packed.

163
00:09:17,522 --> 00:09:21,192
I have that lunch meeting with the newly signed coordinators.

164
00:09:21,192 --> 00:09:22,362
I told you, remember?

165
00:09:26,192 --> 00:09:28,662
- Was that today? - Yes.

166
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:32,602
I guess Mr. Lee is so busy, he must've mixed up the dates.

167
00:09:34,002 --> 00:09:35,102
I guess it's just you and me, then.

168
00:09:44,942 --> 00:09:47,952
No one's in the elevator. And it's lunchtime.

169
00:09:49,252 --> 00:09:50,282
Right!

170
00:09:50,582 --> 00:09:51,992
So, I was thinking...

171
00:09:52,452 --> 00:09:53,952
About the mini-showroom.

172
00:09:54,322 --> 00:09:56,722
You want an open layout for the staff to...

173
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:06,832
Let's talk when we get to the restaurant.

174
00:10:08,372 --> 00:10:10,342
Oh, sure.

175
00:10:12,642 --> 00:10:13,642
I'm starving.

176
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:16,412
Aren't you hungry?

177
00:10:20,852 --> 00:10:21,852
- At company dinners... - The stew is always...

178
00:10:22,052 --> 00:10:26,192
For the mini-showroom, how many staff tables go in the open space?

179
00:10:26,352 --> 00:10:30,022
And for that to happen, tell me what materials you'll display.

180
00:10:30,622 --> 00:10:33,962
- Oh, I got it. - Have some water first.

181
00:10:34,292 --> 00:10:35,532
You need to take a breath.

182
00:10:36,362 --> 00:10:39,632
You seem so busy. Too busy to even have a meeting.

183
00:10:40,772 --> 00:10:44,072
Right, that's my point. We could've just chatted about this.

184
00:10:44,502 --> 00:10:46,912
For something under an hour in person?

185
00:10:48,072 --> 00:10:51,212
How do I explain the layout by text? Never mind.

186
00:10:51,382 --> 00:10:53,782
The mini-showroom will have a sink.

187
00:10:53,782 --> 00:10:55,922
Windows, flooring, wallpaper, wall molding,

188
00:10:55,982 --> 00:10:57,382
tiles, finishing films, bathroom fixtures...

189
00:10:58,022 --> 00:10:59,192
Are you going to include all of that?

190
00:11:01,392 --> 00:11:04,662
- Isn't it too small for all that? - Exactly.

191
00:11:04,822 --> 00:11:08,662
I was taking my time to figure out which materials to prioritise.

192
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:11,062
But without that list,

193
00:11:11,162 --> 00:11:14,002
I can't even start on the mini-showroom design.

194
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:17,272
- Here's your food. - Thank you.

195
00:11:18,402 --> 00:11:19,442
Thank you.

196
00:11:19,742 --> 00:11:21,212
Enjoy your meal.

197
00:11:21,812 --> 00:11:23,782
Let's eat first, and then we can talk. Okay?

198
00:11:23,912 --> 00:11:26,482
Let's talk while we eat. Since you're so busy.

199
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:34,622
So, why do you want an open-plan space for your team?

200
00:11:35,992 --> 00:11:39,092
I hate being stuck in an office all day, just working.

201
00:11:40,532 --> 00:11:42,502
Instead of a separate office,

202
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:45,232
why not keep the current cafe layout?

203
00:11:45,402 --> 00:11:47,632
Come on, that'd be way too open.

204
00:11:48,202 --> 00:11:50,372
What positions are you hiring for?

205
00:11:51,242 --> 00:11:53,172
A site manager...

206
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:55,542
and a staff member dedicated to Mamdaerozip.

207
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:57,342
Perfect.

208
00:11:57,742 --> 00:12:01,182
Cheol Min is always there, right? And Mr. Jo, too.

209
00:12:01,282 --> 00:12:02,952
The site manager will be out a lot,

210
00:12:02,952 --> 00:12:05,082
and the staff member will be on the phone frequently.

211
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:10,492
Put six desks by the break room wall and use bookshelves as dividers.

212
00:12:10,562 --> 00:12:12,962
And keep the cafe layout for the rest of the space.

213
00:12:13,492 --> 00:12:14,692
Oh, I see.

214
00:12:15,062 --> 00:12:16,832
- So, basically. - Okay, let's just eat first.

215
00:12:16,832 --> 00:12:18,632
My noodles are getting soggy. I'm starving.

216
00:12:27,812 --> 00:12:29,842
Hey, slow down a little.

217
00:12:34,882 --> 00:12:36,222
Just listen while you eat.

218
00:12:36,752 --> 00:12:37,922
My point is...

219
00:12:38,222 --> 00:12:41,092
This way, we'll save on construction costs,

220
00:12:41,152 --> 00:12:43,992
and the construction timeline gets much shorter.

221
00:12:44,422 --> 00:12:47,562
Okay, fine! We'll do it your way. Now, let's just eat.

222
00:12:48,762 --> 00:12:52,102
Really? So nothing else will change, right?

223
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:53,172
Yes.

224
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:54,872
Now, let's eat.

225
00:13:26,202 --> 00:13:28,742
I almost wish Seong Jae would just make his move already.

226
00:13:34,142 --> 00:13:36,882
(Action Plan)

227
00:13:38,912 --> 00:13:40,652
Is this the same Lee Ji Hyuk I know?

228
00:13:43,352 --> 00:13:45,322
Mamdaerozip Version 2.0...

229
00:13:46,822 --> 00:13:49,192
plus a comprehensive materials showroom?

230
00:13:51,962 --> 00:13:52,962
My gosh.

231
00:13:57,062 --> 00:13:59,872
Mr. Park, the buyer from Italy is here.

232
00:14:01,072 --> 00:14:02,142
Okay, got it.

233
00:14:06,942 --> 00:14:09,782
I understand that other show companies...

234
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:11,942
were also under consideration.

235
00:14:13,082 --> 00:14:17,052
Could you share the reason why our company was chosen?

236
00:14:24,162 --> 00:14:26,992
Because of him, Mr. Park Seong Jae.

237
00:14:27,892 --> 00:14:29,562
Mr. Ferrari, nice to see you again.

238
00:14:29,632 --> 00:14:30,632
Great to see you.

239
00:14:34,902 --> 00:14:36,002
Now, please...

240
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,182
The shoes are very comfortable, aren't they?

241
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:48,382
They are, but...

242
00:14:48,452 --> 00:14:51,252
Are these all the designs you currently offer?

243
00:14:51,882 --> 00:14:55,562
We were expecting designs that are more unique.

244
00:14:55,622 --> 00:14:58,762
With more personality.

245
00:15:00,162 --> 00:15:04,362
Our Shoe Joy products have more strength in functionality.

246
00:15:05,832 --> 00:15:06,832
Okay.

247
00:15:15,442 --> 00:15:16,742
Have you seen everything?

248
00:15:17,682 --> 00:15:19,252
Yes, roughly.

249
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:24,682
So, you and your wife are heading to Gyeongju and Busan tomorrow, right?

250
00:15:25,152 --> 00:15:26,152
Yes.

251
00:15:26,452 --> 00:15:27,452
Here you go, sir.

252
00:15:36,132 --> 00:15:38,562
Provare per credere.

253
00:15:38,632 --> 00:15:42,302
(It's an Italian proverb meaning, "You have to try it to believe it.")

254
00:15:42,572 --> 00:15:44,172
When I was in the US,

255
00:15:44,442 --> 00:15:48,072
I had an Italian friend named Marco, and he used to say,

256
00:15:48,712 --> 00:15:51,042
"You have to experience it to believe it."

257
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:52,782
You know what I mean, right?

258
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:54,552
Of course, I do.

259
00:15:54,882 --> 00:15:57,252
Provare per credere!

260
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:03,222
Well... It's hard to see how great our shoes are at first...

261
00:16:03,292 --> 00:16:05,422
just by walking around the store once,

262
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:07,992
and that's why we want you to wear them...

263
00:16:08,062 --> 00:16:10,032
and travel in them for three days.

264
00:16:10,432 --> 00:16:13,502
But even after that experience,

265
00:16:13,502 --> 00:16:15,272
if you still think they're not right,

266
00:16:15,332 --> 00:16:17,672
then at least there'll be no regrets on either side.

267
00:16:18,342 --> 00:16:22,682
And this is the reason we're giving them to you as a gift.

268
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:27,582
Very well.

269
00:16:28,252 --> 00:16:29,282
Wait.

270
00:16:30,282 --> 00:16:32,222
Your wife is going with you, right?

271
00:16:32,892 --> 00:16:34,022
Yes, she is.

272
00:16:34,392 --> 00:16:36,492
Do you know her shoe size?

273
00:16:37,392 --> 00:16:39,362
Provare per credere!

274
00:16:39,562 --> 00:16:42,202
We tried the shoes for four entire days...

275
00:16:42,262 --> 00:16:43,362
while on the trip.

276
00:16:43,632 --> 00:16:46,672
And they were incredibly comfortable...

277
00:16:46,732 --> 00:16:49,372
and light despite being leather.

278
00:16:49,972 --> 00:16:53,012
And my wife. She loved them even more.

279
00:16:54,272 --> 00:16:56,142
They even sent us pictures,

280
00:16:56,712 --> 00:17:00,252
saying they look great with jeans.

281
00:17:00,712 --> 00:17:01,752
They did?

282
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:06,492
I hope our product is successful in Europe as well.

283
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:09,722
Of course. Korean products are trusted internationally.

284
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:11,192
Thank you so much.

290
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,562
Then let's meet for dinner tomorrow evening.

291
00:17:42,622 --> 00:17:43,622
Okay.

292
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:57,002
I'm surprised to see you escort them all the way out, Father.

293
00:17:58,872 --> 00:18:02,012
We've expanded into the US, India, China, and even New Zealand,

294
00:18:02,112 --> 00:18:04,282
but we haven't been able to crack the European market.

295
00:18:04,682 --> 00:18:08,682
We're entering the European market. It's the least I can do.

296
00:18:10,052 --> 00:18:12,352
But how did you even come up with that idea?

297
00:18:12,752 --> 00:18:15,722
That Italian phrase... Was it "Seeing is believing?"

298
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:18,862
- Hey, Director Yoon! - Yes, sir.

299
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:21,032
The global operations team really struggled with it,

300
00:18:21,132 --> 00:18:23,132
but my son here nailed it in one go.

301
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:26,502
I know. Seriously, well done, Mr. Park.

302
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:28,502
Thank you.

303
00:18:29,102 --> 00:18:33,772
Let's celebrate at home tonight. I'll ask your mom to cook a feast.

304
00:18:33,942 --> 00:18:36,612
That's pretty short notice. Besides, Mom might not even be home.

305
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:40,282
Dad, you're the one who always says not to bring work home.

306
00:18:41,152 --> 00:18:43,382
But you've done something truly exceptional.

307
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:45,952
I think I just got lucky on this one.

308
00:18:46,552 --> 00:18:50,322
And I agree with your principle of keeping work and home separate.

309
00:18:51,392 --> 00:18:53,092
Look at you. Such a thoughtful kid.

310
00:18:53,692 --> 00:18:54,762
All right.

311
00:19:08,112 --> 00:19:09,482
The investor wants to meet,

312
00:19:11,012 --> 00:19:12,282
but out on the street again?

313
00:19:13,512 --> 00:19:15,722
Seong Jae, when was the last time you just relaxed in the sun?

314
00:19:17,082 --> 00:19:19,092
I can't even remember the last time I worked out during the day.

315
00:19:21,052 --> 00:19:22,252
Look at this guy, so carefree.

316
00:19:23,222 --> 00:19:25,062
You're not even asking if I'm going to invest.

317
00:19:26,062 --> 00:19:27,092
Because I know you will.

318
00:19:28,132 --> 00:19:29,132
What?

319
00:19:29,202 --> 00:19:30,902
Even when you knew nothing, you joined...

320
00:19:30,902 --> 00:19:33,102
Sunny Investment Association to help me out.

321
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:36,442
Now, how could you pass after seeing my killer proposal?

322
00:19:37,002 --> 00:19:38,072
The only question is how much.

323
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:42,942
I guess we've been friends for too long.

324
00:19:43,212 --> 00:19:45,142
What is this? You read me like a book.

325
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:47,152
Hey.

326
00:19:47,782 --> 00:19:49,982
I think business is in your DNA.

327
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:53,222
I honestly thought you were insane when I read your proposal.

328
00:19:53,522 --> 00:19:55,322
Why? Did it seem too far-fetched?

329
00:19:55,722 --> 00:19:56,762
No, that's not it.

330
00:19:57,192 --> 00:19:59,292
The speed of your expansion in the same sector.

331
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,062
Most people would struggle...

332
00:20:01,062 --> 00:20:03,062
with Mamdaerozip's current growth rate.

333
00:20:03,332 --> 00:20:04,932
They'd be overwhelmed and just grateful for it.

334
00:20:05,732 --> 00:20:06,732
You think so?

335
00:20:07,232 --> 00:20:10,402
Did you really not know what you were made of?

336
00:20:11,402 --> 00:20:12,442
What do you mean?

337
00:20:14,542 --> 00:20:16,942
You were born with an entrepreneur's DNA.

338
00:20:17,712 --> 00:20:19,552
Why did it take you so long to discover that?

339
00:20:20,682 --> 00:20:25,382
I guess I never had the chance. Anyway, how much will you invest?

340
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:27,892
Two million dollars.

341
00:20:29,022 --> 00:20:30,022
Two million dollars?

342
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:33,892
I set that aside because I thought you were just expanding Mamdaerozip.

343
00:20:34,492 --> 00:20:36,362
But you're also planning a full-scale exhibition center.

344
00:20:37,432 --> 00:20:39,102
I'm more than grateful for two million dollars.

345
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:41,672
I'll raise the rest myself.

346
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,672
I'm so incredibly proud.

347
00:20:45,442 --> 00:20:46,872
Your parents must be over the moon.

348
00:20:48,842 --> 00:20:50,942
I haven't told them what my business is yet.

349
00:20:52,812 --> 00:20:53,852
What? Why not?

350
00:20:55,112 --> 00:20:56,252
It's a funny thing.

351
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:59,322
I have no problem asking complete strangers to invest in me,

352
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:02,052
and I had no problem being brazen with Ji Eun Oh,

353
00:21:02,692 --> 00:21:04,062
but for some reason, it's not easy with my parents.

354
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:05,722
Especially my father.

355
00:21:06,662 --> 00:21:08,262
He still doesn't believe in me.

356
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:12,302
So when are you going to tell them?

357
00:21:13,302 --> 00:21:14,332
Once it's a sure thing.

358
00:21:15,532 --> 00:21:17,772
Because I chose to marry Jung Bo A back then,

359
00:21:18,172 --> 00:21:20,342
he still treats me like a pathetic loser.

360
00:21:21,512 --> 00:21:23,512
He's still mad about it. My father.

361
00:21:26,212 --> 00:21:28,912
Your dad's still mad?

362
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:32,322
What? You think I deserve to be treated like that?

363
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:35,022
Hey, Ji Hyuk.

364
00:21:35,452 --> 00:21:37,022
I've really done a lot of self-reflection.

365
00:21:38,192 --> 00:21:40,892
After we got into that fight, I thought about it.

366
00:21:41,732 --> 00:21:43,862
I realised my own feelings were dictating how I treated you.

367
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:46,072
Regardless of the facts,

368
00:21:46,402 --> 00:21:49,442
you must have been the one who was suffering the most.

369
00:21:50,702 --> 00:21:53,512
Like you said, my emotions got the better of me.

370
00:21:55,642 --> 00:21:57,482
That's exactly what my father's doing now.

371
00:22:00,182 --> 00:22:01,382
Man, if it's that bad,

372
00:22:02,452 --> 00:22:03,952
you two really need to have a heart-to-heart.

373
00:22:05,222 --> 00:22:07,852
But if it's that awkward, why'd you move back home?

374
00:22:08,292 --> 00:22:09,622
Because the last time I left, I basically ran away.

375
00:22:10,292 --> 00:22:12,832
But it's not just my father. My mom and grandma are there too.

376
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:16,162
I'll move out when I can stand on my own two feet.

377
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:18,432
And I'll tell them about the business once it's on track.

378
00:22:19,402 --> 00:22:20,772
I can't let them down again.

379
00:22:22,772 --> 00:22:25,302
Man, family's a funny thing.

380
00:22:26,142 --> 00:22:30,012
To me, your parents were the parents I always wished I had.

381
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:32,912
This really isn't right.

382
00:22:33,812 --> 00:22:36,522
- You little punk! - Listen to us, will you?

383
00:22:37,852 --> 00:22:38,882
Hey!

384
00:22:39,592 --> 00:22:42,122
Isn't making him your gopher enough? He bought you sneakers,

385
00:22:42,122 --> 00:22:44,292
and you even steal his allowance every Monday.

386
00:22:46,132 --> 00:22:48,462
Lee Ji Hyuk. You'd better not regret this.

387
00:22:48,532 --> 00:22:49,532
I'll crush you to dust.

388
00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:52,462
If you lose to me, you'll leave Park Seong Jae alone.

389
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:54,132
Go easy on him.

390
00:23:08,482 --> 00:23:10,022
- Hey. - You all saw that, right?

391
00:23:11,182 --> 00:23:12,852
From now on, none of you can mess with Park Seong Jae.

392
00:23:14,692 --> 00:23:15,722
Hey!

393
00:23:16,292 --> 00:23:17,322
Hey!

394
00:23:18,692 --> 00:23:19,692
Ji Hyuk!

395
00:23:22,332 --> 00:23:23,902
My gosh, Ji Hyuk.

396
00:23:26,602 --> 00:23:29,102
Ji Hyuk, shouldn't you go to the hospital?

397
00:23:29,402 --> 00:23:31,342
It's not that bad. I just got banged up a little.

398
00:23:32,042 --> 00:23:33,812
This is more than a little.

399
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:37,742
She didn't even ask what happened. She was just worried about you.

400
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:39,082
Your mom.

401
00:23:40,012 --> 00:23:43,582
Where did you go and who did you fight with...

402
00:23:44,082 --> 00:23:45,822
to end up like this?

403
00:23:47,622 --> 00:23:48,852
Ji Hyuk...

404
00:23:49,392 --> 00:23:51,792
- stepped in for me and... - I got into it with some bullies.

405
00:23:52,662 --> 00:23:53,692
I'm sorry, Mom.

406
00:23:54,962 --> 00:23:56,532
How did this happen?

407
00:23:56,962 --> 00:23:59,432
It's the usual story. Some bullies were picking a fight.

408
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:02,332
You didn't just take it, did you?

409
00:24:02,802 --> 00:24:03,802
Of course not.

410
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:06,412
Right, Seong Jae? I landed some good hits, didn't I?

411
00:24:10,542 --> 00:24:11,782
Your name's Seong Jae, right?

412
00:24:12,382 --> 00:24:14,882
It must've been tough getting Ji Hyuk home.

413
00:24:18,652 --> 00:24:19,652
You must be hungry.

414
00:24:21,052 --> 00:24:23,722
I thought your mom was going to chew me out too.

415
00:24:24,222 --> 00:24:26,432
But instead, she just said "You must be hungry."

416
00:24:27,062 --> 00:24:28,462
And don't even get me started on your dad.

417
00:24:30,362 --> 00:24:31,562
Eat up, you two.

418
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,002
Ji Hyuk!

419
00:24:35,502 --> 00:24:38,372
- Hey! Ji Hyuk, son. - Dad.

420
00:24:38,702 --> 00:24:40,242
- Hello, sir. - Yes, hi.

421
00:24:40,242 --> 00:24:41,612
Look at the state of his face.

422
00:24:41,672 --> 00:24:43,042
- Hey, get up. Let me see. - Okay.

423
00:24:43,542 --> 00:24:46,012
Hey, where are you hurt?

424
00:24:46,082 --> 00:24:47,252
Where does it hurt? Are you okay?

425
00:24:47,812 --> 00:24:51,352
Dad. Of course, it hurts. My knee's scraped.

426
00:24:51,422 --> 00:24:54,952
Hey, I'm just checking if you cracked or broke a bone.

427
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:57,892
I already checked him over. No broken bones.

428
00:24:57,962 --> 00:24:59,692
It's just bruises, but they're pretty bad.

429
00:24:59,732 --> 00:25:01,392
My boy, how did this even...

430
00:25:01,762 --> 00:25:04,462
Are you getting bullied at school or something?

431
00:25:05,702 --> 00:25:07,372
It's my fault.

432
00:25:08,172 --> 00:25:11,202
He was defending me from some kids and ended up fighting them for me.

433
00:25:11,972 --> 00:25:13,472
Ji Hyuk fought them for me.

434
00:25:14,212 --> 00:25:15,312
I'm sorry, sir.

435
00:25:15,312 --> 00:25:17,612
- Hey, kid! What are you sorry for? - What do you have to be sorry for?

436
00:25:18,612 --> 00:25:19,952
Don't be.

437
00:25:20,482 --> 00:25:23,152
Come on, sit down. Let's eat. Sit down.

438
00:25:23,982 --> 00:25:25,322
That's when I was completely won over.

439
00:25:25,322 --> 00:25:27,422
By your parents.

440
00:25:27,952 --> 00:25:29,992
You got hurt because of me,

441
00:25:29,992 --> 00:25:31,322
and I didn't have a scratch on me.

442
00:25:31,862 --> 00:25:34,062
I was sure I'd get scolded, but they said,

443
00:25:34,192 --> 00:25:36,632
"The ones who picked the fight are the ones to blame."

444
00:25:37,132 --> 00:25:40,532
They said I did nothing wrong and that you did the right thing.

445
00:25:41,402 --> 00:25:43,202
They're really warm people.

446
00:25:44,572 --> 00:25:46,972
That was the best meal I've ever had in my life.

447
00:25:47,442 --> 00:25:49,882
After that, you were practically living at my house.

448
00:25:50,642 --> 00:25:52,182
I envied you for having a father like that.

449
00:25:52,482 --> 00:25:53,982
"Are you hurt anywhere?"

450
00:25:55,412 --> 00:25:58,182
I'd never had anyone ask me that before.

451
00:25:59,052 --> 00:26:01,622
That's the price of being born a third-generation rich heir.

452
00:26:01,992 --> 00:26:05,492
He probably raised you tough so you could run the company, right?

453
00:26:06,262 --> 00:26:07,262
Hey.

454
00:26:07,862 --> 00:26:10,332
You're so understanding when it comes to my dad,

455
00:26:10,662 --> 00:26:12,872
so why are you so hard on your own dad?

456
00:26:13,732 --> 00:26:15,072
Maybe it's because he's my father.

457
00:26:16,272 --> 00:26:17,272
What?

458
00:26:18,242 --> 00:26:21,272
It's a relationship tangled up in expectations and obligations.

459
00:26:25,282 --> 00:26:26,612
I get what you mean.

460
00:26:29,152 --> 00:26:30,152
That makes sense.

461
00:26:39,592 --> 00:26:41,892
It's our first date, and we're at a place like this.

462
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:44,262
And I even made us a reservation at a fancy steakhouse.

463
00:26:44,432 --> 00:26:47,702
You bought me a beer last time. It's my turn to treat you.

464
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,972
You're so frugal, Su Bin.

465
00:26:51,442 --> 00:26:55,442
For most working people, I'd say a place like this is normal.

466
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:59,612
No. It's different if a girl is dating me.

467
00:27:02,052 --> 00:27:04,582
Besides, I'm planning to quit my job.

468
00:27:04,582 --> 00:27:08,392
You know about my YouTube channel. I really enjoy it,

469
00:27:08,452 --> 00:27:11,122
but growth was slow, so I got a job.

470
00:27:11,122 --> 00:27:12,592
But it's not really a good fit,

471
00:27:12,662 --> 00:27:14,732
so I'm just going to focus on growing my channel.

472
00:27:15,632 --> 00:27:17,102
What do you think?

473
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:24,002
What's there to think about? If you enjoy it, you should do it.

474
00:27:28,712 --> 00:27:30,782
Did you think I wouldn't support you?

475
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:35,052
Really? I thought you wanted a career woman.

476
00:27:35,312 --> 00:27:36,822
Well, I saw you had a job.

477
00:27:39,952 --> 00:27:41,352
So when are you quitting?

478
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:43,692
I have to stay until they find my replacement.

479
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:46,192
Why would you wait for that? Just put in your notice tomorrow.

480
00:27:46,262 --> 00:27:47,592
That way, we can go have fun together.

481
00:27:47,662 --> 00:27:50,332
No, I can't do that. I have to train my replacement.

482
00:27:50,632 --> 00:27:51,902
Train a replacement? Why?

483
00:27:51,902 --> 00:27:53,302
It's not like they're designer goods.

484
00:27:53,602 --> 00:27:55,272
How can you talk like that?

485
00:27:55,502 --> 00:27:58,802
In some ways, their shoes are better than any designer brand.

486
00:27:59,242 --> 00:28:02,242
Okay, I get it. But about your channel's content...

487
00:28:02,512 --> 00:28:06,452
You should switch to luxury goods. Luxury unboxings get tons of views.

488
00:28:06,782 --> 00:28:08,082
Ditch cheap clothes for designer wear.

489
00:28:08,082 --> 00:28:09,652
I'll buy it all for you.

490
00:28:10,282 --> 00:28:13,892
Why would I change my content to luxury unboxing videos?

491
00:28:14,222 --> 00:28:16,262
It's an upgrade, obviously. Anyone can see that.

492
00:28:16,322 --> 00:28:20,232
An upgrade? Should you judge a job so casually?

493
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,762
By that logic, doesn't your company just sell puffed rice?

494
00:28:23,932 --> 00:28:27,972
Our product might be puffed rice, but it's Byeolnara Confectionery.

495
00:28:28,872 --> 00:28:30,542
And I am the heir to that company, little one.

496
00:28:31,802 --> 00:28:35,072
That too. Why do you keep calling me that,

497
00:28:35,072 --> 00:28:36,242
as if you're my brother or something?

498
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:39,382
I only have three brothers, you see.

499
00:28:39,882 --> 00:28:41,282
Right, and you have two older brothers.

500
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:43,382
And there's one other guy who's like a brother to me.

501
00:28:43,622 --> 00:28:46,592
The only men who get to act like brothers to me...

502
00:28:46,652 --> 00:28:48,722
are those three.

503
00:28:49,092 --> 00:28:52,122
What are you talking about? If we date, I'm number one.

504
00:28:52,222 --> 00:28:56,562
Only call me and your brothers that. As for that other guy?

505
00:28:56,702 --> 00:28:59,432
Absolutely not. I'm the one who gets to be number one.

506
00:28:59,502 --> 00:29:01,472
I'm number one. I absolutely won't stand for it.

507
00:29:02,402 --> 00:29:04,472
And what are you going to do about it?

508
00:29:04,772 --> 00:29:05,772
What?

509
00:29:05,842 --> 00:29:09,812
There's absolutely no way I'm ever going to call you that.

510
00:29:10,312 --> 00:29:11,542
Because I'm not going to date you.

511
00:29:18,922 --> 00:29:21,252
Lee Su Bin! If you leave like this, we are done!

512
00:29:36,542 --> 00:29:38,072
What was I thinking?

513
00:29:38,842 --> 00:29:40,472
Was I possessed or something?

514
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:44,112
Why would I dump a guy who's so rich, handsome, and young?

515
00:29:44,212 --> 00:29:45,942
Why did I dump him?

516
00:29:47,412 --> 00:29:50,582
He's so arrogant and pretentious. That's why I dumped him.

517
00:29:51,722 --> 00:29:54,952
But even so, he was such a great catch.

518
00:29:55,092 --> 00:29:56,522
And he really liked me.

519
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:59,632
This is driving me crazy.

520
00:30:09,302 --> 00:30:11,942
- Da Jeong, all finished? - Yes.

521
00:30:12,002 --> 00:30:14,012
Thank you so much for working late.

522
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:17,042
Here, I marinated some spicy pork. Have this for dinner.

523
00:30:17,112 --> 00:30:18,212
I put in some green onion kimchi too.

524
00:30:18,742 --> 00:30:22,412
- No, that's really okay, ma'am. - It'll be too late to cook.

525
00:30:22,512 --> 00:30:23,752
Go on, take it.

526
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:25,022
Go on home.

527
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:29,252
I should give this to Dad.

528
00:30:40,332 --> 00:30:42,932
Da Jeong. Hey, you didn't even call?

529
00:30:43,002 --> 00:30:45,472
Dad, I can't stay long. I have to go make dinner for Mother.

530
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:48,272
Here's some spicy pork stir-fry. Just heat it up for dinner.

531
00:30:48,842 --> 00:30:51,182
- I have to go! - Okay.

532
00:31:02,752 --> 00:31:05,892
The phone is turned off. Connecting to voicemail...

533
00:31:06,262 --> 00:31:08,362
(Father-in-law)

534
00:31:08,462 --> 00:31:09,702
Why is his phone off?

535
00:31:15,532 --> 00:31:17,072
Father.

536
00:31:17,802 --> 00:31:18,942
Father.

537
00:31:20,542 --> 00:31:22,542
Is he not home at this hour?

538
00:31:23,642 --> 00:31:24,642
Father.

539
00:31:27,812 --> 00:31:29,582
Father!

540
00:31:29,852 --> 00:31:31,052
Father.

541
00:31:31,922 --> 00:31:34,052
Oh, my. Sang Cheol.

542
00:31:36,662 --> 00:31:37,662
Father...

543
00:31:40,492 --> 00:31:43,602
Why are you just sitting here in the dark?

544
00:31:44,662 --> 00:31:45,702
Oh, well...

545
00:31:46,062 --> 00:31:47,872
I must have dozed off.

546
00:31:49,472 --> 00:31:50,872
What's this?

547
00:31:51,372 --> 00:31:54,712
That's some food Da Jeong dropped off earlier.

548
00:31:55,212 --> 00:31:58,112
Goodness. She should have put it in the fridge.

549
00:31:58,182 --> 00:31:59,342
Oh, no.

550
00:31:59,812 --> 00:32:02,212
I told her I'd put it away myself.

551
00:32:20,572 --> 00:32:23,272
- That's enough. Let's eat. - Yes. Okay.

552
00:32:26,812 --> 00:32:30,512
I'm sorry I can't visit more often. You must get lonely.

553
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:34,782
A well-fed man shouldn't complain. I'm luckier than most.

554
00:32:38,352 --> 00:32:41,292
You're the one who must be worried sick.

555
00:32:41,352 --> 00:32:43,462
So why are you looking after me on top of everything?

556
00:32:43,562 --> 00:32:46,832
Please, don't worry about me. I'm taking it one step at a time.

557
00:32:48,532 --> 00:32:50,232
Don't you worry about me either.

558
00:32:50,862 --> 00:32:52,962
Da Jeong brings me side dishes...

559
00:32:53,372 --> 00:32:57,142
and stocks the freezer with rice, and there's always something on TV.

560
00:32:57,572 --> 00:33:01,042
And when I go to the Senior Center, there are plenty of chess partners.

561
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:03,112
That's a huge relief.

562
00:33:03,942 --> 00:33:05,782
- Please, help yourself. - You too. Eat up.

563
00:33:05,842 --> 00:33:06,852
I will.

564
00:33:13,452 --> 00:33:14,452
Here.

565
00:33:15,752 --> 00:33:17,392
Why are you trying to give this to me again?

566
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:22,632
What do you mean, "again?" You had the wrong idea about me.

567
00:33:22,692 --> 00:33:24,262
Isn't that why you turned it down?

568
00:33:25,562 --> 00:33:27,672
You said your projects might overlap.

569
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,572
Buy a car before that happens.

570
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:33,472
Gosh, I worry so much about you coming home late.

571
00:33:33,542 --> 00:33:37,482
It breaks my heart to think of you catching buses and subways.

572
00:33:38,482 --> 00:33:41,282
But I've almost saved up enough on my own.

573
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:47,152
I'll be so hurt if you refuse again.

574
00:33:48,222 --> 00:33:50,092
You said you weren't getting married anytime soon.

575
00:33:55,292 --> 00:33:56,632
All right.

576
00:33:57,062 --> 00:33:58,062
But...

577
00:33:58,432 --> 00:34:00,802
when I get married, I'll pay for everything myself.

578
00:34:03,372 --> 00:34:05,302
So you do plan on getting married someday.

579
00:34:07,012 --> 00:34:08,572
If the right person comes along, sure.

580
00:34:09,012 --> 00:34:10,812
I told you. I'm not against the idea of marriage.

581
00:34:43,712 --> 00:34:44,742
Man...

582
00:35:08,432 --> 00:35:09,432
Ji Gang Oh.

583
00:35:11,272 --> 00:35:12,542
Oh, hey.

584
00:35:13,042 --> 00:35:15,712
I was just passing by and thought I'd see how business is going.

585
00:35:16,212 --> 00:35:18,212
Hey, perfect timing, man.

586
00:35:19,082 --> 00:35:21,012
Man, this world is so unfair.

587
00:35:22,112 --> 00:35:23,582
I'm telling you, looks really do matter.

588
00:35:24,552 --> 00:35:26,722
You have a lot of female regulars asking for you.

589
00:35:27,852 --> 00:35:28,852
Really?

590
00:35:29,892 --> 00:35:30,892
Of course, they're looking for me.

591
00:35:32,292 --> 00:35:34,732
Go in and get some sleep. You start work tomorrow.

592
00:35:44,202 --> 00:35:46,202
Yeong Ra, it's here!

593
00:35:49,742 --> 00:35:50,742
Hey.

594
00:35:53,782 --> 00:35:54,852
Hey!

595
00:35:55,452 --> 00:35:57,052
Stop reading, and let's eat.

596
00:35:57,852 --> 00:35:58,852
Here you go.

597
00:36:07,992 --> 00:36:08,992
That's tteokbokki.

598
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:13,102
Yes. Tteokbokki and frozen yogurt are a killer combo.

599
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:19,802
Oh, no.

600
00:36:26,542 --> 00:36:27,552
This is what I work for.

601
00:36:29,712 --> 00:36:31,052
You're not even going to offer me any?

602
00:36:32,822 --> 00:36:36,022
I always offer, but you said you were dieting for the exhibition.

603
00:36:51,202 --> 00:36:52,202
Here.

604
00:36:52,442 --> 00:36:53,442
Just have one.

605
00:36:57,142 --> 00:36:59,142
You can't just give me one without asking!

606
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:18,102
You need to finish all of this today to keep drawing "Take My Heart."

607
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:19,732
You'd better keep your promise!

608
00:37:24,272 --> 00:37:25,272
Look at you.

609
00:37:26,402 --> 00:37:28,842
- You said it was better with this. - Yes.

610
00:37:28,912 --> 00:37:29,912
Okay.

611
00:37:34,182 --> 00:37:35,182
Delicious, right?

612
00:37:40,052 --> 00:37:42,252
Well... That one was mine.

613
00:37:50,932 --> 00:37:51,962
That tastes awful.

614
00:37:53,572 --> 00:37:54,632
It does.

615
00:38:00,872 --> 00:38:03,882
I think this piece should be the main feature.

616
00:38:04,442 --> 00:38:06,582
But of course, the final decision is up to the two of you.

617
00:38:07,512 --> 00:38:09,452
When it comes to placement, we should defer to your judgment.

618
00:38:11,452 --> 00:38:12,952
But the lighting...

619
00:38:13,182 --> 00:38:16,622
Isn't it a little over-the-top for the size of Yeong Ra's painting?

620
00:38:17,822 --> 00:38:20,592
We'll adjust the focus before installing the artwork.

621
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,832
What's your take on it, Curator?

622
00:38:27,102 --> 00:38:31,402
The important thing is which piece complements Yeong Ra's work.

623
00:38:32,342 --> 00:38:36,612
Dokgo Chan goes to a Busan orphanage by himself to save his sister.

624
00:38:37,412 --> 00:38:38,412
Leaving So Ri behind?

625
00:38:39,082 --> 00:38:43,212
Why? He's already in love with So Ri.

626
00:38:43,352 --> 00:38:46,752
His sister La Ni is hiding in Mr. Pink's basement,

627
00:38:47,092 --> 00:38:48,892
and her food and water should have run out by now.

628
00:38:49,492 --> 00:38:51,092
And the door is locked from the outside.

629
00:38:51,522 --> 00:38:54,132
So what happens to So Ri?

630
00:38:55,392 --> 00:38:56,392
I don't know.

631
00:38:57,902 --> 00:39:01,472
I have to write what happens to So Ri while Chan is in Busan.

632
00:39:04,202 --> 00:39:06,942
You should put So Ri in some kind of huge crisis.

633
00:39:07,412 --> 00:39:09,672
Something like, "She's a goner. Jin Woo will kill her."

634
00:39:10,312 --> 00:39:12,212
Oh, good idea.

635
00:39:19,452 --> 00:39:22,892
(The cafe is closing down.)

636
00:39:24,892 --> 00:39:25,892
This feels so weird.

637
00:39:26,962 --> 00:39:29,432
We need to figure out what to do with the cafe equipment, and fast.

638
00:39:29,932 --> 00:39:32,732
No, wait. Let's check what we can reuse first.

639
00:39:33,132 --> 00:39:34,932
You're going to use old stuff in the new space?

640
00:39:35,772 --> 00:39:38,872
We have to reuse what we can. Ji Hyuk doesn't have a lot of money.

641
00:39:42,712 --> 00:39:43,712
Ji Hyuk!

(Jung Hyeon Su Architecture Lab)

643
00:39:46,512 --> 00:39:47,652
So you put up the closing notice.

644
00:39:58,922 --> 00:40:01,292
We can put a sink in the showroom on the terrace...

645
00:40:01,492 --> 00:40:04,562
so visiting clients can have coffee while they browse materials.

646
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,762
Let's turn it into a drink station. That's the idea.

647
00:40:07,702 --> 00:40:08,702
I like it.

648
00:40:10,102 --> 00:40:13,712
- I like it. - You do? So, should we finalize it?

649
00:40:14,312 --> 00:40:16,112
Let's just take one more look at it in 3D.

650
00:40:16,442 --> 00:40:19,182
Okay, I'll make the 3D model with furniture,

651
00:40:19,182 --> 00:40:21,082
lighting, and power outlets.

652
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:22,752
I'll have it all finished and sent to you by tonight.

653
00:40:26,052 --> 00:40:28,252
Working right through dinner. You two are something else.

654
00:40:29,852 --> 00:40:31,492
I'm heading out for the night.

655
00:40:31,892 --> 00:40:32,892
Yes, go ahead.

656
00:40:34,862 --> 00:40:37,262
Wow, I didn't realise it was so late.

657
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:40,902
I guess you can have your coffee and pastry in the car.

658
00:40:42,272 --> 00:40:46,202
Actually, I have to pull an all-nighter in the storeroom.

659
00:40:46,842 --> 00:40:48,712
What? I have to work all night too.

660
00:40:49,212 --> 00:40:51,612
I've got that client meeting for Art Space tomorrow.

661
00:40:52,382 --> 00:40:53,382
Oh, no. What do we do?

662
00:40:54,112 --> 00:40:58,352
Cheol Min's at the office all night for the website restoration,

663
00:40:58,422 --> 00:40:59,682
so I can't work there tonight.

664
00:41:00,022 --> 00:41:02,092
I was just letting you know that I have to work all night too.

665
00:41:02,652 --> 00:41:03,662
Is anyone stopping you?

666
00:41:11,002 --> 00:41:12,332
Right.

00:41:20,202 --> 00:41:23,072
"Absolutely not. But I knew it would be a hit."

670
00:41:23,682 --> 00:41:26,242
"But on second thought,"

00:41:26,342 --> 00:41:28,452
"maybe I knew all along."

Man, it's cold.

677
00:43:50,022 --> 00:43:52,062
Mr. Lee!

00:43:54,332 --> 00:43:55,392
My gosh.

(Director Park Seong Jae)

683
00:44:13,142 --> 00:44:14,182
It's too late now.

684
00:44:19,822 --> 00:44:22,992
Mr. Lee, stay with me. Are you okay?

685
00:44:24,062 --> 00:44:27,262
Okay, lean on me for a second. Hold on!

686
00:44:28,032 --> 00:44:29,062
Hang on a second!

687
00:44:31,732 --> 00:44:33,932
Okay, duck your head. Watch your head!

There you go.

Why are your legs so long? My gosh.

There are no cars around.

693
00:45:01,762 --> 00:45:02,762
I can handle this.

694
00:45:21,352 --> 00:45:24,482
- How do you know the patient? - Excuse me?

695
00:45:24,822 --> 00:45:25,822
A senior colleague.

696
00:45:26,322 --> 00:45:27,322
He's my senior colleague.

697
00:45:29,422 --> 00:45:34,232
His inflammatory markers are high, and his lymphocyte count is low.

698
00:45:34,692 --> 00:45:37,502
It looks like a viral infection from a weakened immune system...

699
00:45:37,502 --> 00:45:38,862
due to stress and overwork.

700
00:45:40,632 --> 00:45:41,672
Is it serious?

701
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:44,502
No. There are no other complications,

702
00:45:44,642 --> 00:45:45,872
so he'll be fine with some IV fluids and rest.

00:46:00,052 --> 00:46:01,722
You were bound to get sick.

705
00:46:02,792 --> 00:46:03,792
This was long overdue.

706
00:47:00,412 --> 00:47:03,112
(Hanguk Hospital)

707
00:48:16,792 --> 00:48:17,792
Are you okay?

708
00:48:21,762 --> 00:48:23,992
Your fever... Has it broken?

709
00:48:28,472 --> 00:48:29,932
Let me see if your fever's gone down.

710
00:48:30,372 --> 00:48:31,902
No, I'm fine.

711
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:34,912
Don't, Eun Oh.

712
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:39,782
So ungrateful.

713
00:48:49,622 --> 00:48:50,622
Where are you going?

714
00:48:51,562 --> 00:48:52,822
To the underground parking lot.

715
00:48:53,962 --> 00:48:55,032
The underground parking lot?

716
00:48:59,162 --> 00:49:00,432
Hey, these are my car keys.

717
00:49:01,032 --> 00:49:03,272
You drove? But you barely ever drive.

718
00:49:03,802 --> 00:49:07,712
I'm not that out of practice. I've rented cars and driven a lot.

719
00:49:09,272 --> 00:49:10,442
Give them to me. I'll drive.

720
00:49:11,242 --> 00:49:15,252
You're a patient. You can't drive. I'm not trusting you with my life.

721
00:49:16,012 --> 00:49:17,012
Come on.

722
00:49:32,462 --> 00:49:33,602
I'm a good driver, aren't I?

723
00:49:33,932 --> 00:49:34,932
Not nervous, are you?

724
00:49:39,172 --> 00:49:40,172
I'm hungry.

725
00:49:40,942 --> 00:49:41,942
I'm sorry, what?

726
00:49:43,112 --> 00:49:45,282
I didn't eat anything all day yesterday.

727
00:49:46,282 --> 00:49:47,282
Oh, right.

728
00:49:48,112 --> 00:49:49,152
What do you want to eat?

729
00:49:51,852 --> 00:49:56,552
- Kimchi stew? - No. That's too spicy for you.

730
00:49:58,292 --> 00:49:59,292
Cheonggukjang, then?

731
00:50:01,492 --> 00:50:02,492
Okay.

732
00:50:12,172 --> 00:50:13,172
Out of the way.

733
00:50:23,952 --> 00:50:25,622
I'm really getting the royal treatment.

734
00:50:26,452 --> 00:50:27,452
You sure are.

735
00:50:28,052 --> 00:50:29,322
You're really something else.

736
00:50:30,862 --> 00:50:32,622
And to a man who just cheated death.

737
00:50:33,462 --> 00:50:34,632
Yes, but you lived.

738
00:50:35,762 --> 00:50:38,262
How can I ever repay you?

739
00:50:39,002 --> 00:50:40,202
You don't have to.

740
00:50:40,462 --> 00:50:41,602
What do you mean I don't have to?

741
00:50:42,432 --> 00:50:44,372
I hate owing people.

742
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:46,842
That's enough.

743
00:50:47,472 --> 00:50:51,342
Wait a minute. Just because you tell me to stop,

744
00:50:51,612 --> 00:50:53,142
does that mean I have to?

745
00:50:54,282 --> 00:50:56,852
We're just business partners. Nothing more, nothing less.

746
00:50:57,682 --> 00:50:59,452
I'm telling you to save your breath.

747
00:51:00,152 --> 00:51:01,322
Look, your hands are still shaking.

748
00:51:02,892 --> 00:51:03,892
You're right.

749
00:51:04,692 --> 00:51:07,322
Since when am I just all talk?

750
00:51:17,302 --> 00:51:19,142
Give me some more fish.

751
00:51:40,322 --> 00:51:41,932
Look, I told you to go home.

752
00:51:42,492 --> 00:51:43,662
You pulled an all-nighter.

753
00:51:44,132 --> 00:51:45,602
Go home, get some rest, and then come back.

754
00:51:47,132 --> 00:51:49,032
You're the one who should go home and rest.

755
00:51:49,332 --> 00:51:50,942
The doctor said you needed plenty of rest.

756
00:52:09,892 --> 00:52:11,922
I told you. I can take care of myself.

757
00:52:13,362 --> 00:52:15,662
- I know. - Why did you follow me in here?

758
00:52:16,092 --> 00:52:17,492
You're not going home?

759
00:52:18,132 --> 00:52:19,532
I have my IR presentation today.

760
00:52:19,632 --> 00:52:20,662
(IR: Investment relations presentation)

761
00:52:29,372 --> 00:52:31,812
Is everything ready for it? What time's the pitch?

762
00:52:33,282 --> 00:52:34,282
I've got plenty of time.

763
00:52:35,382 --> 00:52:37,012
Is there anything I can do to help?

764
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:39,822
Don't help me.

765
00:52:41,292 --> 00:52:42,822
Don't even think about it.

766
00:52:46,492 --> 00:52:47,492
Eun Oh.

767
00:52:49,562 --> 00:52:50,662
Stop being so nice to me.

768
00:52:54,332 --> 00:52:55,502
Don't confuse me.

769
00:53:01,842 --> 00:53:02,842
What was that?

770
00:53:04,242 --> 00:53:05,482
I just can't figure him out.

771
00:53:10,052 --> 00:53:13,252
Oh, I was just about to call you.

772
00:53:13,552 --> 00:53:14,992
I saw your suit was still here.

773
00:53:15,792 --> 00:53:16,822
That's what I'm here for.

774
00:53:17,862 --> 00:53:18,922
Where are you off to?

775
00:53:20,192 --> 00:53:22,232
To the spa to shower.

776
00:53:23,092 --> 00:53:26,562
Exactly. I worried you'd leave in your current state.

777
00:53:28,072 --> 00:53:29,072
I'll be back.

778
00:53:34,512 --> 00:53:35,772
Man, he looks terrible.

779
00:53:36,872 --> 00:53:38,012
It must be from pulling an all-nighter.

780
00:53:41,282 --> 00:53:42,582
As you may have seen from our IR materials,

781
00:53:42,852 --> 00:53:46,282
the growth rate of Mamdaerozip speaks for itself.

782
00:53:46,822 --> 00:53:49,392
Over 60,000 cumulative app downloads.

783
00:53:49,752 --> 00:53:52,122
An 11-fold increase in daily website traffic.

784
00:53:52,592 --> 00:53:54,932
And a contract conversion rate of 93.4 percent.

785
00:53:55,562 --> 00:53:59,432
Recording a 400 percent growth rate in just the 1st quarter,

786
00:53:59,702 --> 00:54:00,832
we now find ourselves...

787
00:54:01,102 --> 00:54:03,502
in need of Version 2.0, and sooner than we ever anticipated.

788
00:54:04,542 --> 00:54:05,542
(Mamdaerozip 2.0)

789
00:54:05,602 --> 00:54:06,972
(Why a comprehensive materials showroom?)

790
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:10,612
As you can see, consumers have more options than ever before.

791
00:54:10,842 --> 00:54:13,982
But that doesn't necessarily work in their favour.

792
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:16,652
It means more time and energy spent on making a decision.

793
00:54:19,752 --> 00:54:20,882
That's why what's important...

794
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:23,052
isn't the range of options,

795
00:54:23,392 --> 00:54:25,862
but rather, a discerning eye.

796
00:54:26,222 --> 00:54:29,832
We're not just showcasing materials. We're showcasing personality.

797
00:54:30,532 --> 00:54:34,262
That's the kind of showroom we're aiming for.

798
00:54:34,532 --> 00:54:35,532
Thank you.

799
00:54:35,532 --> 00:54:36,572
(Showcasing personality, not materials)

800
00:54:37,872 --> 00:54:39,172
(Thank you for your attention.)

801
00:54:46,042 --> 00:54:47,182
I wonder if Seong Jae was right.

802
00:54:47,782 --> 00:54:49,382
I don't feel tired at all.

803
00:54:58,662 --> 00:55:00,922
I guess having separate break areas was too much to ask.

804
00:55:01,262 --> 00:55:02,592
It looks so cramped.

805
00:55:03,792 --> 00:55:05,232
I should've listened to you.

806
00:55:05,532 --> 00:55:06,762
I got too ahead of myself.

807
00:55:07,662 --> 00:55:09,672
No, it's fine. We can just fix it.

808
00:55:10,102 --> 00:55:12,302
We revise apartment blueprints a dozen times sometimes.

809
00:55:12,872 --> 00:55:14,942
- Really? - Yes.

810
00:55:17,342 --> 00:55:18,342
Oh, my.

811
00:55:18,742 --> 00:55:19,742
What is that?

812
00:55:23,182 --> 00:55:24,182
My gosh.

813
00:55:25,722 --> 00:55:29,122
Looks like there's a leak here. It wasn't here before.

814
00:55:31,022 --> 00:55:32,022
Looks like it.

815
00:55:32,492 --> 00:55:34,262
It must have leaked during that last downpour.

816
00:55:36,792 --> 00:55:39,332
I thought I was done with leaks in my life.

817
00:55:43,732 --> 00:55:46,742
Your room's never been flooded, has it?

818
00:55:48,512 --> 00:55:49,512
No.

819
00:55:52,112 --> 00:55:53,912
When I was a sophomore in high school,

820
00:55:54,782 --> 00:55:56,012
I dropped out.

821
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:02,122
My father would start drinking soju first thing in the morning.

822
00:56:03,422 --> 00:56:05,722
He made a habit of beating my mom.

823
00:56:07,392 --> 00:56:10,162
One day, he hit her over the head with an empty bottle.

824
00:56:10,692 --> 00:56:14,732
She was bleeding, so to save her, we fled to the mainland.

825
00:56:15,502 --> 00:56:19,002
It was the start of summer vacation during my sophomore year.

826
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:21,972
I'm originally from Jeju Island.

827
00:56:26,012 --> 00:56:29,312
I used the money I'd saved up from a part-time job for college...

828
00:56:29,712 --> 00:56:32,952
to rent a semi-basement room in Myeongri-dong, Seoul.

829
00:56:33,622 --> 00:56:35,322
But it rained so much that year.

830
00:56:36,522 --> 00:56:40,162
And then suddenly, the water just started pouring in.

831
00:56:40,862 --> 00:56:42,432
It came all the way up to my knees.

832
00:56:43,392 --> 00:56:47,032
I had to bail out all the water and clean the entire place.

833
00:56:48,272 --> 00:56:51,442
We were desperate to leave the room filled with black mold.

834
00:56:53,272 --> 00:56:55,872
My mom and I, we did every odd job you can imagine.

835
00:57:00,682 --> 00:57:02,512
I don't look like someone who's been through all that, do I?

836
00:57:05,822 --> 00:57:06,822
You see,

837
00:57:07,422 --> 00:57:11,262
I got out of that basement room, but I couldn't climb any higher.

838
00:57:13,592 --> 00:57:17,462
I got my GED and wanted to go to art school,

839
00:57:18,462 --> 00:57:20,902
but my mom was sick for a few years, and then she passed away.

840
00:57:23,402 --> 00:57:25,702
I was working at a small company,

841
00:57:26,402 --> 00:57:28,472
and that's where I met the man I fell in love with.

842
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:30,912
We had beautiful children together.

843
00:57:34,342 --> 00:57:35,552
But then my husband...

844
00:57:36,452 --> 00:57:38,482
And just like that, he was killed in a hit-and-run.

845
00:57:41,222 --> 00:57:42,222
My goodness.

846
00:57:44,592 --> 00:57:46,722
I was left alone with the children.

847
00:57:48,132 --> 00:57:51,432
At our new place, the ceiling and walls leaked...

848
00:57:52,832 --> 00:57:54,402
every time it rained.

849
00:57:57,672 --> 00:57:58,972
That water stain...

850
00:57:59,572 --> 00:58:02,642
It looked like a banana to my kids.

851
00:58:06,142 --> 00:58:07,312
So whenever it rained,

852
00:58:08,082 --> 00:58:09,952
they'd ask me to buy them bananas.

853
00:58:14,222 --> 00:58:16,352
My daughter, especially.

854
00:58:21,562 --> 00:58:23,392
Bananas were her absolute favourite.

855
00:58:29,432 --> 00:58:30,572
I had no idea.

856
00:58:33,772 --> 00:58:35,912
Seeing a leak for the first time in decades...

857
00:58:36,572 --> 00:58:37,912
It's amazing how vivid the memory is,

858
00:58:37,912 --> 00:58:39,042
as if it were yesterday.

859
00:58:41,812 --> 00:58:44,452
Of course, you wouldn't forget something like that.

860
00:58:46,622 --> 00:58:47,682
But still, Director Ko...

861
00:58:48,922 --> 00:58:50,622
You're truly incredible.

862
00:58:53,492 --> 00:58:54,562
How so?

863
00:58:55,692 --> 00:58:57,592
You've overcome all of that hardship.

864
00:58:58,402 --> 00:59:02,472
Now, you're running scholarships and even sponsoring artists.

865
00:59:05,642 --> 00:59:09,572
When you've struggled yourself, you can't help but see it in others.

866
00:59:11,142 --> 00:59:14,882
The arts are a path I couldn't take, so I have a soft spot for them.

867
00:59:17,212 --> 00:59:18,622
In that respect,

868
00:59:19,082 --> 00:59:21,252
I think you're the one who's more impressive, Eun Oh.

869
00:59:22,922 --> 00:59:24,792
You're doing what you love.

870
00:59:25,962 --> 00:59:28,022
You've even set your mother up so she's taken care of.

871
00:59:28,662 --> 00:59:31,402
And quitting a great company like Doogle...

872
00:59:31,762 --> 00:59:33,632
That's not something just anyone can do.

873
00:59:36,702 --> 00:59:38,272
Well, when you put it that way,

874
00:59:38,972 --> 00:59:41,142
you make me feel like I'm really someone special.

875
00:59:45,712 --> 00:59:47,042
Anyway, I have no idea why today...

876
00:59:47,612 --> 00:59:52,052
I just bared my soul about my past. All because of that water stain.

877
00:59:53,182 --> 00:59:54,182
That's...

878
00:59:55,022 --> 00:59:58,862
because I'm not involved with anyone in your life.

879
01:00:01,292 --> 01:00:02,292
What?

880
01:00:03,162 --> 01:00:06,202
It makes it easier to talk freely, you see.

881
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:11,742
It's like talking to a priest, or getting therapy.

882
01:00:13,342 --> 01:00:14,342
After all,

883
01:00:14,972 --> 01:00:17,672
I told you all about my brother, didn't I?

884
01:00:22,882 --> 01:00:24,712
You know, you're right.

885
01:00:33,392 --> 01:00:36,492
Director Ko is incredible. She's overcome so much.

886
01:00:38,062 --> 01:00:40,132
You'd never guess she'd had it so rough.

887
01:00:41,002 --> 01:00:42,272
Coming from that background...

888
01:00:43,202 --> 01:00:44,732
I want to be just like her.

889
01:00:46,002 --> 01:00:48,312
(Jaeha Park, Bus Stop)

890
01:01:06,122 --> 01:01:07,162
Is that Woo Jin?

891
01:01:08,022 --> 01:01:10,762
Han Woo Jin. What's he doing here in Korea?

892
01:01:12,832 --> 01:01:16,072
- The number you have dialled... - Right.

893
01:01:16,872 --> 01:01:18,502
He suspends his service when he goes to the US.

894
01:01:20,142 --> 01:01:21,372
Was I seeing things?

895
01:01:22,342 --> 01:01:23,342
No, that can't be right.

896
01:01:23,812 --> 01:01:24,942
I'm sure it was Woo Jin.

897
01:01:29,112 --> 01:01:30,112
(Taxi, Vacant)

898
01:01:47,832 --> 01:01:48,832
Who are you?

899
01:01:56,012 --> 01:02:00,712
I also sent invitations to the VIPs you chose for the opening reception.

900
01:02:01,582 --> 01:02:04,482
- Good job. Thank you, honey. - No problem.

901
01:02:06,182 --> 01:02:08,792
So my Yeong Ra's finally becoming an artist.

902
01:02:09,322 --> 01:02:10,322
How do you feel?

903
01:02:11,352 --> 01:02:15,392
What masterpiece are you hiding? You wouldn't let me in your studio.

904
01:02:15,992 --> 01:02:19,102
I just focus better when I'm working alone.

905
01:02:20,102 --> 01:02:21,102
Of course.

906
01:02:21,972 --> 01:02:25,472
Did you give Seong Jae an invite? He needs to invite his own guests.

907
01:02:26,302 --> 01:02:28,912
Not yet. I was planning to ask him first.

908
01:02:28,972 --> 01:02:31,542
- Right. - Seong Jae's been so busy.

909
01:02:33,382 --> 01:02:34,952
I know, he's been busy.

910
01:02:35,482 --> 01:02:37,012
Remarkably busy.

911
01:02:38,582 --> 01:02:39,752
Seong Jae? Why?

912
01:02:42,192 --> 01:02:43,222
I'm home.

913
01:02:43,992 --> 01:02:44,992
But...

914
01:02:45,462 --> 01:02:46,492
Someone's here.

915
01:02:47,592 --> 01:02:48,592
Who?

916
01:02:54,762 --> 01:02:55,772
Mom, I'm home.

917
01:03:49,422 --> 01:03:51,862
(Our Golden Days)

918
01:03:52,192 --> 01:03:55,732
You're in way over your head, you fool.

919
01:03:56,262 --> 01:03:59,062
Hey, Lee Su Bin. It's not your place to worry for Seong Jae.

920
01:03:59,132 --> 01:04:01,132
Who are you to worry about Seong Jae?

921
01:04:01,202 --> 01:04:03,802
Ji Gang Oh, come home. We're nothing to each other now.

922
01:04:03,902 --> 01:04:05,372
Do you want my name removed from the family register?

923
01:04:05,742 --> 01:04:09,772
I didn't commit a mortal sin. So I'm dropping the formalities.

924
01:04:09,842 --> 01:04:12,842
I'll call you by your first name. I don't care what you say.

925
01:04:12,912 --> 01:04:13,942
Excuse me, but...

926
01:04:14,582 --> 01:04:16,552
By any chance... Just maybe...

927
01:04:16,552 --> 01:04:18,782
Is there something you're hiding?

928
01:04:18,852 --> 01:04:20,952
What were you thinking, showing up out of the blue?

929
01:04:21,052 --> 01:04:22,152
Don't you think it's time people knew?

930
01:04:22,222 --> 01:04:25,792
Shut it. Do you want to live or die?
