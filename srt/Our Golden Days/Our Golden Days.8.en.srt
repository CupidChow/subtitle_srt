(Episode 8)

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:05,280
What...

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:07,610
brings you here?

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,010
Ji Eun Oh.

5
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,090
I have something to tell you.

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,390
What...

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,330
No.
You can't have anything to tell me.

8
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:24,530
I do have something to say.

9
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:28,300
- What...
- I'll spend the night here.

10
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,170
What?

11
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,610
I'll spend the night at the cafe.

12
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:38,940
Are you out of your mind?

13
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,450
Why would you sleep here?

14
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:41,450
Here?

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,320
I believe this is
Value of Hangyeol's hangout.

16
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,090
I know some sleep here
every now and then.

17
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:48,990
People like you.

18
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,790
I'm the manager of this cafe.

19
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:53,460
You're a manager, not the owner.

20
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,960
The manager has the authority...

21
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,260
and duty to manage the space.

22
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,830
I have nowhere to go.

23
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,770
You have a family here,

24
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:10,340
and there are hotels and motels...

25
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,610
I can't afford...

26
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,480
to go anywhere else.

27
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,120
Get home safely.

28
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,250
What?

29
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:30,660
I'll give you money
to go to a motel. Get out.

30
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,230
You still think that little of me?

31
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,400
You came
without so much as a call...

32
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,840
and demand to sleep here?

33
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,300
It's a no, so get out.

34
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,340
What if I don't?

35
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,670
Will you drag me out?

36
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,540
I said I'd give you money
to go to a motel.

37
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,310
Why take your money
when I can stay here?

38
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,890
Hey.

39
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,230
Did he come back with a screw loose?

40
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,660
It makes no sense.

41
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,460
What's wrong with him?

42
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,710
Darn it.

43
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,760
It's still cozy...

44
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,360
and relaxing.

45
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,350
How could he show up
looking like that?

46
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,120
I mean, how could he
even show up in front of me?

47
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,760
Does he think
I'm a pushover or something?

48
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,060
He must know
that I can be coldhearted!

49
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,060
But why?

50
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,460
Why does he want to sleep
at the cafe?

51
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,570
If he's back, he should go home!

52
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,970
How's he going to sleep there
without any sheets?

53
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,110
No way.

54
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,760
Ji Eun Oh, that spiteful thing.

55
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,890
The floor is so hard.

56
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,000
And she slept here.

57
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:02,210
(Cafe Agit)

58
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:17,230
What? Did he use my sleeping bag?

59
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:23,070
What?

60
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,840
Did you clean up the storage?

61
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,070
I guess he's in the bathroom.

62
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:35,710
Hey.

63
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,860
He didn't even move his stuff.

64
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,230
Who?

65
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,470
Whose toothbrush is this?

66
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,240
Does he think this is his own place?

67
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,140
He left all his stuff here.

68
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,270
Where did he go?

69
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,010
- Who are you talking about?
- Lee Ji Hyuk.

70
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,710
What? Lee Ji Hyuk? Did he come here?

71
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,880
He slept here last night.

72
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:09,350
He slept here?

73
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:11,650
What...

74
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,990
Wait, Eun Oh.
Where are you going? Hey!

(Jung Hyeon Su Architecture Lab)

76
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,930
I was surprised to hear
that you came to see me.

77
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,700
And the way you look
is even more surprising.

78
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,870
It's good to see you again, Ji Hyuk.

79
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,400
Is everything all right with you?

80
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,940
What's with you?
Why do you sound so polite?

81
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:39,210
I don't know.

82
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,680
You get ten minutes.

83
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,880
I have a meeting
with a client in 30 minutes.

84
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,180
Will ten minutes do?

85
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,680
- Sit.
- Hyeon Su.

86
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,750
Yes?

87
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:52,190
I have an item I want to try again.

88
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,290
I need an office.

89
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,990
Could you let me use
the storage room at Cafe Agit?

90
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,960
As for the rent,

91
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,160
I can pay 200 dollars per month.

92
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:02,000
Are you planning
to start a business?

93
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,770
- Yes.
- And?

94
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,540
- And what?
- What is the item?

95
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,940
I can't tell you that
in ten minutes.

96
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,940
I'll tell you once
I finish cleaning up the storage.

97
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,980
So, you just want me
to let you use the storage?

98
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,810
That's it? It's no big deal.

99
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,520
It didn't even take five minutes.

100
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,820
I have one more favor to ask.

101
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,860
Su Jeong.

102
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,000
I have a meeting in the morning.

103
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,400
Can I get an iced Amaricano to go?

104
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,400
Sure.

105
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,730
No.

106
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:37,800
Don't talk to Eun Oh.

107
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,910
Why? Is something wrong?

108
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,510
Ji Hyuk barged in last night...

109
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,650
and slept in the storage room.

110
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,210
Ji Hyuk came?

111
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,520
- Is he there now?
- No.

112
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:53,850
When she came,

113
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,350
he had already gone out,
leaving his stuff here.

114
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,530
Well... Then,

115
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,830
can you call me right away
when Ji Hyuk is back?

116
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,600
- Okay.
- I'll be back later for my coffee.

118
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,920
There's nothing worth keeping,

119
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,360
but you can't throw them away
without putting them in a trash bag.

120
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,330
Hello, Hyeon Su.

121
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:40,460
I'm here to see you, Eun Oh.

(Cafe Agit)

123
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:56,010
Ji Hyuk is planning
to start a business.

124
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,280
He wanted to use the storage room
as his office, so I said yes.

125
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:02,750
His office?

126
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,790
- Hyeon Su, that's...
- Eun Oh.

127
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,430
I...

128
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,660
want to cut him some slack.

129
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,200
You know what he's going through.

130
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,800
He wants to do something,
so I want to help him.

131
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,370
He'll only use half the storage,
and he'll pay rent too.

132
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,940
You should get 200 dollars
from him every month.

133
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:23,310
Maybe he will do some work
at the cafe,

134
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:24,740
but he will at least buy coffee.

135
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,120
You're the one
who will feel most uncomfortable.

136
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:37,790
When the cafe is closed,
you use this place by yourself...

137
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:39,420
as your office and your studio.

138
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:41,990
But still,

139
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,560
you two go way back.

140
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,570
Please try to understand.

141
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,110
Okay. I will.

144
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,230
If you block this side,

145
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,800
it'll be inconvenient
to move materials in and out.

146
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,470
I'll set things up
so that won't be the case.

What's the reason?

00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:33,180
Why did you show up here
with Hyeon Su behind you?

150
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:34,550
It's just as Hyeon Su said.

151
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,080
I wanted to start a business
and needed an office,

152
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,180
but I didn't have enough money.

153
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,890
And you want me to understand that?

154
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,550
That's the situation I'm in.

155
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,330
Hey, are you all right?

156
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:57,400

so I have no choice.

Ji Hyuk is clever.

160
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,410
But what kind of business
does Ji Hyuk want to start?

161
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:09,880
We have a customer.

Okay.

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,560
I don't feel like eating.
And I have some work to do.

185
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,400
What happened?

186
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,610
Hang on. I'm a little busy.

187
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,670
(When can you pick them up?)

188
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,410
Lee Ji Hyuk.

189
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:28,320
Seong Jae, let me finish
my work first. Okay?

190
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,220
No. You have to talk to me first.

191
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,360
You've become quite rude.

192
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,100
- Park Seong Jae.
- What happened?

193
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,270
Are you asking me
why I came back or why I'm here?

194
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:47,300
Tell me exactly
what you want to know.

195
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,910
It's both!

196
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,840
Why did you come back?

197
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,240
I get that you had to come back.

198
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,510
But why did you not tell me?

199
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,810
And why are you here?

200
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,620
You slept here last night?

201
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,090
You want me to tell you everything?

202
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,890
- Isn't it obvious?
- How so?

203
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,560
Why should I
tell you everything right now?

204
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,930
You're angry with me?

205
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:11,960
I was...

206
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,700
in the middle
of something important.

207
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,670
Can you give me my phone?

208
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,240
If you want to talk, wait inside.

209
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,350
You really...

210
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,600
I shouldn't have told him.

211
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:48,300
Why did you tell him?

212
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,930
They're friends.

213
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,000
He didn't tell him himself.

214
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,140
Park Seong Jae.

215
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,010
Seong Jae.

216
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,950
Don't tell my family anything.

217
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:02,710
You chased after me
just to tell me that?

218
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:03,750
Yes.

219
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,190
Why should I?

220
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,820
Why should I keep it from them?

221
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,960
You have to.

222
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,060
You have no right to tell.

223
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,060
Lee Ji Hyuk.

224
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,890
Do you know
how long I've known your parents?

225
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,660
How did you meet them
in the first place?

226
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:21,430
One,

227
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,530
you shouldn't do
what a friend doesn't want you to.

228
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,540
Two,

229
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,440
that's called being intrusive.

230
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,440
You showed up without a single call.

231
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,640
What about the situation
you're putting me in?

232
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:35,380
Why complain when you just
don't have to call them?

233
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,480
Ji Wan...

234
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,920
is my sister's temporary driver.

235
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:40,650
And Su Bin...

236
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,320
I'm doing something with her.

237
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,420
Everyone's worried about you,

238
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,160
and you expect me to lie to them?

239
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,330
A lot happened...

240
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,830
while I was away.

241
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,430
Yes.

242
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:59,470
You're way too inflexible.
I'm not asking you to lie.

243
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,270
Just don't say anything.

244
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,510
For how long?

245
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:08,280
I want to be the one
to greet my family when I can.

246
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,780
I don't want them to hear about me
from someone else.

247
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,780
"I'm back in Seoul,
and I'm starting a business."

248
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,990
"So don't worry about me.
Just give me some time."

249
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,460
If I say that, they'll ask questions
I'm not ready to answer.

250
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,860
Not yet.

251
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,990
That's what you should've said.

252
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:26,960
What business?

253
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,270
What are you thinking about doing?

254
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,440
Later.

255
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,870
I have nothing to say just yet.

256
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,240
I bet you think...

257
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,480
I'm letting my ego talk.

258
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,280
I'll be in touch.

259
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,520
What is he thinking?

260
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:58,630
You barely slept
after the nightmare last night.

261
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,130
Are you sleepy,
or do you feel unwell?

262
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,100
I'm tired. I just want to sleep.

263
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,370
Stay in bed, then. I'm going out.

264
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,380
I prepared lunch.

265
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,110
Why don't you eat with Mother?

266
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:15,410
No. I had a late breakfast,
so I'm fine.

267
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,980
- I'll see you later.
- Yes, bye.

268
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:46,940
This fool.

269
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:50,210
He left the money
as if he were in the right.

270
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:53,150
How could he think of moving
into the woman's house with nothing?

271
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,790
- You're still here?
- What?

272
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,130
What's that?

273
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,160
It's nothing.

274
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:08,100
I asked what that was.

275
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,330
- Let me see.
- No.

276
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:11,470
They're...

277
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:15,010
They're the checks
I gave to Ji Hyuk.

278
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,580
You mean the 80,000 dollars?

279
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,310
He added 20,000 of his own money...

280
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,910
to make it 100,000 dollars...

281
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,750
and left it under his pillow.

282
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,520
I found it
on the morning of his wedding day.

283
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,520
And you didn't tell me?

284
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,890
But... How come...

285
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:36,830
I thought...

286
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:39,730
he had that much money with him.

287
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,830
So I thought
he was traveling abroad...

288
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,870
or in the countryside
to clear his head.

289
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,140
That's why I was holding back.

290
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,110
That's why I was waiting.

291
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,440
You knew that...

292
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,680
and you didn't tell me, honey?

293
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:57,310
You'd have worried yourself sick
if I'd told you.

294
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:00,150
No. I would've...

295
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:02,590
No.

296
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:06,490
I'd have called him every day.

297
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,830
To tell him to come home safely.

298
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,460
I'd have left voicemails and texts,

299
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,330
begged, and pleaded.

300
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:13,930
I'd have done that every day.

301
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,370
I had no idea.

302
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,300
He can't come home
even if he wants to,

303
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,200
if he thinks
his parents don't want him back.

304
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,810
He wouldn't have
the courage to come back.

305
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:26,640
Should he have to work
to make money just to eat?

306
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,980
He doesn't need this money
to survive.

307
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,820
He'd even prepared to move out.

308
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:33,720
Why worry?

309
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,790
Mr. Lee!

310
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,190
Didn't you hear what I said?

311
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,890
I don't have a son
called Lee Ji Hyuk.

312
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,660
You don't. I see that now.

313
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,760
He's just as stubborn as you!

314
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,000
He was standing by a river
of all things.

315
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,840
Ji Hyuk...

316
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:57,110
was standing there
crying in silence.

317
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,140
I called and shouted to him.

318
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,380
I said, "Come here.
Come over here, Ji Hyuk."

319
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:07,150
But he didn't move.

320
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,360
You didn't tell me
in case I got angry?

321
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,530
What did you think
as you saw me calm and relaxed...

322
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:18,000
because I thought he had some money?

323
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,860
I shouldn't be here doing nothing.

324
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,400
Good for you.

325
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,100
Like father, like son.

326
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,600
He's no longer your son?

327
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,910
I don't feel the same.
He's still my son!

328
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,510
I dreamed of him last night...

329
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:34,950
and couldn't sleep a wink afterward.

330
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,150
Da Jeong.

331
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,520
Did you have a dream
about Ji Hyuk too?

332
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:44,290
Mother.

333
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,490
A bad dream, right? Mine was too.

334
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:50,560
Sang Cheol. About Ji Hyuk.

335
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,760
Should we report him missing?

336
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,000
Mother, please.

337
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,670
What if he's too ashamed...

338
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,870
and can't think of what to do?

339
00:19:58,870 --> 00:19:59,900
Mother.

340
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,070
What does that mean?

341
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,940
Ji Hyuk's not that weak.

342
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,910
How can you be so calm
when you're his parents?

343
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,650
I'm going to the police.

344
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,690
Stay right there, Mother!

345
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,290
Ji Hyuk is my son.

346
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,560
Did you give birth to him?

347
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:26,260
How do you think I feel?

348
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,800
Do you think you're more worried
about him than I am?

349
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,100
Why would you say something
so negative?

350
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,870
Da Jeong.

351
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:36,910
He's human too.

352
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,210
How could he reappear...

353
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,680
in a couple of months
after being treated like that?

354
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:45,680
He can't. No one could.

355
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:51,860
Do you think I feel fine?
That I don't mind at all?

356
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,000
I tell myself...

357
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,370
he wouldn't do that.

358
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,010
But my heart...

359
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:10,510
drops to the floor
a million times a day.

360
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,980
I still force myself to wait.

361
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,410
How could she even consider
reporting him missing?

362
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,850
Ji Hyuk said he'd come back.

363
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,990
He told me he'd come back.

364
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:36,470
Yes.

365
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,770
Da Jeong is...

366
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,140
She's his mom.

367
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,210
And she held back.

368
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,510
She kept it bottled up.

369
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:51,280
I thought she was indifferent,

370
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,850
and that I was the only one
feeling scared and anxious.

371
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,690
Of course, that's not the case.

372
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,560
She's his mom.

373
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,730
Did you have plans, Father?

374
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,670
No.

375
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,470
I was just about to go out
for a walk out of boredom.

376
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,880
I'm 87 years old,
and I've seen and heard...

377
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,520
a great many odd things.

378
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,190
Anything can happen.

379
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:35,990
Father.

380
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:38,500
Yes.

381
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,000
What kind of state
would Ji Hyuk be in?

382
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,970
Are you crying?

383
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,980
Father.

384
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,330
You're getting a call.

385
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:17,570
Let it ring.

386
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,200
I'm sure it's just Sang Cheol.

387
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,510
It's not.
There's only a phone number.

388
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,410
Hello?

389
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:33,450
Mom, this is Ji Hyuk.

390
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,160
Oh, hey. Just a second.

391
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,930
Hey, Ji Hyuk. Have you been well?

392
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,740
Yes.

393
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,640
I called, figuring you'd worry.

394
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,810
I see.

395
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,910
I'm glad you did, my eldest son.

396
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:03,910
Mom.

397
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:05,520
Yes?

398
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,950
It's nothing.

399
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,450
You don't have to worry about me,

400
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:14,960
but I still need some more time.

401
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:18,260
Of course. As you should.

402
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,260
Are you healthy and well?

403
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:22,670
I am, and I've been eating my meals.

404
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,570
Please tell Grandma that.

405
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,240
Got it.

406
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,270
I really want to ask...

407
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:32,440
where you are
and when you'll be back,

408
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,250
but I doubt it would matter to you.

409
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:38,850
Of course. You always know
how to read the room.

410
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:42,290
You'll be back
when it's time, right?

411
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:44,690
Sure, Mother.

412
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,760
All right, then.

413
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,930
Sang Cheol said he'd be here.

414
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,870
Look. There he is.

415
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:58,900
Goodness.

416
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,300
Father.

417
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:05,440
I'm sorry that
Ji Hyuk and I are being a bother.

418
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,310
There's no need to apologize.

419
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,380
It's not like
you need to save face with me.

420
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,720
A job cancellation can happen
to anyone.

421
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,090
Here, have this
and regain your energy.

422
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,060
Gosh, Father,
please save it for yourself.

423
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:23,630
Take it.
He's had it for some time now.

424
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,730
Sure. Thank you, Father.

425
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,700
By the way, why are you here?

426
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:34,640
Why were you on a call outside?

427
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,440
It's nothing you need to know about.

428
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:38,880
Take her home already.

429
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:46,280
You must've cried
in front of your father,

430
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:47,550
seeing how you seem less angry.

431
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:51,120
Ji Hyuk called a moment ago.

432
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,290
He's fine.

433
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:56,890
He's fine, so we shouldn't worry.

434
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,730
Was that the call from earlier?

435
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,300
Yes.

436
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:04,070
He sounded good on the phone,

437
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:07,540
which made me feel a lot better.

438
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,210
What could you do if he wasn't okay?
This is the bed he chose to make.

439
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,310
Whether he was right or not,

440
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,910
you know this is much harder on him.

441
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:19,420
Regardless of what you think of him,

442
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,380
I'm still disappointed in him.

443
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,510
What are you up to?

444
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:47,840
I forgot to do the books yesterday
because he barged in.

445
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,310
Min Ho,

446
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,280
check the scones
to see if the numbers match.

447
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,380
Sure.

448
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,290
- Right this way.
- Got it.

449
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:00,190
He must've already bought a desk.

450
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,730
The beer box is filled
with empty bottles now,

451
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:04,790
so take out the trash.

452
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,030
Sure.

453
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:13,440
Have you already bought a desk?

454
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,740
Yes, someone was selling
all his office supplies...

455
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,810
after closing his office,
so I bought them all.

456
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:19,040
Secondhand?

457
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:21,440
Wait, were all of these secondhand?

458
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:56,850
What's this?

459
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,820
A folding cot.

460
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:01,350
I'll work and sleep here.

461
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,950
Sleep here?

462
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,860
Are you saying you'll live here?

463
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,420
Yes.

464
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:11,330
All of this for 200 dollars?
You hit the jackpot.

465
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,270
We need to talk.

466
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,150
Is this why you went
to Hyeon Su directly?

467
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,250
So that I couldn't object?

468
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,180
Yes.

469
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,720
Were you always this selfish?

470
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,030
I thought you already knew
the worst about me,

471
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,490
given what you said.

472
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:45,130
What you really wanted...

473
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:47,030
was wealth and status.

474
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,360
That's all.

475
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,700
But you pretended otherwise,
as if you righteously sided...

476
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,900
with the little guys...

477
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:54,200
and stayed unmarried to remain free.

478
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,410
I'm furious that you lied to me
all this time.

479
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:57,970
The person I liked the most...

480
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:00,140
turned out to be
the very kind of person I despise.

481
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:02,850
That's why I'm regretting
everything I did for you,

482
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,620
not knowing who you really were.
I'll even forget about the way...

483
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,220
you faked our friendship too,

484
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,650
so don't acknowledge me anymore.

485
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,120
I thought I made myself clear,

486
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:14,090
yet you still managed
to annoy me again.

487
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:17,560
Are you saying I should put up
with you day and night?

488
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:19,400
You know how I feel about you,

489
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,670
and you also know I sometimes
spend the night here working.

490
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:24,830
When you stay the night here,
working or sleeping,

491
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,340
I'll be as quiet as a mouse
in the office.

492
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,970
Are you suggesting
we both stay here at night?

493
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:33,240
Consider me a stranger
and pretend I'm invisible.

494
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,950
I'll do my best to move out
as soon as possible,

495
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:37,180
but I can't promise anything.

496
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,620
You asked the landlady
for a favor...

497
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,080
to keep me from doing anything,

498
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,150
and I'm supposed
to act like you're invisible?

499
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,420
It's just what I expected from you.

500
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,040
You're lucky
you only have a headache.

501
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,880
This is enough
to drive someone crazy.

502
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,710
How come the day is so long?

503
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,810
Go and talk to Hyeon Su yourself.

504
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,950
Tell her the issue
you have with him.

505
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,850
It'd be faster to quit.

506
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,920
Hey.

507
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:20,890
What?

508
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:31,100
He must be serious
about starting his own business.

509
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:33,840
I wonder what he's planning to do
now that he's moved in here.

510
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,140
Darn it.

511
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:39,080
Will you be all right?

512
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,350
I'll pretend he's invisible.

513
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,780
That's what he also wants.

514
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:48,150
This is suffocating.

515
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:50,020
Min Ho, can you take a shift
this weekend?

516
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,320
I need to cut back on my time here.

517
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:01,300
By the way, when's the exhibition?

518
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,570
Soon.

519
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,900
Exactly. So when is it?

520
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:11,140
Why are you asking?

521
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:13,140
Am I not allowed to ask?

522
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,880
It's not something
a chauffeur should ask.

523
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:17,050
What?

524
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,980
What did you just call me?

525
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,850
- A chauffeur?
- Yes.

526
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,090
Has your family
still not hired a chauffeur?

527
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,930
I haven't heard anything
from my parents.

528
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:33,860
Hey, I'm not your chauffeur.

529
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,130
I'm driving you around for now...

530
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:37,700
as a favor to Seong Jae.

531
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:40,170
You're close to my sister's age,

532
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:42,340
so I took the job
to help out someone like a sibling.

533
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:44,910
How dare you act like my boss?

534
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,810
Hey, I've been letting it slide,

535
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,350
but if I had known
you were so haughty and naughty,

536
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,810
I wouldn't have taken the job,
no matter how hard Seong Jae begged.

537
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:55,220
My mom calls you a chauffeur.

538
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:57,250
She does?

539
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,960
That's too bad.
I don't want to be a chauffeur.

540
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,660
- What?
- You know how to drive, right?

541
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:04,730
Yes.

542
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:11,970
Then you should drive yourself home.

543
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,200
I'm not doing this.

544
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:27,480
My goodness.

545
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,320
What's wrong with her?

546
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:32,060
She never says hello to me.

547
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,820
Whenever I talk to her,
she pretends she didn't hear me.

548
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,490
Fine. So, she thought
I was a chauffeur.

549
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,360
That's not going to happen.

550
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,230
The pay was good,
and the family seemed nice,

551
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:42,730
so I was going to hold out,

552
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,870
but I just can't put up
with that rude brat.

553
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,770
Darn it!

554
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:54,140
There was a stalker,
who was really threatening,

555
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,380
and he hasn't been caught yet.

556
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:58,180
Yeong Ra was really shocked
and traumatized.

557
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:00,150
Traumatized, my foot.

558
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,850
She's just arrogant.

559
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:06,660
Ji Wan, I can trust you
and leave her in your care.

560
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,520
Take good care of her.

561
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:12,460
Darn it.

562
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:16,530
Gosh, seriously...

563
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,510
What?

564
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:36,750
What is she doing?

565
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,360
Hey, open it.

566
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,160
Hey. Open the door.

567
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,400
Hey, Park Yeong Ra.

568
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:03,610
You...

569
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:06,480
You are really terrified.

570
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:14,890
Don't worry. I'll protect you.

571
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,330
Well...

572
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,670
Open the door.

573
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,040
I'm sorry.

574
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,440
Well...

575
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:34,840
I'm sorry.

576
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:43,150
I'm sorry too.

577
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:46,020
Did she say sorry?

578
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,270
Did you learn sign language?

579
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:05,070
When? Why?

580
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,580
It's been over ten minutes.

581
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:08,010
Mom will call soon.

582
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,080
The cars on the streets of Seoul
can't operate like subways.

583
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,920
We haven't moved for ten minutes.

584
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:15,720
So what?

585
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:19,790
Oh, right.

586
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,630
There could be a minor accident.

587
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,030
All right.

588
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,700
I guess they are people
from another world.

589
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:36,240
Fasten your seat belt.

590
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,720
Hey, Yeong Ra.

591
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,850
Will you keep calling me
a chauffeur?

592
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:54,490
Your mom is aware that
I'm Seong Jae's friend's brother,

593
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:55,490
but she calls me a chauffeur?

594
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:58,160
Just because you have
a younger sister my age,

595
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,960
it doesn't mean...

596
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,200
you are my older brother.

597
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:03,430
I see.

598
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:06,240
So, that's how it is
in the world where you live.

599
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:10,340
Okay. I get it.

600
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:11,840
You can call me Chauffeur Lee.

601
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:16,550
Then do you want me
to call you Ms. Park?

602
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:18,920
No. You don't have to do that.

603
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,220
Hey, Ms. Ko is here.

604
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:35,500
What took you so long?

605
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,170
There was a minor accident.

606
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,940
It wasn't us.
It was the car far ahead of us.

607
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,710
Yeong Ra, did the car
come to a sudden stop?

608
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,210
Are you not hurt?

609
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:50,380
No.

610
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:54,250
It wasn't us.
It was the car far ahead of us.

611
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:57,750
I see. That's a relief.

612
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:00,790
Thank you.

613
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,890
All right. Let's go in.

614
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,200
I'll see you tomorrow.

615
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,510
My goodness. What a drama queen.

616
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,580
- Dad, I'm home.
- Hey.

617
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:25,720
You seem chipper today.

618
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,080
Did something good happen?

619
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:28,780
It was just like yesterday.

620
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:30,720
Was the chauffeur okay?

621
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:33,290
You said the same thing yesterday.

622
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:34,760
And the day before yesterday.

623
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,960
I'm just worried.

624
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:40,360
If you don't trust
Seong Jae's friend's brother,

625
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,400
how are you going
to trust a new driver?

626
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,270
Did you find a new driver?

627
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,640
If it were that easy,

628
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,070
we wouldn't have had to
get a temporary driver.

629
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:51,140
And it's Seong Jae's
friend's brother, of all people.

630
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:54,540
Seong Jae recommended him.
What's the problem?

631
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:59,880
It would be better
to have a stranger work for us.

632
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,550
You said that too.

633
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,650
If we made a mistake
or did something to upset him,

634
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:06,590
it would cause Seong Jae
to lose face.

635
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,530
You wouldn't do anything
that would embarrass Seong Jae.

636
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:14,230
Your mom can be
a bit too cautious sometimes.

637
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,970
Right. I'll be in my room.

638
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:18,970
- Okay.
- Okay.

639
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,910
Oh, dear.

640
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:35,080
Here.

641
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:36,820
It's ready.

642
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:39,420
My goodness.

643
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,490
I just can't thank you enough.

644
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:45,030
How come you never miss a day
ironing my underwear?

645
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:47,500
Are you not sick of saying that?

646
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,100
You'll get calluses in your mouth.

647
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:51,770
As I always say,
this is no big deal.

648
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:54,270
It's your underwear.
My husband's underwear.

649
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:57,310
The first thing that touches
your body should feel fresh.

650
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:01,180
And this is your work outfit
for today. What do you think?

651
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:05,110
My wife, Ko Seong Hui.

652
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,550
You are such a consistent person.

653
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:10,950
I like everything you recommend.

654
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,460
But you always ask for my opinion.

655
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,960
You're a truly amazing woman.

656
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,500
My gosh.
You always compliment me like that,

657
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,600
so that makes me want to try harder.

658
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:25,800
Mr. Park Jin Seok,
you know how to control me.

659
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:28,700
Go ahead and get changed.
I'll go check on Yeong Ra.

660
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,770
Okay.

661
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,080
Look.

662
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,950
Yeong Ra, you look puffy.

663
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:42,320
Why is that?

664
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:45,690
There's no way you ate anything
other than the salad I gave you.

665
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,690
I didn't eat anything else.

666
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:52,360
Have you been stretching
every morning?

667
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,930
Did you sleep on your stomach?

668
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,030
Don't tell me you took a nap
in the studio.

669
00:39:58,830 --> 00:39:59,940
I didn't.

670
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,940
Then why is that?

671
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:07,110
I can't lie down on the sofa
in the studio even for a moment.

672
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:12,750
Do I have to stay close to Ms. Jang
the whole time like this?

673
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:15,020
I think Ms. Jang can paint
in her studio...

674
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,720
and bring it like she used to do.

675
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,390
Have you forgotten already?

676
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:22,460
The stalker hasn't been caught yet.

677
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:25,760
What if he's secretly watching you?

678
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,100
What if he sees the canvases
being moved around?

679
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,600
I told you
nothing in life is given for free.

680
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:39,010
Nothing comes
without sacrifice and effort.

681
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:41,310
You know this is all for your sake.

682
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,950
All of this is for your future.

683
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:47,320
You are right, Mom.

684
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,420
I should stop here.

685
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,130
Nagging my brilliant daughter
for too long...

686
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:00,200
will only hurt her pride.

687
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:10,610
(Gaon Foundation)

688
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:31,360
Secretary Ko,
are you wearing the perfume again?

689
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:33,560
No, I'm not.

690
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,400
I can smell it. If you say
you are not wearing it, it's a lie.

691
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:43,070
And you don't have
the guts to lie to me.

692
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,580
So, you mixed it
with fabric softener.

693
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:53,020
Yes. It was too good to throw away.

694
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,620
Hey. I gave you
another bottle of perfume.

695
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:58,990
Throw away your old one.

696
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:02,930
It's fraud if you keep wearing
the old perfume.

697
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:07,860
Don't show that you're poor.

698
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,170
Did I give it to you for your sake?

699
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,640
I gave it to you to save my nose.

700
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,270
Get changed immediately.

701
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:17,310
Yes, Ms. Ko.

702
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:20,240
You got the list of galleries
the Soryu members...

703
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:22,040
do business with
and their curators, right?

704
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,110
Bring that to me.

705
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:26,150
Right, with the catalog
of the artworks they own.

706
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,350
Yes, Ms. Ko.

707
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,660
- Thank you.
- Thanks. Goodbye.

708
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,330
Hello.

709
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:38,130
Hey. Long time no see.

710
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:39,460
Hi, Hye Na.

711
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,530
Are you meeting a friend here?

712
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:44,470
No. I'm here to meet
my senior, Lee Ji Hyuk.

713
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:46,370
What for?

714
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:47,800
We agreed to meet.

715
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,710
He's using the storage room
as an office, right?

716
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,710
You're here, Hye Na.

717
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:58,050
- Go on inside.
- Okay.

718
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:00,280
Can we have two iced Americanos?

719
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:01,780
Okay. I'll bring them over.

720
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,550
No. I'll wait.

721
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:13,460
I put in the menu
you talked about last time.

722
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:14,960
Okay.

723
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,830
Good job, Hye Na.

724
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:21,940
It looks bare
without the company name or logo.

725
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,270
I have that already.

726
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:25,770
Put in the company name
and logo for me.

727
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,040
Let's do the search engine
optimization today too. Here.

728
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,510
(Making e a website appear higher
in the search result list)

729
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:34,380
Hey, you prepared everything
in advance.

730
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,750
Of course, I did.

731
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:37,790
I like it.

732
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:42,190
They're looking at something
on the screen and talking.

733
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:44,460
- That's weird.
- It is.

734
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:47,930
It's like
Ji Hyuk's a different person.

735
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:50,970
Let's focus on work.
I don't want to mind him.

736
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,170
Hye Na. Come here.

737
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:58,140
What did you do with Ji Hyuk?

738
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:01,840
He asked me
to make him a simple website.

739
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:03,210
What website?

740
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:05,850
He said you could all see it...

741
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:07,680
when it launches.

742
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,050
Oh, right.

743
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:11,550
You studied computer engineering
just like Eun Oh.

744
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,390
Is that why he asked for your help?

745
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:14,960
Yes.

746
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:17,160
He got back just two days ago.

747
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,960
About ten days ago? We met up then.

748
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:22,030
- Where?
- In Seoul.

749
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:24,670
In Seoul?

750
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:27,970
Were you surprised I called?

751
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:30,370
Yes.

752
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:33,340
You're going abroad
to take a language course, right?

753
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:34,940
Yes.

754
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:36,980
How about taking
a part-time job before you go?

755
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:40,150
You're weird too, Hye Na.

756
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,550
Why didn't you tell anyone
you'd met up?

757
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:45,020
Why should I tell anyone that?

758
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:47,390
He asked me to do a job for him.

759
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:49,890
What did you do today, then?

760
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:51,130
The SEO process.

761
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,230
That means the site is almost done.

762
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,360
Yes.

763
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:57,370
- I have to go now.
- Okay.

764
00:44:58,170 --> 00:44:59,700
Hey, Eun Oh.

765
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:02,240
Can you make a website in ten days?

766
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:05,640
Well, if you're making
a simple site,

767
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,240
it can be done in days too.

768
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:09,650
He's really driven.

769
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:13,220
I'm dead curious.

770
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,380
What business is he planning?

771
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:18,190
It's no business.
He's just bluffing.

772
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:19,990
He's bluffing?

773
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:22,120
He doesn't want to hide anymore,

774
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,790
so he has to come back,
but he's embarrassed he has nothing.

775
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,460
So he's pretending
to have a grand vision.

776
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:29,100
Business is no joke.

777
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:30,930
He can't launch that
and a site in two months.

778
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,600
If he were that capable,

779
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:35,170
he'd have become a CEO long ago.
Why did he work in an office?

780
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:38,070
He came back to our hangout,

781
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:39,940
where rumors spread the fastest.

782
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:42,440
That's exactly why he came here.

783
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:44,580
"I'm here to make a comeback."

784
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:47,020
"But my business
isn't doing so well."

785
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:48,380
He'll give up...

786
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:49,790
and find another job.

787
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,120
And then...

788
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:54,520
- And then what?
- He'll disappear...

789
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:56,430
from Value of Hangyeol.

790
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:01,200
You're so clearheaded
but coldhearted.

791
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,170
I've known him for ten years,

792
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:06,270
and he never said
he wanted to own a business.

793
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:08,970
He got someone to make a website
in just a few days.

794
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:11,070
Do you know
how simple that site would be?

795
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:14,910
Not to mention, you need more than
just a website to do business now.

796
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,210
You need an app too.

800

Yes. I'll launch the site soon.

801
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:42,340
I'll send you the link now.
It'll help with the planning.

802
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,840
Of course. Do you want to invest?

803
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:49,010
Then I'll give you a decent stake.

804
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:51,880
Yes. I'm a bit busy right now.

805
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,680
I'll call you tomorrow. Bye.

806
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:02,160

00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:04,030
My gosh.

808
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:05,790
Do I need to buy an electric fan?

809
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:39,260
What's that?

810
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,360
When did the door close?

811
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:51,240
What happened?

812
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:53,210
How weird.

813
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:17,770
What was that?

814
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:24,310
My gosh.

815
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:26,170
Your brother's wedding fell through.

816
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,510
Yes. It so happened.

817
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:31,780
Out of the blue?

818
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:33,820
Your father is jobless,

819
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,290
and your brother is now jobless too.

820
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,320
All you have left...

821
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:39,790
are your looks,
youth, and education.

822
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:41,720
You have just those three.

823
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:42,790
So what?

824
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:45,590
I'm a triangle,
so I can't date a hexagonal man?

825
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:48,800
I know that.

826
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:50,630
What can you give up?

827
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:53,240
The man's looks, age, education,

828
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:55,740
background, occupation, assets.
What of the six can you drop?

829
00:48:57,170 --> 00:48:59,040
I should pick a triangle?

830
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,680
That's not what I mean.

831
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:04,050
You have two strengths in that...

832
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:06,010
you're young and pretty.

833
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:09,350
You need to give up two things.

834
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,790
His age and background.

835
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:13,920
Okay.

836
00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:16,120
You chose wisely.

837
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:17,990
A young man...

838
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:20,130
is rarely rich with a good career.

839
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:22,230
And you know what such men are like.

840
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:23,600
They don't like women...

841
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:25,430
who have nothing saved up.

842
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:28,270
I didn't give up
on his looks, though.

843
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,340
I won't meet anyone
like the last guy.

844
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:32,940
And I want to see a photo
that wasn't retouched.

when I'm with my boyfriend.

You two dress
to complement each other,

858
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:24,790
but I'd love to see his face too.

859
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:27,430
I like this concept.
Keep showing him.

860
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:29,360
Post what your boyfriend's wearing.

871
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:51,520

what's important right now.

- I was just about to call you.
- Lee Su Bin!

899
00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:22,240
Why didn't you keep your word?

900
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:24,650
You said you would only show me
from the neck down.

901
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:27,250
Anyone who knows me
can instantly tell it's me!

902
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:29,120
When did you post this video?

903
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,690
How are you only checking it now
when I uploaded it ages ago?

904
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,890
Since you didn't say anything,
I thought you were fine with it.

905
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,530
You...

906
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:38,690
Edit the video right away.

907
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:41,660
I'm right outside your office.

908
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:42,760
I wanted to talk.

909
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:44,800
What?

910
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,740
You said you'd make sure
I was only shown from the neck down.

911
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:51,770
That was our agreement.

912
00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:55,380
I trusted you, which is why
I didn't check the video.

913
00:52:55,810 --> 00:52:57,210
I was going to,

914
00:52:57,710 --> 00:53:00,780
but your silhouette was so stylish.

915
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,020
Without your face,

916
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:05,150
it didn't work
and even looked scary.

917
00:53:06,690 --> 00:53:08,620
Still, your face was blurred out.

918
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:10,490
Why you...

919
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:12,860
It was hardly blurred,
so anyone who knows me...

920
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:14,300
can still tell it's me.

921
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:18,470
Edit the video
and upload the edited version.

922
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:23,640
Just appear in two more videos
on my channel.

923
00:53:23,970 --> 00:53:25,640
Why you little...

924
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:28,210
Now that you're old enough,
are you trying to negotiate with me?

925
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:30,910
Don't get cheeky,
and edit the video.

926
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:33,280
I won't ever be
on your channel again.

927
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:36,380
I'll blur out your face even more.

928
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:41,390
If Ji Hyuk were around,

929
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:44,230
I wouldn't have asked you
for this favor.

930
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:48,000
I would've asked Ji Hyuk.

931
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:53,800
I want at least someone
in our family...

932
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,140
to have found their footing...

933
00:53:56,970 --> 00:53:58,370
when Ji Hyuk returns.

934
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,310
You...

935
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,120
Ji Hyuk will be fine.

936
00:54:07,550 --> 00:54:08,880
Don't worry about him.

937
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:12,750
(Service Agreement)

938
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,700
The terms are laid out
in great detail.

939
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:23,500
I've reviewed it by myself
many times,

940
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:24,930
but I'm sure I missed something.

941
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:25,930
Got it.

942
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:31,370
You barely had your dinner today.

943
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:33,840
What is it?
Did you have something to say?

944
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:37,410
Well...

945
00:54:38,450 --> 00:54:41,280
How much do we spend a month?

946
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:43,250
Our living expenses?

947
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:46,050
Why would you suddenly ask me that?

948
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:48,060
You have a pretty good idea.

949
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:50,430
I never paid much attention.

950
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:53,530
What do we spend on the essentials?

951
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:56,360
The mortgage payment
on this house...

952
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:57,530
is 830 dollars.

953
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:00,040
Utilities,

954
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:01,600
private health insurance,

955
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:03,340
national health insurance,
and the national pension...

956
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:04,340
come to 1,000 dollars.

957
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:07,140
We spend another 1,000
on food and necessities.

958
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:09,110
We give 200 dollars
to your mother...

959
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:10,710
and 500 to my father.

960
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:11,980
Plus, there's your pocket money.

961
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,780
How much do you still need
now that you aren't working anymore?

962
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,550
Gosh, that's scary.

963
00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:22,220
It takes a lot of money
for a family to get by.

964
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:24,490
Well, we're a big family.

965
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:27,730
Why are you worrying
about this already?

966
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,830
We still have your pension
that Ji Hyuk left us.

967
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:37,070
You see,

968
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:38,540
I...

969
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:42,340
I'm thinking about studying
to be an electrical technician.

970
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:44,150
An electrical technician?

971
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,110
Yes, but that's just the first step.

972
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:49,220
My final goal is to be
an electrical engineer.

973
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,150
Being certified as one...

974
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:52,690
will open up many opportunities.

975
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:54,660
However,
because I didn't major in science,

976
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:56,690
I can't take the test right away.

977
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:57,730
Instead,

978
00:55:57,730 --> 00:55:59,830
once I become
an electrical technician...

979
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:01,730
and work in the field for a year,

980
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:04,870
I can take the test to become
an industrial electrical engineer.

981
00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:07,040
A year from then,

982
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,540
I'll be qualified
to take the test...

983
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:11,070
for an electrical engineer.

984
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:14,680
Just listening to you explain it
makes me dizzy.

985
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:19,180
If being an electrical engineer
makes it easier to get jobs,

986
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:21,380
why don't all science majors
go for it?

987
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,520
The test isn't easy
even for those...

988
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,490
who majored in science.

989
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:28,460
But you'll take it even though
you aren't a science major?

990
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:31,460
I'll prepare for the test
while bringing in money...

991
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:33,160
to support the family.

992
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:38,930
How long does it usually take
to become an electrical technician?

993
00:56:38,970 --> 00:56:41,970
About six months to a year.

994
00:56:42,470 --> 00:56:43,710
Look here, Mr. Lee.

995
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:46,140
Don't you think
this is more than you can chew?

996
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:49,480
You should get yourself
a simpler job like others,

997
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:50,650
even if it pays less.

998
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:52,950
We need to accept our situation.

999
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:55,150
What are you talking about?

1000
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:58,520
Am I supposed to go on
without a plan or future,

1001
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:01,160
looking for work and making
nothing but chump change?

1002
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:03,630
We still need to see
Ji Wan and Su Bin get married.

1003
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,030
Unbelievable.

1004
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:07,200
You've already made up your mind,

1005
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,930
so why bother explaining it to me?

1006
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:11,270
Well...

1007
00:57:11,630 --> 00:57:13,800
I felt guilty
for not discussing it with you.

1008
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:18,110
I couldn't stop you from doing this,

1009
00:57:18,370 --> 00:57:20,140
and I don't have the guts to try.

1010
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:22,140
I don't know
what other option we have.

1011
00:57:22,510 --> 00:57:23,910
Since that's the case,

1012
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:26,480
trust me
and be patient for six months.

1013
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:29,920
I'll become an electrical technician
and find a job.

1014
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:34,360
Only on one condition.

1015
00:57:35,490 --> 00:57:37,030
Don't bother with part-time jobs.

1016
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:38,930
Spend that time studying.

1017
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:43,900
Thanks for giving me
your permission.

You should've called.

Yes.

Director Seong Jae, are you sure
you're dressed right for this?

1034

into something a bit more casual.

Ggang Oh,
were you out drinking yesterday?

1048
00:59:50,290 --> 00:59:53,060
You're the one who drank,
since you came home after 2 a.m.

Mom, I wasn't out drinking.

Why did you get home after 2 a.m.
when you weren't even drinking?

01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,240
I was out playing a video game.

I told you I'd be doing so
once a week.

are the most diligent.

1056

But I doubt the game is that fun.

about an allowance anymore,

seeing as you won't
even call me your sister.

needs a complete overhaul.

1073
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:05,470
You might have to change
all the windows too.

1074
01:01:05,470 --> 01:01:06,530
That's the plan.

1075
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:09,700
It'll take about five weeks.
How's that for you?

1076
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:11,810
I'll put my stuff in storage
and stay with my parents.

1077
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:14,840
I got all the measurements.

1078
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:17,050
- I'll draft a temporary floor plan.
- Okay.

1079
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:20,680
(Cafe Agit)

1080
01:01:25,290 --> 01:01:27,090
I'll work and sleep here.

1081
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:32,460
The cafe's closed today,
and it'll be just us.

1082
01:01:45,510 --> 01:01:46,970
Why should I feel uncomfortable?

1083
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:09,930
What's that?

1084
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:16,540
I didn't know you'd be in today.

1085
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,110
What is all this?

1086
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:21,110
There are no windows.

1087
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:23,680
It was suffocating,
and Hyeon Su let me put in a window.

1088
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:27,350
This way, I can see
into the cafe from my desk.

1089
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:30,150
You have no idea
how hard I'm trying.

1090
01:02:31,990 --> 01:02:33,820
I can't see you even if I stand up.

1091
01:02:34,190 --> 01:02:36,490
And you can't see me
when you stand up.

1092
01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:38,190
That's why I put it high up.

1093
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:39,190
Why?

1094
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:41,700
Why not let it open
to let in fresh air?

1095
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:45,770
I wanted to, but I didn't.

1096
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,600
You'll keep doing this.

1097
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:51,170
I kept closing your door,

1098
01:02:51,170 --> 01:02:53,040
so you got Hyeon Su
to let you keep it open.

1099
01:02:53,310 --> 01:02:54,640
You felt suffocated,

1100
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:57,150
so you got Hyeon Su
to let you work in the cafe.

1101
01:02:57,580 --> 01:03:00,150
Because what Hyeon Su says goes,

1102
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:02,980
I have no choice
but to let you do what you want.

1103
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:05,420
No, it's not like that.

1104
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:06,490
It is like that.

1105
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:10,060
I didn't know
you could be so manipulative.

1106
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:13,690
Fine. I got it.

1107
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:16,060
Keep doing what you're doing.

1108
01:03:18,870 --> 01:03:20,070
Will you let me off a bit,

1109
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:22,700
Ji Eun Oh?

1110
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,010
"A bit?"

1111
01:03:24,310 --> 01:03:26,040
I won't bother you any further.

1112
01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:27,240
You won't.

1113
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:29,880
What?

1114
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:32,010
Because I quit.

1115
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:34,220
You'll what?

1116
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:36,620
I was the manager of this cafe.

1117
01:03:37,790 --> 01:03:39,190
I resign.

1118
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:20,430
(Our Golden Days)

1119
01:04:20,530 --> 01:04:21,960
- I need help.
- What is it?

1120
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:23,400
That's what you care about?

1121
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:24,830
Fire me if you want to.

1122
01:04:24,830 --> 01:04:26,530
I'll get fired if I deserve it.

1123
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:28,140
I'll become a successful YouTuber...

1124
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:29,700
and marry a rich man.

1125
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:30,870
Have you lost your mind?

1126
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:32,370
Do your parents know?

1127
01:04:33,110 --> 01:04:34,840
This is the first page
of your best friend...

1128
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:37,040
Lee Ji Hyuk's second chapter.

1129
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:39,180
Stubborn, right?

1130
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:41,180
Keep these three rules.

1131
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:44,050
Don't act like you know me.
Don't say hello.

1132
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:45,390
Don't talk to me.

1133
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:46,750
Is that even possible?

1134
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:48,320
Let's talk.

1135
01:04:48,390 --> 01:04:50,790
It's the first day,
and I want you to do it.
