1
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:03,140
You're already at the hospital?

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,970
What time did you get there?

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:09,240
I just got here a little early.

4
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,310
So Eun Oh is letting you stay in the room?

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,180
She doesn't know I'm here. I can see the room from here.

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,590
(Vice President Park Seong Jae)

7
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:20,550
Man, you must be on pins and needles.

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,790
Hey, when she goes into surgery, tell her I'm rooting for her.

9
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,830
I'd be lucky if I even get a chance to say anything.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,200
I don't know what it'll be like on the morning of the surgery,

11
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,670
so I'm not sure if I can just pop in.

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,100
Right, I get it.

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,170
You could go to work and see her after the surgery is over.

14
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,780
But I still want to see her before the surgery...

15
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,250
and wish her luck.

16
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:49,250
Then just go in there and wish her luck.

17
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,220
I'll handle it.

18
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:56,160
- I'm hanging up. - Hey. Tell me how it goes.

19
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:57,590
Will do.

20
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,260
Yes?

21
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,600
Sir.

22
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,830
The Chairman's Chief Secretary is on the line.

23
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:11,770
Dad!

24
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,180
I'm not dead yet.

25
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,340
Dad.

26
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,180
(Shoealls)

27
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,650
Did you call him?

28
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,780
I told you to let me rest.

29
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,190
Fine, get back to work.

30
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,090
- Yes, sir. - Oh, boy.

31
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,760
Dad, we need to go to the hospital.

32
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,730
It was just a dizzy spell.

33
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:37,930
I heard you were staggering. That's why you need to go.

34
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:43,770
My blood pressure probably spiked from dealing with President Choi.

35
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,070
What are you, a doctor?

36
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,540
It might not be your blood pressure. It could be your brain.

37
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,410
You need to take your age into account.

38
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,480
Stop treating me like I'm an old man.

39
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,550
I had a full checkup just a few months ago.

40
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,950
I got a clean bill of health.

41
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,490
If you keep refusing,

42
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,190
I'm calling Mom.

43
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,870
How can we get to Nebrance? I have so much to review today.

44
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,770
Then let's go to Cheong Ah Hospital. It's close by.

45
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,540
Let's go, Dad.

46
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,670
All right, fine.

47
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,980
He's been feeling dizzy on and off since yesterday afternoon.

48
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,650
- No underlying conditions, correct? - Right.

49
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,590
A few days ago,

50
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,690
there was a business matter that really got my blood boiling,

51
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,960
and I got a bit heated.

52
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:38,960
- Let's start with a brain CT, then. - Well...

53
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,800
I already had a brain CT at my checkup a few months ago...

54
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,830
Dad, just get the scan.

55
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,400
Are you satisfied now that you dragged me here for this?

56
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:56,240
The new product's reception, the restocking schedule...

57
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,010
There are a million things I need to handle.

58
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,880
The new product isn't more important than your health, Dad.

59
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,390
Playing the dutiful son now?

60
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:09,420
Anyone watching would think you're the son of the year.

61
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,690
I may not be the son of the year,

62
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:13,890
but I'm still your son.

63
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,170
The doors are closing.

64
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,710
(Ward 22)

65
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,200

66
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:54,430

67
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,300
(Good luck with your surgery. You got this!)

68

(Cheong Ah University Hospital)

70
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,130
You got this.

71
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,640
He saw me.

72
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,760
What's this guy doing?

73
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,570
Excuse me, surgical patient. Elevator priority, please.

74
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,610
It's just one floor. Let's take the stairs.

75
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:06,670
Yes, let's do that.

76
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,650
Hang in there.

77
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,910
But why would Dad come to the hospital?

78
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,710
And with Seong Jae, no less.

79
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,450
By the way, how are you so quick on the uptake?

80
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,980
I completely froze.

81
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,990
I don't know. I just had a feeling Ms. Ko shouldn't get caught.

82
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:53,890
You're right.

83
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,020
If my dad finds out Mom lied to him, he'll be so shocked...

84
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,630
No, it'd be more than just a shock. He'd never accept it.

85
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,200
My family would be completely torn to shreds.

86
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:10,440
But Ms. Ko recognised me earlier.

87
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:14,540
So what if she did? You're the one who saved my mom.

88
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,910
That's right. I did save her, didn't I?

89
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:24,280
Hey, we're in the clear. We really are.

90
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,490
Right now, you're basically my mom's lifesaver.

91
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,260
Maybe this will clear up her misunderstanding about you.

92
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,860
Come on, "lifesaver" is a bit much.

93
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,700
If there's one thing my dad hates, it's being lied to.

94
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:42,040
And the only person he trusts completely is my mom.

95
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,440
So what if the Chairman had seen your mom back there?

96
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,080
What would've happened?

97
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:52,810
At the very least...

98
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:55,620
Divorce?

(Operating Room)

100
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,360
- Mom, you should wait in her room. - What?

101
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,860
Our Eun Oh is having a major surgery.

102
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,900
I'm too nervous to just sit in her room.

103
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,240
She'll be okay, right?

104
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,740
She'll be fine.

(Cheong Ah University Hospital)

106
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,720
Good luck with your surgery.

107
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:37,920
Excuse me, one second.

108
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,330
I'm sorry.

109
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,670
It's okay.

110
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,240
Everything's going to be okay.

111
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,410
Okay? Don't you worry.

112
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:55,640
My goodness.

113
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,750
Right this way, please.

(Operating Room)

115
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,720
Could he have come here because he knows something?

116
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,990
Or is he just sick?

117
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,690
If he's sick, he might be looking for me.

118
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:15,900
He might even come here to find me.

119
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,570
No, what makes you so sure there were no calls for me?

120
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,400
Didn't you go to the restroom?

121
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:23,640
Check the incoming call log.

122
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:24,970
Right away.

123
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,210
If he were sick enough to call,

124
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,080
he would've called my cell first.

125
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,560
Maybe he got sick at work?

126
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:47,660
Why not go to his own doctor? Why that hospital, of all places?

127
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:57,870
Luckily, we found nothing wrong. It seems to be from too much stress.

128
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,540
See? I told you I was fine.

129
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,080
I swear, this kid gets worried over nothing.

130
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:06,780
What are you talking about, sir? Once you're over 60,

131
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,180
you need to get checked immediately at the first sign of a problem.

132
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,220
Why are you giving such a caring son a hard time?

133
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,150
Was I giving him a hard time?

134
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:18,090
So you're saying the dizziness could just be from stress?

135
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,860
- Yes. - Are there any other possibilities?

136
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,130
You don't need to worry.

137
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,360
You heard him. I'm all clear.

138
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:27,570
(Outpatient Clinic)

139
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,400
So, there's nothing wrong with me.

140
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,170
This was such a waste of time. I'm exhausted, kid.

141
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,080
It's a good thing that nothing's wrong, Dad.

142
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,480
Looks like Dad just had a checkup. I guess it wasn't anything serious.

143
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:44,250
Yes, that's a huge relief. He's not even being admitted.

144
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,320
Gosh, I'm so exhausted.

145
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:49,360
- Let's get out of here too. - Yes, let's go.

146
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,500
Hi, honey. What's up?

147
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,430
His voice sounds perfectly fine.

148
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,370
So it was nothing serious.

149
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:06,240
Honey, you said you had plans tonight, right?

150
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:09,440
If that hasn't changed, I think I'll make my own plans.

151
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:12,250
No, nothing's changed. But it's not like you...

152
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,780
to make plans at the last minute.

153
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:15,920
What?

154
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,320
Wait, your voice sounds a little off.

155
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,820
Are you feeling okay? Are you sick?

156
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,520
It's like you're psychic.

157
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,660
- It was nothing, but Seong Jae... - Dad.

158
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,060
- Yes. - I'll go get the car.

159
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,330
Honey, tell me what was wrong. Okay? Start with that.

160
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,140
It was nothing. I just felt a little dizzy,

161
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:41,940
but Seong Jae dragged me here for a CT scan.

162
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,510
- Nothing's wrong. Satisfied? - My gosh. You gave me a scare.

163
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,220
But what did they say was the cause? What did Dr. Han say?

164
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,750
Oh, Nebrance was too far,

165
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,690
so we came to Cheong Ah Hospital since it's closer.

166
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,430
Thank goodness Seong Jae took you there right away.

167
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,630
Okay, got it. You should go back to the office.

168
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,440
I panicked for nothing.

169
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,570
So exhausting.

170
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,940
Han Woo Jin's surgery will take more than eight hours.

171
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,010
We'll send you a text when the surgery is over.

172
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,280
Honestly, if something was wrong, he should've gone to his own doctor.

173
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,590
Does Seong Jae just drag his father to any old hospital?

174
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:40,800
Eun Oh, please...

175
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,540
Please...

176
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:55,110
Ji Eun Oh's surgery is complete, and she is now in the recovery room.

177
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,220
She'll be moved to her room in 1 to 2 hours.

178
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,250
She's been recovering for an hour and a half.

179
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,420
I wonder why she's not back yet.

180
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,160
Mom? They said her surgery went well,

181
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,760
so why are you still praying?

182
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,730
I can't rest easy until I see her myself.

183
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,070
She's just so frail.

184
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:15,500
I wonder if he feels the same way.

185
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,570
That guy from this morning... He's been here this whole time.

186
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:23,480
- He's been here this whole time? - Yes, I see him by the restrooms.

187
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,550
Really?

188
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:29,950
Do you think they might be dating?

189
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,750
No, I doubt it.

190
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,220
If they were, why would he be hiding and fretting like that?

191
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,790
Patient Ji Eun Oh is on her way from the recovery room.

192
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:43,560
She is? Thank you so much.

193
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:51,040
- This is the nurse call button. - Okay.

194
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:56,640
This controls her pain medication. If she seems in pain, press it.

195
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:57,880
Yes, I understand.

196
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,250
She'll likely sleep for the rest of the day.

197
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,180
Okay. Thank you so much.

198
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,720
Yes, thank you.

199
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,160
Eun Oh, sweetie.

200
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,590
You went through so much.

201
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,560
You must be in so much pain.

202
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,100
You did so well.

203
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:31,910
Hey, you.

204
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,710
Yes.

205
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,220
My sister just came back to her room from recovery.

206
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,320
Mom asked me to let you know.

207
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,190
How is she? She's back? Did the surgery go okay?

208
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,650
Eun Oh's all right, isn't she?

209
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:42,990
Yes, everything's fine.

210
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:46,860
But don't even think about trying to see her. She's asleep.

211
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,200
I don't need to see her.

212
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,860
As long as she's okay, it's all good.

213
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,570
Good. Now you can go.

214
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,030
You're making everyone uncomfortable.

215
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:57,540
So stop hovering around within 30m of her room.

216
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,570
All right, I get it, kid. See you tomorrow.

217
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,140
Gosh, you...

218
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,480
He's coming back tomorrow?

219
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,490
Did you stay until she woke up?

220
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,260
They said she made it back to her room safely.

221
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,160
You should try and reach out to her later.

222
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,100
Mr. Lee.

223
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:24,300
I have updates for you on HQ feedback...

224
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,900
and the week's schedule.

225
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:28,200
Perfect timing. Come on in.

226
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,400
Yes, sir.

227
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:37,640
He was at the hospital all this time and didn't even get to see Eun Oh?

228
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:42,520
So, from working together on the AP acquisition,

229
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,250
I felt we were really in sync.

230
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,450
Would you be interested in working more closely with me?

231
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:52,690
Don't tell me you already knew I was going to ask this.

232
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:57,200
See? This is exactly why I wanted to keep it a secret.

233
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,600
Okay, then I'll just ask you straight out.

234
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:03,200
The IT team is on solid ground now. As Assistant Manager of Planning,

235
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,770
would you be willing to be my right-hand man?

236
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,640
So, kind of like an executive assistant.

237
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:11,610
It's not just about managing my schedule.

238
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,980
I need someone who understands me and can help run the core business.

239
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,180
A key player.

240
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,750
You knew I was going to say yes, didn't you?

241
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,420
I had no idea.

242
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,290
I thought you knew how much I admire you.

243
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:29,400
Didn't you say you had an update for me?

244
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,480
Doctor, how is Woo Jin?

245
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,810
The surgery went well. He's in the ICU now.

246
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:49,680
My gosh. So he's going to be okay, right?

247
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,990
Well, the surgery went well, but he's in the ICU,

248
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:55,490
so we need to monitor him for at least a week.

249
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,660
But you can breathe a little easier now.

250
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,790
Thank you so much, Dr. Jin.

251
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,030
You should go home and get some rest now.

252
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,540
He's over the worst of it.

253
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,560
Good grief.

254
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,690
To think he was fooling around like that.

255
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:41,530
Mom, you're back.

256
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,270
What?

257
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,980
Mom, you must have been so shocked at the hospital earlier.

258
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,280
That was a really close call.

259
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:01,820
By the way, why was Dad at the hospital?

260
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,420
He didn't see you, right, Mom?

261
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:09,530
That driver of yours blocked me so he wouldn't see me.

262
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,900
Ji Wan is so quick on his feet, isn't he?

263
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,770
But what were you doing there anyway?

264
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,740
It was the day of Woo Jin's surgery,

265
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,340
so I wanted to cheer him on, even from afar.

266
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:27,180
By playing make-believe doctor with that loser?

267
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:29,220
What?

268
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,250
Mom, how can you say that?

269
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,550
We're the ones who saved you!

270
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,860
Wrong.

271
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,430
You were saving yourself.

272
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,830
If the truth about Woo Jin got out, our family would be destroyed.

273
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,470
You're well aware of that, aren't you?

274
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,840
That's why he hid me away.

275
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,870
You know your life would be a mess if your dad and I divorced.

276
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,510
I'm tired. Get out.

277
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:14,690
(Lee Sang Hoon, VP of Jinhwa Pharmaceuticals)

278
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,360
My gosh.

279
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:20,330
Hello?

280
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,070
Hello, ma'am.

281
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,710
This is Lee Sang Hoon, VP of Jinhwa Pharmaceuticals.

282
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:30,940
Yes. Vice President Lee.

283
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,920
I just had a feeling Ms. Ko shouldn't get caught.

284
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,760
You're right.

285
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:46,230
If my dad finds out Mom lied to him, he'd never accept it.

286
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:49,630
If there's one thing my dad hates, it's being lied to.

287
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:53,230
So what if the Chairman had seen your mom back there?

288
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,940
What would've happened?

289
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,740
At the very least...

290
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,270
Divorce?

291
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:06,280
Did Mom really read my mind in that moment?

292
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,850
Then what does this mean for my deal with Mom?

293
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,490
(Thank you.)

294
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:19,330
Ha Eun, I just wired you your share. Check your account, quick.

295
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,030
For real?

296
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:25,530
Su Bin, are we really making some serious money now?

297
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:29,940
I told you! It's the "grandma effect," right?

298
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,110
I can't argue. Things took off after we raided Grandma's closet.

299
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:37,210
Jo Ok Rye's Senior Model Challenge.

300
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:40,810
We'll give Grandma half the profits from this.

301
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,950
Of course. I even have the cash envelope ready.

302
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:48,550
(Thank you.)

303
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,990
An appearance fee?

304
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:54,130
Not all of it. Half is spending money from me,

305
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:56,360
and the other half is your YouTube appearance fee.

306
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:01,200
Wow, this is a thick envelope. Are you sure this isn't too much?

307
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:04,840
Grandma, I'm giving it to you because you've earned it.

308
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,810
You think I'd just give you everything I make?

309
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,840
You're really making enough to be giving me money?

310
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,710
I sure am. And it's mostly thanks to you.

311
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,350
Grandma, if things go well, I might start Ok Rye Entertainment.

312
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,890
A management agency specialising in senior models.

313
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:24,060
My gosh, what are you even talking about?

314
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,730
- Make some sense. - For now, go on a spending spree.

315
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,960
Starting next month, I'll deposit your YouTube fees directly.

316
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,130
What did you say?

317
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,540
- Grandma. - Yes.

318
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,040
Can you teach me how to make that porridge?

319
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,740
Your porridge is way better than Mom's.

320
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,710
Ji Hyuk, why porridge?

321
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,880
Stop!

322
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,750
Okay.

323
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:54,290
All right.

324
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:08,330
Just who is this amazing girl...

325
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,670
for you to make her thin rice gruel, not even regular porridge?

326
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:16,810
Man, this takes forever.

327
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,080
Of course, it takes time to make thin gruel.

328
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:21,810
What kind of surgery did she have?

329
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:27,190
My eldest grandson's partner has to be healthy, Ji Hyuk.

330
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,260
She's perfectly healthy, Grandma.

331
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,160
Don't worry.

332
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:33,990
Don't worry.

333
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,930
Hey, honey.

334
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,430
You really have no idea who she is?

335
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,170
Who on earth is this girl making our son act like this?

336
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,840
I wonder too. He must really like her.

337
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:51,010
That's not liking, that's just crazy.

338
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:56,420
Right. You never make me porridge. You only buy it, never make it.

339
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:00,150
Exactly! That's what I'm saying. The boy's gone crazy.

340
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:02,690
Good grief. Next thing you know, he'll be making her rice balls.

341
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,460
Making porridge, or gruel, or whatever it is. Unbelievable.

342
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,830
My gosh. I'm so curious to know who she is.

343
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,300
And he says they're not even dating.

344
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,440
I thought she'd at least say, "Thank you for saving me."

345
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,740
I didn't help her expecting a thank you.

346
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,450
Besides, she's not going to break our deal, right?

347
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,850
You mean, about firing you?

348
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,290
I was worried at first too, but she can't do that.

349
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,320
She'd have to tell my dad to do that.

350
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:38,890
Then I wouldn't stay silent either.

351
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,360
Exactly.

352
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,300
Anyway, now that we've seen Woo Jin through his surgery,

353
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,630
let's just focus on our series.

354
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,900
- Okay. - What do you feel like drinking?

355
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,570
An iced Americano? Or matcha?

356
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,810
An iced Americano and a scone.

357
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:57,310
- Got it. Lock up after me, okay? - Okay.

358
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,940
What the...

359
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:34,580
Darn it...

360
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:47,790
What's wrong with your leg?

361
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,830
I almost died just now.

362
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,600
What happened?

363
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:01,270
Some crazy guy on a motorcycle was swerving and nearly hit me.

364
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:04,210
If I weren't a PE major, I'd probably be dead right now.

365
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,280
Hey, you're really scraped up.

366
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:09,180
We need to disinfect that. I'll get supplies from the pharmacy.

367
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:21,260
Hey, where do you think you're going by yourself?

368
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,660
Besides, I already put together a first aid kit.

369
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,900
You did?

370
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,800
You should have said so earlier.

371
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,910
Where is it?

372
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:39,650
- Ouch, hey. - Hold still. I have to apply this.

373
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:19,590
Looks like So Ri and Dokgo Chan are finally getting some rest.

374
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,350
Yes.

375
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:24,990
Remember first seeing the house? I told you I loved this alley.

376
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,490
I've been thinking about it ever since.

377
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:29,290
This alley is gorgeous, isn't it?

378
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:31,330
It really is.

379
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,010
Why does this keep getting in the way?

380
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:42,470
What does?

381
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,640
Your hair.

382
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,320
All this time...

383
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:57,590
I'm sorry for always yelling at you about not living your own life.

384
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:01,130
Where is this coming from?

385
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,530
It must've been so hard on you.

386
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:07,270
I've only been judging you by what I could see.

387
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,100
Since I knew nothing about Director Ko.

388
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,170
How did you get through it all?

389
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,750
You're just like Dokgo Chan.

390
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:22,010
I am?

391
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,350
You know how Dokgo Chan is.

392
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:30,090
He's blunt and a man of few words, but he cares so much about So Ri.

393
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,360
Come to think of it, you two are exactly alike.

394
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:39,200
It's not like I was trying to copy his character.

395
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:41,400
I know.

396
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,270
I looked in the mirror earlier. I thought I looked fine.

397
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,640
So why is everyone standing there staring at me?

398
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,450
You've got some colour back.

399
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:37,550
The surgery must've gone well.

400
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,690
I don't know why,

401
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,420
but I'm just so moved, Eun Oh.

402
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:47,190
Did the surgery go well for him too?

403
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:50,860
He's in the ICU right now.

404
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:56,340
He's very lucky to have a friend like you.

405
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,880
Eun Oh, what did it feel like when you woke up after surgery?

406
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,480
What was the first thing that came to mind?

407
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,010
When I opened my eyes,

408
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,190
I thought, "I'm alive."

409
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:15,820
Of course.

410
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,790
It's an incredible thing to be alive.

411
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:22,030
You're right.

412
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,000
Being alive...

413
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,800
was truly an incredible feeling.

414
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,070
You have to be alive to do anything, after all.

415
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,540
I guess that's why our hearts keep beating.

416
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:38,010
That's so true. When you really feel alive,

417
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,080
your heart just pounds, whether you're excited or startled.

418
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,750
Then, thanks to me,

419
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,090
you all got to feel what it's like to be truly alive today.

420
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:52,090
We sure did. Thanks to you, Eun Oh.

421
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:04,200
- Let's get going. - Already?

422
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,270
Already?

423
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,040
Come on, we've checked on her. Eun Oh needs her rest.

424
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,510
Let's go.

425
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,250
- Hello. - Hello.

426
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,720
- I brought some rice gruel. - Okay.

427
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:23,190
Could you please give this to her when she's allowed to eat?

428
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:25,790
- Okay, I will. - And if anything comes up,

429
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:29,590
- please call this number. - Okay, will do.

430
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,660
Rice gruel?

431
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:33,500
I'm heading out.

432
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:05,230
Su Jeong, I'll meet you at the car. I just need a word with Ji Hyuk.

433
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,360
Okay.

434
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:14,510
What's wrong? You can't tear yourself away?

435
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,610
I think I'm starting to see why people get married.

436
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:21,810
What do you mean by that?

437
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:25,380
With all that Eun Oh's been through recently,

438
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:29,790
I found myself thinking, "What if I were her husband?"

439
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,560
Then I could be there for her through thick and thin.

440
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:40,700
- Right now, I can't do anything. - I know what you mean.

441
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,570
So I guess that's why people get married.

442
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:45,870
(Lee Su Bin)

443
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:50,880
Hey, pick it up.

444
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,720
It's nothing. I don't need to get it.

445
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,750
What's with you, Park Seong Jae?

446
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,790
What? Why?

447
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,120
Are you seeing someone?

448
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,760
Seeing someone? Don't be ridiculous.

449
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:07,830
Come on, what is it then?

450
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,860
Who is it? When are you going to introduce us?

451
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:12,530
Not just yet.

452
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:15,030
"Not yet?"

453
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:21,570
No, wait... I have a bad feeling about this.

454
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:24,940
Don't tell me you're in love with someone you shouldn't be.

455
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:29,050
There's no such thing as a forbidden love.

456
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:30,850
Then why say, "Not just yet?"

457
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:35,650
It's just... I can't tell you anything yet.

458
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:39,160
Look, just drop it. What's your deal?

459
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,300
What was that?

460
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:45,430
Why is Park Seong Jae being so serious?

461
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:47,770
What's with him?

462
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:16,190
Park Yeong Ra.

463
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:29,570
Is there something you wanted to talk about?

464
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,880
Any news on that driver?

465
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:35,510
- Excuse me? - The bodyguard, Lee Ji Wan.

466
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:38,950
Why are you suddenly asking about Ji Wan?

467
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,920
Because I have my reasons.

468
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,070
Oh, no. Why are you shaking like that?

469
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,870
You look like you have something you want to ask me.

470
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,970
Did you...

471
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:03,010
Did you do something, Mom?

472
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:05,310
Do what?

473
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:08,250
Did that bodyguard of yours get hurt or something?

474
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:11,120
I almost died just now.

475
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:17,290
If he did, I'm sure it was just a coincidence.

476
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,430
Accidents happen all the time.

477
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,100
You see it on the highway signs all the time.

478
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:31,540
Some crazy guy on a motorcycle was swerving and nearly hit me.

479
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:37,240
"Number of traffic fatalities today."

480
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,950
Not a single day goes by without someone dying.

481
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:44,750
- Mom. - Yeong Ra.

482
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:50,020
You think I'd let my dear daughter be with someone so beneath her?

483
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,290
Did you really think I'd just let it go?

484
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:58,860
Did you think I'd let that punk have my precious daughter?

485
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:04,440
Either you die, or he does.

486
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,340
So, who should it be?

487
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:09,510
Mom...

488
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,810
How could you?

489
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,050
We haven't even done anything...

490
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,120
Because it's obvious what you're going to do.

491
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,590
I heard from Vice President Lee Sang Hoon.

492
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:23,920
He wants to keep seeing you.

493
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,660
So that's what this was about.

494
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,430
You know how people are.

495
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:34,230
When they have a brush with death or a close call,

496
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:37,000
they think, "I dodged a bullet. I need to be more careful."

497
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,640
Perhaps, what your bodyguard went through...

498
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:44,210
was probably a lucky warning, don't you think?

499
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:49,880
To appreciate how precious his life is.

500
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,750
How did it come to this?

501
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,680
Get a grip, Lee Ji Wan.

502
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:31,120
Snap out of it. She's Seong Jae's sister!

503
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,150
It's cold.

504
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,360
Ji Wan.

505
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:11,300
I'm not going out today.

506
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,130
I have a cold.

507
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:15,730
You should rest at home, too.

508
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,140
And don't go wandering around just because you have the day off.

509
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,400
Just rest at home.

510
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,440
A cold?

511
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:26,410
She must have been outside too long in the cold yesterday.

512
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:30,850
Is it a bad cold?

513
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:32,550
Are you feeling really sick?

514
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:35,990
Wait, could it be...

515
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,060
because of what happened yesterday?

516
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:43,960
(Is it a bad cold?)

517
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:56,510
All right.

518
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:58,710
If you think you need to see a doctor,

519
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,450
call me right away. I'll be waiting at home.

520
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:09,120
What am I going to do?

521
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:18,830
What is it?

522
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:21,600
Yeong Ra has a migraine, so she's staying home today.

523
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,230
She asked for some painkillers.

524
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,870
Make sure she has some soup first.

525
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:32,080
I can read her like a book.

526
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,600
I told you not to take medicine on an empty stomach.

527
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,600
Mom.

528
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:02,570
There's something I need to tell you.

529
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,510
What? When you're feeling so sick?

530
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,110
Tell me tomorrow.

531
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:08,350
Actually...

532
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:12,320
I've been working on a webtoon.

533
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:14,820
A webtoon?

534
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:17,320
You mean, like a comic?

535
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,120
Yes.

536
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,930
I've been working on one by myself for a while.

537
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:24,960
And I've been having so much fun with it.

538
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:26,930
And then...

539
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,900
You even signed a contract?

540
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:34,470
Mom.

541
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,910
Please, can't you just let me finish this one webtoon series?

542
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,350
So you've been lying to me this whole time.

543
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:42,680
You two have been lying to me all along!

544
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,120
Mom, please.

545
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,890
Two months. Just give me two months.

546
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:54,230
It's just that I really want to see this through to the end.

547
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:57,760
Just let me do this one thing, and I'll do whatever you want.

548
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:01,000
I'll even meet Vice President Lee Sang Hoon again.

549
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
And marry him?

550
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:06,500
I'll at least meet with him.

551
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:08,410
I'll give it a real shot.

552
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:10,240
So please...

553
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:13,980
Can't you just let me finish publishing this series?

554
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:19,080
She's gotten all these wild ideas in her head.

555
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:25,360
The contract with Neiro isn't even in your name.

556
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:30,630
It's still my creation. I'm the artist.

557
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:34,230
I'll pay the cancellation fee. Have your driver handle it and quit.

558
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:35,830
Mom!

559
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,240
Get up. You're going to scrape your knees.

560
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,810
Why can't you just let me do this one thing?

561
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:50,380
I'm on my knees begging you, and you can't give me two months?

562
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:53,350
I'm begging you. Why won't you let me?

563
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,050
Finish it for what?

564
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,720
You think two months is a short time?

565
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,490
You think I'm going to let you spend two more months with him?

566
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,230
Then I'll...

567
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:04,430
tell Dad about Woo Jin.

568
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,460
And you think I'll just sit back and do nothing?

569
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:09,630
That will just make me even angrier at him.

570
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,070
Go on. Tell your father.

571
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,100
Yes?

572
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:45,540
How are you feeling?

573
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:49,170
- I'm feeling better. - You said you could eat porridge.

574
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:52,210
You brought all this?

575
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:55,250
Wait, did your mother make all of this?

576
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:57,280
No, it's a recipe from my grandmother.

577
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:58,820
I made it myself.

578
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:02,220
- No way. Really? - Yes.

579
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,190
Here, let me open it.

580
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:32,150
I have the flu.

581
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,990
I can't go to the studio for a while.

582
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:56,270
Yeong Ra.

583
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:59,110
You're not trapped in your house, are you?

584
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:02,380
No, it's not like that.

585
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:06,620
She said she was sick,

586
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:08,650
but she posted it right on schedule.

587
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:10,050
(Episode 53, New)

588
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,910
You have a meeting at HQ today.

589
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:34,510
Can you postpone that?

590
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:36,610
I'd advise against going.

591
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,280
Excuse me?

592
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:45,360
Oh, Mr. Lee. I just spoke with Eun Oh.

593
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:47,390
She's been discharged and is on her way home now.

594
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:49,330
I see.

595
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:02,410
I'm just really happy you're recovering so quickly.

596
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:04,380
Mom, I told you.

597
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,910
- That I'd get better fast. - You're not fully recovered yet.

598
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:12,680
You need to take it easy at home. Get plenty of rest.

599
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:14,950
I will.

600
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:17,390
By the way...

601
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:20,320
How's Woo Jin doing?

602
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:22,760
He's still in the ICU.

603
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:26,260
They'll move him to a regular room in a few days.

604
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:31,040
Hello.

605
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:32,940
Mother!

606
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:34,340
My gosh, Seong Jae.

607
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:37,310
What brings you here?

608
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:41,050
I heard you got a new job, so I had to stop by.

609
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:43,410
- Here! - Gosh, thank you.

610
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:45,650
I see. Well...

611
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:49,020
You look great.

612
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,420
Oh, I do?

613
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:57,560
Yes. You look healthy and vibrant, and you seem so much brighter.

614
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Has something good happened to you?

615
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:02,370
It's because I feel so good to be here.

616
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:04,600
I can see you and buy Grandma a gift.

617
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:06,670
A gift for Grandma?

618
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:08,670
But your grandmother passed away.

619
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,580
I mean Ji Hyuk's grandmother.

620
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,810
She's finally made her debut as a model.

621
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:15,350
She'll have to keep practising her walk, so...

622
00:45:15,850 --> 00:45:18,680
Oh, I thought it'd be nice for her to have one of these at home.

623
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,150
My own grandfather used to use this product.

624
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:24,460
You're getting a gift for my mother-in-law?

625
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:29,660
Mother, I can afford it. Father can use it sometimes too.

626
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:32,860
I'm holding off on getting you one because I'm worried...

627
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:34,130
Ji Hyuk might yell at me.

628
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,370
I'm sure she'll love it.

629
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:42,740
She said it helped relax her muscles and improve her circulation.

630
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:44,610
Great, then...

631
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,740
could you ring this up and arrange for delivery, please?

632
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:50,210
Yes, here you go.

633
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:51,980
Thank you.

634
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,850
- Good work today, Da Jeong. - Thank you.

635
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:59,360
Seong Jae. I'm getting off work now. Do you want to have dinner with us?

636
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:04,660
Yes, I'd love that.

637
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:09,800
We're here with the mega-successful senior model, Jo Ok Rye,

638
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,370
filming a slice-of-life scene for her grand finale.

639
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:17,240
Grandma always makes rice in a pot instead of a rice cooker.

640
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:20,080
And it tastes absolutely amazing.

641
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:25,420
Almost there.

642
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:29,090
Grandma, look over here.

643
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:33,190
So cute.

644
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:37,260
- Grandma, I'm here! - Well, look who it is!

645
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:38,760
It's Seong Jae.

646
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,530
Oh, it's good to see you.

647
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,340
- My gosh, hi. - Hello, have you been well?

648
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,400
Yes, of course.

649
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:47,970
Hey, Su Bin. Hi.

650
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:50,170
Hi, Seong Jae.

651
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:53,210
Mother, you've already started dinner?

652
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:55,180
I told you we'd do it together.

653
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:57,780
Making the rice and stew isn't a big deal.

654
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:00,890
How'd you know Seong Jae was coming? You even made doenjang stew.

655
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:03,350
Seong Jae, we're having doenjang stew...

656
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:04,420
with spicy pork and squid.

657
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:07,390
Doenjang stew too? What a feast!

658
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,740
No, I'll contact you when I'm ready.

659
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:24,440
She said she'd contact me when she was ready,

660
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:26,380
but I haven't heard from her at all.

661
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:30,180
Gosh, did something actually happen to her?

662
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:33,680
This is driving me nuts.

663
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:38,220
No way...

664
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:50,030
Wait, was Yeong Ra mad about what happened that day?

665
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:52,840
No, that's not it.

666
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:55,810
We were totally fine afterward.

667
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:01,250
Maybe she went home and had second thoughts?

668
00:48:03,310 --> 00:48:04,480
Just say something.

669
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:07,420
Please, just tell me, Yeong Ra.

670
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:12,020
Ji Wan, dinner's ready.

671
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:14,020
I'm not hungry.

672
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:16,530
But Seong Jae's here. We made spicy pork and squid.

673
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:18,600
Seong Jae is here?

674
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:33,640
Ji Wan. You've got a few days off, so why don't you take a trip?

675
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:34,950
Why have you just been staying home?

676
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:38,280
I might get called in anytime. How can I go anywhere?

677
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:42,750
Hey, by the way, is something wrong at your house?

678
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,990
No, nothing special. Why? What's up?

679
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,230
Is this about Yeong Ra?

680
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,760
She seems to be really sick with a bad cold.

681
00:48:57,070 --> 00:48:58,400
So she's actually sick.

682
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:01,070
What a relief.

683
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,610
Seong Jae, how's the spicy pork and squid?

684
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:06,980
Is it as good as you remember?

685
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:09,510
Of course.

686
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,120
And my doenjang stew?

687
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:14,750
I want to take a whole pot home, Grandma.

688
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:17,220
You're such a sweet talker.

689
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:22,060
Su Bin, why are you so quiet over there?

690
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,200
I'm busy eating.

691
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:40,880
This is delicious.

692
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:49,950
That was so delicious. Thank you so much, Mother, Grandma.

693
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:52,060
You're such a pleasure to cook for.

694
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:54,530
Don't be a stranger. Come by more often.

695
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:57,260
I will, Grandma. I'd better get going.

696
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:04,300
Oh, I completely forgot about that.

697
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:06,240
I'm just off to the stationery shop. I'll be right back.

698
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:07,640
Right, my jacket.

699
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:27,890
Hey, gosh.

700
00:50:34,870 --> 00:50:38,670
Why did you go to Mom's store without telling me?

701
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:43,110
I bought a gift for your grandma.

702
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:47,310
The mat Grandma wanted to get for your dad.

703
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:52,220
Buying just 1 for him felt weird, but I worried 2 would be a burden.

704
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:54,550
So I got one for them to share.

705
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:56,990
You remembered that?

706
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:00,390
You think I bought it just because you said so?

707
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:04,260
I was already thinking of a gift for Grandma's modelling debut.

708
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:07,200
I can't believe how thoughtful you are.

709
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:13,940
Hey, what are you doing? We're right in front of your house.

710
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:15,640
Because you're adorable.

711
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:17,610
Oh, my goodness.

712
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:22,750
I had a hunch and came out to check, and I was right.

713
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,080
Grandma, it's...

714
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:29,290
- I'll explain everything. - Explain what? That you're dating?

715
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:37,930
Go around the corner if you're going to do that.

716
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,600
Someone's going to walk by and see.

717
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:47,070
Grandma.

718
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:56,980
Grandma. How long have you known?

719
00:51:58,650 --> 00:52:00,550
You said you were filming me,

720
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:02,590
but you were busy giggling and texting.

721
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:07,190
At the fashion show, I saw some guy who looked just like Seong Jae,

722
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:10,760
staring holes right through you.

723
00:52:11,330 --> 00:52:12,500
And it really was Seong Jae.

724
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:15,770
So is that why you left by yourself that day?

725
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,430
Because of me and Seong Jae?

726
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:19,700
No, that's not it.

727
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:24,380
You two were acting so suspicious at dinner that I followed you out.

728
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:27,980
So are you against us, Grandma?

729
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:34,390
You are adults who like each other. It's not my place to approve or not.

730
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:39,220
Besides, I've always liked Seong Jae.

731
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:40,490
He's a good kid.

732
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:42,030
Really?

733
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:45,000
- Oh, dear. - That's my grandma!

734
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:48,170
- You're so happy. Gosh, stop. - Thank you.

735
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,410
Eun Oh, have some fruit.

736
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,040
Okay.

737
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:07,790
Oh, boy. All I do is eat and rest.

738
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:10,190
I'm really living the high life.

739
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,290
This must be hard on you, Mom.

740
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:14,790
Having to care for me all the time.

741
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:19,600
You haven't rested in over ten years ever since your dad passed away.

742
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,670
So how could this be hard on me?

743
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:27,370
Seeing you rest makes me so happy, no matter what led to it.

744
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:31,310
I just want to keep feeding you and watching you sleep.

745
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:34,210
Let's put some meat on your bones, my sweet girl.

746
00:53:35,210 --> 00:53:36,210
Here, eat up.

747
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:38,720
My gosh.

748
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:55,170
Yeong Ra.

749
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:58,270
I said I'd call you when I got here. Why are you waiting out in the cold?

750
00:53:58,770 --> 00:53:59,770
Hurry and get in.

751
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:01,910
I'm not getting in.

752
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:06,280
What do you mean you're not getting in?

753
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:10,310
Resign.

754
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:14,180
And give me the car keys.

755
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:17,050
Where is this coming from?

756
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:20,560
Did Director Ko say I should resign?

757
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:22,530
Just give me the keys first.

758
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:26,000
- Yeong Ra. - Give me the keys.

759
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:27,530
It's my car.

760
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:33,600
Yes, it's your car,

761
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:35,910
and I'll give you the keys since you're asking,

762
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,380
but don't you think you owe me an explanation first?

763
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:41,280
Is this about that day?

764
00:54:42,110 --> 00:54:43,710
Because I made a mistake?

765
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,120
So it was a mistake?

766
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,120
Of course, it was.

767
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:53,960
Because I'm your bodyguard.

768
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:01,900
Right. That's a relief.

769
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,400
Then you can go ahead and resign for making that mistake.

770
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,110
Something's happened to you, right?

771
00:55:09,470 --> 00:55:10,470
What is it?

772
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,080
If my car isn't parked in front of our house,

773
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:14,980
you'll be in danger.

774
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:17,350
You could even be killed.

775
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:21,590
That motorcycle accident.

776
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:24,150
It was a warning from my mother.

777
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:27,620
What did you say?

778
00:55:27,890 --> 00:55:30,630
So just write your resignation and submit it to my dad.

779
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,160
If you want to live.

780
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:36,270
So that motorcycle...

781
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:40,070
Your mother was behind that?

782
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:45,540
Goodbye, Ji Wan.

783
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:49,610
Yeong Ra.

784
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:52,280
Then...

785
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:54,720
What about you?

786
00:55:57,620 --> 00:55:59,090
I'll clean up my own mess.

787
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:00,960
Don't worry about me.

788
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:04,960
If you ever...

789
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:08,030
need me,

790
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,240
call me.

791
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:16,140
Let's not...

792
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,040
see each other again.

793
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:35,430
Hello.

794
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:38,760
Mother.

795
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:41,430
I'm right on time, aren't I?

796
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:45,400
Mother, what are you doing here? You didn't even call.

797
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:48,770
Does a kidnapper call ahead before they snatch you?

798
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:50,940
Kidnapper?

799
00:56:52,110 --> 00:56:53,510
I guess this is what's in fashion these days.

800
00:56:58,150 --> 00:57:00,950
(Price: 2,539 dollars)

801
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:05,490
The fabric...

802
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:09,130
What's with you?

803
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:11,430
Mother, I don't want to get anything from here.

804
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:14,360
I've been saving up my emergency fund.

805
00:57:14,670 --> 00:57:16,930
I was going to buy you a nice outfit.

806
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:19,440
Su Bin also paid me for appearing in her videos.

807
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:21,200
Let's go to the outlets, Mother.

808
00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:22,810
Just be quiet...

809
00:57:23,410 --> 00:57:24,540
and answer your phone.

810
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:27,240
How can I answer the phone if I have to be quiet?

811
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:29,750
(Daughter)

812
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:31,210
It's Su Bin.

813
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:33,850
Remember, don't tell her we're at the mall.

814
00:57:37,950 --> 00:57:40,790
- Su Bin. - Mom, why aren't you home yet?

815
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:43,160
Something urgent came up.

816
00:57:43,690 --> 00:57:47,130
There's braised fish in the fridge, and Grandma made radish soup too.

817
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,400
- Just heat that up and eat. - Okay.

818
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:50,470
Okay.

819
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:55,410
Mother, why is it a secret that we're here?

820
00:57:55,670 --> 00:57:58,780
Su Bin promised to pay me again next month.

821
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:04,110
- I'll surprise everyone one by one. - Mother.

822
00:58:04,410 --> 00:58:06,080
You're already planning to spend it all?

823
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,380
Let's go!

824
00:58:09,590 --> 00:58:11,420
- This one. - Okay.

825
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,220
- This one. - Okay.

826
00:58:16,930 --> 00:58:18,300
- This too. - Sure.

827
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:26,800
It's a nice cut, but that's not your colour.

828
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:28,210
Try on the next one.

829
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:34,540
So elegant. You look like a lily. Perfect.

830
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:41,350
Oh, my goodness. Stunning!

831
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,090
Give me a twirl.

832
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:44,890
Turn.

833
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:48,460
Oh, my goodness. Stunning. It's perfect!

834
00:58:57,130 --> 00:58:58,300
If only money weren't an issue.

835
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:02,870
That second one was practically made for you, too.

836
00:59:03,610 --> 00:59:06,910
Even this one is too expensive. I want to return it.

837
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:10,910
"Return" isn't in my vocabulary. Not today, anyway.

838
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:13,720
You can't use your life savings on an outfit for me.

839
00:59:14,790 --> 00:59:16,650
And how would you know what my life savings are?

840
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,660
Let's go get something to eat. Come on.

841
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:29,500
You look like you're about to cry.

842
00:59:30,070 --> 00:59:31,770
For the price of this one outfit,

843
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:34,470
I could buy a whole year's worth of clothes at the outlet.

844
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:38,110
And we could have gotten something for your son, too.

845
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:39,480
He's a man,

846
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:41,210
and you're a lady.

847
00:59:41,810 --> 00:59:44,280
And a working woman, at that.

848
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:46,780
Seeing you all dressed up...

849
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:50,550
Honestly, you looked stunning.

850
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:54,360
Mother, seriously...

851
00:59:55,230 --> 00:59:56,260
It's been...

852
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:01,060
well over 30 years since you became my daughter-in-law.

853
01:00:02,130 --> 01:00:03,370
And in all that time,

854
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:08,140
I can count on one hand the times I gave you cash for your birthday.

855
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:10,470
But you never...

856
01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:13,410
missed my birthday. Not even once.

857
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:15,950
You always got me shoes, clothes, or whatever I needed.

858
01:00:17,050 --> 01:00:19,120
You always made sure I was taken care of.

859
01:00:22,850 --> 01:00:24,750
I could never afford to get you anything nice.

860
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:27,390
Don't be silly.

861
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:30,930
They were all wonderful.

862
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:33,760
They were all beautiful. I mean it.

863
01:00:51,950 --> 01:00:53,080
- Mother. - Yes?

864
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:54,150
The subway is this way.

865
01:00:54,850 --> 01:00:57,850
- We'll take a cab today. Let's go. - Wait, Mother!

866
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,060
Come on, hurry up.

867
01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:01,190
Mother!

868
01:01:02,330 --> 01:01:05,160
The subway is just one transfer. It'll be quick.

869
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:07,300
Listen, dear.

870
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:09,970
It feels pretty good to spend money, you know?

871
01:01:10,870 --> 01:01:13,340
Let's treat ourselves, just for today.

872
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:16,940
We got our first designer outfit from a department store,

873
01:01:17,210 --> 01:01:19,080
so we can't possibly take the subway now, can we?

874
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,110
You have a point there, Mother.

875
01:01:22,710 --> 01:01:26,180
And my feet ache from walking, so it's nice to be comfortable.

876
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:29,320
Exactly.

877
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,820
I don't need anything more.

878
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:35,190
I just wish every day could be like today.

879
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:45,970
- No. - No!

880
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:55,750
(Taxi)

881
01:02:09,430 --> 01:02:10,730
The pasta's cooked perfectly.

882
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,060
Good timing. I'm making pasta.

883
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:15,500
- Do you want some? - No, I'm good.

884
