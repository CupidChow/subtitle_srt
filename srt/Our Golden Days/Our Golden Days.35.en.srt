00:00:04,516 --> 00:00:05,586
(Episode 35)

2
00:00:05,646 --> 00:00:06,686
Woo Jin.

3
00:00:12,056 --> 00:00:13,056
Woo Jin.

4
00:00:16,756 --> 00:00:19,026
Woo Jin. Don't do this.

5
00:00:19,826 --> 00:00:24,566
Woo Jin, don't do this. Woo Jin, don't! Seriously...

6
00:00:25,036 --> 00:00:29,436
Woo Jin. Wake up. Woo Jin.

7
00:00:45,456 --> 00:00:46,456
What?

8
00:00:47,526 --> 00:00:48,956
How did you get here?

9
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:53,996
I came to save you.

10
00:00:57,936 --> 00:00:59,706
You're unbelievable.

11
00:01:00,906 --> 00:01:02,336
But still...

12
00:01:03,306 --> 00:01:05,676
How could you throw your life away over someone like that?

13
00:01:10,546 --> 00:01:12,846
I didn't have the will to live.

14
00:01:20,456 --> 00:01:22,156
If you don't want to feel sorry for me,

15
00:01:25,596 --> 00:01:26,596
then live.

16
00:01:33,136 --> 00:01:34,506
Let's go now, Woo Jin.

17
00:01:35,436 --> 00:01:38,546
Please. Just leave me alone.

18
00:01:44,446 --> 00:01:45,716
Now, I know...

19
00:01:47,086 --> 00:01:48,316
who you are.

20
00:01:51,816 --> 00:01:53,256
So what's the point of dying now?

21
00:01:53,986 --> 00:01:55,556
Who are you trying to please by dying?

22
00:01:58,966 --> 00:02:00,496
If you die because of her,

23
00:02:01,526 --> 00:02:02,666
you're a fool.

24
00:02:05,066 --> 00:02:06,166
To me,

25
00:02:06,966 --> 00:02:09,006
you're my friend, not her son.

26
00:02:12,376 --> 00:02:13,606
And if you die like this,

27
00:02:15,206 --> 00:02:17,516
it'll feel like I'm the one who killed you.

28
00:02:26,356 --> 00:02:27,526
So let's go,

29
00:02:28,856 --> 00:02:29,856
my brother.

30
00:02:46,546 --> 00:02:50,576
- Ma'am, Han Woo Jin is on his way. - You heard from him?

31
00:02:51,016 --> 00:02:52,016
Who called?

32
00:02:53,446 --> 00:02:54,446
A woman?

33
00:02:57,456 --> 00:02:59,226
Understood. I'm on my way to the hospital.

34
00:03:08,836 --> 00:03:12,236
You two really are fated. I knew it. It's good you're back.

35
00:03:14,706 --> 00:03:17,976
Woo Jin. First, let's get you changed.

36
00:03:18,336 --> 00:03:19,346
Okay?

37
00:03:22,946 --> 00:03:23,946
What about you?

38
00:03:25,146 --> 00:03:26,686
I'll be admitted the day after tomorrow.

39
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:30,656
Thank you, Eun Oh.

40
00:03:31,856 --> 00:03:33,486
I'm not doing this because he's my brother.

41
00:03:34,226 --> 00:03:35,656
I'm doing it because he's my friend.

42
00:03:36,756 --> 00:03:38,126
I don't care what the reason is.

43
00:03:39,196 --> 00:03:40,796
Woo Jin's exhausted right now.

44
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,266
Don't pressure him or stress him out.

45
00:03:44,036 --> 00:03:46,066
Do you think I have any energy left for that?

46
00:03:47,366 --> 00:03:50,006
Woo Jin. You'll be okay without me, right?

47
00:03:50,936 --> 00:03:52,976
Eun Oh said she'd save me,

48
00:03:53,706 --> 00:03:55,246
so you can go now without worrying.

49
00:03:56,246 --> 00:03:57,316
And...

50
00:04:00,516 --> 00:04:02,316
I'd rather you didn't come back.

51
00:04:04,086 --> 00:04:05,456
The doctor will be here soon.

52
00:04:07,086 --> 00:04:09,526
- I'm leaving. - I'm posting a guard outside.

53
00:04:18,736 --> 00:04:19,866
It's your sister.

54
00:04:21,006 --> 00:04:22,206
Eun Oh.

55
00:04:23,406 --> 00:04:24,406
Mom.

56
00:04:25,336 --> 00:04:27,246
I can't come home tonight.

57
00:04:28,876 --> 00:04:30,676
Woo Jin's in the hospital,

58
00:04:31,246 --> 00:04:34,546
- so I'm going to stay with him. - What?

59
00:04:34,886 --> 00:04:36,316
Wait, what's wrong with Woo Jin?

60
00:04:36,756 --> 00:04:39,986
He said he was going to Busan. Are you in Busan too?

61
00:04:43,226 --> 00:04:44,226
Mom.

62
00:04:46,766 --> 00:04:48,596
Woo Jin and I...

63
00:04:49,866 --> 00:04:50,966
Apparently, we're twins.

64
00:04:52,836 --> 00:04:54,436
Woo Jin is my older brother.

65
00:04:58,676 --> 00:04:59,876
What? What's wrong?

66
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:04,016
What? But...

67
00:05:05,486 --> 00:05:07,216
Eun Oh, what did you just say?

68
00:05:08,286 --> 00:05:10,756
Woo Jin... I mean, your friend, Woo Jin...

69
00:05:11,786 --> 00:05:13,656
He's your twin brother?

70
00:05:15,056 --> 00:05:16,426
What is she talking about?

71
00:05:19,096 --> 00:05:20,096
Mom.

72
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:22,836
For Woo Jin...

73
00:05:24,236 --> 00:05:26,006
Can I be his liver donor?

74
00:05:30,176 --> 00:05:31,376
You know, right?

75
00:05:32,576 --> 00:05:35,046
When I was struggling after Dad passed away,

76
00:05:37,116 --> 00:05:39,416
he's the only reason I got through it.

77
00:05:41,616 --> 00:05:42,716
I know.

78
00:05:44,686 --> 00:05:46,856
Woo Jin was at the funeral home for three straight days,

79
00:05:48,126 --> 00:05:51,156
and he carried your bag for you twice a day for over a month.

80
00:05:51,956 --> 00:05:53,796
Ever since freshman year, he and Yeong In...

81
00:05:54,326 --> 00:05:57,466
were always over. Of course, I know.

82
00:05:59,636 --> 00:06:00,636
Mom.

83
00:06:02,876 --> 00:06:04,036
Please, can I?

84
00:06:19,856 --> 00:06:20,856
Hey.

85
00:06:21,286 --> 00:06:23,956
Since when do you do after-parties at a colleague's wedding?

86
00:06:25,726 --> 00:06:27,026
Honey.

87
00:06:32,836 --> 00:06:37,176
What's with you? You're so strict about no outside clothes on the bed.

88
00:06:38,536 --> 00:06:40,576
Oh, this feels nice.

89
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:45,686
They insisted I stay for the party since it's been so long,

90
00:06:46,186 --> 00:06:48,856
but it was so exhausting listening to everyone.

91
00:06:50,256 --> 00:06:52,116
Well, you get those types everywhere.

92
00:06:52,986 --> 00:06:57,196
- Come here. You've had a long day. - Gosh, I love being home the most.

93
00:06:58,696 --> 00:06:59,766
Not me?

94
00:07:02,236 --> 00:07:05,096
You are my home.

95
00:07:09,606 --> 00:07:10,606
Did you find him?

96
00:07:11,606 --> 00:07:12,676
I found him.

97
00:07:13,246 --> 00:07:15,746
I'll bring your car back tomorrow morning.

98
00:07:17,746 --> 00:07:19,616
Yes, okay.

99
00:07:25,016 --> 00:07:26,126
So that was the right place.

100
00:07:28,526 --> 00:07:30,156
They say twins have a special connection.

101
00:07:31,756 --> 00:07:33,796
So that's why they became best friends.

102
00:07:43,276 --> 00:07:45,336
I'm glad they found each other.

103
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,516
I guess Eun Oh will do the liver transplant.

104
00:07:52,046 --> 00:07:53,446
Knowing Eun Oh, she'll definitely do it for him.

105
00:07:54,816 --> 00:07:56,416
But why do I have such a bad feeling about this?

106
00:08:00,086 --> 00:08:03,196
So, is the surgery happening on the original date?

107
00:08:04,626 --> 00:08:06,826
- I guess so. - Man...

108
00:08:07,966 --> 00:08:10,136
Ji Hyuk, let's go visit her together after the surgery.

109
00:08:10,196 --> 00:08:13,606
Are you kidding me? I'm torn up, and you're already planning a visit?

110
00:08:14,636 --> 00:08:17,536
It's not like you can stop her. You just have to accept it.

111
00:08:19,376 --> 00:08:22,246
Yes, right. It must be nice you're over Eun Oh.

112
00:08:22,976 --> 00:08:24,076
You get to be all logical about it.

113
00:08:24,816 --> 00:08:25,846
Forget it, man. I'm hanging up.

114
00:08:29,016 --> 00:08:30,016
Man...

115
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:33,056
Ji Hyuk must be having such a hard time right now.

116
00:08:36,226 --> 00:08:37,226
What?

117
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:39,726
Hey, Su Bin.

118
00:08:40,266 --> 00:08:43,096
Hey, you're free on Wednesday night, right?

119
00:08:43,236 --> 00:08:44,336
Let me know right away.

120
00:08:44,766 --> 00:08:48,736
Seats just opened for that musical. I have to book them right away.

121
00:08:49,036 --> 00:08:50,676
Wednesday?

122
00:08:51,706 --> 00:08:53,206
I have plans on Wednesday.

123
00:08:53,206 --> 00:08:54,746
I have to visit a friend in the hospital.

124
00:08:55,176 --> 00:08:56,176
Let's go another day.

125
00:08:57,016 --> 00:08:58,616
You have a friend who's sick?

126
00:08:59,686 --> 00:09:00,946
What's wrong with them?

127
00:09:02,316 --> 00:09:05,386
- Can't you visit them the next day? - No, I can't.

128
00:09:05,686 --> 00:09:06,986
That's the day of the surgery.

129
00:09:07,826 --> 00:09:08,826
Really?

130
00:09:09,496 --> 00:09:10,626
Well, should I come with you?

131
00:09:11,526 --> 00:09:12,526
No.

132
00:09:15,296 --> 00:09:17,566
It's not someone you'd know.

133
00:09:18,866 --> 00:09:21,036
What do you mean, not someone I'd know?

134
00:09:22,536 --> 00:09:23,536
Is it a girl?

135
00:09:24,436 --> 00:09:25,576
Well, yes, but...

136
00:09:26,206 --> 00:09:27,446
She's just a friend.

137
00:09:28,746 --> 00:09:29,746
Just a friend who's a girl?

138
00:09:30,676 --> 00:09:34,716
There's already someone I like. I've liked her for a long time.

139
00:09:34,716 --> 00:09:36,416
I've clearly said no,

140
00:09:36,716 --> 00:09:38,386
and I told you there's someone else.

141
00:09:40,186 --> 00:09:43,096
So that "friend" in the hospital...

142
00:09:43,156 --> 00:09:44,796
Is she the girl you had a crush on for years?

143
00:09:46,266 --> 00:09:48,866
Did I really say all that?

144
00:09:49,266 --> 00:09:53,036
Yes, you did. When you rejected me and put up a wall.

145
00:09:56,476 --> 00:09:58,776
I thought you had just made it up to push me away,

146
00:09:59,176 --> 00:10:00,276
but it was real, wasn't it?

147
00:10:00,576 --> 00:10:03,346
Su Bin, hold on a second. Let me explain.

148
00:10:03,746 --> 00:10:07,116
She's having surgery? You're that worried about her?

149
00:10:08,046 --> 00:10:09,056
Fine.

150
00:10:10,056 --> 00:10:11,786
Su Bin. Wait, I...

151
00:10:13,186 --> 00:10:14,186
Hello?

152
00:10:18,226 --> 00:10:20,026
I don't have feelings for her anymore.

153
00:10:23,866 --> 00:10:27,236
The phone is turned off. You'll be connected to voicemail...

154
00:10:27,306 --> 00:10:28,366
Please leave your message...

155
00:10:28,936 --> 00:10:32,476
Su Bin, why are you so angry? You didn't even hear me out.

156
00:10:33,106 --> 00:10:34,746
Call me. I'll explain everything.

157
00:10:45,456 --> 00:10:46,456
Son.

158
00:10:47,586 --> 00:10:50,496
What kind of part-time jobs have you been doing lately?

159
00:10:51,096 --> 00:10:54,926
Just odd jobs here and there. I don't have a steady one.

160
00:10:55,396 --> 00:10:58,866
I've just been going on interviews, so I can't commit to a steady job.

161
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:04,376
It must be all physical labor, starting at dawn.

162
00:11:04,976 --> 00:11:06,946
That's why he's covered in all those pain patches.

163
00:11:08,346 --> 00:11:09,746
Go on inside and get some rest, Mother.

164
00:11:20,026 --> 00:11:22,456
Grandma. What are you doing out here?

165
00:11:22,856 --> 00:11:25,226
Oh? Listen, Su Bin.

166
00:11:25,596 --> 00:11:28,766
Tomorrow, go and see your mom at the store.

167
00:11:29,296 --> 00:11:31,066
That bed thing I was lying on at the store...

168
00:11:31,466 --> 00:11:34,206
Could you discreetly ask her how much it costs?

169
00:11:35,266 --> 00:11:39,246
- Why? - Because it felt so amazing.

170
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:45,346
Your dad's been covered in pain patches lately.

171
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,146
I'm going to save up.

172
00:11:48,646 --> 00:11:50,256
For your dad's birthday next year,

173
00:11:51,016 --> 00:11:52,316
I'm thinking of buying him one.

174
00:11:53,486 --> 00:11:55,726
Grandma. Does it make you sad?

175
00:11:58,696 --> 00:12:01,426
It just breaks my heart. He's my son.

176
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:07,266
Grandma, do you want to have a beer with me?

177
00:12:07,766 --> 00:12:11,636
- I'm on my way to get some now. - Oh, no. I couldn't possibly.

178
00:12:12,076 --> 00:12:14,946
I'm a model about to walk the runway.

179
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,716
I can't have a puffy face. It would be a disaster.

180
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:20,786
I'm even planning on fasting starting tomorrow night.

181
00:12:30,296 --> 00:12:31,296
Lee Su Bin.

182
00:12:34,366 --> 00:12:36,236
What are you doing wandering around so late?

183
00:12:37,566 --> 00:12:38,796
With your phone off, no less.

184
00:12:40,206 --> 00:12:41,666
Is it really something to get so angry about?

185
00:12:45,136 --> 00:12:47,576
Angry enough to come out for four beers this late at night?

186
00:12:47,706 --> 00:12:51,516
Forget 4 beers. I could drink 4 bottles of soju now.

187
00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:58,956
Seong Jae.

188
00:12:59,256 --> 00:13:01,356
You only asked me out to get over her, didn't you?

189
00:13:02,526 --> 00:13:04,826
What? That's ridiculous.

190
00:13:05,296 --> 00:13:08,426
She's a friend having major surgery. That's why I'm visiting her.

191
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,296
Why are you jumping to conclusions like that?

192
00:13:10,866 --> 00:13:12,266
This isn't going to work if you're like this.

193
00:13:13,206 --> 00:13:16,406
- "Isn't going to work?" - I have a social life, you know.

194
00:13:16,806 --> 00:13:19,876
Why get mad and make assumptions without even hearing me out?

195
00:13:20,176 --> 00:13:24,176
It's not just your "social life." You had a crush on her for years.

196
00:13:24,516 --> 00:13:26,946
- Not anymore. - Yes, right.

197
00:13:27,216 --> 00:13:29,486
You're going because you still like her, aren't you?

198
00:13:29,756 --> 00:13:31,156
And you don't want me to come with you.

199
00:13:31,486 --> 00:13:32,486
What?

200
00:13:36,796 --> 00:13:37,896
Su Bin.

201
00:13:43,566 --> 00:13:45,666
I was told that Mt. Cheongah, where the cabin is,

202
00:13:46,636 --> 00:13:48,566
is where Dad's ashes were scattered.

203
00:13:50,736 --> 00:13:51,776
I see.

204
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:53,976
So that's why...

205
00:13:54,746 --> 00:13:57,076
you said you went there every year on your birthday.

206
00:14:02,116 --> 00:14:03,986
Looking back on it now, Eun Oh...

207
00:14:05,256 --> 00:14:06,256
For my entire life,

208
00:14:07,356 --> 00:14:09,996
I've never been able to forget the moment we parted ways...

209
00:14:12,156 --> 00:14:13,166
because I felt so guilty.

210
00:14:18,896 --> 00:14:21,036
But it was a blessing in disguise for you.

211
00:14:24,306 --> 00:14:25,776
I know...

212
00:14:26,206 --> 00:14:28,346
how loved you were growing up...

213
00:14:30,276 --> 00:14:34,086
and how warm and wonderful your parents were.

214
00:14:39,556 --> 00:14:40,556
You're right.

215
00:14:43,156 --> 00:14:44,556
But when you put it that way,

216
00:14:46,226 --> 00:14:47,896
it makes you sound so pitiful.

217
00:14:57,636 --> 00:14:59,176
Eun Oh's so thin.

218
00:15:00,906 --> 00:15:03,276
Gosh, and she's so frail.

219
00:15:24,766 --> 00:15:25,766
Eun Oh.

220
00:15:26,766 --> 00:15:28,606
Thank you. It was a huge help.

221
00:15:29,206 --> 00:15:30,206
Sure.

222
00:15:32,506 --> 00:15:35,846
This is my leave request.

223
00:15:37,116 --> 00:15:39,246
Only for two weeks this time.

224
00:15:40,246 --> 00:15:41,246
Shorter this time, right?

225
00:15:43,586 --> 00:15:46,056
I don't think I can approve this.

226
00:15:48,356 --> 00:15:50,396
Come on. You know what this is for.

227
00:15:50,656 --> 00:15:53,826
You look so thin and frail. You have no energy.

228
00:15:54,526 --> 00:15:56,196
You always push yourself so hard...

229
00:15:56,196 --> 00:15:58,036
and constantly pull all-nighters. Also,

230
00:15:58,396 --> 00:16:02,336
how can your liver be healthy when you live on triangle gimbap?

231
00:16:02,776 --> 00:16:05,036
The tests already proved I'm a suitable match.

232
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:08,276
- That I'm perfectly healthy. - I know, but still...

233
00:16:08,376 --> 00:16:09,376
Mr. Lee.

234
00:16:09,876 --> 00:16:13,786
I'll outline the new project while I'm in the hospital.

235
00:16:14,986 --> 00:16:17,656
I'll have nothing to do but think until I'm discharged anyway.

236
00:16:22,756 --> 00:16:24,096
(Leave Request)

237
00:16:26,056 --> 00:16:27,066
Eun Oh.

238
00:16:29,896 --> 00:16:31,296
I'll take the compatibility test.

239
00:16:33,466 --> 00:16:35,636
I'm way healthier than you are.

240
00:16:36,706 --> 00:16:38,436
Why didn't I think of that?

241
00:16:40,446 --> 00:16:44,416
I'm glad we're back to being just colleagues.

242
00:16:45,846 --> 00:16:48,416
I never thought I'd feel this comforted by you.

243
00:16:51,286 --> 00:16:54,456
I'll start my leave tomorrow.

244
00:17:12,636 --> 00:17:15,406
My friend isn't in very good health right now.

245
00:17:15,846 --> 00:17:18,616
I'd like to see if I'm a match for the liver donation.

246
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:23,556
You can't get tested without proof of family or close ties.

247
00:17:23,956 --> 00:17:26,826
We can't do elective testing unless it's for a deceased donation.

248
00:17:27,356 --> 00:17:28,356
I know that.

249
00:17:28,886 --> 00:17:32,526
I'm close with the donor, Ji Eun Oh. We're colleagues.

250
00:17:32,996 --> 00:17:35,866
I'm close with the patient's sister, so can't I get the test?

251
00:17:36,126 --> 00:17:38,336
That kind of indirect relationship doesn't qualify.

252
00:17:38,436 --> 00:17:40,736
But I want to help someone sick. Why can't I?

253
00:17:41,036 --> 00:17:42,666
You need proof that you've lived together...

254
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:44,306
as close acquaintances for a long time,

255
00:17:44,376 --> 00:17:46,676
and your case still needs approval by the Transplant Ethics Committee.

256
00:17:50,046 --> 00:17:51,046
I see.

257
00:17:52,986 --> 00:17:54,586
(Vice President Park Seong Jae)

258
00:17:54,646 --> 00:17:57,286
The person you have called is unavailable.

259
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,356
She's still not picking up?

260
00:18:04,796 --> 00:18:07,896
Su Bin. I'm getting off on the dot, so let's meet up and talk.

261
00:18:07,966 --> 00:18:10,796
(Su Bin. I'm getting off on the dot, so let's meet up and talk.)

262
00:18:14,006 --> 00:18:15,966
I have to film my grandma's walking practice tonight.

263
00:18:16,036 --> 00:18:18,806
(I have to film my grandma's walking practice tonight.)

264
00:18:20,976 --> 00:18:22,446
Let's meet for a bit at lunch.

265
00:18:22,506 --> 00:18:25,276
(Let's meet for a bit at lunch.)

266
00:18:28,016 --> 00:18:29,016
I'm busy.

267
00:18:29,086 --> 00:18:31,386
(I'm busy.)

268
00:18:33,356 --> 00:18:34,786
Darn it, Su Bin.

269
00:18:36,856 --> 00:18:38,896
- Seong Jae! - Ji Hyuk!

270
00:18:40,526 --> 00:18:41,796
Gosh, you scared me.

271
00:18:42,126 --> 00:18:45,396
Why can't I be of any help to Eun Oh?

272
00:18:47,036 --> 00:18:49,006
What's got you so worked up?

273
00:18:52,476 --> 00:18:56,746
Wait, you went to the hospital knowing not just anyone can take it?

274
00:18:57,216 --> 00:18:59,846
Well, since I'm a close colleague of hers,

275
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:03,416
I figured they'd cut me some slack if I said I knew her brother too.

276
00:19:04,016 --> 00:19:07,086
Okay, and? Let's just say it was possible.

277
00:19:08,056 --> 00:19:10,196
Were you really going to donate your liver?

278
00:19:10,526 --> 00:19:11,856
Of course, I was.

279
00:19:12,326 --> 00:19:13,396
Hey, are you serious?

280
00:19:13,996 --> 00:19:15,966
What would your parents do if they found out?

281
00:19:17,066 --> 00:19:21,366
That's a problem I'll think about after I'm confirmed as a match.

282
00:19:22,306 --> 00:19:24,876
Man, you'd really do it, wouldn't you?

283
00:19:25,376 --> 00:19:27,046
It's not about me donating.

284
00:19:27,676 --> 00:19:30,346
It's just the thought of Eun Oh on that operating table...

285
00:19:30,616 --> 00:19:32,776
It drives me crazy with worry.

286
00:19:34,946 --> 00:19:36,146
Hey, Ji Hyuk.

287
00:19:37,656 --> 00:19:40,456
But how could she not know her son and Ji Eun Oh were friends?

288
00:19:42,256 --> 00:19:45,626
Man, she pays zero attention to her son.

289
00:19:46,966 --> 00:19:47,966
I know, right?

290
00:19:48,426 --> 00:19:52,236
I mean, your mom still remembers all your college friends, right?

291
00:19:52,796 --> 00:19:54,866
Yes. Most moms know all that stuff.

292
00:19:55,306 --> 00:19:57,906
But this woman... She's been seeing Eun Oh for months,

293
00:19:57,976 --> 00:19:59,746
and she still had no idea she was her son's friend.

294
00:20:00,606 --> 00:20:01,606
Hey.

295
00:20:02,406 --> 00:20:05,676
So in the end, she got exactly what she wanted, didn't she?

296
00:20:06,646 --> 00:20:11,486
She tricked Eun Oh. On top of that, she kept showing up and begging,

297
00:20:11,686 --> 00:20:13,356
and eventually got her to agree to the liver transplant.

298
00:20:14,026 --> 00:20:16,286
You think she's creepy even though you've never met her, right?

299
00:20:16,286 --> 00:20:17,896
I've met her twice.

300
00:20:18,156 --> 00:20:21,126
That woman has no shame.

301
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:25,936
The twin brother gets a pass. He's innocent in all this.

302
00:20:27,206 --> 00:20:28,206
But you...

303
00:20:29,066 --> 00:20:30,636
Are you just going to let her get away with it?

304
00:20:32,136 --> 00:20:34,406
I've thought about it, but there's nothing I can do.

305
00:20:34,706 --> 00:20:36,176
It's not like I can take her to court.

306
00:20:36,776 --> 00:20:39,516
Gosh, I want to punch her so badly,

307
00:20:40,016 --> 00:20:41,246
but she's Eun Oh's birth mother.

308
00:20:41,246 --> 00:20:42,516
Why do you say there's nothing you can do?

309
00:20:43,086 --> 00:20:44,286
You said she remarried, right?

310
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:45,856
What about her husband?

311
00:20:46,116 --> 00:20:48,426
Tell him his wife left her daughter...

312
00:20:48,426 --> 00:20:51,096
and came back just for her liver. You don't think that'll work?

313
00:20:51,556 --> 00:20:54,826
Hey, he probably knows already. Birds of a feather flock together.

314
00:20:57,096 --> 00:20:59,096
Yes, you're probably right about that.

315
00:21:00,366 --> 00:21:03,176
And you said that family was pretty well-off, right?

316
00:21:03,906 --> 00:21:05,536
Ji Hyuk, you should look into their background.

317
00:21:06,236 --> 00:21:10,446
We should tell everyone they know the truth about that trashy couple.

318
00:21:25,196 --> 00:21:26,426
Are you getting sleepy?

319
00:21:36,266 --> 00:21:37,936
No, it's not that.

320
00:21:38,106 --> 00:21:41,346
I'm just sore from not moving for so long.

321
00:21:41,546 --> 00:21:42,676
Then go and work out.

322
00:21:42,746 --> 00:21:45,746
No way. How could I leave you alone? I'm your bodyguard, after all.

323
00:21:46,446 --> 00:21:48,716
I'll just go stretch out front for a bit.

324
00:21:50,256 --> 00:21:54,156
Hey, when we were getting my table on Yeolmu,

325
00:21:54,386 --> 00:21:56,796
we saw that ten-dollar desk. I wonder if it sold.

326
00:21:57,326 --> 00:21:58,526
A desk? Why?

327
00:21:59,726 --> 00:22:01,726
You should have a desk, too.

328
00:22:02,366 --> 00:22:04,196
Sitting on the sofa for that long is bad for your back.

329
00:22:04,336 --> 00:22:08,136
No, it's fine. I can just go stretch and jump some rope out front.

330
00:22:08,766 --> 00:22:13,446
No, really. I need an assistant, especially when I'm stuck.

331
00:22:14,146 --> 00:22:15,206
An assistant?

332
00:22:16,006 --> 00:22:18,376
I mean, you and I are already creating the story together.

333
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:24,286
Good work.

334
00:22:57,686 --> 00:22:58,856
I'm home.

335
00:23:01,326 --> 00:23:02,326
Where's Dad?

336
00:23:03,126 --> 00:23:05,526
He's on his way. He should be here any minute.

337
00:23:06,196 --> 00:23:07,196
Sit.

338
00:23:08,796 --> 00:23:09,796
Okay.

339
00:23:19,436 --> 00:23:20,446
Sit down.

340
00:23:21,146 --> 00:23:22,746
What is all this?

341
00:23:23,616 --> 00:23:24,876
When I said I'd clear your studio,

342
00:23:24,876 --> 00:23:26,586
you boldly told me to get rid of the studio,

343
00:23:26,646 --> 00:23:28,486
and now you get a room together?

344
00:23:30,086 --> 00:23:32,886
I heard you two would go in there and stay for hours.

345
00:23:33,556 --> 00:23:36,626
You hired someone to secretly take pictures of us?

346
00:23:36,626 --> 00:23:37,626
Answer my question first.

347
00:23:38,996 --> 00:23:41,496
You think I can let this slide and not fire Lee Ji Wan?

348
00:23:42,496 --> 00:23:44,866
You think I can keep this from your father?

349
00:23:46,936 --> 00:23:48,036
Well...

350
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:50,636
What do I do?

351
00:23:51,536 --> 00:23:52,776
Dad's on his way?

352
00:23:54,806 --> 00:23:56,506
Stall for time. Pretend to think.

353
00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:05,786
Make a choice before Dad gets home.

354
00:24:06,286 --> 00:24:07,956
I'm giving you a chance to make these photos go away.

355
00:24:10,196 --> 00:24:13,266
In exchange, Lee Ji Wan must submit his own resignation.

356
00:24:23,506 --> 00:24:25,406
- You're home. - Yes.

357
00:24:25,676 --> 00:24:27,306
- And perfect timing, Yeong Ra is... - Yes?

358
00:24:32,446 --> 00:24:35,086
- Hi, Dad. You're home. - Hey. You're home early too.

359
00:24:35,386 --> 00:24:37,886
- I left something here. - What's that?

360
00:24:38,356 --> 00:24:39,486
- Dad. - Yes?

361
00:24:39,486 --> 00:24:41,326
I have something for you.

362
00:24:45,196 --> 00:24:46,296
Please open it.

363
00:24:48,626 --> 00:24:49,666
Mom, please have a seat.

364
00:25:00,306 --> 00:25:01,546
You can open yours too, Mom.

365
00:25:06,746 --> 00:25:08,316
Yeong Ra, what is this?

366
00:25:08,886 --> 00:25:12,756
- Park Yeong Ra's Art Studio? - Dad. Mom.

367
00:25:13,456 --> 00:25:15,926
I got a studio with my own money.

368
00:25:17,926 --> 00:25:20,526
- A studio? - What do you mean, a studio?

369
00:25:22,766 --> 00:25:25,796
The art studio I had was for when I dreamed of becoming an artist.

370
00:25:25,866 --> 00:25:28,166
It was you who spared no expense decorating it for me, Mom.

371
00:25:29,506 --> 00:25:31,476
But even though I'm not going to be an artist anymore,

372
00:25:31,736 --> 00:25:34,776
I felt like I'd just get lazy if I stayed at home all day.

373
00:25:36,976 --> 00:25:41,886
Dad, the deposit is 3,000 dollars, and the rent is only 350 a month.

374
00:25:45,116 --> 00:25:47,356
Mr. Lee even helped me paint it.

375
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:51,356
But please don't give him a hard time.

376
00:25:51,656 --> 00:25:54,426
Until I had a chance to tell you,

377
00:25:54,496 --> 00:25:57,166
I begged him to keep it an absolute secret.

378
00:25:58,136 --> 00:25:59,566
So what are you going to do there?

379
00:26:00,806 --> 00:26:02,666
Exactly.

380
00:26:04,206 --> 00:26:07,746
Whether I open a gallery or do something else down the line,

381
00:26:08,446 --> 00:26:12,646
I'll go there at a set time daily to study, read books,

382
00:26:12,716 --> 00:26:15,986
and take some lessons. I'll do some painting, too.

383
00:26:17,516 --> 00:26:18,786
In short,

384
00:26:19,316 --> 00:26:21,826
it's my own personal studio for life.

385
00:26:24,426 --> 00:26:27,526
A 3,000-dollar deposit and 350 dollars a month.

386
00:26:29,596 --> 00:26:31,266
You didn't discuss this with your mom?

387
00:26:31,996 --> 00:26:33,296
You didn't know about this either?

388
00:26:34,706 --> 00:26:36,506
I kept it a secret on purpose.

389
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:40,306
It was more exciting that way.

390
00:26:41,706 --> 00:26:43,876
I wanted to accomplish something on my own...

391
00:26:44,276 --> 00:26:46,416
and make Mom proud.

392
00:26:48,286 --> 00:26:51,156
She always pulls these stunts in front of her father.

393
00:26:58,726 --> 00:27:02,726
Why get rid of her good studio just to have her rent a tiny room?

394
00:27:03,536 --> 00:27:05,036
You know very well why.

395
00:27:05,466 --> 00:27:09,206
When I suggested closing the studio, she said it was fine.

396
00:27:10,036 --> 00:27:14,306
You never know what kids think. I don't get why she's like this.

397
00:27:14,376 --> 00:27:15,776
She's changed so much.

398
00:27:16,546 --> 00:27:17,946
She has changed a bit.

399
00:27:18,976 --> 00:27:20,546
So, what should we do?

400
00:27:21,246 --> 00:27:23,656
She's not wrong.

401
00:27:24,016 --> 00:27:26,926
She's happy she did it on her own, so what can we do?

402
00:27:27,586 --> 00:27:30,056
She must be tired of being stuck at home all day.

403
00:27:30,656 --> 00:27:34,996
But that doesn't mean she can do whatever she pleases.

404
00:27:35,466 --> 00:27:38,166
And Mr. Lee helping her paint bothers me.

405
00:27:38,466 --> 00:27:39,766
What's so bothersome about that?

406
00:27:40,606 --> 00:27:44,176
Come on, our Yeong Ra is beautiful, and he's a young man in his prime.

407
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:49,176
She's out of his league, forbidden fruit.

408
00:27:49,246 --> 00:27:51,716
Those sayings exist for a reason.

409
00:27:51,916 --> 00:27:54,946
The guy is sharp enough to know where he stands.

410
00:27:55,586 --> 00:27:59,386
He's Seong Jae's friend's brother. He wouldn't dare try anything.

411
00:28:00,356 --> 00:28:05,156
Still, I have to keep an eye on her. It doesn't help that she's pretty.

412
00:28:14,436 --> 00:28:17,606
You're not the Yeong Ra I thought I knew.

413
00:28:19,276 --> 00:28:21,976
And who was the person you thought you knew, Mom?

414
00:28:23,876 --> 00:28:26,746
Someone who gets why I cherished you and raised you the way I did.

415
00:28:27,946 --> 00:28:31,016
Someone who knows why she has to live the way I tell her to.

416
00:28:32,056 --> 00:28:34,386
Someone who doesn't act so foolishly like you're doing now.

417
00:28:37,056 --> 00:28:40,026
So that's how you saw me.

418
00:28:40,766 --> 00:28:43,066
That's who you really are, Yeong Ra.

419
00:28:43,636 --> 00:28:46,036
I see you that way because that's who you are.

420
00:28:47,336 --> 00:28:49,336
I'm not so sure about that.

421
00:28:50,136 --> 00:28:52,076
I feel like I'm still the same person.

422
00:28:53,706 --> 00:28:56,746
Mom. Would you and Dad like to come see the studio?

423
00:28:58,346 --> 00:28:59,916
So you plan to use my weakness against me...

424
00:28:59,916 --> 00:29:02,346
to run around with Mr. Lee.

425
00:29:03,786 --> 00:29:05,856
Why has she changed so much?

426
00:29:06,686 --> 00:29:08,856
If I let this go on any longer, things will get out of hand.

427
00:29:15,026 --> 00:29:16,026
I'm busy.

428
00:29:18,396 --> 00:29:20,036
My gosh, what's with her?

429
00:29:21,166 --> 00:29:24,706
What am I supposed to do? I can't exactly ask Eun Oh,

430
00:29:24,776 --> 00:29:26,576
and I can't ask Ji Hyuk either.

431
00:29:27,046 --> 00:29:28,076
Seong Jae.

432
00:29:28,606 --> 00:29:31,046
You only asked me out to get over her, didn't you?

433
00:29:31,116 --> 00:29:33,546
You're going because you still like her, aren't you?

434
00:29:33,886 --> 00:29:35,416
And you don't want me to come with you.

435
00:29:37,256 --> 00:29:39,286
How did she jump to that just from me saying I was visiting Eun Oh?

436
00:29:43,556 --> 00:29:45,526
You jumped to your own conclusions and got mad,

437
00:29:45,896 --> 00:29:47,826
so why won't you even apologize, Su Bin?

438
00:29:47,826 --> 00:29:49,226
(Seong Jae)

439
00:29:49,226 --> 00:29:50,466
You want me to apologize?

440
00:29:50,796 --> 00:29:52,366
Are you saying I'm the one in the wrong?

441
00:29:54,736 --> 00:29:57,136
I guess I didn't know you as well as I thought.

442
00:29:57,806 --> 00:30:01,076
Let's take a break. I'll reach out when I'm ready.

443
00:30:01,176 --> 00:30:03,206
Don't contact me until then.

444
00:30:08,546 --> 00:30:10,356
Wow, I guess she's really mad.

445
00:30:11,916 --> 00:30:13,116
She's never...

446
00:30:13,486 --> 00:30:15,356
She's not the type to get this angry.

447
00:30:16,256 --> 00:30:17,996
What did I do that was so wrong?

448
00:30:19,926 --> 00:30:21,226
What should I do?

449
00:30:22,196 --> 00:30:24,236
Should I ask her for a deadline?

450
00:30:25,096 --> 00:30:26,596
Well, no.

451
00:30:28,006 --> 00:30:29,466
Gosh, what do I do?

452
00:30:34,646 --> 00:30:35,646
Mom.

453
00:30:36,606 --> 00:30:38,746
Why are you... Why? Why would you go in there?

454
00:30:38,816 --> 00:30:43,446
She's packing for the hospital all by herself.

455
00:30:45,716 --> 00:30:46,716
Mom.

456
00:30:48,056 --> 00:30:51,796
Now that we've accepted this, let's make her feel less guilty.

457
00:30:52,526 --> 00:30:54,896
How's she supposed to pack for the hospital stay with you?

458
00:30:54,966 --> 00:30:56,026
Eun Oh can't do that.

459
00:30:59,436 --> 00:31:02,866
I can't believe how thoughtful she is.

460
00:31:11,076 --> 00:31:13,946
Grandma's nude-colored underwear, check.

461
00:31:14,016 --> 00:31:18,056
The schedule, wet wipes, and hairpins. All packed.

462
00:31:18,116 --> 00:31:20,456
You did a great job packing. Thank you.

463
00:31:21,326 --> 00:31:25,326
Hey, is everyone gone now? Is our secret safe?

464
00:31:26,196 --> 00:31:28,496
Of course. My lips are sealed.

465
00:31:28,566 --> 00:31:30,696
Besides Mom and me, no one else in the family knows.

466
00:31:31,666 --> 00:31:35,566
- This feels unreal. Let's go. - Let's go.

467
00:31:37,676 --> 00:31:40,476
All right, this is our visit for the "30 Homes" project.

468
00:31:40,546 --> 00:31:43,306
Keep the project concept in mind as we look around.

469
00:31:44,416 --> 00:31:46,246
I've already informed the showroom.

470
00:31:46,716 --> 00:31:49,446
Cheol Min. Come with us.

471
00:31:49,946 --> 00:31:50,956
Me?

472
00:31:51,156 --> 00:31:53,486
(Younglim, Kitchen, Bath, Home and Living)

473
00:31:53,686 --> 00:31:56,786
(Younglim Industries Co., Ltd)

474
00:31:56,986 --> 00:31:58,156
Wait, Eun Oh.

475
00:31:58,956 --> 00:32:02,496
Eun Oh, why are you here? Doesn't your leave start today?

476
00:32:03,396 --> 00:32:06,136
I forgot today was the first day of the Sample House project.

477
00:32:06,436 --> 00:32:08,066
They said I could check in this afternoon instead.

478
00:32:11,306 --> 00:32:13,306
We'll go on ahead and look around.

479
00:32:13,636 --> 00:32:14,706
Okay.

480
00:32:19,476 --> 00:32:22,146
You aren't avoiding the hospital because you're scared, are you?

481
00:32:23,146 --> 00:32:26,656
Even post-surgery, I can still use my brain while I'm in the hospital.

482
00:32:26,886 --> 00:32:29,786
And to do that, I need to see and feel the materials for myself.

483
00:32:30,856 --> 00:32:34,026
Come on, you could've just asked for photos and videos.

484
00:32:35,096 --> 00:32:37,666
Your team is waiting. Go on.

485
00:32:55,646 --> 00:32:56,686
Eun Oh.

486
00:32:57,616 --> 00:32:59,186
Getting any inspiration?

487
00:32:59,816 --> 00:33:04,056
Yes. It feels so different from when I came here with a client.

488
00:33:04,356 --> 00:33:07,296
I just look at all these materials...

489
00:33:07,366 --> 00:33:10,126
- and picture a house with these. - Exactly.

490
00:33:10,536 --> 00:33:14,166
With our materials, you can match color tones over different textures,

491
00:33:14,306 --> 00:33:17,136
which allows for dozens of unique interior design possibilities.

492
00:33:17,736 --> 00:33:20,606
Getting that point across is the key to this project.

493
00:33:22,376 --> 00:33:24,846
Go on ahead. I'll just look around a bit more.

494
00:33:25,516 --> 00:33:26,516
Okay.

495
00:33:36,126 --> 00:33:39,496
But for the built-in closet, I've chosen one from another firm.

496
00:33:39,956 --> 00:33:41,596
I see, but even if they're both ivory,

497
00:33:41,866 --> 00:33:44,396
the shade might not match our kitchen cabinets.

498
00:33:45,196 --> 00:33:46,896
Even if they're both ivory?

499
00:33:47,166 --> 00:33:48,936
There are many different shades of ivory.

500
00:33:49,366 --> 00:33:51,506
If you use our company's products for everything,

501
00:33:51,576 --> 00:33:53,846
the tone throughout your home will match seamlessly and easily,

502
00:33:54,076 --> 00:33:55,146
making it the more sensible choice.

503
00:33:55,206 --> 00:33:59,516
I see your point. Do you have doors in the same color?

504
00:34:00,216 --> 00:34:01,346
Of course, we do.

505
00:34:01,416 --> 00:34:03,016
(Younglim)

506
00:34:10,756 --> 00:34:15,066
(Achieve a cohesive look with a wide variety of materials.)

507
00:34:21,066 --> 00:34:22,736
What do you mean Eun Oh is postponing her admission?

508
00:34:24,636 --> 00:34:25,636
Because of work?

509
00:34:29,206 --> 00:34:30,206
I see.

510
00:34:33,676 --> 00:34:35,986
Work, all of a sudden? What kind of work?

511
00:34:36,546 --> 00:34:38,286
As if her job is more important right now.

512
00:34:41,486 --> 00:34:43,386
She just loves to wear people out.

513
00:34:44,296 --> 00:34:46,526
She just has to make people worry over nothing.

514
00:34:48,326 --> 00:34:49,566
You know, it's strange.

515
00:34:50,066 --> 00:34:52,496
- What is? - I'm not nervous at all today.

516
00:34:53,396 --> 00:34:57,506
Last time, I was so afraid they'd learn we're not real doctors.

517
00:34:58,406 --> 00:35:00,306
See? This is how you go from a one-time crook to a pro.

518
00:35:02,306 --> 00:35:06,316
But you don't think we'll find Mom in Woo Jin's room, do you?

519
00:35:06,746 --> 00:35:10,656
Who cares? I can go in first and scope it out.

520
00:35:12,486 --> 00:35:14,386
This is exactly why we need a tracker.

521
00:35:14,986 --> 00:35:17,996
And here you are, after bravely telling them about your new studio.

522
00:35:18,396 --> 00:35:20,626
- You forgot? - Right.

523
00:35:21,466 --> 00:35:23,666
"Why can't I visit Woo Jin?"

524
00:35:24,336 --> 00:35:25,666
I said I'd just ask her directly.

525
00:35:28,006 --> 00:35:30,736
I feel like my instincts keep pulling me back to Mom's prison.

526
00:35:42,486 --> 00:35:43,886
Could you please step out for a minute?

527
00:35:44,756 --> 00:35:46,616
I need to speak with the patient for a moment.

528
00:35:46,716 --> 00:35:47,756
Sure.

529
00:35:52,896 --> 00:35:53,896
Mr. Han Woo Jin.

530
00:35:59,336 --> 00:36:00,336
Yeong Ra?

531
00:36:07,876 --> 00:36:09,576
You were following Mom?

532
00:36:10,846 --> 00:36:11,846
You tailed her?

533
00:36:12,346 --> 00:36:13,346
Why?

534
00:36:13,946 --> 00:36:16,716
You don't need to know all the messy details.

535
00:36:16,986 --> 00:36:17,986
It'll just give you a headache.

536
00:36:19,116 --> 00:36:20,586
But why are you here?

537
00:36:21,726 --> 00:36:22,756
What do you mean, why?

538
00:36:23,626 --> 00:36:24,756
Besides Mom,

539
00:36:24,756 --> 00:36:26,656
I'm the only one in the family who knows about your major surgery.

540
00:36:30,266 --> 00:36:31,366
I wanted to come see you.

541
00:36:37,106 --> 00:36:38,106
Family?

542
00:36:39,976 --> 00:36:41,006
Why are you looking at me like that?

543
00:36:43,176 --> 00:36:46,676
You won't tell Mom I was here, right?

544
00:36:48,146 --> 00:36:49,646
Just try not to get caught yourself.

545
00:36:51,316 --> 00:36:52,316
Hurry up and go.

546
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:54,156
Don't come back again.

547
00:36:57,086 --> 00:36:59,696
You don't want me to be here?

548
00:37:01,696 --> 00:37:02,766
It's not that.

549
00:37:03,726 --> 00:37:05,966
You know you'll be in huge trouble if Mom finds out.

550
00:37:07,506 --> 00:37:09,906
So you're telling me not to come because you're worried about me?

551
00:37:11,206 --> 00:37:12,206
Of course.

552
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,046
I know what Mom is like.

553
00:37:17,306 --> 00:37:20,216
And what do you think she's like?

554
00:37:23,886 --> 00:37:25,586
She has such high expectations of you.

555
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:28,286
And you were tailing her, right?

556
00:37:30,796 --> 00:37:31,796
All right.

557
00:37:36,226 --> 00:37:37,296
Hey.

558
00:37:37,596 --> 00:37:38,866
But aren't you bored out of your mind?

559
00:37:39,166 --> 00:37:40,536
Do you want me to recommend a webtoon?

560
00:37:53,716 --> 00:37:54,716
Hold on.

561
00:37:56,546 --> 00:37:57,556
What is it?

562
00:38:10,836 --> 00:38:12,096
My mom just walked by.

563
00:38:36,926 --> 00:38:38,426
Did you know Eun Oh postponed her admission?

564
00:38:39,026 --> 00:38:40,156
Did you hear from her?

565
00:38:41,026 --> 00:38:43,896
She said she had some work to do and would check in before dinner.

566
00:38:44,296 --> 00:38:47,136
And you believed her? What if she's changed her mind?

567
00:38:49,806 --> 00:38:52,376
Eun Oh will be here. Don't worry. You can go.

568
00:38:55,546 --> 00:38:57,406
I'm not leaving until I see her admitted.

569
00:38:59,276 --> 00:39:00,446
I'm telling you. She's coming.

570
00:39:01,216 --> 00:39:02,786
Call her right now. Put it on speaker.

571
00:39:06,256 --> 00:39:07,656
What are you doing? Call her.

572
00:39:08,056 --> 00:39:09,056
I'm reading a webtoon.

573
00:39:10,926 --> 00:39:11,926
So, let me get this straight.

574
00:39:12,396 --> 00:39:14,666
You guarantee Eun Oh will show up. Is that it?

575
00:39:17,096 --> 00:39:18,636
Hey, great work today.

576
00:39:19,096 --> 00:39:22,636
You need to get some rest, so I'll give you a ride.

577
00:39:23,336 --> 00:39:25,136
Aren't you having lunch?

578
00:39:25,506 --> 00:39:28,406
My treat. I still owe you that meal, remember?

579
00:39:29,106 --> 00:39:31,176
If you pull it off, I'll buy you a meal.

580
00:39:32,046 --> 00:39:33,046
That's a promise.

581
00:39:34,216 --> 00:39:35,886
You wouldn't even eat with me when I asked.

582
00:39:36,816 --> 00:39:39,356
Why treat me before surgery? You're making me nervous.

583
00:39:41,656 --> 00:39:42,956
After your surgery is over,

584
00:39:44,696 --> 00:39:46,956
you can treat me then. You have to.

585
00:39:47,866 --> 00:39:50,096
She's worried something will happen during the surgery.

586
00:39:50,366 --> 00:39:52,296
It's like she's trying to keep one last promise.

587
00:39:55,466 --> 00:39:56,466
All right.

588
00:39:57,676 --> 00:39:59,906
Everyone's waiting for you. I'll get going.

589
00:40:00,206 --> 00:40:01,206
Su Jeong.

590
00:40:01,776 --> 00:40:03,276
No, let me take you to the hospital.

591
00:40:03,846 --> 00:40:06,816
It's a straight shot on the subway. And my stuff is in a locker.

592
00:40:13,716 --> 00:40:14,726
You can't go to the hospital.

593
00:40:16,186 --> 00:40:17,186
You can't have the surgery.

594
00:40:19,856 --> 00:40:21,826
I wish I could take Eun Oh and just run away.

595
00:40:23,666 --> 00:40:24,666
Mr. Lee.

596
00:40:25,466 --> 00:40:26,466
Mr. Lee.

597
00:40:28,106 --> 00:40:30,606
You have a video conference with the managing director at 2pm.

598
00:40:32,236 --> 00:40:33,276
That's right.

599
00:40:34,776 --> 00:40:35,776
Okay.

600
00:40:44,786 --> 00:40:47,386
Please put on a gown and come out. We'll do some basic bloodwork.

601
00:40:47,456 --> 00:40:48,826
Then you'll consult with the anesthesiologist.

602
00:40:49,156 --> 00:40:50,156
Okay.

603
00:40:52,896 --> 00:40:54,826
Yes, I understand.

604
00:40:58,766 --> 00:40:59,996
Eun Oh just checked in.

605
00:41:03,366 --> 00:41:04,376
Just go.

606
00:41:05,036 --> 00:41:06,136
And don't bother coming tomorrow.

607
00:41:12,116 --> 00:41:13,116
Woo Jin.

608
00:41:14,786 --> 00:41:16,146
After the surgery,

609
00:41:16,846 --> 00:41:19,416
I'll explain everything in detail.

610
00:41:20,786 --> 00:41:21,956
Once you hear me out,

611
00:41:22,486 --> 00:41:24,156
you'll understand.

612
00:41:25,756 --> 00:41:26,756
I'll see you tomorrow.

613
00:41:28,726 --> 00:41:30,366
I'd rather you didn't come.

614
00:41:49,386 --> 00:41:50,646
Woo Jin, I'm here.

615
00:41:53,086 --> 00:41:54,356
Of course. You're a tough one, Ji Eun Oh.

616
00:41:54,726 --> 00:41:55,786
I know, right?

617
00:41:56,186 --> 00:41:59,196
They say twins are connected, so how did you end up such a mess?

618
00:42:01,066 --> 00:42:02,426
Maybe you can learn a thing or two from me.

619
00:42:03,066 --> 00:42:04,066
I guess I should.

620
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,066
Then,

621
00:42:08,566 --> 00:42:09,636
let's do our best tomorrow.

622
00:42:17,916 --> 00:42:18,916
Let's do this.

623
00:42:38,966 --> 00:42:41,406
I'm so disappointed in Seong Jae.

624
00:42:42,236 --> 00:42:43,666
Once you get a girlfriend,

625
00:42:43,666 --> 00:42:46,106
you must cut ties with any past crushes.

626
00:42:46,306 --> 00:42:47,306
What's his deal?

627
00:42:47,776 --> 00:42:50,476
Is he just clueless, or is he not over her?

628
00:42:50,806 --> 00:42:52,016
I don't think that's it.

629
00:42:52,346 --> 00:42:54,746
If he still had feelings for her, he wouldn't be dating me.

630
00:42:55,146 --> 00:42:56,186
Then why are you letting it bother you?

631
00:42:57,956 --> 00:43:01,526
It's not that weird to visit someone after they've had major surgery.

632
00:43:01,986 --> 00:43:03,956
Seong Jae's a decent guy.

633
00:43:05,056 --> 00:43:07,196
I know, but...

634
00:43:08,096 --> 00:43:12,036
it still bothers me. I hate worrying that he isn't fully over her.

635
00:43:12,296 --> 00:43:14,666
You're getting jealous of someone you've never even met?

636
00:43:15,206 --> 00:43:16,206
Look,

637
00:43:16,766 --> 00:43:20,506
that kind of thing is exhausting. I've seen it tear couples apart.

638
00:43:21,276 --> 00:43:22,276
Come on.

639
00:43:22,906 --> 00:43:26,046
I wouldn't be with him if he had any feelings left for someone else.

640
00:43:44,366 --> 00:43:45,366
So cool.

641
00:43:48,166 --> 00:43:49,166
Somebody, help me.

642
00:43:49,436 --> 00:43:52,306
Now that it's my turn, my heart's pounding out of my chest.

643
00:43:56,546 --> 00:43:57,606
Are you ready?

644
00:43:58,716 --> 00:43:59,716
Yes.

645
00:44:01,216 --> 00:44:03,586
- Ms. Jo Ok Rye, you're up. - Yes.

646
00:44:06,186 --> 00:44:07,186
All right.

647
00:44:11,256 --> 00:44:12,326
I am a model.

648
00:44:15,066 --> 00:44:16,066
That's my grandma.

649
00:44:47,456 --> 00:44:49,366
My grandma is so cool.

650
00:45:59,936 --> 00:46:03,436
- Great job. That was great. - Amazing!

651
00:46:10,206 --> 00:46:12,476
- Grandma! - Well done!

652
00:46:13,776 --> 00:46:18,256
Grandma, you were amazing today. You looked like a total pro!

653
00:46:18,386 --> 00:46:20,616
My heart was about to leap out of my chest.

654
00:46:20,756 --> 00:46:24,826
Really? Your walk was perfect, and that outfit was made for you.

655
00:46:25,026 --> 00:46:27,126
You were so charismatic.

656
00:46:28,096 --> 00:46:31,196
You went through a lot helping me too, didn't you?

657
00:46:31,396 --> 00:46:33,566
No, I was here filming for my project anyway.

658
00:46:34,866 --> 00:46:35,866
Let's get a cab, Grandma.

659
00:46:36,306 --> 00:46:38,476
You've been on your feet all day, so let's take it easy.

660
00:46:40,336 --> 00:46:41,346
Su Bin.

661
00:46:42,146 --> 00:46:43,306
Actually,

662
00:46:43,846 --> 00:46:45,146
let's go home separately today.

663
00:46:46,076 --> 00:46:47,676
Separately? Why?

664
00:46:49,716 --> 00:46:53,386
I just feel like it. What? Is that weird?

665
00:46:55,386 --> 00:46:58,426
No, it's not. You know which bus to take home from here, right?

666
00:46:58,496 --> 00:47:00,926
Of course. I even did a dry run.

667
00:47:01,696 --> 00:47:03,196
Okay, I'll see you at home.

668
00:47:04,636 --> 00:47:05,636
Get home safe.

669
00:47:09,636 --> 00:47:11,066
Maybe she's just overwhelmed by it all?

670
00:47:11,736 --> 00:47:12,736
Yes, I think so.

671
00:47:25,086 --> 00:47:26,386
I'm going to head out.

672
00:47:34,696 --> 00:47:36,766
How could you let your grandma go home alone?

673
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:39,836
I only came here to see you.

674
00:47:40,366 --> 00:47:42,666
Hey, don't get the wrong idea.

675
00:47:43,236 --> 00:47:45,136
No matter how much I like you,

676
00:47:45,436 --> 00:47:47,106
I would never let my grandma go home alone.

677
00:47:48,576 --> 00:47:50,276
Then why did she leave alone?

678
00:47:52,346 --> 00:47:53,446
She said she wanted to go alone.

679
00:47:54,616 --> 00:47:57,046
I guess she wants to savor the moment.

680
00:47:58,156 --> 00:47:59,816
She's not an ordinary grandma anymore, you know.

681
00:48:02,856 --> 00:48:04,086
She's a very special grandma.

682
00:48:05,256 --> 00:48:07,056
I was amazed when I saw her on stage.

683
00:48:08,626 --> 00:48:09,626
But...

684
00:48:10,526 --> 00:48:11,696
why are you here?

685
00:48:14,536 --> 00:48:15,866
If I didn't get to see you today,

686
00:48:17,306 --> 00:48:18,506
I thought I was going to lose my mind.

687
00:48:20,536 --> 00:48:21,546
Well...

688
00:48:22,176 --> 00:48:23,276
I can't say I mind hearing that.

689
00:48:31,756 --> 00:48:32,856
I like you.

690
00:48:34,956 --> 00:48:36,326
I like you a lot.

691
00:48:37,826 --> 00:48:38,956
All I can think about...

692
00:48:40,226 --> 00:48:41,666
is you.

693
00:48:45,436 --> 00:48:46,436
So, what's your answer?

694
00:48:47,096 --> 00:48:48,106
You don't believe me?

695
00:48:49,366 --> 00:48:51,406
I do, but...

696
00:48:57,776 --> 00:48:59,646
I'm sorry for making you feel insecure.

697
00:49:00,576 --> 00:49:01,786
But that friend of mine...

698
00:49:02,946 --> 00:49:04,346
Actually, it's because of her...

699
00:49:05,286 --> 00:49:07,686
that I became sure of my feelings for you.

700
00:49:09,426 --> 00:49:11,696
There's a reason I can't go with you.

701
00:49:12,126 --> 00:49:13,356
A bunch of us are going together,

702
00:49:13,956 --> 00:49:15,526
but she's going through some things.

703
00:49:16,196 --> 00:49:19,436
It's not like I was insisting we go together.

704
00:49:20,236 --> 00:49:21,236
I know.

705
00:49:21,766 --> 00:49:23,206
I didn't explain myself well.

706
00:49:24,736 --> 00:49:27,436
But it's complicated. So please, just be patient with me.

707
00:49:28,446 --> 00:49:30,976
Once things are settled between your brother, Ji Hyuk, and Eun Oh,

708
00:49:31,676 --> 00:49:32,676
I'll tell you everything then.

709
00:49:34,746 --> 00:49:38,086
So is she someone you can introduce me to someday?

710
00:49:39,456 --> 00:49:40,456
Of course.

711
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:42,786
And about...

712
00:49:43,756 --> 00:49:44,996
the crush I mentioned.

713
00:49:45,696 --> 00:49:47,526
That wasn't love.

714
00:49:48,596 --> 00:49:49,766
I realize that now that I've met you.

715
00:49:58,206 --> 00:49:59,206
I'm sorry.

716
00:50:00,206 --> 00:50:01,306
I jumped to conclusions.

717
00:50:07,016 --> 00:50:08,186
No, I'm the one who's sorry.

718
00:50:09,386 --> 00:50:10,616
For causing the misunderstanding.

719
00:50:35,506 --> 00:50:37,776
Is that Jo Ok Rye?

720
00:50:39,376 --> 00:50:43,016
The Jo Ok Rye who reeked of fish from her husband's anchovy boat?

721
00:50:45,516 --> 00:50:49,256
The one who used to gut fish at the market?

722
00:50:53,596 --> 00:50:54,596
The same Jo Ok Rye who used to...

723
00:50:54,926 --> 00:50:58,766
clean her husband's bedpan at the hospital?

724
00:50:59,896 --> 00:51:03,106
The Jo Ok Rye whose heart was breaking...

725
00:51:03,336 --> 00:51:05,776
when Sang Cheol couldn't find a new job?

726
00:51:07,206 --> 00:51:09,246
The one who felt sorry for her daughter-in-law...

727
00:51:09,576 --> 00:51:13,816
and felt like a burden to everyone, not knowing when she might pass?

728
00:51:18,356 --> 00:51:20,286
Not anymore.

729
00:51:21,186 --> 00:51:22,286
Now...

730
00:51:23,426 --> 00:51:24,926
I'm just Jo Ok Rye.

731
00:51:28,426 --> 00:51:30,966
Jo Ok Rye, the senior model.

732
00:51:33,596 --> 00:51:38,066
One, two, three, four, five.

733
00:51:38,736 --> 00:51:39,736
And pose.

734
00:51:39,836 --> 00:51:43,846
One, two, three, four, five.

735
00:51:45,746 --> 00:51:46,746
Mom.

736
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:48,716
Dad.

737
00:51:50,316 --> 00:51:52,956
Your Ok Rye became a model.

738
00:51:54,286 --> 00:51:58,186
I bet you'd come back to life just to see for yourselves.

739
00:52:21,146 --> 00:52:22,246
Seong Jae.

740
00:52:45,976 --> 00:52:49,946
I guess she took the bus. I wonder why she didn't take a cab.

741
00:52:52,776 --> 00:52:54,546
She was trying to save money on the fare.

742
00:52:54,846 --> 00:52:55,946
The cab fare?

743
00:52:58,046 --> 00:52:59,886
But she must be exhausted today.

744
00:53:00,716 --> 00:53:02,286
I guess all moms are the same.

745
00:53:02,956 --> 00:53:06,856
My grandma saw my dad wearing all those pain patches...

746
00:53:06,926 --> 00:53:09,966
and said she'd save money to buy a mat from Mom's store.

747
00:53:10,926 --> 00:53:12,836
- What kind of mat? - Not sure.

748
00:53:12,936 --> 00:53:15,566
Grandma has tried it. She just said it was amazing.

749
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:22,076
Grandma...

750
00:53:22,906 --> 00:53:24,406
is a mom, too.

751
00:53:33,586 --> 00:53:35,526
Is no one home yet?

752
00:53:37,986 --> 00:53:40,856
- Congratulations, Grandma! - Congratulations! Here you go.

753
00:53:40,956 --> 00:53:41,996
Gosh, you scared me!

754
00:53:42,326 --> 00:53:44,266
- Let's light the candles. - What in the world is all this?

755
00:53:45,136 --> 00:53:47,536
- Here. - Make a wish and blow it out.

756
00:53:47,796 --> 00:53:49,066
Right.

757
00:53:50,906 --> 00:53:53,906
- Yes! - Congratulations.

758
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:55,746
Thank you, everyone.

759
00:53:56,706 --> 00:53:58,146
This is just wonderful.

760
00:53:59,746 --> 00:54:00,846
Mother, is that really you?

761
00:54:01,276 --> 00:54:02,586
You look like a completely different person.

762
00:54:02,816 --> 00:54:05,616
Wow, who knew my mother had this side to her?

763
00:54:07,056 --> 00:54:08,356
What's all that supposed to mean?

764
00:54:08,726 --> 00:54:10,726
It means you're awesome, Grandma!

765
00:54:10,926 --> 00:54:12,996
Grandma, is it even legal for you to look this cool?

766
00:54:14,156 --> 00:54:17,926
This is just from the clips of you that Ha Eun rushed to edit.

767
00:54:18,026 --> 00:54:21,436
- In the cut, Grandma was the star. - Oh, my.

768
00:54:21,436 --> 00:54:23,266
Her stage presence was on another level.

769
00:54:23,936 --> 00:54:25,736
It was the strangest thing.

770
00:54:26,136 --> 00:54:28,846
Backstage, I was shaking like a leaf,

771
00:54:29,346 --> 00:54:31,606
but the second that spotlight hit me,

772
00:54:32,076 --> 00:54:35,216
- my feet glided by themselves. - My goodness.

773
00:54:35,716 --> 00:54:38,316
Turns out you're a natural on stage, Mother.

774
00:54:38,916 --> 00:54:40,756
That makeup and that outfit...

775
00:54:41,116 --> 00:54:43,556
I'm over 60, and I've never seen you like that before.

776
00:54:43,626 --> 00:54:46,696
Grandma, can our whole family come to your next fashion show?

777
00:54:48,026 --> 00:54:52,266
Really? Well, I suppose you could all come now.

778
00:54:52,336 --> 00:54:53,366
You should come.

779
00:54:56,036 --> 00:54:57,236
Seriously, Grandma, you're the best.

780
00:55:04,346 --> 00:55:05,676
Listen, Da Jeong.

781
00:55:06,416 --> 00:55:07,546
Yes, Mother?

782
00:55:08,646 --> 00:55:11,086
Today, I...

783
00:55:11,956 --> 00:55:13,316
I got my modeling fee.

784
00:55:14,156 --> 00:55:15,326
But it's...

785
00:55:15,726 --> 00:55:16,926
Did you lose it?

786
00:55:17,386 --> 00:55:19,426
No, nothing like that.

787
00:55:20,096 --> 00:55:21,826
It's the very first money...

788
00:55:22,266 --> 00:55:24,566
I've ever earned from having a proper job.

789
00:55:24,926 --> 00:55:27,636
And I know it's only right to give it to you,

790
00:55:29,366 --> 00:55:30,736
but I want to give it to my son.

791
00:55:31,506 --> 00:55:32,506
Mother.

792
00:55:32,906 --> 00:55:35,546
It's your money. Why give it to either of us?

793
00:55:35,906 --> 00:55:37,446
You should spend it on yourself.

794
00:55:37,946 --> 00:55:39,546
It's my first paycheck,

795
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:42,986
and I just want to give it to him.

796
00:55:45,856 --> 00:55:47,216
Fine. But you have to give me...

797
00:55:47,216 --> 00:55:49,656
your second paycheck, every last cent.

798
00:55:50,586 --> 00:55:51,756
Of course.

799
00:55:52,026 --> 00:55:54,626
I was already planning on it. Absolutely.

800
00:55:55,766 --> 00:55:58,796
Go on. Talk to your son.

801
00:56:00,966 --> 00:56:02,306
Here, take this.

802
00:56:03,936 --> 00:56:05,236
What is this?

803
00:56:05,506 --> 00:56:08,106
When your mother tells you to take something, you take it.

804
00:56:08,546 --> 00:56:09,646
Hurry.

805
00:56:10,576 --> 00:56:11,776
Okay.

806
00:56:13,646 --> 00:56:14,846
That is...

807
00:56:15,616 --> 00:56:16,986
the first money I've ever...

808
00:56:17,316 --> 00:56:21,956
It's the first money I've earned from a real job.

809
00:56:22,826 --> 00:56:24,726
But I'm just a beginner,

810
00:56:25,356 --> 00:56:27,826
so the modeling fee wasn't much.

811
00:56:28,296 --> 00:56:30,966
And after taxes and all that, well...

812
00:56:31,726 --> 00:56:33,236
There's probably some loose change in there.

813
00:56:34,696 --> 00:56:36,566
But why are you giving this to me?

814
00:56:39,436 --> 00:56:42,506
You've fed me for over 20 years...

815
00:56:43,806 --> 00:56:45,776
and paid for your father's hospital bills.

816
00:56:47,046 --> 00:56:48,476
I've been so grateful.

817
00:56:48,986 --> 00:56:51,886
That's why I wanted to give you...

818
00:56:53,116 --> 00:56:54,316
my very first paycheck.

819
00:56:59,056 --> 00:57:00,396
Mother.

820
00:57:01,926 --> 00:57:04,766
I guess I did a pretty decent job today.

821
00:57:04,766 --> 00:57:08,806
They've already scheduled my next gig.

822
00:57:09,136 --> 00:57:12,636
But I promised my next paycheck to your wife.

823
00:57:14,306 --> 00:57:15,406
Right.

824
00:57:15,746 --> 00:57:17,776
All right. I'll take it.

825
00:57:18,376 --> 00:57:19,516
Thank you.

826
00:57:20,546 --> 00:57:22,016
Wow, this is hefty.

827
00:57:22,486 --> 00:57:24,016
Come on.

828
00:57:24,516 --> 00:57:26,586
You're embarrassing me.

829
00:57:27,856 --> 00:57:30,956
Gosh, I never thought...

830
00:57:31,026 --> 00:57:33,426
I'd be getting an allowance from my mom in my 60s.

831
00:57:36,526 --> 00:57:37,666
Sang Cheol.

832
00:57:40,066 --> 00:57:41,266
Don't...

833
00:57:42,006 --> 00:57:43,836
work yourself to the bone like this.

834
00:57:46,176 --> 00:57:47,606
For 33 years,

835
00:57:49,046 --> 00:57:50,446
you've been the man of the house.

836
00:57:52,476 --> 00:57:54,116
Because of your useless parents,

837
00:57:54,876 --> 00:57:57,216
you had to break your back for us.

838
00:57:59,956 --> 00:58:01,216
These days, well...

839
00:58:02,526 --> 00:58:04,426
I hear there's something called a reverse mortgage.

840
00:58:05,626 --> 00:58:09,596
With our current mortgage, how much would we even get?

841
00:58:10,896 --> 00:58:13,336
We still have a long way to go, don't we?

842
00:58:15,506 --> 00:58:16,666
I suppose that's true.

843
00:58:18,706 --> 00:58:20,306
I myself never dreamed...

844
00:58:21,776 --> 00:58:23,906
I'd live long enough...

845
00:58:24,476 --> 00:58:25,976
to see 90.

846
00:58:28,216 --> 00:58:29,516
If only your father...

847
00:58:30,246 --> 00:58:33,916
hadn't been constantly in and out of the hospital,

848
00:58:34,986 --> 00:58:38,726
I would have gone out and gotten a job long ago.

849
00:58:42,496 --> 00:58:44,396
I never thought I'd spend so many years...

850
00:58:46,066 --> 00:58:48,336
just being a burden.

851
00:58:49,406 --> 00:58:50,506
To be honest,

852
00:58:51,106 --> 00:58:53,276
I'm scared too.

853
00:58:54,576 --> 00:58:59,176
I can get by doing odd jobs, even if it's not a proper career.

854
00:58:59,176 --> 00:59:00,446
But...

855
00:59:01,016 --> 00:59:03,486
what if I have to live like that for too long?

856
00:59:04,646 --> 00:59:05,856
That's why...

857
00:59:06,156 --> 00:59:09,086
I'm trying to find a stable job, Mother.

858
00:59:12,526 --> 00:59:15,126
But we still have Ji Hyuk.

859
00:59:16,666 --> 00:59:19,196
He's the CEO of a big company now.

860
00:59:20,036 --> 00:59:22,966
That company is built on investor debt.

861
00:59:22,966 --> 00:59:25,836
So deep down, I'm always on edge about it.

862
00:59:26,136 --> 00:59:28,076
I'm just praying he'll be okay.

863
00:59:29,206 --> 00:59:31,976
But even if Ji Hyuk does get on his feet,

864
00:59:32,476 --> 00:59:35,486
I don't want to live off of an allowance from him.

865
00:59:38,686 --> 00:59:39,786
Right.

866
00:59:41,216 --> 00:59:42,726
Of course, I know.

867
00:59:45,056 --> 00:59:46,156
That day...

868
00:59:46,426 --> 00:59:48,866
I saw you when it was just the two of us.

869
00:59:55,466 --> 00:59:56,806
I'm sorry, Mother.

870
00:59:57,866 --> 00:59:59,906
What do you have to be sorry for?

871
01:00:02,576 --> 01:00:06,276
I'm the one who should be sorry. You're...

872
01:00:06,846 --> 01:00:09,286
You've been walking with a long face every day,

873
01:00:10,046 --> 01:00:11,386
and yet I'm the one...

874
01:00:12,086 --> 01:00:13,416
who's been on cloud nine lately.

875
01:00:15,456 --> 01:00:16,926
Gosh, Mother.

876
01:00:17,226 --> 01:00:20,596
I wonder what cloud nine is like when you're almost 90.

877
01:00:29,806 --> 01:00:30,936
I hope my son...

878
01:00:32,876 --> 01:00:35,906
gets to feel this way until he's 90, too.

879
01:00:54,526 --> 01:00:58,396
"To our valued customers. Due to a family member's surgery,"

880
01:00:58,466 --> 01:01:00,636
"we will be closing early today."

881
01:01:01,896 --> 01:01:03,406
Nice touch, Gang Oh.

882
01:01:03,706 --> 01:01:05,536
- Does it look okay? - Yes.

01:01:11,106 --> 01:01:13,446
(Cheong Ah University Hospital)

884
01:01:15,986 --> 01:01:19,116
Mom, why'd you give her pigtails? That's so not her style.

885
01:01:19,656 --> 01:01:22,356
I haven't done your hair since you finished elementary school.

886
01:01:23,326 --> 01:01:24,956
It's a shame it has to be for a surgery.

887
01:01:26,296 --> 01:01:27,956
Maybe I should ask you to do it once a month then?

888
01:01:30,396 --> 01:01:32,296
That means you plan on making it out of there alive.

889
01:01:32,866 --> 01:01:36,206
Of course. Have you seen anyone here who's healthier than me?

890
01:01:36,266 --> 01:01:39,636
Right. I couldn't even sleep, and you were sleeping like a rock?

891
01:01:39,636 --> 01:01:42,276
I saw you when I used the bathroom. You were drooling.

892
01:01:42,346 --> 01:01:43,976
I was not drooling!

893
01:01:44,676 --> 01:01:47,946
Gang Oh, you came to talk nonsense, didn't you?

894
01:01:48,276 --> 01:01:52,156
You think I'd miss my one chance to see you at your ugliest moment?

895
01:01:52,586 --> 01:01:55,456
- I'll take pictures. - Gosh, Gang Oh, you're impossible.

896
01:01:56,586 --> 01:01:59,126
I thought we'd be sending her off to the OR in tears,

897
01:01:59,556 --> 01:02:00,896
but it looks like we'll send her off smiling.

898
01:02:02,566 --> 01:02:05,636
By the way, some guy has been pacing back and forth in the hall.

899
01:02:05,736 --> 01:02:06,836
What?

900
01:02:12,736 --> 01:02:13,736
What?

901
01:02:17,776 --> 01:02:18,916
Hello.

902
01:02:19,646 --> 01:02:23,816
- I work with Eun Oh. - Oh, I see.

903
01:02:25,316 --> 01:02:27,756
Shouldn't you be at work? What are you doing here?

904
01:02:28,156 --> 01:02:30,556
Eun Oh and I are business partners now.

905
01:02:31,126 --> 01:02:33,926
I think we've met a few times when I've dropped her off.

906
01:02:34,296 --> 01:02:37,166
Right. Yes, that's right. I remember you now.

907
01:02:37,696 --> 01:02:38,936
Look at him, acting all innocent.

908
01:02:41,536 --> 01:02:42,536
Gang Oh.

909
01:02:44,606 --> 01:02:45,606
It's been a while.

910
01:02:48,036 --> 01:02:49,876
Did you get any sleep?

911
01:02:51,606 --> 01:02:52,916
I feel great.

912
01:02:54,316 --> 01:02:55,376
About the surgery...

913
01:02:55,686 --> 01:02:57,446
I never got the chance to wish you good luck on the surgery.

914
01:02:59,116 --> 01:03:00,316
Hey, that guy...

915
01:03:00,916 --> 01:03:04,356
Isn't he the senior from school Eun Oh used to have a crush on?

916
01:03:04,956 --> 01:03:05,956
That's him.

917
01:03:07,726 --> 01:03:11,726
- I have to go to the OR now. - Right.

918
01:03:12,236 --> 01:03:13,336
Your surgery...

919
01:03:14,036 --> 01:03:15,036
I hope it goes well.

920
01:03:17,206 --> 01:03:18,206
Thanks.

921
01:03:19,006 --> 01:03:21,106
To think I'll get to see you healthy again,

922
01:03:22,206 --> 01:03:23,376
it feels like a dream.

923
01:03:26,376 --> 01:03:29,616
You're going to get updates. Did you really need to come?

924
01:03:31,446 --> 01:03:33,616
I'm your mother. That makes me your guardian.

925
01:03:35,826 --> 01:03:36,956
Besides,

926
01:03:37,086 --> 01:03:40,456
I was the one who wanted to save you the most.

927
01:03:41,626 --> 01:03:43,366
Do you want to deny that too?

928
01:03:49,536 --> 01:03:52,276
Just go to sleep, it'll all be over when you wake up, Woo Jin.

929
01:03:58,106 --> 01:04:01,646
Mr. Han, you're the recipient today of a liver transplant.

930
01:04:01,716 --> 01:04:06,556
The surgery will take eight hours, and you'll get a partial liver.

931
01:04:06,916 --> 01:04:09,856
You'll be moved to the ICU immediately after surgery.

932
01:04:45,696 --> 01:04:46,926
You've got this, Woo Jin.

933
01:05:42,016 --> 01:05:44,186
(Our Golden Days)

934
01:05:44,586 --> 01:05:47,016
The surgery went well, didn't it? Is Eun Oh okay?

935
01:05:47,156 --> 01:05:49,486
Who is he doing that for?

936
01:05:49,726 --> 01:05:52,996
I'm sorry I only ever yelled at you for not living your own life.

937
01:05:53,556 --> 01:05:55,256
You're just like Dokgo Chan.

938
01:05:55,826 --> 01:05:58,566
- Because I'm pretty. - My goodness.

939
01:05:58,866 --> 01:06:00,136
You're dating?

940
01:06:00,366 --> 01:06:03,036
I've been working on a webtoon this whole time.

941
01:06:03,206 --> 01:06:06,236
- Is Mr. Lee okay? - Mom, don't tell me you...

942
01:06:06,706 --> 01:06:09,076
If only things could always be...

943
01:06:09,846 --> 01:06:11,546
exactly like they are today.

944
01:06:12,206 --> 01:06:13,216
A car accident?
