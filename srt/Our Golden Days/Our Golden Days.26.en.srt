All done.

Yes.

Mom.

19
00:01:08,018 --> 00:01:10,758
Eun Oh. You said you weren't going to the site today.

20
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:14,058
- Come to the restaurant now. - Why?

21
00:01:14,128 --> 00:01:15,898
Gang Oh's gotten himself into trouble.

Now, they're saying they want to come and try my galbi.

What do you mean they want to try it?

25
00:01:29,508 --> 00:01:31,948
They were working on a new menu item.

26
00:01:31,948 --> 00:01:33,948

See? I did good, right?

31
00:01:46,388 --> 00:01:48,258
You just went and made more work for us.

32
00:01:48,528 --> 00:01:50,358

Mom, I'm sorry.

37

It's nothing. I just got dizzy for a moment.

Anyway, I have that construction job tomorrow,

57
00:03:07,008 --> 00:03:09,708
and I have some prep work to do, so I should probably get going.

- I'm heading out. - Okay.

59
00:03:19,818 --> 00:03:21,788
I shouldn't have registered my DNA.

60
00:03:22,258 --> 00:03:23,418
I really shouldn't have.

61
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,628

65
00:03:45,578 --> 00:03:47,578
I guess we'll move ahead with the showroom?

66
00:03:48,378 --> 00:03:49,548
We would, right, Ms. Ji?

67
00:03:50,378 --> 00:03:51,978
Yes, I think so.

But if we go back to the original plan,

76
00:04:13,808 --> 00:04:16,738
there's no guarantee they'll stay on board.

77
00:04:17,778 --> 00:04:20,908

- Hello? - Mr. Lee.

89
00:04:56,418 --> 00:04:58,678
We passed the AP Group preliminary bid.

90
00:04:59,588 --> 00:05:00,718
We did?

Okay, I'll call you back in a bit. All right.

92

We've been officially shortlisted for the AP Group acquisition.

93

- Really? - Yes.

94
00:05:11,498 --> 00:05:14,698
That was no easy feat, but we finally made it.

95
00:05:15,298 --> 00:05:17,198

Rumiko and Yeongsin Paper are the strongest contenders.

104

Both companies are very determined to acquire AP,

105
00:05:46,598 --> 00:05:48,768
and I hear they've already secured the funds.

106

Yes.

121
00:06:46,128 --> 00:06:47,658
She looks like she doesn't have a care in the world.

122
00:06:48,428 --> 00:06:50,758
For the past two months, ever since club recruitment,

123
00:06:51,058 --> 00:06:53,468
- she's been all smiles. - Not at all, man.

124
00:06:53,868 --> 00:06:57,468
I've only seen her eat cafeteria food once a semester.

125
00:06:57,698 --> 00:06:58,908
She always eats convenience store food.

She's always working two tutoring jobs.

She must be the family's breadwinner.

128
00:07:03,938 --> 00:07:06,878
But what about the volunteer event? She brought dozens of sandwiches.

129
00:07:07,048 --> 00:07:09,048
She made those herself.

130
00:07:09,948 --> 00:07:11,748

you said she was the family's breadwinner.

00:07:16,118 --> 00:07:19,588
I don't know. That's just who Ji Eun Oh is. Yes.

Gosh, you scared me!

141
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:44,148
Hey, why are you doing that?

142
00:07:44,518 --> 00:07:45,818
You're the turnkey team lead.

143
00:07:46,088 --> 00:07:48,218
Everyone has a different role depending on their position,

144
00:07:48,548 --> 00:07:49,858
so why are you doing a labourer's work?

145
00:07:50,388 --> 00:07:52,628
See, that's your problem.

146
00:07:52,888 --> 00:07:54,628
You're always too quick to judge.

147
00:07:55,188 --> 00:07:56,428
I'm having fun.

148
00:07:56,698 --> 00:07:57,828
I'm doing it because I enjoy it.

149
00:07:57,998 --> 00:08:00,228
Come on, how can this be fun? It's hard work.

150
00:08:00,298 --> 00:08:02,338
I'm doing it because the details are important.

151
00:08:02,638 --> 00:08:03,868
It's not like I'm fixing a defect.

152
00:08:04,368 --> 00:08:05,868
For a job I'm passionate about,

153
00:08:06,408 --> 00:08:08,238
I'm just adding the finishing touches.

154
00:08:08,908 --> 00:08:12,348
So you enjoy getting on your knees and oiling the floors?

155
00:08:14,548 --> 00:08:15,548
Then, Ji Hyuk,

156
00:08:16,018 --> 00:08:17,978
why did you take on the AP Group acquisition?

157
00:08:18,448 --> 00:08:20,718
Everyone says you're fighting a losing battle.

158
00:08:21,448 --> 00:08:24,158
And yet, you're trying to pull off this massive, impossible feat.

159
00:08:25,488 --> 00:08:26,828
Aren't you just doing it for the thrill?

160
00:08:26,988 --> 00:08:29,858
What lunatic would buy a company for the thrill of it?

161
00:08:30,098 --> 00:08:31,328
What I mean is,

162
00:08:32,028 --> 00:08:33,028
business...

163
00:08:33,368 --> 00:08:35,568
isn't always just about making money.

164
00:08:38,468 --> 00:08:40,108
You've got a point there.

165
00:08:44,408 --> 00:08:45,408
But...

166
00:08:45,778 --> 00:08:47,878
for a guy who's busy day and night trying to secure investors,

167
00:08:48,378 --> 00:08:49,948
how did you find the time to come here?

168
00:08:52,018 --> 00:08:54,048
I won the preliminary bid.

169
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:00,628
You're kidding! Wow, how did you pull that off?

170
00:09:01,088 --> 00:09:03,458
When I set my mind to something, I get it done.

171
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,628
Listen to you brag.

172
00:09:06,228 --> 00:09:10,068
Couldn't you just say, "I guess I got lucky?"

173
00:09:10,198 --> 00:09:11,698
There's no such thing as luck in this world.

174
00:09:13,338 --> 00:09:16,338
You met my eyes as I stood at the wedding altar.

175
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:18,278
How can you even talk about luck?

176
00:09:23,818 --> 00:09:25,848
Whatever luck I had left in my life,

177
00:09:26,288 --> 00:09:27,588
I'm pretty sure it all ran out that day.

178
00:09:29,018 --> 00:09:31,018
You're finally acting like the old Ji Hyuk again.

179
00:09:31,858 --> 00:09:34,358
Saying whatever's on your mind, no filter.

180
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,728
Right. Did you do the DNA registration?

181
00:09:39,428 --> 00:09:41,868
- I did. - See? Aren't you glad you listened?

182
00:09:42,198 --> 00:09:44,198
I can be useful to you sometimes.

183
00:09:45,338 --> 00:09:46,808
I was going to do it anyway.

184
00:09:47,938 --> 00:09:51,278
And that song you always hum when you're excited...

185
00:09:51,578 --> 00:09:52,778
You've been singing the lyrics wrong.

186
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,108
That's just because I haven't sung it in a while.

187
00:09:55,448 --> 00:09:57,818
No, you've had it wrong ever since your second year of college.

188
00:09:58,778 --> 00:10:01,248
Look at me, I'm a wrecked mess

189
00:10:01,248 --> 00:10:02,318
That's not how it goes.

190
00:10:02,688 --> 00:10:05,288
Look at me, I'm a lonely mess

191
00:10:05,358 --> 00:10:06,358
That's the correct version.

192
00:10:07,728 --> 00:10:10,858
Look at me, I'm a lonely mess

193
00:10:12,428 --> 00:10:14,198
Why are you just telling me now?

194
00:10:14,528 --> 00:10:15,728
Because I found you annoying.

195
00:10:17,438 --> 00:10:18,438
Back in college?

196
00:10:18,798 --> 00:10:20,108
Why? What did I do?

197
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:23,178
Back then, you were cute. Now, you're just too slick.

198
00:10:23,878 --> 00:10:24,878
It's a little disappointing.

199
00:10:25,638 --> 00:10:26,648
Shoot.

200
00:10:26,908 --> 00:10:28,748
Gosh, I've got two investor meetings to get to.

201
00:10:29,008 --> 00:10:30,978
Hey, I have to go. Take it easy, okay?

202
00:10:30,978 --> 00:10:31,978
Wait...

203
00:10:35,418 --> 00:10:37,088
He came all this way even though he's so busy.

204
00:10:38,358 --> 00:10:41,028
It's nice to see him acting like his old self again.

205
00:10:42,028 --> 00:10:43,628
You made the right call, Ji Hyuk.

(Gaon Foundation)

207
00:10:50,198 --> 00:10:53,968
I trust nothing has been omitted or embellished here?

208
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:57,378
- The information is solid, then. - Of course, ma'am.

209
00:10:58,038 --> 00:11:01,248
I've been networking in high society for 30 years.

210
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:04,278
All right, first...

211
00:11:05,218 --> 00:11:06,618
Let's start with this one.

212
00:11:08,548 --> 00:11:10,088
But, ma'am.

213
00:11:10,618 --> 00:11:13,258
Your son is so handsome and tall.

214
00:11:13,728 --> 00:11:16,028
The youngest daughter of the Haena Group family,

215
00:11:16,398 --> 00:11:19,298
who met him in the US, seems to be interested in him.

216
00:11:19,668 --> 00:11:21,928
Why did you turn her down?

217
00:11:22,998 --> 00:11:24,568
She's the daughter of the second wife.

218
00:11:25,838 --> 00:11:28,708
His first wife passed away, and he remarried.

219
00:11:29,678 --> 00:11:31,778
Besides, Director Park has been married before.

220
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:35,508
I'd rank her higher than these other girls.

221
00:11:36,648 --> 00:11:38,818
She was his illegitimate daughter...

222
00:11:38,818 --> 00:11:40,748
until the first wife's accidental death.

223
00:11:40,888 --> 00:11:42,588
But still, it's Haena Group.

224
00:11:48,188 --> 00:11:49,228
Never mind.

225
00:11:51,298 --> 00:11:52,898
And as for my son...

226
00:11:53,428 --> 00:11:55,498
This is technically his first marriage.

227
00:11:57,098 --> 00:11:59,608
He was just duped by a gold digger.

228
00:12:00,638 --> 00:12:02,468
Gosh, it's so upsetting to even think about.

230
00:12:27,598 --> 00:12:28,598
There we go.

(Mom's Car)

232
00:12:33,238 --> 00:12:34,568
Take my heart.

233
00:12:40,778 --> 00:12:42,548
Hey, this is so cool.

234
00:12:42,548 --> 00:12:44,548
Mom's car is lit up at the foundation.

235
00:12:45,118 --> 00:12:47,618
Gosh, I thought my heart was going to pound out of my chest.

236
00:12:48,218 --> 00:12:51,188
Let's get out of here. I'm starving. Waiting for you was brutal.

237
00:12:51,258 --> 00:12:53,988
- Got anything in mind? - Chicken and beer by the Han River.

238
00:12:54,088 --> 00:12:56,598
The Han River? No, we can't go all the way there.

239
00:12:56,728 --> 00:12:58,258
We need to ease into it.

240
00:12:59,228 --> 00:13:00,228
You think so?

241
00:13:00,628 --> 00:13:03,168
Today, let's just go to the park right here.

242
00:13:04,068 --> 00:13:05,068
Okay.

243
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:15,078
Say something.

244
00:13:16,118 --> 00:13:18,748
- Cheers. - No, not that.

245
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,618
Today you pulled off something like a jailbreak.

246
00:13:21,818 --> 00:13:24,158
Sum up how you feel right now in one phrase.

247
00:13:28,758 --> 00:13:30,328
Let's do it again, the jailbreak.

248
00:13:30,858 --> 00:13:32,798
Sounds good. Let's do it again!

249
00:13:33,398 --> 00:13:34,398
Cheers.

250
00:13:38,698 --> 00:13:39,868
Hey.

251
00:13:43,478 --> 00:13:44,638
This is so good!

252
00:13:44,808 --> 00:13:48,808
Yeong Ra, why are you chugging? You've barely had a drink before.

253
00:13:49,108 --> 00:13:50,878
What if it hits you all at once and you get wasted?

254
00:13:51,118 --> 00:13:52,688
- I won't get drunk. - Why not?

255
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,918
After starting grad school last year,

256
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:57,488
we went out for drinks with our professor on Teachers' Day.

257
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,328
And he was a huge drinker,

258
00:14:00,888 --> 00:14:02,158
but I was the only one left standing.

259
00:14:02,698 --> 00:14:04,458
So how much did you drink?

260
00:14:06,628 --> 00:14:07,728
Like, a bottle of wine?

261
00:14:12,938 --> 00:14:14,738
(Delicious food has zero calories.)

262
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,438
All right, we're done eating. Let's head in.

263
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:20,778
But wait. Mom is still at the foundation.

264
00:14:27,048 --> 00:14:28,148
Come on.

265
00:14:29,788 --> 00:14:30,788
Fine.

266
00:14:33,128 --> 00:14:34,488
I'm so happy.

267
00:14:34,928 --> 00:14:36,158
So this is what it feels like.

268
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:39,368
Hey, you call this happiness?

269
00:14:57,548 --> 00:15:00,518
This is my favourite song.

270
00:15:12,698 --> 00:15:14,028
It's a nice song.

Eun Oh, hold my hand.

273
00:15:56,838 --> 00:15:58,078
I'm shaking all over.

274
00:15:59,748 --> 00:16:00,808
Did you make this or something?

275
00:16:01,148 --> 00:16:03,718
Why are you so nervous? They're not judging your food.

276
00:16:05,648 --> 00:16:06,688
It's pretty good.

277
00:16:14,088 --> 00:16:15,158
- Come here. - Mother.

278
00:16:16,088 --> 00:16:18,198
What's all this about?

279
00:16:20,598 --> 00:16:21,598
My dear.

280
00:16:22,968 --> 00:16:25,938
I'm talking about your father.

281
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:30,438
Let's have him move in here and live with us.

282
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:32,278
What?

283
00:16:33,578 --> 00:16:35,248
Now that I think about it,

284
00:16:36,108 --> 00:16:37,418
it's just too...

285
00:16:38,148 --> 00:16:42,418
What's the word? Unfair. Yes, it's so unfair.

286
00:16:44,158 --> 00:16:45,958
Using your father-in-law's illness as an excuse,

287
00:16:46,118 --> 00:16:49,498
I've been living with you all for over 15 years.

288
00:16:50,658 --> 00:16:54,998
I get to live with my son, daughter-in-law, and grandchildren,

289
00:16:55,998 --> 00:17:00,808
so it makes no sense for your father to be living all alone.

290
00:17:01,408 --> 00:17:02,408
But, Mother...

291
00:17:03,038 --> 00:17:06,078
Where would my father even stay?

292
00:17:06,848 --> 00:17:08,878
He can have my room.

293
00:17:09,248 --> 00:17:11,148
I'll share a room with Su Bin.

294
00:17:12,988 --> 00:17:15,448
Su Bin's hardly ever home anyway,

295
00:17:16,088 --> 00:17:19,488
and I'm out during the day for my part-time job.

296
00:17:20,828 --> 00:17:24,228
Mother, how could you even think of that?

297
00:17:24,828 --> 00:17:27,698
It's just the right thing to do.

298
00:17:28,968 --> 00:17:31,238
I even thought about moving out myself.

299
00:17:31,568 --> 00:17:33,068
You know, to switch places with him.

300
00:17:34,108 --> 00:17:36,908
But you wouldn't let that happen, would you?

301
00:17:38,578 --> 00:17:40,808
So let's all just live together.

302
00:17:43,448 --> 00:17:46,618
This is all happening because your father and I...

303
00:17:46,748 --> 00:17:49,818
didn't pass on when we should have.

304
00:17:52,758 --> 00:17:54,688
Let me think about it, Mother.

305
00:17:58,898 --> 00:18:02,128
I really appreciate you saying that.

306
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:06,808
Come on. There's nothing to thank me for.

307
00:18:16,248 --> 00:18:17,278
Dad.

308
00:18:17,678 --> 00:18:18,678
Hey.

309
00:18:18,978 --> 00:18:20,818
What brings you here?

310
00:18:21,688 --> 00:18:23,818
Dad, we need to talk.

311
00:18:25,718 --> 00:18:26,958
Oh, no. This can't be good.

312
00:18:27,528 --> 00:18:28,658
This is not good.

313
00:18:29,728 --> 00:18:31,858
What is it? What's this about?

314
00:18:32,698 --> 00:18:36,498
You haven't told Mom, have you? About me trying to acquire AP Group.

315
00:18:37,568 --> 00:18:38,938
Is that what this is about?

316
00:18:39,498 --> 00:18:42,308
Yes. I was hoping you hadn't told the family...

317
00:18:43,478 --> 00:18:45,278
Wait, have you already told them?

318
00:18:46,278 --> 00:18:49,078
Come on, it's not like it's a huge secret.

319
00:18:49,478 --> 00:18:52,848
Whether it works out or not, the family deserves to know.

320
00:18:53,788 --> 00:18:55,348
But they'll just worry if they know.

321
00:18:56,148 --> 00:18:58,018
Then why do something that makes us worry?

322
00:18:59,188 --> 00:19:01,188
Whether it's cause for worry, or a good thing,

323
00:19:01,588 --> 00:19:02,688
we just don't know yet.

324
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:04,458
What?

325
00:19:05,258 --> 00:19:06,628
This might not work out.

326
00:19:07,368 --> 00:19:10,138
If this doesn't work, I'm the one who has to fix it and live with it.

327
00:19:10,568 --> 00:19:14,768
Why tell everyone so they'll worry? This is my burden to bear.

328
00:19:15,268 --> 00:19:16,378
Your burden to bear?

329
00:19:16,978 --> 00:19:18,578
Yes. It's mine.

330
00:19:19,508 --> 00:19:23,278
So, is there nothing I can do to help?

331
00:19:23,348 --> 00:19:24,848
Acquiring a company like that...

332
00:19:24,848 --> 00:19:26,848
It costs a fortune, you know.

333
00:19:27,348 --> 00:19:29,388
It's fine. It's going well.

334
00:19:35,528 --> 00:19:37,798
I swear... Unbelievable.

335
00:19:38,758 --> 00:19:39,968
"It's going well?" So, that's it?

336
00:19:40,668 --> 00:19:44,138
How dare he try to boss me around? I taught him better than that.

337
00:19:44,298 --> 00:19:45,338
What a brat.

338
00:19:45,538 --> 00:19:48,268
I'd take him to the bathhouse as a kid and scrub his back.

339
00:19:48,338 --> 00:19:50,908
And I'd tell him, "A man has to be tight-lipped."

340
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:54,548
"Even when things get tough, you don't run to Mom or Grandma."

341
00:19:54,678 --> 00:19:56,578
I'm the one who taught him that.

342
00:19:56,978 --> 00:19:58,378
And now, with something this important,

343
00:19:58,378 --> 00:20:00,188
he's gagging me because he's afraid I'll talk?

344
00:20:00,848 --> 00:20:03,358
That rotten kid! The nerve of him.

345
00:20:03,888 --> 00:20:05,618
How dare he try to gag me? That little...

346
00:20:10,328 --> 00:20:11,798
You're not on the phone?

347
00:20:12,698 --> 00:20:14,698
Why are you arguing with yourself?

348
00:20:15,698 --> 00:20:16,968
It's nothing.

349
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:26,708
It's done.

350
00:20:26,978 --> 00:20:29,718
- Done! - Dad!

351
00:20:29,718 --> 00:20:31,078
- What? What is it? - Dad.

352
00:20:31,518 --> 00:20:33,688
I heard his acquisition failed.

353
00:20:34,218 --> 00:20:35,218
What?

354
00:20:35,648 --> 00:20:36,688
It failed?

355
00:20:36,688 --> 00:20:39,188
Ji Hyuk's company went bankrupt because of it!

356
00:20:39,288 --> 00:20:40,928
- What? - What do we do now?

357
00:20:40,988 --> 00:20:44,058
No, Ji Hyuk...

358
00:20:44,498 --> 00:20:45,498
Ji Hyuk!

359
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:47,498
No, Ji Hyuk. No.

360
00:20:47,868 --> 00:20:50,368
- No, Ji Hyuk... - Honey.

361
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:53,338
Honey, Ji Hyuk...

362
00:20:54,338 --> 00:20:58,238
What dream had you calling Ji Hyuk and yelling, "No?"

363
00:20:59,778 --> 00:21:02,378
It was nothing. Just a stupid nightmare.

364
00:21:11,718 --> 00:21:13,428
We are at the due diligence stage, Mr. Lee.

365
00:21:14,088 --> 00:21:16,058
- Let's head in. - Yes.

366
00:21:17,298 --> 00:21:19,798
For the past 30 years, AP Group...

367
00:21:20,068 --> 00:21:22,768
has steadily built its expertise and technological prowess.

368
00:21:23,568 --> 00:21:25,968
We are seeking a new leader to uphold AP's spirit and vision...

369
00:21:26,168 --> 00:21:29,408
and guide the company in step with the changing times.

370
00:21:34,348 --> 00:21:36,578
Hong Jong Chan, CEO of Yeongsin Paper.

371
00:21:36,948 --> 00:21:41,148
With the current economic downturn, it seems AP's growth has stalled.

372
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:44,788
- Is it the real reason for selling? - As you all know, this sale...

373
00:21:45,058 --> 00:21:47,358
is due to a lack of a clear successor.

374
00:21:47,828 --> 00:21:49,358
It has nothing to do with our business performance.

375
00:21:51,998 --> 00:21:54,868
- Yes, go ahead. - Lee Ji Hyuk, CEO of Mamdaerozip.

376
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:57,698
You mentioned a transition from B2B to B2C.

377
00:21:57,898 --> 00:22:01,338
Are you developing any services for direct consumer engagement?

378
00:22:01,568 --> 00:22:04,678
Yes. We have several projects underway.

379
00:22:05,308 --> 00:22:06,908
Our online division is partially...

380
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:11,978
- It's pretty heated, isn't it? - Yes, more intense than I thought.

381
00:22:12,318 --> 00:22:14,748
Gosh, he's just a kid.

382
00:22:17,118 --> 00:22:18,758
Did they just let him in for the experience?

383
00:22:19,618 --> 00:22:21,328
AP just got his hopes up for nothing.

384
00:22:24,298 --> 00:22:26,428
- Let's go, Mr. Lee. - Yes.

385
00:22:26,528 --> 00:22:28,828
Oh, Mr. Lee Ji Hyuk, the CEO of Mamdaerozip.

386
00:22:29,528 --> 00:22:32,738
Thanks to you, this bidding war just got a lot more entertaining.

387
00:22:33,608 --> 00:22:36,268
- I'm glad you're enjoying it. - Yes, but...

388
00:22:36,738 --> 00:22:39,378
Seriously, do you even have the money for this?

389
00:22:40,608 --> 00:22:43,008
Your company is still so new.

390
00:22:43,818 --> 00:22:45,078
The only difference is on paper.

391
00:22:52,388 --> 00:22:54,688
What I don't get is AP.

392
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:57,258
They should've picked a company with actual financial backing.

393
00:22:57,858 --> 00:22:59,728
He says the only difference is on paper.

394
00:22:59,828 --> 00:23:02,698
Hey, I hear Boyang Construction is backing him.

395
00:23:04,598 --> 00:23:05,798
Boyang Construction?

396
00:23:05,898 --> 00:23:10,138
They say Boyang Construction invested ten million dollars.

399
00:23:19,178 --> 00:23:20,488
This might not work out.

400
00:23:21,318 --> 00:23:24,058
If this doesn't work, I'm the one who has to fix it and live with it.

401
00:23:24,518 --> 00:23:27,588
Why tell everyone so they'll worry? This is my burden to bear.

402
00:23:28,088 --> 00:23:30,458
Yes, right. There's no way he can pull it off.

403
00:23:30,898 --> 00:23:35,098
He thinks he can raise the money to buy that huge company by himself?

404
00:23:35,798 --> 00:23:36,798
Goodness.

405
00:23:37,098 --> 00:23:39,268
Even when he's struggling, he can't ask for help...

406
00:23:40,268 --> 00:23:41,438
Gosh, this is so frustrating.

408
00:23:50,578 --> 00:23:53,518
That's right. He has parents.

409
00:23:54,388 --> 00:23:56,958
Come on, kid. You've got a father.

410
00:24:02,188 --> 00:24:06,228
So, I should just help the customers try it out when they come in, right?

411
00:24:06,258 --> 00:24:09,938
Yes, it's important for them to experience our products directly.

412
00:24:10,768 --> 00:24:13,868
Let me show you how to use this heated mat.

413
00:24:14,008 --> 00:24:16,678
Hold on. Let me just jot this down in the notes app...

414
00:24:17,538 --> 00:24:19,178
Just a second.

415
00:24:22,808 --> 00:24:23,948
Honey? What is it?

416
00:24:24,518 --> 00:24:29,048
I wasn't well, so I came home early, but you weren't here.

417
00:24:29,688 --> 00:24:32,488
I'm just out with a friend nearby.

418
00:24:33,188 --> 00:24:34,588
Are you feeling really sick?

419
00:24:35,288 --> 00:24:38,098
Oh, no. It's just a little indigestion.

420
00:24:38,198 --> 00:24:40,998
Don't rush back on my account. Stay and have fun. Okay?

421
00:24:49,538 --> 00:24:53,678
I'm sorry. We can't approve a home equity loan.

422
00:24:53,748 --> 00:24:56,348
You're currently unemployed and have other outstanding loans.

423
00:24:57,378 --> 00:25:00,348
That's ridiculous! I need the money now.

424
00:25:00,448 --> 00:25:03,048
Why can't I get a loan against my own house?

Wait, Da Jeong?

429
00:25:22,768 --> 00:25:23,778
It's been a while.

430
00:25:24,178 --> 00:25:25,178
Da Jeong!

431
00:25:25,778 --> 00:25:28,378
We live in the same neighbourhood, but I haven't seen you in ages.

432
00:25:28,578 --> 00:25:30,918
I came to see Sin Yeong today.

433
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:33,418
Something must be wrong at home.

434
00:25:33,888 --> 00:25:35,688
Can you have a beer with me?

435
00:25:36,488 --> 00:25:38,458
About me being here today...

436
00:25:38,518 --> 00:25:41,628
Right. Not a word to Sang Cheol. It's a secret.

437
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,188
Here, have a seat.

- Depression is common in seniors. - The truth is, all this time,

439
00:25:55,468 --> 00:25:57,608
a part of me resented him.

440
00:25:58,538 --> 00:26:03,148
My father-in-law had a boat accident after Ji Hyuk's first birthday.

441
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:08,048
After that, he couldn't keep a job and just started drinking.

442
00:26:08,888 --> 00:26:11,718
My mother-in-law had to care for him and earn all the money.

443
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,728
Lung damage, pleurisy,

444
00:26:14,988 --> 00:26:17,898
high blood pressure, diabetes, a heart attack,

445
00:26:18,758 --> 00:26:21,168
and then kidney cancer on top of it all.

446
00:26:21,728 --> 00:26:24,068
He suffered from one awful illness after another.

447
00:26:24,898 --> 00:26:26,238
He did.

448
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:30,008
He moved in when Ji Hyuk was a high school freshman, remember?

449
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:35,578
But my father also quit his job to care for my mom with dementia.

450
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:37,618
He cared for her for over ten years.

451
00:26:40,548 --> 00:26:43,088
And it's already been 11 years since she passed away.

452
00:26:47,828 --> 00:26:49,728
He's lived alone for all 11 of those years.

453
00:26:50,428 --> 00:26:51,498
My dad.

454
00:26:52,298 --> 00:26:53,898
I know, of course.

455
00:26:54,398 --> 00:26:58,768
My mom lived alone for over 20 years before she passed away too.

456
00:27:00,838 --> 00:27:03,008
But I really wish my dad...

457
00:27:03,838 --> 00:27:06,848
would go live with my sibling in the US.

458
00:27:07,148 --> 00:27:08,748
Then,

459
00:27:09,108 --> 00:27:11,848
you should call your sibling first, Da Jeong.

460
00:27:12,118 --> 00:27:16,818
And if they say no, do as she said and take him in.

461
00:27:17,458 --> 00:27:21,428
They're both almost 90, and they're no strangers.

462
00:27:21,488 --> 00:27:25,328
Nowadays, men and women can just be friends, you know?

463
00:27:26,998 --> 00:27:29,328
I've already been thinking about it,

464
00:27:30,698 --> 00:27:32,838
but I'm too scared of being rejected to ask.

465
00:27:34,208 --> 00:27:36,508
And I'm so furious with Gyeong Hun.

466
00:27:38,578 --> 00:27:42,708
My husband's situation is so bad. Until he finds a new job...

467
00:27:42,778 --> 00:27:45,018
Come on, Sang Cheol is not that kind of guy.

468
00:27:45,448 --> 00:27:46,948
He's just having trouble finding a job.

469
00:27:46,948 --> 00:27:48,948
It's the same for most men his age.

470
00:27:49,518 --> 00:27:53,858
He's just being stubborn, acting tough and trying to provide.

471
00:27:54,388 --> 00:27:57,328
If you tell him, he'll understand immediately.

472
00:27:57,658 --> 00:28:00,128
He'll get on his knees and say sorry, if anything.

473
00:28:00,468 --> 00:28:03,698
Of course, I know how Sang Cheol is.

474
00:28:10,038 --> 00:28:11,208
Ms. Kim, come in.

475
00:28:19,778 --> 00:28:21,148
Which one would you like to go with?

476
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:28,288
This one already has the highest final score.

477
00:28:28,788 --> 00:28:30,758
And if you had to pick another one?

478
00:28:33,598 --> 00:28:36,698
I apologise. The executives did the scoring.

479
00:28:38,038 --> 00:28:39,768
All right, I understand. You may go.

480
00:28:46,708 --> 00:28:49,748
Su Bin would know best about this stuff.

481
00:29:06,528 --> 00:29:07,628
Isn't that Su Bin?

482
00:29:11,368 --> 00:29:12,768
What am I thinking? It's not Su Bin.

483
00:29:17,838 --> 00:29:18,838
I'm cold.

484
00:29:20,608 --> 00:29:23,008
I'm hungry and thirsty.

485
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:25,578
Maybe I should've brought some water and food.

486
00:29:26,718 --> 00:29:29,048
What, pack a lunch and water to stage a sit-in?

487
00:29:29,748 --> 00:29:32,218
You're too scared to be seen to even face forward.

488
00:29:55,248 --> 00:29:56,408
Oh, man.

489
00:29:57,948 --> 00:30:00,148
Sir, are you all right?

490
00:30:02,418 --> 00:30:04,658
Why is it so dark in here? Did the power go out?

491
00:30:05,118 --> 00:30:06,288
No, sir.

492
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:10,758
There was no light under the door. I was worried you'd collapsed.

493
00:30:11,398 --> 00:30:14,298
Wow, I lost all track of time. Go on. Head home now.

494
00:30:14,698 --> 00:30:15,698
Bye.

495
00:30:48,528 --> 00:30:49,828

496
00:30:59,508 --> 00:31:00,908
It's cold.

497
00:31:01,348 --> 00:31:02,578
Let's go, Su Bin.

498
00:31:03,148 --> 00:31:05,378
What am I even doing here?

499
00:31:07,288 --> 00:31:08,388
(Seong Jae)

500
00:31:14,158 --> 00:31:15,228
Yes, hello?

501
00:31:15,288 --> 00:31:17,458
Lee Su Bin, come on up.

502
00:31:18,128 --> 00:31:20,128
You knew I was down here?

503
00:31:20,258 --> 00:31:22,168
If you're not coming up, I'm leaving for the night.

504
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:23,668
Okay, I'm on my way.

505
00:31:29,108 --> 00:31:31,008
I can't believe he told me to come up.

506
00:31:34,908 --> 00:31:37,948
Still, it was worth it. I get to see his face.

507
00:31:38,678 --> 00:31:41,118
(Shoealls)

508
00:31:44,458 --> 00:31:45,558
Come in.

509
00:31:54,698 --> 00:31:55,768
Sit.

510
00:32:00,738 --> 00:32:03,908
Why were you waiting outside? Are you staging a protest?

511
00:32:06,408 --> 00:32:08,478
Then why did you tell me to come up?

512
00:32:10,448 --> 00:32:13,548
But how did you know it was me? You couldn't have seen my face.

513
00:32:13,718 --> 00:32:16,118
It was written on top of your head. It said, "Lee Su Bin."

514
00:32:16,218 --> 00:32:17,288
What are you talking about?

515
00:32:17,288 --> 00:32:19,658
I don't know how long you were out,

516
00:32:19,658 --> 00:32:21,628
and don't care if you waited all day.

517
00:32:21,688 --> 00:32:25,298
But I have to know the reason because you can't do that again.

518
00:32:25,658 --> 00:32:29,098
Were you waiting for me to notice and call you up here like this?

519
00:32:29,298 --> 00:32:31,198
No, that's not it at all.

520
00:32:32,098 --> 00:32:34,508
I was sitting with my back turned because I was afraid you'd see me.

521
00:32:37,738 --> 00:32:39,208
I don't even know.

522
00:32:39,508 --> 00:32:41,778
I don't know why I was sitting there like that.

523
00:32:42,678 --> 00:32:43,678
What?

524
00:32:45,148 --> 00:32:47,248
I didn't know what I should do.

525
00:32:47,848 --> 00:32:51,718
I felt I had to do something, but I didn't know what, so I waited.

526
00:32:54,288 --> 00:32:55,688
Anyway, I...

527
00:32:56,988 --> 00:32:58,228
This time, it's for real.

528
00:33:01,168 --> 00:33:02,728
I really like you.

529
00:33:05,738 --> 00:33:07,098
That's not my problem.

530
00:33:09,208 --> 00:33:12,878
Then why did you tell me to come up? And how did you recognise my head?

531
00:33:13,078 --> 00:33:14,948
Before our product's final meeting,

532
00:33:14,948 --> 00:33:16,748
I needed feedback from people your age.

533
00:33:16,808 --> 00:33:19,978
That's when I happened to see you. That's why I asked you to come up.

534
00:33:20,588 --> 00:33:22,718
Really? Is that all it was?

535
00:33:22,788 --> 00:33:25,218
If I hadn't needed your help, I wouldn't have called you.

536
00:33:25,388 --> 00:33:28,788
I know how stubborn you are. Calling you is like...

537
00:33:28,988 --> 00:33:30,698
asking for trouble. My gosh.

538
00:33:31,858 --> 00:33:34,098
You sound like a completely different person.

539
00:33:36,628 --> 00:33:38,568
If you go back to being Ji Hyuk's little sister,

540
00:33:38,938 --> 00:33:40,908
I can go back to being the nice guy you remember.

541
00:33:45,578 --> 00:33:48,348
Okay, I get it. So what do you need my help with?

542
00:33:48,448 --> 00:33:51,118
It must be something important if you called me up here, right?

543
00:33:51,218 --> 00:33:52,418
So tell me what it is.

544
00:33:54,348 --> 00:33:57,088
You still see your high school friends, right?

545
00:33:57,088 --> 00:33:58,818
The ones I used to buy snacks for.

546
00:33:58,888 --> 00:34:01,188
Get them, Ha Eun, and yourself together,

547
00:34:01,388 --> 00:34:03,128
take a vote, and let me know...

548
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:06,198
which one of these two you'd buy.

549
00:34:07,298 --> 00:34:09,928
All right, I'll do it. And I'll keep it top secret.

550
00:34:10,198 --> 00:34:13,438
This can't leak before the launch. It's strictly confidential.

551
00:34:13,568 --> 00:34:16,568
- I'll pay you for your time. - Forget the pay.

552
00:34:17,278 --> 00:34:18,738
You can help me with something.

553
00:34:20,678 --> 00:34:22,148
What now?

554
00:34:22,478 --> 00:34:24,118
Instead of paying me,

555
00:34:26,978 --> 00:34:28,788
just go on three dates with me.

556
00:34:29,118 --> 00:34:30,188
Hey, Lee Su Bin.

557
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,388
Just three times. That's all it takes...

558
00:34:32,458 --> 00:34:36,028
to see if there's something between us. For both of us.

559
00:34:36,088 --> 00:34:37,228
No.

560
00:34:37,798 --> 00:34:39,098
You know it too.

561
00:34:39,728 --> 00:34:41,498
That my feelings for you are real this time.

562
00:34:43,938 --> 00:34:44,938
And...

563
00:34:46,068 --> 00:34:47,568
I can't just give up.

564
00:34:49,808 --> 00:34:52,578
Like I've said before, this is something I just can't hide.

565
00:34:56,008 --> 00:34:59,578
Three things can't be hidden. Love, poverty, and a sneeze.

566
00:35:00,948 --> 00:35:02,348
For old times' sake.

567
00:35:02,788 --> 00:35:04,888
I'll give up if you still won't budge,

568
00:35:04,888 --> 00:35:07,218
even after I've tried my best.

569
00:35:08,328 --> 00:35:09,388
What is wrong with you?

570
00:35:09,728 --> 00:35:12,528
Just 3 times. Is going on 3 dates...

571
00:35:13,498 --> 00:35:14,498
really that hard?

572
00:35:23,868 --> 00:35:24,878
Fine.

573
00:35:26,938 --> 00:35:28,648
Here, go home now.

574
00:35:32,018 --> 00:35:33,018
You said, "Fine?"

575
00:35:33,748 --> 00:35:35,018
You mean you'll go on three dates with me?

576
00:35:35,518 --> 00:35:38,358
Three times. Just three. That's it.

577
00:35:39,618 --> 00:35:40,628
Got it.

578
00:35:43,628 --> 00:35:45,358
I'm hungry.

579
00:35:46,198 --> 00:35:47,228
Wait, you mean you haven't eaten yet?

580
00:35:50,228 --> 00:35:51,598
Hurry home and get something to eat.

581
00:35:52,968 --> 00:35:55,538
- Are you going to take me home? - That'll count as one date.

582
00:35:56,808 --> 00:35:58,478
Fine. I'll go by myself.

583
00:36:00,508 --> 00:36:03,078
(Shoealls)

584
00:36:20,058 --> 00:36:21,328
Why did it have to be me?

585
00:36:22,068 --> 00:36:23,328
This really can't happen.

586
00:36:23,998 --> 00:36:24,998
I just can't.

587
00:36:30,208 --> 00:36:31,208
Oh, boy.

588
00:36:32,238 --> 00:36:34,478
It smells like pine mushrooms.

589
00:36:35,508 --> 00:36:38,018
- The weather's getting chilly. - Right.

590
00:36:38,178 --> 00:36:40,278
- Here you go, honey. - Thanks.

591
00:36:41,248 --> 00:36:45,458
I haven't caught a cold in over ten years, thanks to you.

592
00:36:49,458 --> 00:36:51,128
What do you think of this young lady?

593
00:36:52,858 --> 00:36:55,768
Her father is the Dean of Humanities at Seongmun University,

594
00:36:56,168 --> 00:36:58,638
and her uncle is an elementary school principal.

595
00:36:59,098 --> 00:37:01,868
She majored in cello and is preparing for a solo recital.

596
00:37:02,108 --> 00:37:03,568
And she's 27.

597
00:37:04,708 --> 00:37:07,308
Are there any other candidates?

598
00:37:08,908 --> 00:37:10,848
She's the best we're going to get, honey.

599
00:37:12,078 --> 00:37:16,088
Honestly, I've been quietly asking around everywhere.

600
00:37:16,788 --> 00:37:18,588
But the rumours about our Seong Jae...

601
00:37:20,288 --> 00:37:22,958
But at least it's a family of educators.

602
00:37:23,988 --> 00:37:28,298
The others weren't good-looking, or their character was questionable.

603
00:37:28,398 --> 00:37:29,768
Or their family background...

604
00:37:31,138 --> 00:37:34,468
And most importantly, Seong Jae has no interest in dating.

605
00:37:35,638 --> 00:37:38,638
So we just need to get him to start meeting someone.

606
00:37:39,978 --> 00:37:44,718
This young lady is so beautiful. Won't he meet her after seeing this?

607
00:37:46,548 --> 00:37:49,288
What kind of man isn't into women?

608
00:37:51,958 --> 00:37:53,758
He takes after you.

609
00:37:54,488 --> 00:37:58,398
You never gave other women a glance until you met me, right?

610
00:38:03,328 --> 00:38:06,738
Don't just pick one at first glance. Think it over tonight,

611
00:38:06,838 --> 00:38:08,838
imagine how you'd style it,

612
00:38:08,838 --> 00:38:10,668
and text me again with your reasoning.

613
00:38:24,318 --> 00:38:26,488
- What brings you here? - I came to give you this.

614
00:38:27,418 --> 00:38:29,228
Talk to your mother and set up a date.

615
00:38:32,398 --> 00:38:33,398
Father.

616
00:38:34,098 --> 00:38:35,098
What?

617
00:38:35,498 --> 00:38:36,668
Are you seeing anyone these days?

618
00:38:38,598 --> 00:38:39,598
No.

619
00:38:40,638 --> 00:38:42,608
I told you to find someone this year.

620
00:38:42,608 --> 00:38:44,808
Otherwise, you'll marry the person I choose.

621
00:38:47,778 --> 00:38:49,008
I'm giving you until the end of the year.

622
00:38:49,448 --> 00:38:53,078
If you can't find someone by then, that's on you for not being capable.

623
00:38:54,118 --> 00:38:57,018
In that case, you'll marry whomever we choose for you.

624
00:38:58,588 --> 00:39:00,258
I'm not thinking about marriage yet.

625
00:39:01,588 --> 00:39:02,588
Whenever that may be,

626
00:39:03,328 --> 00:39:05,128
when I find someone I truly want to marry,

627
00:39:05,398 --> 00:39:06,428
I'll get married then, Father.

628
00:39:07,898 --> 00:39:09,598
You are the heir to this company.

629
00:39:10,398 --> 00:39:12,568
Don't you know you have to get married and have children?

630
00:39:13,138 --> 00:39:15,138
You failed at your first marriage, too.

631
00:39:16,168 --> 00:39:17,538
Why are you pushing marriage on me so hard?

632
00:39:19,708 --> 00:39:21,048
I failed the first time,

633
00:39:21,348 --> 00:39:22,978
but I succeeded the second time.

634
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:26,118
Are you just going to give up after one failure?

635
00:39:27,918 --> 00:39:29,418
If I ever get married again,

636
00:39:30,518 --> 00:39:32,658
it will be with someone I truly want to be with.

637
00:39:33,918 --> 00:39:36,888
What about the first time? Didn't you marry the one you wanted?

638
00:39:38,828 --> 00:39:41,168
It was you who forced that marriage to end, Father.

639
00:39:46,698 --> 00:39:48,168
When I find the right person,

640
00:39:48,638 --> 00:39:49,868
I'll get married then, Father.

641
00:39:50,368 --> 00:39:53,108
No, she has to be a suitable woman.

642
00:39:53,738 --> 00:39:56,108
Your first marriage. Did you get our permission?

643
00:39:56,878 --> 00:39:59,678
You two hid like rats and got married in secret.

644
00:40:00,988 --> 00:40:04,858
If you'd married someone suitable, I wouldn't have torn you apart.

645
00:40:05,918 --> 00:40:08,488
How dare you add a loan shark's girl to our family register?

646
00:40:09,488 --> 00:40:11,128
And on an impulse, at 23.

647
00:40:14,098 --> 00:40:17,368
Can you prove she isn't a gold digger who targeted you?

648
00:40:18,298 --> 00:40:19,298
That marriage...

649
00:40:20,138 --> 00:40:21,738
was an act of rebellion, you fool.

650
00:40:27,848 --> 00:40:28,908
Then what about this woman?

651
00:40:30,148 --> 00:40:33,178
Is she worthy of our family?

652
00:40:34,718 --> 00:40:38,188
So if she's "worthy" of our family, I'm supposed to marry just anyone?

653
00:40:38,658 --> 00:40:41,558
Your mother vetted her thoroughly.

654
00:40:41,758 --> 00:40:44,158
So if Mother vetted her, that makes her a decent person?

655
00:40:46,328 --> 00:40:47,328
I trust that she is.

656
00:40:48,398 --> 00:40:49,768
If it's someone your mother vetted,

657
00:40:50,298 --> 00:40:51,298
she'll be just like her.

658
00:40:52,798 --> 00:40:53,998
How can you be so sure?

659
00:40:55,438 --> 00:40:58,338
You always said Mother was different from my birth mother.

660
00:40:58,838 --> 00:41:01,248
That she's a completely different kind of person.

661
00:41:04,818 --> 00:41:05,818
That's right. And since you're...

662
00:41:06,548 --> 00:41:08,948
old enough to be a father now, I'll tell you this.

663
00:41:10,448 --> 00:41:11,458
That woman...

664
00:41:12,188 --> 00:41:14,858
is someone who knows how to love a child fiercely.

665
00:41:15,888 --> 00:41:18,228
And that's why I can love her with all my heart.

666
00:41:26,398 --> 00:41:27,398
That's unexpected.

667
00:41:28,868 --> 00:41:30,808
That you remarried for love...

668
00:41:31,778 --> 00:41:32,908
I never knew.

669
00:41:34,508 --> 00:41:37,478
What made me fall for her was her maternal instinct.

670
00:41:38,518 --> 00:41:40,718
I didn't see her as a woman first, but as a mother.

671
00:41:42,648 --> 00:41:45,858
Her heartbreaking maternal love is what I saw first.

672
00:41:47,458 --> 00:41:50,258
(Winter, 1998)

673
00:41:51,428 --> 00:41:52,698
The traffic is terrible.

674
00:41:53,458 --> 00:41:54,968
We're going to be late for our appointment.

675
00:41:56,998 --> 00:42:00,398
- There must be an accident. - Yes.

676
00:42:03,208 --> 00:42:04,608
Excuse me! Taxi!

677
00:42:05,638 --> 00:42:06,638
- What? - Wait.

678
00:42:06,708 --> 00:42:09,208
Wait! Please, just one second! Wait!

679
00:42:09,708 --> 00:42:10,708
- No! - What's going on?

680
00:42:11,818 --> 00:42:13,778
My son is sick!

681
00:42:14,148 --> 00:42:17,218
We have to get to the hospital! Please, let me get a cab!

682
00:42:17,688 --> 00:42:19,418
My son is dying!

683
00:42:19,718 --> 00:42:23,228
- Mr. Kim, let's give her a ride. - Yes, sir.

684
00:42:26,858 --> 00:42:28,998
Ma'am! Over here.

685
00:42:29,298 --> 00:42:31,098
- Please get in. - What?

686
00:42:31,168 --> 00:42:32,168
We'll give you a ride.

687
00:42:33,638 --> 00:42:34,638
Okay.

688
00:42:34,908 --> 00:42:35,908
- You can get in the back. - Yes.

689
00:42:35,968 --> 00:42:38,238
Thank you. Thank you so much.

690
00:42:41,548 --> 00:42:42,548
Thank you.

691
00:42:44,418 --> 00:42:45,418
Where are you headed?

692
00:42:46,018 --> 00:42:47,348
Yongjin Hospital, Paediatrics.

693
00:43:24,788 --> 00:43:28,028
(Yongjin Hospital)

694
00:43:31,428 --> 00:43:32,428
Thank you so much.

695
00:43:32,728 --> 00:43:33,758
Thank you.

696
00:43:44,208 --> 00:43:45,338
I wonder what's wrong with him.

697
00:43:45,978 --> 00:43:47,578
She must be an acquaintance of yours, sir.

698
00:43:49,778 --> 00:43:52,518
I've seen her around, but I wouldn't say we're acquainted.

699
00:43:54,648 --> 00:43:58,888
Yes, Doctor. I won't just make good enough shoes.

700
00:44:01,258 --> 00:44:03,758
I want to create shoes with real, high-performance features.

701
00:44:04,528 --> 00:44:07,798
- My gosh. - You must have caught a cold.

702
00:44:09,128 --> 00:44:10,128
Oh, please.

703
00:44:10,498 --> 00:44:11,498
If this is a cold,

704
00:44:11,938 --> 00:44:13,598
then I guess no second round tonight, Doctor.

705
00:44:18,038 --> 00:44:22,278
This is homemade ginger tea. It's great for a cold.

706
00:44:22,908 --> 00:44:25,548
Wait. How did you know to prepare this?

707
00:44:27,278 --> 00:44:30,748
I noticed he was coughing a bit when he was here three days ago.

708
00:44:32,918 --> 00:44:34,458
Is this your way of saying thank you for the other day?

709
00:44:35,758 --> 00:44:36,758
I'm sorry?

710
00:44:37,128 --> 00:44:38,358
I'm not sure what you mean.

711
00:44:39,458 --> 00:44:42,368
I gave you a ride to the hospital. On that snowy day.

712
00:44:43,528 --> 00:44:44,538
My goodness.

713
00:44:45,138 --> 00:44:46,138
Oh, gosh.

714
00:44:46,638 --> 00:44:47,738
That was you, sir?

715
00:44:48,208 --> 00:44:49,768
I'm so sorry.

716
00:44:50,238 --> 00:44:52,938
I was in such a panic that day. I don't think I even saw your face.

717
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:54,608
I'm truly sorry.

718
00:44:55,778 --> 00:44:57,478
And thank you so much.

719
00:45:00,748 --> 00:45:04,188
She was a server at a restaurant where I was a regular,

720
00:45:04,758 --> 00:45:06,058
but she didn't even recognise me.

721
00:45:07,018 --> 00:45:08,688
Because of Woo Jin's high fever that day,

722
00:45:09,428 --> 00:45:11,198
she was blind to everything else.

723
00:45:12,598 --> 00:45:13,758
It's a homemade syrup.

724
00:45:14,728 --> 00:45:16,768
It's not much, but it's all I have to offer.

725
00:45:17,268 --> 00:45:18,898
I'm so grateful for what you did.

726
00:45:19,968 --> 00:45:23,368
When you get a throat tickle, have a cup of this. It really helps.

727
00:45:33,518 --> 00:45:36,618
It turned out that Woo Jin had an acute fever,

728
00:45:37,218 --> 00:45:39,688
and his temperature was spiking over 40°C.

729
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:42,628
She was on her way to the hospital for his surgery,

730
00:45:44,128 --> 00:45:47,628
so I saw that desperate, heart-wrenching motherly love.

731
00:45:48,428 --> 00:45:50,098
And I saw her true character.

732
00:45:52,538 --> 00:45:55,238
I saw her in a situation that she could have never faked.

733
00:46:00,738 --> 00:46:01,748
I see.

734
00:46:03,508 --> 00:46:04,508
And another thing, son.

735
00:46:05,248 --> 00:46:08,018
You've known her for 26 years yourself.

736
00:46:08,488 --> 00:46:09,488
In all that time,

737
00:46:09,848 --> 00:46:12,258
you've seen how steadfast she is, and you still have to ask?

738
00:46:14,288 --> 00:46:15,288
Yes.

739
00:46:16,058 --> 00:46:17,228
You're right. She has been consistent.

740
00:46:19,058 --> 00:46:22,868
So? Are you finally thinking about settling down with a decent person?

741
00:46:25,468 --> 00:46:28,968
Right now, I just want to focus on the new product launch.

742
00:46:29,908 --> 00:46:32,578
Fine. I'm telling you to think about it after that's done.

743
00:46:35,308 --> 00:46:36,308
I'll see you at the meeting tomorrow.

744
00:46:40,978 --> 00:46:42,748
- Get some rest. - You too.

745
00:46:52,128 --> 00:46:53,958
I wonder if she was different with her own son.

746
00:46:57,328 --> 00:46:58,338
I never saw that side of her.

747
00:47:17,888 --> 00:47:19,718
My friends' verdict? This model, 100 percent.

748
00:47:24,928 --> 00:47:28,128
This one's my pick too. I wore Shoe Joy shoes to work, right?

749
00:47:28,328 --> 00:47:31,228
They were really comfortable, but they weren't for my generation.

750
00:47:31,698 --> 00:47:33,798
But this one? I'd totally wear it.

751
00:47:34,198 --> 00:47:37,038
It goes with jeans, dresses, and more.

752
00:47:37,038 --> 00:47:38,808
I even matched outfits to the photos.

753
00:47:41,878 --> 00:47:43,008
She even matched outfits?

754
00:47:44,308 --> 00:47:46,018
Product number one, which scored the highest,

755
00:47:46,018 --> 00:47:47,748
will be the main item,

756
00:47:48,118 --> 00:47:49,748
and the sporty and casual lines are being produced...

757
00:47:50,218 --> 00:47:51,558
in order of priority.

758
00:47:52,118 --> 00:47:53,118
All right.

759
00:47:58,828 --> 00:47:59,828
Mr. Chairman.

760
00:48:00,928 --> 00:48:04,598
Yes. You had a point to make before we finalized the lineup.

761
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:07,068
Yes. I'd like to...

762
00:48:07,668 --> 00:48:09,838
propose we change the main line to number two.

763
00:48:16,948 --> 00:48:19,018
If our company is going to continue to grow,

764
00:48:19,318 --> 00:48:21,388
attracting a younger customer base has to be our top priority.

765
00:48:22,688 --> 00:48:23,918
Number one is a classic design,

766
00:48:24,248 --> 00:48:26,358
while number two will also appeal to a younger demographic.

767
00:48:26,488 --> 00:48:28,658
So we should alienate our existing customers...

768
00:48:28,658 --> 00:48:30,688
and only target younger people?

769
00:48:31,898 --> 00:48:35,968
When you say "existing customers," do you mean our older clients?

770
00:48:38,368 --> 00:48:40,798
These days, even people in their 50s and 60s care about design.

771
00:48:41,568 --> 00:48:43,668
You can't view people in their 70s and 80s the way you used to.

772
00:48:54,048 --> 00:48:56,088
They're shoe photos from top fashionistas...

773
00:48:56,088 --> 00:48:57,888
in their 50s and 60s in Korea and worldwide,

774
00:48:58,558 --> 00:49:01,588
as well as currently trending shoes among people in their 20s and 30s.

775
00:49:02,128 --> 00:49:03,758
As I'm sure you can all see,

776
00:49:04,328 --> 00:49:06,298
you'll notice there isn't much of a difference.

777
00:49:06,598 --> 00:49:09,328
Young people want comfortable shoes too,

778
00:49:09,328 --> 00:49:11,398
but they also have to be stylish.

779
00:49:12,168 --> 00:49:15,368
I find number two's design to be minimalist,

780
00:49:15,468 --> 00:49:18,478
and the black colour will complement a wide variety of looks,

781
00:49:19,108 --> 00:49:20,978
working well with both casual and formal wear.

782
00:49:23,048 --> 00:49:26,448
Are you saying we ignore the vote, which is one of the company's rules?

783
00:49:28,148 --> 00:49:30,148
Sometimes, you must change the rules to move forward.

784
00:49:32,718 --> 00:49:33,888
I see number two...

785
00:49:34,658 --> 00:49:36,728
as our company's next main product line.

786
00:49:49,708 --> 00:49:50,708
Fine. Go ahead.

787
00:49:52,138 --> 00:49:53,578
As the chief director, you put together a team...

788
00:49:54,008 --> 00:49:56,078
and handle PR, production, and sales strategy.

789
00:49:58,518 --> 00:49:59,518
Thank you, sir.

790
00:50:02,948 --> 00:50:04,148
Eighty-seven percent.

791
00:50:06,518 --> 00:50:08,958
The top contenders are Rumiko and Yeongsin Paper.

792
00:50:09,328 --> 00:50:11,928
If Rumiko gets it, AP Group will be absorbed.

793
00:50:12,098 --> 00:50:14,458
Yeongsin Paper has no experience in this sector.

794
00:50:15,428 --> 00:50:19,338
If we can just get more funding, we'll have a fighting chance.

795
00:50:19,968 --> 00:50:21,568
Either way, when you sell a company, it's all about the money.

796
00:50:22,108 --> 00:50:23,268
Money always comes first.

797
00:50:23,738 --> 00:50:27,538
But a chairman who let his sons live as a doctor and a musician...

798
00:50:27,978 --> 00:50:29,408
might just have a different way of thinking.

799
00:50:30,348 --> 00:50:32,818
We still have four days left. Mr. Hong,

800
00:50:32,948 --> 00:50:35,088
send me the graph of our cumulative investments.

801
00:50:35,788 --> 00:50:38,388
We need to pressure the investors by showing our goal is almost met.

802
00:50:38,488 --> 00:50:39,488
Understood.

803
00:50:40,988 --> 00:50:43,258
By the way, our partner is running late today.

804
00:50:48,198 --> 00:50:50,398
(Ha Sung Guk, Partner at Moment)

805
00:50:51,638 --> 00:50:52,798
Hey, where are you?

806
00:50:52,898 --> 00:50:56,638
Boyang Construction just called. They're pulling their investment.

807
00:50:57,908 --> 00:50:58,908
What?

808
00:50:59,978 --> 00:51:01,708
- Great work, everyone. - Thank you, sir.

809
00:51:01,778 --> 00:51:03,448
- Yes. - Wait!

810
00:51:06,148 --> 00:51:07,148
What is going on?

811
00:51:07,478 --> 00:51:09,448
Is it true you've sided with Yeongsin?

812
00:51:10,318 --> 00:51:14,688
They presented a better offer.

813
00:51:15,228 --> 00:51:16,528
The board made the decision.

814
00:51:17,158 --> 00:51:18,658
I do feel bad for you about this, Mr. Lee.

815
00:51:19,058 --> 00:51:20,058
Wait a minute, Mr. Min.

816
00:51:20,658 --> 00:51:22,998
But you already signed a letter of intent with us.

817
00:51:23,898 --> 00:51:26,338
If you got another offer, you should have told us first.

818
00:51:26,738 --> 00:51:29,968
You haven't signed the contract with Yeongsin yet, right?

819
00:51:32,108 --> 00:51:34,508
Mamdaerozip hasn't secured the acquisition funds,

820
00:51:34,778 --> 00:51:36,408
while Yeongsin has more than enough!

821
00:51:36,908 --> 00:51:38,278
Frankly, in business,

822
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:40,978
you look out for yourself. It's not a charity, is it?

823
00:51:44,588 --> 00:51:46,658
Chalk it up to experience. Got it?

824
00:51:47,558 --> 00:51:48,558
Let's go.

825
00:51:56,368 --> 00:51:57,698
Mr. Lee!

826
00:51:57,928 --> 00:51:59,898
Go through the investor list again.

827
00:52:00,438 --> 00:52:01,738
Even the ones we weeded out at the start.

828
00:52:04,438 --> 00:52:05,478
Snap out of it, Mr. Lee.

829
00:52:09,078 --> 00:52:11,508
Ten million just went up in smoke. We still couldn't meet the price.

830
00:52:12,248 --> 00:52:14,018
There are still four days left until the final bid.

831
00:52:15,918 --> 00:52:16,918
Let's face reality.

832
00:52:18,188 --> 00:52:21,388
It seems Lady Luck isn't on your side this time.

833
00:52:23,658 --> 00:52:24,928
If you feel you can't help me anymore,

834
00:52:26,598 --> 00:52:27,598
I'll understand.

835
00:52:38,638 --> 00:52:40,538
Is there any way we can move up the meeting to today?

836
00:52:41,208 --> 00:52:42,208
I'm sorry.

837
00:52:42,508 --> 00:52:46,918
Your equity ratio is too low, so we have decided not to invest.

838
00:53:05,638 --> 00:53:07,868
Your passion and vision are great.

839
00:53:08,168 --> 00:53:10,838
But when it comes to running a company like AP...

840
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:12,878
With only four days until the bid,

841
00:53:13,438 --> 00:53:14,808
and you've only raised 50 percent of the funds?

842
00:53:15,248 --> 00:53:16,778
We were interested in investing,

843
00:53:17,148 --> 00:53:19,178
but after an internal review, we've decided against it.

844
00:53:52,518 --> 00:53:54,778
I guess Ji Hyuk isn't coming today.

845
00:54:08,158 --> 00:54:09,768
Why are you just standing there?

846
00:54:12,538 --> 00:54:13,598
I'm hungry.

847
00:54:22,278 --> 00:54:24,178
What's wrong?

848
00:54:27,248 --> 00:54:28,548
Will you eat with me?

849
00:54:33,088 --> 00:54:35,088
I'm not really hungry right now.

850
00:54:40,228 --> 00:54:41,328
All right. Never mind.

851
00:54:59,018 --> 00:55:01,018
It's just one meal.

852
00:55:02,488 --> 00:55:03,548
Ji Hyuk.

853
00:55:07,388 --> 00:55:10,288
This is Ji Eun Oh, the head of the turnkey team at Mamdaerozip.

854
00:55:10,958 --> 00:55:13,028
This is the Missing Persons Unit at Yongji Police Station.

855
00:55:13,998 --> 00:55:15,628
Oh, yes.

856
00:55:16,368 --> 00:55:18,868
We found a match for the DNA sample you registered.

857
00:55:22,508 --> 00:55:23,508
Hello? Are you still there?

858
00:55:25,208 --> 00:55:27,108
Yes, and?

859
00:55:28,178 --> 00:55:30,878
The other party is eager to meet as soon as possible.

860
00:55:30,948 --> 00:55:32,048
Are you available tomorrow?

861
00:55:35,548 --> 00:55:36,588
Me?

862
00:55:37,218 --> 00:55:39,458
They're eager to meet me?

863
00:55:47,098 --> 00:55:48,628
She agreed to meet tomorrow.

864
00:55:50,568 --> 00:55:52,568
(Director Ko Seong Hui)

865
00:56:20,228 --> 00:56:22,668
I wasn't abandoned.

866
00:56:24,228 --> 00:56:26,438
I wasn't an abandoned child.

867
00:56:26,798 --> 00:56:28,338
I was lost.

868
00:56:30,708 --> 00:56:33,038
Then why am I crying so much?

869
00:56:34,638 --> 00:56:36,148
I never even once...

870
00:56:36,708 --> 00:56:39,778
thought about wanting to see my birth parents.

871
00:56:42,048 --> 00:56:43,418
But I guess that wasn't true.

872
00:56:45,458 --> 00:56:47,288
I guess I hated the idea because I thought I was abandoned.

873
00:56:48,018 --> 00:56:49,958
I guess I didn't even want to think about it.

874
00:56:51,458 --> 00:56:52,998
Of course.

875
00:56:54,158 --> 00:56:55,398
Of course.

876
00:57:09,508 --> 00:57:10,608
Hey, Ji Hyuk...

877
00:57:57,528 --> 00:58:00,258
(Cheonghwa Bank, Living Expenses)

878
00:58:10,138 --> 00:58:11,708
How could they do that?

879
00:58:12,278 --> 00:58:15,308
- Is Boyang Construction crazy? - The deal fell through anyway.

880
00:58:15,748 --> 00:58:17,048
That's just how it is.

881
00:58:18,178 --> 00:58:20,478
What about Ji Hyuk? Where is he right now?

882
00:58:20,578 --> 00:58:22,148
He just couldn't let it go.

883
00:58:22,588 --> 00:58:24,148
He went to try and sort it out on his own.

884
00:58:25,358 --> 00:58:27,188
He could've at least given me a call.

885
00:58:28,358 --> 00:58:29,958
For the time being, don't answer Ji Hyuk's calls.

886
00:58:30,528 --> 00:58:31,958
He might try to lean on you for help.

887
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:34,298
He's not the type to come asking for help blindly.

888
00:58:34,698 --> 00:58:35,998
Ji Hyuk knows his own limits.

(Chief Director Park Seong Jae)

890
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:42,268
I knew it was a long shot. But it felt like we could get lucky.

891
00:58:43,668 --> 00:58:45,038
All right. Got it.

892
00:58:50,378 --> 00:58:53,818
(Lee Ji Hyuk)

893
00:58:53,948 --> 00:58:57,448
The phone is turned off. Transferring to voicemail.

894
00:58:57,648 --> 00:58:58,818
Please leave a message after the tone.

895
00:59:05,428 --> 00:59:07,028
I wonder what kind of person...

896
00:59:07,728 --> 00:59:09,228
they're expecting to see.

897
00:59:12,038 --> 00:59:14,138
What do you even wear for something like this?

898
00:59:15,908 --> 00:59:19,338
What's taking you so long to pick an outfit today?

899
00:59:19,678 --> 00:59:20,678
What? Oh, I...

900
00:59:21,208 --> 00:59:23,378
I have a client meeting.

901
00:59:24,148 --> 00:59:26,418
I see. It must be a pretty important client.

902
00:59:27,148 --> 00:59:29,718
- Should I help you pick? - No, I'm good.

903
00:59:31,018 --> 00:59:32,018
Here.

904
00:59:34,418 --> 00:59:37,128
Wear this one. It's pretty and sophisticated.

905
00:59:37,828 --> 00:59:41,258
Then again, my daughter looks beautiful in anything.

906
00:59:42,498 --> 00:59:44,568
- Just wear it. - Stop.

907
01:00:08,388 --> 01:00:10,288
I wonder what they're like.

908
01:00:11,188 --> 01:00:13,098
I have no memories of them at all.

909
01:00:13,098 --> 01:00:15,158
But I know they'll be glad to see me.

910
01:00:16,228 --> 01:00:17,968
How am I supposed to act?

911
01:00:19,538 --> 01:00:23,068
Do you think my birth mother would still be looking for me?

912
01:00:23,068 --> 01:00:24,338
Yes, of course.

913
01:00:24,668 --> 01:00:26,078
If you were lost,

914
01:00:26,078 --> 01:00:28,308
she'd still be looking for you, for sure. Don't be silly.

915
01:00:28,738 --> 01:00:31,248
- That's what parents do. - Even if that's true,

916
01:00:32,008 --> 01:00:33,418
that doesn't have to define your life.

917
01:00:33,948 --> 01:00:35,078
You already have...

918
01:00:35,848 --> 01:00:36,988
parents.

919
01:00:40,058 --> 01:00:41,288
I should just meet them.

920
01:00:42,158 --> 01:00:44,958
This is something I have to do.

921
01:00:46,128 --> 01:00:47,198
After all,

922
01:00:47,658 --> 01:00:49,098
they birthed me.

923
01:00:54,568 --> 01:00:56,038
Yes, this way, please.

(Interview Room)

926
01:01:32,608 --> 01:01:33,708
She's here.

927
01:02:08,078 --> 01:02:09,208
Director Ko.

928
01:02:16,218 --> 01:02:18,048
Eun Oh? What are you doing at the police station?

929
01:02:45,348 --> 01:02:46,348
It can't be...

930
01:02:54,218 --> 01:02:55,288
No.

931
01:02:55,558 --> 01:02:56,728
This is impossible.

932
01:03:17,648 --> 01:03:18,778
Director Ko!

(Our Golden Days)

934
01:03:50,778 --> 01:03:54,448
How can I be happy about this? My own son is being a complete fool.

Climb the mountain, even if you have to crawl.

936
01:03:56,588 --> 01:03:58,648
Don't you know the saying, "No guts, no glory?"

937
01:03:58,748 --> 01:04:03,288
You made all this yourself? Really? Come on, your mom must've packed it.

938
01:04:03,428 --> 01:04:07,098
Mom won't care if I gain weight. I've got Lee Sang Hoon, after all.

939
01:04:07,158 --> 01:04:09,598
Park Yeong Ra! Stop!

940
01:04:10,098 --> 01:04:12,298
He was in need of a liver transplant.

941
01:04:12,638 --> 01:04:14,598
Eun Oh. I'm so terribly sorry.

942
01:04:14,898 --> 01:04:18,538
The donor suddenly backed out.
