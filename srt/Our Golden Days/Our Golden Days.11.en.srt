1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:02,470
(Social Welfare)

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:03,510
Down there.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,180
What does "full adoption" mean?

4
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:08,010
(Full adoption, 1999)

5
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:10,150
What exactly does it mean?

6
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,250
Unbelievable.

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,260
How pathetic.

8
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:24,860
I gave birth to that thing?

9
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,710
My sister...

10
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,310
Ji Eun Oh and I aren't related?

11
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:45,720
(Episode 11)

12
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:49,050
She actually witnessed the accident.

13
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,220
It was at the intersection.

14
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,720
I have other things to do
and will get going.

15
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,390
- Sure.
- It happened at the crosswalk.

16
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,760
Yes, I'm on my way.

17
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,500
Traffic is heavy,
so I'll be about five minutes late.

18
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,880
Are you saying
you actually saw it happen?

19
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:16,380
(Ambulance)

20
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,050
Thank you for your cooperation.

21
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:23,490
We'll get the car off the road.

22
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:27,160
What a relief.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,030
What...

24
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,950
Oh, no.

25
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,510
But it was from Director Ko.

26
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,620
(Resume)

27
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,320
It wouldn't surprise me...

28
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,760
if he made a pass at Yeong Ra.

29
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,630
We're down to 2 from 20.

30
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:10,240
As for these two candidates,
nothing stands out.

31
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:11,900
They don't present
any threats either.

32
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,440
As you know,
they're already married...

33
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,140
and each has two children.

34
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,850
Did you find out
why they left their old jobs?

35
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:24,120
Mr. Han quit his job
as a bodyguard...

36
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,020
because his wife wasn't fond
of his irregular hours.

37
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,020
Unbelievable.

38
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,220
Yet he interviewed for a job
where he gets off work at 10 p.m.

39
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,930
As for Mr. Ryu, he quit his job
when a board member...

40
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,130
at the broadcasting station retired.

41
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,830
Why didn't he re-sign
with the company?

42
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,600
You should look into that.

43
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,270
I don't understand
what you want me to find out.

44
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,700
I see skeletons in their closet.

45
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,040
Don't you see them too, Ms. Shin?

46
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,680
Of course. I'll look into why...

47
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,450
Mr. Han and Mr. Ryu
really left their jobs.

48
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,850
The money has been wired.

49
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,550
Are you also looking
into Seonggol Group?

50
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,350
Of course. Thank you for your time.

51
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,020
- This is the master bedroom.
- No way.

52
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,390
Ta-da. This is the master bedroom.

53
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,860
- No way.
- My gosh.

54
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,860
You're moving into a new home.

55
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,160
I totally agree, ma'am.

56
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,000
Gosh, please be careful.

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,730
You might get paint on you.

58
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,340
You should watch out.

59
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,070
This was supposed
to be DIY interior design,

60
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,740
but they managed the project
and even hired all the workers.

61
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,380
- Really?
- Is that true?

62
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,910
I designed the place
the way I wanted.

63
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,080
- These were all my ideas.
- Really?

64
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,620
Would you like to see
the walk-in closet?

65
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,080
- Of course.
- Come this way.

66
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,490
- Goodness.
- Come on over.

67
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,660
See how the walls were done.

68
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,120
Ms. Ji, your eyes look hollow.

69
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,260
Are you not feeling well?

70
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,630
It's not that.
I'm just tired from working on...

71
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,830
two projects at once.

72
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,600
How can I know if you're tired,

73
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,570
sick, or heartbroken...

74
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,270
when you rarely show us
how you feel?

75
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,970
I'll have fattened up by the time
we start our job in Mapo.

76
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,340
Goodness!

77
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,680
This is so nice. Oh, my.

78
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,120
Mom.

79
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,920
What is it, Gang Oh?

80
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,060
(Certificate of Adoption)

81
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,690
Explain this.

82
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:16,930
What do you have there?

83
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,270
You adopted Ji Eun Oh
on November 15, 1999.

84
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:23,200
Is this true?

85
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,840
How...

86
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,610
You went home saying you were sick.

87
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,140
Where did you find this?

88
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,420
Applied by Ji Yeong Min,
Adopter, Jeong Sun Hui.

89
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,780
That's you and Dad.

90
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,020
Was Eun Oh adopted?

91
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,720
Yes, but...

92
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,260
Where on earth did you find this?

93
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,590
I found it among the forms
for renouncing Dad's inheritance.

94
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,960
- Why did you look through there?
- How's that important right now...

95
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,730
when Ji Eun Oh isn't my real sister?

96
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,240
Can you imagine
how I'm feeling right now?

97
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,970
Right, of course.

98
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:03,710
This must have come as a shock.

99
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,440
But Gang Oh...

100
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,010
Gang Oh, look at me.

101
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,250
Eun Oh...

102
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,420
is your big sister.

103
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:13,990
She's your dad's and my daughter.

104
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,620
You're not blood-related!

105
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,060
She's been treating me this way
not knowing the truth!

106
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,460
I'm going to tell her.

107
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,760
She already knows,

108
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,370
so don't do anything unnecessary.

109
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,740
She knows?

110
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,260
(Just us)

111
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,360
After weeks of nothing but work,
I'm completely stressed out.

112
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,340
(Just us)

113
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,270
Let's do some gaming
for just one hour.

114
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,840
Our captain has spoken.

115
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,210
(Just us)

116
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,680
When, captain?

117
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:21,150
Let's leave together
when I get there in 15 minutes.

118
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,620
Okay?

119
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,590
Okay.

120
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,630
(Consignor: Mamdaerozip,
Assignee: Seol Woo Jae)

121
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,600
When can I start working?

122
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,800
Two more projects
are in the pipeline,

123
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,770
so you'll get a call
in a week or two.

124
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,870
Where did you get the idea
to do this?

125
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,440
The thought came to me
like it was meant to be.

126
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:47,450
Hey.

127
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,210
What's that?

128
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,280
It's nothing at all.

129
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,720
(You have a new message: Mom)

130
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,160
I'm right on time, aren't I?

131
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,630
You are. Give me a minute.

132
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,630
Sure.

133
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,200
Are you ready?

134
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:05,730
Yes.

135
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,510
Bye, then.

136
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,140
- I hope to hear from you soon.
- Okay.

137
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,390
What are you doing here
during work hours?

138
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,720
I have an appointment.

139
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,920
An appointment?

140
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,160
We can go now.

141
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,000
Where are you three going?

142
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,570
There's a thing. It's just us.

143
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,740
"Just us?"

144
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,610
Cover for me, Min Woo.
I won't be too long.

145
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,680
Okay.

146
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,240
Hey, you, Ji Eun Oh!

147
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,720
You knew?

148
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,190
You knew we weren't related?

149
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,470
You were adopted.

150
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,080
You knew that,
and you still bullied me?

151
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:27,980
What...

152
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,480
Gang Oh.

153
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,850
Let's talk in private.

154
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,960
What for?

155
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,090
You're not even my sister.

156
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,530
You bullied me all this time,
knowing we weren't even related?

157
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:55,070
Hey. Come with me.

158
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,140
Let go of me. Who are you?

159
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,920
Let me go!

160
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:10,960
You.

161
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,490
Get a hold of yourself.
This is a coffee shop.

162
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,160
Are you really Eun Oh's brother?

163
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,000
Aren't you old enough to know
what not to yell in public?

164
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,260
Don't you care about your sister?

165
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,700
Why should I care how she feels?

166
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,130
We're not related!

167
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,940
Who are you people?

168
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,270
- I'm her senior.
- I'm her senior.

169
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,140
Why are you her senior?

170
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,310
That's what she called me...

171
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,980
until I started my current job.

172
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,210
Didn't you know that?

173
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,520
Why are you getting in the way
when it's none of your business?

174
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,620
- What did you say?
- What did you say?

175
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,160
Hey.

176
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,830
Do you want a good beating?

177
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,230
I miss corporal punishment.

178
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:50,860
You two.

179
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,170
Can you go inside?

180
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,370
Watch your language.

181
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,780
I got Mom's text.

182
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,750
You went to her first?

183
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,390
Yes. She confirmed it.

184
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:20,120
She even said
you knew we weren't related.

185
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:22,830
Yes.

186
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,360
I heard about it
when I was in ninth grade.

187
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,600
What I don't get is
why you're so angry.

188
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,700
I'm our parents' daughter...

189
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,100
and you're my little brother.

190
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,370
Our parents made that decision,
and that's how things were.

191
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,710
Then you should've stopped
at pretending to be their daughter.

192
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:40,240
You're nothing to me.

193
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,710
You took the money
that was meant for me!

194
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,880
What?

195
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,850
Gang Oh.

196
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,090
What did you just say?

197
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:51,260
Why do you think I gave up soccer?

198
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:54,290
I was ten years old
when Dad's business flopped.

199
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,160
I had to quit my private lessons...

200
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,960
because you spent all my money.

201
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,930
Jang Seon Woo stayed on to train
and joined the national team...

202
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,700
while I had to quit because of you.

203
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:06,100
How can you say that?

204
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,210
We're siblings, Gang Oh.

205
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,770
We're not actual siblings.

206
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,280
We're not related.

207
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,510
You knew that all along
and pretended to be my real sister.

208
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,880
You berated me...

209
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,280
and told me to spend less!

210
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,950
You have no shame.

211
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,220
How dare you...

212
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:24,090
- Are you going to run your mouth?
- Yes!

213
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,920
What you're doing right now.

214
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,090
You're acting like you're my sister.

215
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,400
This is what makes me so angry!

216
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,570
Until Dad's business failed,

217
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,870
you learned piano, ballet, art,
everything you wanted.

218
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,500
And all from a private tutor.

219
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,310
All that money
could've gone to my soccer lessons!

220
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,280
If Dad hadn't spent all that on you,

221
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:49,350
he might not have lost his business.

222
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,420
I...

223
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,660
I don't know what to say.

224
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,760
I bet you don't.

225
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,330
You'd better not have
a single excuse.

226
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,570
What do you want to do, then?

227
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:08,700
I don't know!

228
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,600
Make up for it.

229
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,760
You're all in here.

230
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,860
Mr. Park, let's call today off.

231
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,860
Sorry, Su Jeong.

232
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,860
Where are you going?

233
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,660
To my mom's restaurant.

234
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,670
To help with the dinner rush
since Gang Oh won't be there.

235
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,370
Right now?

236
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,270
Treat us to a meal next time.

237
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,510
Okay.

238
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,710
- My gosh.
- My gosh.

239
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,310
I need a drink.

240
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,090
Don't think of going without me.

241
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,800
Come to Agit now for a shift,

242
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,370
and I'll pay you 20 dollars an hour.

243
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,600
(Value of Hangyeol Juniors)

244
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:23,540
You didn't know either, Ji Hyuk?

245
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,340
I had no clue.

246
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,510
Me neither.

247
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,910
Eun Oh cared so much
about her family.

248
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,280
She saved up her salary
for four years...

249
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,350
to open a restaurant for her mom,

250
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,790
and they moved too.

251
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,420
It was a rental, but still.

252
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,360
Eun Oh paid for all that?

253
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:42,390
Did you just say
Eun Oh paid for the restaurant?

254
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,700
She didn't just chip in?

255
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,500
I went to help out once...

256
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:50,030
around the time it opened.

257
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,470
I found out
only because her mom told me.

258
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:55,810
That's why she saved up
while at Doogle for four years?

259
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,980
You called yourself
Eun Oh's closest friend...

260
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,080
and you didn't know that?

261
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,750
Her father went bankrupt
when she was in tenth grade,

262
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,290
and he died two years later.

263
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,720
I knew they were poor.

264
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:13,390
She was always working...

265
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,990
and she studied hard
to keep her scholarship.

266
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,560
I guess
I was just a superficial friend.

267
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:24,170
I thought I knew her
through and through.

268
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:26,940
No one...

269
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:30,810
shows anyone
what they're truly like.

270
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,420
Hello?

271
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:40,650
Yes.

272
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,150
Right now?

273
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,090
Yes, if you come right away.

274
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,560
Bye.

275
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,130
Eun Oh.

276
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,790
Gang Oh went to see you, didn't he?

277
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,860
Well? What did he say?

278
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,870
It's a busy day today.

279
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,240
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

280
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,670
I was going to close for the day,

281
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,240
but people kept coming in.

282
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,580
Why would you close
when it's not a scheduled holiday?

283
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,140
How could I concentrate?

284
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:10,510
Mom. You don't work
because you can concentrate.

285
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,580
You work because you must.

286
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,190
That sounds familiar.

287
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,620
I quoted Dad.

288
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,860
- Excuse me?
- Yes?

289
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,430
Can we have
more pickled garlic stems...

290
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:24,800
- Yes.
- and two bottles of soju?

291
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,400
- I'll get that right away.
- Thanks.

292
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,970
She was adopted?

293
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:39,140
Even so,
how dare her brother talk like that?

294
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,610
How must she feel,

295
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,710
having to go help her mom
after hearing all that?

296
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:48,490
It's madness.

297
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:50,950
I feel betrayed,

298
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,220
so what does that say about me?

299
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:56,990
You feel betrayed?

300
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,700
I've been her friend since we met...

301
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,700
at our volunteer club in college.

302
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:03,330
When Agit first opened,

303
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,700
she hired me...

304
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,770
so I could stop hopping
from one part-time job to another.

305
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:09,410
Being close doesn't mean
she had to say she was adopted.

306
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:11,740
That's not what I mean.

307
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:13,810
I mean, Eun Oh's personality.

308
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,380
She always had
a positive and upbeat attitude.

309
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,580
She's bright, tireless,

310
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,750
unyielding, and unbowed.

311
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,690
Earlier,

312
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,620
she seemed so different.

313
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,630
She didn't seem like
the Eun Oh I've known.

314
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:35,370
How could she live like that...

315
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:37,940
when she had such a history?

316
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,370
Come to think of it,

317
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:42,010
aside from the cafeteria meals...

318
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:43,670
and club after-parties
back in college,

319
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,580
we rarely ate out together...

320
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,380
during the years
we worked together at the cafe.

321
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,810
She said her favorite food
was triangle gimbap.

322
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,650
To me, she said
gukbap was her favorite.

323
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,460
She's on good terms
with her mother, though.

324
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,630
She also said
she really loved her late father.

325
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,700
(Winter 2015)

326
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,840
My club juniors insisted
on throwing a birthday party for me,

327
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,800
so I gave in.

328
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:15,770
You should come too.

329
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:19,510
(To the right)

330
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,760
What?

331
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,370
Is she a fool or what?

332
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,380
Oh, no. This... What?

333
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,860
Thank you. Hang on.

334
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:10,760
What?

335
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,830
This is amazing.

336
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,340
It's not ruined at all. It's fine.

337
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,770
- What?
- This cake.

338
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:22,570
I made it myself.

339
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,910
It's the birthday
of someone important.

340
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,110
I see.

341
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,450
What a relief.

342
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,310
- Thank you.
- All right.

343
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,750
Thank you so much.

344
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,090
Gosh, it hurts.

345
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,790
She's off the wall.

346
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,060
Birthday?

347
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:57,340
(Father)

348
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,510
Wherever you are,
come home right away.

349
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,010
We'll be having dinner at home.

350
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:11,660
Please come this way.

351
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,360
- Come here.
- Here. Hey, come over here.

352
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,560
- Please have a seat.
- One, two, three.

353
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,660
- Hello, we're Value of Hangyeol.
- Hello, we're Value of Hangyeol.

354
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,860
(Architecture Volunteer Club,
Value of Hangyeol)

355
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,800
Hello.

356
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,170
Are you here to join a club?

357
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,940
No.

358
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,370
I guess you're here
to get some information.

359
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,310
I'm glad you're here.

360
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:35,480
Our club is a place where you can do
really fun and exciting activities.

361
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:39,050
School life and job hunting
can be really stressful.

362
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,450
Sometimes, you want...

363
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:42,750
to focus on something
without thinking about other things.

364
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,850
That's when...

365
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,290
you should start renovating
and decorating a house.

366
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:47,860
Then all the districting thoughts
will go away.

367
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:51,360
When the house is finished, you feel
a great sense of accomplishment.

368
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,830
It feels so rewarding.

369
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,070
Is that so?

370
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,200
Yes.

371
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,170
By the way,

372
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,670
was I rambling on about it
without asking...

373
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:05,010
when your major was something
related to architecture?

374
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,510
I major in business administration.

375
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:12,020
Then you must be interested
in volunteering.

376
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,520
I believe it will suit you well.

377
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,150
You can volunteer
and relieve stress.

378
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,060
I guess you're right.

379
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,620
Would you like to join us?

380
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,660
I'm Lee Ji Hyuk from the 16th batch.

381
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:30,130
Why did you not tell me?

382
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,240
What?

383
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:35,770
Did you just say Lee Ji Hyuk?

384
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:37,540
The Lee Ji Hyuk?

385
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:42,710
I heard you'd return to school,
so I've been waiting for you.

386
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,750
Guys!

387
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,750
He's Lee Ji Hyuk
from the 16th batch.

388
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,190
- What?
- My gosh.

389
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,720
- Hello.
- Hello.

390
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,620
- Hello.
- Go back to what you were doing.

391
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,990
- Okay. My goodness.
- My gosh.

392
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,630
(Architecture Volunteer Club,
Value of Hangyeol)

393
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,800
So you were Lee Ji Hyuk.

394
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,370
Nice to meet you.

395
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:04,670
I'm Ji Eun Oh from the 19th batch.

396
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:05,900
I hope we will get along well.

397
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,170
It depends on how you do.

398
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,510
I'll do well.

399
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,810
You'll do well?

400
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:16,510
Yes.

401
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,680
You're reckless.

402
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:24,590
When I do what I like,
I tend to be reckless.

403
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,000
Ji Hyuk.

404
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,100
I should get going.

405
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:38,670
What?

406
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,170
My father wants me to come home.

407
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,310
Then...

408
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,180
We should get going too.

409
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,610
Are we going home already?

410
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,380
While feeling this way?

411
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:52,220
I have to go to work early
tomorrow morning.

412
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,450
I'm a handyman.

413
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,290
What?

414
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,390
I just looked at your face.

415
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,560
I even called Hye Na.

416
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:08,130
I'm still in shock.

417
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:11,940
You won't shake off the shock
even if you drink all night.

418
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,070
- Give me that.
- Wait.

419
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,610
You're done, right?

420
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:18,140
It's cassia seed tea.

421
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,680
It seemed like
your eyes were strained yesterday.

422
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,810
Thank you.

423
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:25,920
Seong Jae should come quickly
so you can have dinner.

424
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,250
Let's wait and see...

425
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,190
if he will let me starve or not.

426
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,420
By the way,

427
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:35,490
how long have you known...

428
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:37,560
CEO Min Tae Ho of Hyeonu Fashion?

429
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,130
Why are you asking such a thing?

430
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:43,870
What?

431
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,940
You're not interested in my work.

432
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,340
And I'm not the type of person
to bring work home.

433
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:54,850
You know, he's a powerful figure
in the business community.

434
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:56,550
I guess I found it interesting.

435
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,150
Aren't you hungry?

436
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,150
Why isn't Seong Jae coming?

437
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:03,520
Oh, right. About Seong Jae.

438
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,060
Are you sure you're looking
for Seoung Jae's partner?

439
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,730
You don't seem to be in a rush.

440
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,470
I knew you would notice.

441
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:17,770
And?

442
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,010
It's not like
I haven't done anything.

443
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:25,780
But I'm being a little cautious.

444
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:27,680
Cautious?

445
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:34,380
It wasn't just any second marriage.

446
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,890
I had nothing to show for.

447
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,560
I want to meet your expectations.

448
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:46,230
And I want to find a daughter-in-law
you'll be satisfied with.

449
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:49,030
But the business community
isn't so easy.

450
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,600
I can't help but feel small.

451
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:55,810
So I couldn't contact many people.

452
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:00,440
And Seong Jae says he's not ready.

453
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,610
I used it as an excuse.

454
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,650
I'm sorry.

455
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:06,420
It's been years
since we got remarried.

456
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:10,190
Who would dare to gossip
about Park Jin Seok's remarriage?

457
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,890
They do. Who wouldn't gossip?

458
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,560
My ex-husband
wasn't anyone significant.

459
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,100
And I'm not from a wealthy family.

460
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:22,800
I don't have
a good educational background,

461
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,940
and my career wasn't so great.

462
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,440
Do you still feel that way?

463
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,240
You're really...

464
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,740
You have a tough side, but you're
softhearted at the same time.

465
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,170
Here's your key.

466
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:56,730
Okay. Thank you.

467
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:57,800
Thank you.

468
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:05,440
I won't have dinner
until you come home.

469
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,750
Didn't you have something to say?

470
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,820
A family should eat together
from time to time.

471
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:20,290
Why are you never home for dinner?

472
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,190
I come home late from work.

473
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:25,460
Why bother working late...

474
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,700
when your heart isn't in it?

475
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:30,800
You'll give him indigestion.

476
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,100
I didn't cook Seong Jae's
favorite LA galbi...

477
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,270
just so you could grill him.

478
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,410
Whatever it is, I'll hear you out.

479
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:44,510
You left the office
this afternoon...

480
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,920
and were gone
until the end of the workday.

481
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,520
What were you up to?

482
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:51,920
(Ms. Jung Hui Yeong at MJ)

483
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,620
Sorry to interrupt mealtime,

484
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:57,430
but honey, Seong Jae,
I need to take this call.

485
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,500
Sure.

486
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:06,740
What have you been up to?

487
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,540
Are you coursing through life
just killing time,

488
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,240
playing video games?

489
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:14,980
I do play games sometimes.

490
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,280
You pathetic brat.

491
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,850
This is exactly why
you must get married.

492
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,850
You should marry a woman
like your mother.

493
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,220
Which mother...

494
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,530
are you referring to?

495
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,200
Of course not, Ms. Jung.

496
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,360
I only called
so that we could get together.

497
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,070
Which mother?

498
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,640
You brat.

499
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,440
How many times must I tell you
that you only have one mother?

500
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,140
Do you still think of that woman
as your mother...

501
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,040
after she cheated on me
and abandoned you?

502
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,450
You have no right
to tell me how to feel.

503
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:51,750
A decent person...

504
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,680
would never abandon their child.

505
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:57,690
How can she be your mother...

506
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,560
when she abandoned you
before you could even remember her?

507
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:03,290
Anyone who abandons their child
is not human.

508
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,160
I'd call her a monster.

509
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:27,220
How dare you say such nonsense?

510
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:30,090
Is it because
you've been involved...

511
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,160
with someone unreasonable?

512
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,420
Tell me.

513
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:37,230
Why did you leave the office
without giving notice today?

514
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,630
That's why...

515
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,460
I work at your company.

516
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:43,900
I already told you this.

517
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:46,870
Without the freedom that comes
with being your successor,

518
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,570
I can't stand corporate life.

519
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,940
Park Seong Jae.

520
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,010
A toothless tiger
can't chew anything.

521
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,080
You'll only get what others
have chewed up and spat out.

522
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,630
Sit.

523
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:19,370
I said we should talk
after we've cleaned up the place.

524
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:21,140
No, tell me right now,

525
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,270
before I suffocate from not knowing.

526
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,980
What did Gang Oh say?

527
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,250
He must've been really shocked.

528
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:32,120
He asked why I never told him.

529
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,650
He went over there just to say that?

530
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:41,290
How was it urgent enough
to seek you out during the day?

531
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:45,430
He was in shock,

532
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,300
so of course,
his temper got the best of him.

533
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:49,630
Was he riled up?

534
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,070
How bad was it?

535
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,840
What did he say?

536
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,770
You know how he gets.

537
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,540
He'll move on from this.

538
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,280
But you're his big sister.

539
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,180
I can't believe
he's still this immature.

540
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,850
It's a fact
that you're his big sister.

541
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:15,460
Of course. Besides, what can he do?

542
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,090
He can't change anything.

543
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:21,000
Mom, are you done
cleaning the kitchen?

544
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:23,230
Get changed, and we'll head home.

545
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,470
My gosh.

546
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,320
Park Seong Jae.

547
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,750
A toothless tiger
can't chew anything.

548
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,760
You'll only get what others
have chewed up and spat out.

549
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,560
I'm still young,

550
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,700
but I'm already a toothless tiger.

551
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:06,210
What for?

552
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,850
You're not even my sister.

553
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:12,250
You bullied me all this time,
knowing we weren't even related?

554
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:22,630
A toothless tiger...

555
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:25,160
couldn't keep anyone by its side.

556
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,160
It's far too weak to hunt...

557
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:31,470
or fight.

558
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,780
I'm sure he's out with his friends.

559
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,450
Will this go on for a week?

560
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,350
How can a man...

561
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,720
be shocked by such a thing?

562
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,060
He even got upset
that we never told him.

563
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,230
Unbelievable.

564
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,570
I've never given him what he wanted,

565
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:04,370
so he's lashing out...

566
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:06,400
because he thinks
he finally has a reason.

567
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:10,840
When will that kid grow up?

568
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,080
Maybe...

569
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:16,750
in a week.

570
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,150
My gosh.

571
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,360
Goodness.

572
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,460
I can't believe you. Aren't you
scared to actually sleep here?

573
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:35,120
If I say I'm scared,
will you sleep here with me?

574
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:37,390
What?

575
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,630
Wait, hold on. Don't get any ideas.

576
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,970
I didn't mean in the same bed.
It's closer...

577
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,140
to a bodyguard, doorman,
or security guard.

578
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,440
You're 30 now.

579
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,410
Watch what you say.

580
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:53,910
Either way,
you're going to leave me here.

581
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:56,180
That's right. Like you said,
you've slept here more than once.

582
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:58,450
Here.

583
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,320
It may not seem like it,

584
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,150
but it can be quite cozy.

585
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:09,130
I took away the space you use
for all-nighters.

586
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,650
Why are you here so early,

587
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:35,220
Ms. Ji?

588
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:37,990
To check both the paint job
and the cleaning.

589
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,460
I see.

590
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,120
It's an overlaying job,

591
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:44,630
so I mopped it
and vacuumed everything twice.

592
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,300
I'll be mopping it once more.

593
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,270
I see you're here early.

594
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,140
I didn't want anything
to get on the paint.

595
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,840
By the way, this vacuum cleaner...

596
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,880
works wonders.

597
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:03,810
My company should get one.

598
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:06,050
I'll get you the model number.

599
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:10,920
You obviously didn't get any sleep,

600
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,190
but you're doing
a good job hiding it, Eun Oh.

601
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,560
What was that?

602
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:17,860
Well...

603
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,060
I mean...

604
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:24,500
Did you really know
about what he said yesterday?

605
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,470
- Yes.
- Since when?

606
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:33,210
Forget I asked.

607
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:49,090
- Did you all sleep well?
- Hey.

608
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,990
Su Bin, you're up early today.

609
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:52,760
It's been a while
since I saw you, Dad.

610
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:56,800
Good morning.

611
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:58,400
- Hey.
- You too?

612
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:00,640
Yes, me too.

613
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,870
I was told to greet him
in the morning...

614
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:04,270
before he forgot our faces.

615
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:07,240
Da Jeong, you were right
to order that.

616
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,710
- Right, Mother?
- Absolutely.

617
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:11,210
Was this necessary
when they don't have breakfast?

618
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:12,580
I blame you, Dad.

619
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,480
Why do you never stay home?

620
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,620
Don't you get any rest?

621
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:18,190
It's your fault
we barely get to see you.

622
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,190
Tell me about it.

623
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,920
You look awfully tired, Dad.

624
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,560
Did you lose weight?

625
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:26,230
He's giving his all to studying,
that's why.

626
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:29,270
Ji Wan, how is it going,
driving Seong Jae's sister around?

627
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,000
It seems like
you've always been on time.

628
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,640
Of course. I couldn't do that
to Ji Hyuk's reputation.

629
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,770
Ji Hyuk's reputation?

630
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:37,240
It's Seong Jae's reputation
you should worry about.

631
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,670
Come on.

632
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:42,110
I'm sure one day Ji Hyuk
will make a name for himself too.

633
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:44,280
Su Bin, what do you have planned
for today?

634
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,520
I'll be painting the storage unit.

635
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,750
I'm off to the paint shop
to choose a color,

636
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:48,990
and I will paint it
in the afternoon.

637
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:52,290
Su Bin, when are you heading out?

638
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:55,190
I'm meeting Ha Eun
outside the subway station at 10 a.m.

639
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:58,630
I'll be going out with you.

640
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:01,230
Do you have somewhere to go, Mother?

641
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,970
Oh, of course.
You're meeting Ms. Myeong Suk.

642
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,640
But Mother, isn't Ms. Myeong Suk...

643
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,240
the hair salon owner...

644
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,610
from Tongyeong?

645
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:13,710
Her son and I are the same age.

646
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:16,050
What? No, it's not her.

647
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,150
It's a different Myeong Suk.

648
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:21,220
You must've had
a lot of friends in Tongyeong.

649
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:25,220
Hardly.
Your grandma spent her days...

650
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,960
cleaning fish at the market...

651
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,830
and nursing your grandfather
at the hospital.

652
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:32,460
She didn't have time
to make friends.

653
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,930
As if you know any better.

654
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:39,070
Sang Cheol, you were busy
with your own life back then...

655
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:41,640
and didn't have time
to see how I was doing.

656
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,340
Mother,

657
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,840
have you and your friend decided
to meet...

658
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,440
every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday?

659
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,980
Gosh, no.

660
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:53,780
Myeong Suk and the other friends
from the senior citizen center...

661
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,480
suggest we meet up every day,

662
00:36:56,620 --> 00:37:00,020
but I couldn't go out all the time,
leaving you alone at home.

663
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,760
You can, Mother.

664
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,760
Meet your friends every day.

665
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:21,710

(Huiyeon Daycare)

668
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:41,960
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

669
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:44,200
Can I ask for a favor?

670
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,200
I have to send this resume by email,

671
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,110
but I don't know how to attach this.

672
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:51,670
Can you help me?

673
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,910
I'll say this again,

674
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:55,810
but you can't give out
two sheets at once.

675
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:57,150
You can't throw them away either.

676
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,210
Sure.

677
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:04,250
(Specializing in Korean cuisine)

678
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:48,860
Hello?

679
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,370
Yes, you've reached Eunoism Design.

680
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,900
An estimate?

681
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,070
Until the day after tomorrow?

682
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:01,010
Can you send me the floor plan
and your requests...

683
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:02,710
via email right now?

684
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:05,110
- She's taking on a new client?
- Sure.

685
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,950
Is she trying to kill herself
from exhaustion?

686
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:09,050
How foolish.

687
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:10,890
Here's my email address. Oh, gosh.

688
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,490
Just a second.

689
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:16,360
Here.

690
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:20,000
Thanks. Sure, go ahead.

691
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,840
I'll give the handkerchief back
washed.

692
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:33,780
That you should.

693
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:35,980
I can wrap things up here,

694
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:37,310
so get some rest today.

695
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,320
Why?

696
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:41,550
I know about flooring too.

697
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:43,590
I'm not a complete amateur,
you know.

698
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,690
That's only what you think.

699
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,560
You might trust yourself,

700
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,460
but I don't trust you.

701
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:53,730
It's a coordinator's duty...

702
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:56,130
to make sure the job is done well.

703
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:59,400
Sure. Whatever.

704
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:07,010
How stubborn can she be?
Could she be more frustrating?

705
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:08,280
I shouldn't have hired her
as a coordinator.

706
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:11,850
I was wondering
how Eun Oh was doing.

707
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:14,050
I'm in the dark too.

708
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:16,120
I'm curious too,
but I know I shouldn't call her.

709
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,420
She must be at a site.

710
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:19,920
Of course.

711
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,120
Even if the world ends,
she won't abandon her duties.

712
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:25,830
All right. I got it for now.

713
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:31,630
Here. I'll call you
when your order's ready.

714
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,140
- Thank you.
- No problem.

715
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:34,970
What?

716
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,110
Director Seong Jae,
Eun Oh won't be back for a while.

717
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:40,840
I got this for her,

718
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,750
but don't tell her it's from me.

719
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,680
Let's say it's from you instead.

720
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:47,080
These are cheongsimhwan
and some supplements.

721
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,950
I bet she's still in shock.

722
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,590
Got it. I'll take credit for this.

723
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:58,890
By the way,
is Ji Hyuk at the site with her?

724
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:00,630
Probably.

725
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,430
He's there as a worker...

726
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:03,970
and stays behind
to clean everything up.

727
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:07,940
Seong Jae. I have my own plan.

728
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,970
I want to make it
without anyone's help.

729
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:13,810
How can a business succeed
when you hardly prepared?

730
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:14,980
It was only a few months.

731
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:17,650
You really think less of me,
don't you?

732
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:20,720
I don't need help from you,
my parents,

733
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,520
or anyone else. Succeed or fail,

734
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:24,950
I'll do it on my own.

735
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:26,890
He's on-site as the handyman.

736
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:28,960
Was he serious about this business?

737
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,300
Right, then.

738
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,760
Goodness me.

739
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:02,990
Seriously?

740
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,290
Are you out of your mind?

741
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:06,330
Gosh, sorry about that.

742
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,330
Wait, aren't you Sang Cheol?

743
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:13,940
Are you Dong Gu? Choi Dong Gu?

744
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:16,240
What a weird twist of events.

745
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,610
Who knew I'd run into
my high school friend like this?

746
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,680
My gosh.

747
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:26,480
It must've been rough.

748
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,790
Right after retirement,
you were pushed into the blizzard.

749
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:31,490
What about you?

750
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:33,460
Why are you working as a courier...

751
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,120
when you retired as a bank manager?

752
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:37,630
Were you scammed
out of your retirement money?

753
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,200
Yes, by my son.

754
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:43,930
After finishing his studies abroad,

755
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:45,430
he asked me for money
to start a business,

756
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:46,870
and I couldn't refuse.

757
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,440
Isn't it ironic,

758
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,170
since I was the one...

759
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:53,010
who told everyone
not to give their children money?

760
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:57,310
For us, children are always
the exception.

761
00:42:58,350 --> 00:42:59,350
By the way,

762
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:00,680
it would've been a disaster...

763
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,450
if you had gotten hurt
because of me.

764
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:04,350
Tell me about it.

765
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:06,790
My wife and kids don't know
I've been working this job.

766
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:09,690
I've been lying to them,
saying I have money stashed away.

767
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:12,630
They think I spend time
at a friend's office.

768
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:16,200
How did your life get like this?

769
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:19,870
I could tell you were new...

770
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:22,170
at handing out flyers,
seeing how awkward you were.

771
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:25,170
It's not as if I can work
a regular part-time job.

772
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:26,880
Hey,

773
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,240
back in high school,

774
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:32,180
we both got good grades
and were elected head of the class.

775
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:36,620
Who knew we'd end up like this
in our later years?

776
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:40,760
Tell me about it.
Life is such a battle.

777
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:43,960
How are your parents?

778
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,460
My father passed away
three years ago,

779
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:49,030
and my mother lives with me.

780
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,630
I heard...

781
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:54,540
how your father was injured
on a fishing boat.

782
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,740
Was it about 30 years ago?

783
00:43:57,310 --> 00:43:59,340
My father went out to fish
with your father.

784
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:01,640
- Really?
- Yes.

785
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:05,210
It was so long ago
that I hardly remember.

786
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,680
By the way,

787
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:12,020
how long have you supported
your parents?

788
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,160
(2 sundaeguk, 20 dollars)

789
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:26,900
Hey, let's each pay
for our own meal.

790
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,040
We're in the same situation now,

791
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,770
and paying for each other's meals
is a thing of the past.

792
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:36,480
We'll pay the bill, please.

793
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:39,450
Just a moment.

794
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:41,320
The homeowner
will come by much later.

795
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,950
I texted them,
so they'll wire the money.

796
00:44:43,090 --> 00:44:44,390
Can you clean up for me?

797
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:46,360
Hello?

798
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:48,190
I'll send you an estimate
within two days.

799
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,260
Yes, I got the email.

800
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:53,130
She'll go to the Mapo site
and then give someone an estimate?

801
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:54,500
What the...

802
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,300
Is she trying to
work herself to death?

803
00:44:57,370 --> 00:44:58,800
Oh, whatever.

804
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,000
I shouldn't have opened my office
in the cafe.

805
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,140
Just wait until I get an investment.

806
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:04,670
I can't stand watching her do this.

807
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:10,310
Why play the miserable heroine
and get on my nerves?

808
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:13,820
- Get everything that's inside.
- Okay.

809
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:15,280
Hello.

810
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,420
- I'm here.
- Hi.

811
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:22,790
Ms. Ji.

812
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:26,600
It's been just a day,
and you look haggard.

813
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:28,200
Oh, really?

814
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:30,200
I must've tossed and turned...

815
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,900
for fear
that you'd tear everything down.

816
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:32,970
What?

817
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:35,770
Take a look around.

818
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:36,940
- I will.
- Go on.

819
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:44,650
Should I get her some medicine
to calm her down?

820
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:47,680
Her brother's taunts were enough
to scare even a grown man.

821
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:51,690
(Mansaeng Pharmacy)

822
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:52,750
Forget it.

823
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,860
She won't take anything I get her.

824
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:59,700
I'll get Su Jeong to give it to her.

825
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:03,900
Wait.

826
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:05,700
The flooring goes down today.

827
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:08,670
The project finishes in three days.

828
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:11,070
Lee Ji Hyuk. You birdbrain.

829
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:14,340
You have to pay her 18,000 dollars.

830
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:16,980
You proudly said
you'd pay her 20,000 dollars.

831
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:24,120
This darn Tama Bank.

832
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,590
What's taking them so long...

833
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:27,020
to clear my unsecured loan?

834
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:32,900
(Sunny Investment Support Center)

835
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:34,060
Hello.

836
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:36,770
Mamdaerozip's business proposal
and investment request...

837
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:38,370
cleared the first round.

838
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:39,770
Hey, Sunny.

839
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,640
Why are you so lazy?

840
00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:44,070
You're telling me this now?

841
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:47,880
Yes.

842
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:50,150
I pitched to two places.
One of them will approve a loan.

843
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:52,310
Yes. It'll work out.

844
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:53,780
It will.

845
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:57,820
Hello.

846
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:00,590
I won't stay here tonight.
Be sure to lock up.

847
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:01,760
Why won't you...

848
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:04,390
I won't be here tonight.
Lock things up.

849
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:08,000
Where will he sleep if not here?

850
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,100
Does he have another girlfriend?

851
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:12,200
Goodness...

852
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:19,070
I'm back.

853
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:21,810
Eun Oh.

854
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:26,250
Don't give me that look.
I feel uncomfortable.

855
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:27,880
You brat.

856
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:30,120
Did you and Ji Hyuk argue again?

857
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:31,490
Why come in separately
but just seconds apart?

858
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:33,720
I'm coming from the Mapo site.

859
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:36,330
The guy in our storage room
was at his site all day long.

860
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:37,860
Ji Eun Oh.

861
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:40,430
I was going to buy myself
an oat milk latte.

862
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:41,830
I'll buy you one too.

863
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:44,730
Okay.

864
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:46,370
Did you hear that? Two lattes.

865
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,640
Two lattes.

866
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:54,810
How did things go yesterday?

867
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:58,280
Sorry, Su Jeong. I have work to do.

868
00:47:58,850 --> 00:48:01,350
Hey. Can you not be so indifferent?

869
00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:02,990
Do I mean this little to you?

870
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:05,490
I'm really busy today.

871
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:06,990
Someone asked for an estimate.

872
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:09,860
- You'll do it?
- Yes.

873
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:15,600
You can work here all night, then.

874
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,330
Ji Hyuk won't sleep here tonight.

875
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:19,640
He told me to lock up.

876
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:22,700
Did he?

877
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:25,810
I'll give you a call.

A 120m² apartment,
3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms.

you can use to fit your budget.

I have to call
just ten people today?

Hello.

00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:01,110
It's Mamdaerozip.

891
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:03,310
I read your post.

892
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:10,090
Who is it?

893
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:17,390
I came to get the mat
and my sleeping bag.

894
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:20,030
They're over here.

895
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:44,390
Hey.

896
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:45,490
You must take something.

00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:51,430
Where did you get this?

899
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:53,060
I bought it.

900
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:55,660
And this supplement...

901
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:58,030
was my mom's gift
from my sister-in-law,

902
00:49:58,330 --> 00:50:00,070
but it doesn't suit my mom.

903
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:02,040
I was going to sell it online,

904
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:04,510
- but you can have it.
- Okay.

905
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:06,540
Thanks a lot for looking out for me.

906
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:12,850
It's bitter.

907
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:16,020
She's doing just fine.

908
00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:24,590
Did you get her the cheongsimhwan?

909
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,900
Director Seong Jae dropped it off
with some supplements.

910
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:31,530
Seong Jae?

911
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:34,640
Goodbye. Thank you.

912
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:38,210
Is he her boyfriend or what?

913
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:40,880

919
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:11,140
Hello, I'm Lee Ji Hyuk.

920
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:40,670
Ji Wan, can you play something else?

921
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,240
Oh, I forgot.

922
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:44,140
I played this
on my way to pick you up.

923
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:46,540
Thanks.

924
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:48,310
Sure.

925
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,780
Yeong Ra.
You don't have to go anywhere today.

926
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:53,350
After I drop you off,

927
00:51:53,350 --> 00:51:55,850
can I run some errands
for 3 or 4 hours?

928
00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:57,820
I don't know.

929
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:00,520
There's no guarantee
Mom won't want to see me.

930
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:02,490
Is that a no?

931
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:04,630
I'm saying I don't know.

932
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:09,500
Why doesn't your mother
give a heads-up?

933
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:11,000
You're a grown woman.

934
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:13,970
She gives me
something to do out of the blue...

935
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:15,470
for my sake.

936
00:52:15,770 --> 00:52:17,010
Whatever.

937
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:19,810
I have something important to do,

938
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,680
so I'll do it after I drop you off.

939
00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:23,610
Don't I have a life too?

940
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:25,950
I work from 9 to 9,
get 50 minutes for lunch,

941
00:52:25,950 --> 00:52:26,980
and work weekends too.

942
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,050
I get one weekday off a week.

943
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:30,990
I can't see my friends at all.

944
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:33,990
I guess not.

945
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:36,320
You never go anywhere.

946
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:38,990
I know your exhibition's coming up.

947
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,230
Isn't it suffocating?

948
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:42,830
It's not.

949
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:44,330
How come?

950
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:46,270
Don't you want to see your friends?

951
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:48,370
Not really.

952
00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:55,140
Just because everyone else
spends time with friends,

953
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:56,680
it doesn't mean
it's the right thing to do.

954
00:52:58,050 --> 00:52:59,280
There are exceptions...

955
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:01,880
and special circumstances, you see.

956
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:05,190
Do you need a reason
to see a friend?

957
00:53:05,590 --> 00:53:07,690
A friend is just a friend.

958
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:12,460
You must have friends.

959
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:16,800
The definition of "friend"
depends on the person.

960
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:19,630
My gosh. You're so frustrating.

961
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:23,610
Ji Wan. Focus on the road.

962
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:56,870
I'm off.

963
00:54:00,110 --> 00:54:01,380
Ta-da.

964
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:04,110
I wore this on my 1st date
with my 1st boyfriend...

965
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:05,380
back in high school.

966
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:06,920
Isn't it cute?

967
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:09,080
Then...

968
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:11,020
if I put on the overalls,

969
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:13,390
which I've liked
since I was little...

970
00:54:27,870 --> 00:54:30,070
Hi, Su Bin.
You're eating something delicious.

971
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:32,210
Hurry and come here, Seong Jae.

972
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:35,880
Here. This is delicious chocolate.

973
00:54:36,110 --> 00:54:38,480
It's chocolate. You're the best.

974
00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:47,690

975
00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:50,760

976
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:55,000
I'll buy you
something more delicious.

977
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:57,200
Let's go.

978

00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:10,410
- My goodness.
- My goodness.

980
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:12,080
- It looks so good.
- It must be delicious.

981
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:13,280
Thank you, Seong Jae.

982
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,850
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

983
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:18,720
Enjoy it.

984
00:55:19,390 --> 00:55:21,220
Seong Jae,
do you like living in the US?

985
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:22,690
I wish I could go there too.

986
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:24,830
Isn't this delicious?

987
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:26,290
- Yes, it's good.
- I like it.

988
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:33,070
This is why Seong Jae thinks of me
as a little kid.

989
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,000
I'd feel the same if I were him.

990
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:41,180
- Su Bin.
- Yes?

991
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,110
What do you think?
Don't I look good?

Hey, Su Bin.

1000
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:21,650
Do you want to meet up?

1001
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:24,120
You told me to call you
if anything happened.

1002
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:27,590
What's wrong?
Did something happen at home?

1003
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:30,260
No. I have something to discuss.

1004
00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:32,290
I'm not asking for a favor.

1005
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:33,560
We need to meet and talk.

1006
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:35,300
Really?

1007
00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:39,700
All right. When do you want to meet?

1008
00:57:04,790 --> 00:57:07,060

- Lee Ji Wan!
- Ji Hyuk.

1014
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:23,380
Come here.

1015
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:29,950
A businessman should look stylish.

1016
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:32,350
When you have
those fancy clothes and shoes,

1017
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,560
why are you wearing the cheap ones?

1018
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:39,530
I was going to wear that
to the investment pitch tomorrow.

1019
00:57:39,530 --> 00:57:40,700
Really?

1020
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:42,800
Do I have the power
to foresee the future?

1021
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:45,130
Ji Wan, how did you bring all these?

1022
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:48,470
I just brought them
without anyone knowing.

1023
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:54,110
You know when to use your brain.
You're useful, Ji Wan.

1024
00:57:54,110 --> 00:57:56,110
It's not like I'm always clumsy.

1025
00:57:56,110 --> 00:57:57,550
By the way, where's the dry cleaner?

1026
00:57:57,550 --> 00:57:59,550
We should have these clothes ironed.

1027
00:57:59,550 --> 00:58:00,580
They got wrinkled on my way here.

1028
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:02,050
It's okay. I'll take care of it.

1029

that I have to do something.

1030

1031
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:08,790
You'll be really surprised
if you find this out.

1032
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:11,660
I even got you a car.

- Please take good care of him.
- Okay. Bye.

1046
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:57,970
He's very polite.

1047
00:58:58,040 --> 00:58:59,440
He's nothing like his brother.

1048
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:01,680
I saw a car outside,
and I wondered whose it was.

1049
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:09,520
I handwashed the car.

1050
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:13,590
Thank you.
I'm really glad that you did this.

1051
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:17,560
By the way, I have
something important to do today.

1052
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:19,830
I should get going.

I always have to be on standby.

1054
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:23,430
Right. By the way, Ji Wan...

1055
00:59:23,430 --> 00:59:24,470
Come on.

1056
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:26,770
See you.

It's all good now.

1060
00:59:37,850 --> 00:59:39,550
I'll pay Eun Oh on time.

1061
00:59:39,550 --> 00:59:41,120

01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:19,950
What is he doing?

1077
01:01:39,970 --> 01:01:42,140
(About interior design)

1078
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:45,710
(Beyond simple structural beauty)

1079
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:51,310
(DIY interior design)

1080
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,720
(Pinus koraiensis, a resilient tree
thriving in harsh environments)

1081
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:57,250
(Wood: raw material for pulp
and construction)

1082
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:02,560
It's no business.

1083
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:03,660
He's just bluffing.

1084
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:05,330
Business is no joke.

1085
01:02:05,330 --> 01:02:06,960
He can't launch that
and a site in two months.

1086
01:02:07,530 --> 01:02:09,960
If he were that capable,
he'd have become a CEO long ago.

1087
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:11,470
Why did he work in an office?

1088
01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:21,780
If I'm around...

1089
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:24,280
If I'm in your space,

1090
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:27,550
will that kill you?

1091
01:02:28,850 --> 01:02:29,980
I will die.

1092
01:03:47,530 --> 01:03:50,430
(Our Golden Days)

1093
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:53,630
It feels like the feisty Lee Ji Hyuk
has made his comeback.

1094
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:55,640
I'll invest in Mamdaerozip.

1095
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:56,840
Don't you think it's a bluff?

1096
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:58,440
Why would you care about that
when you run a business?

1097
01:03:58,640 --> 01:03:59,640
Let's go, Seong Jae.

1098
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:02,140
Linking arms is no big deal
between us.

1099
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:03,540
Why does he keep nagging?

1100
01:04:04,150 --> 01:04:05,750
How dare he lecture me?

1101
01:04:05,850 --> 01:04:07,520
Why do you keep criticizing
what I do?

1102
01:04:07,650 --> 01:04:10,650
Ji Eun Oh, I might be someone
you resent forever,

1103
01:04:10,650 --> 01:04:11,950
but you're still
simply Ji Eun Oh to me.

1104
01:04:12,450 --> 01:04:14,120
Eun Oh, are you all right?

1105
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:17,430
If you don't give me the money,
you'll be kicked out of this house.

1106
01:04:17,690 --> 01:04:20,730
Ji Eun Oh, whose child are you
to be this shameless?

1107
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:22,730
Who are your real parents?

1108
01:04:23,830 --> 01:04:25,830
