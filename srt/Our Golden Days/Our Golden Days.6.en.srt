00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,980
(Episode 6)

2
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:14,550
Come with me for now.

3
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,310
Bo A, someone keeps texting you.

4
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:41,680
It's from Oh Hui Kyeong.

5
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,320
She's a friend
who recently got married...

6
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,650
and went to Australia
for her honeymoon.

7
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:46,790
Can you excuse me?

8
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:48,390
I'll take that.

9
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:53,020
Bo A, I'm in Melbourne.

10
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,030
Isn't this Seo Jae Uk,
the one working as a welder?

11
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,750
I'll get going, then.

12
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,190
Oh, no.

13
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:36,400
What's going on?

14
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:43,640
Check the text you got.

15
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:49,710
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:51,380
I have to go to him.

17
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,220
I just found out where he is.

18
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,920
I'm sorry, Ji Hyuk.

19
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,810
Honey, something must be up.

20
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,940
Where are the bride's parents going?

21
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,680
Is Bo A sick?

22
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,280
Su Bin, get me Ji Wan.

23
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:25,820
Don't just sit there,

24
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,890
and find out what's going on.

25
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:29,090
All right.

26
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,890
We must apologize to the guests...

27
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,560
who attended the wedding today.

28
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,690
It has been canceled...

29
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,030
due to personal reasons.

30
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,370
What on earth am I hearing?

31
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,090
CEO Jung Ho Yeong
extends his apologies.

32
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,560
You should head home right away.

33
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,800
You should at least tell us
what happened to the bride.

34
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:16,000
The wedding certainly
can't continue at this point,

35
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,700
but he'll let you know
the reason later.

36
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,770
Look here.

37
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:22,110
What are we going
to tell our guests?

38
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,150
Just say it concerns
the bride's health.

39
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,120
But...

40
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,790
What on earth is going on?

41
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,190
Is the bride sick?

42
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,190
Or are we supposed to lie
that she's sick?

43
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,760
Su Bin.

44
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,530
Take Ji Hyuk's car...

45
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,400
and drive Mom, Dad,
and Grandma home.

46
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,800
We should hear from Ji Hyuk first.

47
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,830
What happened to Bo A?

48
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,400
Look, the bride ran away.

49
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,800
What?

50
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,770
What are you two whispering about?

51
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:54,940
Let me in on it.

52
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,670
It's nothing, Grandma.

53
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,680
So, get the others home quickly.

54
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,510
Don't let them be humiliated here.

55
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,410
I need to clean up this mess
with Seong Jae.

56
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,420
I'll see you later.

57
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,080
- Got it.
- What was that?

58
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,290
Grandma.

59
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,390
- Mom, Dad.
- Yes?

60
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,490
Let's go home.

61
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,120
How can we leave like this?

62
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,260
We should get some answers first.

63
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,190
We need to hurry home for now.
Please, Mom. Dad.

64
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,100
We should know what's going on.

65
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,660
Get Ji Hyuk over here.

66
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,670
He's not here.

67
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,030
I'll tell you why
on the way home, Dad.

68
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:23,030
Please.

69
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,570
Let's find out
what's going on first.

70
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,270
Let's go home, Dad.
Please? Let's go.

71
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,610
- What's going on?
- The bride ran away.

72
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,210
- What?
- The bride ran away?

73
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:35,780
- I heard people chatting outside.
- Okay.

74
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,850
She went to her ex-boyfriend.

75
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,620
Oh, dear.

76
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,720
- Tell me about it.
- It's shameful for both families.

77
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,760
Try calling him. Go on.

78
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,530
What on earth is going on?

79
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,130
- Poor Ji Hyuk.
- This is awful.

80
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:52,300
Isn't he picking up?

81
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,970
Guests,

82
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,370
the food has already been prepared,

83
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,970
so please stay and enjoy your meal.

84
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,010
Are you kidding me?

85
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,890
What's going on?

86
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,890
Get some rest here.

87
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,130
I'll go back and clean things up.

88
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,850
Unbelievable.

89
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,620
Did the bride run away?

90
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,820
It serves you right, Lee Ji Hyuk.

91
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,690
I knew it.

92
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,140
Loser.

93
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:16,510
Unbelievable.
Can this be more annoying?

94
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,020
Su Bin, tell us what's going on.

95
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,290
What happened today?

96
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:29,090
Well...

97
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,800
Su Bin, tell us what you know
right now.

98
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,840
Bo A must've been seeing
another guy.

99
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,540
What?

100
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,410
"Ji Hyuk, I'm sorry."

101
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:43,570
"I have to go to him."

102
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,080
She sent a text like that.

103
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,780
To Ji Hyuk's phone.

104
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,310
Who is she going to?

105
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,580
I don't understand
a word you just said.

106
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:54,390
It doesn't seem like
she and Ji Hyuk dated.

107
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,590
Was he marrying a girl
he wasn't even dating?

108
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:58,860
Why?

109
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,190
(My eldest son)

110
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:07,770
The receiver can't come
to the phone right now.

111
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:09,400
Please call again.

112
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:56,150
- You're here.
- Yes, good to see you.

113
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,250
Yes, that's right.

114
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,320
Thank you!

115
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:03,650
After the wedding,
there will be a party...

116
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,520
for the former and current members
of Value of Hangyeol.

117
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,860
- No, not like that.
- Come on.

118
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,800
- Come here, then.
- Hey, seriously...

119
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,860
Eun Oh, you're here.

120
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,300
- Hey.
- Hi, Eun Oh.

121
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,070
How did you get in here?

122
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,970
Su Jeong gave us
the lock combination.

123
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,140
- That's right.
- I see.

124
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,170
Hey, Eun Oh.

125
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:22,010
- How many tables should we set up?
- Well...

126
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,510
Six will do.

127
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,140
Why did you get here so fast?

128
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,610
- Bring that here.
- Hey!

129
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,920
- Hello.
- Hi.

130
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,280
- Have you been well?
- Hi.

131
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,020
- It's been a while.
- It's good to see you.

132
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,220
Hello.

133
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,890
- Just a second.
- I got this.

134
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,360
- Come to the front, please.
- You made it.

135
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,460
- Hey.
- Hey.

136
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:41,890
I see you prepared quite the party.

137
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:44,130
It only takes a few seconds
for 20-somethings.

138
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:46,100
- Should we sit there?
- Sounds good.

139
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,270
- No way.
- You made it.

140
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,270
- Hello!
- Wait.

141
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,270
- Please sit over here.
- Yes?

142
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,300
Hyeon Su.

143
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,570
Do you think
we can be doing this today?

144
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,540
Then do you want
to throw all this away?

145
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,940
Well...

146
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:02,080
I don't think this is the time
for us to wine and dine here.

147
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,480
This is why we like you, Eun Oh.

148
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,280
No one hates you, you know?

149
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:08,490
What?

150
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,050
You know what?

151
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,760
When someone
experiences a misfortune,

152
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,860
not everyone needs to worry.

153
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,300
And people
won't just worry about it.

154
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Sometimes,
curiosity can surpass worry.

155
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,670
I'm not sure
what you're talking about.

156
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,810
I mean,
that's what life is all about.

157
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,210
It's no big deal.

158
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:34,050
- But how...
- The thing is...

159
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,550
- Hello.
- Hello.

160
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,580
- Hello.
- Please have a seat here.

161
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,120
Have a seat.

162
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,210
(Jung Bo A)

163
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:02,440
(I just found out where he is.)

164
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,670
(I'm sorry, Ji Hyuk.)

165
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,730
This is really good.

166
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,660
Eun Oh, have a seat.

167
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,100
Right. Let's drink. Come here.

168
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,270
I'm the manager here. I should work.

169
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:34,870
Maybe Jung Bo A's father
gave him money or something.

170
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:36,270
About a year ago,

171
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,340
the man vanished without a trace,

172
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,840
so Jung Bo A gave up on him.

173
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,580
In the meantime,
her father pushed for the marriage.

174
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,820
Eun Oh, you must know.

175
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,290
How did Ji Hyuk and Bo A
end up together?

176
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,520
I don't know.

177
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,560
- Su Jeong.
- What?

178
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,090
By the way, how do you all know...

179
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,060
about Ji Hyuk's runaway bride?

180
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,300
Well...

181
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,900
Back in college, we renovated...

182
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,700
Edel Orphanage,
the largest orphanage in Cheongpo.

183
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,100
It was a huge project
involving six universities in Seoul.

184
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,410
Back then,
Bo A and a guy from the orphanage...

185
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:11,110
fell in love,
which caused quite a stir.

186
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,310
So, does that mean
Ji Hyuk and Bo A...

187
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:16,780
kept in touch after that?

188
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,950
I don't know.

189
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,850
You know, Ji Hyuk isn't the type...

190
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,620
- to talk about his personal life.
- That's true.

191
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:23,690
What is Ji Hyuk doing?

192
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,890
- Call him.
- He's not answering.

193
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,940
The bride had acute appendicitis.
It couldn't be helped.

194
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,810
Hey, I have to go.

195
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,510
Ji Hyuk.

196
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,040
What do you think you're doing?

197
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,480
How could you
mess things up like this?

198
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,320
Mom and Dad are calling the guests
to apologize...

199
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,350
and return the cash gifts.

200
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,860
I'm sorry.

201
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,500
Yes. I'm sorry.

202
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,630
Send me your bank account number.

203
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:09,870
No.

204
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,740
I don't know when he'll have
another wedding ceremony.

205
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,270
Ji Hyuk is home.

206
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,110
Send me a text.

207
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,120
You fool!

208
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,220
I'm sorry.

209
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:31,060
I put you two
in such an awkward spot. I'm sorry.

210
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,620
"Awkward?"

211
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:34,530
Did you just say an awkward spot?

212
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,560
Honey, let him explain
the whole story first.

213
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,830
Sit, Ji Hyuk.

214
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,710
Hey.

215
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:57,450
Is it true that the bride went back
to her ex-boyfriend?

216
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:58,850
Did you two never actually date?

217
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:01,950
No.

218
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,790
My goodness.

219
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,990
Then...

220
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,960
Then why did you decide
to marry her?

221
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:12,030
We both needed this marriage.

222
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,200
You needed it?

223
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:17,130
What do you mean?

224
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:20,470
I guess she tried to forget
her ex-boyfriend and move on.

225
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,870
What about you?
Why did you need her?

226
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,880
Because she's the daughter
of Haneul Construction's CEO.

227
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:29,410
What? Because she's the daughter
of Haneul Construction's CEO?

228
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,950
My goodness.

229
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,550
What's that supposed to mean?

230
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:36,720
Are you saying
you wanted to marry her for money...

231
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:39,290
because she came from a rich family,

232
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,790
when you didn't even love her
or date her?

233
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,800
I believe marriage is something
you do out of necessity.

234
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,430
That's what I believe.

235
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,070
Ji Hyuk.

236
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,000
You crazy fool!

237
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,770
He should just say sorry
and beg for forgiveness.

238
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,140
Why is he being like this?

239
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,580
My goodness.

240
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:59,810
Is Ji Hyuk home?

241
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,410
How did things go
at the wedding hall?

242
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,820
Seong Jae and I took care of it.

243
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:08,520
You are not in your right mind.

244
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,590
Do you even hear yourself?

245
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,090
Are you out of your mind?

246
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:17,260
How could you think of marrying
someone for money as a man?

247
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:21,630
You always tell me about things
I shouldn't do as a man.

248
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,830
But these days,
you don't have to be...

249
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,370
the breadwinner
just because you're a man.

250
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,540
Times have changed
since your generation.

251
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,610
People in my generation...

252
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,940
don't believe they have to marry
someone they love,

253
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,310
and they don't see marriage
as a necessity.

254
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,180
You and your pathetic excuses again.

255
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,880
Are you blaming the times again?

256
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,220
Do you think things were easy
for my generation?

257
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:42,790
We were a lot poorer...

258
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,790
and had a harder time
than you do now.

259
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,390
I wanted to live a good life.

260
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,160
Growing old together
with someone I love?

261
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,400
The role and sacrifice
of the head of the household?

262
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:57,400
For someone like me, who grew up
struggling just to support myself,

263
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,840
it sounds like
a story from a different world.

264
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,010
That's why
I didn't want to get married.

265
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:03,170
If I were alone,
I could live a decent life.

266
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,740
But then,
this opportunity came to me.

267
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,680
That's why I made such a decision.

268
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,580
What? So, are you...

269
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:17,420
blaming us, your parents,
for not being born...

270
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,560
with a silver spoon in your mouth?

271
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,720
That's not what I meant!

272
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,730
That's exactly what you are saying!

273
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,830
Fine. You've got such a big head.

274
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,970
So, did you try
to marry for money...

275
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,670
just to raise your children
in an affluent family?

276
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,600
Yes, I did.

277
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,710
I didn't want to live a shabby life,

278
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,740
and I didn't want my children
to grow up poor.

279
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,380
I don't want to live a life...

280
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:42,280
where I can't give my children
what they want,

281
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,580
always worrying about rent...

282
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,880
and their academy fees.

283
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,850
I don't want to live
constantly worrying about...

284
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,490
when I'll get laid off from work.

285
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,990
So that's what you're saying.

286
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,520
You are blaming me now.

287
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,390
I'm not blaming you.
That's just how my life has been.

288
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,060
Yes.

289
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,630
I know you've done your best.

290
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,030
With your modest income,

291
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,700
you had to support Grandfather
through his 20 years of illness.

292
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,840
I know you worked really hard...

293
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,640
to take care of Grandmother
with dementia and raise three kids.

294
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,180
But you know what?

295
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,250
I didn't want to live like that.

296
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,220
That's how I felt.

297
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,620
So don't ask me...

298
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,520
why I'm not trying to live like you.

299
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:29,590
You will...

300
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,660
never understand my generation.

301
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,300
Like me? Live like me?

302
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,740
I didn't tell you to live like me!

303
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,870
If you didn't want to live like me,

304
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,540
you should've stayed single...

305
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,240
like you always said!

306
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:46,310
You shouldn't have sold yourself off
for money, you fool!

307
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,980
Honey, that was a bit harsh.

308
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,280
That's not harsh at all.

309
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,020
What is the other excuse?

310
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,790
Choice.

311
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,120
What?

312
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:02,890
It was my choice.

313
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,630
Things didn't go well today,

314
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,660
and I caused you a lot of trouble.

315
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,370
For that, I'm truly sorry.
I really am.

316
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,410
But...

317
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:18,240
if I had another chance like this,

318
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,950
I would make the same choice again.

319
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,480
My gosh.

320
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,290
Ji Hyuk.

321
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:30,790
Why did you turn out like this?

322
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,520
I don't think
this is how I raised you.

323
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,030
If you believe your life is right,

324
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,230
then just keep believing it.

325
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,370
But don't force your children
to agree with you.

326
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,540
What did you just say?

327
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,970
It's just that
our values are different.

328
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,240
You're trapped
in old-fashioned thinking.

329
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,880
So you two will never...

330
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,320
understand my choice.

331
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,450
You keep insisting
that you did the right thing!

332
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,690
Ji Hyuk must be out of his mind.

333
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,860
I understand how he feels.

334
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,290
That's reality.

335
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:10,490
What?

336
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,600
I also don't want to live
struggling to make ends meet.

337
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:15,970
I want to live
with my head held high.

338
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:18,170
Isn't it natural
that you want to enjoy a life...

339
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,440
- that others envy?
- Hey.

340
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,210
Ji Hyuk doesn't even seem
human to me.

341
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:22,440
I'm really disappointed.

342
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,210
Don't you think we, of all people,
should understand him?

343
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,340
Ji Hyuk is the victim here.

344
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:29,410
Why are you disappointed
when you didn't do anything for him?

345
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,850
Do you not remember
when we were little?

346
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,890
He gave us allowances
from his part-time job in college...

347
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:36,520
and kept it up
even after he got a full-time job.

348
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,990
I don't want to take his side
just because he gave me something.

349
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:42,130
I mean, he turned the whole house
upside down.

350
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:51,970
Do you have anything more to say?

351
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:56,640
What more can I say?
It's just a waste of energy.

352
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:01,880
My great son says
he has no regret at all...

353
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:05,720
even after messing things up
like this.

354
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,820
Ji Hyuk.

355
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:13,120
What are you going to do now?

356
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,630
It seems like
you already quit your job.

357
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,760
I'll move out
and live alone for a while.

358
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,730
Of course, you will!

359
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:22,670
Were you going to stay here
after causing all this trouble?

360
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:23,800
What kind of human
could do such a thing?

361
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,970
Honey.

362
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:28,010
Even if you'd wanted to stay,
I was going to kick you out.

363
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,480
I'll be in my room.

364
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,980
Grandma. Let's go to your room.

365
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,650
Get out this instant!

366
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,890
Ji Hyuk, you can't leave like this
after saying all that.

367
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,530
What am I supposed to say, then?

368
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,170
Is there a correct answer
for this situation?

369
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,930
Like saying, "It's all my fault?"

370
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,970
Of course, you have to say that.

371
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,400
I did apologize.

372
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:02,870
I do feel bad...

373
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:04,710
that I brought shame on them.

374
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,340
That's all I can say.

375
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,810
But that's not my fault.

376
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:11,580
You tried to marry for money
and disgraced our family.

377
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,120
And it's not your fault?

378
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,920
I should get changed.
Get out, both of you.

379
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,950
Ji Hyuk!

380
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:18,660
Get out.

381
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,460
Let's go.

382
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,830
Just go.

383
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,740
Mom, Dad. Ji Hyuk
just packed his stuff and left.

384
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,980
You don't have to tell me that.

385
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,380
I told him to leave.

386
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,080
Mom, is Dad going out
to stop Ji Hyuk?

387
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,780
Hello, sir.

(Maehwa Subok Rice Wine)

389
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,220
If you believe your life is right,

390
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:27,890
then just keep believing it.

391
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:30,560
But don't force your children
to agree with you.

392
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,300
I wanted to live a good life.

393
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,290
(A place where
your enjoyable journey begins)

394
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,360
Give me the earliest bus ticket,
no matter the destination.

395
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:40,160
(Cafe Agit)

396
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,400
My goodness.

397
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:43,800
- Is it wrong not to do it?
- Yes, for sure.

398
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,700
The club members are having
an after-party.

399
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,610
The senior members called
all the juniors over.

400
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:50,570
Well, I like it.

401
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,410
- He's going to cry.
- Don't cry.

402
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:54,610
- Oh, come on.
- All right.

403
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,750
Gosh, Ji Eun Oh is really something.

404
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,380
She hasn't had a sip of alcohol.

405
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,350
She's the best.

406
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:07,420
I think the old ones
should quietly leave now.

407
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,330
- What?
- Right, we're too old.

408
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:11,030
- Let's go. We should go.
- Let's get going.

409
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,360
Are you leaving?

410
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,670
Don't. Stay seated.

411
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:17,630
- Are you leaving?
- I'll see you later.

412
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,570
- Get home safely.
- Bye, guys.

413
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:21,070
- See you.
- Bye.

414
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,940
- Bye.
- Bye.

415
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,610
All right. Let's wrap things up now.

416
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,310
Hey, we still have some drinks left.

417
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,750
Gosh, it's late.

418
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:36,090
Hey. Let's wrap things up
after listening to Eun Oh, then.

419
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:38,420
- Okay. Let's do that.
- Eun Oh, come here.

420
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:40,690
Why?

421
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,660
Hey, tell us about Ji Hyuk's story.

422
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,160
You two are best friends.

423
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,330
You have Ji Hyuk's number.

424
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:50,570
Just call him and ask yourself.
This is underhanded.

425
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:52,400
What?

426
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,980
Still not done blowing off steam?

427
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:04,950
It sounds like you've already said
all you can to gossip about him.

428
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:09,050
Hey, it's not like I'm doing this
because I hate Ji Hyuk...

429
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:11,760
- Gosh, stop it already.
- Hey. I just wanted to ask...

430
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,360
Let's wrap things up here!

431
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,160
Jun Yeong, Seo Woo.
Let's clean this up. Okay?

432
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,730
- Why...
- Hey, stop. That's enough.

433
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:18,960
- Then...
- Hey, seriously.

434
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,430
- You've had enough.
- Hey.

435
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,170
Do you want Ji Hyuk's number?

436
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:23,730
- What did you say?
- We should get going.

437
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,400
- Why are you...
- Stop it.

438
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,470
We will get going.

439
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:27,870
- Bye, guys!
- Ji Hyuk must be devastated.

440
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:29,910
- All right.
- Let's just go.

441
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:32,040
Eun Oh, please understand.

442
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,510
We're off.

443
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:35,650
- Don't push me.
- Let's just go.

444
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,050
Oh, I got this.

445
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,350
- I'll do it.
- Move aside.

446
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,050
We can't leave the door open
all night.

447
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:44,990
What should we do with the smell?

448
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,660
What is this smell?

449
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:51,960
It smells funny in here.

450
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,500
Mr. Park, how did it go?

451
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,500
What are you doing here?

452
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,230
I thought you would want to know.

453
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,270
You must've been surprised today.

454
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:01,070
I don't want to know.

455
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,910
I'm dying to know.

456
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,050
We are cleaning,
so you should probably go now.

457
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,750
Hey, we can have a drink together.

458
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,920
You said you were thirsty.

459
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,850
Let's do that, Eun Oh.
Just a quick drink.

460
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,020
You two can drink, then.

461
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:19,420
I'm tired today.

462
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:21,160
Eun Oh, what's with you?

463
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,960
Did I do something to upset you?

464
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,500
No. I just...

465
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,470
don't want to hear anything
from Lee Ji Hyuk's friend.

466
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,100
Well... I see.

467
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:40,510
Su Jeong, we have more disinfectant
in the storage room, right?

468
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:42,450
We should wipe the tables again.

469
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,430
No. I just...

470
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:06,300
don't want to hear anything
from Lee Ji Hyuk's friend.

471
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,680

472
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,330

Hey, Lee Sang Cheol!

477
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,790
Why aren't you answering the phone?

478
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,730
Is that you?

479
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:07,160
Of course, it's me.

480
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,500
I've been looking
all over town for you.

481
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,600
I was going to come halfway up
just in case,

482
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:16,270
but then I saw the flashlight here,
so I called you.

483
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:19,710
I'm sorry I worried you.

484
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,780
Gosh, you reek of alcohol.

485
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:26,350
Did you drink the whole thing?

486
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,790
I guess I did.

487
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,390
Were you going
to kill yourself or what?

488
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,160
You're not a ghost, are you?

489
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,990
You're
the living Lee Sang Cheol, right?

490
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:39,460
Darn it.

491
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,830
- My gosh.
- What?

492
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,340
Honey.

493
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:52,880
Da Jeong.

494
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:54,810
I thought...

495
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,750
Ji Hyuk would apologize.

496
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,680
I thought he'd say he was wrong.

497
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,360
I'm sure...

498
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,000
he was too embarrassed to apologize.

499
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:17,130
If he...

500
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:19,840
Had he apologized,

501
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:23,840
I would've given him two pats
on the back and hugged him.

502
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:29,250
"Why did you make
a mistake like that?"

503
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:32,920
"Your pride must've been wounded."

504
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,950
"It must've been hard for you."

505
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:37,920
I was going to tell him...

506
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:42,260
that this would pass
and that it wasn't a big deal.

507
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:45,600
That darn brat.

508
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:47,660
What a jerk.

509
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:50,470
My gosh.

510
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:52,570
Are you crying?

511
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,240
Is Lee Sang Cheol crying?

512
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,010
Don't cry, honey.

513
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:03,780
That brat, Lee Ji Hyuk.
He's got another thing coming.

514
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,920
Darn him. My goodness.

515
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,890

521

How long are you going to stay?

522

Three days.

523
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:19,190
Once again,
I opened my eyes in the morning.

524
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:24,890
I woke up in the morning again.

525
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:32,570
Mother.

526
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:39,410
A few days without food
won't kill this old woman.

527
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,680
I'm not eating.

528
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:45,780
Mother.

529
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,880
You must eat.

530
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:51,720
Can't you eat
for the sake of your son?

531
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,770
It's been three days,

532
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,910
but we haven't heard from him.

533
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:14,040
Don't even bother caring whether
he's dead or alive somewhere.

534
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:17,780
He's my eldest grandson!

535
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,780
I don't care how angry you are.
How dare you be that cruel?

537
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:26,260
As of today,
Ji Wan is your eldest grandson.

538
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,030
This wasn't supposed to happen,

539
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:32,700
nor should it have.

540
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,700
He walked out thinking
he'd made the right decision,

541
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,130
and I don't plan
on letting him back in.

542
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:40,540
So don't worry yourself
over this, Mother.

Go about your lives.

that's not worth our concern.

- Hey!
- See?

549
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:17,670
I knew it.

550
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:20,440

Darn it.

He's fine.

557
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:36,360
How can you go three days
without eating anything...

558
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,960
or ordering food?

559
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,830
I thought you had killed yourself!

560
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:42,000
You shouldn't be doing this here.

Even now, I'm still worried.

563
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:47,340
There's no light in his eyes,

564
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,640
and he looks utterly defeated.

565
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:49,970
I can't take this anymore.

570
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,050
He has no idea
how much time has passed.

571
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:03,350
I'll refund you for the day,
so get out.

713
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:10,480
I'm not crying because I'm sad.

714
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,280
I know.

715
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,950
You are crying
because you can't get over him.

716
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,290
Darn it.

717
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:18,890
Still,

718
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,460
I don't need you
to set me up on a blind date.

719
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,890
(Seonsim Hospital)

720
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:31,800
Yeong Ra, this isn't something
you should be so stubborn about.

721
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,540
You have no idea...

722
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:36,040
how terrified I was.

723
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,580
Not just anyone
can enter this VIP room.

724
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:44,750
I'll stay here
until we get a new driver.

725
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,550
I said I'd drive you
and pick you up.

726
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:52,390
How are you going to protect me?

727
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:55,890
So, I told you to use my driver.

728
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:59,360
Honey, that's the last thing
I want to do.

729
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,530
I hate it when you don't separate
personal matters from business.

730
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:06,030
That just ruins
your reputation at work.

731
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:08,070
Using the company driver
for personal use.

732
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,240
Then, as Yeong Ra says,

733
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,810
we should keep her here
until we find a new driver.

734
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:15,840
That's not a good idea.

735
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:19,280
She has already wasted
a lot of time in the hospital.

736
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,780
She can't waste more time
before the exhibition.

737
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:25,690
I'll drive her around.

738
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:27,390
You could be in danger too.

739
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:29,890
He intentionally hurt Mr. Jung...

740
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:32,330
and tried to kidnap Yeong Ra.

741
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:35,760
Seong Jae.

742
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:38,930
Hey.

743
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:42,040
I'm glad you're here.

744
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,770
I need you to make a wise decision,
like Solomon's judgment.

745
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:45,970
Solomon?

746
00:46:46,610 --> 00:46:49,610
Yeong Ra has to be back
at her art studio starting tomorrow,

747
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:51,510
and I was going to take her.

748
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:53,150
However, your father suggested...

749
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:54,950
that the company chauffeur
drive her,

750
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:56,720
which is considered personal use.

751
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:58,020
You have to admit that's wrong.

752
00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:01,390
Haven't you been able
to hire a new driver for her?

753
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:03,090
There are a few candidates,

754
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:06,090
but one of them
could be the stalker.

755
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:09,460
Since we're terrified,

756
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:12,570
we want to hire someone
after a thorough background check.

757
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:15,370
It's a shame that every applicant
seems to have shortcomings.

758
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:20,810
Why don't I take care of her
for the time being?

759
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:23,010
You?

760
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:26,850
You must be busy with your own work.

761
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:28,620
We have no choice.

762
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:30,220
I'll look for someone
within my circle.

763
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:32,850
Sure.

764
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:34,420
Thanks, Seong Jae.

765
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,210
What kind of favor made you come...

766
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:52,570
all the way here
instead of just calling me?

767
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,450
Did something happen
to your parents?

768
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:00,550
No.

769
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:02,920
It's for me, actually.

770
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:04,650
My gosh.

771
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:06,390
What do you need?

772
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:09,260
Seong Jae, can you appear
on my YouTube channel?

773
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:10,960
I'll make sure
your face doesn't show.

774
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,760
You know what?

775
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:17,000
Drink my coffee too
and get home safely.

776
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:18,070
Hold on.

777
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:21,940
You can't leave
without hearing me out.

778
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:23,710
You should ask a favor
from someone...

779
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:25,640
who can actually say yes.

780
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:26,940
I hate doing things like that.

781
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:29,810
I'm putting together
a boyfriend wardrobe,

782
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,480
and you're my best pick to model it.

783
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:32,650
A wardrobe for boyfriends?

784
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:36,720
Su Bin,
you're not thinking straight.

785
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:39,620
There must be a lot of men
in their 20s around you.

786
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:41,690
I chose you for a reason.

787
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:42,720
I won't do it.

788
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:43,830
Come on.

789
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,630
How could you?

790
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:50,500
If you cared about my parents,

791
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:53,040
you wouldn't say no.

792
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:55,170
How could you?

793
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:00,780
Unbelievable.

794
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,850
By the way, how are your parents?

795
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:08,350
As if I need to spell it out.

796
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:11,650
I really need to make it now
and save my family from drowning.

797
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:13,860
Darn.

798
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,090
Ji Hyuk's gone,

799
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:18,230
Dad's job offer was canceled,

800
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:20,360
and Ji Wan's out of a job.

801
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:22,800
Why's Ji Wan out of a job?

802
00:49:23,330 --> 00:49:24,700
Did he quit?

803
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:25,870
Yes.

804
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:28,670
It's been a while.

805
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:31,110
But...

806
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:33,140
Mom and Dad don't know yet.

807
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,780
This is the situation
my family's in, Seong Jae.

808
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:42,420
Just this once.

809
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,290
Hey, Seong Jae. What's up?

810
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:48,860
I heard you quit your job.

811
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:51,460
Can we meet up?

812
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:16,320
Unbelievable.

813
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:21,060
(March 2023)

814
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:25,830
This isn't bad.

815
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,070
Why did you toss this out
when it's actually good?

816
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:32,070
Well...

817
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:36,340
Ji Hyuk, don't say
useless things like that.

818
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:38,570
That's it, Ji Eun Oh.

819
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:40,180
You know your place, don't you?

820
00:50:41,110 --> 00:50:43,380
Here I was, worrying you might think
it's actually good.

821
00:50:47,450 --> 00:50:48,620
Leave if you're only going
to tease me.

822
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,330
This will help.

823
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,360
What's this?

824
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:17,410
Ji Hyuk...

825
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,350
Keep at it.

826
00:51:37,530 --> 00:51:38,530
Strike that.

827
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,470
You're going to do well.

828
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:43,140
You're that strong
when you apply yourself to things.

829
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:12,370
This is a problem.

830
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:19,610
(Colored pencils)

831
00:52:19,610 --> 00:52:20,780
(Colored pencils)

832
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,080
Excuse me.

833
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:24,480
I heard you did interior design.

834
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:26,410
Yes, that's right.

835
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,650
Does that include studio apartments?
How much would that cost?

836
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,590
Can you email me...

837
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:32,090
the floor plan and budget?

838
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:33,720
I can't do a consultation right now.

839
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:34,890
Let me give you my business card.

840
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:38,690
I don't need your service right now.
I was just curious.

841
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:41,760
- Have a good day.
- Bye.

842
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:48,570
What is it?

843
00:52:49,170 --> 00:52:51,240
I hadn't realized it
while working on other things,

844
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:52,610
but more customers...

845
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:54,880
have started stopping by
to watch what I'm doing.

846
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:56,580
You must feel interrupted.

847
00:52:57,050 --> 00:52:58,580
That must be tough
for the Queen of Focus.

848
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:02,580
I should raise the screen
as a partition.

849
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:03,920
Yes.

850
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:07,920
That solves your problem,

851
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:09,820
so I'm off to solve mine.

852
00:53:11,090 --> 00:53:12,330
Is there an issue you must handle?

853
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:13,600
Yes, my hair.

854
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:17,330
I told you
I was going on a blind date.

855
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:18,630
I booked
a hair coloring appointment.

856
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:22,870
- What about me?
- What about you?

857
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:24,740
I want to go on a blind date too.

858
00:53:25,810 --> 00:53:26,810
Really?

859
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:28,310
For real?

860
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:31,080
I was waiting for you
to ask me first.

861
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,950
Su Jeong, why won't you
set me up with anyone?

862
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:36,280
Hey. Seriously.

863
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:38,850
You're a funny one.

864
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:41,490
Tell me. What's gotten into you?

865
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:44,560
My mom, actually.

866
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:47,730
Nice. Let's go as far as we can.

867
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:51,070
Hey, let's come up
with a detailed plan.

868
00:53:51,070 --> 00:53:53,200
- How so?
- I'll put together...

869
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,600
a list of about 17 guys,

870
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:56,640
so sift through them.

871
00:53:56,910 --> 00:53:59,170
Do you have that many male friends?

872
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:00,510
Goodness.

873
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:02,880
I might've made more friends
if I hadn't always been stuck...

874
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,450
at the cafe because of you.

875
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,150
It is easier to get over someone...

876
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:11,520
by seeing someone else.

877
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:14,390
Why sift through them
when I can meet them all?

878
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:17,360
Until construction starts,
I'll see two guys a week.

879
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:18,560
- Really?
- Yes.

880
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,030
What is it?

881
00:54:22,330 --> 00:54:24,500
He looked a lot like
Director Seong Jae.

882
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:30,570
What do you think he does
when he's bored and not at the cafe?

883
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:32,570
Unbelievable.

884
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:35,540
It took you long enough
to show concern.

885
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:38,080
He used to stop by for coffee
on his way to work,

886
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:40,220
spend an hour at the cafe
during his lunch break,

887
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:42,250
and even come on Saturdays to read,

888
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,590
but he hasn't been around in weeks.

889
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:47,720
Now, I feel guilty.

890
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:51,830
Seong Jae,
I've been curious about something.

891
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:53,330
Can I ask you a question?

892
00:54:53,330 --> 00:54:54,400
(July 2016)

893
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,230
- Sure.
- Why do you...

894
00:54:56,230 --> 00:54:57,700
always say you're bored?

895
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:00,040
Because I don't have a girlfriend.

896
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,070
Look at you.

897
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,510
You're sweet, tall, and handsome.

898
00:55:05,870 --> 00:55:07,410
So why are you always single?

899
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:10,080
I'm not sure.
Is it because I'm too kind?

900
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:11,380
Careful!

901
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:15,320
Seong Jae was born to be bored.

902
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:16,920
Not having hobbies is his hobby.

903
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:18,720
- Here.
- He's right.

904
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:20,290
If you don't let me
hang out with you,

905
00:55:20,890 --> 00:55:22,420
I'll return to the US...

906
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:23,630
after being bored
during my school break.

907
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:24,660
Eun Oh, mind your head.

908
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:26,260
(Value of Hangyeol)

909
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:28,730
Now, I feel bad for you.

910
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:32,400
You know what?
Come over all the time, Seong Jae.

911
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:35,500
Can I really come by all the time?

912
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:37,740
Hey.

913
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:40,340
I was actually quite surprised
by your attitude.

914
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:42,780
Considering the years
you've known each other,

915
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:43,950
wouldn't that make you friends?

916
00:55:44,350 --> 00:55:46,820
Have you only considered him
as a friend of Ji Hyuk's?

917
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:51,590
Of course not. That's not the case.

918
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:54,360
Then why have you not cared?

919
00:55:57,660 --> 00:55:58,660
What?

920
00:55:59,530 --> 00:56:00,530
What is it?

921
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,160
- It's been a while.
- Hey.

922
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:04,100
- How long has it been?
- Good for you.

923
00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:06,530
Here we go.

924
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:08,540
- The van's here.
- Let's go.

925
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:12,270
- Hello.
- Hello.

926
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:13,710
- Hello.
- Goodness.

927
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:15,480
- You.
- Right.

928
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:17,010
- You.
- Thank you.

929
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:18,180
You over there!

930
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:20,180
- Get in, please.
- Goodness.

931
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:21,320
Go on.

932
00:56:21,350 --> 00:56:22,620
- Darn.
- Let's go!

933
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:24,020
Come on, guys.

934
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:25,050
Hurry over here.

935
00:56:37,530 --> 00:56:39,570
- I see you're out here, Director.
- Welcome.

936
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,440
I thought
three people would do today.

937
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,640
- Sure.
- Hello.

938
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:44,670
We need to repair the collapsed wall
behind the building,

939
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:46,740
but too many weeds are in our way.

940
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:48,680
You only need
to pull out weeds today.

941
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:49,710
That's right.

942
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,810
Hi, what's your name?

943
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:57,750
(Edel Orphanage)

944
00:57:14,670 --> 00:57:16,100
They're hard workers.

945
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:17,210
Please do a good job today.

946
00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:18,670
I'm sorry,

947
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:20,540
but I have to go.

948
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:24,480
Is this a joke?

949
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:26,850
You can't line up for a job...

950
00:57:27,150 --> 00:57:29,150
only to quit
once you get to the site.

951
00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:31,490
I have a bad back.

952
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:32,620
Hey!

953
00:57:33,090 --> 00:57:34,490
Can you drive?

954
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:38,160
Yes.

955
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,430
Then, I'd like a favor.

956
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,430
We have to go to Seoul...

957
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:43,500
to get the glass we need
for this place,

958
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:46,030
but our Mr. Kim sprained his ankle.

959
00:57:46,970 --> 00:57:48,300
Seoul?

960
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:51,540
It's for the kids,
so could you do it?

961
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,440
You're getting an easy day of work.

962
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:06,920
Please take a right 100m ahead,
toward Seoul.

963
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:17,670
(Seoul, Cheongpo)

964
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:30,980
Come to the store when I call.

965
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:32,110
Sure.

966
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:41,390
I'm done here.

967
00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:43,420
Right, I'll soon be back.

968
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:46,330
Really?

969
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,100
Good for you.

970
00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:56,240
Of course, I got it.
Don't you know who I am?

971
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:58,910
It was right there,
like it had been waiting for me.

972
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:07,520
Sure, I'll be back soon.

973
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:40,820
Hi, sir.

974
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:02,140
Of course, I got it.
Don't you know who I am?

975
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:04,470
It was right there,
like it had been waiting for me.

976
01:00:07,410 --> 01:00:08,810
You fool.

977
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:12,980
What? What did you just say?

978
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:16,350
What?

979
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,650
I hurt my leg, that's all.

980
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:21,590
Yes, I know that.

981
01:00:21,590 --> 01:00:23,420
So why would you call me a fool?

982
01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:25,590
That's not it.

983
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:30,230
Someone just came to mind.

984
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:51,490
You'll come back
when you hear from the company...

985
01:00:52,450 --> 01:00:53,520
you applied to, won't you?

986
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:01,060
What a fool.

987
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:04,330
Stop the truck.

988
01:01:05,170 --> 01:01:06,900
Stop the truck, you punk!

989
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:09,470
- Stop the truck!
- Wait!

990
01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:21,720
What are you doing?

991
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:22,850
Get out.

992
01:01:24,790 --> 01:01:26,090
What is this?

993
01:01:27,290 --> 01:01:30,060
Do you know how many times
you said "fool" on the way here?

994
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:31,890
Over ten times!

995
01:01:31,890 --> 01:01:33,230
Yet you weren't talking about me?

996
01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:35,800
- Did I say that?
- You psycho!

997
01:01:37,470 --> 01:01:39,530
Darn you!

998
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:07,260
I hate this.

999
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:22,140
Sure. Have a good night.

1000
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,530
Hey, Director.

1001
01:02:39,830 --> 01:02:40,930
Eun Oh.

1002
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:44,500
What...

1003
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,500
do you think of me?

1004
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:57,710
(Our Golden Days)

1005
01:03:57,940 --> 01:04:00,640
I can work any job as long as
the paycheck keeps coming...

1006
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:02,110
until our kids get married.

1007
01:04:02,110 --> 01:04:04,050
Since you're the one asking,

1008
01:04:04,050 --> 01:04:05,950
I'm glad to give you
two months of my time.

1009
01:04:05,950 --> 01:04:07,050
You need to ask your mom...

1010
01:04:07,050 --> 01:04:08,750
before you can tell me
your age? Why?

1011
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:11,320
We've known each other
for nine years now.

1012
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:14,190
I thought I was at least your friend
or an honorary senior.

1013
01:04:14,190 --> 01:04:15,660
Sure, Seong Jae.

1014
01:04:16,390 --> 01:04:18,560
Claim compensation.
It won't be chump change.

1015
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:19,960
At 4 a.m. today,

1016
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,730
the body of a man
in his early 30s...

1017
01:04:21,730 --> 01:04:23,660
was recovered
from Yangsu Reservoir...

1018
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:25,030
I don't want to live like this.

1019
01:04:25,030 --> 01:04:26,770
I don't want my life
to be like this.

1020
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:28,500
No!

1021
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:33,240
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
