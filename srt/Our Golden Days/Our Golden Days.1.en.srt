00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:04,240
(Episode 1)

2
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,060
Whenever I ride with you, Ji Hyuk,
it becomes a race against myself.

3
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,130
We ride for the endorphin boost.

4
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,680
Can't you ride right before me?

5
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,150
The trail is flat from here on.
We can ride together.

6
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,660
Hello, Lee Ji Hyuk speaking.

7
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,860
Mr. Lee, I need you
to come in right now.

8
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,760
- There's an issue.
- What is it?

9
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,200
What did Oh Jae Jin do?

10
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm an hour and a half out. Okay.

11
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,570
What will take an hour and a half?

12
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,380
Half an hour to my car,
an hour to the office.

13
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,450
It's our 300th day today.

14
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,650
- Our 300th day?
- I booked a 1-night stay...

15
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,480
at the Ritz Hotel including dinner.

16
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,120
I meant for it to be a surprise.

17
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,160
That's against our rule.

18
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,960
We agreed
not to celebrate anniversaries.

19
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,430
I planned it because I wanted to.

20
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:35,990
Say you can't come in.

21
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,000
Say you're on Jeju Island.

22
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,230
An important client's involved,

23
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,570
and it's my team's issue.

24
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,070
If you leave now, we're done.

25
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,280
Work aside,
I can't have dinner with you today.

26
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,120
I have plans with my siblings.

27
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,020
Something you planned
with siblings you live with...

28
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,250
is more important
than our 300th-day anniversary?

29
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,250
It is.

30
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,220
I scheduled this with them first,
and we don't do anniversaries.

31
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,890
Even though I made the reservation?

32
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,160
You shouldn't have.

33
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,130
Ji Hyuk.

34
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,370
You still don't plan
to marry me, do you?

35
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,900
I don't plan to marry anyone.

36
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:23,140
Sorry!

37
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,440
(Gogossing)

38
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,280
Sorry! My bad!

39
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:34,420
What the heck is this?
Why am I out here?

40
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,920
I'm really sorry!

41
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:56,670
(KF Company)

42
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,210
Mr. Lee.
What will you do about this?

43
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,480
A container full of stone tiles
measuring 120cm by 60cm...

44
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,450
just arrived at Incheon Port.

45
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,980
The exterior work
starts in two days.

46
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,020
Oh Jae Jin.

47
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,290
You knew we'd changed
some of the exterior tiles.

48
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,260
When you asked me
to confirm the order,

49
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,560
a third of the tiles
were to be 120cm by 40cm.

50
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,060
I gave you the revised plan
that said we'd cut off 20cm.

51
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,630
Haneul Construction kept delaying,

52
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,370
which meant we couldn't put in
the order for materials on time.

53
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,230
So you forgot?

54
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,200
Yes. Completely.

55
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,380
I warned you many times.

56
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,610
Twice is a mistake,
but the third time...

57
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,050
means you're incompetent.

58
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,410
Yes. I remember that.

59
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,250
How much longer
must I put up with this?

60
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,260
Not for much longer.

61
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,330
I'll see what I can do.

62
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,530
Why bother?

63
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,570
No plant can cut the tiles in time.
They're backed up.

64
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,340
I even called
the second factory in Changwon.

65
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,040
You think I didn't even check?

66
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,210
I'm not going
to a stone processing factory.

67
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,440
Where are you going, then?

68
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,840
I'll tell you later.

69
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,580
He's so cold and stiff.

70
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,580
Isn't he?

71
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,820
Stone tiles aren't like tofu.

72
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,390
You can't cut them
with a box cutter...

73
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,560
Yes. I heard you.

74
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,830
- What I meant was...
- Oh Jae Jin.

75
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,500
Get me Haneul Construction's
work schedule.

76
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,230
It's on our team's...

77
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,930
I know it's on the server.
I want a hard copy.

78
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,200
On A4 paper.

79
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,140
Print it out on an A4 sheet.

80
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,680
This time,
make sure it's done right.

81
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,180
Okay?

82
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,280
I told you clearly and many times
before confirming the floor plan...

83
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,880
that an exposed ceiling
works best with retro interior.

84
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,750
And you clearly said no.

85
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,560
Did I say I didn't say no?

86
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:53,160
I changed my mind, Ms. Ji.

87
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:57,430
Then push back the opening to April.

88
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,000
I'll figure out the rest.

89
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,200
That's a no.

90
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:03,130
I sent out the invitations
to the opening,

91
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,470
and I posted...

92
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,640
about the opening event
on social media.

93
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,570
Things might have been different
if you'd told me yesterday.

94
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,280
We're scheduled
to work on the floor on Monday,

95
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,810
and the schedule's packed
after that.

96
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:16,910
Do I have to open a cafe
with an interior I don't like?

97
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,280
Then...

98
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:23,290
how about using paint
that looks like exposed concrete?

99
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:24,490
I can find...

100
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,060
That won't work.

101
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,630
It won't look as natural
as actual concrete.

102
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,260
I'm left with no choice.

103
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,870
We must keep things as they are.

104
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:37,240
You give up too easily
for someone so young.

105
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,500
I'm 30 years old.

106
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:41,170
And you think too little
of design and construction work.

107
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,610
I decided to give
a new company some work,

108
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,380
and the lack of experience shows.

109
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,810
Ma'am. There's no need to be rude.

110
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,850
If you won't fix it,

111
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,750
I won't wire the second payment.

112
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:57,990
Is that why
you didn't pay me yesterday?

113
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:59,760
When the payment was four days late?

114
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,930
What do you say?

115
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:05,100
I have to halt work on the project.

116
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,930
- Until you wire the second payment.
- What?

117
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,600
You will also have to pay...

118
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,300
the increased fees due to...

119
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,010
the delay
caused by refusing to pay on time.

120
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,770
If you stop working now,

121
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,940
I'll hire another company
to finish the job,

122
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,310
then sue you...

123
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,550
for compensation
for refusing to meet the deadline.

124
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,780
Go ahead.

125
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,920
I'll post about you
on all the forums.

126
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,250
I'll mention your company, Eunoism.

127
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,420
Go ahead.

128
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,320
The meeting schedule,
floor plan revision schedule,

129
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,390
payment schedule, detailed invoice,

130
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,730
and detailed work schedule.
I gave you copies of them all.

131
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,930
Oh, and I had to turn down...

132
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,800
another project to take on yours.

133
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,170
You must compensate me for that too.

134
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,370
Ms. Ji.

135
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,410
You shouldn't take
everything I said at face value.

136
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:55,680
Then what? Should I tremble
at your every threat?

137
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,420
My goodness.
When did I threaten you?

138
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,920
I regret my decision so much.

139
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,220
Ms. Ji.

140
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:04,360
CEO Ji. I thought
that if I riled you up,

141
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,420
you'd take care of it somehow.

142
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,730
You worked so hard on this.

143
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,030
Is that so?

144
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,230
I'll forget about...

145
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,300
the exposed concrete ceiling.

146
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,100
- And?
- What?

147
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,110
You must have more to say.

148
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,610
For being rude?

149
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,210
I blurted that out
in frustration and anger.

150
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,550
So what?

151
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,550
I'm sorry.

152
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,520
Shall I stick to the schedule...

153
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,960
and resume the work on Monday?

154
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,730
Yes.

155
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:43,130
If you wire the second payment
that's already late,

156
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,730
I'll resume the work.

157
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,270
My gosh.

158
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,070
I thought she was quiet, naive,
and easy to handle.

159
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,070
She's tough.

160
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:56,970
And she has a temper too.

161
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,180
(Cafe Agit, 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.,
Closed Every Wednesday)

162
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,950
Hi, Eun Oh.

163
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,720
You're filling in today. Thanks.

164
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,320
Sure.

165
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:10,550
Did you talk it out with the client?

166
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,620
Yes.

167
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,260
She threatened to sue,
so I said to go ahead.

168
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,660
And she backed down?

169
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,460
People are so weird.

170
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,670
They cross the line
if you play nice.

171
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,070
Lots of people are like that.

172
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,640
They grovel to the powerful
and stomp on the powerless.

173
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,470
What can I get you?

174
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,080
(Incoming call: Ggang Oh)

175
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,220
Hi, little brother.

176
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,620
You're not here yet?
It's a Saturday.

177
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,860
I can't come over every Saturday.

178
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:49,230
Don't you know
I have an interior project?

179
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,260
You're not at the site on weekends.

180
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,800
It depends.

181
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,300
I can't come today.
I have lots to do.

182
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,040
Good for you,
working and not making a thing.

183
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,000
Help me out here, Ggang Oh.

184
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,340
You're my dear brother.

185
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,640
Whatever, weirdo.

186
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,510
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

187
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,050
Don't talk like that to your sister.

188
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,980
I'm dead tired.

189
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:10,980
You're what?

190
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,550
Hello, welcome. Come this way.

191
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,250
- You, come inside.
- Fine.

192
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,290
(Mini bar, work clothes)

193
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,170
(Calling: Paint Chief)

194
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,270
The person is not answering.

195
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:39,110
Transferring to voicemail
after the beep.

196
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:44,950
Sir.

197
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,220
This is my third call.

198
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,720
I'm calling to apologize,
not to ask a favor.

199
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,860
About the work on Sunday, I'm sorry.

200
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,090
I apologize.

201
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,930
Have a nice day tomorrow.

202
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,610
My gosh. You always end up
with those worthless customers.

203
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:11,610
When will our poor Eun Oh
ever get to open the hanok studio?

204
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,780
Oh, right. Did Ji Hyuk
find a place to stay?

205
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,320
Seriously, I want to try
drawing your brain structure.

206
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,920
How could you think of Ji Hyuk
while talking about hanok?

207
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,990
Ji Hyuk also likes hanok.

208
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,330
Hey.

209
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,200
When will you stop
being such a fool?

210
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,070
I mean, you can't even tell him
about your feelings.

211
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:37,030
Why are you saying that
when you know everything?

212
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,200
How can I tell him about my feelings
when he has a girlfriend?

213
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,510
My point. Why do you
even have feelings for such a flirt?

214
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,840
Hey. He's not a flirt.

215
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,850
He has never had a break from dating
since he got a job.

216
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,210
If that's not a flirt, what is?

217
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,950
He's never dated multiple women
at the same time.

218
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,550
It's just that
he keeps dating women.

219
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:56,190
Anyway, he never stops dating.

220
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,120
What if he marries his girlfriend?

221
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,090
He won't get married.

222
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,290
How can you be so sure?

223
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,360
Because Ji Hyuk wants
to stay single?

224
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:08,570
Even if I told you,
you wouldn't understand,

225
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,730
so I'm not going to tell you.

226
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,710
There's something about him
that only I know.

227
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:18,440
Do you want us to work all night
for three days?

228
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,380
As for the glass,
we can meet the required quantity...

229
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,480
if we work all night
for just three days.

230
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,650
My gosh, you make it sound so easy.

231
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,420
Do you want me to work with you?

232
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,890
I can work
without a single minute of rest.

233
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,160
Once the glass is ready,

234
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,360
we can change
the process accordingly.

235
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:40,560
When you desperately said
you'd wait at the factory,

236
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,570
I knew something was ominous.

237
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,640
We will do it only for three days.

238
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,040
I can't ask the workers
to work more than that.

239
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,380
With your supervision, three days
should be more than enough.

240
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,880
You know how to flatter me.

241
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,710
You know that's true.

242
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,580
Thank you.

243
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:58,480
I'm really grateful.

244
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,380
I'm not doing this
because you insist.

245
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,950
I owe you big-time,

246
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,990
but you didn't use it
to get your way. That's why.

247
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,090
I forgot all about it.

248
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,330
Come on!

249
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,660
I know you have a lot of pride.

250
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,730
But when your subordinate
makes a mistake,

251
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,300
he should take care of it.

252
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,440
Jae Jin has made
a lot of mistakes...

253
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,940
on the team,

254
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,310
so I'm afraid
he might get fired after this.

255
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:23,840
Even if he gets fired,
that's not your business.

256
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:26,480
Why do you even care?
That doesn't sound like you.

257
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,110
I know.

258
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,850
Am I being lenient with him
because he's so foolish?

259
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,490
If we work on the stone tiles
while attaching the panels,

260
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:38,660
we can meet the deadline.

261
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:40,320
If we work all night for three days.

262
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,330
If things go like that,
it should be fine.

263
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,960
That's impressive, Mr. Lee Ji Hyuk.

264
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,330
Thank you for your hard work.

265
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,730
Thank you.

266
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:55,310
I should thank you for moving on...

267
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:56,310
without any complaints.

268
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,540
From now on, I'll make sure...

269
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,240
to take care of everything
about Haneul Construction.

270
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,480
I won't leave it to anyone else.

271
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,110
You should buy me a meal.

272
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,850
And some drinks too.

273
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:07,720
Sure.

274
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,620
By the way,
the aftereffects seem severe.

275
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,990
You look like you've lost weight,
and your face looks haggard.

276
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:16,130
It's because of the war
against my dad.

277
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,660
War? I thought you broke up.

278
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,360
You said he left.

279
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,030
Isn't the war over?

280
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,170
He's trying to confirm things.

281
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:26,500
That's what my dad does.

282
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,870
Like a solid concrete structure.

283
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:30,610
Explain it in a language
I can understand.

284
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,380
You don't have to know.

285
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:35,880
The war won't end
unless one of us dies.

286
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,380
I don't want to know.

287
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,250
Just looking at your face,
I can tell it's complicated.

288
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:46,990
Have you not changed your mind yet?

289
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,700
Do you still want
to enjoy your own life?

290
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,800
Yes.

291
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,000
Good for you.

292
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'm jealous that
you can control your feelings.

293
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,940
You're so sure
that you won't fall in love.

294
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,170
You are confident that
you won't love anyone to death.

295
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,340
You are determined
to live only for yourself.

296
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,180
I'm jealous you can do all that.

297
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:13,180
My heart belongs to me,
so I should be able to control it.

298
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,650
I think you can do that
once you put your mind to it.

299
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:19,820
Once you realize that no feelings
or relationships last forever.

300
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,490
- You mean, Ji Hyuk?
- Yes.

301
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,830
Well, I don't think
he wants to get married yet.

302
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,760
You know, young people these days
want to get married late.

303
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,770
When I ask him about it,

304
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:31,970
he just says, "Okay. I get it. No."

305
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,210
That's what
young people these days do.

306
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:38,210
It's not like marriage is something
you can do alone.

307
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:41,950
I just hope he will get married
in about 2 or 3 years.

308
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:45,680
He got his employment extended
as an advisor,

309
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,850
so he's different indeed.

310
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,090
What are you talking about?

311
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:51,090
We're just jealous.

312
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:54,020
People try to get their kids
married off before they retire.

313
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,260
That's true.

314
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,690
A wedding ceremony costs
a lot of money,

315
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,400
which is why mutual help is needed.

316
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,200
It's not just about money.

317
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:03,330
When Myeong Su's daughter
got married two years ago,

318
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,700
he had to hire part-timers
as wedding guests.

319
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,040
Why would you bring that up?

320
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,210
After three years
of quitting my job,

321
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,810
I had no one to invite.

322
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:14,350
Hey, I'm really afraid...

323
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,410
that I'd be unemployed...

324
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:19,180
when my children get married.

325
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,850
Our former director, Lee,

326
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,290
has obtained 15 certificates,

327
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,890
but still hasn't found a job.

328
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:33,160
You're right. Just drink.

329
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,330
You should stop drinking.

330
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,830
Thanks.

331
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,400
Hey, you know what?
That's the case...

332
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,040
for the retirees
who majored in liberal arts.

333
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,280
That's why
I'm trying to be a welder.

334
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:48,280
Once I get the certificate,

335
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:52,020
I'll be able to get a job.

336
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,920
Children are always the problem.

337
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,090
They're a problem
when you raise them,

338
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,620
and they're still a problem
even after you retire.

339
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,220
That's enough.

340
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,790
You're gathered
to celebrate my retirement today.

341
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:04,030
Why are you complaining
about your lives?

342
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,560
It's just too hard.

343
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,800
We can only complain to a friend
with an easy life like you.

344
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,170
Aren't I right?

345
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,870
- Sure.
- Okay. Just talk to me.

346
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:13,300
Complain to a friend
with an easy life like me.

347
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,640
Yes. You're the luckiest one here,
Sang Cheol.

348
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,240
You worked
until your retirement age.

349
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,840
That's not it. You were recruited
before your retirement.

350
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,810
You will be an advisor...

351
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:24,980
until your youngest son
gets married.

352
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:26,050
I'm so jealous.

353
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,050
- All right. Let's drink.
- Let's drink.

354
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:30,220
- All right.
- To Advisor Lee Sang Cheol.

355
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,360
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

356
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,460
- Let's see.
- What?

357
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,630
Ji Hyuk.

358
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,970
Hey, Ji Hyuk.

359
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:44,100
I told you about the situation.
It was an emergency.

360
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,400
Did you guys talk about it?

361
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,470
Ji Wan wants to prepare...

362
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,970
congratulatory rice cakes
for the neighbors.

363
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:51,540
Hey, retirement isn't
always something to celebrate.

364
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:54,610
If it's not something to celebrate,
why are we throwing a party?

365
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,110
It's not a party. It's an event.

366
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:59,480
Dad has worked hard for 33 years.

367
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,390
I don't know what the difference is.

368
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,550
What will be the gift?

369
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,290
We can't decide that without you.

370
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,260
We need you.

371
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:09,630
Any idea?

372
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,760
Aside from clothes and shoes,
I can't think of anything else.

373
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,530
I'll be in charge of the event.

374
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,530
I will blow up balloons...

375
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:17,730
and make banners.

376
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,370
So you guys can decide on the gifts
and pay for them.

377
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,040
I'm basically a job seeker now.

378
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,880
Let's just give him cash.

379
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,110
But that would seem too insincere.

380
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:31,350
It will look insincere
if you don't pay a lot.

381
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,450
- What?
- Stop laughing.

382
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:36,450
Why?

383
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,190
So that's what it's like
when you don't have a job.

384
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,300
What? My gosh.

385
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,640
Ji Wan, send me the money
in two days.

386
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,510
Su Bin,
you will take care of the event.

387
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,340
- Okay.
- I will.

388
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,640
What? Why?

389
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,910
- It's Dad.
- What?

390
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,120
Smile.

391
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,890
Dad!

392
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:14,790
Why are you looking at us like that?
You look scary.

393
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:18,430
You guys look very suspicious.

394
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:21,000
What were you guys doing
without your mom and dad?

395
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,130
You look drunk, Dad.

396
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,000
Look at you.
You're trying to change the subject.

397
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,200
You're even more suspicious.

398
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,440
I ran into Su Bin on the bus.

399
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,740
And I met Ji Wan on my way here.

400
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,280
I was excited to see them,
so I asked them to have some tea.

401
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,710
Okay. That's nice.

402
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,980
Let's go home.

403
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:38,980
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

404
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,920
- Let's go home.
- Let's go.

405
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:43,190
My goodness.

406
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:47,260
With two tall guys
walking ahead of me,

407
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,930
I feel so safe.

408
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:50,990
- What did you do?
- What?

409
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,560
Were you
at Mr. Yeong Bo's restaurant?

410
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,670
Yes. My friends from college
wanted to get together...

411
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,600
to celebrate my retirement,

412
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,800
so I had a drink with them
after a long time.

413
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:04,240
Are your friends retiring this year?

414
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,610
Except for Mr. Yeong Bo?

415
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:06,940
What are you talking about?

416
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,250
I'm the only one who has worked...

417
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,180
until retirement age.

418
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,620
Also, I'm the only one...

419
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,190
who got a new job
in the same industry...

420
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,620
right before retirement.

421
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,290
You're the best, Dad!

422
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,830
- You're the best!
- You're the best!

423
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:26,300
Hey, Lee Ji Hyuk, my eldest son.
Why are you being quiet?

424
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,170
You're drunk.

425
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,400
Thank you, Dad.

426
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,400
For getting a new job
and making us feel reassured.

427
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,370
Sure. You must feel reassured.

428
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,110
- Dad, did you drink a lot?
- What?

429
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,940
No, I only had a little.

430
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,050
We're home.

431
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:44,150
- We're home.
- We're home.

432
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,850
How is everyone coming home at once?

433
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,690
Where's Mother?

434
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:51,820
She already went to bed.

435
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,420
Honey.

436
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,260
I caught these three hanging out...

437
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:59,300
in a cafe by themselves,
leaving us out.

438
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,560
Dad, come on.

439
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,370
We already told you that we ran
into each other on our way home.

440
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,440
Mom, we were just as surprised
and chose to go to a cafe.

441
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,940
I see.

442
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,570
Anyway, why weren't you asleep?

443
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,010
I wanted to talk to your brother,

444
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,180
but he's been hard to catch lately.

445
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,280
Head inside without us.

446
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:18,720
- Sure. Let's head inside.
- Let's go.

447
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,780
- Come on.
- Let's wash up and go to bed.

448
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:22,950
Mom, what's this about?

449
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,260
- Aunt Gyeong Ran...
- Stop right there.

450
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:26,820
Come on.

451
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:28,760
I've told you about 100 times
that I'm not interested...

452
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,830
in the dates you set up.

453
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:30,930
She's 29.

454
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:33,160
She's 165cm tall,
teaches middle school,

455
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,260
and loves playing tennis.

456
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:36,200
She has one older brother
and isn't religious.

457
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:38,900
She saw your photo
and was quite impressed.

458
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,270
Is there more?

459
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,770
She's the niece
of Aunt Gyeong Ran's husband...

460
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,310
and is a looker.

461
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:44,710
Are you done?

462
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,240
Thanks for killing my excitement.

463
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,740
You seem to have girlfriends,

464
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,080
but why is there
no talk of marriage?

465
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,080
There's probably a good reason
I haven't settled down yet.

466
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,480
Then, when will you tie the knot?

467
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,820
Mother, marriage isn't a necessity
these days.

468
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,820
Don't you have any friends
who are getting married?

469
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,320
Not even Seong Jae, Ju Hyeong,
Ji Tae, or Sang Ho?

470
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,890
None so far.

471
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:03,090
I'll head inside, then.
Gosh, I'm tired.

472
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,560
Ji Hyuk, wait.

473
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,700
There's a right time for everything,
you know.

474
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,580
My gosh.

475
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:29,850
Goodness.

476
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:35,890
I bet the work is killing you.

477
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,360
No way. Sir!

478
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:40,530
What on earth?
What are you doing here?

479
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:41,870
How are you here?

480
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:43,470
I didn't think you'd come.

481
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,400
I knew you'd be at this by yourself.

482
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:48,570
Seriously.

483
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,110
I felt uneasy
while eating breakfast today...

484
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,280
and got this odd feeling.

485
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:56,510
Our minds must've been in sync.

486
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,220
I made you feel that way.

487
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,720
"Please make him feel
as uncomfortable as possible."

488
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,920
When will you stop being
so headstrong?

489
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:07,390
The client gave up on the idea,
but I felt bad.

490
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,930
She clearly wants this.

491
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:12,360
Wasn't she the one who insisted
that we paint the ceiling white?

492
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,970
Tell me about it. It's ridiculous.

493
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,870
You're way worse.

494
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:18,800
How can you even think
to work on this alone?

495
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,670
You're an interior designer,
not a general contractor.

496
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:24,610
Still, I've picked up a thing or two
from watching you guys.

497
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:26,780
You never admit
you're wrong, do you?

498
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,480
Stop that and head home.
I don't want to see you here.

499
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,080
If you keep acting like this,

500
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,880
I might get indigestion
from how moved I am.

501
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,520
Get going already.

502
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,360
All right.

503
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:42,060
Thank you, sir.

504
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,330
You're the first of all my friends
from elementary school...

505
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:46,900
through college to get married.

506
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:49,270
He's my third. Two were colleagues,

507
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:51,000
and one was a doctor friend
from high school.

508
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,270
Do I have to say...

509
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,570
how many of my friends
got married too?

510
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:57,270
Getting married is tough these days,
but I've finally done it.

511
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,710
Congratulations, Ju Hyeong.

512
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,940
I'm proud of you.

513
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:02,910
Didn't you say...

514
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:05,250
you couldn't get married
for another 2 to 3 years?

515
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,950
We kept arguing nonstop,

516
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,850
so I eventually turned
to my dad for help.

517
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,060
We barely managed
to cover the yearly deposit...

518
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,290
on an apartment
with our savings and a loan.

519
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,560
I'm a bad son getting married
on my parents' retirement savings.

520
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,730
You think you're a bad son?
Even thinking that is a luxury.

521
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,630
Your parents would've wanted
to help out.

522
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,300
Don't feel too guilty about it.

523
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,440
Park Seong Jae.

524
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,270
- Hush.
- Zip it.

525
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,910
The conglomerate heir...

526
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:31,170
should maintain a poker face
and only nod.

527
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:33,980
You live in a world
completely different from ours.

528
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:36,510
Meanwhile, Ji Hyuk is the one
I envy the most.

529
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,950
He can afford to get married
but chooses not to.

530
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,620
He's doing well for himself now
because he's still young,

531
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,920
but what about when he gets older?

532
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:44,350
Ji Hyuk, will you still be surfing
well past your 60s?

533
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,660
What about mountain biking?

534
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,360
I wonder if the ladies...

535
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,730
will still be lining up
for him then.

536
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:49,990
Come on.

537
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:52,800
Hey, Ju Hyeong. You think
getting married means you've won.

538
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:54,730
Who are you to put me down?

539
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:57,130
There's plenty you can still do,
even in old age.

540
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,570
I can ride bikes, swim, trek,

541
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:00,870
camp, and travel.

542
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:03,670
One day, I hope to use
my severance pay...

543
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:04,980
to travel on a cruise ship.

544
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:08,810
Unbelievable.
Nothing seems to rattle him.

545
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,050
Ji Tae,

546
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,750
you're an only child, right?

547
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,720
Will you have to care
for your parents by yourself?

548
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:16,790
That shouldn't happen.

549
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,590
These days, parents and children
need to be self-reliant.

550
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:21,560
When my father
gave me 100,000 dollars,

551
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,790
he said he was getting
a reverse mortgage...

552
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:24,460
and not to ask for a penny more.

553
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:28,500
Either you die alone
or sink together...

554
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,570
when something big hits your family.

555
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,910
As expected, Ju Hyeong is
the first to get married.

556
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:37,510
How can he date the same person
for five years?

557
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,140
Because he loves her.

558
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:43,110
For five whole years?
That's attachment, not love.

559
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:46,350
He should've ended it like you
before he grew attached,

560
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,620
right?

561
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,490
It's odd.

562
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:54,120
Before starting a relationship
with anyone, you make it clear...

563
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,190
you have no intention of marrying.

564
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,860
So why do all your exes
end up wanting to marry you...

565
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,830
after a while?

566
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:04,170
They must be possessive.

567
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,440
Don't tell me you already have
another girl lined up to date.

568
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,140
Sit tight this time around.

569
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:10,810
Why?

570
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,040
You'll see.

571
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,310
Anti-climactic, don't you think?

572
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:17,050
Haven't your parents
mentioned marriage to you?

573
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:20,780
They won't accept you
not getting married.

574
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,450
Don't I know it.

575
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:27,060
They'll want me to marry
and have at least two kids.

576
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,090
Why do parents see marriage
as obvious...

577
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:32,460
and children as the next step?

578
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:36,130
By the way, when are you going
to break the news to your parents?

579
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,440
Once I find a place.

580
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,910
(Hangyeol University Construction
Volunteer Club, Value of Hangyeol)

581
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:48,350
(Value of Hangyeol,
volunteer work for Q2)

582
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,420
(Selling fan heater)

583
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,490
(Are you available today?)

584
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,460
Su Jeong!

585
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,490
I just heard back
about the fan heater.

586
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:03,560
The seller will bring it here.

587
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:05,000
It's new and has only been used
three times.

588
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,430
Do you really believe
it's only been used three times?

589
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,330
Even so,
I doubt it's seen heavy use.

590
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:12,540
I'll be right back.

591
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:17,670
(Electric fan heater)

592
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,280
Hello.

593
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,780
- Are you Giggle Giggle?
- What?

594
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,420
That's Eun Oh.

595
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:30,750
She's buying a used item again.

596
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,760
Can I have my 30 dollars?

597
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,820
Right.

598
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,390
Here you go.

599
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:40,860
Thank you.

600
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,080
Excuse me.

601
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,920
Darn it.

602
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:05,990
Hey!

603
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:08,890
- Watch out!
- What the...

604
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,860
I'm sorry.

605
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:14,800
Ji Hyuk, hey.

606
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:18,200
Darn it.

607
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,040
- Hey!
- Darn it.

608
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,610
Stop right there, you jerk!

609
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:26,180
Give me back my 30 dollars!

610
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,050
Stop right there!

611
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:43,530
Darn it.

612
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:58,740
Hey, come on. Darn it.

613
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,380
- I caught you.
- Move!

614
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:06,080
No way. Over my dead body.

615
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:19,930
Ji Hyuk, how are you here?

616
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,960
How much did he take?

617
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,800
Thirty dollars.

618
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:26,270
Thirty dollars? Come on.

619
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,510
I'm really sorry.

620
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,640
Darn you.

621
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,080
What do you want to do with him?

622
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:37,010
What should I do?

623
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:38,520
Do you want to call the cops
or get your money back?

624
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,580
I'm sorry. It was only a joke.

625
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:43,390
Give me my money back!

626
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,660
I'll give your money back
and get you a fan heater...

627
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,830
In fact,
I'll buy you the latest model.

628
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,760
He offered a fan heater
of the newest model.

629
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:59,140
You'll give me 30 dollars back...

630
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,370
and get me a new fan heater?

631
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:03,610
What do you say?

632
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:06,410
- I call that a deal.
- Right?

633
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:13,050
(Police Substation)

634
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:16,220
Unbelievable.
How dare he try to scam me?

635
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:18,490
Okay!

636
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:25,200
I bet this feels great.

637
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,730
Of course. Apparently,
he has done this before.

638
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:28,870
Darn jerk.

639
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:30,770
Eun Oh, this wasn't
a first for you either.

640
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:32,270
What do you mean?

641
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,470
You've trusted people
too easily before.

642
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:38,170
You're right. In that sense,
I'm a repeat offender.

643
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:40,980
The world is a troubled place now.

644
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:43,810
It's common
not to trust people anymore. Right?

645
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:45,010
Are you kidding me?

646
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:46,480
It was stupid of you
to chase after him...

647
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,580
in that dingy neighborhood.

648
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:50,690
I guess you were worried about me.

649
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:53,920
You'd have been fuming
if the big guy...

650
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,660
had really managed to hit you.

651
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,500
Either way, I wasn't hit,
he was caught,

652
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,330
and I realized you cared about me.

653
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:03,770
What a good day this is.

654
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,240
Unbelievable. She's happy
after putting herself in danger.

655
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:12,180
- Would you like a coupon?
- Sure.

656
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,940
- Can you clean that table?
- Sure.

657
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,450
That's what happened.

658
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:17,650
- I see.
- Goodness.

659
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:20,450
- It was another used item scam.
- And she fell for it.

660
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:23,120
Was she able to turn him in
to the police?

661
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,490
Yes, but...

662
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:27,420
Ji Hyuk went running
to where the scammer was headed,

663
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:31,130
so I don't get how they ended up
catching him together.

664
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,530
- Over there.
- They're here.

665
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:35,100
- You're here.
- Hey.

666
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,530
You're right on time.

667
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:39,240
Ji Hyuk, how did you know
to go after Eun Oh like that?

668
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,570
She was already getting played
when I saw her at the intersection.

669
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:44,740
I could smell something was up.

670
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,640
I bet she fell for the guy's lies.

671
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:51,350
By the way, why were you buying
a fan heater in this weather?

672
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:52,380
What fan heater?

673
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,680
No way. How have you been?

674
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,820
- Salute!
- Hello.

675
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:56,990
Good. You may rest.

676
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:58,220
- Sure thing.
- Thank you.

677
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,490
When Eun Oh checked out the place...

678
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:04,060
we were going to remodel,

679
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:07,030
the draft was
as bad as it could get.

680
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,830
There are times when Eun Oh catches
even the smallest details.

681
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:16,740
By the way, are you staying
for the meeting as well?

682
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:19,480
I believe seniority means
I don't have to.

683
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,980
Are you here as the landlady, then?

684
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:24,450
To see how well the cafe is doing?

685
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,380
Hey, I'm renting out this space
as a form of sponsorship,

686
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,380
not to make money.

687
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:31,850
I'm busy counting all the zeroes...

688
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,860
from the designs I've sold.

689
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,530
Here are some cookies...

690
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,500
for you to enjoy during the meeting.

691
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:45,640
- Seo Yeon Su!
- Seo Yeon Su!

692
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,700
Rest, boys.

693
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,870
- Sure.
- We'll rest.

694
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,410
Goodness, it's our honorary member.

695
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:52,580
Thank you
for your generous donation.

696
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:55,010
There's no need to thank me.
Please let me know if I can help.

697
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,880
He's the best.

698
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:59,450
Get to it, then.
I'm heading upstairs.

699
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:01,620
- Sure. Thanks for this.
- Have a good day!

700
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:05,420
This honorary member
will get going as well.

701
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,560
Good luck to you all.

702
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,490
- Thank you.
- Bye.

703
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:12,560
All right. Let's start the briefing.

704
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,630
- Sure.
- Sure thing.

705
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:14,960
- Jun Yeong, go ahead.
- Got it.

706
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:17,930
A grandpa in his 70s,

707
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:19,670
an eighth grader, Hye Yeong,

708
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:22,770
her brother Dong Su in sixth grade,

709
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:26,240
and their 45-year-old uncle
are sharing one room.

710
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:30,210
Thankfully, there's space here...

711
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:32,750
to give Hye Yeong her own room.

712
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,880
Other than that, we just need...

713
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,120
to get new bathroom tiles,

714
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,650
repaint the window frames,

715
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:38,990
refilm the kitchen countertop,

716
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:40,860
and handle basic flooring
and wallpapering.

717
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,790
That's a lot of work.

718
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:45,560
No wonder Eun Oh half-threatened us
into helping out.

719
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,400
She knows what needs to be done.

720
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,130
We had to redo the wiring
while dividing the space.

721
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:52,700
So Ye Gang, work your magic.

722
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,700
Okay.

723
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,370
Oh, this is the most important task.

724
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:59,240
We need to find a used door
for the new room.

725
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:02,380
Let me do that to make up
for not being around for a year.

726
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,450
- Nice.
- That's unexpected.

727
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:06,120
I highly appreciate it, Ji Hun.

728
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,120
Sure thing.

729
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,790
Please review your tasks
on the file that was handed out.

730
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,950
- Sure.
- Got it.

731
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,700
How do I look? Is my tie okay?

732
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,270
I bet this is upsetting.

733
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,870
This is a strange feeling,
but it's hardly upsetting.

734
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:30,040
It's not like I'm retiring
from the work scene for good.

735
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:32,240
I'll soon be working at Mr. Choi's.

736
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:35,040
You're hoping to buy time
with the tie.

737
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,110
"You're keeping me
from leaving the house."

738
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:39,150
"Tie, you need to be fixed."

739
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:42,490
Unbelievable. Da Jeong,
we've been together for too long.

740
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:43,820
I'll get going.

741
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,860
- Here.
- Can you carry it for me?

742
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:50,560
Here he comes.

743
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,000
- Dad!
- What? Hey.

744
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:54,430
What...

745
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:56,130
No way.

746
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:58,630
This was my idea.

747
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,740
We're seeing you off
on your last day at the office.

748
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,610
Am I even allowed
this kind of luxury?

749
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,940
And go!

750
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,580
- Have a good day at work.
- Have a good day at work.

751
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:10,850
Right, thanks.
I feel like I can do anything now.

752
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,680
And me.

753
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,020
Have a good day at work, honey.

754
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:16,890
And me.

755
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:18,990
Goodness.

756
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,020
Sang Cheol,

757
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:24,030
have a good day today.

758
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:26,900
Of course, Mother. I'll get going.

759
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,370
Honey, I'll get going.

760
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:31,570
Children, your dad is off to work.

761
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:32,640
Go, Dad!

762
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,640
Go, Father!

763
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,270
- Have a good day.
- Have a good day.

764
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:36,770
- Dad, have a good day.
- Sure.

765
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,310
- Bye!
- Father.

766
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,410
Da Jeong, what are we buying today?

767
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:45,410
We'll make galbi, japchae,

768
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:48,450
assorted jeons,
and seaweed soup with mussels.

769
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,420
He loves mussels.

770
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:53,120
We'll make some with mussel extract.

771
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,290
Let's also make stuffed
and steamed Washington clams...

772
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,790
as well as udon with jjajang.

773
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:59,030
Rockfish kimchi too.

774
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,560
What?

775
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,000
I can pay for the ingredients.

776
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:10,610
The feast will be on me today,
Da Jeong.

777
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:11,610
Here.

778
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,550
But this money...

779
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,880
You and Sang Cheol
gave it to me to spend,

780
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,250
so I can't say it's entirely on me.

781
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,590
Mother, that's not it.

782
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:25,820
How were you able to save this much
when we hardly gave you anything?

783
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,990
My son has held a job
for 33 years...

784
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:32,130
and has covered my meals
for more than 20.

785
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,300
If only he had been born...

786
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,270
to richer parents.

787
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,700
You probably want to treat him
to a meal...

788
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,000
to celebrate his retirement.

789
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,670
Exactly.

790
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:50,410
Let's do that, then.
It'll be your treat.

791
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:51,450
However,

792
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:55,650
you should pay for it yourself.

793
00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:00,360
Sounds good. Let's go.

794
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:06,630
Carry on.

795
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,080
- Do you see that there?
- Yes, sir.

796
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,350
Remember to check that.

797
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:25,050
(Management Team:
Executive Manager Lee Sang Cheol)

798
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:27,220
Even on his final day,
he's working like normal.

799
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:30,420
For Mr. Lee,
it's not really retirement.

800
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:31,550
How so?

801
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:32,720
Didn't you hear?

802
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,420
He got a job as an advisor.

803
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,560
- Really?
- Yes.

804
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,230
For 33 years,

805
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:40,360
I served as part
of the mosaic here...

806
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:42,200
in a supporting role,

807
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:45,330
believing my work was essential...

808
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:47,270
to this company.

809
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:49,810
But on my final day at work,

810
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:54,680
I have the chance to share my words
as the main character of a story.

811
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:59,180
For the past 33 years,

812
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:01,420
even without being told,

813
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:04,720
I lived a life where the company
came before anything else.

814
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,020
That's why,

815
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,930
despite many proud
and rewarding moments,

816
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:13,560
I feel empty inside.

817
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,100
But I guess that's life.

818
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,800
I'm like a flame...

819
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,110
that suddenly turned to ashes
after burning passionately,

820
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:24,710
thinking this day would never come,

821
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:28,110
even though I knew it would.

822
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,180
My junior colleagues,

823
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:35,020
I'm sorry I wasn't able
to be a better mentor.

824
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:37,390
To my senior colleagues,

825
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:39,220
who likely left the company
before me,

826
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,620
thank you all.

827
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:44,630
I now leave Gyeongseong T and C...

828
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:47,430
as my time here has come to an end.

829
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:48,430
Keep up the good work.

830
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:51,370
Thank you for letting me work
until it was time for me to retire.

831
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:52,800
Goodbye.

00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:57,810

(Employee ID Card,
Management Team, Lee Sang Cheol)

834
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,570
What a beautiful fall from grace.

835
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:12,720
Dad!

836
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,220
Congratulations on retiring!

837
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:17,890
- Yes.
- Congratulations.

838
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:19,460
Yes, thanks.

839
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:22,890
Father. You've been through a lot.

840

Applause.

841
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,360
Congratulations.

- Congratulations.
- Hi, there.

844
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,370
You had a good career.

Your dinner
will be extra tasty today.

Ms. Jo, are you well?

848
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:42,750
Yes, I am.

849
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,810
- Hello, Ms. Kim.
- Hi.

850
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:48,520
Is Mr. Kim not home?

851
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:50,120
My father?

852
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:52,920
He went to his hometown to celebrate
a relative's 90th birthday.

853
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,990
Oh, did he?

854
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:57,290
- Let's go inside.
- Okay.

00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:58,390
Let's go eat.

- Here we go.
- Watch your step.

857
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,630
Hey.

858
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:03,830
What did you cook, Mom and Grandma?

859
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,200
- Yes.
- All sorts of stuff.

860

Sorry for keeping you waiting.

861
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,140
My gosh. What is all this?

862
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:13,640
This is what it's like to set out
so much food the table could break.

863
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,010
I see stuffed and steamed
Washington clams...

864
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,250
and mussel extract.

00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:22,850
Yes, right.

868
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:24,250
My goodness.

869
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:26,690
The hometown food
you love so much...

870
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:28,290
- was all prepared by Mother.
- Okay.

871
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:30,290
Here, your udon with jjajang.

872
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:32,290
Nice, udon with jjajang. All right.

Let me see.

874
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,900
It tastes just like
what I used to have.

- Sure.

- Father.
- Yes?

880
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,910
You should make a speech.

881
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:51,680
What for?

882
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,380
I go back to work in two months.

883
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:56,490
Still, you reached retirement age.

884
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:57,750
Say something.

885
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,390
Should I?

886
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:00,560
Then...

887
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,930
I'm sorry for everything.
Thank you for everything.

888
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,100
Do help me in the future. The end.

889
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,130
You too, Mother.

890
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,360
Sure.

891
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:09,970
My goodness.

892
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,870
How is it that simple?

893
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,470
And why would you ask for help?

894
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:17,570
Well,

895
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:20,980
I was busy with work
and this and that,

896
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:23,850
and I feel bad that I wasn't there
for a lot of things.

897
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:27,820
I'm grateful you all
grew up well despite that.

898
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,020
From now on,

899
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:32,720
I only have to look after
your mom and grandma.

900
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,690
I'd like you three
to live your own lives...

901
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:37,530
responsibly and happily.

902
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,800
You, Ji Wan.

903
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:45,130
I hope you find a job
and stick with it.

904
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,740
And you, Su Bin.

905
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:48,900
You want to be
a successful content creator?

906
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:52,240
I hear that field
is pretty competitive.

907
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:55,280
I hope you do the best you can.

908
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:57,050
And you, Ji Hyuk.

909
00:42:57,310 --> 00:42:59,420
Spend less time on your hobbies...

910
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:01,780
and save up to get married.

911
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:03,520
- Understood?
- Yes.

912
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,550
Okay.

913
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,460
- Mr. Lee.
- Yes?

914
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:08,860
What about me?

915
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:11,290
Why would I worry about you?

916
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:14,130
You're a smart kid
from a rich family.

917
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,430
I'm worried.

918
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,800
He needs to lower his standards
and find a girl.

919
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:20,900
Seong Jae. Why don't you date?

920
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:22,640
I don't know.

921
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:24,740
Yes, that's right.

922
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:28,840
You guys are 33 years old.

923
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:31,010
You should prepare to marry.

924
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,680
Su Bin, you're too young yet.

925
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:36,120
When Ji Hyuk and Ji Wan get married,

926
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:39,590
I can give you each
about 70,000 to 80,000 dollars.

927
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:40,960
Keep that in mind.

928
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:43,190
You have money to give us?

929
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:46,400
You said you checked your finances
when you bought this house.

930
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:49,430
Don't you need the severance pay
to pay off the mortgage?

931
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:52,330
Yes. You need to save up
for your retirement too.

932
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,070
You don't have to worry about me.

933
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:56,910
I plan to marry a rich guy.

934
00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:00,910
You're extra naive
for a 24-year-old.

935
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:03,810
Don't you worry about us.

936
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:06,680
I'm going to be an advisor
at Seoil Textiles.

937
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:09,550
I just have to work ten more years,

938
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:10,650
and I can retire for good.

939
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:11,750
I have my national pension too.

940
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,260
That's right.

941
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:16,090
Your grandpa
won't need any more money,

942
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:18,730
and I won't ever fall ill.

943
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:21,400
Grandma.
That's not under your control.

944
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:23,100
Your birth and death.

945
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:25,300
Those are the two things
humans can't control.

946
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:27,900
Do you think
Grandpa wanted to fall ill?

947
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:35,340
You got extra stupid
in the year I didn't see you.

948
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:36,410
You can't tell what not to say?

949
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,350
Ji Wan and Su Bin are right.

950
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:43,120
We'll take care of ourselves
from now on.

951
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:44,750
You two should take things easy.

952
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:46,520
You too, Grandma.

953
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:50,530
It's not that I don't trust you.

954
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:53,560
I want to help you out
as any father would.

955
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:57,530
Ji Hyuk, you'll be married
within a year or two.

956
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,170
Oh, right.

957
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:02,400
I forgot my present.

958
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:04,870
- Mr. Lee.
- What?

959
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,440
It's a travel pass to Europe.

960
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:09,880
You can visit three countries
for up to one month.

961
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,410
Call the number there
once you decide where to go.

962
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:15,180
I can visit Europe
for a whole month?

963
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:17,550
My gosh. Seong Jae.

964
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:19,990
You arranged a surprise
to steal our thunder?

965
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:22,160
You can't do that.

966
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,690
Your gift is better than ours.

967
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:24,890
It's fine.

968
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:28,060
If you total the cost of the food
he's eaten here since middle school,

969
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:29,130
it would be way more than that.

970
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:32,230
I got a great deal
from a business partner.

971
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:34,670
We prepared...

972
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:36,440
some cash.

973
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:38,040
Spend it on what you need.

974
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:41,510
Eating with the family
is more than enough.

975
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:42,680
You got me cash too?

976
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:46,080
You should save up
to spend on yourselves.

977
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:47,680
For you, Grandma.

978
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,390
- And for you, Mother.
- My gosh.

979
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:53,120
You both played a huge role
in helping Father work for so long.

980
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:55,560
My word. Ji Hyuk.

981
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:57,030
Ji Hyuk.

982
00:45:57,430 --> 00:45:59,500
Put this toward
your wedding expenses.

983
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,060
I don't need money.

984
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:03,930
Grandma. Everyone needs money.

985
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:06,400
This is why you need lots of money.

986
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:08,170
You can't look cool without it.

987
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,070
Yes. But Ji Hyuk betrayed us.

988
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:12,540
You gave Mom and Grandma cash
without telling us.

989
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:15,240
He's the eldest after all.

990
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,880
The eldest always knows best.

991
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:20,780
I could wish for nothing more...

992
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:23,890
if you would just give me
a great-grandchild.

993
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:25,490
Stop it, Grandma.

994
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,030
- Shall we?
- Let's eat.

995
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
My gosh.

996
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:44,470
Oh, dear.

997
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:50,780
Turn off the alarm,

998
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:52,480
or don't sit up.

999
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:56,350
You don't have to
go to work anymore.

1000
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:58,920
Right.

1001
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:00,660
Yes.

1002
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:02,460
Goodness.

1003
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:04,790
Oh, dear.

1004
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,870
It's great not to have to worry
about running into Father.

1005
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,010
My heart.

1006
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:25,910
Let's see.

1007
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:29,180
(Calling: My love Hong Mi)

1008
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:35,620
- What?
- Hey.

1009
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:37,790
It's Lee Ji Wan's wake-up service.

1010
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:40,000
Did you sleep well, sweetie?

1011
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,260
- Yes, thanks.
- Later today...

1012
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:50,640
The money Father will give me
to get married...

1013
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:53,580
The last rep.

1014
00:47:57,350 --> 00:47:59,280
That's it. Well done.

1015
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:01,880
Mr. Lee? Can I have a word?

1016
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,150
Excuse me.

1017
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:06,220
So,

1018
00:48:06,890 --> 00:48:09,020
your weekday mornings are open.

1019
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:11,060
- Yes.
- We got you a client.

1020
00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:12,490
Okay.

1021
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:14,060
A middle-aged lady.

1022
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:17,000
I told you not to schedule
any female clients.

1023
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,500
I don't train women.

1024
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,040
She point-blank requested you,

1025
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,700
so I have no choice.

1026
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:25,140
If you don't cooperate,

1027
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:27,180
the boss will chew me out.

1028
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:29,650
- I'm serious.
- She requested me?

1029
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:36,020
Instructor Lee!

1030
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:40,760
Mr. Lee.

1031
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:43,590
I didn't know
you moved to a different gym.

1032
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:45,190
You know me, right?

1033
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:48,330
I was your student
at Honghong Swimming Pool.

1034
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:50,470
I'm Ha Yeong Hui.

1035
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,040
Honghong.

1036
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,570
Honghong.

1037
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,040
This is driving me nuts.

1038
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:26,800
This isn't so bad.

1039
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:36,480
(10:59 a.m., April 1, Tuesday)

1040
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:38,180
My gosh.

1041
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:40,780
Time is really dragging.

1042
00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:54,630
(The perfect man
you've been looking for)

1043
00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:00,370
(You will meet him now.)

1044
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:01,500
(Love and You)

1045
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,500
(Love and You)

1046
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,870
Your parents own a home
but haven't paid off their mortgage.

1047
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:06,480
That's too bad.

1048
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,550
Ms. Lee Su Bin,
you actually don't have...

1049
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:16,690
any money saved or a job.

1050
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:18,920
What do you mean I don't have a job?

1051
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,190
I run my own YouTube channel.

1052
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:22,090
You have only 13,000 subscribers.

1053
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:23,490
You barely make any money.

1054
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,030
Men these days know all that.

1055
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:28,660
But still,

1056
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:32,530
you, Su Bin, have great strengths.

1057
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:36,810
You're young, pretty,
and have a great body.

1058
00:50:37,270 --> 00:50:39,340
I know, right?
I don't really lack anything...

1059
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:41,740
My YouTube channel
will be successful soon.

1060
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:43,380
Okay.

1061
00:50:43,810 --> 00:50:46,920
Do your parents know
that you are here?

1062
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:50,150
Gosh, no.
They are quite conservative.

1063
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:54,290
And I'm the one
who is looking for a date.

1064
00:50:54,290 --> 00:50:55,290
A date?

1065
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:56,930
Aren't you here to find a spouse?

1066
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:59,660
I'll date, and then get married.

1067
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,500
I'm not just looking for a rich man.

1068
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:06,570
All right. Then, Ms. Su Bin,

1069
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:09,770
could you tell me
what qualities you want in a man?

1070
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:11,840
A four-year college graduate
in Seoul.

1071
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,240
A professional or a businessman.

1072
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:15,210
I mean,
a man with financial ability.

1073
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:16,850
His parents should be able...

1074
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:18,450
to take care of themselves
after retirement.

1075
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:22,480
Oh, right. I want to buy a house
when we get married.

1076
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:25,550
And he should be 177cm or taller.

1077
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:27,390
I can accept the age difference
of up to 12 years.

1078
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:29,560
But I don't like a man
with a potbelly.

1079
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:30,760
I want someone
who takes good care of his looks.

1080
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:35,400
He doesn't have to be handsome,
but I want him to look nice.

1081
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:38,570
Are you done?

1082
00:51:41,770 --> 00:51:44,240
So you want someone
with a good educational background,

1083
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,580
a good job, a lot of money,
and a well-off family.

1084
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:49,810
Moreover, he should be tall,
good-looking, and fit. My gosh.

1085
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:55,350
You are looking for a perfect man,

1086
00:51:55,980 --> 00:52:00,160
who is our VVVIP customer
with five stars.

1087
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,590
Oh, really?

1088
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:02,620
Yes.

1089
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:04,890
Listen, Su Bin.

1090
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:09,130
Do you think such a perfect man...

1091
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:11,670
with a great background
would want to go out with you?

1092
00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:14,170
I know you are young and pretty.

1093
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:16,670
But your background
is just ordinary,

1094
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:18,840
and you're basically unemployed.

1095
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:21,010
My goodness.

1096
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:26,820
(Cafe Agit)

1097
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:38,830
What perfect timing.

1098
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:41,130
I was on my way from the gym.

1099
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:42,630
And you just came out.

1100
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,670
It's Sunday.

1101
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:46,100
What are you doing
in this neighborhood?

1102
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:48,300
Well...

1103
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:51,240
I left some documents at the office.

1104
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,750
If you keep doing this,
I'll feel uncomfortable, Mr. Park.

1105
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:01,680
You don't have to
thank me like that.

1106
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:03,590
You know I'm always bored.

1107
00:53:05,450 --> 00:53:07,560
Why is he bored
when he's got everything?

1108
00:53:08,890 --> 00:53:10,290
I just don't understand him.

1109
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:14,360
Is everyone sleeping in
because it's Sunday?

1110
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:16,000
Why don't you sleep some more?

1111
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,230
All three of them went out already.

1112
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:21,770
Ji Wan is on a date,
Su Bin is out for a shoot,

1113
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:24,970
and Ji Hyuk is doing
the second quarter volunteer work...

1114
00:53:24,970 --> 00:53:26,170
for the Construction Volunteer Club.

1115
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:29,950
He graduated from college already,
and he's still doing that?

1116
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:31,250
Does he like it?

1117
00:53:31,550 --> 00:53:33,950
He says it's fun. I guess
he does it because he likes it.

1118
00:53:35,350 --> 00:53:38,490
Do you think
Ji Hyuk still has some regrets?

1119
00:53:39,290 --> 00:53:40,590
I don't think that's why.

1120
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:44,460
I told you it was not
about architectural design.

1121
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:48,660
They replace wallpaper
and flooring for those in need.

1122
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:50,570
During vacation,
they do joint activities,

1123
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:53,670
where the graduates help them
with home repairs.

1124
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:56,440
Yes, I know that.

1125
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:58,970
It's volunteer work,
so it makes him feel good...

1126
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:00,080
and relieves stress.

1127
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:03,380
Does it still bother you?

1128
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:05,050
Gosh, no.

1129
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:08,550
It's just amazing that he's still
doing such difficult work.

1130
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:10,150
- I'll go and wash my hands.
- Okay.

1131
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:26,070
What? It's Ji Hyuk.

1132
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:29,040
You're right. It's Ji Hyuk.

1133
00:54:30,670 --> 00:54:31,770
Seong Jae.

1134
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:33,070
Hi.

1135
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:35,310
Hey, Park Seong Jae. What?

1136
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:36,440
Seong Jae!

1137
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:39,450
What are you doing?

1138
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:41,380
This is fun.

1139
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:44,220
Hey! Wait!

1140
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,690
Hey!

1141
00:54:47,590 --> 00:54:48,890
He's fast.

1142
00:54:49,290 --> 00:54:50,490
Hey, stop.

1143
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,070
- Hey, you!
- My gosh.

1144
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:04,210
Is it fun? Gosh, I'm so tired.

1145
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:05,740
Hey, where's your car?

1146
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,380
There's no parking here,
so it's in the public parking lot.

1147
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:10,710
Why did you come with Eun Oh?

1148
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:12,780
He went to the gym in the morning,

1149
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:15,080
and then he was headed to the office
to get the documents he forgot.

1150
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:17,350
Eun Oh was coming out
with a lot of stuff in her hands.

1151
00:55:17,350 --> 00:55:19,550
There will be no team dinner.
We will finish late tonight.

1152
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:21,020
I know that.

1153
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:22,020
Go!

1154
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:23,260
Let's go.

1155
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:27,000
Thank you, Mr. Park. Bye.

1156
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:30,400
Give me that.

1157
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:31,870
How could you get here so fast?

1158
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:34,270
Me? Because I run fast.

1159
00:55:34,270 --> 00:55:37,240
It was an uphill road.
It must've been hard.

1160
00:55:38,370 --> 00:55:39,570
She seems so happy.

1161
00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:49,480
My gosh. The mold is the worst.

1162
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:51,420
Using bleach wouldn't work.

1163
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:53,250
We will have to tear off
all the wallpaper.

1164
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:54,990
It is too moldy.

1165
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:58,590
We should've called the workers.

1166
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:00,900
We should let Eun Oh do it.

1167
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,500
Eun Oh, back in college,

1168
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,370
when you worked part-time
to earn money for your tuition,

1169
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:06,330
you had a lot of fun tearing off
wallpaper at a construction site.

1170
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:07,970
That's why you became interested
in interior design.

1171
00:56:07,970 --> 00:56:09,240
That's ridiculous.

1172
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,070
That's the most annoying work.

1173
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:14,310
When the dirty wallpaper
comes off...

1174
00:56:14,310 --> 00:56:17,110
and the bare wall appears,
I feel great joy.

1175
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:20,050
My gosh. You're weird.

1176
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:22,020
Let's just spray the mold remover...

1177
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:23,550
and put up new wallpaper.

1178
00:56:23,690 --> 00:56:25,990
We have to tear off
the old wallpaper here.

1179
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:27,990
It's Hye Yeong's room,

1180
00:56:27,990 --> 00:56:29,620
and the mold is too bad.

1181
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:31,790
I'll tear it off.

1182
00:56:31,790 --> 00:56:33,630
Here's the scariest thing to say.

1183
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:35,930
"I'll tear it off."

1184
00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:39,430
Hey, you guys are saying something
that the older members don't know.

1185
00:56:39,470 --> 00:56:41,100
The thing is, Eun Oh always...

1186
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:43,370
When she wants to do something,
no one can stop her.

1187
00:56:43,370 --> 00:56:44,940
- She's unstoppable.
- All right.

1188
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:47,940
We don't have time.
Let's start the mold removal.

1189
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:49,380
Ji Hyuk, please cut the wallpaper...

1190
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:51,280
for Hye Yeong's room with your team.

1191
00:56:51,410 --> 00:56:53,480
- Okay.
- Okay. Let's begin.

1192
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,380
- Let's do this.
- Okay.

1193
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:57,050
- Hey, lift me up.
- Okay.

1194
00:56:57,050 --> 00:56:58,190
All right.

1195
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:11,470
Where's Seong Jae?

1196
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:13,300
He went out at 5 a.m.

1197
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:14,370
What?

1198
00:57:14,370 --> 00:57:16,700
Mi Yeon saw him
when she just woke up and came out.

1199
00:57:18,110 --> 00:57:19,670
Where did he go
so early in the morning?

1200
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:21,540
He didn't tell me anything.

1201
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:24,080
He went out in a tracksuit.

1202
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:25,810
I guess he went to work out.

1203
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:29,020
Have a seat.

1204
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:31,920
Don't even think
of calling Seong Jae.

1205
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:32,950
Okay?

1206
00:57:35,390 --> 00:57:37,230
- Good morning, Dad.
- Hey.

1207
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:40,600
Your mom sees right through me.

1208
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:42,900
Let's eat.

1209
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:45,130
Hang on.

1210
00:57:45,870 --> 00:57:49,100
Has it been a week
since we ate together, Yeong Ra?

1211
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:51,470
Are you sure
you're not working too hard?

1212
00:57:52,310 --> 00:57:53,540
I'm fine.

1213
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:55,540
Yeong Ra.

1214
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,410
Why don't we eat out together
for lunch today?

1215
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:02,820
I have to go to the studio today.

1216
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:04,690
On Sunday?

1217
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:07,790
Tell her to rest today.

1218
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:10,890
It's not like
I don't want her to rest.

1219
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:14,000
But a painter
who's having a solo exhibition...

1220
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,560
has no time to rest.

1221
00:58:15,630 --> 00:58:16,900
She should stay focused.

1222
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:17,930
Oh, dear.

1223
00:58:17,930 --> 00:58:19,630
Seong Jae, you're home.

1224
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:20,940
I'm sorry I'm late.

1225
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:22,500
I woke up early,
so I went out for a drive.

1226
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,110
I see.

1227
00:58:24,170 --> 00:58:26,340
You've been up since early morning,
so you must be hungry.

1228
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:27,440
Have a seat.

1229
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:29,280
- I'll get Seong Jae his soup.
- Yes, ma'am.

1230
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,580
Seong Jae doesn't like clams,
so I'll do it.

1231
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:32,650
Thank you.

1232
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:36,280
So you woke up early
without getting enough sleep.

1233
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:38,490
Did you have a lot on your mind
because of the project proposal?

1234
00:58:39,450 --> 00:58:40,560
Not exactly.

1235
00:58:41,590 --> 00:58:42,590
Yeong Ra,

1236
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:44,460
how's your solo exhibition
coming along? I bet it's tiring.

1237
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:48,160
I simply paint according
to the instructions.

1238
00:58:49,230 --> 00:58:51,200
The preparation
is actually wearing Mom out.

1239
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:54,170
Seong Jae, I'm nervous
to say the least.

1240
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,340
Your father might be used to it,

1241
00:58:57,740 --> 00:59:00,380
but backing her solo exhibition
is taking a toll on me.

1242
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:02,380
Meanwhile, you're being trained
to run the company,

1243
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:03,880
which I hear is hard work.

1244
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:09,750
I'll enjoy.

1245
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:11,350
Sure.

1246
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:47,090
I'm always watching.

1247
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:48,760
What the heck?

1248
01:00:37,870 --> 01:00:39,210
This too.

1249
01:00:39,210 --> 01:00:40,380
- Hold on.
- Wait.

1250
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:41,910
- It's heavy! Out of my way.
- Move.

1251
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:44,480
Come on. Are you kidding me?

1252
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:46,910
That can go.

1253
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:49,050
- Hui Dong.
- Yes?

1254
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:50,450
Are you done with the wiring
in the kitchen?

1255
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:52,590
Jun Sang probably did that.

1256
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:53,990
Jun Sang?

1257
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:55,920
- What?
- Did you get it done?

1258
01:00:57,290 --> 01:00:58,590
We need to hurry.

1259
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:00,760
- Over here too.
- Here?

1260
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,570
That's it.

1261
01:01:05,930 --> 01:01:08,100
Okay, that looks good.

1262
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:09,100
Sure.

1263
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:14,880

What now?

1275
01:01:39,270 --> 01:01:41,170
Hye Na, look for a hardware store.

1276
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:43,810
What's wrong?

1277
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:46,110
A girl in eighth grade
needs a lock on her door.

1278
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:49,180
How do you even know that?

1279
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:50,280
I have a younger sister,

1280
01:01:50,510 --> 01:01:52,150
and she mostly keeps
her door locked.

1281
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:53,780
She also throws a fit
if someone doesn't knock.

1282
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,780
I doubt any hardware store
is open at this hour.

1283
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:57,790
Just give up.

1284
01:01:57,790 --> 01:01:59,250
- He's right.
- Exactly. We'll fix that next time.

1285
01:01:59,490 --> 01:02:01,390
Sure. I'll get her a new doorknob
on the weekend.

1286
01:02:01,890 --> 01:02:03,660
Ji Eun Oh may have a bag
like Mary Poppins,

1287
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:05,260
but I doubt it contains a doorknob.

1288
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:08,160
They don't call me Mary Poppins
for no reason.

1289

- You have a doorknob of all things?
- No way.

1290

- As if.
- Don't be ridiculous.

1291
01:02:11,370 --> 01:02:13,530

- Who carries around a doorknob?

1292
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:15,240
- You're scaring me.
- All right.

1293
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:16,900
- Here.
- She has a doorknob!

1294
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:18,410
- Is this for real?
- No way.

1295
01:02:18,410 --> 01:02:20,910
- Unbelievable.
- There's no way.

1296

fixing a cafe.

1301
01:02:29,950 --> 01:02:31,090

The second you move out,

1408
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:32,810
you won't be able
to save up any money.

1409
01:09:32,810 --> 01:09:35,380
Ji Hyuk, does that mean
I can get married first?

1410
01:09:35,740 --> 01:09:38,780
What do you mean
it's advanced pancreatic cancer?

1411
01:09:39,110 --> 01:09:40,750
Ji Hyuk, did you hear the news?

1412
01:09:40,750 --> 01:09:42,220
What will happen to Dad?

1413
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:44,850
Are you telling me to date a man
who's 17 years older than me?

1414
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:49,090
Ji Eun Oh's been crushing
on Lee Ji Hyuk for a long time.

1415
01:09:49,890 --> 01:09:52,330
I wonder how that can benefit me.

1416
01:09:53,790 --> 01:09:56,100
What the... What are you doing here?

1417
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:57,300
You told me to come.

1418
01:09:58,270 --> 01:09:59,770
I have feelings for you, Ji Hyuk.

1419
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:02,240
