00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:02,170
(Episode 9)

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,140
- No, it's not like that.
- It is like that.

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:07,480
I didn't know
you could be so manipulative.

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,880
Fine. I got it.

5
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,320
Keep doing what you're doing.

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,320
Will you let me off a bit,

7
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:19,920
Ji Eun Oh?

8
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:21,460
A bit?

9
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,230
I won't bother you any further.

10
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,460
You won't.

11
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,130
What?

12
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,300
Because I quit.

13
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:31,470
You'll what?

14
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,340
I was the manager of this cafe.

15
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,170
I resign.

16
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,510
You'll quit working here?

17
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:46,380
The monk must leave
if the temple becomes unbearable.

18
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:49,720
Don't you feel bad for me?

19
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,690
Don't you have a conscience?

20
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,760
I felt bad.

21
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,030
But I was going to pretend I didn't.

22
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,700
Because I need to survive.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,710
You don't care
whether I live or die.

24
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:12,540
Will you die?

25
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:17,720
If I'm around...

26
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,950
If I'm in your space,

27
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:24,360
will that kill you?

28
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,530
Save your twisted logic
for Hyeon Su.

29
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,530
And go on doing what you wish.

30
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,230
I will die.

31
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,310
Do you think...

32
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,840
I don't know
how much you resent, despise,

33
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,780
and belittle me?

34
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,180
You think I don't know?

35
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:55,820
I feel...

36
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,030
horribly ashamed,

37
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:03,700
humiliated,

38
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,000
and embarrassed.

39
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,100
But I still came here.

40
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:15,840
Because I needed to survive.

41
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,310
I had no money at all,

42
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,650
and I needed to start a business.

43
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,350
I needed some place to fall back on,

44
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,390
and this was...

45
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:35,860
the only place.

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,200
And the person
who hates me most works here.

47
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,170
That's why I went to Hyeon Su.

48
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,640
So you wouldn't be able to...

49
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:54,550
turn me away.

50
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,120
I knew that was unfair.

51
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,620
I wanted to...

52
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:07,260
start over, away from you
and away from everyone else.

53
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,630
I wish I could have.

54
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,500
Pretend I'm a stranger...

55
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,340
for just a few months.

56
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,010
I'll leave when I get my bearings.

57
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,120
You mean I have to...

58
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,190
put up with this...

59
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,360
for two months?

60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,530
If you quit
because you can't even stand that,

61
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,400
then I must leave.

62
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,810
What?

63
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,950
That's not right.

64
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,250
I stay here while you resign?

65
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,350
I can't let that happen.

66
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,390
You said you'd die
if you couldn't work here.

67
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,230
Even if I die.

68
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,720
I don't believe this.

69
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:45,360
What? He'll leave if I quit?

70
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,430
My gosh.

71
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:50,930
I stay here while you resign?

72
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,970
I can't let that happen.

73
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,540
He has a conscience, then?

74
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,410
I just can't stand him.

75
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,410
Hey.

76
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,210
I don't need help with the cleaning.

77
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,610
I want my workspace back soon.

78
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,580
Okay.

79
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,390
You can stay in here
now you have a peephole, right?

80
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,990
- What?
- From now on,

81
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,760
don't go through Hyeon Su anymore.

82
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,630
I won't have to.

83
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,830
Don't act like you know me.

84
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,440
Don't say hello. Don't talk to me.

85
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,470
Keep these three rules.

86
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,340
Please.

87
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,420
Can I get an answer?

88
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,950
I'll do that.

89
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:59,120
We're closed today,
so I can't make you coffee.

90
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,790
Okay.

91
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,910
This wasn't the idea.

92
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,930
No food that smells.

93
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,700
I had ramyeon with the door open.

94
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:24,940
So what? Sang Cheol goes to class?

95
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:29,210
He studies all day long
from Monday to Friday.

96
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,880
Yes, and I might have to go out
on some Saturdays too,

97
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,250
for a special lecture.

98
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,690
So you'll learn about electricity?

99
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,790
Yes.

100
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:42,360
I want to become
an expert in that field.

101
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,000
If I become
an electrical technician...

102
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,630
and work for a few years,

103
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,700
I can become an electrical engineer.

104
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,740
- Oh, I see.
- Yes.

105
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,370
That's quite something.

106
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,710
You're going back to studying.

107
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:00,480
They say we'll live to be a hundred.

108
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,850
I have many years to live,
and it pays to have a license.

109
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,100
(Teaching Certificate, Kim Da Jeong)

110
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,570
(Licensed 2nd-grade
elementary school teacher)

111
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:27,270
(Public Service Card, Kim Da Jeong)

112
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:34,980
One, two, three, four,

113
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,050
five, six, seven, eight.

114
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,690
My arms and legs
still work just fine.

115
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,020
Honey. You don't think
I'll die in the next year, do you?

116
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,800
My son who's in his 60s...

117
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,000
is learning a new trade
to make money.

118
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:58,700
I won't be a parasite any longer.

119
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,600
I'm his mom.

120
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:05,310
(Part-timers needed, simple tasks)

121
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,180
I should knock at least.

122
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,680
What am I afraid of?

123
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,820
"Novices accepted, seniors welcome."

124
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:18,020
That's what your notice said.

125
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,760
(Part-timers needed, simple tasks)

126
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,670
Excuse me.

127
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,740
So, you are looking for employees.

128
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,810
Are you looking for a job?

129
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:38,380
Yes. I'm 88 this year.

130
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,210
Can I work here?

131
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:42,610
Go ahead and tell me
before I cross the threshold.

132
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,120
Please look at me, ma'am.

133
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,520
Open your hands like this.

134
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:55,030
One, two, three, four, five. Do it.

135
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:59,460
One, two, three, four, five.

136
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,930
Do you think I'm a child?

137
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,270
It's all good. Please come on in.

138
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,440
I'll teach you.

139
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:06,800
Yes!

140
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,370
Fold it here.

141
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,740
And fold it in half.

142
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,910
- Like this?
- That's right.

143
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,240
- Fold it lengthwise.
- Yes.

144
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,550
Good.

145
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,180
You're really good at this.

146
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,120
You're good.

147
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,320
You will get the hang of it soon.

148
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,920
Gosh, you're...

149
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:36,700
Well... Mr. Kim.

150
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,170
Please don't tell Da Jeong...

151
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:42,370
that you saw me here.

152
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,140
I do not want my son
to find out about this.

153
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,810
Actually,
I'm keeping this a secret...

154
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:50,410
from Da Jeong too.

155
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:51,780
I see.

156
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:59,460
I will get going, then.

157
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,930
Are you going home?

158
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,360
Won't you fold the envelopes?

159
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:06,460
How can I do that when you're here?

160
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:10,500
Then I'll quit.

161
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,700
You should take the job.

162
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,570
What? Please don't do that.

163
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:17,940
You started it before I came,
so I can't let you quit.

164
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,240
I just can't do that to my in-law.

165
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:21,810
By the way,

166
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,010
why does it even matter?

167
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,280
We're just here to work.

168
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:27,450
What?

169
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,020
At our age, it's not easy
to find a part-time job like this.

170
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,020
We just need to keep it a secret
from our children.

171
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,690
Our children?

172
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,430
Sang Cheol and Da Jeong?

173
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:39,430
Yes.

174
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,100
Should we keep our distance
when we're about to turn 90?

175
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,070
Don't you agree, Ms. Jo?

176
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,940
Let's work together.

(Owa Fire
and Electrical Training Academy)

178
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,610
These are the characteristics
of each generator.

179
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,210
Including the shunt-wound
electric generators...

180
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,050
and series-wound generators
I mentioned earlier,

181
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,680
there are various types.

182
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,150
Likewise, this is the part
you should memorize.

183
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,920
You need to memorize...

184
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,720
the characteristics
of each generator.

185
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,530
Yes. The buttons work properly.

186
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,730
I checked for any errors
in the external and internal links.

187
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,330
The image resolution is fine.

188
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,430
I also checked the fonts
on both PC and mobile.

189
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:24,610
Gosh, I'm dying of curiosity.

190
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,380
Hey, the website goes live today,
right?

191
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,020
What kind of business
is he launching?

192
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,250
I don't know.

193
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,720
I bet it's an online shopping mall.

194
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,920
Will he sell local specialties?

195
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:43,560
Where are you going?

196
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,560
I need to open
a business bank account...

197
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,360
- and take care of some things.
- I see.

198
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,930
So, is the website live now?

199
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:49,930
What is it for?

200
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:50,970
See for yourself.

201
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:53,800
It's mamdaerozip.co.kr.

202
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,610
- Mamdaero...
- Mamdaerozip.

203
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,680
Mamdaerozip...

204
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,310
What? It says Mamdaerozip.

205
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,150
Eun Oh.

206
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,390
It's mamdaerozip.co.kr.

207
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,730
I'm curious.

208
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:20,660

209
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:22,130

(What Mamdaerozip does)

211
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,770
We'll match you with a coordinator
who can fill in any gaps...

212
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:30,040
in your DIY interior design.

213
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:33,480
A coordinator
for DIY interior design?

214
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:35,380
Eun Oh.

215
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,280
I knew it.

216
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,520
You knew what?

217
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,720
I told you his business talk
was just a bluff.

218
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,760
He'll connect
DIY interior design clients...

219
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,960
with coordinators when
he's not even an expert himself?

220
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,660
How can he even call this
a business?

221
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,430
It's not something he can do...

222
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:56,600
without a thorough understanding
of interior design.

223
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,040
I guess you're right.

224
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,840
He has renovated all kinds of houses
through his club activities,

225
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,810
so you could call him a semi-expert,
but it still feels out of the blue.

226
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,410
Is that all he can do?

227
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,360
Seong Jae, I'm here.

228
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,790

231
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,400
Mamdaerozip?

232
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,140
Seong Jae.

233
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,310
Hey. Wait...

234
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,510
Hurry.

235
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:42,780
Okay.

236
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,420
(Mamdaerozip)

237
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,550
(We understand.)

238
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,550
(But what's the reality?)

239
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,860
This is a lot of food.

240
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,030
I thought
it would just be the two of us.

241
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:57,900
Is it a lot?

242
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,000
This is what you used to eat.

243
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,000
Oh, right.
They don't have Cajun salad here.

244
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,500
So I ordered steak salad instead.

245
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,900
You like meat.

246
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,140
It's for her.

247
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,820
Lemonade?

248
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,950
Yes, you silly thing.

249
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,950
That's what you always had...

250
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:24,020
when you were meeting your friends.
Your comfort food.

251
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,390
And lemonade is your favorite.

252
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:28,530
Seong Jae.

253
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,860
Back then, I was studying
for the college entrance exam.

254
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,460
I ate a lot without thinking
and weighed over 60kg.

255
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:35,970
Don't you see how I look now?

256
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,100
You don't seem so different.

257
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,300
Seong Jae!

258
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,610
To me, you are always...

259
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:47,110
Ji Hyuk's little sister.

260
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,450
This is embarrassing.

261
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,980
You have to eat them all.

262
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,790
I don't drink lemonade anymore.

263
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:55,850
It's too sweet.

264
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,190
My gosh.

265
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,560
Do you drink iced Americanos?
It's not sweet.

266
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,130
Gosh, I lost...

267
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:05,030
a lot of weight in college
and have always looked this way.

268
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,530
Men don't notice things like that.

269
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:13,270
I wanted to buy you
everything you liked.

270
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:15,240
Take your time
and eat them all little by little.

271
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,470
Is there anything else I ordered
that you hate?

272
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,880
Seong Jae.

273
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,950
You are refusing to appear
on my YouTube channel, right?

274
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:29,450
Yes.

275
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,460
I'll make sure to blur your face.

276
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,160
It's not just about my face.

277
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,830
It just doesn't suit me.

278
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,830
Gaining a few thousand subscribers
with me appearing on your channel...

279
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,130
can't be a fundamental solution.

280
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,230
That's why I won't do it.

281
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:42,570
Come on.

282
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:46,900
Listen.

283
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:51,480
How about I help you find a job?

284
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,780
Why would you?

285
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,410
No, thank you.

286
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:57,580
Seong Jae, I don't want
to work for a company.

287
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,480
What is it you want, then?
Working as a YouTuber?

288
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,320
I'll become a successful YouTuber...

289
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,220
and marry a rich man.

290
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:06,820
I'll get married for sure.

291
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,990
A rich man?

292
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,500
My goodness.

293
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,700
- Hey, Lee Su Bin. You...
- Stop it.

294
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,770
Don't judge me.

295
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,500
Being rich isn't the only condition.

296
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,370
That's why I joined
a matchmaking service.

297
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,110
A matchmaking service?

298
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,380
Have you lost your mind?

299
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,480
Do your parents know?

300
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,480
They don't.

301
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,850
Listen, Seong Jae.

302
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,990
You keep judging me rashly
with prejudice.

303
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,490
Listen to me first.

304
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,430
I've come to accept
the limitations I was born with,

305
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,390
so I don't have any complaints.

306
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,200
But I think I have
the right to overcome them.

307
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:49,530
And money is how you overcome them?

308
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:50,870
Being rich is one of them.

309
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,300
I want someone
with a good personality, good looks,

310
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,740
financial ability,

311
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,510
and a good family background
and genuine love for me.

312
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,240
That's why I joined
a matchmaking service...

313
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,440
that can offer those things.

314
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:04,150
I want to meet someone who fits
the description and start dating.

315
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,450
You have your own logic.

316
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,790
This is a reasonable choice.

317
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,490
Marriage should be a win-win
for both people involved.

318
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,960
Oh, dear.

319
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:17,330
You do sound like
Lee Ji Hyuk's sister.

320
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,700
I'm sure I can be a good partner,

321
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,230
whether in dating or marriage.

322
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,770
But ordinary people like me
getting married just for love?

323
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,910
I don't want that.

324
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,410
I don't want to live
a life of hardship.

325
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:31,610
I don't mind even if you call me
a calculating person.

326
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:34,910
Life is a struggle
for everyone to get what they need.

327
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,720
"Struggle?"

328
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:42,620
Fine. I agree.

329
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,120
Let's just eat. I'm hungry.

330
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,930
It's been so long, penne.

331
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:54,000
- I'm so happy to see you.
- Goodness.

332
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,470

333
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,170
Thanks for the food, Seong Jae.

334
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,340
I'm going this way.

335
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,470
Wait, Su Bin.

336
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:06,310
Let me give you some pocket money.

337
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,180
Are you looking down on me
or something?

338
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,950
I get pocket money from Ji Hyuk,

339
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,320
but not from you.

340
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,720
Do you know how many men
want to give me pocket money?

341
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,750
There are tons of them.

342
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,260
Good for you.

343
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,890
You should go.

00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:22,930
Okay.

345
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,860
Call me if you have any problems.

346
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:29,770
Would it kill him to just help me?

347
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:35,740
Maybe it's not wise
to depend on him so much.

348
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:54,420
Hold on.

349
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:57,160

get just a few thousand,

but you're offering 20,000?

just a second ago.

00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:05,170

("Short Philosophical Essays"
by Arthur Schopenhauer)

546
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,820
You seem pretty absorbed
in that book these days.

547
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:30,290
The writing has such depth...

548
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:32,230
that I want to memorize
all the sentences,

549
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,230

550
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:36,830
Honey,

551
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:40,200
why is there so much to learn
in the world?

"This is how you should live
your one life."

553
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:49,250
But no one can live
by doing only what they want.

554
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:52,620
I can see that our views on life
are quite different.

555
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,180
Goodness.

556
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:56,820
That means we don't have
the same views on life.

557
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:01,520
Still, we're perfectly matched
in harmony.

558
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,790
Sharing the same views
doesn't make a harmonious couple.

559
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,360
You're a born mediator.

560
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,800
I've only been struggling
to follow in your footsteps.

561
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,140
By the way,

562
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:18,270
have you been trying to find someone
for Seong Jae to marry?

563
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,380
Of course, I have,

564
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,980
but it's easier said than done.

565
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,450
Maybe we should grab
a drink together.

566
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:33,220
You said I should wait for him
to make the first move,

567
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:38,260
but I can't read him at all.

568
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,630
He's been like that
since he was a kid.

569
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:44,870
Don't you see
that's why you can't push him?

570
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,170
Still, he'll take over
the company someday.

571
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:52,510
I feel bad that we burdened him
with the director position.

572
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,980
It weighs on me.

573
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,710
He's not like you at all.

574
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:00,750
You enjoy taking on challenges...

575
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,190
and expressing
your opinions strongly.

576
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:06,260
Our Seong Jae, on the other hand,
isn't as ambitious.

577
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,330
That's the problem.

578
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,700
Tell me about it.

579
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,970
That's why it scares me...

580
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:18,270
to push him with company work.

581
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,000
The same goes for his marriage.

582
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,710
What if this makes him act out
and head in the opposite direction?

Hey, just call me Chauffeur Lee.

I have something to ask.

630
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:15,600
My temporary driver,
who's also my bodyguard,

631
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,770
is my brother's friend's
younger brother.

632
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:20,400
He's about two years older
than I am.

633

How should I address him?

634
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:26,580
Is your brother good friends
with the driver's brother?

635
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:30,650
Yes, he told me that he had
great trust in that friend.

636
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:33,680
It would be appropriate...

637
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,550
to call him by his name
or add Mr. before it.

638
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:38,550
I see.

639
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:41,990
I shouldn't have called him
a chauffeur or sir.

640
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:44,560
Since it's temporary,
he's not an employee...

641
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,330
but a part-timer.

642
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:51,170
Referring to him as "chauffeur"
or "sir" could offend him.

643

that you shouldn't tell your mom...

00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:34,820
Oh, her?

718
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:38,690
I want my project to be
well-finished rather than rushed.

719
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:41,830
So please take your time
and work on it slowly...

720
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:43,000
while doing other projects too.

721
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:45,000
You should be working a lot
at your age.

722
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,900
How can she be that considerate?

723
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,410
She paid you
for the design in advance.

724
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:51,610
Is that how the rich work?

725
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,080
I think she's cautious.

726
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,740
And she cares a lot
about the project.

727
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,010
Mr. Park.

728
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:01,950
I'm glad I caught you
while you were still here.

729
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:04,450
Ta-da.

730
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:09,190
I guess I stayed
because I knew you'd come by.

731
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:16,300
He came by without calling again.

732
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:18,700
How does he expect me
to eat all that?

733
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:20,500
Let me wash my hands.

734
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:26,880
What were you doing out there?

735
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:30,480
Can't I sit outside
to drink a coffee I paid for?

736
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,550
I mean,

737
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,620
I thought you didn't have the time
to drink coffee.

738
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:37,650
I told you to wait until I called.

739
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:40,990
Hey.

740
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,630
I got that for Eun Oh.

741
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:47,260
For Eun Oh?

742
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,930
It's her dad's death anniversary.

743
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,600
Yes.

744
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,200
I see.

745
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:56,940
Why would you...

746
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,340
buy her fruit
on her dad's death anniversary?

747
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:01,840
Why not?

748
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:05,180
Can't I buy fruit for a junior's
dad's death anniversary?

749
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:07,150
I bought it for her
to share with her family.

750
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:09,150
Did you?

751
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,090
Eun Oh doesn't like bananas.
She doesn't eat them.

752
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:14,320
- What?
- Ask her yourself.

753
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:17,830
Yes. I don't like bananas.

754
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,400
I sent you bananas...

755
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,630
when you were ill.

756
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:25,230
Just seeing fruit you don't like
can make you feel sick.

757
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:26,270
Didn't you know that?

758
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:29,240
That's no reason
to eat what isn't yours.

759
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:32,510
Well...

760
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,710
I thought he'd bought it for me.

761
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,150
You should go, Eun Oh.

762
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:39,380
- It'll be rush hour soon.
- Okay.

763
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:41,350
I'll offer this to my dad...

764
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:44,320
and then share it
with my family. Thanks.

765
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:45,820
- See you tomorrow, Su Jeong.
- Bye.

766
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,630
How do you know
her dad's death anniversary?

767
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:57,000
I heard...

768
00:44:57,430 --> 00:44:59,500
he died when Eun Oh was
in her last year of high school.

769
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,240
That means he died young.

770
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,640
How did he die?

771
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,940
Hey, you don't know that
when you're close enough to know...

772
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,040
his death anniversary?

773
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,040
You fool.

774
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:11,810
Hey.

775
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,850
I think he's upset with you.

776
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:20,520
"You don't know that?"

777
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,360
Let him be upset.

778
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:30,700
If Eun Oh was a senior
when he died...

779
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:34,270
He was way younger than my father.

(CO Distribution Center)

781
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:43,150
You can go.

782
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:48,920
(CO Distribution Center)

783
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,930
Go on.

784
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:04,900
- Good job.
- Well done.

785
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:05,930
Good work.

786
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:09,200
- Good job.
- Well done.

787
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,970
(CO Distribution Center)

788
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:12,010
Well done.

789
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:13,610
Oh, my gosh.

790
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,110
Oh, dear.

791
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:19,080
Goodness.

792
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:26,490
My dad.

793
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:29,490
How many times
did I make tteokbokki for him?

794
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:32,760
It has been 12 years already.

795
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:34,830
My gosh.

796
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:38,470
I should've made this for him
before he died.

797
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:42,470
If you had,

798
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:44,810
he would've been so touched,

799
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:48,240
he might've dropped dead on the spot
from a heart attack.

800
00:46:50,410 --> 00:46:52,750
You can be pretty funny sometimes.

801
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:57,620
Thinking about him and tteokbokki...

802
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:59,050
makes me laugh even now.

803
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:01,190
He insisted on eating that
with you...

804
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:02,420
and no one else.

805
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:04,430
Gang Oh and I were always left out.

806
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:08,860
That's why I thought...

807
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:11,170
Dad loved tteokbokki.

808
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:13,840
He just pretended to like it...

809
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:15,740
because it was my favorite.

810
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:21,480
I bet your dad is happy even now.

811
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:26,220
Because it means
you value your memories with him.

812
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:32,190
I miss him.

813
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:51,610
Honey.

814
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:54,210
You're well, aren't you?

815
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,950
Eun Oh, Gang Oh, and I...

816
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:04,420
We don't do as well
as when you were around,

817
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:05,690
but we're doing okay.

818
00:48:06,590 --> 00:48:08,260
I owe Eun Oh a lot.

819
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,930
The daughter
you cherished so much...

820
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:14,400
is now the head of the family
in your place.

821
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:16,670
She opened a restaurant for me.

822
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:19,940
Of course.
Everything's all thanks to Eun Oh.

823
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:24,340
I'm doing so well...

824
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:26,680
thanks to you, Dad.

825
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:29,810
You raised me like this.

826
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,800
Why aren't you doing anything, Dad?

827
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:51,270
Why are you just watching me?

828
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:53,070
Because I believe in you.

829
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:54,640
What?

830
00:48:57,210 --> 00:48:59,070
Even if I don't do anything,

831
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,580
you are strong enough...

832
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:03,910
to overcome everything
on your own...

833
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:05,980
even when you are sad,
upset, or scared.

834
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,520
Am I?

835
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:09,120
Don't you think so?

836
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:11,950
You're right.

837
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:13,860
Of course, I am.

838
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,630
That's why I believe in you
all the time.

839
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:26,400
Mom, I have Dad's tenacity, right?

840
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,340
He was gentle,

841
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,040
but he could be ruthless
when he had to be.

842
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:34,010
That's why he succeeded on his own.

843
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:37,880
I didn't know that back then.

844
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:41,750
Thanks to your dad,
I lived like a queen.

845
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:44,720
Then why did he go bankrupt?

846
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:45,950
He should've managed things well
until the end.

847
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:48,460
Ji Gang Oh, shut it.

848
00:49:48,890 --> 00:49:51,260
You two should keep praising Dad.

849
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:53,660
Dad would always put you first
and didn't care much about me...

850
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:55,300
because I wasn't
as good at studying as you.

851
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:57,200
I was talented in soccer.

852
00:49:58,470 --> 00:50:00,700
He just doesn't know much
about his dad.

853
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:02,670
It's over, so I'm going out.

854
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:04,040
I have plans.

855
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:05,140
Gang Oh.

856
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:08,410
Is something wrong? Tell me.

857
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:09,410
What if it is?

858
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:11,310
Are you being feisty because
it's Dad's death anniversary?

859
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:13,120
Don't act like you know it all.

860
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,520
You can't solve anything.

861
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,990
Hey, come over here!

862
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:19,220
Hello?

863
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,120
Eun Oh, that's enough.

864
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,260
By the way,

865
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:28,800
I'm worried
if he's in some kind of trouble.

866
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:32,870
No way. I'm sure everything's okay.

867
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:51,420
What's wrong?

868
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:55,120
Is he sick?

869
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:02,600
Why are you groaning in your sleep?

870
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:04,400
Are you feeling unwell?

871
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:08,240
No. I'm fine. Go back to sleep.

872
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,200
Check the schedule.

873
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:41,640
Okay. Then please send me
the dates when you're free.

874
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:42,700
Thank you.

875
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:43,710
Bye.

876
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,810
Su Jeong told me I'd be the only one
working in the morning.

877
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,210
You came early.

878
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:50,880
I have some work to do.

879
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:54,220
Eun Oh!

880
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:56,250
- Eun Oh!
- What is it?

881
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:57,420
What's wrong?

882
00:51:58,090 --> 00:51:59,390
I need help.

883
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:01,390
You have 30,000 dollars, right?

884
00:52:01,390 --> 00:52:03,990
Can you give me 20,000 dollars?

885
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:08,900
When it comes to a house,
you must always listen to the wife.

886
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:11,230
And I know how to handle the ladies.

887
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:13,170
You said you quit
the interior design business...

888
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:14,770
with your friend...

889
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:16,140
because of
differences of opinion, right?

890
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:19,610
Yes. It's not like two people
can always work equally,

891
00:52:19,610 --> 00:52:22,310
so it's stressful
to split the money 50-50.

892
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:26,580
I see. I understand.

893
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:28,420
- I'll give you a call later.
- Sure.

894
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:31,820
Ji Gang Oh, what did you just say?

895
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:34,420
You put Mom's restaurant up
as collateral?

896
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:37,260
That's not what's important now.
I'm dying here.

897
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:39,630
Did you just say you borrowed money
from a loan shark?

898
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:40,960
- Yes.
- This way.

899
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,200
I borrowed 20,000 dollars
from a loan shark.

900
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:46,200
If I don't pay it back,
I'll lose my hand.

901
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,700
My goodness.

902
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:51,370
The cafe is so nice and big, Boss.

903
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:53,910
Excuse me.

904
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:56,650
Unfortunately,
there are no customers.

905
00:52:56,650 --> 00:52:57,650
Eun Oh.

906
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:02,220
I won't excuse you.

907
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:04,050
Hey.

908
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:06,620
You brat. Hey.

909
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:09,190
Why are you spouting words
that are out of place and time?

910
00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:10,290
I'm sorry, Boss.

911
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:13,500
The one who made us come here
is your brother,

912
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,200
Ji Gang Oh.

913
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:17,130
First of all,

914
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:20,200
he's the one you lent money to.

915
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:23,940
And forcing his family
to pay the debt is against the law.

916
00:53:24,310 --> 00:53:26,840
So stop making a fuss
and get out of here.

917
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,440
Don't even try to mess with me.

918
00:53:31,810 --> 00:53:32,850
Then,

919
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:37,020
I'll take
your mom's restaurant, okay?

920
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:40,220
I know. I get that.

921
00:53:40,490 --> 00:53:42,660
I'll figure things out myself.

922
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:44,960
So get out of here right now!

923
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:49,000
My gosh.
This little brat is acting cute.

924
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:58,210
(Summer 2016)

925
00:53:58,210 --> 00:53:59,570
Isn't this too much?

926
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:00,940
Su Jeong, have a drink.

927
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:03,110
Let's have fun together.
I'm your senior, after all.

928
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:04,480
No, I'm okay. My gosh.

929
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,050
Hey! Kim Tae Ju!

930
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,120
Hey.

931
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:18,960
Stop acting so dirty
whenever we have a get-together.

932
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,660
I don't care
if you're a senior or not!

933
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:29,740
Hey.

934
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:32,240
You're a debtor.

935
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,910
Until your darn brother
gives me my money back,

936
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:36,810
I'll do things my way.

937
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:38,610
Then take him with you.

938
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:40,180
If I take him with me now,

939
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,150
your brother will lose his hand.

940
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:43,590
Go ahead and cut off his hand
if you want.

941
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,720
He should lose his hand
if he deserves it.

942
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:48,290
Eun Oh.

943
00:54:48,290 --> 00:54:49,490
You should go with them, Gang Oh.

944
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:53,290
You don't seem to understand
what we're saying.

945
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:55,660
Hold that darn brother.

946
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:08,840
You darn brat. Do you want to die?

947
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:11,450
Stop! Stop what you're doing.

948
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:17,190
I recorded you
vandalizing and making threats,

949
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:18,550
so go back quietly...

950
00:55:18,550 --> 00:55:20,160
and never show up here again.

951
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:23,290
That's what the manager said.

952
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:27,330
Boss, we taught them a lesson today,

953
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:28,600
so let's just go back.

954
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:31,300
Okay. We should go back today.

955
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:34,500
Ji Gang Oh,
you have until tomorrow at noon.

956
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:39,140
We're going back today,
but we will see you tomorrow.

957
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:46,980
My office is here.

958
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:49,550
Don't disturb me! Darn it.

959
00:55:57,030 --> 00:55:58,060
Ji Gang Oh.

960
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:00,900
You should go.

961
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,760
How would I go now?

962
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:05,570
You fool. Mom must be alone
at her restaurant now.

963
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:07,070
You should go
and protect her from them...

964
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:08,670
even if you lose your hand!

965
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:12,370
Make sure
she won't even get a scratch.

966
00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:14,610
Eun Oh.

967
00:56:15,010 --> 00:56:16,580
Do you want me to cut off your hand?

968
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:17,850
You know I have an ax.

969
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:20,180
Eun Oh!

970
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:31,720
Ms. Ji.

971
00:57:32,890 --> 00:57:34,020
Are you all right?

972
00:57:34,290 --> 00:57:36,860
Yes, I'm fine. I'm going out.

973
00:57:41,530 --> 00:57:43,300
(Balance: 29,179 dollars)

974
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:46,470
You want 24,000 dollars in cash?

975
00:57:46,770 --> 00:57:47,970
What is it for?

976
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:51,140
The loan sharks are asking for cash.

977
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,140
Is there a problem?

978
00:57:53,610 --> 00:57:55,480
(Debt Payment Confirmation)

979
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:56,850
(Certificate
of Full Payment of Loan)

980
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:02,820
Don't lend him money ever again.

981
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:06,720
If you do,
you won't get even a penny back.

982
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:09,920
This is all I have,
which is like my life.

983
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:13,390
By the way, Ji Eun Oh,
what makes you so fearless?

984
00:58:13,390 --> 00:58:15,260
I stand backed
by the laws of our nation.

985
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:18,270
I see. Is that why
you're being so impolite?

986
00:58:18,270 --> 00:58:20,570
I won't be polite or formal
to people who don't respect me.

987
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:23,300
Let's go.

988
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:25,640
Why that little...

989
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:30,810
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

990
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,810
I really thought the website was run
by a securities firm.

991
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:35,380
You would've thought so too, Eun Oh.

992
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:38,220
Besides, you heard the police.
I'm not the only one who was duped.

993
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,420
There are 697 victims.

994
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:43,090
You promised two years ago
that you wouldn't go near...

995
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:44,360
stock recommendation
chat rooms again.

996
00:58:44,990 --> 00:58:46,030
But...

997
00:58:47,030 --> 00:58:48,730
stock recommendation chat rooms
aren't all scams.

998
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:52,970
You brat.

999
00:58:53,470 --> 00:58:55,870
Do you know what that money
meant to your sister?

1000
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:59,270
It's about time
she had at least a used car.

1001
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:01,640
She's been receiving
more work lately.

1002
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:03,440
How is she meant
to keep taking the bus?

1003
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:05,310
My gosh.

1004
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:06,780
And you...

1005
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,880
Investing in a pick-up bar?

1006
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:10,690
An investment of 100,000 dollars,
might I add?

1007
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:12,750
How could you even dream of that?

1008
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:14,560
Where would you get 100,000 dollars?

1009
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:17,030
That's why I tried
to earn the money.

1010
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:19,390
Everyone invests in stocks
and cryptocurrency these days.

1011
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:20,760
That's the only way to make money.

1012
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:21,800
Gang Oh, please.

1013
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,730
If you make this restaurant
a success,

1014
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:25,500
you'll get to keep it all...

1015
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:27,500
once I'm too old to manage it.

1016
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:29,740
That's what your sister
told you to do.

1017
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:31,370
I have my own dreams, you know.

1018
00:59:31,470 --> 00:59:32,610
If it weren't for my injury,

1019
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:34,040
I'd be kicking it
like Son Heung Min.

1020
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:35,810
Actually,
I wouldn't have ruined my life...

1021
00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:37,410
if I had been able
to give private lessons.

1022
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:41,820
Write an IOU...

1023
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:43,920
for the 24,000 dollars
I covered for you.

1024
00:59:43,950 --> 00:59:46,050
Take just 500 dollars...

1025
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:47,990
and pay me back
1,000 dollars each month.

1026
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:49,790
- Eun Oh, please.
- Mom.

1027
00:59:50,590 --> 00:59:52,790
Make sure he works
until closing time every day.

1028
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:54,830
Take a photo each day
as you close up the restaurant...

1029
00:59:54,830 --> 00:59:55,900
and send it to me.

1030
00:59:56,030 --> 00:59:58,900
If you don't, I won't even
let you have 500 dollars.

1031
01:00:01,270 --> 01:00:02,470
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1032
01:00:02,470 --> 01:00:03,500
No problem.

1033
01:00:11,910 --> 01:00:13,010
We should talk.

1034
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:16,120
The 20,000-dollar job offer.

1035
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:19,620
Oh, right.

1036
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:21,460
I'll do it.

1037
01:00:22,990 --> 01:00:25,260
Should we write a contract, then?

1038
01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:27,400
Yesterday,

1039
01:00:27,930 --> 01:00:29,700
you said it was a business offer.

1040
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:33,500
We'll sign a contract, Ms. Ji.

1041
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:37,310
I'm getting ready to work
on an apartment unit in Mapo.

1042
01:00:37,410 --> 01:00:39,510
The schedule could overlap
when that project begins.

1043
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:40,740
Of course.

1044
01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:43,640
A coordinator isn't supposed
to be on-site all day anyway.

1045
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:49,250
(Ji Eun Oh)

1046
01:00:57,060 --> 01:00:58,160
(Agreement
for Interior Design Services)

1047
01:01:01,230 --> 01:01:02,630
Day one is demolition day.

1048
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:05,430
The contractor and workers
have already been hired.

1049
01:01:06,470 --> 01:01:08,840
Here's the revised schedule.

1050
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:13,040
This is the floor plan
confirmed by the client.

1051
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,610
The ten percent down payment
will be wired tomorrow morning.

1052
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:23,320
I'll review the materials today...

1053
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:25,490
and discuss the details
with the client.

1054
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:32,260
I could've made my own breakfast.

1055
01:01:32,830 --> 01:01:34,060
You barely got any sleep.

1056
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:38,000
I should cook you breakfast
on the first day of a project.

1057
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,270
You're heading out to work at 6 a.m.

1058
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:41,300
What worries me...

1059
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:45,370
is that I won't be there
to check on Ggang Oh.

1060
01:01:45,770 --> 01:01:48,840
Up until now, I've been dropping by
unannounced to check on him.

1061
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:51,910
No one in his right mind...

1062
01:01:51,910 --> 01:01:53,410
would break his promise
after ten days...

1063
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:55,180
simply because you aren't around.

1064
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:57,550
Right?

1065
01:01:59,190 --> 01:02:01,190
That childish brat.

1066
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:06,490
What?

1067
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:09,430
The demolition guy
wouldn't know the lock code.

1068
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:22,110
What?

1069
01:02:24,010 --> 01:02:25,050
What's this?

1070
01:02:25,050 --> 01:02:27,850
Are you here as the boss
because this is your first project?

1071
01:02:28,220 --> 01:02:29,220
No.

1072
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:30,720
Then, what?

1073
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:33,250
I'm here as a worker today.

1074
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:35,720
A worker?

1075
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:38,690
You need workers on-site
on demolition day.

1076
01:02:38,790 --> 01:02:40,460
That'd be me.

1077
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:43,200
Let me get this straight.

1078
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:46,200
You'll be working here today?

1079
01:02:47,170 --> 01:02:48,940
Yes, right here.

1080
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:35,850
(Our Golden Days)

1081
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:38,390
This means
I'm a lousy excuse for a father.

1082
01:03:38,390 --> 01:03:40,620
- Hey, Ji Hyuk.
- Ji Hyuk!

1083
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:41,790
If you actually understood,

1084
01:03:41,790 --> 01:03:43,460
you would've come home
since you were in Seoul.

1085
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:44,490
How could you not even call?

1086
01:03:44,530 --> 01:03:46,990
You don't have the right
to be sarcastic with me.

1087
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:49,530
Seong Jae and I go back nine years.

1088
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:51,170
You really think less of me,
don't you?

1089
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:52,870
Whether I succeed or fail,

1090
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:54,070
I'll do it on my own
without relying on you.

1091
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:56,200
Like that's enough to recharge you,

1092
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:57,570
when I know how much you eat.

1093
01:03:57,640 --> 01:04:00,510
Ms. Ji, how could you possibly tell
how much strangers eat?

1094
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:02,440
Let's just be like strangers, okay?

1095
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:03,640
What's so hard about that?

1096
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:05,480
You're the one who barged in here!
