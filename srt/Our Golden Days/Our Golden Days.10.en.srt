00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,070
(Episode 10)

2
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:07,950
What?

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,580
What's this?

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,720
Are you here as the boss
because this is your first project?

5
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:17,090
No.

6
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:19,460
- Then, what?
- I'm here...

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,360
as a worker today.

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,530
A worker?

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,600
You need workers on-site...

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,000
on demolition day.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,670
That'd be me.

12
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,670
Let me get this straight.

13
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,010
You'll be working here today?

14
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,040
Yes, right here.

15
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,180
Are you kidding me?

16
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,150
We had assigned a demolition team
and a handyman...

17
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,850
before you became the coordinator.

18
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:48,420
Is that so?

19
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,790
Okay, then.
I'll put up with it for one day.

20
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,790
That's all I have to do, right?

21
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:54,160
I'd like to work...

22
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,390
whenever you need a handyman.

23
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,260
I hire the workers I need.

24
00:00:58,660 --> 00:00:59,960
I need the money.

25
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:01,570
For living expenses.

26
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,700
It won't be every day.

27
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,570
Just when you need a handyman.

28
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,440
So I can check the site,
learn the ropes,

29
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,280
and get paid.

30
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,050
Why are you doing this to me?

31
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,750
The coordinator
gives orders in the morning...

32
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,720
and can show up or not at lunchtime.

33
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,190
We'll meet
three times a day at most,

34
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:22,750
and I'm nothing but a handyman.

35
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,860
You can treat me as one.

36
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,190
Right, Ms. Ji?

37
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,790
Mr. Lee.

38
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,200
Fine. Fire me if you want to.

39
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,530
But...

40
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,530
you can't avoid me.

41
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,170
As the CEO of Mamdaerozip,

42
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,810
I'll be here often
to observe the first project.

43
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,480
You'll come as the CEO?

44
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,740
Is this the place?

45
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,150
Oh, hello, Mr. Lee.

46
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,780
- You're here.
- Hello.

47
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,350
- Hello.
- Hello.

48
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,190
- You got here early.
- Yes.

49
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,120
(Demolition plan)

50
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:01,430
Let me remind you
that we'll take everything down.

51
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,530
It's an old apartment,

52
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,500
so we can't put new tiles
over the old ones.

53
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,100
Take everything down
except the balcony closet.

54
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,330
Oh, we'll paint the walls later,

55
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,170
so scrape off
the wallpaper thoroughly.

56
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:12,770
Okay, got it.

57
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,470
Let's get started.

58
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,910
Let's begin.

59
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,210
- Okay.
- Yes.

60
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,980
You may leave now.

61
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,050
I know.

62
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,850
I'll take a respite from dust
and come back around lunchtime.

63
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,920
- Thank you for your hard work.
- All right.

64
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,440
He will work as a handyman
to get paid?

65
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,770
I have no idea what he's up to.

66
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,240
(Client: Choi Eun Ju)

67
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,450
Thank you.

68
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,750
You included everything I needed
despite the small budget.

69
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,450
It's my job to find a way.

70
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,260
And you also agreed
to settle for lower-cost materials.

71
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,560
I'm really excited.

72
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,490
Me too.

73
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,700
When it's not even your house?

74
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:49,700
When a space changes,
so do the people who live there.

75
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,900
It makes you enjoy
cooking in the kitchen even more...

76
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,870
and feel happier
when you take a shower.

77
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:56,570
It even makes the family gather
in the living room more often.

78
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,240
I work on the design,
imagining things like that.

79
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,250
As construction progresses,

80
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:04,380
I always feel thrilled
to see the house...

81
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,020
gradually transform over time.

82
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,650
You must love your work a lot.

83
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:11,690
Oh, right. And...

84
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:16,390
These are some photos
of lighting and fabrics...

85
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,600
that I think will suit your taste.

86
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:21,700
You can choose
the materials with me,

87
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,870
but many clients forget
to think about lighting and fabrics,

88
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,310
and they end up feeling flustered
at the last minute.

89
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,170
I see.

90
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,780
Thank you.

91
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,180
I should get going, then.

92
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,050
Okay. I'll make sure
to be well prepared...

93
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,350
before the construction starts.

94
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,350
All right.

95
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,990
My gosh. Working as a coordinator
seems pretty good.

96
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,690
You only need to go there
in the morning and evening.

97
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,630
All you need to do
is find workers and materials...

98
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,760
according to the schedule.

99
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,800
Since I don't need to work
on the detailed design,

100
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,330
I should be responsible
for the construction.

101
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,670
I'm heading out to check the site.

102
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,300
- Are you going during the day too?
- Yes.

103
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,600
Because it's the first day.

104
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,700
Will you come back after that...

105
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,140
and go back there in the evening?

106
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,780
Today, I'll work at a nearby cafe...

107
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,380
and come back after checking
how it all wraps up.

108
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,410
Okay.

109
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,210
Coffee's cheaper when you factor in
the commute and transport costs.

110
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,380
I'll see you later.

111
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,590
She does need a car.

112
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,760
That darn Gang Oh.

113
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,770
Ji Hyuk.

114
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,500
Did you not know
your food expenses were covered?

115
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,370
I knew.

116
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,070
Then why are you eating cup noodles?

117
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,480
Didn't the chief order your food?

118
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,410
I'd like to receive
my food expenses in cash.

119
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:49,590
Why? Do you feel bad
that I'm eating cup noodles?

120
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,860
Of course, I do. A lot.

121
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,160
Like that's enough to recharge you,

122
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,430
when I know how much you eat.

123
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:00,700
Ms. Ji, how could you possibly tell
how much strangers eat?

124
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,940
You're not a stranger.
You're a handyman on my project.

125
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,940
Oh, right.

126
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,410
I'm a handyman on your team.

127
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,440
Seriously...

128
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,420
(Cup noodles)

129
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,200
(Mamdaerozip)

130
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:37,600
My goodness. I didn't know
you were here, Mr. Lee.

131
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,840
Are you here
because it's the first day?

132
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,310
Hello.

133
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,610
No, because you are my first client.

134
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,980
I'll help with the work
and check things.

135
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,780
You'll help with the work?

136
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,850
On the schedule, you can find
the days with a handyman.

137
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,050
I'll be the handyman on those days.

138
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,290
I won't be working for free, though.

139
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,490
I should be paid.

140
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,920
I really like your mindset.

141
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,590
I feel reassured to have you here.

142
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,860
The demolition team
should leave soon.

143
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,460
As I texted you this afternoon,

144
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,070
please wire the daily wages
for the chief and him.

145
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,570
Sure.

146
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,900
And the lunch money.

147
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,810
He had lunch separately today.

148
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:20,780
Please send him
an extra ten dollars for lunch.

149
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:22,450
Okay.

150
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:39,400
(Hyunmyeong Apartment)

151
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,840
(Hyunmyeong Apartment)

152
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,610
You don't want to be
on the same bus as me, right?

153
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,930
But I got here first.

154
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,770
Hey, how did it go today?

155
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,870
Hang on. Is the man
in the storage back yet?

156
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,570
The man in the storage?

157
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,140
(If you look
at the company introduction,)

158
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,210
(you'll learn about
Mamdaerozip's system.)

159
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,750
Ji Hyuk, from now on,
wait your turn.

160
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,880
No cutting in line.

161
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,980
I got to the bus stop first,

162
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,450
so I had to get on first.

163
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,850
I did it so you wouldn't have to
see my face.

164
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:40,790
The first person to arrive
should be the first to get on.

165
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,370
Thanks.

166
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,470
What is going on between you two?

167
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,240
He came to my construction site
as a handyman.

168
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,440
Ji Hyuk did?

169
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:04,150
That's why he was soaked in sweat.

170
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,950
He says he needs money.

171
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,950
How can he run a business
when he has no money?

172
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,220
My point, exactly.

173
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,660
Why did you not tell me
when you were here earlier?

174
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,360
I thought I'd explode
if I brought it up.

175
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:20,400
Su Jeong, I'm starving.
I'll go to a convenience store.

176
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,730
Okay.

177
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,620
- Please enjoy it.
- Thank you.

178
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:49,530
Hey. Are you eating
triangle gimbap again?

179
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,770
Wait. What is this smell?

180
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,500
I smell ramyeon.

181
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,570
Really?

182
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,540
I think I'm smelling it too.

183
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,280
I guess Ji Hyuk is eating
cup noodles again.

184
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:05,810
What?

185
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,150
I even left a note
that he couldn't eat raymeon here.

186
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:47,390
The bride seems to be walking
a little slowly.

187
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,120
Please come on out.

188
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,770
I already know you're a jerk,

189
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,770
so don't pretend to be a good guy.

190
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:04,970
That's not like you.

191
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,310
No, scratch that.

192
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,840
This is exactly who you are.

193
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,880
Only I didn't know,
since I was so delusional.

194
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,910
"Ji Eun Oh,"

195
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:20,150
"you and your family
are just too poor for me..."

196
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,150
"to even consider you,
so know your place."

197
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,290
If you had been honest with me,

198
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,290
I would've easily
gotten the message.

199
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:32,160
But right up to the end,
you didn't bother to tell me...

200
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,900
how you really felt...

201
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,200
and left me guessing.

202
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,400
You fed me your twisted logic
and absurd excuses...

203
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,370
while being a pretentious jerk,
until the very end.

204
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,510
What you really wanted...

205
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:46,140
was an easy life,
wealth, and status...

206
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,610
through marriage,

207
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:49,510
even if there was no love...

208
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,750
or affection.

209
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,590
But you pretended otherwise,

210
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:57,560
as if you righteously sided
with the little guys...

211
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,790
and stayed unmarried to remain free.

212
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,990
I'm furious that you lied to me
all this time.

213
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:07,160
It's so infuriating
that it's sickening.

214
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:09,000
This is where it ends between us.

215
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,870
We're no longer friends
or anything else. Got it?

216
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,380
Okay.

217
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,430
We're almost done.

218
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,860
My gosh.

219
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,630
Ha Eun.

220
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,000
Is this enough space?

221
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,370
It's a bit tight.

222
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,770
- But it works.
- It does?

223
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,040
Yes. It's okay.

224
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,240
Okay.

225
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:59,280
Once we get rid of this,
we'll have our studio.

226
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,550
What should we do about that
in the corner?

227
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:03,790
That? I think we can leave it.

228
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:07,260
- I just had a great idea.
- What is it?

229
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,090
I can pull the outfits out
from there one at a time.

230
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,100
What do you think?

231
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,230
Sounds good.

232
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:14,100
I must be a genius.

233
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,330
Here you go.

234
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,770
Eat all you want.

235
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:20,800
I'll eat later with your dad.

236
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,810
Ha Eun, eat all you can.

237
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,610
I will. Thank you.

238
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,150
What's up with her today?

239
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,620
Your mom's an awesome cook.

240
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,020
The food's so good.

241
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,790
Let's see the response.

242
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:45,260
It's the same as yesterday.

243
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,300
(Couple's outfits
for classy art and music events)

244
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,630
His face is blurred,

245
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,970
but his aura shines through it.

246
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,670
Is there another boyfriend
like him out there?

247
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,700
He's a model, not my boyfriend.

248
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,940
He's acting like
he's your boyfriend.

249
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:58,180
I don't know
what he's actually like,

250
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,840
but he has a perfect figure
and a great sense of fashion.

251
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,010
He's even more perfect
on the inside.

252
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,250
He's a third-generation heir.

253
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,380
No one's asking
when our next video will be up.

254
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:11,060
Binny, will this boyfriend
be in the next video?

255
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,420
Binny. If he's not your boyfriend,
can you set me up with him?

256
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,730
Dream on, people.

257
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,430
He's a sweet guy who studied abroad.

258
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:19,160
He's a perfect hexagon
who has everything.

259
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,900
What?

260
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:22,570
A hexagon?

261
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,800
Eun Oh. What are you doing here?

262
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,800
My gosh.

263
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,440
I was just...

264
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:06,240
The cafe felt a bit suffocating.

265
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,380
The cafe?

266
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,350
You feel suffocated in the cafe?

267
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:21,460
I get it,
but at the same time, I don't.

268
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,560
He feels so different
that it's uncomfortable.

269
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,500
No. Maybe I feel this way...

270
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,530
because I don't get it.

271
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:31,700
Why did he suddenly start
his own business?

272
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,700
Why does he have to work
at the cafe, of all places?

273
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,970
And why is he acting like this?

274
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,540
It's all so unfamiliar and weird.

275
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,010
Do I feel uncomfortable
because I don't know...

276
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,650
what Ji Hyuk is doing?

277
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,220
I can't pull all-nighters
at the cafe like I used to.

278
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:50,790
Isn't it too much for him
to intrude on my projects too?

279
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,420
- It is.
- Isn't it?

280
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,730
But Eun Oh.

281
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,600
I think...

282
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,530
what you need right now...

283
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,570
is a businessperson's mindset.

284
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,500
A businessperson's mindset?

285
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,240
I get why you feel the way you do.

286
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:13,180
You said you wanted to treat Ji Hyuk
as if he were a stranger.

287
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,350
That means you want to erase
your shared past.

288
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:20,420
All you have to do is delete him
from your list of acquaintances,

289
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:23,520
no matter what happens later.

290
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,920
You're already sharing a space.

291
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,520
Telling him not to say hi...

292
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,460
and to treat you
like you're invisible.

293
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:34,160
It makes it seem like you still have
some unfinished emotional business.

294
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,440
I really don't feel anything at all.

295
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,810
You're disappointed in him,
and you're angry,

296
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,280
so you don't want to see him again.
I get it.

297
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,610
I'd feel the same too.

298
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,710
But you share a space already,

299
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:50,810
and there's no going back.

300
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:52,520
However,

301
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:56,120
if you can both benefit
from a business perspective,

302
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:59,690
you can still do business together.

303
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:02,890
I see.

304
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:05,400
I guess...

305
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,430
I failed to keep
my feelings and work apart.

306
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,640
I'm just saying
you shouldn't waste your energy.

307
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:28,950
A hexagon?

308
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:32,490
Yes. Seong Jae's a perfect hexagon.

309
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:33,790
Way out of their league.

310
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,860
He is in my league.

311
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,700
He's my brother's best friend.

312
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,600
Yes, Seong Jae.

313
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,800
He's good-looking,
has a great personality,

314
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,040
has a perfect background,

315
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,310
is well-educated, has a good job,

316
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,470
and has lots of money.

317
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:54,240
That's him. It's Seong Jae.

318
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,480
Yes.

319
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,820
Why didn't I think of that?

320
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,750
Hey.

321
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,920
What's this?

322
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:09,060
Su Bin. I wish you the best.

323
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:10,930
Good luck, darling.

324
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:17,770
Mom...

325
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,380
- You're still up?
- What?

326
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,420
- Aren't you tired?
- No.

327
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,220
You know I have enough energy
to run a half-marathon every year.

328
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:39,120
But you study on weekends too.

329
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,790
It's all good,
but you should take a day off.

330
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:44,190
I will,
once I pass the written exam.

331
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,380
Yes, honey.

332
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,980
Let's push our lunch back
by 20 minutes.

333
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,020
Hyeonu Fashion's CEO Min Tae Ho...

334
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,220
suddenly said he'd come by at 11 a.m.

335
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:16,390
I might have to miss
the scholarship ceremony.

336
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,800
It's for business?

337
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,800
Yes.

338
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,500
He's planning to launch a new line,

339
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:25,470
and our shoes suddenly came to mind.

340
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,140
He suggested we collaborate.

341
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:30,510
He brought up something
that important so suddenly?

342
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,780
He's famous for being like that.

343
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:35,410
He's nicknamed "Suddenly"
because he's so impatient.

344
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:40,220
How about we have lunch
some other day?

345
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,150
The meeting could drag on.

346
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,360
I'd feel terrible to do that to you.

347
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,460
Don't say that. That's just silly.

348
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,360
I'll see you at home in the evening.

349
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,180
- Yes, Mom.
- Yeong Ra.

350
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,320
Have lunch with your dad today.

351
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,090
Why?

352
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:16,920
Surprise.

353
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,790
We'll begin...

354
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:24,130
the Gaon Scholarship
certificate presentation ceremony...

355
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:27,100
for students from Sirim High School,

356
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,330
Jayeon High School,
Seongsil Girls' High School,

357
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:32,000
and Haesang High School
for the 2nd half of 2025.

358
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,570
(Gaon Foundation
Scholarship Presentation Ceremony)

359
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:41,010
There will be a welcome speech
by the foundation director.

360
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,190
Hello.

361
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:52,390
I'm Ko Seong Hui,
Gaon Foundation's director.

362
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,260
I'll keep it short.

363
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,790
We're here
to celebrate the students...

364
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:59,700
from each of the schools
who are here...

365
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,670
to receive the scholarship, not me.

366
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,140
Thank you so much
for studying hard...

367
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,200
despite
your difficult circumstances.

368
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:10,910
I wish you good health as you strive
to achieve your dreams.

369
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:21,350
Now, we shall present
the scholarship certificates.

370
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:25,860
Are you all ready?

371
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,330
Smile.

372
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:29,330
(Gaon Foundation)

373
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,100
Congratulations.

374
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,030
- Well done.
- Thank you.

375
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,900
Secretary Ko.
Take them to the restaurant.

376
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,210
I'll take a photo of just you four.

377
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:49,310
I asked you not to come
because it's too embarrassing.

378
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:53,080
Foundations like yours that keep
these ceremonies on the low...

379
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,580
are pretty rare.

380
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,050
Why would you make a big fuss...

381
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:59,460
about a company
sponsoring promising students?

382
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,090
Where's the site you're working on?

383
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,130
I'll come to you.

384
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:05,630
Let's grab lunch together.

385
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,300
I'm at the office today.

386
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,370
I'm aware of how stalkers operate.

387
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,970
I know from experience.

388
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,410
A serious stalker like this...

389
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:22,150
won't back out easily.

390
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:25,520
They lie in wait for hours or days,
hoping their obsession will slip up.

391
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,820
How dare you go after Park Yeong Ra?

392
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,790
Don't you even think about it.
Yeong Ra is under my protection!

393
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:36,960
I'm her friend, after all!

394
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,670
(Seong Jae's Mom)

395
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,600
This is Lee Ji Wan.

396
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,210
Pick Yeong Ra up at the studio
at 11:30 a.m.

397
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:50,140
- Don't be late.
- Sure.

398
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,250
This was not part
of her schedule today.

399
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,420
She never tells me why, though.

400
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:01,820
I'm always in the dark.

401
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,490
All I have to do is drive,
is that it?

402
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:11,360
Why are you headed
to your dad's office today?

403
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:14,660
Mom said
I should have lunch with him.

404
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,670
- Out of the blue?
- Yes.

405
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,740
Why?

406
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:21,470
I don't know.

407
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:27,610
So you're going to lunch with him
because she told you to?

408
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,810
Yes.

409
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:30,350
(Dad)

410
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,920
Dad, it's me.

411
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,920
I was with a friend...

412
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,390
and noticed your office
on the way back.

413
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,090
I thought we could have lunch.

414
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,160
Really?

415
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,100
Sure, come on over, Yeong Ra.

416
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,030
Right.

417
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,130
What would you like to have?

418
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,240
It'll take around an hour
and a half.

419
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:02,810
Sure. I'll grab lunch nearby.

420
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:16,230
- Dad.
- You were already here.

421
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,730
This is such a surprise.

422
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:22,370
Hello, sir.

423
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,430
He's a friend of mine.

424
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,700
This is CEO Min Tae Ho
of Hyeonu Fashion.

425
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,010
- This is my daughter.
- Is that so?

426
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,810
I'm Park Yeong Ra.

427
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:35,950
Goodness. You're even more beautiful
than I had heard.

428
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,910
- Is that so?
- Absolutely.

429
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,020
And here I thought
she was only pretty in my eyes.

430
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,420
As if that makes any sense.

431
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,990
Darn, I'm starving.

432
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:52,060
- You may cross.
- What should I eat?

433
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,400
What?

434
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:57,400
- Seong Jae.
- Hey.

435
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,070
- What?
- It might be dangerous,

436
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,910
so please wait for the next light.

437
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,610
(Hamham Hangover Soup)

438
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,050
Welcome.

439
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:20,820
Would it kill you to talk
while you eat?

440
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:24,390
I need to hurry back.
I've got a pile of work to do.

441
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,400
Say whatever's on your mind.
I'll listen while eating.

442
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,070
I want you to be the one to talk.

443
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:32,870
About what?

444
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,200
Hey.

445
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,470
Before you came back to Seoul
and even after you arrived,

446
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:40,240
you never talked with me...

447
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,550
about starting a business.

448
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,250
I simply didn't have the time...

449
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:49,490
or the luxury
to discuss this with you.

450
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:51,550
As if that's an excuse.

451
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:54,460
Not everyone thinks the same way.

452
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:56,760
Our situation may change
how we think.

453
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,760
Just let it go, Seong Jae.

454
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,270
So?

455
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:04,770
You thought it'd be best
to work out of a storage area?

456
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,100
Yes.

457
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:10,040
Ji Hyuk.

458
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,640
Let's get you a decent office.

459
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,010
I'll invest in your business.

460
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:15,710
- I'll decline.
- Why?

461
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:19,050
Because I'm doing just fine.

462
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,720
How a business looks
from the outside...

463
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:23,650
matters more than you think.

464
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:27,190
Besides, there's more to it
than just you being okay with it.

465
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,890
How long have we been friends,
and what kind of friends are we?

466
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:32,260
Why can't I invest...

467
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,330
in a friend's business?

468
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,030
It's not like I'd pay millions.

469
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:37,700
That's exactly why
I don't need your help.

470
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,770
My future will be bright
despite the humble beginning.

471
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,140
Hey.

472
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:49,010
How can you be this cruel?

473
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,550
Business or not,

474
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,550
she shouldn't have to face you
every day.

475
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,590
Eun Oh and I
already sorted this out.

476
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,660
More like you laid it out on her.

477
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,100
Are you taking her side?

478
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,600
This isn't about
taking someone's side.

479
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,430
My investment in your business
will solve everything.

480
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:13,140
It's best for you
and for Eun Oh too.

481
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:18,210
Seong Jae.

482
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,240
I have my own plan.

483
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,880
I want to make it
without anyone's help.

484
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,850
Sure, but even your business
comes with its issues.

485
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,250
You jumped into this
without thinking it through.

486
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,220
How can a business succeed...

487
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:32,560
when you hardly prepared?
It was only a few months.

488
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,320
I worked so hard...

489
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,860
that it felt like a day was 10 days,
and an hour was 24 hours.

490
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:38,760
Stop being stubborn about this.

491
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,430
You really think less of me,
don't you?

492
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:43,330
Hey, Park Seong Jae.

493
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:45,140
Who are you to tell me
to move offices?

494
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,540
I don't know how you and Eun Oh...

495
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,810
got this close
in the short time I was gone,

496
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:51,780
but zip it.

497
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:55,750
I don't need help from you,
my parents, or anyone else.

498
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,180
Succeed or fail,

499
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,950
I'll do it on my own.

500
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:16,130
Ji Hyuk!

501
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:18,940
What on earth?

502
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,240
Were you in Seoul this whole time?

503
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,570
Are you actually back?
When did you get here?

504
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:23,740
What brings you
to this neighborhood?

505
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,340
Answer me first!

506
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,850
Does everyone have to stand
in my way?

507
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,050
Shut it.

508
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,580
Now, talk.

509
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,950
Don't tell Mom and Dad I'm back.

510
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:38,190
No way. I'm telling them.

511
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,060
Why shouldn't I?

512
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:43,390
Ji Hyuk, don't you think
you're being too selfish?

513
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:46,460
Mom and Grandma were worried sick
about you!

514
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:50,070
- I know.
- If you actually understood,

515
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:52,200
you would've come home
since you were in Seoul.

516
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,440
How could you not even call?

517
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,180
Ji Wan, I started a business.

518
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,350
A business?

519
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,220
You remember the state I was in
when I ran away.

520
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,620
Of course.

521
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:13,090
It was beyond pathetic.

522
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:16,130
Then you must know
the way I wish to be when I return.

523
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:19,130
Which is what?

524
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:22,000
Can't you see that
I want to return as a proud son?

525
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:24,830
I get that,

526
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:27,040
but I don't believe
a word you're saying.

527
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:28,340
How does this make sense?

528
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,210
It's only been a few months
since you left home.

529
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:32,340
How can you start a business,
and with what money?

530
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:35,580
Are you going to keep quiet
if I show you?

531
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:36,780
What?

532
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:39,750
- Sure.
- Follow me.

533
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,250
Hold on, Ji Hyuk.
Did you really start a business?

534
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:53,400
He's upsetting everyone around him.

536
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,240
Ji Hyuk, why are you headed
inside a cafe?

537
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,810
I thought you said
you got yourself an office.

538
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,620
Come in.

539
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:18,560
No way.

540

(Mamdaerozip)

541
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:22,190
You weren't kidding.

542
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,330
CEO Lee Ji Hyuk!

543
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:27,830
I never doubted you.

544
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,600
Keep quiet, or you'll pay.

545
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,840
Of course. I know you become
the Hulk when you're angry.

546
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:37,410
All right. I won't tell the family
until you make it big.

547
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,810
- Return home in glory.
- Don't be gross.

548
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:46,220
By the way, what are you wearing?

549
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,820
Why are you dressed like that?

550
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,690
Get going already!

551
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,160
I have to hurry back anyway.

552
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:58,630
Ji Wan.

553
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,800
Is everyone doing all right?

554
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,210
The family...

555
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,510
is staying strong.

556
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,880
I mean, they're trying to act strong
while waiting for you.

557
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:17,810
Because we believe in you.

558
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,940
Oh, gosh.
You're having a late lunch.

559
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,010
- That would be 1.2 dollars.
- Okay.

560
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:49,510
I had a special lecture.

561
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,920
Have you been working here
for a long time?

562
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:54,950
It's only been a month.

563
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:57,820
I see. Is there anything
you find challenging?

564
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:00,420
No. There's nothing difficult.

565
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,390
Right, thank you.

566
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:03,460
Have a nice day.

567
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,660
Thank you. Bye.

568
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,740
Hey, Ji Hyuk!

569
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,910
I'm sorry.

570
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:19,910
It's all right.

571
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,850
That darn rascal.

572
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,950
He doesn't even call me once.

573
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:30,550
He will be in big trouble
when he comes back home.

574
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,870
Let's get you a decent office.

575
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,270
I'll invest in your business.

576
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:53,140
How can a business succeed...

577
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,480
when you hardly prepared?

578
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,750
You'll come back
when you hear from the company...

579
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:58,850
you applied to, won't you?

580
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:01,180
You must've applied to a few places.

581
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,600
(1,000 dollars)

582
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,300
So you don't trust me either.

583
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,570
Just like how Eun Oh doesn't.

584
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,540
You don't trust me.

585
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:57,910
That...

586
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,480
A businessperson's mindset.

587
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:03,610
Keep business
and personal matters separate.

588
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:14,120
You said you installed the window
because it was suffocating.

589
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:18,730
Now that you've made a hole
in a perfectly good wall,

590
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,160
you should keep the door closed.

591
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,640
Why are you staring at me like that?

592
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,810
Because it feels new.

593
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,980
People have
many different sides to them.

594
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:37,850
What?

595
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,120
I'm not saying it's upsetting.

596
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,320
It's rather surprising.

597
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,060
You have so many talents
I never knew about.

598
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:51,630
You and Seong Jae became
best friends before I knew it.

599
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,660
You must've told him
that you hated me a lot.

600
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,070
Just because I went
to the construction site,

601
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:59,000
Seong Jae got
just as furious as you.

602
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:01,100
You're quite talented.

603
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,440
What...

604
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,210
Darn it.

605
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,950
What's that supposed to mean?

606
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,610
I'm talented?

607
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,850
What do you take me for?

608
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:16,520
What's with the sarcasm?
You think I'm talented?

609
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,250
What do you mean by that?

610
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:22,590
You have every right to hate me,

611
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:24,030
but enough is enough.

612
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,530
Ms. Ji Eun Oh.

613
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,300
Enough.

614
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:31,270
What, am I a traitor
to your family or something?

615
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:33,800
Let's just be like strangers, okay?

616
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,540
What's so hard about that?

617
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,440
You're the one who barged in here!

618
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,110
You're right.

619
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,150
I did.

620
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:49,250
Yes.

621
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,190
I'm sorry about that.

622
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:54,320
Whoever this place belongs to,

623
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,830
and even if I mistreated you
or did something worse,

624
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,760
you don't have the right
to be sarcastic with me.

625
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,900
Why are you being sarcastic?

626
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,670
Seong Jae and I go back nine years.

627
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:07,040
You do. I get it.

628
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,640
I already apologized.

629
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,210
Shall we stop now?

630
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,940
I won't keep the door open
ever again.

631
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:40,200
You must've told him
that you hated me a lot.

632
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,840
Just because I went
to the construction site,

633
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,140
Seong Jae got
just as furious as you.

634
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,540
You're quite talented.

635
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:51,280
Why did I do that?

636
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:54,480
Why did I say that?

637
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,620
He's his friend, after all.

638
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,790
You should've held it back,
Lee Ji Hyuk.

639
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,960
You've already done enough wrong
to Eun Oh.

640
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,670
You stupid thing.

641
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,410
Double S Startup.

642
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:21,780
You have passed the first round...

643
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,810
of the 2025 Early Startup Project.

644
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,150
That's it.

645
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:27,620
This is it.

646
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:30,090
This is how Lee Ji Hyuk should be.

647
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:34,790
Ji Hyuk will never forgive me.

648
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:38,260
I stopped him from studying abroad.

649
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,530
So he majored
in business administration...

650
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:41,660
to get a job.

651
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:44,000
That's why he decided...

652
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:47,000
not to get married
or have children...

653
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,070
as a lower-middle-class citizen.

654
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:51,770
He chose to live a carefree life.
Oh, boy.

655
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:53,740
That's all my fault.

656
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,580
This means
I'm a lousy excuse for a father.

657
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:58,010
So, that's what it is.

658
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:01,150
I wondered
why you were trying so hard.

659
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:04,650
It was because you hurt your child.

660
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:07,920
I mean, it wasn't just
his feelings you hurt.

661
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:11,590
My entire life as Lee Sang Cheol...

662
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,830
was completely despised.

663
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,360
Sang Cheol.

664
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,830
That would be an overinterpretation.

665
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:22,100
Isn't that ridiculous?
I chased after that punk.

666
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,470
I mistook a stranger for Ji Hyuk.

667
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:26,280
The thing is,

668
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:29,110
when your child grows up,
they make you uncomfortable...

669
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:30,380
and afraid.

670
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:33,750
You're right. You can't help
but walk on eggshells.

671
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,990
Still, you pretend
not to be like that,

672
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:39,390
acting as if you were still
a strong, authoritative father.

673
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:44,890
I won't be like that anymore. Never.

674
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,600
You go to an academy
and work part-time every other day.

675
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,400
Is it doable?

676
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,530
Of course.

677
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:53,600
I can handle it. I'm fine.

678
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,410
Are you going out again?

679
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,310
Yes. I told you.

680
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:06,480
I met Myeong Suk,
my hometown friend,

681
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:10,320
and the senior citizen center
in her neighborhood was really nice.

682
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:12,890
Which neighborhood?

683
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,990
I don't know the exact location.

684
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:19,300
And it's not like I'm there all day.

685
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,800
I go to Myeong Suk's place...

686
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,770
and visit her neighbors too.

687
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,870
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

688
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,240
What's gotten into her lately?

689
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:33,410
She used to be such a homebody,

690
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:35,210
but she goes out every day
these days.

691
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:45,190
Finding a job...

692
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:47,290
with an elementary school
teaching license.

693
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:51,790
In my late 50s.

694
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:53,900
(5 certificates for a new beginning)

695
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:56,470
(Jobs for people in their 50s.
Isn't it too late?)

696
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,040
(Where can I find a job
as a daycare teacher?)

697
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,860
In cases like this,
you measure the shape of the wall...

698
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,260
and build the closet...

699
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:29,230
based on the front size,
not the wall itself.

700
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:31,170
I see.
So you fill the gaps inside...

701
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:32,470
using silicone...

702
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:34,240
or cover them with molding.

703
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:37,840
I can tell
you've studied a lot, Mr. Lee.

704
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,040
It's not easy
to pick up on-site know-how.

705
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:42,980
Ji Hyuk.

706
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,680
You're here as a handyman,
so make sure to do your job.

707
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,720
Don't disturb the carpentry chief.

708
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,050
I was talking with him
as he wanted a short break.

709
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:52,050
But you are not working.

710
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,390
We should be finished soon.
Aren't you going to clean up?

711
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:59,430
Chief, who's your
regular materials supplier?

712
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:00,530
The materials look nice.

713
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:01,760
Have you been doing business
with them for a long time?

714
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,000
He keeps asking questions.

715
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,040
Mr. Lee.
Will you be doing business with me?

716
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:08,840
Then I'll tell you.

717
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:12,940
Chief.

718
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,480
Yes, Ms. Ji.

719
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:18,950
Don't you think
the shadow here looks wonky?

720
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,650
What?

721
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,620
It looks even and horizontal,

722
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:24,720
but if you look carefully,
the shadow's uneven.

723
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:26,690
Yes, you're right.

724
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:28,860
Did we push the wood too far?

725
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:32,090
It will become too obvious
when we put in the indirect lights.

726
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:34,930
I think it'll be fine
if you put in a little plank...

727
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:36,470
to make it even.

728
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:38,400
Pretty good.

729
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:41,040
- Cha.
- Yes?

730
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,100
Come over here.

731
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:46,040
Do you see
how the shadow here isn't even?

732
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:58,420
This section needs to be evened out.

733
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:13,700
What was that about?

734
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:23,610
I got on first.

735
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:26,820
He never keeps his word.

736
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:03,350
Thank you.

737
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:09,960
Keep your wits about you.

738
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:15,200
Did you just speak casually to me?

739
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,470
I did. So what?

740
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,470
Get off.

741
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:38,590
I vented to Mr. Park about you.

742
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:41,290
I shouldn't have.

743
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,030
I shouldn't have been
sarcastic about it.

744
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:51,270
We're even, then.

745
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:55,700
Shall we forget about it, then?

746
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,030
Hello.

747
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,560
Did you make up?
You came in together.

748
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:23,170
We didn't come in together.

749
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:25,230
You did. Just a few steps apart.

750
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:27,200
Oh, that?

751
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,910
We happened to come in
around the same time.

752
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:32,810
- What?
- How were the sales today?

753
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:34,880
It was okay.

754
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:36,780
How do you feel?

755
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:40,420
You had to pay for the stuff
you broke because of Gang Oh.

756
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:45,890
I'm telling myself
I paid it to teach him a lesson.

757
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:20,960
Just so you know, we set a date
for the Mapo apartment.

758
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:22,790
When is it?

759
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:25,790
I posted the schedule
outside your office.

760
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:29,400
What...

761
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:31,430
She's still like this?

762
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:33,870
She has no businesswoman's mindset.

763
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:38,810
You can take your credit card.

764
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:41,240
- I'll call when your drink's ready.
- Okay, thanks.

765
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:44,710
Ms. Ji, what's this?

766
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:48,850
Mamdaerozip's site
and the Mapo site.

767
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:51,190
I scheduled them so I don't
have to be at two places at once.

768
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:53,090
I need a briefing.

769
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:56,290
Please.

770
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:58,760
On day one of Eunoism's demolition,

771
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:01,460
I'll check out the Mapo site
first thing in the morning.

772
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,830
That's day two
of painting the Mamdaerozip site,

773
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:04,970
so I'm not needed in the morning.

774
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:07,770
I can drop by in the afternoon
to see how it looks.

775
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,870
On day two
of tearing down the Mapo site,

776
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:11,840
I'll be at Mamdaerozip's site
in the morning.

777
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:13,880
The flooring goes down that day.

778
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:15,910
I'll be at my site
in the afternoon...

779
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:18,050
to wrap up
the last day of demolition.

780
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:20,180
If you look at each date,

781
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:22,450
there's either an O or an X
for each morning and afternoon.

782
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:26,260
That shows where I'll be
so that everything goes smoothly...

783
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:27,960
and nothing overlaps.

784
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:30,890
Do I need to go on?

785
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:34,400
No, I get it now. It makes sense.

786
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:38,430
Gosh, you're really smart.

787
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:42,440
You planned when to begin
working on the Mapo site...

788
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:44,770
based on the schedule
for the Mamdaerozip site.

789
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,680
Yes, but...

790
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:49,180
you're talking down to me again.

791
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:50,980
What?

792
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:56,390
Oh, sorry.
I'm just amazed. That's all.

793
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,190
Was she that clever?

794
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,070
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

795
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,270
(Inwang Industries)

796
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:14,370
Hey.

797
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:17,940
You were all over the news.

798
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:21,440
Why did you put money
in a fake stock firm?

799
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:23,510
Do you think I wanted to?

800
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:24,610
You're a mess.

801
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:26,980
I trusted you and almost lost...

802
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:28,620
my successful singles' bar.

803
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:33,520
Thanks to you, Yang Jin Gu
got a stake in the business.

804
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,420
Seo Dong Wu.
Are you pouring gas on a fire?

805
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:36,430
"Are you pouring gas?"

806
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:38,360
Ji Gang Oh, you fool.

807
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:43,330
Gang Oh. Ask your family
for just 20,000 dollars.

808
00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:45,200
Then I'll make you a partner.

809
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:48,870
The one condition is that
you work at the bar too.

810
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:52,040
You're pretty to look at,

811
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:54,140
so I'll give you a stake
for just 20,000 dollars.

812
00:47:56,450 --> 00:47:58,450
- For 20,000 dollars?
- Yes.

813
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:00,920
Forget it, Gang Oh.

814
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,090
Your sister paid
to get you out of trouble.

815
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:06,190
- Oh, dear.
- He's penniless.

816
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,890
How do you know
if I'm penniless or not?

817
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,790
I'm penniless, but my mom isn't.

818
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:18,570
(Incoming call: Mom)

819
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:22,740
- Where's he going?
- What's that about?

820
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:24,710
Let's drink.

821
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,340
Gang Oh.

822
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:30,280
We're really busy.
You said you'd be here soon.

823
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,380
How many tables do you have?

824
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,520
Enough that I want to call Eun Oh.

825
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:37,190
Fine. I'll be there soon.

826
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:40,190
He's scared of his sister,

827
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:42,560
- but he's still distracted.
- Excuse me.

828
00:48:58,310 --> 00:48:59,310
Oh my.

829
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,290
He looks a lot like my dad.

830
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,030
Hey.

831
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:32,910
Are you here
about the job in Unit 702?

832
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,980
Yes, that's right.

833
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:37,850
It's my first job.
I'm Lee Sang Cheol.

834
00:49:38,010 --> 00:49:39,550
Nice to meet you.

835
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:42,080
- I'm in charge.
- I see.

836
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:44,890
There's still some time.

837
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:46,460
Why did you rush?

838
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:49,490
It's my first time
on an interior job,

839
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:52,130
so I hoped to take a look around.

840
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,860
The security guard won't let me in.

841
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:57,100
Oh, I see.

842
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,540
Mister. Can I see your hands?

843
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:02,470
My hands?

844
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:09,540
You had a desk job your whole life.

845
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:12,780
There are no calluses.

846
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:15,020
Are your shoulders and back
in good shape?

847
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:17,020
Of course, they are.

848
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:19,020
I might not have worked
on an interior design project,

849
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:20,620
but I worked
at a distribution center,

850
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:22,060
sorted through discarded clothes,

851
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,360
and even took jobs...

852
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:25,190
such as shelving at a supermarket.

853
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:26,660
I know.

854
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:28,460
When my dad's business went under,

855
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:29,970
he took every job he could find.

856
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:32,630
I see.

857
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:34,870
Mister,

858
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:37,770
you reminded me of my dad
for three seconds.

859
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:40,710
That's what brought me here
to chat with you.

860
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,580
You just have to follow
the demolition team leader's orders.

861
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:44,910
- It'll be tough, but...
- Goodness.

862
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:46,150
Ms. Ji.

863
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:47,380
You're here.

864
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:52,350
My gosh, thank you
for letting us work with you again.

865
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:53,990
It's a pleasure to see you.

866
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:57,430
Please do a neat job,
as you did last time.

867
00:50:57,430 --> 00:50:58,530
Of course.

868
00:50:58,530 --> 00:50:59,800
By the way, please greet each other.

869
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:00,900
This is Mr. Lee Sang Cheol.

870
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:03,370
Meet the demolition team leader
and his crew.

871
00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:06,030
- Hello.
- The pleasure is mine.

872
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:09,300
You have to tear everything out,

873
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,010
but I put up instructions
on the wall just in case.

874
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:12,770
The gas and water pipes
have been turned off.

875
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:14,710
You don't have to remind me.

876
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:16,610
Pull out some beverages
and get going.

877
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:17,950
You don't want to get covered
in dust.

878
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:18,980
Sure.

879
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:20,650
Let's head inside.

880
00:51:25,490 --> 00:51:28,020
Sir, don't wear
a thin mask like that.

881
00:51:29,490 --> 00:51:30,730
Wear a dustproof mask instead.

882
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:32,430
Oh, I see. Thanks.

883
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:35,860
We're here to work on Unit 702.

884
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:38,800
Off we go.

885
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:41,870
Come on.
You don't have to go upstairs.

886
00:51:41,870 --> 00:51:42,900
I won't be staying for long.

887
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,410
I need to meet a client anyway.

888
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:46,340
The bearing walls have been marked.

889
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:47,740
You don't have to remind me.

890
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,500
I'll get going, then.

891
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,500
- Keep up the good work.
- Have a good day.

892
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:13,600
Have a good one.

893
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:21,740
Director Ko.

894
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,750
It's been a while, Ms. Ji.

895
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:27,750
That was wrong of me, wasn't it?
I've been absent.

896
00:52:27,850 --> 00:52:31,190
Hardly. You said you were busy.

897
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:32,490
I've been working
on other projects anyway.

898
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:34,920
- Let's sit.
- Sure.

899
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:40,900
It's good to see you.

900
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,060
Likewise.

901
00:52:46,170 --> 00:52:48,940
The four drafts you came up with
helped clear my mind.

902
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:50,840
Really? How so?

903
00:52:51,270 --> 00:52:53,310
The studio's art gallery...

904
00:52:53,310 --> 00:52:55,080
should accommodate two painters...

905
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:57,450
and one stationery designer
or product designer.

906
00:52:57,450 --> 00:52:59,410
I thought at least three artists
could share the space.

907
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:02,680
Metal craft has its flair,
though the work can be noisy.

908
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,150
Besides, the space might be
too cramped to share.

909
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:08,320
Even ordinary people,
let alone artists,

910
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,530
need adequate distance
from one another.

911
00:53:10,990 --> 00:53:12,030
Sure.

912
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:13,860
If there are two painters,

913
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:15,460
couldn't the walls serve as space
to display artwork?

914
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:17,170
Of course.

915
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:18,700
I've been meaning to ask.

916
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:21,500
Have you ever considered...

917
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:22,900
letting the public watch
the artists at work?

918
00:53:23,470 --> 00:53:25,310
Even if glass walls must be added,

919
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:27,580
giving people a chance
to see artists at work...

920
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:28,610
might be a charming experience.

921
00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:32,150
I should ask the artists
who wish to work there.

922
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:34,050
It could be distracting for them.

923
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:36,220
Still, it could be a good idea...

924
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:37,520
for stationery
and product designers.

925
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:41,260
Then, the first order of business
would be to decide...

926
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:42,360
which artists to support.

927
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:44,760
Actually,

928
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,960
I'd like us
to choose the mood first.

929
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:51,870
I saw the space in a magazine,

930
00:53:51,870 --> 00:53:53,640
and the interior design
caught my eye.

931
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:59,040
Simple and not too complicated,
but also warm.

932
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,850
That's exactly what I thought.

933
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:14,860
Hold on.

934
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:28,940
Do you like glass art?

935
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,970
I like items...

936
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:35,440
that add charm to a space.

937
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:37,550
You're right.

938
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:39,210
I guess you were drawn here.

939
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:42,620
I was. It's beautiful.

940
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:47,260
I'd like to ask you something.

941
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:49,320
Actually,

942
00:54:49,990 --> 00:54:51,130
I'd like to make a guess.

943
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:53,460
Sorry?

944
00:54:54,430 --> 00:54:56,330
I doubt it's from working on a site,

945
00:54:56,770 --> 00:54:59,470
and it can't be boy trouble
since you said you were single.

946
00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:04,440
So why do I see exhaustion
in your eyes?

947
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:08,480
Or should I say
they seem filled with chaos?

948
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,380
That's what I see.

949
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:12,310
It's what I noticed
the day we first met.

950
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:15,950
I'm sorry.

951
00:55:15,950 --> 00:55:17,850
I must not have seemed focused.

952
00:55:17,850 --> 00:55:19,420
Gosh, don't apologize.

953
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:21,360
I'm just telling you what I saw.

954
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,060
In brief moments,

955
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:25,890
I sensed self-blame.

956
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:34,100
There's someone...

957
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:36,100
I hate,

958
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:38,310
someone who seriously wronged me.

959
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:42,380
He turned out to be
the kind of person I loathe.

960
00:55:43,410 --> 00:55:46,510
I tend to be generous
toward people...

961
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:48,220
in difficult situations,

962
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:53,560
but I haven't been able to,
and it must have taken a toll on me.

963
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:56,990
Then,

964
00:55:57,660 --> 00:55:59,290
be generous to that person.

965
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:00,800
Just be nicer.

966
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:05,070
You can't bring yourself
to be cruel to this person.

967
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:10,040
It's someone
you can't hate entirely.

968
00:56:13,610 --> 00:56:14,680
Excuse me.

969
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:15,910
Yes?

970
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,650
This isn't necessary, Director Ko.

971
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:24,120
This is more than I can accept.

972
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:25,720
How can you know
if this is too expensive?

973
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:27,360
It didn't even have a price tag.

974
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,590
I'm aware of the artist.

975
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:32,130
Really?

976
00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:34,630
Now, I'm really glad I bought it.

977
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:37,000
I got you a gift you'll love.

978
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,270
I should be complimented for that.

979
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:41,540
Still, it's too much.

980
00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:45,510
Does this look like a gift to you?

981
00:56:45,770 --> 00:56:47,380
Do you think I'm giving you a gift?

982
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:50,080
What is it, then?

983
00:56:51,550 --> 00:56:52,750
It's courage.

984
00:56:54,450 --> 00:56:56,120
I'm giving you courage.

985
00:56:56,790 --> 00:56:58,320
I want to give you
words of encouragement,

986
00:56:58,320 --> 00:56:59,790
but words have no power.

987
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,920
That's why I'm giving you this.

988
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:03,120
So that you'd find the courage...

989
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:05,660
and return to who you used to be.

990
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:10,630
That way, you'll be able
to focus better on my project.

991
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,470
The joy of gifts lies more
in giving than receiving.

992
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:20,510
Here.

993
00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:26,110
Then,

994
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:28,480
I'll accept this.

995
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:31,150
Thank you so much, Director Ko.

996
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,060
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

997
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:36,060
- Please enjoy.
- Thank you.

998
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:40,860
Gang Oh.

999
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:43,300
What's wrong with you today?

1000
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:45,170
You're all over the place.

1001
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:46,500
You got the table number wrong...

1002
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:48,100
and made a mistake
while receiving a take-out order.

1003
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:50,070
Are you not feeling well?

1004
00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:52,240
You see,

1005
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:55,110
my stomach's been in pain, Mom.

1006
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:57,150
What? Your stomach?

1007
00:57:57,150 --> 00:57:58,280
What's wrong?

1008
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:00,550
- Do you need to see a doctor?
- No, it's not that bad.

1009
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:03,920
But I could use some rest at home.

1010
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:06,090
Can you call the part-timer
for the evening shift?

1011
00:58:06,390 --> 00:58:07,490
Will resting be enough?

1012
00:58:07,490 --> 00:58:09,120
- I'll stop by the pharmacy.
- But...

1013
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:33,010
Your sister...

1014
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:36,020
should meet someone nice
and settle down soon.

1015
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:38,020
Not even a woman these days
can get married...

1016
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:39,090
without a penny to her name.

1017
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:40,990
Of course not.

1018
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:43,490
I know it. It's here.

1019
00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:45,830
Mom has money saved up for Eun Oh.

1020
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:50,770
A family with no safe or cash?

1021
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:52,530
The closet is the safest spot.

1022
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:29,900
A stack of expired bank books
indicates...

1023
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:32,970
an 87.5 percent chance
of money being here.

1024
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:41,080
What's this?
It's from when Dad died.

1025
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:44,390
Why does she still have the form
for renouncing inheritance?

1026
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:48,560
Mom must be afraid...

1027
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:50,430
that creditors will come
after us again.

1028
00:59:51,490 --> 00:59:54,730
She's too softhearted.

1030
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:10,510

01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:32,770
Oh, dear.

1033
01:00:32,770 --> 01:00:34,470
Oh, no. Sir.

1034
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:38,570
Sir.

1035
01:00:38,570 --> 01:00:40,580
- Oh, no. What do I do? Sir.
- Shoot.

1036
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:48,420
Darn you.

1037
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:53,920
Get out. Get out of the car!

1038
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:55,590
Have you lost your mind?

1039
01:00:55,590 --> 01:00:57,430
Did you see it happen?
Do you have proof?

1040
01:00:57,430 --> 01:00:59,130
It's on your dashcam!

1041
01:00:59,130 --> 01:01:00,460
Get out of the car!

Hey!

01:01:09,370 --> 01:01:11,510
What's going on?
Pull over to the side.

1047
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:15,040
We can't go through because of you.
Who are you anyway?

1048
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:17,850
An old man's on the ground
over there. It's a hit-and-run.

1049
01:01:17,910 --> 01:01:19,610
She's right. Get out of the car.

1050
01:01:19,610 --> 01:01:20,950
It's a hit-and-run. Please help.

1051
01:01:20,950 --> 01:01:22,650
I called the police.
Hop out, mister.

1052
01:01:22,650 --> 01:01:25,520
- Did you see it happen?
- There's an old man on the ground.

1053
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:27,060
Get out already.

1054
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:31,330
We're watching right now.

1055
01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:34,460
Get out.

You committed a hit-and-run.

1065
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:23,210
Get out already. A man's down.

1066
01:02:23,710 --> 01:02:24,710
Get out.

01:02:26,410 --> 01:02:27,420
Hurry up.

1068
01:02:32,090 --> 01:02:33,450
How pathetic.

1069
01:02:35,990 --> 01:02:38,130
I gave birth to that thing?

1070
01:03:16,730 --> 01:03:19,630
(Our Golden Days)

1071
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:21,500
It wasn't just any second marriage.

1072
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:23,700
I had nothing to show for.

1073
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:26,370
A tiger with no fangs will starve.

1074
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:28,840
Why doesn't your mother
give a heads-up?

1075
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:29,940
Isn't it suffocating?

1076
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:32,410
Seong Jae?
Is he her boyfriend or what?

1077
01:03:32,810 --> 01:03:34,950
Why are you here so early, Ms. Ji?

1078
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:36,520
A coordinator's job...

1079
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:39,790
is to manage a project
from start to finish.

1080
01:03:39,790 --> 01:03:42,060
She's so stubborn. It's so annoying.

1081
01:03:42,190 --> 01:03:43,960
You're not their birth daughter!

1082
01:03:44,130 --> 01:03:46,790
You bullied me all this time,
knowing we weren't even related?

1083
01:03:46,930 --> 01:03:48,060
Who are you people?

1084
01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:49,630
Why should I care how she feels?

1085
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:50,830
You have no shame.
