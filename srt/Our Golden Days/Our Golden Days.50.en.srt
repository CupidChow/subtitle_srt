(Final Episode)

2
00:00:14,308 --> 00:00:16,148
Why isn't anyone here yet?

3
00:00:17,978 --> 00:00:22,088
- Are you with Mr. Lee Sang Cheol? - Yes. I'm his son.

4
00:00:33,628 --> 00:00:34,698
Dad.

5
00:00:44,608 --> 00:00:45,908
Where's Ji Hyuk?

6
00:00:50,018 --> 00:00:51,018
Dad.

7
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:52,918
About Ji Hyuk...

8
00:00:53,988 --> 00:00:55,888
They said he'll recover quickly with treatment.

9
00:01:10,038 --> 00:01:11,098
Dad.

10
00:01:11,668 --> 00:01:12,668
Dad.

11
00:01:12,808 --> 00:01:13,838
Dad!

12
00:01:15,878 --> 00:01:18,078
- Sir, can you hear me? - Please step aside.

13
00:01:18,138 --> 00:01:19,508
- Doctor. - Prep for CPR.

14
00:01:19,578 --> 00:01:22,648
- Sir, you need to step outside. - No, Dad...

15
00:01:22,718 --> 00:01:24,418
- Sir, you need to leave now. - Dad!

16
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:26,618
- You can't be in here. - Dad!

17
00:01:26,618 --> 00:01:28,118
- Dad! - Sir, please.

19
00:01:35,158 --> 00:01:36,198
Ji Wan.

20
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,528
What happened? What's going on?

21
00:01:39,968 --> 00:01:41,528
What do you mean Dad was in a car accident?

22
00:01:41,898 --> 00:01:44,068
And Ji Hyuk is in a coma? What's going on?

23
00:01:44,238 --> 00:01:47,468
I called to tell him that Ji Hyuk was in a coma,

24
00:01:47,838 --> 00:01:50,138
and on his way here, he had an accident at a crosswalk.

25
00:01:51,238 --> 00:01:52,478
He was hit by a truck.

26
00:01:55,848 --> 00:01:57,778
So how's Dad doing right now?

27
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:00,588
How bad is it? And what about Ji Hyuk?

28
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:02,588
Ji Wan.

29
00:02:04,788 --> 00:02:05,888
Ji Hyuk...

30
00:02:06,388 --> 00:02:07,888
is in the same condition.

31
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,398
And Dad...

32
00:02:13,528 --> 00:02:14,928
went into cardiac arrest.

33
00:02:18,808 --> 00:02:19,838
What?

34
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:22,378
Cardiac arrest? Your dad?

35
00:02:23,908 --> 00:02:25,208
Right in front of me...

36
00:02:25,948 --> 00:02:27,448
But they made me leave, so...

37
00:02:28,718 --> 00:02:30,748
- Mom... - Mother.

38
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,588
Mom, what do we do?

39
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:39,558
Mr. Lee Sang Cheol's family?

40
00:02:43,098 --> 00:02:45,258
Doctor, how is our dad?

41
00:02:45,328 --> 00:02:48,098
We were able to restart his heart with CPR.

42
00:02:50,668 --> 00:02:53,838
Thank God. Thank you.

43
00:03:24,698 --> 00:03:25,738
Dad.

44
00:03:26,408 --> 00:03:27,568
What happened?

45
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:29,408
I found her in front of our house.

46
00:03:29,908 --> 00:03:31,408
She'd collapsed right by the front gate.

47
00:03:32,578 --> 00:03:36,048
She took the pills a while ago, so they gave her activated charcoal.

48
00:03:36,948 --> 00:03:38,318
They said it's not life-threatening.

49
00:03:43,988 --> 00:03:45,488
But why in front of our house?

50
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:52,328
Do you really think Mom was trying to kill herself?

51
00:03:54,128 --> 00:03:55,698
She might have been.

52
00:03:56,938 --> 00:03:59,368
Of all nights, I had dinner plans tonight,

53
00:04:00,138 --> 00:04:02,478
and both you and Seong Jae were coming home late.

54
00:04:04,178 --> 00:04:05,508
Her room is ready.

55
00:04:06,348 --> 00:04:08,708
- Okay. - What about her belongings?

56
00:04:10,548 --> 00:04:14,988
- Did you leave them in the car? - No, she had nothing on her.

57
00:04:16,158 --> 00:04:17,188
What about her phone?

58
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:18,958
She didn't have her phone, either.

59
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,068
Then she really was trying to die?

60
00:04:42,618 --> 00:04:43,848
How are you feeling?

61
00:04:45,078 --> 00:04:46,548
Who saved me?

62
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:49,088
Were you really trying to kill yourself?

63
00:04:49,888 --> 00:04:51,418
I had no other choice.

64
00:04:53,928 --> 00:04:56,658
But why take the pills in front of our house?

65
00:04:57,298 --> 00:04:59,898
I wanted to know if my fate was to die,

66
00:05:00,998 --> 00:05:03,068
or if I was meant to live on.

67
00:05:08,138 --> 00:05:09,608
Dad's the one who found you.

68
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:20,388
When can I get out of here?

69
00:05:22,148 --> 00:05:23,518
They said they have to see how you're doing first.

70
00:05:28,288 --> 00:05:29,298
Mr. Lee Ji Hyuk...

71
00:05:29,798 --> 00:05:31,728
is now cleared to receive the heart transplant.

72
00:05:34,528 --> 00:05:35,738
Thank you.

73
00:05:36,998 --> 00:05:38,198
Thank you so much.

74
00:05:48,378 --> 00:05:51,248
He saves my life, then doesn't even show his face.

75
00:05:54,448 --> 00:05:55,988
What is he playing at?

76
00:06:11,368 --> 00:06:12,508
What is it you want?

77
00:06:19,878 --> 00:06:21,278
There's nothing I want.

78
00:06:22,318 --> 00:06:23,818
You made sure of that.

79
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:27,018
You want to move back into my house, don't you?

80
00:06:28,318 --> 00:06:30,218
Is that why you took those pills in front of the house?

81
00:06:36,898 --> 00:06:38,258
I need an answer.

82
00:06:39,168 --> 00:06:40,898
I asked you. What is it that you want?

83
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:43,598
If you weren't going to let me move back in,

84
00:06:45,598 --> 00:06:48,608
you should have just left me there.

85
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:51,138
The fact that I took those pills,

86
00:06:51,738 --> 00:06:52,848
and whatever happens from now on,

87
00:06:53,678 --> 00:06:55,308
it's all in your hands.

88
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:57,418
What can I possibly do?

89
00:06:59,788 --> 00:07:01,418
That's why I did it there.

90
00:07:05,928 --> 00:07:07,128
Fine. Move in.

91
00:07:10,658 --> 00:07:11,758
But on one condition.

92
00:07:12,428 --> 00:07:14,798
All the real estate in your name...

93
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:18,898
and everything in your safe... Donate it all.

94
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:24,378
Come back with nothing, and I'll let you live in my house.

95
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:26,948
I'll do it.

96
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:32,248
The donation comes first.

97
00:07:33,048 --> 00:07:35,048
And you have to sign a pledge that the donation is voluntary.

98
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:38,318
Stay at the hospital until this is all settled.

99
00:07:40,428 --> 00:07:42,288
Yes, okay.

100
00:07:46,298 --> 00:07:47,368
I understand.

101
00:07:52,908 --> 00:07:53,908
Ji Hyuk.

102
00:07:55,468 --> 00:07:58,108
You got this. Hang in there.

103
00:07:59,448 --> 00:08:01,548
Ji Hyuk, I'll see you after.

104

108
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,508
- Look. There's a showroom here. - Should we check it out?

109
00:08:45,388 --> 00:08:48,088
We've had a lot more foot traffic since our grand opening.

110
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:50,998
Since it's closer to the subway than our old showroom,

111
00:08:51,058 --> 00:08:53,198
our focus on accessibility is paying off.

112
00:08:53,198 --> 00:08:55,368
Many people are just dropping by.

113
00:08:55,798 --> 00:08:58,398
I know. Should we work our way down from the ninth floor?

114
00:09:07,908 --> 00:09:11,748
I knew it. The model home is definitely a big draw.

115
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:15,788
It's easier for customers to choose when they see and touch materials.

116
00:09:16,818 --> 00:09:19,828
My kitchen layout is really cramped,

117
00:09:20,158 --> 00:09:22,128
so I'd like to add more storage space.

118
00:09:22,258 --> 00:09:26,398
We offer custom builds, so what if we designed it like this?

119

Is our staff taking good care of you?

121
00:09:32,068 --> 00:09:35,138
Yes. She gave me great suggestions for my space,

122
00:09:35,238 --> 00:09:36,308
so it's been very helpful.

123
00:09:36,738 --> 00:09:39,978
- Take your time and look around. - I will.

124
00:09:40,908 --> 00:09:41,908
Let's go.

125
00:09:42,618 --> 00:09:45,078

Not bad. Let me see what I can come up with.

00:12:40,228 --> 00:12:41,228
I won't be long.

182
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:45,058
Take your time, Mommy. We'll be here playing.

183
00:12:45,128 --> 00:12:48,498
All right, Geon Woo. What sticker should we use next?

184
00:12:48,928 --> 00:12:52,168
"I'm sorry I took your mommy away without asking."

185
00:12:54,508 --> 00:12:56,108
Hold on a second. Keep reading.

186
00:13:01,048 --> 00:13:02,818
(Geon Woo's Maternal Grandmother)

187
00:13:04,178 --> 00:13:08,618
- Hello? - Hello there. Is this a bad time?

188
00:13:09,048 --> 00:13:11,588
Not at all. The kids aren't all here yet.

189
00:13:12,118 --> 00:13:14,328
But they'll be stampeding in here in about ten minutes.

190
00:13:14,528 --> 00:13:17,128
I see. The reason I'm calling is...

191
00:13:17,598 --> 00:13:19,668
We're still on for tomorrow, right?

192
00:13:20,098 --> 00:13:22,328
How could I forget? It's our day to see Geon Woo.

193
00:13:23,638 --> 00:13:26,308
Okay. See you tomorrow.

194
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:35,178
- Dong Seok, let's read. Come here. - Okay.

195
00:13:37,878 --> 00:13:40,548
- Dad, I'm home. - Hey, you.

196
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,488
You're home.

197
00:13:45,418 --> 00:13:46,688
What's for dinner tonight?

198
00:13:47,288 --> 00:13:48,888
LA-style short ribs and sea bream soup.

199
00:13:49,928 --> 00:13:51,028
Ms. Ko.

200
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:53,428
Seong Jae needs to watch his cholesterol levels,

201
00:13:53,698 --> 00:13:57,298
so I believe I mentioned we should limit meat to once a week.

202
00:13:57,898 --> 00:14:00,938
Did you? Sorry about that.

203
00:14:03,338 --> 00:14:06,608
- Father, we're going to wash up. - Okay. Go ahead.

204
00:14:19,318 --> 00:14:22,428
I filmed a daily life vlog today to promote our new spring line.

205
00:14:23,928 --> 00:14:26,968
You launched your brand last year, and I hear it's doing quite well.

206
00:14:27,728 --> 00:14:32,238
I think it's because there are few vintage or retro-inspired brands.

207
00:14:33,368 --> 00:14:36,678
She said her aim was a niche market, but she's a total workaholic.

208
00:14:36,938 --> 00:14:39,308
We're spending less and less time together, Dad.

209
00:14:40,278 --> 00:14:42,878
Seong Jae, are you tattling on me to your dad?

210
00:14:43,678 --> 00:14:44,678
Seong Jae.

211
00:14:45,748 --> 00:14:46,948
Once you two have a child,

212
00:14:47,788 --> 00:14:49,958
you and Su Bin will have plenty of time together.

213
00:14:50,858 --> 00:14:53,228
Honey, just because Su Bin has a child,

214
00:14:53,288 --> 00:14:56,398
it doesn't mean she's the type to just stay at home like I did.

215
00:14:57,698 --> 00:14:59,128
Dad, not this again.

216
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:03,298
I said we're waiting to have kids. Su Bin isn't even 30 yet.

217
00:15:04,638 --> 00:15:07,038
The younger you have kids, the better.

218
00:15:08,268 --> 00:15:10,138
But you're not getting any younger.

219
00:15:10,408 --> 00:15:11,638
That's what I'm saying.

220
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:13,048
That's my point.

221
00:15:13,678 --> 00:15:16,248
Why must Su Bin make sacrifices just because she married me?

222
00:15:16,718 --> 00:15:19,348
Su Bin should do what she wants. No, that's not what I mean.

223
00:15:19,988 --> 00:15:21,788
To be honest, I...

224
00:15:22,818 --> 00:15:24,088
I'm perfectly happy with just Su Bin.

225
00:15:24,718 --> 00:15:27,528
You sound just like your father.

226
00:15:28,258 --> 00:15:31,228
Gosh, that's so cheesy.

227
00:15:34,468 --> 00:15:36,968
The wait for a grandchild is going to kill me, you brat.

228
00:15:39,938 --> 00:15:40,968
Oh, boy.

229
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,348
That was a good meal.

230
00:15:47,078 --> 00:15:49,718
I'm heading up. You two have your tea.

231
00:15:50,448 --> 00:15:51,778
- Good night, Father. - Yes.

232
00:15:51,848 --> 00:15:53,588
- Get some rest. - Good night.

233
00:15:54,188 --> 00:15:55,918
Could you have some herbal tea sent up for us?

234
00:15:58,818 --> 00:16:01,058
Ms. Ko, please do the dishes.

235
00:16:57,678 --> 00:17:01,418
- Hello, everyone. I've got... - She's my daughter-in-law.

236
00:17:01,418 --> 00:17:03,918
some exciting news for you. Can you guess what it is?

237
00:17:04,388 --> 00:17:07,128
Ta-da! Yes!

238
00:17:07,828 --> 00:17:10,198
I finally hit one million subscribers!

239
00:17:35,618 --> 00:17:38,288
Eun Oh. Time to get up.

240
00:17:40,388 --> 00:17:42,488
Just a little longer.

241
00:17:44,058 --> 00:17:45,998
Come on, get up!

242
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,928
Hey! Stop it.

243
00:17:48,128 --> 00:17:51,098
- Careful, you'll wake up Geon Woo. - Okay.

244
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:52,568
- Get up. - Stop.

245
00:17:58,508 --> 00:17:59,508
Oh, boy.

246
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:03,018
- Goodness. - Father. Does your back hurt?

247
00:18:03,118 --> 00:18:04,178
No, I'm fine.

248
00:18:07,148 --> 00:18:09,658
I guess I'm just another year older now,

249
00:18:10,388 --> 00:18:14,028
so I feel stiff every time I get up. Oh, boy.

250
00:18:14,628 --> 00:18:18,058
- I'm going to get some air. - Okay, see you later.

251
00:18:18,728 --> 00:18:20,498
(Organic rice, rice 2kg)

252
00:18:20,568 --> 00:18:21,628
(Ms. Frugal)

253
00:18:21,698 --> 00:18:22,928
I'm interested.

254
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:25,898
Ms. Ko.

255
00:18:30,438 --> 00:18:31,878
When you go grocery shopping later,

256
00:18:32,438 --> 00:18:34,208
could you also pick up ingredients for japchae?

257
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,148
Oh, Korean beef?

258
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:40,218
- This is a lot. - It's for ten servings.

259
00:18:40,588 --> 00:18:42,618
And please don't forget the receipt.

260
00:18:43,518 --> 00:18:45,388
The receipt? Of course.

261
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:58,268
Can we meet in front of the grocery store today?

262
00:18:58,768 --> 00:18:59,838
Price is firm.

263
00:19:14,548 --> 00:19:17,258
("To Keep from Loving," Mr. Lee)

264
00:19:20,858 --> 00:19:24,128
("Take My Heart")

265
00:19:29,228 --> 00:19:30,268
Is that any good?

266
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,208
What?

267
00:19:37,138 --> 00:19:38,278
It's you.

268
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,748
After all your interviews, everyone knows your face,

269
00:19:42,108 --> 00:19:43,778
and you're asking me if your own book is any good?

270
00:19:47,588 --> 00:19:51,558
Hey, when your new book comes out, you're supposed to send a copy,

271
00:19:51,618 --> 00:19:52,618
especially to your in-laws.

272
00:19:53,228 --> 00:19:54,528
Hey, I was going to send you one.

273
00:19:55,058 --> 00:19:57,158
What, did you come here to buy one to boost my sales?

274
00:19:57,828 --> 00:20:00,468
- That's not why. - Then why are you buying my book?

275
00:20:00,768 --> 00:20:02,028
You can just read it on Neiro.

276
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:05,568
There was something I wanted to take my time and review,

277
00:20:05,868 --> 00:20:08,808
but since we ran into each other, let's talk for a minute.

278
00:20:09,438 --> 00:20:10,538
There's something I need to discuss.

279
00:20:12,638 --> 00:20:13,648
With me?

280
00:20:14,908 --> 00:20:16,148
Let's go to my studio.

281
00:20:19,048 --> 00:20:21,948
You're still using the same studio, I hear?

282
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:25,158
Because everything I worked on there was a success.

283
00:20:27,858 --> 00:20:31,298
I finished "Urban Rapunzel" on my own there.

284
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:33,168
Without anyone's help.

285
00:20:34,528 --> 00:20:38,598
(3 years ago, after Ji Hyuk's surgery)

286
00:20:48,278 --> 00:20:50,078
Hey. You're here?

287
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:58,418
Your face has gotten so thin.

288
00:21:00,228 --> 00:21:01,258
It must have been rough.

289
00:21:02,058 --> 00:21:03,428
You fell behind because of me, didn't you?

290
00:21:04,228 --> 00:21:05,328
How far did you get?

291
00:21:05,858 --> 00:21:08,198
Ji Wan, let's talk for a minute first.

292
00:21:09,028 --> 00:21:10,068
Let's focus on work first.

293
00:21:11,538 --> 00:21:12,538
On second thought.

294
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:14,468
Let's finish the conversation we were having.

295
00:21:15,238 --> 00:21:16,538
The one in the car.

296
00:21:17,378 --> 00:21:18,938
I was smiling because of you.

297
00:21:19,238 --> 00:21:21,378
You were cute playing my girlfriend.

298
00:21:21,678 --> 00:21:22,748
Just cute?

299
00:21:23,748 --> 00:21:24,918
Didn't I make your heart flutter?

300
00:21:26,688 --> 00:21:27,818
For me, you're...

301
00:21:30,858 --> 00:21:31,888
I...

302
00:21:32,888 --> 00:21:33,958
get butterflies when I see you.

303
00:21:35,228 --> 00:21:37,298
That's what you were going to say, right?

304
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:41,098
Yes.

305
00:21:43,838 --> 00:21:46,168
- So, does this mean we're... - Nothing.

306
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:47,708
Let's not do it.

307
00:21:49,878 --> 00:21:52,878
Not do anything?

308
00:21:54,478 --> 00:21:56,278
I mean, let's just work.

309
00:21:58,478 --> 00:21:59,478
Why?

310
00:22:00,488 --> 00:22:01,988
For you, right now,

311
00:22:02,648 --> 00:22:05,188
what's more important to you? Your webtoon career or dating?

312
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:09,528
My career as a webtoon artist.

313
00:22:10,528 --> 00:22:12,598
For me, my work is more important right now, too.

314
00:22:13,058 --> 00:22:15,268
I'm just starting out in a new field, you know.

315
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,598
So for now,

316
00:22:18,038 --> 00:22:21,768
I think we both just need to focus on our careers.

317
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:25,738
But we're working on that together.

318
00:22:26,808 --> 00:22:28,948
So why can't we date and work at the same time?

319
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:32,078
Besides, aren't things complicated enough for us?

320
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:35,588
Ji Hyuk and Eun Oh. Eun Oh and your mom.

321
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,258
Seong Jae and Su Bin, too.

322
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,658
We're all way too interconnected.

323
00:22:43,058 --> 00:22:46,668
These are our feelings. Why worry about family already?

324
00:22:47,768 --> 00:22:50,698
Isn't it cowardly not to even give it a try?

325
00:22:50,768 --> 00:22:52,798
It's not about being a coward.

326
00:22:53,098 --> 00:22:56,808
It's better not to start something that might not even last.

327
00:22:57,338 --> 00:22:59,608
It's not like our mutual feelings are that serious anyway.

328
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:02,248
But we've already started to have feelings for each other.

329
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:05,718
And feelings aren't something we can just control.

330
00:23:06,148 --> 00:23:07,148
No.

331
00:23:08,018 --> 00:23:09,018
We can.

332
00:23:10,618 --> 00:23:14,458
If we're going to work together, we have to sort out our feelings.

333
00:23:15,558 --> 00:23:16,558
And what if I can't?

334
00:23:18,428 --> 00:23:19,658
Then our collaboration...

335
00:23:20,228 --> 00:23:21,228
is off.

336
00:23:22,668 --> 00:23:25,238
("Pork Belly In-Laws")

337
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:27,038
Have a seat.

338
00:23:27,968 --> 00:23:30,178
Not pork belly, but "Pork Belly In-Laws?"

339
00:23:30,678 --> 00:23:32,308
Is this your new project?

340
00:23:33,948 --> 00:23:36,818
You can't peek at someone's work before the first chapter's even out.

341
00:23:39,148 --> 00:23:40,388
Dropping the formalities, are we?

342
00:23:42,218 --> 00:23:43,518
My apologies, in-law.

343
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:53,428
So why did you switch from webtoons to writing web novels?

344
00:23:54,898 --> 00:23:57,238
Collaborating with others is tough.

345
00:23:57,568 --> 00:24:01,138
So I tried writing on my own, since I'm always full of ideas.

346
00:24:02,368 --> 00:24:03,538
I see.

347
00:24:04,208 --> 00:24:05,638
So it must've been hard for you working with me, too.

348
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:08,508
No, not with you. But that other artist...

349
00:24:12,948 --> 00:24:15,218
Anyway, enough chitchat.

350
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:17,518
What was it you wanted to discuss with me?

351
00:24:21,328 --> 00:24:25,858
I want to adapt this into a webtoon. How much for the rights?

352
00:24:28,028 --> 00:24:32,868
Instead of a fee, let me adapt "Take My Heart" into a web novel.

353
00:24:37,308 --> 00:24:39,138
I just couldn't stop thinking about it.

354
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:41,278
That's why I went to the bookstore earlier.

355
00:24:41,948 --> 00:24:46,318
Wait, my first book just came out, and you didn't even buy a copy?

356
00:24:46,378 --> 00:24:50,688
Hey! Your first book comes out, and you think I wouldn't buy it?

357
00:24:51,218 --> 00:24:53,428
I'm keeping that one at home as a collector's item.

358
00:24:53,488 --> 00:24:56,088
I was buying this for reference, like a textbook.

359
00:24:58,058 --> 00:24:59,928
- Really? - Yes.

360
00:25:02,398 --> 00:25:06,168
But for any additions or changes, you have to run them by me first.

361
00:25:07,008 --> 00:25:08,008
The same goes for you.

362
00:25:09,468 --> 00:25:11,138
So, should we draw up the contract here today?

363
00:25:11,578 --> 00:25:12,578
Sure.

364
00:25:14,278 --> 00:25:16,348
When we discuss this project, we'll meet at your studio.

365
00:25:16,408 --> 00:25:19,078
And when you review my work, we'll meet at mine.

366
00:25:19,548 --> 00:25:20,548
Deal.

367
00:25:22,148 --> 00:25:24,718
By the way, do you like living alone in your studio apartment?

368
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:27,758
It's comfortable, I guess.

369
00:25:29,788 --> 00:25:31,458
But it's not like I moved out for the fun of it.

370
00:25:32,258 --> 00:25:34,468
Home didn't feel like home, so I had to get my own place.

371
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:43,208
(Organic rice)

372
00:25:44,808 --> 00:25:46,008
That'll be three dollars, please.

373
00:25:48,278 --> 00:25:49,348
Here you go.

374
00:25:54,048 --> 00:25:56,418
- All set? - Yes, thank you.

375
00:26:10,138 --> 00:26:11,898
Where does the time go?

376
00:26:12,338 --> 00:26:13,868
It's already time to do the monthly books.

377
00:26:19,508 --> 00:26:20,878
(Premium skincare products)

378
00:26:20,878 --> 00:26:25,378
Cheap, expires in 6 months. Retails for 400 dollars in stores.

379
00:26:26,548 --> 00:26:28,318
Maybe I should take this down.

380
00:26:29,188 --> 00:26:31,718
The sell-by date is different from the use-by date, though.

381
00:26:33,218 --> 00:26:34,928
Maybe I'll drop the price to five dollars.

382
00:26:40,428 --> 00:26:42,528
- Please check. - Okay.

383
00:26:48,168 --> 00:26:49,738
Make sure you're entering the numbers correctly.

384
00:26:52,008 --> 00:26:55,008
Why are there 2 bags of rice, one 10kg and the other 2kg?

385
00:26:55,408 --> 00:26:56,978
Because we're out of the 12kg bags.

386
00:27:05,318 --> 00:27:06,388
Geon Woo.

387
00:27:06,988 --> 00:27:09,658
My goodness. Welcome, come on in.

388
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:14,698
- Geon Woo, Grandma's here. - My sweet Geon Woo.

389
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:16,968
Have you gotten even more handsome?

390
00:27:17,498 --> 00:27:22,238
I know, right? I see him daily and am still amazed.

391
00:27:22,408 --> 00:27:25,438
He's getting to be quite a handful. It must be tough on you.

392
00:27:25,538 --> 00:27:28,008
What? Not at all.

393
00:27:28,178 --> 00:27:30,818
Actually, you've helped me achieve a lifelong wish.

394
00:27:32,848 --> 00:27:33,848
(2 years earlier)

395
00:27:33,848 --> 00:27:36,958
Of course, I should raise him so Eun Oh can keep working.

396
00:27:37,458 --> 00:27:39,218
Is that why you came? Because you were worried?

397
00:27:39,718 --> 00:27:40,958
Well...

398
00:27:41,858 --> 00:27:43,158
It's not that...

399
00:27:44,358 --> 00:27:47,398
I was wondering if I could raise him.

400
00:27:48,498 --> 00:27:52,638
But you run a restaurant. How would you have time for a child?

401
00:27:53,568 --> 00:27:57,478
It's well-established now, and I have a manager.

402
00:27:57,538 --> 00:28:01,308
And Gang Oh is so diligent, so they don't even need me there.

403
00:28:01,808 --> 00:28:04,278
Then you should be taking it easy.

404
00:28:05,448 --> 00:28:09,388
Ji Hyuk, would you prefer your mother to look after him?

405
00:28:10,718 --> 00:28:13,288
No, that's not what I meant at all.

406
00:28:13,788 --> 00:28:15,358
When I met Eun Oh,

407
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:18,398
she was already four years old.

408
00:28:19,658 --> 00:28:22,298
I always regretted that I never got to see her as a baby.

409
00:28:24,238 --> 00:28:27,868
I never got to raise you when you were just a tiny baby.

410
00:28:28,408 --> 00:28:29,408
And so,

411
00:28:29,838 --> 00:28:32,308
I would love more than anything to raise Eun Oh's baby.

412
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:37,448
And you spent so many years looking after your parents-in-law...

413
00:28:37,518 --> 00:28:40,788
and running a huge household. You've worked so hard.

414
00:28:40,988 --> 00:28:43,388
I really think you deserve to rest now.

415
00:28:48,088 --> 00:28:51,058
Eun Oh, Ji Hyuk. What do you two think?

416
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:57,938
Wow. Most grandmothers these days try to get out of babysitting,

417
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:00,808
but in our family, you're both fighting for the job.

418
00:29:02,308 --> 00:29:03,308
Eun Oh.

419
00:29:04,038 --> 00:29:07,778
You're not upset I asked your mom, are you?

420
00:29:08,948 --> 00:29:10,478
No, of course not.

421
00:29:12,818 --> 00:29:14,148
Then...

422
00:29:14,518 --> 00:29:16,118
why don't you move in here with them?

423
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:17,488
Pardon?

424
00:29:18,188 --> 00:29:20,058
No, I couldn't.

425
00:29:20,628 --> 00:29:22,428
Just like you said,

426
00:29:22,958 --> 00:29:25,198
I've been managing a big household for a long time.

427
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:30,698
Kids, I've always wanted to try living on my own.

428
00:29:31,268 --> 00:29:32,268
Mom.

429
00:29:34,768 --> 00:29:35,768
Mom...

430
00:29:36,368 --> 00:29:37,438
You really wanted that?

431
00:29:38,708 --> 00:29:41,048
Thanks to you, I can finally get my own studio...

432
00:29:41,978 --> 00:29:43,878
and try living freely on my own.

433
00:29:45,448 --> 00:29:47,688
Wait, then...

434
00:29:48,418 --> 00:29:50,488
would you like to use our place for now?

435
00:29:53,388 --> 00:29:56,888
It's so hard to get out of the house when you're babysitting.

436
00:29:57,128 --> 00:30:00,628
When I have plans, I've got you to trade off with, right?

437
00:30:00,898 --> 00:30:02,868
Take your time and get everything done.

438
00:30:02,928 --> 00:30:05,738
Okay. I'm going to go have some fun for a change.

439
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:09,308
- Geon Woo, bye! - Bye, Grandma!

440
00:30:09,368 --> 00:30:11,208
Okay, I'm heading out.

441
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:15,248
- Wave to Grandma again. Bye! - Bye!

442
00:30:16,708 --> 00:30:18,818
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

443
00:30:18,978 --> 00:30:20,048
This is it. The place I always go to...

444
00:30:24,758 --> 00:30:26,018
- Hi! - You made it!

445
00:30:27,558 --> 00:30:28,558
Wow, it's packed.

446
00:30:28,628 --> 00:30:31,998
It's thanks to you. I kept visiting your place and saw how well you did,

447
00:30:32,058 --> 00:30:33,768
- and that's why I opened my own. - That's right.

448
00:30:33,828 --> 00:30:36,198
After tasting it, I wanted in on the action.

449
00:30:36,898 --> 00:30:39,568
Here, have a seat. You too, Gang Oh.

450
00:30:42,038 --> 00:30:43,138
Oh, boy.

451
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:50,718
Three plates for me, one for Mom.

452
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:52,278
(Place order)

453
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:56,488
It's your friend's new restaurant. I have to do my part to boost sales.

454
00:30:56,548 --> 00:31:00,558
Wow, my son. You're finally spending your money the right way.

455
00:31:09,498 --> 00:31:10,498
So, how is it?

456
00:31:11,098 --> 00:31:12,468
It's delicious, of course.

457
00:31:14,368 --> 00:31:17,908
- I hear business is booming. - Yes. You were a lifesaver.

458
00:31:18,238 --> 00:31:19,778
I really don't know what I'd do without you.

459
00:31:20,408 --> 00:31:22,708
- Just don't forget why you started. - I won't.

460
00:31:24,278 --> 00:31:25,518
Eat up.

461
00:31:32,318 --> 00:31:34,028
I can do that for you.

462
00:31:34,388 --> 00:31:35,388
No, it's okay.

463
00:31:35,388 --> 00:31:37,298
I'm taking it with me, so I should be the one to do it.

464
00:31:42,898 --> 00:31:44,138
What's that delicious smell?

465
00:31:44,438 --> 00:31:46,768
- Father, you're home. - Yes.

466
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:49,038
I'm just browning the meat for some japchae.

467
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:52,878
I see. You know, the japchae you make is delicious.

468
00:31:53,708 --> 00:31:56,978
You're going to save some for me, right?

469
00:31:57,818 --> 00:31:59,048
Of course.

470
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:01,118
I'm home.

471
00:32:02,888 --> 00:32:05,158
- Hey. - Did it go well with the platform?

472
00:32:05,258 --> 00:32:08,858
- Yes. Su Bin, water, please? Dad. - What? Yes?

473
00:32:09,328 --> 00:32:10,628
Here, take this before you go up.

474
00:32:12,128 --> 00:32:13,128
What's this?

475
00:32:13,198 --> 00:32:17,598
You always seem so stiff, Dad. I was worried, so I got you this.

476
00:32:18,068 --> 00:32:20,368
Since it's the holiday, I got you the good stuff.

477
00:32:20,808 --> 00:32:23,368
Wow. To think I'd live to see the day...

478
00:32:23,738 --> 00:32:26,378
you're looking after my health. Thanks, son.

479
00:32:28,078 --> 00:32:29,778
Then again, I guess...

480
00:32:30,778 --> 00:32:32,348
I'm at that age where I need looking after.

481
00:32:42,288 --> 00:32:43,288
What's that?

482
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:50,798
This is for you too, Ms. Ko.

483
00:32:51,668 --> 00:32:54,608
Gosh, just when I was thinking how hard it is to get up and down.

484
00:33:02,048 --> 00:33:05,618
Oh, I feel better already.

485
00:33:13,188 --> 00:33:15,428
Hello, this is Kim Da Jeong.

486
00:33:16,358 --> 00:33:18,798
Yes, this is her daughter.

487
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:21,298
Hey, Su Bin.

488
00:33:21,868 --> 00:33:23,938
Mom, what did you have for dinner?

489
00:33:24,768 --> 00:33:27,768
I had some of the fresh kimchi I was making for your dad earlier.

490
00:33:28,238 --> 00:33:29,238
Just kimchi?

491
00:33:29,638 --> 00:33:31,238
Is that all you ate? You're not eating properly.

492
00:33:31,578 --> 00:33:33,438
Stop nagging me like you're my mother.

493
00:33:34,678 --> 00:33:36,248
Mother, what are you up to?

494
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:39,948
Just reading the book for my book club next week.

495
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:42,548
Why are you two still up?

496
00:33:43,318 --> 00:33:46,258
We just wanted to check on you. We're off to bed. See you tomorrow.

497
00:33:49,258 --> 00:33:51,128
My mom has so many hobbies.

498
00:33:52,028 --> 00:33:53,698
She never had the time for them her whole life.

499
00:33:57,768 --> 00:33:59,068
Come on, let's get some sleep.

500
00:33:59,898 --> 00:34:00,908
Come here.

501
00:34:05,438 --> 00:34:06,578
- Honey. - Yes?

502
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:08,608
We should find a hobby we can do together.

503
00:34:09,048 --> 00:34:10,048
What?

504
00:34:10,818 --> 00:34:13,378
But you're my hobby.

505
00:34:15,748 --> 00:34:17,458
Gosh, I can't breathe.

506
00:34:27,828 --> 00:34:28,898
It's good.

507
00:34:28,898 --> 00:34:31,738
Su Bin, how long are you planning to live with your in-laws?

508
00:34:32,098 --> 00:34:33,668
Seriously, why are you even living there?

509
00:34:34,408 --> 00:34:36,538
The food's great, and I don't have to do housework.

510
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:38,378
Plus, I can look after my father-in-law...

511
00:34:38,638 --> 00:34:39,978
and keep an eye on Ms. Ko.

512
00:34:41,748 --> 00:34:43,308
You still call her Ms. Ko?

513
00:34:43,878 --> 00:34:45,448
It's a strict order from my father.

514
00:34:46,978 --> 00:34:49,418
Wow, and I thought he'd only do that for a year or so.

515
00:34:50,658 --> 00:34:52,758
You know what they say. "Deeper love, deeper wound."

516
00:34:53,018 --> 00:34:54,758
It just shows how much he adored her.

517
00:34:55,488 --> 00:34:56,588
You're right, Mom.

518
00:34:58,458 --> 00:34:59,758
By the way, Ji Hyuk.

519
00:35:00,558 --> 00:35:03,028
I hear you're getting home from work later and later these days.

520
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,468
That was me. I told on you.

521
00:35:07,068 --> 00:35:10,208
Come on, why? I said to work late for emergencies.

522
00:35:10,368 --> 00:35:12,278
Didn't you say you were happy the company's growing?

523
00:35:12,908 --> 00:35:15,448
Does a company just grow on its own if the CEO clocks out on time?

524
00:35:16,148 --> 00:35:18,878
I think growing a company is just like raising a child.

525
00:35:19,278 --> 00:35:21,488
- Geon Woo is a handful, too. - He sure is.

526
00:35:21,548 --> 00:35:24,458
Mother. How in the world did you raise three kids?

527
00:35:24,818 --> 00:35:25,818
It must've been so difficult.

528
00:35:26,658 --> 00:35:27,688
It was.

529
00:35:28,228 --> 00:35:29,288
But it had its good moments, too.

530
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:33,458
You should pick Park Jeong Hyeon. She's perfect for the part.

531
00:35:34,168 --> 00:35:35,268
Yes, Park Jeong Hyeon would be great.

532
00:35:35,868 --> 00:35:37,328
But I'm just the original author.

533
00:35:37,898 --> 00:35:39,568
I'll have to ask the production team when I meet them.

534
00:35:41,408 --> 00:35:45,238
The bachelors get along so well. I wonder what they're whispering.

535
00:35:46,508 --> 00:35:48,548
Gang Oh said to cast Park Jeong Hyeon...

536
00:35:48,548 --> 00:35:49,748
in the drama based on my web novel.

537
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:51,448
Oh, my.

538
00:35:51,748 --> 00:35:54,048
What's next? Will you ask him to set you up?

539
00:35:54,348 --> 00:35:57,218
Eun Oh, I know my place. Can't a guy even be a fan?

540
00:35:57,418 --> 00:35:59,388
Don't put yourself down.

541
00:35:59,758 --> 00:36:01,928
You're a top franchise entrepreneur in the country.

542
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:06,358
Gang Oh. Does Ji Wan make you run a lot of errands?

543
00:36:07,628 --> 00:36:11,268
It's fine. I'm used to running them for my sister, Eun Oh.

544
00:36:11,698 --> 00:36:14,708
Hey, when did I ever make you run that many errands?

545
00:36:16,168 --> 00:36:18,408
I know the youngest child's plight all too well.

546
00:36:19,638 --> 00:36:23,548
As a kid, my brothers made me run so many errands that my dad...

547
00:36:29,888 --> 00:36:33,318
"She's not your errand girl, you brats!"

548
00:36:33,318 --> 00:36:35,258
He'd say that and buy me chocolate.

549
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:41,398
Oh, dear.

550
00:36:42,628 --> 00:36:44,298
Leave it to her to bring that up.

551
00:36:46,598 --> 00:36:48,438
But Mom, there's something I've been wanting to ask.

552
00:36:49,538 --> 00:36:51,138
It's the third anniversary of Dad's passing.

553
00:36:51,938 --> 00:36:52,938
Don't you feel like crying?

554
00:36:53,638 --> 00:36:54,808
Why would I cry?

555
00:36:55,578 --> 00:36:57,308
This is the happiness your father left behind for us.

556
00:36:59,518 --> 00:37:01,788
If Ji Hyuk had passed away that day,

557
00:37:02,588 --> 00:37:05,188
we would never be able to gather together and laugh like this.

558
00:37:06,658 --> 00:37:08,958
Looking at you all would just remind me of him,

559
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:11,328
and looking at Seong Jae would remind me of him, too.

560
00:37:12,928 --> 00:37:16,698
Our birthdays, the holidays... Any time without Ji Hyuk,

561
00:37:17,538 --> 00:37:20,398
any time our family gathered like this...

562
00:37:21,908 --> 00:37:23,668
Those would have been...

563
00:37:23,668 --> 00:37:25,578
the most painful moments for your father and me.

564
00:37:26,238 --> 00:37:27,238
For the rest of our lives.

565
00:37:29,378 --> 00:37:30,608
Forgive me for saying so.

566
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:37,018
(3 years earlier)

567
00:37:37,218 --> 00:37:38,318
Mr. Lee Sang Cheol's family?

568
00:37:42,158 --> 00:37:43,858
Doctor, how is our dad?

569
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:46,858
We were able to restart his heart with CPR.

570
00:37:49,698 --> 00:37:52,768
Thank God. Thank you.

571
00:37:56,438 --> 00:37:59,208
However, he hasn't regained consciousness.

572
00:38:02,378 --> 00:38:03,378
What?

573
00:38:03,908 --> 00:38:05,018
What do you mean by that?

574
00:38:05,618 --> 00:38:08,918
During the accident, his brain was without oxygen for a time.

575
00:38:09,888 --> 00:38:12,558
His heart is beating now, but he's not breathing on his own,

576
00:38:12,818 --> 00:38:15,188
and he has no brainstem reflexes.

577
00:38:15,828 --> 00:38:16,988
We suspect brain damage.

578
00:38:18,698 --> 00:38:21,098
So, are you saying...

579
00:38:21,728 --> 00:38:22,828
that there's no chance...

580
00:38:23,798 --> 00:38:25,338
of recovery at all?

581
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:27,498
We'll continue to monitor him, but...

582
00:38:28,168 --> 00:38:31,408
Yes, his brain is not functioning at all.

583
00:38:31,808 --> 00:38:33,408
We believe recovery is unlikely.

584
00:38:35,448 --> 00:38:36,448
Honey.

585
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:38,448
Dad...

586
00:38:41,318 --> 00:38:42,318
Dad.

587
00:38:47,518 --> 00:38:48,588
Doctor.

588
00:38:49,428 --> 00:38:50,928
Could I please see my husband?

589
00:38:52,528 --> 00:38:53,528
This way.

590
00:39:32,368 --> 00:39:33,368
Mother.

591
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:35,838
I brought you some warm herbal tea. You should have some.

592
00:39:39,208 --> 00:39:41,278
I warmed up some soup, too, just in case.

593
00:39:42,248 --> 00:39:43,308
I don't have an appetite.

594
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:44,948
You two have it.

595
00:39:46,278 --> 00:39:48,688
You haven't had a single sip of water all night.

596
00:39:49,348 --> 00:39:50,548
Mom, you're going to collapse, too.

597
00:39:51,018 --> 00:39:52,018
Who's collapsing?

598
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:55,658
Doctor.

599
00:39:58,198 --> 00:40:00,458
- Doctor. - I was told the family was here.

600
00:40:01,428 --> 00:40:03,728
My dad... How is he?

601
00:40:05,198 --> 00:40:07,298
What I'm about to tell you...

602
00:40:07,708 --> 00:40:09,168
is the conclusion we've reached after...

603
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:11,138
two rounds of examinations.

604
00:40:13,208 --> 00:40:15,808
Mr. Lee Sang Cheol is currently unable to breathe on his own...

605
00:40:16,478 --> 00:40:19,518
and is entirely dependent on a ventilator.

606
00:40:20,148 --> 00:40:22,588
Furthermore, in the brainstem reflex test,

607
00:40:23,418 --> 00:40:24,858
he showed no pupillary response to light,

608
00:40:25,288 --> 00:40:27,758
and he had no reaction to pain whatsoever.

609
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:38,968
Taking all these results into account,

610
00:40:39,638 --> 00:40:42,808
he meets the medical criteria for brain death.

611
00:40:44,268 --> 00:40:45,278
Dad.

612
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:50,278
Mom, what's going to happen to Dad?

613
00:40:54,348 --> 00:40:55,418
Father.

614
00:40:56,688 --> 00:41:00,158
Maintaining his current condition is life-sustaining treatment.

615
00:41:00,818 --> 00:41:03,088
You'll need to decide whether to take him off the ventilator...

616
00:41:03,458 --> 00:41:07,768
or continue with life support. Please discuss it and let us know.

617
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:09,328
We will not continue life support.

618
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:11,738
Mom, wait a minute.

619
00:41:12,168 --> 00:41:15,638
But his body was warm yesterday. His heart was still beating.

620
00:41:16,368 --> 00:41:17,738
Only his heart is beating.

621
00:41:19,178 --> 00:41:20,978
Your dad's brain is already dead.

622
00:41:21,748 --> 00:41:23,948
I know, but...

623
00:41:25,678 --> 00:41:27,718
Let's just give him one more day.

624
00:41:28,918 --> 00:41:31,818
I still have so much to tell him!

625
00:41:32,518 --> 00:41:33,658
He can't hear you.

626
00:41:35,728 --> 00:41:38,928
The part of his brain that could hear you is already dead.

627
00:41:43,298 --> 00:41:44,298
Ji Wan.

628
00:41:45,398 --> 00:41:47,038
Show the doctor that video.

629
00:41:49,868 --> 00:41:50,868
What video?

630
00:41:52,638 --> 00:41:53,708
In the Intensive Care Unit,

631
00:41:54,808 --> 00:41:57,978
my father recorded a video will.

632
00:42:12,428 --> 00:42:13,428
Dad.

633
00:42:22,808 --> 00:42:24,778
Ji Hyuk?

634
00:42:27,438 --> 00:42:28,448
He's...

635
00:42:33,248 --> 00:42:34,848
Your phone.

636
00:42:36,418 --> 00:42:37,518
Video.

637
00:42:40,218 --> 00:42:41,228
Why?

638
00:42:49,468 --> 00:42:51,098
Like this?

639
00:42:54,668 --> 00:42:55,938
If possible...

640
00:42:58,078 --> 00:43:00,508
I, Lee Sang Cheol, want to give my heart...

641
00:43:02,478 --> 00:43:04,948
to Lee Ji Hyuk.

642
00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:09,118
To no one else.

643
00:43:10,118 --> 00:43:11,258
It's not allowed.

644
00:43:12,958 --> 00:43:16,028
Give it only to Lee Ji Hyuk.

645
00:43:18,158 --> 00:43:19,158
Dad.

646
00:43:21,598 --> 00:43:23,328
Why would you say something like that?

647
00:43:24,738 --> 00:43:25,868
I'm sorry.

648
00:43:28,508 --> 00:43:30,108
For the harsh things I said...

649
00:43:32,208 --> 00:43:34,508
I was just being petty.

650
00:43:36,248 --> 00:43:37,478
My accident...

651
00:43:38,978 --> 00:43:40,748
Never tell anyone.

652
00:43:42,588 --> 00:43:43,588
Honey,

653
00:43:45,788 --> 00:43:47,088
I'm sorry for everything,

654
00:43:48,958 --> 00:43:50,058
and thank you for everything.

655
00:43:52,628 --> 00:43:53,628
Ji Wan.

656
00:43:55,068 --> 00:43:56,128
Su Bin.

657
00:43:58,038 --> 00:43:59,138
I love you.

658
00:44:05,308 --> 00:44:06,308
Dad.

659
00:44:07,608 --> 00:44:08,608
No.

660
00:44:09,378 --> 00:44:11,278
They said you'll be fine with treatment.

661
00:44:15,388 --> 00:44:16,848
Don't feel sorry.

662
00:44:19,518 --> 00:44:20,518
Everyone...

663
00:44:22,358 --> 00:44:23,928
I love you all.

664
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:40,608
Dad!

665
00:44:41,378 --> 00:44:42,378
Dad...

666
00:44:43,978 --> 00:44:46,378
- Sir, can you hear me? - Please step aside.

667
00:44:46,448 --> 00:44:47,818
- Doctor. - Prep for CPR.

668
00:44:47,878 --> 00:44:50,818
- Sir, you need to step outside. - No, Dad...

669
00:44:50,918 --> 00:44:52,858
- Sir, you need to leave now. - Dad!

670
00:44:52,918 --> 00:44:57,028
- You can't be in here. - Dad!

671
00:44:57,088 --> 00:44:58,528
You can't be in here, sir.

672
00:44:58,898 --> 00:45:00,628
Dad, no!

673
00:45:07,698 --> 00:45:09,068
If my husband's heart...

674
00:45:10,408 --> 00:45:11,738
is a match for Ji Hyuk,

675
00:45:14,008 --> 00:45:15,378
please perform the transplant.

676
00:45:17,248 --> 00:45:18,248
Understood.

677
00:45:19,978 --> 00:45:24,348
However, we must first confirm if Mr. Lee's heart is a match.

678
00:45:24,988 --> 00:45:26,618
We have to run a suitability test.

679
00:45:27,158 --> 00:45:30,758
We need another legal declaration of brain death from the committee.

680
00:45:31,728 --> 00:45:33,298
Please don't get your hopes up too high.

681
00:45:33,928 --> 00:45:35,798
It may not be a match.

682
00:45:38,998 --> 00:45:39,998
It will be a match.

683
00:46:10,668 --> 00:46:14,468
We ran Mr. Lee's suitability test. It's a match for your son.

684
00:46:15,238 --> 00:46:16,238
So, does that mean...

685
00:46:16,738 --> 00:46:17,738
Mr. Lee Ji Hyuk...

686
00:46:18,508 --> 00:46:20,638
is now cleared to receive the heart transplant.

687
00:46:24,778 --> 00:46:25,778
Thank you.

688
00:46:26,748 --> 00:46:30,048
Also, it turns out Mr. Lee Sang Cheol recently had...

689
00:46:30,188 --> 00:46:32,818
a full cardiac exam at this hospital.

690
00:46:33,558 --> 00:46:35,488
So that shortened the process.

691
00:46:37,458 --> 00:46:39,328
And thanks to the video he recorded,

692
00:46:39,558 --> 00:46:43,068
Ji Hyuk was prioritized for the transplant.

693
00:46:44,198 --> 00:46:45,198
Really?

694
00:46:47,938 --> 00:46:49,468
He was in more of a rush than I was.

695
00:46:51,408 --> 00:46:52,708
Always preparing, "just in case."

696
00:46:54,338 --> 00:46:55,508
He really did everything he could.

697
00:46:58,448 --> 00:47:00,178
He must've been even more desperate than I was.

698
00:47:41,688 --> 00:47:43,228
You're still so warm.

699
00:47:47,858 --> 00:47:48,868
Honey.

700
00:47:51,128 --> 00:47:52,498
They're saying you're brain-dead.

701
00:47:56,708 --> 00:47:57,868
The moment the accident happened,

702
00:47:59,708 --> 00:48:01,138
did you make a wish?

703
00:48:03,348 --> 00:48:06,578
As I was falling from the crash, I made a wish.

704
00:48:08,818 --> 00:48:09,818
Then...

705
00:48:10,918 --> 00:48:12,088
your heart...

706
00:48:14,088 --> 00:48:15,958
It's okay if I give it to Ji Hyuk, right?

707
00:48:19,828 --> 00:48:23,068
Actually, I already told them to.

708
00:48:24,428 --> 00:48:25,498
I made the decision.

709
00:48:28,338 --> 00:48:30,108
Of course it is, silly.

710
00:48:33,278 --> 00:48:34,878
I'm sorry I can't just...

711
00:48:36,878 --> 00:48:39,248
mourn for you alone, honey.

712
00:48:45,888 --> 00:48:48,658
But I know you would've been relieved, too.

713
00:48:49,558 --> 00:48:50,988
So I feel relieved as well.

714
00:48:51,898 --> 00:48:53,228
That's what I'll choose to believe.

715
00:48:55,968 --> 00:48:57,198
Because if it were me,

716
00:48:58,068 --> 00:48:59,268
I would've wanted the same thing.

717
00:49:03,738 --> 00:49:04,738
Honey...

718
00:49:05,838 --> 00:49:07,508
You're happy even now, aren't you?

719
00:49:09,308 --> 00:49:11,678
That your heart was able to save Ji Hyuk.

720
00:49:14,248 --> 00:49:15,488
You're happy, right?

721
00:49:21,088 --> 00:49:22,088
My love.

722
00:49:24,258 --> 00:49:25,258
Sang Cheol.

723
00:49:29,168 --> 00:49:30,198
Goodbye.

724
00:49:31,368 --> 00:49:33,098
Don't you worry about me.

725
00:49:40,438 --> 00:49:42,908
You spent your whole life providing for our family,

726
00:49:48,688 --> 00:49:52,518
you poor thing. This is heartbreaking.

727
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:06,298
What do I do?

728
00:50:35,568 --> 00:50:37,998
Dad. I love you.

729
00:50:40,768 --> 00:50:42,068
Dad, I love you.

730
00:50:44,508 --> 00:50:45,508
Father.

731
00:50:46,808 --> 00:50:48,008
Rest in peace.

732
00:50:49,478 --> 00:50:50,508
Mr. Lee.

733
00:50:51,408 --> 00:50:52,618
Rest in peace.

734
00:50:54,078 --> 00:50:55,088
Mr. Early.

735
00:50:56,018 --> 00:50:57,148
Thank you for everything.

736
00:50:59,758 --> 00:51:00,788
Ji Hyuk.

737
00:51:01,318 --> 00:51:03,828
Be strong. You have to get through this.

738
00:51:16,938 --> 00:51:19,178
Ji Hyuk, I'll see you soon.

739
00:51:20,078 --> 00:51:21,178
You have to pull through.

740
00:51:28,788 --> 00:51:31,918
(Restricted Area)

741
00:51:31,988 --> 00:51:32,988
(Operating Center)

742
00:51:33,058 --> 00:51:34,388
(Intensive Care Unit)

743
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:37,328
That day, we were all sad.

744
00:51:38,928 --> 00:51:40,328
And we were all overjoyed.

745
00:51:41,498 --> 00:51:42,798
That's why that day...

746
00:51:43,228 --> 00:51:44,528
is one I'll never forget.

747
00:51:53,108 --> 00:51:54,278
At first, I...

748
00:51:54,638 --> 00:51:56,778
wondered if Dad caused the accident on purpose.

749
00:51:57,878 --> 00:51:59,218
I even had thoughts like that.

750
00:51:59,648 --> 00:52:00,648
Me, too.

751
00:52:01,378 --> 00:52:02,718
The timing was just too perfect.

752
00:52:03,148 --> 00:52:05,518
You don't just get in an accident and become brain-dead,

753
00:52:05,588 --> 00:52:07,958
and there was no guarantee his heart would even be a match.

754
00:52:12,258 --> 00:52:15,868
Su Bin was so desperate to know, so I checked the CCTV footage.

755
00:52:16,768 --> 00:52:17,768
But that's not what happened.

756
00:52:19,068 --> 00:52:21,968
Your dad was trying to hail a cab across the street.

757
00:52:22,238 --> 00:52:26,008
The second the light changed, he just bolted out into the road.

758
00:52:26,578 --> 00:52:27,638
And the truck...

759
00:52:28,208 --> 00:52:29,648
was trying to beat the yellow light...

760
00:52:30,478 --> 00:52:31,948
and was speeding.

761
00:52:38,048 --> 00:52:40,918
Do you think the accident happened because Dad wished for it so badly?

762
00:52:43,358 --> 00:52:46,298
Though, for Ji Hyuk, it was a miracle.

763
00:52:47,828 --> 00:52:49,998
The accident was a blessing for your father, too.

764
00:52:53,398 --> 00:52:56,638
If Ji Hyuk had died back then,

765
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:00,738
your dad couldn't have handled it. Neither could I.

766
00:53:03,078 --> 00:53:04,378
Really? You think so?

767
00:53:05,948 --> 00:53:08,818
Think about it in terms of Geon Woo. The answer becomes obvious.

768
00:53:09,988 --> 00:53:11,418
Do we bring children into this world...

769
00:53:12,388 --> 00:53:15,988
just to see them live short lives and die?

770
00:53:16,828 --> 00:53:18,628
How could anyone bear that kind of regret?

771
00:53:19,198 --> 00:53:20,258
I know.

772
00:53:21,058 --> 00:53:23,298
I know that feeling all too well.

773
00:53:32,378 --> 00:53:33,378
Anyway...

774
00:53:34,708 --> 00:53:36,148
Is Geon Woo still asleep?

775
00:53:39,748 --> 00:53:41,818
When everyone's gathered like this...

776
00:53:42,688 --> 00:53:44,918
His aunt, uncles, and grandmas...

777
00:53:45,918 --> 00:53:47,318
It's a little overwhelming for him.

778
00:53:48,318 --> 00:53:51,858
So thanks to him, we get to eat and chat in peace.

779
00:53:52,358 --> 00:53:53,698
He's just the absolute cutest.

780
00:53:54,298 --> 00:53:55,998
Look at her. And then there's you, Su Bin...

781
00:54:01,168 --> 00:54:02,908
Su Bin, what's wrong?

782
00:54:05,778 --> 00:54:07,238
That oyster is not sitting well with me.

783
00:54:10,178 --> 00:54:11,208
My goodness.

784
00:54:12,678 --> 00:54:16,518
When I was pregnant with Su Bin, oysters made me sick first.

785
00:54:18,618 --> 00:54:19,688
Morning sickness?

786
00:54:24,358 --> 00:54:25,358
Oh, my.

787
00:54:36,038 --> 00:54:37,608
The taste of this perilla stew is off.

788
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:39,838
Be more careful with the ingredients.

789
00:54:40,708 --> 00:54:41,708
Really?

790
00:54:42,678 --> 00:54:44,948
- Okay, I will. - Forget the tea.

791
00:54:46,248 --> 00:54:47,248
Sure.

792
00:55:29,458 --> 00:55:30,558
A present for the little one!

793
00:55:34,198 --> 00:55:35,528
It's so cute.

794
00:55:37,968 --> 00:55:42,638
You're busy. How did you find time to prepare such a thoughtful gift?

795
00:55:46,208 --> 00:55:48,778
Because this baby is such a blessing to our family.

796
00:55:49,408 --> 00:55:50,548
Just like you.

797
00:55:54,018 --> 00:55:56,688
Dad. What about you, Dad? No present?

798
00:55:57,718 --> 00:55:59,818
- Cash? - Yes, I have something.

799
00:56:00,318 --> 00:56:01,988
Seong Jae. Su Bin.

800
00:56:02,358 --> 00:56:03,728
I want you two out of this house immediately.

801
00:56:06,498 --> 00:56:08,228
There's a townhouse in Hodam-dong.

802
00:56:08,868 --> 00:56:10,898
I had it renovated early this year and left it vacant.

803
00:56:11,998 --> 00:56:13,698
You can move in right away,

804
00:56:14,468 --> 00:56:16,968
or you're welcome to redecorate it to your liking, Su Bin.

805
00:56:17,838 --> 00:56:21,008
Or, you can take the new apartment in Cheongsu-dong,

806
00:56:21,208 --> 00:56:22,848
where residents can start moving in this February.

807
00:56:23,848 --> 00:56:25,548
This house is no place to raise a child.

808
00:56:29,088 --> 00:56:31,818
You two. You should listen to Dad.

809
00:56:32,658 --> 00:56:34,618
I've been talking to Dad about this for a while now.

810
00:56:36,128 --> 00:56:37,228
This house...

811
00:56:37,828 --> 00:56:39,698
is not a healthy environment for the baby.

812
00:56:41,358 --> 00:56:43,968
Father, if we move out,

813
00:56:44,768 --> 00:56:45,968
are you sure you'll be okay?

814
00:56:47,498 --> 00:56:48,498
Dad.

815
00:56:49,338 --> 00:56:50,908
You still haven't changed your mind?

816
00:56:52,908 --> 00:56:57,608
I really wish you'd divorce Mom and find someone new.

817
00:56:58,648 --> 00:56:59,818
I'm fine.

818
00:57:00,618 --> 00:57:03,148
She is being punished for deceiving me,

819
00:57:03,818 --> 00:57:06,458
and I am being punished for letting her deceive me.

820
00:57:07,418 --> 00:57:10,788
Our life together is just us punishing each other.

821
00:57:13,128 --> 00:57:14,428
Seong Jae. Yeong Ra.

822
00:57:14,998 --> 00:57:17,268
I am truly sorry to you both.

823
00:57:18,498 --> 00:57:20,798
Dad, you don't have to feel sorry for us anymore.

824
00:57:21,638 --> 00:57:24,338
My brother and I have moved on, and we're doing fine now.

825
00:57:25,938 --> 00:57:27,138
She's right, Father.

826
00:57:28,178 --> 00:57:29,178
We're...

827
00:57:30,308 --> 00:57:31,378
We're happy.

828
00:57:32,448 --> 00:57:34,348
Your own happiness is more important...

829
00:57:35,078 --> 00:57:37,648
than worrying about the money Ms. Ko would get.

830
00:57:38,518 --> 00:57:39,818
I really hope you see that.

831
00:57:40,688 --> 00:57:44,358
I won't be made a fool of and get divorced a second time.

832
00:57:45,658 --> 00:57:48,158
And I am not giving her a dime in a divorce.

833
00:57:50,998 --> 00:57:52,568
Just stay out of it.

834
00:57:53,238 --> 00:57:55,508
We're monsters, both of us.

835
00:57:56,638 --> 00:57:58,808
That's why my grandchild...

836
00:58:01,138 --> 00:58:02,578
must live with just you two.

837
00:58:13,718 --> 00:58:15,958
There, that's 12 dollars.

838
00:58:55,468 --> 00:58:57,798
That's 447 dollars.

839
00:59:02,608 --> 00:59:04,668
Why are you just getting in now?

840
00:59:06,708 --> 00:59:07,878
How much have you saved up?

841
00:59:08,978 --> 00:59:10,408
I have 447 dollars.

842
00:59:12,478 --> 00:59:13,978
Quite a nest egg for three years of saving.

843
00:59:16,788 --> 00:59:18,248
So what are you going to do with all that money?

844
00:59:19,818 --> 00:59:20,818
It's just...

845
00:59:21,858 --> 00:59:23,658
I feel so empty, so I save it.

846
00:59:24,258 --> 00:59:26,258
It's important to have some money of your own.

847
00:59:27,998 --> 00:59:28,998
Mom, are you...

848
00:59:29,728 --> 00:59:30,928
waiting for Woo Jin?

849
00:59:38,068 --> 00:59:39,108
No.

850
00:59:39,678 --> 00:59:41,338
He got a job in the US, didn't he?

851
00:59:42,038 --> 00:59:43,778
Why would I wait for someone who isn't coming back?

852
00:59:44,478 --> 00:59:46,148
I doubt he'd even look for me if he came back.

853
00:59:49,318 --> 00:59:51,918
I wish you would leave this house, Mom.

854
00:59:52,288 --> 00:59:55,188
Work at a restaurant or as a cleaner like Dad wanted.

855
00:59:56,128 --> 00:59:57,658
I just wish you'd live that way.

856
01:00:00,598 --> 01:00:01,728
Do you feel sorry for me?

857
01:00:02,268 --> 01:00:03,798
I just don't get it.

858
01:00:05,738 --> 01:00:06,738
Yeong Ra.

859
01:00:07,498 --> 01:00:08,868
What do you think?

860
01:00:09,438 --> 01:00:12,538
How much longer will it take for your dad to finally come around?

861
01:00:14,278 --> 01:00:16,048
Are you really still holding out hope for that?

862
01:00:17,908 --> 01:00:19,578
Time heals all wounds.

863
01:00:21,218 --> 01:00:22,218
No.

864
01:00:22,918 --> 01:00:23,988
Don't get your hopes up.

865
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:27,418
You already made your choice, Mom.

866
01:00:27,818 --> 01:00:30,088
Between living as the person you were 30 years ago...

867
01:00:31,058 --> 01:00:34,758
and living as the legal wife of Shoe Joy's chairman in name only.

868
01:00:36,198 --> 01:00:37,568
You made your choice.

869
01:00:39,798 --> 01:00:42,268
Then why do you still dream of actually being Dad's wife?

870
01:00:43,538 --> 01:00:45,808
Chasing a hopeless dream will only break your own heart.

871
01:00:48,708 --> 01:00:50,248
You never know.

872
01:00:51,508 --> 01:00:52,718
That's not going to happen.

873
01:00:57,148 --> 01:00:58,148
I'm leaving.

874
01:01:07,898 --> 01:01:10,128
Goodness, that mean brat.

875
01:01:10,828 --> 01:01:14,998
She's so successful and rich, but never gives her mom one cent.

876
01:01:17,968 --> 01:01:19,908
Let's see...

877
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:30,218
Once I save up 500 dollars,

878
01:01:30,718 --> 01:01:33,358
I should exchange it for 50-dollar bills.

879
01:01:47,568 --> 01:01:48,798
The ocean's nice, right?

880
01:01:51,968 --> 01:01:54,638
Dad, I'm here.

881
01:01:55,578 --> 01:01:57,648
It's such a clear day.

882
01:01:58,748 --> 01:02:00,118
The moment you leave Seoul,

883
01:02:01,018 --> 01:02:02,488
the air feels so much nicer.

884
01:02:04,788 --> 01:02:06,658
The whole family got together yesterday.

885
01:02:07,558 --> 01:02:09,028
Everyone's doing well.

886
01:02:10,028 --> 01:02:12,658
Dad, is this what it's all about?

887
01:02:13,658 --> 01:02:18,598
Life's not always good, and not always bad.

888
01:02:19,298 --> 01:02:22,068
And even when things are tough, you find moments of true happiness.

889
01:02:23,768 --> 01:02:24,938
It's all so simple, really.

890
01:02:26,538 --> 01:02:27,778
But even so,

891
01:02:28,608 --> 01:02:30,008
why do I love it so much?

892
01:02:32,548 --> 01:02:33,848
Dad, I'm sorry.

893
01:02:35,378 --> 01:02:38,118
With Eun Oh, I would've been happy even living in a small room.

894
01:02:39,388 --> 01:02:41,118
I'm sorry I never got to show you that.

895
01:02:42,928 --> 01:02:44,028
I'm really sorry.

896
01:02:46,728 --> 01:02:47,858
My father.

897
01:02:48,398 --> 01:02:52,068
Other people get to live until they're 80 or 90,

898
01:02:52,868 --> 01:02:53,868
but you only got...

899
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:58,568
You only had 63 years.

900
01:03:01,938 --> 01:03:02,948
Father.

901
01:03:03,478 --> 01:03:05,608
Dad, when you gave your life for me,

902
01:03:06,018 --> 01:03:07,278
didn't you feel it was unfair?

903
01:03:08,118 --> 01:03:09,288
How could you not?

904
01:03:10,018 --> 01:03:13,458
The cuffs on your pants were all frayed.

905
01:03:13,858 --> 01:03:15,728
The heels of your shoes were worn down, too.

906
01:03:16,558 --> 01:03:18,928
And you'd been using the same wallet since I was in grade school.

907
01:03:19,628 --> 01:03:21,728
I never even got to treat you to a nice meal.

908
01:03:22,328 --> 01:03:25,098
You never had a real vacation, either.

909
01:03:27,238 --> 01:03:28,298
Now,

910
01:03:29,268 --> 01:03:30,638
I can do all of that for you.

911
01:03:32,008 --> 01:03:33,108
But Father...

912
01:03:34,478 --> 01:03:36,148
Do you know what a terrible son I am?

913
01:03:37,108 --> 01:03:38,378
I was glad to be alive.

914
01:03:39,078 --> 01:03:40,348
I found that I loved living.

915
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:44,318
Just looking at Eun Oh made me cry with happiness.

916
01:03:45,188 --> 01:03:47,088
And I've eaten so much expensive,

917
01:03:47,488 --> 01:03:48,618
delicious food.

918
01:03:49,928 --> 01:03:51,628
I mean, what kind of son am I?

919
01:03:52,288 --> 01:03:53,558
What kind of person does that?

920
01:03:55,058 --> 01:03:56,268
Father.

921
01:03:57,668 --> 01:03:58,668
Dad.

922
01:04:00,068 --> 01:04:01,438
For bringing me into this world,

923
01:04:02,638 --> 01:04:03,668
thank you.

924
01:04:04,808 --> 01:04:06,438
And for saving my life,

925
01:04:07,208 --> 01:04:08,308
thank you.

926
01:04:09,978 --> 01:04:12,418
For giving me the chance to be a father,

927
01:04:13,278 --> 01:04:15,448
for giving me my life twice...

928
01:04:16,648 --> 01:04:17,918
Thank you, Dad!

929
01:04:21,788 --> 01:04:22,988
Thank you, Dad.

930
01:05:08,098 --> 01:05:11,068
- I'm glad we could work together. - My gosh...

931
01:05:12,238 --> 01:05:16,078
(Thank you for watching Our Golden Days.)
