00:00:01,023 --> 00:00:02,033
Hello.

2
00:00:02,033 --> 00:00:03,293
(Samun TV)

3
00:00:03,293 --> 00:00:05,763
My name is Ko Seong Hui.

4
00:00:06,403 --> 00:00:09,233
I am the wife of Chairman Park Jin Seok...

5
00:00:09,973 --> 00:00:11,103
of the Shoe Joy Group.

6
00:00:20,383 --> 00:00:23,413
She entered Unit 709 in the Sky Castle complex.

7
00:00:24,453 --> 00:00:25,553
Why would she go in there?

8
00:00:32,393 --> 00:00:35,163
- Yes, Chairman. - Mr. Park, what is this?

9
00:00:36,493 --> 00:00:38,803
Is this it? Just a photo of the door to 709?

10
00:00:39,363 --> 00:00:41,733
She made no attempt to avoid us.

11
00:00:42,003 --> 00:00:44,103
She even asked us to go up in the elevator with her,

12
00:00:44,173 --> 00:00:46,043
so I couldn't bring myself to take a picture of her going in.

13
00:00:47,243 --> 00:00:48,513
She asked you to go up with her?

14
00:00:52,413 --> 00:00:55,583
I never gave you permission to put a lien on my properties,

15
00:00:56,313 --> 00:00:58,653
and I never authorized you to use my official seal.

16
00:00:59,953 --> 00:01:00,953
And...

17
00:01:02,993 --> 00:01:04,093
I'm sorry...

18
00:01:04,893 --> 00:01:06,023
that it's come to this.

19
00:01:14,203 --> 00:01:15,333
To all subscribers,

20
00:01:16,703 --> 00:01:18,103
thank you for hearing me out.

21
00:01:18,173 --> 00:01:20,073
(Samun TV)

22
00:01:20,143 --> 00:01:21,713
Once this video is released,

23
00:01:22,443 --> 00:01:24,273
I don't know what will happen to me.

24
00:01:26,613 --> 00:01:27,683
I hope all of you...

25
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:30,653
will continue to follow my story.

26
00:01:42,163 --> 00:01:44,193
(Samun TV)

27
00:01:45,103 --> 00:01:46,233
All done?

28
00:01:49,803 --> 00:01:51,673
You spoke very well.

29
00:01:55,243 --> 00:01:57,043
Please upload this tomorrow at 10am.

30
00:01:57,543 --> 00:01:59,243
Yes, at 10am sharp.

31
00:02:00,313 --> 00:02:01,413
Tonight,

32
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:03,813
I'd like to get a good night's sleep.

33
00:02:13,393 --> 00:02:16,633
It's Ji Eun Oh, isn't it? Your long-time crush.

34
00:02:18,303 --> 00:02:19,363
You girls...

35
00:02:20,103 --> 00:02:21,403
How are you always so quick to catch on?

36
00:02:23,903 --> 00:02:25,443
You'll never get over her...

37
00:02:25,803 --> 00:02:27,543
if you keep running into her like this.

38
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:33,743
What is it you want me to say?

39
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:36,313
You could fall for her again at any moment.

40
00:02:36,683 --> 00:02:37,983
Must be nice for you.

41
00:02:41,383 --> 00:02:42,793
She's the girl Ji Hyuk likes.

42
00:02:44,963 --> 00:02:45,963
What?

43
00:02:46,563 --> 00:02:47,693
And Eun Oh...

44
00:02:48,563 --> 00:02:49,793
likes Ji Hyuk, too.

45
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:53,633
- Really? - But...

46
00:02:54,103 --> 00:02:56,203
since Ji Hyuk's not feeling well right now,

47
00:02:57,203 --> 00:02:58,643
he's avoiding her,

48
00:02:59,673 --> 00:03:01,073
and Eun Oh is chasing after him.

49
00:03:04,673 --> 00:03:06,013
Poor Ji Hyuk.

50
00:03:09,213 --> 00:03:11,453
He's avoiding the very woman he likes.

51
00:03:17,293 --> 00:03:18,763
Seeing how it's taking a while,

52
00:03:19,993 --> 00:03:22,763
it must be hard for Ji Hyuk and unbearable for Eun Oh.

53
00:03:24,593 --> 00:03:26,063
Come on. I'll take you home.

54
00:03:26,933 --> 00:03:28,503
I was supposed to go with Ji Hyuk.

55
00:03:29,673 --> 00:03:31,473
Ji Hyuk texted me on his way out.

56
00:03:32,173 --> 00:03:33,873
He said he was running away from Eun Oh.

57
00:03:34,703 --> 00:03:36,273
He asked me to make sure you get home safe.

58
00:03:37,743 --> 00:03:40,813
If he was leaving early anyway, why did he come?

59
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:42,183
He could've just stayed home.

60
00:03:43,253 --> 00:03:44,653
He came because he missed her, silly.

61
00:03:45,953 --> 00:03:47,683
He's all business at the office,

62
00:03:48,253 --> 00:03:50,453
so he doesn't give Eun Oh an inch.

63
00:03:51,553 --> 00:03:54,423
You think he's fine with that? You think he doesn't miss her?

64
00:03:55,763 --> 00:03:57,033
Using Gang Oh's invitation as an excuse,

65
00:03:58,133 --> 00:03:59,733
he just came to see her for an hour or two.

66
00:04:04,103 --> 00:04:06,943
But if you were coming, why did Ji Hyuk bring me along?

67
00:04:11,313 --> 00:04:13,943
I was against you two, but I give up.

68
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:16,883
Now that I'm in this position myself,

69
00:04:17,253 --> 00:04:18,753
I've realized your own happiness is what's most important.

70
00:04:19,883 --> 00:04:23,493
How wonderful is it to have someone you're desperate to be with?

71
00:04:24,053 --> 00:04:25,263
Just think about yourselves.

72
00:04:27,563 --> 00:04:29,433
I guess he wanted to treat you to a nice meal.

73
00:04:30,193 --> 00:04:31,463
Because he trusts us.

74
00:04:34,133 --> 00:04:36,203
Because he believes we've completely broken up?

75
00:04:40,373 --> 00:04:41,843
Because we have completely broken up.

76
00:04:44,613 --> 00:04:45,613
Right.

77
00:04:46,683 --> 00:04:48,453
There can't be an "us" anymore.

78
00:05:04,163 --> 00:05:05,403
I'll just take the bus.

79
00:05:06,233 --> 00:05:07,233
No.

80
00:05:07,763 --> 00:05:09,403
I promised Ji Hyuk...

81
00:05:10,273 --> 00:05:11,703
I'd make sure you get home safely.

82
00:05:13,273 --> 00:05:14,443
He's drawing a line.

83
00:05:14,943 --> 00:05:18,143
I hate that he's taking me home just because my brother asked.

84
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:39,303
I have my own pockets, you know.

85
00:05:39,963 --> 00:05:41,773
Mine is warmer.

86
00:05:43,733 --> 00:05:45,443
But then, your hand will get cold.

87
00:05:50,373 --> 00:05:52,783
Just until the taxi gets here. It's cold.

88
00:05:56,753 --> 00:05:57,753
Okay.

89
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:05,293
It's amazing how people can love each other enough to marry.

90
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:11,193
I feel so bad for Eun Oh and my brother.

91
00:06:25,783 --> 00:06:29,113
(Gang Oh)

92
00:06:32,883 --> 00:06:33,883
Eun Oh.

93
00:06:36,223 --> 00:06:37,293
Look, what I have...

94
00:06:39,093 --> 00:06:40,763
isn't kidney failure.

95
00:06:43,493 --> 00:06:45,133
I'm a patient...

96
00:06:46,603 --> 00:06:47,633
who needs a heart transplant.

97
00:06:51,303 --> 00:06:52,343
So, Eun Oh.

98
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:55,473
Please...

99
00:06:58,813 --> 00:06:59,813
let me go.

100
00:07:02,153 --> 00:07:03,183
I'm begging you.

101
00:07:07,323 --> 00:07:08,693
For the time I have left,

102
00:07:10,723 --> 00:07:11,753
at least as friends,

103
00:07:14,063 --> 00:07:15,993
can't you let me see you in peace?

104
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:20,333
If you did that,

105
00:07:21,633 --> 00:07:23,003
I would be so grateful.

106
00:07:26,443 --> 00:07:27,943
How could this have happened?

107
00:07:28,443 --> 00:07:29,443
Ji Hyuk...

108
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:33,483
Please, just tell me...

109
00:07:38,413 --> 00:07:39,923
I can't talk about that right now.

110
00:07:43,493 --> 00:07:44,493
Ji Eun Oh.

111
00:07:49,133 --> 00:07:50,263
You're being cruel.

112
00:07:53,033 --> 00:07:54,033
You're forcing me...

113
00:07:56,573 --> 00:07:57,573
Fine.

114
00:09:02,733 --> 00:09:03,733
Eun Oh.

115
00:09:05,973 --> 00:09:06,973
Just leave me...

116
00:09:10,613 --> 00:09:11,673
alone.

117
00:09:26,323 --> 00:09:27,323
Please.

118
00:09:35,903 --> 00:09:36,903
I'm sorry.

119
00:10:30,823 --> 00:10:31,823
Just now...

120
00:10:33,193 --> 00:10:36,863
Did you say you need a heart transplant?

121
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:49,543
What's happening to me?

122
00:11:09,163 --> 00:11:13,333
What's going on? You didn't answer calls or texts.

123
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:18,103
Did you close up the shop and come home because of me?

124
00:11:18,603 --> 00:11:21,473
Listen to this one. She has no idea what time it is.

125
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:24,243
We just closed the restaurant and got home.

126
00:11:24,843 --> 00:11:28,383
Have you been with that CEO guy this whole time?

127
00:11:31,253 --> 00:11:33,253
No, that's not it.

128
00:11:33,953 --> 00:11:34,953
Eun Oh.

129
00:11:36,193 --> 00:11:37,353
Have you been crying?

130
00:11:41,163 --> 00:11:43,593
Mom, I'm going to head in.

131
00:11:47,363 --> 00:11:49,073
Hey, come here. Come on.

132
00:11:50,803 --> 00:11:53,603
What's wrong? What? What happened?

133
00:11:54,743 --> 00:11:57,913
Why did you run after his car like that?

134
00:11:58,673 --> 00:12:01,483
I could tell something was off back at the restaurant.

135
00:12:02,653 --> 00:12:05,553
Did that CEO have a change of heart?

136
00:12:05,853 --> 00:12:10,393
No, that can't be right. He was so devoted to you.

137
00:12:13,223 --> 00:12:15,593
Mom, can you just hold me?

138
00:12:16,563 --> 00:12:17,563
What?

139
00:12:18,093 --> 00:12:19,103
My gosh...

140
00:12:19,663 --> 00:12:22,203
What's gotten into you now?

141
00:12:26,873 --> 00:12:27,873
Mom.

142
00:12:28,973 --> 00:12:32,543
Ji Hyuk... He might be dying.

143
00:12:34,143 --> 00:12:35,983
He's dying.

144
00:12:37,413 --> 00:12:40,923
That's why he said I'm a burden to him.

145
00:12:42,353 --> 00:12:43,353
Oh, my...

146
00:12:46,023 --> 00:12:48,563
What are you talking about? Oh, sweetie.

147
00:12:50,063 --> 00:12:52,063
I'm so scared.

148
00:12:55,103 --> 00:12:58,173
Okay, first... Just calm down, Eun Oh.

149
00:12:58,233 --> 00:13:01,773
Eun Oh. My gosh, you're shaking so much.

150
00:13:02,313 --> 00:13:03,313
Calm down.

151
00:13:03,943 --> 00:13:05,413
Let's just calm down, okay?

152
00:13:06,483 --> 00:13:07,613
Calm down.

153
00:13:09,113 --> 00:13:10,513
Oh, dear.

154
00:13:36,213 --> 00:13:38,743
Goodbye, Park Jin Seok.

155
00:13:55,193 --> 00:13:56,333
It's over.

156
00:14:15,013 --> 00:14:16,853
Did she go to a friend's place for the night?

157
00:14:19,453 --> 00:14:21,583
But wait, she doesn't have any friends like that.

158
00:14:24,193 --> 00:14:25,193
No, that can't be it.

159
00:14:26,893 --> 00:14:29,133
I'm sure there's plenty I don't know about her.

160
00:14:54,753 --> 00:14:57,723
You're still coming in early, Ms. Ji Eun Oh.

161
00:15:01,793 --> 00:15:02,793
Yes.

162
00:15:03,133 --> 00:15:05,733
I find I concentrate better in the morning.

163
00:15:06,933 --> 00:15:09,673
The 2nd draft for Living Life 30. I need it by today.

164
00:15:12,743 --> 00:15:13,903
Yes, understood.

165
00:15:15,243 --> 00:15:17,743
Good. It feels like a real office now.

166
00:15:26,453 --> 00:15:29,393
Is this really what you wanted?

167
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,873
I actually slept through the night.

168
00:15:52,443 --> 00:15:55,313
Since there's no way I can resolve this on my own,

169
00:15:55,853 --> 00:15:58,213
I've come here to ask for your help.

170
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:05,923
Twenty-six years ago, I remarried Park Jin Seok of the Shoe Joy Group.

171
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:09,993
I brought my four-year-old son with me into the marriage.

172
00:16:11,563 --> 00:16:13,033
Chairman Park Jin Seok, on the other hand,

173
00:16:13,503 --> 00:16:15,903
already had a seven-year-old son of his own,

174
00:16:16,773 --> 00:16:20,003
and together, we had a daughter.

175
00:16:20,703 --> 00:16:23,513
We lived a happy life for 26 years.

176
00:16:25,013 --> 00:16:26,943
He has some trauma from his past,

177
00:16:27,413 --> 00:16:30,283
and I knew he hated being deceived more than anything.

178
00:16:31,453 --> 00:16:32,983
But my husband, disappointed in me,

179
00:16:33,453 --> 00:16:35,253
concluded that I had been deceiving him...

180
00:16:35,793 --> 00:16:37,193
for our entire 26 years together.

181
00:16:38,293 --> 00:16:39,323
And then, one day,

182
00:16:40,423 --> 00:16:43,533
out of the blue, he told me to get out of the house.

183
00:16:44,363 --> 00:16:46,033
When I tried to talk things over,

184
00:16:46,633 --> 00:16:49,573
he dragged me barefoot out the front gate and threw me out.

185
00:16:51,533 --> 00:16:54,173
I had no idea any of this was coming.

186
00:16:55,173 --> 00:16:56,413
But Chairman Park Jin Seok...

187
00:16:57,013 --> 00:17:01,343
had already placed liens on all of my real estate.

188
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:03,353
He'd hidden everything I owned, including...

189
00:17:03,683 --> 00:17:06,853
all my jewelry, cash, and foreign currency.

190
00:17:07,853 --> 00:17:10,723
He even took my credit cards...

191
00:17:11,453 --> 00:17:14,863
and cleaned out my bank accounts.

192
00:17:16,233 --> 00:17:19,233
He left me with only 2,000 dollars on my debit card...

193
00:17:20,633 --> 00:17:21,963
and kicked me to the curb.

194
00:17:24,903 --> 00:17:26,603
At first, I just thought...

195
00:17:26,903 --> 00:17:29,843
- Is this for real? Is it AI? - This is insane. Shoe Joy is toast.

196
00:17:29,913 --> 00:17:31,213
He kicked her out with just 2,000 dollars?

197
00:17:31,273 --> 00:17:33,783
"Deceived for 26 years?" As if. Ma'am, you need police protection.

198
00:17:33,843 --> 00:17:35,243
See? The super-rich are always so messed up.

199
00:17:35,313 --> 00:17:37,183
Being dragged out barefoot is chilling.

200
00:17:37,253 --> 00:17:39,753
After 26 years together? How could he do something like that?

201
00:17:39,823 --> 00:17:43,823
Even if she lied, it's still abuse. The liens, hiding all her assets...

202
00:17:43,893 --> 00:17:46,463
- That's grounds for prison. - Shoe Joy Group's image is ruined.

203
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:49,263
The liens are the final nail in the coffin. Poor woman.

204
00:17:50,993 --> 00:17:52,703
- That's right. - He refuses to grant me a divorce.

205
00:17:53,533 --> 00:17:55,003
I'm the victim here.

206
00:17:56,073 --> 00:17:58,473
My husband of 26 years, and the father of our daughter...

207
00:17:59,103 --> 00:18:03,443
I did everything I could to keep him from being publicly shamed.

208
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,743
Hello?

(Vice President Park Seong Jae)

210
00:18:11,183 --> 00:18:13,123
What's this about a weird interview circulating on YouTube?

211
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,093
And then, one day,

212
00:18:17,323 --> 00:18:20,293
out of the blue, he told me to get out of the house.

213

When I tried to talk things over,

215
00:18:24,463 --> 00:18:27,563
he dragged me barefoot out the front gate and threw me out.

216
00:18:32,943 --> 00:18:33,943
Honey.

217
00:18:34,373 --> 00:18:38,373
If you don't really intend to leave me homeless on the street,

218
00:18:39,143 --> 00:18:40,443
then either grant me a divorce...

219
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:44,713
or at least give me back my assets.

220
00:18:45,713 --> 00:18:48,923
I never gave you permission to put a lien on my properties,

221
00:18:49,823 --> 00:18:52,393
and I never authorized you to use my official seal.

222
00:18:55,063 --> 00:18:56,093
And...

223
00:18:57,193 --> 00:18:58,193
I'm sorry...

224
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:00,433
that it's come to this.

225
00:19:05,703 --> 00:19:07,043
I didn't see this coming.

226
00:19:08,073 --> 00:19:09,313
I never would have expected this.

227
00:19:14,983 --> 00:19:15,983
Father.

228
00:19:16,783 --> 00:19:20,123
Did you illegally put liens on her properties?

229
00:19:21,323 --> 00:19:23,123
Why would you do something so reckless?

230
00:19:27,693 --> 00:19:31,193
Sir, the phones are ringing with calls from the media.

231
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,933
And our stock price has plummeted by nine percent.

232
00:19:37,303 --> 00:19:38,303
Get the legal team in here.

233
00:19:39,473 --> 00:19:42,543
And do what? There's no way out of this, Father!

234
00:19:43,373 --> 00:19:45,443
The truth will come out the second she files to cancel.

235
00:19:45,513 --> 00:19:47,643
Why make such a predictable move? It's not like you.

236
00:19:49,953 --> 00:19:53,323
Does she seem like the type to just let you take her assets?

237
00:19:54,183 --> 00:19:55,683
Especially when this all started over money?

238
00:19:56,723 --> 00:19:58,923
What did you think would happen if you took everything from her?

239
00:20:00,623 --> 00:20:01,693
I didn't take anything.

240
00:20:03,293 --> 00:20:04,333
What?

241
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:05,363
Hey, I'm back.

243
00:20:10,573 --> 00:20:12,943
How did you get out of there?

244
00:20:14,143 --> 00:20:15,143
Why?

245
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:18,243
Your family's in huge trouble.

(The Wife's Shocking Confession!)

247
00:20:19,983 --> 00:20:22,953
My son was always an outsider in the Park family.

248
00:20:23,883 --> 00:20:26,923
He was dying, after a miserable life on eggshells.

249
00:20:30,323 --> 00:20:32,353
But I couldn't bring myself to tell my husband.

250
00:20:33,893 --> 00:20:35,563
I was afraid I'd be a bother.

251
00:20:36,593 --> 00:20:38,533
How could my mom do this?

252
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,233
How could she go public with this?

254
00:20:49,573 --> 00:20:50,573
She attacked the company...

255

and our family.

256
00:20:56,053 --> 00:20:59,623
So she doesn't care what happens to Dad, my brother, or me?

257
00:21:01,723 --> 00:21:03,623
That's ruthless.

258
00:21:05,593 --> 00:21:08,523
But why would the Chairman go to such extremes?

259
00:21:10,863 --> 00:21:12,563
Because to my mom, money is everything.

260
00:21:13,933 --> 00:21:16,203
He must've wanted to punish her by hitting her where it hurts.

261
00:21:18,573 --> 00:21:22,943

Fine. Don't call if you don't want to.

The Park Jin Seok who holds the liens in question...

297
00:23:53,863 --> 00:23:57,193
was, in fact, a different person with the same name as the chairman.

298

To be honest, I'm not sure myself.

309

The truth is, my wife ran away a little while ago,

310

That woman's crazy. She probably faked the whole thing.

Yes, a classmate from middle school had my exact same name.

You got him to do your dirty work, didn't you?

357
00:27:42,353 --> 00:27:44,223
I have no idea what you're talking about.

358
00:27:44,393 --> 00:27:47,523
If you keep spouting this nonsense, things will get ugly for you.

359
00:27:48,493 --> 00:27:50,663
After that whole YouTube debacle, you're still talking nonsense?

360
00:27:54,063 --> 00:27:56,733
You took out mortgages on them in your name.

361
00:27:57,233 --> 00:27:59,173
Park Jin Seok. In your name.

362
00:27:59,333 --> 00:28:01,573
Is that so? How odd.

363
00:28:02,073 --> 00:28:04,943
If this goes to a divorce lawsuit with those mortgages,

364
00:28:05,013 --> 00:28:07,613
you'll be completely humiliated and forced to divorce me anyway.

365
00:28:08,243 --> 00:28:09,953
And those mortgages will be nullified.

366
00:28:11,983 --> 00:28:14,153
What is this nonsense you keep spouting?

367
00:28:19,393 --> 00:28:20,693
Listen carefully.

368
00:28:21,863 --> 00:28:24,993
If a word of this gets out, you're dead.

369
00:28:25,993 --> 00:28:28,333
If I hear you've been running your mouth,

370
00:28:29,363 --> 00:28:31,173
you'll disappear without a trace.

371
00:28:33,073 --> 00:28:36,513
So don't go running to any law firms and letting things slip.

372
00:28:39,813 --> 00:28:42,943
So that's why you acted like that the day I came to ask for a divorce.

373
00:28:44,383 --> 00:28:48,183
You denied setting up the mortgage, and purposely changed the subject,

374
00:28:48,253 --> 00:28:50,123
and you gave me the recording without deleting it.

375
00:28:50,753 --> 00:28:54,423
So that if I used it as evidence, I'd look like the crazy one. Right?

376
00:28:55,293 --> 00:28:56,323
Ko Seong Hui.

377
00:28:57,433 --> 00:29:00,763
If people see you, they might have you committed.

378
00:29:01,203 --> 00:29:03,403
Viewers might even send in tips about you.

379
00:29:04,303 --> 00:29:05,573
So you'd better lay low.

380
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:11,043
Hey, Park Jin Seok!

381
00:29:16,413 --> 00:29:20,053
You fool. You crazy fool!

382
00:29:21,153 --> 00:29:23,293
You've tightened the noose around your own neck.

383
00:29:27,123 --> 00:29:31,663
- What? - Ma'am, your rent was due today.

384
00:29:31,793 --> 00:29:33,863
Oh, the thing is...

385
00:29:34,733 --> 00:29:39,273
Someone wired the rent for Room 201. You can stay through tomorrow.

386
00:29:47,683 --> 00:29:49,013
Park Jin Seok.

387
00:29:51,483 --> 00:29:54,453
I just saw his name and completely lost it...

388
00:29:56,693 --> 00:29:58,423
I just completely lost my head.

389
00:30:11,533 --> 00:30:13,273
What am I going to do now?

390
00:30:14,843 --> 00:30:16,543
What am I going to do?

391
00:30:24,083 --> 00:30:25,983
(Shoealls)

392
00:30:37,893 --> 00:30:38,893
Dad, it's me.

393
00:30:39,663 --> 00:30:40,663
Yes.

394
00:30:41,533 --> 00:30:43,063
The video has been deleted,

395
00:30:43,603 --> 00:30:45,633
and the YouTube channel posted an apology video.

396
00:30:46,373 --> 00:30:48,273
The stock's decline slowed to six percent,

397
00:30:48,273 --> 00:30:50,373
and public opinion is stabilizing.

398
00:30:51,813 --> 00:30:53,143
Good enough.

399
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:55,213
Park Jin Seok.

400
00:30:56,343 --> 00:30:58,683
You found another Park Jin Seok, didn't you?

401
00:30:59,253 --> 00:31:00,323
Who knows?

402
00:31:02,953 --> 00:31:04,453
But you're the one who found him, Dad.

403
00:31:05,553 --> 00:31:07,293
It's time you told me the full story.

404
00:31:08,063 --> 00:31:11,433
This might not be over. I must know what I'm dealing with.

405
00:31:16,103 --> 00:31:17,673
Do you really not trust me that much?

406
00:31:18,703 --> 00:31:20,603
Why won't you tell me the whole story?

407
00:31:20,973 --> 00:31:24,073
- How dare you speak to me that way? - What will you do about her?

408
00:31:26,783 --> 00:31:28,843
She's going to learn to survive on her own out there.

409
00:31:31,313 --> 00:31:33,423
When you say she'll "live on her own,"

410
00:31:34,583 --> 00:31:36,823
do you mean taking every last cent she has...

411
00:31:37,493 --> 00:31:39,453
and throwing her out on the street? Is that the plan?

412
00:31:40,693 --> 00:31:42,923
Have you forgotten that she's Yeong Ra's mother?

413
00:31:43,393 --> 00:31:46,463
You don't understand. Stay out of it.

414
00:31:46,833 --> 00:31:47,833
No.

415
00:31:48,633 --> 00:31:50,673
Dad, you're a lot like her, you know.

416
00:31:52,903 --> 00:31:54,903
What do you even know, you punk?

417
00:31:56,443 --> 00:31:57,443
Get out.

418
00:31:57,843 --> 00:32:00,943
She's Yeong Ra's mom, and you are her father.

419
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:11,893
As if I don't know that.

420
00:32:19,833 --> 00:32:22,633
Sorry, I couldn't answer. I was busy cleaning up this mess.

421
00:32:23,573 --> 00:32:24,803
I saw the clarification on the news.

422
00:32:25,803 --> 00:32:26,843
But...

423
00:32:27,803 --> 00:32:29,243
about the mortgage with his namesake...

424
00:32:30,213 --> 00:32:31,713
Dad was behind that too, right?

425
00:32:33,313 --> 00:32:35,613
No. Dad had nothing to do with it.

426
00:32:38,783 --> 00:32:39,883
That's a relief.

427
00:32:42,753 --> 00:32:43,923
Okay.

428
00:32:44,193 --> 00:32:45,553
All right, bye.

429
00:32:54,103 --> 00:32:57,733
If it wasn't a match, I wasn't going to tell her I was her mother.

430
00:32:57,803 --> 00:33:00,803
I thought the right thing to do was disappear.

431
00:33:01,943 --> 00:33:03,373
But then, like a miracle,

432
00:33:04,073 --> 00:33:07,413
- the two of them... - Yes?

433
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:11,613
Mr. Lee.

434
00:33:11,883 --> 00:33:12,883
Let me come in for a moment.

435
00:33:16,483 --> 00:33:18,153
You saw that woman's interview, right?

436
00:33:21,023 --> 00:33:22,023
Yes.

437
00:33:23,193 --> 00:33:27,403
Seong Jae and his father have assigned your family security.

438
00:33:27,633 --> 00:33:28,663
Don't worry.

439
00:33:30,273 --> 00:33:31,973
I didn't know that.

440
00:33:33,103 --> 00:33:35,573
I'm just letting you know so you won't worry.

441

I'm heading home early so you won't feel awkward, Ji Hyuk.

This is what you want, right?

446

You don't want to see me around, right?

447
00:34:13,073 --> 00:34:14,243
But you...

448
00:34:15,283 --> 00:34:17,983

00:34:54,223 --> 00:34:56,893
Normally, she would've brought a hard copy.

I hope all of you...

455
00:35:16,073 --> 00:35:17,713
will continue to follow my story.

- My goodness. - How can someone be so evil?

457
00:35:22,783 --> 00:35:26,683
I knew she was a frightening woman, but I had no idea she was this evil.

458
00:35:26,853 --> 00:35:31,753
I'm glad it's all resolved, but his family must be in shambles.

459
00:35:31,923 --> 00:35:34,193
- I'm home. - Hey.

460
00:35:37,693 --> 00:35:40,093
Dad, were you watching that?

461
00:35:40,703 --> 00:35:44,603
Ji Hyuk, did you know all along about Seong Jae's family?

462
00:35:46,673 --> 00:35:50,213
- Yes. - Then the daughter she abandoned...

463
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:54,243
is an employee at your company? That's what Yeong Ra said.

464
00:35:54,313 --> 00:35:57,283
- Her name's Ji Eun Oh. - Ji Eun Oh?

465
00:35:58,313 --> 00:36:01,983
Wait, the Eun Oh who was the donor for the liver transplant?

466
00:36:02,083 --> 00:36:05,223
So, wait. You're saying Seong Jae's stepmom...

467
00:36:05,523 --> 00:36:06,693
is Eun Oh's birth mother?

468
00:36:07,693 --> 00:36:09,423
Wait, Dad, how did you...

469
00:36:11,633 --> 00:36:13,093
Did Eun Oh tell you?

470
00:36:13,433 --> 00:36:16,733
Yes, on the day the three of us ran into each other.

471
00:36:19,733 --> 00:36:20,873
What's everyone gathered here for?

472
00:36:21,503 --> 00:36:24,043
Can you believe the woman who abandoned that girl, Eun Oh,

473
00:36:24,113 --> 00:36:27,113
is Seong Jae's stepmom? It's just unbelievable.

474
00:36:28,783 --> 00:36:32,813
What do you mean? Seong Jae's stepmom left Eun Oh?

475
00:36:35,423 --> 00:36:38,953
Hold on. Let's hear the whole story from start to finish, okay?

476

My goodness.

477
00:36:45,533 --> 00:36:48,333
So Seong Jae had to call her Mom all this time?

478
00:36:52,373 --> 00:36:53,773
She's a monster disguised as a human.

479
00:36:53,773 --> 00:36:55,273
She's not human at all.

480
00:36:56,443 --> 00:36:58,043
She's a true demon.

481
00:36:59,213 --> 00:37:01,913
So that's why Seong Jae grew so attached to our family.

482
00:37:03,513 --> 00:37:07,153
Seong Jae found out the truth first, so he's been going through a lot.

Seong Jae... You grew up with an awful person.

Seong Jae found out the truth first, so he's been going through a lot.

489
00:37:35,113 --> 00:37:37,653
There's an emptiness to him, a certain sadness.

490
00:37:38,353 --> 00:37:42,883
How could Ji Hye abandon her own son for another man?

491
00:37:44,493 --> 00:37:46,623
He was abandoned by his own mother,

492
00:37:47,763 --> 00:37:49,923
and then he ended up with a stepmom like her.

493
00:37:51,063 --> 00:37:53,663
And on top of all that, he knows about Ji Hyuk's illness.

494
00:37:58,233 --> 00:38:01,673
He takes care of our family. He comforts me.

But still, your grandmother...

498
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:12,183
must have been very happy because of you.

You know what they say?

If you cry too much,

501
00:38:24,293 --> 00:38:25,893
they say the person who passed can't move on.

502
00:38:28,633 --> 00:38:30,903
But who is there to comfort you?

503
00:38:32,003 --> 00:38:33,903

507
00:38:55,693 --> 00:38:58,363
I can't believe he used a namesake to take out a mortgage.

508
00:38:59,133 --> 00:39:01,563
He had this meticulously planned out from the very beginning.

Didn't you see that part?

519
00:40:20,813 --> 00:40:21,913
I saw that part, too.

520
00:40:24,353 --> 00:40:26,513
Then why are you here?

521
00:40:28,553 --> 00:40:30,023
I couldn't just stay away.

522
00:40:31,653 --> 00:40:33,253
Because I knew you'd be all alone.

You can't vent to my older brother since he's sick,

524
00:40:38,493 --> 00:40:40,393
so I figured you were just enduring it all by yourself.

00:41:01,653 --> 00:41:02,853
It's all over now.

531
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:05,253
No, I mean all this time.

532
00:41:06,423 --> 00:41:08,563
Ever since your mom left, up until now.

533
00:41:09,193 --> 00:41:10,633
How hard must it have been for you?

534
00:41:11,263 --> 00:41:12,793
How lonely must you have been?

535
00:41:15,863 --> 00:41:17,903
You could have vented to me when we saw each other.

536
00:41:19,833 --> 00:41:21,803
You should've told me how lonely you were...

537
00:41:21,803 --> 00:41:23,073
because of that awful stepmom.

538
00:41:26,613 --> 00:41:27,613
That's all in the past.

539
00:41:28,043 --> 00:41:29,783
If I'd known who she really was,

540
00:41:29,783 --> 00:41:31,583
I wouldn't have held back when she came to see me.

541
00:41:33,113 --> 00:41:34,123
She came to see you?

542
00:41:35,553 --> 00:41:36,553
That woman...

543
00:41:37,323 --> 00:41:38,593
came to see you?

544
00:41:39,693 --> 00:41:40,693
What?

545
00:41:41,293 --> 00:41:42,293
Did she?

546
00:41:44,163 --> 00:41:45,163
Yes.

547
00:41:46,663 --> 00:41:48,603
So that's why my dad called you in?

548
00:41:51,873 --> 00:41:53,973
Why wouldn't you tell me something like that?

549
00:41:54,273 --> 00:41:57,313
For the same reason you didn't tell me.

550
00:41:58,113 --> 00:41:59,843
I knew you'd be upset if I told you.

551
00:42:10,423 --> 00:42:11,723
It's all in the past now anyway.

552
00:42:12,923 --> 00:42:14,263
I appreciate you thinking of me.

553
00:42:14,963 --> 00:42:15,963
But...

554
00:42:17,123 --> 00:42:18,163
Don't do this again.

555
00:42:19,563 --> 00:42:20,863
And you won't have to.

556
00:42:25,003 --> 00:42:26,703
But you're struggling right now.

557
00:42:29,303 --> 00:42:30,443
I can handle it.

558
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,343
Still...

559
00:42:35,843 --> 00:42:37,753
I just wanted to give you a hug.

560
00:42:54,833 --> 00:42:55,833
Hey.

561
00:43:12,413 --> 00:43:13,653
Your hands are so cold.

562
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:19,153
All this time...

563
00:43:20,293 --> 00:43:21,723
You've been through so much.

564
00:43:24,233 --> 00:43:26,593
I don't know how you grew up with someone like that...

565
00:43:27,463 --> 00:43:29,363
and still turned out to be such a wonderful person.

566
00:43:31,873 --> 00:43:32,873
And...

567
00:43:35,873 --> 00:43:36,873
Thank you.

568
00:43:40,313 --> 00:43:44,183
For being there for my older brother.

569
00:43:44,783 --> 00:43:45,913
It means so much to me.

570
00:43:56,163 --> 00:43:58,963
You're going to meet someone amazing one day.

571
00:44:01,603 --> 00:44:02,903
I'll pray that you do.

572
00:44:06,533 --> 00:44:07,543
And...

573
00:44:10,973 --> 00:44:13,613
from now on, I'm your best friend's sister.

574
00:44:16,283 --> 00:44:18,613
If anything's bothering you, tell me all about it.

575
00:44:21,083 --> 00:44:22,553
I'll be here to listen.

576
00:44:33,593 --> 00:44:34,603
I should get going.

577
00:45:51,013 --> 00:45:53,943
- So, has Ji Wan gone downstairs? - Yes.

578
00:45:54,383 --> 00:45:56,543
He usually goes right to his room,

579
00:45:56,813 --> 00:45:59,683
but he stuck around to gossip about the big news today.

580
00:46:00,513 --> 00:46:01,523
What about Su Bin?

581
00:46:03,423 --> 00:46:04,653
She's not home yet.

582
00:46:07,523 --> 00:46:09,963
Hey, honey.

583
00:46:11,333 --> 00:46:13,093
About Su Bin and Seong Jae...

584
00:46:13,863 --> 00:46:15,633
What do you think about letting them date?

585
00:46:16,763 --> 00:46:17,773
You think so, too?

586
00:46:18,633 --> 00:46:20,303
I was thinking the exact same thing.

587
00:46:20,973 --> 00:46:24,843
I keep worrying about Seong Jae, and watching Su Bin hide her pain...

588
00:46:25,473 --> 00:46:27,073
is just unbearable.

589
00:46:28,043 --> 00:46:30,313
Well, you never know what the future holds,

590
00:46:31,453 --> 00:46:33,853
and their happiness is what's most important.

591
00:46:38,523 --> 00:46:40,623
- I'm home. - You're back.

592
00:46:41,023 --> 00:46:42,563
You were just with Seong Jae, weren't you?

593
00:46:43,123 --> 00:46:45,763
I'm sorry. I just went to comfort him.

594
00:46:46,593 --> 00:46:47,703
You did the right thing.

595
00:46:49,163 --> 00:46:50,163
I did?

596
00:46:51,333 --> 00:46:52,433
Why don't you just keep seeing him?

597
00:46:54,173 --> 00:46:55,243
Mom.

598
00:46:56,403 --> 00:46:58,513
I just can't stand to see you like this anymore.

599
00:47:00,313 --> 00:47:03,043
You think I'm fooled just because you're smiling on the outside?

600
00:47:04,013 --> 00:47:05,713
I'm your mother, for goodness' sake.

601
00:47:06,013 --> 00:47:09,223
I know if you're crying or laughing just from the back of your head.

602
00:47:10,623 --> 00:47:13,423
No, Mom. With you and Dad already so upset,

603
00:47:13,623 --> 00:47:14,963
you don't have to give me your blessing.

604
00:47:16,623 --> 00:47:18,433
Not with everything going on with Ji Hyuk.

605
00:47:19,393 --> 00:47:21,963
Today was just a slip-up.

606
00:47:24,503 --> 00:47:25,703
Date him while you have our blessing.

607
00:47:26,273 --> 00:47:27,873
It's just dating. We're telling you to give it a try.

608
00:47:30,673 --> 00:47:31,673
Thank you.

609
00:47:35,643 --> 00:47:36,643
Honestly.

610
00:47:36,943 --> 00:47:38,983
You can never win with your kids, can you?

611
00:47:42,183 --> 00:47:45,253
Ji Hyuk, what brings you down? Do you need something?

612
00:47:45,453 --> 00:47:47,823
I just had to use the bathroom.

613
00:47:48,523 --> 00:47:50,323
Didn't you just go a little while ago?

614
00:47:51,193 --> 00:47:52,663
Did you drink a lot of water today?

615
00:47:54,133 --> 00:47:57,433
I guess so. Mom, here, let me get that.

616
00:47:59,933 --> 00:48:02,643
People go more often in the winter. What's the big deal?

617
00:48:09,013 --> 00:48:13,183
I think we should have Ji Hyuk move into my mother's old room.

618
00:48:14,213 --> 00:48:15,223
Ji Hyuk?

619
00:48:16,123 --> 00:48:18,353
But Ji Wan is supposed to move into that room.

620
00:48:18,793 --> 00:48:21,893
We can just have Ji Wan move into Ji Hyuk's room upstairs.

621
00:48:22,523 --> 00:48:26,793
It was his room. He gave it up when my parents moved in.

622
00:48:27,463 --> 00:48:29,233
Honey, that was ages ago.

623
00:48:29,533 --> 00:48:30,603
He was a high school freshman, wasn't he?

624
00:48:30,973 --> 00:48:33,173
What difference does it make when it was?

625
00:48:34,003 --> 00:48:37,743
I still feel bad we made him leave the room he put so much work into.

626
00:48:38,413 --> 00:48:40,213
I'm sure that's what my mother would have wanted.

627
00:48:41,183 --> 00:48:44,853
Why move two people around? Ji Wan just needs to move upstairs.

628
00:48:44,913 --> 00:48:47,953
Are you not listening to me? It was originally his room,

629
00:48:48,123 --> 00:48:49,553
so I'm saying we should give it back to him.

630
00:48:50,153 --> 00:48:52,653
But isn't Ji Hyuk leaving home soon anyway?

631
00:48:52,723 --> 00:48:55,663
- And how would you know that? - Why are you getting so angry?

632
00:48:56,023 --> 00:48:57,023
That's strange.

633
00:48:58,833 --> 00:49:02,003
- Hey, why are you two fighting? - We're not. It's nothing serious.

634
00:49:03,133 --> 00:49:04,233
Listen, Ji Hyuk.

635
00:49:04,903 --> 00:49:07,673
I was saying Ji Wan should move into your grandmother's old room,

636
00:49:07,943 --> 00:49:11,413
but your dad insists you have it, since it was yours to begin with.

637
00:49:12,673 --> 00:49:14,813
Actually... I'd love that.

638
00:49:16,483 --> 00:49:19,453
- You would? - Of course. It was my room first.

639
00:49:20,483 --> 00:49:24,993
It still reminds me of Grandma. Yes, I'll take it back.

640
00:49:30,363 --> 00:49:31,633
He's being weird, too.

641
00:49:32,263 --> 00:49:35,063
All he does here is sleep. Why insist on that room?

642
00:49:35,833 --> 00:49:37,933
It's on the first floor. He'll hear everyone moving around.

643
00:49:46,443 --> 00:49:50,083
Compared to your last visit, your echocardiogram results...

644
00:49:51,213 --> 00:49:53,213
show that your heart's contractility has worsened slightly.

645
00:49:56,023 --> 00:49:58,353
It seems your heart is getting progressively more fatigued,

646
00:49:58,653 --> 00:50:02,663
so we need to increase the dose of your oral diuretic.

647
00:50:05,693 --> 00:50:06,693
I see.

648
00:50:13,303 --> 00:50:14,303
Ji Hyuk!

649
00:50:15,573 --> 00:50:19,273
My meeting at Headquarters ended just as you were getting off work.

650
00:50:20,513 --> 00:50:22,743
What does my schedule have to do with anything?

651
00:50:23,843 --> 00:50:25,613
You and I...

652
00:50:26,353 --> 00:50:27,413
have somewhere to be.

653
00:50:28,623 --> 00:50:29,623
Where?

654
00:50:39,733 --> 00:50:41,103
This is so good.

655
00:50:41,703 --> 00:50:44,473
It's almost too pretty to eat, but it tastes even better.

656
00:50:46,273 --> 00:50:48,603
Apparently, this place is pretty famous.

657
00:50:49,073 --> 00:50:50,603
Ji Hyuk, have some.

658
00:50:53,313 --> 00:50:56,213
I'm not a big fan of sweets lately.

659
00:50:56,283 --> 00:50:58,783
It's no fun eating alone.

660
00:51:00,753 --> 00:51:01,883
I should take a picture.

661
00:51:04,123 --> 00:51:06,953
I'll post it in my group chat.

662
00:51:09,893 --> 00:51:11,133
I always hoped that when I made a lot of money,

663
00:51:12,463 --> 00:51:13,533
you could stop working.

664
00:51:14,503 --> 00:51:15,703
I would've sent you on trips...

665
00:51:16,333 --> 00:51:17,333
That was my dream.

666
00:51:17,973 --> 00:51:18,973
There you go again.

667
00:51:19,603 --> 00:51:22,603
The other day at the shop, you looked at me with such pity.

668
00:51:23,243 --> 00:51:24,913
It really upset me.

669
00:51:25,573 --> 00:51:26,573
No, that's not...

670
00:51:27,143 --> 00:51:28,613
I wasn't pitying you.

671
00:51:29,913 --> 00:51:32,453
Mom, did it really upset you?

672
00:51:32,883 --> 00:51:34,413
We've talked about this before.

673
00:51:35,053 --> 00:51:38,753
Kids these days aren't expected to support their aging parents.

674
00:51:39,293 --> 00:51:43,763
I work hard to take care of myself and not rely on my children.

675
00:51:44,263 --> 00:51:46,493
You have no right to pity me.

676
00:51:50,333 --> 00:51:51,333
I'm sorry, Mom.

677
00:51:53,303 --> 00:51:55,003
No, it's just that when I see you working,

678
00:51:55,673 --> 00:51:57,203
I guess it just gets to me.

679
00:51:57,873 --> 00:51:59,573
Even this, you looking out for me... It makes me uncomfortable.

680
00:52:00,773 --> 00:52:04,653
I was always busy with you kids, your grandparents, and housework.

681
00:52:05,313 --> 00:52:09,453
So there's a lot I never got to do, but I never had any regrets.

682
00:52:10,023 --> 00:52:12,423
Because that's just life. You live with the hand you're dealt.

683
00:52:13,493 --> 00:52:16,123
But when you try hard to make up for all the things I missed out on,

684
00:52:16,463 --> 00:52:18,293
it makes me feel like some pitiful person.

685
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:24,773
I never meant to make you feel that way, Mom.

686
00:52:26,773 --> 00:52:29,743
I guess it's because this is so out of character for me.

687
00:52:30,503 --> 00:52:31,513
That's it.

688
00:52:32,313 --> 00:52:34,113
So that's why I was feeling that way.

689
00:52:34,983 --> 00:52:37,283
That's why they say if someone acts out of character,

690
00:52:37,343 --> 00:52:39,083
it means their time is almost up.

691
00:52:40,253 --> 00:52:41,523
Honestly.

692
00:52:44,553 --> 00:52:45,553
I guess you're right.

693
00:52:48,423 --> 00:52:49,863
I should've been doing this all along.

694
00:52:50,993 --> 00:52:53,293
But it's not like it's a bad thing.

695
00:52:56,463 --> 00:52:57,463
This is so delicious.

696
00:52:58,573 --> 00:52:59,573
I'm glad you're enjoying it.

697
00:53:01,573 --> 00:53:03,173
I guess I'm really lucky.

698
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:07,613
I don't have to worry about taking care of you and Dad later.

699
00:53:08,683 --> 00:53:09,683
If I die,

700
00:53:11,653 --> 00:53:13,013
I won't be able to do it anyway.

701
00:53:14,553 --> 00:53:15,553
That's right.

702
00:53:16,323 --> 00:53:18,653
Don't you worry about us. Just focus on your company.

703
00:53:19,823 --> 00:53:20,823
For me,

704
00:53:21,663 --> 00:53:24,793
when I present our products and hear from customers that they're working,

705
00:53:25,093 --> 00:53:26,333
it's so rewarding, and it makes me proud.

706
00:53:26,893 --> 00:53:28,363
I can only imagine how you must feel.

707
00:53:30,963 --> 00:53:32,533
If you grow your company into something great,

708
00:53:32,903 --> 00:53:36,303
just seeing you succeed is the best for your father and me.

709
00:53:39,573 --> 00:53:40,573
Yes.

710
00:53:41,283 --> 00:53:43,113
Ji Hyuk, what do you feel like eating?

711
00:53:43,843 --> 00:53:45,953
It's been a while, so I'll make you a proper home-cooked meal.

712
00:53:48,223 --> 00:53:49,223
Mushroom hot pot?

713
00:53:50,453 --> 00:53:53,753
I'll make it lightly seasoned, so don't worry and come on over.

714
00:53:54,253 --> 00:53:56,563
And you can just skip the broth.

715
00:54:00,363 --> 00:54:03,203
- Dad, I'm here. I'm heading up now. - What?

716
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:04,263
What's that smell?

717
00:54:05,073 --> 00:54:07,303
Wait, you two came in together?

718
00:54:07,603 --> 00:54:09,243
Ji Hyuk and I were on a little date.

719
00:54:09,903 --> 00:54:11,773
Honey, have you ever been to a dessert cafe?

720
00:54:15,283 --> 00:54:16,283
What?

721
00:54:20,713 --> 00:54:21,923
You're making mushroom hot pot.

722
00:54:22,683 --> 00:54:23,983
Did Ji Hyuk tell you in advance?

723
00:54:24,083 --> 00:54:26,753
No. I saw a recipe on YouTube and decided to try it.

724
00:54:26,993 --> 00:54:30,023
Wow. Aren't you getting too good at cooking?

725
00:54:33,463 --> 00:54:34,463
What?

726
00:54:35,363 --> 00:54:36,503
It's completely bland.

727
00:54:41,303 --> 00:54:42,643
- Hey! - My gosh!

728
00:54:44,173 --> 00:54:45,173
Honey!

729
00:54:47,413 --> 00:54:49,083
Get out of the way.

730
00:54:49,683 --> 00:54:51,713
I'll clean this up, so just go on. Hurry.

731
00:54:52,013 --> 00:54:55,253
Gosh, what's gotten into you?

732
00:54:56,023 --> 00:54:57,353
Oh, man...

733
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:02,623
I'm the one cooking. Why are you dumping salt in there?

734
00:55:03,063 --> 00:55:04,763
Everyone has different tastes these days,

735
00:55:05,033 --> 00:55:08,803
and I don't like salty food lately, so I made it bland on purpose.

736
00:55:09,503 --> 00:55:11,063
But it tasted like plain water.

737
00:55:12,373 --> 00:55:16,073
No, the plan was to let everyone season their own bowl later.

738
00:55:16,473 --> 00:55:18,473
It's up to the chef. What's the big deal?

739
00:55:19,613 --> 00:55:21,173
Excuse me, Chef.

740
00:55:21,913 --> 00:55:23,143
Just call me when it's ready.

741
00:55:28,823 --> 00:55:29,823
Lee Sang Cheol.

742
00:55:30,823 --> 00:55:31,953
Get a grip.

743
00:55:32,423 --> 00:55:34,293
Why are you getting so worked up over nothing?

744
00:55:51,073 --> 00:55:52,073
Oh, boy.

745
00:56:10,393 --> 00:56:11,863
You should just ask her to come back.

746
00:56:14,163 --> 00:56:15,533
This house feels so empty,

747
00:56:16,633 --> 00:56:18,433
and you're drinking at home when you never used to.

748
00:56:20,273 --> 00:56:22,073
Truth is, by taking out the mortgage and leaving her with nothing...

749
00:56:23,473 --> 00:56:24,643
Isn't it that you can't let her go, Dad?

750
00:56:27,173 --> 00:56:29,283
I'm not miserable because she's gone.

751
00:56:29,883 --> 00:56:32,183
But you've just created a reason to stay entangled with her.

752
00:56:33,153 --> 00:56:34,153
If it were me,

753
00:56:35,123 --> 00:56:36,123
I'd get a divorce.

754
00:56:37,983 --> 00:56:42,363
I'm angry at my own foolishness that doesn't fade with time.

755
00:56:44,723 --> 00:56:47,293
It's because I'm still so angry with myself,

756
00:56:48,433 --> 00:56:49,433
so just leave me alone.

757
00:57:21,633 --> 00:57:23,933
You should wear one with a bigger rock.

758
00:57:24,633 --> 00:57:27,803
But this is the engagement ring you gave me when you proposed,

759
00:57:28,103 --> 00:57:29,973
so I love it the most.

760
00:57:55,163 --> 00:57:57,303
Less than 10,000 dollars for a 1-carat?

761
00:57:57,933 --> 00:58:01,203
You said it's 26 years old, right? And you don't have the certificate.

762
00:58:01,303 --> 00:58:03,003
I can't offer more than 5,000 dollars.

763
00:58:03,073 --> 00:58:05,243
(Diamond)

764
00:58:23,763 --> 00:58:25,133
We'll get going.

765
00:58:25,333 --> 00:58:28,163
- Okay, take care. - Good work.

766
00:58:54,193 --> 00:58:57,223
- Ji Eun Oh. - I'm here to get something.

767
00:58:57,863 --> 00:59:00,493
Something you were meant to give me, but you never did.

768
00:59:03,663 --> 00:59:04,663
And what's that?

769
00:59:05,473 --> 00:59:06,473
Our memories.

770
00:59:08,203 --> 00:59:09,473
The memories of you and me...

771
00:59:10,803 --> 00:59:13,673
I need the memory of us liking each other.

772
00:59:15,713 --> 00:59:16,713
What?

773
00:59:17,013 --> 00:59:18,483
I've been thinking, and...

774
00:59:21,013 --> 00:59:22,083
if I let you...

775
00:59:23,053 --> 00:59:25,323
just go on your own, all lonely like this,

776
00:59:26,593 --> 00:59:28,253
I think I'll regret it for the rest of my life.

777
00:59:29,793 --> 00:59:31,593
I might never be able to be with anyone else.

778
00:59:35,233 --> 00:59:36,533
That's ridiculous.

779
00:59:39,273 --> 00:59:41,533
- Get out. - Doesn't this feel unfair, Ji Hyuk?

780
00:59:42,673 --> 00:59:44,043
Because I think it's incredibly unfair.

781
00:59:44,573 --> 00:59:48,483
After all we've been through... I liked you first, then you did.

782
00:59:49,283 --> 00:59:51,483
And now that I finally have feelings for you again,

783
00:59:52,513 --> 00:59:54,313
you want us to just drift apart again?

784
00:59:55,653 --> 00:59:56,683
I refuse.

785
01:00:01,763 --> 01:00:03,263
Why would you date a dying man?

786
01:00:04,163 --> 01:00:05,533
Why would you want that kind of relationship?

787
01:00:07,533 --> 01:00:08,733
A relationship with no future.

788
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:13,733
(AP Group, Younglim)

789
01:00:13,803 --> 01:00:14,903
Because it's hard on me.

790
01:00:15,773 --> 01:00:18,573
This is killing me. Do you hear me? It's killing me.

791
01:00:24,783 --> 01:00:25,783
Ji Eun Oh.

792
01:00:27,353 --> 01:00:28,483
You and I...

793
01:00:28,983 --> 01:00:30,483
have been through everything together.

794
01:00:31,583 --> 01:00:33,323
Things are already complicated between us.

795
01:00:34,023 --> 01:00:35,323
If you add love on top of all that,

796
01:00:36,463 --> 01:00:38,063
do you really think you'll be able to forget me easily?

797
01:00:39,893 --> 01:00:41,863
This isn't a normal relationship where we can just break up.

798
01:00:42,633 --> 01:00:44,303
You deserve to meet someone great, don't you?

799
01:00:46,673 --> 01:00:48,903
You think you're really something, don't you?

800
01:00:50,243 --> 01:00:53,073
You think I'll spend my whole life pining for you?

801
01:01:00,413 --> 01:01:01,413
You...

802
01:01:04,353 --> 01:01:05,553
You pity me.

803
01:01:14,193 --> 01:01:15,403
Don't pity me.

804
01:01:16,933 --> 01:01:18,003
On my own,

805
01:01:19,033 --> 01:01:20,373
I can live a good life until I'm gone.

806
01:01:22,443 --> 01:01:23,503
So just stop.

807
01:01:31,483 --> 01:01:33,353
Do you really think I'm doing this because I feel so sorry for you...

808
01:01:34,453 --> 01:01:37,883
that I want to stay with you until the very end out of pity?

809
01:01:39,453 --> 01:01:40,453
No.

810
01:01:42,293 --> 01:01:43,863
I'm really doing this for myself.

811
01:01:46,493 --> 01:01:48,633
You can't have regrets if you leave nothing undone.

812
01:01:50,803 --> 01:01:52,133
"I did everything I could."

813
01:01:53,233 --> 01:01:54,333
"I did enough."

814
01:01:55,103 --> 01:01:56,473
"I tried every last thing."

815
01:01:57,643 --> 01:01:59,073
That's just who I am.

816
01:02:00,473 --> 01:02:01,813
Do you really not know me by now?

817
01:02:05,583 --> 01:02:06,653
I don't care.

818
01:02:12,523 --> 01:02:14,353
For you, it'll all be over when you're gone,

819
01:02:17,393 --> 01:02:19,133
but I'm the one who has to keep on living.

820
01:02:23,503 --> 01:02:25,303
So whose feelings matter more here?

821
01:02:27,173 --> 01:02:29,003
Mine, right?

822
01:02:31,473 --> 01:02:33,243
I'm the one who's going to suffer more.

823
01:02:49,023 --> 01:02:50,023
So...

824
01:02:53,493 --> 01:02:55,133
let me do this...

825
01:02:57,063 --> 01:02:58,203
my way.

826
01:03:00,903 --> 01:03:01,903
Eun Oh.

827
01:03:04,973 --> 01:03:06,243
I want to live a peaceful,

828
01:03:07,943 --> 01:03:09,513
ordinary life until the end.

829
01:03:13,313 --> 01:03:14,783
In that ordinary life,

830
01:03:16,523 --> 01:03:17,523
please let me be a part of it.

831
01:03:19,793 --> 01:03:20,793
I also...

832
01:03:22,663 --> 01:03:24,163
want to be the most important person...

833
01:03:25,363 --> 01:03:27,693
in your everyday life.

834
01:03:30,533 --> 01:03:31,703
A memory like that...

835
01:03:33,203 --> 01:03:34,333
I need it so badly.

836
01:03:46,313 --> 01:03:47,983
Why are you making this so hard on me?

837
01:03:53,253 --> 01:03:55,193
If you truly care about me,

838
01:03:58,963 --> 01:04:00,333
even if it's just for one day,

839
01:04:02,763 --> 01:04:04,703
please be my boyfriend.

840
01:04:14,973 --> 01:04:16,043
You can't regret this.

841
01:04:37,103 --> 01:04:38,333
And no taking it back.

842
01:06:47,163 --> 01:06:50,203
(Our Golden Days)

843
01:06:50,433 --> 01:06:54,003
I heard Ji Hyuk and Eun Oh decided to start dating.

844
01:06:54,003 --> 01:06:56,473
Do you really need a reason to like someone? You just do.

845
01:06:56,543 --> 01:06:59,043
Today, I'm here as your girlfriend.

846
01:06:59,343 --> 01:07:03,213
- Ko Seong Hui stole so many years. - Then just divorce her.

847
01:07:03,313 --> 01:07:06,353
She's at my studio. What am I supposed to do?

848
01:07:07,013 --> 01:07:09,623
You're my daughter. I am your mother.

849
01:07:09,823 --> 01:07:13,693
You know nothing about my life. How dare you lecture your mother?

850
01:07:13,853 --> 01:07:16,293
Woo Jin, you're all I have.

851
01:07:16,363 --> 01:07:19,133
Does Ji Hyuk need a heart transplant?

852
01:07:19,863 --> 01:07:21,133
I can't go on!

853
01:07:22,263 --> 01:07:25,473
What am I going to do? My poor Ji Hyuk.
