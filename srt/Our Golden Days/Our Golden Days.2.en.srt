1
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:04,540
I found her.

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:07,780
You did?

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,220
Are you sure?

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,780
Send me a photo first.

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,890
Then the address.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,020
I'll hear the rest in person.

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,390
It's not a topic to discuss
over the phone.

8
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,160
Bring me papers, statements,
and recordings.

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,260
Anything that's proof.

10
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,360
I'll text you
a time and location to meet.

11
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:30,940
(Chief Hong)

12
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,390
I told you to text me
instead of calling.

13
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:54,890
Stay where you are.

14
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,530
It's uncomfortable? How so?

15
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,230
Do you need anything?

16
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,670
You have food and clothing.

17
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:01,770
You have air conditioning.

18
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,240
You don't know
why you should be in hiding?

19
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,740
(Episode 2)

20
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,750
Once I move out,
Ji Wan can take my room,

21
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,820
and you can rent out his room
like you did before.

22
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,020
Wouldn't that help you both?

23
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,020
Why would you worry about that?

24
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,320
Your dad
is still capable of working.

25
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,090
Ji Hyuk.

26
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,760
You'll want to get married
when you meet someone...

27
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,330
you really love.

28
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,660
That's my point, exactly.

29
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,760
Why are you moving out
for no reason?

30
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,770
The second you move out,

31
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:35,230
you'll have so many expenses.

32
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,600
And your hobbies have been
a bit excessive up until now.

33
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,170
Dad, Mom.

34
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,370
I really don't want to get married.

35
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,540
Why not?
Are you also one of those people?

36
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,680
I hear young people
these days are like that.

37
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:51,320
Since things are tough,
they just give up on everything.

38
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,750
That's why they don't get married.

39
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,390
It's not giving up. It's a choice.

40
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,720
That's how it works
for my generation.

41
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,220
That's not a choice.

42
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,790
You are just giving up
without trying.

43
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,800
Do you think my generation
got married and started a family...

44
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,630
because we were well-off
and things were so easy?

45
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,430
It's your determination
that matters.

46
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,030
Nothing is impossible
for a young man.

47
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,140
As a man, can't you support
a woman you love?

48
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,310
All you need is a healthy body.

49
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,340
You're right, Dad.
I totally agree with you.

50
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,050
And just because
you don't want to get married,

51
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,450
you are trying to move out
so hastily like that?

52
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,020
The second you move out,

53
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,150
you won't be able
to save up any money.

54
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,990
What if you end up meeting
a good woman after some time?

55
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,590
Then you'll bitterly regret it.

56
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,360
"Why did I make such a decision?"

57
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,000
Is it that...

58
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:42,000
you want to buy a decent house
before getting married?

59
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:46,600
Hey, I raised all three of you
while taking good care...

60
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,170
of your sick grandfather.

61
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,240
Are you listening to me?

62
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:55,650
Yes.

63
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:59,150
I understand what you mean.
Please eat.

64
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,520
My goodness.

65
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,140
Ji Hyuk, are you serious
that you don't want to get married?

66
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,210
Ji Hyuk, are you seriously
not getting married?

67
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,250
No.

68
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,750
Unbelievable.
You don't want to get married?

69
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,150
I'm dying to get married.

70
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,650
Are you still moving out?

71
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,320
I'm looking for a place.

72
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,690
Then why did you not say
anything to Mom and Dad?

73
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,360
It seemed like
you would do as they told you.

74
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,590
They were voicing their opinion,
so I heard them out.

75
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,430
I get it. Ji Hyuk.

76
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,660
Will you still move out
even if Mom and Dad stop you?

77
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,100
They won't approve it anyway.

78
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,740
Ji Hyuk, you can't be like that.

79
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,740
You should've made
yourself clear earlier.

80
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,140
Why did you just listen?

81
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,880
I don't need my parents' permission
to move out when I'm 33.

82
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,450
I guess you're right.

83
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,820
Convincing Mom, Dad,
and even Grandma?

84
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,880
That's impossible.

85
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,490
If you're not getting married,
you should move out.

86
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:09,490
I really don't understand.

87
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,590
You have a good job,
a decent salary,

88
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,420
good looks,
no worries about Dad's retirement,

89
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,430
and you're even good
at dating women.

90
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,130
Why aren't you getting married?

91
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,430
You sound just like Mom and Dad.

92
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:21,230
These days, there are more people
who don't get married.

93
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,740
Hey, they do want to get married,
but they just can't.

94
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,300
House prices are too high,
and they don't have money.

95
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,540
Either way...

96
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,480
Ji Hyuk, when will you move out?

97
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,680
Once I find a place.

98
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,710
So I don't want you guys
to get involved in my business.

99
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,420
Even if you ask me to, I won't.

100
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:42,150
I don't like getting involved
in other people's business.

101
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:46,960
Me neither.

102
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,490
It's your life.

103
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,360
If you've made up your mind,
you should go for it.

104
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,800
It's impossible to convince
Mom and Dad anyway.

105
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,770
- Get out.
- Okay.

106
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,430
See you.

107
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,910
Ji Hyuk, does that mean...

108
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,810
I can get married first?

109
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,650
- Can you even afford marriage?
- Of course, I can.

110
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,480
I have a woman I love to death...

111
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,950
and my healthy body!

112
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,820
I can get married!

113
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:14,750
To my girlfriend!

114
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,300
My heart sank when I heard
Ji Hyuk would move out.

115
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,670
I didn't think he'd leave
before getting married.

116
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,670
I really don't understand
young people these days.

117
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,140
How would we possibly understand
young people?

118
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,810
When I decided to marry you,

119
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,240
my mom didn't understand me.

120
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,240
She said she didn't understand
young people these days.

121
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,750
She didn't want me to live like her,

122
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,320
so she let me become
an elementary school teacher,

123
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,780
but all I wanted was to get married.

124
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,920
You did.

125
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,320
When we were young,

126
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,260
we started by renting
a semi-basement studio.

127
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,660
But did we complain?

128
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:57,130
We were just happy to be together.

129
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:02,030
When the rain was leaking in,
we put a bucket under it...

130
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,840
and just said
the dripping sound was funny.

131
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,440
It was really fun, right?

132
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:11,710
I didn't expect Ji Hyuk
to say something so immature.

133
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,580
That's because Ji Hyuk
hasn't experienced true love.

134
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,280
How do you know that?

135
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,620
I've never seen him
go out day and night...

136
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,990
or spend all his time on his phone.

137
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,420
Ji Hyuk was totally different
from Ji Wan and Su Bin.

138
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,830
I guess you're right.

139
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,260
When a man meets
a woman he truly loves,

140
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,660
he doesn't care about anything else.

141
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,360
He'd just want to live with her.

142
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,330
Do you think that applies
only to our generation?

143
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,540
You can see on the news
that many people don't get married.

144
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:43,440
Does that mean
they don't love each other...

145
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,040
enough to overcome
hardships together?

146
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,840
If they want only good things...

147
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,580
and don't want to share hardships,
it's not love.

148
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,620
They just think of marriage
as a business.

149
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,320
I'm just glad that
Ji Hyuk understood what we said.

150
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,560
He's smart enough
to understand what we say.

151
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,390
He's just putting on airs.

152
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,800
(Lee Ji Hyuk's application)

153
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,830
You have scuba diving
and surfing instructor licenses.

154
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,400
I guess you like water sports.

155
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,370
I like all kinds of sports.

156
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,740
I also enjoy
triathlons and marathons.

157
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,540
If you've done triathlons,
you must have great lung capacity.

158
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,910
Shall we begin, then?

159
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,940
When you are done with this,

160
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,010
can you please replace...

161
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,710
the track light bulbs over there?

162
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:52,980
I want to dim
the brightness a little.

163
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,850
- Okay.
- Thank you.

164
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,910
My gosh. There you are.

165
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,750
This is beautiful.

166
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,820
You're here.

167
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,890
Ms. Ji.

168
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,690
You're the perfect example of...

169
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:06,760
a tsundere.

170
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,230
"Tsundere?"

171
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,330
You sounded so cold and harsh...

172
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:11,760
when you were talking to me.

173
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,970
But you were going to do...

174
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:17,470
the ceiling grinding work yourself.

175
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,270
I just started it.

176
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,840
It could be done
thanks to the Paint Chief.

177
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:23,740
That's not it.

178
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:26,740
Ms. Ji even increased
the electrical capacity...

179
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,780
by 1.5 times.

180
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,550
See? You're such a tsundere.

181
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,950
I'm so touched.

182
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,720
I'll go and change the bulbs.

183
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,120
- Okay. I'll be right there.
- All right.

184
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,390
By the way, I'm touched too.

185
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,330
You were so generous
with the bonus for the Paint Chief.

186
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,230
You know, I do have a conscience.

187
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,430
Thank you so much.

188
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,130
Thank you for recognizing it.

189
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,540
My gosh.

190
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,440
Why did you come back in?

191
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,180
- What is it? Did something happen?
- No.

192
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,550
You were coughing
and had trouble sleeping last night.

193
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,350
I don't want you to drive.

194
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,590
I'll drive you.

195
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,220
You don't have to be like this.

196
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,090
I might have to go out suddenly
because of Yeong Ra's exhibition,

197
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,860
so I should drive my car.

198
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,660
Then I'll have Mr. Oh drive you
wherever you need to go.

199
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,660
You can go around in Mr. Oh's car.

200
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,100
I told you.

201
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,870
It doesn't look good...

202
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,600
that I go around
in my husband's company car.

203
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,840
It's for official business.
Why would you let your wife use it?

204
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:28,840
I don't want people
to bad-mouth you.

205
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,950
You're quite stubborn.

206
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,580
Driving is actually fun, honey.

207
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,160
Are you sure
you made the appointment?

208
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,230
Okay.

209
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:52,700
Be on standby
and let me know the departure time.

210
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,740
(Secretary Ko)

211
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,940
It's me.

212
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,910
This is it for today.

213
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,350
Mr. Park,
can I have a word with you?

214
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,580
Please check this.

215
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,520
Sales in the first quarter
increased slightly.

216
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,160
Yes. By 11 percent.

217
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,130
How are you feeling?

218
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,930
- Pardon?
- You must've felt something.

219
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,100
You could be excited
or a bit disappointed,

220
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,300
thinking you could do better.

221
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,770
I just did my job.

222
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,970
You sound so dull.

223
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,040
I'll get going, then.

224
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,620
By the way,

225
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,160
why do I have to tell you
that Ji Hyuk broke up...

226
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,160
with his girlfriend?

227
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,900
Why do you even ask?

228
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,630
You know why.

229
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,600
I do know, but still.

230
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:06,870
Well...

231
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:10,470
Ji Eun Oh's been crushing
on Lee Ji Hyuk for a long time.

232
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,840
But...

233
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,810
I wonder how that can benefit me.

234
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,850
My goodness.

235
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,620
That doesn't sound like you.

236
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,720
That's not what Chief Director
Park Seong Jae would say.

237
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,590
You don't know me at all.

238
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:32,130
I'm a businessman
and a calculative one at that.

239
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:37,470
That thing? Give and take?

240
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,170
Fine. I'll do you a favor, then.

241
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,510
Okay. We have a deal.

242
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,850
What do you need me to do?

243
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,580
When the time comes,

244
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,520
I'll tell you then.

245
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,320
Promise...

246
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,990
to tell me this time.

247
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:06,430
(Cafe Agit)

248
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,770
Hello.

249
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:15,840
- Hey.
- Eun Oh.

250
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,010
I need you to watch a movie with me.

251
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,780
A movie?

252
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,450
Well...

253
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,480
You asked me to tell you
when Ji Hyuk broke up...

254
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,120
with his latest girlfriend.

255
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:30,720
They broke up?

256
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,230
I guess so?

257
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,430
What does that mean?

258
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:39,960
They broke up.

259
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:41,430
Are you sure?

260
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,630
I'm here.

261
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,070
You're here too, Seong Jae?

262
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:48,940
I need to use the restroom.

263
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,520
Why are you here?

264
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,590
To meet a client.

265
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,890
What about you?

266
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,730
I felt a bit dizzy,

267
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,060
so I'm taking a stroll.

268
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,420
An iced Americano, right?

269
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,750
Give me 30 minutes.

270
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,090
This meeting won't take long.

271
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:39,020
Do you want to have lunch with me?

272
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,390
No. I need you for something.

273
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,830
We can eat afterward.

274
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,560
Okay.

275
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,110
What's up with you?

276
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:59,540
What?
What are you doing here, Ji Hyuk?

277
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:03,110
What?

278
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,120
Can't I ask why you're here?

279
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:08,820
You saw me earlier.

280
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,690
Come here, Eun Oh.

281
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,490
What for?

282
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,020
You don't have a fever.

283
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,490
What's up with you?

284
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,230
Are we out of
the Colombian coffee beans?

285
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,370
She's such a troublemaker.

286
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,000
Hello. Let's sit over here.

287
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,520
Hello?

288
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:18,690
Yes. This is Ji Eun Oh
at Eunoism Design.

289
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,330
You need a quote?

290
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:23,790
Yes, I can do that.

291
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,000
Where's the location?

292
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,030
It will cost more,
but I recommend...

293
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,300
a hardwood floor.

294
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:34,040
Maroon black
or blonde oak would work best.

295
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,440
Which do you prefer?

296
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,740
I think blonde oak...

297
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,630
(Europe)

298
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,370
Yes. I decided.

299
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,470
- You decided?
- Yes.

300
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:11,680
Italy, Spain, France.

301
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,010
The three main European countries.

302
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,380
For how long?

303
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:17,110
We might as well take up
the whole month.

304
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,720
It's our first visit,

305
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,520
and it might be our last.

306
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,720
Let's go!

307
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:26,020
Try to stay classy, Da Jeong.

308
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,660
I don't have to.

309
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,690
Who cares what people think of me?

310
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,100
I'm 58 years old.

311
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,560
We live to be a hundred,

312
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,400
and that means I'm just halfway.

313
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,800
I'm still young.

314
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,670
At this rate, my wife will be
young at heart with aging looks.

315
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:39,800
Right?

316
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,240
I was pretty cheerful and lovely...

317
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,270
in my 20s before I got married.

318
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,440
I could dance too.

319
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,380
Yes.

320
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,310
Europe will make you young again.

321
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,480
I like that.

322
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,520
When shall we leave
to become younger?

323
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,420
The sooner, the better.

324
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,620
When Su Bin comes home,

325
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,320
I'll have her call the number.

326
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,420
She backpacked in Europe, you know.

327
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,860
The sooner, the better?

328
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,890
Mr. Lee.

329
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,830
No, should I call you
Advisor Lee now?

330
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:10,300
Let's meet for a meal
after you retire.

331
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,800
You can start work
two months from now.

332
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:16,640
Why aren't you listening?

333
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,710
What? No, hang on.

334
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:21,280
First, I need to talk
to Mr. Choi, the CEO.

335
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,210
I must schedule a meeting
before we leave.

336
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,420
Okay.

337
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,720
Hello, I'm Choi Sang Hui's wife.

338
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,430
Pardon?

339
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,330
Oh, hello. I'm Lee Sang Cheol.

340
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:40,800
I'm supposed to meet Mr. Choi.

341
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,230
Yes, I know who you are, but...

342
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,340
My husband's in the hospital.

343
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,310
What? He's in the hospital?

344
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,840
I can let you stay
once a month for a night.

345
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,250
You'll get a single bed.

346
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,310
Where do I sleep, then?

347
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:59,220
On the floor or on the couch.

348
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:01,650
On the couch?

349
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:06,320
Hey. How about I gift you a couch?

350
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,430
No. Buy me a home theater.

351
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,730
I picked one out.

352
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:11,960
Now, I can watch sports matches...

353
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,700
on a huge screen with the sound on.

354
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:16,730
I'm beginning to feel jealous.

355
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,100
You should get married.

356
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,300
Then you can move out of...

357
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,380
You're right, so there's no need
to worry about hurting my feelings.

358
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,710
Sorry. I got a bit too excited.

359
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,780
It's fine.

360
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,320
It's good to see you smile again.

361
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,160
Is it? Then let's go shopping.

362
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:42,730
(Hanguk Hospital)

363
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:57,980
What do you mean
it's advanced pancreatic cancer?

364
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:01,610
I talked to him just last week.

365
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:04,580
He passed out and was brought here
over the weekend.

366
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,850
We had no idea he was ill.

367
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:12,260
How could this be?

368
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,490
(Hanguk Hospital)

369
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,660
Oh, thank you.

370
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:23,500
You worked
at Gyeongseong T and C, right?

371
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,000
My father told me.

372
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,240
Yes.

373
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,770
Mr. Choi spoke a lot about you too.

374
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,310
That you're working hard
to learn the business.

375
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:41,620
I'm Executive Director Choi Min Sik.

376
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,120
(Seongil Weaving,
Executive Director Choi Min Sik)

377
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:47,290
Oh, yes. Thank you.

378
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,660
Executive Director Choi Min Sik.

379
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,300
With my father ill in bed,

380
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,500
I thought you'd feel anxious.

381
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,630
That's why
I asked to speak with you.

382
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,970
Your father's health comes first.

383
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,310
Let's see how the surgery goes...

384
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,880
He won't have surgery.

385
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,010
It's pointless at this stage.

386
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:12,550
The doctors and I are in agreement.

387
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,920
So I don't think
I can honor the promise...

388
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,090
my father made.

389
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,430
I'm aware...

390
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:25,160
my father offered you
an advisor position.

391
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,170
But I will take over as CEO now,

392
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,300
and I have other plans.

393
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,040
But...

394
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,540
Your father made me the offer,
and I accepted it...

395
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,040
over six months ago.

396
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,710
Up until six months ago,

397
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,850
did you have anywhere else to go
other than our company?

398
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,290
You were just lucky.

399
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,660
It's not like we deprived you...

400
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,830
of another opportunity
or stopped you from doing something.

401
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,540
You asked me to come here
to show me this guy's profile?

402
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:11,710
I told you when you came in
to register as a member.

403
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:14,710
That it'll be hard
to match you with a five-star man.

404
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,580
Are you telling me...

405
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:19,320
to date a man
who's 17 years older than me?

406
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:22,850
This gentleman is that much older,

407
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:25,520
but he took good care of himself,

408
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,420
so he looks to be in his mid-30s.

409
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,590
Meet up with him.

410
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,230
Su Bin, what can you do
when the men of your dreams...

411
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:34,160
won't choose you back?

412
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,730
He's the only chance you'll get.

413
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,570
His main requirement was dating
someone young and attractive.

414
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,170
That's why he agreed
to meet with you.

415
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,540
He's a successful businessman.

416
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,550
He's loaded.

417
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:52,120
I'll meet him as a test
and for the experience.

418
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,320
Just so you know,

419
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,150
my channel will have
100,000 subscribers one day.

420
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,490
I won't be marrying a guy...

421
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,920
just for his money.

422
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:05,100
Matching these items would be nice,

423
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,900
and carrying a different purse
will add a feminine touch.

424
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:13,340
I'm young, pretty, well-educated,

425
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,540
and my parents
are financially independent.

426
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,170
How can she treat me like this...

427
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:17,210
just because
I don't have a stable job?

428
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:18,980
You wait and see.

429
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,810
My channel will be a success
someday.

430
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,750
Oh, no.

431
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:26,450
Darn, you're stuck
at 13,500 subscribers.

432
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:29,390
What do you think is the problem?

433
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:33,620
Wear a bathing suit
like I suggested.

434
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:35,060
You won't be the first.

435
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,830
Change clothes
in front of the camera.

436
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,960
Wouldn't that give
a realistic touch?

437
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,570
No way. I can't do things like that.

438
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:43,530
You know how I am.

439
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:45,970
Fine.

440
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:50,210
Let's deal
with our financial issues first.

441
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,710
Our joint account...

442
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,650
has only 153 dollars left.

443
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,380
We need to buy new clothes
for the next video...

444
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,720
and book a studio,

445
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:01,450
so what should we do?

446
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,390
I'll have to ask my dad for help.

447
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:08,430
Maybe I should tutor
another student.

448
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,160
But I can't stand
the tutoring job I already have.

449
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:16,400
I'm at a loss about
how to film our next video.

450
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:19,470
Hold on.

451
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:23,170
Why don't we film outdoors
rather than in a studio?

452
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,680
Whatever. It's fine.

453
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,920
As if Seongil Weaving
is my only choice.

454
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,420
I can't believe him. What a brat.

455
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,360
He won't even be
half as successful as his father.

456
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,530
Even if I had no other offers,

457
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,560
six months...

458
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,300
should have been enough for me
to get recruited.

459
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,580
You're back.

460
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:05,250
Honey, we should buy new clothes
to get ready for the trip.

461
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,550
You barely have anything to wear.

462
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,590
By the way, how's Mr. Choi?

463
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,160
How sick is he?

464
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,420
It's nothing.

465
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:18,260
By the way,
why don't we begin the trip...

466
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,260
in late May?

467
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:23,630
The weather will be getting hot
by then.

468
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,000
I see.

469
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,000
You're acting strange.

470
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,770
Didn't you say,
"The sooner, the better?"

471
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:33,080
Maybe it's because I just retired,

472
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,550
but I don't feel
completely committed.

473
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,220
That's not the case.

474
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,220
Tell me the truth.

475
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:43,250
I told you it was nothing.
Forget about it.

476
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,320
I know something's up.

477
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,960
Do you now read minds or something?

478
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,960
Let go of me.

479
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:50,560
Did something happen to Mr. Choi?

480
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,630
That's it, isn't it?
What's going on?

481
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,000
Nothing's going on!

482
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,000
Hold on.

483
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,470
This is
Executive Director Choi Min Sik...

484
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:02,540
at Seongil Weaving.

485
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:05,580
I'm reaching out to you,
feeling bad about springing...

486
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,910
this decision on you.

487
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,250
After speaking with my father,

488
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:12,250
we decided to offer you
some condolence money.

489
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,480
Kindly forward me
your bank account number.

490
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,750
You crazy little brat.

491
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,220
How dare he...

492
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:22,290
What is that about?

493
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:25,760
Well...

494
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,700
Mr. Choi has
terminal pancreatic cancer.

495
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:30,730
Since his son is now
taking over the company,

496
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,100
the advisor position I was offered
was canceled.

497
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,370
Are you happy now?

498
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:44,550
That little brat. He's not even 40,
yet he dared...

499
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,420
to offer me condolence money
and ask for my bank account number!

500
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:51,190
Who does he take me for?

501
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:53,860
Unbelievable.

502
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,230
(Gyeongseong Executive Manager
Lee Sang Cheol)

503
00:25:58,860 --> 00:25:59,930
He's not responding.

504
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,630
What do we do, then?

505
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,200
We should give him something
to resolve this cleanly.

506
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,440
Ji Hyuk.

507
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,010
I have feelings for you, Ji Hyuk.

508
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,750
Can you be my boyfriend?

509
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:20,480
We actually make a good couple.

510
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,850
What's she doing in that corner?

511
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:27,060
This probably shocked you, but...

512
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:28,830
Anyway, Ji Hyuk,

513
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,390
don't date other women.

514
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:33,260
- Be my boyfriend.
- Hey!

515
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:35,400
You're out of your mind.

516
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,630
It's wrong to go after someone
who has a girlfriend.

517
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:38,770
That's not it.

518
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,440
He broke up with her.

519
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,310
So, were you rehearsing
your love confession?

520
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,850
Why did you have to come out here?

521
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,480
You left your phone inside,
that's why.

522
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,990
Your mom kept calling,
so I answered, but...

523
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,050
It was Ggang Oh, wasn't it?

524
00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:00,120
Employees from a nearby office
booked a team dinner,

525
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,420
and your help is needed.

526
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,060
Really?

527
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,630
I should ask the guys
if anyone's interested...

528
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:06,660
in a part-time job.

529
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:08,530
I already contacted Hye Na.

530
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:10,900
Thanks.

531
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,670
Sharp and quick as always,
Oh Su Jeong.

532
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,570
I was busy with work...

533
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:17,140
and couldn't help my mom
for over a month.

534
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,810
Thanks so much.

535
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,010
- What...
- Thanks.

536
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,750
- I'll call you. Thanks again.
- Sure.

537
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:34,590
(Dodoge Coin)

538
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:37,590
- Why you...
- Hey!

539
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,630
Where's your apron, you brat?

540
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:40,830
This is all your fault.

541
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,700
I wouldn't be doing this
if you hadn't quit your job.

542
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,400
I put four years' worth of my salary
into opening this place...

543
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,640
so you and Mom can make a living.

544
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,610
Do I look like someone
who works at a place like this?

545
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:49,770
You brat.

546
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:51,840
Don't you dare. Don't.

547
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:52,910
Of course, you do.

548
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,540
Darn it.

549
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,810
Put on your apron and help Mom.

550
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,420
I'll leave it at that
since I'm in a good mood.

551
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,750
Why are you happy
when you don't make any money?

552
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,150
How much do you make now...

553
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,290
compared to your old job
at that foreign company?

554
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,590
Is it even a tenth of that?

555
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,330
It's only been a year,
so naturally...

556
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:10,660
my studio hasn't taken off yet.

557
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:13,860
I can't believe you actually came.

558
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,100
What menu did they choose,
and what about the side dishes?

559
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,730
I'm almost done.

560
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:19,670
I'm leaving
after we serve this large party...

561
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:20,770
since Eun Oh's here too.

562
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,870
That brat.

563
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,210
Okay, let's drink!

564
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:27,140
Go on, have a drink.

565
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,580
- Oh, excuse me.
- More kimchi?

566
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,620
- Can I get you more salted fish?
- Sure, that'd be nice.

567
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:37,190
Ggang Oh, table number two.

568
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,330
- Tiring, isn't it?
- No.

569
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:46,160
Why would I be exhausted?
That's ridiculous.

570
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:47,930
I love your spirit.

571
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:50,900
I wonder when Gang Oh
will be back tonight.

572
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,470
Mom, I was asked
to design an apartment unit.

573
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:56,470
Really? That's great news.

574
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,390
Unbelievable. Goodness me.

575
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,360
My gosh.

576
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:14,690
Wait.

577
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:18,160
She should lie down
to get proper rest.

578
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,600
Hold on.

579
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:32,940
My gosh!

580
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,250
My head.

581
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,610
What on earth?

582
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,420
- Mom, what on earth?
- Eun Oh.

583
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:43,190
What were you doing?

584
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,220
Well...

585
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:48,060
I wanted to carry you to your bed.

586
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:50,630
- Me?
- Yes.

587
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,000
- You've got to be kidding me.
- Oh, dear.

588
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,600
Mom, did you think
you could carry me?

589
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,570
- Yes.
- Mom, I can't believe you.

590
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:03,410
Gosh, are you okay?

591
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:05,140
- I'm so sorry about this.
- It hurts.

592
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,980
- Oh, dear. I'm sorry.
- I'm all right.

593
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,510
- Are you okay?
- Come on.

594
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,790
Are you done?

595
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,860
Please email me
when you have an estimate ready.

596
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,090
Sure thing.

597
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:26,530
By the way, removing the balcony
next to the kitchen...

598
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:28,300
will reduce your storage space.

599
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,130
Without expanding the kitchen,

600
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:32,400
you can still fit
all the small furniture.

601
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,170
I noticed that the wall
in the small room was a partition.

602
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:37,640
I guess
the previous owner expanded it.

603
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,280
I just want a quote.
I haven't decided to hire you.

604
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:43,650
Of course, I know.

605
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:45,820
Now that I'm here,
I'm just sharing my ideas.

606
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:47,050
Okay.

607
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,020
The screen doors are opening.

608
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:27,020
Watch your step.

609
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,390
My goodness.

610
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:31,930
Diabetes.

611
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:33,860
It's hypoglycemic shock.
Please help me.

612
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,800
Hypoglycemic shock?
Please hang on a second.

613
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:47,740
Here, have this. It's chocolate.

614
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:58,660
Do you think you can stand up?

615
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:08,500
Are you feeling better?

616
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,770
I'm fine. Thank you.

617
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:17,810
Are you sure
you don't have to go to a doctor?

618
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:20,080
Or you should call your family.

619
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:23,750
I had that chocolate.

620
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:28,080
It's something I keep on hand
in case my blood sugar gets low.

621
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:30,150
And water.

622
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:34,520
If you're all right,

623
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:36,760
I should get going now.

624
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:42,070
Gosh, please don't do this.
It's okay.

625
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,210
Let me help you up.

626
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,210
Thank you.

627
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,280
It's no big deal. Take care.

628
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,620
Oh, no.

629
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,890
What? Wait.

630
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:10,890
My gosh.

631
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:13,760
(50 dollars)

632
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,800
This is too much.

(Sending 3,000 dollars

635
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,730
I just wired 3,000 dollars.

636
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:48,200
- I got the money.
- Okay. Good.

637
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,870
The balance of 27,000 dollars...

638
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:51,870
should be transferred
when you move in.

639
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:53,170
The monthly rent
is 1,200 dollars, right?

640
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:55,940
All right. It's all done.

641
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,970
Thank you.

(Lee Ji Hyuk)

645
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,790
Do it. Why can't you do it?

646
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:18,160
This is about work.

647
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
(Lee Ji Hyuk)

648
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,970
My goodness.
What are you doing here?

649
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,040
You told me to come.

650
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:32,580
I did? When?

651
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,880
(Ji Eun Oh)

652
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:38,050
Well...

653
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,420
I was going to tell you to come...

654
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,890
and sign
the construction statement...

655
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:46,160
When you were about to say it,

656
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,320
I showed up, right?

657
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,360
Let's go and sign the document.

658
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,100
Let's eat first.

659
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,570
I don't feel like eating yet.

660
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:59,000
It's impossible that you don't want
to eat when it's mealtime.

661
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:02,210
- Let's go. I'm hungry.
- I need to talk to Su Jeong.

662
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:05,010
How do you think I knew
you were here at this hour?

663
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,080
Well...

664
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:24,290
What are you doing?
That's not like you.

665
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,460
What do you mean?

666
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,210
Why are you eating them separately?

667
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,440
Just do as you always do.

668
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:45,750
Here.

669
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,680
Dig in.

670
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,800
This is Ji Eun Oh.

671
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,140
All you want...

672
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,210
to eat with me is this gukbap.

673
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:11,440
You like gukbap the most.

674
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:15,440
If I say I like something else,

675
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:18,110
will you go to eat it with me
on the weekend?

676
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,280
Whatever you like,
it's important to eat well.

677
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,280
Don't skip meals.

678
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:23,620
Darn it.

679
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:25,290
Did you not hear me?

680
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,430
You asked me
to go to eat something good.

681
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:32,830
Why did you not answer my question?

682
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,670
Don't you have anyone else
to go with?

683
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:37,100
I'm really busy on weekends.

684
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,400
Are you busy this weekend?

685
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,280
Is the business at the cafe
that bad?

686
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,510
Is it okay for you
to be absent on weekends?

687
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,350
Not exactly.

688
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:52,420
Does it make enough money
to pay the manager?

689
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,080
Of course. A lot more than that.

690
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,550
Is the manager paid well?

691
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,650
Enough to cover living expenses.

692
00:36:58,650 --> 00:36:59,990
What do the living expenses
include here?

693
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,660
Transportation, meals,

694
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:04,490
some miscellaneous expenses,
and snacks?

695
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:11,930
I hear you only get half
of the manager's salary.

696
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,870
Yeon Su told me
that she couldn't understand you.

697
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,340
How would I possibly get...

698
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:20,610
the full salary of a cafe manager
from her?

699
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:21,910
I know how much money
was invested in the cafe.

700
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:24,680
Also, she let me
do the interior design of the cafe,

701
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,620
register it as my office
for my business,

702
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,420
use it as my office,

703
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,920
and make money as a manager.

704
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:32,620
She even let me take a day off
when there's interior design work.

705
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,290
That's nice.

706
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,130
She's incredibly nice.

707
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:37,130
Hey, you brat.

708
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:39,830
She didn't invest in the cafe
because of you.

709
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:43,270
She just moved its location
so Value of Hangyeol can continue.

710
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:45,270
She just needed someone
to take care of the cafe,

711
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:46,870
and a junior from our club
seemed to be the perfect fit.

712
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:48,870
That means you were just someone...

713
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:50,210
whom she needed.

714
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,110
The cafe interior?

715
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,610
She just needed the material cost
because you did the work.

716
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:54,880
She let you
register your business...

717
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,450
and use the cafe as your office?

718
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,610
For the building owner
and a successful architect,

719
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,050
that's not a big favor.

720
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:02,120
All you need to do is thank her.

721
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,920
Don't be so presumptuous
and take only half of your salary.

722
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:08,060
Did you just say I was presumptuous?

723
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,490
What did I do
that's so presumptuous?

724
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:11,930
You're not in a position to be
overly concerned about your decency.

725
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,900
Eun Oh.

726
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,270
You don't have to think
that this is about your pride.

727
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,840
Darn it! The condescending
Lee Ji Hyuk is back.

728
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:23,370
I thought I hadn't seen that side
of you for about half a year.

729
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:28,010
Well... I mean...

730
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:31,250
Wait. Hey!

731
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:40,820
I should've talked
about getting the full salary first.

732
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,570
So you just ate gukbap and left?

733
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,330
I didn't even finish my food.

734
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:55,170
I should've downed the soup.

735
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:56,510
It would've made me feel better.

736
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:59,780
Come to think of it, Ji Hyuk,

737
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:02,310
who's so particular and stiff,
is just perfect for you.

738
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:05,050
When you were supposed
to tell him about your feelings,

739
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:06,650
you had a fight with him.

740
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,620
I forgot about it for a moment.

741
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:12,760
It's just getting worse.

742
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,320
Hey, Ji Eun Oh.
Don't flatter yourself.

743
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:18,530
Things have never been good for you.

744
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:23,030
Just tell him about your feelings
over a drink.

745
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,930
Tell him that something upsetting
came up at work,

746
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:26,140
so you want to drink.

747
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,140
No.

748
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,910
I might end up finishing
all the liquor at the bar...

749
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,440
and throw up again...

750
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:33,040
while being carried on his back.

751
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,380
"Again?"

752
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,750
It happened twice back in college.

753
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:38,110
I did it
when I broke up with my boyfriends.

754
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,150
Right.

755
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:43,490
You and Ji Hyuk
were like real siblings.

756
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,260
Should I send him an email?
That's it.

757
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,890
I can send an email.
Then, I don't have to see his face.

758
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,830

Ji Eun Oh!

765
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:35,140
Ji Eun Oh. Your email got hacked.

766
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,470
Someone sent me
something weird in your name.

767
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,210
No way.

768
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:46,450
Darn you.

769
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,080
You're out of your mind.

770
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,550
Do you sleepwalk?

771
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,920
What kind of
stupid nonsense is this?

772
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,860
Not via email. That's a bad idea.

773
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,900
Then don't tell him how you feel.

774
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:05,400
- Give up.
- What?

775
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:08,100
He never wants to marry.

776
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:09,640
Everyone knows that.

777
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:11,940
What would you do
if you asked him out...

778
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,410
and he said yes when you're 30?

779
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,610
Love. We'll just be in love.

780
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:18,710
You don't want to marry either?

781
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:21,980
Do you have to marry
if you're in love?

782
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,290
My gosh.

783
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:25,320
I thought your plan...

784
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,560
was to ask him out
and try to change his mind...

785
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,260
so he becomes pro-marriage.

786
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,090
No.

787
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:34,800
I want to let him know I like him...

788
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,000
and be there for him
as someone special.

(Radiant Homes)

791
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:01,320
No, Mother.

792
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:04,190
You can't do this.

793
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,260
Your legs hurt already.

794
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,660
You can't do chores.

795
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:08,960
I was extra careful.

796
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:10,700
Come with me.

797
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,400
- Come on.
- My gosh.

798
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,840
- I feel fine.
- Mother?

799
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,270
- Don't make a fuss.
- Sit over here.

800
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,080
You don't want to sprain your ankle.

801
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,710
You fell down the stairs
last year...

802
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,820
because a leg gave way.

803
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:30,820
Wait here while I hang
the rest of the washing.

804
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:34,420
I feel bad, that's why.

805
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:37,330
What?

806
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:38,930
My two hands.

807
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,300
I only use them to eat...

808
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,370
and wipe my bottom.

809
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:49,270
You help me trim
the bean sprouts sometimes.

810
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:51,570
That's a task you make for me.

811
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,940
These days, bean sprouts are
so clean that you just have to...

812
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,450
rinse them under running water.

813
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:04,390
You don't want to go
to the senior citizen center.

814
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:06,920
Do you want to go to church?

815
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,160
What would I do there?

816
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:14,660
Pray that I be taken away sooner?

817
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:17,300
Mother. That's not what I mean.

818
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,600
I won't pray for that. Don't worry.

819
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:23,340
I won't pray,

820
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:27,310
not to the Lord, not to Buddha.

821
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:28,710
I won't ask for anything.

822
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:31,980
Your father-in-law...

823
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,250
kept falling ill.

824
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,350
And he kept hurting himself.

825
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:39,420
I begged, pleaded,
and prayed for him...

826
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,920
to be taken away.

827
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,890
So that he'd stop giving you
and Sang Cheol a hard time.

828
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:47,260
I begged with all my might.

829
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:52,000
Mother.

830
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:54,040
Oh, boy. You saw the result of that.

831
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:56,340
My goodness.

832
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:58,840
He died...

833
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:01,540
only after his 90th birthday.

834
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,480
That old fool.

835
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:09,120
Goodness.
You're saying what you don't mean.

836
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:13,490
Your pillow...

837
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,790
was never dry after Father died.

838
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:26,770
Oh, dear.

839
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:28,900
- Hello.
- You're here already.

840
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,670
Yes. Hello, Mr. Kim.

841
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:31,670
Take a seat.

842
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,580
I'd been meaning...

843
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,910
to meet with you before you retired.

844
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:38,880
You were too busy.

845
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,120
Once my retirement was confirmed,

846
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,550
I had things to take care of...

847
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:45,420
- and appointments to keep.
- I see.

848
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:47,990
Oh, right.

849
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:52,490
When do you start
at Seongil Weaving?

850
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:55,930
Oh, well, about that.

851
00:44:57,330 --> 00:45:00,040
Someone sent Sang Cheol some fruit.

852
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:02,200
It was left by the door.

853
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:04,940
It must be a gift
to celebrate his retirement.

854
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:05,940
Yes.

855
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:09,380
I have to get that.

856
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:10,950
Can you see who it's from?

857
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:12,080
Okay.

858
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,820
Gosh, how pretty.

859
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:16,220
This is beautiful.

860
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,130
It's a box of apples.

861
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:30,630
What's this?

862
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:40,510
It's cash.

863
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:47,980
- Mother. Who is it from?
- Look at this, Da Jeong.

864
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:50,890
Isn't this money?

865
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:52,420
This cash...

866
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:55,890
What on earth...

867
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:08,140
(From Choi Sang Hui
and Choi Min Sik at Seongil Weaving)

868
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,220
I'm sorry, Mr. Lee.

869
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:30,030
We don't have a position...

870
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:31,990
for someone like you.

871
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,260
The economy's not as good.

872
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:38,530
When you said you got a position...

873
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:42,770
at Seongil Weaving,
I thought you'd really gotten lucky.

874
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:46,140
I got lucky?

875
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,980
It was luck?

876
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:52,150
Goodness.

877
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:14,070
Ji Hyuk had a lot of hobbies.

878
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:17,840
Will he take it all
when he moves out?

879
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:23,480
I might be able to film here.

880
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:31,020
I'm home!

881
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:36,960
Why are you out here?

882
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:39,490
My gosh.

883
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:43,300
What's this?

884
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:47,070
Well, honey...

885
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:51,410
I think Mr. Choi sent it.

886
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:53,380
Why did you accept it?

887
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:56,880
- Hello.
- Hi.

888
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:09,690
Can't you read?

889
00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:15,160
It says it's from Choi Sang Hui
and Choi Min Sik at Seongil Weaving!

890
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:17,170
And you opened it?

891
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,940
And you found
the envelope full of money?

892
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,640
You shouldn't have accepted it.

893
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,140
Even if you had,
you should've returned it.

894
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:26,170
You opened it!

895
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,080
Oh, no. What do we do?

896
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:32,110
What were you thinking?

897
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:33,980
You want to turn me into a fool...

898
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:35,380
who happily accepted
10,000 dollars...

899
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:37,320
instead of the advisor position?

900
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:39,760
What's in that head of yours?

901
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:42,690
I'm sorry.

902
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:45,790
I was expecting something,
and I thought it was mine.

903
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:47,800
I opened it without thinking.

904
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:54,240
I'm really sorry. I messed up.

905
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,840
Bring that inside
before the kids come home.

906
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,370
Pick up all the pieces of paper.

907
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:00,480
Okay.

908
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:02,210
Hurry up.

909
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:04,210
Get all the bits of paper.

910
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:20,700
Poor dad.

911
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:27,200
That's Ji Hyuk.

912
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:34,080
Ji Hyuk, did you hear all that?

913
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:37,050
Lower your voice. I heard them.

914
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:47,360
Was Dad's job offer
to be Seongil Weaving's advisor...

915
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,620
canceled?

916
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:51,190
It happens to a lot of people.

917
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:54,060
Poor Dad.

918
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:01,270
Let's not go in just yet.

919
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:16,490
Why was his job offer canceled?

920
00:50:16,490 --> 00:50:18,250
Can job offers be canceled
like this?

921
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:21,420
That's the way society works.

922
00:50:23,330 --> 00:50:24,790
Dad got lucky with his first offer.

923
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:27,160
Oh, no.

924
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:30,830
Should we cheer him up?

925
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:33,770
Didn't you hear
what he said just now?

926
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:36,710
Pretend not to know anything.

927
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:39,210
I'm sure he'll tell us eventually.

928
00:50:40,810 --> 00:50:43,280
Then, what will happen to Dad?

929
00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:45,510
Ji Hyuk,

930
00:50:45,850 --> 00:50:47,680
don't we have to pay
for living expenses now?

931
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:51,490
I'm sure Dad will find a way.

932
00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:54,860
But why he yelled at Mom
is beyond me.

934
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:03,130
Wait, hold on.
Did you sign a lease for your place?

935
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:06,570
Yes.

936
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:09,200
I guess today was D-Day for you.

937
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:12,210
Are you going to tell them
when we get home?

938
00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:15,040
How can I tell them
given the situation they're in?

939
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,210
Aren't you going to move out, then?

940
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:19,250
You already signed the lease
and should move out.

941
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:21,650
Who said I wasn't going to?

942
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:23,590
Today just isn't the right day
to tell them.

943
00:51:34,930 --> 00:51:36,030
Ji Hyuk,

944
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,670
I'm afraid you'll have to
move out of this room.

948
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,670
Dad, what do you mean
I need to move out of this room?

949
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:47,640
Mom?

950
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,480
Ji Hyuk, you see...

951
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:53,650
Your grandma and grandpa...

952
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:56,690
are moving in with us
from Tongyeong.

953
00:51:57,350 --> 00:51:59,590
Since your grandpa
has mobility issues,

954
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:01,260
he'll need to stay in this room.

955
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:02,990
You'll be staying
in Ji Wan's room upstairs.

956
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:04,530
What about Ji Wan, then?

957
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,760
The tenants living downstairs
are moving out.

958
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:08,830
He'll stay there.

959
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:12,430
Why do we have to live
with Grandma and Grandpa?

960
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:16,610
Your grandpa now needs
to see a doctor here in Seoul.

961
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,710
Then, what about my things?

962
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:25,310
I'm sorry, Ji Hyuk,

963
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,520
but these need to be removed...

964
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,880
to redo the walls.

965
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,650
Why are you apologizing?

966
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:33,490
There's no reason for us
to feel guilty about this.

967
00:52:33,490 --> 00:52:34,890

(Name: Lee Ji Hyuk)

969
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:10,960
Kids,

970
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,530
I was hired as an advisor
for Seongil Weaving.

971
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:15,630
Even before my retirement,

972
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:18,070
I was offered a job
as an advisor in the same field.

973
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:20,370
You want to turn me into a fool...

974
00:53:20,370 --> 00:53:21,540
who happily accepted
10,000 dollars...

975
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:23,710
instead of the advisor position?

976
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:29,810
I knew our family...

977
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:32,480
couldn't be this lucky.

978
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,820
A family that always lets me down.

979
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:03,610
I'm sorry for calling so late.

980
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:07,720
I won't be able to move
into that unit.

981
00:54:09,050 --> 00:54:10,120
The deal's off.

982
00:54:10,990 --> 00:54:12,350
How so?

983
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,160
You'd lose
your 3,000-dollar down payment.

984
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,030
I know.

985
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:21,630
Text me your bank account number,

986
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:23,200
and I'll wire your commission.

987
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:25,900
Sure.

988
00:54:48,990 --> 00:54:49,990
Ji Wan.

989
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:51,590
Hey, baby.

990
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:57,070
What's with the suit?
Is this a special occasion?

991
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:03,970
Hop in.

992
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:11,780
You said I needed an apartment...

993
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:14,180
with at least two rooms
for you to marry me.

994
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:19,490
Yes, and it has to be in Seoul.

995
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:21,720
In Seoul, of course.

996
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:23,560
That's why I told you to save up.

997
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:25,330
Until then, we'll stick to dating.

998
00:55:25,330 --> 00:55:28,060
That's what you said
when I proposed a year ago.

999
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:30,370
I told you not to bring it up
until you were ready.

1000
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:32,670
Actually, my situation has changed.

1001
00:55:33,170 --> 00:55:35,900
Hong Mi, you now have three options.

1002
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:38,410
- Three?
- A.

1003
00:55:38,410 --> 00:55:39,940
Move into the second floor
of my parents' house.

1004
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:41,410
It has two rooms,

1005
00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:42,980
and we'll use both.

1006
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:44,680
It'll be like living
in a separate house.

1007
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:46,050
Once Ji Hyuk moves out,

1008
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:48,350
Su Bin can move
into my current room.

1009
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:49,550
B.

1010
00:55:49,550 --> 00:55:51,550
I'll use what my dad owes me
to rent a studio,

1011
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:53,520
borrow the money they saved
for my brother's wedding,

1012
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:54,990
and open a gym of my own.

1013
00:55:54,990 --> 00:55:57,260
I'll become a businessman.

1014
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:58,460
C.

1015
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:00,160
I'll take the money
for my brother's wedding...

1016
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,630
and rent a unit with two rooms.

1017
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:08,840
I know...

1018
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:12,410
that all three options
don't fully meet your standards.

1019
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:16,080
But I can give you more love...

1020
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:18,880
than anyone else...

1021
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,280
ever could.

1022
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:24,650
Got it.

1023
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:28,490
Which will you choose?

1024
00:56:28,490 --> 00:56:30,060
I'll have an answer
by the next date.

1025
00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:31,860
Really?

1026
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:32,930
Yes.

1027
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,200
Let's now order dessert.

1028
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,300
I want truffle vanilla ice cream.

1029
00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:40,770
Excuse me. Can we both get...

1030
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:42,240
truffle vanilla ice cream?

1031
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:43,340
Sure.

1032
00:56:51,350 --> 00:56:52,580
(I'm always watching.)

1033
00:56:54,650 --> 00:56:55,880
(I'm always watching.)

1034
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:27,050
(Mom)

1035
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:31,050
Are you on your way home?

1036
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:33,760
Mom...

1037
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:37,490
Someone's outside.

1038
00:57:37,790 --> 00:57:39,890
What do I do? Oh, no.

1039
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:41,700
What do I do?

1040
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:43,100
Stay calm.

1041
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:44,830
I'll send Mr. Jung,

1042
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:45,970
so let him escort you out.

1043
00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:46,970
All right.

1044
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:56,140
He leaves his car at home
on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

1045
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:26,270
(Hoeyeon-dong, Hoeyeon Terminal)

1046
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:31,470

(No. 878 to Hoeyeon-dong)

1048
01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:27,230
Oh, my gosh.

1049
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:28,860
Ji Eun Oh.

1050
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:30,630
What are you up to?

1051
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:32,030
What?

1052
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:34,570
What a coincidence...

1053
01:00:35,670 --> 01:00:38,410
Actually, that's a weird thing
to say right now.

1054
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:40,840
Yes. It's very weird.

1055
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:45,680
You've been
to my neighborhood often.

1056
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:48,920
Yes, right. I have.

1057
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:52,190
I was here a few times before.

1058
01:00:53,590 --> 01:00:54,690
Is something wrong?

1059
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:56,690
What do you mean?

1060
01:00:57,730 --> 01:00:58,860
Nothing's wrong,

1061
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:00,960
and you followed me?

1062
01:01:02,130 --> 01:01:03,230
Why would I?

1063
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:07,170
I have something to say.

1064
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,240
What's that?

1065
01:01:12,970 --> 01:01:15,910
I heard you broke up
with your girlfriend.

1066
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:21,480
How...

1067
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:23,680
do you know that?

1068
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:28,320
You wouldn't have a new one yet.

1069
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:30,430
Since it hasn't been that long.

1070
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:33,590
- Ji Eun Oh.
- What I'm about to say.

1071
01:01:35,130 --> 01:01:37,870
I need you to listen
with 100 percent seriousness.

1072
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:40,740
Ji Hyuk.

1073
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:44,040
You should date me now.

1074
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:46,870
Hey. Don't crack any jokes.

1075
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:49,410
I'm not joking.

1076
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:52,510
I'm asking you to date me,
not marry me.

1077
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:54,750
Who would believe someone
who says this in the street?

1078
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:00,420
Let's go. I'll get you a taxi.

1079
01:02:01,890 --> 01:02:02,960
Ji Hyuk.

1080
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,030
You knew.

1081
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:07,630
That I have a crush on you.

1082
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:10,800
I knew it.

1083
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:13,900
I had a feeling you knew.

1084
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:19,040
What kind of nonsense is this?

1085
01:02:19,410 --> 01:02:20,410
What do you know?

1086
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:23,810
This is really frustrating
and completely baffling.

1087
01:02:23,850 --> 01:02:25,180
I'm astonished.

1088
01:02:28,050 --> 01:02:30,180
Did someone invent liquor
that doesn't smell?

1089
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:33,490
You're talking a lot.
That's not like you.

1090
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:35,860
I'm about to get angry.

1091
01:02:37,790 --> 01:02:38,860
I have feelings for you.

1092
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:44,100
- You really...
- I really do.

1093
01:02:50,610 --> 01:02:51,610
Follow me.

1094
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:14,960
Listen carefully.

1095
01:03:15,430 --> 01:03:16,630
I won't say this again.

1096
01:03:17,470 --> 01:03:19,670
I liked you and waited for you
for a long time.

1097
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:21,370
You need to give me a chance.

1098
01:03:21,370 --> 01:03:23,400
No. I'll pretend I didn't hear this.

1099
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:25,570
I'm rejecting you.

1100
01:03:25,870 --> 01:03:28,880
But you're not allowed
to treat me any differently.

1101
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:30,780
Why are you rejecting me...

1102
01:03:31,010 --> 01:03:32,780
before you even give me a chance?

1103
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,050
That's not like you.

1104
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:37,150
You dated anyone
from our club who asked you out.

1105
01:03:37,790 --> 01:03:39,090
I didn't date everyone.

1106
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:41,390
I only dated people
who were good enough.

1107
01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:44,160
Why won't you date me?

1108
01:03:45,130 --> 01:03:46,690
Do I need to give a reason...

1109
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:48,400
to reject a woman?

1110
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:51,070
Since when
did you consider me a woman?

1111
01:03:51,070 --> 01:03:53,530
Exactly. I don't see you as a woman.

1112
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:58,810
That was too obvious a reaction.

1113
01:03:59,470 --> 01:04:01,680
You might see me as a woman
if you start dating me.

1114
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:04,080
Why would I date someone
who isn't a woman to me?

1115
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:06,450
Because I'm Ji Eun Oh.

1116
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,280
What?

1117
01:04:08,450 --> 01:04:09,580
I'm not...

1118
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:12,990
just any woman. I'm Ji Eun Oh.

1119
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:17,590
I know I'm not someone
you can just push aside.

1120
01:04:19,630 --> 01:04:21,260
"You were just a junior to me."

1121
01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:22,630
"I never considered you a woman."

1122
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:23,930
"I get bored easily."

1123
01:04:23,930 --> 01:04:26,200
"I don't want to ruin our friendship
with a relationship."

1124
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:29,100
None of that works with me.

1125
01:04:31,470 --> 01:04:32,970
You're smart when I least expect it.

1126
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:36,040
If you don't want
to give me a chance,

1127
01:04:36,910 --> 01:04:38,810
if you won't even give us a go,

1128
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:42,380
persuade me.

1129
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:49,360
You don't date your girlfriends
because you're in love.

1130
01:04:49,990 --> 01:04:52,090
You dated people
you shared interests with.

1131
01:04:52,190 --> 01:04:53,760
I know that much.

1132
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:57,160
- Eun Oh.
- The woman you liked the most...

1133
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:59,270
was Eun Ju whom you broke up with
in junior year.

1134
01:05:01,970 --> 01:05:05,370
You didn't know
I knew so much about you, did you?

1135
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:13,050
Eun Oh.
What you're doing right now...

1136
01:05:13,550 --> 01:05:15,980
and these feelings.
They aren't real.

1137
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:18,250
Don't scare me by being so serious.

1138
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:21,390
I know my feelings.

1139
01:05:21,390 --> 01:05:23,360
Wouldn't I know my feelings, then?

1140
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:24,460
Am I really...

1141
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:30,160
not even worth considering
as a girlfriend?

1142
01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:34,170
I know you want to date
but never marry.

1143
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:37,640
Is there no room for me?

1144
01:05:37,970 --> 01:05:39,370
Bingo. There isn't.

1145
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:41,280
Don't go too far.

1146
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:45,680
- What?
- Unless you want to lose me,

1147
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,010
stop being so flippant.

1148
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:50,550
Don't treat it like a joke.
Show some guilt.

1149
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:06,530
I'm sorry.

1150
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:14,040
No.

1151
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:16,740
Don't apologize.

1152
01:06:18,010 --> 01:06:19,080
Because then...

1153
01:06:19,710 --> 01:06:22,080
I have to accept your rejection.

1154
01:06:24,020 --> 01:06:25,050
Eun Oh.

1155
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:27,290
You can't be...

1156
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:29,790
stubborn about stuff like this.

1157
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:32,890
I'm not being stubborn.
I don't get it.

1158
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:43,240
Okay.

1159
01:06:45,970 --> 01:06:47,070
Then...

1160
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:51,310
I'll give you the real reason.

1161
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:55,680
You...

1162
01:06:58,920 --> 01:06:59,990
don't suit me.

1163
01:07:05,830 --> 01:07:07,130
What?

1164
01:07:07,430 --> 01:07:08,500
We're not a good match.

1165
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:10,660
You and I.

1166
01:07:13,270 --> 01:07:14,340
I don't get...

1167
01:07:15,140 --> 01:07:16,640
What does that mean?

1168
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:18,870
I was nice to you
because you lived and worked hard.

1169
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:21,740
Remember your place.

1170
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:24,110
Stay away.

1171
01:07:26,110 --> 01:07:27,950
I don't suit you?

1172
01:07:28,250 --> 01:07:30,250
I don't have to
give someone a chance...

1173
01:07:31,790 --> 01:07:33,390
if I don't think they suit me.

1174
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:36,020
Do I, Eun Oh?

1175
01:08:29,210 --> 01:08:32,110
(Our Golden Days)

1176
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:33,980
You're so cruel.

1177
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:35,850
Don't you see Eun Oh's struggling?

1178
01:08:36,050 --> 01:08:37,250
You told Eun Oh, didn't you?

1179
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:38,620
You have a crush on her!

1180
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:40,720
You took away my chance
to even ask her out.

1181
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:41,720
Eun Oh.

1182
01:08:42,390 --> 01:08:43,620
You knew?

1183
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:44,730
I'll give it back.

1184
01:08:44,860 --> 01:08:46,160
Don't take this with you.

1185
01:08:46,530 --> 01:08:47,600
Lee Ji Hyuk!

1186
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:49,660
You'll leave
without handing over your duties?

1187
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:50,700
That's not right!

1188
01:08:51,030 --> 01:08:53,700
Even if you leave,
it will go to another company.

1189
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:55,900
Did you quit with a plan in mind?

1190
01:08:56,070 --> 01:08:58,040
There's no reason
you can't marry without love.

1191
01:08:58,470 --> 01:08:59,510
Lee Ji Hyuk.
