(Episode 22)

2
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,300
Let me go. Please let me out.

3
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,120
Ji Wan.

4
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,430
You jerk...

5
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:57,630
No!

6
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:21,660
So it was you?

7
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:28,100
Yeong Ra, there's a rope over there. Give it to me.

8
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,080
Ji Wan, where were you?

9
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,310
I was terrified.

10
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,650
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,810
You're not hurt, are you?

12
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:56,830
(Seong Jae)

13
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,400
All she cares about is her art.

14
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,430
Please excuse me for a moment.

15
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,540
- Sure. - Ji Wan.

16
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,570
- Mom. - Yes?

17
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,640
(Police Station)

18
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,780
My goodness, that was a close call.

19
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:24,750
From when he dragged Yeong Ra out to when he put her in the car,

20
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,260
I was recording the whole thing.

21
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,630
You can tell us the rest while we take your statement.

22
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:32,330
I'm Mr. Yang Ji Il's lawyer.

23
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,100
That must be him.

24
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,510
- Let's go. - His lawyer is here already?

25
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:47,010
Yes, I see that.

26
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,220
Yeong Ra, are you hurt?

27
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,320
We need to get you to a hospital. You must have passed out.

28
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,890
No, I'm okay now, Mom.

29
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:09,230
What were you doing? How could you let him harm Yeong Ra?

30
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,500
Ji Wan knew what he was doing.

31
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,610
Seeing that guy hanging around Yeong Ra,

32
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,280
I was sure he'd come to the exhibition too.

33
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,580
So I paid extra attention to the younger men, but then...

34
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,490
Then I smelled a familiar cologne.

35
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,729
I smelled the same scent...

36
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:39,830
when I opened the "500th day" anniversary box he sent.

37
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:44,200
It's called Ferrederick. I've used it myself.

38
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:47,600
I had a bad feeling, so I went to look for him,

39
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,840
but I'd never actually seen his face.

40
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,540
But then,

41
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,110
There was a strange guy there.

42
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,950
He was lurking, his hat pulled down.

43
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:04,190
That's when it clicked. They were in on it together.

44
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,290
Hey, you!

45
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:09,730
Hey! Stop right there!

46
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,090
I faked a chase, then turned back.

47
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,659
Then I started checking the cars in the parking lot...

48
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,930
that could pull out easily.

49
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,070
(32H 9702)

50
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,070
He'd rented it on purpose,

51
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,070
and I could see rope, duct tape, and scissors inside.

52
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:26,710
I thought, "It must be this car."

53
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,280
So I was trying to figure out what to do...

54
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,910
when I saw Yeong Ra coming out.

55
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:35,420
So to catch him red-handed, I hid and used my phone...

56
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,720
- to start recording. - Red-handed?

57
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:42,560
Yes. If not, he would've just kept trying.

58
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,290
The tools for the crime were already in the car,

59
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,630
and I figured I had to wait until he got Yeong Ra in the car...

60
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,770
for it to count as kidnapping in the act...

61
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,470
Oh, my.

62
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:57,370
I didn't have time to run my plan by any of you.

63
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:00,740
I apologise.

64
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,680
You came up with all that in that split second?

65
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,020
He's right.

66
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,219
If he'd caught him dragging her out,

67
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,050
he'd have just made an excuse.

68
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,260
I see now.

69
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,090
Thank you.

70
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:21,300
I'll stay here. You two should head back to the gallery.

71
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,360
Yes.

72
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,130
We did leave in such a hurry.

73
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,270
We need to go clean up the mess.

74
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,870
But it worries me that his lawyer showed up way too fast.

75
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,180
I'll look into it while they give their statements.

76
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:38,950
Good.

77
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,859
Everyone thinks Ms. Park has a lover...

78
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,560
and that it was some messy love affair.

79
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,700
A messy love affair?

80
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,499
He dragged her out by the waist.

81
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,100
So, everyone's saying, "It's always the quiet ones..."

82
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:02,740
"you have to watch out for."

83
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,180
How am I going to set this straight?

84
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:23,960
Man, I'm exhausted.

85
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,940
Hey, Seong Jae. How's Yeong Ra?

86
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,910
She's in bed now.

87
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:39,610
You really saved the day.

88
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,650
Come on, I'm her bodyguard.

89
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,120
Right. Yeong Ra's going to rest at home through tomorrow,

90
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,320
- so you get some rest too. - Okay, got it.

91
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,960
I wonder if Yeong Ra will keep going to her studio.

92
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:57,960
Mogwang Group?

93
00:06:58,690 --> 00:06:59,700
Yes.

94
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,930
His name is Yang Ji Il, age 28. Said to be Mogwang's youngest son.

95
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,900
And he claims he's had a crush on Yeong Ra.

96
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:11,440
But the Mogwang family has 1 son, and he is in his late 40s.

97
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:15,010
I'd heard rumours that Chairman Yang had a secret son.

98
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,850
Oh, my.

99
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,720
So that's why his lawyer showed up so fast.

100
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,290
That punk.

101
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:27,820
He ruined my daughter's reputation, and his first thought is a lawyer?

102
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,730
What do you mean, ruined?

103
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,830
Our Yeong Ra has been dragged into a scandal.

104
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,200
Such a sweet, respectable girl like her.

105
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,370
This could affect the calibre of men she can marry in the future.

106
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,040
We're in big trouble if these rumours spread.

107
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,110
Hello, there.

108
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,380
Everyone's here.

109
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:57,120
Mr. Lee. You never fail to impress.

110
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,120
Your business has expanded so much already.

111
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,260
Things just worked out that way.

112
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:06,400
Hey, didn't I tell you to use the better insulation here?

113
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,370
And I told you this should be more than enough.

114
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,370
No, it used to be a storeroom.

115
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,100
It got cold in here at night, even in the spring.

116
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,110
Just drop it. It's my space anyway,

117
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:19,040
and I'm the one paying for the construction.

118
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,910
Why would you pay for it? It was all on the same estimate.

119
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:25,950
That was to account for cost changes during construction.

120
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,290
I'm tracking the exact labour and material costs as we go,

121
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,820
so I can take my space off the final invoice.

122
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:36,190
- But it's our turnkey team... - Which can be split up at any time!

123
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,030
Okay, fine.

124
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:43,430
I got the list of turnkey projects from Mr. Jo,

125
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,870
but why did I only get 6? The website listed 15.

126
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:50,170
Are you trying to work yourself to death?

127
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:54,240
From now on, I'll check the turnkey inquiries first.

128
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,950
Didn't you read the contract? It says we vet the projects...

129
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,350
before handing them over to you.

130
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:04,520
Let's revisit that part of the contract in three months.

131
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:08,120
Does that mean you're renewing our partnership agreement?

132
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:15,130
Stop playing games and go get ready. Isn't your investor meeting today?

133
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:18,530
All right. I just finished up, so I was about to go.

134
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,770
Do a good job.

135
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:22,870
What'd you say?

136
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,010
I said, do a good job.

137
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,780
Right, got it. I'll do my best.

138
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,090
No one's home?

139
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:41,160
Where did Mom and Grandma go?

140
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,690
I was hoping for a home-cooked meal from Mom for once.

141
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:52,940
Hello?

142
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,400
Mr. Lee. It's Yeong Ra's father.

143
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,340
Yes, sir.

144
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,380
The first solo exhibition of up-and-coming artist, Ms. Park,

145
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,750
was marred by a shocking incident.

146
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,779
A stalker of over six months...

147
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,849
dragged the artist out and attempted to abduct her...

148
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,290
before being subdued and arrested by the police.

149
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,019
The police say the suspect is Mr. Yang,

150
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,830
a third-generation heir to a major national conglomerate.

151
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,189
Yang threatened her with a weapon inside the gallery,

152
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,860
holding it to her waist while pretending to be her lover...

153
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,400
- as he dragged her out. - That's enough.

Yes, Ms. Jung.

An article?

I see.

166

We've had trouble with that stalker for over six months.

I'm so relieved the misunderstanding has been cleared up.

00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,390
(CEO Park Jin Seok)

180
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,960
Honey, have you seen it already?

181
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,090
What?

182
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:58,560
See what?

183
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:02,030
Honey, there's an article about yesterday's incident.

184
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,730
Ms. Jung just called and told me.

185
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,910
The misunderstanding about Yeong Ra having a lover is now cleared up.

186
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,040
Well, that's good.

187
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,940
But what's wrong with your voice?

188
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,150
I'll tell you at dinner.

189
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,720
I invited Ji Wan over for dinner. At 7pm.

190
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,550
You're having him over for dinner tonight?

191
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:28,160
I know we're grateful, but still...

192
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,030
I already invited him.

193
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,230
All right. I'll get dinner ready.

194
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,630
Okay.

195
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:39,430
My gosh...

196
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,240
What's going on?

197
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,380
Eun Oh! Ji Eun Oh!

198
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,330
- What is it? - I did great.

199
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:05,530
Great at what?

200
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,530
Hey, you told me to do well. I nailed the investment meeting.

201
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,600
Oh, that...

202
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:14,540
Is that all you came here to tell me?

203
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,310
No.

204
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:20,180
I came to check on the construction.

205
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:21,940
Right.

206
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,180
Then go ahead and look around.

207
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,460
Hey.

208
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,700
Let me get past you.

209
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,500
Sure.

210
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,430
I have to get to the office...

211
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,630
I forgot. Never mind.

212
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,040
Bye, I'm off.

213
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,980
Hey, did it go well?

214
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,120
- Yes. - Good.

215
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,420
Yes.

216
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,300
Oh, so that's what this is about.

217
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,510
Ten thousand dollars?

218
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,640
Why would my dad send me money?

219
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:10,490
He really shouldn't have. This is so awkward.

220
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,530
Join us for dinner at my house tonight.

221
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,800
Be at my house by 7pm.

222
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,370
Why on earth would he invite me to his house?

223
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,040
Is it because he's grateful for what I did yesterday?

224
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:32,370
No, that can't be it.

225
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,280
Now that the threat is gone...

226
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:39,210
Is this the end?

227
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,090
I guess he's firing me.

228
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,360
I wasn't sure what you'd like, so...

229
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,960
And Yeong Ra didn't know either.

230
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,290
I'm not a picky eater.

231
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,460
Everything looks delicious.

232
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:56,530
Ji Wan.

233
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:01,300
If you weren't guarding Yeong Ra, what were you planning to do?

234
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:05,570
I heard you quit the fitness center and were taking some time off.

235
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:10,310
Oh, I was going to work at the in-house fitness center.

236
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,750
Is that so?

237
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:16,590
How about you put that on hold and continue to help Yeong Ra?

238
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,730
Honey.

239
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:27,200
I'll hire you directly, provide full benefits,

240
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,400
and even give you a 50 percent raise.

241
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:30,830
Excuse me?

242
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,240
That stalker was released early this morning.

243
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:37,140
- He's been released pending trial. - Wait, what are you talking about?

244
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,610
But he tried to kidnap her twice.

245
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:44,580
Our lawyers said he would be tried and serve time for sure.

246
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:50,520
For the incident at her school, there's no proof it was Yang Ji Il.

247
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,360
He was wearing a helmet, so his face wasn't caught on the CCTV.

248
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,090
It was him, Dad.

249
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:00,100
But you're the only one who saw him.

250
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:04,130
As for yesterday, we have the video from Ji Wan's phone,

251
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:06,939
and since we caught him at the scene,

252
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,040
he can't deny that one.

253
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,609
They argue he's not a flight risk,

254
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:13,280
and he's claiming diminished capacity.

255
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,910
That's how they got him released without detention.

256
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,310
So Mogwang Group must have pulled some strings.

257
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,920
So what about us?

258
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,520
Are we just going to let this happen?

259
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,020
It'll be hard to get him re-arrested.

260
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,560
Still, they can't stop him from getting prison time.

261
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,290
And I won't let it go, even after the trial.

262
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:36,160
He's not getting off with probation for these charges.

263
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:37,830
Then what about Yeong Ra?

264
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:41,070
She'll have to live in fear until the trial is over.

265
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,940
That's exactly why I'm asking you.

266
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:47,580
Yeong Ra needs protection until that guy is behind bars.

267
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,410
I understand.

268
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,420
But just so you know, it could drag on for a while.

269
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,320
So think it over carefully.

270
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:13,470
If you're hiring me as a chauffeur, I'll have to decline.

271
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,140
But if it's as a bodyguard, I accept.

272
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,910
Of course. That's the main role.

273
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,810
If you don't want to drive, I'll hire a separate chauffeur.

274
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:26,050
No, I can provide better protection if I'm the one driving.

275
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,120
All right.

276
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,390
This is...

277
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,990
a token of our gratitude for yesterday.

278
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,740
I really thought I was getting fired.

279
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,810
I wasn't expecting this.

280
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,780
Why am I in such a good mood?

281
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:13,430
Hello?

282
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,100
Is this Park Yeong Ra's phone?

283
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,800
This is Lee Sang Hoon. We met at the gallery yesterday.

284
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,100
Pardon?

285
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,940
Right, hello.

286
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:27,640
He wants to see you?

287
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,440
Yes.

288
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:32,010
I told him I'd check my schedule and get back to him.

289
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,250
I knew there was something about the way he looked at you yesterday.

290
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,520
He's quicker than I expected.

291
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,820
But then again,

292
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,390
there were a few others who seemed quite taken with you.

293
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:45,960
So should I wait for the others?

294
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,830
No, you should meet him.

295
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,030
Lee Sang Hoon is the second son of the Jinhwa Group family.

296
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:56,370
They own Jinhwa Pharmaceuticals, and he's the VP of Human Deep Bio.

297
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,240
He'll probably be president in a few years.

298
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,780
Honey, you sent me 2,000 dollars. What's it for?

299
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,480
That's the money I saved up from my part-time job.

300
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,980
But why are you giving it to me?

301
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,650
Who else would I give it to?

302
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,590
And you don't have to send me an allowance anymore.

303
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:16,020
I won't need tuition money either. I'll keep working my part-time job,

304
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,830
so I can pay my own way.

305
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,169
I just registered for the practical exam.

306
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:26,600
It's in November.

307
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,700
He sounds so confident he's going to pass.

308
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,640
I'll pass it, no matter what.

309
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,540
You're working so hard.

310
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,110
Never mind.

311
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:41,080
You're Lee Sang Cheol, so you can do this.

312
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,490
And don't worry even if you fail the exam.

313
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:47,620
There's no rule that says only you can get a part-time job, right?

314
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:50,460
Listen to you, talking nonsense.

315
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:53,660
After all the trouble with my father after Ji Hyuk was born,

316
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:58,470
you think I'd make you work now? There's no way I'd ever do that.

317
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,040
By the way, I sent the money to Ji Hyuk.

318
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,340
Under your name.

319
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:08,010
Why would you send it in my name? You think he'd take money from me?

320
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,950
And do you think he'd believe that I had that much money to send him?

321
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:15,120
Besides, it carries more weight coming from you.

322
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:19,450
Mom! Dad! Grandma!

323
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:23,360
Goodness, what's all that racket? What's going on?

324
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:27,260
Ta-da! This is a gift for my worn-out dad.

325
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:30,470
- I got this for you. - What? What's the occasion?

326
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,869
You need to take care of your health.

327
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:35,300
And you ladies are hard to shop for,

328
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,310
so I got you cash. Here, this is for you, Mom.

329
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:42,710
- And Grandma. - Oh, my. What's gotten into you?

330
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,150
I'm an official bodyguard now.

331
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,620
I'm getting full benefits and a 50 percent raise.

332
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,650
Hey, hold on. What are you talking about?

333
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,690
Here, Dad.

334
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:54,760
Go on, try it.

335
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,490
- Here. - Okay.

336
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:01,860
Wow, would you look at this? Our youngest got this for my health.

337
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:07,740
You were jealous Ji Hyuk gave gifts for me and his grandmother.

338
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,370
Hey, this is pretty good.

339
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,080
They're easy to take, so grab one whenever you go out, Dad.

340
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:20,150
But Ji Wan, isn't it a long time until the trial?

341
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:21,920
Will this really help your career?

342
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:26,320
After the trial, I'll be in charge of the employee gym.

343
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,920
As a full-time employee, no less.

344
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:33,060
I thought he was just goofing off, but he's actually been doing great.

345
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:36,260
Our Ji Wan sure got lucky. All thanks to Seong Jae.

346
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:38,770
Come on, it wasn't because of Seong Jae.

347
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:41,340
Do you have any idea what the people who run that company are like?

348
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:44,440
You think they'd reward him so well just for catching a stalker?

349
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:50,410
He laid a trap to catch the stalker, to catch him in the act.

350
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:55,480
That's what they recognised. He went above and beyond.

351
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:57,190
That's right, Dad.

352
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:58,790
See?

(Gaon Foundation)

354
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,830
I'm meeting Lee Sang Hoon the day after tomorrow.

355
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,170
Yeong Ra is one thing,

356
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:18,570
but I need to deal with Woo Jin.

357
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:21,280
Can I really get a liver transplant?

358
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:24,850
When?

359
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:28,480
Ji Eun Oh is a suitable match for the liver transplant.

360
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,520
That is, if Ji Eun Oh gives her consent.

361
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:42,530
You...

362
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:45,170
What am I going to do with you?

363
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,870
Han Yu Ra.

364
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,080
Patrol's clear.

365
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,750
So what did you bring me today?

366
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:09,760
How far did you get on your webtoon? You made a lot of progress.

367
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,160
I pulled an all-nighter.

368
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:14,130
- Aren't you sleepy? - Not yet.

369
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,700
I plan to finish drawing everything I've plotted before I leave today.

370
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:21,870
I had an idea while I was on patrol. What if Dokgo Chan and Ko So Ri...

371
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:24,670
had a run-in before the zombie incident?

372
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:27,310
They bumped into each other while cooking ramyeon by the Han River.

373
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,040
Ramyeon by the Han River?

374
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:33,620
I've seen people do that,

375
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,050
but I don't really know what it's all about.

376
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:40,190
Do you want to go check it out for research? To the Han River?

377
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:43,090
What? Yes! Let's do it! I'd love that!

378
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,360
But you have to be at the gallery tomorrow,

379
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:48,730
so let's go the day after tomorrow.

380
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,870
I have plans the day after tomorrow.

381
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,300
You do? Who are you meeting?

382
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:59,810
Someone from my show contacted me, and my mom wants me to meet him.

383
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:03,280
And you? I guess you're interested in him too.

384
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:09,050
He made a good impression, and he exceeds my mom's standards.

385
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:13,620
What if you meet him, he proposes, and your mom tells you to marry him?

386
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:14,820
Would you actually get married?

387
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:16,890
I guess I'd have to, right?

388
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:21,600
For all the spinning the world does, you always end up in the same spot.

(Title: Chicory and Siler Flowers Under the Plum Tree)

391
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,490
These are great.

392
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:53,360
Hey, Yeong Ra. I haven't seen these two before.

393
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:54,430
When did you paint them?

394
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:57,130
Those?

395
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:02,770
Those are some of my earliest works I had tucked away.

396
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:04,770
Ms. Jang is my assistant.

397
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,140
All artists have assistants.

398
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:15,150
So that's how she became an artist. That's what it took to become one.

399
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,750
What do you mean?

400
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,220
It's nothing. Never mind.

401
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:34,870
We can expand this and put the conference table here.

402
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,210
We'll use it as a meeting room, but when it's free,

403
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:40,009
the staff can use it as a workspace and meet with clients here too.

404
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:41,910
The multi-use plan should work, right?

405
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,280
For quiet meetings, we can use the turnkey team's conference room.

406
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:46,280
My office gets bigger too. I like it.

407
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:47,650
It was a great idea.

408
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:55,690
Ms. Yang, what brings you here?

409
00:26:55,890 --> 00:27:00,700
I'm on the Sinchon-dong project, and I went to meet Mr. Jo,

410
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,260
but then I heard you were here on site.

411
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:06,600
And?

412
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:10,300
Since this will be the new office, I'll be coming and going a lot,

413
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,110
so I came to have a look around.

414
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:18,150
I know that look in her eyes.

415
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:20,780
Is that really what you wear to a business meeting?

416
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:29,060
This is our new designer. And this is Ms. Ji Eun Oh.

417
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,730
You heard we've got a turnkey team lead, right?

418
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,760
I'm Ji Eun Oh.

419
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:38,170
I'm Yang So Mi.

420
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,670
Right.

421
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,740
Time to prepare lunch.

422
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:47,140
- Prepare lunch. - Just a second.

423
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:51,180
- Time to prepare... - Oh, it really is almost lunchtime.

424
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,820
Why don't you have lunch with me? It's my treat.

425
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:58,350
I'm having lunch with Ms. Ji Eun Oh.

426
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:02,719
Then Ms. Ji can come too. I can treat you both.

427
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,930
Ms. Ji isn't comfortable being treated by just anyone.

428
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,600
Watch your step on your way out.

429
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,040
Goodbye, then.

430
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:27,850
She's clearly interested in you. Why were you so harsh?

431
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:33,090
As I recall, she used to be exactly your type.

432
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,520
Not anymore.

433
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,560
Why not?

434
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,260
Because now...

435
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,200
I like you.

436
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,540
Eun Oh, I like you so much.

437
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:50,100
So much.

438
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,580
You're serious?

439
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,610
Ji Hyuk?

440
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,880
What?

441
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,490
Oh, well...

442
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,220
Eun Oh.

443
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:12,290
I'm going to try and win her over. At the company,

444
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,599
I'm going to make myself completely indispensable.

445
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,900
And then,

446
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,130
I'm going to tell Eun Oh how I feel.

447
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,500
Lee Ji Hyuk, you crazy fool.

448
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:26,540
What did you say?

449
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:28,410
What?

450
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,210
It's nothing.

451
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:32,410
Let's go grab lunch.

452
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:38,750
I have to eat with the carpenters. I promised I'd buy.

453
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,020
Then what about me?

454
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,960
Thanks.

455
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,970
- Enjoy your meal! - Enjoy your meal!

456
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,370

Yes, Director Ko.

459
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,850
Oh, dear. I misdialled.

460
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,190
Sorry about that.

461
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,090
No problem.

462
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,660
I'll let you get back to work.

463
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,730
Actually, wait.

464
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:20,490
Since I have you on the phone, I might as well tell you now.

465
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,260
It's about the leak.

466
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:26,130
Okay. I was actually wondering about that.

467
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,600
We had the building inspected for the leak,

468
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:32,110
and it looks like we'll need to do some major work.

469
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:35,710
So our schedule might get pushed back.

470
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:37,810
I see.

471
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,450

00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,320
You don't sound so good.

473

It's nothing.

474
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,520
I'll let you go.

475
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:53,290

Yes, I do. Why?

I'm calling from a bar called Icarus in Cheongmyeong-dong.

We think you need to come and pick her up.

00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:45,570
Yes.

532
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:48,600
I think you should go home and get some rest.

533
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:52,510
Rest?

534
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:54,880
Me?

535
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:56,980
Me?

536
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:02,550
When I don't even know where she's lying,

537
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:06,290
you expect me to go lie down in a warm bed?

538
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:11,290
I...

539
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,330
I lost a daughter.

540
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,160
No one knows about her.

541
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:18,730
No one but me.

542
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:23,540
I don't even know what cold ground that poor child is lying in,

543
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:27,140
or where she even died.

544
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:32,710
"Died?" What do you mean?

545
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:37,250
No, maybe she's not dead.

546
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,550
Maybe someone took her.

547
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:42,090
No...

548
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,260
She's dead.

549
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,400
The neighbour she was with and her daughter died in it too.

550
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,500
So how could she have survived that fire?

551
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,470
Director Ko.

552
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,510
I had just given birth to twins.

553
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:06,410
On the way to their first birthday, my husband died in a hit-and-run.

554
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,320
Overnight, I was thrown out on the street.

555
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,720
I had to leave one of my twins with my neighbour...

556
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:17,930
and carried the other on my back while I sold insurance door-to-door.

557
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:22,830
A fire broke out at the Busan Market where she'd taken my daughter.

558
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,399
The fire spread to the next building,

559
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,740
which also collapsed.

560
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:33,810
They never even found her body.

561
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,680
And just like that, she was gone.

562
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:40,450
My poor baby.

563
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:41,750
It was so tragic.

564
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:51,490
But you know, Eun Oh...

565
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,160
Do you have any idea how shameless I am?

566
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,670
I got married again, just to save myself.

567
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:06,340
My husband doesn't even know I had a daughter.

568
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,540
I never told him.

569
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:15,980
It wasn't because I was afraid of losing him.

570
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:21,460
To even say her name felt like it would tear my mouth apart,

571
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:25,890
but keeping it inside felt like my heart would tear in two.

572
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,360
As I went on with my life,

573
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,700
I swore I would never speak of her again.

574
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:36,070
I swore I wouldn't even think of her.

575
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:41,740
But today... I saw her.

576
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:45,810
What?

577
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:48,980
It was on this very day in 1997...

578
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,890
that I lost her.

579
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,590
I go to a temple every year on this day,

580
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:59,130
and for some reason, one of the nuns looked just like her.

581
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,000
I ran after her. I grabbed her and asked.

582
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:06,230
It wasn't her.

583
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:08,540
It wasn't her.

584
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:15,610
The very thought of it is agonizing.

585
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,750
And I have no one to share this with.

586
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,790
Missing someone so much it drives you crazy...

587
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,290
Do you have any idea what that's like?

588
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,500
Director Ko...

589
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,940
What am I supposed to do?

590
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:48,110
What is wrong with me today?

591
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,950
Eun Oh, you really drew the short straw.

592
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:56,220
Ever since I told you about my daughter,

593
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,820
she's been appearing in my dreams.

594
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:08,200
My daughter... She loved bananas more than anything.

595
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:18,370
Losing my daughter tore my heart to pieces,

596
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:23,980
and now my son's suffering is ripping me apart.

597
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,710
- Could you set the GPS to "Home?" - Okay.

598
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:56,640
What? You look like Ji Eun Oh.

599
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:02,220
Yes, that's the one. Please take us there.

600
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:22,900
I shouldn't have let her take me home.

601
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,940
No, this wasn't supposed to happen.

602
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:34,310
She doesn't know this neighbourhood at all.

603
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,550
There's no way she could've memorized the address.

604
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,470
This is so sad.

605
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,640
My heart aches.

606
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:10,050
Wearing this retro style makes me feel like a whole new person.

607
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,220
It gives me a fresh new look, you know?

608
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:16,420
You should all try it too. It feels like you're someone else.

609
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,700
I got this dress for 17.50 dollars.

00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:34,270

Ha Eun! What is going on?

616
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,180
I even got a few more subscribers.

617
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,010
Have you seen the comments?

618
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:43,320
Everyone's going wild over how lovely and cute you are.

619
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:46,690
I know, right? It's so wild, I can hardly believe it.

620
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:53,660
We have a bit of an age gap, don't we?

621
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,930
I hear you're 25,

622
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:58,770
and I'm 35.

623
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:03,640
My mom said I should meet you if I had a good first impression.

624
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:05,570
So, did I make a good first impression?

625
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,140
Yes.

626
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:10,810
You gave me your business card to tell me who you were.

627
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:13,610
To be honest, it was your mother who encouraged me,

628
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:16,180
but when I saw you, Yeong Ra, I was glad I came.

629
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,290
And I really enjoyed your paintings.

630
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:22,360
Oh, that's right. You must've been shocked that day.

631
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:26,960
If only I'd realised what was happening sooner that day,

632
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:28,500
I could have helped you, Yeong Ra.

633
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,970
There was no way you could have known.

634
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:33,800
You don't have another guy like that, do you?

635
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,040
No, of course not.

636
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,610
I lead a pretty quiet life.

637
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,910
It seems you just focus on your art and haven't dated much.

638
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:44,580
I like that.

639
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:47,050
What's to like about that?

640
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,160
Business is so slow, my wife and I have decided to run the store alone.

641
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,590
I see. Well, you have to do what you have to do.

642
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:02,000
So we'll only need you to work until 4pm today.

643
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,300
We'll make sure you're paid for your time up to today.

644
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:05,970
Wait, today?

645
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:09,040
We just made the final decision last night.

646
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,300
I'm very sorry.

647
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:13,910
Well, I'll be back at 4pm, then.

648
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:19,350
My gosh.

649
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:20,850
Oh, come on!

650
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:24,550
I get it, but still. To fire me on the spot like that.

651
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,900
Oh, boy. This place was perfect for me.

You fool.

654
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:47,470
You're a fool for seeking a store that's a perfect fit.

657
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,150
Hey, Yeong Bo.

658
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:58,150
Yes.

659
00:42:58,550 --> 00:42:59,820
So, have you decided on the investment?

660
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:03,420
And you sent the term sheet?

661
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:05,690
Okay, then let's meet to iron out the details.

662
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:08,530
Okay. Yes, I'll be in touch then.

663
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,830
Great, thank you. Okay.

Ji Eun Oh!

668
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:37,989
Ji Eun Oh! Hey.

669
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,430
- What? - Why are you the one sanding?

670
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:44,060
The carpenters did the 1st pass. I'm just doing the 2nd and 3rd.

671
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:46,970
Right, but why are you doing it? We can just call the spackling team.

672
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:49,840
It's just a small job. Why pay their day rate?

673
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,540
Why are you worried about the cost?

674
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:54,340
Are you the designer or the hired help?

675
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:56,580

678
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,350
- Found it. - No, I can do it.

I could've sworn you didn't have feet.

702
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:39,310
The way you were always darting around,

703
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:41,550
without ever resting.

704
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:45,020
Did that project take about two months?

705
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:47,390
Three months.

706
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:50,960
Thanks to Hyeon Su, we didn't have a deadline,

707
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:54,660
so we did a ton of trial and error and built it exactly how we wanted.

708
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:04,369
This is driving me crazy.

709
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:06,310
This isn't bad. Why did you throw it out?

710
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:10,180
I bet you'd do great with these.

711
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:12,810
Ji Hyuk.

712
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:20,650
You'll do great.

713
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:34,940
Oh, boy.

714
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:38,570
Let's take a little break.

715
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:54,050
Ji Eun Oh.

716
00:47:56,650 --> 00:47:58,390
How long will you let me lean on your shoulder?

717
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:02,820
Oh, right...

718
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,130
How long was I asleep?

719
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:17,040
I was out for an hour.

720
00:48:18,410 --> 00:48:22,180
Oh, has it been that long already?

721
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:27,450
Why did you let me sleep on your shoulder for a whole hour?

722
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,080
Why me?

723
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:34,520
You were in pain,

724
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:37,590
and you hadn't been able to sleep.

725
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:43,900
You know me. I'm practically an angel of mercy.

726
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:45,600
Is that the only reason?

727
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:48,470
There's nothing else?

728
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,240
There is, for me.

729
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:14,620
I'm in trouble.

730
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:22,200
It's getting really late.

731
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:25,530
I'm supposed to discuss business at home tonight.

732
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:29,340
Okay, sure.

733
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:32,270
Let's go home.

734
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:37,610
I still have some things to wrap up.

735
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:42,420
All right.

736
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:44,380
I'll get going, then.

737
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:01,330
(Shoealls)

738
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,270
(Chief Director Park Seong Jae)

739
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:12,350
Ji Eun Oh might be at the empty site by herself until late tonight.

740
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:13,410
Go check on her.

741
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:18,050
This guy...

742
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:20,350
Grandma.

743
00:51:20,650 --> 00:51:21,650
Yes?

744
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:23,920
Come have a seat.

745
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:28,030
How much longer are you going to keep all this in my room?

746
00:51:28,330 --> 00:51:30,230
It's kicking up a lot of dust.

747
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,469
Once I grab what I need for my shoot,

748
00:51:32,470 --> 00:51:33,970
I'll move the rest to my room.

749
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:35,030
Oh, dear.

750
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,300
Look at this.

751
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,000
This one.

752
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,810
Hey, did you buy this for me?

753
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:44,310
What? No, I bought it for my shoot.

754
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:46,950
You wear clothes like mine?

755
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:50,619
I have pants just like these.

756
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:51,850
- Look. - What?

757
00:51:52,090 --> 00:51:53,850
Oh, dear. Where did I put them?

758
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:56,990
Yes. See?

759
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,060
A perfect match, right?

760
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:03,630
- They're practically identical. - See? I told you.

761
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:04,700
No way.

762
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:08,700
- This is amazing, Grandma. - That's my style.

763
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,070
What? They're exactly the same.

764
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:14,240
Work as an apartment security guard?

765
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:19,450
My friend's the building manager, and he's looking to hire someone.

766
00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:21,880
He'd prefer to give the job to someone he knows.

767
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:23,320
Hey, you know...

768
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:27,450
- I'm studying for my license. - Of course, I know.

769
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:30,560
Yeong Bo told me you even passed the written test.

770
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,059
But passing the practical exam and getting the license...

771
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:35,800
doesn't guarantee you a job in the field.

772
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,100
Hey. Did you really tell me it was urgent...

773
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:41,940
just so I'd have to come and hear this?

774
00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:44,900
I told him not to bring it up.

775
00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:47,440
But he started talking about your wife.

776
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:50,410
Just think how worried your wife must be.

777
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:54,010
I know skilled trade jobs are stable,

778
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:56,120
but it's tough at our age.

779
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,520
They mostly hire guys in their 40s and 50s.

780
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:01,350
Hey. Men over 60 can work control rooms...

781
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:03,860
or mechanical rooms.

782
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:07,060
Look, people live to be 80 or older these days.

783
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:08,629
I refuse to live in constant anxiety,

784
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:10,100
working year-long contracts.

785
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,969
I'm going to get a proper job with insurance,

786
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:14,930
so I'm not a burden on my kids.

787
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,640
You think anyone lives like this because they want to?

788
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:20,540
Life doesn't always go as planned.

789
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:24,710
Why do you keep saying I can't? I'm going to do it.

790
00:53:24,810 --> 00:53:26,450
Goodness, you're so stubborn.

791
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:33,990
You're refusing to face reality. It's because of your son, isn't it?

792
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:39,290
- What? - You lost face over Lee Ji Hyuk.

793
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,259
Your son tried to seduce a rich girl and marry her,

794
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:44,600
but it fell through. How embarrassing.

795
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:47,570
Hey! My son isn't like that.

796
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,870
She was the one who proposed to him.

797
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:53,540
Either way, the fact is he ended up blaming his own circumstances.

798
00:53:53,770 --> 00:53:56,479
That's why you're scrambling.

799
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,680
You don't want him seeing you that way.

800
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:02,480
- Hey, that's enough. Stop it! - No, he's right.

801
00:54:03,050 --> 00:54:05,150
I don't want to be seen as that kind of father.

802
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:10,390
A father with just a mortgaged house and a job that could end tomorrow.

803
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:13,130
That's right. I refuse to be the kind of father...

804
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:14,860
my children have to worry about.

805
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:16,730
I'm going to keep trying until I make it.

806
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:20,070
Don't you guys know how fit I am?

807
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:23,440
I'd run a half-marathon every year without even breaking a sweat.

808
00:54:23,770 --> 00:54:28,670
At a warehouse or construction site, I'll do anything to support my wife.

809
00:54:28,910 --> 00:54:31,240
- Mind your own business. - All right, fine.

810
00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:35,480
I'm just looking out for you.

811
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:39,250
Where are you going?

812
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:13,120
What is wrong with me?

813
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:18,150
I don't want to be seen as that kind of father.

814
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:23,390
At a warehouse or construction site, I'll do anything to support my wife.

815
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:24,760
Mind your own business.

816
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:34,200
Father! What are you doing here?

817
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:37,340
You... What are you doing?

818
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,240
You can't just drink straight from the bottle like that.

819
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:40,610
Did something happen?

820
00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:43,840
- You don't need to know. - Get up. I'll drink with you.

821
00:56:44,010 --> 00:56:45,380
What do you think you're doing?

822
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:47,980
There's something I need to say too.

823
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:53,020
You said you had something to say.

824
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:54,520
Well, go on.

825
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:58,960
You first. Tell me why you were about to drink so heavily.

826
00:57:00,090 --> 00:57:03,100
You're the one who dragged me here saying you had something to say.

827
00:57:04,330 --> 00:57:06,400
I don't know where your head's at.

828
00:57:06,670 --> 00:57:08,270
So I'm not sure if I want to bring it up now.

829
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:10,700
What is it?

830
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:13,940
Well, I don't feel like telling you either.

831
00:57:14,370 --> 00:57:15,610
I don't even want to talk about it.

832
00:57:23,550 --> 00:57:26,320
Fine. Then I'll just get straight to the point.

833
00:57:27,290 --> 00:57:28,720
That 10,000 dollars you sent me.

834
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:30,690
I transferred it back into your account.

835
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:32,190
- I... - So, that's...

836
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:33,930
all this was about? Returning the money?

837
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:36,760
Without even asking why I sent it?

838
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:39,270
What about you?

839
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:41,900
You sent it without even asking if I needed it.

840
00:57:42,170 --> 00:57:43,740
You just made your own assumptions.

841
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:47,310
Well, what else can I do but assume? You don't tell me anything.

842
00:57:47,510 --> 00:57:50,140
What was I supposed to say? You never even ask.

843
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:53,080
About how my business is doing, what my situation is...

844
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:55,180
Am I supposed to tell you every single little detail?

845
00:57:55,580 --> 00:58:00,290
- Is that our relationship now? - Did I make it this way?

846
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:02,020
You did.

847
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:05,730
Right. I'm the one who did it.

848
00:58:06,530 --> 00:58:08,589
I was to marry Haneul Construction's daughter,

849
00:58:08,590 --> 00:58:10,230
but the wedding was called off.

850
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:15,400
You can't even find a job, but you won't take the money I send.

851
00:58:15,470 --> 00:58:18,370
If you turn around and send money, do you really expect me to take it?

852
00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:20,810
"He must be struggling somewhere again."

853
00:58:21,410 --> 00:58:22,880
That's what you thought, right?

854
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:24,940
Are you...

855
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:28,750
giving me a hard time just because you think I'm still mad at you?

856
00:58:29,150 --> 00:58:30,620
And how could I not be angry?

857
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:33,750
Do you have any idea what you did? What you put us through?

858
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:35,720
This again?

859
00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:39,830
That I humiliated you and Mom and never begged for forgiveness.

860
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:41,860
Is that what makes you so angry?

861
00:58:42,130 --> 00:58:43,400
"Angry?"

862
00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:45,500
You think that's all I am? Angry?

863
00:58:46,070 --> 00:58:49,540
You trampled all over my 33-year career, you punk!

864
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:51,900
The moment you...

865
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:54,510
decided to go through with that marriage...

866
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:02,380
Look.

867
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:08,050
Just after your first birthday, your grandpa had a boat accident.

868
00:59:08,990 --> 00:59:12,430
He broke ribs and damaged his lungs. He could never go back on the boat.

869
00:59:12,490 --> 00:59:14,930
Out of despair, he drank his days away.

870
00:59:16,030 --> 00:59:20,970
He had pleurisy, a brain haemorrhage, an aneurysm, and even kidney cancer.

871
00:59:21,830 --> 00:59:24,640
He spent 30 years going to hospitals before he finally passed away.

872
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:27,540
Was that my fault?

873
00:59:27,970 --> 00:59:31,140
Was I to blame? It was hard for me too, you know?

874
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:34,880
But I couldn't change the situation, so I just did the best I could.

875
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,120
As the head of this family, as a father.

876
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:39,750
I was always terrified of being laid off.

877
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:44,620
So I worked harder and harder. I became their model employee.

878
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:47,760
That's how I managed to hold on until retirement.

879
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:51,160
But...

880
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:54,270
you turned your back on everything I am.

881
00:59:54,330 --> 00:59:56,900
You made me feel like my whole life was for nothing, you punk.

882
00:59:57,940 --> 01:00:00,410
The life I lived as a provider, a father, and a son...

883
01:00:00,470 --> 01:00:03,340
You completely trampled all over it, you little punk!

884
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:07,180
You were trying to marry her for money?

885
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:10,419
How could you make such a foolish choice?

886
01:00:10,420 --> 01:00:11,750
And after creating such a mess,

887
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:15,350
you ran away and moved back in. Have you ever apologised to me?

888
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:16,520
And what about you?

889
01:00:17,590 --> 01:00:19,230
Have you ever apologised to me?

890
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:20,990
Have you ever said you were sorry?

891
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:22,960
What?

892
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:28,830
- For not sending you to the US? - Yes.

893
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:31,400
I trusted your promise, so from tenth grade,

894
01:00:31,770 --> 01:00:33,640
I spent two years of my life preparing to study abroad.

895
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:36,380
While my friends studied for college, I studied English,

896
01:00:36,810 --> 01:00:38,010
took sketching classes,

897
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:39,710
and studied architectural design.

898
01:00:40,650 --> 01:00:41,710
I was a high school senior...

899
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:44,550
when you told me, "I can't send you abroad."

900
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:46,620
"The money we saved up..."

901
01:00:47,250 --> 01:00:49,020
"is all going to your grandpa's medical bills."

902
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:53,630
My dream of becoming an architect overseas...

903
01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:56,630
and the two years I spent working toward that dream...

904
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:58,860
were crushed with a single sentence from you.

905
01:00:59,830 --> 01:01:01,670
Do you have any idea how I felt back then?

906
01:01:03,170 --> 01:01:05,670
But my hands were tied in that situation!

907
01:01:06,110 --> 01:01:08,440
- Grandpa's life was on the line... - Not once...

908
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:10,810
did you say you were sorry.

909
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:14,480
"I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise, Ji Hyuk."

910
01:01:15,210 --> 01:01:16,680
"I'm sorry for putting you through this."

911
01:01:19,450 --> 01:01:20,850
Those simple words...

912
01:01:22,390 --> 01:01:23,560
You never said them.

913
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:25,020
Not even once.

914
01:01:25,930 --> 01:01:28,390
Do I have to say the words out loud to be sorry?

915
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:31,430
As your father, do you think I didn't feel terrible?

916
01:01:31,530 --> 01:01:32,630
And what about my marriage?

917
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:35,940
You just went straight to blaming me.

918
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:38,340
Like I was some kind of trash who sold myself for money.

919
01:01:38,870 --> 01:01:41,240
You never even asked why I made that choice.

920
01:01:41,810 --> 01:01:43,840
You just judged me based on your own assumptions,

921
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:46,210
condemned me, and did nothing but criticize me.

922
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:49,950
Not once have you ever made an effort to understand me.

923
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:53,420
Even though you worked hard your whole life,

924
01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:57,890
your child can still hate it. It's not about right or wrong.

925
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:00,390
I'm saying that as your son, I'm allowed to hate it.

926
01:02:00,790 --> 01:02:04,300
Why must I tell you you were right and did the right thing?

927
01:02:04,530 --> 01:02:06,100
Especially when I'm telling you how hard it was for me.

928
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,970
I love you and Mom, but...

929
01:02:11,170 --> 01:02:12,840
I'm telling you, I'm allowed to hate the way I grew up.

930
01:02:14,370 --> 01:02:15,710
But just because I feel that way,

931
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:18,780
why does that make me the bad guy?

932
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:21,050
I...

933
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:24,380
haven't done anything wrong to you.

934
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:33,760
You ungrateful little brat...

935
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:48,770
You really never change, do you?

936
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:56,650
Hey, Lee Ji Hyuk.

937
01:02:59,590 --> 01:03:00,590
You...

938
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:05,260
Why don't you just move out?

939
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:12,600
Are you serious?

940
01:03:15,270 --> 01:03:16,740
So that's what you really want?

941
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:19,670
Is that it?

942
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:01,650
(Our Golden Days)

943
01:04:01,810 --> 01:04:05,780
You started an investment firm? Did you think we wouldn't find out?

944
01:04:05,850 --> 01:04:07,220
What were you thinking, doing this behind my back?

945
01:04:07,450 --> 01:04:11,620
Why the long face, honey? Got something to hide?

946
01:04:11,690 --> 01:04:14,760
You're curious, aren't you? About how I was adopted.

947
01:04:14,830 --> 01:04:16,660
I guess this is what they call perfect timing.

948
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:19,329
Eun Oh is wavering over Ji Hyuk again.

949
01:04:19,330 --> 01:04:21,100
How did I not see that coming?

950
01:04:21,230 --> 01:04:23,940
You've all been curious, haven't you? About my business.

951
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:27,670
Let's be strangers in the house. Let's just ignore each other.

952
01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:28,840
Fine.

953
01:04:29,410 --> 01:04:30,780
For the sake of peace in the family.
