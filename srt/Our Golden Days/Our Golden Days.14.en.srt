00:00:00,984 --> 00:00:01,984
(Episode 14)

2
00:00:01,985 --> 00:00:04,914
Let's be partners. Just you and me.

3
00:00:07,024 --> 00:00:09,354
What? You want us to do what?

4
00:00:10,194 --> 00:00:11,353
Mamdaerozip has...

5
00:00:11,354 --> 00:00:13,524
over ten turnkey project inquiries already.

6
00:00:14,024 --> 00:00:16,594
I was thinking you could take on those turnkey projects.

7
00:00:17,394 --> 00:00:20,264
- No, I'm not interested. - Just hear me out.

8
00:00:21,164 --> 00:00:24,404
You can keep doing your own projects and just oversee the turnkey ones.

9
00:00:24,834 --> 00:00:27,774
Mamdaerozip gets five percent from your jobs.

10
00:00:27,974 --> 00:00:29,674
Turnkey projects are a 70-30 split.

11
00:00:30,174 --> 00:00:31,574
You'd get the 70 percent.

12
00:00:33,484 --> 00:00:35,254
No, thanks. I'm not interested.

13
00:00:36,484 --> 00:00:37,954
What do you mean, you're not interested?

14
00:00:38,684 --> 00:00:40,753
You don't want to partner up with anyone,

15
00:00:40,754 --> 00:00:42,954
or you just don't want to work with me?

16
00:00:44,024 --> 00:00:45,124
Both.

17
00:00:46,164 --> 00:00:47,424
I don't get it.

18
00:00:48,534 --> 00:00:50,594
But you worked as a coordinator for me before.

19
00:00:51,094 --> 00:00:54,434
That was when I was so desperate I would've done anything.

20
00:00:54,904 --> 00:00:57,304
And you're not now? Don't you want to make money?

21
00:00:59,304 --> 00:01:02,243
You need money so you can breathe a little...

22
00:01:02,244 --> 00:01:03,844
and start living your life.

23
00:01:04,614 --> 00:01:06,914
This is exactly why I don't want to work with you.

24
00:01:07,714 --> 00:01:09,184
Because you're always crossing the line.

25
00:01:11,054 --> 00:01:15,894
I'd do one project a year on my own. Why do what I love with you?

26
00:01:16,924 --> 00:01:18,864
We've been partners before.

27
00:01:19,064 --> 00:01:21,894
Why won't you work with me? I don't get it.

28
00:01:22,994 --> 00:01:24,864
I can't just let it go until I understand why.

29
00:01:25,904 --> 00:01:27,464
I don't understand what it means.

30
00:01:27,704 --> 00:01:28,934
I don't get it.

31
00:01:29,134 --> 00:01:30,973
When I don't understand, I can't solve the problem...

32
00:01:30,974 --> 00:01:32,344
and find the answer.

33
00:01:35,514 --> 00:01:38,744
I won't get tangled up in business with someone I don't trust.

34
00:01:38,844 --> 00:01:41,014
I'd rather we just be strangers.

35
00:01:41,484 --> 00:01:43,554
You're already treating me like a stranger.

36
00:01:45,184 --> 00:01:49,494
Eun Oh. With the turnkey projects, you can pick the best ones.

37
00:01:50,294 --> 00:01:53,394
You need to grow Eunoism anyway. And I know you'll make it.

38
00:01:53,994 --> 00:01:57,734
But until then, your chances are few for projects you truly care about.

39
00:01:58,804 --> 00:02:03,674
This is a shortcut, so why refuse? Plus, you could make a lot of money.

40
00:02:04,574 --> 00:02:07,674
Come on. Aren't you the breadwinner? And you need a car, don't you?

41
00:02:08,174 --> 00:02:10,774
Why are you throwing away a chance to make good money?

42
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:17,154
Stop worrying about my family and worry about your own.

43
00:02:17,214 --> 00:02:20,784
You've even got investors now. So when do you get your own office?

44
00:02:21,254 --> 00:02:24,094
I'll take care of myself, so stay out of my business.

45
00:02:24,754 --> 00:02:26,764
Is that why you're thinking about taking on some copycat project?

46
00:02:27,694 --> 00:02:28,764
Hey, Lee Ji Hyuk!

47
00:02:29,464 --> 00:02:31,894
The funding really went to your head.

48
00:02:32,104 --> 00:02:33,734
Suddenly, you have a lot to say.

49
00:02:33,804 --> 00:02:35,434
At this rate, you'll be a tycoon in no time.

50
00:02:35,504 --> 00:02:37,634
"Lee Ji Hyuk?" Watch it, Ji Eun Oh.

51
00:02:37,704 --> 00:02:38,904
My point is,

52
00:02:39,874 --> 00:02:42,914
let's stay out of each other's way and do our own work.

53
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:48,714
You're being incredibly stubborn for no reason.

54
00:02:49,154 --> 00:02:51,554
You know none of what you're saying makes any logical sense, right?

55
00:03:06,004 --> 00:03:08,564
Something's wrong with her thinking.

56
00:03:08,774 --> 00:03:10,734
Arrogant? Stubborn? Spiteful? What is it?

57
00:03:17,674 --> 00:03:19,984
Just how disappointed in me could she be...

58
00:03:20,244 --> 00:03:21,644
to do a complete 180 on me?

59
00:03:24,854 --> 00:03:26,724
And she manages to get on my every last nerve.

60
00:03:36,164 --> 00:03:40,034
Hey, what are you picking out? You've been at it for a while.

61
00:03:41,034 --> 00:03:45,074
I'm going to the movies today, so I'm deciding what to wear.

62
00:03:46,474 --> 00:03:47,674
With who?

63
00:03:47,774 --> 00:03:50,174
What? Just a friend.

64
00:03:51,514 --> 00:03:52,514
I see.

65
00:03:53,584 --> 00:03:54,584
Hold on a second.

66
00:03:59,424 --> 00:04:00,424
What's all this?

67
00:04:00,554 --> 00:04:04,554
What? These are your old office clothes.

68
00:04:04,954 --> 00:04:07,564
Wear this. And stop wearing Gang Oh's clothes.

69
00:04:07,724 --> 00:04:10,994
What? You kept all of this? I thought you threw them out.

70
00:04:11,094 --> 00:04:13,404
My gosh, why would I throw out perfectly good clothes?

71
00:04:14,904 --> 00:04:18,074
Also, you haven't gone out properly in a while.

72
00:04:18,804 --> 00:04:21,504
Dressing up helps lift your spirits.

73
00:04:23,044 --> 00:04:27,644
You're right. I guess I dress too casually at work.

74
00:04:30,654 --> 00:04:33,824
Then, maybe I'll dress up for a change.

75
00:05:00,914 --> 00:05:01,914
She's beautiful.

76
00:05:04,684 --> 00:05:05,684
What?

77
00:05:07,454 --> 00:05:09,324
I think I just heard you bad-mouthing me.

78
00:05:10,024 --> 00:05:11,024
Me?

79
00:05:12,094 --> 00:05:13,124
No, of course not.

80
00:05:16,994 --> 00:05:17,994
Well...

81
00:05:18,664 --> 00:05:19,903
So if I wear a dress like this,

82
00:05:19,904 --> 00:05:21,804
you'll open doors and be a gentleman?

83
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,504
I've always opened the door for you.

84
00:05:25,574 --> 00:05:26,774
Actually, Eun Oh...

85
00:05:28,274 --> 00:05:29,574
I said you looked beautiful.

86
00:05:30,474 --> 00:05:31,814
Gosh, so cheesy.

87
00:05:32,314 --> 00:05:33,414
Don't say things like that.

88
00:05:33,484 --> 00:05:35,814
Well, don't wear a dress like that, then.

89
00:05:36,614 --> 00:05:41,224
I couldn't do that. I haven't been asked out in forever.

90
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,194
I guess I'll have to ask you out more often then.

91
00:05:44,854 --> 00:05:47,964
It must be nice being the director. You get to go out on a weekday.

92
00:05:48,464 --> 00:05:50,934
Hey, what are you talking about? I took a personal day for this.

93
00:05:51,664 --> 00:05:52,664
Hop in.

94
00:06:10,414 --> 00:06:13,284
Then let's make good on that movie promise.

95
00:06:13,884 --> 00:06:16,154
Of course. When would be a good time?

96
00:06:16,654 --> 00:06:19,064
Since when did she get so comfortable around Seong Jae?

97
00:06:20,324 --> 00:06:22,124
How did they get so close?

98
00:06:23,064 --> 00:06:24,834
So, I'll see you on Wednesday, then?

99
00:06:27,864 --> 00:06:30,374
So that's it. They're going to the movies today.

100
00:06:30,734 --> 00:06:33,144
When the heck did they make plans to see a movie?

101
00:06:34,304 --> 00:06:35,304
This is ridiculous.

102
00:06:42,654 --> 00:06:47,384
I feel like I'm in another world. Like a parallel universe.

103
00:06:47,884 --> 00:06:50,594
Where another version of me is living in a whole other world.

104
00:06:51,824 --> 00:06:52,864
I feel the same way.

105
00:06:55,024 --> 00:06:58,594
I can't believe I'm having this meal with you, Eun Oh.

106
00:06:59,834 --> 00:07:02,204
It's surreal for you too, right? I feel the same way.

107
00:07:05,474 --> 00:07:06,474
Well...

108
00:07:07,804 --> 00:07:09,444
But it's not bad, right?

109
00:07:10,444 --> 00:07:11,444
Not at all.

110
00:07:11,944 --> 00:07:14,584
This fusion food is new to me. It's really delicious.

111
00:07:17,454 --> 00:07:18,454
Changing the subject.

112
00:07:19,324 --> 00:07:20,324
What?

113
00:07:20,824 --> 00:07:22,054
It's nothing. Eat up.

114
00:07:26,924 --> 00:07:30,394
But why did you suddenly decide to call in that promise?

115
00:07:30,764 --> 00:07:31,864
That was ages ago.

116
00:07:33,164 --> 00:07:36,904
As a businessman, if I forget debts, I'd be out of business.

117
00:07:39,804 --> 00:07:43,344
Everything about my situation just came out all at once.

118
00:07:43,844 --> 00:07:45,544
I was too overwhelmed to even think about dealing with it.

119
00:07:46,144 --> 00:07:49,884
Why feel like you have to manage it? We're all adults who can handle it.

120
00:07:51,584 --> 00:07:53,854
Thank you for not prying.

121
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:57,954
And for not tiptoeing around me, asking if I'm okay.

122
00:08:00,864 --> 00:08:02,594
That feeling of not wanting anyone to know you're struggling...

123
00:08:03,364 --> 00:08:04,634
I know it all too well.

124
00:08:07,804 --> 00:08:08,804
You do?

125
00:08:09,174 --> 00:08:10,604
Well, you know.

126
00:08:11,374 --> 00:08:12,374
As a certain someone said,

127
00:08:13,174 --> 00:08:14,904
there are some things you can't tell just anyone.

128
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,244
That kind of thing.

129
00:08:18,744 --> 00:08:21,784
I don't think I've ever heard you talk like that before.

130
00:08:22,454 --> 00:08:24,714
Sounds like there's a tragic backstory.

131
00:08:25,284 --> 00:08:27,254
They say everyone's got a story.

132
00:08:28,384 --> 00:08:32,224
- Come on, eat. It'll get cold. - But I'm full.

133
00:08:32,724 --> 00:08:35,194
Oh, no. Don't say that. You have to finish this.

134
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:37,434
We've got a bit of a walk to our next destination.

135
00:08:48,074 --> 00:08:49,844
The weather is amazing today.

136
00:08:50,714 --> 00:08:52,683
You didn't notice the seasons changing.

137
00:08:52,684 --> 00:08:54,484
It's been a while since you've been out.

138
00:08:55,044 --> 00:08:58,054
What, you think I spend all day cooped up on-site?

139
00:08:58,154 --> 00:09:00,984
Does just running back and forth count as getting some sun?

140
00:09:01,254 --> 00:09:02,524
You have to take a moment to enjoy it.

141
00:09:05,354 --> 00:09:10,064
These were a lighter green before. The leaves have gotten darker.

142
00:09:11,564 --> 00:09:12,564
You're right.

143
00:09:14,004 --> 00:09:15,604
My, this is so nice.

144
00:09:24,614 --> 00:09:25,614
Oh, my.

145
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:30,954
Yes! Oh, I got it!

146
00:09:31,184 --> 00:09:32,784
I think I'm actually really good at this.

147
00:09:34,684 --> 00:09:36,124
Nice, I hit it!

148
00:09:38,654 --> 00:09:39,664
- My gosh. - Oh, my.

149
00:09:39,724 --> 00:09:42,194
Thank you. Oh, it's so cute.

150
00:09:44,894 --> 00:09:45,904
(Song Ha Bin, Education)

151
00:09:46,934 --> 00:09:49,374
- Thank you for your time. - Thank you.

152
00:10:01,084 --> 00:10:02,854
The more I think about it, the more absurd it gets.

153
00:10:03,314 --> 00:10:05,284
Seong Jae, that jerk. Doesn't he know any better?

154
00:10:06,154 --> 00:10:07,983
Why is he so selfish, making it harder...

155
00:10:07,984 --> 00:10:09,224
on someone in distress?

156
00:10:10,794 --> 00:10:13,194
Especially after I told him, point-blank, to back off.

157
00:10:14,294 --> 00:10:16,234
Hello. I'm here for the interview.

158
00:10:16,294 --> 00:10:18,394
Yes. Come on in. Please have a seat.

159
00:10:58,674 --> 00:11:00,874
Oh, this breeze feels nice.

160
00:11:08,844 --> 00:11:11,114
Eun Oh is like a bright, warm ray of sunshine.

161
00:11:11,584 --> 00:11:13,824
And her laugh is like a cool, refreshing breeze.

162
00:11:14,954 --> 00:11:18,324
You've got your spirits back. I can hear it in your voice.

163
00:11:20,294 --> 00:11:21,294
Yes.

164
00:11:21,994 --> 00:11:23,634
I received a sign.

165
00:11:23,964 --> 00:11:25,734
A sign telling me to live my life to the fullest.

166
00:11:27,304 --> 00:11:29,034
What do you mean by that?

167
00:11:29,934 --> 00:11:31,504
I have a bestie.

168
00:11:32,104 --> 00:11:34,644
A few days ago, I met up with my bestie and got to vent.

169
00:11:34,874 --> 00:11:37,843
And today, thanks to you, I got to soak up some sun...

170
00:11:37,844 --> 00:11:39,244
and feel the gentle breeze.

171
00:11:39,544 --> 00:11:42,414
I've laughed a lot, and the food was amazing.

172
00:11:43,554 --> 00:11:45,814
I think it's all a sign telling me that life is still worth living.

173
00:11:47,854 --> 00:11:48,954
Is that so?

174
00:11:49,994 --> 00:11:54,694
When the time is right, everything falls into place.

175
00:11:55,864 --> 00:11:59,834
But knowing that, we still walk into that moment of pain.

176
00:12:00,664 --> 00:12:01,664
Willingly.

177
00:12:05,004 --> 00:12:06,004
Willingly?

178
00:12:07,104 --> 00:12:08,104
On your own?

179
00:12:15,184 --> 00:12:16,854
We'll let you know our decision by text.

180
00:12:16,954 --> 00:12:18,684
All right. I look forward to hearing from you.

181
00:12:30,864 --> 00:12:33,304
My eyes are so tired, it feels like they're about to burst.

182
00:12:38,004 --> 00:12:40,044
I can finally have my cup noodles in peace today.

183
00:12:43,874 --> 00:12:45,944
- Enjoy your meal. - Thank you.

184
00:12:46,844 --> 00:12:49,354
Lee Ji Hyuk, you're moving up in the world.

185
00:12:50,354 --> 00:12:52,014
Coming out for beef bone soup and everything.

186
00:12:56,424 --> 00:12:57,424
Nice.

187
00:12:58,524 --> 00:13:00,164
Now, I feel better.

188
00:13:01,764 --> 00:13:02,764
Oh, yes.

"No content?"

191
00:13:12,534 --> 00:13:16,614
Goodness. As if I'd hire someone who sends an empty email.

192
00:13:16,744 --> 00:13:17,744
Good grief.

193
00:13:20,844 --> 00:13:22,754
What? Neiro?

194
00:13:24,914 --> 00:13:26,484
Wait, he worked at Key Life?

195
00:13:26,984 --> 00:13:29,184
So why would someone like him apply to Mamdaerozip?

196
00:13:35,964 --> 00:13:37,434
This is Cha Cheol Min.

197
00:13:38,294 --> 00:13:40,103
Yes, this is Mamdaerozip.

198
00:13:40,104 --> 00:13:41,404
Did you apply to the correct place?

199
00:13:41,464 --> 00:13:42,464
Yes.

200
00:13:42,834 --> 00:13:44,904
So, why'd you quit Neiro?

201
00:13:45,404 --> 00:13:47,973
Did you get into some trouble there?

202
00:13:47,974 --> 00:13:51,344
They asked me not to leave, and you can call and confirm that.

203
00:13:51,444 --> 00:13:53,213
I applied of my own volition.

204
00:13:53,214 --> 00:13:54,944
If you don't want to interview me, we're done.

205
00:13:55,014 --> 00:13:57,714
No. Of course, I'll interview you. Let's do it.

206
00:14:04,754 --> 00:14:06,894
I really appreciate everything today.

207
00:14:07,524 --> 00:14:08,794
I had a great time today.

208
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:10,264
Me too.

209
00:14:10,734 --> 00:14:11,964
Get home safe.

210
00:14:13,064 --> 00:14:14,064
Okay, I will.

211
00:14:25,274 --> 00:14:26,284
You just got here?

212
00:14:27,044 --> 00:14:28,514
Are all the interviews done?

213
00:14:30,214 --> 00:14:31,714
I need to get some work done.

214
00:14:35,854 --> 00:14:38,954
She was out having fun all day, and now she has to work here?

215
00:14:41,094 --> 00:14:42,794
And what's with that dress?

216
00:14:43,364 --> 00:14:44,894
That's totally a date outfit.

217
00:14:53,444 --> 00:14:57,874
I was going to drink both, but... Do you want one?

218
00:14:59,414 --> 00:15:00,414
Thanks, I'd love one.

219
00:15:02,384 --> 00:15:03,514
Wait, where are you...

220
00:15:06,554 --> 00:15:08,484
What's with her? Why is she suddenly so cheerful?

221
00:15:09,654 --> 00:15:11,254
Is it because she saw Seong Jae?

222
00:15:12,524 --> 00:15:15,264
I thought they just saw a movie. Did they go to an amusement park?

223
00:15:16,134 --> 00:15:17,734
She's not a little kid. Getting excited over that...

224
00:15:18,564 --> 00:15:21,734
Was that a date or what? What were they doing? Seriously.

- Wait, Ms. Ji? - What?

229
00:15:33,844 --> 00:15:36,044
Mister, you work here?

230
00:15:36,214 --> 00:15:39,054
- Yes. - Someone else is usually here now.

231
00:15:39,154 --> 00:15:42,284
Right, that person had an accident and had to quit.

232
00:15:42,354 --> 00:15:45,223
I've been working here since that day.

233
00:15:45,224 --> 00:15:46,664
About 2 or 3 days a week.

234
00:15:47,024 --> 00:15:49,664
I see. I'm actually a regular here.

235
00:15:50,164 --> 00:15:51,864
- You are? - Yes.

236
00:15:52,164 --> 00:15:54,334
It's on a backstreet, so it's quiet.

237
00:15:54,534 --> 00:15:57,834
- So the walk over is always quiet. - Is your office nearby?

238
00:15:57,904 --> 00:15:59,034
Yes, just up that way.

239
00:15:59,304 --> 00:16:00,304
I see.

240
00:16:00,574 --> 00:16:02,104
- I guess I'll see you often, then. - Yes.

241
00:16:03,514 --> 00:16:05,544
- Okay, just this then? - Yes.

242
00:16:07,214 --> 00:16:10,114
- That'll be 1.20 dollars. - Okay.

243
00:16:10,284 --> 00:16:12,754
Here, let me bag that for you.

244
00:16:13,054 --> 00:16:15,384
That's okay. I might just eat it on my way.

245
00:16:15,584 --> 00:16:17,053
- All right, then. - See you around.

246
00:16:17,054 --> 00:16:18,624
You too. Get back safely.

247
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,834
Ms. Ji! Wait up!

248
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:29,034
Wait, hold on.

249
00:16:29,534 --> 00:16:30,534
- Here. - What is it?

250
00:16:30,535 --> 00:16:32,334
- Here you go. - What's this?

251
00:16:32,474 --> 00:16:36,514
Don't worry. It's free. We were about to throw it out.

252
00:16:37,574 --> 00:16:39,014
Oh, come on.

253
00:16:39,414 --> 00:16:41,184
I know you're not supposed to throw this out yet.

254
00:16:41,544 --> 00:16:44,384
- Sorry? - It's not past midnight yet.

255
00:16:44,714 --> 00:16:46,424

Pardon?

260
00:16:57,034 --> 00:17:01,804
I hope my son gets help like this when he's having a hard time.

261
00:17:06,644 --> 00:17:08,344
Well, now I have to take it.

262
00:17:09,004 --> 00:17:10,014
Thank you. I'll enjoy it.

Hey, Su Jeong.

271
00:17:49,144 --> 00:17:52,484
So, how was your day? Ji Eun Oh's first outing in ages.

272
00:17:53,484 --> 00:17:57,494
- It was fun. - No kidding. You sound happy.

After talking with Woo Jin and Director Seong Jae,

274

Gang Oh is his own person, and I'm just his sister.

I realized that fact isn't going to change.

276
00:18:08,904 --> 00:18:11,504
So I'm just going to wait for him to come back.

I wanted to finish Director Ko's plans.

- Did you set a meeting? Any news? - No, not yet.

284
00:18:28,054 --> 00:18:30,393
She said it'd take some time to select artists...

285
00:18:30,394 --> 00:18:32,224

Yes, I'm heading home soon.

Couldn't she have at least said goodbye?

00:22:56,184 --> 00:22:59,024
You'd have to expand it and manage all the forums as well.

354
00:22:59,354 --> 00:23:00,364
Understood.

355
00:23:03,394 --> 00:23:05,694
The sooner you start, the better. When can you start?

356
00:23:09,264 --> 00:23:10,634
There are no shoe samples?

357
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:13,874
- Didn't they keep an extra of each? - No, sir.

358
00:23:14,144 --> 00:23:18,374
Apparently, we have some old models still left in inventory.

359
00:23:21,184 --> 00:23:22,684
They didn't keep any in storage?

360
00:23:25,084 --> 00:23:28,124
Well, then, Ms. Kim, you've got some work to do.

361
00:23:28,484 --> 00:23:30,494
Tell Mr. Kim in Management Support to come up.

362
00:23:31,224 --> 00:23:32,224
Yes, sir.

365
00:24:02,754 --> 00:24:03,954
You wanted to see me?

366
00:24:04,554 --> 00:24:05,754
What are you playing at?

367
00:24:06,894 --> 00:24:08,424
What's your angle here?

368
00:24:08,994 --> 00:24:11,994
I doubt you've suddenly found a passion for the business.

369
00:24:12,834 --> 00:24:15,534
When you inherited the company from Grandfather,

370
00:24:16,234 --> 00:24:18,134
did you do it because you thought it would be fun?

371
00:24:18,574 --> 00:24:19,574
What?

372
00:24:20,004 --> 00:24:22,644
You're the one who told me running a company isn't about fun.

373
00:24:23,714 --> 00:24:25,774
Because I'm the eldest and only son,

374
00:24:26,884 --> 00:24:29,384
it was the path I was fated to walk. That's what you told me.

375
00:24:30,814 --> 00:24:31,854
So,

376
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:33,784
I'm going to walk this path,

377
00:24:35,084 --> 00:24:37,024
and I'm going to do it right.

378
00:24:38,524 --> 00:24:40,724
That's a pathetic excuse.

379
00:24:43,094 --> 00:24:44,934
I refuse to become a toothless tiger.

380
00:24:48,864 --> 00:24:50,804
As much as I'm happy to hear that,

381
00:24:51,874 --> 00:24:54,244
I don't trust a man who changes overnight.

382
00:24:56,374 --> 00:24:59,344
You must have an ulterior motive.

Still,

385
00:25:02,984 --> 00:25:05,414
since you seem to be finally getting your hands dirty,

386
00:25:05,914 --> 00:25:07,054
I'll be watching.

387
00:25:09,284 --> 00:25:10,294
Very well.

388
00:25:10,624 --> 00:25:11,954
I'll get back to my work.

(Winter 2015)

390
00:25:33,245 --> 00:25:36,344
- I'm here! Ji Eun Oh is here. - Yes!

391
00:25:36,414 --> 00:25:40,524
- There she is! - And I brought a homemade cake.

392
00:25:51,134 --> 00:25:52,464
Thank you so much.

393
00:25:57,974 --> 00:25:59,004
I'm off.

394
00:26:00,744 --> 00:26:03,204
- Hey, you made this yourself? - Yes.

395
00:26:03,274 --> 00:26:05,674
Hey, nothing to see here. Don't even bother trying it.

396
00:26:05,974 --> 00:26:07,284
We'll see about that.

397
00:26:07,814 --> 00:26:11,884
- And now, drumroll please. - Oh, my.

398
00:26:12,414 --> 00:26:14,024
Ta-da!

399
00:26:17,124 --> 00:26:18,754
- Hey! - Doesn't it look amazing?

400
00:26:19,054 --> 00:26:22,964
Ji Hyuk, if this tastes good, stop calling me "The Spring."

401
00:26:23,534 --> 00:26:25,834
And trust me. It'll be delicious.

402
00:26:26,434 --> 00:26:27,734
You may not believe me,

403
00:26:28,804 --> 00:26:30,703
but I've been making my parents' birthday cakes...

404
00:26:30,704 --> 00:26:32,334
since I was ten.

405
00:26:32,874 --> 00:26:35,304
The Spring won't stop talking, as usual.

406
00:26:35,774 --> 00:26:37,144
Just light the candles already.

407
00:26:37,344 --> 00:26:38,413
- Yes, light them already! - Come on.

408
00:26:38,414 --> 00:26:41,514
I'm serious, Ji Hyuk. You have to promise me first.

409
00:26:43,214 --> 00:26:45,354
Wait, what?

410
00:26:45,684 --> 00:26:46,984
Isn't that... No, wait.

411
00:26:47,784 --> 00:26:49,424
What's he doing here?

412
00:26:50,124 --> 00:26:51,524
- Why? - What's wrong?

413
00:26:51,754 --> 00:26:53,964
What's going on? You two know each other? How?

414
00:26:54,424 --> 00:26:55,864
Hey, do you know him?

415
00:26:56,264 --> 00:26:58,464
Well, it's...

416
00:26:58,764 --> 00:27:01,664
No, it's... It's just that...

417
00:27:01,934 --> 00:27:05,004
I asked her for directions once.

418
00:27:05,334 --> 00:27:07,174
- I see. - That's right.

419
00:27:07,374 --> 00:27:08,544
Yes, you did, didn't you?

420
00:27:08,874 --> 00:27:10,814
I'm so forgetful sometimes.

421
00:27:10,874 --> 00:27:13,244
Goodness, this is so frustrating that I could just scream.

422
00:27:31,034 --> 00:27:32,364
She was like a ray of sunshine.

423
00:27:32,964 --> 00:27:34,464
A breath of fresh air.

424
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,444
I had no idea she was...

425
00:27:45,774 --> 00:27:48,344

Hello.

00:28:08,534 --> 00:28:10,004
- You're here already. - I am.

430
00:28:10,334 --> 00:28:14,344
The flooring is on the second floor, so let's start up there,

431
00:28:14,474 --> 00:28:16,404
and then we can come back down to look at the kitchen sinks.

432
00:28:16,674 --> 00:28:20,414
- The colors depend on the floor. - Sure.

433
00:28:20,914 --> 00:28:21,914
This way, please.

434
00:28:24,384 --> 00:28:25,984
This place is huge.

435
00:28:28,454 --> 00:28:29,924
- Oh, I'm sorry. - My gosh.

436
00:28:31,294 --> 00:28:32,794
Hey. What a coincidence.

- What? - Ms. Ji Eun Oh?

438
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:37,634
Yes, well...

Hello. I'm Lee Ji Hyuk, the CEO of Mamdaerozip.

441
00:28:47,574 --> 00:28:50,744
Oh, I've seen your work. On your weblog.

442
00:28:50,844 --> 00:28:53,144
Oh, you have? Thank you.

443
00:28:54,484 --> 00:28:56,184
What are you doing here?

444
00:28:56,684 --> 00:28:58,654
I heard this was a good showroom to check out.

445
00:28:59,684 --> 00:29:02,654
Oh, you must be her client for the Mapo apartment, right?

446
00:29:03,224 --> 00:29:04,693
- You know about that? - Of course.

447
00:29:04,694 --> 00:29:05,924
I saw on the schedule...

448
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:08,494
that you're checking out kitchen cabinets and closets today.

449
00:29:09,224 --> 00:29:13,394
Do you mind if I join you? I'm on your project, so I can help.

450
00:29:13,494 --> 00:29:16,234
Especially with the furniture colors for your five-year-old son's room.

451
00:29:17,904 --> 00:29:21,974
You really don't have to do that. Please look around by yourself.

452
00:29:22,074 --> 00:29:25,074
Ms. Ji. If it's about me, I don't mind.

453
00:29:26,044 --> 00:29:30,714
I can learn from you too, Ms. Ji. We can all learn from each other.

454
00:29:31,054 --> 00:29:32,154
Well, let's get in.

455
00:29:37,354 --> 00:29:40,054
(View Plus Frame, Standard Frame)

456
00:29:43,564 --> 00:29:48,204
I think this gives you that bright, yet warm feeling you're after.

457
00:29:48,904 --> 00:29:49,904
I agree.

458
00:29:55,074 --> 00:29:59,144
It looks even better in person. I'm glad I listened to you, Ms. Ji.

459
00:29:59,274 --> 00:30:01,313
We've taken the final measurements,

460
00:30:01,314 --> 00:30:03,754
so you just need to pick the material and color.

461
00:30:04,154 --> 00:30:08,124
And remember, we can also set the sink height to match yours.

462
00:30:09,054 --> 00:30:13,094
If a tall guy like me lives alone, can you adjust my sink height too?

463
00:30:13,794 --> 00:30:17,894
Yes. We've had many custom requests for that.

464
00:30:18,064 --> 00:30:21,034
We can create a perfect fit even if the dimensions vary between homes.

465
00:30:21,464 --> 00:30:23,064
Nice.

466
00:30:30,174 --> 00:30:31,574
I totally lost track of time.

467
00:30:32,174 --> 00:30:35,414
I'll be late for my next meeting. I'd better get going.

468
00:30:35,714 --> 00:30:36,744
I'll walk out with you.

469
00:30:37,454 --> 00:30:39,214
Take care. See you next time.

470
00:30:45,254 --> 00:30:46,354
What are you doing?

471
00:30:46,554 --> 00:30:49,264
You're here, so look around the rest of the second floor with me.

472
00:30:51,034 --> 00:30:52,734
I'm serious. I really need to ask you something.

473
00:30:52,794 --> 00:30:55,804
You can just ask the staff here. They'll tell you everything.

474
00:30:55,864 --> 00:30:58,604
Look. I'm doing interiors for 29 units,

475
00:30:58,674 --> 00:31:03,274
and I only know a few suppliers. So I need recommendations, right?

476
00:31:03,644 --> 00:31:06,774
But I see that clients can browse everything at once here.

477
00:31:07,114 --> 00:31:10,214
But I need to know the materials before I can negotiate a discount.

478
00:31:12,414 --> 00:31:13,414
So?

479
00:31:13,484 --> 00:31:17,354
So, please take a look with me. Your input would be a huge help.

480
00:31:17,824 --> 00:31:20,024
That window frame I glanced at seemed unique.

481
00:31:21,664 --> 00:31:24,994
Hey, in the time it took to beg you, we could have already taken a look.

482
00:31:27,264 --> 00:31:28,264
Thirty minutes.

483
00:31:28,334 --> 00:31:30,234
Okay! Let's go.

484
00:31:34,744 --> 00:31:36,104
See? It's different, isn't it?

485
00:31:36,544 --> 00:31:40,614
It's because of the slim frame design.

486
00:31:40,684 --> 00:31:42,684
It gives you a much better view.

487
00:31:44,714 --> 00:31:48,254
You're right. It really opens up the view.

488
00:31:49,624 --> 00:31:51,224
Was this what you were so curious about?

489
00:31:51,894 --> 00:31:54,664
It sets the house apart. Didn't you say details are key?

490
00:31:55,624 --> 00:31:59,964
My clients would love to know that these windows are available.

491
00:32:00,464 --> 00:32:03,734
I'll ask for a bulk discount. What do you think?

492
00:32:03,804 --> 00:32:06,134
I've already worked things out with the moving company.

493
00:32:06,504 --> 00:32:09,644
We partnered up, and they agreed to give our clients a discount.

494
00:32:10,144 --> 00:32:12,514
If we consolidate our material sources like this,

495
00:32:12,874 --> 00:32:14,544
it'll save clients a ton of hassle, right?

496
00:32:18,454 --> 00:32:19,454
What?

497
00:32:20,314 --> 00:32:21,984
You're awfully talkative today.

498
00:32:22,154 --> 00:32:24,754
I am, right? But ideas keep popping into my head.

499
00:32:24,994 --> 00:32:26,224
This stuff is fun.

500
00:32:29,124 --> 00:32:31,794
So what's your cut from the moving company?

501
00:32:32,194 --> 00:32:33,394
I'm not taking one.

502
00:32:33,694 --> 00:32:35,404
Aren't you in this to make money?

503
00:32:35,734 --> 00:32:36,734
Of course, I am.

504
00:32:37,034 --> 00:32:38,504
But it's no fun if I'm the only one who benefits.

505
00:32:39,104 --> 00:32:41,744
Shouldn't my clients get something out of it too?

506
00:32:51,854 --> 00:32:56,553
"I don't want to go with this jerk, but I can't say no after he helped,"

507
00:32:56,554 --> 00:32:59,194
"so I can't just brush him off." That's what you're thinking, right?

508
00:33:01,194 --> 00:33:02,464
Oh, you're so clever.

509
00:33:02,524 --> 00:33:05,434
I'll stop asking for a partnership, so just let me drive you.

510
00:33:05,664 --> 00:33:09,164
Going to the same place in two cars is a bit childish, Ms. Ji.

511
00:33:21,544 --> 00:33:22,744
Did you have fun yesterday?

512
00:33:24,114 --> 00:33:25,114
Yes.

513
00:33:26,054 --> 00:33:27,624
Looks like you and Seong Jae got pretty close.

514
00:33:29,684 --> 00:33:30,694
Yes.

515
00:33:36,524 --> 00:33:39,534
Wait, since when? When did you get close to Seong Jae?

516
00:33:39,594 --> 00:33:41,164
How did that happen? Did you get close by trashing me?

517
00:33:41,434 --> 00:33:44,804
Did Seong Jae say anything specific to you?

518
00:33:45,574 --> 00:33:46,804
Why do you keep staring at me?

519
00:33:47,504 --> 00:33:48,504
What?

520
00:33:49,404 --> 00:33:50,404
What?

521
00:33:50,874 --> 00:33:52,114
If you have something to say, just say it.

522
00:33:52,514 --> 00:33:54,584
No. It's nothing.

523
00:33:55,014 --> 00:33:57,954
- Okay. - Keep your eyes on the road.

524
00:33:58,084 --> 00:33:59,084
Right.

525
00:34:01,824 --> 00:34:04,694
So, did you have fun with Seong Jae yesterday?

526
00:34:06,194 --> 00:34:07,564
You already asked me that.

527
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:10,464
I did?

528
00:34:11,634 --> 00:34:12,634
Right.

529
00:34:13,034 --> 00:34:14,564
It's like my memory just reset.

530
00:34:25,144 --> 00:34:26,614
Seriously?

531
00:34:35,184 --> 00:34:37,154
Seong Jae, didn't you see me?

532
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:40,223
I saw you working late,

533
00:34:40,224 --> 00:34:42,194
so I waited for the lights to go off.

534
00:34:42,794 --> 00:34:44,634
And what can I do for you this time?

535
00:34:45,134 --> 00:34:46,534
I'll give you a ride home,

536
00:34:46,964 --> 00:34:49,404
so we can talk in the car. I'm exhausted today.

537
00:34:51,434 --> 00:34:53,804
Just go on ten dates with me.

538
00:34:54,604 --> 00:34:56,144
I can't just give up like this.

539
00:34:58,044 --> 00:34:59,044
What?

540
00:34:59,374 --> 00:35:00,514
Is there a reason why not?

541
00:35:03,444 --> 00:35:05,914
You've been talking to my brother, haven't you?

542
00:35:06,484 --> 00:35:07,824
He's back in Seoul, isn't he?

543
00:35:08,384 --> 00:35:10,554
Otherwise, you can't say you're going to tattle on me to him.

544
00:35:14,524 --> 00:35:15,594
We need to talk.

545
00:35:24,874 --> 00:35:26,374
Su Bin, you little...

546
00:35:26,734 --> 00:35:28,544
Trying to set a trap for a grown-up, are you?

547
00:35:28,844 --> 00:35:29,844
Why, you...

548
00:35:30,714 --> 00:35:34,713
Don't talk to me like that. I'm not a kid. I'm a grown woman.

549
00:35:34,714 --> 00:35:35,984
Not to me, you're not.

550
00:35:36,044 --> 00:35:39,813
We're only 9 years apart. It's not like there's a 19-year gap.

551
00:35:39,814 --> 00:35:41,224
Stop acting like such an old man.

552
00:35:41,854 --> 00:35:45,193
I'm 24 years old now. Why won't you even give it a shot?

553
00:35:45,194 --> 00:35:48,664
So you're shutting me out for being your friend's sister or a kid?

554
00:35:50,734 --> 00:35:53,093
- You're serious about this. - Of course, I am.

555
00:35:53,094 --> 00:35:54,164
Su Bin.

556
00:35:54,534 --> 00:35:58,074
Even if you weren't Ji Hyuk's little sister,

557
00:35:58,304 --> 00:36:00,774
and even if I hadn't known you since you were seven,

558
00:36:01,244 --> 00:36:04,144
I don't see you that way. And I never will.

559
00:36:04,874 --> 00:36:07,244
How can you be so sure? What makes you so confident?

560
00:36:07,484 --> 00:36:10,754
Don't you remember me telling you there's someone I like?

561
00:36:11,014 --> 00:36:14,024
If you've liked her for a long time, you would've made a move,

562
00:36:14,224 --> 00:36:16,483
which means she must've rejected you.

563
00:36:16,484 --> 00:36:18,723
That's why you're not dating,

564
00:36:18,724 --> 00:36:20,424
and you're stuck with this crush. Am I right?

565
00:36:21,794 --> 00:36:25,194
And for the record, a one-sided crush isn't a rival.

566
00:36:27,234 --> 00:36:28,234
Good grief...

567
00:36:30,004 --> 00:36:31,704
I completely forgot.

568
00:36:31,874 --> 00:36:33,934
You've been a hardhead since you were a kid.

569
00:36:34,474 --> 00:36:39,074
Right. But I don't hold grudges, so just go on ten dates with me.

570
00:36:39,244 --> 00:36:43,444
And if I still don't feel a spark, I'll go back to how things were.

571
00:36:43,544 --> 00:36:45,254
To being just your friend's little sister.

572
00:36:50,624 --> 00:36:54,324
You're making me say it, aren't you? You little hardhead.

573
00:36:54,594 --> 00:36:56,824
Yes, say it! Go on, say it.

574
00:36:57,194 --> 00:36:58,394
What is it?

575
00:37:00,164 --> 00:37:01,334
Su Bin.

576
00:37:02,964 --> 00:37:05,904
I've been married before.

577
00:37:09,474 --> 00:37:11,574
- What? - I'm divorced.

578
00:37:13,174 --> 00:37:14,584
Oh, come on.

579
00:37:14,684 --> 00:37:18,684
Ask Ji Hyuk later. He was my best man.

580
00:37:25,924 --> 00:37:27,994
Back when I was in ninth grade, during summer break?

581
00:37:28,694 --> 00:37:31,194
That time my brother came back from visiting you in the US...

582
00:37:31,334 --> 00:37:34,134
and brought me those gummies and stuff from Soul and Body Works.

583
00:37:35,464 --> 00:37:36,464
Was that when it was?

584
00:37:36,465 --> 00:37:39,234
None of our other friends know. It's a secret only Ji Hyuk knows.

585
00:37:46,474 --> 00:37:48,244
Sorry to spring this on you, but...

586
00:37:48,914 --> 00:37:50,014
so what do you say now?

587
00:37:55,484 --> 00:37:59,054
No way. A divorced man is a total deal-breaker for me.

588
00:38:01,124 --> 00:38:02,424
Okay. I get it.

589
00:38:02,794 --> 00:38:05,194
- Let's just forget it. I'm leaving. - No, let me take you home.

590
00:38:06,194 --> 00:38:09,104
No, it's fine. I can go by myself. I'm going. Bye.

591
00:38:16,204 --> 00:38:17,374
She's really something else.

592
00:38:18,414 --> 00:38:20,314
Man, is that how kids these days feel about divorce?

593
00:38:39,564 --> 00:38:41,704
Seriously, nothing is going my way.

594
00:38:42,104 --> 00:38:46,004
Why did Seong Jae marry at my age? When he was so young.

595
00:38:47,844 --> 00:38:48,844
Seriously...

596
00:38:49,574 --> 00:38:54,014
What I told you to memorize today will definitely be on the exam,

597
00:38:54,114 --> 00:38:57,714
so make sure you all know them. And before we wrap up,

598
00:38:57,784 --> 00:39:01,554
- the exam sign-up is closed now. - Yes.

599
00:39:01,654 --> 00:39:03,054
Who here signed up?

600
00:39:06,054 --> 00:39:09,563
The written exam is coming up soon, so please review past questions.

601
00:39:09,564 --> 00:39:13,233
I'll upload a practice test online, so please download and try it.

602
00:39:13,234 --> 00:39:15,104
- Okay. - See you all next time.

603
00:39:15,164 --> 00:39:16,634
- Thank you. - Thank you.

604
00:39:18,074 --> 00:39:20,233
- You registered for the test? - Yes.

605
00:39:20,234 --> 00:39:22,274
Gosh, you're jumping the gun a bit.

606
00:39:22,474 --> 00:39:24,874
I've failed it three times.

607
00:39:25,544 --> 00:39:26,974
Okay. So what?

608
00:39:27,174 --> 00:39:30,014
I take it you haven't heard how tough this exam is?

609
00:39:30,184 --> 00:39:32,414
We'll see about that.

610
00:39:45,994 --> 00:39:47,934
Where did Ji Hyuk's suitcase go?

611
00:39:49,964 --> 00:39:52,134
I wonder if Ji Wan took it.

612
00:39:58,874 --> 00:40:01,884
Thanks for continuing to be my bodyguard.

613
00:40:05,284 --> 00:40:07,353
Why aren't you saying anything?

614
00:40:07,354 --> 00:40:10,154
I'm just trying to focus...

615
00:40:11,224 --> 00:40:12,224
on my duties.

616
00:40:13,454 --> 00:40:15,323
Your duties?

617
00:40:15,324 --> 00:40:19,034
Look, I'd quit in a heartbeat, but now that I know your situation,

618
00:40:19,094 --> 00:40:20,594
I can't just quit,

619
00:40:21,064 --> 00:40:22,064
you see.

620
00:40:23,034 --> 00:40:25,134
We're sticking to our "Young Lady and Her Driver" roles.

621
00:40:25,474 --> 00:40:28,874
- No, you don't have to go that far. - I'm going that far.

622
00:40:29,304 --> 00:40:30,404
I mean,

623
00:40:30,804 --> 00:40:31,974
Ms. Park.

624
00:40:36,144 --> 00:40:37,244
I'm sorry,

625
00:40:37,954 --> 00:40:38,954
Ji Wan.

626
00:40:40,884 --> 00:40:44,154
I take it back. The "Young Lady and Driver" part.

627
00:41:01,574 --> 00:41:02,744
Stay put.

628
00:41:13,114 --> 00:41:14,254
Get out.

629
00:41:20,124 --> 00:41:21,124
Let's go.

630
00:41:34,644 --> 00:41:35,774
(Run!)

631
00:41:39,544 --> 00:41:41,484
(Screech)

632
00:41:42,544 --> 00:41:45,014
A zombie webtoon? That doesn't seem like her.

633
00:41:49,354 --> 00:41:53,124
- Who's that? Her boyfriend? - He's handsome.

634
00:41:53,354 --> 00:41:54,864
I'm her driver.

635
00:41:55,164 --> 00:41:56,864
I'm her driver, all right?

636
00:41:56,924 --> 00:41:59,394
A grad student with a bodyguard? Isn't that a little much?

637
00:41:59,464 --> 00:42:02,064
No, it is not. She has her reasons.

638
00:42:02,134 --> 00:42:04,104
So cut the snide remarks, okay?

639
00:42:05,674 --> 00:42:06,704
He's so cool.

640
00:42:07,204 --> 00:42:08,474
Shall we, Ms. Park?

641
00:42:31,534 --> 00:42:34,634
Hey, Park Yeong Ra. What webtoon was on your tablet?

642
00:42:34,734 --> 00:42:35,834
I've never seen it before.

643
00:42:36,164 --> 00:42:38,634
You went through my tablet? Without my permission?

644
00:42:38,704 --> 00:42:42,204
No. Your jacket was sticking out, so I saw it when I tucked it in.

645
00:42:42,274 --> 00:42:45,914
It's not like I was trying to snoop. Seriously, I only saw one webtoon.

646
00:42:46,114 --> 00:42:49,414
It was so good, I got sucked in. Your alarm snapped me out of it.

647
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:51,484
You what?

648
00:42:52,184 --> 00:42:55,724
Okay, fine. I'm sorry I went through your stuff.

649
00:42:55,824 --> 00:42:59,294
But where did you get it? Is the artist a friend of yours?

650
00:42:59,354 --> 00:43:02,294
Did they send you the file? It hasn't been released yet, right?

651
00:43:03,564 --> 00:43:04,564
What are you talking about?

652
00:43:04,634 --> 00:43:08,664
The one you were reading. "Take My Heart." That's the one.

653
00:43:08,864 --> 00:43:11,634
Where can I find it? I tried searching but found nothing.

654
00:43:12,874 --> 00:43:16,004
Can we just go? Why so curious about that?

655
00:43:16,074 --> 00:43:19,544
I'm curious because it's awesome! Seriously, it's incredible.

656
00:43:19,714 --> 00:43:20,744
It's so good.

657
00:43:21,184 --> 00:43:22,413
- It is? - Well...

658
00:43:22,414 --> 00:43:24,484
They're after the one they can't bite.

659
00:43:24,684 --> 00:43:27,484
So if they catch him, will they slice open his brain?

660
00:43:30,784 --> 00:43:31,794
I don't know.

661
00:43:31,854 --> 00:43:35,894
What do you mean? You have the file. There must be a next chapter, right?

662
00:43:37,424 --> 00:43:38,894
You really think it's that good?

663
00:43:39,734 --> 00:43:42,064
I'm dying to know what happens next.

664
00:43:44,234 --> 00:43:45,534
There is no next part.

665
00:43:46,904 --> 00:43:50,044
What do you mean there isn't? If your friend is the artist,

666
00:43:50,574 --> 00:43:54,684
they must have the rest of it. If not, tell me the artist's name.

667
00:43:55,884 --> 00:43:58,614
Aren't you going to drive? I need to get to my studio on time.

668
00:43:59,384 --> 00:44:00,884
If you don't tell me the name,

669
00:44:01,184 --> 00:44:02,354
I'm not driving.

670
00:44:02,884 --> 00:44:05,124
You're so petty, hiding every little thing.

671
00:44:09,764 --> 00:44:10,994
Well...

672
00:44:13,294 --> 00:44:14,834
I drew it.

673
00:44:16,334 --> 00:44:17,364
What?

674
00:44:18,904 --> 00:44:22,004
You have to promise me this will be our secret, okay?

675
00:44:22,874 --> 00:44:25,574
For real? You're the one who drew it?

676
00:44:37,854 --> 00:44:39,924
What in the world...

677
00:44:43,824 --> 00:44:44,834
Hey, you scared me!

678
00:44:45,834 --> 00:44:47,234
Why are you so jumpy?

679
00:44:47,904 --> 00:44:50,934
The light in your room was on, and my shoes are right by the door.

680
00:44:51,434 --> 00:44:54,704
I guess I was lost in thought and didn't notice.

681
00:44:57,914 --> 00:44:58,914
Thinking about what?

682
00:44:59,574 --> 00:45:00,714
Ji Hyuk's suitcase?

683
00:45:01,044 --> 00:45:02,044
What?

684
00:45:02,214 --> 00:45:05,714
You're the one who brought Ji Hyuk that suitcase full of his clothes.

685
00:45:07,184 --> 00:45:08,184
What? Me?

686
00:45:08,484 --> 00:45:09,754
That's what Ji Hyuk told me.

687
00:45:10,084 --> 00:45:12,324
Oh, so he called?

688
00:45:13,254 --> 00:45:14,494
I knew it was you.

689
00:45:15,324 --> 00:45:16,394
Where's Ji Hyuk?

690
00:45:16,794 --> 00:45:17,794
Mom.

691
00:45:18,064 --> 00:45:19,134
Come on, Mom.

692
00:45:19,664 --> 00:45:21,094
Mom, you're jumping to conclusions, aren't you?

693
00:45:21,304 --> 00:45:23,134
I asked you. Where is Ji Hyuk?

694
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:25,474
I don't know.

695
00:45:26,204 --> 00:45:27,204
Lee Ji Wan.

696
00:45:28,174 --> 00:45:30,174
I have absolutely no idea where he is.

697
00:45:31,644 --> 00:45:34,884
And Mom, I completely understand where he's coming from,

698
00:45:35,144 --> 00:45:37,784
so I think we should wait and just give him some time.

699
00:45:38,154 --> 00:45:39,154
Wait for what?

700
00:45:39,654 --> 00:45:40,654
Well...

701
00:45:41,224 --> 00:45:43,224
Gosh, this is ridiculous.

702
00:45:58,204 --> 00:45:59,804
Hey, why are you just standing there?

703
00:46:01,134 --> 00:46:03,044
Oh, come on in.

704
00:46:14,054 --> 00:46:17,754
What's going on? Why the long face?

705
00:46:20,224 --> 00:46:22,894
Honey, don't be surprised.

706
00:46:23,694 --> 00:46:24,964
Apparently, Ji Hyuk is in Seoul.

707
00:46:28,734 --> 00:46:32,474
He's supposedly starting a business and staying in a warehouse.

708
00:46:33,774 --> 00:46:34,774
So what?

709
00:46:35,604 --> 00:46:38,914
What do you mean, "So what?" We have to bring him home.

710
00:46:39,044 --> 00:46:41,244
Bring him home? He's not a kid.

711
00:46:41,984 --> 00:46:44,344
That's exactly why we have to drag him home.

712
00:46:45,184 --> 00:46:48,154
He must be embarrassed too. How can he just show up on his own?

713
00:46:49,084 --> 00:46:51,954
As his parents, we must be the ones to reach out.

714
00:46:52,324 --> 00:46:54,124
Imagine what a state he must be in.

715
00:46:54,594 --> 00:46:57,164
He's doing just fine on his own, so just leave him be.

716
00:46:57,394 --> 00:46:58,434
Doing fine? Yes, right.

717
00:47:01,094 --> 00:47:02,234
What's with your tone?

718
00:47:03,034 --> 00:47:04,404
You knew about this, didn't you?

719
00:47:05,234 --> 00:47:06,274
I saw him once.

720
00:47:07,204 --> 00:47:08,204
You met him?

721
00:47:08,774 --> 00:47:12,344
No, I just saw him on the street. He didn't see me, though.

722
00:47:13,074 --> 00:47:14,074
Unbelievable!

723
00:47:14,684 --> 00:47:16,484
You saw him, and you just ignored him?

724
00:47:17,344 --> 00:47:20,414
And you didn't say a word to me? When you knew how worried I was?

725
00:47:22,054 --> 00:47:24,454
If you saw him, you should've dragged him back here!

726
00:47:24,824 --> 00:47:28,994
How could you see him after so long and just ignore him? Some father.

727
00:47:29,094 --> 00:47:31,934
It's not that I ignored him. I couldn't get a word out.

728
00:47:32,234 --> 00:47:33,964
He looked like he was doing fine without us.

729
00:47:34,804 --> 00:47:35,804
What did you just say?

730
00:47:36,464 --> 00:47:39,774
Even if you find out where he is, don't think of bringing him back.

731
00:47:40,934 --> 00:47:44,174
- This... - I don't want him back. I don't.

732
00:47:47,174 --> 00:47:48,184
What's he going on about?

733
00:47:51,414 --> 00:47:54,214
Oh, I give up.

734
00:48:00,324 --> 00:48:01,394
Fold it this way,

735
00:48:02,494 --> 00:48:05,034
and then this way.

736
00:48:05,964 --> 00:48:08,834
Do you really mean that?

737
00:48:09,834 --> 00:48:11,534
You don't want Ji Hyuk to come home?

738
00:48:12,204 --> 00:48:13,304
You really don't?

739
00:48:13,634 --> 00:48:16,704
You heard me. Why do you keep asking?

740
00:48:17,244 --> 00:48:19,074
Because I don't understand.

741
00:48:19,444 --> 00:48:22,444
No matter how much he's let us down, he's still our son.

742
00:48:24,784 --> 00:48:26,214
Maybe you can,

743
00:48:26,954 --> 00:48:28,884
but I can't forgive him. No, I mean,

744
00:48:29,284 --> 00:48:30,454
I can't accept it.

745
00:48:31,454 --> 00:48:33,724
He said, "I was only getting married because of you, Father."

746
00:48:33,794 --> 00:48:36,664
"I was only marrying a rich woman because of you."

747
00:48:36,794 --> 00:48:41,504
He drove a dagger through my heart. And he never regrets his choices.

748
00:48:43,004 --> 00:48:45,604
I'll never be able to forget that, honey.

749
00:48:47,134 --> 00:48:48,144
Ji Hyuk...

750
00:48:48,944 --> 00:48:50,604
never said it was your fault.

751
00:48:51,944 --> 00:48:53,244
That rotten kid.

752
00:49:02,724 --> 00:49:07,254
You and I were worried he was holed up in a cheap room,

753
00:49:07,594 --> 00:49:10,023
living on cup noodles and drinking all day,

754
00:49:10,024 --> 00:49:11,564
like a total wreck.

755
00:49:11,934 --> 00:49:14,233
Though we were mad, we were so worried...

756
00:49:14,234 --> 00:49:15,964
that we couldn't even sleep.

757
00:49:17,004 --> 00:49:21,744
But he was doing just fine. He was dressed sharp and smiling.

758
00:49:22,144 --> 00:49:23,304
And I'm supposed to just go up to him?

759
00:49:24,374 --> 00:49:28,484
If he'd looked messy and defeated, I'd have grabbed him right away.

760
00:49:29,814 --> 00:49:32,314
But I couldn't.

761
00:49:34,254 --> 00:49:37,424
I was just too ashamed to say anything. You know?

762
00:49:37,954 --> 00:49:40,793
How do I stop him when he's so proud?

763
00:49:40,794 --> 00:49:42,094
What would I even say to him?

764
00:49:43,864 --> 00:49:46,964
Apparently, he said he's starting a business.

765
00:49:47,494 --> 00:49:48,504
A business?

766
00:49:49,234 --> 00:49:54,134
No wonder he looked so prosperous. In just a few months.

767
00:49:54,604 --> 00:49:56,874
Well, good for him, then. Right?

768
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:59,374
He was always talking about moving out anyway.

769
00:49:59,674 --> 00:50:01,174
He said he hated living here.

770
00:50:01,584 --> 00:50:02,684
Don't you remember?

771
00:50:04,484 --> 00:50:05,814
He told Ji Wan...

772
00:50:06,314 --> 00:50:08,754
that he wanted to come back after becoming successful.

773
00:50:09,724 --> 00:50:11,454
Tell him to save it. All right?

774
00:50:11,894 --> 00:50:15,524
His success is for his own good. When did we ever ask for his money?

775
00:50:16,194 --> 00:50:17,294
What does "success" even mean?

776
00:50:17,864 --> 00:50:19,864
That's just how his mind works.

777
00:50:20,164 --> 00:50:24,834
He thinks if he makes lots of money, we'll be falling all over him.

778
00:50:25,334 --> 00:50:29,004
That's why he resented me so much and why he looks down on me.

779
00:50:29,444 --> 00:50:32,144
Even if he comes crawling back, I swear I'll kick him back out.

780
00:50:32,774 --> 00:50:35,414
Mother will hear you. Keep your voice down.

781
00:50:35,744 --> 00:50:36,744
Goodness.

782
00:50:37,014 --> 00:50:38,254
What's gotten into you?

783
00:50:39,514 --> 00:50:41,954
I'll check in on Mother and then go study.

784
00:50:42,024 --> 00:50:43,024
I have to study for my exam.

785
00:50:48,124 --> 00:50:49,564
Ji Hyuk was smiling?

786
00:50:55,004 --> 00:50:56,064
Yes.

787
00:50:56,664 --> 00:50:58,904
Okay, please be on time tomorrow.

788
00:50:59,474 --> 00:51:00,474
Okay.

789
00:51:04,204 --> 00:51:06,014
(Director Ko Seong Hui)

790
00:51:07,444 --> 00:51:08,444
Yes, Director Ko.

791
00:51:09,444 --> 00:51:13,354
Ms. Ji, would you be free today? Around 8pm today.

792
00:51:14,214 --> 00:51:15,284
Today?

793
00:51:16,354 --> 00:51:18,624
I know it's not right to keep you waiting any longer,

794
00:51:18,924 --> 00:51:20,794
but I just happened to have an opening today.

795
00:51:21,424 --> 00:51:23,994
I was wondering if we could at least have a quick meeting.

796
00:51:24,394 --> 00:51:25,894
Yes, today works for me.

797
00:51:26,494 --> 00:51:28,364
What time and where should I be?

798
00:51:29,104 --> 00:51:33,534
We've always met outside before to see different studio styles.

799
00:51:34,004 --> 00:51:37,674
Since the timing is awkward today, how about you come to my office?

800
00:51:38,974 --> 00:51:43,184
Yes, of course. I'll be at Gaon Foundation by 8pm.

801
00:51:50,884 --> 00:51:52,354
Here it is.

802
00:51:54,554 --> 00:51:55,794
- Mom. - Eun Oh!

803
00:51:55,864 --> 00:51:56,864
Feed me.

804
00:51:57,264 --> 00:51:59,534
My meeting got pushed back, so I had a free hour and stopped by.

805
00:51:59,594 --> 00:52:02,104
Just sit tight. I'll bring you some right away.

806
00:52:02,204 --> 00:52:03,204
Mom.

807
00:52:03,634 --> 00:52:06,274
The owner's daughter has to serve herself.

808
00:52:06,934 --> 00:52:07,934
I'll get it.

809
00:52:11,914 --> 00:52:12,914
Thank you for the meal.

810
00:52:12,974 --> 00:52:15,314
- Yes, thank you. Have a good day. - Bye.

811
00:52:15,384 --> 00:52:16,384
You too. Thank you.

812
00:52:18,714 --> 00:52:20,884
Eat up. What else can I get you?

813
00:52:20,954 --> 00:52:23,084
No, I'm stuffed, Mom. Besides, I have to go.

814
00:52:23,324 --> 00:52:24,994
- Already? - Excuse me.

815
00:52:25,354 --> 00:52:27,224
Are you Gang Oh's mother?

816
00:52:28,894 --> 00:52:29,894
Yes, I am.

817
00:52:29,964 --> 00:52:32,234
We're friends of Gang Oh's from high school.

818
00:52:32,564 --> 00:52:35,004
Gang Oh mentioned you run a Korean BBQ place around here.

819
00:52:35,534 --> 00:52:38,034
I think I remember seeing you at school back in the day.

820
00:52:38,134 --> 00:52:41,944
Really? Oh, my goodness! So nice to see you. Please sit down.

821
00:52:42,944 --> 00:52:47,474
His mom runs a place like this, so why's he working at a pickup bar?

822
00:52:49,784 --> 00:52:53,014
- Mom, I'm off. I'm late. - Okay.

823
00:52:53,984 --> 00:52:55,454
A pickup bar?

824
00:52:55,984 --> 00:52:57,654
Where is that?

825
00:52:58,354 --> 00:53:01,424
It's called Couples' Bar, over in Hongdae.

826
00:53:04,224 --> 00:53:05,894
Okay. And...

827
00:53:07,064 --> 00:53:08,064
Here you go.

828
00:53:12,204 --> 00:53:15,004
Ms. Ji, you're a real hard worker.

829
00:53:15,744 --> 00:53:17,904
Until the artists have been selected,

830
00:53:17,974 --> 00:53:20,744
you could've just worked with some vague ideas.

831
00:53:21,684 --> 00:53:26,554
You mentioned 2 painters and 1 for stationery or home goods.

832
00:53:26,714 --> 00:53:29,954
So I was working on two versions based on that.

833
00:53:30,384 --> 00:53:31,584
That's right.

834
00:53:32,024 --> 00:53:33,794
You're so ahead of the game.

835
00:53:34,124 --> 00:53:35,294
It's unbelievable.

836
00:53:35,994 --> 00:53:39,094
We'd all but settled on two artists, a painter and an illustrator,

837
00:53:39,534 --> 00:53:42,564
but one is under investigation for drug use.

838
00:53:43,404 --> 00:53:44,534
What now?

839
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:46,274
We have to start over with a new list.

840
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:51,344
So that's what happened.

841
00:53:51,744 --> 00:53:53,414
Life's just so complicated, isn't it?

842
00:53:55,644 --> 00:53:58,114
I do like this layout,

843
00:53:59,184 --> 00:54:02,624
but we might only have one painter and an artist from another genre.

844
00:54:03,324 --> 00:54:07,624
Let's use this as a baseline, but pause until my side is sorted.

845
00:54:07,794 --> 00:54:09,124
Will you do that for me?

846
00:54:10,794 --> 00:54:11,794
But...

847
00:54:12,634 --> 00:54:15,634
if we do that, the studio space will just be sitting empty.

848
00:54:16,264 --> 00:54:18,304
So that's what you were worried about.

849
00:54:19,774 --> 00:54:21,504
Don't worry about that.

850
00:54:21,774 --> 00:54:24,904
What's more important to us...

851
00:54:24,974 --> 00:54:26,944
is making sure we support truly deserving artists.

852
00:54:29,484 --> 00:54:33,654
Okay. Then I'll wait for your decision.

853
00:54:34,254 --> 00:54:36,084
I'll pause all work on the floor plans until then.

854
00:54:36,684 --> 00:54:37,754
Sounds good.

855
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:41,254
You can focus on your other projects in the meantime.

856
00:54:43,424 --> 00:54:44,964
Understood.

857
00:54:56,474 --> 00:54:59,974
One moment, Ms. Ji. Please have a seat.

858
00:55:16,724 --> 00:55:17,724
Here you go.

859
00:55:22,404 --> 00:55:24,034
It's a calming candy.

860
00:55:24,764 --> 00:55:26,434
"Calming candy?"

861
00:55:26,974 --> 00:55:27,974
Not really.

862
00:55:28,644 --> 00:55:32,873
It's just a name I made up. I eat one when I'm feeling sad...

863
00:55:32,874 --> 00:55:35,284
or down because of old memories that resurface.

864
00:55:35,584 --> 00:55:37,014
It actually cheers me up.

865
00:55:39,354 --> 00:55:40,354
Okay.

866
00:55:42,284 --> 00:55:44,754
I can't. I just can't hold it in.

867
00:55:45,454 --> 00:55:47,824
Just tell me everything, Eun Oh.

868
00:55:49,294 --> 00:55:50,294
Pardon?

869
00:55:51,224 --> 00:55:54,594
Is that thing that was bothering you still not resolved?

870
00:55:55,804 --> 00:55:57,004
No, that's not it.

871
00:55:57,534 --> 00:56:01,774
This is different from before. How can someone so young be so hurt?

872
00:56:02,444 --> 00:56:05,274
You seem so bright on the outside, but you're completely hollowed out.

873
00:56:05,344 --> 00:56:06,344
That's how you seem today.

874
00:56:09,084 --> 00:56:10,084
That's not it.

875
00:56:10,444 --> 00:56:12,884
I think I'm just a little tired.

876
00:56:13,414 --> 00:56:14,914
I'm so sorry for worrying you.

877
00:56:15,624 --> 00:56:18,424
I really am. I'll be leaving now.

878
00:56:19,194 --> 00:56:20,824
What if I told you...

879
00:56:21,494 --> 00:56:23,964
my own buried secret?

880
00:56:25,194 --> 00:56:26,194
How does that sound?

881
00:56:32,834 --> 00:56:36,904
I have a daughter I lost.

882
00:56:40,244 --> 00:56:41,444
No one knows.

883
00:56:41,814 --> 00:56:42,814
No one but me.

884
00:56:51,054 --> 00:56:52,294
A tragic story, isn't it?

885
00:56:54,024 --> 00:56:57,164
Can you imagine what it's been like for me, living with that?

886
00:57:00,864 --> 00:57:01,864
Director Ko...

887
00:57:06,134 --> 00:57:07,534
But it's so strange.

888
00:57:08,474 --> 00:57:11,844
This secret... It's a massive one, isn't it?

889
00:57:13,414 --> 00:57:16,084
And yet, why am I telling you of all people?

890
00:57:17,344 --> 00:57:20,484
Is it because you looked so empty inside today, like a ghost?

891
00:57:29,324 --> 00:57:30,324
I...

892
00:57:32,134 --> 00:57:34,694
I don't know my birth parents.

893
00:57:41,674 --> 00:57:43,374
But that's not what bothers me.

894
00:57:46,844 --> 00:57:47,844
But...

895
00:57:48,844 --> 00:57:51,414
my younger brother just found out that I was adopted.

896
00:57:55,384 --> 00:57:57,154
He says he doesn't see me as family anymore.

897
00:57:59,524 --> 00:58:01,124
Oh, my goodness.

898
00:58:06,094 --> 00:58:09,464
So that's what's been scaring you, Eun Oh.

899
00:58:10,434 --> 00:58:12,774
I'm so scared he won't come back.

900
00:58:13,804 --> 00:58:15,574
I'm worried about my mom,

901
00:58:19,944 --> 00:58:24,884
and I keep wondering if I really did steal his place in the family.

902
00:58:25,914 --> 00:58:28,284
Until my dad's business failed,

903
00:58:29,384 --> 00:58:31,254
we were actually pretty well-off.

904
00:58:45,934 --> 00:58:48,504
Did your parents make you feel that way?

905
00:58:49,944 --> 00:58:51,474
No, not at all.

906
00:58:53,014 --> 00:58:57,744
Even after I learned I was adopted, I wondered about my birth parents,

907
00:58:58,344 --> 00:58:59,884
but I never missed them.

908
00:59:01,484 --> 00:59:04,654
My mom and dad are my parents.

909
00:59:09,164 --> 00:59:10,594
You're so mature.

910
00:59:14,194 --> 00:59:16,234
I grew up with a lot of love.

911
00:59:19,574 --> 00:59:21,504
Then I guess you'll just have to wait.

912
00:59:23,174 --> 00:59:27,114
After all, those loving parents are his birth parents too.

913
00:59:27,374 --> 00:59:31,784
So your brother is probably a lot like you.

914
00:59:33,284 --> 00:59:34,384
Just be patient.

915
00:59:39,624 --> 00:59:40,824
You think so?

916
01:00:08,884 --> 01:00:11,824
(Bus Stop, Gaon Foundation)

917
01:00:34,274 --> 01:00:36,214
Hello. Welcome.

918
01:00:36,284 --> 01:00:37,344
- Hello. - You can take this table.

919
01:00:38,544 --> 01:00:41,784
It's called Couples' Bar, over in Hongdae.

920
01:01:05,374 --> 01:01:08,844
Mom. My birth mother wouldn't be like this.

921
01:01:10,414 --> 01:01:13,384
Gang Oh, I'm sorry.

922
01:01:13,914 --> 01:01:14,954
Is it me or Ji Eun Oh?

923
01:01:17,284 --> 01:01:18,484
It's Eun Oh.

924
01:01:19,254 --> 01:01:20,354
My daughter.

925
01:01:26,064 --> 01:01:28,164
(Couples' Bar)

926
01:02:14,844 --> 01:02:18,184
Your offer to be partners. Is that still on the table?

927
01:02:20,354 --> 01:02:21,684
At this hour?

928
01:02:22,354 --> 01:02:23,784
I have to go to the Mapo site.

929
01:02:26,024 --> 01:02:27,024
Eun Oh.

930
01:02:28,024 --> 01:02:29,894
Ms. Ji Eun Oh.

931
01:02:32,864 --> 01:02:34,894
Fine, Ms. Ji Eun Oh.

932
01:02:35,294 --> 01:02:38,434
You came all this way to say yes? At this hour?

933
01:02:39,204 --> 01:02:40,874
So, are you in or out?

934
01:02:46,074 --> 01:02:47,074
I'm in.

935
01:02:47,474 --> 01:02:48,474
Let's do it.

936
01:02:50,084 --> 01:02:52,784
I have some conditions. Three, to be exact.

937
01:02:53,654 --> 01:02:57,284
If you accept my conditions and we get them notarized,

938
01:02:57,924 --> 01:02:58,954
then we have a deal.

939
01:03:01,594 --> 01:03:02,594
Notarized?

940
01:03:45,404 --> 01:03:48,074
(Our Golden Days)

941
01:03:48,734 --> 01:03:50,844
Aren't you going too far? What am I, your servant?

942
01:03:50,904 --> 01:03:52,443
Looks like you'll be one for a while.

943
01:03:52,444 --> 01:03:53,514
Since your mom isn't giving you money.

944
01:03:53,574 --> 01:03:58,544
Did I just hear you right? This is your only webtoon?

945
01:03:58,644 --> 01:04:01,184
Look. I can't do it.

946
01:04:01,354 --> 01:04:02,684
They say I'm not qualified.

947
01:04:02,754 --> 01:04:07,224
Forging papers to meet a guy. Should I let you become a criminal?

948
01:04:07,294 --> 01:04:09,794
No, not gukbap. I don't like it.

949
01:04:09,864 --> 01:04:11,524
Why is Ji Hyuk being so formal with you?

950
01:04:11,764 --> 01:04:13,334
It's like he only sees you as a business partner.

951
01:04:13,434 --> 01:04:16,264
What am I doing? She's not my junior anymore.
