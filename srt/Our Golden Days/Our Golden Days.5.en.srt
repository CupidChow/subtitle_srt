1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,140
- You're getting married?
- You're getting married?

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:06,640
Who to?

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,980
She's right, Ji Hyuk.
Who exactly are you marrying?

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,250
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,750
Everyone, just zip it.

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,820
Let Ji Hyuk talk.

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,230
Have you been seeing someone?

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,460
- That's right.
- Hold on.

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,230
Was there someone
you were serious about marrying,

10
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:27,870
not just dating?

11
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:30,240
Why did you tell us differently
last time?

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,500
You said you weren't dating anyone,

13
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,740
had no one to marry,

14
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:33,940
and weren't interested in marriage.

15
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,410
You said that as you announced
you were moving out.

16
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,240
I'm moving out.

17
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,610
There's no one I like.

18
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:41,510
I don't plan on getting married.

19
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,420
I had my reasons back then.

20
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,320
What reasons?

21
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,890
As if you need to know about
your son's love life in detail.

22
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,820
I'm not trying to pry.

23
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,360
It just doesn't make sense.

24
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,360
It's natural for a parent
to be curious.

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,130
Can you just let it slide?

26
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,830
You wanted me to get married.

27
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:01,370
Exactly.

28
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,170
Why should his past words matter...

29
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,740
now that he's decided to marry?

30
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,770
How can you expect us to meet
her family the day after tomorrow?

31
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,840
Is your fiancee
coming to see us tomorrow?

32
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,750
You'll meet her
when you meet her family.

33
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,750
Ji Hyuk, what's the deal
with her family?

34
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,450
I bet they're not
your average household.

35
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,990
I bet they disapproved of you
at first.

36
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,620
Hey, that actually makes sense.

37
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,760
Ji Hyuk, is that it?

38
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:27,990
Is she right?

39
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:29,730
Did they disapprove of you at first?

40
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,730
Yes.

41
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:34,100
Who's her father?

42
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,870
She's the daughter
of Haneul Construction's CEO,

43
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:38,900
and she's an only child.

44
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,640
- Haneul Construction?
- Haneul Construction?

45
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,170
Haneul Construction,
as in the company...

46
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,340
that built the apartment complex
behind the subway station?

47
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,050
That's right, Mom.

48
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,680
Let me get this straight.

49
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,480
Haneul Construction's CEO
was first against...

50
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,920
you marrying his only daughter.

51
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,120
So why did he change his mind?

52
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,390
No, answer this first.

53
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,120
Why didn't you...

54
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,660
ever tell us there was someone...

55
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,390
you wanted to marry?

56
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,630
It's all in the past.

57
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,930
Why are you being so secretive?

58
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,100
Why won't you tell us anything?

59
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,140
We need to understand
your situation...

60
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,010
to give you our approval.

61
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,910
I'm not asking...

62
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,580
for permission to marry.

63
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,180
I'm making a request.

64
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,280
I'm asking for your help
so that I can marry her.

65
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,320
When you're not even letting us see
this precious rich girl's face?

66
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,890
Is that it?

67
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,490
Is this your idea or hers?

68
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,130
You'll meet her
when you meet her family,

69
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:36,430
and we're getting married
no matter what.

70
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,460
Lee Ji Hyuk!

71
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,400
That's enough.

72
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,930
You caught your father off guard
with this sudden news,

73
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,870
so don't be on edge yourself.
Head upstairs.

74
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,610
There's nothing more to hear.

75
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:52,910
What I said just now
is all there is.

76
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,120
When did he get into
such a serious relationship?

77
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,020
Can you believe this?

78
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:05,020
Ji Hyuk's always kept us
at arm's length.

79
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,020
Always.

80
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,230
Still,

81
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,330
how could he not let it show
that he was rejected?

82
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,130
I'm going to my room.

83
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,270
What a relief.

84
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,400
Dad's jobless,

85
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,700
but Ji Hyuk will marry
into a rich family.

86
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,170
Wait, are they semi-rich?

87
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,470
I can finally feel confident again.

88
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:29,680
What a relief.

89
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,420
Now that Ji Hyuk
has everyone's attention,

90
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,520
I can relax a bit.

91
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,120
When was he
in a passionate relationship...

92
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,590
with the daughter
of Haneul Construction's CEO?

93
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,930
Until recently,
he seemed to be dating a girl...

94
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,430
from his sports club.

95
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,800
Were they already broken up?

96
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,030
That secretive brat.

97
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:52,100
He wasn't being secretive.

98
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,340
Of course, he didn't want to tell us
that they disapproved of him.

99
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,940
Why would he want the entire family
to know that?

100
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,880
I know he's my son,

101
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,350
but it's becoming impossible
to read him.

102
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,020
There isn't a parent
who can read their grown children.

103
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,120
Especially with sons.

104
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,920
Still, how could he just
spring this on us?

105
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,490
He should've at least told us...

106
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:15,060
before setting the date
to meet her family.

107
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,730
Doesn't he respect us
as his parents?

108
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,100
Could he be...

109
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,600
doing as he's told
by that rich family?

110
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,770
The girl must've rushed
the wedding...

111
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,740
while she had her dad's approval.

112
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,270
Exactly.

113
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,240
Tell Ji Hyuk to come down.

114
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,580
Would you rather
break off this engagement?

115
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,820
Nowadays, you don't call...

116
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,350
your children's future spouses over
just to judge them.

117
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,090
How can we move forward...

118
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,590
without even
being introduced to her first?

119
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:46,490
We agreed to accept anyone
our children bring home to marry.

120
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,990
Why are you suddenly going back
on your word?

121
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,930
This feels disrespectful
and isn't how it should be done.

122
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,470
Let's just follow his lead.

123
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,440
They're probably
rushing the wedding...

124
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,140
before her father changes his mind.

125
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,880
If you don't like his fiancee
after meeting her,

126
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,580
call off the wedding.

127
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,820
Call it off?

128
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,380
As if you ever could.

129
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,220
It's not even your own wedding.

130
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,350
That brat.

131
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,220
He'd better be marrying someone
who's just as good as his mom.

132
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,460
If not, I'll definitely call it off.

133
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,530
Where are you going?

134
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,760
I'm taking a walk around the block.

135
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,720
Once I finish this,
I'm calling it a day.

136
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,090
We need to boil all the dishcloths
to get them clean.

137
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:57,900
Hey.

138
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,100
Today's not the day
to boil dishcloths,

139
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,130
nor to deep clean.

140
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,170
I never said
we were doing a deep clean.

141
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,980
As if I would let you do this
all by yourself.

142
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,280
Did you seriously come over here
to confront me?

143
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:21,550
No, I simply forgot
to grab the duster.

144
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,390
I know it's not easy to forget a guy
you crushed on for six years.

145
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,160
That's not it.

146
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,900
I just want to start fresh.

147
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:36,930
It's been a while,
but I just got a new job request.

148
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,300
And the project's quite big.

149
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,070
I'll boil the dishcloths.

150
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,010
The project hasn't
even been confirmed yet.

151
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:48,610
Fine. Keep your mind busy
down to the last second.

152
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,580
Darn it.

(Size, design space, users,
gallery, store)

157
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,930
I guess you could call it
a space for art and design.

158
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,700
I was planning something like that.

159
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,240
Is it a place
related to a sponsorship project?

160
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:50,340
Don't start on it ahead of time.

161
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,780
You know, 90 percent of people
ask for a quote and then ghost you.

162
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,480
I have a feeling
that she will call me.

163
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,690
I was such a fool
and didn't ask what it was for.

164
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,920
Is it a gallery, a store,
or a multi-purpose space?

165
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:05,890
Hey, by the way,

166
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,530
Ji Hyuk is not coming.

167
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,960
It's been over a week.

168
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,760
Well...

169
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,430
Do you think it's because
I yelled at him the other day?

170
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,740
I think he's just busy.

171
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:21,510
We have a customer.

172
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,470
Hey, answer the phone.

Yes, that works.

177
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,550
What time
and where should I meet you?

178
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:41,130
Okay, I will. Bye.

00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,660
Thanks.

181
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,030
That's what you should wear.

182
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,610
Mom has nothing to wear.

183
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,180
Seriously, Ji Hyuk scheduled
the family meeting too soon.

184
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,510
First impressions matter.

185
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,310
Your mom will choose
what she wants to wear.

186
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,650
She has nothing to choose from.

187
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,690
She doesn't have anything
for formal occasions.

188
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,020
I have clothes for formal occasions.

189
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,590
This one.

190
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:17,860
That's too somber.

191
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,230
Don't you have anything else?

192
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,500
No, this is
the only formal outfit I have.

193
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,140
Mother looks great in her hanbok.

194
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,180
Mom, Grandma. Sit in the back seat.

195
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,780
Dad, you sit in the front.

196
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,690
You two will take my car.

197
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:44,690
Let's go, Grandma.

198
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,060
Let's go.

199
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,350
Nice to meet you, Father.

200
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,120
I'm Jung Bo A.

201
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,850
I see. Nice to meet you.

202
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,930
Nice to meet you,
Grandmother and Mother.

203
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,490
I'm Jung Bo A.

204
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,560
So you are Ji Hyuk's bride-to-be.

205
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,730
Nice to meet you.

206
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,000
She's beautiful.

207
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,400
Bo A, they are my siblings.

208
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,010
Ji Wan and Su Bin?

209
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,480
I hope we get along well.

210
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,540
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

211
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:41,850
Let's go in.

212
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,050
Let's go.

213
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,690
I apologize...

214
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,990
for scheduling this
on such short notice.

215
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,170
I'm embarrassed and sorry
to tell you this,

216
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,640
but we've already set
the wedding date.

217
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,910
It's supposed to be
an auspicious day.

218
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:17,380
Since he's a businessman,
he can't ignore stuff like that.

219
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,720
I'm really sorry.

220
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:21,720
Then...

221
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,460
when did you schedule
the wedding for?

222
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,430
It's in two weeks.

223
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,860
- In two weeks?
- They would need...

224
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:35,670
at least two months
to find a place to live.

225
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:39,570
Bo A has an apartment in her name.

226
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,140
They can start
their married life there.

227
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,910
- She owns an apartment.
- And my wife...

228
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,380
has already prepared
all the household goods,

229
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,180
so there's nothing to buy.

230
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,820
We ask for your understanding.

231
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,520
Then,

232
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:57,690
what do we need to prepare?

233
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,460
Nothing.

234
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,630
Ji Hyuk worked
for one of our business partners,

235
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:07,030
so we already knew
he was excellent at his job.

236
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,200
Since we are in a similar industry,

237
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,900
I can have him
look after my company,

238
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,370
which gives me peace of mind.

239
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,040
Look after your company?

240
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:21,410
Once Ji Hyuk returns
from his honeymoon,

241
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:24,080
he'll start as the director
of the Planning Department.

242
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,920
After spending six months there,

243
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,650
he will take on
the role of executive director.

244
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,460
I need him
to take over my job quickly.

245
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,330
Well...

246
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,130
- Oh, my.
- For us,

247
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,900
everything about this marriage
is going too fast.

248
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:46,300
We are still overwhelmed
and don't know what to say.

249
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,610
Sure. I understand.

250
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,280
And I feel bad.

251
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,680
With that in mind,
we will take care of everything.

252
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,920
So all you need to do...

253
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,720
is attend the wedding.

254
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,140
Oh, dear.

255
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,310
I was really surprised earlier.

256
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,640
You held back and didn't get angry.

257
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:29,780
Didn't it hurt your pride?

258
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,880
He must love Bo A a lot.

259
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,420
He says he'll stay single
if he can't marry her.

260
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,560
My pride doesn't even matter.

261
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,230
You're right.

262
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,130
Ji Hyuk must really like her.

263
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,800
I know.

264
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,500
Now that he's marrying
the woman he loves so much,

265
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,500
he must be happy.

266
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,040
I'm going out.

267
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,010
Are you going to a meeting?

268
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,510
Yes.

269
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,750
Ji Hyuk, about the other day...

270
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,850
I'll have a beer.

271
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,920
Okay.

272
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:19,600
Hey. What does
having just one beer mean?

273
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:23,470
A beer in the daytime?
I guess he's trying to kill time.

274
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:27,200
To kill time?

275
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:29,140
Was there a big complaint or what?

276
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,360
She's finally pulled
herself together.

277
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:48,090
That's good.

278
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:54,770
I wish it would be about 330m²,

279
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,170
but the foundation's budget
is limited.

280
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:00,340
You told me on our way here...

281
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,810
that you wanted this place
to be a gallery, a studio,

282
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,780
and even a store.

283
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,540
Have you decided
who will be moving in?

284
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,710
How many people will use this space?

285
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:11,820
Will there be regular users?
Or will it be an open studio?

286
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,820
You are quite enthusiastic
about your work.

287
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:18,420
Knowing the client's plans...

288
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,920
and thoughts helps me
design a place better.

289
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,990
We are accepting applications.

290
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,760
The foundation
will select the applicants...

291
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,230
who seem most in need.

292
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,070
I think it would be nice
to have a variety of genres.

293
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,010
And I'd like you
to make the decision.

294
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,910
It would be boring
if we only had painters here.

295
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,150
What do you want me to decide?

296
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,310
Within the art category,

297
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:46,050
I want to accept young artists
working with various mediums.

298
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,420
Painting, watercolor, sculpture,
installation art...

299
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,390
Oh, right. And there's design.

300
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,990
You're young,
and you're an interior designer.

301
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,230
I see.

302
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,300
I guess you're planning...

303
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:02,570
to turn this place
into a truly unique space.

304
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,670
That's the idea for now.

305
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,740
I'm not sure
if it'll turn out that way, though.

306
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:08,710
That's so cool.

307
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,280
A space for young artists?

308
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,610
Let's talk more about it
over dinner.

309
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:17,750
Okay.

310
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,420
I'll have warm water, please.

311
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:22,450
Yes, ma'am.

312
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,520
Before I forget...

313
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,660
Here. This is the key to the store.

314
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:31,800
What?

315
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:34,500
We haven't signed the contract yet.

316
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:36,270
Giving you the key
is how I seal the deal.

317
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,040
You can sign the contract
after we talk more about it,

318
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,310
and once the budget is finalized...

319
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,440
May 1, 2025.

320
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,480
At 5:50pm.

321
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,510
The location is Posetta Restaurant.

322
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:52,750
I, Ko Seong Hui, request Ji Eun Oh,
the CEO of Eunoism Design,

323
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,150
to handle the interior design
of a 264m² commercial space...

324
00:16:56,150 --> 00:17:00,220
located on the 2nd floor
of 48-4 Yeonnam-dong.

325
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,690
The total budget is 200,000 dollars.

326
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:05,230
There should be a space
where two people can sleep...

327
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,760
and a small office pantry.

328
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,530
Separate restrooms
for men and women.

329
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,840
A sofa set in the lounge area
would be nice.

330
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,570
This is all I want.

331
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,670
It would be nice...

332
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,910
if they could sell their work
while working there.

333
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,840
This is what I've thought about.

334
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:24,110
I'd like you to figure out
how to carry out the plan.

335
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,650
Sure. I'll do that.

336
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:31,960
Then how long
will the construction period be?

337
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,430
When are you planning
to open the place?

338
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,060
How much would you charge
for the design?

339
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:39,030
Oh, right. We usually...

340
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:41,900
take seven percent of the total cost
as the company's profit.

341
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,270
That's ridiculous.

342
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:48,140
I'm expecting
an impressive and novel design.

343
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,210
You take care
of the company's profit.

344
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,710
How about 30,000 dollars as a fee?

345
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,050
Did you say 30,000 dollars?

346
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,650
Mom!

347
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,750
They are willing to pay the premium.

348
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,490
Selling it at a time like this
is part of doing business.

349
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:07,090
Your sister saved money
for four years to get us this store.

350
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:08,490
So I could prepare for retirement...

351
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:10,090
and you could learn
how to run a business.

352
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:12,360
And we can double the money.

353
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,370
How do you plan to do that?
Through stocks? Cryptocurrencies?

354
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:18,400
Yes! You know that too.

355
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,400
You've invested in crypto before.

356
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,170
When the price drops,
you panic and sell at a loss.

357
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:25,410
Then when it goes up, you get upset
and borrow money to buy more.

358
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:26,540
That's not all.

359
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,910
He bought the stocks
recommended by experts.

360
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:30,180
When the price went up a little,

361
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,920
he sold the stocks right away
to buy a car.

362
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,590
And when he ran out of money,
he sold them for cheap.

363
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:38,090
Anyway, Mom,
whatever Ggang Oh says...

364
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,660
is nonsense.

365
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,890
- So don't listen to him.
- Hey, Ji Eun Oh!

366
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:45,130
If you don't address me properly,
I'm cutting off your allowance.

367
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,600
Allowance, my foot.
You don't even pay me properly.

368
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:50,900
How much have I paid off
on the loans you took out?

369
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,300
Eun Oh.

370
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,610
The realtor stopped by
earlier today.

371
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:56,870
They say
someone wants to move in here.

372
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,040
And they offered
30,000 dollars as the premium.

373
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,910
What? Did you say 30,000 dollars?

374
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,350
Yes, 30,000 dollars.

375
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,280
Interesting. I'm going to make
30,000 dollars too.

376
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,390
What do you mean?

377
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,520
Mom.

378
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,790
I got a construction project
worth 200,000 dollars today.

379
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,360
And they offered me
30,000 dollars...

380
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,700
for the interior design.

381
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,700
My goodness.

382
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,600
Who would spend
that much money on interior design?

383
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,170
Someone rich and even kind.

384
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,070
- My goodness.
- Who is that?

385
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,910
You don't have to know.
She's my savior.

386
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:32,110
So, I'm feeling
full of energy today.

387
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:34,010
- You should go and rest, Mom.
- What?

388
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:36,410
Gang Oh will clean the tables.

389
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,320
And I'll do the dishes.

390
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,020
You can stay seated here.

391
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,590
You must be tired.

392
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,420
Hey, Gang Oh.

393
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:48,060
Eun Oh, what will you do
with the money?

394
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,930
I'll pay off the debt and buy a car.

395
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:58,970
(Project Schedule)

396
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,700
(Lee Ji Hyuk)

397
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,880
Hey, Ji Hyuk.

398
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,540
Let's have lunch together.

399
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,350
Why, all of a sudden?

400
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,820
It's something serious, right?

401
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,830
You got me something light.

402
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:31,440
I'm getting married in two weeks.

403
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,270
You're getting married?

404
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,150
I told you about her.

405
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,880
Jung Bo A from Haneul Construction.

406
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,920
(Ji Hyuk and Bo A)

407
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:55,990
I didn't believe that.

408
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:59,060
I told you that day.

409
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,660
That I'd get married.

410
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,270
Hearing you talk made me realize...

411
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,670
it's not a bad idea.

412
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:09,910
Yes. I can do it.

413
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,910
I thought you were just saying that.

414
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:16,650
Why would I?

415
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:19,280
When marriage
is such an important matter?

416
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,820
Ji Hyuk.

417
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,520
You won't regret it?

418
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,230
I will have to get married to know
whether I'll regret it or not.

419
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,430
Okay.

420
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,970
You already have
the wedding invitations.

421
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:40,040
I never thought you'd agree
to a contractual marriage.

422
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,880
Watch what you say.

423
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:51,920
She's a good person.

424
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,220
I've known her for a long time,
but she hasn't changed.

425
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,890
She's easygoing and not picky.

426
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,850
She doesn't act like a girl
from a rich family.

427
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,830
She's a kind person
who gets along well with her elders.

428
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:04,390
But you are not in love.

429
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:07,530
You don't love her,
and she doesn't love you.

430
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,600
I'm here to give you
the wedding invitation.

431
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,300
You got it, so let's just eat.

438
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,790
She really sent the money.

439
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,000
- Su Jeong.
- Eun Oh.

440
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,200
Did you see this?

441
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:18,700
I've been busy. What is it?

442
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:20,240
Ji Hyuk's getting married.

443
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,310
What are you talking about?

448
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:44,490
Lee Ji Hyuk's Wedding

449
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:47,060
It's not something we can talk about
in the existing chat room.

450
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,670
Tell me if any of you know.

451
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,600
Is the bride Jung Bo A
from the Haneul Construction family?

452
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,940
That's correct.

453
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:55,210
How long has Ji Hyuk
been dating Jung Bo A?

454
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:56,610
Wasn't Jung Bo A
in a serious relationship...

455
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:58,110
with the welder from Edel Orphanage,

456
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:00,910
the one she met while volunteering?

457
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:02,080
From Yumyeong University.

458
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,280
That's right. It was a famous story.

459
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,220
The love between a rich girl
and an orphan.

460
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,720
And her family's disapproval.

461
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,020
From what I heard,
that's why they broke up.

462
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:12,520
I'm sure she didn't date Ji Hyuk.

463
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,060
He was dating a girl...

464
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,530
from the cycling club
until a month ago.

465
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,300
Ji Hyuk wouldn't date two women
at the same time.

466
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,860
Then what is this wedding about?

467
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,060
Is it a contractual marriage?

468
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:24,400
Ji Hyuk didn't want to get married.

469
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,670
What is going on?

00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:33,810

481
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,860
Hello?

482
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,760
Mr. Park, let's meet up.

483
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:44,550
Is it true that Ji Hyuk is marrying
Jung Bo A from Haneul Construction?

484
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:49,320
Something must have happened
between them.

485
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:52,820
That's not true. Nothing happened.

486
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:54,820
I know.

487
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:56,960
That does sound strange.

488
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:00,460
Did he tell you in person?

489
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,500
I received a wedding invitation.

490
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,370
Eun Oh...

491
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,710
This was it.

492
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,280
You...

493
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,820
don't suit me.

494
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:23,150
I finally get what he meant.

495
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,990
Eun Oh, can you tell me
in a way I'd understand?

496
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:51,580
When it's hard
to be straightforward,

497
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,150
people say things indirectly.

498
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,490
Did you not feel that?

499
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,260
When someone...

500
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:05,330
doesn't meet your standards,
you say the person doesn't suit you.

501
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:10,000
Ji Hyuk's marrying into her family
to be useful to them.

502
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,970
What use does
Haneul Construction's CEO...

503
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,000
have for Ji Hyuk?

504
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,740
Jung Bo A's flawed, remember?

505
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:16,510
She can't marry anyone
in the upper circle.

506
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,380
You...

507
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:24,510
don't suit me.

508
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,290
By the way, Ji Hyuk,
why are you against marrying?

509
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,860
I just don't want to get married.

510
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:36,260
Why don't you want to marry?

511
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,200
I'd rather stay free and unbound.

512
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,430
Even if you meet someone you love?

513
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,170
What if you met
the love of your life?

514
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,840
Either way, I won't marry.

515
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:50,040
Suppose a pretty, wealthy,

516
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,310
well-educated girl
with a kind personality liked you.

517
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:54,440
Would you still not marry her?

518
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,910
Would someone like that
actually choose me?

519
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:57,680
That'd be perfect.

520
00:27:58,550 --> 00:27:59,980
Perfect in what way?

521
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:01,280
As a spouse.

522
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,420
- What?
- But someone like that...

523
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,920
would never choose me.

524
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:23,670
What is it?

525
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,400
Does Director Seong Jae also know?

526
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,070
He received a wedding invitation.

527
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:34,080
Why is your hand trembling?

528
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:37,510
Can you hold my hands, Su Jeong?

529
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,220
Why did you have to like
Lee Ji Hyuk, of all people,

530
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,850
without knowing
what kind of guy he was?

531
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,830
You said so many times.

532
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,560
You said you saw a side of him
that others didn't.

533
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:54,560
You said he had something
that set him apart from others.

534
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,070
Yes.

535
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:58,940
There was something special
about him.

536
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,610
(Hangyeol University)

537
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:05,040
(May 2017)

538
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,480
What the...

539
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,680
(Value of Hangyeol)

540
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:11,850
Guys, have you seen Ji Hyuk?

541
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,020
- No.
- No.

542
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,120
Not today, not yesterday,
or the day before that.

543
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,990
I probably won't see him tomorrow
or the day after that,

544
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:18,190
so stop asking.

545
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:20,660
As if I'm asking for myself.

546
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:23,230
I need the stamp of approval
from the club president.

547
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:24,630
Don't you guys...

548
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,800
want to go to a vacation cabin
for a retreat?

549
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:31,270
Wait, to support the vacation cabin
that Hyeon Su designed?

550
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,500
That's right.

551
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,470
Of course, we should go.

552
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:35,470
I want to go as well.

553
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,440
Exactly. That's why you need to...

554
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,810
find Ji Hyuk by the end of the day.

555
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:39,940
Got it?

556
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,580
Or get me Oh Hyeong Sik instead.

557
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,250
I mean... Wait, I need the toilet.

558
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,650
Oh Hyeong Sik, you!

559
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,550
Really?

560
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:50,890
Don't.

561
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:53,090
Why you...

562
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,830
You.

563
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:58,490
You and Ji Hyuk visited the site...

564
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:01,130
for our volunteer work in Samin-dong
four days ago.

565
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,000
We did, but then parted ways.

566
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:06,040
Exactly what time and where?

567
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,200
What?

568
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:10,510
- Don't tell me you killed Ji Hyuk.
- Come on.

569
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:11,870
If you didn't kill him...

570
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,210
and bury his body
in one of the abandoned houses,

571
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:15,450
you'll spill.

572
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:18,010
He told me not to tell anyone.

573
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:21,220
Why's that? Did he move there?

574
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:23,050
- Yes.
- What?

575
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,660
Yes, as in he moved there.

576
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,090
What exactly do you mean by that?

577
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:43,370
My gosh!

578
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:51,050
I said I'd move out
after I found a place to live.

579
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:53,320
Until then, don't even think
about harassing me.

580
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,850
I dare you to come at me.

581
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:57,790
If you do, your faces
will be all over the Internet.

582
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,820
Hey, get that phone.

583
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,160
You'll take my phone?

584
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,190
This isn't the only camera
filming you.

585
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,570
Did you really think
an illegal demolition would fly?

586
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:13,700
Those cameras will film every pore
and bump on your faces.

587
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:17,040
I dare you
to force yourselves inside.

588
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,940
You'd better not even leave
a scratch with that square bar.

589
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,380
Why you...

590
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,580
I bet you want to kill me.

591
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,050
Sure. Go ahead and see if I die.

592
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,720
Why are you getting in our way...

593
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,420
when you're not even a member
of this family?

594
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,690
I'm Lee Ji Hyuk,
a senior majoring in business...

595
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:32,060
at Hangyeol University.

596
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,760
If you got that
through your thick skull,

597
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,860
don't come back here
until this family has moved out.

598
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,190
And when will that be, you punk?

599
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,830
Give me your number,
and I'll call you, punk.

600
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,070
You darn punk.

601
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:49,770
Eun Oh.

602
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,270
What are you thinking about?

603
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,610
What should I do with you?

604
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,450
You're asking for the bankbook
with your severance pay?

605
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,790
I said I'd put all the money back.

606
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,430
We can't marry our son off
with nothing to his name.

607
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:18,760
The girl's family
will look down on us.

608
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:21,460
What about us, then?

609
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,930
How will we pay back our loan?

610
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:26,470
What about Ji Wan and Su Bin?

611
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,240
I said I'd make more money
and put it back, Da Jeong.

612
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:30,970
Don't you trust me?

613
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:40,480
Here's your 10,000 dollars.

614
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,680
Thank you.

615
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:44,320
(1,000 dollars)

616
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,500
Father.

617
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:58,870
Here.

618
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:00,800
What's this?

619
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,840
You should at least buy her
a wedding ring.

620
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,210
It's all been covered.

621
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:10,350
You fool, a ring is a man's dignity.

622
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:13,080
Besides,
your parents aren't penniless.

623
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,420
How much is this?

624
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:17,620
It's 100,000 dollars.

625
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,830
All right, Father.

626
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,870
Spend this 10,000 dollars...

627
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,270
on clothes and shoes for the family.

628
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,140
The rest is more than enough.

629
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,770
Thank you.

630
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,180
It's really all right, Father.

631
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,170
How could you let me find out...

632
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:11,610
about your wedding
through a group chat?

633
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,810
That's not like you at all.

634
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:17,080
Give me the wedding invitation
in person.

635
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:31,760
I was going to give it to you
at the cafe.

636
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:37,630
When will you be here?

637
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,140
I'll get there before you close up.

638
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:50,410
Su Jeong, let's close early today.

639
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:39,800
I see Su Jeong isn't here.

640
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,270
What would you like to drink?

641
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:45,100
I've had enough coffee for today.

642
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,870
Just chamomile tea.

643
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,410
- Take a seat.
- Sure.

644
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:14,630
Is something up with Su Jeong?

645
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,500
You closed early today.

646
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,670
I'd like the wedding invitation.

647
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,240
Sure.

648
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,530
(Lee Ji Hyuk and Jung Bo A)

649
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:44,930
Groom, Lee Ji Hyuk.

650
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,260
Bride, Jung Bo A.

651
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,270
Right.

652
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:51,470
Jung Bo A's your bride-to-be.

653
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,500
Yes, that's how it is.

654
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,380
Jung Bo A, the daughter
of Haneul Construction's CEO.

655
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,120
Was this it all along?

656
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,720
What do you mean?

657
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,790
This is why I wasn't right for you.

658
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,160
Right?

659
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,100
Is that...

660
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:26,670
how I came off?

661
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,500
That's what you said.

662
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:33,140
"You don't suit me."

663
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:41,680
That's not what I meant.

664
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,420
Don't mess around with me.
That won't work anymore.

665
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:48,520
I already know you're a jerk,

666
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:51,430
so don't pretend to be a good guy.

667
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,700
That's not like you.

668
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,070
No, scratch that.

669
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:58,670
This is exactly who you are.

670
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:01,770
Only I didn't know,
since I was so delusional.

671
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:07,010
- Ji Eun Oh.
- I'm not blaming you.

672
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,580
I'm just baffled
by how I could not have known.

673
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:13,820
I...

674
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:16,890
I liked you for the person you were,

675
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:19,460
because I thought you were amazing.

676
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,990
I ended up falling for you,

677
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:25,130
believing I had a crush
on someone...

678
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:27,000
decent and amazing.

679
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
But...

680
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,900
I can't help but laugh at how
ridiculously unexpected this is.

681
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,140
That's enough.

682
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:38,710
I never asked you to idolize me,

683
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:42,080
and you don't get to attack me
for not living up to your fantasy.

684
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:45,010
I'm not attacking you.
I am just expressing my anger!

685
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,650
You could've just told me.

686
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:54,220
All you had to say was
that my status and background...

687
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:57,930
don't live up to your standards.
That's all.

688
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:03,970
"Ji Eun Oh,"

689
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,800
"you and your family
are just too poor for me..."

690
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:10,570
"to even consider you,
so know your place."

691
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:13,680
If you had been honest with me,

692
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,580
I would've easily
gotten the message.

693
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:20,780
But right up to the end,
you didn't bother to tell me...

694
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:22,590
how you really felt...

695
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:23,820
and left me guessing.

696
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:26,020
You fed me your twisted logic
and absurd excuses...

697
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:28,090
while being a pretentious jerk,
until the very end.

698
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,830
What you really wanted...

699
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:36,530
was an easy life,

700
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:38,930
wealth, and status...

701
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:40,470
through marriage,

702
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:42,370
even if there was no love...

703
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,570
or affection.

704
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:47,510
But you pretended otherwise,

705
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:50,480
as if you righteously sided
with the little guys...

706
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,850
and stayed unmarried to remain free.

707
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,780
I'm furious that you lied to me
all this time.

708
00:41:57,450 --> 00:42:00,090
It's so infuriating
that it's sickening.

709
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:05,460
I see.

710
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:15,800
The person I liked the most...

711
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,110
turned out to be
the very kind of person I despise.

712
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,410
That's why...

713
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:23,250
I'm done respecting you
as my senior...

714
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:25,880
and regretting everything
I did for you,

715
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,480
not knowing who you really were.

716
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:30,250
I'll even forget about the way...

717
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:32,660
you faked our friendship too,

718
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,260
so don't acknowledge me anymore.

719
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:42,560
Always so smart.

720
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:47,540
You sorted it out all by yourself.

721
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:50,470
Speak up
if you have anything to say.

722
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,010
You probably think...

723
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:55,640
I'm attacking you
when you did nothing wrong.

724
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:01,220
This is where it ends between us.

725
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,590
We're no longer friends
or anything else.

726
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:06,460
Got it?

727
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:11,790
Answer me.

728
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:21,940
Sure.

729
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,540
You can go now.

730
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:30,610
Leave!

731
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:36,390
Sure.

732
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:46,900
Where did it all go wrong?

733
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:01,010
Hey, Ji Hyuk.

734
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,340
I'm at the cafe.

735
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:04,280
Look after Eun Oh.

736
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,720
She just threw a fit.

737
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:38,010
I'm writing a business proposal,

738
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:40,450
but I hit a block, Eun Oh.

739
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,270
I was just hoping to have
a bottle of beer.

740
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:11,580
Have a seat.

741
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,330
Right, thanks.

742
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:42,340
It must've been a tough day for you,

743
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:43,910
judging by how quiet you are.

744
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,890
Is it that you don't want
to talk to anyone,

745
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:54,460
or that you don't want it to be me?

746
00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:56,630
Both.

747
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:01,060
Should I leave, then?

748
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:09,100
Enjoy your beer.

749
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,020
She seems like a different person.

750
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:26,490
If so, will there be no need
for artists like us?

751
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:29,260
Which art pieces
and what about them...

752
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:31,760
resonated with you artistically?

753
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:35,430
All right. If art created...

754
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:37,530
through digital technology
counts as art,

755
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:41,170
should electronic devices
and software...

756
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:43,340
also be considered artists
like humans?

757
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:48,740
Still, humans are the ones
who are touched...

758
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:50,510
by the art they produce.

759
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:54,480
We'll continue this discussion
in our next session.

760
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:57,690
That will be all for today.
Nice work, everyone.

761
00:46:57,790 --> 00:47:00,260
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

762
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:04,930
Mr. Jung is waiting in his car
right by the entrance,

763
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:07,200
so rush over there, acting busy
while glancing at your watch.

764
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,970
(Dowon University)

765
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:26,440
- My gosh.
- Are you all right?

766
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,510
- What happened?
- Did you see that?

767
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:30,350
- We should call an ambulance.
- It looks serious.

768
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:35,680
She was hurt?

769
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:37,220
How bad is it?

770
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:40,060
No, wait. Which hospital is it?

771
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:46,130
She fainted from the shock.

772
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:49,100
She's physically fine, fortunately.

773
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,570
What about her face?

774
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,930
How serious is her facial injury?

775
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:55,440
- It's an abrasion.
- Will it scar or not?

776
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,310
It's not serious enough to scar.

777
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:03,380
What about Mr. Jung's surgery?

778
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,110
I heard the bleeding
in his brain was severe.

779
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:08,380
He was fortunate
that the students on campus...

780
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:09,790
called for help right away.

781
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:12,190
He's likely to recover.

782
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:14,190
I see.

783
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:22,500
Mom.

784
00:49:23,330 --> 00:49:24,970
Goodness, Yeong Ra.

785
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:27,900
What happened?

786
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:30,210
I told you to always be careful.

787
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:32,210
Honey, maybe later.

788
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:34,280
Yes, of course.

789
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,380
Get some more rest.

790
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:39,680
Gosh, you're here.

791
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,450
Yeong Ra, Seong Jae's here.

792
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:46,090
Yeong Ra, are you all right?

793
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,520
That must've been really unsettling.

794
00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:50,960
It was, Seong Jae.

795
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:54,500
I was scared to death.

796
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:02,970
What's the deal with that punk?
Haven't they caught him yet?

797
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:06,210
I'm afraid not.
He escaped on a motorcycle...

798
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:07,680
and still hasn't been caught.

799
00:50:11,450 --> 00:50:12,510
What do I do?

800
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:39,780
Aren't you sleeping?

801
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,250
This feels weird.

802
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:46,580
I feel upset and drained.

803
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:51,990
Why? It feels like a weight
has been lifted off my chest.

804
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:14,840
Hold on.

805
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:16,970
Whose wedding is it...

806
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:19,440
that you're all dressed up
and doing your hair for?

807
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:21,680
One of my seniors
is getting married.

808
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:26,450
You put more effort into your makeup
than you did for other weddings.

809
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:29,220
Did I?

810
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:31,650
I wonder why.

811
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:33,820
I'll get going.

812
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,360
Sure. Have a good day.

813
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:50,670
(Director Park Seong Jae)

814
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:53,140
I figured I'd offer someone a ride
to make the gas worthwhile.

815
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:54,710
What do you think?

816
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:58,210
Sounds good to me.

817
00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:03,220
(Sounds good to me.)

818
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:08,320
That's a relief.

819
00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:32,380
I thought you'd be the best man.

820
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:35,350
It was wishful thinking on my part.

821
00:53:35,350 --> 00:53:36,850
His college friends
are helping him out.

822
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:39,490
So much for washing the car.

823
00:53:40,090 --> 00:53:41,120
It was all for nothing.

824
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,530
So that's why you came.

825
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:46,830
It's exactly that.

826
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:53,870
Off we go.

827
00:53:58,370 --> 00:53:59,770
- I'll take the photo.
- Congratulations.

828
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:01,740
- One, two, three.
- Smile!

829
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:04,510
- Looking good!
- You look beautiful.

830
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:06,180
I'll take another one.

831
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:08,950
- Flash me a big smile.
- You're so beautiful.

832
00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:11,350
- One, two, three.
- Isn't she stunning?

833
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:13,760
- You look amazing!
- Looking good.

834
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:14,990
- Come on.
- This is so nice.

835
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:17,760
- I'll take one last photo.
- Sounds good.

836
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,360
One, two, three.

837
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:36,380
Eun Oh,

838
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:38,280
you have a big heart.

839
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:40,750
You're attending the wedding
of the guy who cruelly rejected you.

840
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:42,150
I didn't expect you to go.

841
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:45,420
I'm off to sort things out
one last time.

842
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:49,420
I'll say goodbye
to my long-term one-sided love.

843
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:58,300
You're talking like it's easy,
so I don't know what to say.

844
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:02,640
I don't know how you are feeling.

845
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:08,280
Oh, right.
When should we go see a movie?

846
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:10,580
Movie?

847
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:11,880
We promised the other day.

848
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:15,450
When you told me Ji Hyuk
had broken up with his girlfriend.

849
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:18,420
What movie did you want to see?

850
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:20,560
Oh, that.

851
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:22,920
Do you want to go tomorrow?

852
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:26,260
That would be too much.

853
00:55:26,930 --> 00:55:28,030
What do you mean?

854
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,830
Why are you trying to keep
your promise in this situation?

855
00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:32,870
You'd be uncomfortable.

856
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:35,870
You can't go to the movies alone.

857
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:37,970
That's why I agreed to go with you.

858
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:41,140
The information I gave you
turned out to be useless.

859
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:45,210
It wasn't useless.

860
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,220
I got to sort things out.

861
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,390
I feel relieved.

862
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,950
I don't have to be so foolish
and have feelings for him anymore.

863
00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:07,100
You are suddenly acting
too friendly.

864
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:09,070
It's not like that.

865
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:11,510
Hello.

866
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,710
Oh, hello.

867
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:14,940
Thank you for coming.

868
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:16,680
- Hello.
- Congratulations.

869
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:25,990
You look great in that tux.

870
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:27,690
It suits you well.

871
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:30,260
Congratulations, Ji Hyuk.

872
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:34,260
Thank you for coming, Eun Oh.

873
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:35,960
Thanks, Seong Jae.

874
00:56:39,470 --> 00:56:41,200
You look like a different person
when you're dressed up, Eun Oh.

875
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:48,280
I'll enjoy your wedding.

876
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:54,350
Hey, Lee Ji Hyuk!

877
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,350
- Hey.
- You look great.

878
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:02,020
Hey, congratulations.

879
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:03,490
- Looking great!
- You look dashing.

880
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:04,530
Congratulations.

881
00:57:04,530 --> 00:57:06,290
Hello, Ms. Jo.

882
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:08,130
Hello. Thank you for coming.

883
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:09,800
- Please stay seated.
- Okay.

884
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,000
- You're here. Hello.
- Hello.

885
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,270
Have a seat.

886
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,200
Hey.

887
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:37,090
- I need to go to the restroom.
- Okay.

888
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:50,040
It looks fine.

889
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:00,720
Eun Oh.

890
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:03,320
Come on in.

891
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:05,350
No, it's okay.

892
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:06,860
Hello.

893
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:08,320
Can you hold this for me?

894
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:09,760
- My goodness.
- Well...

895
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,290
Gosh, please be careful.

896
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:13,390
Come in.

897
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:19,970
Here comes the groom.

898
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:06,110
You look handsome.

899
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:13,150
The handsome groom
has made his entrance.

900
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:16,760
Now, the beautiful bride
will be entering.

901
00:59:17,290 --> 00:59:20,030
Everyone, please look up.

902
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:31,070
Here comes the bride.

903
00:59:56,630 --> 00:59:58,900
She shouldn't be dawdling
on a day like this.

904
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:01,740
She will come. It's her wedding.

905
01:00:02,370 --> 01:00:03,810
Why isn't the bride entering?

906
01:00:03,810 --> 01:00:05,110
Was there a miscommunication?

907
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:09,140
I guess the bride is lazy.

908
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,850
Grandma, I guess
she had to go to the restroom.

909
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:17,090
The bride seems to be walking
a little slowly.

910
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,750
Please come on out.

911
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:22,060
Here comes the bride.

912
01:01:24,590 --> 01:01:25,650
Where's the bride?

913
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:39,270
Why? Ji Wan, what's wrong?

914
01:01:39,270 --> 01:01:40,270
What?

915
01:01:42,070 --> 01:01:43,100
Nothing.

916
01:01:46,770 --> 01:01:48,810
Can I see you for a moment?

917
01:01:54,850 --> 01:01:55,880
What?

918
01:01:55,950 --> 01:01:57,050
What is this?

919
01:01:59,650 --> 01:02:02,190
I'm sorry. I have to go to him.

920
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:06,290
Jung Bo A is Ji Hyuk's wife.

921
01:02:06,290 --> 01:02:08,200
She says she has to go to him.

922
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,900
What does that mean?

923
01:02:10,030 --> 01:02:11,100
Well, that's...

924
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:27,480
Her family will take action.

925
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:29,180
Just do as they say. And...

926
01:02:30,590 --> 01:02:33,290
Don't tell anyone
about this text message.

927
01:02:33,290 --> 01:02:34,820
Okay. I won't.

928
01:02:38,790 --> 01:02:40,290
This is driving me nuts.

929
01:02:47,270 --> 01:02:48,270
Ji Hyuk.

930
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:51,470
Come on down.

931
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:54,140
Bo A is not coming.

932
01:03:46,730 --> 01:03:49,460
(Our Golden Days)

933
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:50,900
Are you out of your mind?

934
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:53,430
How could you think of marrying
someone for money as a man?

935
01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:55,100
If you didn't want to live like me,

936
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:57,870
you shouldn't have sold yourself off
for money, you fool!

937
01:03:59,010 --> 01:04:00,980
So, did the bride run away?

938
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:02,280
It serves you right, Lee Ji Hyuk.

939
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:04,110
Mr. Park and you go way back.

940
01:04:04,110 --> 01:04:05,380
Aren't you two friends?

941
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:07,280
Eun Oh, the thing is...

942
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:09,320
Ji Hyuk.

943
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:11,350
How could you
mess things up like this?

944
01:04:11,550 --> 01:04:13,390
You don't even seem human to me.

945
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:16,160
- Excuse me.
- You shouldn't be doing this here.

946
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,160
Hey!

947
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:18,660
That jerk abandoned me.

948
01:04:19,490 --> 01:04:20,930
That jerk.
