1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,310
Director Ko.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,280
Wait.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,550
Eun Oh? What are you doing
at the police station?

4
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:36,780
It can't be...

5
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,750
No.

6
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,990
This is impossible.

7
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,440
Director Ko!

8
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:15,750
Director Ko!

9
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:32,860
This feels like a dream.

10
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:34,700
This has to be a dream.

11
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,960
It wasn't a dream.

12
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,500
Please calm down.

13
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,640
I'm sorry.

14
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,070
You were right in front of me,
and I didn't even recognize you.

15
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,610
I should have looked harder.

16
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,500
I don't know where to begin.

17
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,450
Your name was...

18
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,550
Han Yu Ra.

19
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:01,990
Han...

20
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:03,860
Yu Ra?

21
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,830
But hold on.

22
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:11,700
Didn't you say you were adopted
from an orphanage in Cheongju?

23
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,000
- Yes.
- Cheongju?

24
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,800
How?

25
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,770
You disappeared in Busan.
How did you end up there?

26
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:28,280
So someone must have taken you.

27
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,290
I combed through
every inch of Busan.

28
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,420
On the off chance,

29
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,760
I went down every single alley...

30
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,660
I can't believe
she's my birth mother.

31
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,700
How could I, with my own daughter
right in front of me...

32
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,310
I mean, we met so many times.
How could I not have recognized you?

33
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,710
Even after you told me yourself
you were adopted.

34
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,510
I...

35
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,850
I don't know my birth parents.

36
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,450
My younger brother just found out
that I was adopted.

37
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,260
He says he doesn't see me
as family anymore.

38
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,960
I always thought...

39
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:25,040
I thought I'd know you on sight.
I'm a terrible mother.

40
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,240
Please, don't say that.

41
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,410
I was definitely drawn to you.

42
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,780
We got along so well,
and I thought you were wonderful.

43
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,780
Why didn't it ever cross my mind?

44
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:42,650
I...

45
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,390
I still feel like I'm dreaming.

46
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:51,460
When the lady said
she was taking you to the market,

47
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,170
I should never have let you go.

48
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,500
I had to leave one of my twins...

49
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,770
with my neighbor...

50
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,280
and carried the other on my back
while I sold insurance door-to-door.

51
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,380
Oh, right.

52
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,820
- I'm a twin?
- Growing up,

53
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,290
you weren't mistreated, were you?
Were they really good to you?

54
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,420
Where did you live?

55
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,660
So where did you live,
and until when?

56
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,390
I know you studied computer science
and worked at Doogle,

57
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,900
and that you switched
to interior design, but...

58
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,200
What elementary school
did you go to?

59
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,300
How about middle school?

60
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:31,900
Oh, right.

61
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,340
What happened
with your younger brother?

62
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,810
I couldn't bring myself
to ask before.

63
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,250
He's...

64
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,280
back home now.

65
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,620
He's back?

66
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,890
He must be giving you a hard time.

67
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,360
No, not at all.

68
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,230
He came back a lot more mature.

69
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,000
I see.

70
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,140
(Team Meeting)

71
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,370
I'm sorry.

72
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,810
I have a team meeting
scheduled for today.

73
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:14,880
You do?

74
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:20,320
Of course. You should go, then.
You can't miss a meeting for work.

75
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,860
But what about you, Director Ko?

76
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,330
You came to the hospital
in an ambulance.

77
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,860
That's right.

78
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,100
I'll get a cab
to the police station.

79
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,700
You go on ahead.

80
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,140
Okay.

81
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,580
Tomorrow,

82
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,310
are you free?

83
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:55,690
We barely had any time today.

84
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,060
By the way,

85
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:09,930
why are you dressed so lightly?

86
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,510
It doesn't feel real.

87
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,820
How can she be my mom?

88
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:30,150
How is a coincidence like this
even possible?

89
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,490
It just doesn't feel real.

90
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:41,700
You mean the director?

91
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,500
The director who hired you
to design the art space?

92
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,010
- Yes.
- She's your birth mother? For real?

93
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,640
Unbelievable, right?

94
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,910
How is that even possible?

95
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:00,590
That elegant and sophisticated woman
is your birth mom.

96
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,390
So what was it like for you?

97
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,390
How did you feel?

98
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:09,860
You know how much I admired her.

99
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,130
I wanted to be just like her.

100
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,070
So you were happy about it.

101
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,370
It's not like I hated it.

102
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,640
It's just that...

103
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:25,480
I've never really thought much
about my birth parents,

104
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,150
and for someone so incredible
to suddenly be my birth mother...

105
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,620
I just couldn't believe it.

106
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,790
And do you know
what she's really like?

107
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,020
By the way,

108
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,560
why are you dressed so lightly?

109
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,170
I was worried that...

110
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,110
my daughter...

111
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,240
might have struggled a lot
after I lost her.

112
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:03,080
And if I, her mother, showed up...

113
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:06,980
looking comfortable
and well-dressed, it could hurt her.

114
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,320
So...

115
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,460
I wore the same clothes I had on...

116
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,160
the day I lost you.

117
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,970
Isn't she so thoughtful and warm?

118
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,100
My gosh. It is truly incredible
that she kept...

119
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,770
the clothes she wore the day
she lost her daughter all this time.

120
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,720
What a relief.

121
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,890
It's done. Finally.

122
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:00,970
Su Jeong. Why is everyone
in the office so down?

123
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,180
Because of Ji Hyuk.

124
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,750
Boyang Construction betrayed us,
and the AP Group deal fell through.

125
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:12,520
- What? When?
- Yesterday afternoon.

126
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,720
Mr. Lee turned his phone off,
and no one's heard from him since.

127
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,960
Yesterday afternoon?

128
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,460
I'm hungry.

129
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,130
Will you eat with me?

130
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,570
I'm not really hungry right now.

131
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:37,980
All right. Never mind.

132
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:49,620
So that's why
he was like that yesterday.

133
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,490
I should've at least
had a meal with him.

134
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,830
He should have just told me.
How could he just leave?

135
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,640
(CEO Lee Ji Hyuk)

136
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:16,010
The phone is turned off.
Transferring to voicemail.

137
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:40,140
What's been happening
that's made him look like a ghost?

138
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:55,820
What makes you think you can just
take over a huge company like AP?

139
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,890
Why are you so desperate
to hit the jackpot?

140
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,360
Dad, please...

141
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,060
We had an agreement, Dad.

142
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,930
Just pretend
you don't know anything.

143
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,800
Fine.

144
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,470
He doesn't want me interfering.

145
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,470
I guess that's just how business is.

146
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,270
Going bankrupt can happen
in a flash.

147
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,240
So what if he couldn't get
that huge company?

148
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,680
He'll be upset for a while,
but that's all.

149
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,120
Gosh, this is so frustrating.

150
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:29,590
Turnkey requests are piling up,
so we need more designers.

151
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,320
How many more should we...

152
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:36,590
Ms. Ji?

153
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,500
Oh, I'm so sorry.

154
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,870
I was lost in thought for a moment.

155
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:48,110
It's fine. But all the employees
are looking to the CEO,

156
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,110
so it's only natural
that you're worried.

157
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,010
About Mr. Lee...

158
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:54,180
He'll pull himself together soon.

159
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,180
(Ggang Oh)

160
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,690
- You should answer it.
- Thanks.

161
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,760
- Hey, Ggang Oh.
- Eun Oh!

162
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,060
Why? What's up? What's going on?

163
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:15,230
You know how the HQ tasting team
came to try our galbi?

164
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,570
They've officially added it
to the HQ menu!

165
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,500
Really?

166
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:27,340
When should we go on our first date?
This weekend?

167
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,010
How about tomorrow?

168
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,380
I have a new product meeting,
so I can do 1 p.m.

169
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,250
- Does that work for you?
- Yes, that's perfect.

170
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,060
What's wrong with this?

171
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,490
Gosh, seriously.

172
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,960
Everything has to be perfect today.

173
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,170
From 1 p.m. to midnight.

174
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,100
Just like Cinderella.

175
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:58,040
Oh, it's 19cm? Perfect.

176
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,050
Gosh, why is this spreading out
so much?

177
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:09,490
Why can't I get
the shape of this egg right?

178
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,460
Why doesn't this taste like Mom's?

179
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,130
(Lee Su Bin)

180
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:20,360
Hey, I'm here.

181
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,200
Oh, boy.

182
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,270
Why did she tell me
to meet her here?

183
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,650
What is all this?

184
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,850
Hey, sit down. Take your shoes off.

185
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,690
No, really, what is this?

186
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:49,930
A picnic.

187
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,500
A picnic?

188
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,280
What, am I a kid?

189
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,410
Where did you buy
this kiddie lunch box?

190
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,880
I didn't buy it.
I made it all myself.

191
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,150
It's cute, right?

192
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:13,980
- You made all this? Really?
- Yes.

193
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,190
No way.
Your mom must have made it for you.

194
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,290
No, she didn't.

195
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,730
I was stressing about what to say
if anyone asked me about the gimbap,

196
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:26,060
but my mom and grandma left at 9 a.m.
for their appointments.

197
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,130
The moment they left,

198
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:30,100
I started cooking
and didn't take a single break.

199
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:32,970
Here, try some.

200
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:37,340
Hey, why would you go
through all this trouble?

201
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,480
I'm supposed to be the one
treating you.

202
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:40,840
They say,

203
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,110
"Devote yourself and get tossed out
like an old shoe."

204
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,180
Are you always like this?

205
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,490
No, this is the first time
I've ever made gimbap.

206
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,360
I never even cooked for my exes.

207
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,920
Then why go to all this trouble?

208
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:57,160
Because you've got the upper hand.
I wanted to impress you.

209
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,440
No, I just wanted you to have gimbap
made with lots of love.

210
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,410
I figured
when you were growing up...

211
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:18,650
You were too busy with fancy food
to enjoy homemade meals like this.

212
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,420
You're right.

213
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:25,290
It's my first time having homemade,
busted-open gimbap.

214
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,660
What?

215
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,500
I was sure I only packed the ones
that weren't falling apart.

216
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,900
It all falls apart
in your mouth anyway.

217
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,310
It's seriously good, though.

218
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:44,110
Really? Thank goodness.

219
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,280
What's this?

220
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,080
Did you make
this cute little thing too?

221
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,050
Here, have some soup with it.

222
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,490
What's with her today?
She looks kind of different.

223
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,560
What?

224
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,230
Do I have something on my face?

225
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:11,700
Su Bin...

226
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,610
I never knew you had freckles.

227
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,610
Freckles?

228
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,380
Oh, no.

229
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,750
I forgot to put on makeup.

230
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:30,150
Gosh, why didn't I put on makeup?
I didn't even do my hair...

231
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:31,490
This is a disaster!

232
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,490
Don't wear makeup.

233
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,500
You know, you actually look prettier
without makeup.

234
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,480
No, I take that back.

235
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,250
You look better with makeup.

236
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,860
Make sure you wear makeup
when you see your boyfriend.

237
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,360
Hey, but seriously,
you're great at making gimbap.

238
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,570
Man, I'm stuffed.

239
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,710
You know, back in the US,
I used to eat sandwiches outside.

240
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,950
But this is my first gimbap picnic.

241
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:32,250
- This is nice.
- Yes? This is just the appetizer.

242
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,780
Just wait for the next course.

243
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,990
The next course?
What is this, an omakase?

244
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,760
Hey, I'm already full.

245
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:42,290
No, the next part of our date.

246
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:46,660
We're going to see a movie.
I even booked us a couple's seats.

247
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,930
Look, I have to get going.
I have another meeting.

248
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:51,800
What did you say?

249
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,940
But I thought
we were going on a date today.

250
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,410
Yes, I just asked
if you wanted to get lunch.

251
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,810
You've got to be kidding me.

252
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,410
What kind of date is
just grabbing lunch?

253
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:06,520
You should've told me the plan.
It's a weekday. I still have work.

254
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,250
But still...

255
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,550
Oh, wait.

256
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,860
(Ji Hyuk's Father)

257
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,090
(Ji Hyuk's Father)

258
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,740
Hey, Seong Jae.

259
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,710
Listen, did something happen
with Ji Hyuk?

260
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:34,880
The deal with AP didn't work out,
did it?

261
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:37,780
You knew about the AP acquisition?

262
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,320
Yes, I heard about it.
The rest of the family doesn't know.

263
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,490
It's just that...

264
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:46,820
Ji Hyuk came home yesterday
but didn't go to work this morning,

265
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,930
and he seems to be
just lying in his room.

266
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:50,960
It fell through, didn't it?

267
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,030
Yes.

268
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:59,070
A key investor pulled out,
so the acquisition is unlikely now.

269
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,140
Everything was going so well.

270
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,740
He was so close to getting it.

271
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,810
What? It was that close?

272
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:08,680
So please don't be too hard
on Ji Hyuk.

273
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:12,780
Okay. Don't say anything to him.
And one more thing,

274
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:15,190
don't you ever mention
that I called you.

275
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:18,260
All right, then. Bye.

276
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,990
So they were that close?

277
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,360
To pulling off a miracle like that?

278
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:33,470
His dad is so worried.

279
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,460
Su Bin, were you crying?

280
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,460
Why would I be crying?
My eyes were just itchy.

281
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:59,700
I'll make sure to double-check
our plans next time.

282
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,170
Yes. Do that next time.

283
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:07,170
But still, I'm glad
I got to see you enjoy the food.

284
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,210
Let's go. I'll get you a cab.

285
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,640
No, it's okay.
I'll walk with you to your car.

286
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,750
No, the parking lot is right here.

287
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,050
Exactly. I'll walk you there.

288
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:25,920
Anyway, it's a nice day
for a stroll.

289
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:28,460
Hey. Let me get that.

290
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:30,890
Let's go.

291
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,040
Here.

292
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,910
Hey, since you were so stubborn
about not taking a cab.

293
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,280
Get going.

294
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,820
- You go first.
- Lee Su Bin.

295
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,050
Fine.

296
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,880
Why is she leaving like that?
It's so not her.

297
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,150
She's making me worry.

298
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,820
My Yeong Ra?

299
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,120
Surely not. That can't be right.

300
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,560
What do you mean
she doesn't like Mr. Lee Sang Hoon?

301
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:38,730
Oh dear. Sang Hoon is asking
if our families are in agreement.

302
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:41,400
He says your daughter
won't answer his calls,

303
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:45,670
and he feels she's avoiding him
since she only texts him she's busy.

304
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:48,270
My goodness, no.
That's not it at all, ma'am.

305
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:52,180
It's just when Yeong Ra paints,
she gets lost in her work.

306
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,480
Plus, she's a bit of a homebody,

307
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,980
so she's not always on her phone
like kids these days.

308
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,420
I'm so sorry
for the worry we've caused.

309
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:04,960
I'll have a word with her
and get back to you.

310
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,660
Yes. Of course.

311
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,900
Gosh, what is with this girl?

312
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:17,330
I'm on the verge of something huge,
and she's making things difficult.

313
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,880
(Park Yeong Ra's Studio)

314
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,810
(Yeong Ra's Car, Parking Lot)

315
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,950
This hits the spot
right after some spicy malatang.

316
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,220
You can't eat malatang...

317
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,190
just a few hours
after having cheese tteokbokki.

318
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,620
It is super high in calories.

319
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:43,330
But...

320
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,560
I don't really gain weight
that easily.

321
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,600
Besides,

322
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:50,600
even if I gain some weight now,
my mom won't say a thing.

323
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,470
I've got Lee Sang Hoon, remember?

324
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,640
You've got Lee Sang Hoon?

325
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,040
What's that supposed to mean?

326
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:03,880
Never mind. Hey, let's go sing.

327
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:05,280
Let's go burn this off.

328
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,490
No matter what

329
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:14,690

- My love

- Park Yeong Ra, you can sing.
- For you

333
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:24,900
- You learn that from me?
- Is very special

and the Atlantic Ocean

00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,470
What?

348
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,140
- Mom.
- What do you think you're doing?

349
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:19,880
I think I've gained a little weight,
so I was just getting some exercise.

350
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,790
Why are you avoiding
VP Lee Sang Hoon's calls?

351
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:24,520
What?

352
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,390
You don't answer his calls
and texted him saying you were busy.

Yes.

354
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,560
He's intimidating.

355
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,230
You don't answer his calls
because you're intimidated?

356
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,400
No, that's not what I meant.

357
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:42,140
I didn't see that
he had called until later,

358
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,370
and I was too shy to call him back,

359
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:47,580
- so I decided to wait for his call.
- Then what about the text?

360
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,610
The thing about the text is...

361
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:53,620
He just texted out of the blue
asking to meet tomorrow,

362
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,520
and I just needed a little time
to prepare myself.

363
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:00,490
You've met him two times already.
What is there to prepare for?

364
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:03,890
Now, they think you're avoiding him.

365
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,300
The chairman's wife at Jinhwa Group
called me herself.

366
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:11,430
Do you want to ruin this marriage?
We're talking about Jinhwa Group!

367
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,110
No, that's not it.

368
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:17,440
When Lee Sang Hoon calls,
you go meet him. Immediately.

369
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,210
What's the point of
being cooped up in here all day?

370
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,980
Are you trying to be
a real artist or something?

371
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,390
You find painting fun?

372
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:33,990
Yes.

373
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:38,460
Look at the quality
of your paintings.

374
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,100
Don't you realize
you have no talent for painting?

375
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,310
You're an artist now,

376
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:53,210
so stop painting.
It's getting you nowhere.

377
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,540
Instead,

378
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,250
let's try art appreciation lessons.
That's how you'll run a gallery.

379
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:02,520
I'll speak to Professor Kim,
so get ready.

380
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,390
Get ready for what?

381
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:06,860
To get your mind right.

382
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,090
And to get married.

383
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:22,770
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Have a great day.

384
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:25,740
Let's go.

385
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:38,220
Lying here just like back then.

386
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:45,130
Why am I so devastated?

387
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,470
It's not like acquiring AP Group
was the be-all and end-all.

388
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:50,570
It was just a project
I wanted to take on.

389
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,870
I think this is fun.
I'm doing it because I enjoy it.

390
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:56,840
Gosh, what time is it?

391
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:10,450
(Ji Eun Oh)

392
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:14,620
You took a long shot and missed.
Is that a reason to skip work, CEO?

393
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,560
She always hits the nail
on the head.

394
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:22,530
Don't tell me
you were just hoping to get lucky.

395
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:26,200
Then you can just get back on track.

396
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:28,910
Let's face reality.

397
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:33,780
It seems Lady Luck
isn't on your side this time.

398
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:39,150
It would've taken a lot of luck
to make it happen.

399
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,090
You can adjust the settings
with this.

400
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,500
It feels nice and warm.

401
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:58,500
Just help the customers try it out
like this.

402
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,670
Trying it myself
really makes it clear.

403
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:07,880
- This product's main feature is...
- Da Jeong, you can go home now.

404
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,510
Okay.

405
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,650
I can't believe it's so late.

406
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:25,460
(Gyeong Hun)

407
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:29,030
(Hey, Gyeong Hun...)

408
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,510
No. I should just call him.

409
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,910
- Hey, Sang Cheol!
- Hey, Yeong Bo.

410
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,280
Why are you heading home
at this hour?

411
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,350
Shouldn't you be out
making deliveries on the bike now?

412
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:51,890
Yes, I did something else today.
The delivery gig doesn't pay well,

413
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,820
so I'll do better-paying day labor
for a while.

414
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:57,560
Why? Is something wrong?
Is it about your father-in-law?

415
00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:00,330
Why bring up my father-in-law
out of the blue?

416
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,400
No, that's not it. It's just...

417
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,370
The practical test is in a few days,
and if you pass,

418
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,140
you're going to start looking
for an electrician job, right?

419
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,870
Yes, I'm just feeling
a little anxious.

420
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:16,680
This might not be the time to relax
and just earn enough to get by.

421
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:20,320
- I have to go.
- Hey, stay for a drink. It's on me.

422
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,820
You said nothing was wrong at home.

423
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,820
I can't drink or goof off.
Take it easy.

424
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,960
Something's definitely up
with Lee Sang Cheol.

425
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,900
I'm home.

426
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:35,970
You're home early today.

427
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,840
Is everything okay at home?

428
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:42,140
Why would anything be wrong?

429
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:44,740
Let me just finish this,
and I'll get dinner ready.

430
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:46,540
Okay, thanks.

431
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:01,260
Honey, Ji Hyuk's door is locked.
Can you get it open?

432
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:07,800
Ji Hyuk's in there.
Just go downstairs. Go on.

433
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,300
Why would Ji Hyuk be here
at this hour?

434
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:12,900
I thought he didn't come home
last night.

435
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:15,340
Look, just go downstairs first.
We can talk downstairs.

436
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:16,740
- Come on, let's go.
- What? Why?

437
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:19,040
- Downstairs, come on.
- What is going on?

438
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:30,120
You're saying he's been holed up
in his room since last night?

439
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,890
- Did his business fail?
- Hey, watch it.

440
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,890
If he snuck in quietly last night,
something's seriously wrong with it.

441
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:40,660
So what if there is a problem,
and so what if there isn't?

442
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:44,030
Gosh, will you just tell Ji Hyuk
to come down?

443
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,070
Mother, just pretend
you don't know anything.

444
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:49,310
Business has its ups and downs.

445
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:52,310
Why tell the family
every little thing?

446
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,780
- Oh, dear.
- You too. Just ignore him.

447
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,880
Ji Wan, you too.

448
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:00,680
Try to stay out of his way today,
if you can.

449
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,290
- Mother, just go to your room.
- All right, I'm going.

450
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:07,320
So that means Ji Hyuk
hasn't eaten anything all day.

451
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:10,190
He'll come down and eat on his own
if he's hungry.

452
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:12,860
Dad.

453
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,540
Man, I'm starving.

454
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,280
What? What's this?

455
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,650
Oh, it's hotteok.

456
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:51,430
You...

457
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,000
The AP acquisition fell through,
didn't it?

458
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,840
You already know the answer,
so why ask?

459
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,910
Are you trying to rub it in?

460
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:04,050
You expected to take over AP Group
with a mindset this fragile?

461
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,850
That's why you failed.

462
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,050
It went just the way you wanted,
Dad.

463
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:10,150
You knew I was going to fail.

464
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,020
That's right. I knew you would.

465
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:15,360
So, are you satisfied?

466
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:17,590
Why would I be satisfied?

467
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,530
When my own son is acting
like a complete loser?

468
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,230
Acting like a loser?
What are you talking about?

469
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:26,570
You failed at 1 thing and spent
the last 2 days moping in bed.

470
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,910
I checked,
and the bid deadline is not over.

471
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,410
What does the deadline matter?

472
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,240
I couldn't secure the funds
for the acquisition.

473
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,450
What would you do
if you were in my shoes, Dad?

474
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:39,050
If it were me,
I'd go see the chairman himself.

475
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:40,550
What?

476
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,890
You have to crawl over that mountain
if that's what it takes.

477
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,450
That's the only way
to have no regrets.

478
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:50,760
Dad, you don't understand business,
but it all comes down to money.

479
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:55,530
There are two other companies
with their full funds ready.

480
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,770
And there could be more
for all I know.

481
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,370
So what? Were you
completely confident at first?

482
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:03,740
A major investor pulled out.
I don't even have half the funds.

483
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,270
How am I supposed to win
the bidding war?

484
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,880
You don't know
what you're talking about.

485
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:12,450
In a bidding war, it's still people
who control the money.

486
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,220
Money doesn't make decisions
by itself.

487
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:20,120
The meaning of that money changes
depending on the person holding it.

488
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,560
See?

489
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,660
What have you got to lose?

490
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,900
For someone who acts like
such a know-it-all.

491
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:29,630
You can't live with regrets,
can you?

492
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:33,940
You went all the way to the altar.
So you have no regrets, right?

493
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:37,610
If you hadn't, you'd spend your life
wondering what if and being bitter.

494
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:41,180
Gosh. What does that have to do
with anything?

495
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:44,210
I bought that hotteok.

496
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,480
Fine, how much were they? What?
How much do I owe you?

497
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:49,950
Four dollars for two.

498
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:57,060
You won't go.
Not everyone has that much courage.

499
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:03,630
Go and see him?

500
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:06,600
Meet the chairman?

501
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,570
That's ridiculous.

502
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,540
But wait, why not?

503
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,350
Why didn't I think of that?

504
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:24,320
(AP Interiors)

505
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,420
("Joy is our way."
Chairman Kim Dong Su)

506
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:32,130
"Joy is our way?"

507
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,800
Why does this feel so familiar?

508
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,300
I've heard this before...

509
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:39,270
Where have I heard it before?

510
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,170
"My childhood, when I wanted
to go to an orphanage."

511
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:48,540
My grandmother passed away
the following year.

512
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,950
From then on, I was really...

513
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:54,120
bounced around between
all sorts of relatives' houses.

514
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,890
There was an orphanage
in my neighborhood back then,

515
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,890
and I was so jealous
of the kids who lived there.

516
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,890
I wanted to sleep somewhere warm
and eat my meals on time.

517
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,000
I had fun...

518
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,900
growing the company.

519
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:11,800
Of course,
I wanted to make money too.

520
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:14,800
But I realized something

will follow naturally.

Back in 2016,

536
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:05,550
I helped
with the Edel Orphanage renovation.

537

You sound much brighter,
Lee Ji Hyuk.

538
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:12,400
I saw you here when you came
to help out in the spring.

539
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:16,170
You used to call me Mr. Park
during the renovation.

540
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:20,040
- I guess you didn't recognize me.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

541
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:24,040
I guess I was so out of it back then
that I didn't remember.

542
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,410
It's okay.

543
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,080
So, what can I do for you?

544
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:32,620
Yes, during the renovation,
I saw a local Cheongpo magazine.

545
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,820
It interviewed Kim Dong Su,
the man who built Edel Orphanage,

546
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:39,590
and I was just wondering
if it might still be in the library.

547
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,660
Of course. We still have it.

548
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:44,060
It's about our orphanage's founder,
after all.

549
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:48,330
Can you snap the interview page
and send it?

550
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:50,130
I'm in a bit of a situation.

551
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:01,640
Why do I keep feeling so guilty?

552
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:07,980
No. It was unavoidable.

and a sweet daughter.

00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:13,660
- Everyone, come look at this.
- Look at me sashaying around.

693
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:16,130
- It's Ms. Ok Rye!
- That's right.

694
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:19,300
- You look like a model.
- Wow. You look fantastic.

695
00:48:19,370 --> 00:48:22,070
- You look amazing.
- You think so?

696
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:24,840
Yes, Secretary Kang.

697
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:28,540
What did you just say?

698
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:31,950
He appointed Seong Jae
as Vice President?

699
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:35,480
Yes. The chairman gave the order
suddenly today.

700
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,120
Okay, I have to go.

701
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:42,220
Park Jin Seok.

702
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:45,060
What in the world are you thinking?

703
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:51,600
(Ending Note:
Title for the next chapter)

704
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:53,970
Oh, man...

705
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:56,440
I almost had it.

706
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:00,740
Hey, how's it coming along?

707
00:49:01,010 --> 00:49:02,010
Not well!

708
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:05,680
Hold on, why am I the one
helping you with your webtoon plot?

709
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:08,620
Tell me. Are you going to be
a webtoon artist?

710
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:09,990
Or are you going to marry
into the Jinhwa Group?

711
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:14,760
Why are you so concerned
with my life?

712
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:19,230
You're weird.
You've been so casual since we met.

713
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,030
Weren't you intimidated by me
when we first met?

714
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:24,770
What's so intimidating about you?

715
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:28,240
Other drivers, people at the gym,
even at the spa,

716
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,540
everyone's intimidated by me...

717
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:34,010
because my dad's a chairman,
and my mom runs a foundation.

718
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:36,750
Your parents are the ones
with those titles.

719
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,210
You're nothing on your own.

720
00:49:40,450 --> 00:49:41,450
What did you just say?

721
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:43,750
You even had a ghost painter.

722
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,790
You have nothing
that's actually yours.

723
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:50,790
Wait, you have your webtoon.
But you can't even publish it.

724
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:52,430
So, you're a nobody.

725
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,770
How can you say something so cruel?

726
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:01,200
Hey, don't cry.
I can't stand it when girls cry.

727
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:03,910
If you were Su Bin,
I would've smacked you by now.

728
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:08,210
Fine. I have nothing.

729
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:11,450
That's why I'm going to marry
a guy from an even better family.

730
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:16,250
Hey, I never said you had nothing.
I said you had your webtoon.

731
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:18,590
You're the only one who likes it.
Just you.

732
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:20,920
I'm the only one who likes it?
No way!

733
00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:27,860
Hey, look at this.

734
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,500
- Your webtoon.
- My webtoon?

735
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:36,300
- What is this?
- See what you're capable of.

736
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:39,140
I posted your webtoon on Neiro.

737
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,810
How could you upload this
without telling me?

738
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:46,520
Just look, and if you still hate it,
I'll take it down when I get back.

739
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,300
(Yoon Tae Sik
Vice President, AP Group)

740
00:51:04,870 --> 00:51:05,870
Yes, hello.

741
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,240
We met at the last HQ meeting.

742
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,540
I'm Lee Ji Hyuk, CEO of Mamdaerozip.

743
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:11,810
I'm here to see the chairman.

744
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:16,180
The chairman isn't seeing anyone
about the acquisition.

745
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:19,920
Please tell him Lee Ji Hyuk is here.
I did the Edel Orphanage renovation.

746
00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:21,380
Please.

747
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:27,360
He worked on
the Edel Orphanage renovation?

748
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,060
He doesn't have the funds.

749
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,360
He must be dredging up
old connections.

750
00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:34,400
His company has nowhere near
enough capital for the acquisition.

751
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:37,870
But how did he know
to dig up such an old connection?

752
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:59,290
Why are you just staring at me
without saying anything?

753
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,460
Why do I still miss you
even when you're right here?

754
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:11,470
I guess I just can't get enough
of looking at you.

755
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,270
You'd only known me
as an interior designer,

756
00:52:17,710 --> 00:52:19,540
so I imagine this is hard
for you to accept.

757
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:21,610
For me, too.

758
00:52:22,610 --> 00:52:24,610
I still just see you
as the director.

759
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:30,420
Not for me.

760
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:36,290
So you still just see me
as the director.

761
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:41,560
It just doesn't feel real yet.

762
00:52:45,030 --> 00:52:46,030
Of course.

763
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:48,770
We only just found out yesterday,
after all.

764
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:53,640
I suppose it's different
for a mother and her child.

765
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:55,980
For me,

766
00:52:57,510 --> 00:53:00,520
you already feel so much
like my daughter.

767
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:03,790
I'm sorry.

768
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,230
Could you call me Mom...

769
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:17,730
just once?

770
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:27,680
I'll have to think about that.

771
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:31,680
To be honest...

772
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:37,350
I thought my birth parents
had lost me and were in agony,

773
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:39,150
so I went ahead
with the DNA Registration.

774
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:42,860
I never actually thought
I would find you.

775
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:45,630
So...

776
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:48,960
I never thought about what to do...

777
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:51,830
after we actually met.

778
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:56,740
My gosh, I see.

779
00:53:57,910 --> 00:54:01,440
I'm so sorry.
I didn't consider your feelings.

780
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:06,450
You need time, of course. I'm sorry.

781
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:08,920
No, it's okay.

782
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:19,890
You said she truly...

783
00:54:20,530 --> 00:54:23,530
raised you with so much love.

784
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:29,070
I'd like to thank your mother first,
before anything else.

785
00:54:29,470 --> 00:54:32,010
- It's the right thing to do.
- No, you can't do that.

786
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:35,110
Gosh, I'm sorry.

787
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:37,210
That was thoughtless of me.

788
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:41,520
You haven't told your mother yet,
have you?

789
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:45,590
No. Not yet.

790
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:50,230
But...

791
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:55,230
you mentioned that my birth father
died in a hit-and-run.

792
00:54:58,030 --> 00:54:59,800
What was he like?

793
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:06,940
We really do have...

794
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:10,380
so much to catch up on...

795
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:12,780
for all the years we've lost.

796
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,850
Losing my daughter
tore my heart to pieces,

797
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:23,560
and now my son's suffering
is ripping me apart.

798
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:29,860
You also mentioned
that your son was sick.

799
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:32,800
What's wrong with him?

800
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:36,500
Did I say that my Jin was sick?

801
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:40,580
Yes. You just said he was sick...

802
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:43,910
I see.

803
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:50,720
His liver has been
in very bad shape.

804
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:55,190
He needed a liver transplant,

805
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:59,760
but thankfully, we found a donor
and scheduled the surgery.

806
00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:06,570
So it's really serious, then.

807
00:56:11,470 --> 00:56:15,480
Do you remember your brother at all
from when you were a kid?

808
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:20,980
No.

809
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:23,250
That's a huge relief.

810
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:31,390
(Ms. Shin)

811
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:32,630
Call me now.

812
00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:40,140
So, when is the surgery?

813
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:42,370
Well, it's...

814
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:47,040
It's the hospital. Just a moment.

815
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:50,150
Yes, Doctor.

816
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:55,650
What do you mean?

817
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:57,450
What do you mean, it's canceled?

818
00:57:00,390 --> 00:57:03,660
That's ridiculous, Doctor.
How can this be happening?

819
00:57:06,330 --> 00:57:08,130
Yes, I understand. I'm on my way.

820
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:13,000
Eun Oh, I am so sorry.

821
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:16,910
The donor...
They said he suddenly backed out.

822
00:57:17,770 --> 00:57:20,680
Let's talk on the way.

823
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:23,880
No, it's okay.
You should get to the hospital.

824
00:57:24,210 --> 00:57:26,410
No, I can't just leave you
like this.

825
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:29,750
Your place is on the way.
I'll drop you off.

826
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:34,490
(Who's the author?
I hope the next one comes soon.)

827
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:35,820
(Dokgo Chan's name is hilarious,
but he's so cool.)

828
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:46,500
Park Yeong Ra.

829
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:50,540
- What?
- Stop staring at it. Let's go home.

830
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:52,110
Hey, it's already 6 p.m.

831
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:55,380
Hey, over 10,000 people
have read my webtoon.

832
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:57,610
You've told me that
three times already.

833
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:03,020
Everyone's saying it's amazing.
They're wondering who the author is.

834
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:07,190
They're asking for the next episode,
and they love Dokgo Chan.

835
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:09,790
They're asking
if So Ri is going to die...

836
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:11,960
and if it has a sad ending.

837
00:58:12,830 --> 00:58:15,230
Reading the comments is so surreal
and exciting.

838
00:58:15,430 --> 00:58:17,670
You'll never read them all
even if you stay up all night.

839
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:19,070
They'll just keep coming.

840
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:21,040
So just read them tomorrow
when you're back here.

841
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:22,670
Just a little bit longer.

842
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:27,280
You'd better stop
before your mom gets suspicious.

843
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:33,480
It's always my mom.

844
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,020
Come on, get up.

845
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,690
How can this happen?
How could the donor disappear...

846
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:44,130
when the surgery is
less than ten days away?

847
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:50,530
So what are we supposed to do now?
There aren't any other donors.

848
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:54,970
I'm on my way now.

849
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,370
Yes, of course.
I'll drive carefully.

850
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:08,050
Is the situation that bad?

851
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:16,320
It's been bad for a while now.

852
00:59:18,730 --> 00:59:20,500
I'm sorry for worrying you.

853
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:42,480
You can drop me off here.

854
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:47,190
Please drive safely.

855
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:55,060
Why are you getting out?

856
00:59:57,130 --> 00:59:58,500
You're my daughter.

857
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:00,900
I can't just drop you off
like a passenger.

858
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:07,640
And...

859
01:00:10,410 --> 01:00:12,150
I can call you, right?

860
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:16,250
Of course.

861
01:00:17,650 --> 01:00:18,850
You should get going.

862
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:39,410
Eun Oh.

863
01:00:41,710 --> 01:00:44,610
- Oh, Mom.
- Who was that stylish woman?

864
01:00:46,210 --> 01:00:47,350
A client.

865
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:51,420
The one who got you
that health screening?

866
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:53,520
Yes.

867
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:56,790
We had a meeting today,

868
01:00:57,460 --> 01:00:59,490
and she dropped me off
since it was on her way.

869
01:00:59,930 --> 01:01:01,530
Did you go grocery shopping?

870
01:01:01,930 --> 01:01:04,670
What? Yes,
I stopped by the restaurant.

871
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,200
The galbi has aged perfectly.

872
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:10,300
Of course, it has.

873
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:14,180
But you're home
from work early today.

874
01:01:14,810 --> 01:01:15,810
Yes.

875
01:01:16,610 --> 01:01:18,580
Hey, about that lady...

876
01:01:18,810 --> 01:01:22,020
When will you actually start
construction for her?

877
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:25,420
You got 30,000 dollars
as your design fee months ago.

878
01:01:27,090 --> 01:01:28,090
Well...

879
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:31,760
There were some leaking issues,
and some other things came up.

880
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:33,730
Come on, let's go inside.

881
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:37,070
She paid you months ago.

882
01:01:37,470 --> 01:01:39,370
I guess rich people
are never in a hurry.

883
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:40,770
Hey, wait up.

884
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:54,350
Eun Oh, go and get washed up.
Gang Oh will be home soon.

885
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:56,480
- Should I?
- Yes.

886
01:01:56,580 --> 01:01:58,550
- I'll wash up quickly, then.
- Okay.

887
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:05,960
(Glass noodles)

888
01:02:15,270 --> 01:02:16,400
Yes, this is Lee Ji Hyuk.

889
01:02:16,770 --> 01:02:20,580
- The chairman's ready. Come on up.
- Okay.

890
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:40,090
(Director Ko Seong Hui)

891
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:43,600
(I'm sorry about earlier,
for asking you to call me Mom.)

892
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:45,730
What is this all about?

893
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:53,670
I'm sorry about earlier,
for asking you to call me Mom.

894
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:56,140
Call her Mom?

895
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:58,710
Call me that
when it feels right to you.

896
01:02:59,010 --> 01:03:01,380
I just want to hear it once
before I die.

897
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:02,750
My daughter.

898
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:04,450
"My daughter?"

899
01:03:12,530 --> 01:03:13,690
Wait. Then...

900
01:03:14,530 --> 01:03:17,060
That woman was...

901
01:03:49,030 --> 01:03:51,370
(Our Golden Days)

902
01:03:51,530 --> 01:03:53,970
What are you talking about?
You did this without talking to me?

903
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:56,100
You were going to send your father
to your brother?

904
01:03:56,170 --> 01:03:58,740
Business is about money.
This is no place for emotions.

905
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:00,780
That's why he's still an amateur.

906
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:04,450
This is so lame. I need a chance
to at least look at her...

907
01:04:04,510 --> 01:04:06,180
to see if I could ever see her
as more than a friend.

908
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:09,450
Mom is lying.
What if she's having an affair?

909
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:10,750
I need to get to the bottom of this.

910
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:14,820
They need a compatibility test.
Eun Oh, would you consider...

911
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:19,260
- No, never mind, Eun Oh.
- I'll get tested.
