1
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,990
This is nothing to cry over,
so don't.

2
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,760
I won't cry,

3
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:18,790
because it's nothing to cry about.

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,260
I'm not foolish enough to cry...

5
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,260
when your reason isn't clear.

6
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:27,870
Good.

7
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:31,270
Then we won't bring it up again.

8
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,640
Let's go. I'll grab you a cab.

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,680
I can go by myself.

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,680
Don't.

11
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,350
Do you really think...

12
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,350
I'll get in the cab you call for me?

13
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,690
- Yes.
- How so?

14
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:48,920
I'll make it happen.

15
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,050
What gives you the right?

16
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,290
I'm your senior, aren't I?

17
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,320
A senior should make sure...

18
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,460
his junior gets home safely.

19
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:56,660
I'm like your guardian.

20
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,400
I wouldn't make you go home
by yourself.

21
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,070
At this late hour, past 11 p.m.,
down this dark alleyway?

22
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:07,970
All right.

23
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,040
Today,

24
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,210
we never met.

25
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,120
We'll erase this day
from our memories, Eun Oh.

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,890
The cab will arrive in ten minutes.

27
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,330
Eun Oh?

28
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,160
Eun Oh!

29
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,700
Eun Oh?

30
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,300
Eun Oh!

31
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,680
Ji Eun Oh...

32
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,590
(Ji Eun Oh)

33
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,320
I got a taxi. I'm safely on my way.

34
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,530
Send me a photo of the taxi.

35
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,530
(Send me a photo of the taxi.)

36
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:46,070
(Ji Eun Oh)

37
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,180
You shouldn't have told me,

38
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,080
Ji Eun Oh.

39
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,570
(Episode 3)

40
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,280
- Father.
- Hey.

41
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,850
How much longer
do you have to work late?

42
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,220
Not much longer.

43
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,950
Are you doing well?

44
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,120
Of course, I am.

45
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,760
I'm busy meeting
all the people I wasn't able to.

46
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,160
Oh, I see.

47
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,100
Why?

48
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,900
Never mind. Sleep well.

49
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,830
I will. You should get to bed soon.

50
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,340
Yes.

51
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,810
You want to turn me into a fool...

52
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,250
who happily accepted
10,000 dollars...

53
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,280
instead of the advisor position?

54
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:20,470
(Hwamokgyo Bridge)

55
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,670
I have feelings for you.

56
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,200
I really do.

57
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,410
You...

58
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,270
don't suit me.

59
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,340
I don't get...

60
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,950
What does that mean?

61
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,250
Forget it.

62
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,190
She'll handle her feelings.

63
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,490
Why did she say something
she shouldn't have?

64
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,270
Why do you always go out in a suit?

65
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,440
I told you. I'm meeting people
in the same field.

66
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,510
That fruit box.

67
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,810
Leave it as is.
I'll take care of it.

68
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,720
Hey.

69
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,520
Why are you in a suit, Dad?

70
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:49,120
It's what he wore most of his life,

71
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,660
so casual clothes
are uncomfortable for him.

72
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,520
Do you need some pocket money?

73
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,530
- Come in.
- No, Dad.

74
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,290
I don't need pocket money.

75
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,200
Bye.

76
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,570
Why say that
when we should be giving him money?

77
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,480
Mother.

78
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,710
Why...

79
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,650
Do you need clothes?

80
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,220
Gosh, no. Why would I...

81
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,830
need more clothes?

82
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,430
I could go three years
without repeating an outfit.

83
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,030
If you have enough clothes,

84
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,100
spend this on some nice food.

85
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,170
No.

86
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,570
I still have a lot of cash left.

87
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:43,640
Mother. You don't have to save up
your pocket money.

88
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,440
Spend it every time.

89
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,110
And if you need more, come to me.

90
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,910
- I'm going out.
- No, wait.

91
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,920
- See you later.
- Sang Cheol, wait.

92
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,850
Where is he going?

93
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,620
He has no job to go to...

94
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,730
or people to meet anymore.

95
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:08,100
Mother. Father returned last night.

96
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,030
I'll go and see him.

97
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:34,860
(Part-timers needed, simple tasks)

98
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,030
(Prior experience valued,
Novices accepted, Elderly welcome)

99
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,100
"Prior experience valued,
novices accepted."

100
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,470
"Elderly welcome?"

101
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,070
(Part-timers needed, simple tasks)

102
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,910
While you were away,

103
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,410
I threw out the sauces
that had expired and got new ones.

104
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,680
Use whatever you need.

105
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,680
Okay. I'll do that.

106
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,320
Thanks.

107
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,120
By the way,

108
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,560
how was Sang Cheol's
retirement ceremony?

109
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,530
You talked to him that evening.

110
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:15,230
I'll come with you when you go home.

111
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,500
What?

112
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,970
I got a gift for attending
the birthday party.

113
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,770
They gave me...

114
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,840
a set of red ginseng supplements.

115
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:27,350
I thought it would be
a perfect gift for Sang Cheol,

116
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,080
so I didn't open it.

117
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,380
Sang Cheol's out, Father.

118
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,520
Is he? I'll visit tomorrow, then.

119
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,490
He's going out tomorrow too.
He has lots of people to see.

120
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,530
Maybe a few days...

121
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,690
No. Next week would be better.

122
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,800
He's really busy these days.

123
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,900
Is he? I'll wait, then.

124
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,670
He secured a new job
even before he retired.

125
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,740
So many people must want to see him.

126
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,350
He would be busy.

127
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,450
Hey, Ji Eun Oh.

128
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,420
Come over here.

129
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,390
Did you tell Ji Hyuk?

130
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,060
I bet he said yes, and you cried.

131
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,430
Look at how puffy your eyes are.

132
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:22,470
No, he rejected me.

133
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,640
What? Say that again.

134
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,410
Why should I?

135
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:28,910
Didn't you foresee as much?

136
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,880
I'm no fortune teller
or weather forecaster.

137
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,040
I can't do that.

138
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:35,110
What do you mean?
Will it rain today?

139
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,150
Why are you here
when it's not yet lunchtime?

140
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,820
I came here for a sandwich.

141
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,190
Why are you three huddled together?

142
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,920
Explain why.

143
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,130
I mean, why are you here?

144
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:52,200
Why are you asking
like I'm not allowed to be here?

145
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:55,500
Ji Eun Oh. Bring the second quarter
expense sheet.

146
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:58,200
I tried to sign it last time,
but you stormed out in a huff.

147
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,040
Did I?

148
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:02,440
Oh, right. At the gukbap restaurant.

149
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,810
Seong Wu, can you get the ledger?

150
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,980
Sure.

151
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,220
An iced Americano?

152
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,320
No.

153
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,590
Seong Jae will join me for lunch.

154
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,220
- Will I?
- Yes.

155
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,660
Thank you.

156
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:28,630
Ji Eun Oh.

157
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,070
The extra volunteer expenses
for this quarter.

158
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,570
Our senior Hong Jeong Min
will cover it.

159
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,870
Tell me when he wires it to you.

160
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,110
That's great.
I was wondering how we'd afford it.

161
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,610
Come on. We're leaving.

162
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:41,810
I'll come back another time.

163
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:44,650
(Cafe Agit)

164
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,180
What was that just now?

165
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,720
You lied, didn't you?

166
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,920
About what?

167
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:56,390
What...

168
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,200
What...

169
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,540
You two didn't act like
one of you...

170
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,970
asked the other out
and got turned down.

171
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,710
You were so nonchalant.

172
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,910
Because I don't feel a thing.

173
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,710
You don't feel a thing?
You just got rejected.

174
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,880
Yes.

175
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,810
Even when you see
the guy who rejected you?

176
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,420
Yes.

177
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,550
Are you sure he rejected you?

178
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,850
I said I had feelings for him.

179
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,620
I asked him out, and he said
he didn't return my feelings...

180
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,690
and that he wouldn't date me.

181
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,760
That's a clear rejection.

182
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,330
That's even weirder.

183
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,730
Did you sort through
your feelings overnight?

184
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,840
Ji Hyuk never beats around the bush,

185
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,910
and I'm pretty good
at getting the point.

186
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,610
I guess that's why.

187
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,180
Let's get to work, Su Jeong.

188
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,120
That I broke up with Yeon Hui.

189
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,190
You told Eun Oh, didn't you?

190
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,330
Yes.

191
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,430
Why would you tell her that?

192
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,000
Why you of all people?

193
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,230
- What about me?
- You have a crush on her!

194
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,540
What if I do? Can't I tell her that?

195
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,910
I can do nothing but crush on her.

196
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,180
You knew I'd reject her.

197
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,080
You knew that.

198
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,550
Not really.

199
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,680
How would I know that?

200
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,580
Hey, Park Seong Jae!

201
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,750
Oh, that.

202
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,250
I started having a crush
on Eun Oh six years ago.

203
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,050
But I wasn't sure
about your feelings for her,

204
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,320
so I asked how you were feeling.

205
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,860
When I asked if you were interested,
you said that to me.

206
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,060
That wasn't the only time.

207
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,290
I think I told you three times.

208
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,760
Yes, you told me three times.

209
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,230
Whenever I tried to approach Eun Oh,

210
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:43,130
you caught on right away
and tried to stop me.

211
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,140
You told me to forget it.

212
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,000
You said we couldn't be with her.

213
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:47,910
I couldn't be with her,

214
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:49,640
and you shouldn't be with her.

215
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,440
You're starting to digress,
Seong Jae.

216
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,680
Why do I always have to do
as you say?

217
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,210
And why do you always
have to draw the line...

218
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,380
as if it were the right thing to do?

219
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,750
Then why did you do as I said?

220
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,820
Because you're Lee Ji Hyuk!

221
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,850
No. You did because
it was the right thing to do.

222
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:03,690
Because you agreed
and were convinced.

223
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:05,990
You know all that.

224
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,990
So I don't understand...

225
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,460
why you told her
Yeon Hui and I broke up.

226
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,970
I made a promise to Eun Oh.

227
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,700
- What?
- She asked me...

228
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,470
to tell her when you don't have
a girlfriend at least once,

229
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:22,740
and I had no reason to refuse.

230
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,050
She wanted to tell you
about her feelings at least once.

231
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,650
But why do you have to be
so condescending...

232
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:32,750
about her feelings like that?
You're being a jerk.

233
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,490
Hey, Park Seong Jae.

234
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,590
Are you yelling at me now?

235
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,520
I'm the one who should be mad now.

236
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,760
You've never let me ask her out,
you jerk.

237
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:44,900
Hey, Lee Ji Hyuk.

238
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,330
Do you even know how hard it is
to be Daddy Long Legs?

239
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:49,170
It's you who chose to be one.

240
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,270
Because I had to do that at least.

241
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:55,170
When you care about Eun Oh so much,

242
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:57,140
why did you make her ask me out
and get hurt?

243
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,880
You're the one who hurt her!

244
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,010
Don't be ridiculous.

245
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,410
To me, Eun Oh is like Su Bin.

246
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,550
Have I ever made her
get the wrong idea?

247
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,880
Did I look like
I wanted to go out with her?

248
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,790
You're unbelievable, Lee Ji Hyuk.

249
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,390
Is that why you gave her
a flat refusal?

250
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:16,330
I did it for her sake.

251
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,300
So she wouldn't have
any lingering feelings.

252
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:25,800
Is that why you acted like that
after being so cruel to her...

253
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,540
so she wouldn't have
any lingering feelings?

254
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,210
As if nothing happened?
Just like that?

255
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,910
You said you rejected her.

256
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,980
But how could you meet her
so casually like that?

257
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,720
That's because
I have no feelings for her.

258
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,180
Was I supposed
to act like I was confused?

259
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,550
How can you be so casual?

260
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,520
How can you not care about her?

261
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,260
You have to handle
your own feelings.

262
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,590
It's not that
I told her to ask me out.

263
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:49,190
And now, I have to help her move on?

264
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:50,590
Why are you being like this?

265
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,230
Eun Oh and I
are friends from school.

266
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,870
You're unbelievable.

267
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,070
Just take the hot dog.

268
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,770
Forget it.

269
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,740
Just answer the phone.

270
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:08,780
Darn it.

271
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,450
Hey, the hot dog...

272
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,120
(Jung Bo A)

273
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,090
Hello?

274
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,790
Help?

275
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,790
What's the matter?

276
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,600
- Please take your credit card.
- Okay.

277
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,640
Did you not forget anything?

278
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,940
Forget?

279
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,140
The stamp card.

280
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,540
If you get one more,
you'll get a free drink.

281
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,640
Oh, right. I forgot.

282
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,980
You have a good memory.

283
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,550
You are one of our regulars.

284
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,550
Here. I'll give you a new one.

285
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,220
Make sure to get a free drink
next time.

286
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,020
Okay. Thank you.

287
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,900
Hey. Try shaking your head
three times.

288
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,170
- Shaking my head?
- Yes. Like babies do.

289
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,700
I need to check
if you're in your right mind now.

290
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,770
Go ahead and do it.

291
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,970
I'm shaking my head.

292
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,010
Who am I?

293
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,810
Tell me who I am
and what month and day it is today.

294
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,980
I'm curious too.

295
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,080
About what you'll say.

296
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,280
See?

297
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,520
You are being really weird now.

298
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,760
(Cafe Agit)

299
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:31,730
Are you all right?

300
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,200
I guess rumors spread fast.
It's embarrassing.

301
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,940
You probably need something,

302
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,200
like drinks or a little chat.

303
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,510
I don't need anything.

304
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,940
But I want to know.

305
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:47,810
Didn't Ji Hyuk tell you?

306
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,350
He doesn't want to go out with me.

307
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,250
He says he has no intention
of dating me.

308
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,750
But I'm fine.

309
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,890
I'm actually surprised
that I'm okay.

310
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,730
I see.

311
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,730
I guess that's how it is.

312
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,230
You didn't sweep the yard, did you?

313
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:09,400
That doesn't suit you, Eun Oh.

314
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,400
What do you mean?

315
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,800
Pretending to be okay...

316
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,410
when you are actually not.

317
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,210
That doesn't sound like you.

318
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:23,110
Call me if you need someone
to chat with.

319
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,720
Anytime.

320
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,920
I'm really okay, though.

321
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,970
Does he mean
that my outfit doesn't suit me?

322
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,010
Or does he mean
that I'm not good enough...

323
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,210
for someone fashionable?

324
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,280
Is that it?

325
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:56,680
Because I'm not sexy?

326
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,220
That can't be true.

327
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,590
Lee Ji Hyuk...

328
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:03,720
isn't that kind of person.

329
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,160
What?

330
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,530
Su Jeong.

331
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,930
What do you think he meant?

332
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,270
I can't hear you.

333
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,700
What kind of woman...

334
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,810
suits Ji Hyuk?

335
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,910
She's out of her mind.

336
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,240
What's with your dress?

337
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:59,680
It's a dress I wear
when I run away from a blind date.

338
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,350
A blind date?

339
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:03,810
You know,

340
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,750
rumors about me and him
have spread far and wide,

341
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,490
so I won't be able to marry
someone from the upper class.

342
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,790
My father tried so hard and managed
to find me someone nice,

343
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,990
but if I go on the blind date today,

344
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:18,900
I'll probably be walking down
the aisle next week.

345
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,570
I understand the difficult situation
you are in,

346
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,070
but what do you need my help for?

347
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,710
I told him
that I was seeing someone.

348
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,010
No way.

349
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:35,350
Someone is probably taking
photos of us right now.

350
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:41,250
Is that why you told me to sit
with my back to the door?

351
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:45,790
But it's not something
that will be over after today.

352
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:48,460
I'll hire someone
to act as my boyfriend.

353
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,870
Hello.

354
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:56,800
I'm Lee Su Bin.

355
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,300
Oh, right.

356
00:19:58,870 --> 00:19:59,870
My name is...

357
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,210
(CEO Ma Sang Su)

358
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,710
This is me.

359
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,210
I guess your surname is "This Is,"
and your first name is "Me."

360
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,090
Is that a Gen Z-style joke?

361
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,160
Yes.

362
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,230
Oh, hello.

363
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:25,400
My gosh. You're here.

364
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,560
- It's been a long time.
- Yes.

365
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,900
- Have you been doing well?
- Yes. Please have a seat.

366
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,070
I'm such a snob.

367
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,170
When I'm crazy about love,

368
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,570
I still don't want to lose
my dad's background.

369
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,980
You already lost your love,

370
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,350
so you can't afford to lose
your dad's background too.

371
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:47,120
Exactly. That's why I'm a snob.

372
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,290
Is there anyone in this world
who is not a snob?

373
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,390
Whether it's immediate gain...

374
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,790
or something that comes
a year or ten years late,

375
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,230
everyone lives
for their own benefit.

376
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,900
And that's just normal.

377
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:03,030
That's quite comforting.

378
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:09,510
Unless you want to stay single
for the rest of your life,

379
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:12,910
you should consider marrying someone
your father wants.

380
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,810
You said
Seo Jae Uk left for Australia.

381
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:20,250
I'm not waiting
for Jae Uk to come back.

382
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,590
Tell you how?

383
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:26,260
Yes. As soon as you retired,

384
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,390
you got a new job
in the same industry.

385
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:32,100
So everyone is saying
that you must know what to do.

386
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,830
You're finally making me come clean.
Oh, well.

387
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,340
It's a company
run by my in-laws' relatives.

388
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,380
My father-in-law's cousin
is the CEO.

389
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:50,050
What?

390
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:53,520
My father-in-law practically
begged them to get me a job there.

391
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,620
Getting a job in the same industry
through connections?

392
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,020
It's just too hard.

393
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,890
All your past experience,
skills, and connections.

394
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:03,060
They are nothing.

395
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,660
You must've come to see me
because you've been there.

396
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:08,670
Yes.

397
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:10,300
Whether you have connections or not,

398
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,440
it's just too hard to be hired
in the same industry again.

399
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:15,940
Just give up and find something new.

400
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,840
Still, I want to do something
I've done before.

401
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,010
How would I start something new?

402
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,780
I get it. You'll need time
to wrap your head around this.

403
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:31,990
That's when it hit me.

404
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:35,660
Nothing tops the joy
of making money.

405
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,330
How was it that thrilling?

406
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,060
Month after month,

407
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:43,130
money came rolling in
like I had hit the jackpot.

408
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:50,370
You must believe...

409
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,610
you have great commercial value.

410
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,610
Commercial value?

411
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,150
I mean, you're young.

412
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:00,450
Although, not that young,
if you ask me.

413
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,790
You've got a pretty face
and a toned body.

414
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:08,390
You must think
you have everything a man wants.

415
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:12,730
That's why you're so confident,
despite being jobless.

416
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,200
You've got it all wrong.

417
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,000
Or maybe you think I'm someone else.

418
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,700
You're a YouTuber, is that it?

419
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:22,510
Not having steady earnings...

420
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,710
doesn't count as having a job.

421
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,280
It depends on how you see it.

422
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,740
I'm trying to put myself on the map.

423
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,550
What about me?

424
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,480
How do you see me?

425
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,960
A, you make decent money.
B, you make decent money.

426
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,320
Since you earn good money,

427
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,460
you must think
you've got everything...

428
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,030
gold diggers want.

429
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,100
That's hardly true.

430
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,300
What?

431
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:49,430
You see,

432
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,800
I'll be quite the catch...

433
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:54,810
once I get some hair planted
on this receding hairline.

434
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,470
Why haven't you gotten around to it?

435
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,580
I've been busy...

436
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:00,480
earning money.

437
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,810
- I see.
- Right.

438
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:09,820
What's this?

439
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,290
Did you already make
our wedding invitations?

440
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:16,190
This is a new kind
of wedding proposal.

441
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:18,030
Why didn't I think of this?

442
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,500
Take a look, Ji Wan.

443
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,670
Everyone,

444
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:26,500
I'm finally getting married.

445
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,340
- Ji Wan...
- Bride, Jin Hong Mi!

446
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,170
Groom, Sung...

447
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,380
(Sung Jae Ho and Jin Hong Mi,
We're getting married.)

448
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,480
Sung Jae Ho?

449
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:43,720
What...

450
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,020
What is this?

451
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,860
My wedding invitation.

452
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,660
Your wedding invitation?

453
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,070
You're getting married?

454
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:56,870
To someone else and not me?

455
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:00,200
I've made it clear
I'm not interested in marrying you.

456
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,140
You're the one
who chose not to hear me.

457
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,150
Are you saying I'm to blame?

458
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:11,480
In some way, yes.

459
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:26,830
Wait a minute. We went...

460
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:30,070
on a four-day trip
to the Philippines last month.

461
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,470
Were you planning your wedding
during that time?

462
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,970
Were you seeing another guy
while you were with me?

463
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:37,640
If you hadn't offered me
those three choices,

464
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:40,610
I would've dated you
until the day before my wedding.

465
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,210
You're healthy, fit, sweet,

466
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:45,480
and stylish.

467
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:48,120
But I don't like your background.

468
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:49,990
In fact, I hate it.

469
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,230
Don't think about
coming to see me at work.

470
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,390
I quit my job.

471
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:00,360
Don't crash my wedding either.

472
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,270
Only invited guests
are allowed inside.

473
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,870
Is this what they mean
by a living nightmare?

474
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:15,680
Enjoy your dessert before leaving.
I had fun while it lasted.

475
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,060
Hong Mi, wait.

476
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,770
It'll be hard to let go
of the warmth of your arms.

477
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:43,040
Still, you can't force me
to be with you!

478
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,340
Hey, Jin Hong Mi!

479
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:45,410
Hong Mi.

480
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,620
Dating violence is considered
a crime these days, Ji Wan.

481
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:05,830
You believed what you wanted to...

482
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:07,930
and loved me however you saw fit.

483
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,170
Right?

484
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:11,700
Neither of us will regret it,

485
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,840
because you loved fully,
and I received fully.

486
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,440
You're good with words,
which makes it...

487
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,880
- even more sickening.
- You won't stop me, right?

488
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,180
I won't.

489
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,580
- You...
- Clinging to a witch like me...

490
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,910
will only end up being your loss.

491
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,880
Ji Wan, I'm a witch.

492
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:30,750
This is who I've always been.

493
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,200
(At some point,
calculated strokes must stop.)

494
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,230
(Da Vinci's sfumato technique
was used effectively.)

495
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,700
(Interpreting
"Innate Rhythm of Rose")

496
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,910
(9 p.m. alarm)

497
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,550
I'm calling it a day.

498
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:07,990
Good night.

499
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:14,460
Starting this week,
work until 10 p.m. if you can.

500
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,200
Artists preparing
for solo exhibitions...

501
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,670
stay up all night if needed.

502
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,100
Always be prepared for an interview
in case a reporter...

503
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,340
makes a surprise visit
to the studio.

504
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,570
Got it?

505
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,220
Isn't Yeong Ra
pushing herself too hard?

506
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:41,960
Ask her to join us for dinner
at least 2 to 3 times a week.

507
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:44,990
She doesn't have the time.

508
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:47,160
Besides, this is her choice.

509
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,100
What can we do
when an artist gets in the zone?

510
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:52,570
Honey, we're not artists,
so we don't understand.

511
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:53,900
Unbelievable.

512
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,640
How was she born
with an artistic gene...

513
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:59,540
when it's absent
in both our families?

514
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:03,080
There's actually
a more pressing matter.

515
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:06,020
That stalker lurking around her.

516
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:07,880
Can't you have him caught quickly?

517
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,990
I've been losing sleep over it.

518
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,650
I told you not to worry.

519
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,090
Mr. Jung was in the special forces.

520
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,260
Her stalker has been
sending flowers every day.

521
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,060
If that's all,
then catching him is pointless.

522
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:24,000
He'll be let go with a warning
unless there's a bigger crime.

523
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,470
Trust Mr. Jung to keep her safe.

524
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,540
Once she wraps up her exhibition,

525
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,210
we'll need to marry her away
so I can feel at ease.

526
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,780
Seong Jae should marry first.

527
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,180
Yeong Ra's still quite young,
after all.

528
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:37,810
I'm home.

529
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,920
Hey. You must be exhausted.

530
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,150
Have you had dinner?

531
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,590
Yes, a hearty one.

532
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,890
You should rest. I'll head upstairs.

533
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,060
Take a seat.

534
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,730
He got home at 11 p.m.

535
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:53,030
Save the nagging for later
and let him rest.

536
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,060
Have a seat.

537
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:03,440
When do you plan on marrying?

538
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,740
I don't have anyone
to marry just yet.

539
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,910
If you don't have a girl by 33,
you should get one.

540
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:09,750
Go on blind dates.

541
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:11,710
I'd like to marry someone...

542
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,220
after I've gotten to know her
for a while.

543
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,550
A while?

544
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:19,190
How long do you think it takes
to really know someone?

545
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:22,530
More time
doesn't necessarily guarantee it.

546
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:25,460
Don't act so childish.

547
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,530
Either way,

548
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,370
I'm going to marry the person
I naturally end up dating.

549
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:33,540
If I marry, that is.

550
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,770
Seong Jae, hold on.

551
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,540
What do you mean by that?

552
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,710
Are you saying
you might never marry?

553
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,850
Seong Jae, that can't happen.

554
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,220
That's not what I meant, Mother.

555
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:52,560
Naturally, I should marry,
and I will.

556
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,790
Please don't worry.

557
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:57,890
Anyway, I brought some work
from the office.

558
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,070
Something feels off.

559
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:09,970
There's nothing wrong
with what he said.

560
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:11,410
He hasn't found someone...

561
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:13,010
because he sets his standards
too high.

562
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,950
That wacko.

563
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,150
I can't believe
he ordered more wine...

564
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,620
and nearly made me
miss the last bus.

565
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:24,450

00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:30,890
It's not like you
to call at this hour.

568
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:34,700
Mr. Ma Sang Su isn't interested
in seeing you again.

569
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,600
He called you at this hour
just to tell you that?

570
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,200
Actually, his call woke me up.

571
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,940
Anyway, I've passed on the message.

572
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,740
Are you kidding me?

(SUTANDARD,

574
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:53,320
I lost seven subscribers.

575
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,650
Do you consider running
a YouTube channel that makes...

576
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:57,090
under 1,000 dollars a job?

577
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:58,620
Just wait and see.

578
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,020
I'll eventually gain
over 100,000 subscribers,

579
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,360
and then over a million.

580

You wait and see.

00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:09,170
You will be charged after the beep.

582
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:14,200
Oh Jae Jin, are you skipping work
or just running late?

583
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,240
You probably don't know...

584
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,570
you should call
if you're late for work.

585
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:19,910
That must be why you haven't called,

586
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:21,310
even though you're 50 minutes late.

587
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:24,710

Everyone, please greet
Chief Director Oh Jae Jin.

596
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,440
Right.

597
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:53,880
He's actually my only son.

598
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,280
Out of greed,
I had him start as an intern...

599
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,850
and work his way up
to learn the ropes.

600
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,550
Please be understanding.

I'm Oh Jae Jin.

602
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,430
But... Hold on.

603
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:19,000
HR didn't issue a notice.

604
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:21,940
It was probably just posted
on the intranet.

606
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,040
his old team first,

607
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,210
which is why
this was our first stop.

608
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,650
Who's going to be his mentor?

609
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,220
Who wants to teach him
how things are done?

610
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,620
I'll do it.

611
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:37,150
I'll mentor you,

612
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:39,290
but know this, Oh Jae Jin.
Keep this up,

613
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:41,060
and people will think
you have ties at this company.

614
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:42,390
I warned you many times.

615
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:44,560
Twice is a mistake,
but the third time...

616
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,900
means you're incompetent.

must I put up with this?

00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,080
the day off today.

Mr. Lee.

I believe I should talk
to you separately,

630
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,600
since you were my mentor.

631
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:01,670

I was really itching to tell you.

635

Why did you let me
off the hook so often?

636

I mean, I made so many mistakes.

You should've scolded me,
not protected me from my mistakes.

to avoid mistakes.

00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:04,900
Don't.

718
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:06,370
Mom, that's off-limits.

719
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:08,070
Of course.

720
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:09,310
I can't feel your forehead,

721
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:10,870
put you to bed,

722
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:12,170
or make you beef bone soup.

723
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:15,180
As clever as ever, Mom.

724
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:18,810
Come on. I used to teach
elementary school, remember?

725
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:22,050
Let's stop chatting out here
and go home.

726
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:24,350
He should get some rest.

727
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:27,590
Mother. We won't cook cheonggukjang
or stewed zucchini today.

728
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,590
I'll make abalone,
radish, and hijiki rice.

729
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:31,160
My eldest son's favorite.

730
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:34,230
Didn't you just get back?
You'll go back out to buy that?

731
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,200
I always have
a stash of ingredients...

732
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,600
for my kids' favorites
in the freezer.

733
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,570
- I'll carry that for you.
- Okay.

734
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,270
- Let's go.
- Yes, let's go.

735
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,810
The apples aren't bruised,

736
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:53,580
and the money's all there.
You can count it if you want.

737
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:56,250
It's fine.

738
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,050
I'm done with you, then.
I'd like to see your father.

739
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,420
I know visitors are allowed.

740
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:03,730
Did you just talk down to me?

741
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:06,230
If I were to join your company,

742
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,100
you'd be my superior, however young,

743
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,600
and I'd have to treat you as such,

744
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,700
but right now,

745
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:13,270
you're nothing but the son...

746
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,570
of my old friend, Mr. Choi the CEO.

747
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,670
Step aside.

748
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,940
Unless you want a fuss
that will make you look bad.

749
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:30,420
Don't say anything stupid.

750
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,890
I hope you don't.

751
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,860
(Hanguk Hospital)

752
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:42,870
Goodness.

753
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:50,540
Why did you work yourself sick?

754
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:55,080
I'd known you were the type...

755
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,780
to push yourself too hard.

756
00:42:58,150 --> 00:42:59,720
I'm sorry.

757
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:02,920
Don't be.

758
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:07,120
Things don't always go
the way we want.

759
00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:09,560
We know that well enough.

760
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,670
Can we hold hands at least?

761
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:39,090
I hope you fight well and win, Mr. Choi.

762
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:54,200
My gosh.

763
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:58,410
I could wait until Father comes home
so we could eat together.

764
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:00,340
Who knows when he'll come home?

765
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,340
We never know.

766
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:04,280
He does what he wants these days.

767
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:07,320
Eat as much as you can.

768
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:11,590
I'll wait and eat with my son.

769
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:13,020
Grandma...

770
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:16,660
She finds joy
in eating with her son,

771
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:18,730
and I find joy
in watching my son eat.

772
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:23,170
What are you doing these days?

773
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:25,530
My days are pretty much the same.

774
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:28,170
Today was like yesterday,

775
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,140
and tomorrow will be like today.

776
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:32,210
Do you exercise?

777
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:34,410
Have you finished
the vitamin D I got you?

778
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:36,650
There's still some left.

779
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:39,520
You missed a few days.
I told you not to.

780
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:43,120
Mom. You need to watch your health.

781
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:47,860
Your father had a hard time
looking after your mother.

782
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,460
I have a pretty good life.

783
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:54,100
I met and married
your handsome dad...

784
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:55,730
and had three good-looking kids.

785
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,670
And my eldest is so dependable.

786
00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:00,440
Do you mean that?

787
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:02,200
Yes.

788
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:03,970
You can't call me "dependable."

789
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:05,510
You should say that about Father.

790
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:08,740
He's my other half, so it's a given
that doesn't have to be said.

791
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:12,080
Do you...

792
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:14,220
believe in him?

793
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:16,490
How could I live if I didn't?

794
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:22,390
Grandpa gave you such a hard time.

795
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:27,100
My mom suffered from dementia
for over ten years.

796
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,700
Your dad helped without a complaint.

797
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:31,970
He got himself...

798
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,240
a good wife.

799
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,420
I'm back.

800
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:52,320
- Honey.
- Yes.

801
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:55,260
Dinner is abalone,
radish, and hijiki rice.

802
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,230
Is Ji Hyuk home?

803
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:00,700
He left work early
because of a headache.

804
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,800
I found him getting medicine
at a pharmacy.

805
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:05,070
Don't go upstairs.

806
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:06,340
I told him to rest.

807
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,040
Okay.

808
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:10,240
Did he say anything else?

809
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:12,070
He did.

810
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:13,810
He asked about me.

811
00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:16,980
And he told me
to take my supplements.

812
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,010
Yes, good.

814
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:33,830
By the way, honey.

815
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,100
What did he say
when you returned it?

816
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:38,430
The son was a jerk, wasn't he?

817
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:41,300
You should've smacked his head.

818
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:43,810
I did with a few words.

819
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:45,610
You did?

820
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:47,840
Why did you just use words?

821
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,780
You should've smacked that brat
in the forehead.

822
00:46:50,410 --> 00:46:52,850
I should've gone with you.
I'd have hit him.

(Letter of Resignation)

824
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:57,490
Good for you.

825
00:46:58,090 --> 00:46:59,120
You did well.

826
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,860
At first,

827
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:04,360
I thought
we should've wrapped the box nicely.

828
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:06,830
But no.

829
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:09,030

Mr. Lee. Come to my office.

837
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:55,680
Yes. I'll take a look,
then visit the site.

838
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:57,680
Then I can make suggestions.

839
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:02,720
I wouldn't bother with anyone else,

840
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:06,460
but I thought
I should give this to you in person.

841
00:48:16,370 --> 00:48:17,530
It's an invitation to my wedding.

842
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:19,800
I see what it is.

843
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:21,140
By the way,

844
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:23,840
since you're detail-oriented,

845
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:26,340
I'd like you
to handle the gift money.

846
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:29,040
Come to the hall an hour or two
before the wedding starts.

You'll leave without handing over
your duties? That's not right!

Someone else
can hand over my duties.

and became a regular employee.

and method.

856

Even if you leave,
it will go to another company.

I resigned already.

00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,030
I'll talk to him
so he'll take you back.

You get it, don't you?

872
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:18,990
Try as we might,
but we're just employees.

Look. Even a fly would slide off.

Are you starting to realize it now?

881
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:53,460
Were you so shocked yesterday...

882
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:54,620
that you were having PTSD?

883
00:50:55,490 --> 00:50:57,060
That's not true.

884
00:50:57,730 --> 00:51:00,130
But I guess
you are right about that.

885
00:51:00,130 --> 00:51:02,560
No. I'm just cleaning.

886
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:07,100
Now that the construction is over,

887
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:09,300
you should take some time off
and go on a trip.

888
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,410
I've been away for a while
because of the construction.

How can I go on a trip?

890
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:14,180

I'll have sparkling water
instead of beer.

00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,040
What?

898
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:46,110
That's what he orders...

899
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:47,980
when he has something
to think about for a long time.

900
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:52,150
It's a problem
that you know too much about him.

901
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:54,520
Are you worried about him
in this situation?

902
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:58,920
You should check the website and see
if there's a request for a quote.

903
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,090
I'll bring him what he ordered.

904
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:03,460
No. I'll do that.

905
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:04,890
As I always do.

906
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:07,030
Are you sure you'll be all right?

907
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,300
When you saw him last time, you hid.

908
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:13,600
It was a mistake.

909
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,640
(A 2-month trip to South America)

910
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:19,980
(South America travel plans
and reviews)

911
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:30,890
Sparkling water.

912
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:35,360
Your iced Americano...

913
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:38,190
and tiramisu.

914
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:39,690
Oh, right.

915
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:42,030
Your card and receipt.

916
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:44,530
Thanks.

917
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,140
I'll go and clean the restroom.

918
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:02,820
What should I do
about this suffocating atmosphere?

919
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,970
Please find me the earliest flight
to Sao Paulo.

920
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:25,740
I don't care
about the travel agency.

921
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:27,840
After today.

922
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:31,580
Ji Hyuk.

923
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:34,450
Don't we have to pay
for living expenses now?

924
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:40,420
Of course, I am.

925
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:43,690
I'm busy meeting
all the people I wasn't able to.

926
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:45,630
You want to turn me into a fool...

927
00:53:45,630 --> 00:53:46,960
who happily accepted
10,000 dollars...

928
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,100
instead of the advisor position?

929
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:52,770
I'm really sorry. I messed up.

930
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:59,110
I'm sorry.

931
00:53:59,810 --> 00:54:01,110
I'll call you back.

932
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:23,470
Hey, let's eat. It's almost 2 p.m.

933
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:24,530
I'm starving.

934
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:25,870
You're right.

935
00:54:26,330 --> 00:54:27,400
Go ahead and have lunch.

936
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:30,370
You're supposed to eat first today.

937
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:33,410
Didn't I eat earlier?

938
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:35,480
I think I ate something.

939
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:38,150
That's the snack I gave you.
Cookies.

940
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:41,650
Oh, right.
That's why I'm not hungry.

941
00:54:41,650 --> 00:54:42,750
You can go and eat.

942
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:54,860
What...

943
00:54:57,530 --> 00:54:58,530
Ji Hyuk.

944
00:55:04,610 --> 00:55:06,680
You've been here for three hours.

945
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:10,080
What? So?

946
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,280
Do you really have to stay here
this long?

947
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:13,780
You don't have anything to do.

948
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:21,660
Is this a place...

949
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:24,090
I can come
only when I have something to do?

950
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:26,700
Am I only allowed to stay here
for a certain amount of time?

951
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,270
Tell Eun Oh to come.

952
00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:31,830
I don't want to. Talk to me.

953
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:34,070
- Darn it.
- Why should I talk to you...

954
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:35,200
when you're not Ji Eun Oh?

955
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,370
I mean...

956
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:38,310
I'm sorry, Ji Hyuk.

957
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:44,450
You're so cruel.

958
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:46,750
Don't you see Eun Oh's struggling?

959
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:48,880
Don't be absurd, Su Jeong.

960
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,190
I'm sorry, Ji Hyuk.

961
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:54,960
Ji Eun Oh.

962
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,590
I guess you are uncomfortable
seeing me here.

963
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:05,800
Yes.

964
00:56:06,470 --> 00:56:07,500
Put up with it,

965
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,340
and don't let it show.

966
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:12,210
I came here to feel comfortable.

967
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:14,380
To be comfortable here.

968
00:56:15,810 --> 00:56:17,510
That's what this place is about,
and it's always been that way.

969
00:56:18,310 --> 00:56:19,580
And it will always be that way.

970
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:36,060
From today on,
Lee Ji Hyuk is my archenemy.

971
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:46,140
Let's play basketball.

972
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:48,540
(Lee Ji Hyuk)

973
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:51,850
(Chief Director Park Seong Jae)

974
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:52,850
Come to the place.

975
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:55,420
At this hour?

976
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:57,120
I know you're free.

977
00:56:58,290 --> 00:56:59,320
I resigned.

978
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,360
Ji Hyuk!

979
00:57:08,430 --> 00:57:10,700
Ji Hyuk! Wait.

980
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:19,940
Well...

981
00:57:20,510 --> 00:57:22,380
If I ask you to go to a park
or another cafe to talk,

982
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:23,980
you won't go, will you?

983
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:24,980
No.

984
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:27,420
Then, I'll say it here.

985
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:31,790
- Eun Oh.
- Why don't I suit you?

986
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:39,160
You're being like that again.

987
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:42,630
I'm not trying to argue with you.

988
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:44,930
And I'm not asking you
to think it over.

989
00:57:44,930 --> 00:57:45,930
It's not like that.

990
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:48,000
I just need to understand.

991
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:50,670
Understand?

992
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:52,670
I don't understand what it means.

993
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:53,840
I don't get it.

994
00:57:54,110 --> 00:57:55,940
When I don't understand,
I can't solve the problem...

995
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:57,380
and find the answer.

996
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:59,310
I can't move on
without finding the answer.

997
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:01,820
So, I need you
to explain it to me in detail.

998
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,850
Why don't I deserve to be with you?

999
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:07,090
Once I understand,

1000
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:09,290
I'll go back to being a good friend
like I was before.

1001
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:16,870
I don't want to lose you.

1002
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:21,840
I liked you as a person first.

1003
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:37,190
When it's hard
to be straightforward,

1004
00:58:37,950 --> 00:58:39,650
people say things indirectly.

1005
00:58:41,890 --> 00:58:42,960
Did you not feel that?

1006
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:46,130
Why are you being like that?

1007
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:49,030
You've never done that before.

1008
00:58:51,370 --> 00:58:52,530
When someone...

1009
00:58:53,270 --> 00:58:56,570
doesn't meet your standards,
you say the person doesn't suit you.

1010
00:58:58,710 --> 00:59:01,580
- So what on earth does that...
- Stop acting like a child.

1011
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:05,380
Why are you forcing me
to reveal all my feelings?

1012
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:06,510
You're being rude.

1013
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:08,880
As far as I can remember,

1014
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,720
I've never given you any false hope.

1015
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:14,120
Have I?

1016
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:22,100
I cared about you, liked you,
trusted you, and adored you.

1017
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:24,300
As a person and a friend.

1018
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,270
You know that, right?

1019
00:59:31,870 --> 00:59:33,340
Then you should take care
of the rest.

1020
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:36,140
You're a grown-up.

1021
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:38,380
There are times when you have to
infer things yourself.

1022
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:41,280
Imagine, consider,
and speculate on every scenario.

1023
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:43,990
Try everything.

1024
00:59:44,990 --> 00:59:46,350
Then you'll find the answer.

1025
00:59:48,890 --> 00:59:50,490
So you're still not telling me.

1026
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:53,860
- I don't think that's hard...
- That's what you think.

1027
00:59:55,230 --> 00:59:56,630
Why or what?

1028
00:59:57,430 --> 00:59:58,800
That's not important.

1029
00:59:59,670 --> 01:00:00,700
The point is...

1030
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:04,040
that I don't think of you
as my partner.

1031
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:09,640
You and I can never be
in a romantic relationship.

1032
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:13,010
The important thing is that
I have no intention.

1033
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:16,920
Ji Eun Oh.

1034
01:00:19,090 --> 01:00:20,090
I suppose...

1035
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:23,290
I cherished you too much...

1036
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:27,160
if you think you have the right
to confront me like this.

1037
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:31,400
Pull yourself together,

1038
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:34,500
and don't make me
uneasy like this again.

1039
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:38,770
If you can't hide how upset you are,

1040
01:00:39,770 --> 01:00:42,010
you'd be better off
quitting the cafe.

1041
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:45,310
You of all people know...

1042
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:48,120
why this cafe was created.

1043
01:00:51,790 --> 01:00:54,060
- Answer me.
- I hear you.

1044
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:57,590
It'll end here.

1045
01:00:58,690 --> 01:00:59,830
I heard you loud and clear.

1046
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:36,860
No one knows, do they?

1047
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:39,100
No one knows how I feel.

1048
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:13,470
As if anyone really knows
what cruelty looks like.

1049
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:15,370
My father doesn't understand,

1050
01:02:15,870 --> 01:02:17,110
and neither does anyone else.

1051
01:02:17,870 --> 01:02:18,870
No one gets me...

1052
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:21,610
or how I'm feeling.

1053
01:02:28,050 --> 01:02:29,120
What am I supposed to do?

1054
01:02:30,550 --> 01:02:32,820
What more do you want from me?

1055
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:39,690
Shouldn't a monologue be delivered
with your inner voice?

1056
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,380
Hey, I'm glad you quit.

1057
01:02:57,380 --> 01:02:58,850
You did the right thing.

1058
01:02:59,010 --> 01:03:00,110
That brat.

1059
01:03:00,850 --> 01:03:03,150
How can you possibly work
for a jerk like that?

1060
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:04,250
No one will be able to perform.

1061
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:08,920
That obnoxious,
irritating little brat.

1062
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:10,630
Annoying, isn't he?

1063
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:13,390
You've got to be kidding me.

1064
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:16,000
I'm fuming mad.

1065
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:20,870
I actually feel better now.

1066
01:03:24,010 --> 01:03:25,470
Hey, Ji Hyuk.

1067
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:29,610
Just take a long trip somewhere.

1068
01:03:29,780 --> 01:03:31,880
Normally, you can't do that
when you have a job,

1069
01:03:31,950 --> 01:03:33,880
so people do it
while looking for new work.

1070
01:03:37,190 --> 01:03:38,220
A trip?

1071
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:40,590
I'd love to go on one.

1072
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:44,130
You wanted to go to South America
after hearing how much fun I had.

1073
01:03:44,690 --> 01:03:45,990
I don't have that luxury.

1074
01:03:47,530 --> 01:03:49,060
I'm going to start looking
for a new job right away.

1075
01:03:51,830 --> 01:03:54,300
Why? You should take some time off.

1076
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:57,870
My dad's job offer...

1077
01:03:59,270 --> 01:04:00,340
was canceled.

1078
01:04:03,310 --> 01:04:04,380
What?

1079
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:06,550
Seong Jae, life...

1080
01:04:08,050 --> 01:04:09,280
sure feels suffocating.

(Jung Bo A)

1098
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:33,600
Why did you want to see me?

1099
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:36,640
Was exercising
the first thing on your mind...

1100
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:37,710
after you quit your job?

1101
01:05:39,470 --> 01:05:40,940
This reminds me...

1102
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:43,680
of when we did joint volunteer work
at Edel Orphanage.

1103
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,220
Word spread within an hour...

1104
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:50,150
of you quitting your job.

1105
01:05:50,150 --> 01:05:51,150
Cut to the chase.

1106
01:05:51,650 --> 01:05:52,990
Is there an issue
with the materials?

1107
01:05:53,390 --> 01:05:55,360
The Haneul Construction project
is already done, isn't it?

1108
01:05:55,590 --> 01:05:56,760
It's not work
that I wanted to talk about.

1109
01:05:57,330 --> 01:05:58,430
Aren't you thirsty?

1110
01:05:58,530 --> 01:05:59,830
Tell me why you called me here.

1111
01:06:05,570 --> 01:06:06,670
Did you quit your job...

1112
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:09,870
with a backup plan in mind?

1113
01:06:12,110 --> 01:06:13,410
Is that what you wanted to ask?

1114
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:14,880
Give me an answer first.

1115
01:06:15,310 --> 01:06:18,010
Did you quit your job
with a backup plan in mind?

1116
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,610
It's not like you
to be this pointlessly curious.

1117
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:22,950
I'm not being curious
but trying to confirm something.

1118
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:26,190
You don't have a backup plan,
do you?

1119
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:29,590
I doubt it, since you quit
just a few days...

1120
01:06:29,590 --> 01:06:30,960
after Oh Jae Jin was promoted.

1121
01:06:31,060 --> 01:06:32,630
I'm not in the mood
for your rhetorical questions.

1122
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:36,000
I heard you walked out in style.

1123
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:39,770
Three female colleagues
have asked me...

1124
01:06:39,770 --> 01:06:40,870
to set them up with you.

1125
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,810
Did you insist on meeting today
just to talk about blind dates?

1126
01:06:48,210 --> 01:06:50,080
Why would I set you up
with other women...

1127
01:06:50,910 --> 01:06:52,250
when I want to propose to you?

1128
01:06:56,780 --> 01:06:58,150
You heard me correctly.

1129
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:01,920
What...

1130
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:04,560
What is this?

1131
01:07:06,130 --> 01:07:07,290
Ji Hyuk,

1132
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:10,360
marry me.

(Our Golden Days)

1134
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:08,460
What about the position you're in?

1135
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:10,190
No one asked you
to worry about living expenses.

1136
01:08:10,390 --> 01:08:12,460
I'm the father
and the breadwinner of this house.

1137
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:14,030
So that your pride isn't hurt,

1138
01:08:14,030 --> 01:08:15,230
do Grandma, Mom, I,

1139
01:08:15,230 --> 01:08:17,200
and even you have to act
like everything's fine?

1140
01:08:17,330 --> 01:08:18,400
She asked you to marry her?

1141
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:20,840
I couldn't care less
about her state of mind,

1142
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:22,400
but you need
to pull yourself together.

1143
01:08:22,670 --> 01:08:23,670
Aren't you...

1144
01:08:23,670 --> 01:08:25,240
It really is you
from the subway station.

1145
01:08:25,410 --> 01:08:28,180
Could we perhaps talk for a bit?

1146
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,080
The next guy you choose...

1147
01:08:30,180 --> 01:08:32,210
should be kind,
not simply someone you like.

1148
01:08:32,310 --> 01:08:33,450
Liking someone is about feelings,

1149
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:34,520
and feelings...

1150
01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:36,280
are powerless.
