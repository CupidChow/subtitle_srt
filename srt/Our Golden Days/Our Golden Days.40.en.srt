1
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:07,506
- What brings you here? - Don't we have the same mother?

2
00:00:09,046 --> 00:00:10,516
Ko Seong Hui.

3
00:00:12,786 --> 00:00:14,986
I heard you and Woo Jin are twins.

4
00:00:16,756 --> 00:00:19,226
So I guess that makes you my sister, too, right?

5
00:00:21,696 --> 00:00:24,596
I overheard you at the hospital the other day.

6
00:00:30,696 --> 00:00:34,036
So why are you here?

7
00:00:35,336 --> 00:00:37,676
I came here because I wanted to meet you.

8
00:00:37,936 --> 00:00:38,946
No.

9
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:42,916
- What? - You're that woman's daughter.

10
00:00:43,646 --> 00:00:44,846
And while you may be Woo Jin's...

11
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:49,516
half-sister, you're no sister of mine.

12
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:52,986
I have my own family.

13
00:00:54,256 --> 00:00:55,456
After everything...

14
00:00:56,026 --> 00:00:58,226
your mother put me through,

15
00:00:58,996 --> 00:01:01,966
I don't want anything to do with anyone connected to her.

16
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:04,936
We're not supposed to be meeting like this.

17
00:01:06,706 --> 00:01:08,936
You keep saying "your mother,"

18
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:12,976
- but she's your mother too. - Did you not hear me?

19
00:01:16,946 --> 00:01:17,946
You.

20
00:01:19,286 --> 00:01:21,146
Did your mother put you up to this?

21
00:01:22,116 --> 00:01:24,256
No, absolutely not.

22
00:01:26,456 --> 00:01:27,556
Then leave.

23
00:01:28,356 --> 00:01:29,496
And don't come back.

24
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:35,896
I didn't come here thinking...

25
00:01:36,766 --> 00:01:38,506
I'd finally have a sister to vent to.

26
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:41,066
It's just...

27
00:01:42,806 --> 00:01:45,076
I wanted to thank you for giving Woo Jin your liver.

28
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:48,006
And since you were born to a mother like ours,

29
00:01:48,546 --> 00:01:49,716
I know you've been through so much.

30
00:01:51,346 --> 00:01:54,886
I came because I wanted to apologize in her place.

31
00:01:56,756 --> 00:01:57,786
Why...

32
00:01:58,456 --> 00:02:00,486
are you the one apologizing?

33
00:02:01,696 --> 00:02:03,126
Is she really Ko Seong Hui's daughter?

34
00:02:04,126 --> 00:02:06,926
Or did Ko Seong Hui put her up to this?

35
00:02:08,896 --> 00:02:10,936
Because we both had to live with the same mother.

36
00:02:14,366 --> 00:02:16,936
Our mom never apologized to you, did she?

37
00:02:19,446 --> 00:02:20,706
I'm sure she didn't.

38
00:02:21,746 --> 00:02:25,646
I've never once heard her say she's sorry in my entire life.

39
00:02:27,686 --> 00:02:28,786
That's why...

40
00:02:29,556 --> 00:02:33,286
I really wanted to be the one to say it to you.

41
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,766
Just because I found out about you,

42
00:02:39,366 --> 00:02:42,366
I'm not going to tell our mom or my dad.

43
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:44,096
This is...

44
00:02:45,106 --> 00:02:46,506
It's too big of a deal.

45
00:02:47,636 --> 00:02:49,506
My dad wouldn't be able to handle it.

46
00:02:51,106 --> 00:02:52,106
Do whatever you want.

47
00:02:53,376 --> 00:02:54,806
I don't care either way.

48
00:02:56,716 --> 00:02:59,186
If you're done, you can leave now.

49
00:03:04,856 --> 00:03:06,126
Goodbye.

50
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,606
If I could treat you like a sister for a second...

51
00:03:20,036 --> 00:03:21,506
and ask you something, would that be okay?

52
00:03:23,706 --> 00:03:25,646
I want to be a webtoon artist.

53
00:03:26,106 --> 00:03:28,006
And I just came up with a new idea I want to write about.

54
00:03:28,716 --> 00:03:29,716
But...

55
00:03:31,716 --> 00:03:33,386
if it means going against my mom and dad,

56
00:03:34,746 --> 00:03:36,416
do you think I can do it?

57
00:03:37,816 --> 00:03:39,786
That is unbelievably pathetic.

58
00:03:41,126 --> 00:03:42,196
Just go.

59
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:53,636
Of course, you should write it. Why wouldn't you?

60
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:58,606
If that's what you want to do, why wouldn't you do it?

61
00:04:01,676 --> 00:04:05,346
A good parent wouldn't stop you from doing that.

62
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:10,516
If parents truly love their child, they'll let them do what they want.

63
00:04:10,986 --> 00:04:12,826
It's the parent's job to lose that battle.

64
00:04:15,096 --> 00:04:17,596
How did you and Woo Jin grow up to be so clueless?

65
00:04:22,636 --> 00:04:24,896
You're both so good-looking on the outside, too.

66
00:04:26,136 --> 00:04:28,066
If you're going to ask such a pathetic question,

67
00:04:28,436 --> 00:04:29,636
don't ever come back.

68
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:32,246
So if I'm not being dumb, I can come back?

69
00:04:37,046 --> 00:04:38,046
No...

70
00:04:42,216 --> 00:04:43,216
Just don't.

71
00:04:47,156 --> 00:04:48,156
Okay.

72
00:05:04,006 --> 00:05:05,746
I don't think you have to worry about her.

73
00:05:07,806 --> 00:05:08,816
Thankfully,

74
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:10,876
she's nothing like her mother.

75
00:05:14,716 --> 00:05:16,156
Okay, Woo Jin.

76
00:05:17,286 --> 00:05:18,486
I'll call you later.

77
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:19,986
Okay.

78
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,336
Her whole life,

79
00:05:30,066 --> 00:05:32,636
she's never heard her mother say sorry?

80
00:05:36,476 --> 00:05:37,536
Park Yeong Ra.

81
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:42,016
You poor thing.

82
00:05:45,116 --> 00:05:49,616
Gosh, what's taking her so long? I shouldn't have let her go alone.

83
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:53,256
Come on, Lee Ji Wan. Why are you ignoring your main duty?

84
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:56,096
This won't do. I have to call her.

85
00:05:57,496 --> 00:05:58,496
Ji Wan.

86
00:06:00,696 --> 00:06:01,866
I've made up my mind.

87
00:06:02,336 --> 00:06:03,336
About what?

88
00:06:03,736 --> 00:06:06,406
I'll reclaim the name, Freedom, and sign the contract myself.

89
00:06:08,236 --> 00:06:11,206
Did you go ask your father for permission?

90
00:06:12,476 --> 00:06:13,476
Not exactly.

91
00:06:14,246 --> 00:06:16,876
Someone helped me resolve my last remaining doubt.

92
00:06:17,676 --> 00:06:19,686
And who was that?

93
00:06:20,946 --> 00:06:21,956
Just someone.

94
00:06:22,886 --> 00:06:26,186
I don't have to tell you every single thing, do I?

95
00:06:28,226 --> 00:06:30,296
You're right.

96
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:32,966
We're nothing to each other anyway.

97
00:06:38,296 --> 00:06:40,506
Since we'll be total strangers once I quit,

98
00:06:41,306 --> 00:06:42,576
she's already putting up a wall.

99
00:06:44,236 --> 00:06:46,146
Ji Wan, I'm going to get to work.

100
00:06:54,346 --> 00:06:57,716
That webtoon you recommended. It's amazing.

101
00:06:57,716 --> 00:06:59,686
You have a real talent for making webtoons.

102
00:06:59,826 --> 00:07:01,356
There comes a time when you have to decide.

103
00:07:01,686 --> 00:07:02,696
And...

104
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:05,366
that's a decision only you can make.

105
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,896
If that's what you want to do, why wouldn't you do it?

106
00:07:09,236 --> 00:07:13,006
A good parent wouldn't stop you from doing that.

107
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:17,136
If parents truly love their child, they'll let them do what they want.

108
00:07:17,506 --> 00:07:19,306
It's the parent's job to lose that battle.

109
00:07:20,476 --> 00:07:23,476
If your parents truly love you, they'll let you have your way.

110
00:07:34,426 --> 00:07:37,696
You can date him casually, but it can't go any further.

111
00:07:37,926 --> 00:07:40,226
I called you here to make that perfectly clear.

112
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,596
The heir to a corporate group...

113
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:45,166
marries into a family that can be an asset to the company.

114
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:48,006
Why can't I stop crying?

115
00:07:50,306 --> 00:07:51,536
(Seong Jae)

116
00:07:56,046 --> 00:07:57,146
Hey, Seong Jae!

117
00:07:57,876 --> 00:07:58,886
Su Bin.

118
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:01,116
What's wrong with your voice? Did you catch a cold?

119
00:08:01,746 --> 00:08:04,856
Oh, I think I caught a sore throat at the shoot yesterday.

120
00:08:05,656 --> 00:08:07,286
Seong Jae, how did your meeting go yesterday?

121
00:08:07,786 --> 00:08:09,856
You had an outdoor shoot? Where?

122
00:08:11,156 --> 00:08:12,626
Yes. In Jongno.

123
00:08:13,966 --> 00:08:15,896
You should've worn a warmer jacket.

124
00:08:16,366 --> 00:08:17,936
You went out without bundling up again, didn't you?

125
00:08:18,036 --> 00:08:21,566
No, I didn't. I wore my thick, cream-colored coat.

126
00:08:22,406 --> 00:08:24,806
Really? What about medicine? Did you take any?

127
00:08:25,276 --> 00:08:26,546
I'll pick some up and bring it over.

128
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:29,716
Seong Jae, my mom's calling for me. I'll talk to you tomorrow.

129
00:08:34,886 --> 00:08:36,356
Just because her mom calls,

130
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,316
she hangs up on me?

131
00:08:41,686 --> 00:08:43,496
Her voice also sounded like she'd been crying.

132
00:08:45,296 --> 00:08:46,766
Something's off with Su Bin.

133
00:08:47,926 --> 00:08:49,196
(Lee Su Bin)

134
00:08:51,366 --> 00:08:52,406
What?

135
00:08:53,736 --> 00:08:54,936
(Seong Jae, I'm busy. I'll call you tomorrow.)

136
00:08:55,006 --> 00:08:58,236
Seong Jae, I'm busy. I'll call you tomorrow.

137
00:09:02,516 --> 00:09:05,046
I wore my thick, cream-colored coat.

138
00:09:11,316 --> 00:09:12,686
Around 2pm yesterday,

139
00:09:13,026 --> 00:09:15,726
was someone named Lee Su Bin on the visitor log?

140
00:09:19,296 --> 00:09:22,436
Yes, sir. She was here yesterday at 2pm.

141
00:09:26,206 --> 00:09:27,566
Was she here to see the Chairman?

142
00:09:34,646 --> 00:09:35,916
I'm at the park in front of your place.

143
00:09:36,316 --> 00:09:37,316
Come outside.

144
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:39,946
What?

145
00:09:44,786 --> 00:09:47,426
Seong Jae, shouldn't you be at work? Why are you here all of a sudden?

146
00:09:51,096 --> 00:09:52,626
Why are your eyes so puffy?

147
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:56,866
- Have you been crying? - No. Maybe it's from lying down.

148
00:09:58,266 --> 00:10:00,136
Did you cry after meeting my father yesterday?

149
00:10:02,236 --> 00:10:03,236
Well...

150
00:10:09,146 --> 00:10:10,716
The Chairman must have told you.

151
00:10:11,946 --> 00:10:13,316
Isn't that Su Bin?

152
00:10:14,746 --> 00:10:17,386
And what's Seong Jae doing here at this hour?

153
00:10:18,616 --> 00:10:21,956
Why see my dad without telling me? What were you thinking?

154
00:10:24,996 --> 00:10:26,826
Did my father tell you not to say anything to me?

155
00:10:27,066 --> 00:10:30,766
- No, he didn't say that. - Then why didn't you tell me?

156
00:10:31,266 --> 00:10:33,336
You have no idea how ruthless my father is.

157
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,836
Why would you put yourself through that kind of humiliation?

158
00:10:39,176 --> 00:10:40,176
What did he say to you?

159
00:10:42,546 --> 00:10:43,646
That's...

160
00:10:43,646 --> 00:10:44,716
Did he tell you to break up with me?

161
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:47,046
- That's not it. - Then what?

162
00:10:52,556 --> 00:10:53,586
Did he say we could only date?

163
00:10:57,296 --> 00:10:58,426
Su Bin.

164
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:01,166
You should have told me.

165
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:07,466
He called me secretly for a reason. That's why I went.

166
00:11:07,606 --> 00:11:09,776
Why would you make that call on your own?

167
00:11:10,476 --> 00:11:13,006
I could have handled everything. I was ready to.

168
00:11:14,046 --> 00:11:16,016
He must've said awful things to you. Really awful things.

169
00:11:17,846 --> 00:11:18,846
I'm sorry.

170
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:20,846
For not telling you.

171
00:11:26,726 --> 00:11:27,726
No.

172
00:11:29,296 --> 00:11:30,296
I'm the one who's sorry.

173
00:11:31,056 --> 00:11:34,266
I won't let you be humiliated like that again.

174
00:11:37,636 --> 00:11:39,936
I'm sorry, Su Bin. I'm so sorry.

175
00:11:43,176 --> 00:11:44,576
What is all this?

176
00:11:48,976 --> 00:11:51,246
- Dad. - What are you two doing?

177
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:53,886
What was all that I just heard?

178
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,656
Who was Su Bin called to see?

179
00:11:58,016 --> 00:11:59,056
That's...

180
00:12:00,556 --> 00:12:01,656
Dad, about that...

181
00:12:08,566 --> 00:12:09,596
Hey, Seong Jae.

182
00:12:10,466 --> 00:12:11,866
How could you do this?

183
00:12:12,506 --> 00:12:14,836
How dare you go after our Su Bin, you punk?

184
00:12:15,876 --> 00:12:17,036
What's going on?

185
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:21,676
I'm sorry, Father. Mother.

186
00:12:23,616 --> 00:12:25,316
Honey, what's wrong with them?

187
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:29,516
You see, they've been dating.

188
00:12:29,856 --> 00:12:33,056
They were secretly dating, the nerve of them!

189
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:34,186
What?

190
00:12:37,426 --> 00:12:41,196
Hey, you brats. Kneeling won't do you any good.

191
00:12:41,196 --> 00:12:42,996
You two are over. As of right now.

192
00:12:43,536 --> 00:12:45,636
- Father. - Dad.

193
00:12:45,636 --> 00:12:49,676
Hey! Park Seong Jae! Lee Su Bin! What were you two thinking?

194
00:12:51,076 --> 00:12:54,606
- I'm sorry. - "Sorry" isn't enough. It's no use.

195
00:12:54,706 --> 00:12:57,216
There's getting stabbed in the back, and then there's this.

196
00:12:58,476 --> 00:12:59,486
Park Seong Jae.

197
00:13:00,316 --> 00:13:03,716
Not you. You, of all people, shouldn't have done this.

198
00:13:04,256 --> 00:13:06,826
The one person who knew better stabs us in the back?

199
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:11,456
- Get out now. Out, right now! - Dad, please just listen to us.

200
00:13:11,526 --> 00:13:12,596
Su Bin, keep your mouth shut.

201
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,296
Get up, Seong Jae. Come on.

202
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:16,836
Goodness.

203
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:19,506
Ji Hyuk, you knew about this?

204
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,806
My gosh, honey. It looks like Ji Hyuk knew.

205
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:25,906
- Oh, I feel dizzy. - Honey.

206
00:13:25,976 --> 00:13:27,706
- Mom! - Gosh, get away from me.

207
00:13:27,846 --> 00:13:29,476
Hurry, go inside. Go to your room. Go on.

208
00:13:29,546 --> 00:13:31,076
Come on, let's go, Seong Jae!

209
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:39,986
Hey, what's up with Seong Jae and Ji Hyuk?

210
00:13:40,256 --> 00:13:41,256
Did they have a fight?

211
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:46,926
Hey!

212
00:13:47,466 --> 00:13:49,636
See? Why did you let it get to this point?

213
00:13:50,736 --> 00:13:51,736
I know.

214
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:59,976
- Let's go. Where did you park? - I'll go alone.

215
00:14:00,376 --> 00:14:01,376
Seong Jae.

216
00:14:03,446 --> 00:14:05,616
- I'll walk you to your car. - Ji Hyuk.

217
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:08,786
I want to be alone.

218
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:24,896
Honey, get up. Take this calming herbal pill.

219
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,206
- Get up. Come on. - My gosh.

220
00:14:29,706 --> 00:14:30,706
Mom.

221
00:14:32,606 --> 00:14:33,606
Yes.

222
00:14:39,286 --> 00:14:41,046
Mom, are you okay?

223
00:14:42,616 --> 00:14:43,856
Are you out of your mind?

224
00:14:44,586 --> 00:14:47,026
How could you be dating Seong Jae of all people?

225
00:14:47,426 --> 00:14:49,896
What does it matter who he is? I like him.

226
00:14:51,326 --> 00:14:54,826
He's divorced. And there's a nine-year age gap!

227
00:14:54,966 --> 00:14:57,996
Mom, it's not like we're getting married.

228
00:14:58,066 --> 00:15:01,906
- Su Bin, go to your room. Now. - Let's go, Su Bin.

229
00:15:02,976 --> 00:15:04,006
Come on.

230
00:15:04,106 --> 00:15:06,376
I'm so shocked I'm speechless.

231
00:15:06,446 --> 00:15:08,506
How are you two even a thing?

232
00:15:09,046 --> 00:15:12,946
No way! I know his family. Don't even think about it!

233
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:16,016
His family would never approve of you!

234
00:15:16,256 --> 00:15:18,186
Gosh, I can't believe Seong Jae! This is too much.

235
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:20,286
Don't you talk badly about Seong Jae.

236
00:15:20,556 --> 00:15:21,626
How long have you two been together?

237
00:15:22,186 --> 00:15:24,196
Don't tell me you started seeing him when his family hired me.

238
00:15:24,896 --> 00:15:26,866
No, it hasn't been that long.

239
00:15:27,926 --> 00:15:29,066
That's a relief then.

240
00:15:29,466 --> 00:15:31,436
It's a good thing you got caught before you got in too deep.

241
00:15:31,736 --> 00:15:33,066
Perfect time to break things off.

242
00:15:33,536 --> 00:15:34,606
Ji Wan, get out.

243
00:15:35,006 --> 00:15:36,006
Hey, Lee Su Bin.

244
00:15:38,436 --> 00:15:39,446
Su Bin.

245
00:15:39,746 --> 00:15:40,806
Ji Hyuk, you should leave too.

246
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,676
This is why I tried to stop you.

247
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:47,116
It's over between you two.

248
00:15:47,986 --> 00:15:49,186
So get over him.

249
00:15:51,656 --> 00:15:54,026
And you? Can you just turn your feelings off?

250
00:15:55,656 --> 00:15:56,756
What's that supposed to mean?

251
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:58,256
I don't know.

252
00:15:58,796 --> 00:16:00,526
I don't know how I'll feel.

253
00:16:01,066 --> 00:16:04,166
So don't talk like breaking up is a given.

254
00:16:04,936 --> 00:16:07,966
- And what if you don't break up? - Ji Hyuk, please.

255
00:16:08,336 --> 00:16:12,036
Please! Just leave me alone, please!

256
00:16:28,556 --> 00:16:29,556
I'm home.

257
00:16:40,706 --> 00:16:43,076
From the look on his face, they broke up.

258
00:16:44,776 --> 00:16:46,876
But I guess she really hasn't told him she met me.

259
00:16:50,016 --> 00:16:53,616
She takes a hint well, and she's tight-lipped.

260
00:16:56,956 --> 00:16:58,886
He was dating a decent kid, I suppose.

261
00:17:25,846 --> 00:17:27,486
Of all people, why Seong Jae?

262
00:17:28,246 --> 00:17:30,516
Enough. You're going to talk my ear off.

263
00:17:59,046 --> 00:18:00,386
Wait, what's that supposed to mean?

264
00:18:00,686 --> 00:18:03,186
Are you saying you won't give up, or that you can't?

265
00:18:04,786 --> 00:18:06,426
- Both. - Come on, Seong Jae.

266
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:07,486
Ji Hyuk.

267
00:18:09,996 --> 00:18:11,126
Isn't there some way?

268
00:18:11,326 --> 00:18:14,896
A few days ago, you yourself said you'd only see her for 100 days.

269
00:18:16,066 --> 00:18:17,066
I didn't know.

270
00:18:18,296 --> 00:18:20,236
I didn't know then, even when I told you.

271
00:18:21,036 --> 00:18:23,336
I didn't know even until the moment your dad caught us.

272
00:18:25,176 --> 00:18:26,946
But when I woke up this morning, I realized something.

273
00:18:29,946 --> 00:18:31,146
I can't live without Su Bin.

274
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:35,716
- What's with you? What will you do? - I'm...

275
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:37,786
going to leave my father's company.

276
00:18:38,786 --> 00:18:40,956
- What? - I'm striking out on my own.

277
00:18:41,926 --> 00:18:43,496
I can make a living as the CEO of Next Labs.

278
00:18:44,796 --> 00:18:45,796
Seong Jae.

279
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:47,966
Don't be emotional about this.

280
00:18:49,096 --> 00:18:50,236
It means I'm going to try.

281
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:52,166
You never know.

282
00:18:52,736 --> 00:18:55,436
Maybe if they see how I feel, your parents...

283
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:58,436
- might give us their blessing. - No.

284
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:01,406
That just means you're going to keep tormenting my parents.

285
00:19:03,316 --> 00:19:04,346
Then what about you?

286
00:19:05,316 --> 00:19:08,086
If Eun Oh's mother were against it, would you give up? Could you?

287
00:19:08,086 --> 00:19:12,216
Seong Jae, my situation's different. You don't know what she means to me.

288
00:19:12,286 --> 00:19:13,486
Can you prove that?

289
00:19:15,056 --> 00:19:16,056
A person's heart...

290
00:19:16,796 --> 00:19:18,826
is something no one can see. It can only be felt.

291
00:19:19,766 --> 00:19:21,426
And I'm telling you this is how I feel.

292
00:19:22,296 --> 00:19:25,296
You have no right to say if my feelings are deep or not.

293
00:19:29,236 --> 00:19:30,536
Seong Jae.

294
00:19:30,976 --> 00:19:33,276
I'm not just becoming independent because of Su Bin.

295
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:35,446
This whole situation...

296
00:19:36,016 --> 00:19:38,146
has made me reevaluate my life.

297
00:19:41,286 --> 00:19:42,286
Are you serious?

298
00:19:50,396 --> 00:19:51,696
(Shoealls)

299
00:19:52,556 --> 00:19:54,596
I'm here to see Chairman Park Jin Seok.

300
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:56,466
Do you have an appointment?

301
00:19:56,766 --> 00:19:58,666
Just tell him Lee Su Bin's father is here.

302
00:19:59,236 --> 00:20:00,866
(Shoealls)

303
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,436
What? The Vice President isn't in yet?

304
00:20:06,106 --> 00:20:07,546
That punk.

305
00:20:08,146 --> 00:20:10,316
Is he really making a fuss because I called over that girl?

306
00:20:10,846 --> 00:20:12,346
Unbelievable.

307
00:20:18,816 --> 00:20:22,556
Sir, there's a man at reception who says he's Lee Su Bin's father.

308
00:20:23,296 --> 00:20:25,056
He said you'd know who he is.

309
00:20:25,996 --> 00:20:27,426
Lee Su Bin's father?

310
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:31,166
Send him up.

311
00:20:33,636 --> 00:20:35,236
The nerve of this guy.

312
00:20:36,036 --> 00:20:37,306
How dare he come here?

313
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:45,646
You've clearly never worked in an office.

314
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:49,216
I'm not the kind of person you can just meet without an appointment.

315
00:20:49,656 --> 00:20:54,156
Appointment or not, the least you can do for a guest is stand up.

316
00:20:54,856 --> 00:20:58,296
You summoned my daughter as Seong Jae's father.

317
00:20:58,456 --> 00:21:00,866
Likewise, I've come to see Seong Jae's father.

318
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:02,626
Not the Chairman of Shoe Joy.

319
00:21:06,636 --> 00:21:09,476
(Shoealls)

320
00:21:12,636 --> 00:21:15,606
- Have a seat. - I'm not here to sit.

321
00:21:17,716 --> 00:21:20,146
I imagine you told my daughter the same old story.

322
00:21:21,116 --> 00:21:23,486
So, let me be the first to say it. We reject Seong Jae.

323
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:28,086
Don't get me wrong. I love Seong Jae like a son, but...

324
00:21:28,726 --> 00:21:31,226
he's nowhere near good enough for my daughter.

325
00:21:31,726 --> 00:21:36,336
I'll never give Su Bin away to a man from a dark and troubled home.

326
00:21:37,466 --> 00:21:40,766
Do you even hear the nonsense you're spewing?

327
00:21:40,836 --> 00:21:43,736
He's divorced, and he's nine years older than her.

328
00:21:43,806 --> 00:21:46,606
And Seong Jae is completely under his father's thumb, isn't he?

329
00:21:46,976 --> 00:21:49,176
- Just look at his first marriage. - Watch it!

330
00:21:49,676 --> 00:21:53,086
Even if he's the king of tycoons, the answer is no!

331
00:21:53,216 --> 00:21:56,956
- Did you just disrespect me? - You started it!

332
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:01,186
If you understand me, you and your son better back off.

333
00:22:02,656 --> 00:22:04,256
What's so wrong with being divorced once?

334
00:22:04,826 --> 00:22:07,166
He's handsome, tall, and has a great character.

335
00:22:07,566 --> 00:22:09,996
And I'm going to make him president once he's married.

336
00:22:10,536 --> 00:22:13,066
So where do you get off saying that he's not good enough?

337
00:22:13,136 --> 00:22:14,766
I won't accept him!

338
00:22:15,266 --> 00:22:17,436
My family will never accept a man like that.

339
00:22:18,106 --> 00:22:21,606
So don't you ever think about summoning my daughter again.

340
00:22:21,706 --> 00:22:22,816
If you do it one more time...

341
00:22:25,746 --> 00:22:28,486
I've said my piece. I'm leaving.

342
00:22:32,516 --> 00:22:33,526
Why, that...

343
00:22:37,196 --> 00:22:39,766
He did that on purpose, making me stand here while he rambled.

344
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:51,576
That Park Jin Seok... I'm glad I saw that jerk for myself.

345
00:22:52,276 --> 00:22:55,446
What a hack, using intimidation with his position and bluster.

346
00:22:56,716 --> 00:22:58,546
Seong Jae is nothing like his father.

347
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:04,486
For spring and summer festivals, instead of T-shirts or button-downs,

348
00:23:04,556 --> 00:23:06,956
try pairing a soft knit top with jeans.

349
00:23:07,026 --> 00:23:09,556
You can give off a really soft and cozy vibe.

350
00:23:10,726 --> 00:23:12,056
Back then,

351
00:23:13,126 --> 00:23:14,496
I couldn't have even dreamed of this.

352
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,896
Don't we look pretty good together?

353
00:23:19,506 --> 00:23:20,536
Go out with me.

354
00:23:22,936 --> 00:23:27,246
I saw you as Ji Hyuk's snot-nosed, but kind of clever, little sister.

355
00:23:30,346 --> 00:23:31,746
Dreaming of a future together?

356
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:33,516
I just can't help but picture it.

357
00:23:34,616 --> 00:23:37,786
I can't imagine my life without Eun Oh in it anymore.

358
00:23:40,326 --> 00:23:42,026
To be honest, me too.

359
00:23:42,586 --> 00:23:43,596
Ji Hyuk.

360
00:23:53,506 --> 00:23:56,706
But I feel that instead of running around job sites,

361
00:23:56,806 --> 00:23:59,646
your real talent lies in design.

362
00:24:04,946 --> 00:24:05,946
Yes.

363
00:24:12,286 --> 00:24:13,326
What is it?

364
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:17,726
AP's head of design... I'm going to go for it.

365
00:24:18,296 --> 00:24:19,356
So you've decided?

366
00:24:20,266 --> 00:24:24,466
- I can quit if it doesn't work out. - Right, that's true.

367
00:24:25,396 --> 00:24:26,566
Still...

368
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:31,076
First, let's get your application paperwork filled out.

369
00:24:31,706 --> 00:24:34,006
There's still a process, even for a direct hire.

370
00:24:34,376 --> 00:24:37,316
You were pretty sure I'd say yes, weren't you?

371
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:41,746
Why waste time on negative thoughts when you can just be hopeful?

372
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:45,786
I guess I am quite the talent.

373
00:24:49,956 --> 00:24:53,826
Your salary is listed there. I decided on it with the HR team.

374
00:24:54,096 --> 00:24:57,136
We considered your time at Doogle and that this is a scout offer.

375
00:24:57,236 --> 00:24:59,136
It's the highest salary in the industry.

376
00:25:01,806 --> 00:25:05,806
I see the salary as recognition for my past work.

377
00:25:06,036 --> 00:25:07,306
I gratefully accept.

378
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:09,106
All right then!

379
00:25:09,846 --> 00:25:10,846
Sign here.

380
00:25:16,086 --> 00:25:17,986
(Ji Eun Oh)

381
00:25:23,826 --> 00:25:25,926
As AP's new head of design,

382
00:25:26,726 --> 00:25:27,726
welcome aboard.

383
00:25:30,866 --> 00:25:32,136
I'll do my best.

384
00:25:40,406 --> 00:25:41,806
Here, you need to eat.

385
00:25:46,416 --> 00:25:49,516
Mom, you said you have a headache. Why are you just having porridge?

386
00:25:49,816 --> 00:25:51,286
You need to eat a proper meal.

387
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:54,086
Your mom has a headache from indigestion.

388
00:25:57,356 --> 00:25:59,996
Stop hovering. You make me anxious. Sit down and say what you want.

389
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:01,796
What?

390
00:26:02,426 --> 00:26:05,336
You're beating around the bush because you have something to say.

391
00:26:06,636 --> 00:26:07,806
Mom, Dad.

392
00:26:08,406 --> 00:26:10,076
Please, just hear me out.

393
00:26:10,136 --> 00:26:13,076
If you're going to talk nonsense, just go upstairs, okay?

394
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:16,976
Seong Jae and I aren't saying we're going to get married.

395
00:26:17,046 --> 00:26:18,916
So why are you so angry and against us?

396
00:26:18,976 --> 00:26:22,086
Why date Seong Jae if you can't even marry him?

397
00:26:22,616 --> 00:26:25,186
Who even dates with marriage in mind these days?

398
00:26:25,316 --> 00:26:27,656
People just date and break up. That's how it is.

399
00:26:28,126 --> 00:26:30,456
Do you know why people get married?

400
00:26:30,896 --> 00:26:34,466
They date, grow attached, and marry if they can't be apart.

401
00:26:35,366 --> 00:26:38,166
If you keep liking him, marriage will be on your mind.

402
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:40,606
But that can't happen with Seong Jae.

403
00:26:42,736 --> 00:26:44,936
So can't we just not get married?

404
00:26:45,106 --> 00:26:49,106
See? You're making this so difficult because you don't want to break up.

405
00:26:50,046 --> 00:26:52,016
I can't stand looking at you. Go to your room!

406
00:26:53,786 --> 00:26:55,316
Su Bin, go to your room.

407
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:05,556
Seong Jae, you're here.

408
00:27:10,836 --> 00:27:11,866
Have a seat.

409
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,836
I'm afraid we can't have dinner together.

410
00:27:22,546 --> 00:27:23,576
Father, Mother.

411
00:27:27,446 --> 00:27:28,816
Please, I'm begging you.

412
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:32,616
You've got some nerve. What do you think you're doing?

413
00:27:33,286 --> 00:27:35,656
I met your father today. It's all settled.

414
00:27:37,126 --> 00:27:39,966
So don't waste any more energy on this.

415
00:27:40,026 --> 00:27:41,026
Just let it go.

416
00:27:41,566 --> 00:27:43,266
I can't do that, Father.

417
00:27:44,336 --> 00:27:45,666
I am so sorry.

418
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:48,436
I'm really sorry.

419
00:27:53,206 --> 00:27:54,246
I...

420
00:27:55,706 --> 00:27:57,216
I can't give up on her.

421
00:28:02,716 --> 00:28:03,716
I...

422
00:28:05,086 --> 00:28:06,316
Su Bin...

423
00:28:07,356 --> 00:28:08,986
I will only love Su Bin,

424
00:28:09,556 --> 00:28:10,926
and I'll spend my life cherishing her.

425
00:28:11,526 --> 00:28:14,426
I know you're against this because I'm not good enough for her.

426
00:28:14,496 --> 00:28:17,366
I know that all too well. But Father, Mother...

427
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:22,736
It's killing me.

428
00:28:25,736 --> 00:28:27,246
Please, I'm begging you.

429
00:28:31,546 --> 00:28:32,846
Park Seong Jae.

430
00:28:33,516 --> 00:28:36,756
- What are you doing, punk? - Honey, wait a minute.

431
00:28:37,486 --> 00:28:39,086
I have something to say to Seong Jae.

432
00:28:43,826 --> 00:28:44,826
Seong Jae.

433
00:28:46,056 --> 00:28:47,326
I just...

434
00:28:49,566 --> 00:28:51,536
You know how bright and cheerful our Su Bin is.

435
00:28:53,306 --> 00:28:55,136
She's cheerful and resilient,

436
00:28:56,106 --> 00:28:57,936
and yet she's so sensitive.

437
00:28:58,736 --> 00:29:00,676
And so thoughtful. That's my girl.

438
00:29:03,546 --> 00:29:04,876
I know, Mother.

439
00:29:05,876 --> 00:29:07,586
She's way too good for me...

440
00:29:09,246 --> 00:29:11,116
That's why I want Su Bin...

441
00:29:12,316 --> 00:29:14,186
to live life freely and spread her wings.

442
00:29:15,656 --> 00:29:17,696
I want that for her even after she's married.

443
00:29:20,396 --> 00:29:22,996
When Su Bin spreads her arms out wide,

444
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:27,406
I want her to be with someone who won't hold her back.

445
00:29:29,266 --> 00:29:30,376
I want her to fall in love with,

446
00:29:31,176 --> 00:29:33,276
date, and even marry someone like that.

447
00:29:37,416 --> 00:29:38,416
Seong Jae.

448
00:29:40,316 --> 00:29:42,246
Can you please do this one thing for me?

449
00:29:43,556 --> 00:29:45,956
Can't you let my Su Bin live a life like that?

450
00:29:49,726 --> 00:29:51,356
Please, do it for my sake, Seong Jae.

451
00:29:52,896 --> 00:29:54,626
You have to be the one to save me.

452
00:29:57,166 --> 00:29:58,496
Your family...

453
00:29:59,336 --> 00:30:01,306
If they don't approve of a daughter-in-law,

454
00:30:02,406 --> 00:30:05,006
they'll force a divorce, even after the wedding.

455
00:30:07,276 --> 00:30:11,016
Knowing that, how can I let my daughter marry you?

456
00:30:14,716 --> 00:30:17,486
Mother, I can be independent from my family.

457
00:30:18,056 --> 00:30:19,356
I will. I'll move out on my own.

458
00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:26,196
I know how kind,

459
00:30:26,896 --> 00:30:28,496
thoughtful, and warmhearted you are.

460
00:30:29,496 --> 00:30:32,236
I know. I know it all too well.

461
00:30:33,766 --> 00:30:35,866
But you're still the eldest son of that family.

462
00:30:37,306 --> 00:30:39,206
Moving out won't solve everything.

463
00:30:42,906 --> 00:30:44,976
I've heard and seen things, you know.

464
00:30:46,346 --> 00:30:49,616
You want Su Bin to be happy too, don't you?

465
00:30:52,556 --> 00:30:55,826
I'm so sorry, Seong Jae. I really am.

466
00:30:56,926 --> 00:30:58,426
For having to say this to you.

467
00:32:12,336 --> 00:32:16,406
What? Her father came by and said he's against Seong Jae?

468
00:32:16,706 --> 00:32:17,706
Why?

469
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:21,246
He brought up the divorce and said he doesn't want him.

470
00:32:21,576 --> 00:32:22,676
The nerve.

471
00:32:23,306 --> 00:32:26,676
He was just trying to save face since he knew it was a lost cause.

472
00:32:27,986 --> 00:32:29,446
For him to come all the way to see you...

473
00:32:29,816 --> 00:32:32,116
Gosh, that's so crude and intimidating.

474
00:32:33,526 --> 00:32:35,086
The girl seemed decent enough.

475
00:32:35,626 --> 00:32:38,926
I feared Seong Jae would get serious and ask to marry her.

476
00:32:39,896 --> 00:32:42,066
But her father came and neatly solved the problem.

477
00:32:43,666 --> 00:32:46,766
Goodness. That must have been so unpleasant for you.

478
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,706
It takes all kinds.

479
00:33:01,416 --> 00:33:02,416
You...

480
00:33:03,386 --> 00:33:05,016
Don't you have anything to say to me?

481
00:33:06,986 --> 00:33:07,986
No, I don't.

482
00:33:08,426 --> 00:33:09,426
What do you mean you don't?

483
00:33:10,256 --> 00:33:12,096
You must have heard something from your girlfriend, right?

484
00:33:13,696 --> 00:33:15,266
Her family won't approve of me,

485
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:18,496
so we broke up.

486
00:33:25,276 --> 00:33:26,846
So they really did object?

487
00:33:29,476 --> 00:33:30,646
That's ridiculous.

488
00:33:35,416 --> 00:33:36,416
Good.

489
00:33:36,956 --> 00:33:37,956
They broke up.

490
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:40,056
It's really and truly over.

491
00:33:41,856 --> 00:33:43,496
Woo Jin's situation is resolved.

492
00:33:45,026 --> 00:33:46,256
Now, all that's left is Yeong Ra.

493
00:34:06,746 --> 00:34:07,846
Hey, Seong Jae.

494
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:09,886
You'll be home, right?

495
00:34:10,386 --> 00:34:11,986
I'll come pick you up by 6:30pm.

496
00:34:13,016 --> 00:34:17,026
Don't. Meet me at 11:50pm at the park in my neighborhood.

497
00:34:18,126 --> 00:34:19,356
Did you say 11:50pm?

498
00:34:20,666 --> 00:34:22,666
But I already made a reservation at a hotel restaurant.

499
00:34:23,666 --> 00:34:25,466
Why would we have dinner together?

500
00:34:26,566 --> 00:34:30,176
I don't want Christmas Eve memories with you.

501
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:36,106
Let's just meet at 11:50pm.

502
00:34:39,346 --> 00:34:41,346
Okay. Fine.

503
00:34:52,526 --> 00:34:53,526
Ji Wan.

504
00:34:53,996 --> 00:34:55,066
Yes?

505
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:56,936
Are you mad at me about something?

506
00:34:57,836 --> 00:34:58,836
No.

507
00:35:00,136 --> 00:35:01,466
But you seem mad.

508
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:04,206
You haven't said a word all morning.

509
00:35:05,906 --> 00:35:07,346
You're sore about what I said, aren't you?

510
00:35:08,446 --> 00:35:11,316
Hey. Still, you should at least tell me who you're meeting.

511
00:35:11,446 --> 00:35:14,246
This is a serious breach of my security duty.

512
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:16,846
I told you. I don't want to talk about it yet.

513
00:35:17,456 --> 00:35:18,586
I'll get back on my own, too.

514
00:35:20,626 --> 00:35:22,286
You've been moping around since that day, haven't you?

515
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:26,226
It's just that you tell me everything else,

516
00:35:26,596 --> 00:35:28,496
so it makes me curious when you're suddenly so secretive.

517
00:35:30,566 --> 00:35:34,406
That my mom is someone who'd take her daughter's liver...

518
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:36,536
I just don't want to have to tell you that.

519
00:35:39,676 --> 00:35:41,176
Why do you have to know everything?

520
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:44,476
- Who do you think you are? - We kissed, remember?

521
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:47,716
- You said it was a mistake. - Whatever!

522
00:35:47,786 --> 00:35:49,046
Just get the car keys.

523
00:35:58,556 --> 00:35:59,556
Hey.

524
00:36:01,026 --> 00:36:03,996
I'm about to go tell my dad that I'm becoming a webtoon artist.

525
00:36:05,136 --> 00:36:08,366
So instead of being upset with me, you should be encouraging me.

526
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:13,336
Really?

527
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:16,076
Right.

528
00:36:20,946 --> 00:36:22,246
I'm sorry, Yeong Ra.

529
00:36:23,686 --> 00:36:24,686
Encouragement.

530
00:36:30,656 --> 00:36:32,056
Park Yeong Ra, you're...

531
00:36:33,256 --> 00:36:35,466
You're a lot stronger than you think.

532
00:36:35,796 --> 00:36:37,436
You can do anything you set your mind to.

533
00:36:37,736 --> 00:36:40,436
And you're an amazing webtoon artist.

534
00:36:42,606 --> 00:36:43,606
And...

535
00:36:44,606 --> 00:36:47,746
if you could just see the look on your face when you draw,

536
00:36:48,646 --> 00:36:50,876
you'd fall for yourself too.

537
00:36:53,546 --> 00:36:54,946
Take a picture for me next time, without me knowing.

538
00:36:56,386 --> 00:36:57,386
Okay.

542
00:37:07,566 --> 00:37:08,566
And if I say no?

543
00:37:09,926 --> 00:37:10,936
Then I'll submit my resignation.

544
00:37:11,266 --> 00:37:13,036
In other words, I'll leave your company.

545
00:37:17,336 --> 00:37:19,576
Have the Sales Team for Japan come in.

546
00:37:19,836 --> 00:37:22,806
Tell the Management Team to compile and submit for my approval...

547
00:37:22,806 --> 00:37:24,476
all documents, including contracts related to the new product...

548
00:37:24,846 --> 00:37:28,086
and all companies we have verbal agreements with.

549
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:33,386
My goodness.

550
00:37:34,256 --> 00:37:36,056
Is this a surprise Christmas present?

551
00:37:36,956 --> 00:37:40,126
My daughter showing up on Christmas Eve is gift enough.

(Shoealls)

553
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:43,736
Dad, you've never gotten a bouquet from a woman, have you?

554
00:37:45,466 --> 00:37:46,636
What to say?

555
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:48,336
I actually have.

556
00:37:49,466 --> 00:37:50,476
From Mom?

557
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:53,976
Besides your mom, what other woman is that classy?

558
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:57,676
Wait, there is someone else. My daughter.

559
00:37:59,376 --> 00:38:01,446
You take after your mom, of course.

560
00:38:02,686 --> 00:38:04,686
I don't think I'm that much like Mom.

561
00:38:04,816 --> 00:38:08,886
Well, you've got a long way to go to be like her.

562
00:38:13,726 --> 00:38:17,036
- Dad, I have something to tell you. - Yes?

563
00:38:17,096 --> 00:38:18,996
Dad, you know what a webtoon is, right?

564
00:38:19,396 --> 00:38:20,566
Well, I draw them.

565
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:23,876
You draw comics? Is that your hobby?

566
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:26,736
No, it's not a hobby.

567
00:38:27,036 --> 00:38:29,606
I want to be a full-time artist. A webtoon artist.

568
00:38:30,646 --> 00:38:31,646
What?

569
00:38:32,716 --> 00:38:34,116
What? You're doing what?

570
00:38:35,116 --> 00:38:36,116
Like comics?

571
00:38:36,846 --> 00:38:37,856
Yes.

572
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:42,226
I've always loved both reading and drawing them.

573
00:38:42,886 --> 00:38:44,396
And now, I know for sure.

574
00:38:45,026 --> 00:38:47,826
I want to live my life as a webtoon artist.

575
00:38:49,466 --> 00:38:51,736
What childish nonsense are you spouting?

576
00:38:52,866 --> 00:38:53,936
Have you forgotten who you are?

577
00:38:54,706 --> 00:38:56,366
I've never heard of a business person...

578
00:38:56,366 --> 00:38:57,936
whose child draws comics.

579
00:38:59,376 --> 00:39:00,506
Don't you ever say that again.

580
00:39:04,246 --> 00:39:07,786
Your mother is trying to arrange the best possible marriage for you.

581
00:39:07,786 --> 00:39:10,046
She worked hard to make you a painter and now this?

582
00:39:10,686 --> 00:39:12,586
How dare you do something so beneath you?

583
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:19,856
But it's something I truly love, enjoy, and am good at.

584
00:39:20,896 --> 00:39:23,196
Can't you just let me do it and cheer me on?

585
00:39:25,366 --> 00:39:26,566
Does your mother know about this?

586
00:39:27,636 --> 00:39:29,266
She knew and let you get like this?

587
00:39:30,936 --> 00:39:33,946
Stop trying to disgrace our family and get a grip!

588
00:39:34,776 --> 00:39:35,776
I absolutely won't allow it!

589
00:39:37,676 --> 00:39:38,846
But Dad...

590
00:39:39,746 --> 00:39:41,546
I want to do it so badly.

591
00:39:42,416 --> 00:39:44,656
No! End of discussion!

592
00:39:59,166 --> 00:40:00,166
No.

593
00:40:01,306 --> 00:40:03,606
Unbelievable. What happened to this room?

594
00:40:09,646 --> 00:40:12,846
How could you discharge Woo Jin without my permission?

595
00:40:13,246 --> 00:40:17,886
He's an adult and was cleared to go, so the doctor approved it.

596
00:40:18,056 --> 00:40:20,956
But he can't fly for three months. That's why he was staying here.

597
00:40:21,126 --> 00:40:22,156
And you just let a sick kid walk out?

598
00:40:22,656 --> 00:40:26,326
He said he'll go to Dongwoo Hospital in Busan for outpatient care.

599
00:40:26,656 --> 00:40:27,796
Dongwoo Hospital in Busan?

Hello?

603
00:40:40,776 --> 00:40:42,246
Where did you hide Woo Jin?

604
00:40:43,976 --> 00:40:45,146
Hide him? What do you mean?

605
00:40:46,276 --> 00:40:47,586
Is Woo Jin missing?

606
00:40:47,886 --> 00:40:49,586
Stop playing games and just tell me.

607
00:40:50,046 --> 00:40:52,886
What can he possibly do in Korea on his own with no money?

608
00:40:53,056 --> 00:40:54,286
It doesn't make any sense.

609
00:40:54,626 --> 00:40:57,086
You're right. He wouldn't have any money.

610
00:40:58,826 --> 00:41:00,766
So he disappeared from the hospital?

611
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:03,426
You really have no idea?

612
00:41:04,236 --> 00:41:05,596
I heard you've been visiting him twice a week.

613
00:41:07,706 --> 00:41:09,436
He didn't say anything to me about it.

614
00:41:10,006 --> 00:41:11,876
I'll start by calling his friends.

615
00:41:17,346 --> 00:41:19,116
So he disappeared without Eun Oh knowing?

616
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:23,646
Then...

617
00:41:24,286 --> 00:41:27,556
(Mom)

618
00:41:37,666 --> 00:41:40,236
- Hello? - You've heard from Woo Jin, right?

619
00:41:41,336 --> 00:41:44,106
What makes you think Woo Jin would've contacted me?

620
00:41:44,406 --> 00:41:47,076
Because he left the hospital and disappeared.

621
00:41:49,646 --> 00:41:53,516
Did he? I haven't heard from him. I'm hanging up.

622
00:41:56,786 --> 00:41:59,916
My gosh. Her own brother's gone missing...

623
00:42:03,556 --> 00:42:04,726
Hey, Yeong Ra.

624
00:42:06,626 --> 00:42:08,296
What's this about Woo Jin disappearing?

625
00:42:10,126 --> 00:42:12,636
I think Woo Jin has made his decision.

626
00:42:13,166 --> 00:42:15,436
At some point, there are choices to be made.

627
00:42:16,106 --> 00:42:17,476
There comes a time when you have to decide.

628
00:42:19,506 --> 00:42:20,976
So that's what he meant.

629
00:42:22,646 --> 00:42:24,846
Woo Jin decided to strike out on his own.

630
00:42:25,976 --> 00:42:28,616
So what are you going to do?

631
00:42:29,486 --> 00:42:30,486
You mean about my dad?

632
00:42:31,656 --> 00:42:32,656
I'm moving on to the next step.

633
00:42:33,556 --> 00:42:35,856
And what is that supposed to mean?

634
00:42:38,396 --> 00:42:39,396
You're going to be surprised.

635
00:42:39,956 --> 00:42:42,496
The suspense is killing me. Just tell me!

636
00:42:44,696 --> 00:42:45,696
It's...

637
00:43:00,276 --> 00:43:02,746
Why haven't I heard from Ji Eun Oh?

638
00:43:06,316 --> 00:43:07,486
You still haven't found out?

639
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:11,526
(Eunoism, Ji Eun Oh)

640
00:43:12,096 --> 00:43:13,856
Gosh, why isn't she reading my texts?

641
00:43:16,796 --> 00:43:19,796
I'm leaving work now. Come straight home.

642
00:43:20,836 --> 00:43:21,836
What...

643
00:43:23,436 --> 00:43:24,436
My gosh.

644
00:43:25,006 --> 00:43:26,806
He sounded furious.

645
00:43:30,276 --> 00:43:31,716
I wonder if Woo Jin went home.

646
00:43:38,716 --> 00:43:41,056
How exactly have you been handling Yeong Ra?

647
00:43:41,586 --> 00:43:43,426
Yeong Ra?

648
00:43:43,986 --> 00:43:46,096
What's this nonsense about her becoming a webtoon artist?

649
00:43:46,596 --> 00:43:49,596
She wants to waste her life on that. What have you been doing?

650
00:43:50,396 --> 00:43:51,396
Wait, Yeong Ra...

651
00:43:52,066 --> 00:43:55,436
Did Yeong Ra go see you at the office?

652
00:43:57,166 --> 00:43:58,176
Is something wrong with you?

653
00:43:59,306 --> 00:44:00,306
Why are you so distracted?

654
00:44:00,976 --> 00:44:02,546
You're clearly not listening to what I'm saying.

655
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:05,646
No, it's not that. The moment I heard Yeong Ra's name,

656
00:44:05,876 --> 00:44:07,686
I was just completely flustered.

657
00:44:07,986 --> 00:44:12,686
How could she think of going to you? I specifically told her not to.

658
00:44:13,686 --> 00:44:15,786
Why didn't you tell me about this sooner?

659
00:44:16,356 --> 00:44:19,556
Come on! Because it wasn't worth bothering you with.

660
00:44:20,326 --> 00:44:21,966
Here, just... Have a seat.

661
00:44:23,326 --> 00:44:24,336
Sit down.

662
00:44:25,036 --> 00:44:26,966
You've never had that kind of experience, right?

663
00:44:28,036 --> 00:44:30,006
Being around someone from a lower class,

664
00:44:30,006 --> 00:44:31,876
I thought she was just hooked on that cheap drama like junk food,

665
00:44:31,876 --> 00:44:33,236
and that it would pass.

666
00:44:33,606 --> 00:44:35,806
Besides, that boy is Seong Jae's friend's brother.

667
00:44:36,646 --> 00:44:38,576
So you're saying Mr. Lee influenced her?

668
00:44:39,046 --> 00:44:43,316
Of course. But I heard he resigned.

669
00:44:43,716 --> 00:44:45,556
So I figured my worries were over.

670
00:44:46,286 --> 00:44:49,056
But then, Yeong Ra came to see me all on her own.

671
00:44:49,786 --> 00:44:51,326
From tomorrow on, Yeong Ra is grounded.

672
00:44:54,866 --> 00:44:56,496
About Woo Jin getting a liver transplant,

673
00:44:57,366 --> 00:44:58,566
is it okay if I tell Dad?

674
00:45:00,366 --> 00:45:01,836
Well, honey.

675
00:45:02,306 --> 00:45:05,536
I think I was too overprotective, raising Yeong Ra in a bubble.

676
00:45:05,976 --> 00:45:08,646
So let's just think of this as a late rebellious phase.

677
00:45:08,946 --> 00:45:11,116
Honey, let's just cut her some slack.

678
00:45:12,216 --> 00:45:14,846
You have to nip these problems in the bud.

679
00:45:15,586 --> 00:45:19,856
It's just a late rebellious phase. You know how intense that can be.

680
00:45:20,986 --> 00:45:25,426
Once Mr. Lee is gone, she'll lose interest in no time.

681
00:45:25,696 --> 00:45:28,226
What can she do on her own? Where's the fun in doing it alone?

682
00:45:30,096 --> 00:45:32,666
And what if she still wants to do it even after he leaves?

683
00:45:33,236 --> 00:45:36,206
Well, in that case... Then we'll have to lock her up.

685
00:45:54,956 --> 00:45:56,186
Merry Christmas.

686
00:46:00,256 --> 00:46:01,266
Here you go.

687
00:46:03,566 --> 00:46:06,366
What's this? Is it for my sister?

688
00:46:07,096 --> 00:46:08,106
Your sister? Who's that?

689
00:46:08,736 --> 00:46:12,576
Let's just call it a Christmas gift from a regular.

690
00:46:13,136 --> 00:46:14,136
Oh, my.

691
00:46:15,206 --> 00:46:17,446
- Mr. CEO, you're here. - Hello, Mother.

692
00:46:17,916 --> 00:46:20,616
And please, don't call me CEO. I'm one of Eun Oh's friends.

693
00:46:23,516 --> 00:46:26,856
And this is just a little something for Christmas Eve.

694
00:46:26,856 --> 00:46:29,026
You shouldn't have.

695
00:46:29,956 --> 00:46:31,656
All right, I'll be off then.

696
00:46:31,926 --> 00:46:35,696
Mr. Lee, I'm starving. Should we grab a bite before we go?

697
00:46:35,926 --> 00:46:38,836
- Should we? - Of course. Please eat first.

698
00:46:39,966 --> 00:46:41,866
- Yes. - Gang Oh, give me a hand here.

699

Gray tiles for the floor.

700
00:46:52,176 --> 00:46:54,416
Natural wood for the walls.

00:47:09,826 --> 00:47:10,826
Is he a part-timer?

705
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:22,046
Ji Hyuk?

706
00:47:23,776 --> 00:47:26,946
- Eun Oh. - What? What are you doing here?

707
00:47:27,346 --> 00:47:29,916
A bunch of customers left all at once.

708
00:47:35,326 --> 00:47:38,556
Ji Gang Oh, why accept help from just anyone?

709
00:47:39,156 --> 00:47:41,766
Come on. Is he "just anyone" to you?

710
00:47:42,426 --> 00:47:44,636
I thought he was more than just some guy.

711
00:47:46,336 --> 00:47:50,566
So if he's just some guy, should I kick him out next time?

712
00:47:51,376 --> 00:47:53,536
No, that's not what I meant.

713
00:47:54,276 --> 00:47:57,106
- Accepting his help makes me... - You don't like it?

714
00:47:57,606 --> 00:47:59,146
Or does it make you uncomfortable?

715
00:48:00,776 --> 00:48:02,486
Right. It's just...

716
00:48:03,016 --> 00:48:05,386
So which is it? You don't like it? Or it makes you uncomfortable?

717
00:48:06,256 --> 00:48:08,156
Why is the brilliant Ji Eun Oh suddenly so evasive?

718
00:48:09,126 --> 00:48:10,226
I'm uncomfortable.

719
00:48:10,526 --> 00:48:12,456
So don't ask him to help out anymore.

720
00:48:13,556 --> 00:48:16,366
So I can come as a customer daily, right?

721
00:48:18,196 --> 00:48:19,396
Yes, I guess.

722
00:48:19,766 --> 00:48:23,306
No. It's just that we can't really turn customers away.

723
00:48:23,366 --> 00:48:24,806
Eun Oh, you're beating around the bush.

724
00:48:25,876 --> 00:48:28,076
A simple "thank you" would've been enough.

725
00:48:29,476 --> 00:48:30,476
Thank you.

726
00:48:31,346 --> 00:48:32,776
Anyway, Merry Christmas.

727
00:48:33,516 --> 00:48:36,446
- I should get going now, Mother. - Oh, wait.

728
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:37,546
Mr. Lee.

729
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:39,516
Just a second.

730
00:48:41,356 --> 00:48:45,896
We always have cake on Christmas Eve.

731
00:48:45,956 --> 00:48:47,796
Please stay and have some with us.

732
00:48:48,596 --> 00:48:49,596
Could I?

733
00:48:49,896 --> 00:48:52,636
To be honest, clearing those tables worked up an appetite.

734
00:49:03,476 --> 00:49:06,276
He helped us out. Our guest should eat first.

735
00:49:07,316 --> 00:49:08,486
Thank you, Mother.

736
00:49:08,916 --> 00:49:11,856
"Mother." That sounds a bit awkward.

737
00:49:13,516 --> 00:49:17,856
- Gang Oh. - Now, I'm curious.

738
00:49:18,426 --> 00:49:20,926
You and Eun Oh aren't dating, are you?

739
00:49:21,896 --> 00:49:23,996
- I'd like to be. - Ji Hyuk!

740
00:49:26,636 --> 00:49:28,206
My feelings are one-sided.

741
00:49:28,906 --> 00:49:29,936
I'm sorry.

742
00:49:30,406 --> 00:49:34,746
No, there's no need to apologize for your feelings.

743
00:49:35,346 --> 00:49:36,406
No, there is.

744
00:49:37,646 --> 00:49:38,646
It's just...

745
00:49:39,446 --> 00:49:40,676
I'm not good enough for her.

746
00:49:42,216 --> 00:49:43,946
That's enough. Let's just have some cake.

747
00:49:44,316 --> 00:49:45,516
- You too, Mom. - Right.

748
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,926
- After you, Mother. - All right.

749
00:49:48,526 --> 00:49:49,956
- Here, you have some. - Okay.

750
00:49:56,666 --> 00:49:59,466
This cake is delicious. Eun Oh has great taste.

751
00:50:02,536 --> 00:50:03,806
Let me do it. Give it here.

752
00:50:05,176 --> 00:50:06,336
Unbelievable.

753
00:51:06,696 --> 00:51:08,466
He should walk with his shoulders back.

754
00:51:20,576 --> 00:51:21,686
Seong Jae.

755
00:51:28,926 --> 00:51:30,086
Park Seong Jae.

756
00:51:36,326 --> 00:51:37,426
You're asking for trouble.

757
00:51:37,936 --> 00:51:39,266
Who said you could call me Park Seong Jae?

758
00:51:39,736 --> 00:51:41,306
I've never had the chance to say it.

759
00:51:47,636 --> 00:51:48,746
You're not wearing gloves?

760
00:51:49,476 --> 00:51:50,476
Hold on.

761
00:51:58,586 --> 00:51:59,956
Merry Christmas.

762
00:52:02,456 --> 00:52:03,726
A Christmas present?

763
00:52:04,126 --> 00:52:06,756
Yes. I got mine early, remember?

764
00:52:13,336 --> 00:52:15,366
There was so much I wanted to give you.

765
00:52:16,836 --> 00:52:18,536
So many things I wanted to do for you.

766
00:52:19,476 --> 00:52:21,746
There were a lot of things I wanted to do with you, too.

767
00:52:23,776 --> 00:52:24,776
We really...

768
00:52:25,916 --> 00:52:27,746
missed out on a lot, didn't we?

769
00:52:28,746 --> 00:52:30,516
But there were so many good times, too.

770
00:52:31,456 --> 00:52:32,456
Let me see.

771
00:52:34,486 --> 00:52:35,626
You've got a cut.

772
00:52:37,686 --> 00:52:39,526
- Hey, you! - That day, I thought it was cool...

773
00:52:39,526 --> 00:52:42,696
- You're just going to take that? - how you got mad for me.

774
00:52:43,266 --> 00:52:45,536
- Because of my situation, - I didn't buy this...

775
00:52:45,536 --> 00:52:47,166
you put up with it and let her hit you.

776
00:52:47,166 --> 00:52:48,706
- That made me emotional. - Isn't it cute?

777
00:52:49,536 --> 00:52:51,236
- You were quirky and unpredictable. - You guessed it.

778
00:52:51,576 --> 00:52:53,876
- So it was fun. - Our date today is a camping trip.

779
00:52:54,076 --> 00:52:56,276
You were always so gentle,

780
00:52:57,146 --> 00:52:58,346
but when it counted,

781
00:52:58,946 --> 00:53:02,046
- you'd be tough, and I loved that. - Don't you yell at Su Bin.

782
00:53:02,386 --> 00:53:03,716
- That's what I loved about it. - Take it out on me.

783
00:53:04,986 --> 00:53:07,456
You always had some new expression I'd never seen before.

784
00:53:08,656 --> 00:53:10,356
- Thanks to you, - First time waiting in line, right?

785
00:53:10,426 --> 00:53:13,796
- I did things I never would've. - We're really doing it all today.

786
00:53:14,326 --> 00:53:15,866
Staring into the fire, and now staring at the rain.

787
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:19,636
- And when you took my side, - Are you crazy?

788
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:21,866
- it was cute. I was grateful. - Who are you to say that?

789
00:53:22,436 --> 00:53:23,936
You were cute too.

790
00:53:24,606 --> 00:53:26,476
- Because of my ex, - I'm not giving you my number.

791
00:53:26,776 --> 00:53:28,146
you'd get jealous.

792
00:53:28,476 --> 00:53:30,706
- Hey. - And you tried to look my age.

793
00:53:35,516 --> 00:53:37,186
Even though you're younger than me,

794
00:53:37,746 --> 00:53:41,326
in some ways, you were more mature and considerate than I was.

795
00:53:42,256 --> 00:53:43,326
And poised.

796
00:53:45,996 --> 00:53:47,396
I learned a lot from you.

797
00:53:48,596 --> 00:53:49,666
So I...

798
00:53:50,266 --> 00:53:51,896
couldn't help but fall in love with you.

799
00:53:53,036 --> 00:53:54,906
I just liked you.

800
00:54:01,306 --> 00:54:02,606
Ever since middle school,

801
00:54:03,646 --> 00:54:05,516
I'd always find an excuse to come over to your house.

802
00:54:07,746 --> 00:54:09,616
I only became friends with Ji Hyuk just to see you.

803
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:13,886
Your parents gave me so much love.

804
00:54:15,626 --> 00:54:16,986
If it weren't for them,

805
00:54:19,556 --> 00:54:21,196
I could've been selfish.

806
00:54:23,296 --> 00:54:24,366
You can't do that.

807
00:54:26,036 --> 00:54:27,366
I can't either.

808
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:31,636
I can't just go and break my parents' hearts.

809
00:54:33,906 --> 00:54:34,906
We can't.

810
00:54:46,016 --> 00:54:47,586
I'm breaking up with you.

811
00:54:57,496 --> 00:54:58,496
Okay.

812
00:55:00,366 --> 00:55:01,466
I'm breaking up...

813
00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:03,766
with you too.

814
00:55:21,356 --> 00:55:23,686
I wanted to take such good care of you.

815
00:55:25,256 --> 00:55:27,456
They say this kind of love isn't right.

816
00:55:29,266 --> 00:55:31,836
They might say a love like a mother's love is wrong, but...

817
00:55:34,836 --> 00:55:37,566
Even though you didn't get much love from your own mother,

818
00:55:40,636 --> 00:55:43,076
I wanted to make sure you never felt that void...

819
00:55:44,146 --> 00:55:46,676
and give you all the love I had.

820
00:55:51,516 --> 00:55:52,586
No.

821
00:55:54,856 --> 00:55:56,126
You already have.

822
00:55:59,026 --> 00:56:00,056
Su Bin.

823
00:56:01,356 --> 00:56:02,996
Every single moment I spent with you...

824
00:56:04,066 --> 00:56:05,336
was wonderful, and I was happy.

825
00:56:06,636 --> 00:56:07,736
And you...

826
00:56:09,206 --> 00:56:10,336
gave me...

827
00:56:10,906 --> 00:56:13,536
more than I could ever have imagined.

828
00:56:21,886 --> 00:56:22,986
Thank you for everything.

829
00:56:30,226 --> 00:56:31,756
I'm so glad.

830
00:56:36,126 --> 00:56:37,126
It's true.

831
00:56:38,996 --> 00:56:40,036
Hey.

832
00:56:41,666 --> 00:56:42,766
Take care of yourself.

833
00:56:51,716 --> 00:56:52,716
Yes.

834
00:56:55,016 --> 00:56:56,046
Su Bin.

835
00:56:57,886 --> 00:56:59,116
I hope you find someone good.

836
00:57:02,686 --> 00:57:03,686
Yes.

837
00:57:07,756 --> 00:57:08,796
You too.

838
00:57:11,366 --> 00:57:12,366
I'm leaving.

839
00:57:15,536 --> 00:57:16,566
Goodbye.

(Director Ko Seong Hui)

841
00:58:10,356 --> 00:58:11,386
Hello?

842
00:58:12,156 --> 00:58:15,766
- You've found Woo Jin, haven't you? - Well, I don't know about that.

843
00:58:15,826 --> 00:58:18,166
No, wait. You didn't even have to look for him, did you?

844
00:58:18,866 --> 00:58:20,596
Because you're the one who hid him away.

845
00:58:21,236 --> 00:58:23,866
You still talk about Woo Jin as if he's property.

846
00:58:24,836 --> 00:58:26,206
Hid him away?

847
00:58:26,806 --> 00:58:29,276
Han Woo Jin went off to live his own life.

848
00:58:30,176 --> 00:58:32,546
Why don't you just let him be?

849
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:34,846
Live your own life.

850
00:58:35,286 --> 00:58:38,486
If you have any conscience at all, leave Woo Jin alone!

851
00:58:39,386 --> 00:58:42,526
Who do you think you are to go on about Woo Jin's life?

852
00:58:43,756 --> 00:58:47,426
I know better than anyone. I went through the same thing.

853
00:58:48,996 --> 00:58:52,996
You came to me sophisticated, decent, and elegant.

854
00:58:53,336 --> 00:58:56,036
Pretending to be this grateful woman.

855
00:58:56,436 --> 00:58:59,406
And you made me like you and trust you.

856
00:59:00,936 --> 00:59:04,446
Imagine how it was for Woo Jin, whom you've gaslit all his life.

857
00:59:06,076 --> 00:59:07,146
He is my son.

858
00:59:07,776 --> 00:59:08,916
Tell me where he is!

859
00:59:10,716 --> 00:59:13,886
You tell me to spit it out, and you think I will?

860
00:59:14,986 --> 00:59:16,156
Stop looking for Woo Jin.

861
00:59:17,326 --> 00:59:19,456
I said, let him live his own life.

862
00:59:20,796 --> 00:59:22,466
If you don't back off from Woo Jin,

863
00:59:23,766 --> 00:59:25,266
I won't go easy on you.

864
00:59:31,806 --> 00:59:33,006
You won't go easy on me?

(Damga Charcoal Grill)

866
00:59:49,386 --> 00:59:50,386
Get out.

(Order Details)

868
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:00,596
I'm a customer.

869
01:00:01,066 --> 01:00:02,536
We're not serving you.

870
01:00:07,136 --> 01:00:09,876
Will you kick out a paying customer, Ji Eun Oh's little brother?

871
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:16,146
- Why on earth are you here again? - Get Eun Oh for me.

872
01:00:16,646 --> 01:00:18,086
I'm not leaving until she's here.

873
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:24,826
She what?

874
01:00:25,126 --> 01:00:28,496
She has murderous eyes. I don't think she'll leave.

875
01:00:30,726 --> 01:00:32,566
Since she ordered and is acting like a customer,

876
01:00:33,366 --> 01:00:34,936
we can't even call the cops.

877
01:00:41,206 --> 01:00:42,306
Eun Oh.

878
01:00:43,746 --> 01:00:45,916
Don't worry. I'll handle this.

879
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:48,846
Just make sure Mom calms down.

880
01:00:49,986 --> 01:00:51,286
I'll keep a close eye on her.

881
01:01:00,256 --> 01:01:02,526
Okay. Here I am.

882
01:01:03,466 --> 01:01:04,796
Let's do this the easy way.

883
01:01:05,296 --> 01:01:06,836
Tell me where Woo Jin is.

884
01:01:07,666 --> 01:01:10,206
You know he's at Dongwoo Hospital in Busan, right?

885
01:01:11,066 --> 01:01:15,446
Find his outpatient schedule. You can wait and see him then.

886
01:01:15,506 --> 01:01:16,506
No.

887
01:01:17,246 --> 01:01:19,576
Bring him back to the hospital in Seoul. Right now.

888
01:01:20,146 --> 01:01:21,276
And why would I do that?

889
01:01:22,116 --> 01:01:25,886
Woo Jin is done living life on your terms.

890
01:01:26,316 --> 01:01:29,386
He won't stand for it, and neither will I.

891
01:01:31,686 --> 01:01:34,096
You're the one who put these ideas in his head, aren't you?

892
01:01:35,296 --> 01:01:38,096
I knew it. It was you.

893
01:01:39,366 --> 01:01:40,496
Are we done here?

894
01:01:41,436 --> 01:01:43,036
I believe I've warned you before.

895
01:01:43,636 --> 01:01:46,406
To stay away from my mom's restaurant.

896
01:01:47,436 --> 01:01:48,476
Eun Oh.

897
01:01:48,976 --> 01:01:51,506
Do you have any idea how I found you?

898
01:01:52,116 --> 01:01:55,516
Woo Jin is half the universe I built.

899
01:01:55,886 --> 01:01:57,386
And you expect me to give that up?

900
01:01:58,446 --> 01:02:00,416
This restaurant you hold so dear...

901
01:02:00,416 --> 01:02:01,986
How about I shut it down in a month?

902
01:02:02,626 --> 01:02:03,626
What?

903
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:07,856
Health violation, food poisoning... The possibilities are endless.

904
01:02:08,666 --> 01:02:11,126
And you think it'll end there?

905
01:02:12,366 --> 01:02:14,296
What about your mother and your brother?

906
01:02:16,136 --> 01:02:18,776
I'll make it so they can't function in society.

907
01:02:20,036 --> 01:02:23,706
They can live comfortably at home on your dime.

908
01:02:24,106 --> 01:02:26,746
- Are you finished? - Just give me Woo Jin.

909
01:02:28,216 --> 01:02:31,616
Listen to me. I gave you a million dollars.

910
01:02:31,686 --> 01:02:33,416
And you took the money.

911
01:02:34,286 --> 01:02:37,126
That means our accounts are settled.

912
01:02:37,456 --> 01:02:40,726
You took what was yours. For you to interfere in our lives...

913
01:02:40,796 --> 01:02:42,196
is a breach of our agreement.

914
01:02:51,336 --> 01:02:52,606
For now, please just leave.

915
01:02:56,406 --> 01:02:57,846
Especially your brother.

916
01:02:58,976 --> 01:03:03,346
He'll never work or run a business for as long as he lives.

917
01:03:03,416 --> 01:03:04,916
I get it. Now, just go!

918
01:03:06,816 --> 01:03:09,486
Send me Woo Jin's whereabouts by midnight tonight.

919
01:03:24,866 --> 01:03:26,906
- I'm just stepping out. - Eun Oh.

920
01:03:27,006 --> 01:03:28,036
Eun Oh.

921
01:03:29,646 --> 01:03:30,646
Eun Oh!

922
01:04:02,146 --> 01:04:03,306
What's she doing here?

923
01:04:19,126 --> 01:04:20,256
Wait, Eun Oh?

924
01:04:23,996 --> 01:04:24,996
Why...

925
01:04:39,976 --> 01:04:40,976
Eun Oh.

926
01:04:41,946 --> 01:04:42,946
Vice President.

927
01:04:43,446 --> 01:04:45,516
What are you doing here?

928
01:04:51,486 --> 01:04:53,896
Eun Oh, why are you with my mother?

929
01:05:16,246 --> 01:05:18,246
So you know each other?

930
01:05:30,126 --> 01:05:31,366
Don't tell me...

931
01:05:33,296 --> 01:05:34,536
Is she your birth mother?

932
01:06:22,216 --> 01:06:24,446
(Our Golden Days)

933
01:06:24,516 --> 01:06:28,156
Please, let me get an interview. Anywhere.

934
01:06:28,256 --> 01:06:31,156
You even declared me dead. And without a body, no less.

935
01:06:31,226 --> 01:06:34,496
How did you manage to do that? And how much does your husband know?

936
01:06:34,556 --> 01:06:36,796
I can't believe that she-devil is Seong Jae's stepmom.

937
01:06:37,366 --> 01:06:38,726
Sorry, I guess I was just a little shocked.

938
01:06:38,836 --> 01:06:39,996
The thing you're trying to do!

939
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:43,966
If I take the fall for this, do you want your dad to see that?

940
01:06:43,966 --> 01:06:46,276
Thank you for raising me.

941
01:06:48,236 --> 01:06:51,276
Isn't this ridiculous? Who am I living like this for?

942
01:06:51,346 --> 01:06:53,646
Honey! You're all trying to kill me, aren't you?

943
01:06:53,716 --> 01:06:54,716
That darn witch.
