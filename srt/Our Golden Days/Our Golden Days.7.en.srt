00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:03,170
(Episode 7)

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:06,410
Hey, Director.

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:08,910
Eun Oh.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,520
What...

5
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:16,450
do you think of me?

6
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:24,830
What?

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,200
What...

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,930
do you think of me?

9
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:33,270
Why are you asking me that
out of the blue?

10
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,050
How does it feel when I do this?

11
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,520
Is it funny?

12
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,390
Did I alarm you?

13
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:49,990
Did I frighten you?

14
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,090
What's this?

15
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,800
It's not like you to ask
such baffling questions.

16
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,360
I'll tell you why over a meal.

17
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,230
I heard you skipped dinner.

18
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,300
Sure.

19
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,040
I was planning
to grab a bite to eat...

20
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,040
since I had to sleep here tonight
after working on the partition.

21
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:09,270
What should we have?

22
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,070
- What are you doing?
- Get out.

23
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,310
What is this?

24
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,620
How are your blind dates going?

25
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,390
Are any of them panning out?

26
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,720
Not yet.

27
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:57,890
Why's that?

28
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,460
You've been on two more dates
since the last one I heard of.

29
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,830
I have really high standards,
you see.

30
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,030
It won't be an easy process.

31
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,070
After being betrayed by some weirdo,

32
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:11,240
I've been considering
my options carefully.

33
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,340
That's a lie.

34
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,110
A lie?

35
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,610
Eun Oh,

36
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,040
you can be quite mean.

37
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,450
I've heard that being too kind
was my downfall,

38
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,280
but I've never
been called mean before.

39
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,550
Although, I do have a temper.

40
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,090
I feel bad for those men.

41
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,830
They had their hopes up...

42
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,760
and met a nice lady,
just as they expected.

43
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,660
Nine out of ten of them probably
asked you out on a second date,

44
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,830
but you would have turned
most of them down.

45
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,310
I'm not going on dates
just to pass the time.

46
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:50,610
My mom said that dating someone
was the best way to move on.

47
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,510
You might think that on the outside,

48
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,310
but you don't feel that way.

49
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,850
What Ji Hyuk did
created a huge ripple,

50
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,720
and you're going on dates
to distract yourself.

51
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,020
That's mean, you know.

52
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,760
Don't talk like you know everything.

53
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,690
Consider your recent date,
for example.

54
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,660
Su Jeong showed me a photo.

55
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,000
He seemed nice, was tall,

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,170
and had a good job.

57
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:16,670
Why didn't you agree
to a second date?

58
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,540
I wasn't attracted to him,
that's all.

59
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,440
And that will be the trend for you.

60
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,310
The fact that you keep
rejecting second dates...

61
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,010
shows you don't intend
to get serious with anyone.

62
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:38,120
How did you know
I always get asked on second dates?

63
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,330
I only said that
to make you feel good.

64
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,900
Seriously. Do you always
get asked on second dates?

65
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,470
Well, it just happened that way.

66
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,070
You should stop going
on blind dates.

67
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,380
I'll step in for all of them.

68
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,780
You'll step in?

69
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,710
The three of us.

70
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,080
Let's team up for a game.

71
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,090
Su Jeong taught you
how to play, right?

72
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,950
The three of us,
playing a video game?

73
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,420
It'll be so fun you won't think
about anything else,

74
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,790
and all your stress will be gone.

75
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:19,330
You were hilarious that day.

76
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,900
What?

77
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,400
What is it?

78
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,340
It's Director Seong Jae.

79
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,510
What?

80
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:31,880
You're right.

81
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:34,550
- Director!
- Hey.

82
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,650
Don't. He's obviously working,
so let's go.

83
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,990
Hey, wait.

84
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,420
- Director!
- My gosh.

85
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:44,920
Su Jeong, hey.

86
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,260
What? Eun Oh, you're here too.

87
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,660
Just a second.

88
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,430
Well, this...

89
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,600
No. Please, no.

90
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,710
Do you play this game too?

91
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,280
Beats me. I didn't know
you played this game.

92
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:07,350
I played this game in college...

93
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,050
and recently picked it up again.

94
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,780
No way.
Look at how much he wanted to win.

95
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,520
I understand fully and more.

96
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:16,950
Goodness.

97
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,090
You have the newly released helmet
and sniper rifle.

98
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,760
Is this game really that fun?

99
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:23,590
Well...

100
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,860
I was only going to play
during my lunch hour but...

101
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,170
It's 2:30 p.m.

102
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:30,670
What?

103
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,470
Already?

104
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,410
Gosh, you're right.

105
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,680
I have a prior engagement,

106
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,650
so either patch things up
or end things for good.

107
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,160
I was off to the stationery store.

108
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:56,730
Right.

109
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,330
I see.

110
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,970
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

111
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:11,240
I'm the reason
you haven't stopped by the cafe.

112
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,880
I didn't have the time,
not that I couldn't.

113
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,280
Are you laughing?

114
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,720
Don't you know how to be angry?

115
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,950
Ji Hyuk's the one I'm upset with,

116
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,990
so why haven't you spoken up...

117
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:27,090
about why I've been trying
to cut you off too?

118
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:31,500
Come to think of it,
it did seem unfair.

119
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:35,800
I didn't think
I was only Ji Hyuk's friend to you.

120
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,940
We've known each other
for nine years now.

121
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,970
I thought...

122
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:44,110
I was at least your friend
or an honorary senior.

123
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:47,450
You are. You're a friend
and an honorary senior.

124
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,780
You're an honorary member
of Value of Hangyeol, after all.

125
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,790
I guess I was too overwhelmed
to think clearly.

126
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,760
Never mind that.
I was wrong to treat you like that.

127
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,330
I'm really sorry.

128
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,570
An official apology like that...

129
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:09,600
only puts space between us.

130
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,670
Is that why you've been going
to other cafes instead?

131
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,780
Well... Anyway, what about you?
How have you been?

132
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,150
Don't brush off the offer
from your senior.

133
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,320
Think it through.

134
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,790
My senior?

135
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,420
You referred to me as your senior...

136
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,020
before I started working
at the company.

137
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,930
Hey, you're not wrong.

138
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,100
Why did I start calling you
Director instead?

139
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,070
How should I know?

140
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,600
You're the one
who made the switch...

141
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,300
after I handed you my business card.

142
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,840
You're right.

143
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,180
Head back inside, then.

144
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,550
You were working on a partition
for your desk.

145
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:56,710
Sure, Seong Jae.

146
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,550
What?

147
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,020
That's just for today.

148
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,140
(Edel Orphanage)

149
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,520
You're here.

150
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,090
I heard there was
an argument yesterday,

151
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,560
but you still came here to work.

152
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,360
Actually, it's not that.

153
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,420
Our manager...

154
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,860
asked for your address
to get you your phone.

155
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,100
So I told him...

156
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,460
you'd be back to work here.

157
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,600
And of course,
you're the first to arrive.

158
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,400
Actually, that's not why I'm here.

159
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,900
The manager said he got angry
with you about something,

160
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,310
and I apologize for that.

161
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:57,780
It's okay.

162
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,940
By the way, what should I call you?

163
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,850
Lee would do.

164
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,050
Sure, Lee.

165
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,420
Lee,

166
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,490
can you clean the paint stains
on the hallway walls?

167
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:11,460
The supplies you need
are over there.

168
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,260
You have to work alone, though.

169
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,330
Okay.

170
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,750
I'm exhausted.

171
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,980
Let's go.

172
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,720
Hurry up.

173
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,520
For lunch today,
we'll have bibimbap and pork cutlet.

174
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,690
- Okay!
- Yes! Let's go!

175
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,060
- Yeong Sik's face is like bibimbap.
- Stop it.

176
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,790
Hey, Eun Oh.

177
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,360
What?

178
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,890
Why did Mr. Park come to see you
around closing time?

179
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,960
Oh, that?

180
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,200
He told me off.

181
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,700
What?

182
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,600
Was that really your plan?

183
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,040
Mr. Park saved my guy friends
from being sacrificed.

184
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,810
I thought
I'd meet someone I liked...

185
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,310
if I kept going on blind dates.

186
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,010
But what?

187
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:43,410
What Mr. Park said made me think.

188
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,020
I was wrong.

189
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,450
I don't want to be
in love right now.

190
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,920
I thought you were trying
to get over love with love.

191
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,790
Sorry.

192
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,660
Cancel the rest of the dates.

193
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:01,800
Shall we play a game, then?

194
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,300
Right now?

195
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,700
We have to open the cafe soon.

196
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,300
Only until we have a customer.

197
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,840
You need to play with us three.

198
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,380
You're the worst at it,
and you need to get better fast.

199
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,510
- I have to join your team?
- Yes.

200
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,850
As a fourth member?

201
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,250
What if I keep dying
and you need to keep reviving me?

202
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,320
I'll do it.

203
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:22,050
That's why you need to practice.

204
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,590
Lee Ji Hyuk's number doesn't exist.
Who knows if he's alive?

205
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,600
(Value of Hangyeol Alumni)

206
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,570
Ha Jun Sang's such a busybody.

207
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,300
(Settings)

208
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,970
He changed his phone number?

209
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,640
I guess
he doesn't want to hear from us?

210
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:48,180
Are you not worried about him?

211
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:49,880
No.

212
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,680
How could you not be worried?

213
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,650
It's not that I'm not worried.

214
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,120
I won't worry
because I don't want to.

215
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,290
He's no longer
someone I should worry about.

216
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,460
Why do you keep asking?

217
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,660
Aren't you a human being?

218
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,330
What is it you want to say?

219
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:07,500
Don't pretend to be an AI.

220
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,930
Did it hurt your pride that much?

221
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,640
Are you embarrassed you thought...

222
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,940
the shallow guy
was the greatest guy in the world?

223
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:17,240
Yes, it's killing me.
I wasted so much time.

224
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,680
I don't want to worry about someone
with zero value.

225
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,810
I won't worry.

226
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,660
Seong Jae. I'm sorry you have to
get into work late because of me.

227
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:38,760
I have my parents' permission
to be late, so don't feel bad.

228
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,330
Even so, I feel bad...

229
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,500
and grateful.

230
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,570
Mom's interviewing people, but...

231
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:50,240
It's hard to find someone
after what you've been through.

232
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,780
Yeong Ra. Don't worry.

233
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,480
You'll get a temporary driver soon.

234
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,180
A driver slash bodyguard?

235
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,490
You're a pretty good driver.

236
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:04,590
You got beaten up
for taking Ji Hyuk's car...

237
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,290
to drive your girlfriend around.

238
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,690
Come on, Seong Jae.
That was long ago.

239
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,830
Only until we hire someone.

240
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:15,170
It'll be two months at most.
Can you help us out?

241
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,840
I can't find anyone I can trust.

242
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,610
I just applied
for a really nice job.

243
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,840
- Where?
- Do you know Songseong Group?

244
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:28,610
There's an employee-only gym.

245
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:30,710
Oh, I see.

246
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,750
How likely are you to get the job?

247
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,450
Well...

248
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:38,490
About ten percent?

249
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,690
What?

250
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,730
Even so. Just in case.

251
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,500
When will you know the result?

252
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:57,510
Get to work, then.
I'll pick you up in the evening.

253
00:13:58,610 --> 00:13:59,640
Okay.

254
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:12,390
Hang on.

255
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,790
Today's supposed to be D-Day.

256
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:18,000
(Contacts)

257
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,030
Ji Wan's number...

258
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
(Incoming call: Lee Ji Wan)
What?

259
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,670
Ji Wan. I was just about to call.

260
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,510
I'll do it.

261
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,740
I'll be your sister's bodyguard.

262
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,780
Thanks a lot.

263
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:37,510
I'm only taking the job
because the other one fell through.

264
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,880
Still,

265
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:42,550
you're helping me out
when you could apply somewhere else.

266
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,560
Oh, yes, that's true.

267
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:48,390
I'm willing to help you out
for two months because you asked.

268
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,230
You're my brother's best friend.

269
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,510
(Incoming call: Jung Bo A)

270
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:09,280
Lee Ji Hyuk speaking.

271
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,050
It's me.

272
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:15,990
You should introduce yourself
instead of saying, "It's me."

273
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:19,360
I heard you left Seoul.

274
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,690
Are you all right?

275
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,890
Do you expect...

276
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,500
an honest answer?

277
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,430
I'm sorry, Ji Hyuk.

278
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:33,170
You called to say that?

279
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,270
Claim compensation from my father.

280
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,350
Ask for a lot.

281
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:44,620
It won't be chump change.

282
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,550
You want me to ask for money?

283
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,920
I have nothing to give you,

284
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:52,360
and you were wronged.

285
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:54,460
You deserve it.

286
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,260
Everything you said is the truth,

287
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,330
but it feels pretty strange.

288
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,170
How much should I ask for?

289
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,970
How much will your father give me?

290
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,540
I wonder
how much he thinks I'm worth.

291
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,080
I was humiliated.

292
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,710
My parents and family
were humiliated.

293
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,390
How much is that worth?

294
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,420
If we'd gotten married,

295
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,460
half of Haneul Construction
could've been mine.

296
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,930
Can I ask for half the market value?

297
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:34,370
I'm truly sorry.

298
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:35,970
I apologize.

299
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,070
I made the choice...

300
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,740
because I thought I couldn't live
without my father's money.

301
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,440
I really was okay...

302
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,710
with marrying you, Ji Hyuk.

303
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:49,550
Jung Bo A. End it with an apology.

304
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,550
Don't say anything
to try to console me.

305
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:53,880
But...

306
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,720
I didn't know one thing.

307
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,360
That I didn't need anything...

308
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,020
once I realized where Jae Uk was.

309
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,660
Jae Uk can be a welder,

310
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,800
and I'll find something,
anything I can do.

311
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,540
I should ask for money
to make up for the happiness?

312
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:17,240
I get it.

313
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,910
I got it.

314
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,010
That's enough.

315
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,220
Go home.

316
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,850
Don't stay away for too long.

317
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,750
And...

318
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,020
I hope you recover.

319
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,800
(Reset all settings)
(Resetting)

320
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,830
(Please wait
for the process to finish.)

321
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,140
To be honest,

322
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:58,250
I thought I'd gain wings
once you died.

323
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,380
I was so sick of looking after you.

324
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,520
But...

325
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:06,920
looking after sick old you...

326
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,460
helped me save face.

327
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,900
When I had to wash
your soiled clothes...

328
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,770
and follow you
to the doctors' appointments,

329
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,600
I wondered what you'd have done
without me.

330
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,780
Now that you're dead and gone,

331
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,580
I'm of no use at all.

332
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,990
Sang Cheol has no job.

333
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:39,890
And I don't know...

334
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:42,330
if my eldest grandson
is dead or alive.

335
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:56,440
Will he pick up today?

336
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,810
(My smart older grandson)

337
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:04,210
The number you have dialed
does not exist.

338
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,020
Please check the number
and try again.

339
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,730
(Ji Hyuk, you'll come back
when it's time, right?)

340
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:18,160
Mom, can I clean up the storage?

341
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,000
I want to use it as my studio.

342
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,070
- What?
- Can I use the storage...

343
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,810
Were you thinking of Ji Hyuk?

344
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,010
Was I?

345
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,310
Mom, you must be worried.

346
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,850
Ji Hyuk changed his number.

347
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,680
People must've contacted him a lot
out of curiosity.

348
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,550
I'd have changed it too.

349
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,890
Mom, are you all right?

350
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:48,530
He said he'd come back.

351
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,600
Da Jeong, look.

352
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:56,400
It says
Ji Hyuk's number does not exist.

353
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,500
His number doesn't exist.

354
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,670
Grandma.

355
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,710
We told you not to call him.
Did you call him again?

356
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,710
People kept calling him,

357
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:05,280
so he must've wanted to avoid it.

358
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,610
You knew about that?

359
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:11,210
How could you be so calm
when you knew all that?

360
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,850
Aren't you worried?
He even changed his number.

361
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:18,360
What if Ji Hyuk doesn't come back?

362
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,720
Mother.

363
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:23,730
Ji Hyuk won't come back
until his shame goes away.

364
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,800
Only when
his embarrassment vanishes...

365
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,860
will he answer our calls
and text us back.

366
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:31,770
So you should just wait quietly
until he comes back.

367
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,400
Until when?

368
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:35,970
Until he finds the strength
to get back up again.

369
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,680
When he can walk again.

370
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,560
(Job Application Status)

371
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,130
(Applications: 30, Read: 27)

372
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:01,130
(Unread: 3)

373
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,770
(Application submitted)

374
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:06,570
Getting hired in the same industry
is already hard enough.

375
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:07,900
And you want an office job?

376
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,770
You won't even get a call
for an interview.

377
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,950
Are you a prophet or what?

378
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,090
(Ultrasonic knee pain reliever,
no delivery fee)

379
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:34,500
She wants me to ask for money?

380
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:36,400
Ask for money?

381
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,840
Money?

382
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,980
Go home.

383
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:49,210
Don't stay away for too long.

384
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:50,710
And...

385
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,950
I hope you recover.

386
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,280
Go home?

387
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:57,690
Where?

388
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:00,390
So, did you try
to marry for money...

389
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:02,460
just to raise your children
in an affluent family?

390
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:04,190
I think you want...

391
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,360
to stay single...

392
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,600
because the losses outweigh
the gains from marriage.

393
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,640
Why are we eating here?

394
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,140
Did everyone else
have dinner already?

395
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,940
Grandma doesn't want to eat,

396
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,510
and I have plans for dinner,
so I'm going out.

397
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,580
Dad doesn't like hijiki rice.

398
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:29,210
I guess Mom misses Ji Hyuk.

399
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,050
I cooked this for your dad's health.

400
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:33,220
I'm going out.

401
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,890
Doesn't the hijiki rice
remind you of Ji Hyuk?

402
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,990
What if it does?

403
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:44,460
Aren't you worried?

404
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,330
I'm not.

405
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,270
What about you, Ms. Kim Da Jeong?
How are you holding up?

406
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:55,070
Ji Hyuk has money to rely on,

407
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,540
so I'm not too worried about him.

408
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,580
Money?

409
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,510
The money.

410
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:03,850
You gave him 80,000 dollars.

411
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:05,650
You gave 100,000 dollars...

412
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,020
and got 20,000 dollars back
for clothes.

413
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:11,520
He probably went
on a trip abroad or something.

414
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,690
I'm not so worried.

415
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,960
Gosh, that brat.

416
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,300
(The day of Ji Hyuk's wedding)

417
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:25,870
He packed all his stuff
as if he'd never come back.

418
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,710
Fine. I'm sorry, Ji Hyuk.

419
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,610
I'm sorry I tried to stop you
from doing what you wanted.

420
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,950
You brat.

421
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:42,620
I hope you will lead
a happy married life.

422
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:46,460
Live happily, enjoying
what we couldn't give you...

423
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:03,410
I can't believe this brat.

424
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,710
I didn't know you were here.

425
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,620
Well... Yes.

426
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:25,700
Why are you crying?
It's a happy day.

427
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,170
I know.

428
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,200
I'm aware of that,

429
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,310
but the human heart
is really strange.

430
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:41,780
My heart aches and feels so empty.

431
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,480
I'm sad.

432
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,490
Why am I only thinking about things
I couldn't do for him?

433
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,390
I cut off his allowance...

434
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:57,330
and stopped him
from studying abroad.

435
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,730
All the things I knew
but pretended not to know.

436
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,570
That's all I can think about.

437
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,100
He's leaving the nest.

438
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:09,970
Everyone feels that way.

439
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:15,750
Come to think of it,

440
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:20,020
I'm glad
that you gave Ji Hyuk money.

441
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,450
It's a really good thing.

442
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,560
My gosh. That heartless brat.

443
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:45,740
(I'm Manager Kim Sang Hui of Hyorim.
I'm getting married.)

444
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,080
I'm home.

445
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:54,380
A bodyguard job
for Seong Jae's sister?

446
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:58,390
Yes. Seong Jae asked me desperately.

447
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,390
I'll do it only for two months.

448
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:03,490
They are looking
for a full-time driver,

449
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:06,060
but the situation is serious
because of the stalker.

450
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,030
Since they are doing...

451
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:10,500
a thorough background check,

452
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,040
it's taking some time.

453
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,040
You said you'd be her bodyguard,

454
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,010
but they're looking for a driver?

455
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:18,170
In order to protect her,

456
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:20,640
I should drive her around too.

457
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:27,550
My goodness.

458
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,250
This is huge.

459
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:37,830
I'm Lee Ji Wan.

460
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,900
Hello, Mr. Lee Ji Wan.

461
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,330
It's reassuring
that you are a PE major.

462
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:43,770
I'll try my best, sir.

463
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:47,440
We were supposed to meet you
before offering the job,

464
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,910
but we just asked you
to come to work...

465
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:50,610
since you were the younger brother
of Seong Jae's friend.

466
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:53,880
I already told him...

467
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,010
about Yeong Ra's situation
and things to take care of.

468
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,780
You did?

469
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,520
I'll keep it short, then.

470
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:01,820
Every morning
before she leaves at 9 a.m.,

471
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,590
ventilate the car
for five minutes...

472
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,620
and run the air purifier
with the windows closed...

473
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,790
for five minutes.

474
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,490
Then you can wait at the front door.

475
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:09,490
Yes, ma'am.

476
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:13,600
Be sure to walk her to the studio...

477
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,630
and confirm she locked the door
before leaving.

478
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:19,840
Of course. Seong Jae has already
filled me in on the details.

479
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:22,670
Let Yeong Ra walk ahead of you,

480
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:25,040
and escort her from a step behind.

481
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,150
Please take good care of her.
It will only be for a month or two.

482
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:32,180
I ask that
you also take good care of her.

483
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:33,820
Sure thing.

484
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,860
(Air purification system activated.)

485
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,830
Air purification system, on.

486
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,510
This is my daughter.

487
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:58,210
Right.

488
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:01,980
You should get the door for her.

489
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:03,510
Sorry?

490
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,780
Yes, of course.

491
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,960
Considering the serious situation
she's in,

492
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:21,030
stay close and open doors for her.

493
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:23,370
No one should be able
to get near her.

494
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,370
You don't need to worry.

495
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,270
I'm sure you received
her schedule via text.

496
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,110
You can't leave your post,

497
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,910
even for a bathroom break.

498
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,650
I'm telling you
to always be prepared.

499
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:47,120
I'll do so, ma'am.

500
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:59,440
Hi, I'm Lee Ji Wan.

501
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,840
Sure.

502
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,210
You should also tell me your name.

503
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:12,150
Name.

504
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:14,520
Your name.

505
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,150
I'm Park Yeong Ra.

506
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:19,120
How old are you?

507
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:22,690
- What?
- How old are you?

508
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:26,730
Do you have trouble hearing?

509
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:30,430
No, it's just that
you're addressing me casually.

510
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,500
Of course, I am.
Am I supposed to be formal with you?

511
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:37,510
I heard you were close
to my little sister's age.

512
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:43,450
I'll let you know
after asking my mom.

513
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,380
What?

514
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:48,750
You need to ask your mom
before you can tell me your age?

515
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:52,720
Why? Why do you need
your mom's permission for that?

516
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,920
That's just how it is.

517
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,290
Anyway, I'd rather
you not talk to me.

518
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,600
What?

519
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,580
This is it, right?

520
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:15,280
Hey, I even came by yesterday
to get to know the place.

521
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:16,850
Sure.

522
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,020
Oh, right.

523
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,910
By the way, you head home at 9 p.m.

524
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:52,880
Does that mean
you won't need me until then?

525
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,220
I'm supposed to wait
somewhere nearby,

526
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:58,450
but what exactly counts as "nearby?"

527
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:03,190
I'll let you know
after asking my mom.

528
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:04,190
What?

529
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:07,300
No need to bother.
I'll be within running distance,

530
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,000
so give me a call if you need me.
You have my number, don't you?

531
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:11,470
My mother gave me your number.

532
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,340
What?

533
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,680
- What a weirdo.
- What a weirdo.

534
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,460
How were we supposed to know...

535
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,690
the wall wasn't thick enough...

536
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:36,330
to swap single windows
for doubles...

537
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,730
- without reinforcing it?
- Come on.

538
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:40,160
You should've considered that...

539
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,730
before trying
to fix up the house yourself.

540
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,700
I'm only here
to install the windows.

541
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,830
Then,

542
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,370
what do we do with this?

543
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:49,710
You should quickly call someone
who can help.

544
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:51,310
I'll get going. Sorry about that.

545
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,840
Wait, sir!

546
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:56,910
What do we do?

547
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,420
What now?

548
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:04,190
Excuse me.

549
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,290
Yes?

550
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,290
If you're not going
to expand the living room,

551
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:11,260
I can reinforce the wall
with ALC blocks.

552
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,130
You can do that?

553
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,700
I'm not an expert,
so it might not be perfect,

554
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,770
but I've done it before.

555
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,910
Could you please do it?

556
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:26,610
We're moving in here
as newlyweds, you see.

557
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,810
Please, sir.

558
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:32,680
I'll see if I can get the materials.

559
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,820
Right.

560
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:42,790
Honey.

561
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:44,460
- Hey, honey.
- What a relief.

562
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,600
Thank you so much.

563
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:46,730
Once the blocks are dry,

564
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:48,360
put up the drywall
and apply the wallpaper.

565
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:50,570
For the outside wall,
paint it with elastic coating.

566
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:54,900
Could you perhaps
do that for us too?

567
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:00,710
I'm not an expert in interior design
or renovation.

568
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:05,050
Still, you know more about it
than we do.

569
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,680
We move in two weeks from now,

570
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:11,390
and the place has to be done
by then.

571
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:12,660
We're behind schedule,

572
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:15,590
and we're not sure what to do.

573
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,430
Why did you try
to fix it yourselves...

574
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:20,130
if you were this clueless?

575
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,930
We couldn't afford to hire
an interior design expert.

576
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:26,770
We read online that
many people fixed their own homes.

577
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,840
Still, I can't babysit
while you fix the place.

578
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:30,270
Then,

579
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:33,980
could you at least come
to work here every day?

580
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:35,480
You could stick around...

581
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,650
- and give her some pointers.
- Exactly.

582
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,150
That's something I can manage.

583
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:43,890
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

584
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:41,780
Lee, it really is you.

585
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,950
Ji Hyuk, what are you doing
over there?

586
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,950
Unbelievable.

587
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:49,890
Hey, Lee.

588
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:59,360
I can't believe you still
haven't pulled it together.

589
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,200
I completely understand...

590
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,200
how you're feeling.

591
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:09,540
I understand your pain.

592
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:12,040
What?

593
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,980
Up until three years ago,

594
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,350
I worked at a decent company
in Seoul.

595
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,320
After being laid off,

596
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,150
I tried everything
to get back on my feet,

597
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:24,350
but nothing seemed to go my way.

598
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,360
I bet you feel like dying.

599
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,630
But we all adapt,

600
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,330
and so will you.

601
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:42,000
What was that?

602
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:45,610
Just acknowledge
the state you're in.

603
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:49,480
Those who get back on their feet
are fewer than those who don't.

604
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:53,220
So let it all go
and accept where you are.

605
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:57,290
Once you do, you'll adapt
to this life and find peace.

606
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:05,600
You're just making things harder
for yourself.

607
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,970
Stop fighting the current
and simply give in.

608
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:14,800
I don't want to.

609
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:17,910
What was that?

610
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:23,810
No way.

611
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:25,480
My friend,

612
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:30,350
I see the fire in you
still hasn't gone out.

613
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,460
I don't want to live like this.

614
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,900
I don't want my life
to be like this.

615
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,480
No...

616
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,440
No!

617
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,660
You'll come back
when you hear from the company...

618
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,730
you applied to, won't you?

619
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:35,150
Claim compensation from my father.

620
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,690
(4 a.m., Alarm)

621
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:19,260
(Renovation Schedule)

622
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,970
Hi, there.

623
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:33,380
I'll take that.

624
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:35,410
I see you came in early.

625
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:38,950
You must have a renovation schedule.

626
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:40,180
Can I take a look at that?

627
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:44,020
Are you agreeing
to oversee the procedure?

628
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,660
I'll help you
to the best of my ability.

629
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:50,160
Don't expect the work
of an expert designer, though.

630
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,090
Right. Of course not.

631
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:54,200
Thanks a lot.

632
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,630
No need to thank me.

633
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:04,310
Seong Jae, relax.

634
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:08,740
Spring and summer
are festival seasons.

635
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,810
Instead of a T-shirt or shirt,

636
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:13,180
try styling a soft knit top
with jeans.

637
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:15,820
You can create
a cozy and soft impression.

638
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:22,530
Seong Jae, when I look at you,

639
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:24,590
you should turn to me and smile.

640
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:28,030
Right.

641
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,500
I didn't know
you were smiling at me.

642
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,000
- It's so hot today.
- Ha Eun,

643
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,300
can we call it a wrap?

644
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:37,610
Sure, we have enough footage
for these outfits.

645
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,440
Let's call it a wrap.

646
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,510
It's too hot out here,
and I'm not feeling this.

647
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:47,620
Seong Jae,
you'll be wearing a suit this time.

648
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:48,720
Go and get changed.

649
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,190
Hurry.

650
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,920
Where am I supposed
to change into this?

651
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,730
I'm sorry!

652
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:01,030
Unbelievable.

653
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:11,210
Ha Eun, not you too.

654
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,510
Lee Su Bin,

655
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,720
are you kidding me? What is this?

656
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,920
We already gave you the clothes,

657
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:24,920
so change in the car. Please?

658
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,460
Everyone can see me changing
from the outside.

659
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:31,990
No way. I won't change in the car.

660
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:38,200
What on earth am I even doing?

661
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,870
Don't you think
you're filming too close?

662
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:49,880
- Close the door.
- Sure.

663
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,250
Turn around.

664
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,320
Let's walk up to that spot
over there.

665
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:56,350
Why aren't you commenting?

666
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:57,690
She's filming us from behind.

667
00:41:57,690 --> 00:41:58,920
I can add commentary as I edit.

668
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,960
And spin!

669
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,360
Here's what you can wear...

670
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,590
to a classy exhibition
or concert date.

671
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:06,500
I suggest
this fashionable couple look...

672
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,700
when you're heading
to a show together.

673
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:14,000
Bye!

674
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,320
Seong Jae, I bet you're tired.

675
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,520
Get some rest on the bench.

676
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,520
There's something better we can do.

677
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:33,220
How about we grab some lunch
before continuing?

678
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:35,020
We've already ordered lunch,
and it'll be here soon.

679
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,190
What do you mean you ordered lunch?

680
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:38,290
Where would we go to eat
when we have all this stuff?

681
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:41,400
Over here!

682
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:43,500
- Over here.
- Over here.

683
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:46,370
Here.

684
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,740
If we were going to eat outdoors,

685
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:52,740
you should have ordered sandwiches.

686
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:55,210
Sandwiches don't fill us up,
Seong Jae.

687
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:56,550
It's enough for me.

688
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:58,680
I mean us, not you.

689
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:01,280
What?

690
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,650
We've got carbs, fritters for fat,

691
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:04,890
squid for protein,

692
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:06,620
and vegetables too.
That's a full meal.

693
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,190
We need to eat about this much...

694
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:09,730
to stay energized
through the afternoon.

695
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:11,260
Unbelievable.

696
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:13,400
Let's eat.

697
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:16,030
Ha Eun, don't we still have
three more outfits to film?

698
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:17,730
Yes, three.

699
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,600
Oh, no.

700
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:24,210
- What...
- Why do you struggle...

701
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:25,210
with chopsticks?

702
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:27,110
That's no excuse
for eating with your hands.

703
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:28,210
Who cares?

704
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:30,780
Dig in, Seong Jae.

705
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:33,950
Is it good?

706
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:35,720
Try this.

708
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:17,590
Hey.

709
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,800
I bet I startled you
by calling out of nowhere.

I told you I was working
the night shift today,

715
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:18,020
yet here you are
helping me out with this.

716
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,720
I came by to see how you were doing.

717
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,420
As if.

718
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:23,960
You came by to see
the work I have to do.

719
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,930
Are you sure you're okay doing this
with your sore back?

720
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,270
Being sore isn't a big deal,

721
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:37,770
since what upsets me every day
is the fact that I could be fired...

722
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:39,070
overnight.

723
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:46,720
Driving for a cab company
isn't easy.

724
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:47,920
The pay barely covers the bills,

725
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,550
and you have to deal
with difficult passengers...

726
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:51,390
who are impossible to please.

727
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:53,820
Don't even think
about getting into this field.

728
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:57,130
If I could go back,
I wouldn't choose this job.

729
00:45:57,130 --> 00:46:00,130
You enjoyed this job
because you love driving.

730
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:02,830
That's what I thought initially.

731
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:06,440
I love driving and enjoy traveling.

732
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:10,440
But back then, I desperately
needed money because...

733
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,510
I blew my savings when the cafe
I started after retiring failed.

734
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,610
This line of work
was the perfect option for me.

735
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:18,280
If you feel that way,
why not try something else?

736
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:20,080
Trying something new after 60?

737
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:23,250
I don't have
the confidence for that.

738
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:27,190
Come on, I have three kids myself.

739
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:30,860
My gosh.

740
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,200
I've given up
on finding an office job.

741
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:40,540
I sent my resume
to about 30 companies,

742
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:42,570
but none of them has called me
for an interview.

743
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,440
That's how it is.

744
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:46,280
So, what are you going to do?

745
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,740
I've explored my options,

746
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,150
and being a technician
seems like the best choice.

747
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:53,280
An electrician, to be more precise.

748
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,220
Not just anyone
can get certified as one.

749
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:57,650
Don't you need to major
in that field?

750
00:46:57,650 --> 00:46:58,750
Not really.

751
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,890
Once you become
an electrical technician...

752
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:02,560
and work in the field
for three years,

753
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,490
you can take the test
to become an electrical engineer.

754
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:09,700
Sang Cheol,
you've already made up your mind.

755
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:12,800
Just so you know,
getting a stable job...

756
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,600
is my top priority.

757
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,440
A job that covers
the four major insurances...

758
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:19,370
and doesn't have a retirement age.

759
00:47:19,810 --> 00:47:22,840
I can work any job as long as
the paycheck keeps coming...

760
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,610
until my kids get married.

761
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,280
By the way,
have you heard from Ji Hyuk?

762
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:32,220
Why would you mention him?

763
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:36,430
He's right, Choi Mu Sik,
you ignorant fool.

764
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:39,600
Never bring him up again.

765
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:42,500
Are you still mad at him?

766
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:43,700
Do you still not get him?

767
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:46,370
It's not that hard to understand.

768
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:48,400
The younger generation...

769
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,400
Hey.

770
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:51,910
It's easier to talk
about someone else's kids...

771
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:53,840
and be understanding, isn't it?

772
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:56,180
Come on.

773
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:58,110
Have another drink, then.

774
00:47:58,110 --> 00:47:59,280
Sure.

775
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:15,430
I keep walking

776
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:18,730
But there's no end

777
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,070
The lonely journey

778
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,680
Of a roaming man

779
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,680
In the fog

780
00:48:31,310 --> 00:48:32,550
Oh, shoot.

781
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:35,380
Darn it.

782
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:43,460
Early in the morning, I set off

783
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:50,830
Toward the last stop of a farewell

784
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,630

(Body of Man in 30s
Found in Ori Reservoir)

786
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:47,190
At 4 a.m. today, the body of a man...

787
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:49,690
in his early 30s was recovered
from Yangsu Reservoir in Ori,

788
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:51,730
and the police are looking into it.

789
00:49:51,890 --> 00:49:55,730
There were no external wounds
or any cause to suspect foul play,

790
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:58,830
and a jacket and a pair of shoes
were found by the water,

791
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:00,240
so the police suspect suicide.

792
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:02,870
He was so young.

793
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:04,910

Suspected Suicide of Man in 30s)

(New message)

795
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:12,850
Today's the day.

796
00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:16,620
Yes, that's it.

797
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:20,820
Where are you, Mr. Park?

798
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:21,990
I'm at your nine o'clock.

799
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,160
Eun Oh, go.

800
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:25,930
Someone's shooting at me.

801
00:50:25,930 --> 00:50:27,800
- Kill them.
- Shoot back.

802
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,030
- Hang on.
- Press Z.

803
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:31,000
- Hey! Oh, no!
- Which button...

804
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:33,640
- What do I do?
- Kill them. Go for the head.

805
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:36,200
I did it. I killed them.

806
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,570
Nice one!

807
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:40,140
- Hey, I did it!
- Well done.

808
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,740
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

809
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:44,650
To our first victory as a squad.

810
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,280
I was so scared
I'd die in the red zone.

811
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:51,120
Eun Oh. When did you
get so good at the game?

812
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:54,920
I'll be much better than you
in no time.

813
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:57,890
It's a bit weird...

814
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:01,000
that we are having beer
instead of coffee at the cafe...

815
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,160
without Ji Hyuk.

816
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:04,330
Yes.

817
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:06,970
It's our first time hanging out
without Ji Hyuk.

818
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,340
Have you heard from him yet?

819
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,880
I wonder what the punk is up to.

820
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:18,680
Don't you think...

821
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:21,320
he has been underground
for too long?

822
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:24,520
He changed his number
and deleted his phone messenger too.

823
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:26,460
What do you mean?

824
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:28,060
Our alumni group chat.

825
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:31,660
Everyone's saying he'd be
too embarrassed to come back,

826
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:35,000
and now I'm wondering
if Ji Hyuk will be able to...

827
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:36,870
come back at all.

828
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:40,200
What other choice does he have?

829
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:41,970
How could he come back...

830
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:45,210
when he's nothing
without his pride and ego?

831
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:47,840
Even if he were to find
another job in Seoul,

832
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,680
it's a small world,
and he'll meet people he knew.

833
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:53,420
Oh, no.

834
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:56,850
Why did I suddenly have
a scary idea?

835
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:01,820
Why would you even go there,
Su Jeong?

836
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,190
Yes.

837
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:05,690
Does he have to come back to Seoul?

838
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:08,830
He could go to Jeju Island,
Busan, or Gwangju.

839
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:10,700
He can move to any city.

840
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:12,700
Yes,

841
00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:15,740
but he disappeared
without a trace...

842
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:16,970
and changed his number.

843
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,640

in Suspected Suicide)

846
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:55,740
in Yangsu Reservoir
early this morning...

847
00:52:55,910 --> 00:52:59,280
was identified as an employee
of a nearby university.

848
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:02,680
He was identified when his family
found his suicide note...

849
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,090
at home and notified the police.

850
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:07,560
Darn it.

851
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:11,060
You're so irresponsible, Ji Hyuk.

852
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:13,160
How can you go underground
for over a month?

853
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:14,860
What a loser.

854
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:18,730
I don't care
if you're dead or alive,

855
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:20,470
but what about your parents?

856
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,540
They must be so worried.

857
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:27,280

Yes.

00:53:55,070 --> 00:53:56,840
I knew my time would come.

861
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:04,150
Why is she making so much noise?

862
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:08,920
You loser. You're so pathetic.

863
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,920
How can you stay hidden for so long?

864
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:14,320
Do you plan
on living in hiding forever?

865
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:18,430
I was such a poor judge...

866
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:20,830
of character.

867
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:06,440
It sounded like you came home late,
then went back out.

868
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,580
Yes. I threw something out.

869
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:11,650
What did you throw out
so late at night?

870
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:16,550
Oh, right. Mom.

871
00:55:17,090 --> 00:55:19,620
Shall we go to the department store
on your day off?

872
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:21,090
To get you some summer clothes.

873
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:23,730
I can spend some money
once I sign the contract today.

874
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:28,360
Are you whispering
so Gang Oh doesn't hear you?

875
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:30,330
Yes.

876
00:55:30,470 --> 00:55:32,870
He'll cling to you
as soon as he smells the money.

877
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,910
You shouldn't spoil him so much.

878
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:41,980
Keep him at the restaurant.

879
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:45,510
He wouldn't dare slack off
if Dad were around.

880
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:51,190
That's why they say it's hard
to raise a son without a dad.

881
00:55:54,490 --> 00:55:55,790
I miss Dad.

882
00:55:56,990 --> 00:55:58,160
You do too, don't you?

883
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:03,730
I still think of him all the time.

884
00:56:04,970 --> 00:56:06,070
Every day.

885
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:15,210
Is it true that
a wife loves her husband more?

886
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:20,080
I miss Dad
when something upsetting happens.

887
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:24,920
Especially
when I might lose someone.

888
00:56:27,590 --> 00:56:31,890
I miss Dad so very much then.

889
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:34,430
Get a hold of yourself...

890
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:36,030
and eat up.

891
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:38,830
You're meeting
an important client today.

892
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:41,000
Eat up.

893
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:48,580
I asked to meet you here
because I love this gallery.

894
00:56:49,410 --> 00:56:51,550
Right. I can get some references.

895
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,950
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

896
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:55,820
Some personal issues came up.

897
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,420
Did you manage to sort it out?

898
00:56:58,820 --> 00:56:59,950
In a way.

899
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:01,560
Give me the contract.

900
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:03,060
Oh, sure.

901
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:10,270
This is a written agreement
that states...

902
00:57:10,270 --> 00:57:13,330
you hired me for interior design
and paid the design fees.

903
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:16,170
I'll get you the detailed contract
once the estimate is finalized.

904
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:18,240
Okay.

905
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:20,180
(Contractor: Ji Eun Oh)

906
00:57:25,310 --> 00:57:28,480
And I came up with design ideas...

907
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,020
with four different concepts.

908
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:31,090
Here's the first one.

909
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:33,150
Since sculpture takes up
a lot of space, I left it out.

910
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:34,920
I planned the design
with metal craft,

911
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:37,030
painting, and stationery design.

912
00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:38,330
The second one...

913
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:39,660
I'll take a look later at home.

914
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:45,170
You've worked
on four different concepts already.

915
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:47,400
You must've put in a lot of effort.

916
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,570
I can't just glance at them here
and say things.

917
00:57:51,270 --> 00:57:54,480
I want to take my time
and review them carefully at home.

918
00:57:57,980 --> 00:57:58,980
Okay.

919
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:00,850
You know,

920
00:58:01,850 --> 00:58:04,120
it's still quite awkward between us.

921
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:07,490
Why don't we take a walk
and look around the local shops?

922
00:58:08,990 --> 00:58:10,530
Let's do that.

923
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:13,160
Let's go.

924
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,030
This is nice.

925
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:21,300
With a lot of young people,
the neighborhood is full of life.

926
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:22,900
I know.

927
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,440
My gosh.

928
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,040
(Twisted Donuts)

929
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,080
What's the matter?

930
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:34,550
Ms. Ji.

931
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:36,890
Can I ask you a favor?

932
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:38,850
Sure. Just tell me.

933
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:41,490
Can you buy that...

934
00:58:41,490 --> 00:58:43,660
and share it with me?

935
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:47,500
I really wanted to eat it before,
but I couldn't.

936
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:49,630
Back then, I didn't have
enough money to buy it.

937
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:56,100
But you have to eat it
on the street.

938
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:57,740
I know.

939
00:58:58,370 --> 00:59:00,310
If you eat it with me,

940
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:02,140
I won't be embarrassed.

941
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:08,420
- Here.
- Thank you.

942
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:09,780
Thank you. Enjoy it.

943
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:13,590
Here.

944
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:26,300
This is so good.
How can it be so delicious?

945
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:32,070
Oh, right.

946
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:34,080
Is it okay for you to eat this?

947
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:35,840
Don't you have a digestive issue?

948
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:38,280
No. I'm not a picky eater.

949
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:39,810
There's nothing I can't eat.

950
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:41,380
Really?

951
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:45,190
You're so skinny
that I thought you might be weak.

952
00:59:45,190 --> 00:59:47,360
No. I'm really healthy.

953
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:49,720
I've never even had a minor illness.

954
00:59:50,830 --> 00:59:51,960
Really?

955
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:54,060
I see.

956
00:59:57,570 --> 00:59:58,570
Wait.

957
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:04,870
I'm glad that you're healthy.

958
01:00:05,410 --> 01:00:07,010
I was worried...

959
01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:09,840
that a young lady like you
might be too weak...

960
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,180
to handle even my project.

961
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:14,180
Don't worry about my health.

962
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:16,320
I'm strong enough to work all night.

963
01:00:17,890 --> 01:00:19,320
Listen, Ms. Ji.

964
01:00:19,390 --> 01:00:22,890
I want my project to be
well-finished rather than rushed.

965
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:26,030
So please take your time
and work on it slowly...

966
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:27,360
while doing other projects too.

967
01:00:27,730 --> 01:00:29,260
You should be working a lot
at your age.

968
01:00:32,270 --> 01:00:34,470
Okay. I will do that.

969
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:35,640
Thank you.

970
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:39,010
Shall we walk a little more?

971
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:40,610
Yes.

972
01:00:47,550 --> 01:00:49,880
(Open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.)

973
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:51,990
I'm back.

974
01:00:51,990 --> 01:00:53,320
Why are you so late?

975
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:55,520
I said I'd have a meeting
with a client today.

976
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:57,360
- For that long?
- Yes.

977
01:00:57,430 --> 01:00:59,830
Did a meeting with a client
for interior design take that long?

978
01:00:59,830 --> 01:01:01,960
It wasn't just a meeting
with a client.

979
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:03,830
It was more like a date.

980
01:01:04,570 --> 01:01:06,600
- Is your client a man?
- No, a woman.

981
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:09,640
A date with a woman?
That sounds awkward.

982
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:11,270
Eunoism.

983
01:01:11,270 --> 01:01:13,570
Hang on. Let me check the message.

984
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:15,740
(Eunoism Notification)

985
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:18,450
I'm contacting you after seeing
the portfolio on your website.

986
01:01:18,450 --> 01:01:21,250
I'd like to request interior design
for my new apartment.

987
01:01:21,250 --> 01:01:22,950
The construction schedule is tight.

988
01:01:22,950 --> 01:01:24,690
Can you start in two weeks?

989
01:01:24,690 --> 01:01:26,250
Of course, I can!

990
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:28,560
- Eun Oh.
- Hang on.

991
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:30,930
(Yes, I can.)

992
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:35,800
Congratulations!

993
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:38,670
A 330m² project and an apartment?

994
01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:40,030
You're getting a lot of work.

995
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:41,970
A clean break with the past...

996
01:01:41,970 --> 01:01:43,840
opens the door to a new future.

997
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:45,140
I guess she's right.

998
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:46,970
I'm feeling great.

999
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:49,880
You both can get off work
at 8 p.m. today.

1000
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:51,250
I'll close up.

1001
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:52,410
- Are you serious?
- Are you serious?

1002
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:53,680
Yes.

1003
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:56,320
I can work by myself
from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m.

1004
01:01:57,790 --> 01:01:58,920
Thank you. We enjoyed it.

1005
01:01:58,920 --> 01:01:59,920
- Great.
- Thank you.

1006
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,690
Thank you. Bye.

1007
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:17,570
I'm sorry. We're closed.

1008
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:20,070
There are still ten minutes left.

1009
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:23,480
My goodness!

1010
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:29,780
I'm not a ghost.

1011
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:33,190
It's me.

1012
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:38,590
This place hasn't changed.

1013
01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:41,660
What...

1014
01:02:42,430 --> 01:02:44,030
brings you here?

1015
01:02:45,370 --> 01:02:46,370
Ji Eun Oh.

1016
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:52,110
I have something to tell you.

1017
01:03:35,950 --> 01:03:38,790
(Our Golden Days)

1018
01:03:39,090 --> 01:03:41,360
Are you asking me
why I came back or why I'm here?

1019
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:43,460
Tell me exactly
what you want to know.

1020
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:44,630
What's that?

1021
01:03:45,130 --> 01:03:46,260
It's nothing.

1022
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:47,860
You didn't tell me, honey?

1023
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:49,900
I had no idea.

1024
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:51,930
How dare you act like my boss?

1025
01:03:51,930 --> 01:03:53,330
If I had known
you were so haughty and naughty,

1026
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:55,970
I wouldn't have taken the job,
no matter how hard Seong Jae begged.

1027
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:58,640
Nothing comes
without sacrifice and effort.

1028
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,110
You know this is all for your sake.

1029
01:04:00,110 --> 01:04:02,180
I'm here to meet
my senior, Lee Ji Hyuk.

1030
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:03,510
What did you do with Ji Hyuk?

1031
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:05,350
Does he think this is his own place?

1032
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:07,380
Where did he go?

1033
01:04:07,450 --> 01:04:08,920
I'll work and sleep here.

1034
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:10,150
Sleep here?

1035
01:04:10,150 --> 01:04:11,390
Are you saying you'll live here?
