1
00:00:01,712 --> 00:00:03,012
You all know AP Group, right?

2
00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:05,112
The all-in-one interior materials company.

3
00:00:06,082 --> 00:00:08,682
That same AP Group has been put up for sale.

4
00:00:09,982 --> 00:00:11,252
And so...

5
00:00:12,952 --> 00:00:15,362
I've decided to acquire it.

6
00:00:21,432 --> 00:00:22,962
You mean AP Group?

7
00:00:25,532 --> 00:00:27,172
Wait, Mr. Lee.

8
00:00:28,172 --> 00:00:30,142
How could we possibly acquire a company that huge?

9
00:00:31,742 --> 00:00:32,742
Well...

10
00:00:33,312 --> 00:00:34,882
We'll just have to find a way.

11
00:00:36,312 --> 00:00:38,252
Mr. Jo and Cheol Min.

12
00:00:38,552 --> 00:00:39,652
Come to my office for a minute.

13
00:00:51,632 --> 00:00:53,062
Hey, Eun Oh.

14
00:00:53,862 --> 00:00:58,032
AP Group, as in the AP Group? The major interior materials firm.

15
00:00:59,002 --> 00:01:00,602
Yes, that's the one.

16
00:01:01,742 --> 00:01:05,612
Isn't that like a corner store owner trying to buy a department store?

17
00:01:07,642 --> 00:01:09,812
We did get the investment for the showroom,

18
00:01:10,142 --> 00:01:13,682
- so we're a local grocer then? - Anyway.

19
00:01:15,422 --> 00:01:19,122
Man, Ji Hyuk is all about money, you know?

20
00:01:19,192 --> 00:01:21,322
That whole thing with his marriage to Haneul Construction's daughter.

21
00:01:23,162 --> 00:01:24,562
That could be it.

22
00:01:25,462 --> 00:01:28,262
This is what sets a house apart. Didn't you say the details matter?

23
00:01:29,162 --> 00:01:33,672
My team would be thrilled to learn windows like these exist.

24
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:35,442
You're awfully talkative today.

25
00:01:35,602 --> 00:01:38,272
I know, right? But things just keep coming to mind.

26
00:01:38,372 --> 00:01:39,712
This is what I enjoy.

27
00:01:42,212 --> 00:01:43,212
Or maybe...

28
00:01:44,412 --> 00:01:46,752
Maybe he's just doing it because he enjoys it.

29
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:51,252
Seriously? He thinks acquiring AP Group is fun?

30
00:01:51,322 --> 00:01:52,522
I'm honestly terrified.

31
00:01:53,122 --> 00:01:56,822
Honestly, I was shocked back when he talked about the showroom.

32
00:01:58,022 --> 00:01:59,292
But he pulled it off, didn't he?

33
00:01:59,632 --> 00:02:00,662
He secured the investment, didn't he?

34
00:02:02,662 --> 00:02:03,702
You've got a point there.

35
00:02:06,072 --> 00:02:07,072
Maybe...

36
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:11,042
he's one of those people who genuinely find business fun.

37
00:02:12,372 --> 00:02:14,772
(Shoealls)

38
00:02:14,842 --> 00:02:15,882
(Chief Director Park Seong Jae)

39
00:02:15,942 --> 00:02:19,112
Sir. Here's the prototype shortlist.

40
00:02:19,812 --> 00:02:20,812
Okay, thank you.

41
00:02:23,152 --> 00:02:24,182
You've got company.

42
00:02:31,122 --> 00:02:32,892
You want to acquire AP Group?

43
00:02:33,232 --> 00:02:34,262
Are you out of your mind?

44
00:02:35,902 --> 00:02:38,572
This was my planned next step after the showroom.

45
00:02:38,772 --> 00:02:41,102
A company that produces a full line of interior products.

46
00:02:45,572 --> 00:02:47,972
If you want out, I'll let you out of the contract.

47
00:02:48,282 --> 00:02:49,342
I'll give you your money back, too.

48
00:02:50,082 --> 00:02:52,752
Ji Hyuk, you feel bad about this, don't you?

49
00:02:59,422 --> 00:03:02,992
You'd return three million dollars? When you need every penny?

50
00:03:03,522 --> 00:03:06,632
You invested in the showroom, and I'm abandoning that plan...

51
00:03:06,692 --> 00:03:08,502
to acquire AP Group instead.

52
00:03:09,462 --> 00:03:10,802
Think it over and let me know.

53
00:03:11,532 --> 00:03:13,672
Why? Are you planning to write another proposal?

54
00:03:14,902 --> 00:03:16,742
- You monster. - What?

55
00:03:16,802 --> 00:03:19,712
Look at your eyes right now. They're sparkling.

56
00:03:20,272 --> 00:03:21,572
You're excited about this one too, aren't you?

57
00:03:22,182 --> 00:03:24,812
What's there to be excited about? We haven't even started.

58
00:03:26,282 --> 00:03:27,852
Found an advisory firm yet?

59
00:03:28,382 --> 00:03:29,522
I'm reaching out to some.

60
00:03:31,692 --> 00:03:33,592
Let me make an introduction.

61
00:03:34,452 --> 00:03:38,462
Though Mamdaerozip has grown quickly and secured second-round funding,

62
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:42,632
if you try to acquire AP Group with the capital you have now,

63
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,032
no one in the industry will touch it.

64
00:03:45,732 --> 00:03:47,502
You know as well as I do that it's a reckless move.

65
00:03:48,442 --> 00:03:50,202
Fine, make the introduction. You're right.

66
00:03:50,902 --> 00:03:53,312
- Okay, I'll tell you right away. - Okay, thanks.

67
00:03:57,042 --> 00:03:58,651
Go and claim Eun Oh right now.

68
00:03:58,652 --> 00:04:00,212
And make sure I don't get the chance.

69
00:04:01,582 --> 00:04:02,582
Ji Hyuk.

70
00:04:07,422 --> 00:04:09,862
I need some more time.

71
00:04:11,932 --> 00:04:14,692
If I don't tell Eun Oh how I feel right away,

72
00:04:15,532 --> 00:04:16,702
are you going to tell her how you feel?

73
00:04:19,002 --> 00:04:20,002
I'm not sure.

74
00:04:23,742 --> 00:04:24,772
I might.

75
00:04:27,842 --> 00:04:29,012
She'll probably turn you down.

76
00:04:30,512 --> 00:04:31,782
If I can't hold it in anymore,

77
00:04:33,052 --> 00:04:34,182
I guess I'll have to say something.

78
00:04:34,582 --> 00:04:36,352
I thought you were busy trying to acquire AP Group.

79
00:04:36,622 --> 00:04:37,722
Do you really have time for this?

80
00:04:38,892 --> 00:04:41,222
For now, I'm going to work on the acquisition.

81
00:04:55,272 --> 00:04:58,472
Okay, Chief. Today, we're removing the kitchen, ceiling,

82
00:04:58,542 --> 00:04:59,872
and flooring...

83
00:04:59,942 --> 00:05:03,382
And we'll cut the exterior door to the rental unit!

84
00:05:04,712 --> 00:05:07,412
- You can get started. - All right, let's get to it.

85
00:05:07,482 --> 00:05:09,382
- Right. - Let's start over there.

86
00:05:10,652 --> 00:05:12,892
- Ms. Ji. - One, two!

87
00:05:13,322 --> 00:05:15,722
All right, careful now. Over that way.

88
00:05:17,822 --> 00:05:18,832
My gosh.

89
00:05:19,432 --> 00:05:21,632
Ma'am. What brings you here so early?

90
00:05:21,832 --> 00:05:24,832
Meet my sister and nephew. They were on their way to work...

91
00:05:24,902 --> 00:05:26,932
and wanted to see the place one last time.

92
00:05:27,232 --> 00:05:28,372
I see.

93
00:05:28,802 --> 00:05:30,672
- Hello. - Hello.

94
00:05:30,972 --> 00:05:33,542
This is my aunt's house. I used to visit a lot as a kid.

95
00:05:33,912 --> 00:05:36,842
I was sad to hear it was changing, so I came for a look.

96
00:05:37,442 --> 00:05:40,982
I know the feeling. After I left my longtime home,

97
00:05:41,182 --> 00:05:42,782
I went back to visit a few times by myself.

98
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:47,422
It's just sad to think this is the last time.

99
00:05:47,692 --> 00:05:50,962
I actually took some pictures. Should I send them to you?

100
00:05:51,992 --> 00:05:53,592
You took pictures?

101
00:05:53,762 --> 00:05:55,932
Yes. Just in case,

102
00:05:56,032 --> 00:05:57,962
I came by yesterday and took a bunch.

103
00:05:58,472 --> 00:06:01,232
See? She's so young,

104
00:06:01,372 --> 00:06:03,242
but she's incredibly thoughtful.

105
00:06:09,212 --> 00:06:10,212
It's me.

106
00:06:25,162 --> 00:06:27,592
Salad for lunch, or something else?

107
00:06:27,862 --> 00:06:30,402
Why do you keep asking every day? You know the answer.

108
00:06:30,532 --> 00:06:33,672
You could be getting married any day now.

109
00:06:34,032 --> 00:06:35,701
Shouldn't you be watching your weight?

110
00:06:35,702 --> 00:06:36,742
You said you gained a kilo.

111
00:06:36,802 --> 00:06:38,272
I'm not having salad.

112
00:06:38,842 --> 00:06:40,142
Then what are you having?

113
00:06:43,312 --> 00:06:44,312
Ji Wan.

114
00:06:44,582 --> 00:06:48,652
Why are you so mad that I'm marrying up?

115
00:06:49,222 --> 00:06:50,282
Why should you care?

116
00:06:50,522 --> 00:06:55,122
I'm not mad. I feel bad for you. Can't you see?

117
00:06:55,662 --> 00:07:00,092
Fine, whatever. Forget it. Go live like a princess in a tower.

118
00:07:00,292 --> 00:07:01,832
I'm done caring.

119
00:07:02,402 --> 00:07:04,102
Just finish the webtoon before you get married.

120
00:07:10,202 --> 00:07:11,472
Why are you looking at me like that?

121
00:07:11,942 --> 00:07:16,042
Is that too much to ask? I've been helping you with the plot.

122
00:07:16,312 --> 00:07:18,882
The least you can do is let me see how it ends.

123
00:07:19,612 --> 00:07:20,852
Don't you have any loyalty?

124
00:07:23,252 --> 00:07:24,352
Lee Sang Hoon...

125
00:07:24,682 --> 00:07:28,052
He's on a business trip overseas. He'll be back in two weeks.

126
00:07:29,292 --> 00:07:32,062
- So? - You said it might be nice...

127
00:07:32,492 --> 00:07:35,362
if Dokgo Chan and Ko So Ri crossed paths once by chance...

128
00:07:35,432 --> 00:07:37,262
before the zombie incident.

129
00:07:38,032 --> 00:07:41,202
Something about spilling ramyeon by the Han River?

130
00:07:42,172 --> 00:07:43,172
Yes.

131
00:07:45,412 --> 00:07:47,712
But I've never actually seen someone...

132
00:07:48,012 --> 00:07:51,342
- make one of those ramyeon there. - As if that's the only thing.

133
00:07:51,912 --> 00:07:53,412
Let's go! To the Han River.

134
00:07:57,182 --> 00:07:58,792
(Park Yeong Ra, Yeong Ra's Car)

135
00:08:03,492 --> 00:08:04,562
Director Ko.

136
00:08:13,072 --> 00:08:14,272
You've been waiting.

137
00:08:14,472 --> 00:08:18,442
Of course. The one who asked you out should arrive first.

138
00:08:19,442 --> 00:08:21,472
I looked up a few restaurants nearby.

139
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:24,042
You said we could take two hours for lunch, right?

140
00:08:24,982 --> 00:08:26,512
And it's such a beautiful day.

141
00:08:32,122 --> 00:08:33,852
This thing really boils it?

142
00:08:33,992 --> 00:08:36,592
That's right. Get a shot when it starts to boil.

143
00:08:36,822 --> 00:08:38,162
Get the scenery, too.

144
00:08:38,522 --> 00:08:40,032
Here, let me do it.

145
00:08:40,592 --> 00:08:41,592
Okay.

146
00:08:43,132 --> 00:08:44,562
Let's see...

147
00:08:46,572 --> 00:08:47,572
Oh, my.

148
00:08:48,432 --> 00:08:49,442
My gosh!

149
00:08:50,772 --> 00:08:52,472
It's boiling! Ji Wan!

150
00:08:52,942 --> 00:08:53,942
It's boiling.

151
00:08:55,382 --> 00:08:56,382
Wow.

152
00:08:58,582 --> 00:08:59,782
Oh, my.

153
00:09:00,252 --> 00:09:02,622
It's really boiling! It's actually boiling.

154
00:09:11,562 --> 00:09:14,032
This is really good, Ji Wan.

155
00:09:14,292 --> 00:09:16,602
Everything tastes better when you eat it outside.

156
00:09:16,662 --> 00:09:19,732
That's just how it is. It's why people go on picnics...

157
00:09:19,802 --> 00:09:23,272
- and camping. - That makes sense.

158
00:09:23,542 --> 00:09:25,842
Hurry and eat up. We've got to go ride those bikes.

159
00:09:26,742 --> 00:09:28,512
Should I add bike-riding to the episode?

160
00:09:28,572 --> 00:09:31,712
No. Since you could be married off soon,

161
00:09:31,782 --> 00:09:32,782
I figured while we're out,

162
00:09:33,052 --> 00:09:35,252
I'd show you a little more of what the world has to offer.

163
00:09:37,782 --> 00:09:38,952
You poor thing.

164
00:09:55,842 --> 00:09:57,572
Hey, what are you doing?

165
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,072
What are you, a glutton for punishment?

166
00:10:00,442 --> 00:10:01,442
Don't your legs hurt?

167
00:10:01,812 --> 00:10:02,842
They do.

168
00:10:03,482 --> 00:10:04,812
They do, but...

169
00:10:07,352 --> 00:10:08,382
It's fun.

170
00:10:08,952 --> 00:10:12,122
- Your calves are going to be sore. - What?

171
00:10:14,492 --> 00:10:15,492
Hang on...

172
00:10:15,962 --> 00:10:17,291
- Here, Yeong Ra. - What?

173
00:10:17,292 --> 00:10:20,132
Let's switch seats. Up front, you'll get a great view,

174
00:10:20,192 --> 00:10:21,262
so you'll see everything much better.

175
00:10:21,892 --> 00:10:22,902
You think so?

176
00:10:25,502 --> 00:10:29,372
This is my first time on a bike, but with you, I'm not scared at all.

177
00:10:30,142 --> 00:10:34,172
Don't pedal. Just enjoy the scenery. I'll take care of the pedals.

178
00:10:34,442 --> 00:10:36,682
- Okay. - Be careful.

179
00:10:39,112 --> 00:10:40,112
Let's go.

180
00:10:40,382 --> 00:10:41,452
Here we go!

181
00:10:48,292 --> 00:10:49,322
Oh, my!

182
00:10:49,822 --> 00:10:52,492
I've never seen a homemade lunch like this.

183
00:10:54,292 --> 00:10:58,332
I felt so bad, and I had to find a way to show you.

184
00:10:58,832 --> 00:11:00,932
So I made you this lunch.

185
00:11:01,602 --> 00:11:05,572
When you make something by hand, you put your heart into it.

186
00:11:06,812 --> 00:11:09,012
You made all of this yourself?

187
00:11:11,142 --> 00:11:14,412
Director Ko, you didn't have to do all this.

188
00:11:15,082 --> 00:11:18,022
I told you my story too, remember?

189
00:11:18,682 --> 00:11:20,992
But I'm the older one here.

190
00:11:22,022 --> 00:11:23,022
Here...

191
00:11:24,162 --> 00:11:25,192
Have a bite.

192
00:11:31,002 --> 00:11:32,432
This one's my favorite.

193
00:11:33,832 --> 00:11:35,332
I love shrimp fritters, too.

194
00:11:59,192 --> 00:12:00,292
Is something wrong?

195
00:12:01,232 --> 00:12:02,232
No, it's just...

196
00:12:02,732 --> 00:12:04,062
The scent...

197
00:12:06,432 --> 00:12:07,602
Just a moment.

198
00:12:12,512 --> 00:12:15,442
(Park Yeong Ra, Studio)

199
00:12:21,352 --> 00:12:24,482
- How is it? - It's delicious.

200
00:12:25,622 --> 00:12:26,692
Please, eat up.

201
00:13:20,042 --> 00:13:21,272
You know, Eun Oh...

202
00:13:21,942 --> 00:13:24,012
I was just thinking about something.

203
00:13:26,082 --> 00:13:28,382
We may feel like friends,

204
00:13:28,782 --> 00:13:31,182
but you're young enough to be my daughter.

205
00:13:31,582 --> 00:13:35,962
I wonder why I told you a secret I've never told anyone. And twice.

206
00:13:36,962 --> 00:13:40,332
I mentioned why before.

207
00:13:40,732 --> 00:13:41,732
Anyway,

208
00:13:42,032 --> 00:13:43,362
I have no idea why today...

209
00:13:43,832 --> 00:13:46,772
I just bared my soul about my past.

210
00:13:46,872 --> 00:13:50,742
That's because I'm not involved with anyone in your life.

211
00:13:51,172 --> 00:13:52,172
After all,

212
00:13:52,742 --> 00:13:55,642
I told you all about my brother, didn't I?

213
00:13:57,142 --> 00:13:58,282
That's right.

214
00:13:58,642 --> 00:14:01,782
You were the one who first told me about being adopted.

215
00:14:04,522 --> 00:14:06,852
That must have been a secret you were hiding.

216
00:14:08,552 --> 00:14:11,192
I wasn't actively trying to hide it.

217
00:14:13,192 --> 00:14:15,732
The fact is, my birth parents abandoned me,

218
00:14:16,262 --> 00:14:18,062
and the mom and dad who raised me...

219
00:14:18,362 --> 00:14:20,472
were my real parents.

220
00:14:21,032 --> 00:14:23,872
So there was never any reason to mention it.

221
00:14:25,142 --> 00:14:26,142
Really?

222
00:14:27,612 --> 00:14:30,682
I'm telling you. I grew up surrounded by love.

223
00:14:31,382 --> 00:14:32,882
But still,

224
00:14:33,152 --> 00:14:35,752
you must have thought about your birth parents.

225
00:14:36,182 --> 00:14:39,592
Didn't you ever miss them or wonder about them?

226
00:14:40,292 --> 00:14:43,792
Whatever the reason, they still abandoned me.

227
00:14:44,892 --> 00:14:47,192
What's there to be curious about?

228
00:14:47,832 --> 00:14:49,032
Listen to you.

229
00:14:51,062 --> 00:14:52,672
What if they didn't abandon you,

230
00:14:53,102 --> 00:14:54,832
but lost you instead?

231
00:14:58,202 --> 00:15:01,772
But I was told they left me at an orphanage.

232
00:15:03,082 --> 00:15:06,752
On TV shows and posters,

233
00:15:07,012 --> 00:15:09,752
kids get lost on the street, at markets, or in neighborhoods,

234
00:15:09,822 --> 00:15:12,222
and there are so many cases where they're never found.

235
00:15:13,092 --> 00:15:16,522
There are stories about parents searching orphanages nationwide.

236
00:15:20,892 --> 00:15:21,892
Right.

237
00:15:25,232 --> 00:15:26,902
Even someone like me...

238
00:15:28,202 --> 00:15:33,072
I registered my DNA with the police, just in case.

239
00:15:34,742 --> 00:15:36,382
Even though she's dead?

240
00:15:39,382 --> 00:15:40,882
She must be dead by now.

241
00:15:43,922 --> 00:15:45,722
You never know.

242
00:15:46,392 --> 00:15:49,492
Someone could have taken her before the fire.

243
00:16:00,202 --> 00:16:02,872
This is something I'll probably never be able...

244
00:16:06,072 --> 00:16:07,512
to give up on until the day I die.

245
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:12,042
That's how mothers are.

246
00:16:17,282 --> 00:16:18,622
So, a mother...

247
00:16:19,122 --> 00:16:20,522
is like that.

248
00:16:26,762 --> 00:16:28,231
He was my senior in the MBA program.

249
00:16:28,232 --> 00:16:30,632
Now, he's a partner at an M and A firm.

250
00:16:30,702 --> 00:16:32,631

Lee Ji Hyuk.

252
00:16:34,072 --> 00:16:36,942
This is Manager Hong Won Jun, handling the project's operations.

253
00:16:37,472 --> 00:16:39,872
And Attorney Choi Jong Gu, our legal counsel.

254
00:16:41,512 --> 00:16:44,642
My goal was to reach AP Group's position in the industry.

255
00:16:44,912 --> 00:16:47,952
Why take ten years to get somewhere you can reach in one?

256
00:16:49,222 --> 00:16:52,252
- So you're set on acquiring it. - The problem is,

257
00:16:52,822 --> 00:16:54,952
it comes down to the numbers.

258
00:16:55,922 --> 00:17:00,062
Your funds are nowhere near enough to meet AP's asking price.

(Your application has been submitted.)

263
00:17:25,952 --> 00:17:30,422
That's odd. He's never even a minute late.

264
00:17:47,842 --> 00:17:50,882
Yes. This is Kim Jang Su.

265
00:17:51,442 --> 00:17:52,982
You sound like you've caught a cold.

266
00:17:54,582 --> 00:17:56,352
Sounds like a nasty one.

267
00:17:58,252 --> 00:18:01,952
I was in so much pain, I didn't even think to call.

268
00:18:03,062 --> 00:18:07,132
If you're that sick, you should've called your daughter.

269
00:18:07,432 --> 00:18:09,302
Goodness, no.

270
00:18:09,602 --> 00:18:13,072
Don't you dare tell Da Jeong!

271
00:18:16,102 --> 00:18:17,472
Fine.

272
00:18:18,542 --> 00:18:21,112
Yes, I heard you. I'm hanging up now.

273
00:18:26,552 --> 00:18:28,812
Ok Rye, what are you doing here?

274
00:18:29,452 --> 00:18:33,452
I brought you medicine and a tonic. You haven't eaten, have you?

275
00:18:34,692 --> 00:18:37,492
Forget it. Just give me the medicine.

276
00:18:38,692 --> 00:18:40,392
We just agreed to be friends.

277
00:18:40,692 --> 00:18:44,362
What kind of friend would I be if I let you take it without eating?

278
00:18:44,432 --> 00:18:46,002
For goodness' sake.

279
00:18:54,072 --> 00:18:56,412
Things are so convenient these days.

(Seaweed Soup)

281
00:19:05,682 --> 00:19:06,792
Here, eat up.

282
00:19:10,622 --> 00:19:15,562
I didn't ask you to keep it from her so you would do all this.

283
00:19:17,232 --> 00:19:21,102
Jang Su, your daughter can't visit even if you call.

284
00:19:21,972 --> 00:19:25,502
Mother, my father can never find out...

285
00:19:25,572 --> 00:19:26,742
that I'm working.

286
00:19:28,842 --> 00:19:31,642
It's because I'm hiding something, too.

287
00:19:31,982 --> 00:19:36,322
Now, hurry and eat. You need to eat before your medicine.

288
00:19:41,892 --> 00:19:46,262
If I were just five years younger, I'd have made you a better meal.

289
00:19:46,532 --> 00:19:48,062
But I was in such a rush.

290
00:19:48,762 --> 00:19:52,262
Still, this is very nutritious.

291
00:19:53,602 --> 00:19:56,902
It's delicious. The ingredients must be high-quality.

292
00:19:58,342 --> 00:20:00,212
There's another one in the fridge.

293
00:20:07,182 --> 00:20:08,612
Lying here all alone,

294
00:20:09,182 --> 00:20:10,822
what were you thinking?

295
00:20:12,922 --> 00:20:14,992
You must have been so lonely.

296
00:20:16,862 --> 00:20:20,462
I have a son, a daughter-in-law, grandsons, and a granddaughter,

297
00:20:20,562 --> 00:20:22,292
all living together.

298
00:20:23,462 --> 00:20:25,232
I am so sorry.

299
00:20:26,702 --> 00:20:30,772
I miss my grandkids in the US so much.

300
00:20:32,102 --> 00:20:34,312
I was lying here sick all alone,

301
00:20:35,012 --> 00:20:36,542
and I thought,

302
00:20:36,612 --> 00:20:40,252
"Will I die without ever seeing my son and grandkids again?"

303
00:20:41,712 --> 00:20:44,982
"Was that my fate?"

304
00:20:58,332 --> 00:21:01,072
- Here you are. Enjoy. - Thank you.

305
00:21:01,132 --> 00:21:03,102
Da Jeong, this is for table 12.

306
00:21:03,302 --> 00:21:05,072
- Smoked duck? - Yes, let's get the smoked duck.

307
00:21:05,172 --> 00:21:06,172
- The smoked duck? - Yes.

308
00:21:09,042 --> 00:21:10,882
My gosh, I'm so sorry.

309
00:21:10,942 --> 00:21:13,052
Mr. Jung, you have to watch where you're going.

310
00:21:13,112 --> 00:21:14,412
- Goodness. - Oh, no! Da Jeong!

311
00:21:14,712 --> 00:21:16,681
- Oh, this is terrible. My goodness. - What have I done?

312
00:21:16,682 --> 00:21:18,022
Are you okay, Da Jeong?

313
00:21:19,822 --> 00:21:23,362
It's a mild second-degree burn and won't leave a scar,

314
00:21:23,462 --> 00:21:24,992
so that's a huge relief.

315
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:28,162
It's okay. I know you didn't do it on purpose.

316
00:21:28,262 --> 00:21:31,132
You acted like you owned the place, saying you were a regular.

317
00:21:31,202 --> 00:21:34,602
I feel terrible you can't work now, all because of me.

318
00:21:35,332 --> 00:21:39,612
Mr. Shin. Didn't you say you were hiring?

319
00:21:39,672 --> 00:21:40,672
Yes.

320
00:21:44,042 --> 00:21:47,782
Thanks to you, I met the advisors. The meeting went great.

321
00:21:48,912 --> 00:21:51,752
Yes, Sung Guk already told me, you punk.

322
00:21:53,322 --> 00:21:56,722
At this rate, Ji Hyuk might actually take over AP Group.

324
00:22:01,992 --> 00:22:05,232
Director, what should I do? Su Bin says she won't quit...

325
00:22:05,302 --> 00:22:08,132
until she's perfectly trained her replacement.

326
00:22:09,472 --> 00:22:12,302
Su Bin... What is with her insane sense of responsibility?

327
00:22:13,412 --> 00:22:15,542
After she said she was going all in on her channel.

328
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,222
These clothes I bought...

329
00:22:23,552 --> 00:22:24,852
Don't they look so similar?

330
00:22:27,452 --> 00:22:29,092
Her subscriber count has really shot up.

331
00:22:29,622 --> 00:22:32,222
- What is all this? - Grandma, no! Don't get too close!

332
00:22:34,592 --> 00:22:35,592
Go ahead and pick some out.

333
00:22:35,792 --> 00:22:39,402
No, just bring me the three lightest pairs you have.

334
00:22:39,472 --> 00:22:42,102
- In size 240mm. - Please have a seat.

335
00:22:59,522 --> 00:23:02,722
- Please try these on. - Those are the wrong ones.

336
00:23:09,392 --> 00:23:10,402
These feel heavy.

337
00:23:11,302 --> 00:23:12,802
That can't be right.

338
00:23:13,172 --> 00:23:16,442
- These are our lightest models. - Min Ji?

339
00:23:16,842 --> 00:23:18,572
Excuse me, ma'am. One moment.

340
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:23,442
Min Ji.

341
00:23:24,082 --> 00:23:25,482
You know those two aren't the right ones.

342
00:23:28,882 --> 00:23:30,452
Whatever, they're all pretty much the same.

343
00:23:31,622 --> 00:23:32,922
What do you mean "they're all pretty much the same?"

344
00:23:33,352 --> 00:23:36,762
I gave you the file listing it all. Product, color, features, weight...

345
00:23:37,522 --> 00:23:38,622
Why haven't you memorized it?

346
00:23:38,992 --> 00:23:42,032
And I told you to first ask what they'll be using them for.

347
00:23:42,292 --> 00:23:44,202
You can't just say, "Have a look. They're all lightweight."

348
00:23:44,602 --> 00:23:45,602
Why are you being like this?

349
00:23:45,902 --> 00:23:48,072
Didn't you say you completed the company's basic training?

350
00:23:48,272 --> 00:23:50,202
Yes, I guess so.

351
00:23:54,312 --> 00:23:55,372
Excuse me.

352
00:23:57,112 --> 00:23:59,812
Ma'am, are you looking for shoes for everyday wear?

353
00:24:00,082 --> 00:24:02,052
Yes, something light and comfortable.

354
00:24:02,182 --> 00:24:04,652
Okay, and may I ask what you'll be using them for?

355
00:24:04,722 --> 00:24:06,352
Oh... Thank you.

356
00:24:06,522 --> 00:24:07,792
Thank you.

357
00:24:22,232 --> 00:24:23,242
Hey.

358
00:24:26,542 --> 00:24:27,542
Get over here.

359
00:24:35,612 --> 00:24:36,622
"Get over here?"

360
00:24:37,582 --> 00:24:38,982
You've got to be kidding me.

361
00:24:39,752 --> 00:24:41,792
Are you that desperate to become a full-time employee?

362
00:24:42,192 --> 00:24:44,662
What, you think they'll give you a special offer if you do that?

363
00:24:45,562 --> 00:24:47,431
- What? - You're a part-timer,

364
00:24:47,432 --> 00:24:49,462
so don't lecture a full-timer.

365
00:24:50,032 --> 00:24:54,172
- Just mind your own business. - If you don't want my lectures,

366
00:24:54,602 --> 00:24:56,132
then act like a full-time employee.

367
00:24:56,472 --> 00:24:57,972
Show some responsibility.

368
00:24:58,372 --> 00:24:59,612
And stop slacking off.

369
00:25:00,172 --> 00:25:01,642
Believe me, I'd love to be out of here already.

370
00:25:02,312 --> 00:25:04,512
But I can't, because you're completely useless.

371
00:25:05,182 --> 00:25:06,952
What? "Useless?"

372
00:25:08,312 --> 00:25:10,151
First, dust the shoes on display.

373
00:25:10,152 --> 00:25:12,992
And stop tossing the shoes customers tried on.

374
00:25:13,122 --> 00:25:16,022
Place them at the correct angle. You can't even get that right.

375
00:25:16,092 --> 00:25:17,362
Because you're useless!

376
00:25:17,692 --> 00:25:18,722
Why you little...

377
00:25:22,132 --> 00:25:24,262
- You little what? - What?

378
00:25:26,832 --> 00:25:27,832
What?

379
00:25:32,442 --> 00:25:33,442
You're really asking for it.

380
00:25:33,512 --> 00:25:37,212
Kim Min Ji! What are you doing? Hey, stop it!

381
00:25:37,282 --> 00:25:40,082
- Hold on. Stop it. Stop! - No, she started it.

382
00:25:40,682 --> 00:25:41,682
She started it!

383
00:25:42,412 --> 00:25:43,422
Let me go. What are you doing?

384
00:25:43,722 --> 00:25:44,722
Gosh, seriously!

385
00:25:44,852 --> 00:25:45,852
(Shoealls)

386
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:49,662
Su Bin. What on earth just happened?

387
00:25:51,522 --> 00:25:52,522
What?

388
00:25:54,692 --> 00:25:55,762
Let me see.

389
00:26:09,012 --> 00:26:10,112
You've got a scratch.

390
00:26:12,412 --> 00:26:13,412
Hey, you!

391
00:26:13,482 --> 00:26:15,181
Stop! Are you crazy?

392
00:26:15,182 --> 00:26:16,822
You're the chief director of the company.

393
00:26:20,222 --> 00:26:21,422
I'll handle her.

394
00:26:27,532 --> 00:26:28,532
Let's go.

395
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:49,552
My goodness.

396
00:26:57,392 --> 00:26:58,692
Thankfully, it won't leave a scar.

397
00:27:00,032 --> 00:27:01,432
That girl has such long nails.

398
00:27:02,692 --> 00:27:03,702
Hey, Lee Su Bin.

399
00:27:04,232 --> 00:27:05,661
Why did you just stand there?

400
00:27:05,662 --> 00:27:06,672
She grabbed your hair, and you froze.

401
00:27:07,232 --> 00:27:08,232
Are you a fool?

402
00:27:08,832 --> 00:27:11,102
What if I fought back, and she got hurt?

403
00:27:11,502 --> 00:27:13,712
If people found out you got me this job,

404
00:27:14,142 --> 00:27:15,472
you'd be in a really tough spot.

405
00:27:17,182 --> 00:27:18,482
So you just stood there and took it?

406
00:27:18,982 --> 00:27:19,982
Because of me?

407
00:27:20,482 --> 00:27:21,482
Yes.

408
00:27:31,592 --> 00:27:33,962
Hey, that's why I told you to quit the moment your replacement arrived.

409
00:27:39,972 --> 00:27:41,702
It was the least I could do to repay the favor.

410
00:27:42,032 --> 00:27:45,642
You got me the business cards and even let me work at the store.

411
00:27:46,102 --> 00:27:47,342
And the store manager helped me out, too.

412
00:27:47,712 --> 00:27:50,212
That's why I wanted to train the new hire properly.

413
00:27:55,212 --> 00:27:56,852
I can't exactly say you did the right thing,

414
00:27:57,152 --> 00:27:58,352
but I can't exactly thank you either.

415
00:27:59,382 --> 00:28:00,652
You're so unpredictable, Lee Su Bin.

416
00:28:05,762 --> 00:28:06,762
Let me see.

417
00:28:12,562 --> 00:28:13,572
Are you okay?

418
00:28:15,472 --> 00:28:16,472
Yes.

419
00:28:28,082 --> 00:28:29,612
My gosh, you must be out of your mind!

420
00:28:31,482 --> 00:28:33,492
The broth in those pots is scalding hot!

421
00:28:35,292 --> 00:28:37,222
Your husband is going to flip out when he finds out.

422
00:28:37,992 --> 00:28:41,692
That's why I'm showing you now, so he and the kids won't know.

423
00:28:42,132 --> 00:28:44,862
See? You can't even tell as long as my sleeves are down.

424
00:28:45,062 --> 00:28:48,672
Goodness, do you just have secrets to hide everywhere?

425
00:28:50,842 --> 00:28:53,772
How did you end up having to work at a restaurant?

426
00:28:54,372 --> 00:28:56,582
It's normal for both parents to work these days.

427
00:28:57,142 --> 00:28:58,782
Especially after retirement.

428
00:29:00,152 --> 00:29:01,952
It's not like I only ever took care of your family.

429
00:29:02,712 --> 00:29:06,122
My mother had dementia for 15 years and a stroke, as you know.

430
00:29:07,452 --> 00:29:08,452
What about your sister?

431
00:29:09,252 --> 00:29:10,992
Is she living well in the US?

432
00:29:12,662 --> 00:29:14,262
How long has it been since she last visited Korea?

433
00:29:16,192 --> 00:29:17,202
Five years.

434
00:29:18,562 --> 00:29:20,032
Has it really been five years already?

435
00:29:22,002 --> 00:29:23,802
Her kids must have grown up a lot.

436
00:29:25,372 --> 00:29:26,942
They're in 9th grade and 10th grade.

437
00:29:28,042 --> 00:29:30,342
But why the sudden questions about my sister?

438
00:29:30,912 --> 00:29:33,312
No reason. I just thought of her.

439
00:29:34,912 --> 00:29:38,522
I figured your father must miss her terribly.

440
00:29:40,422 --> 00:29:41,422
Yes, I'm sure.

441
00:29:43,662 --> 00:29:46,632
Listen, dear. I'll take care of the soup and things,

442
00:29:46,732 --> 00:29:48,892
so you just set the table.

443
00:29:49,862 --> 00:29:52,002
Okay, I'll take you up on that for a few days. Thank you.

444
00:30:03,682 --> 00:30:05,312
Thanks for the ride home.

445
00:30:16,352 --> 00:30:17,362
It might fester.

446
00:30:18,392 --> 00:30:19,492
I just touched the bandage.

447
00:30:21,632 --> 00:30:22,962
Make sure you get a proper apology tomorrow.

448
00:30:23,532 --> 00:30:25,332
Then you work one more day, and you're done.

449
00:30:27,132 --> 00:30:28,132
Okay.

450
00:30:31,342 --> 00:30:33,272
What? I got a text.

451
00:30:34,872 --> 00:30:36,782
Su Bin, it's Seok.

452
00:30:37,542 --> 00:30:40,852
I guess I'm still not over you.

453
00:30:41,782 --> 00:30:43,152
What a psycho.

454
00:30:44,282 --> 00:30:45,282
Who's that?

455
00:30:45,682 --> 00:30:46,722
A stalker?

456
00:30:47,152 --> 00:30:48,652
No, my ex.

457
00:30:49,152 --> 00:30:50,691
He saw my channel and wouldn't stop calling,

458
00:30:50,692 --> 00:30:52,662
so I blocked him. I guess he's using someone else's phone.

459
00:30:53,532 --> 00:30:54,532
Your ex?

460
00:30:55,292 --> 00:30:56,392
But it was bad enough to block him?

461
00:30:57,802 --> 00:31:00,072
- You didn't really like him, then. - That's not true.

462
00:31:00,402 --> 00:31:02,902
I was crazy about him for a whole year.

463
00:31:03,902 --> 00:31:04,972
You liked him that much?

464
00:31:05,272 --> 00:31:07,372
Yes. I loved him.

465
00:31:07,772 --> 00:31:09,072
Then why break up after only a year?

466
00:31:09,512 --> 00:31:10,742
You just said you were madly in love.

467
00:31:12,142 --> 00:31:15,752
For a guy who's been divorced, you sound surprisingly naive.

468
00:31:17,482 --> 00:31:20,052
You don't fall in love for a reason, or know why you've fallen out of it.

469
00:31:20,392 --> 00:31:22,192
That's love. Not even understanding your own heart.

470
00:31:22,692 --> 00:31:24,262
What do you mean there's no reason?

471
00:31:24,892 --> 00:31:27,132
You must like something about them. There's always a reason.

472
00:31:27,692 --> 00:31:31,832
That's when you first like someone. With true love, there is no "why."

473
00:31:32,602 --> 00:31:35,672
You think about them all day, miss them, want to claim them,

474
00:31:35,772 --> 00:31:37,442
and worry someone else might take them away.

475
00:31:40,172 --> 00:31:41,172
And then what?

476
00:31:42,242 --> 00:31:43,242
What do you mean, "And then what?"

477
00:31:43,582 --> 00:31:44,582
What comes next?

478
00:31:45,212 --> 00:31:46,782
You confess, of course. What else?

479
00:31:47,512 --> 00:31:48,852
You're being really weird.

480
00:31:49,312 --> 00:31:50,752
But there's also the kind of love you have to endure.

481
00:31:51,022 --> 00:31:54,322
For their sake, because you feel you're not good enough,

482
00:31:54,992 --> 00:31:58,362
or you can't make them happy. Holding back is still love, right?

483
00:31:58,492 --> 00:32:02,562
Because you're scared to confess, or because the feeling is bearable.

484
00:32:02,892 --> 00:32:03,902
No, that's not it.

485
00:32:04,562 --> 00:32:08,002
Look, fine. What if you're scared of rejection?

486
00:32:08,172 --> 00:32:09,332
Is that not love?

487
00:32:10,242 --> 00:32:11,242
My point is,

488
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:14,912
wanting to protect someone from afar without them ever knowing.

489
00:32:15,312 --> 00:32:16,572
That's a Daddy-Long-Legs kind of love.

490
00:32:22,112 --> 00:32:26,422
I asked you why you got married, and you said you were lonely.

491
00:32:28,952 --> 00:32:31,522
You've never been in real love, have you?

492
00:32:31,922 --> 00:32:33,862
Love is about possession.

493
00:32:34,232 --> 00:32:35,232
A love you can "endure?"

494
00:32:35,492 --> 00:32:38,302
How could you endure it? It's impossible to hold back.

495
00:32:38,732 --> 00:32:40,202
It always shows.

496
00:32:40,572 --> 00:32:44,142
Three things can't be hidden. Love, poverty, and a sneeze.

497
00:32:47,212 --> 00:32:50,142
Are you really in love with her? How could you hold back for years?

498
00:32:50,442 --> 00:32:51,512
I can't hold back.

499
00:32:52,242 --> 00:32:53,452
I just can't bring myself to.

500
00:32:54,082 --> 00:32:57,222
I want to tell Eun Oh right now. How could anyone hold that in?

501
00:33:02,452 --> 00:33:04,362
Wait, what was that? Don't tell me...

502
00:33:05,022 --> 00:33:06,622
Was all of that about you, Seong Jae?

503
00:33:07,792 --> 00:33:08,792
What?

504
00:33:10,902 --> 00:33:11,902
No.

505
00:33:12,232 --> 00:33:13,232
You should get inside.

506
00:33:14,232 --> 00:33:15,232
Who is she?

507
00:33:15,602 --> 00:33:16,602
Just get out of the car.

508
00:33:28,952 --> 00:33:31,022
You asked me to tell you when Ji Hyuk broke up...

509
00:33:32,522 --> 00:33:33,522
with his latest girlfriend.

510
00:33:40,192 --> 00:33:41,192
At the company,

511
00:33:41,962 --> 00:33:43,762
I'm going to make myself completely indispensable.

512
00:33:44,232 --> 00:33:46,331
So that my father can't function without me.

513
00:33:46,332 --> 00:33:47,372
And then,

514
00:33:48,332 --> 00:33:49,732
I'm going to tell Eun Oh how I feel.

515
00:33:50,002 --> 00:33:51,002
Go and claim Eun Oh right now.

516
00:33:51,602 --> 00:33:52,972
And make sure I don't get the chance.

517
00:33:56,842 --> 00:33:57,842
I endured it well.

518
00:33:58,982 --> 00:33:59,982
I...

519
00:34:01,052 --> 00:34:02,052
kept my cool.

520
00:34:08,752 --> 00:34:12,192
(Auditor's Report on Consolidated Financial Statements)

521
00:34:22,032 --> 00:34:23,302
I'd better go home.

522
00:34:38,682 --> 00:34:39,682
There he goes again.

523
00:34:42,952 --> 00:34:45,492
Dad, are you okay?

524
00:34:47,292 --> 00:34:49,662
Why are you calling out to me? We agreed to act like strangers.

525
00:34:52,162 --> 00:34:54,802
I called out because I was afraid you'd trip on your laces again.

526
00:34:57,072 --> 00:34:58,072
Seriously, Dad.

527
00:34:58,402 --> 00:35:00,272
Why can't you ever tie your shoes properly?

528
00:35:07,412 --> 00:35:09,912
Stop wearing these sneakers.

529
00:35:11,422 --> 00:35:14,022
I'll stop by the convenience store. You go on inside.

530
00:35:17,522 --> 00:35:18,722
What's he talking about?

531
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:25,832
That I almost tripped over my shoelaces again?

532
00:35:27,472 --> 00:35:30,201
That kid... When has he ever seen me trip on laces...

533
00:35:30,202 --> 00:35:31,642
and almost fall?

534
00:35:34,172 --> 00:35:37,142
(Mamdaerozip)

535
00:35:42,652 --> 00:35:45,982
You should check on him instead of just taking his word for it.

536
00:35:46,622 --> 00:35:48,292
Running a business isn't that easy.

537
00:35:49,692 --> 00:35:51,762
Whatever. I'm staying out of it.

538
00:35:53,492 --> 00:35:55,592
Why are you acting all concerned all of a sudden?

539
00:35:57,002 --> 00:35:58,262
What do you mean, "acting?"

540
00:35:58,932 --> 00:35:59,932
Am I wrong?

541
00:36:00,632 --> 00:36:03,132
If you're so worried, you tell him yourself.

542
00:36:03,902 --> 00:36:06,672
Why would I ever say something like that to him?

543
00:36:12,182 --> 00:36:13,182
Ji Hyuk!

544
00:36:16,352 --> 00:36:17,352
What's this?

545
00:36:18,782 --> 00:36:19,782
Beer?

546
00:36:20,322 --> 00:36:21,552
Two? You knew I was coming?

547
00:36:22,922 --> 00:36:24,522
Come and have one in my room.

548
00:36:25,122 --> 00:36:26,191
Just for a little while.

549
00:36:26,192 --> 00:36:28,332
Okay. To your expanding business empire,

550
00:36:28,432 --> 00:36:30,302
I shall gladly make a swift exit.

551
00:36:33,362 --> 00:36:34,432
Am I wrong?

552
00:36:35,332 --> 00:36:38,702
After his wedding got canceled and he left home.

553
00:36:39,302 --> 00:36:41,312
You weren't worried about Ji Hyuk, not even once.

554
00:36:44,282 --> 00:36:47,282
Our eldest son ran out of the house in shock,

555
00:36:47,612 --> 00:36:49,582
and he was gone for over a month.

556
00:36:49,982 --> 00:36:52,752
Did you once even ask where he was or say you were worried?

557
00:36:53,822 --> 00:36:56,352
I didn't say anything because I wasn't worried.

558
00:36:56,622 --> 00:36:58,562
It's because Seong Jae never came by.

559
00:36:59,992 --> 00:37:01,692
Why are you suddenly bringing up Seong Jae?

560
00:37:03,332 --> 00:37:06,802
Ji Hyuk caused that huge mess and ran away from home.

561
00:37:07,172 --> 00:37:09,632
You think a guy like Seong Jae wouldn't come check on us?

562
00:37:10,542 --> 00:37:13,472
He's the type who just shows up and helps himself to a meal.

563
00:37:15,512 --> 00:37:19,882
Seong Jae knew where Ji Hyuk was, so he couldn't visit.

564
00:37:20,212 --> 00:37:24,122
Because if he came and we asked him, he couldn't lie.

565
00:37:27,022 --> 00:37:28,122
That makes sense.

566
00:37:29,952 --> 00:37:31,492
You should have told me, then.

567
00:37:32,392 --> 00:37:35,432
I just assumed you were secretly in touch with him.

568
00:37:36,532 --> 00:37:39,432
So that's why you pretended you weren't worried about him.

569
00:37:39,802 --> 00:37:40,972
Because you had it all figured out?

570
00:37:53,612 --> 00:37:55,152
Dad's intuition is insane!

571
00:37:56,682 --> 00:37:58,622
How did he even think to connect it to Seong Jae?

572
00:37:59,582 --> 00:38:00,592
Tell me about it.

573
00:38:01,022 --> 00:38:02,792
I guess that's how he made it all the way to retirement.

574
00:38:03,292 --> 00:38:06,122
So Seong Jae really knew where you were the whole time?

575
00:38:07,262 --> 00:38:08,262
Yes.

576
00:38:09,362 --> 00:38:13,002
My gosh. Dad's like Sherlock Holmes.

577
00:38:14,702 --> 00:38:16,302
So he was worried about me after all.

578
00:38:24,682 --> 00:38:26,942
I called out because I was afraid you'd trip on your laces again.

579
00:38:29,212 --> 00:38:33,752
But that time, I tripped on my laces and almost fell?

580
00:38:36,092 --> 00:38:37,392
That foggy

581
00:38:38,192 --> 00:38:39,422
Darn...

582
00:38:41,832 --> 00:38:43,392
Right, it was then.

583
00:38:44,232 --> 00:38:47,032
So he came to check on us back then?

584
00:38:48,132 --> 00:38:49,732
This is for your birthday.

585
00:38:50,602 --> 00:38:52,272
I figured you could use some comfortable shoes.

586
00:38:54,272 --> 00:38:57,212
So that's why he bought me new shoes.

587
00:38:58,342 --> 00:39:00,412
And here I was, wondering why he got me shoes out of the blue.

588
00:39:43,122 --> 00:39:44,122
Hello.

589
00:39:47,332 --> 00:39:48,332
Congratulations!

590
00:39:48,892 --> 00:39:49,892
Thank you.

591
00:39:49,992 --> 00:39:52,262
Now that you've received the IM, you're off to a good start.

592
00:39:54,402 --> 00:39:56,532
I'm surprised. This happened faster than I expected.

593
00:39:56,902 --> 00:39:58,841
Someone from the lead manager's team on the AP Group sale...

594
00:39:58,842 --> 00:40:00,872
heard your pitch.

595
00:40:01,912 --> 00:40:03,712
They strongly recommended you to AP Group...

596
00:40:04,082 --> 00:40:05,082
and insisted you get on the list.

597
00:40:07,452 --> 00:40:10,212
Really? The preliminary bidding's just ahead,

598
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:11,282
so we'll have to move fast.

599
00:40:11,852 --> 00:40:14,052
(Chief Director Park Seong Jae)

600
00:40:14,122 --> 00:40:15,852
That investment in the showroom...

601
00:40:16,552 --> 00:40:18,022
and using it to fund the AP Group acquisition.

602
00:40:24,362 --> 00:40:26,402
Okay. I'm sure you saw this one coming.

603
00:40:28,072 --> 00:40:29,432
How about a little something extra?

604
00:40:30,102 --> 00:40:31,402
I got the IM from AP Group.

605
00:40:32,102 --> 00:40:34,012
That takes all the fun out of it.

606
00:40:34,512 --> 00:40:36,872
I was going to play hard to get with that "little something extra."

607
00:40:38,512 --> 00:40:40,312
Wait, so you were already...

608
00:40:40,412 --> 00:40:42,752
Yes, I did some digging on AP Group myself.

609
00:40:43,552 --> 00:40:45,222
But this time, it's an equity investment.

610
00:40:45,752 --> 00:40:48,722
- If the buyout fails, it's off. - Of course.

611
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:51,892
Thanks for introducing me to such a capable advisory firm.

612
00:40:52,222 --> 00:40:53,262
Here.

613
00:40:54,792 --> 00:40:55,792
It's for our existing investors.

614
00:40:57,162 --> 00:40:58,602
A proposal to convert their funds for the deal.

615
00:40:58,762 --> 00:40:59,762
Take a look.

616
00:41:00,462 --> 00:41:04,142
Sung Guk already told me. He said you must be swamped now.

617
00:41:04,572 --> 00:41:05,572
Yes.

618
00:41:05,902 --> 00:41:07,772
I'm actually on my way to meet another investor right now.

619
00:41:08,442 --> 00:41:09,772
Thanks. I'm off.

620
00:41:11,412 --> 00:41:14,082
(Shoealls)

621
00:41:16,082 --> 00:41:17,752
He's a real bulldozer.

622
00:41:19,782 --> 00:41:21,092
- Thanks for all your hard work. - Thank you!

623
00:41:23,592 --> 00:41:26,762
You've worked so hard these past three days, Chief Gong.

624
00:41:26,822 --> 00:41:29,162
If the demolition alone was this much work,

625
00:41:29,792 --> 00:41:32,502
you've got a tough road ahead of you, Ms. Ji.

626
00:41:33,202 --> 00:41:34,902
Thank you. I'll be in touch.

627
00:41:34,972 --> 00:41:36,202
Okay. Yes.

628
00:41:53,992 --> 00:41:55,052
Oh, well...

629
00:41:59,792 --> 00:42:00,792
It's been a while.

630
00:42:01,492 --> 00:42:02,892
It's only been three days. You call that a while?

631
00:42:03,292 --> 00:42:06,402
Yes. We used to see each other every day.

632
00:42:08,072 --> 00:42:09,072
I guess so.

633
00:42:10,132 --> 00:42:12,302
The demolition for Suri-dong finished today, right?

634
00:42:13,042 --> 00:42:14,942
You should've gone home. You must be covered in dust.

635
00:42:15,642 --> 00:42:18,042
I'm here to review the interim plans with the turnkey team.

636
00:42:21,352 --> 00:42:22,352
You're busy.

637
00:42:23,352 --> 00:42:24,452
All right, enjoy your meal.

638
00:42:25,152 --> 00:42:26,252
How's it going?

639
00:42:27,292 --> 00:42:28,292
What?

640
00:42:29,122 --> 00:42:30,292
Stay for some coffee.

641
00:42:30,862 --> 00:42:32,792
And you can tell me how everything's going.

642
00:42:36,662 --> 00:42:38,732
I made the list of candidates for the AP Group acquisition.

643
00:42:40,832 --> 00:42:42,972
AP Group put you on the list?

644
00:42:44,272 --> 00:42:47,472
It seems someone at the sales firm heard my investment pitch.

645
00:42:48,272 --> 00:42:51,412
They pushed for us, saying we had the same vibe as early AP Group.

646
00:42:57,082 --> 00:43:01,192
But how did you even decide to start a business?

647
00:43:02,022 --> 00:43:04,292
You never used to be interested in business at all.

648
00:43:05,262 --> 00:43:06,462
I didn't know either.

649
00:43:06,822 --> 00:43:08,092
If I'd be any good at it.

650
00:43:08,862 --> 00:43:10,262
I didn't even know when I started.

651
00:43:11,332 --> 00:43:13,062
So how did you end up starting it?

652
00:43:15,902 --> 00:43:17,072
You really want to know?

653
00:43:19,842 --> 00:43:20,842
I do.

654
00:43:25,212 --> 00:43:26,282
Well...

655
00:43:27,912 --> 00:43:29,412
The day my wedding was called off,

656
00:43:30,552 --> 00:43:32,922
I just got on the first express bus out of there,

657
00:43:33,582 --> 00:43:35,192
and I ended up in Cheongpo.

658
00:43:36,592 --> 00:43:37,592
What?

659
00:43:37,992 --> 00:43:40,192
Cheongpo? Where Edel Orphanage is?

660
00:43:40,792 --> 00:43:41,792
Yes.

661
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:46,832
I didn't want any time to think, so I just worked day and night.

662
00:43:47,702 --> 00:43:48,902
I didn't even want to sleep.

663
00:43:49,872 --> 00:43:50,902
I didn't want to dream.

664
00:43:54,142 --> 00:43:57,272
Since I couldn't do anything, I worked myself to the bone.

665
00:44:01,612 --> 00:44:02,652
But then,

666
00:44:04,152 --> 00:44:05,152
I really...

667
00:44:06,322 --> 00:44:08,521
I went through some awful moments that made me never go back...

668
00:44:08,522 --> 00:44:09,692
to the person I once was.

669
00:44:11,322 --> 00:44:13,062
I still don't even want to talk about those moments.

670
00:44:14,932 --> 00:44:16,762
Then one day, I met a newlywed couple.

671
00:44:16,832 --> 00:44:18,761
They were renovating their apartment themselves,

672
00:44:18,762 --> 00:44:20,162
and I helped with the work.

673
00:44:20,772 --> 00:44:21,772
So, mister,

674
00:44:22,302 --> 00:44:25,672
for now, could you please come in every day? Please?

675
00:44:25,742 --> 00:44:27,072
Yes, please.

676
00:44:27,342 --> 00:44:29,572
You can give my wife some pointers, you know?

677
00:44:29,642 --> 00:44:31,842
- Yes, please. - Since my freshman year of college,

678
00:44:32,682 --> 00:44:34,852
I'd been doing club volunteer work for over a decade,

679
00:44:35,482 --> 00:44:37,182
so as an amateur, I'd tried my hand at everything, you know?

680
00:44:37,782 --> 00:44:41,322
But still... "What am I, some interior design supervisor?"

681
00:44:41,592 --> 00:44:42,652
That's what I was thinking as I left.

682
00:44:47,792 --> 00:44:48,932
That's when it hit me.

683
00:44:50,902 --> 00:44:51,902
"Wait."

684
00:44:52,402 --> 00:44:53,862
"There must be a lot of people like them."

685
00:44:54,872 --> 00:44:56,932
"People who want to do their own DIY interior design,"

686
00:44:58,002 --> 00:45:00,202
"but are in way over their heads."

687
00:45:01,512 --> 00:45:04,612
The Mamdaerozip matching platform.

688
00:45:05,512 --> 00:45:06,682
I came up with it right then.

689
00:45:08,782 --> 00:45:09,882
And then what?

690
00:45:10,822 --> 00:45:12,552
It's not like that was an easy decision to make.

691
00:45:13,052 --> 00:45:14,122
I was mulling it over,

692
00:45:15,252 --> 00:45:18,422
and an older guy at the job site advised me to give up.

693
00:45:19,922 --> 00:45:21,362
On your business idea?

694
00:45:23,332 --> 00:45:27,002
No, he meant I should accept that I'd hit rock bottom,

695
00:45:28,272 --> 00:45:29,732
and to stop struggling.

696
00:45:30,332 --> 00:45:32,202
Just accept where you are in life.

697
00:45:32,972 --> 00:45:36,112
For every one who makes a comeback, there are thousands who don't.

698
00:45:36,642 --> 00:45:39,512
You'll get used to this soon enough. It'll be okay.

699
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:42,352
So stop fighting it so hard and just give up.

700
00:45:42,812 --> 00:45:44,552
But in that moment, something just boiled up inside me.

701
00:45:47,422 --> 00:45:48,452
"No way."

702
00:45:49,792 --> 00:45:51,622
"I refuse to live my life broken like this."

703
00:45:53,862 --> 00:45:55,092
"I absolutely refuse."

704
00:46:01,472 --> 00:46:02,472
You...

705
00:46:05,302 --> 00:46:06,772
I didn't have the mental space to be considerate of you.

706
00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:17,012
I know.

707
00:46:17,752 --> 00:46:19,722
You said you had to survive.

708
00:46:21,292 --> 00:46:23,652
Will you die? If I'm around...

709
00:46:24,392 --> 00:46:25,892
If I'm in your space,

710
00:46:26,422 --> 00:46:27,762
will that kill you?

711
00:46:28,892 --> 00:46:29,992
I will die.

712
00:46:34,572 --> 00:46:35,602
I guess...

713
00:46:36,572 --> 00:46:39,342
I must have misunderstood a few things.

714
00:46:41,912 --> 00:46:43,142
That's just how people are.

715
00:46:44,812 --> 00:46:46,412
I didn't even really know myself back then.

716
00:46:47,812 --> 00:46:50,012
If I hadn't gone to Cheongpo back then,

717
00:46:50,282 --> 00:46:51,982
I'd probably still have no clue who I am.

718
00:46:54,692 --> 00:46:57,892
- The ramyeon's probably all soggy. - Right.

719
00:47:01,332 --> 00:47:02,932
Shoot, I'll get you a new bowl.

720
00:47:02,992 --> 00:47:05,462
No, it's fine. I'm so hungry I can't wait.

721
00:47:11,102 --> 00:47:13,702
Why is she acting so comfortable around me?

722
00:47:17,882 --> 00:47:20,482
Is that flimsy meal really going to be enough for you?

723
00:47:26,182 --> 00:47:27,992
(Suri-dong Lady)

724
00:47:29,122 --> 00:47:31,362
Yes, ma'am. This is Manager Ji.

725
00:47:32,662 --> 00:47:33,762
A blind date?

726
00:47:36,962 --> 00:47:39,632
- A blind date? - Yes.

727
00:47:42,602 --> 00:47:43,702
In that case, ma'am,

728
00:47:44,072 --> 00:47:46,572
could we talk about that after the construction is finished?

729
00:47:48,772 --> 00:47:49,772
Okay.

730
00:47:50,342 --> 00:47:51,912
I'll take some photos and send them over.

731
00:47:52,742 --> 00:47:54,012
Okay, talk to you later.

732
00:47:55,512 --> 00:47:56,512
Hey.

733
00:47:58,452 --> 00:47:59,622
Was that your client from Suri-dong?

734
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:02,392
But a blind date?

735
00:48:02,752 --> 00:48:06,592
The client's sister came with her son,

736
00:48:06,922 --> 00:48:08,592
and I guess she wanted to set us up.

737
00:48:09,532 --> 00:48:12,632
Why'd you tell her to ask you again after the renovation's done?

738
00:48:13,002 --> 00:48:14,972
She might get disappointed with my work...

739
00:48:15,272 --> 00:48:17,232
and want to call it off, you know.

740
00:48:18,502 --> 00:48:19,572
So then...

741
00:48:20,242 --> 00:48:22,872
you're saying you might actually go on the blind date?

742
00:48:23,572 --> 00:48:24,612
Of course.

743
00:48:30,552 --> 00:48:31,582
She'd go on a blind date?

744
00:48:32,982 --> 00:48:33,982
A blind date?

745
00:48:37,392 --> 00:48:39,422
Jinhwa Group is an excellent match.

746
00:48:39,922 --> 00:48:42,462
A traditional pharmaceutical company that's also into biotech.

747
00:48:43,732 --> 00:48:45,002
I know, right?

748
00:48:45,662 --> 00:48:49,302
And they say his family loves that Yeong Ra is an artist.

749
00:48:50,202 --> 00:48:52,401
If they build her a big gallery a few years down the road,

750
00:48:52,402 --> 00:48:54,272
- that'd be amazing. - Right.

751
00:48:54,812 --> 00:48:57,142
- I'm home. - Oh, there's our girl.

752
00:48:58,612 --> 00:49:00,842
You look extra pretty today.

753
00:49:01,282 --> 00:49:03,382
You're positively glowing.

754
00:49:04,152 --> 00:49:06,522
Is it your solo exhibition and your debut as an artist?

755
00:49:06,922 --> 00:49:08,792
Please. You think that's it?

756
00:49:09,522 --> 00:49:14,262
She met a great guy and is on track. That's why she's so at ease.

757
00:49:16,632 --> 00:49:20,032
Right. So, were you on a date with Vice President Lee today?

758
00:49:20,362 --> 00:49:24,172
No. He's on a two-week business trip.

759
00:49:26,002 --> 00:49:28,872
So, Yeong Ra, do you like Vice President Lee?

760
00:49:31,712 --> 00:49:34,012
- I think so. - I see.

761
00:49:34,482 --> 00:49:38,252
Yeong Ra, don't rush things. Just date him for a few months.

762
00:49:39,622 --> 00:49:40,622
Okay.

763
00:49:58,902 --> 00:50:00,502
(Please Help Find, Missing)

764
00:50:01,742 --> 00:50:05,242
What if they didn't abandon you, but lost you instead?

765
00:50:06,442 --> 00:50:08,652
My parents could have lost me?

766
00:50:13,782 --> 00:50:14,992
Eun Oh, where are you?

767
00:50:15,322 --> 00:50:16,752
Do you want me to bring over some meat?

768
00:50:17,322 --> 00:50:19,922
You need your strength for all that renovation work.

769
00:50:21,292 --> 00:50:22,362
That sounds great.

770
00:50:22,692 --> 00:50:23,962
I'm on my way home now.

771
00:50:29,202 --> 00:50:31,872
(Please Help Find, Missing)

772
00:50:37,672 --> 00:50:39,682
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

773
00:50:41,582 --> 00:50:45,282
Gang Oh, that's enough. I'm saving the rest for your sister.

774
00:50:45,882 --> 00:50:46,882
Isn't there any more?

775
00:50:47,022 --> 00:50:49,721
Gosh, ever since you came back,

776
00:50:49,722 --> 00:50:52,192
all you've been eating is my home-cooked meat.

777
00:50:52,462 --> 00:50:54,162
I guess it's because I couldn't have it when I wanted.

778
00:50:54,632 --> 00:50:55,762
It never gets old.

779
00:50:56,232 --> 00:50:58,862
Mom, why don't we sell this?

780
00:50:59,332 --> 00:51:03,102
You want to sell my marinade at our franchise restaurant?

781
00:51:03,872 --> 00:51:05,302
But it's a one-of-a-kind recipe.

782
00:51:05,572 --> 00:51:07,942
It's a secret recipe handed down from my great-grandmother.

783
00:51:09,112 --> 00:51:10,872
I'll make another batch tomorrow,

784
00:51:11,142 --> 00:51:12,242
but it won't be ready for a week.

785
00:51:12,412 --> 00:51:16,512
Gosh, Eun Oh isn't dating anyone, so she can't even go for barbecue.

786
00:51:17,952 --> 00:51:21,352
I know. She should at least be dating someone.

787
00:51:21,422 --> 00:51:25,292
It will be hard. She fell hard and got rejected badly.

788
00:51:25,392 --> 00:51:29,832
I just don't get it. Why would anyone reject our Eun Oh?

789
00:51:29,992 --> 00:51:32,932
She's so pretty, kind, and thoughtful.

790
00:51:41,272 --> 00:51:42,442
This is really nice.

791
00:51:42,842 --> 00:51:45,282
I'm getting VIP treatment, better than the cafe.

792
00:51:45,942 --> 00:51:47,412
Plus, the coffee's free.

793
00:51:47,842 --> 00:51:48,852
That's true.

794
00:51:50,612 --> 00:51:53,082
So, what was it you wanted to ask me?

795
00:51:54,482 --> 00:51:55,522
Right.

796
00:51:57,422 --> 00:51:58,822
This might seem out of the blue.

797
00:51:59,462 --> 00:52:02,962
What you said at the farewell party has been stuck in my head.

798
00:52:04,292 --> 00:52:06,162
What did I say?

799
00:52:07,732 --> 00:52:11,172
The fact that Ji Hyuk chose to get married like that...

800
00:52:11,242 --> 00:52:13,242
was a little disappointing, but not enough to hate him forever.

801
00:52:13,442 --> 00:52:14,742
There was more to it than that.

802
00:52:15,172 --> 00:52:16,572
Did something else happen?

803
00:52:18,212 --> 00:52:20,582
When Ji Hyuk rejected you,

804
00:52:20,982 --> 00:52:23,012
did something else happen that we don't know about?

805
00:52:28,722 --> 00:52:29,722
Yes, there was.

806
00:52:31,592 --> 00:52:34,492
It's all in the past now. And since it's you...

807
00:52:35,262 --> 00:52:38,502
When Ji Hyuk rejected my confession,

808
00:52:39,402 --> 00:52:41,502
he said we weren't a good match.

809
00:52:42,572 --> 00:52:43,672
Not a good match?

810
00:52:46,572 --> 00:52:47,642
You...

811
00:52:49,072 --> 00:52:50,112
don't suit me.

812
00:52:50,412 --> 00:52:51,512
We're not a good match.

813
00:52:52,242 --> 00:52:53,242
You and I.

814
00:52:54,912 --> 00:52:55,912
But...

815
00:52:56,512 --> 00:52:59,452
Ji Hyuk just wouldn't give me a reason.

816
00:53:00,722 --> 00:53:01,722
So I told him...

817
00:53:01,723 --> 00:53:04,152
So, I need you to explain it to me in detail.

818
00:53:04,892 --> 00:53:07,262
Why don't I deserve to be with you?

819
00:53:07,462 --> 00:53:08,692
When someone...

820
00:53:09,232 --> 00:53:12,532
doesn't meet your standards, you say the person doesn't suit you.

821
00:53:15,002 --> 00:53:16,172
And then,

822
00:53:17,072 --> 00:53:19,842
I heard the news about his engagement to Jung Bo A.

823
00:53:20,802 --> 00:53:21,872
Wait a minute.

824
00:53:22,572 --> 00:53:24,742
Don't tell me when he said you weren't a good match,

825
00:53:25,312 --> 00:53:26,812
you thought he meant your background.

826
00:53:27,612 --> 00:53:28,982
But it was true, wasn't it?

827
00:53:29,682 --> 00:53:32,382
After all, he was going to marry Haneul Construction's daughter.

828
00:53:34,322 --> 00:53:37,922
He's the kind of man to go through with a loveless marriage like that.

829
00:53:38,662 --> 00:53:41,162
So someone like me never stood a chance.

830
00:53:42,862 --> 00:53:44,132
I was just...

831
00:53:44,932 --> 00:53:46,602
so completely out of his league.

832
00:53:49,272 --> 00:53:50,302
That's not it at all.

833
00:53:53,002 --> 00:53:54,002
What?

834
00:53:57,312 --> 00:54:00,012
I'm going to learn scuba diving next spring.

835
00:54:00,642 --> 00:54:03,382
If you keep spending like this, how will you save for your wedding?

836
00:54:03,682 --> 00:54:05,052
Hey, have you lost your memory?

837
00:54:05,622 --> 00:54:07,752
I don't believe in marriage. I told you. I won't get married.

838
00:54:08,652 --> 00:54:10,952
I'm just going to live my life looking out for myself.

839
00:54:12,092 --> 00:54:13,092
That's the life that suits me.

840
00:54:15,492 --> 00:54:17,692
Then what about Eun Oh?

841
00:54:18,732 --> 00:54:20,402
Do you still only see her as a friend?

842
00:54:21,932 --> 00:54:24,032
What's with that weird tone?

843
00:54:24,332 --> 00:54:28,072
Eun Oh and I are like family. You know that.

844
00:54:28,942 --> 00:54:29,942
Yes.

845
00:54:30,542 --> 00:54:31,542
Wait, don't tell me...

846
00:54:32,242 --> 00:54:33,882
you're interested in Eun Oh again, are you?

847
00:54:34,812 --> 00:54:36,012
Not "again."

848
00:54:36,512 --> 00:54:38,152
I never lost interest.

849
00:54:39,522 --> 00:54:40,782
I told you back in college.

850
00:54:41,352 --> 00:54:44,862
- That it would never work. - Yes, long-distance from the US.

851
00:54:45,862 --> 00:54:46,922
I guess that was asking too much.

852
00:54:47,522 --> 00:54:50,332
Why did I listen to you back then? Sometimes, I regret it.

853
00:54:50,492 --> 00:54:52,902
I don't care if Yeo Jin was the one who pursued you.

854
00:54:53,462 --> 00:54:54,832
You still got married.

855
00:54:55,132 --> 00:54:57,372
Besides, have you forgotten how you two got divorced?

856
00:54:57,702 --> 00:55:00,042
How did your father tear you two apart?

857
00:55:01,372 --> 00:55:02,612
Don't even think about Eun Oh.

858
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:05,582
Once I come back with my MBA,

859
00:55:05,882 --> 00:55:09,012
- I can break free from my parents. - Seong Jae, I told you this before.

860
00:55:09,712 --> 00:55:13,652
Ever since I met her in our club, Eun Oh's had it rough for six years.

861
00:55:14,052 --> 00:55:16,152
Juggling 2 to 3 tutoring jobs to support her family,

862
00:55:16,252 --> 00:55:17,752
and on top of that, she was on a scholarship.

863
00:55:18,092 --> 00:55:19,822
And she never missed a single volunteer day.

864
00:55:20,862 --> 00:55:22,691
I've never seen anyone manage so much...

865
00:55:22,692 --> 00:55:24,632
with as much fortitude as Eun Oh.

866
00:55:25,832 --> 00:55:26,862
I know.

867
00:55:27,502 --> 00:55:28,632
That's why I think...

868
00:55:29,332 --> 00:55:30,872
someone like Ji Eun Oh...

869
00:55:31,332 --> 00:55:33,942
deserves a life that makes up for all her hardships.

870
00:55:35,272 --> 00:55:36,542
But Ji Hyuk, for me,

871
00:55:37,512 --> 00:55:39,282
I feel warm whenever I see Ji Eun Oh.

872
00:55:40,142 --> 00:55:41,312
Just warm.

873
00:55:41,782 --> 00:55:43,412
Like a ray of bright sunshine.

874
00:55:43,952 --> 00:55:45,522
From the first moment I saw her until now.

875
00:55:46,252 --> 00:55:47,352
So...

876
00:55:47,952 --> 00:55:49,422
I feel like I should confess my feelings at least once.

877
00:55:49,992 --> 00:55:50,992
Don't.

878
00:55:51,422 --> 00:55:52,492
It absolutely cannot be you.

879
00:55:53,192 --> 00:55:55,832
Eun Oh needs someone who's capable,

880
00:55:56,462 --> 00:55:58,532
someone who can support her and her family.

881
00:56:00,302 --> 00:56:02,032
And someone who truly loves her.

882
00:56:03,002 --> 00:56:04,772
A warm man with a backbone. That's who she needs.

883
00:56:06,642 --> 00:56:08,542
Do you really not have any feelings for her?

884
00:56:08,912 --> 00:56:10,312
You care about Eun Oh so much.

885
00:56:10,972 --> 00:56:13,842
Hey, she's like a sister to me. How could I possibly feel that way?

886
00:56:14,012 --> 00:56:16,882
Besides, a guy like me is out of the question.

887
00:56:18,452 --> 00:56:20,882
My family's nothing special, and I'm just an office worker.

888
00:56:21,492 --> 00:56:25,462
A guy who can't support her family and only thinks of himself.

889
00:56:25,862 --> 00:56:28,392
I'm not the one for her either, you get it?

890
00:56:30,532 --> 00:56:31,532
Director Park.

891
00:56:32,332 --> 00:56:34,002
What are you thinking so hard about?

892
00:56:37,502 --> 00:56:38,642
I was just thinking...

893
00:56:39,242 --> 00:56:41,572
that you've got it all wrong about Ji Hyuk.

894
00:56:43,072 --> 00:56:44,642
What do you mean?

895
00:56:45,312 --> 00:56:47,342
When Ji Hyuk said you two weren't a good match,

896
00:56:47,912 --> 00:56:51,282
he probably meant that he's the one who isn't good enough for you.

897
00:56:54,822 --> 00:56:56,522
What do you mean by that?

898
00:56:57,492 --> 00:56:59,022
He said you deserved to meet a capable man.

899
00:56:59,462 --> 00:57:02,162
Someone warm who will love you dearly...

900
00:57:02,692 --> 00:57:04,191
and can even care for your family.

901
00:57:04,192 --> 00:57:06,032
He told me you should meet a man like that.

902
00:57:06,662 --> 00:57:08,472
Not a guy like me who comes from a good family...

903
00:57:08,872 --> 00:57:11,102
but has a difficult father.

904
00:57:11,572 --> 00:57:15,342
Nor a guy like Ji Hyuk, too ordinary to be of any help to you.

905
00:57:20,442 --> 00:57:22,012
I think when he turned you down,

906
00:57:23,012 --> 00:57:24,852
that's probably why he said it that way.

907
00:57:30,052 --> 00:57:31,252
Then why didn't he...

908
00:57:32,022 --> 00:57:33,792
just tell me that himself?

909
00:57:34,722 --> 00:57:35,932
I'm not sure either.

910
00:57:36,662 --> 00:57:37,762
"Not a good match."

911
00:57:38,362 --> 00:57:39,862
I just found out he said that.

912
00:57:49,972 --> 00:57:53,882
Yes, if we could acquire AP Group, it would be a jackpot.

913
00:57:53,942 --> 00:57:56,382
But the thing is...

914
00:57:57,582 --> 00:58:00,052
In any case, he's been shortlisted.

915
00:58:00,122 --> 00:58:02,522
Please help me out. It's about the showroom funds.

916
00:58:02,722 --> 00:58:04,652
If you could convert that into funds for the AP Group acquisition,

917
00:58:05,022 --> 00:58:07,662
it would be a tremendous help in securing further investment.

918
00:58:08,662 --> 00:58:12,062
The manager is so sharp, and there's nothing she can't do.

919
00:58:12,302 --> 00:58:14,362
- Thank you. - She'd be a great daughter-in-law.

920
00:58:14,432 --> 00:58:16,372
- The space itself is so wonderful. - Come on.

921
00:58:16,802 --> 00:58:19,401
- You're just so talented. - Thank you.

922
00:58:19,402 --> 00:58:21,912
She looks like the Suri-dong client.

923
00:58:25,312 --> 00:58:26,312
Cheol Min.

924
00:58:28,142 --> 00:58:29,912
Any idea why she's here?

925
00:58:31,412 --> 00:58:33,922
I think she's here to invite Ms. Ji somewhere.

926
00:58:34,852 --> 00:58:36,122
An invitation? Where to?

927
00:58:37,192 --> 00:58:38,192
Wait.

928
00:58:38,822 --> 00:58:41,422
- Why? - Something about her nephew...

929
00:58:42,962 --> 00:58:45,202
Don't you think she's trying to set her up?

930
00:58:48,432 --> 00:58:49,602
Her nephew?

931
00:58:52,872 --> 00:58:56,542
My son is such a great catch. It's not just a mother's pride.

932
00:58:56,972 --> 00:58:58,112
- That's right. - How...

933
00:58:58,982 --> 00:59:01,682
He's prime husband material. He's a lawyer.

934
00:59:19,502 --> 00:59:20,562
A blind date.

935
00:59:21,062 --> 00:59:22,072
A blind date.

936
00:59:22,332 --> 00:59:24,772
A blind date?

937
00:59:28,642 --> 00:59:29,672
(Audit Report)

938
00:59:36,652 --> 00:59:39,122
What's the status on the investment conversion?

939
00:59:50,192 --> 00:59:51,292
Well...

940
00:59:52,462 --> 00:59:54,802
It all got approved.

941
00:59:56,102 --> 00:59:57,132
That's great.

942
00:59:57,672 --> 00:59:59,102
I guess now...

943
00:59:59,672 --> 01:00:01,402
the real investment war begins.

944
01:00:02,642 --> 01:00:03,642
Yes.

945
01:00:06,782 --> 01:00:08,752
What brings you here?

946
01:00:13,982 --> 01:00:18,762
I saw your visitor on my way in and wondered if there was a problem.

947
01:00:21,522 --> 01:00:22,732
No, it's nothing like that.

948
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:26,302
Apparently, the client's nephew is a lawyer.

949
01:00:26,732 --> 01:00:28,772
He's opening a law firm with a few partners,

950
01:00:29,132 --> 01:00:30,972
and she came to invite me to the opening party.

951
01:00:32,442 --> 01:00:35,642
Sounds like a blind date disguised as an opening party.

952
01:00:37,312 --> 01:00:38,512
Seems that way, doesn't it?

953
01:00:39,982 --> 01:00:41,242
You're going to go?

954
01:00:42,312 --> 01:00:43,312
Yes.

955
01:00:43,782 --> 01:00:45,982
- Why? - What do you mean, why?

956
01:00:46,482 --> 01:00:49,722
Well, I'm 30 now, and if I want to start a family,

957
01:00:49,992 --> 01:00:51,422
it's about time I started meeting good people.

958
01:00:54,822 --> 01:00:56,992
You want to get married?

959
01:00:57,432 --> 01:00:59,002
It's not like I'm against getting married.

960
01:01:00,162 --> 01:01:02,572
Did I ever say I wasn't going to get married?

961
01:01:04,532 --> 01:01:05,542
No.

962
01:01:07,942 --> 01:01:09,342
But is he a good guy?

963
01:01:11,012 --> 01:01:12,842
You don't know anything about him other than his job.

964
01:01:14,242 --> 01:01:17,352
I'm just worried you'll end up with another weirdo like in college.

965
01:01:18,722 --> 01:01:20,382
I'm not in college anymore, you know.

966
01:01:21,252 --> 01:01:23,792
Besides, you never really know at first.

967
01:01:24,292 --> 01:01:25,692
You have to meet someone to get to know them.

968
01:01:28,392 --> 01:01:31,862
Wait. You said you'd think about it after the renovation.

969
01:01:32,732 --> 01:01:34,932
What if things get complicated between you two,

970
01:01:35,232 --> 01:01:37,602
and it ends up affecting the renovation project?

971
01:01:38,642 --> 01:01:40,502
You're more responsible than that.

972
01:01:41,602 --> 01:01:43,142
Why are you being...

973
01:01:43,942 --> 01:01:45,642
so reckless?

974
01:01:47,282 --> 01:01:48,382
That's enough.

975
01:01:48,882 --> 01:01:49,982
I can handle it myself.

976
01:01:53,752 --> 01:01:54,782
No.

977
01:01:56,792 --> 01:01:57,792
What?

978
01:01:58,452 --> 01:01:59,462
You can't.

979
01:02:00,592 --> 01:02:01,592
Don't go.

980
01:02:04,832 --> 01:02:06,562
Please just leave now.

981
01:02:07,902 --> 01:02:08,902
I can't do this.

982
01:02:11,002 --> 01:02:12,302
I just can't do this anymore.

983
01:02:16,112 --> 01:02:17,642
I can't, because I like you too much.

984
01:02:20,882 --> 01:02:21,882
I...

985
01:02:25,152 --> 01:02:26,482
I can't let you go,

986
01:02:27,082 --> 01:02:28,082
Eun Oh.

987
01:03:14,862 --> 01:03:17,402
(Our Golden Days)

988
01:03:17,772 --> 01:03:22,242
I can't just let this go. How can a rookie like you...

989
01:03:22,312 --> 01:03:25,282
- jump straight to the top? - Dad, enough!

990
01:03:25,442 --> 01:03:29,052
But you still should have told me.

991
01:03:29,182 --> 01:03:30,782
I'm your daughter.

992
01:03:31,152 --> 01:03:33,322
Dad, what has gotten into you?

993
01:03:33,522 --> 01:03:35,422
I like that you're not like most girls these days.

994
01:03:35,492 --> 01:03:38,122
Yeong Ra, you're something else. How can you be so...

995
01:03:38,192 --> 01:03:41,492
- clueless about who you even are? - I confessed my feelings to Eun Oh.

996
01:03:41,622 --> 01:03:45,062
Don't feel bad on my account. I'm not telling Eun Oh how I feel.

997
01:03:45,132 --> 01:03:46,132
What?
