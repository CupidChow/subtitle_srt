00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,310
(Episode 25)

2
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,060
You knew, didn't you?

3
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,600
You knew how I felt.

4
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,540
I knew.

5
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,980
And I knew, too.

6
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,420
I knew what your answer would be.
But still...

7
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:49,590
Even though I knew you'd reject me,

8
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,530
I just had to tell you.

9
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,030
Figures.

10
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,030
You never say what you should
at the right time,

11
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:05,070
but you have no problem saying
what you shouldn't.

12
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:10,910
We're not...

13
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,450
a good match.

14
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:15,780
You...

15
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,280
don't suit me.

16
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,620
- Back then...
- But I heard that was your reason.

17
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,990
He probably meant that he's the one
who isn't good enough for you.

18
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,130
Not a guy like me
who comes from a good family...

19
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,670
but has a difficult father.

20
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:38,100
Nor a guy like Ji Hyuk, too ordinary
to be of any help to you.

21
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:42,570
So Seong Jae told you.

22
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,140
That's right.

23
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,450
That's what I thought.

24
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,950
Because I cared about you so much.

25
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,520
And if I meet a man like that...

26
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,220
I'm supposed to be happy?

27
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:04,800
Who are you to set my standards?
It's my life, not yours.

28
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,830
I wanted you to be
with someone perfect.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,140
If that's the case,

30
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,410
why didn't you tell me
the reason back then?

31
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,110
When I was furious after hearing
you were getting married.

32
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,510
If you'd just said,
"Eun Oh, your background..."

33
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:21,580
"and circumstances..."

34
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,850
"don't meet my standards,"
it would've been so much simpler.

35
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,250
You let me
completely misunderstand you,

36
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:33,160
and you never offered
an explanation or even an excuse.

37
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,430
It was because of your ego,

38
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,260
your need to save face.
Isn't that right?

39
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,270
Especially because
you were about to become...

40
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,370
Haneul Construction's son-in-law.

41
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,410
In that moment,
our ten years together...

42
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,940
and our friendship where we trusted
each other more than anyone...

43
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,080
were shattered to pieces.

44
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,050
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,220
You're just pathetic.

46
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,730
What's the point
of you liking me now?

47
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,000
It's all pointless now.

48
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,270
What do you mean, it's pointless?

49
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:21,210
If Jung Bo A hadn't run away
from that wedding,

50
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,480
you'd be the son-in-law of
the Haneul Construction family now.

51
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,120
I guess...

52
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,620
you'd be the Vice President.

53
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,760
That kind of person...

54
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,460
I can't stand them.

55
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:45,530
Someone who would marry without love
for money...

56
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:49,370
I despise people like that.

57
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,180
I would never let someone like that
into my life.

58
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,260
We really...

59
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,670
don't belong together.

60
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:31,610
Look.

61
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,010
We're already a broken dish.

62
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,520
They say you can glue a broken dish
back together,

63
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,590
but you can never use it again.

64
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,290
Since we're pieced back together
in a way,

65
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,030
let's go back to how we were,

66
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,900
and just be good colleagues.

67
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,280
Excuse me.

68
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,920
Mr. Lee.

69
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:14,990
Why weren't you answering
your phone?

70
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,760
The advisory firm has just sent over
the AP Group valuation report.

71
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:21,890
Right.

72
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,230
Yes, I've printed it out for you,
so please have a look.

73
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,970
I need to go to Suri-dong
and check on the facilities.

74
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,210
Okay.

75
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:55,930
It's over.

76
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,130
It's all over now.

77
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,750
Mr. Lee.

78
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,630
Thanks.

79
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,200
Ji Hyuk said
he wouldn't be coming home tonight.

80
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,030
I guess he's swamped.

81
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,270
He's not coming home?
What's he so busy with?

82
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,970
He just said he had to
pull an all-nighter at work.

83
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:18,140
But he's not in manufacturing.
Why would he pull an all-nighter?

84
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:21,910
You should've asked for more details
on why he can't come home.

85
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:27,080
The CEO wouldn't pull an all-nighter
unless something happened.

86
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,490
That kid...

87
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:38,900
It looks like he went home.

88
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:45,470
- You're here?
- You must have worked all night.

89
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,770
Did you pull an all-nighter too?

90
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,440
The investment proposal was urgent.

91
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,410
Cheol Min, I'm going to the bank.
Can you get the documents ready?

92
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,510
Yes, sir.

93
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,780
I think we can approve the loan
for the amount you requested.

94
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,750
Great. Please proceed.

95
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,250
Be sure to emphasize that
we must integrate our distribution,

96
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,060
logistics,
and construction networks.

97
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:08,130
We absolutely must show them
that the brand value will increase.

98
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,630
Next, with this graph...

99
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,660
As you know, Mamdaerozip has shown
consistent and rapid growth.

100
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,540
The synergy between AP Group
and Mamdaerozip...

101
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,800
is what you're about to witness.

102

104
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,980
How's that burn on your arm doing?

105
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,120
It's getting better.

106
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,450
Good.

107
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:38,020
Mr. Shin met you at the restaurant.
He said you're sharp and very nice.

108
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:42,990
I'm new to this field,
so please show me the ropes.

109
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:47,030
Ms. Jung will show you the ropes
before she goes on maternity leave.

110
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,670
Okay.

111
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:53,200
So until she leaves,
I just work four hours a day, right?

112
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,910
(Finding a suitable delivery
for Lee Sang Cheol)

113

pull an all-nighter at work.

114
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,850
But he's not in manufacturing.
Why would he pull an all-nighter?

What in the world?

121
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,210
This can't be happening.

(Ms. Shin)

124
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,880
Ji Eun Oh's routine hasn't changed.
She only goes between work and home.

125
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,820
Whatever the reason,
they still abandoned me.

126
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,260
What's there to be curious about?

127
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,560
Of course,
you must have a lot on your mind.

128
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,040
Why do you keep staring at me?

129
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:05,180
Didn't you say your business trip
was supposed to be two weeks long?

130
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,910
I guess I must have missed you.

131
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,580
- Sorry?
- I mean...

132
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,820
Didn't it occur to you that
I might have cut my trip short?

133
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:19,420
How can you talk of marrying a guy
you've only met once?

134
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,230
Do you even know what food he likes?
Have you held his hand?

135
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,430
Have you kissed him?

136
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,870
So, I say I missed you,
and you get hiccups.

137
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,440
This should stop them.

138
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,110
He probably bought you a gift.

139
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:44,480
Then you say, "What's this for?"

140
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,950
What's this for?

141
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,620
I was thinking of you
during my trip.

142
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,790
Let me put it on for you.

143
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,890
He'll say he bought it
because he was thinking of you.

144
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,230
- Then...
- I'll accept it on my birthday.

145
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:58,860
You have to really play up
the "new to the dating scene" angle.

146
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,930
You really haven't dated much,
have you, Yeong Ra?

147
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,600
Please, sit down.

148
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,940
People are staring.

149
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,210
Take it.

150
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,320
I'll get you something even better
for your birthday.

151
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,590
Give this to me
on my birthday, then.

152
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,060
But you can't just act naive.
You have to show a mind of your own.

153
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,630
Receiving gifts for no reason...

154
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,430
It's not really my thing.

155
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,870
When is your birthday, then?

156
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,250
Are they parting ways
immediately after the meal?

157
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:50,680
Where are they off to?

158
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,750
What?

159
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,160
That punk is holding her hand.

160
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,030
And Yeong Ra's just letting him?

161
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:06,400
She lets her mom drag her around.
Now, she lets a guy do it too.

162
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,100
Park Yeong Ra's life, I swear...

163
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,600
Hey.

164
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,840
How can you go through life
not even knowing who you are?

165
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,570
For someone so talented
at writing and drawing webtoons,

166
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,240
why can't you use your own talents
and live freely?

167
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:31,820
What's wrong?

168
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:33,490
You must be feeling warm.

169
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,090
Your hand is a bit sweaty.

170
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,960
I guess I'm nervous.

171
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,530
I thought I had some tissues.

172
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,470
I must have startled you
by grabbing your hand like that.

173
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,280
We've only met twice.

174
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,410
So of course, it's a little awkward.

175
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,480
But...

176
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,720
I was under the impression
we're dating with marriage in mind.

177
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,150
Our families
have already worked things out.

178
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:07,090
It's not like we've set a date,

179
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,530
and this is still only
our second meeting.

180
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,400
So I'm not quite comfortable yet.

181
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,170
Right.

182
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,900
That's what I like.

183
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,310
I like that you're not like
most girls these days.

184
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,380
Your mother has managed you
very well.

185
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,910
You said
you had a meeting at 2 p.m., right?

186
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,420
I'm cold.

187
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,400
Hey.

188
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,460
Hey, get her home safe. Got it?

189
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:50,600
I hear that stalker is still
on the loose, right?

190
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:56,040
I'm a salaried employee.
I don't accept tips.

191
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,380
What's with him? The nerve.

192
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:07,220
Wow, he has
his surprisingly cool moments.

193
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,100
Darn it!

194
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,680
What are you doing?

195
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,380
Your hand is nice and dry.

196
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,190
Lee Sang Hoon's hand was so clammy.
It felt weird.

197
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,560
Weird, how?

198
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,830
Good weird or bad weird?

199
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,170
- Bad, obviously.
- It was?

200
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:01,770
Hey, that's a big deal.
Physical chemistry is important.

201
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,570
You at least know that much, right?

202
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,220
You don't?
You seriously don't know that?

203
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:15,850
No, I know!

204
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,020
Let me ask you straight out.

205
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,490
First of all, do you actually
want to get married now?

206
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:25,830
I don't.

207
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,970
Then just say no.
Tell them he's not the one.

208
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,670
Don't you know I can't be honest
and just say I don't want to do it?

209
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,970
You're always telling me,
"Don't do it," or "You can't."

210
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:39,780
- Fine, get married then.
- No, that's not what I meant.

211
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,950
I need to think.

212
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,420
About what?

213
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:48,920
How to handle it.

214
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,130
How was your date today?

215
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:00,030
I heard he even cut
his business trip short to see you.

216
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,030
It was okay.

217
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,100
It wasn't bad, was it?

218
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,170
No.

219
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:11,540
And we're meeting again next week.

220
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,480
Good.

221
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,020
Listen, Yeong Ra.

222
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,850
If you marry into Jinhwa Group,

223
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,660
you'll enter
a top-20 business family.

224
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,160
You know this opportunity
doesn't come along for just anyone.

225
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:33,430
If I'd had your advantages,
I could've landed the HO Group heir.

226
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,400
I know.

227
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,270
But since I was remarrying
and had no family background,

228
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,470
I was more than grateful
to marry your dad.

229
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,180
But it's different for you.

230
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:51,250
In life,
there's this thing called synergy.

231
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:56,350
It's the combination of your family,
looks, age, education, and job...

232
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:58,860
that made marrying
the son of Jinhwa Group possible.

233
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:02,060
And it's how
you'll move up in the world.

234
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:05,660
Don't you forget it.

235
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,200
Opportunities like this
don't come often for people like us.

236
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,040
Yes, I know.

237
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,290
I know. I get it.

238
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,750
I know we agreed to pretend
we don't know each other.

239
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,260
Then what are you doing in my room?

240
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:39,330
Well, even so...
I couldn't let this one thing slide.

241
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:41,630
What's this about?

242
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,870
Are you that desperate for money?

243
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:49,840
What makes you think you can just
take over a huge company like AP?

244
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,280
Why are you so desperate
to hit the jackpot?

245
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,910
How did you find out about that?

246
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,520
Is that really
what matters right now?

247
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,320
I'm not trying
to take it over for the money.

248
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:06,620
I'm not trying to hit the jackpot.
So please, don't worry so much.

249
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:10,790
How can you not call it greed?
A kid like you with no experience...

250
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,130
thinking he can shoot
straight to the top?

251
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,530
Dad, please...

252
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:17,840
Just stop...

253
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,370
Please, don't do this.

254
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:26,640
I'm asking you to stop judging me
by your own standards.

255
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,310
You could be wrong, you know.

256
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,950
We had an agreement, Dad.

257
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,750
Just pretend
you don't know anything.

258
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,160
But you're my son...

259
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,030
I know you're only worried
because I'm your son.

260
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,160
But you always jump
straight to judging me.

261
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,800
And that doesn't help me at all.

262
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,300
Nice, we're off to a great start.

263
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:30,770
And I've got even better news
to top it off.

264
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,880
The only good news I care about
is an investment.

265
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,680
Boyang Construction was
on the list of strategic investors.

266
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,550
- Yes.
- They want to invest ten million.

267
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,620
Boyang Construction is offering
ten million dollars?

268
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:48,130
You heard the amount
we're prepared to invest?

269
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,890
Ten million dollars.

270
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,460
Thank you.

271
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,960
I've finally found a partner
who believes in me.

272
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,470
You've reviewed
the investment terms, right?

273
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:00,540
Are the terms acceptable?

274
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,310
Yes, there don't seem
to be any particular issues.

275
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:05,940
In that case, shall we draw up
the letter of intent now?

276
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:08,910
That was a quick decision.

277
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:12,580
- Please have the contract ready.
- Sure.

278
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,710
What brings you here?

279
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,180
No reason.

280
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:49,890
Feel free to look around.

281
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,730
Your clients must love this place.

282
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,170
Why is he here?

283
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,040
Here...

284
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,110
Just in case.

285
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:15,980
I'm leaving.

286
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,270
This is good.

291
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,920
What if they didn't abandon you,

292
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:35,990
but lost you instead?

293
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,760
Even someone like me...

294
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,460
I registered my DNA with the police,
just in case.

295
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,780
Please, don't do this.

296
00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:01,080
I'm asking you to stop judging me
by your own standards.

297
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:03,450
You could be wrong, you know.

298
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,760
I wanted to live a good life.

299
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,590
People in my generation...

300
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:11,090
don't believe they have to marry
someone they love,

301
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:13,500
and they don't see marriage
as a necessity.

302
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,730
It's just that
our values are different.

303
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,470
You're trapped
in old-fashioned thinking.

304
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:19,940
So you two will never
understand my choice.

305
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,640
If you believe your life is right,

306
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,210
then just keep believing it.

307
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:25,210
But don't force your children
to agree with you.

308
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:26,640
Dad, please...

309
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,480
"Please?"

310
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:30,550
"Please?"

311
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:34,850
I can't exactly take this to court.
This is unbelievable.

312
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,460
Let me know when you find
another part-time job.

313
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:43,330
(Mr. Early)

314
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,460
Yes, it's me, the Spring.

315
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,770
Oh, my. You startled me.

316
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:53,170
- Why?
- You just picked up so fast.

317
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:57,540
- I was happy it was you.
- Yes, it's nice to hear your voice.

318
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:01,080
Anyway, it's nothing major.
You asked me to let you know...

319
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,380
if I found a new job.

320
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:04,850
You found one? Where?

321
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:08,590
It's over in Myeongsa-dong.
It's right where I transfer buses...

322
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,420
on my way home from the academy.

323
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:13,590
Would it be okay
if I head over there now?

324
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:16,230
There's something
I wanted to ask you.

325
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:18,230
Really? Hey, me too.

326
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,300
Yes, sure.

327
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:25,000
Deciding on a dream in ninth grade
is pretty early.

328
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,000
That's not easy at that age.

329
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:31,440
That's why I said,
"Great. I'll send you abroad."

330
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:34,680
We weren't rich,

331
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,550
but I figured
if I scrimped, saved every penny,

332
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:38,250
and cashed in my severance pay,

333
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,550
I thought I could scrape enough
together to send him abroad.

334
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:44,290
And then what happened?

335
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,430
But then, around the spring
of his senior year,

336
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:52,230
my father's abdominal aorta
ruptured,

337
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,460
and he was also diagnosed
with kidney cancer.

338
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:59,470
It wasn't just one surgery, either.
In my father's condition,

339
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:02,470
he had to stay in the hospital
for a very long time.

340
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:07,740
So, I had to tell my son
he couldn't study abroad.

341
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:10,910
My gosh.

342
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,020
But he was a high school senior?

343
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:21,160
Well, as my father's son,
it was my duty.

344
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:23,390
I felt like I had no other choice.

345
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:25,930
So after that, my son...

346
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,530
I thought he might at least go
for architecture here in Korea,

347
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,240
but he just threw that dream away.

348
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:37,910
He's a smart kid, though,
so he aced school, got a good job,

349
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:41,310
and I thought he was living his life
freely enough, but...

350
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,480
I guess that's not how he saw it.

351
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:49,290
He resented me for my broken promise
and let it build up over the years.

352
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,290
Looking back on it now,

353
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:58,060
I think giving up on architecture
was his way of rebelling.

354
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,370
I think I get it.

355
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,370
So...

356
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,810
What I want to ask is... I mean...

357
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:12,480
I'm...

358
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:15,180
I'm not from my son's generation,
you know?

359
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,710
Please feel free to ask.

360
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,250
You don't need to hold back with me.

361
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,590
Well...

362
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:27,720
For young adults these days,
life is really tough, isn't it?

363
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:30,990
It's hard to find a job
and even harder to get on your feet.

364
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:35,000
Even though your generation is
actually smarter than mine.

365
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:37,570
Right.

366
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:41,000
Everyone's struggling
and having a hard time.

367
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:43,970
So for him,

368
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,140
I guess money has become
the most important thing.

369
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:51,550
He won't struggle just to get by,
so he doesn't even want to marry.

370
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,250
And... It's like...

371
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:58,220
If a woman just checks
all the right boxes,

372
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:03,260
he can marry her without love.
I guess that's what he believes.

373
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,330
Your son?

374
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,030
But for me,

375
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,170
I can't wrap my head around that
at all.

376
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,910
But for young people these days,

377
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:19,780
is that really
a common way of thinking?

378
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:24,650
It's very common.

379
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:30,590
For our generation, it's hard
without help from our parents.

380
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,520
No matter how hard we work,

381
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:35,360
it's hard to buy a home...

382
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,600
or build a decent life
after getting married, you know?

383
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,800
And on top of that, we're constantly
being compared to others.

384
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:45,470
That's why
everyone's on their own path.

385
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,940
Some people marry for love.

386
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,770
Some settle for a marriage
of convenience,

387
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,910
while some decide
not to get married at all.

388
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:57,580
And others even marry for money.

389
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,590
And for your son,
especially after his senior year,

390
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:06,960
I can see
why he thinks things like...

391
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:10,260
his environment, background,
and money are important.

392
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:14,960
But you're not like that.
You don't think like that.

393
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,500
That's just me.

394
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:25,380
So, without their parents' help,
they'd think that way.

395
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,950
It could really be like that?

396
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:39,220
Right.
It's tough for the young. I get it.

397
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,130
No, but even so,
like that punk, Ji Hyuk,

398
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:45,100
they'd marry a woman
who can't get over another man?

399
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:47,700
Good grief. No way.

400
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,840
There are young people like her
who are doing just fine.

401
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,110
But...

402
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:01,010
how could she be so loved
and cheerful if she were adopted?

My mom's family has a secret recipe
that's been passed down.

What if I was just lost?

415
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:08,310
Do you think my birth mother
would still be looking for me?

416
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:11,450
Yes, of course. If you were lost,

417
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,820
she'd still be looking for you,
for sure. Don't be silly.

00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,390

that bring back memories?

469
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,880
Grandma, you're 88 now.

470
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,580
What?
You've had this for almost 30 years?

471
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,590
You think 30 years is old?
Move aside.

472

Here it is.

The suspense is killing me.)

is 68 years old.

479

splurged to have this made.

480

for real?)

484
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:45,390
Grandma, can I try this on?
Can I, please?

485
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,690
(That 68-year-old dress
looks so modern.)

come back around.)

- It's so pretty!

488

come full circle.

- Hi, Grandma!
- I can go out in this, right?

491
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:58,500
Her closet is a treasure chest.

492
00:34:58,570 --> 00:34:59,770
This makes me want to raid
my grandma's closet.

493
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,040

496
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:05,840
Grandma? What's wrong?

497
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,540
Are you crying
thinking about your mom?

498
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:08,850
(Please don't cry...
This is breaking my heart.)

499
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:10,710
I miss my mom,

500
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,990
and it's just so sad
how the years have slipped away.

501
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:17,550
How silly of me.

502
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:19,360
(No more tears, please.)

503
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:23,460
- Grandma, don't cry.
- Grandma, please put it on for us!

504
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,230
We want to see you in it, Grandma!

505
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,930
They're saying they want to see
Grandma wear it.

506
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:32,640
That's right, Grandma.
Why don't you try it on?

507
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,510
Me? Wear this?

508
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:38,640
Honey, no. It won't fit me.

509
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:41,710
Don't worry, Grandma.
I'll make it fit.

510
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:45,050
- This is no good!
- Ha Eun, hand me some safety pins.

511
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:46,420
Hey, that pricked me.

512
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:49,650
Sorry, Grandma.
We're almost there. Just a second.

513

Ta-da!

520
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,530
So, Grandma? How do you feel?
Feel like you're 20 again?

521
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,770
It feels like just yesterday.

522
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:09,310
I'd wear this dress...

523
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:12,480
and sneak out
in my mom's pointy heels.

524
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,410
Once, I went all the way into town.

525
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,950
Everyone was staring at me,

526
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:22,750
and I felt just like
Kim Ji Mee, the actress.

527
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:24,590
Or maybe even Um Aing Ran.

528
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:28,360
I was so excited
that I just roamed around all day.

529
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,660
Oh, my. This really takes me back.

530
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,560
Su Bin, the comments are blowing up.

531
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,500
Of course, they are.

532
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:38,100
Have you ever seen
a grandma this cool?

533
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:43,040
Oh, boy. I'm getting teary-eyed.

534
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,140
Grandma, you look so beautiful
right now.

535
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,490
I should've called first.

536
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,190
Where did he go?

537
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:13,440
What are these?
They aren't his blood pressure meds.

538
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:19,780
(Sejong Psychiatric Clinic)

539
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:30,550
Hey, Da Jeong!

540
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:34,490
Wait, what are you doing here?

541
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,560
And what's that?

542
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,000
And this medicine?

543
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,400
What? Oh, that's...

544
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:46,800
I called the clinic.

545
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:52,010
So, you've been on antidepressants
for over six months.

546
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,580
Why didn't you tell me?

547
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,610
And what is that?

548
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,580
You've been folding shopping bags
behind my back...

549
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,320
as a side job?

550
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:04,650
I couldn't just sit around
doing nothing.

551
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:09,730
Just in case I ever get to visit
Gyeong Hun in the US,

552
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:13,030
I've been working a part-time job
to save up for the trip.

553
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,700
What about the depression?

554
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:26,910
Dad, I'm so sorry.

555
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,650
I'm so sorry.

556
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,280
What do you have to be sorry for?

557
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:33,450
I'm the one who should be sorry.

558
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:42,460
Depression is no big deal.
It happens when you get old.

559
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:46,500
There's nothing exciting
or even anything to get angry about.

560
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,700
When you're raising your kids,

561
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,630
life is full of ups and downs,
you know?

562
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:53,570
I realize now
that's what kept me going.

563
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,040
Even when things are tough,
you keep living.

564
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,710
Even when it feels like
you're dying,

565
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:00,980
you somehow get through it.

566
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:02,710
But...

567
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:05,210
at my age,

568
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:07,480
nothing ever happens.

569
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:10,090
So you just naturally
start to feel down.

570
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:17,260
But you still should have told me.

571
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,060
I'm your daughter, Dad.

572
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,430
Why do everything by yourself?
Going to the clinic alone.

573
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,300
Dad, why are you really being
like this?

574
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,710
There's nothing anyone can do.

575
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:35,110
It's just my age.
The years catching up.

576
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:39,150
So you don't need to worry about me.

577
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:43,450
It's because I've lived too long
with nothing to do.

578
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,920
Dad.

579
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,930
Dad.

580
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,100
I'm sorry.

581
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:54,660
Dad...

582
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,080
Thanks.

583
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,450
You were really thorough
with the special provisions.

584
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:20,460
Hey, I actually heard an update
from Sung Guk.

585
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,460
With Boyang Construction.

586
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:24,890
Honestly, I didn't think
it would work out,

587
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,430
but you've already made it
over the hump.

588
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:27,900
We've still got a long way to go.

589
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,630
Hey, you're practically there.

590
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,640
Honestly, I never imagined
you'd get this far.

591
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:34,770
That's incredible, Lee Ji Hyuk.

592
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:40,410
Thank you, and...

593
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:43,010
I'm sorry.

594
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,920
Okay, "thanks" for the investment.

595
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:49,590
And what are you sorry for?

596
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:54,590
I confessed my feelings to Eun Oh.

597
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:56,290
I couldn't wait for you.

598
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:04,830
You got shot down, didn't you?

599
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,100
Yes.

600
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:12,240
So that's what it feels like
when you can't hold back.

601
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:16,750
You confessed even though
you knew she'd turn you down?

602
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,380
It just happened.

603
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:28,020
But don't feel bad on my account.

604
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,660
Because I'm not going
to confess to Eun Oh.

605
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,960
What?

606
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:38,330
I've thought long and hard
about why I even like Eun Oh.

607
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:42,240
Hey, do you remember
why we became friends?

608
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:45,570
The sneakers?

609
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:48,740
Hey, why are you bringing
that up now?

610
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,510
No, it's all related.

611
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,580
Now, you've got me curious.

612
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:54,850
Go on.

613
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,490
When they took my sneakers before,
I'd just give them up.

614
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:00,290
Three times to the three of them.

615
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:01,890
But...

616
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:04,230
I couldn't let them take
my sneakers that day.

617
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:06,730
Because my stepmother
deliberately made me wear them.

618
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,970
What's that supposed to mean?

619
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:12,700
She wanted my father to find out...

620
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:15,370
that I was being bullied.

621
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:17,110
Wear these today.

622
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:20,140
These are the limited-edition
collaboration sneakers.

623
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,810
Aren't they pretty?

624
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:25,050
I like wearing these.

625
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:28,280
I know your shoes got swapped
by mistake,

626
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,690
but you can't keep wearing
those worn-out shoes.

627
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:33,660
If your dad finds out,
you'll be in big trouble.

628
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:37,490
But these... They're too nice.

629
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:41,760
It's a foreign brand
kids don't know.

630
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,370
They just look fancy.

631
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:49,370
I won't tell him...

632
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:52,310
that you lost your shoes
several times.

633
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,640
I'll keep it a secret.

634
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:56,680
Seriously, not these ones.

635
00:42:57,310 --> 00:42:59,320
- If they find out I lost these...
- Then what?

636
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:01,050
Are you going to call your mommy?

637
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:03,350
I already gave you
three pairs of sneakers.

638
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:04,990
And they were all brand new.

639
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:07,420
Please, just not this pair.

640
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,290
I'll get you an extra 30 dollars
from my allowance on Monday.

641
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,660
- You punk.
- No. Please, no!

642
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:15,630
What do you mean, "no?" Come on!

643
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:17,970
And that's when you saved me.

644
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,240
You saved me
from my stepmother's trap,

645
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,810
and your parents showed me
what a real loving family is.

646
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:26,480
I was so envious.

647
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,650
Wait. She deliberately tried
to let your father know...

648
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:32,380
that you were being bullied?

649
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:33,850
But why?

650
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:36,990
You know how my father
hated me for being weak.

651
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,720
If he'd found out
his son was being bullied,

652
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:42,190
he would've stormed into school
and made a huge fuss.

653
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,160
Sure, the bullying might've stopped,
but...

654
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:46,960
my father would've become even more
controlling and suffocating,

655
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,200
and I would have ended up
on my stepmother's...

656
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:51,700
invisible leash.

657
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:53,970
That's right.

658
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:57,240
You did say
your stepmother was cold.

659
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,110
But I had no idea it was that bad.

660
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:00,580
And you know what's terrifying?

661
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:03,750
She smiles, but there's no warmth.
It's chilling.

662
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,020
And yet, she's perfect
at everything.

663
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:09,850
She even made someone like my father
trust her completely.

664
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:16,030
My whole life with my stepmother...

665
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:18,030
has been like walking on eggshells.

666
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,530
I can't let on that I hate her,

667
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:22,970
but I can't pretend
to like her either.

668
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:24,830
I'm scared she'll see through me.

669
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:28,940
Man...

670
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:31,470
It looks like you kept a lot
from me, too.

671
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:34,240
I mean, you should have
at least vented to me.

672
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,680
But then I met Ji Eun Oh.

673
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:40,520
From the moment I met her,
I knew Eun Oh was different.

674
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:42,620
It was winter at the time,

675
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,990
but she was so warm and comforting.

676
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:47,520
So bright and full of life.

677
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,060
She really was.

678
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:51,430
That's just who she is.

679
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:52,860
She really is.

680
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:55,600
I was just in awe of her.

681
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,700
I thought,
"I want to love someone like that."

682
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,700
"I wish a woman like her
could be mine."

683
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,910
But like you said,

684
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:06,110
it'd be long-distance,
so I couldn't say anything.

685
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:10,110
And I figured I didn't deserve her,
since I'm divorced.

686
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:12,150
And more than anything,

687
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:14,780
I was afraid she'd get dragged
into my family's messy drama.

688
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:17,690
I thought that's why I couldn't
bring myself to confess.

689
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:24,460
But it wasn't love.

690
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:27,630
I managed to hold back, after all.

691
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:31,430
Maybe...

692
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:35,470
I think I just liked
the idea of myself...

693
00:45:36,610 --> 00:45:37,610
being in love with someone.

694
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:46,080
So?

695
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:47,920
That's how I've sorted out
my feelings.

696
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:49,690
So what are you going to do?

697
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,990
I can't think straight.
It's too complicated.

698
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:55,720
Why?

699
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:57,230
You won't even talk to me about it?

700
00:45:58,330 --> 00:46:00,600
I only told you all this
to clear up the misunderstanding.

701
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:04,400
That's not the issue.

702
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:06,670
I'm cornered.

703
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,670
Then you'd better go all-in
on the AP acquisition.

704
00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:15,010
At least I have that, I guess.

705
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,410
Oh, right. The Preliminary Bid
is tomorrow, isn't it?

706
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:20,150
Just focus on your work.

707
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:22,120
I'm saying this as your friend,
not an investor.

708
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:25,390
All right.

709
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:26,990
I'll be in touch.

710
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,430
(Shoealls)

711
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:40,570
I feel relieved.

712
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,010
But it looks like
Ji Hyuk's in real trouble.

713
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:52,850
(Store Manager Choi In Sook)

714
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:56,690
- Hello, Park Seong Jae speaking.
- Director, what am I going to do?

715
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:58,820
I really don't know what to do
with Su Bin.

716
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:00,460
What's going on?

717
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,490
- Thank you.
- Have a good day.

718
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:03,630
Have a good one!

719
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:13,140
Su Bin. It's 6 p.m.

720
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,470
Thank you so much for today.
You were a great help with the rush.

721
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:20,540
Is it that late already?

722
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,950
We had so many customers,
I lost all track of time.

723
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:29,620
I was panicking about
that huge tour group booking.

724
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:32,790
It would've been a disaster
if you weren't here.

725
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:36,660
Min Ji, just let me know
if you need help again.

726
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:39,930
I learned so much from you.

727
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,860
Thanks again for your help.

728
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:49,540
Oh, this.

729
00:47:53,910 --> 00:47:55,940
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

730
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:07,060
- Great work today. Good night.
- You too. See you next time.

731
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,990
- Great work.
- You too.

732
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:16,230
We submitted
the Preliminary Bid today.

733
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:19,430
Oh, you did?

734
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:21,500
I really hope it goes well.

735
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,340
Why is he giving me a report?

736
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:31,180
Is he just clueless or what?

737
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:39,150
Hey, what's up?

738
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:41,420
Eun Oh.

739
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:43,990
There's something
I need to tell you.

740
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:45,590
What is it?

741
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:49,800
Remember I said Ji Hyuk offered me
a PR and marketing position?

742
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:52,500
A recruitment offer.

743
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:54,800
How about you run
our company's PR and marketing?

744
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,470
You learned filming and editing
to become a movie director, right?

745
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:00,280
And you wouldn't have to come in
every day.

746
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:03,350
It's full-time with benefits,
and you can work from home.

747
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:04,680
Work from home?

748
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,650
I wasn't expecting that.
That's really tempting.

749
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:13,060
But is that the only reason?
I mean, this is so out of the blue.

750
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,830
The company needs someone
for PR and marketing.

751
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:20,700
And I thought it'd be great for you
and Eun Oh to work together.

752
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:24,600
Since you two are so close.

753
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,040
Are you really going to
all this trouble for Eun Oh?

754
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:32,010
What? What are you talking about?

755
00:49:32,270 --> 00:49:34,810
Anyway, think it over
and let me know later.

756
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:38,780
That's when I knew.

757
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:41,220
That Ji Hyuk likes you.

758
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:47,120
I see.

759
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:51,760
Ji Eun Oh, I'm telling you,
Ji Hyuk likes you.

760
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:56,230
I know.

761
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:57,900
How?

762
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:01,500
Did Ji Hyuk actually confess to you?

763
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:02,900
My gosh.

764
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,640
How can you act like it's nothing?
Now that he's told you he likes you.

765
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:09,610
Su Jeong.

766
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:11,650
You once told me...

767
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:16,220
that when you like someone,
you get to know yourself better.

768
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:17,390
Yes.

769
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:21,320
I've learned a lot too,
after everything with Ji Hyuk.

770
00:50:21,790 --> 00:50:22,990
I've had a lot of realizations.

771
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:24,390
Like what?

772
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,230
That timing is everything.

773
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:29,900
That liking someone...

774
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,070
isn't always some huge,
dramatic thing.

775
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:35,470
And even if it felt
like a huge deal,

776
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:38,170
things can change over time.

777
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:43,610
A crush doesn't mean it'll work out.
And just because you like them,

778
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:48,780
it doesn't mean they're the one.
Stuff like that.

779
00:50:50,850 --> 00:50:52,790
So, what's your conclusion?

780
00:50:56,990 --> 00:50:58,630
From now on, Ji Hyuk and I...

781
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:01,500
I want us to go back
to being good friends like before.

782
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:06,600
But really? You don't have
any lingering feelings at all?

783
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,470
I mean, you used to hate him.

784
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,610
But there's a thin line
between love and hate.

785
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:15,210
I don't hate him anymore.

786
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:16,780
Not at all.

787
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:21,120
It's so ironic, though.

788
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:25,390
When we talked the other day,
you sounded like you had some news,

789
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:28,220
so I wondered if something was up
with you and Ji Hyuk.

790
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:32,960
I did have something
I wanted to talk to you about,

791
00:51:34,330 --> 00:51:35,330
but I've already made my decision.

792
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:36,630
About what?

793
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:42,540
(Guide to Requesting
Disclosure of Adoption Information)

794
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:48,740
(Ji Eun Oh has been confirmed
as having no known relatives.)

795
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:53,250
(Certificate of Genetic Testing
for Adoptee with No Known Kin)

796
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:57,490
So you have to take this
to the police station?

797
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:00,590
Yes.

798
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:08,660
Su Bin, here's your hourly pay
plus a bonus.

799
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,830
No, it's okay.

800
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:13,340
I wasn't expecting anything
for helping out.

801
00:52:13,870 --> 00:52:18,140
You boosted sales so much,
I can't just let it go unrewarded.

802
00:52:18,310 --> 00:52:19,310
Take it.

803
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:21,710
Wearing them is the best way
to thank me.

804
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:25,580
If you ever need an extra hand,
feel free to give me a call.

805
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:28,320
I'll get going.

806
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,550
- You got this.
- You too.

807
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:32,050
Go on.

808
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,200
Seong Jae.

809
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:49,940
(Shoealls)

810
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:00,880
Seong Jae!

811
00:53:04,090 --> 00:53:07,390
- Seong Jae!
- What?

812
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:10,630
You scared me. Why are you yelling?

813
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:12,430
You're the one making me yell!

814
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,460
Why don't you ever listen to me?

815
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:19,330
Why do you keep coming here?
I thought you said you'd quit.

816
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:21,970
I told you.
I'm training Min Ji to take over.

817
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:24,310
Why are you bothering with that?

818
00:53:24,810 --> 00:53:26,170
I told you to quit.

819
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:28,180
Did you forget you fought with her?

820
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:30,950
She formally apologized.

821
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:34,550
How can you be so naive?

822
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,450
And that's supposed to be an answer?

823
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:38,690
You said you'd quit,
but you keep showing up?

824
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:43,760
It was a really busy day
for the store,

825
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:45,690
so I was planning on this
being my last day.

826
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:47,960
Exactly. Why is that your problem?

827
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:49,930
Don't you have your own work to do?

828
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:53,500
Your channel is doing great,
and your subscribers have shot up.

829
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:56,300
You have your own thing going on,
so why do you keep coming here?

830
00:53:56,810 --> 00:53:58,410
Why are you making things
so hard on yourself?

831
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,280
That's what I'm wondering.

832
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:04,410
What?

833
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:07,420
Seriously,
why haven't I quit this place?

834
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,690
- Why couldn't I quit?
- Hey, listen.

835
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:13,860
It must be because of you.

836
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,160
What?

837
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:19,730
I...

838
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:21,960
I think I like you.

839
00:54:23,870 --> 00:54:24,870
Hey, Lee Su Bin.

840
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:27,400
I thought I was just working hard
because it's your company,

841
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:29,540
but that's not it.

842
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:33,510
When I'm here,
you sometimes come by,

843
00:54:33,610 --> 00:54:34,880
and we get to talk.

844
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:41,150
I like you, Seong Jae.

845
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:56,770
What is this?

846
00:54:57,570 --> 00:54:59,130
So, you've decided
to pivot back to me now?

847
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:01,900
Did I seem like an easier target
than the weirdos...

848
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:03,270
you met through
the matchmaking agency?

849
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:06,610
Is that why you dragged me out here?
Just to pull this stunt?

850
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:07,940
Are you done?

851
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:10,010
You're divorced.

852
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:15,120
My family is ordinary, so it's true
I wanted a man with good prospects.

853
00:55:15,950 --> 00:55:17,090
But I told you...

854
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:19,750
I wasn't just after money.

855
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:22,290
A divorced guy
wouldn't make the list.

856
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:24,290
No matter how rich they are,
divorced men...

857
00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:26,900
- are automatically out.
- Exactly.

858
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:29,960
So get a grip.

859
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,600
I am divorced.

860
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:37,440
I'm Ji Hyuk's friend,
and you're his youngest sister,

861
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:39,610
which makes you like a little sister
to me, too.

862
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:43,550
I don't care if your feelings
are genuine or not.

863
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:46,920
So if you ever say something
so ridiculous again,

864
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:50,090
I won't even see you
as Ji Hyuk's sister anymore.

865
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:52,690
So don't you ever...

866
00:55:58,130 --> 00:55:59,230
I'll take you home.

867
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:06,130
Never mind.

868
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:09,540
It's better
she just leaves like that.

869
00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:14,710
You fool.

870
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:18,080
She should be meeting a decent guy,
not some...

871
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:34,530
That kid,
saying such pointless things.

872
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:43,240
Still, should I have at least
made sure she ate?

873
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,110
This is your fault, Lee Su Bin.

874
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:54,950
- I'm home.
- Su Bin, you haven't eaten, right?

875
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:58,250
- I saved you a plate.
- I'm not eating.

876
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:53,680
Are you a burglar?

877
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:57,550
I heard footsteps pacing outside
and the doorknob rattling.

878
00:57:57,950 --> 00:57:59,050
Was that you?

879
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:03,280
Yes, I just had some things
to sort out in my head.

880
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:06,960
- Why are you out here? Come on in.
- Yes.

881
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:11,390
Eun Oh, what's wrong?

882
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,230
It's nothing.

883
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:16,900
I was actually planning
to wash my sneakers today.

884
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:18,900
See, Mom? I'm psychic.

885
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:23,240
Gang Oh washed your sneakers today.
He even washed mine.

886
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:25,640
You washed my sneakers?

887
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:29,580
Hey, what's gotten into you?

888
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:32,010
I learned a thing or two
after I left home and struggled.

889
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:35,820
You act all tough,
but you have a soft spot for us.

890
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:38,290
You should've kicked me out
ages ago.

891
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:41,760
I was bad at school
and didn't think to learn a trade.

892
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:43,160
I was obsessed
with getting rich quickly.

893
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:44,930
I started gambling online
in high school.

894
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:46,430
I just kept causing trouble.

895
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:50,370
If I had gotten a reality check
sooner,

896
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:52,770
I wouldn't have said
such horrible things to you.

897
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,540
At the end of the day,
it's just the three of us.

898
00:58:57,410 --> 00:58:58,410
Three?

899
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:05,010
- Gang Oh, what's gotten into you?
- She's right, Gang Oh.

900
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:09,580
This new act makes you look
even more suspicious. Knock it off.

901
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:12,050
I know.
Even I think I'm being weird.

902
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:14,320
They say people who mature too fast
are about to die.

903
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:17,760
The things you say.

904
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:24,530
It all just clicked for me that day.

905
00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:28,300
When those guys were treating me
like dirt at the bar,

906
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:30,040
you just appeared and saved me.

907
00:59:33,510 --> 00:59:35,510
I realized the only ones on my side
are family.

908
00:59:51,890 --> 00:59:52,890
Delivery!

909
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,830
Yeong Ra, stay put.

910
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:01,370
No, it's a real delivery.

911
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:04,140
I got a text that a package arrived.

912
01:00:08,810 --> 01:00:09,840
What is this?

913
01:00:10,510 --> 01:00:11,510
Listen.

914
01:00:11,950 --> 01:00:14,420
You know my mom put a GPS tracker
on my car, right?

915
01:00:15,150 --> 01:00:16,620
There's one on your phone, too.

916
01:00:17,590 --> 01:00:20,460
Can you put this tracker
on my mom's car for me?

917
01:00:21,290 --> 01:00:22,290
What?

918
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:23,960
On Director Ko's car?

919
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:25,560
Yes.

920
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,260
First, I need to figure out
where she's going.

921
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:31,800
How are you feeling?

922
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,400
Don't just lie there.
Try to move around a little.

923
01:00:34,670 --> 01:00:38,440
- You need strength for the surgery.
- I know. I took a walk and...

924
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:43,640
I'm sitting down now.
I got a little tired.

925
01:00:44,110 --> 01:00:45,110
Are you outside?

926
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:47,080
So you did go for a walk.

927
01:00:47,350 --> 01:00:50,790
I said to get some air by the door.
Get back inside.

928
01:00:50,850 --> 01:00:53,820
Seriously, what if you catch a cold?
What would you do?

929
01:00:54,290 --> 01:00:55,420
Okay, I get it.

930
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:57,630
I'll see you
at your next hospital appointment.

931
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:01,930
Mom.

932
01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:05,030
I told you not to worry.
How many times must you ask?

933
01:01:06,970 --> 01:01:08,670
I'll tell you more at your checkup.

At the end of the day,
it's just the three of us.

936
01:01:19,110 --> 01:01:20,350
It all just clicked for me that day.

937
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:24,220
I realized the only ones on my side
are family.

938
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:29,260
Yes.

939
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:34,330
What's up?

940
01:01:35,330 --> 01:01:36,330
Ji Eun Oh.

941
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:38,100
Get a DNA test.

942
01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:41,440
You have to do it for your own sake.

943
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,070
It's not for your birth parents,
whoever they may be,

944
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:46,570
but for yourself, so this doesn't...

945
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:48,510
keep eating away at you.

946
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:54,520
- I'll decide what to do.
- I know you don't want me meddling,

947
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:56,680
but I've already been through this,

948
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:58,120
so let me just say this.

949
01:01:59,020 --> 01:02:00,460
If you don't go through
with the DNA registration,

950
01:02:01,290 --> 01:02:02,960
you'll spend your life
wondering if...

951
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,160
your birth mom is looking for you.

952
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:06,030
It'll be agonizing.

953
01:02:06,530 --> 01:02:08,230
But let's say you register your DNA.

954
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:10,430
If you end up finding
your birth parents,

955
01:02:10,930 --> 01:02:13,200
you'll be able to end
their suffering.

956
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:15,170
But...

957
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:18,310
- if no match comes up...
- Then it means I was abandoned.

958
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:19,840
Even if that's true,

959
01:02:20,710 --> 01:02:22,110
that doesn't have to define
your life.

960
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:24,880
You already have...

961
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:27,010
parents.

962
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:30,220
So this is...

963
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:32,150
something you need to do
for yourself.

964
01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:34,560

I'm here for
the Family Search DNA Registration.

970
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:12,460
You've filled out the consent form,
but I just need to double-check.

971
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:17,470
Do you consent
to the sample collection?

01:03:56,070 --> 01:03:58,270

does that make her a decent person?

976
01:03:58,340 --> 01:04:00,810
Just go on 3 dates with me.
Please? Just 3.

977

That's all it takes to see
if there's something between us.

978

Eun Oh, Gang Oh's in trouble.

979
01:04:05,910 --> 01:04:07,680
I shouldn't have registered my DNA.

- The company could take a big hit.

I heard his acquisition failed!
Ji Hyuk's company went bankrupt!

What did you say?
