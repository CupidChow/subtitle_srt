1
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,110
You should...

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,380
marry me, Ji Hyuk.

3
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:11,880
What?

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,220
Marry me.

5
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:16,820
What got into you?

6
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,620
I'm not asking you to marry me...

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,360
because I don't know
you announced to everyone...

8
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:24,560
that you won't marry.

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,730
I'm so flabbergasted
that I don't want to respond.

10
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:29,200
If this is nonsense, quit it.

11
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,670
If you have an ulterior motive,
just say it.

12
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,010
I will respond
after hearing the whole thing.

13
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,840
You know, I've been in love before.

14
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,150
Seriously enough to risk my life.

15
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,120
I thought
I'd never be able to forget him.

16
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,620
I mean, I loved him so much...

17
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:52,090
that I decided to stay with him
for the rest of my life.

18
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:58,160
If I knew where he was,
I'd want to run to him right away.

19
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,030
I was in love
that had so many lingering regrets.

20
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,440
But just because I love him,
it doesn't mean I can be with him.

21
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,270
You know that.

22
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,140
Now that the man I love is gone,

23
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,510
I have no choice
but to give up on love,

24
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,980
but I don't want to give up
the background offered by my father.

25
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,790
I think you want...

26
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,120
to stay single
because the losses outweigh...

27
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,720
the gains from marriage.

28
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,360
Are you done?

29
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,890
I agree with you, Ji Hyuk.

30
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,100
Now, I know that
marriage isn't just about love.

31
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:37,000
That's why I'm suggesting a deal.

32
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,640
Why would you refuse to get married
when you could gain a lot from it?

33
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,680
It's not like
I want us to be lovebirds.

34
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,880
But still...

35
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,310
You wanted to stay single
because you thought...

36
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,480
you wouldn't find someone to love?

37
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,480
That's not it, right?

38
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,750
Then there's no reason
not to marry without love.

39
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:58,720
Besides, you are not
the type of person who loves anyone.

40
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,790
You say
you can control your feelings.

41
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,970
What is it that...

42
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,940
I get from this marriage
at this point?

43
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,740
Should I start
negotiating or something?

44
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,740
I'm the only daughter
of the Haneul Construction family.

45
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,950
My father, CEO Jung Ho Yeong,

46
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,550
has his ironclad rule
of not letting a woman...

47
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,880
take over control of the company.

48
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,050
You are already aware of that.

49
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,790
Because there were
rumors going around.

50
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,760
And who knows?

51
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,190
We might develop feelings
for each other...

52
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,390
while living together.

53
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,360
Then we could be a real couple.

54
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,000
Or...

55
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,170
we could get a divorce.

56
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,070
After my father passes away.

57
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,040
I don't know
when that will be, though.

58
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,340
Aren't you laying your cards
on the table too easily?

59
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,650
So, you know
that I'm not just saying this.

60
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,950
I'll give you some time
to think about it, then.

61
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,520
I'll see you here next week.

62
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,510
(Episode 4)

63
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,140
I've never seen anything like that
in my life.

64
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,890
Hello, Father.

65
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:40,560
Ji Hyuk, do you have plans
for tonight after work?

66
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,130
You knew?

67
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,900
No. I don't have any plans.

68
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,900
Then meet me outside after work.

69
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,240
Where should I go?

70
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,570
Should I go to Mr. Yeong Bo's place?

71
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,180
- Here.
- Hey.

72
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,410
I'll pour my own drink.

73
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,280
Don't take the fun away from me.

74
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,980
We haven't done this
for a long time.

75
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,550
I know.

76
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,420
All right.

77
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,760
Gosh, I'm so jealous.

78
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,420
You have a son
who can drink with you.

79
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,300
Mr. Choi has terminal cancer.

80
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,900
That's why it turned out this way.

81
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,040
I see.

82
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,600
His son is quite young.

83
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,740
So he probably thinks differently
from his father.

84
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:32,740
He was acting all condescending,
so I taught him a lesson.

85
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:35,980
I see.

86
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,050
I'm meeting with people
in the industry now.

87
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,920
I believe I'll get a job soon.

88
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:44,020
I was going to tell you
the whole thing after that.

89
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,290
Okay.

90
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:48,760
Do Ji Wan and Su Bin know too?

91
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,100
Not yet.

92
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,330
I think you should tell them
as soon as possible.

93
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,300
No.
I'll tell them after I get a job.

94
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,940
I don't want to disappoint them.

95
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,810
We don't know when it will be.

96
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,170
What?

97
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,180
Finding a new job
after retirement isn't so easy.

98
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,010
Pull yourself together.

99
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,880
That's what happens
after you retire.

100
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,950
That's reality.

101
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,550
Right.

102
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,290
It's not easy. It will be hard.

103
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,560
It's not like I don't know that.

104
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:24,330
I have a lot of colleagues...

105
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,160
who left the company before me...

106
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,030
and are now struggling
with harsh realities.

107
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,500
Still, I was hired
by another company...

108
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,570
even before my retirement.

109
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,070
There must be a reason for that.

110
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,880
I'll tell Ji Wan and Su Bin
about this.

111
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,380
Mom and Grandma
will have a hard time...

112
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,650
pretending everything's fine.

113
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:43,850
Don't say anything.

114
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,820
Don't tell Ji Wan and Su Bin.

115
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,850
And don't show it
to your mom and grandma.

116
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,990
It's not the kind of thing
that should be kept secret.

117
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,960
It's something
that happens to everyone.

118
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,930
Try as we might,
but we're just employees.

119
00:05:55,790 --> 00:06:00,000
Don't be so quick to assume
that your dad will end up like that.

120
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,740
It's not like we have to worry
about living expenses now.

121
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,440
You have your job.

122
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,640
And Ji Wan doesn't need my support.

123
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,240
I just need to support Su Bin.
What's there to worry about?

124
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,440
I'm telling you
it'll take 2 to 3 months at most.

125
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,920
Where are you planning to work?

126
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,550
Of course,
it's the textile industry.

127
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,220
It doesn't have to be
the same industry.

128
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,360
Keep your options open.

129
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:29,430
Come on.
I'll take care of it myself.

130
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,530
Where do you spend your time
outside?

131
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:33,970
Where do you think?

132
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,170
I'm busy meeting people
in the industry...

133
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,640
and asking for a job.

134
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,840
I go hiking sometimes.

135
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,240
I also go for a game of pool
here and there.

136
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,940
I meet my friends from college too.

137
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,650
- Here.
- Okay.

138
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,850
Oh, dear.

139
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,420
How long has it been since
we last walked together like this?

140
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,320
It's been a long time.

141
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:01,890
Hey.

142
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:05,230
By the way,
why am I looking up at you now?

143
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,030
It feels like just yesterday
I was looking down at you.

144
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,470
That was a long time ago.

145
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,940
It's been a million years
since I got taller than you.

146
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,210
Really?

147
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,580
Fine. You're tall.

148
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,350
Of course. I'm your son, aren't I?

149
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,550
(Jung Hyeon Su Architecture Lab)

150
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,150
Do you mind if I leave now?

151
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,660
I need to run.

152
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,830
If you can't hide how upset you are,

153
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,570
you'd be better off
quitting the cafe.

154
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,720
Fine, Lee Ji Hyuk.
I will forget everything.

155
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,630
I'll end things completely.

156
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,330
I've thought all about it.

157
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:17,940
Do you think
I haven't thought about it?

158
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,570
Why don't I deserve to be with you?

159
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,940
Because I'm not feminine?
Because I don't dress myself up?

160
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,510
Because I have a bad personality
or a strong personality?

161
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,210
Because we have different tastes?

162
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,110
That wasn't the case.

163
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,450
Then the only reason remaining is...

164
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,420
Because of my background?

165
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:36,750
Because I'm from a poor family?

166
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,960
Because I don't make good money?

167
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,960
That can't be the reason.

168
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,860
You don't want to get married.

169
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,060
You have no reason
to care about my background...

170
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,900
when you have no intention
of getting married.

171
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,040
What on earth is it?

172
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,940
I don't know
why you are not telling me.

173
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,880
(Buy 8 cans of beer
and get 3 dollars cash back.)

174
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,680
No.

175
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,220
I won't drown my sorrows in drink.

176
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,490
I can get over it myself.

177
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,900
Oh, dear.

178
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,470
We have ginseng wine
left over from the ancestral rite.

179
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,690
I saw Gang Oh
make highballs in secret.

180
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,890
I feel so weird.

181
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,390
My leg hurts.

182
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,220
This is killing me.

183
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,030
Isn't that your sister?

184
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,430
- I think it is.
- Oh, no.

185
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,230
What...

186
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,400
Eun Oh.

187
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,230
My gosh.

188
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,440
- Eun Oh.
- Ji Eun Oh.

189
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,910
My goodness. Eun Oh!

190
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,280
Da Jeong.

191
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,750
When people say,

192
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,580
"The elderly are welcome,"

193
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,520
what age range do they mean?

194
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,990
Where are they welcome?

195
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,560
I was walking by...

196
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,090
a restaurant or something,

197
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,430
and they were looking for help.

198
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,030
Wouldn't they mean 65 years old?

199
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:07,730
People aged 65 and over
can use public transport for free.

200
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,740
Sixty-five?

201
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,810
They're babies compared to you,

202
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,080
if they're 65.

203
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:39,330
(Library Village)

204
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:59,850
How much did she drink
and how hungover is she...

205
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,090
that you called a part-timer?

206
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:04,120
She was at the ER all night.

207
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,190
She passed out after drinking...

208
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,390
way too many
different kinds of liquor,

209
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,060
and they pumped her stomach
thinking she'd overdosed.

210
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:16,600
On top of that,
she's overworked and fatigued,

211
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,500
so she needs to take
a week or so off.

212
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,680
(Park Seong Jae)

213
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,860
Ji Hyuk.
I think Eun Oh is really sick.

214
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,760
She went to the ER.

215
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:54,170
(Incoming call: Park Seong Jae)

216
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:59,710
So what?

217
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,250
What?

218
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,580
I got the text about Eun Oh.

219
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,280
Where is she now?

220
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,520
She's resting at home.

221
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,590
She's fine, then.

222
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,390
Bye.

223
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,520
Hey.

224
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,040
Yes, sir.

225
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,070
Call Yurim Korean Medicine Clinic,
please.

226
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,070
(Apple mangoes)

227
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:06,680
Goodness.

228
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,150
Eun Oh.

229
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:12,620
Someone sent you
some expensive gongjindan.

230
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,820
My gosh.

231
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,520
There's fruit and tea as well,

232
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,260
not to mention various snacks.

233
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:19,890
Hang on.

234
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:22,690
"Park Seong Jae."

235
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:24,760
Who's this?

236
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,430
(Get well soon.
From Park Seong Jae.)

237
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:28,870
Get well soon.

238
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,900
A cafe regular.

239
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,140
What?

240
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:34,970
You never run out of things to eat.

241
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,570
Someone sent bread
from a new bakery.

242
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:37,780
They must know you well.

243
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,380
You can have it.

244
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,850
- What?
- For real? Thank you.

245
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,450
Don't touch it.

246
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,850
Let her pick first.
You can eat later.

247
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:49,220
Eun Oh. You had some porridge.

248
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:52,060
Pick out what bread you want
and eat it when you feel like it.

249
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,820
Take a bite at least.

250
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,530
- Sit up.
- My gosh.

251
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,200
Here.

252
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:02,500
Pick something out.

253
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,210
My goodness.

254
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:12,840
They have bread
shaped like a coal briquette?

255
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,780
They're serious about marketing.

256
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,820
- Look at what they wrote.
- What?

257
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,850
"We hope the sweet aroma..."

258
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,390
"is deeply comforting."

259
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,690
I'm getting goosebumps.

260
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,200
You can take those.

261
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:35,670
Oh, dear. Lie down and rest.

262
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,310
Do you have a fever?

263
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,720
Mr. Lee.

264
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,890
My knees hurt so bad.

265
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:00,320
Your feet are almost parallel.

266
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,560
Stand so your toes face outward.

267
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,900
Keep them shoulder-width apart,

268
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,330
and go straight down.

269
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,630
When you squat,

270
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,930
you want to feel
your hip joints fold.

271
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,070
When you get up,

272
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:14,340
use your thighs and glutes.

273
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,010
Where are my glutes?

274
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:19,110
Your glutes are right...

275
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,580
Right here?

276
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:24,920
What?

277
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,220
What are you doing?

278
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,140
I apologize.

279
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,340
Hey.

280
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,210
You refuse female clients
because of your girlfriend...

281
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,740
when she isn't even watching,

282
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,410
and you won't even touch them
when helping them exercise.

283
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,050
What kind of instructor does that?

284
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:00,220
That wasn't
because of my girlfriend.

285
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,090
That's just what I'm like.

286
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:03,390
Pack your things.

287
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,690
I can't quit when I have clients...

288
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,390
Report me to the Ministry of Labor.

289
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,630
No, sir. I'll pack my things.

290
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,110
Why did I even buy you?

291
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,930
(Calling: Lee Ji Hyuk)

292
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,340
The person is not answering.

293
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,080
Don't run!

294
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,080
Come here. I'm so sorry.

295
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,750
Jeong Eun.

296
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,200
I want to be alone for a while.

297
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,400
I'll be in touch.

298
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,180
What do you think?

299
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,550
It's a lovely early-summer look.

300
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:15,090
Sleeveless tops
are for midsummer only?

301
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,990
No.

302
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:22,430
A true fashion-forward person...

303
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,430
dresses ahead of the season.

304
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,600
Cut. Okay, good.

305
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:33,340
It's so cold.

306
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,910
Darn, it's freezing.

307
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,180
Is this even necessary
when it's freezing outside?

308
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,580
I said we should film
once it got warmer.

309
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:46,620
You have goosebumps
all over your body.

310
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,390
I'm fine.

311
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,750
I could shave my own skin
if it came down to it.

312
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:52,320
I'm going to gain more subscribers.

313
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,290
Never will I be humiliated
like that again.

314
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:58,400
I have to ask.
Suppose you marry a rich guy...

315
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,330
after reaching
70,000 to 80,000 subscribers.

316
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:02,200
Where does that leave me?

317
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:03,730
Ha Eun, come on.

318
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,470
And you call yourself my friend?

319
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,840
I'm not doing this
just to marry a rich guy.

320
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,810
Why else did you join
a matchmaking service...

321
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,210
when we're only 24?

322
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,510
Well,

323
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,550
that's where all the wealthy
and capable men are.

324
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:20,250
And men like women
who are young and pretty.

325
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,520
That's exactly what I said.

326
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,860
It's not.

327
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,790
I won't marry a guy
just for his money.

328
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:31,060
I'll marry someone
who's "also" rich.

329
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,630
To do that, I need something
to show for myself...

330
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:36,430
other than looks, youth,
and a toned body.

331
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,100
That being said,

332
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:42,510
give this channel your all
without any worries.

333
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,340
I'll make sure we hit
a million subscribers.

334
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,010
Sure.

335
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,510
I'll change into a different outfit.

336
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:50,280
(Cook wanted)

337
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,690
(Age limit: 70)

338
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,780
Why is Da Jeong's father
in this neighborhood?

339
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,450
We should hurry.
We only have until 1 p.m.

340
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,550
I know.

341
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,570
Hello, Mr. Lee Ji Hyuk.

342
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,970
Congratulations on becoming
an assistant manager at SSP Company.

343
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:25,640
I knew it.

344
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:30,950
I'm starting out again
as an assistant manager.

345
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,730
Darn it.

346
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,600
That shocked me to the core.

347
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,700
Shoot.

348
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,470
Should I just go home?

349
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,580
Ji Wan, why are you home so early?

350
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,190
Oh, right.

351
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:09,890
My client canceled our session
for today.

352
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:14,220
If you keep working out like that,
you'll gain thicker thighs,

353
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:15,660
not a booty.

354
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:16,930
Why did you hit me?

355
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:19,400
Anyway,
why the sudden weight training?

356
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,870
Hey, you said you'd give me
free training sessions at your gym.

357
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,970
I'll start tomorrow.

358
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,970
Oh, that?

359
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,140
You see...

360
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:34,810
Ji Wan, don't tell me...

361
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,110
you quit again.

362
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,790
Hey, what's the matter
with old ladies?

363
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:44,390
I was going to tell you...

364
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:46,690
to start giving Mom
living expenses next month.

365
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,460
Why?

366
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,690
Why do I need to give her money?

367
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,530
Dad's job offer at Seongil Weaving
was canceled.

368
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:00,200
It was canceled?

369
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,610
He hasn't been able to tell us...

370
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:06,280
and goes out each day
searching for a job.

371
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,150
Su Bin, don't tell the family
I was home.

372
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,850
It's one hurdle after another.

373
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:16,450
Our family's in trouble.

374
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,860
How come Ji Hyuk is
the only normal one around here?

375
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:25,660
What do I do?

376
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,070
I still need to pay the lease
for this car.

377
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,070
It's not like
I can borrow money from Mom.

378
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:38,010
Lee Ji Wan, you crazy fool.

379
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,810
How can you even think
about borrowing money...

380
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,350
when you leased this car
just to impress a girl?

381
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:47,220
On top of that,
your dad is jobless now!

382
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:51,620
If you hear back
after applying for a job,

383
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,590
you'll take it
regardless of the position.

384
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,730
Got it?

385
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,260
Nod if you understand.

386
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,640
(Deposit: 1,000 dollars,
Lee Ji Hyuk)

387
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:13,880
What? Ji Hyuk wired 1,000 dollars.

388
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:17,780
(My eldest son)

389
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:21,120
Yes, Mother.

390
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,020
Hey, Ji Hyuk.

391
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:26,190
You must've made a mistake
and wired me 1,000 dollars.

392
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,260
It wasn't a mistake.

393
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,990
Wasn't it?

394
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:32,360
Why did you wire 500 dollars more?

395
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,860
No reason.

396
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,030
As if that makes sense.

397
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,470
I know...

398
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,410
Dad's job offer was canceled.

399
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,740
Oh, dear. You knew?

400
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:48,780
How did you find out?

401
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:50,880
By accident.

402
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:54,350
Use that to cover
our living expenses...

403
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,590
until Dad finds a new job.

404
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:59,190
Come on. This isn't necessary.

405
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,090
I'd feel better, that's all.

406
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,330
Anyway, I'll hang up now.

407
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:05,960
Oh, sure.

408
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:12,940
How did he find out?

409
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,540
This sure feels strange.

410
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,450
Actually, no. I feel relieved,
like a weight has been lifted.

411
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,180
Why do you feel relieved?

412
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:28,920
You're home early today.

413
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,890
Why are you relieved,

414
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:32,760
and what made you startle
at my presence?

415
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:35,090
Oh, that.

416
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:37,760
Well...

417
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,400
Father.

418
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,100
We need to talk.

419
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,220
You.

420
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:04,150
How can you be so careless?

421
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,660
I told you to ignore it...

422
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,320
since I'll get a job
in a month or two.

423
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:09,860
Why didn't you listen to me?

424
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,800
There's my position to consider.

425
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,230
What about the position you're in?

426
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,500
No one asked you
to worry about living expenses.

427
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,070
I'm the father
and the breadwinner of this house.

428
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,700
I didn't give her the money
to help you out.

429
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,110
What?

430
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,740
I gave her
more than I normally do...

431
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,510
to give her stability.

432
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,310
It didn't sit right with me.

433
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:30,910
It killed me to see her
act like this wasn't affecting her.

434
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,880
How can you go behind my back
just to feel at ease?

435
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,690
So that your pride isn't hurt,

436
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,150
do Grandma, Mom, I,

437
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:39,290
and even you have to act
like everything's fine?

438
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,590
Like you're set to start work soon?

439
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,430
I believe you'll find...

440
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,300
another job.

441
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,330
Still, that may take a while.

442
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,870
Longer than you realize.

443
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:55,740
And having your job offer canceled?

444
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:57,740
That isn't a big deal.

445
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,180
Not in this day and age.

446
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,440
This could happen to anyone,

447
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:04,050
and you were just unlucky.

448
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,620
So,

449
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,990
you don't have to make us
tiptoe around you.

450
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,520
You brat.

451
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:43,690
I'll call you
when your food is ready.

452
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:44,990
Okay.

453
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,460
Are you sure you're all right?

454
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,230
I told you
to take two more days off.

455
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,900
I'm totally fine, times a hundred.

456
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,930
Okay? I'm sick of saying this.

457
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,770
You had such a hard time
that you got dead drunk.

458
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,770
I just tried to drink it all away.

459
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:05,880
So did it work?

460
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,550
Are you feeling better now?

461
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:13,720
I'll be fine.
Now, I know the reason.

462
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,420
What reason?

463
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,220
The reason I felt so flustered...

464
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,590
and embarrassed
when Ji Hyuk turned me down.

465
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:23,360
So, why? What's the reason?

466
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,300
Su Jeong.

467
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,000
Didn't Ji Hyuk come today?

468
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:30,630
Ji Hyuk didn't come.

469
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:31,630
Instead...

470
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,810
Eun Oh.

471
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,350
You know,

472
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,520
even if he'd reject me,

473
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,990
I thought
he'd still give me a chance.

474
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:51,120
So...

475
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,860
I never thought
about what would happen next.

476
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,490
"What happens after he rejects me?"

477
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,960
That thought never crossed my mind.

478
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,070
I just thought...

479
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:06,540
I wanted to tell him
about my feelings.

480
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,510
You...

481
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:12,480
trusted Ji Hyuk.

482
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,310
I guess I did. What a fool.

483
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,710
I was mistaken.

484
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,380
So after he rejected me,

485
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,950
I was flustered and confused,
not knowing what to do.

486
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:26,560
That's why I was being pathetic.

487
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,430
I was being so lame.

488
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,230
How are you feeling now?

489
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,330
I accepted it and gave up on him.

490
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,970
I'll try...

491
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,440
to go back
to how things were before.

492
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,370
Can you do that?

493
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,440
I have to.

494
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,880
I caused this trouble by myself.

495
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:49,810
It's not a situation
I can call fortunate,

496
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,480
but I'm still glad to hear that.

497
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,250
I know.

498
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:02,190
I should go check out the cafe
that I renovated. It's newly opened.

499
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:05,560
- Are you done talking?
- Yes.

500
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,870
I have a question for you, Mr. Park.

501
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:12,340
Why did you keep asking me
if Ji Hyuk stopped by all week?

502
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,070
Isn't he answering his phone?
Did you two fight?

503
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,240
Is something wrong with Ji Hyuk?

504
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,410
There's something I'm worried about.

505
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,740
What is it?

506
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:24,680
I can't tell you that.

507
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:27,320
Mr. Park, is it that...

508
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,790
you have a crush on him?

509
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,650
Is that why you're single?

510
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:32,820
Hey.

511
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,820
You mean, Ji Hyuk?

512
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:37,890
My goodness.

513
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,060
I can say...

514
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:45,100
that he's my second favorite person
in the world.

515
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,200
If he's
your second favorite person...

516
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,770
when you don't have a girlfriend...

517
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,880
When I was about to wither away,

518
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,580
he was like a stream of water to me.

519
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:58,010
He was the first person
to stand by me.

520
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,550
I didn't know
you two had such an eventful past.

521
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,370
Hey.

522
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,040
Why are you using
the back gate today?

523
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:32,720
Seong Jae,
I told you not to do that.

524
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,250
You don't have to be afraid of us.

525
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,960
You came wearing new sneakers
to give them to me.

526
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:40,560
Why would we bully you?

527
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:44,630
Seong Jae.

528
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:48,200
Wear these today.

529
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:51,300
These are the limited-edition
collaboration sneakers.

530
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,600
Aren't they pretty?

531
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:56,470
I like wearing these.

532
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,810
What are you talking about?

533
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:02,480
How would I let you
wear them to school?

534
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,710
I know your shoes got swapped
by mistake,

535
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,380
but you can't keep wearing
those worn-out shoes.

536
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,250
If your dad finds out,
you'll be in big trouble.

537
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,890
I won't tell him...

538
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:19,700
that you lost your shoes
several times.

539
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:21,060
I'll keep it a secret.

540
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:25,270
Here. Put these on.

541
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:27,840
- You brat.
- No.

542
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,910
No.

543
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:31,240
What do you mean, no? You little...

544
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,280
Hey. Let him up.

545
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:36,310
Darn it.

546
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:40,580
Park Seong Jae.

547
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,190
Take off your shoes.

548
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,520
Hey!

549
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:49,060
That's enough.

550
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,830
You let him run errands
every morning,

551
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:51,960
steal his shoes,

552
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,230
and even take money from him
every Monday. Isn't that enough?

553
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,070
Look at you.

554
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:59,170
Lee Ji Hyuk, you nerd.

555
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:00,740
You're not watching your mouth
because you get good grades?

556
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,110
He's in my class,
and I'm the class president.

557
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:06,510
So what? You are the class president
only at school.

558
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,850
Are you the president
of the neighborhood or what?

559
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:10,750
Hey.

560
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:14,820
- Trample on him.
- You are so cool, Go Dae Yong.

561
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:16,990
Why?

562
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:20,090
Can't you beat me on your own?

563
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,260
What?

564
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:27,200
If you want to fight,
do it man-to-man.

565
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:29,430
You pathetic coward, Go Dae Yong.

566
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:31,670
You can't deal with me
on your own, can you?

567
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:32,800
Lee Ji Hyuk, you...

568
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:34,870
Is something wrong
with your brain today?

569
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:35,970
Just answer me.

570
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,710
Let's fight one-on-one.

571
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,710
Lee Ji Hyuk, don't regret it
even if you die today.

572
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:42,750
I'll smash you to bits.

573
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,180
If you lose to me,

574
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,720
don't mess with Park Seong Jae
ever again.

575
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,250
- Hey.
- Go easy on him.

576
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:49,190
- Cool.
- Nice.

577
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:01,430
Hey.

578
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,110
What? Stop it already!

579
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:29,830
Let go. Get off me.

580
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:30,830
Hey.

581
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,870
Hey, Go Dae Yong!

582
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:38,570
Hey! Wake up.

583
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:40,000
- Darn it.
- Hey.

584
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,800
He's no big deal. Let's go.

585
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,710
- Hey, wake up.
- What's wrong with him?

586
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:47,680
Did you all see that?

587
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:51,380
You can't mess
with Park Seong Jae anymore.

588
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,680
Shut it.

589
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,050
It's not like you got hit.

590
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:58,890
Darn it.

591
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,800
He was a good person back then too.

592
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:12,870
But why did you let them
bully you like that?

593
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,040
Were you too scared?

594
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,080
I guess I was.

595
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,320
I should get going.

596
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:54,910
(Park Seong Jae)

597
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:56,380
Let me ease your worries.

598
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:58,050
Eun Oh came to work today.

599
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,220
You rascal.

600
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,320
That's a relief.

601
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:10,760
(Congratulations on your opening.
From Eunoism Design)

602
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,460
You didn't have to bring this.

603
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,830
Congratulations.

604
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:15,460
Thank you.

605
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,930
This space is crazy.

606
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:20,540
- Really?
- People are posting...

607
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:22,240
photos of this on social media.

608
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,160
I thought...

609
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,770
the wheel seemed familiar.

610
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:52,030
I heard you were sick.

611
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,900
I knew you'd be like that.

612
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,640
You shouldn't skip meals.

613
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:58,810
You're annoying.

614
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:00,980
I guess I am.

615
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:03,810
Are you feeling better?

616
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,520
After getting some good rest,

617
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,050
I feel even better
than before I got sick.

618
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:10,950
Where have you been?

619
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:13,460
The cafe I renovated is open.

620
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,090
I went there to deliver a gift...

621
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:16,660
and check on any issues.

622
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:18,490
When does the next project begin?

623
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,260
I don't have any plans yet.

624
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:33,240
By the way, I got an email
from our university juniors.

625
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:36,450
They came up with 30 ideas...

626
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:38,510
because it's our 30th anniversary.

627
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:41,650
Are they going to skip
lectures and exams...

628
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,890
and spend...

629
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:45,090
the whole semester doing club stuff?

630
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:46,720
It's just a club, not a calling.

631
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,460
That's exactly what you were like.

632
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:52,960
That was because
I was thinking of...

633
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,860
becoming an interior designer.

634
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,230
They want to redo two places
this time...

635
00:39:57,330 --> 00:39:59,070
during the whole summer vacation.

636
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:02,000
I don't mind
drawing the floor plans,

637
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,870
but we'll need to blackmail
the technical majors, right?

638
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:08,410
Eun Oh.

639
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:17,090
Don't try too hard.

640
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:20,260
- What?
- To keep talking.

641
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:22,660
You don't have to.

642
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:27,530
I always talked a bit too much
whenever...

643
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:28,830
we were going somewhere.

644
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:30,230
Not this much, though.

645
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,200
You took time to breathe.

646
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:34,970
Did I?

647
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:39,440
You can be so mean sometimes.

648
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,810
You're too honest.

649
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:43,080
Not all the time.

650
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,480
I'm mostly honest.

651
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:51,050
But sometimes,
I pretend to be honest.

652
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,560
When you do pretend to be honest?

653
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:59,500
When I need to.
When I feel uncomfortable.

654
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,900
When I'm a coward.

655
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:07,000
You're like that too.

656
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:10,640
We're all human.

657
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:13,540
Do you think some are different?

658
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,980
You fool.

659
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:31,030
Go on inside.

660
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:34,230
You're not coming to the cafe?

661
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,330
Seong Jae told me
you were back at work.

662
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,630
I dropped by to see you.

663
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:40,570
I see.

664
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:46,010
The next guy you choose...

665
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:50,050
should be kind,
not simply someone you like.

666
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:53,150
Liking someone is about feelings,

667
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:54,820
and feelings...

668
00:41:57,690 --> 00:41:58,750
are powerless.

669
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:09,870
That's some cool-sounding advice.

670
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,200
Eat regularly. You've lost weight.

671
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:19,040
Okay.

672
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:22,280
Take care, Ji Hyuk.

673
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:05,960
Would you like to order?

674
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,020
Not exactly.

675
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:10,860
Is this your design portfolio?

676
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:12,390
No, it's not mine.

677
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:14,860
Here she is. It's hers.

678
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:17,270
Aren't you...

679
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,700
Are you...

680
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,540
Hello. Do you feel better?

681
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,080
It really is you
from the subway station.

682
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,180
I'm fine, thanks to you.

683
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:31,110
That's good to hear.

684
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:33,050
Eun Oh. Do you know her?

685
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,820
- Well...
- I was curious about this designer.

686
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:37,450
It was you.

687
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:39,390
Well, yes.

688
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,960
If you don't mind,
could we perhaps talk for a bit?

689
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:46,160
Well...

690
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:47,660
It's quiet right now.

691
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:50,330
I can spare a few minutes.

692
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:04,410
I didn't know you had company.

693
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:06,120
Our business was done.

694
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:13,120
I accepted it...

695
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,720
and gave up on him. I'll try...

696
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,430
to go back
to how things were before.

697
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:21,830
You care about Eun Oh so much.

698
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:24,300
Why did you make her ask me out
and get hurt?

699
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,200
Whenever I tried to approach Eun Oh,

700
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,100
you tried to stop me.

701
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:30,940
You said I couldn't be with her.

702
00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:33,510
That I didn't deserve her.

703
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,540
You said...

704
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:38,110
I didn't deserve her.

705
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,990
You don't need to follow me in,

706
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:44,250
and I don't need tea.

707
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:46,260
It's a sudden raid.

708
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,860
There's talk that you go out
for 30 minutes to an hour.

709
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:56,270
This is inappropriate as a father...

710
00:44:56,870 --> 00:44:58,200
and as a superior.

711
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:00,000
I'm here for two reasons.

712
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:04,270
"I'm going to marry the person
I naturally end up dating."

713
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:06,410
"If I marry, that is."

714
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,880
It's pretty vague.

715
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,350
Tell me clearly
if you intend to marry or not.

716
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:14,480
Are you slacking off
because sales went up?

717
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:18,890
Did you make me a director
without allowing me...

718
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:20,690
to manage my own schedule?

719
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:22,260
And about marriage.

720
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,990
It's as I said.

721
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:25,990
You have until the end of the year.

722
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,060
If you don't find someone
until then,

723
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:29,870
that's a shortcoming on your part.

724
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:34,570
I expect you to marry
the woman I find you.

725
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,040
(Shoealls)

726
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:48,750
I'm preparing a project, you see.

727
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:52,490
I was looking for someone
to design the interior,

728
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:53,990
and I happened to...

729
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:56,630
Sorry. What's your name?

730
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,660
Oh, my name is Ji Eun Oh.

731
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,630
I see.

732
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:06,100
That's why the company's called
Eunoism Design.

733
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:07,140
Yes.

734
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,040
My name is Ko Seong Hui.

735
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,240
(Gaon Foundation, Ko Seong Hui)

736
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:16,680
I guess you could call it
a space for art and design.

737
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:19,480
I was planning something like that.

738
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:22,220
I happened to see your portfolio,

739
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:23,590
and I quite liked it.

740
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:26,960
Oh, I see.

741
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,730
I'd like to give you the job.

742
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:31,590
You don't seem to have
much experience.

743
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:36,270
No. I got into interior design
about a year ago.

744
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:39,430
Then three businesses and this cafe.

745
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:41,040
- You designed four spaces?
- Yes.

746
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:43,440
I did the interior
of a few studio apartments,

747
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:45,870
but those were friends' places
I did for free for the experience.

748
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:51,810
I don't know how big
the project you're planning is,

749
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:54,950
but you should look into others
with more experience too.

750
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,720
If you tell me the image you want,

751
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,720
I'll sketch something
for you to look at.

752
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,190
You can decide then.

753
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:03,890
You can even decide
after I give you an estimate.

754
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:07,130
Why would you say that?

755
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:10,630
- Pardon?
- I like you, and that's it.

756
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:14,000
I want you to do it.

757
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:17,040
Me?

758
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:20,380
I got the feel
when I saw your portfolio.

759
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:25,050
I have another appointment.

760
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:27,620
I'd like to discuss
the details in person.

761
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:29,080
When are you free?

762
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,320
I'm free whenever you are.

763
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:33,720
What about this cafe?

764
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:37,590
I accepted the manager role
because I'm allowed to come and go.

765
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:40,400
A senior of my university club
invested in the cafe.

766
00:47:40,830 --> 00:47:43,500
I thought it was a nice place.

767
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:45,770
It's where cool people gather.

768
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,170
My number's on that card.

769
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:52,310
Text me your number.

770
00:47:53,310 --> 00:47:54,780
Okay. I'll do that.

771
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,310
I hope to see you soon.

772
00:47:58,650 --> 00:47:59,720
Yes.

773
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:05,150
(Gaon Foundation, Ko Seong Hui)

774
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:07,020
This is insane.

775
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:10,230
It must be true
that deities bless good people.

776
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:12,060
It's not official yet.

777
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:14,860
She could've given me the job
impulsively...

778
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:16,830
because I'd helped her.

779
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:20,270
I really hope she calls.

780
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,700
Me too.

781
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:23,540
I need something to concentrate on.

782
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:26,710
I gave an estimate for an apartment,
but the person didn't call.

783
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,870
You should place it there.

784
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:32,240
(6 a.m., Alarm)

785
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,550
Who's calling this early?

786
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:41,250
Dad's job offer at Seongil Weaving
was canceled.

787
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:45,450
He hasn't been able to tell us...

788
00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:47,960
and goes out each day
searching for a job.

789
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:52,290
Shoot.

790
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:55,500
Pull yourself together.

791
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:57,300
You can't afford to sleep in.

792
00:49:58,130 --> 00:49:59,870
The family can't know
you were fired.

793
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:36,870
I'll catch this punk
the second I see him.

794
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:38,240
So don't worry, and head inside.

795
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:41,180
Right.

796
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:42,840
Thank you.

797
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:38,070
It's been a while, Yeong Ra.

798
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:40,100
You know how I feel about you now.

799
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:53,150
- Let go!
- Yeong Ra!

800
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:54,750
- No...
- Yeong Ra, wait.

801
00:51:57,150 --> 00:51:58,520
Come on, Yeong Ra.

802
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:02,060
Haven't I done enough
to prove how I feel?

803
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:05,090
I gave you a flower like this
at your graduation exhibition.

804
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:06,160
Don't you remember that?

805
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,330
No...

806
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:12,400
I'm not a scary person.

807
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,400
- Please don't hurt me.
- Yeong Ra.

808
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,540
Please don't hurt me. Please.

809
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:17,710
What's going on?

810
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:20,340
Who are you?

811
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:28,150
Ms. Park.

812
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:29,950
Who was that man?

813
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:31,390
Should I call the police?

814
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:34,320
You can't get caught up
in any kind of scandal.

815
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:37,190
No, please don't.

816
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:40,130
He's probably a fan,

817
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:42,660
and I was just startled
that he suddenly came by.

818
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,970
A fan who shows up
out of the blue like that...

819
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:46,330
is most likely a stalker.

820
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:48,140
No, it's not that.

821
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:51,740
I'm fine, Jeong Hui.

822
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:02,950
I'll be fine.

823
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:22,600
How long are you going
to think this through?

824
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:25,810
What will it be?

825
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:28,640
What are you going to do?

826
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:42,560
This is Ruche General Contractor.

827
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,360
We were impressed by your resume...

828
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:46,930
and will contact you next week
to schedule an interview.

829
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:53,840
Way to go.

830
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,570
Didn't you quit tennis
over three years ago?

831
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:00,240
What are you even doing here?

832
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,440
How did you know I was here?

833
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,610
I tracked your GPS. Happy now?

834
00:54:03,810 --> 00:54:04,850
What's gotten into you?

835
00:54:17,330 --> 00:54:19,490
Eun Oh, it's about Ji Hyuk.

836
00:54:19,490 --> 00:54:21,100
Stop. Don't mention his name.

837
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,100
Isn't it strange
that he hasn't been at the cafe...

838
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:26,870
and hasn't even contacted Mr. Park?

839
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,940
It's odd. Very odd.

840
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:32,370
But since I need to move on
with my life,

841
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:33,440
I won't think about it.

842
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:38,310
Got it. I won't mention
Lee Ji Hyuk from now on.

843
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,850
You've been ignoring
my texts and calls,

844
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:44,950
and you still refuse
to talk to me in person.

845
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:47,620
Am I even still a friend to you?

846
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:49,460
I texted saying
I wanted to be alone.

847
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:52,190
Why did you come find me
instead of just letting me be?

848
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:54,600
I searched for you
at the pool you go to,

849
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:56,670
at the Han River,
and at the free diving pool,

850
00:54:58,070 --> 00:54:59,600
and then came here just in case.

851
00:55:01,870 --> 00:55:04,240
Why? Is something up?

852
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:05,340
What is it?

853
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:07,810
As if something would be up
with someone as boring as me.

854
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,280
I looked for you to give you this.

855
00:55:12,050 --> 00:55:13,080
What's this?

856
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:15,550
This is the guest studio apartment
owned by our company.

857
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:18,620
You've probably been
wandering around...

858
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:20,460
after leaving home
saying you were headed to work.

859
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:22,160
Spend your time there instead.

860
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:29,830
You're being generous...

861
00:55:29,830 --> 00:55:31,470
despite not knowing
the situation I'm in.

862
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,140
You...

863
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:37,270
Don't waste your time
at places like this.

864
00:55:37,270 --> 00:55:38,340
It's pathetic.

865
00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:40,040
What's so pathetic?

866
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:43,040
Playing sports is the best way
to clear your head and think.

867
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:45,880
Head to the unit starting tomorrow
and look for jobs.

868
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:47,520
You still haven't decided on one,
have you?

869
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:49,880
A job?

870
00:55:50,490 --> 00:55:53,620
Doesn't your line of work
hire people with experience?

871
00:55:56,390 --> 00:55:57,390
(Libeore)

872
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:59,790
It's not my work but another matter
I had to think about.

873
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:01,060
As in what?

874
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,060
Is something else up
with the family?

875
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:07,070
I was thinking about
how it would be...

876
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:08,770
to marry Jung Bo A.

877
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,070
Jung Bo A?

878
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:13,480
Hold on.

879
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,580
Jung Bo A at Haneul Construction?

880
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:17,680
Yes.

881
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:20,120
She asked me to marry her,

882
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:21,750
and that's what I was considering.

883
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:23,350
Quite seriously, too.

884
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:24,720
She asked you to marry her?

885
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:26,990
Jung Bo A asked you to marry her?

886
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:28,860
Yes.

887
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:29,890
Why?

888
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:33,290
Because she wants to marry me.

889
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:34,800
Did she really ask you?

890
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:36,300
She did.

891
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:44,840
I couldn't care less
about her state of mind,

892
00:56:46,610 --> 00:56:48,640
but you don't seem
to be joking about this.

893
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:51,280
But how is this even up for debate?

894
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:53,780
Can't I consider it?

895
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:56,580
There's nothing
between you and Jung Bo A.

896
00:56:58,620 --> 00:56:59,690
How can you be sure...

897
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:01,660
that there's nothing between us?

898
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:02,820
I'm sure.

899
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:04,290
You don't love her,

900
00:57:04,290 --> 00:57:06,330
and she doesn't love you either.
Am I wrong?

901
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:09,230
Love?

902
00:57:11,070 --> 00:57:12,400
Sure. We're not in love.

903
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,070
Exactly.

904
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:16,400
So what the heck am I even hearing?

905
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:19,010
Why did she propose
something so ridiculous,

906
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:20,210
and why are you...

907
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:22,310
even considering it?

908
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:24,880
Is this a comedy sitcom?

909
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,750
Lee Ji Hyuk, what's gotten into you?

910
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:28,880
Pull yourself together.

911
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:34,820
Why can't we marry
if we're not in love?

912
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:37,460
- What?
- Why can't you marry...

913
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:38,490
without love?

914
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:40,530
Who says you have to marry
someone you love...

915
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:42,160
when not every love
leads to marriage?

916
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,700
What is this nonsense?

917
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:45,530
Why would you marry without love?
What for?

918
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:48,340
I'm asking why you must love someone
to marry her.

919
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:50,710
Fine.

920
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:53,010
Why are you thinking...

921
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:54,610
about marrying someone
you don't even love?

922
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,680
I may not love her,
but I might need the marriage.

923
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:02,750
Why would you enter
into a marriage like that?

924
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:04,290
Just live alone,
for crying out loud.

925
00:58:04,290 --> 00:58:06,320
Do that.
You're anti-marriage, after all.

926
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:11,360
- "A marriage like that?"
- You heard me.

927
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:14,530
As if I don't know
why Jung Bo A wants to marry you...

928
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,700
and why you're considering
marrying her.

929
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,470
Actually, you're clueless.

930
00:58:21,470 --> 00:58:22,470
I know why.

931
00:58:22,470 --> 00:58:25,770
I knew you'd never understand,
no matter how hard you tried.

932
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,040
But this is funny,

933
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:31,010
how you're objecting
until you're red in the face.

934
00:58:31,010 --> 00:58:32,080
Because we're friends.

935
00:58:33,450 --> 00:58:35,180
I'm objecting because we're friends.

936
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:37,390
Are you?

937
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:39,050
Ji Hyuk.

938
00:58:41,090 --> 00:58:42,590
This isn't right at all.

939
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:47,630
Hearing you talk made me realize...

940
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:50,700
it's not a bad idea.

941
00:58:51,630 --> 00:58:53,870
Yes. I can do it.

942
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:56,970
- What?
- This is why I didn't tell you.

943
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,510
It's why I couldn't.

944
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:00,740
It's not a topic for us.

945
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:03,040
Because you...

946
00:59:04,110 --> 00:59:05,380
could never understand.

947
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:08,280
Lee Ji Hyuk.

948
00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:11,420
Is this the extent
of our friendship?

949
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:16,320
There are things
that can't be shared.

950
00:59:17,730 --> 00:59:18,860
There was.

951
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:21,300
Between us, even.

952
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:23,260
What does that mean?

953
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:28,440
Take care.

954
00:59:59,130 --> 01:00:00,200
You're here.

955
01:00:00,570 --> 01:00:01,640
I'm here.

956
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,110
Take a seat.

957
01:00:04,410 --> 01:00:05,410
Then we can...

958
01:00:07,210 --> 01:00:08,380
discuss our marriage.

959
01:00:18,950 --> 01:00:21,590
You've made up your mind, then.

960
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:27,000
Some got married three days
after meeting on a blind date.

961
01:00:29,530 --> 01:00:30,730
Thank you.

962
01:00:33,170 --> 01:00:34,300
I feel reassured now.

963
01:00:35,370 --> 01:00:37,810
My future won't be as bleak.

964
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:40,070
I feel the same.

965
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,080
We're getting married
because we both have a need.

966
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:46,650
Let's make this a win-win.

967
01:00:49,350 --> 01:00:50,790
Do we have to...

968
01:00:51,050 --> 01:00:53,250
sign a contract or something
before we get started?

969
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:55,820
That sounds horrific.

970
01:00:56,390 --> 01:00:59,260
We're getting married for real.
It's not a contractual marriage.

971
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:03,560
You must have a boundary, though.

972
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:07,700
You seem to have one.

973
01:01:08,270 --> 01:01:09,470
A boundary.

974
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:14,810
Tell me.

975
01:01:15,210 --> 01:01:17,610
My father and I...

976
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:19,910
want you to work at our company.

977
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:21,620
That's the biggest thing.

978
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:24,190
Then...

979
01:01:26,390 --> 01:01:27,590
here are my conditions.

980
01:01:44,770 --> 01:01:45,970
Are you nervous?

981
01:01:50,450 --> 01:01:52,450
I didn't think I'd meet him so soon.

982
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,670
Welcome. He's waiting for you.

983
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,470
I'm Lee Ji Hyuk.

984
01:02:17,310 --> 01:02:18,840
He's the chief secretary.

985
01:02:19,270 --> 01:02:21,610
Chief Secretary Cha Mun Seok
and Mr. Kim, the chauffeur.

986
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:24,650
You have keys in your pocket.

987
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:26,680
Yes.

988
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:29,020
They make a noise.
Leave them with him.

989
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:31,650
Okay.

990
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:34,690
Come this way.

991
01:02:37,730 --> 01:02:39,690
Nice to meet you, sir.
I'm Lee Ji Hyuk.

992
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:42,460
I'm Jung Ho Yeong.

993
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:44,330
I'm Bo A's father.

994
01:02:44,870 --> 01:02:46,130
Please speak freely.

995
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:48,570
I can't do that
until the handshake's over at least.

996
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:52,710
Let's sit down.

997
01:02:57,410 --> 01:02:59,350
There's no need
to feel awkward or uncomfortable.

998
01:02:59,980 --> 01:03:01,250
That goes for now and in the future.

999
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:03,890
The truth is,

1000
01:03:04,950 --> 01:03:06,220
we're not dating.

1001
01:03:06,490 --> 01:03:07,520
I know that.

1002
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:09,960
I know why you want to get married.

1003
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:13,390
I like you, still.

1004
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:17,000
You're just the right man for Bo A.

1005
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,640
Don't take it to heart.

1006
01:03:22,270 --> 01:03:23,670
Rumors about me have spread,

1007
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:25,740
and no one at our level
will date me.

1008
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:28,940
I know that much.

1009
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:33,150
Does love come first
when it comes to marriage?

1010
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:35,120
No.

1011
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:38,790
I married my wife
after we'd met just three times,

1012
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:40,660
and we're still happily married.

1013
01:03:42,190 --> 01:03:43,190
Right.

1014
01:03:45,090 --> 01:03:46,760
Bo A will give you...

1015
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:49,830
a few dates to choose from
for the wedding.

1016
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:52,870
I'd like it to be sooner
rather than later.

1017
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:56,040
How about two weeks from now?

1018
01:04:13,450 --> 01:04:15,820
(Haneul Construction)

1019
01:04:16,690 --> 01:04:18,390
I guess
Mr. Kim picked up your car for you.

1020
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:23,800
I'll go home with my father.

1021
01:04:24,170 --> 01:04:26,130
- Get in the car.
- Okay.

1022
01:04:37,610 --> 01:04:39,650
Call once you have
your parents' permission.

1023
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:42,520
That will kick-start
the preparations.

1024
01:04:43,450 --> 01:04:45,290
Okay. I'll be in touch.

1025
01:05:04,970 --> 01:05:06,040
(What can I do for you?)

1026
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:08,610
Text Ji Wan and Su Bin.

1027
01:05:10,310 --> 01:05:11,910
What do you mean...

1028
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:13,550
you want to change the theme?

1029
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:15,980
I have an idea.

1030
01:05:17,990 --> 01:05:19,550
I'm going to bring on a guest.

1031
01:05:20,190 --> 01:05:21,220
A guest?

1032
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:26,890
(Oldest brother)

1033
01:05:27,830 --> 01:05:29,230
Be home by 6 p.m.

1034
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:30,560
What?

1035
01:05:31,170 --> 01:05:33,430
I have something important to say.
Be there.

1036
01:05:35,870 --> 01:05:36,870
I got caught?

1037
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:38,770
He found out?

1038
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:41,480
Yes.

1039
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:43,980
It was too stressful.

1040
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:46,550
I'll come clean...

1041
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:48,680
and get smacked just once.

1042
01:05:50,150 --> 01:05:52,390
But Ji Hyuk's punches really hurt.

1043
01:06:06,370 --> 01:06:09,340
What's the occasion
that all three of you...

1044
01:06:09,370 --> 01:06:11,870
came home around the same time?

1045
01:06:12,140 --> 01:06:14,880
It has been a while
since we gathered for a meal.

1046
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:17,510
Ji Hyuk told us to come home early.

1047
01:06:17,610 --> 01:06:18,880
He texted us.

1048
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:21,580
You did, Ji Hyuk? What for?

1049
01:06:22,450 --> 01:06:23,850
Is something going on?

1050
01:06:24,620 --> 01:06:25,790
Let's finish dinner first.

1051
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:28,520
Tell us now.

1052
01:06:28,820 --> 01:06:30,190
What's going on?

1053
01:06:30,990 --> 01:06:33,230
Why did you want
Ji Wan and Su Bin here too?

1054
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:35,160
Are you in trouble?

1055
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:36,300
- No.
- No.

1056
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:38,570
No. I have something to tell you.

1057
01:06:39,530 --> 01:06:41,540
Are you free this Thursday
around lunchtime?

1058
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:43,470
Yes.

1059
01:06:44,170 --> 01:06:45,540
Mother, you must be free.

1060
01:06:45,870 --> 01:06:48,010
You two. Free up a few hours
even if you're busy.

1061
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:49,610
- Okay.
- Okay.

1062
01:06:50,110 --> 01:06:53,710
Ji Hyuk.
Tell us what it's about first.

1063
01:06:54,580 --> 01:06:55,620
I'd like you...

1064
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:59,390
to meet the parents
of the woman I'm going to marry.

1065
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:03,360
I'm...

1066
01:07:04,790 --> 01:07:05,830
getting married.

1067
01:07:58,050 --> 01:08:00,880
(Our Golden Days)

1068
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:03,750
I'm not asking
for permission to marry.

1069
01:08:03,820 --> 01:08:07,690
When did you schedule
the wedding for, then?

1070
01:08:07,990 --> 01:08:10,020
You held back and didn't get angry.

1071
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:11,660
It didn't bruise your ego?

1072
01:08:11,790 --> 01:08:15,000
I look forward to
a new and impressive design.

1073
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,860
How about 30,000 dollars as a fee?

1074
01:08:17,570 --> 01:08:18,630
I'm getting married.

1075
01:08:18,630 --> 01:08:19,730
You won't regret it?

1076
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:20,970
Ji Hyuk's getting married.

1077
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,170
This was why Ji Hyuk and I
didn't suit each other.

1078
01:08:24,170 --> 01:08:26,040
I'm off to sort things out
