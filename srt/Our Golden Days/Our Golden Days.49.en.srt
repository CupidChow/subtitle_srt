1
00:00:02,461 --> 00:00:03,461
Honey.

2
00:00:05,271 --> 00:00:06,271
I was...

3
00:00:06,901 --> 00:00:08,041
so wrong.

4
00:00:14,111 --> 00:00:17,611
Kneeling is for children who have misbehaved.

5
00:00:19,881 --> 00:00:22,221
Either get up and sit down, or get out.

6
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:30,891
Here, Seong Jae.

7
00:00:33,061 --> 00:00:34,731
What, no recording today?

8
00:00:38,301 --> 00:00:39,331
That's not...

9
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:41,671
why I'm here.

10
00:00:43,101 --> 00:00:44,171
Check her.

11
00:00:45,971 --> 00:00:47,011
Okay.

12
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:52,511
She's clean.

13
00:01:05,491 --> 00:01:07,491
Now, then let's hear...

14
00:01:08,331 --> 00:01:09,361
what you did wrong.

15
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:13,771
I know that even if I tell you I'm sorry now,

16
00:01:14,701 --> 00:01:16,101
you're not going to believe me.

17
00:01:17,671 --> 00:01:18,671
But...

18
00:01:19,341 --> 00:01:22,341
you know better than anyone else...

19
00:01:23,411 --> 00:01:25,051
that begging is the only option I have left.

20
00:01:26,811 --> 00:01:27,821
Is that so?

21
00:01:29,421 --> 00:01:30,421
Yes.

22
00:01:31,121 --> 00:01:32,821
It's true. I deceived you.

23
00:01:34,391 --> 00:01:35,761
When we first met,

24
00:01:36,391 --> 00:01:38,561
I lied and said my daughter was dead when she was alive.

25
00:01:39,361 --> 00:01:41,001
I lied about Woo Jin's health.

26
00:01:41,961 --> 00:01:43,461
To save Woo Jin,

27
00:01:44,061 --> 00:01:45,771
I found the daughter I'd abandoned...

28
00:01:47,031 --> 00:01:48,801
and manipulated her into giving the liver transplant.

29
00:01:50,901 --> 00:01:52,971
I never truly loved Seong Jae.

30
00:01:54,441 --> 00:01:55,441
And from you,

31
00:01:56,011 --> 00:01:57,681
I hid that I was after your money.

32
00:02:00,911 --> 00:02:02,121
But does all of that...

33
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,221
prove that I didn't love you?

34
00:02:10,361 --> 00:02:13,391
Did it ever occur to you that I lied because I loved you?

35
00:02:17,031 --> 00:02:19,931
That's why I couldn't bring myself to beg the moment you found out.

36
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:24,071
You threw down the background check you ran on me and kicked me out...

37
00:02:25,871 --> 00:02:29,281
without hearing my side or asking a single question.

38
00:02:29,711 --> 00:02:30,711
And yes.

39
00:02:30,981 --> 00:02:33,981
I felt an indescribable sense of betrayal, too.

40
00:02:36,681 --> 00:02:38,091
And yet, after 26 years...

41
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:42,621
of me never complaining, you just dragged me out.

42
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:44,761
My real estate properties and...

43
00:02:45,361 --> 00:02:47,761
No, never mind that.

44
00:02:49,161 --> 00:02:51,631
You left me with a debit card with just 2,000 dollars.

45
00:02:52,701 --> 00:02:54,031
I wasn't about to beg you after that.

46
00:02:54,771 --> 00:02:56,601
I was too hurt and furious.

47
00:02:58,711 --> 00:02:59,711
So?

48
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:02,881
Honey.

49
00:03:03,681 --> 00:03:05,081
Please, I'm begging you.

50
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:07,351
Please, just this once.

51
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:10,121
You were happy, too, weren't you?

52
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:15,091
My past... That was all before I met you.

53
00:03:15,421 --> 00:03:16,761
Can't you just look past it?

54
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:18,931
Just like I told Seong Jae,

55
00:03:19,891 --> 00:03:21,801
I truly did love you.

56
00:03:24,301 --> 00:03:26,431
You were precious to me because I needed you.

57
00:03:28,941 --> 00:03:31,171
And I was grateful to you for providing for me.

58
00:03:32,511 --> 00:03:36,111
That's why I could devote myself to you, steadfastly, for 26 years.

59
00:03:37,281 --> 00:03:38,751
If it were just about greed,

60
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:42,221
why would I have tried so hard after we were already married?

61
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,391
If you'll take me back,

62
00:03:47,151 --> 00:03:49,191
I swear I'll do everything right.

63
00:03:51,591 --> 00:03:54,531
To the end, you still won't really admit you were wrong.

64
00:03:55,761 --> 00:03:56,831
Persuasion failed.

65
00:03:58,831 --> 00:04:01,771
I told you I was wrong! I even got on my knees.

66
00:04:02,771 --> 00:04:04,771
You know the saying. "Too little, too late."

67
00:04:05,711 --> 00:04:07,511
Begging for forgiveness now?

68
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:10,411
You should've done that the moment I caught you.

69
00:04:11,281 --> 00:04:14,351
Before you stormed into my office demanding a divorce.

70
00:04:16,551 --> 00:04:17,921
Then what about you?

71
00:04:19,451 --> 00:04:21,721
You kicked me out but won't grant me a divorce.

72
00:04:22,921 --> 00:04:25,461
You need someone to take care of you.

73
00:04:27,331 --> 00:04:28,431
Just because you hate me,

74
00:04:29,031 --> 00:04:31,201
are you really going to make your own life lonely?

75
00:04:32,571 --> 00:04:34,771
Don't you worry about how I live my life.

76
00:04:35,201 --> 00:04:36,941
You just worry about your own survival.

77
00:04:38,871 --> 00:04:42,041
Then where am I supposed to work?

78
00:04:42,641 --> 00:04:43,811
Do you want me to do manual labor?

79
00:04:44,141 --> 00:04:45,981
That's for you to figure out.

80
00:04:50,421 --> 00:04:51,421
Fine.

81
00:04:52,121 --> 00:04:53,191
Have it your way.

82
00:04:56,391 --> 00:04:57,461
In that case...

83
00:04:59,131 --> 00:05:01,031
So I can have a roof over my head,

84
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:03,201
just get me a place to live.

85
00:05:04,601 --> 00:05:06,471
A small apartment.

86
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:10,701
I'll earn my own money to get by.

87
00:05:11,841 --> 00:05:13,841
That's not what I want.

88
00:05:15,741 --> 00:05:17,851
But I'm still our daughter's mother.

89
00:05:20,251 --> 00:05:23,321
All I have right now is the 5,000 dollars Yeong Ra gave me.

90
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:24,791
Five thousand dollars?

91
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:27,021
Yeong Ra gave you the perfect amount.

92
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:30,491
Use that for the security deposit on an apartment.

93
00:05:31,091 --> 00:05:33,131
Isn't that how you used to live, anyway?

94
00:05:35,901 --> 00:05:37,731
How could you be so cruel?

95
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:43,471
Seong Jae, what do you think?

96
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:46,911
That past of yours...

97
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:50,841
If I asked you to make excuses for those hard times,

98
00:05:51,781 --> 00:05:55,351
you'd have plenty to complain about, wouldn't you?

99
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:57,721
That's what I'm trying to say!

100
00:05:58,421 --> 00:06:02,621
- You won't let me explain. - Look, Ko Seong Hui.

101
00:06:03,361 --> 00:06:05,591
I know why you were holding Woo Jin that day,

102
00:06:05,661 --> 00:06:08,561
desperately trying to hail a taxi.

103
00:06:09,361 --> 00:06:11,061
My son is sick.

104
00:06:11,801 --> 00:06:15,041
I need to get to the hospital. Please, let me get a taxi!

105
00:06:15,401 --> 00:06:16,441
Thank you.

106
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:21,781
That was for Woo Jin's ear infection surgery...

107
00:06:21,841 --> 00:06:23,681
The doctor at that pediatric clinic...

108
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,611
I went to see him.

109
00:06:27,611 --> 00:06:29,281
You...

110
00:06:30,021 --> 00:06:31,721
Your past is one thing,

111
00:06:32,551 --> 00:06:34,821
but you deceived me from the very beginning.

112
00:06:36,391 --> 00:06:39,091
You knew I had a soft spot for a devoted mother.

113
00:06:39,631 --> 00:06:41,601
You read me like a book,

114
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:43,901
and you made your move.

115
00:06:45,401 --> 00:06:47,131
All those nice things you did for the past 26 years?

116
00:06:48,101 --> 00:06:50,301
It was all just to get something bigger,

117
00:06:50,601 --> 00:06:52,841
using my kids and acting like you cared for me.

118
00:06:54,611 --> 00:06:58,551
And now, I've figured it all out. Now, I'm the one...

119
00:06:59,581 --> 00:07:01,781
who sees right through you.

120
00:07:03,251 --> 00:07:05,951
So he really does see right through me.

121
00:07:07,551 --> 00:07:10,561
Seong Jae, we're done here.

122
00:07:12,761 --> 00:07:13,761
Okay.

123
00:07:29,211 --> 00:07:30,511
Take care of yourself.

124
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,281
I won't be changing my number,

125
00:07:35,351 --> 00:07:36,921
so whether it takes a year or two,

126
00:07:37,781 --> 00:07:40,621
call me when you've cooled down.

127
00:07:43,361 --> 00:07:44,731
I'll be waiting.

128
00:08:34,241 --> 00:08:35,481
Yes, hi.

129
00:08:36,481 --> 00:08:40,381
Yes, I just stepped out for a walk. I'll be right in.

130
00:08:41,211 --> 00:08:42,821
Sure, all right.

131
00:08:49,591 --> 00:08:51,221
Dad, I understand how you feel,

132
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:55,061
and I agree that she deserves this.

133
00:08:57,301 --> 00:08:58,301
But...

134
00:08:59,201 --> 00:09:01,941
she's still your wife, legally.

135
00:09:03,701 --> 00:09:05,811
Why not just get her the apartment she asked for?

136
00:09:08,241 --> 00:09:11,241
I can't let that woman get her hands on a lump sum of money.

137
00:09:13,281 --> 00:09:14,581
A security deposit for an apartment?

138
00:09:16,751 --> 00:09:20,251
She'll find a way to use that money to come after me again.

139
00:09:32,601 --> 00:09:33,601
In that case...

140
00:09:35,471 --> 00:09:37,401
So I can have a roof over my head,

141
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:39,441
just get me a place to live.

142
00:09:40,841 --> 00:09:42,781
A small apartment.

143
00:09:44,081 --> 00:09:47,011
I'll earn my own money to get by.

144
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:50,881
That's not what I want.

145
00:09:57,661 --> 00:09:58,661
That's it.

146
00:10:01,191 --> 00:10:02,201
That's it.

147
00:10:03,301 --> 00:10:04,331
This is enough.

148
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,331
I can sue for divorce and claim he's the party at fault.

149
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:17,741
Eun Oh.

150
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:19,951
I'm sorry.

151
00:10:20,981 --> 00:10:24,651
If you say sorry one more time, I swear I'm leaving.

152
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:31,931
Ji Hyuk!

153
00:10:33,661 --> 00:10:37,031
- Mr. Lee. - Eun Oh. How is Ji Hyuk doing?

154
00:10:37,461 --> 00:10:39,201
We don't know anything yet.

155
00:10:39,601 --> 00:10:41,641
They said the doctor would be here soon.

156
00:10:46,011 --> 00:10:47,671
- Doctor. - Doctor.

157
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:51,751
Doctor. What's Ji Hyuk's condition?

158
00:10:52,481 --> 00:10:55,081
Ji Hyuk's heart function...

159
00:10:55,181 --> 00:10:58,021
has gotten a little worse since last time.

160
00:10:58,321 --> 00:10:59,521
How much worse?

161
00:11:00,191 --> 00:11:04,021
So, how long will he need to be hospitalized?

162
00:11:05,191 --> 00:11:08,231
We're looking at a week or two for now,

163
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:11,131
but it could be longer depending on his condition.

164
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:15,001
If it's longer, how much more time are we talking about?

165
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:16,941
Mom,

166
00:11:17,801 --> 00:11:19,211
for patients like me,

167
00:11:20,171 --> 00:11:22,241
it's normal to be in and out of the hospital.

168
00:11:23,481 --> 00:11:24,611
Isn't that right, Doctor?

169
00:11:25,711 --> 00:11:27,111
Yes, that's right.

170
00:11:28,681 --> 00:11:29,681
Really?

171
00:11:30,621 --> 00:11:31,721
Then, Doctor,

172
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:35,191
how long will the treatment take before he can be discharged?

173
00:11:36,561 --> 00:11:39,861
That all depends on the patient's condition.

174
00:11:40,331 --> 00:11:43,361
If he gets any worse, or if his blood pressure drops,

175
00:11:44,531 --> 00:11:46,431
he may have to be moved to the Intensive Care Unit.

176
00:11:47,831 --> 00:11:49,041
The Intensive Care Unit?

177
00:11:51,271 --> 00:11:52,271
Mom...

178
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:02,221
Doctor, even if he's moved to the ICU,

179
00:12:02,581 --> 00:12:05,051
he can get treated and move back to a regular room, right?

180
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:08,221
That does happen in some cases,

181
00:12:08,321 --> 00:12:12,661
but Ji Hyuk's heart continues to deteriorate despite medication,

182
00:12:13,461 --> 00:12:16,201
so a full recovery is unlikely.

183
00:12:17,301 --> 00:12:21,301
But then... What exactly does that mean?

184
00:12:22,071 --> 00:12:25,771
It's highly probable he will need a heart transplant.

185
00:12:26,471 --> 00:12:28,041
Already?

186
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:30,341
Isn't an artificial heart an option?

187
00:12:30,511 --> 00:12:33,251
There's a device called an LVAD, a left ventricular assist device,

188
00:12:33,911 --> 00:12:37,981
but the right ventricle of his heart is also severely damaged,

189
00:12:38,951 --> 00:12:40,991
so he's not a candidate for an artificial heart.

190
00:12:49,961 --> 00:12:53,401
I'll stay. He'll be more comfortable with me here.

191
00:12:53,601 --> 00:12:56,141
He's a grown man. Why would he be more comfortable with you?

192
00:12:56,141 --> 00:12:57,441
He wants his dad.

193
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,441
Besides, don't you have to work tomorrow?

194
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:01,541
Work?

195
00:13:02,141 --> 00:13:03,141
Well...

196
00:13:03,941 --> 00:13:05,451
Dad, you can just stay for tonight.

197
00:13:07,781 --> 00:13:08,851
Mom, you should go home.

198
00:13:09,851 --> 00:13:13,491
You have your own life too, Mom. Just because I'm in the hospital,

199
00:13:14,651 --> 00:13:15,921
it doesn't mean you should quit your job.

200
00:13:16,761 --> 00:13:18,561
I can get around just fine on my own.

201
00:13:19,391 --> 00:13:20,531
We can just hire a caregiver.

202
00:13:21,161 --> 00:13:23,561
Right. I'll stay the night then. Okay?

203
00:13:24,561 --> 00:13:28,701
Dad, can you please read the room? He has...

204
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:31,401
a girlfriend now, you know.

205
00:13:33,871 --> 00:13:36,781
Right. You're right. Okay.

206
00:13:37,141 --> 00:13:39,051
Okay, I get it.

207
00:13:49,991 --> 00:13:52,391
Get home safe. I'm just going to the restroom.

208
00:13:54,661 --> 00:13:56,131
Okay, we'll head out first.

209
00:13:57,201 --> 00:14:00,031
We should see her off in a taxi. Can't you wait for that?

210
00:14:00,271 --> 00:14:01,871
She's not actually going to the restroom.

211
00:14:02,271 --> 00:14:03,871
She wants to be alone.

212
00:14:05,141 --> 00:14:08,041
- Alone? - She was fighting back tears.

213
00:14:11,241 --> 00:14:12,251
I'm sure she was.

214
00:14:13,651 --> 00:14:14,651
All right, let's go.

215
00:14:15,681 --> 00:14:16,681
Let's go.

216
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:36,841
I'm so happy today.

217
00:14:38,001 --> 00:14:41,411
It's highly probable he will need a heart transplant.

218
00:14:45,911 --> 00:14:46,981
No, that can't be it.

219
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,081
It won't come to that.

220
00:14:50,081 --> 00:14:51,951
How could this be happening so fast?

221
00:15:05,201 --> 00:15:06,631
Dad, are you asleep?

222
00:15:07,431 --> 00:15:09,501
What? Oh, yes...

223
00:15:10,501 --> 00:15:12,171
Why? You can't sleep?

224
00:15:15,241 --> 00:15:17,111
Dad, congratulations on your first day at the new job.

225
00:15:19,281 --> 00:15:20,751
It's not even the day yet.

226
00:15:21,081 --> 00:15:22,851
Why are you congratulating me so early?

227
00:15:23,681 --> 00:15:25,791
We were going to go out to the front gate...

228
00:15:26,891 --> 00:15:29,491
and have the three of us give you a proper send-off.

229
00:15:31,721 --> 00:15:32,791
But I guess we can't do that now.

230
00:15:35,731 --> 00:15:37,661
It's just my first day. What's the big deal?

231
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,401
What do you mean, "just my first day?"

232
00:15:41,771 --> 00:15:43,741
It is the second chance at life...

233
00:15:45,771 --> 00:15:47,571
that you worked so hard to get.

234
00:15:49,811 --> 00:15:50,811
Dad...

235
00:15:52,581 --> 00:15:53,651
You're amazing.

236
00:15:56,751 --> 00:15:58,551
I honestly didn't think you were going to make it.

237
00:15:59,721 --> 00:16:01,291
I knew I would.

238
00:16:02,491 --> 00:16:03,891
I was going to keep at it until I did.

239
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,631
Being the head of the family...

240
00:16:11,161 --> 00:16:12,871
It seems like it's both an amazing...

241
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:16,901
and a terrifying thing to be.

242
00:16:20,241 --> 00:16:21,241
Still,

243
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:23,781
there were a lot of good times.

244
00:16:25,011 --> 00:16:26,951
Because it was all for my family.

245
00:16:27,711 --> 00:16:28,721
Yes.

246
00:16:30,981 --> 00:16:32,251
It might be scary,

247
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:37,721
but I want to be one someday.

248
00:16:41,061 --> 00:16:42,061
I'm ready now.

249
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:45,571
The head of...

250
00:16:47,601 --> 00:16:48,601
my own family.

251
00:16:52,741 --> 00:16:53,841
Then go for it.

252
00:16:54,441 --> 00:16:56,011
What's stopping you? You can do it.

253
00:17:21,771 --> 00:17:24,571
(Attorney Bae Yu Mi, Divorce Specialist)

254
00:17:29,441 --> 00:17:30,441
Hello?

255
00:17:31,141 --> 00:17:33,051
Hi, I'm calling back about the phone consultation I had.

256
00:17:34,711 --> 00:17:36,481
You said if I had a recording that proves grounds for divorce,

257
00:17:36,781 --> 00:17:38,651
I could file a divorce lawsuit, right?

258
00:17:42,121 --> 00:17:43,121
I have it all.

259
00:17:43,821 --> 00:17:46,331
He kicked me out. He's hiding assets...

260
00:17:46,591 --> 00:17:49,131
and isn't meeting his obligations. I recorded everything.

261
00:17:49,801 --> 00:17:50,931
I'm on my way now.

262
00:17:51,631 --> 00:17:54,601
I have a trial this morning. Please come after 2pm.

263
00:17:56,801 --> 00:17:57,801
I'll be there at 2pm.

264
00:17:58,371 --> 00:17:59,371
At 2pm sharp.

265
00:18:28,701 --> 00:18:30,771
He looks like a baby when he's sleeping.

266
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:39,011
Gosh, I'm so tired. My whole body is aching.

267
00:18:40,881 --> 00:18:41,911
What time is it?

268
00:18:48,251 --> 00:18:50,621
How does she look so pretty right after waking up?

269
00:18:51,921 --> 00:18:54,561
So that's what his sleepy voice sounds like.

270
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:57,401
It's so hot.

271
00:19:03,301 --> 00:19:04,301
Is it 10:30am?

272
00:19:05,371 --> 00:19:07,971
I set an alarm for 7am. Did we both sleep through it?

273
00:19:08,271 --> 00:19:11,441
Oh, no! I didn't hear it. Your family must be so worried.

274
00:19:14,251 --> 00:19:16,421
No. No one's even called.

275
00:19:17,151 --> 00:19:18,791
I guess they don't even know I didn't come home.

276
00:19:21,021 --> 00:19:22,021
What?

277
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,661
Same here.

278
00:19:25,491 --> 00:19:27,131
I guess since we've been working so late every night,

279
00:19:27,431 --> 00:19:30,761
- they've just stopped caring. - Oh, man.

280
00:19:31,031 --> 00:19:32,271
I panicked for no reason.

281
00:19:33,301 --> 00:19:35,271
But at least we finished up to the fifth episode.

282
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,941
We totally lost track of time.

283
00:19:36,941 --> 00:19:38,941
Plus the 1st-pass storyboards through Episode 10.

284
00:19:39,271 --> 00:19:40,511
We didn't even stop for dinner.

285
00:19:42,911 --> 00:19:45,851
Hey, let's go out and get a nice brunch today.

286
00:19:46,281 --> 00:19:48,381
Deal. Let's...

287
00:19:48,981 --> 00:19:50,281
get some fresh air.

288
00:19:50,381 --> 00:19:53,651
- Okay. I'm going to wash up first. - Okay.

289
00:19:58,061 --> 00:19:59,831
I can't believe I fell asleep with Yeong Ra right here.

290
00:20:00,931 --> 00:20:03,131
Okay, no more all-nighters. That's the new rule.

291
00:20:08,171 --> 00:20:09,201
I'm so full.

292
00:20:09,471 --> 00:20:11,771
You ate more than usual. This place must be good.

293
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:16,041
Honey, we're about to have eel. Why are you eating that now?

294
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:18,381
Babe, this is just an appetizer.

295
00:20:21,151 --> 00:20:22,851
Hey, what's wrong?

296
00:20:24,621 --> 00:20:27,721
You couldn't wait for two seconds? I can't even look at you!

297
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:37,601
My wedding invitation.

298
00:20:37,961 --> 00:20:40,101
So you mean while you were dating me,

299
00:20:41,601 --> 00:20:43,041
you were planning a wedding...

300
00:20:43,441 --> 00:20:47,171
You're healthy, fit, sweet, and stylish.

301
00:20:47,811 --> 00:20:49,341
But I don't like your background.

302
00:20:50,011 --> 00:20:51,011
In fact, I hate it.

303
00:21:00,421 --> 00:21:02,021
That woman... It can't be.

304
00:21:02,991 --> 00:21:05,221
When I liked someone, I'd go all in, showering them with flowers,

305
00:21:05,221 --> 00:21:07,431
and when she wanted a nice car, I leased a luxury import.

306
00:21:07,861 --> 00:21:10,431
But then, out of nowhere, she hands me a wedding invitation.

307
00:21:10,661 --> 00:21:13,301
She was getting married to some other guy in a week.

308
00:21:13,531 --> 00:21:15,941
So what did you do? Did you get revenge?

309
00:21:16,101 --> 00:21:18,771
Revenge? Please. She married a rich guy with a fancy apartment.

310
00:21:19,341 --> 00:21:20,471
I couldn't do a thing.

311
00:21:29,051 --> 00:21:30,481
Honey, what's wrong?

312
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:34,121
Do you know her?

313
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:41,691
I thought I recognized her,

314
00:21:43,661 --> 00:21:44,701
but I can't place her.

315
00:21:49,401 --> 00:21:51,871
When you're with me, you should only have eyes for me, honey.

316
00:21:52,871 --> 00:21:54,771
Of course, I only have eyes for you.

317
00:21:55,641 --> 00:21:59,011
Your cheeks are getting red. You must be cold. Let's go.

318
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:00,851
Yes.

319
00:22:00,911 --> 00:22:03,121
(Gourmet Hand-Crafted Chicken Skewers)

320
00:22:25,171 --> 00:22:29,081
What the... What did Lee Ji Wan do to land a girlfriend like that?

321
00:22:31,511 --> 00:22:34,281
- Honey, where do I throw this out? - Just figure it out yourself.

322
00:22:40,421 --> 00:22:42,861
Did you see the look on that woman's face earlier?

323
00:22:43,521 --> 00:22:45,931
It looked like she was still totally hung up on you.

324
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:48,591
- Really? - Of course.

325
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:53,501
Compared to her husband? Her eyes were shaking with envy.

326
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:58,201
She was shocked to see me with a younger, prettier woman...

327
00:22:58,641 --> 00:22:59,971
who drives a nice car.

328
00:23:00,411 --> 00:23:01,411
Hey.

329
00:23:01,711 --> 00:23:06,081
- Did that upset you? - No, it was so satisfying.

330
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:08,581
I feel like a weight I've held for ten years is finally lifted.

331
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:12,181
Thank you. I finally got my revenge.

332
00:23:13,621 --> 00:23:16,491
Since the weather's so nice, should we grab some coffee?

333
00:23:17,391 --> 00:23:18,521
The cafe's too far.

334
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:20,731
Let's have this instead.

335
00:23:27,601 --> 00:23:28,601
Here.

336
00:23:33,271 --> 00:23:34,271
Thank you.

337
00:23:37,181 --> 00:23:38,181
This is nice.

338
00:23:41,681 --> 00:23:44,751
Your cheeks are getting red. You must be cold. Let's go.

339
00:23:45,691 --> 00:23:48,491
I wonder if he was like this when he was dating her.

340
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:52,221
I'm just a softie when it comes to my girl.

341
00:23:52,561 --> 00:23:53,761
And I never cheat.

342
00:23:55,331 --> 00:23:56,401
Ji Wan.

343
00:23:57,231 --> 00:23:59,371
You're not still hung up on her, are you?

344
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,871
Hung up on her? Of course not.

345
00:24:02,271 --> 00:24:03,771
Then why were your hands shaking like that?

346
00:24:04,501 --> 00:24:07,311
When we were holding hands earlier, I noticed they were trembling.

347
00:24:08,371 --> 00:24:10,341
That was just because I was surprised.

348
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:14,181
Why are you smiling?

349
00:24:15,151 --> 00:24:16,951
Reminiscing about the good old days?

350
00:24:17,051 --> 00:24:21,521
I was smiling because of you. You were cute playing my girlfriend.

351
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:24,121
Just cute?

352
00:24:24,961 --> 00:24:26,091
Didn't I make your heart flutter?

353
00:24:30,331 --> 00:24:31,431
What?

354
00:24:32,631 --> 00:24:34,071
- For me, you're... - Oh, wait.

355
00:24:35,501 --> 00:24:36,601
(Su Bin)

356
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:38,141
So she finally calls.

357
00:24:39,441 --> 00:24:40,441
Su Bin.

358
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:44,181
Ji Hyuk?

359
00:24:48,011 --> 00:24:50,351
(Automated Motel)

360
00:24:57,691 --> 00:24:59,491
No!

361
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:05,101
No! No, not that!

362
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,441
Park Jin Seok!

363
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:49,681
Then where am I supposed to work?

364
00:25:50,111 --> 00:25:51,241
Do you want me to do manual labor?

365
00:25:52,381 --> 00:25:54,211
That's for you to figure out.

366
00:25:54,551 --> 00:25:56,851
I knew it. She's up to something else.

367
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:00,891
Typical Ko Seong Hui.

368
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:04,561
Ji Hyuk!

369
00:26:08,991 --> 00:26:10,361
Ji Hyuk, what is this?

370
00:26:11,401 --> 00:26:13,331
What's wrong? Why are you like this?

371
00:26:14,571 --> 00:26:17,571
Seong Jae, why don't you two take a break?

372
00:26:17,641 --> 00:26:18,771
Ji Wan's here now.

373
00:26:21,471 --> 00:26:22,481
Okay.

374
00:26:28,951 --> 00:26:32,021
Ji Wan, I told you not to make such a fuss.

375
00:26:40,191 --> 00:26:41,191
Ji Hyuk.

376
00:26:42,061 --> 00:26:43,761
Why didn't you tell me?

377
00:26:44,961 --> 00:26:48,901
Your bodyguard gig is over, but you still work with his sister?

378
00:26:49,471 --> 00:26:52,171
- Why didn't you tell me about that? - Come on, that and...

379
00:26:52,441 --> 00:26:53,711
How is this the same thing?

380
00:26:54,811 --> 00:26:56,381
Wow, I'm actually hurt.

381
00:26:58,741 --> 00:27:01,181
So, what kind of work are you doing?

382
00:27:06,221 --> 00:27:07,551
A webtoon story writer.

383
00:27:08,451 --> 00:27:09,791
I didn't know,

384
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:12,361
but I have a knack for it,

385
00:27:12,461 --> 00:27:14,891
so Yeong Ra and I partnered.

386
00:27:15,291 --> 00:27:18,731
Our next series will be published under "Freedom and Mr. Lee."

387
00:27:19,131 --> 00:27:20,771
My pen name is Mr. Lee.

388
00:27:22,331 --> 00:27:23,501
Are you enjoying it?

389
00:27:25,771 --> 00:27:26,771
Yes.

390
00:27:27,341 --> 00:27:28,771
I lose all track of time.

391
00:27:30,581 --> 00:27:31,581
I see.

392
00:27:32,311 --> 00:27:34,351
You should stick with it.

393
00:27:34,981 --> 00:27:36,581
You have to do what you love.

394
00:27:37,551 --> 00:27:40,191
So, what's the story about?

395
00:27:47,491 --> 00:27:48,961
- Bye. - Have a good night.

396
00:27:55,801 --> 00:27:56,901
That's enough, Ji Wan.

397
00:27:58,541 --> 00:28:01,211
Ji Hyuk, do you want me to get you a mirror?

398
00:28:02,171 --> 00:28:04,541
He even washed his face in the bathroom a minute ago.

399
00:28:12,281 --> 00:28:13,691
So it was you.

400
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:16,821
We've met, right? I brought Ji Hyuk's suitcase.

401
00:28:16,891 --> 00:28:18,661
Right. It's good to see you.

402
00:28:19,161 --> 00:28:20,861
Ji Hyuk, how are you feeling today?

403
00:28:21,431 --> 00:28:25,161
Gosh, these guys have been so noisy, I'm exhausted.

404
00:28:28,131 --> 00:28:29,571
All right, we're leaving now.

405
00:28:30,201 --> 00:28:31,971
Let's go, all you useless people.

406
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,871
Ji Hyuk, I'm heading out.

407
00:28:35,611 --> 00:28:38,041
- Hey, have a good time. - Yes.

408
00:28:39,381 --> 00:28:41,651
- Go on. - Bye!

409
00:28:46,051 --> 00:28:47,621
My gosh, Ji Hyuk.

410
00:28:48,021 --> 00:28:50,061
How did you get even more handsome in just one day?

411
00:28:50,861 --> 00:28:52,861
Did you wash your face for me?

412
00:28:54,031 --> 00:28:55,131
Was it that obvious?

413
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:58,731
But you didn't put on any moisturizer.

414
00:28:58,731 --> 00:28:59,931
Let me do it for you.

415
00:29:12,081 --> 00:29:13,281
It's funny.

416
00:29:14,581 --> 00:29:15,581
What is?

417
00:29:16,781 --> 00:29:18,821
To think our first night together...

418
00:29:19,251 --> 00:29:21,421
I never thought we'd be spending it like this.

419
00:29:24,091 --> 00:29:25,191
I'm sorry, Eun Oh.

420
00:29:27,491 --> 00:29:29,961
If only I'd known it would get this bad so quickly,

421
00:29:31,461 --> 00:29:32,801
I would've just held out.

422
00:29:46,081 --> 00:29:48,881
No. Hey, Eun Oh.

423
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:53,051
Hey, Eun Oh, what are you doing?

424
00:29:55,491 --> 00:29:59,861
We must be the only couple in Korea to spend our first night like this.

425
00:30:02,661 --> 00:30:04,401
You sure have a way of spinning things.

426
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:10,541
Ji Hyuk.

427
00:30:11,671 --> 00:30:13,341
Let's just be a little braver.

428
00:30:15,041 --> 00:30:17,681
Now that you're in the hospital getting treatment,

429
00:30:18,211 --> 00:30:19,651
you're going to get better.

430
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:26,221
Besides, I'm going to be here every day.

431
00:30:37,301 --> 00:30:38,331
Anyway...

432
00:30:40,431 --> 00:30:43,801
Isn't it better to have me by your side?

433
00:30:49,381 --> 00:30:50,381
It is.

434
00:30:52,681 --> 00:30:53,711
I like this, too.

435
00:31:17,571 --> 00:31:18,941
My name is Lee Sang Cheol.

436
00:31:19,471 --> 00:31:22,241
I was desperately looking for a job,

437
00:31:22,411 --> 00:31:25,211
and I guess it was all leading me to this place.

438
00:31:25,481 --> 00:31:29,011
I'll do my best. I look forward to working with you.

439
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:30,821
Let's give him a round of applause.

440
00:31:31,251 --> 00:31:32,251
Welcome aboard.

441
00:31:39,361 --> 00:31:40,361
It's good, right?

442
00:31:41,091 --> 00:31:42,091
- It's sweet. - Right?

443
00:31:46,901 --> 00:31:47,901
You must've been bored.

444
00:31:48,571 --> 00:31:50,271
I came to show you that thing I was talking about.

445
00:31:52,171 --> 00:31:53,741
Ji Hyuk, have you eaten?

446
00:31:59,781 --> 00:32:00,781
Are you okay?

447
00:32:01,451 --> 00:32:02,581
What's the word today?

448
00:32:06,421 --> 00:32:08,591
Your levels have gotten worse.

449
00:32:10,091 --> 00:32:11,721
We're not seeing any signs of recovery.

450
00:32:20,971 --> 00:32:23,871
I might never leave this hospital.

451
00:32:30,011 --> 00:32:32,511
Cheol Min, if you open my laptop,

452
00:32:32,881 --> 00:32:35,981
I've written down the names of all the folders I organized.

453
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:39,181
And in my desk drawer, you'll find a flash drive.

454
00:32:39,921 --> 00:32:42,991
I've organized all of this year's projects on it.

455
00:32:44,321 --> 00:32:45,321
Understood.

456
00:32:45,961 --> 00:32:47,831
Hey, why are you already talking about this stuff?

457
00:32:49,431 --> 00:32:50,501
Come on, you know why.

458
00:32:51,101 --> 00:32:53,431
I could go at any time.

459
00:32:54,531 --> 00:32:57,471
They said I was a ticking time bomb from the start.

460
00:32:57,671 --> 00:33:00,311
You already spoke with the Chairman. It's all settled.

461
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:01,871
So that's that, man.

462
00:33:02,911 --> 00:33:05,711
I was curious how things were going at the company,

463
00:33:06,481 --> 00:33:08,381
and I wanted to see Cheol Min, too.

464
00:33:11,081 --> 00:33:12,821
I'll be on my way then.

465
00:33:13,721 --> 00:33:14,721
Mr. Lee.

466
00:33:15,391 --> 00:33:16,421
I'll see you again.

467
00:33:17,521 --> 00:33:18,521
I'm counting on you.

468
00:33:27,801 --> 00:33:29,501
By the way, what's this you asked me to bring?

469
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:32,141
You're not seriously going to work from here, are you?

470
00:33:33,941 --> 00:33:34,941
No.

471
00:33:39,141 --> 00:33:40,151
This is...

472
00:33:41,251 --> 00:33:42,251
for you.

473
00:33:46,851 --> 00:33:47,851
What is it?

474
00:33:49,591 --> 00:33:50,861
It's a list of favors.

475
00:33:51,461 --> 00:33:52,461
Read it.

476
00:34:02,801 --> 00:34:03,801
No.

477
00:34:07,941 --> 00:34:08,941
Seong Jae.

478
00:34:13,611 --> 00:34:14,711
I want to go for a little walk.

479
00:34:25,791 --> 00:34:26,931
You didn't want Eun Oh...

480
00:34:27,831 --> 00:34:29,261
to see you like this.

481
00:34:30,631 --> 00:34:31,661
Of course not, man.

482
00:34:35,471 --> 00:34:38,201
But you're getting worse. Are you sure you'll be okay?

483
00:34:39,841 --> 00:34:40,841
This is the first time.

484
00:34:42,441 --> 00:34:44,111
A little walk should be fine.

485
00:34:46,511 --> 00:34:48,381
I'm just going to enjoy the view.

486
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:51,421
Go on, read it.

487
00:35:05,531 --> 00:35:06,531
Seong Jae.

488
00:35:07,131 --> 00:35:08,671
Like my grandmother,

489
00:35:09,331 --> 00:35:10,401
I want my ashes scattered at sea.

490
00:35:22,551 --> 00:35:25,221
Fine. You might as well be the son in my family.

491
00:35:25,821 --> 00:35:26,821
Just...

492
00:35:27,691 --> 00:35:30,321
look after Su Bin for me.

493
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,431
And as for my dad...

494
00:35:41,371 --> 00:35:42,431
You crazy jerk.

495
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:45,271
If I'd known this is what it was, I never would have read it.

496
00:35:46,671 --> 00:35:47,771
You're on borrowed time, too.

497
00:35:48,671 --> 00:35:50,411
Everyone is.

498
00:35:52,511 --> 00:35:54,381
Come on, stop crying.

499
00:35:55,311 --> 00:35:56,781
What, you think you're going to live forever?

500
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:07,931
But, Seong Jae...

501
00:36:11,231 --> 00:36:12,301
I want to live.

502
00:36:16,101 --> 00:36:18,001
When I went down to Cheongpo,

503
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:22,011
I said I felt like I'd already died once before.

504
00:36:24,941 --> 00:36:28,781
I learned the hard way that life never goes your way,

505
00:36:30,581 --> 00:36:31,681
and after that,

506
00:36:33,221 --> 00:36:34,221
I found myself.

507
00:36:35,921 --> 00:36:37,821
I was just grateful to have found my own path.

508
00:36:40,061 --> 00:36:41,661
After all, everyone...

509
00:36:43,161 --> 00:36:44,631
has to die eventually.

510
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:48,531
So I decided that with the time I had left...

511
00:36:51,241 --> 00:36:52,241
Today...

512
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:57,611
I decided I would live for today.

513
00:37:01,481 --> 00:37:03,381
You think it just happens because you decide it will?

514
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:08,621
I thought it did.

515
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:15,891
Why does everything feel so perfect right now?

516
00:37:20,901 --> 00:37:22,901
I'm starting to understand my mom a little,

517
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:28,941
and my dad a little bit, too.

518
00:37:32,411 --> 00:37:34,651
I can picture a future with Eun Oh.

519
00:37:38,421 --> 00:37:41,191
And I finally know how I'm supposed to live my life,

520
00:37:48,661 --> 00:37:49,961
but now it's telling me it's time to leave.

521
00:37:54,631 --> 00:37:57,271
So, you've already given up on yourself?

522
00:37:59,001 --> 00:38:00,911
How can you expect to live when you're preparing for this crap?

523
00:38:01,871 --> 00:38:02,971
Who said anything about dying?

524
00:38:03,641 --> 00:38:04,841
Why are you preparing to die?

525
00:38:06,341 --> 00:38:07,351
Hey, Ji Hyuk.

526
00:38:09,281 --> 00:38:10,351
So, please...

527
00:38:14,721 --> 00:38:15,991
If I stop preparing to die,

528
00:38:18,961 --> 00:38:19,961
do you think I'll get to live?

529
00:38:24,961 --> 00:38:26,731
I just want to live a little longer.

530
00:38:30,071 --> 00:38:32,501
I just want one more year.

531
00:38:36,511 --> 00:38:37,511
Ji Hyuk, are you okay?

532
00:38:39,611 --> 00:38:40,611
Are you okay?

533
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:42,681
Ji Hyuk!

534
00:38:44,421 --> 00:38:49,051
Ji Hyuk's heart declined rapidly, so we've put him on ECMO.

535
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:51,361
ECMO?

536
00:38:52,221 --> 00:38:55,591
What? Has he really gotten that much worse already?

537
00:38:56,561 --> 00:38:59,661
ECMO... You can't be on it for long, can you?

538
00:39:00,501 --> 00:39:04,571
In some cases, the heart can recover with just ECMO,

539
00:39:05,341 --> 00:39:10,281
but with dilated cardiomyopathy, the heart muscle is already damaged.

540
00:39:11,441 --> 00:39:14,551
ECMO is just a bridge...

541
00:39:15,111 --> 00:39:16,281
to keep him going until a heart transplant.

542
00:39:18,351 --> 00:39:19,651
- Mom! - Honey!

543
00:39:19,721 --> 00:39:21,021
Mom, are you okay?

544
00:39:22,091 --> 00:39:23,661
At the very end, you're put on a machine called ECMO,

545
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:25,761
a machine that circulates your blood.

546
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:30,061
Once on it, you need a new heart within a week or two.

547
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:52,551
So it's come to this after all.

548
00:39:55,491 --> 00:39:56,491
Mom, Dad...

549
00:39:58,721 --> 00:39:59,721
I'm so sorry.

550
00:40:10,071 --> 00:40:11,071
Eun Oh.

551
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:14,811
Thank you for everything.

552
00:40:17,381 --> 00:40:18,381
And I'm sorry.

553
00:40:19,741 --> 00:40:21,181
You're getting ahead of yourself again.

554
00:40:23,211 --> 00:40:25,351
Everything I want from you...

555
00:40:28,991 --> 00:40:29,991
You already know, don't you?

556
00:40:35,231 --> 00:40:37,101
Whether I get better or not...

557
00:40:39,101 --> 00:40:40,501
Mom, Dad...

558
00:40:41,501 --> 00:40:43,101
You have to keep on living just as you are.

559
00:40:46,141 --> 00:40:47,141
Thank you for everything.

560
00:40:48,141 --> 00:40:50,211
We'll talk again tomorrow and the day after.

561
00:40:51,181 --> 00:40:52,181
Save your strength, son.

562
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:55,411
That's right, Ji Hyuk.

563
00:40:56,111 --> 00:40:57,351
Listen to your father.

564
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:00,921
Please, just listen to your father.

565
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:20,141
Goodness, honey. Come on!

566
00:41:20,741 --> 00:41:22,111
Stop being so stubborn.

567
00:41:22,611 --> 00:41:24,181
Su Bin, Ji Wan, and Eun Oh...

568
00:41:24,481 --> 00:41:25,941
are at the hospital watching over him right now.

569
00:41:26,541 --> 00:41:28,111
I'm just so anxious.

570
00:41:28,451 --> 00:41:31,081
I said I wanted to stay! Why did you drag me home?

571
00:41:31,451 --> 00:41:33,991
Goodness, that's enough. Come on, come here.

572
00:41:35,191 --> 00:41:36,721
Go on, get inside.

573
00:41:39,421 --> 00:41:40,931
Who do you think you are, keeping me here?

574
00:41:41,161 --> 00:41:43,361
I just want to stay near my son!

575
00:41:43,531 --> 00:41:46,801
If you go back, at least wash up and grab a change of clothes first.

576
00:41:47,431 --> 00:41:48,871
You need to take a breather. Okay?

577
00:41:49,201 --> 00:41:52,171
My son is taking his last breaths, and you want me to catch mine?

578
00:41:52,241 --> 00:41:53,441
What for?

579
00:41:53,671 --> 00:41:57,011
Why are you so frantic? You think he's going to die any second?

580
00:41:57,411 --> 00:41:59,111
He's on an ECMO machine!

581
00:42:00,481 --> 00:42:01,681
At best, he only has 2 or 3 weeks.

582
00:42:02,151 --> 00:42:05,751
No, if there are complications, he might not even last a week.

583
00:42:06,421 --> 00:42:08,221
If Ji Hyuk doesn't get a heart in that time,

584
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:10,961
our Ji Hyuk will die.

585
00:42:11,521 --> 00:42:12,891
He's going to die!

586
00:42:13,161 --> 00:42:16,291
- What am I going to do? - I hate it when you get like this!

587
00:42:18,731 --> 00:42:21,001
Why do you keep saying he's dying?

588
00:42:21,801 --> 00:42:25,171
He could last longer on ECMO, right? Who knows?

589
00:42:25,541 --> 00:42:27,271
There are still things like miracles in this world.

590
00:42:28,441 --> 00:42:32,481
What kind of mother talks like she's counting the days he has left?

591
00:42:34,211 --> 00:42:35,211
Am I?

592
00:42:36,051 --> 00:42:37,051
Is that right?

593
00:42:38,451 --> 00:42:39,851
Is that really what I'm doing?

594
00:42:41,891 --> 00:42:43,351
No, honey, that's not what I meant.

595
00:42:44,391 --> 00:42:47,131
A heart will come. We just have to have faith. Okay?

596
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:55,671
When you...

597
00:42:56,431 --> 00:42:59,141
insist on waiting outside the ICU all the time,

598
00:42:59,641 --> 00:43:03,111
it's like you're just waiting for him to die.

599
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:06,241
No, that's not it.

600
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:08,351
Then...

601
00:43:09,181 --> 00:43:11,451
why not just go during the ICU's visiting hours?

602
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:14,421
And with the store, you can either take time off,

603
00:43:14,421 --> 00:43:16,861
or adjust your work hours around the visiting times.

604
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:19,291
How can you be talking about that right now?

605
00:43:19,821 --> 00:43:21,461
When our Ji Hyuk is in there fighting for his life?

606
00:43:22,691 --> 00:43:23,701
But what...

607
00:43:24,131 --> 00:43:26,731
can we do? What can we possibly do for him?

608
00:43:31,801 --> 00:43:32,801
Do you know...

609
00:43:35,611 --> 00:43:37,811
what I said to Ji Hyuk?

610
00:43:39,441 --> 00:43:43,981
I work hard to take care of myself and not rely on my children.

611
00:43:44,381 --> 00:43:46,681
You have no right to pity me.

612
00:43:47,321 --> 00:43:50,321
I guess it's because this is so out of character for me.

613
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:52,991
That's why they say if someone acts out of character,

614
00:43:52,991 --> 00:43:54,731
it means their time is almost up.

615
00:43:55,891 --> 00:43:57,001
Honestly.

616
00:44:00,171 --> 00:44:01,171
I guess you're right.

617
00:44:04,071 --> 00:44:05,471
I should've been doing this all along.

618
00:44:08,741 --> 00:44:10,781
Ji Hyuk was probably worried that he was going to die,

619
00:44:11,981 --> 00:44:14,251
and that's why he was trying to take care of me,

620
00:44:15,351 --> 00:44:16,351
but me?

621
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:19,221
I asked him why he was being so nice all of a sudden...

622
00:44:20,721 --> 00:44:23,321
and joked that it must mean he was about to die.

623
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:26,621
And I laughed.

624
00:44:29,061 --> 00:44:31,401
I actually laughed.

625
00:44:32,031 --> 00:44:33,331
Like a crazy witch!

626
00:44:35,701 --> 00:44:38,101
You didn't know. How could you have known?

627
00:44:41,041 --> 00:44:43,911
Imagine how much Ji Hyuk must have been suffering back then.

628
00:44:50,251 --> 00:44:53,051
And he must want to live so badly.

629
00:44:54,021 --> 00:44:55,721
And that girl, Eun Oh, she's so lovely.

630
00:44:58,761 --> 00:45:00,961
He had parents who couldn't even support his dreams,

631
00:45:01,831 --> 00:45:04,931
and he was ready to give up on marriage to get by.

632
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:07,071
But then, he met Eun Oh,

633
00:45:07,931 --> 00:45:09,301
and his business finally became successful.

634
00:45:11,541 --> 00:45:13,371
Without a single dime from us,

635
00:45:14,971 --> 00:45:16,671
he managed to build a good life for himself.

636
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:20,141
Imagine how many regrets he must have.

637
00:45:21,381 --> 00:45:22,711
How can he bear to leave it all behind?

638
00:45:25,351 --> 00:45:27,951
- No! No, this can't happen! - Honey.

639
00:45:29,591 --> 00:45:32,891
I can't let Ji Hyuk go! I can't let him go!

640
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:35,261
Honey, please calm down.

641
00:45:38,301 --> 00:45:42,231
Honey, what are we going to do? We have to do something.

642
00:45:42,771 --> 00:45:46,041
We have to do something, anything! Right?

643
00:45:50,011 --> 00:45:52,441
Honey. Kill me.

644
00:45:53,011 --> 00:45:54,281
I want you to stab me.

645
00:45:56,751 --> 00:45:58,221
Honey, stab me.

646
00:45:58,681 --> 00:46:02,191
Take me to the hospital before I breathe my last...

647
00:46:02,191 --> 00:46:03,421
and turn yourself in.

648
00:46:04,091 --> 00:46:07,261
So they can take out my heart, okay?

649
00:46:07,791 --> 00:46:10,601
What... What are you saying?

650
00:46:11,061 --> 00:46:14,171
Why would I care about my own life when our son is dying this young?

651
00:46:14,231 --> 00:46:15,831
What's the point of me living any longer?

652
00:46:16,931 --> 00:46:19,771
If you don't do it, I'll jump off the hospital roof.

653
00:46:20,271 --> 00:46:24,281
Come on, snap out of it. You have to be brain-dead to donate.

654
00:46:24,811 --> 00:46:25,811
I know.

655
00:46:26,541 --> 00:46:29,311
But still, if they take out my heart before I die...

656
00:46:29,651 --> 00:46:32,281
I can just leave a will asking them to do it.

657
00:46:32,821 --> 00:46:36,291
That I want it done before my heart stops.

658
00:46:36,491 --> 00:46:38,661
That it's my final wish.

659
00:46:39,221 --> 00:46:42,391
Are you out of your mind? What are you even talking about?

660
00:46:43,031 --> 00:46:46,601
Who'd operate on a living person? Who?

661
00:46:47,501 --> 00:46:50,071
If I'm lucky, I might end up brain-dead.

662
00:46:53,001 --> 00:46:54,511
You... I can't even...

663
00:46:55,911 --> 00:46:57,681
And me? What about me?

664
00:46:58,411 --> 00:47:00,481
Do you think I won't do it because I'm afraid to die?

665
00:47:01,181 --> 00:47:04,951
I'd die for him, too! I would! I could even kill you!

666
00:47:06,021 --> 00:47:08,491
Then do it. So why won't you?

667
00:47:09,591 --> 00:47:13,591
Da Jeong, please. Please just calm down.

668
00:47:13,591 --> 00:47:15,161
Please calm down, okay?

669
00:47:16,931 --> 00:47:20,401
I can't bear to watch Ji Hyuk die.

670
00:47:22,271 --> 00:47:23,331
Let go!

671
00:47:23,531 --> 00:47:25,741
What's the point of me living on after he's gone?

672
00:47:26,371 --> 00:47:28,471
- Don't try to stop me! - Honey, no! Don't!

673
00:47:28,911 --> 00:47:30,511
Please! Just stop!

674
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:31,881
No, move!

675
00:47:33,041 --> 00:47:36,651
- Get out of my way! Move! - Please...

676
00:47:43,291 --> 00:47:45,521
What do I do?

677
00:47:51,661 --> 00:47:52,661
What am I going to do?

678
00:47:56,171 --> 00:47:58,571
What am I supposed to do?

679
00:48:04,311 --> 00:48:05,311
Please.

680
00:48:06,181 --> 00:48:08,281
If you were going to take him away so soon,

681
00:48:08,751 --> 00:48:09,911
why did you ever give him to me?

682
00:48:11,481 --> 00:48:15,191
What did I do so wrong to deserve burying my own son?

683
00:48:17,021 --> 00:48:18,021
Please, take me...

684
00:48:18,561 --> 00:48:21,831
Take me instead. Please, take me.

685
00:48:24,031 --> 00:48:25,801
Because he had a wretch like me for a father,

686
00:48:27,171 --> 00:48:29,331
that boy has already suffered so much.

687
00:48:30,571 --> 00:48:34,811
Please just let him stay in this world.

688
00:48:37,711 --> 00:48:40,481
This kid... You're out of your mind!

689
00:48:40,711 --> 00:48:43,381
You never should've sold yourself out for money, you fool!

690
00:48:44,951 --> 00:48:47,351
I shouldn't have been so harsh.

691
00:48:48,451 --> 00:48:49,551
Get out! Right now!

692
00:48:50,421 --> 00:48:51,691
What? You won't leave?

693
00:48:51,991 --> 00:48:54,261
Fine. Then I'll be the one to leave, you brat!

694
00:48:55,961 --> 00:48:57,501
Not even knowing what my son was going through,

695
00:48:57,931 --> 00:48:59,401
I just went on playing the part of a father.

696
00:49:00,301 --> 00:49:01,301
You...

697
00:49:01,831 --> 00:49:03,371
defied everything I stood for.

698
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:06,901
You made me feel like my whole life has been a waste.

699
00:49:07,471 --> 00:49:10,011
My life as a provider, a father, and a son...

700
00:49:10,071 --> 00:49:12,711
You completely trampled all over it, you brat.

701
00:49:22,821 --> 00:49:24,691
Who do you think you are, Lee Sang Cheol?

702
00:49:26,191 --> 00:49:30,061
What's so great about the life you've lived?

703
00:49:31,701 --> 00:49:34,031
You, who couldn't even live a life to be proud of.

704
00:49:35,871 --> 00:49:39,041
Until you get on your knees and beg for my forgiveness,

705
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:41,871
don't you dare call me your father.

706
00:49:51,721 --> 00:49:52,721
Father.

707
00:49:56,151 --> 00:49:57,221
I was wrong.

708
00:49:59,521 --> 00:50:00,531
I...

709
00:50:02,091 --> 00:50:05,861
I was the one who was wrong. I was wrong, Ji Hyuk.

710
00:50:06,801 --> 00:50:11,301
Your dad... Your dad was wrong. I'm so sorry.

711
00:50:14,111 --> 00:50:16,641
I'm so sorry.

712
00:50:29,421 --> 00:50:31,821
- Isn't it so sweet? - Yes, it is.

713
00:50:33,361 --> 00:50:34,431
Eun Oh.

714
00:50:35,631 --> 00:50:38,431
Mom, you didn't go to the restaurant today?

715
00:50:39,261 --> 00:50:40,931
The restaurant is closed today, Eun Oh.

716
00:50:41,331 --> 00:50:43,131
Speaking of which, why are you home so early?

717
00:50:43,501 --> 00:50:44,701
Didn't you go to the hospital?

718
00:50:46,371 --> 00:50:47,541
I did, but...

719
00:50:50,241 --> 00:50:51,741
- My gosh! What's wrong? - Eun Oh.

720
00:50:51,811 --> 00:50:53,741
- Gosh, Eun Oh. - Eun Oh.

721
00:50:53,741 --> 00:50:55,351
- Eun Oh! - Eun Oh.

722
00:50:56,281 --> 00:50:58,281
- Eun Oh. My goodness. - Eun Oh.

723
00:51:05,591 --> 00:51:07,591
Eun Oh, can you get up?

724
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:13,501
- Here, drink some water. - Here you go.

725
00:51:24,541 --> 00:51:25,711
What's wrong?

726
00:51:26,341 --> 00:51:28,551
Did something happen to that young CEO?

727
00:51:33,451 --> 00:51:35,351
He was put on ECMO today.

728
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:39,191
In the next week or two,

729
00:51:40,391 --> 00:51:42,561
if we can't miraculously find a heart,

730
00:51:45,561 --> 00:51:46,931
he will die, Mom.

731
00:51:48,871 --> 00:51:49,871
What?

732
00:51:52,141 --> 00:51:55,071
I should've just said yes when he told me he liked me.

733
00:51:57,211 --> 00:52:00,141
I shouldn't have hated him for marrying for money.

734
00:52:00,211 --> 00:52:01,681
He had his reasons...

735
00:52:02,181 --> 00:52:05,221
I guess I caused him too much stress for too long.

736
00:52:05,751 --> 00:52:08,121
I got angry, looked down on him, and ignored him.

737
00:52:08,591 --> 00:52:10,191
I shouldn't have done any of it.

738
00:52:11,221 --> 00:52:15,291
I shouldn't have. I never knew I'd lose him this way.

739
00:52:15,391 --> 00:52:17,401
I...

740
00:52:20,101 --> 00:52:23,731
I wish I could cut out my own heart and give it to him, Mom.

741
00:52:24,701 --> 00:52:27,641
- Eun Oh, what do we do? - What do I do?

742
00:52:28,571 --> 00:52:29,811
What are we going to do?

743
00:52:40,051 --> 00:52:41,191
(Jingsuchon)

744
00:52:42,221 --> 00:52:44,791
My goodness, that's too heavy. Let me get that for you.

745
00:52:44,861 --> 00:52:48,031
- No, you really don't have to. - It's no problem.

746
00:52:48,031 --> 00:52:50,191
- Thank you. - Mr. Choi.

747
00:52:50,561 --> 00:52:51,931
Hey, don't play favorites.

748
00:52:52,601 --> 00:52:57,171
If you favor her like that, the other employees will get upset.

749
00:52:59,441 --> 00:53:00,441
Yes.

750
00:53:06,441 --> 00:53:10,281
Her ankles and wrists are so thin, they look like they'll snap.

751
00:53:10,351 --> 00:53:13,921
How could I just stand by and watch a delicate lady like her?

752
00:53:14,451 --> 00:53:16,551
She's in a different league from the other ladies here.

753
00:53:18,121 --> 00:53:21,731
Be careful. Don't make it so obvious you think she's pretty.

754
00:53:21,931 --> 00:53:24,901
What will you do if rumors start? A married man like you!

755
00:53:26,061 --> 00:53:28,031
It's just because I feel sorry for her.

756
00:53:28,601 --> 00:53:31,601
I heard she fled her abusive husband with nothing to her name.

757
00:53:32,671 --> 00:53:34,871
- Go have your meal. - Okay.

758
00:53:37,311 --> 00:53:38,681
You already finished the rolled omelet.

759
00:53:39,511 --> 00:53:42,251
- Thank you. Thank you so much. - Thank you.

760
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:44,551
Thank you.

761
00:53:51,591 --> 00:53:52,961
She's so thoughtful, too.

762
00:53:53,321 --> 00:53:55,891
How can someone be so quiet and classy?

763
00:54:10,981 --> 00:54:12,741
Did he just play golf and go straight home?

764
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:15,451
What about his weekday evening plans?

765
00:54:17,181 --> 00:54:18,251
And during the day?

766
00:54:20,081 --> 00:54:22,991
He can leave the office anytime. Were you watching him closely?

767
00:54:24,591 --> 00:54:27,761
Watch him from when he goes to work until the moment he gets home.

768
00:54:28,691 --> 00:54:29,931
And from now on,

769
00:54:30,191 --> 00:54:32,861
you must take pictures of any woman he's with. No exceptions.

770
00:54:33,861 --> 00:54:36,301
Cafe servers, store clerks, at the golf course,

771
00:54:36,771 --> 00:54:39,241
any woman at a group dinner, at his regular restaurants.

772
00:54:39,641 --> 00:54:40,771
Send me photos every day.

773
00:54:49,151 --> 00:54:50,151
Right.

774
00:54:50,821 --> 00:54:52,721
It's only been a week since I put a tail on him.

775
00:54:55,751 --> 00:54:57,191
(Mr. Choi)

776
00:55:03,561 --> 00:55:05,401
(Mr. Choi)

777
00:55:10,601 --> 00:55:12,441
(Mr. Choi)

778
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:15,541
Hello?

779
00:55:15,871 --> 00:55:18,511
Ms. Jin, it's me, Choi Il Woo.

780
00:55:19,611 --> 00:55:21,551
Yes, Mr. Choi.

781
00:55:22,551 --> 00:55:23,751
What's this about?

782
00:55:24,381 --> 00:55:26,221
You said the lawyer's fee was 20,000 dollars, right?

783
00:55:27,021 --> 00:55:28,721
I'll lend you that money.

784
00:55:29,891 --> 00:55:30,891
What?

785
00:55:30,991 --> 00:55:32,621
That was fast.

786
00:55:33,221 --> 00:55:35,231
When was your day off again?

787
00:55:36,031 --> 00:55:37,191
Next Monday, right?

788
00:55:37,761 --> 00:55:38,801
Let's meet then.

789
00:55:40,701 --> 00:55:42,331
I don't know, Mr. Choi.

790
00:55:43,171 --> 00:55:47,271
I know I should buy you a drink to thank you properly, but...

791
00:55:48,671 --> 00:55:51,241
I'm still technically married.

792
00:55:52,781 --> 00:55:54,611
You never know who might be watching.

793
00:55:55,551 --> 00:55:58,551
Let me thank you properly after I file the lawsuit.

794
00:56:02,891 --> 00:56:05,661
If that bothers you, you don't have to lend me the money.

795
00:56:05,991 --> 00:56:07,061
No, not at all.

796
00:56:07,491 --> 00:56:09,961
I'm just offering because I feel for you.

797
00:56:11,261 --> 00:56:13,131
So how should I get the money to you?

798
00:56:16,601 --> 00:56:18,741
Then...

799
00:56:27,881 --> 00:56:30,851
I've almost run out of the money Yeong Ra gave me. It's a lifesaver.

800
00:56:32,951 --> 00:56:35,291
It costs 20,000 dollars to tail him for 3 months.

801
00:56:36,321 --> 00:56:39,491
Honey, I know exactly what kind of man you are.

802
00:56:39,861 --> 00:56:41,431
Spending your nights alone without me?

803
00:56:42,591 --> 00:56:44,561
There's no way you'll last three months.

804
00:56:52,071 --> 00:56:53,771
(Jingsuchon)

805
00:56:53,841 --> 00:56:56,511
Man, I'm hungry early today.

806
00:56:57,711 --> 00:57:00,611
Well, I'll have the usual.

807
00:57:01,451 --> 00:57:03,381
Even though I need that 20,000 dollars,

808
00:57:03,781 --> 00:57:06,951
I'm not about to lower myself to your level.

809
00:57:08,051 --> 00:57:10,821
- Welcome. Please have a seat. - Thank you.

810
00:57:10,821 --> 00:57:12,621
Ma'am, one order of kimchi jjigae.

811
00:57:16,861 --> 00:57:19,531
When I bring over the side dishes, please leave it on the table.

812
00:57:20,461 --> 00:57:22,401
(Jingsuchon)

813
00:57:37,751 --> 00:57:38,751
Excuse me.

814
00:57:39,751 --> 00:57:41,021
One kimchi jjigae, please.

815
00:57:51,901 --> 00:57:53,401
He tracked me down here?

816
00:57:57,071 --> 00:57:59,371
So he was determined to see me brought this low.

817
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:04,171
Hey, why are you just standing there?

818
00:58:21,491 --> 00:58:22,661
Hey, Choi Il Woo!

819
00:58:24,601 --> 00:58:25,601
Move.

820
00:58:26,101 --> 00:58:28,431
Why did you take out 20,000 dollars from the bank?

821
00:58:30,171 --> 00:58:33,841
You said you took it out to lend to a friend!

822
00:58:33,941 --> 00:58:37,171
- Look, let me explain... - Oh, what is this?

823
00:58:37,271 --> 00:58:38,281
Hey!

824
00:58:40,981 --> 00:58:43,351
Wow, it really is 20,000 dollars!

825
00:58:43,851 --> 00:58:46,781
How did you know about this?

826
00:58:50,521 --> 00:58:51,521
What?

827
00:58:52,321 --> 00:58:56,461
Oh, that gentleman over there told me.

828
00:58:58,231 --> 00:58:59,661
Hey, who are you?

829
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:01,401
What's your deal?

830
00:59:02,201 --> 00:59:04,501
Me? As for who I am...

831
00:59:06,071 --> 00:59:07,541
That lady over there knows exactly who I am.

832
00:59:13,911 --> 00:59:17,481
- Come here, you jerk. Come on! - Just a second.

833
00:59:17,551 --> 00:59:20,081
- Let's go! - No, wait, Ms. Jin!

834
00:59:20,781 --> 00:59:23,251
Wait, let go. Hey! Let go, and we can talk.

835
00:59:23,251 --> 00:59:26,061
- Come on! - My ear! You're tearing it off!

836
00:59:26,161 --> 00:59:27,191
Good grief.

837
00:59:28,391 --> 00:59:30,031
What is all this commotion?

838
00:59:35,501 --> 00:59:36,631
Ma'am, the check.

839
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:40,701
(10 dollars)

840
00:59:44,481 --> 00:59:45,641
I'm paying for his, too.

841
00:59:47,511 --> 00:59:48,551
The rest...

842
00:59:49,111 --> 00:59:50,111
is your tip.

843
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:55,851
Well...

844
00:59:56,591 --> 00:59:58,591
I told you not to have any ambitions.

845
01:00:16,541 --> 01:00:20,481
So you know everything. You can read me like a book.

846
01:00:21,551 --> 01:00:23,351
So this is really how you want me to live.

847
01:00:24,151 --> 01:00:28,051
You want me to live as Ko Seong Hui, a nobody working at stores.

848
01:00:45,201 --> 01:00:48,211
Take photos of any woman he's with. No exceptions.

849
01:00:51,311 --> 01:00:52,641
What, are you laughing?

850
01:00:53,411 --> 01:00:55,511
You make a huge scene at my restaurant,

851
01:00:55,511 --> 01:00:56,551
and you're laughing?

852
01:00:57,011 --> 01:00:58,351
You're fired!

853
01:01:16,771 --> 01:01:19,371
Park Jin Seok. I surrender.

854
01:01:20,301 --> 01:01:21,911
There's no beating you.

855
01:01:23,171 --> 01:01:25,011
And you'll never agree to a divorce,

856
01:01:25,541 --> 01:01:28,181
which means there's no way to clear the mortgage.

857
01:01:31,881 --> 01:01:33,151
There's no way out.

858
01:01:34,951 --> 01:01:36,351
But I can't live like that.

859
01:01:37,591 --> 01:01:39,821
I'd rather die. I can't live like that.

860
01:02:30,341 --> 01:02:31,341
All right.

861
01:02:32,911 --> 01:02:34,951
I'll bet the rest of my life on it.

862
01:02:37,351 --> 01:02:38,981
Live or die.

863
01:02:41,951 --> 01:02:43,991
Whether it kills me or saves me.

864
01:02:47,221 --> 01:02:48,291
Fate.

865
01:02:50,231 --> 01:02:51,761
It's up to you.

866
01:02:55,401 --> 01:02:56,401
I...

867
01:03:00,871 --> 01:03:02,011
I can't do this anymore.

868
01:04:03,871 --> 01:04:06,401
Mr. Lee Ji Hyuk, can you hear me?

869
01:04:07,871 --> 01:04:08,871
(Emergency Call)

870
01:04:09,841 --> 01:04:12,111
Mr. Lee Ji Hyuk!

871
01:04:14,081 --> 01:04:17,751
Hi, I'm here to see Lee Ji Hyuk. I'm his younger brother.

872
01:04:17,851 --> 01:04:20,721
Oh, he can't have visitors right now.

873
01:04:20,881 --> 01:04:22,851
He's unconscious and receiving emergency care.

874
01:04:23,851 --> 01:04:28,131
- What do you mean he's unconscious? - He's currently in a coma.

875
01:04:37,031 --> 01:04:38,701
(Younger son)

876
01:04:40,941 --> 01:04:42,371
Hey, Ji Wan. What's up?

877
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:46,381
What?

878
01:04:48,751 --> 01:04:52,151
(Construction Hall)

879
01:05:13,901 --> 01:05:16,541
You bring Mom and hurry over.

880
01:05:18,041 --> 01:05:20,211
And break it to her gently.

881
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:25,851
(Dad)

882
01:05:27,151 --> 01:05:28,451
Dad?

883
01:05:29,351 --> 01:05:31,151
Are you Lee Sang Cheol's son?

884
01:05:32,621 --> 01:05:33,621
Yes.

885
01:05:39,431 --> 01:05:40,961
My father?

886
01:06:54,101 --> 01:06:56,111
(The series finale airs tomorrow at 8pm.)
