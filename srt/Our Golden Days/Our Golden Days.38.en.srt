00:00:01,742 --> 00:00:03,812
(Episode 38)

2
00:00:23,432 --> 00:00:24,432
Dad.

3
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:29,002
I was wrong.

4
00:00:32,212 --> 00:00:33,812
I was so completely wrong.

5
00:00:34,882 --> 00:00:35,882
What?

6
00:00:36,482 --> 00:00:37,982
What is this all of a sudden?

7
00:00:38,612 --> 00:00:40,452
Why are you suddenly on your knees?

8
00:00:41,722 --> 00:00:44,422
Why didn't you tell me? Why?

9
00:00:46,422 --> 00:00:47,992
Dad, how could you just take that?

10
00:00:49,422 --> 00:00:51,432
You were humiliated like that because of me,

11
00:00:51,862 --> 00:00:54,262
so why didn't you tell me sooner?

12
00:00:55,362 --> 00:00:56,362
Hold on.

13
00:00:56,902 --> 00:00:58,772
What have you heard?

14
00:00:59,772 --> 00:01:01,802
Can you at least explain what this is about?

15
00:01:03,472 --> 00:01:04,712
I met Jung Bo A.

16
00:01:07,612 --> 00:01:08,882
She came back to Korea.

17
00:01:10,582 --> 00:01:11,682
And she found out.

18
00:01:14,012 --> 00:01:16,352
Are you talking about the money for the clothes?

19
00:01:26,392 --> 00:01:30,062
My mother must not have known who you were when she let you in.

20
00:01:30,932 --> 00:01:32,472
Say what you have to say and get out.

21
00:01:34,272 --> 00:01:37,342
The CEO sent me to deliver this.

22
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,172
What's this?

23
00:01:40,872 --> 00:01:42,282
It doesn't look like a letter.

24
00:01:43,542 --> 00:01:46,052
I get the feeling you have a message to deliver as well.

25
00:01:47,852 --> 00:01:49,652
I will relay his exact words.

26
00:01:50,952 --> 00:01:54,192
If we're assigning blame for the wedding being called off,

27
00:01:55,162 --> 00:01:58,262
the CEO and his wife are not at fault.

28
00:01:58,892 --> 00:02:00,562
So they could have just cut all ties,

29
00:02:03,002 --> 00:02:06,132
but out of moral obligation, all the expenses for the wedding...

30
00:02:06,502 --> 00:02:09,042
were paid by CEO Jung Ho Yeong of Haneul Construction.

31
00:02:10,372 --> 00:02:12,612
He knows the groom's family isn't well-off,

32
00:02:13,772 --> 00:02:17,742
and it seems your only expense was for the family's outfits.

33
00:02:18,812 --> 00:02:20,912
He said this is to reimburse you for your out-of-pocket costs.

34
00:02:22,522 --> 00:02:25,252
Reimburse our out-of-pocket costs?

35
00:02:27,192 --> 00:02:29,362
He also said that if you, Lee Ji Hyuk's father,

36
00:02:30,522 --> 00:02:34,162
feel this amount is insufficient,

37
00:02:35,332 --> 00:02:37,532
I am to remind you that Jung Bo A called off the wedding,

38
00:02:38,302 --> 00:02:40,472
and therefore, her father, CEO Jung Ho Yeong,

39
00:02:41,132 --> 00:02:44,472
is not liable for any damages.

40
00:02:44,842 --> 00:02:49,612
So he's taking it out on my son for losing his pathetic daughter.

41
00:02:54,552 --> 00:02:56,582
Fine. Let's see it.

42
00:03:02,062 --> 00:03:03,522
Twenty thousand dollars?

43
00:03:04,592 --> 00:03:05,992
Is my son, Ji Hyuk,

44
00:03:06,762 --> 00:03:07,862
only worth this much to you?

45
00:03:09,762 --> 00:03:11,032
Twenty thousand dollars?

46
00:03:12,632 --> 00:03:14,942
I'm sorry, sir.

47
00:03:19,442 --> 00:03:20,512
Here. Take it back.

48
00:03:21,942 --> 00:03:25,112
If I don't give you this, the CEO will have my head.

49
00:03:25,352 --> 00:03:26,952
If you leave this here,

50
00:03:27,682 --> 00:03:29,722
that jerk, Jung Ho Yeong, will die by my hands.

51
00:03:30,182 --> 00:03:31,182
Got it?

52
00:03:31,752 --> 00:03:34,252
Your side can take responsibility for the damages your daughter did,

53
00:03:34,592 --> 00:03:36,922
and I'll take responsibility for the ones my son caused.

54
00:03:38,332 --> 00:03:42,762
And if I so much as hear the name "Haneul Construction" again,

55
00:03:43,162 --> 00:03:45,902
tell him I'll come over there and kill Jung Ho Yeong myself.

56
00:03:47,272 --> 00:03:49,172
The nerve of him. Like father, like daughter.

57
00:03:49,502 --> 00:03:51,842
How dare he take it out on us when he can't control his own child?

58
00:03:58,312 --> 00:04:00,552
Sang Cheol...

59
00:04:02,552 --> 00:04:04,992
My poor son.

60
00:04:05,622 --> 00:04:07,422
My son, what are we going to do?

61
00:04:08,022 --> 00:04:09,122
My goodness.

62
00:04:09,392 --> 00:04:14,332
How can they be so vile and shameless? My goodness.

63
00:04:15,902 --> 00:04:19,502
It's for the best. We're lucky we didn't become in-laws...

64
00:04:19,602 --> 00:04:22,872
with a jerk like that. Gosh, my son. It's okay.

65
00:04:23,842 --> 00:04:25,642
My goodness, my poor son.

66
00:04:30,542 --> 00:04:32,082
Why didn't you tell me?

67
00:04:34,722 --> 00:04:36,622
That you were humiliated like that because of me.

68
00:04:38,722 --> 00:04:40,252
You should have told me right away.

69
00:04:42,962 --> 00:04:46,392
The bride ran away and ruined the wedding.

70
00:04:47,292 --> 00:04:49,062
"Here's money for your clothes. Now, get lost."

71
00:04:50,562 --> 00:04:54,002
That's the humiliation I suffered. And you ask why I didn't tell you?

72
00:04:55,572 --> 00:04:57,002
How could I possibly tell you?

73
00:04:57,742 --> 00:04:59,012
What was I supposed to say?

74
00:05:00,042 --> 00:05:01,042
That you...

75
00:05:01,542 --> 00:05:03,342
tried to marry a woman...

76
00:05:04,912 --> 00:05:07,012
who was in love with someone else for her money,

77
00:05:07,782 --> 00:05:10,122
and that I was humiliated by it? Should I have said that?

78
00:05:12,292 --> 00:05:13,492
How could I bring that up...

79
00:05:15,262 --> 00:05:17,292
when I knew it would only hurt you more?

80
00:05:18,332 --> 00:05:20,732
What kind of parent attacks their own child's weak spot?

81
00:05:22,532 --> 00:05:23,532
Dad.

82
00:05:26,202 --> 00:05:28,042
So you were just suffering in silence?

83
00:05:28,872 --> 00:05:30,042
Ji Hyuk.

84
00:05:31,272 --> 00:05:33,512
Why did you turn out like this?

85
00:05:33,512 --> 00:05:35,782
I don't think this is how I raised you.

86
00:05:36,682 --> 00:05:38,612
If you believe your life is right,

87
00:05:39,582 --> 00:05:40,852
then just keep believing it.

88
00:05:43,952 --> 00:05:46,122
But don't force your children to agree with you.

89
00:05:46,892 --> 00:05:47,892
I...

90
00:05:48,792 --> 00:05:50,992
haven't done anything wrong to you.

91
00:05:52,162 --> 00:05:56,662
Stop taking your victim complex out on me. All right?

92
00:05:56,862 --> 00:05:59,802
You think you've done nothing wrong?

93
00:06:00,802 --> 00:06:02,542
Oh, you have. You definitely have.

94
00:06:03,002 --> 00:06:05,112
You've done something wrong.

95
00:06:06,712 --> 00:06:07,712
Like what?

96
00:06:08,642 --> 00:06:10,212
What is it, Dad?

97
00:06:10,942 --> 00:06:14,852
I can't tell you, you punk. If you found out...

98
00:06:16,082 --> 00:06:19,222
No. It's not the time. Not yet.

99
00:06:20,322 --> 00:06:21,322
I'm sorry.

100
00:06:25,632 --> 00:06:26,662
I'm sorry.

101
00:06:27,992 --> 00:06:29,462
I'm sorry, Dad.

102
00:06:31,502 --> 00:06:32,832
You rotten kid.

103
00:06:33,702 --> 00:06:38,242
Couldn't you just say "I was wrong" before you knew the whole story?

104
00:06:38,972 --> 00:06:43,142
Was that so much to ask? Why are all you kids so proud?

105
00:06:43,982 --> 00:06:45,782
Your father was telling you how hard it's been.

106
00:06:46,082 --> 00:06:49,422
You just had to say, "I was wrong." Why was that so hard for you?

107
00:06:50,422 --> 00:06:51,752
For everything that went wrong today...

108
00:06:52,192 --> 00:06:53,792
and for the great trouble I've caused you both,

109
00:06:54,492 --> 00:06:57,062
I am truly sorry. I am so sorry.

110
00:06:57,062 --> 00:06:58,532
I apologized.

111
00:06:58,862 --> 00:07:00,332
Not "I was wrong."

112
00:07:00,332 --> 00:07:03,232
That I humiliated you and Mom and never begged for forgiveness.

113
00:07:03,902 --> 00:07:06,572
- Is that what makes you so angry? - You think that's all I am? Angry?

114
00:07:07,132 --> 00:07:10,502
You trampled all over my 33-year career, you punk!

115
00:07:10,572 --> 00:07:12,372
You turned your back on everything I am.

116
00:07:12,372 --> 00:07:14,742
You made me feel like my whole life was for nothing, you punk.

117
00:07:14,842 --> 00:07:18,152
The life I lived as a provider, a father, and a son...

118
00:07:18,212 --> 00:07:20,252
You completely trampled all over it, you little punk!

119
00:07:21,212 --> 00:07:22,452
Back then...

120
00:07:25,452 --> 00:07:27,892
I honestly didn't think I was doing anything wrong.

121
00:07:30,192 --> 00:07:32,532
I thought you had no idea the pain I was in.

122
00:07:34,432 --> 00:07:36,302
I thought you were criticizing me...

123
00:07:37,902 --> 00:07:40,802
for blaming my circumstances.

124
00:07:44,342 --> 00:07:46,872
Even though she still loved another man,

125
00:07:49,842 --> 00:07:51,082
I ignored that...

126
00:07:52,982 --> 00:07:55,952
and tried to marry her just for her status...

127
00:07:58,992 --> 00:08:00,692
The idea that you simply couldn't accept it...

128
00:08:03,422 --> 00:08:05,792
That never even crossed my mind.

129
00:08:07,232 --> 00:08:09,232
Since it never crossed your mind,

130
00:08:09,832 --> 00:08:12,072
I guess that's why you pushed forward with the wedding.

131
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:18,872
I was truly...

132
00:08:19,912 --> 00:08:22,342
I was truly wrong, Dad.

133
00:08:24,642 --> 00:08:25,652
I really was...

134
00:08:28,852 --> 00:08:30,882
I was so wrong.

135
00:08:32,492 --> 00:08:35,162
Those simple words, "I was wrong."

136
00:08:36,592 --> 00:08:38,392
Was it that hard to swallow your pride and say them?

137
00:08:39,392 --> 00:08:40,392
Was it?

138
00:08:44,562 --> 00:08:47,032
You rotten kid. You awful, rotten kid.

139
00:08:47,502 --> 00:08:48,942
You think you're so great, don't you? You brat.

140
00:08:49,202 --> 00:08:50,542
So high and mighty, you punk.

141
00:08:58,382 --> 00:09:00,052
Dad.

142
00:09:14,662 --> 00:09:16,262
Please forgive me...

143
00:09:17,502 --> 00:09:18,832
for my terrible choice.

144
00:09:22,102 --> 00:09:23,102
Mom.

145
00:09:23,702 --> 00:09:26,972
Did Dad and Ji Hyuk really have all that history between them?

146
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,812
I had no idea things were that bad between them.

147
00:09:32,352 --> 00:09:34,312
It's over now. It's finally over.

148
00:09:35,452 --> 00:09:38,622
I guess Grandma wanted them to reconcile as she was leaving us.

149
00:09:41,022 --> 00:09:42,692
On the day when they came by to give us the money,

150
00:09:44,022 --> 00:09:45,392
Grandma and Dad...

151
00:09:45,962 --> 00:09:47,432
must have been so devastated.

152
00:09:49,002 --> 00:09:51,332
The reason your father couldn't let it go for so long...

153
00:09:51,902 --> 00:09:52,972
It all makes sense now.

154
00:09:54,632 --> 00:09:55,642
Come on.

155
00:10:06,852 --> 00:10:08,652
Honey, Ji Hyuk.

156
00:10:09,252 --> 00:10:11,052
We're about to have some ramyeon.

157
00:10:11,382 --> 00:10:14,722
Should I just cook 2 packs for Su Bin and me, or make 4?

158
00:10:17,362 --> 00:10:19,532
Aren't you hungry?

159
00:10:20,892 --> 00:10:21,902
I am hungry.

160
00:10:23,662 --> 00:10:26,232
Aren't you hungry, Dad?

161
00:10:27,602 --> 00:10:29,902
I knew it. I heard your stomach rumbling.

162
00:10:43,382 --> 00:10:46,452
My, I smell ramyeon! Are you guys eating already?

163
00:10:46,852 --> 00:10:49,692
- I'm hungry too. - Okay, I'll make you some.

164
00:10:49,692 --> 00:10:52,392
Mom, come on. You're not even fully recovered yet.

165
00:10:53,332 --> 00:10:55,532
Hey, Su Bin. You don't want a puffy face.

166
00:10:55,602 --> 00:10:56,602
You're not drinking the broth, are you?

167
00:10:56,662 --> 00:10:58,432
I'm feeling empty inside. I need the broth.

168
00:10:59,302 --> 00:11:00,472
Then just wait a minute.

169
00:11:08,882 --> 00:11:10,982
Wow, this is amazing. Bean sprout ramyeon.

170
00:11:16,422 --> 00:11:18,522
It's only been a few days since your grandmother passed,

171
00:11:18,892 --> 00:11:20,752
and here we are enjoying ramyeon...

172
00:11:22,092 --> 00:11:23,592
with bean sprouts and everything.

173
00:11:25,132 --> 00:11:28,802
Mom, stop talking like you should feel guilty.

174
00:11:29,762 --> 00:11:31,332
Go to any wake.

175
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,772
You think the chief mourners starve for three whole days?

176
00:11:34,272 --> 00:11:37,972
They cry, then they get hungry, so they eat.

177
00:11:38,942 --> 00:11:40,272
That's just being human.

178
00:11:41,012 --> 00:11:45,482
That's right. At the funeral, I had the soup and rice they served.

179
00:11:48,212 --> 00:11:50,582
But, Ji Hyuk, why are you so quiet? Just eating your ramyeon.

180
00:11:51,922 --> 00:11:53,022
Your eyes are all puffy.

181
00:11:53,652 --> 00:11:54,922
Were you crying?

182
00:11:55,662 --> 00:11:57,322
Are you still that sad?

183
00:11:57,992 --> 00:12:00,592
Ji Wan, hurry up with the ramyeon. I need my broth.

184
00:12:09,002 --> 00:12:10,242
So how does it feel?

185
00:12:11,002 --> 00:12:13,342
You finally got Ji Hyuk to admit he was wrong.

186
00:12:13,912 --> 00:12:16,242
He formally apologized. How do you feel now?

187
00:12:17,312 --> 00:12:20,712
What do you mean, "finally?" It was the least he could do.

188
00:12:21,152 --> 00:12:22,322
Exactly.

189
00:12:22,722 --> 00:12:24,582
Whether it was "finally" or "the least he could do,"

190
00:12:25,022 --> 00:12:27,022
Ji Hyuk got on his knees and apologized.

191
00:12:28,562 --> 00:12:30,792
It felt like a huge weight was lifted off my chest.

192
00:12:32,832 --> 00:12:33,832
I bet.

193
00:12:34,262 --> 00:12:36,532
Nothing hurts more than being wounded by your own child.

194
00:12:37,402 --> 00:12:40,732
And the thing is, they're completely oblivious to it.

195
00:12:41,942 --> 00:12:45,512
How can they know how parents feel? They're too busy trying to get by.

196
00:12:47,172 --> 00:12:48,172
By the way, honey,

197
00:12:48,582 --> 00:12:51,312
they call our generation the "Last-First Generation."

198
00:12:52,212 --> 00:12:53,212
What?

199
00:12:54,152 --> 00:12:56,652
We're the last generation to take care of our parents...

200
00:12:57,052 --> 00:13:01,192
and the first kids won't support. Hence, the "Last-First Generation."

201
00:13:02,222 --> 00:13:04,092
That's not wrong,

202
00:13:05,092 --> 00:13:06,732
but thinking about it makes me kind of sad.

203
00:13:12,172 --> 00:13:14,932
I feel so relieved now that I've admitted I was wrong.

204
00:13:19,172 --> 00:13:20,842
I should go have a beer with Dad.

205
00:13:25,412 --> 00:13:26,412
What?

206
00:13:28,822 --> 00:13:29,882
Is that Seong Jae's car?

207
00:13:31,222 --> 00:13:32,522
He might as well just be my parents' son.

208
00:13:33,552 --> 00:13:34,552
Wait.

209
00:13:34,852 --> 00:13:36,222
Wait, that's not the way to our house.

210
00:13:40,262 --> 00:13:42,762
Park Seong Jae! What do you think you're doing?

211
00:13:45,372 --> 00:13:46,532
What is he talking about?

212
00:13:59,682 --> 00:14:01,782
Seong Jae, why did you speed like that?

213
00:14:02,422 --> 00:14:04,482
Ji Hyuk sent me a strange text.

214
00:14:05,082 --> 00:14:06,952
I guess I panicked for nothing.

215
00:14:08,092 --> 00:14:09,222
Ji Hyuk did?

216
00:14:10,362 --> 00:14:11,462
What did it say?

217
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:14,192
Was Ji Hyuk home when you left?

218
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:15,562
Yes.

219
00:14:16,532 --> 00:14:21,072
Hey, do you know what happened with Dad and Ji Hyuk today?

220
00:14:21,172 --> 00:14:24,902
Man, what on earth could this mean?

221
00:14:26,342 --> 00:14:27,342
Seong Jae?

222
00:14:29,982 --> 00:14:30,982
Yes.

223
00:14:31,342 --> 00:14:33,112
Look at me when you talk to me.

224
00:14:33,852 --> 00:14:35,352
Sorry.

225
00:14:42,492 --> 00:14:44,362
- Ji Hyuk? - Hey, Ji Hyuk.

226
00:14:50,902 --> 00:14:51,902
Both of you, get out.

227
00:15:05,912 --> 00:15:06,912
Park Seong Jae.

228
00:15:07,682 --> 00:15:08,882
What do you think you're doing?

229
00:15:09,582 --> 00:15:12,722
- Ji Hyuk, I liked him first. - Ji Hyuk...

230
00:15:12,792 --> 00:15:13,792
Lee Su Bin.

231
00:15:14,492 --> 00:15:16,622
- Go home. - I liked him first,

232
00:15:16,622 --> 00:15:18,092
and I confessed my feelings first.

233
00:15:18,162 --> 00:15:20,732
Seong Jae kept saying no and that it was a bad idea,

234
00:15:20,992 --> 00:15:23,932
but I insisted we date. Seong Jae didn't do anything wrong.

235
00:15:23,932 --> 00:15:25,232
I said get in the house!

236
00:15:26,702 --> 00:15:28,172
Don't yell at Su Bin.

237
00:15:28,772 --> 00:15:29,772
Take it out on me.

238
00:15:30,302 --> 00:15:32,272
Don't act like you're to blame. You didn't do anything wrong.

239
00:15:34,012 --> 00:15:35,342
I can't believe these two.

240
00:15:35,482 --> 00:15:37,182
I'll take Su Bin home. We can talk after.

241
00:15:37,512 --> 00:15:38,582
It's a one-minute run from here.

242
00:15:40,312 --> 00:15:41,312
Su Bin.

243
00:15:42,452 --> 00:15:44,052
- Go. - Ji Hyuk.

244
00:15:44,122 --> 00:15:45,122
Are you going or not?

245
00:15:47,892 --> 00:15:48,892
Fine.

246
00:15:51,762 --> 00:15:53,762
Seong Jae, I'll go by myself.

247
00:15:54,292 --> 00:15:55,832
Call me if anything happens.

248
00:16:07,442 --> 00:16:08,442
Seong Jae.

249
00:16:09,442 --> 00:16:10,482
You...

250
00:16:11,212 --> 00:16:13,912
What do you think you're doing with my sister?

251
00:16:15,082 --> 00:16:17,422
How could you? With Su Bin...

252
00:16:18,152 --> 00:16:19,392
Seriously, how long has this been going on?

253
00:16:20,222 --> 00:16:22,622
You were into Eun Oh until recently, right?

254
00:16:23,622 --> 00:16:28,232
You were into Eun Oh for years, so why are you with my sister?

255
00:16:28,592 --> 00:16:30,232
It wasn't that I was in love with Eun Oh.

256
00:16:30,962 --> 00:16:33,002
I told you. I admired her.

257
00:16:34,102 --> 00:16:35,332
It was admiration.

258
00:16:36,772 --> 00:16:38,472
I thought, "I want to love someone like her."

259
00:16:38,912 --> 00:16:42,682
"I wish a girl like her were mine." Or maybe...

260
00:16:43,782 --> 00:16:46,482
Maybe I was just in love with the feeling...

261
00:16:47,512 --> 00:16:48,782
of being in love.

262
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:52,092
And you just told me that.

263
00:16:52,122 --> 00:16:56,322
You're the one who made me realize that I wasn't in love with Eun Oh.

264
00:16:57,692 --> 00:17:00,162
Seong Jae, you... You're not in love with Eun Oh.

265
00:17:00,432 --> 00:17:01,562
I can't hold back.

266
00:17:01,832 --> 00:17:05,262
I just can't bring myself to. I want to tell Eun Oh right now.

267
00:17:05,672 --> 00:17:06,832
Hearing you...

268
00:17:06,832 --> 00:17:09,202
and seeing the look in your eyes, I wondered, "Is that what love is?"

269
00:17:10,402 --> 00:17:12,342
And Su Bin made me understand what that is.

270
00:17:14,012 --> 00:17:17,012
Su Bin means that much to you?

271
00:17:17,342 --> 00:17:19,412
Did it take you a long time to fall for Ji Eun Oh?

272
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:22,482
Developing romantic feelings for her after ten years of friendship...

273
00:17:23,382 --> 00:17:25,952
Has it been a year since you fell so hard you couldn't hold back?

274
00:17:29,892 --> 00:17:33,292
Hearing you, I finally understood what that feeling was.

275
00:17:33,862 --> 00:17:35,332
And I'm telling you, it was because of Su Bin.

276
00:17:36,162 --> 00:17:37,832
That's how this happened with Su Bin.

277
00:17:40,002 --> 00:17:41,172
So please, Ji Hyuk.

278
00:17:43,602 --> 00:17:46,642
Can't you just cut me some slack this once?

279
00:17:46,712 --> 00:17:48,072
Cut you some slack? Are you kidding me?

280
00:17:49,482 --> 00:17:51,942
You're divorced, you jerk.

281
00:17:53,482 --> 00:17:54,582
And that's not all, is it?

282
00:17:55,622 --> 00:17:56,782
What about my parents?

283
00:17:56,852 --> 00:18:01,352
No, forget them. What about your own family?

284
00:18:04,192 --> 00:18:05,292
How could you do this to me...

285
00:18:06,332 --> 00:18:08,662
How could you do this to my parents?

286
00:18:08,662 --> 00:18:10,402
That's why I tried to stop myself.

287
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:12,602
I told you. I tried not to start anything.

288
00:18:13,332 --> 00:18:14,732
But I just couldn't help myself.

289
00:18:15,642 --> 00:18:16,772
You're the one who said it.

290
00:18:17,102 --> 00:18:19,212
That you couldn't hold back. That you just couldn't do it!

291
00:18:20,242 --> 00:18:21,242
You can.

292
00:18:21,872 --> 00:18:23,812
I'm holding back with Eun Oh, aren't I?

293
00:18:24,242 --> 00:18:25,482
That's just you bottling it up.

294
00:18:26,152 --> 00:18:28,312
- That's not holding back. - Then you bottle it up too.

295
00:18:32,352 --> 00:18:35,092
- So we can't even date? - No, you can't even "just date."

296
00:18:36,122 --> 00:18:37,292
Because you'll get attached.

297
00:18:38,422 --> 00:18:39,462
Ji Hyuk.

298
00:18:40,692 --> 00:18:44,432
We agreed to just try dating for 100 days.

299
00:18:45,302 --> 00:18:46,302
Hey.

300
00:18:47,172 --> 00:18:48,602
Su Bin's a lot younger than me, you know.

301
00:18:50,042 --> 00:18:51,772
A young, pretty girl like Su Bin...

302
00:18:52,572 --> 00:18:54,212
Why would she like a guy like me for a long time?

303
00:18:54,212 --> 00:18:55,782
It's just a passing crush.

304
00:18:56,682 --> 00:18:59,312
She might get tired of me and end it before we even hit 100 days.

305
00:19:00,152 --> 00:19:02,982
So please, just for 100 days.

306
00:19:05,082 --> 00:19:06,522
Just let it slide this once. Please?

307
00:19:06,752 --> 00:19:08,122
Don't give me that "100 days" nonsense.

308
00:19:08,962 --> 00:19:10,892
What if you're still together after 100 days?

309
00:19:11,592 --> 00:19:13,362
What if your feelings for each other grow even stronger?

310
00:19:14,562 --> 00:19:16,532
What, are you going to ask for a one-year extension?

311
00:19:17,132 --> 00:19:18,902
Or two years? Three?

312
00:19:21,172 --> 00:19:23,442
I know exactly what your family is like.

313
00:19:24,502 --> 00:19:25,872
I saw it all happen.

314
00:19:26,772 --> 00:19:28,672
The second you secretly married Yeo Jin,

315
00:19:29,142 --> 00:19:32,082
your father cut you off completely...

316
00:19:33,812 --> 00:19:36,722
and bribed your landlord to get you kicked out of your home.

317
00:19:36,782 --> 00:19:38,052
Things are different now.

318
00:19:38,722 --> 00:19:39,852
I'm in a different position now.

319
00:19:41,992 --> 00:19:44,992
I won't let Su Bin go through anything like that.

320
00:19:45,832 --> 00:19:48,632
- I'll get your parents' permission. - My parents?

321
00:19:49,762 --> 00:19:51,302
If you let my parents find out about this,

322
00:19:52,872 --> 00:19:53,972
you're a dead man.

323
00:19:57,742 --> 00:19:59,672
If you want to date Su Bin for even 100 days,

324
00:20:00,312 --> 00:20:01,742
you get your father's permission first.

325
00:20:02,412 --> 00:20:04,342
Even if you were just "talking,"

326
00:20:04,342 --> 00:20:06,582
you should've handled your father first.

327
00:20:08,252 --> 00:20:11,322
Especially since it's my little sister.

328
00:20:14,992 --> 00:20:15,992
You're right.

329
00:20:18,192 --> 00:20:19,662
I'm truly sorry about that, Ji Hyuk.

330
00:20:22,562 --> 00:20:23,762
Until you get his permission,

331
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,272
don't contact Su Bin.

332
00:20:29,842 --> 00:20:30,842
Ji Hyuk...

333
00:20:44,552 --> 00:20:45,552
How did it go?

334
00:20:46,192 --> 00:20:47,422
He didn't hit you, did he?

335
00:20:50,162 --> 00:20:51,192
Lee Su Bin.

336
00:20:58,762 --> 00:21:00,032
So you didn't hit him.

337
00:21:01,672 --> 00:21:03,302
You were worried I might've hit Seong Jae?

338
00:21:03,672 --> 00:21:05,172
Gosh, kid.

339
00:21:06,712 --> 00:21:09,112
I'm done talking with Seong Jae.

340
00:21:10,412 --> 00:21:12,952
Did Seong Jae say he'd break up with me?

341
00:21:13,812 --> 00:21:15,822
Do you think I'd be friends with a guy who'd do that?

342
00:21:16,252 --> 00:21:19,292
I knew it! There's no way he'd do that.

343
00:21:19,952 --> 00:21:21,592
You know him better than anyone.

344
00:21:22,592 --> 00:21:25,932
You know what a great person Seong Jae is.

345
00:21:26,692 --> 00:21:29,162
How on earth did you end up liking Seong Jae?

346
00:21:29,432 --> 00:21:31,632
Did it happen while filming YouTube?

347
00:21:31,632 --> 00:21:34,032
Or because he's a rich heir?

348
00:21:34,172 --> 00:21:36,802
Of course not. I'm not like you!

349
00:21:37,772 --> 00:21:38,772
What?

350
00:21:38,842 --> 00:21:40,312
No matter how rich he is,

351
00:21:40,312 --> 00:21:42,212
do you really think I would go for a divorced guy?

352
00:21:42,882 --> 00:21:44,212
Especially with Mom and Dad to consider.

353
00:21:45,642 --> 00:21:49,252
But it got to the point where his divorce didn't matter.

354
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:51,682
That's how much I fell for Seong Jae.

355
00:21:52,722 --> 00:21:53,752
Su Bin.

356
00:21:55,992 --> 00:21:57,122
It's not just about the divorce.

357
00:21:58,222 --> 00:21:59,862
What do you mean, it's not just about the divorce?

358
00:22:00,492 --> 00:22:01,962
There's a whole world you don't know about.

359
00:22:02,732 --> 00:22:05,432
So, until Seong Jae sorts this out and I give you my permission,

360
00:22:05,902 --> 00:22:07,502
don't contact Seong Jae for the time being.

361
00:22:08,072 --> 00:22:09,242
This is a warning from your older brother.

362
00:22:10,902 --> 00:22:14,672
Let's not break Mom and Dad's hearts after they just lost Grandma.

363
00:22:15,742 --> 00:22:20,682
- But we just want to date. - Enough. Don't see him for a while.

364
00:22:21,312 --> 00:22:22,312
Got it?

365
00:22:26,892 --> 00:22:28,492
Seong Jae won't be contacting you for a while either.

366
00:22:29,462 --> 00:22:31,862
Don't take this as a joke.

367
00:22:38,902 --> 00:22:41,632
A joke? I'm terrified right now.

368
00:22:42,542 --> 00:22:44,402
What is going on that's making him act like this?

369
00:22:50,642 --> 00:22:52,512
If you want to date Su Bin for even 100 days,

370
00:22:53,782 --> 00:22:55,382
you get your father's permission first.

371
00:23:02,022 --> 00:23:03,192
Ji Hyuk...

372
00:23:04,562 --> 00:23:06,792
knows my own father's a lost cause.

373
00:23:07,662 --> 00:23:11,062
Melt plenty of butter in a pan and add milk so it doesn't burn.

374
00:23:11,532 --> 00:23:13,672
Flip the slices of bread back and forth,

375
00:23:14,032 --> 00:23:15,632
and let it soak up the melted butter.

376
00:23:16,202 --> 00:23:18,502
Wait, is that butter I smell? What are you doing?

377
00:23:19,002 --> 00:23:20,312
I'm making French toast.

378
00:23:20,842 --> 00:23:22,312
Why are you making this?

379
00:23:22,812 --> 00:23:24,942
If you wanted some, you should've just asked me.

380
00:23:25,512 --> 00:23:29,452
From now on, no more big breakfasts with rice, soup, and side dishes.

381
00:23:29,522 --> 00:23:32,352
Let's just eat something simple. It doesn't have to be Korean food.

382
00:23:32,892 --> 00:23:35,792
Right, but even so, why are you the one making it?

383
00:23:36,522 --> 00:23:37,622
Where did you get the ingredients?

384
00:23:37,762 --> 00:23:40,932
I woke up early and went to a convenience store to get them.

385
00:23:41,792 --> 00:23:44,362
And from now on, on the days I don't have my part-time job,

386
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:46,102
I'll make breakfast. Okay?

387
00:23:47,772 --> 00:23:50,602
- What's that smell? - Ji Hyuk.

388
00:23:50,902 --> 00:23:52,512
Your father's making breakfast.

389
00:23:53,412 --> 00:23:56,442
Is he? What's so weird about that?

390
00:23:56,712 --> 00:23:58,942
There are no gender roles for chores anymore.

391
00:23:59,452 --> 00:24:00,652
Gosh, son.

392
00:24:00,912 --> 00:24:04,822
Can't you just say something like, "Dad, you're amazing?"

393
00:24:05,482 --> 00:24:07,452
Dad, you're amazing.

394
00:24:08,022 --> 00:24:09,862
You bet I am. You brat.

395
00:24:10,422 --> 00:24:11,892
- This looks good. - Yes.

396
00:24:13,762 --> 00:24:18,932
I was planning to go with you if it was just for your checkup,

397
00:24:19,002 --> 00:24:21,602
but your friends are visiting Woo Jin too.

398
00:24:22,602 --> 00:24:25,272
Even if they weren't, I could totally go alone.

399
00:24:25,642 --> 00:24:27,572
I'm well enough to go to work, you know.

400
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:32,312
So today's the day you tell them about you and Woo Jin, right?

401
00:24:32,912 --> 00:24:37,252
Yeong In, Gyeong Hui, and Min Seong are going to flip out.

402
00:24:37,722 --> 00:24:39,222
Of course, I have to tell them.

403
00:24:39,952 --> 00:24:41,952
They're Woo Jin's only friends.

404
00:24:43,262 --> 00:24:46,632
Just thinking about it makes my heart race.

405
00:24:47,492 --> 00:24:48,962
I'll tell you all about it tonight, Mom.

406
00:24:49,502 --> 00:24:51,632
- I'm heading out. - Okay. Don't push yourself.

407
00:24:51,632 --> 00:24:52,702
I won't.

408
00:25:09,622 --> 00:25:11,222
Woo Jin's friends are here.

409
00:25:11,952 --> 00:25:15,962
Hello. Woo Jin, I'll come back later.

410
00:25:23,302 --> 00:25:24,602
Woo Jin, it's okay.

411
00:25:25,102 --> 00:25:26,302
Don't worry, Han Woo Jin.

412
00:25:31,342 --> 00:25:32,872
What's with those looks?

413
00:25:33,542 --> 00:25:35,542
Woo Jin must've told them everything.

414
00:25:35,842 --> 00:25:37,442
That clueless fool.

415
00:25:38,342 --> 00:25:41,382
Woo Jin and Eun Oh. Those two are trouble.

416
00:25:44,422 --> 00:25:45,922
We're heading out. Take care of yourself.

417
00:25:46,022 --> 00:25:48,952
- Good luck. Rest up. We're off. - I'll be in touch.

418
00:25:49,092 --> 00:25:50,722
- Thanks for coming. - Bye!

419
00:25:53,632 --> 00:25:57,102
Woo Jin. Let's go to the exam room. You can walk, right?

420
00:26:05,672 --> 00:26:06,742
I'm going to get my tests done.

421
00:26:07,872 --> 00:26:11,412
There's a caregiver waiting outside. Go with her for your tests.

422
00:26:12,712 --> 00:26:14,312
You and I need to talk.

423
00:26:15,712 --> 00:26:18,452
- Mom. - Woo Jin. Do your tests first.

424
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:20,422
We'll talk later.

425
00:26:33,002 --> 00:26:36,242
You're not going to like this, but this is how I do things.

426
00:26:37,072 --> 00:26:39,342
How else am I supposed to thank you, if not with money?

427
00:26:40,242 --> 00:26:43,712
That's how life works. You get something, you pay for it.

428
00:26:47,682 --> 00:26:48,682
I understand.

429
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,292
(Cashier's Check: One Million Dollars)

430
00:26:54,652 --> 00:26:55,692
It's one million dollars.

431
00:26:59,592 --> 00:27:00,792
Leave Woo Jin alone.

432
00:27:04,062 --> 00:27:06,002
You've grown up to have a backbone.

433
00:27:06,832 --> 00:27:08,472
But Woo Jin is fragile.

434
00:27:09,172 --> 00:27:12,572
This kind of chaos isn't good for him right now.

435
00:27:12,742 --> 00:27:14,872
That his sister was his friend?

436
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,112
Or that his friend turned out to be his sister?

437
00:27:18,282 --> 00:27:19,382
Both.

438
00:27:20,352 --> 00:27:23,822
And that more and more people are finding out about your story.

439
00:27:28,322 --> 00:27:29,622
For Woo Jin's sake,

440
00:27:31,022 --> 00:27:32,262
cut off all contact with him.

441
00:27:33,632 --> 00:27:34,862
Is that a request?

442
00:27:36,462 --> 00:27:37,532
You're not saying...

443
00:27:37,532 --> 00:27:39,832
that was in the deal for just a million, are you?

444
00:27:51,042 --> 00:27:52,242
Says the one who took the money.

445
00:27:56,122 --> 00:27:58,452
(Reception, Patient Services)

446
00:28:07,592 --> 00:28:09,762
Go take a 15-minute coffee break.

447
00:28:17,872 --> 00:28:19,912
I've settled things with Eun Oh.

448
00:28:22,342 --> 00:28:25,582
- "Settled things?" - I thanked her for the transplant.

449
00:28:27,212 --> 00:28:28,352
How?

450
00:28:29,352 --> 00:28:32,922
- What did you say to her? - What do you think? With money.

451
00:28:33,452 --> 00:28:35,322
I offered her a million dollars, and she just snatched it up.

452
00:28:39,632 --> 00:28:40,662
Really?

453
00:28:41,092 --> 00:28:44,262
- Did Eun Oh really take the money? - Why?

454
00:28:44,532 --> 00:28:46,302
Did you think she was above taking it?

455
00:28:49,902 --> 00:28:53,912
So, don't feel burdened by Eun Oh anymore. We paid her.

456
00:28:55,342 --> 00:28:58,242
Instead, focus on recovering quickly and going back to the US.

457
00:28:58,942 --> 00:29:01,912
Finish your last semester strong and keep your grades up.

458
00:29:03,822 --> 00:29:06,822
For some reason, Seong Jae isn't the same person he used to be.

459
00:29:07,522 --> 00:29:10,862
Chairman Park promoted Seong Jae to Vice President.

460
00:29:12,092 --> 00:29:14,592
He's not the mess he used to be.

461
00:29:17,962 --> 00:29:20,632
So, you need to get your act together.

462
00:29:23,872 --> 00:29:25,242
Don't forget...

463
00:29:25,242 --> 00:29:27,912
the lengths I went to in order to save you.

464
00:29:28,312 --> 00:29:29,312
Got it?

465
00:29:45,522 --> 00:29:46,762
Hey, why are you on your laptop?

466
00:29:47,562 --> 00:29:49,292
Aren't you supposed to be studying for your certification?

467
00:29:49,632 --> 00:29:52,602
No. This is something else. A side hustle.

468
00:29:54,572 --> 00:29:55,572
What kind of side hustle?

469
00:29:56,542 --> 00:30:00,412
I was looking up your webtoon, and I found a webtoon story contest.

470
00:30:00,512 --> 00:30:03,782
It's a contest for story pitches, and the prize is 10,000 dollars.

471
00:30:04,682 --> 00:30:06,482
So you're writing a story for it?

472
00:30:06,482 --> 00:30:09,622
Yes. I actually had a story in mind,

473
00:30:09,782 --> 00:30:10,782
so I thought I'd give it a shot.

474
00:30:13,292 --> 00:30:14,292
What's it about?

475
00:30:14,552 --> 00:30:16,262
Hey, that's a secret.

476
00:30:17,192 --> 00:30:20,632
I could help you, you know. Since you helped me.

477
00:30:21,632 --> 00:30:22,632
Really?

478
00:30:23,702 --> 00:30:25,362
You know the story of Rapunzel, right?

479
00:30:26,332 --> 00:30:28,202
You mean Rapunzel, locked away in her tower?

480
00:30:28,272 --> 00:30:32,202
Yes. This is a modern-day version of Rapunzel.

481
00:30:32,472 --> 00:30:35,472
There's this girl. At first,

482
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:38,942
she's so clueless about the world that you'd think she's a brat.

483
00:30:39,342 --> 00:30:42,552
She can't make her own decisions, and she's a total coward.

484
00:30:42,982 --> 00:30:47,192
But deep down inside, she has this fiery...

485
00:30:47,252 --> 00:30:48,592
spark in her.

486
00:30:49,762 --> 00:30:53,032
So why was she living like such a spoiled, clueless brat?

487
00:30:54,092 --> 00:30:56,332
Because there was a witch who raised her to be that way.

488
00:30:57,162 --> 00:30:58,962
So it really is a modern-day Rapunzel.

489
00:30:59,402 --> 00:31:03,202
- And then what? - Then, she meets a bodyguard.

490
00:31:03,372 --> 00:31:07,242
The bodyguard plays the role of Rapunzel's long hair.

491
00:31:07,612 --> 00:31:10,612
Anyway, it's about her trying to escape.

492
00:31:11,742 --> 00:31:12,812
A bodyguard?

493
00:31:14,812 --> 00:31:15,812
Wait.

494
00:31:16,522 --> 00:31:17,822
Isn't this about me?

495
00:31:18,322 --> 00:31:19,592
This sounds like my mom and me.

496
00:31:20,492 --> 00:31:21,492
You think so?

497
00:31:21,792 --> 00:31:26,392
But in the story, the two of them escape the mansion in the woods,

498
00:31:26,462 --> 00:31:30,062
and they make it out of the forest, despite all the obstacles. See?

499
00:31:30,062 --> 00:31:31,162
That's different from your story, right?

500
00:31:33,202 --> 00:31:34,202
That sounds interesting.

501
00:31:35,302 --> 00:31:38,102
You inspired it, so if it wins, I'll give you half,

502
00:31:38,172 --> 00:31:39,172
which is 5,000 dollars.

503
00:31:41,012 --> 00:31:43,012
I bet I could do a great job illustrating it.

504
00:31:43,412 --> 00:31:46,612
Go ahead and work on it. I'm going to step out for one hour.

505
00:31:51,582 --> 00:31:53,192
(Resignation Letter)

506
00:31:53,652 --> 00:31:54,992
This is my letter of resignation.

507
00:31:55,952 --> 00:31:57,262
A resignation letter?

508
00:31:58,192 --> 00:32:00,232
The stalker Yang Ji Il's first trial verdict...

509
00:32:00,232 --> 00:32:02,492
is in mid-January.

510
00:32:03,632 --> 00:32:06,472
Once the verdict is delivered and he's in custody,

511
00:32:06,672 --> 00:32:08,632
your daughter won't need a bodyguard anymore.

512
00:32:11,542 --> 00:32:15,772
I offered you the job of running our employee fitness center.

513
00:32:17,082 --> 00:32:19,782
I wouldn't want to impose.

514
00:32:20,252 --> 00:32:21,252
Impose?

515
00:32:21,582 --> 00:32:23,352
It's a position we need to fill for the company.

516
00:32:25,922 --> 00:32:26,922
Is that so?

517
00:32:27,752 --> 00:32:29,022
The thing is,

518
00:32:29,352 --> 00:32:31,622
I'm planning to join a security firm.

519
00:32:32,562 --> 00:32:36,192
Working as a bodyguard, I realized that protecting people...

520
00:32:36,362 --> 00:32:38,602
is a really good fit for me.

521
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:40,472
A security firm?

522
00:32:41,002 --> 00:32:44,402
That's why I'm studying for my official certification.

523
00:32:56,982 --> 00:32:58,122
Grandma.

524
00:33:00,092 --> 00:33:02,592
I still haven't heard from Seong Jae at all.

525
00:33:04,522 --> 00:33:07,062
You always liked Seong Jae.

526
00:33:08,732 --> 00:33:12,762
If you were here, I know you would've helped me.

527
00:33:17,342 --> 00:33:18,902
I miss you so much.

528
00:33:32,382 --> 00:33:34,852
Have them redo the graph for refunds and exchange fluctuations.

529
00:33:34,922 --> 00:33:37,222
And separate the data for domestic and international stores.

530
00:33:37,292 --> 00:33:38,562
Yes, sir.

531
00:33:45,262 --> 00:33:47,432
If you want to date Su Bin for even 100 days,

532
00:33:47,932 --> 00:33:49,502
you get your father's permission first.

533
00:34:00,252 --> 00:34:01,252
Grandma...

534
00:34:10,692 --> 00:34:11,862
My father's permission?

535
00:34:21,232 --> 00:34:23,642
So please, Ji Hyuk.

536
00:34:23,842 --> 00:34:25,502
Can't you just cut me some slack this once?

537
00:34:27,012 --> 00:34:28,112
This is driving me crazy.

538
00:34:29,212 --> 00:34:31,842
I need to make them break up before Mom and Dad find out.

539
00:34:34,482 --> 00:34:35,482
Yes.

540
00:34:35,552 --> 00:34:39,382
(Apfel Kitchen)

541
00:34:40,452 --> 00:34:41,922
Here is your off-site schedule for next week.

542
00:34:42,592 --> 00:34:44,222
You'll tour Factory One...

543
00:34:44,222 --> 00:34:46,292
and meet the general managers of each showroom.

544
00:34:46,932 --> 00:34:48,332
Here's the requested data...

545
00:34:48,332 --> 00:34:51,732
on B2B and B2C sales changes by material.

546
00:34:53,432 --> 00:34:54,502
Cheol Min?

547
00:34:55,132 --> 00:34:56,742
"Do it! Don't do it!"

548
00:34:57,272 --> 00:34:59,372
Let's say phrases like that are off-limits.

549
00:34:59,702 --> 00:35:02,912
On a scale of strong, medium, and weak,

550
00:35:02,912 --> 00:35:05,182
at what point do you think it could be stopped?

551
00:35:05,442 --> 00:35:08,412
- What's your gut feeling on that? - "Do it."

552
00:35:09,282 --> 00:35:11,222
"Don't do it."

553
00:35:11,222 --> 00:35:12,922
Is it within your rights to say that?

554
00:35:18,492 --> 00:35:21,392
I can't give you a proper read on it without knowing that, Mr. Lee.

555
00:35:25,432 --> 00:35:27,302
The right to say that?

556
00:35:29,232 --> 00:35:30,372
I think I have that right.

557
00:35:32,002 --> 00:35:33,002
Don't I?

558
00:35:39,212 --> 00:35:42,982
- His resignation letter? - Yes. He came by the office today.

559
00:35:43,482 --> 00:35:45,852
He'll only work until Yang Ji Il's initial verdict is out.

560
00:35:46,452 --> 00:35:47,792
Since it's a sure thing he'll be locked up.

561
00:35:48,392 --> 00:35:50,022
So he really submitted his resignation?

562
00:35:50,922 --> 00:35:53,962
- And you accepted it? - I did.

563
00:35:54,432 --> 00:35:57,462
I even offered him the job at our employee fitness center,

564
00:35:57,762 --> 00:35:58,762
but he turned that down too.

565
00:35:59,302 --> 00:36:00,672
He says he wants to join a security firm.

566
00:36:01,302 --> 00:36:02,732
Apparently, he enjoyed being a bodyguard.

567
00:36:03,972 --> 00:36:05,402
That can't be right.

568
00:36:07,172 --> 00:36:10,642
He was very clear and firm about resigning before he left.

569
00:36:11,342 --> 00:36:13,312
There's no need for you to get all worked up about it.

570
00:36:21,992 --> 00:36:23,192
Just give me two months.

571
00:36:24,622 --> 00:36:27,462
It's just that I really want to see this through to the end.

572
00:36:28,192 --> 00:36:30,932
Just let me do this one thing, and I'll do whatever you want.

573
00:36:31,962 --> 00:36:33,572
Was it really just about the webtoon?

574
00:36:35,672 --> 00:36:38,102
She wouldn't dare try to fool Chairman Park.

575
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:08,172
Hey. What are you doing here?

576
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:10,442
It's way too early for you to be at the office.

577
00:37:11,142 --> 00:37:12,142
Hey, what's with you?

578
00:37:13,002 --> 00:37:16,172
Do you just barge into my office whenever I'm not here?

579
00:37:17,042 --> 00:37:18,242
What, me?

580
00:37:18,982 --> 00:37:21,652
No, I just came in because I had to do something before you got here.

581
00:37:22,682 --> 00:37:24,952
This is a welcome-back-to-work gift.

582
00:37:25,322 --> 00:37:27,322
And these are some snacks.

583
00:37:27,992 --> 00:37:28,992
And this is...

584
00:37:31,022 --> 00:37:32,022
an air purifier.

585
00:37:32,562 --> 00:37:34,062
Since it's hard to get fresh air in the winter.

586
00:37:36,762 --> 00:37:39,302
This is a lot for a company perk, isn't it?

587
00:37:40,472 --> 00:37:41,472
It's not a company perk.

588
00:37:41,872 --> 00:37:43,602
I bought all of this with my own money.

589
00:37:44,342 --> 00:37:45,742
With some ulterior motives, of course.

590
00:37:49,712 --> 00:37:53,712
And one more thing. Can you please not come in so early?

591
00:37:56,312 --> 00:37:58,422
(Apel Kitchen)

592
00:38:00,352 --> 00:38:02,692
That guy's so shameless and slick.

593
00:38:35,692 --> 00:38:37,662
Ms. Ji, the CEO would like to see you in his office.

594
00:38:37,892 --> 00:38:40,832
(Apfel Kitchen)

595
00:38:45,802 --> 00:38:46,802
Why are you standing?

596
00:38:47,832 --> 00:38:50,872
You've been sitting since 7am.

597
00:38:51,342 --> 00:38:54,772
So, what's more comfortable for you? Standing or sitting?

598
00:38:55,142 --> 00:38:56,242
I have something to discuss.

599
00:38:56,942 --> 00:38:58,842
You're okay with having a meeting while standing?

600
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:02,312
Call it a tailor-made service for my partner.

601
00:39:04,252 --> 00:39:05,782
I'll stand, then.

602
00:39:06,322 --> 00:39:07,322
Go ahead.

603
00:39:07,792 --> 00:39:08,792
The thing is...

604
00:39:09,122 --> 00:39:12,022
I was hoping you would take on the model home project.

605
00:39:13,732 --> 00:39:16,392
So you're asking me to join AP?

606
00:39:16,962 --> 00:39:19,002
AP isn't really structured for partnerships.

607
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:20,772
What if I say no?

608
00:39:21,602 --> 00:39:22,602
Then...

609
00:39:22,932 --> 00:39:24,802
I guess you'd have to go independent with Eunoism.

610
00:39:25,442 --> 00:39:28,572
But I feel that instead of running around job sites,

611
00:39:28,642 --> 00:39:31,442
your real talent lies in design.

612
00:39:32,382 --> 00:39:33,382
That's why...

613
00:39:35,082 --> 00:39:37,322
I want you to be AP's Head of Design.

614
00:39:37,852 --> 00:39:38,852
I really hope you will.

615
00:39:41,692 --> 00:39:42,752
I'll think about it.

616
00:39:43,322 --> 00:39:44,322
Okay.

617
00:39:52,902 --> 00:39:54,232
What if she says she wants to go independent?

618
00:40:04,712 --> 00:40:05,712
Sang Cheol.

619
00:40:06,982 --> 00:40:08,012
Don't...

620
00:40:08,912 --> 00:40:10,752
run yourself ragged like this.

621
00:40:12,282 --> 00:40:13,722
For 33 years,

622
00:40:14,722 --> 00:40:16,122
you've been the man of the house.

623
00:40:17,762 --> 00:40:19,962
But I can't just let it all go.

624
00:40:21,232 --> 00:40:24,702
If I live to be your age, Mom, I've still got another 25 years.

625
00:40:26,002 --> 00:40:27,002
Mom.

626
00:40:27,732 --> 00:40:31,042
Am I ever going to get a job as a technician at this rate?

627
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:33,472
What am I going to do then?

628
00:40:35,612 --> 00:40:37,012
What do you mean, "What am I going to do?"

629
00:40:37,712 --> 00:40:39,712
You just have to keep at it, you fool. Man up.

630
00:40:41,552 --> 00:40:43,882
Oh! The Spring.

631
00:40:44,482 --> 00:40:46,822
Wait, until I get a job, I could follow her around...

632
00:40:47,122 --> 00:40:48,692
and learn a thing or two about interior design.

633
00:40:49,752 --> 00:40:53,092
It has been a while since I last contacted her.

634
00:40:55,462 --> 00:40:56,592
Gosh, that scared me. What is this?

635
00:40:57,002 --> 00:40:59,002
Mr. Early, how have you been?

636
00:41:00,272 --> 00:41:01,872
What a surprise.

637
00:41:02,202 --> 00:41:03,402
(The Spring)

638
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:05,102
I know it's been a while, hasn't it?

639
00:41:05,472 --> 00:41:07,342
I've been going through some wild stuff.

640
00:41:07,912 --> 00:41:11,482
I even had major surgery. Curious?

641
00:41:11,942 --> 00:41:13,012
Can you spare some time for me?

642
00:41:13,482 --> 00:41:16,182
I need to vent, and I need some advice.

643
00:41:16,282 --> 00:41:19,282
Man, how are we always so in sync?

644
00:41:19,922 --> 00:41:21,422
And she's so young... My gosh.

646
00:41:25,562 --> 00:41:27,592
Just as you predicted, he's been seeing a woman.

647
00:41:27,992 --> 00:41:30,432
Since we were short on time, I only looked into the key details.

648
00:41:38,542 --> 00:41:39,872
(Personal Information: Lee Su Bin, Age 24)

649
00:41:41,142 --> 00:41:42,742
(YouTuber)

650
00:41:42,942 --> 00:41:45,842
A 24-year-old YouTuber?

651
00:41:48,082 --> 00:41:50,052
She's probably just full of herself.

652
00:41:53,122 --> 00:41:54,992
So, a pretty young thing...

653
00:41:55,692 --> 00:41:57,792
latched onto a divorced guy for his money.

654
00:42:04,832 --> 00:42:06,262
Well, Seong Jae.

655
00:42:07,632 --> 00:42:10,202
You're doing a great job getting on your father's bad side yourself.

656
00:42:26,222 --> 00:42:27,292
Did you lock the door?

657
00:42:28,192 --> 00:42:30,592
Get out. Now. Before I have you thrown out.

658
00:42:32,162 --> 00:42:33,932
That guy is her brother?

659
00:42:38,832 --> 00:42:40,132
That's right. The CEO.

660
00:42:42,532 --> 00:42:44,272
The one who knows everything about me and Ji Eun Oh?

661
00:42:47,842 --> 00:42:48,972
He's her brother?

662
00:42:51,242 --> 00:42:52,942
And Seong Jae is dating that little brat?

663
00:43:01,792 --> 00:43:02,792

Father.

666
00:43:08,132 --> 00:43:09,132
I...

667
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:11,362
There's someone I care about.

668
00:43:12,332 --> 00:43:14,832
And I'm dating her.

669
00:43:15,632 --> 00:43:16,632
What?

670
00:43:18,472 --> 00:43:19,772
For now, we're just dating.

671
00:43:21,512 --> 00:43:22,512
"For now?"

672
00:43:23,442 --> 00:43:24,442
"Just dating?"

673
00:43:26,382 --> 00:43:28,882
So you're telling me to stop setting you up on dates?

674
00:43:30,452 --> 00:43:31,452
Yes.

675
00:43:32,282 --> 00:43:33,822
This time, please just let me be.

676
00:43:34,722 --> 00:43:35,722
I'm asking you, please.

677
00:43:38,722 --> 00:43:41,132
It sounds like this isn't just a casual relationship.

678
00:43:42,992 --> 00:43:46,102
What does she do? And her family? I don't even have to ask, do I?

679
00:43:46,602 --> 00:43:49,802
All that talk about just dating and so on.

680
00:43:49,802 --> 00:43:50,872
It's a smokescreen for her family, right?

681
00:43:51,502 --> 00:43:53,812
No. I'm telling you we're dating...

682
00:43:54,712 --> 00:43:56,372
because that's exactly what we're doing.

683
00:43:56,642 --> 00:43:59,112
I'm telling you this so you won't interfere.

684
00:44:00,552 --> 00:44:03,552
I have no intention of marrying the person you choose for me.

685
00:44:04,752 --> 00:44:07,122
Just like you married my stepmother for love,

686
00:44:07,892 --> 00:44:09,222
don't I have that right as well?

687
00:44:09,992 --> 00:44:12,862
So you're saying you intend to marry this girl?

688
00:44:13,832 --> 00:44:14,832
Who knows?

689
00:44:15,492 --> 00:44:16,492
Would she...

690
00:44:17,432 --> 00:44:19,332
even want to marry someone like me?

691
00:44:20,432 --> 00:44:22,532
- What? - I already told you.

We're just dating.

693
00:44:27,372 --> 00:44:29,442
I'm telling you this so you'll stay out of it.

694
00:44:30,342 --> 00:44:31,842
I'm asking you. Please.

695
00:44:33,642 --> 00:44:34,752
And if I refuse?

696
00:44:39,152 --> 00:44:42,222
Fine. Take a day to think about it and give me your answer.

697
00:44:43,122 --> 00:44:44,322
And I will give you my answer then as well.

699
00:44:54,802 --> 00:44:55,802
What's gotten into him?

700
00:45:05,582 --> 00:45:06,882
Did something happen?

701
00:45:07,852 --> 00:45:09,312
Seong Jae...

702
00:45:10,682 --> 00:45:11,882
says he's seeing someone.

703
00:45:12,422 --> 00:45:13,652
Out of the blue, he asked for my blessing.

704
00:45:14,292 --> 00:45:15,552
He told him already?

705
00:45:17,022 --> 00:45:18,362
Really?

706
00:45:19,692 --> 00:45:22,032
He should've told us if he was seeing someone.

707
00:45:22,532 --> 00:45:25,432
And I was pushing him to date, not knowing a thing.

708
00:45:26,062 --> 00:45:27,372
I need you to look into it.

709
00:45:28,072 --> 00:45:31,972
All this talk about "just dating" means she's not from a good family.

710
00:45:32,842 --> 00:45:36,542
But it's the first time he's brought up a woman himself,

711
00:45:36,542 --> 00:45:37,612
so it bothers me.

712
00:45:39,482 --> 00:45:41,652
- Okay. - Thanks.

713
00:45:54,632 --> 00:45:56,862
He told him to stay out of it because they're just dating?

714
00:45:58,032 --> 00:45:59,662
And he was the one who brought her up?

715
00:46:00,332 --> 00:46:02,932
Of all people, it had to be that jerk's sister.

716
00:46:03,672 --> 00:46:06,072
Get out. Now. Before I have you thrown out.

717
00:46:06,842 --> 00:46:09,872
If he learns I'm Seong Jae's mother, he'll tell Seong Jae immediately,

718
00:46:10,342 --> 00:46:12,412
and Seong Jae will go straight to Park Jin Seok.

719
00:46:13,282 --> 00:46:16,182
Then everything about Woo Jin will be exposed too.

720
00:46:16,752 --> 00:46:18,122
There's no way out of this.

721
00:46:34,432 --> 00:46:36,872
Why do I get the feeling she's looking at me?

722
00:46:42,412 --> 00:46:43,412
Me?

723
00:46:49,182 --> 00:46:51,082
I've never seen her before. Who is she?

724
00:46:54,892 --> 00:46:55,992
Hello, Su Bin.

725
00:46:57,152 --> 00:46:58,162
Who are you?

726
00:47:01,462 --> 00:47:02,592
I'm Seong Jae's mother.

727
00:47:10,332 --> 00:47:11,702
You're quite pretty.

728
00:47:13,002 --> 00:47:14,172
And so young.

729
00:47:14,712 --> 00:47:16,242
I suppose that's what men like about you.

730
00:47:20,912 --> 00:47:22,612
I assume you know why I'm here.

731
00:47:24,022 --> 00:47:25,222
I'm afraid I don't.

732
00:47:26,922 --> 00:47:29,322
My son, Seong Jae, is divorced,

733
00:47:29,592 --> 00:47:32,922
nine years older, and the eldest son of the Shoe Joy Group.

734
00:47:33,222 --> 00:47:37,132
And he has a duty to marry a woman who is suitable for our family.

735
00:47:38,032 --> 00:47:39,332
Are you aware of all this?

736
00:47:40,702 --> 00:47:43,772
I knew everything but the marriage part.

737
00:47:44,872 --> 00:47:46,772
That happens to be the most important part.

738
00:47:48,542 --> 00:47:50,272
The woman my Seong Jae marries...

739
00:47:50,712 --> 00:47:52,812
will be chosen by his father and me.

740
00:47:54,482 --> 00:47:56,052
And it's not going to be you.

741
00:47:58,382 --> 00:48:01,122
I've never said I was going to marry him.

742
00:48:02,392 --> 00:48:06,322
Really? Then why are you seeing him? At your pretty, young age.

743
00:48:06,692 --> 00:48:08,832
What, just for fun?

744
00:48:09,732 --> 00:48:13,362
At Seong Jae's age, am I to believe it's just casual dating?

745
00:48:14,332 --> 00:48:16,332
We haven't been seeing each other for very long.

746
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:18,042
We're just casually dating.

747
00:48:18,802 --> 00:48:22,842
So you'll just date for a while, and then break up?

748
00:48:23,272 --> 00:48:25,512
Well, in that case, I misunderstood.

749
00:48:26,042 --> 00:48:27,852
And here I was, worried that...

750
00:48:28,112 --> 00:48:30,482
this would make Seong Jae lose favor with the Chairman.

751
00:48:32,022 --> 00:48:34,452
Then would you like to sign an agreement?

752
00:48:35,152 --> 00:48:37,792
- An agreement? - What would be a good end date?

753
00:48:38,492 --> 00:48:40,832
Let's make it a clean break by the end of the year.

754
00:48:41,262 --> 00:48:43,162
We can even agree on a settlement amount.

755
00:48:44,202 --> 00:48:46,662
Oh, I should have picked a cafe.

756
00:48:49,002 --> 00:48:51,002
I won't be signing any agreement.

757
00:48:54,412 --> 00:48:56,812
- Why not? - Because there's no reason to.

758
00:48:58,242 --> 00:49:01,082
How long we date and whether we end up getting married...

759
00:49:01,982 --> 00:49:04,922
Isn't that for Seong Jae and me to decide first?

760
00:49:06,182 --> 00:49:07,452
I knew it.

761
00:49:08,492 --> 00:49:11,892
Hey, are you really with Seong Jae because you like him?

762
00:49:12,762 --> 00:49:15,192
It's not Seong Jae himself you want, is it?

763
00:49:15,532 --> 00:49:16,932
It's Seong Jae with money.

764
00:49:18,432 --> 00:49:21,432
But you can never have them both.

765
00:49:22,972 --> 00:49:25,342
Choose. Which will it be?

766
00:49:29,812 --> 00:49:30,812
Seong Jae.

767
00:49:32,482 --> 00:49:33,482
What did you say?

768
00:49:34,512 --> 00:49:36,182
For you to be this bold in front of his mother,

769
00:49:36,612 --> 00:49:38,422
you're quite a piece of work.

770
00:49:38,852 --> 00:49:40,552
You're the kind of girl who'll ruin my son!

771
00:49:41,392 --> 00:49:44,492
She would smile, but she was like thin ice.

772
00:49:45,192 --> 00:49:47,592
But you're not even Seong Jae's real mother.

773
00:49:50,192 --> 00:49:51,202
What?

774
00:49:55,532 --> 00:49:56,702
Why you little...

775
00:50:04,412 --> 00:50:08,152
My birth mother had an affair and left my dad when I was four.

776
00:50:09,512 --> 00:50:11,682
My current mother came into our lives when I was five.

777
00:50:12,982 --> 00:50:13,982
How should I put it?

778
00:50:16,052 --> 00:50:17,052
Not even for a single moment...

779
00:50:17,822 --> 00:50:19,562
was she ever a real mother to me.

780
00:50:23,992 --> 00:50:25,262
How could she be like that?

781
00:50:26,132 --> 00:50:28,172
She's raised you since you were five.

782
00:50:29,732 --> 00:50:30,842
Some people are just like that.

783
00:50:32,172 --> 00:50:34,142
That's why I'm so fond of your parents.

784
00:50:35,442 --> 00:50:36,442
I bet...

785
00:50:36,812 --> 00:50:39,682
I got more love from your mother than I ever did from mine.

786
00:50:43,482 --> 00:50:47,052
So, were you mistreated growing up?

787
00:50:49,252 --> 00:50:50,822
If she had at least mistreated me,

788
00:50:51,992 --> 00:50:53,592
my father would have noticed.

789
00:50:57,392 --> 00:50:58,402
She would smile,

790
00:50:59,432 --> 00:51:01,172
but she was like thin ice.

791
00:51:03,332 --> 00:51:05,872
Someone can smile and be like thin ice?

792
00:51:07,872 --> 00:51:08,872
Let go of me!

793
00:51:09,612 --> 00:51:12,712
My mom, my dad, my brothers,

794
00:51:14,312 --> 00:51:15,312
and my grandmother...

795
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:17,622
all love me dearly. I'm precious to them,

796
00:51:18,822 --> 00:51:20,152
so don't you dare treat me like this again.

797
00:51:25,162 --> 00:51:28,632
I raised him since he was five. So I'm not his real mother?

798
00:51:29,762 --> 00:51:31,102
I am Seong Jae's mother.

799
00:51:31,532 --> 00:51:35,102
- And I'm Chairman Park's wife! - If you were Seong Jae's mother,

800
00:51:35,802 --> 00:51:37,132
you wouldn't have laid a hand...

801
00:51:38,042 --> 00:51:39,802
on the woman your son loves.

802
00:51:41,112 --> 00:51:42,672
She's got quite a backbone.

803
00:51:44,312 --> 00:51:46,482
If you're finished, I'll be going now.

804
00:51:50,352 --> 00:51:51,822
Fine. Then listen to what I really have to say.

805
00:51:56,752 --> 00:51:57,762
Go ahead.

806
00:52:00,562 --> 00:52:01,692
Seong Jae's first marriage.

807
00:52:02,662 --> 00:52:04,502
Seong Jae's father forced him to get a divorce.

808
00:52:05,602 --> 00:52:06,862
Even though they were already legally married.

809
00:52:08,232 --> 00:52:11,142
For the heir of a conglomerate, marriage isn't a personal matter.

810
00:52:11,542 --> 00:52:13,872
It's a business arrangement with a family that aids the company.

811
00:52:21,652 --> 00:52:24,822
Seong Jae's father will never give up on him.

812
00:52:25,822 --> 00:52:30,322
I know. That's why I stepped in now, before you both get hurt even more.

813
00:52:31,192 --> 00:52:34,292
As his mother, it would be easier on my Seong Jae...

814
00:52:34,962 --> 00:52:37,032
if you were the one to end things.

815
00:52:37,762 --> 00:52:40,162
Do you understand me?

816
00:52:40,632 --> 00:52:42,432
I understand what you mean.

817
00:52:44,642 --> 00:52:46,142
Please, be realistic.

818
00:52:47,042 --> 00:52:50,842
Chairman Park will stop at nothing when it comes to Seong Jae.

819
00:52:52,212 --> 00:52:53,712
It won't just be you.

820
00:52:55,182 --> 00:52:57,082
Your family will be in danger, too.

821
00:53:03,692 --> 00:53:06,522
If you truly love Seong Jae, let him go.

822
00:53:08,062 --> 00:53:09,432
Because of your relationship with him,

823
00:53:09,862 --> 00:53:11,802
do you want him to be disowned by his family?

824
00:53:13,032 --> 00:53:15,672
Do you want Seong Jae to lose everything?

825
00:53:18,542 --> 00:53:19,942
Because true love means...

826
00:53:20,802 --> 00:53:22,712
wanting the other person to be happy.

00:56:29,492 --> 00:56:32,132
then it's over. Mark my words.

880
00:56:33,662 --> 00:56:34,702
Understood.

881
00:56:39,542 --> 00:56:41,472
I'm dying to see Su Bin.

882
00:56:52,552 --> 00:56:55,992
If I leave all this food out, he'll help himself, I'm sure.

883
00:56:56,652 --> 00:56:57,652
All set.

884
00:57:02,892 --> 00:57:03,892
Right.

885
00:57:06,132 --> 00:57:07,132
What?

886
00:57:09,602 --> 00:57:10,702
Cheol Min.

887
00:57:11,002 --> 00:57:13,242
Could you sort the meeting minutes for me?

888
00:57:13,842 --> 00:57:14,842
Sure.

889
00:57:28,392 --> 00:57:30,152
I was just about to head out. What's up?

890
00:57:32,022 --> 00:57:33,622
Can we talk for a minute?

891
00:57:36,392 --> 00:57:38,262
But I really have to get going right now.

892
00:57:38,562 --> 00:57:41,532
- I just came back to get my phone. - I make you uncomfortable, right?

893
00:57:43,332 --> 00:57:46,102
Showing up right after your surgery when you couldn't even move,

894
00:57:47,242 --> 00:57:48,772
hanging around your hospital room,

895
00:57:50,572 --> 00:57:52,342
telling you I can't give up on you,

896
00:57:53,812 --> 00:57:54,882
and now...

897
00:57:55,982 --> 00:57:57,482
asking you to join my company.

898
00:58:01,122 --> 00:58:04,192
Why are you saying all this all of a sudden?

899
00:58:04,722 --> 00:58:06,792
There's something I've been meaning to tell you,

900
00:58:08,432 --> 00:58:09,532
and I'm going to say it now.

901
00:58:14,162 --> 00:58:15,732
I've been a real jerk.

902
00:58:19,202 --> 00:58:20,372
Eun Oh, I...

903
00:58:21,672 --> 00:58:23,912
When I decided to marry Jung Bo A,

904
00:58:25,582 --> 00:58:28,052
I truly thought it was a win-win marriage.

905
00:58:30,182 --> 00:58:32,252
She had what I lacked,

906
00:58:33,652 --> 00:58:35,092
and she needed me.

907
00:58:37,152 --> 00:58:40,822
So I truly believed I wasn't doing anything wrong.

908
00:58:46,132 --> 00:58:47,802
I know that's what you thought.

909
00:58:49,202 --> 00:58:50,202
But...

910
00:58:50,732 --> 00:58:53,842
- why are you saying this now? - But I overlooked something.

911
00:58:56,172 --> 00:58:57,372
The fact that Jung Bo A was still...

912
00:58:58,942 --> 00:59:00,782
in love with another man.

913
00:59:04,212 --> 00:59:05,852
And even though I knew all that,

914
00:59:07,552 --> 00:59:09,022
I was still going to marry her.

915
00:59:11,522 --> 00:59:13,292
A real jerk who was just in it for the money.

916
00:59:14,962 --> 00:59:15,962
That was me.

917
00:59:20,562 --> 00:59:22,002
And you're only just now realizing that?

918
00:59:22,172 --> 00:59:24,232
So I can only imagine how much you must've despised me.

919
00:59:26,072 --> 00:59:27,972
And yet, I showed up at your cafe...

920
00:59:27,972 --> 00:59:30,242
trying to come back and bothering you.

921
00:59:32,742 --> 00:59:33,742
In the process...

922
00:59:36,212 --> 00:59:37,512
I ended up falling for you.

923
00:59:44,862 --> 00:59:45,922
As for that,

924
00:59:47,022 --> 00:59:49,262
I already gave you my answer back then.

925
00:59:50,832 --> 00:59:52,332
You're just pathetic.

926
00:59:52,832 --> 00:59:54,702
What's the point of you liking me now?

927
00:59:55,232 --> 00:59:58,172
It's all pointless now. That kind of person...

928
00:59:58,872 --> 00:59:59,902
I can't stand them.

929
00:59:59,902 --> 01:00:02,212
Someone who would marry without love for money...

930
01:00:02,272 --> 01:00:04,072
I despise people like that.

931
01:00:07,282 --> 01:00:08,312
You did.

932
01:00:10,012 --> 01:00:12,922
That our values are too different,

933
01:00:13,722 --> 01:00:15,222
so we're a terrible match.

934
01:00:17,422 --> 01:00:19,792
I told you we were beyond repair.

935
01:00:21,992 --> 01:00:23,032
But...

936
01:00:26,462 --> 01:00:27,462
Eun Oh.

937
01:00:31,502 --> 01:00:32,942
I really think...

938
01:00:34,912 --> 01:00:36,312
you're the only one for me, for as long as I live.

939
01:00:39,682 --> 01:00:41,812
How can I earn your forgiveness?

940
01:00:45,422 --> 01:00:46,552
Can you please tell me?

941
01:00:48,592 --> 01:00:49,592
What I have to do...

942
01:00:51,692 --> 01:00:53,322
to earn your forgiveness.

943
01:00:59,132 --> 01:01:01,032
Watching you go through surgery this time...

944
01:01:03,172 --> 01:01:04,532
made me realize it for sure.

945
01:01:08,242 --> 01:01:09,542
I just can't let you go.

946
01:01:15,182 --> 01:01:17,112
You're so shameless.

947
01:01:18,852 --> 01:01:20,552
After getting your way with everything,

948
01:01:21,182 --> 01:01:23,122
now you're trying to get your way with me too.

949
01:01:24,962 --> 01:01:26,162
The reasons this won't work between us...

950
01:01:27,162 --> 01:01:28,632
I've explained them more than enough.

951
01:01:31,902 --> 01:01:32,962
I'm sorry.

952
01:01:35,672 --> 01:01:36,732
I really am.

953
01:01:40,042 --> 01:01:41,142
I'm truly sorry.

954
01:01:46,282 --> 01:01:47,742
I want you to forgive me.

955
01:01:59,892 --> 01:02:01,162
You said it yourself, right?

956
01:02:03,432 --> 01:02:06,002
"I'm going to do everything I can for you."

957
01:02:07,102 --> 01:02:08,272
"And you do whatever you want."

958
01:02:11,132 --> 01:02:12,302
Fine, let's do that.

959
01:02:14,502 --> 01:02:15,512
Because I'm...

960
01:02:16,372 --> 01:02:17,972
going to do exactly what I want, too.

961
01:02:22,412 --> 01:02:23,512
I have to be somewhere.

962
01:02:25,082 --> 01:02:26,082
Right.

963
01:02:26,822 --> 01:02:27,822
You...

964
01:02:28,752 --> 01:02:29,822
You just told me...

965
01:02:30,422 --> 01:02:31,892
to do whatever I want, didn't you?

966
01:02:33,222 --> 01:02:34,592
Then that's exactly what I'll do.

967
01:02:51,912 --> 01:02:52,912
What?

968
01:02:55,952 --> 01:02:56,952
What a klutz.

969
01:02:57,882 --> 01:02:59,122
Especially when it's so cold out.

970
01:03:02,292 --> 01:03:04,152
What? Did she grab a cab already?

971
01:03:08,392 --> 01:03:09,992
She's taking the bus?

972
01:03:13,902 --> 01:03:15,172
Eun Oh, you dropped this...

973
01:03:29,352 --> 01:03:30,952
What? Dad!

974
01:03:32,952 --> 01:03:33,982
Dad?

975
01:03:34,582 --> 01:03:37,292
- Mr. Early, you're his dad? - What?

976
01:03:39,262 --> 01:03:40,822
Wait, "Mr. Early?"

977
01:03:41,932 --> 01:03:45,732
Hold on, you know my father?

978
01:04:30,512 --> 01:04:32,782
(Our Golden Days)

979
01:04:33,442 --> 01:04:34,442
I love you.

980
01:04:34,512 --> 01:04:37,882
Marriage? A hundred days turn into a year, then two years.

981
01:04:37,952 --> 01:04:39,552
And who knows? We might actually get married.

982
01:04:39,652 --> 01:04:43,792
- Actually, I met that young lady. - She's a feisty one, isn't she?

983
01:04:43,992 --> 01:04:46,592
Why should I have to tell you about my friends?

984
01:04:46,662 --> 01:04:48,022
Come out, you punk.

985
01:04:48,292 --> 01:04:52,502
- You have a crush on her, right? - Dad!

986
01:04:52,562 --> 01:04:55,032
Honey, you really get a kick out of teasing Ji Hyuk.

987
01:04:55,102 --> 01:04:57,602
- You got this, right? - You got this, too, right?

988
01:04:57,672 --> 01:04:59,902
I'm the architect of this project.

989
01:05:00,402 --> 01:05:02,142
There's someone I want to go see...
