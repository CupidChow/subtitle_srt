1
00:00:01,234 --> 00:00:02,334
What is the medicine for?

2
00:00:04,264 --> 00:00:05,274
What?

3
00:00:06,734 --> 00:00:07,734
Heart failure?

4
00:00:09,044 --> 00:00:10,574
What exactly is heart failure?

5
00:00:11,004 --> 00:00:14,944
It's when your heart gets weaker and can't pump enough blood.

6
00:00:15,384 --> 00:00:16,984
Basically, their heart function is weakened.

7
00:00:18,884 --> 00:00:20,554
Is it really serious?

8
00:00:22,024 --> 00:00:25,094
It depends on their condition. You can't tell from the medication.

9
00:00:25,954 --> 00:00:28,054
If they're still working, it's probably not that severe.

10
00:00:31,734 --> 00:00:32,764
Really?

11
00:00:35,704 --> 00:00:37,704
(Younglim)

12
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:42,504
So he was acting that way because he's sick.

13
00:00:43,044 --> 00:00:46,614
My mom packed enough tofu pockets for two.

14
00:00:46,814 --> 00:00:48,944
The thing is, I don't eat tofu pockets.

15
00:00:49,414 --> 00:00:50,414
I don't like them.

16
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:52,514
Something's come up at work.

17
00:00:52,884 --> 00:00:55,224
We're not at the point where I share company secrets.

18
00:00:55,484 --> 00:00:56,684
I don't have the bandwidth to be considerate...

19
00:00:59,194 --> 00:01:00,554
or worry about anyone else.

20
00:01:01,924 --> 00:01:03,594
No wonder it felt off.

21
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:07,794
When you're sick, your loved one should be there for you.

22
00:01:08,704 --> 00:01:12,274
Pushing me away, acting fine, while thinking he's protecting me.

23
00:01:15,104 --> 00:01:16,604
Lee Ji Hyuk, I swear...

24
00:01:26,514 --> 00:01:28,424
There's quite a lot to prepare.

25
00:01:30,854 --> 00:01:32,524
How about this, Mr. Han?

26
00:01:33,354 --> 00:01:36,464
I have a better idea.

27
00:01:40,494 --> 00:01:41,664
And what's that?

28
00:01:42,264 --> 00:01:43,864
A way to make him...

29
00:01:43,864 --> 00:01:46,474
release the collateral mortgage without a lawsuit.

30
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:49,244
There's a way to do that?

31
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:54,344
My husband is convinced I'd never actually sue him.

32
00:01:55,744 --> 00:01:59,054
Because I can't afford a retainer, and time isn't on my side.

33
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:04,424
A lawsuit can take anywhere from 1 to 3 years, it's true.

34
00:02:04,754 --> 00:02:05,894
Exactly.

35
00:02:06,154 --> 00:02:07,724
But then, I go ahead and file the lawsuit.

36
00:02:08,824 --> 00:02:13,264
He knows if it goes to court, he could face criminal charges.

37
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:14,734
You think he'd let it get to that point?

38
00:02:14,794 --> 00:02:17,404
But you said you were going to sue him.

39
00:02:18,434 --> 00:02:21,374
I was. But like I said, I've thought of a better way.

40
00:02:22,974 --> 00:02:27,674
I need you to draft the complaint and send him a photo of it.

41
00:02:28,044 --> 00:02:29,984
That'll get a reaction out of him.

42
00:02:32,354 --> 00:02:33,784
So he'll reach out to you...

43
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,784
and propose a settlement.

44
00:02:37,654 --> 00:02:39,554
No, he'll contact you, Attorney Han.

45
00:02:40,354 --> 00:02:43,924
He'll probably offer you money not to take this case.

46
00:02:46,094 --> 00:02:47,564
Then let's use that money...

47
00:02:47,794 --> 00:02:50,264
for the retainer on my divorce case.

48
00:02:52,904 --> 00:02:55,104
You really think he'll do that?

49
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:58,174
One hundred percent.

50
00:03:02,014 --> 00:03:03,244
As tempting as that is,

51
00:03:03,744 --> 00:03:05,284
that would be a violation of the Attorney Act for me.

52
00:03:06,314 --> 00:03:09,054
Really? Then don't take the money.

53
00:03:09,684 --> 00:03:13,454
Him contacting you will in itself be proof...

54
00:03:13,524 --> 00:03:14,724
that he secretly got the mortgage.

55
00:03:15,524 --> 00:03:18,634
Whether he texts or calls you using someone else's name,

56
00:03:19,264 --> 00:03:22,304
his goal will be to tell you not to represent Ko Seong Hui.

57
00:03:24,864 --> 00:03:28,674
- So? - Give me proof they contacted you.

58
00:03:29,274 --> 00:03:30,974
I'll handle the negotiations myself.

59
00:03:33,274 --> 00:03:36,714
So, all I have to do for now is draft the official complaint.

60
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:39,354
You can do that right away, can't you?

61
00:03:39,854 --> 00:03:41,414
Just drafting the complaint? Yes, I can do that.

62
00:03:42,184 --> 00:03:44,054
In that case, should we draft...

63
00:03:44,054 --> 00:03:45,524
a 20 percent contingency fee contract?

64
00:03:45,854 --> 00:03:48,394
Even if we settle, a promise is a promise.

65
00:03:49,024 --> 00:03:50,224
Even if we settle?

66
00:03:51,194 --> 00:03:52,994
A 20 percent contingency fee.

67
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:57,034
Once the mortgage is cleared, you'll start my divorce case.

68
00:03:58,464 --> 00:04:02,104
He's the at-fault party now, so I can get a divorce, right?

69
00:04:03,974 --> 00:04:05,204
If we can pull that off...

70
00:04:06,374 --> 00:04:07,714

Shoe...

74
00:04:15,324 --> 00:04:19,454
The key is that a real lawyer has taken on the case.

75
00:04:20,624 --> 00:04:24,794
He must've thought since I'm broke, I'd never be able to hire a lawyer.

00:11:02,464 --> 00:11:04,594
I don't want to bring Su Bin into a family like this.

180
00:11:05,734 --> 00:11:07,434
Who said anything about getting married?

181
00:11:07,794 --> 00:11:08,794
Just date her.

182
00:11:09,804 --> 00:11:11,904
If I get Su Bin back,

183
00:11:12,504 --> 00:11:14,934
I'm never letting her go. I can't.

184
00:11:16,444 --> 00:11:17,974
My dad found out everything,

185
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,044
and he kicked that woman out.

186
00:11:21,744 --> 00:11:22,744
What? When?

187
00:11:23,014 --> 00:11:25,184
Why are you only telling me now? What about Eun Oh?

188
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,554
I put a security detail on her.

189
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:28,854
For Eun Oh's mom and her younger brother too.

190
00:11:29,624 --> 00:11:33,994
Dad found out and added more guards without her family knowing.

191
00:11:36,294 --> 00:11:38,224
And while all that was happening, I'm just lying here...

192
00:11:39,234 --> 00:11:40,434
I feel so bad for you.

193
00:11:42,734 --> 00:11:44,104
If you're worried about me,

194
00:11:46,504 --> 00:11:47,674
then you better make it through this.

195
00:11:49,944 --> 00:11:50,944
Without you,

196
00:11:53,444 --> 00:11:54,444
what would I do?

197
00:12:09,764 --> 00:12:11,724
So? Did you two actually do it?

198
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:14,234
It's fine. I won't let him get away this time. I mean it.

199
00:12:14,464 --> 00:12:17,364
- Listen to that confidence. - I'm so embarrassed.

200
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,814
Eun Oh still has such a beautiful smile.

201
00:12:58,844 --> 00:12:59,844
Hey, Ji Hyuk!

202
00:13:00,114 --> 00:13:02,844
- Dad! - What are the odds?

203
00:13:03,284 --> 00:13:04,444
Hey, here's your lunch.

204
00:13:06,214 --> 00:13:07,554
Wait, you packed me lunch?

205
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:10,854
I'll be packing your lunch from now on.

206
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:14,054
But Dad, I'm already signed up for a healthy meal delivery service.

207
00:13:14,124 --> 00:13:15,554
Just cancel it.

208
00:13:16,164 --> 00:13:19,064
Come on, let me do this one thing for you. Please?

209
00:13:19,494 --> 00:13:22,504
I'll make it for you after your mom leaves for work,

210
00:13:22,564 --> 00:13:24,334
and then I'll drop it off right here for you.

211
00:13:24,834 --> 00:13:26,174
Dad...

212
00:13:26,574 --> 00:13:30,774
Hey, you must be craving something. Just name it, and I'll make it.

213
00:13:31,004 --> 00:13:32,544
I can even make it with low sodium.

214
00:13:35,644 --> 00:13:38,984
Okay, then I'll only take them until you have to leave for work.

215
00:13:39,554 --> 00:13:41,114
Right. I have a job now, don't I?

216
00:13:43,054 --> 00:13:46,054
Hey, it's cold out. Get inside. Go on. I'm going. All right.

217
00:14:07,344 --> 00:14:10,744
Anyway, caffeine is bad for Ji Hyuk,

218
00:14:10,744 --> 00:14:12,884
so if anyone gives him coffee, you have to take it from him.

219
00:14:14,214 --> 00:14:18,624
I don't get why he's hiding it. If you're sick, just tell people.

220
00:14:20,354 --> 00:14:22,354
His parents must know, right?

221
00:14:24,494 --> 00:14:26,094
He's hiding it...

222
00:14:26,594 --> 00:14:29,204
because he really hates being a burden to anyone.

223
00:14:30,304 --> 00:14:31,304
Unbelievable.

224
00:14:32,674 --> 00:14:36,744
But surely he wouldn't hide it from his parents, right?

225
00:14:39,214 --> 00:14:40,214
Who could be calling?

226
00:14:46,054 --> 00:14:47,684
(Yong Su Cheol)

227
00:14:50,124 --> 00:14:54,124
- Hey, Su Cheol. - Mr. Earl...

228
00:14:56,264 --> 00:14:58,824
Hello? Are you there?

229
00:14:59,494 --> 00:15:02,034
Sorry about that.

230
00:15:03,004 --> 00:15:06,834
I was just wondering if I should still be calling you Mr. Early.

231
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,704
What? What are you talking about?

232
00:15:12,944 --> 00:15:16,484
You see, I have feelings for Ji Hyuk.

233
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:19,554
You...

234
00:15:20,384 --> 00:15:22,014
You like Ji Hyuk?

235
00:15:23,754 --> 00:15:24,754
Yes.

236
00:15:25,754 --> 00:15:26,824
That's why...

237
00:15:27,454 --> 00:15:31,294
it feels weird calling you Mr. Early like we're just friends.

238
00:15:32,734 --> 00:15:35,034
So I don't know if I should call you Mr. Lee,

239
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,304
or if I should call you Father.

240
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,104
Hello?

241
00:15:42,404 --> 00:15:43,404
Are you still there?

242
00:15:45,104 --> 00:15:46,114
Father?

243
00:15:48,744 --> 00:15:50,744
Goodness.

244
00:15:51,514 --> 00:15:54,014
I like the sound of Father.

245
00:15:54,584 --> 00:15:59,454
All of Ji Hyuk's friends call me Dad or Father anyway, so why not?

246
00:16:00,094 --> 00:16:01,724
It's just that, all this time,

247
00:16:02,254 --> 00:16:05,994
I enjoyed having a young friend. That's all.

248
00:16:11,864 --> 00:16:13,604
Lately, Ji Hyuk...

249
00:16:13,904 --> 00:16:16,444
has seemed a little under the weather.

250
00:16:18,174 --> 00:16:19,814
The one thing I need you to do for me now...

251
00:16:20,914 --> 00:16:23,684
is make sure Mom, Ji Wan, and Su Bin don't find out.

252
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,454
I want to live as if nothing is wrong.

253
00:16:29,284 --> 00:16:32,584
Oh, that's...

254
00:16:32,924 --> 00:16:35,724
Ji Hyuk's just been so wrapped up in work lately,

255
00:16:36,164 --> 00:16:38,494
that I think he's just run down from exhaustion.

256
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:42,194
So at work, could you, Su Cheol... I mean, you...

257
00:16:42,734 --> 00:16:45,534
Eun Oh, could you please look out for him for me?

258
00:16:47,434 --> 00:16:49,304
You'd be okay with me taking care of him?

259
00:16:49,874 --> 00:16:52,744
Of course! Why wouldn't it be okay?

260
00:16:53,244 --> 00:16:56,014
Ji Hyuk likes you too, you know.

261
00:16:57,284 --> 00:16:58,914
You even know about that?

262
00:16:59,314 --> 00:17:03,184
I'm not trying to pressure you. Really.

263
00:17:09,224 --> 00:17:11,994
That means you don't mind me either. Right, Father?

264
00:17:13,334 --> 00:17:14,394
Then that's all I need to hear.

265
00:17:17,234 --> 00:17:20,134
How are you after your surgery? Are you doing okay?

266
00:17:20,734 --> 00:17:23,204
I'm doing great. Don't you worry.

267
00:17:23,874 --> 00:17:26,114
They said I'm totally fine.

268
00:17:27,574 --> 00:17:28,644
Good.

269
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,344
That's a relief, then.

270
00:17:31,044 --> 00:17:34,114
But still, make sure you take care of yourself, all right?

271
00:17:34,684 --> 00:17:37,324
Looks like I've got another call.

272
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:40,754
- I have to go. We'll talk later. - Okay, Father.

273
00:17:49,504 --> 00:17:51,564
So his father doesn't know either?

274
00:17:56,204 --> 00:17:58,344
Ji Hyuk is really something else.

275
00:18:00,044 --> 00:18:02,344
He must be so lonely, dealing with this all by himself.

276
00:18:16,264 --> 00:18:18,394
No. I can't let him go like this.

277
00:18:18,624 --> 00:18:21,294
Ji Hyuk... I can't let him go like this.

278
00:18:21,694 --> 00:18:23,064
This can't be happening.

279
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,504
He's finally made it through that dark tunnel...

280
00:18:28,134 --> 00:18:30,044
and just stepped into the light.

281
00:18:30,774 --> 00:18:32,074
And now he's supposed to just die?

282
00:18:33,274 --> 00:18:34,914
No, that can't be right.

283
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:38,614
I can't let him go like that. He was so close.

284
00:18:39,584 --> 00:18:41,414
All he had left to do was be happy.

285
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:44,354
How can I let a son like that go?

286
00:18:51,894 --> 00:18:54,934
- Dad! What are you doing? - What?

287
00:18:57,964 --> 00:18:59,874
Dad, look at you. You look so haggard.

288
00:19:01,234 --> 00:19:04,844
Dad, where'd you go after making my lunch?

289
00:19:05,274 --> 00:19:08,714
I was a little bored, so I went for a walk.

290
00:19:09,074 --> 00:19:10,544
So, how was it? Was it any good?

291
00:19:10,914 --> 00:19:15,254
Yes. I dipped it in soy sauce. It was amazing.

292
00:19:15,314 --> 00:19:19,054
Really? That's a relief. Why'd you come down?

293
00:19:19,454 --> 00:19:22,864
I figured you'd be bored, so I came down.

294
00:19:23,824 --> 00:19:25,964
Dad, here. You can watch videos on this.

295
00:19:26,964 --> 00:19:30,964
Movies, documentaries, miniseries... There's tons of stuff.

296
00:19:31,964 --> 00:19:36,474
- You're saying I can use this? - Yes. It was mine...

297
00:19:36,544 --> 00:19:40,274
before I upgraded for video editing, but it's still pretty nice.

298
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,814
I already saved a bunch of fun stuff on here for you.

299
00:19:44,614 --> 00:19:45,744
Just what I needed.

300
00:19:48,984 --> 00:19:51,754

301
00:19:52,784 --> 00:19:54,954

307

There's no way.

308
00:20:30,964 --> 00:20:31,994
There's no way!

309
00:20:33,034 --> 00:20:36,564
Why? Why isn't there a way? Why?

310
00:20:44,474 --> 00:20:45,874
Why did it have to be Ji Hyuk?

311
00:20:46,744 --> 00:20:48,314
Of all people, why did it have to be Ji Hyuk?

312
00:20:49,444 --> 00:20:51,784
I'm right here. Take me instead.

313
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:54,054
How can this be happening?

314
00:20:55,014 --> 00:20:56,084
How?

315
00:20:56,784 --> 00:20:57,884
How?

316
00:21:05,624 --> 00:21:06,634
Father!

317
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:10,234
Why are you taking Ji Hyuk?

318
00:21:11,334 --> 00:21:12,334
Mom!

319
00:21:13,374 --> 00:21:15,004
Can't you do anything to stop this?

320
00:21:16,974 --> 00:21:18,004
How do I get there?

321
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:22,274
How do I get there? I'll go talk to them myself. I will!

322
00:21:30,854 --> 00:21:31,854
Ji Hyuk.

323
00:21:32,284 --> 00:21:34,194
What am I going to do about Ji Hyuk? My boy, Ji Hyuk.

324
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:37,164
Please, just save him.

325
00:21:37,924 --> 00:21:39,894
Please save him.

326
00:21:41,564 --> 00:21:43,064
If you just save Ji Hyuk,

327
00:21:44,034 --> 00:21:47,174
you can take my life right now.

328
00:21:48,434 --> 00:21:52,904
Please, just save him. I'm begging you.

329
00:22:00,514 --> 00:22:02,384
Yeong Ra, this...

330
00:22:06,424 --> 00:22:07,454
Writer Park.

331
00:22:08,654 --> 00:22:09,664
Yes?

332
00:22:10,494 --> 00:22:12,064
So you do know you're a writer.

333
00:22:12,694 --> 00:22:13,894
What's with the long face?

334
00:22:14,264 --> 00:22:15,834
Are you still worried about your mother?

335
00:22:18,634 --> 00:22:22,574
She was blowing up my phone, and then suddenly, nothing.

336
00:22:24,174 --> 00:22:27,674
I'm unsure if she found another way, or if something's happened to her.

337
00:22:28,944 --> 00:22:30,014
It's making me so anxious.

338
00:22:31,814 --> 00:22:34,954
I get it. She's still your mother, after all.

339
00:22:36,084 --> 00:22:37,084
Right.

340
00:22:38,184 --> 00:22:39,184
Hey, Yeong Ra.

341
00:22:40,554 --> 00:22:42,694
Let me tell you a really interesting story.

342
00:22:45,724 --> 00:22:48,494
The tragic love life of Lee Ji Wan?

343
00:22:49,864 --> 00:22:51,064
Your love life?

344
00:22:51,664 --> 00:22:54,634
I was a pretty simple guy when it came to dating.

345
00:22:55,134 --> 00:22:59,544
When I liked someone, I'd go all in, showering them with flowers,

346
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:01,674
and when she wanted a nice car, I leased a luxury import.

347
00:23:02,674 --> 00:23:07,184
But she wouldn't marry me unless I got a three-bedroom unit in Seoul.

348
00:23:07,654 --> 00:23:08,684
Like that's even possible.

349
00:23:09,584 --> 00:23:11,184
Wait, you were going to get married?

350
00:23:11,984 --> 00:23:14,024
I really liked her back then.

351
00:23:15,354 --> 00:23:17,894
But then, out of nowhere, she hands me a wedding invitation.

352
00:23:18,164 --> 00:23:20,834
She was getting married to some other guy in a week.

353
00:23:22,034 --> 00:23:23,104
You've got to be kidding me.

354
00:23:23,704 --> 00:23:26,534
Wait, so she was cheating on you the whole time?

355
00:23:27,304 --> 00:23:28,834
- Yes. - That witch!

356
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:32,704
Did you just call her a witch?

357
00:23:33,274 --> 00:23:34,944
She is one!

358
00:23:35,374 --> 00:23:36,814
I can't believe people like that exist.

359
00:23:37,514 --> 00:23:40,254
So what did you do? Did you get revenge?

360
00:23:40,614 --> 00:23:45,254
Revenge? Please. She married a rich guy with a fancy apartment.

361
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:46,824
I couldn't do a thing.

362
00:23:47,324 --> 00:23:48,624
It's not like I have that kind of power.

363
00:23:49,824 --> 00:23:51,264
What's wrong with you?

364
00:23:51,624 --> 00:23:55,334
You should've at least exposed her. Told him she was a two-timer.

365
00:23:57,004 --> 00:23:59,564
She must've had zero respect for you to give you an invitation.

366
00:24:00,004 --> 00:24:02,574
She knew you wouldn't dare make a scene at her wedding!

367
00:24:03,374 --> 00:24:06,174
She knew. Hong Mi knew me too well.

368
00:24:06,644 --> 00:24:10,714
But with me, you're always so tough and blowing me off.

369
00:24:11,014 --> 00:24:12,514
You even took down that stalker.

370
00:24:13,554 --> 00:24:16,354
I'm just a softie when it comes to my girl.

371
00:24:16,754 --> 00:24:17,854
And I never cheat.

372
00:24:19,954 --> 00:24:21,024
"Your girl?"

373
00:24:22,124 --> 00:24:26,634
So you're so hard on me because I'm not your girlfriend.

374
00:24:28,234 --> 00:24:29,564
Pathetic, isn't it?

375
00:24:30,234 --> 00:24:33,574
Hey, I wonder if we could use this as an episode for "City Rapunzel."

376
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:36,074
Let's do it.

377
00:24:36,744 --> 00:24:39,404
And let's make it a huge hit so that she's forced to watch it.

378
00:24:40,814 --> 00:24:42,544
That woman is so infuriating!

379
00:24:43,074 --> 00:24:44,314
You're frustrating, too.

380
00:24:47,854 --> 00:24:51,224
I'll have to think about how to frame this revenge episode.

381
00:24:53,724 --> 00:24:55,354
Bring me the files. Let's brainstorm.

382
00:24:55,924 --> 00:24:57,024
What? Okay.

383
00:25:02,294 --> 00:25:04,034
I guess her mom's no longer on her mind now.

384
00:25:04,904 --> 00:25:05,904
What a relief.

385
00:25:11,344 --> 00:25:13,214
Why haven't I heard from Park Jin Seok?

386
00:25:14,614 --> 00:25:16,614
This shouldn't be taking so long.

387
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,654
Attorney Han, still no word?

388
00:25:29,454 --> 00:25:30,794
The nerve.

389
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:40,434
I'm sorry. For personal reasons, I must withdraw from this case.

390
00:25:40,904 --> 00:25:41,904
You're backing out?

391
00:25:42,904 --> 00:25:44,404
Is he out of his mind?

392
00:25:48,774 --> 00:25:50,744
(Attorney Han Seong Ju)

393
00:25:50,814 --> 00:25:52,814
Park Jin Seok paid you off, didn't he?

394
00:25:53,754 --> 00:25:57,454
He paid you to drop my case. How much was it?

395
00:25:57,484 --> 00:26:01,624
That's an insulting accusation. It's a serious ethical violation.

396
00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:04,894
- Then why are you dropping my case? - It's just that...

397
00:26:06,194 --> 00:26:08,134
There are circumstances I'm not at liberty to discuss.

398
00:26:09,394 --> 00:26:10,464
How much did he pay you?

399
00:26:11,264 --> 00:26:12,264
Did he offer more...

400
00:26:12,264 --> 00:26:13,274
than my eight-million-dollar contingency fee?

401
00:26:13,904 --> 00:26:15,174
That can't be it.

402
00:26:15,174 --> 00:26:17,344
Even as chairman, do you think he'd spend eight million...

403
00:26:17,344 --> 00:26:19,474
just to teach his wife a lesson?

404
00:26:22,544 --> 00:26:23,814
Did he threaten to make sure you lose?

405
00:26:24,214 --> 00:26:26,544
Or is it because you think you can't get the contingency fee?

406
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:30,484
It's because I'm afraid.

407
00:26:30,724 --> 00:26:33,184
Ma'am, you're up against someone who can corner a person like this,

408
00:26:33,254 --> 00:26:35,754
and I'm afraid I'll get caught up and just vanish without a trace.

409
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,734
So he threatened you and paid you off at the same time.

410
00:26:41,064 --> 00:26:42,334
I wasn't threatened.

411
00:26:44,004 --> 00:26:45,134
And I received no money.

412
00:26:45,404 --> 00:26:46,404
Shut it!

413
00:26:47,304 --> 00:26:49,974
How dare you tell such a blatant lie to my face.

414
00:26:50,944 --> 00:26:51,944
Please leave.

415
00:26:53,644 --> 00:26:56,044
Fine. Just tell me what he said to you.

416
00:26:56,784 --> 00:26:58,644
He did contact you, right?

417
00:26:58,684 --> 00:27:02,184
He did, but I can't tell you what was said.

418
00:27:09,324 --> 00:27:10,894
Is that so? All right.

Ko Seong Hui.

422
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:24,774
You're clearly backed into a corner now.

423
00:27:30,644 --> 00:27:31,684
I'm home.

424
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:33,614
Ji Hyuk.

425
00:27:34,314 --> 00:27:35,314
Have you eaten?

426
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:37,184
I ate already, Mom.

427
00:27:38,054 --> 00:27:40,154
From now on, don't worry about making me dinner.

428
00:27:40,754 --> 00:27:42,094
I won't be able to eat dinner at home.

429
00:27:42,724 --> 00:27:43,724
Are you busy again?

430
00:27:45,364 --> 00:27:47,564
Yes. Where's Dad?

431
00:27:48,034 --> 00:27:50,234
Your dad has been going out a lot lately.

432
00:27:50,564 --> 00:27:52,164
Can you believe he just sent a text today, too?

433
00:27:54,074 --> 00:27:55,804
You should go out with friends too, Mom.

434
00:27:56,434 --> 00:27:59,644
You get off work early. Go out and have a nice dinner,

435
00:27:59,704 --> 00:28:00,774
and maybe go to a dessert cafe.

436
00:28:01,774 --> 00:28:03,214
That sounds wonderful.

437
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:09,614
And, Mom. Check your bank account tomorrow.

438
00:28:09,914 --> 00:28:11,624
I'll send you some money to spend.

439
00:28:16,724 --> 00:28:17,724
Oh my.

00:29:57,924 --> 00:29:59,024
Here, Ji Hyuk.

462
00:29:59,324 --> 00:30:00,464

I haven't been working out lately,

465

so I guess I'm not as strong as I used to be.

What are you talking about? Do you know how much Dad weighs?

467
00:30:25,654 --> 00:30:27,124
You must have been exhausted.

468
00:30:28,124 --> 00:30:29,294
Get some rest.

00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:50,234
Really?

531
00:36:50,804 --> 00:36:51,804
Got it.

532
00:36:52,174 --> 00:36:54,744
She acted as if she knew why he packed me a lunch.

533
00:36:55,614 --> 00:36:59,414
Want me to grab you a sandwich? How about a chicken breast sandwich?

534
00:37:01,384 --> 00:37:05,584
She's making sure I eat, she knows my diet,

535
00:37:06,184 --> 00:37:07,924
she's a friend of Dad's...

536
00:37:08,994 --> 00:37:10,394
Could Dad have told her?

537
00:37:11,364 --> 00:37:12,364
Come on.

538
00:37:12,794 --> 00:37:13,894
No way.

539
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:20,504
Come in.

540
00:37:28,844 --> 00:37:31,044
What brings you to my office?

541
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:34,284
Ji Eun Oh.

542
00:37:35,654 --> 00:37:37,824
You've moved on, right?

543
00:37:38,424 --> 00:37:39,554
Emotionally, I mean.

544
00:37:41,454 --> 00:37:42,454
Excuse me?

545
00:37:42,954 --> 00:37:44,394
What you told me the other day.

546
00:37:45,324 --> 00:37:49,234
And what if I mean it when I say I like you again?

547
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:53,804
You're completely over those feelings, right?

548
00:37:54,904 --> 00:37:56,574
We're just alumni...

549
00:37:57,104 --> 00:37:58,344
and coworkers.

550
00:37:59,544 --> 00:38:01,074
That's all there is...

551
00:38:01,844 --> 00:38:02,974
to our relationship, right?

552
00:38:07,554 --> 00:38:08,584
Why are you...

553
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:11,084
suddenly asking me to confirm that?

554
00:38:12,824 --> 00:38:14,054
I want to be sure,

555
00:38:15,454 --> 00:38:16,594
because...

556
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:19,164
you're treating me very comfortably, like a junior would.

557
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:23,334
You're looking out for my meals and getting me drinks.

558
00:38:23,764 --> 00:38:26,164
What do I do? What do I say?

559
00:38:27,734 --> 00:38:29,074
I want to make things clear.

560
00:38:29,734 --> 00:38:31,874
That's how I'll know whether to keep it strictly professional,

561
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:35,714
or if we can be comfortable colleagues.

562
00:38:36,844 --> 00:38:37,844
You're over...

563
00:38:38,914 --> 00:38:39,984
your feelings for me, right?

564
00:38:51,194 --> 00:38:52,194
No.

565
00:38:56,464 --> 00:38:57,464
Then...

566
00:38:58,134 --> 00:39:00,734
what was all that behaviour about?

567
00:39:02,074 --> 00:39:03,134
Were you just pretending to care?

568
00:39:05,174 --> 00:39:06,174
I...

569
00:39:07,914 --> 00:39:09,014
I know that...

570
00:39:10,174 --> 00:39:11,184
you're sick.

571
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:16,284
I figured it out from the medication you're taking.

572
00:39:21,624 --> 00:39:23,994
You're telling me you went through my desk?

573
00:39:25,494 --> 00:39:26,494
I did.

574
00:39:27,464 --> 00:39:29,764
Yes, I did. So what?

575
00:39:31,104 --> 00:39:32,434
You did the same thing.

576
00:39:33,064 --> 00:39:34,704
You said you couldn't give up on me...

577
00:39:34,704 --> 00:39:36,334
and that you'd do whatever you could.

578
00:39:37,774 --> 00:39:39,804
So what if I'm doing the same thing?

579
00:39:42,074 --> 00:39:46,714
Can we please get on the same page?

580
00:39:48,814 --> 00:39:50,514
Why is having heart failure such a big deal?

581
00:39:51,924 --> 00:39:54,024
You can get treatment while we're dating.

582
00:39:57,724 --> 00:39:58,824
Heart failure?

583
00:40:01,594 --> 00:40:02,594
I sent my friend...

584
00:40:03,994 --> 00:40:06,104
a list of the medications you're taking.

585
00:40:06,864 --> 00:40:08,334
She said it's for heart failure.

586
00:40:09,134 --> 00:40:10,944
I've even researched it and everything.

587
00:40:11,904 --> 00:40:14,344
So that's why. She thinks it's just heart failure.

588
00:40:17,174 --> 00:40:19,684
Do you really think that little of me?

589
00:40:20,854 --> 00:40:21,884
If the roles were reversed,

590
00:40:22,254 --> 00:40:25,824
and I was sick, would you leave me? Of course you wouldn't.

591
00:40:27,324 --> 00:40:30,624
I'm so sick of these games.

592
00:40:32,564 --> 00:40:33,824
This isn't a game.

593
00:40:35,534 --> 00:40:36,534
Then...

594
00:40:37,164 --> 00:40:38,164
go out with me.

595
00:40:40,534 --> 00:40:42,474
How can you be so confident when you have no idea?

596
00:40:43,104 --> 00:40:44,204
You've been sick before, too.

597
00:40:44,944 --> 00:40:45,944
Don't you understand how I feel?

598
00:40:47,174 --> 00:40:50,984
- I really don't care you're sick. - I'm sick, so I don't want to date!

599
00:40:54,044 --> 00:40:55,454
I don't have the energy for that.

600
00:40:57,524 --> 00:40:58,554
I don't want to.

601
00:40:59,724 --> 00:41:01,094
All those feelings...

602
00:41:04,124 --> 00:41:05,124
are just a hassle.

603
00:41:07,634 --> 00:41:08,694
Dealing with my illness and work...

604
00:41:11,264 --> 00:41:13,304
is all I can handle.

605
00:41:18,374 --> 00:41:19,374
That doesn't include you.

606
00:41:27,814 --> 00:41:28,814
That's a lie.

607
00:41:31,584 --> 00:41:34,294
Do you know how good you are at saying things you don't mean?

608
00:41:35,524 --> 00:41:37,564
Is that why you're thinking about taking on some copycat project?

609
00:41:38,294 --> 00:41:40,164
You deliberately provoked me so I'd take on...

610
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:42,134
the head of the Turnkey Team position.

611
00:41:42,394 --> 00:41:44,734
I thought you didn't like talking to me, Ms. Ji Eun Oh.

612
00:41:45,134 --> 00:41:47,004
You were afraid I'd find out you liked me,

613
00:41:47,334 --> 00:41:48,874
so you pushed me away on purpose.

614
00:41:49,074 --> 00:41:51,574
You shouldn't have even remembered that I like the hanok style.

615
00:41:52,004 --> 00:41:54,244
Why do things I haven't asked for? It messes with my head.

616
00:41:55,344 --> 00:41:56,674
When you do this, it makes me...

617
00:41:57,244 --> 00:41:58,644
Instead of admitting you like me,

618
00:41:59,814 --> 00:42:01,214
you just get mad at me.

619
00:42:04,014 --> 00:42:07,554
You're hiding your illness and pushing me away, all for my sake.

620
00:42:08,554 --> 00:42:09,554
I...

621
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:11,194
I'm not falling for it this time.

622
00:42:14,494 --> 00:42:15,594
You've got to be kidding me.

623
00:42:17,264 --> 00:42:18,564
Think whatever you want,

624
00:42:19,434 --> 00:42:20,534
but I'm the one saying no.

625
00:42:21,004 --> 00:42:23,704
Are you going to keep stressing out a sick person?

626
00:42:24,944 --> 00:42:26,374
Is that your way of showing you care?

627
00:42:29,614 --> 00:42:31,084
From now on, you...

628
00:42:33,144 --> 00:42:34,184
I mean, Ms. Ji.

629
00:42:37,184 --> 00:42:38,424
You're just my employee.

630
00:42:40,054 --> 00:42:41,554
Nothing more, nothing less.

631
00:42:44,224 --> 00:42:45,224
Keep that in mind.

632
00:42:45,764 --> 00:42:46,764
I refuse!

633
00:42:46,824 --> 00:42:48,864
(Younglim)

634
00:43:03,544 --> 00:43:05,514
(Thursday, January 22)

635
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:21,134
I need a moment of your time.

636
00:43:21,264 --> 00:43:22,894
Message me on the company chat if it's about work.

637
00:43:33,504 --> 00:43:36,814
How can I help you? You need to go through me first.

638
00:43:37,574 --> 00:43:38,684
It's personal.

639
00:43:39,444 --> 00:43:40,684
Then I can't allow it.

640
00:43:41,584 --> 00:43:44,784
Team Leader Ji Eun Oh, this is a workplace.

641
00:43:47,724 --> 00:43:50,794
(CEO's Office)

642
00:44:14,214 --> 00:44:15,254
(Lee Ji Hyuk, CEO)

643
00:44:15,314 --> 00:44:16,314
(In a meeting. Please try again later.)

644
00:44:24,594 --> 00:44:25,924
(In a meeting. Please try again later.)

645
00:44:25,994 --> 00:44:27,564
I guess he's really not going to see me.

646
00:44:28,494 --> 00:44:29,864
He's being so cold-hearted.

647
00:44:30,734 --> 00:44:31,734
He's not giving me an opening.

648
00:44:33,864 --> 00:44:35,434
But...

649
00:44:36,034 --> 00:44:39,044
What if that's how Ji Hyuk really feels?

650
00:44:39,804 --> 00:44:42,044
He's got a huge responsibility running the company, and...

651
00:44:42,744 --> 00:44:45,484
we also don't know exactly what his condition is.

652
00:44:48,754 --> 00:44:49,854
That's true.

653
00:44:51,884 --> 00:44:53,524
But it's not like he's dying.

654
00:44:54,154 --> 00:44:55,924
We can get through it together.

655
00:44:56,554 --> 00:44:57,554
Right.

656
00:44:58,294 --> 00:44:59,294
Or am I wrong?

657
00:44:59,824 --> 00:45:01,294
By acting this way,

658
00:45:01,564 --> 00:45:03,894
am I just making things harder for Ji Hyuk?

659
00:45:05,964 --> 00:45:08,774
He's not giving you an inch.

660
00:45:12,744 --> 00:45:14,544
So I should just pretend I don't know anything and wait,

661
00:45:15,344 --> 00:45:18,884
and then pop up as his girlfriend after he's all better?

662
00:45:19,244 --> 00:45:20,544
That's ridiculous too.

663
00:45:23,714 --> 00:45:26,284
Just watching the man I love be sick like this...

664
00:45:27,794 --> 00:45:28,794
is so painful.

665
00:45:33,624 --> 00:45:35,834
What the heck? Are you crazy? Get out now!

666
00:45:35,894 --> 00:45:38,534
Eun Oh, this is urgent. We need to talk.

667
00:45:39,004 --> 00:45:41,174
The worst has happened because of you.

668
00:45:42,034 --> 00:45:43,604
So you and I have some talking to do.

669
00:45:46,044 --> 00:45:48,674
Su Jeong, I'm fine. You can leave us.

670
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:51,914
Darn.

671
00:45:55,984 --> 00:45:59,484
If you feel even a bit unsafe, just scream. I'll be right outside.

672
00:46:01,154 --> 00:46:02,554
Why you little...

673
00:46:08,894 --> 00:46:10,564
You're really something else.

674
00:46:11,264 --> 00:46:12,364
How could you even think of seeing me again?

675
00:46:12,434 --> 00:46:15,074
You got me kicked out, so of course I had to come find you.

676
00:46:17,404 --> 00:46:18,504
You got kicked out?

677
00:46:18,504 --> 00:46:20,604
Did you think Seong Jae wouldn't tell his father?

678
00:46:21,844 --> 00:46:23,574
No, he wouldn't have.

679
00:46:24,144 --> 00:46:26,614
Mr. Park is a man of his word.

680
00:46:27,484 --> 00:46:29,514
Then how else would my husband have found out?

681
00:46:30,414 --> 00:46:33,324
He knew about you, Woo Jin, and that you were declared dead.

682
00:46:33,724 --> 00:46:35,154
How else would he know if it wasn't Seong Jae?

683
00:46:37,424 --> 00:46:40,394
So you came here to blame this on me?

684
00:46:41,594 --> 00:46:43,234
Thanks to you, I was kicked out without a penny to my name.

685
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:45,664
Give me 200,000 dollars from the money I gave you.

686
00:46:46,404 --> 00:46:47,634
There's a lawsuit I have to deal with.

687
00:46:50,404 --> 00:46:52,344
You're here to get money from me?

688
00:46:53,074 --> 00:46:55,514
It's your fault, so you should pay me at least that.

689
00:46:56,344 --> 00:46:57,644
I'm down to my last 100 dollars.

690
00:46:59,744 --> 00:47:01,254
Should I give her the 200,000 dollars?

691
00:47:02,154 --> 00:47:03,154
Give me the 200,000 dollars,

692
00:47:03,684 --> 00:47:04,684
and I'll stay away from Woo Jin.

693
00:47:06,254 --> 00:47:07,254
What did you say?

694
00:47:07,554 --> 00:47:09,554
I said I'd give up Woo Jin for good.

695
00:47:10,124 --> 00:47:11,194
So give me the 200,000 dollars.

696
00:47:12,124 --> 00:47:13,124
No.

697
00:47:13,924 --> 00:47:16,634
What? After I ended up in this mess because of you,

698
00:47:16,694 --> 00:47:19,304
you won't give me 200,000 dollars out of the million?

699
00:47:19,964 --> 00:47:24,804
I wouldn't give a penny to someone who'd sell their son for 200,000.

700
00:47:25,204 --> 00:47:29,074
Besides, I don't have the money. I told you I gave it to Woo Jin.

701
00:47:29,244 --> 00:47:31,414
Then you can just ask Woo Jin for it.

702
00:47:33,384 --> 00:47:34,384
Hey, Su Jeong.

703
00:47:35,614 --> 00:47:36,754
What are you doing out here?

704
00:47:37,014 --> 00:47:38,124
Ji Hyuk, it's just...

705
00:47:38,724 --> 00:47:39,724
Fine. 100,000 dollars, then.

706
00:47:40,584 --> 00:47:42,594
If you don't even give me that, I won't just let this go.

707
00:47:42,854 --> 00:47:46,564
- Is that a threat? - Hey, Ji Eun Oh!

708
00:47:48,094 --> 00:47:49,964
I thought I told you to never set foot in here again.

709
00:47:50,864 --> 00:47:52,404
- Ji Hyuk. - What? What are you doing?

710
00:47:52,904 --> 00:47:53,904
Oh my.

711
00:47:55,434 --> 00:47:58,344
What the heck are you doing? Let go of me! Darn it.

712
00:47:58,344 --> 00:47:59,444
Are you even human?

713
00:48:00,004 --> 00:48:01,474
How dare you show your face here again?

714
00:48:01,814 --> 00:48:03,714
Who do you think you are, harassing Eun Oh?

715
00:48:03,974 --> 00:48:05,014
Do you have a death wish?

716
00:48:05,744 --> 00:48:07,714
That's why I said we should settle it with money,

717
00:48:07,714 --> 00:48:09,054
so we never see each other again.

718
00:48:09,684 --> 00:48:10,684
His heart.

719
00:48:11,114 --> 00:48:13,054
- Ji Hyuk, stop it. - Let go of me.

720
00:48:13,054 --> 00:48:15,954
Ji Hyuk, you should take it easy. Don't waste your strength on her.

721
00:48:16,054 --> 00:48:17,424
Ji Eun Oh, call the police.

722
00:48:17,554 --> 00:48:21,434
Wait, what? What did I do? I wanted to talk to my daughter.

723
00:48:21,534 --> 00:48:22,764
Who are you calling your daughter?

724
00:48:23,464 --> 00:48:25,264
Ji Eun Oh, call the police!

725
00:48:25,304 --> 00:48:26,464
- Ji Hyuk. - Let go of me!

726
00:48:27,034 --> 00:48:28,804
- Hey, you! - Ji Hyuk!

727
00:48:29,974 --> 00:48:31,874
- Hey! - Don't go.

728
00:49:10,244 --> 00:49:11,244
Eun Oh.

729
00:49:12,944 --> 00:49:13,944
Let go.

730
00:49:17,084 --> 00:49:18,084
See?

731
00:49:18,854 --> 00:49:20,554
You were lying.

732
00:49:21,654 --> 00:49:23,924
You do have feelings for me. This proves it!

733
00:49:25,664 --> 00:49:26,664
Ji Hyuk.

734
00:49:28,034 --> 00:49:29,034
Please, just...

735
00:49:29,834 --> 00:49:31,094
Can't you just stop?

736
00:49:32,834 --> 00:49:35,504
I told you I really don't care that you're sick.

737
00:49:57,394 --> 00:49:58,394
What do you think you're doing?

738
00:49:59,264 --> 00:50:00,264
Team Leader Ji Eun Oh.

739
00:50:02,394 --> 00:50:05,264
You always get formal like this when you're cornered.

740
00:50:06,234 --> 00:50:07,404
As if I'd fall for that.

741
00:50:08,634 --> 00:50:10,004
It was simply human indignation.

742
00:50:23,514 --> 00:50:24,784
I was right, wasn't I?

743
00:50:26,184 --> 00:50:27,624
His feelings for me haven't changed.

744
00:50:29,254 --> 00:50:30,554
I was right.

745
00:50:33,264 --> 00:50:34,564
You're happy about this?

746
00:50:35,834 --> 00:50:37,694
Even after that terrifying ordeal with that woman?

747
00:50:40,664 --> 00:50:41,674
But in return,

748
00:50:42,704 --> 00:50:44,534
I got to see how he really feels.

749
00:50:46,374 --> 00:50:47,374
So that's all that matters.

750
00:50:52,014 --> 00:50:53,014
Hey, Ji Hyuk.

751
00:50:53,614 --> 00:50:54,614
Seong Jae.

752
00:50:55,054 --> 00:50:56,814
Aren't you supposed to be protecting Eun Oh's family?

753
00:50:57,854 --> 00:51:00,254
They're being protected. Why?

754
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:03,494
That woman just stormed into Eun Oh's office.

755
00:51:04,194 --> 00:51:05,194
What?

756
00:51:08,464 --> 00:51:10,634
AP. Isn't this Ji Eun Oh's company?

757
00:51:11,134 --> 00:51:12,404

758
00:51:12,464 --> 00:51:16,974
(Shoe Joy, Shoealls)

759
00:51:17,034 --> 00:51:18,034
Yes?

760
00:51:18,804 --> 00:51:20,304
Yes, I just got the photo.

761
00:51:22,574 --> 00:51:23,844
Right. I'll handle it.

762
00:51:24,474 --> 00:51:25,484
Tell them not to worry.

763
00:51:26,144 --> 00:51:29,014
(Motel)

764
00:51:33,854 --> 00:51:35,224
Ji Eun Oh, that venomous cow!

765
00:51:37,194 --> 00:51:38,194
What do I do?

766
00:51:39,394 --> 00:51:40,394
What am I going to do now?

767
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:45,134
I need to think of something.

768
00:51:50,074 --> 00:51:51,944
(CEO Park Jin Seok)

769
00:51:52,004 --> 00:51:53,444
Leave Ji Eun Oh alone.

770
00:51:54,344 --> 00:51:55,374
Or you're dead.

771
00:52:09,754 --> 00:52:10,754
I see.

772
00:52:11,524 --> 00:52:12,524
Park Jin Seok.

773
00:52:14,864 --> 00:52:17,064
You're trying to back me completely into a corner,

774
00:52:17,594 --> 00:52:20,034
and make me get on my knees and beg.

775
00:52:23,334 --> 00:52:24,334
No way.

776
00:52:25,774 --> 00:52:28,974
If this is how you're going to play, I'll never beg you for anything.

777
00:52:32,714 --> 00:52:34,584
I won't come crawling back to you.

778
00:52:40,154 --> 00:52:42,394
- Welcome. - Hi.

779
00:52:49,864 --> 00:52:52,334
Mom, just pick out whichever one you like.

780
00:52:52,534 --> 00:52:56,004
They're all so beautiful.

781
00:52:56,004 --> 00:52:57,904
I don't know which one to choose.

782
00:52:57,904 --> 00:53:01,104
Just pick one you absolutely love, Ms. Jeong.

783
00:53:02,214 --> 00:53:06,784
Why did you bring me here? I need to prep for my grand opening.

784
00:53:07,284 --> 00:53:10,014
To buy you a pair as a gift for your restaurant's grand opening.

785
00:53:10,414 --> 00:53:11,924
Oh, really?

786
00:53:12,784 --> 00:53:16,294
If Mr. Ji is running around his own restaurant,

787
00:53:16,554 --> 00:53:18,024
he'll need comfortable shoes.

788
00:53:18,694 --> 00:53:20,894
(Shoealls)

789
00:53:23,364 --> 00:53:25,734
What do you think, Mom? They're so pretty.

790
00:53:29,474 --> 00:53:30,934
They're comfortable and light.

791
00:53:31,334 --> 00:53:34,504
- They'll be comfortable all day. - I see.

792
00:53:35,214 --> 00:53:36,874
I'll take these.

793
00:53:37,144 --> 00:53:38,144
Sure.

794
00:53:39,844 --> 00:53:41,954
In that case, I'll get these too. So Mom and I can match.

795
00:53:43,254 --> 00:53:47,284
Mom, you liked these earlier, right? We'll take these as well, please.

796
00:53:47,524 --> 00:53:49,854
Oh, no, that's okay, Eun Oh.

797
00:53:50,294 --> 00:53:52,794
It's because something really good happened to me today.

798
00:53:52,864 --> 00:53:56,734
- Goodness. - Then can I get another pair?

799
00:53:57,794 --> 00:54:00,564
Only if you do something for me.

800
00:54:15,084 --> 00:54:16,184
Hello, Ji Hyuk.

801
00:54:16,484 --> 00:54:19,324
- I'm Ji Gang Oh, Eun Oh's brother. - Ji Gang Oh?

802
00:54:19,924 --> 00:54:21,824
I want to ask you something,

803
00:54:21,824 --> 00:54:23,294
so I'm inviting you to my grand opening.

804
00:54:23,924 --> 00:54:26,594
Why is this kid inviting me?

805
00:54:31,464 --> 00:54:33,504
What excuse can I give for not going?

806
00:54:37,874 --> 00:54:38,904
This weekend?

807
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:43,114
I don't have anything planned. Why?

808
00:54:43,474 --> 00:54:47,014
Su Bin, then, let's go get some delicious beef.

809
00:54:47,584 --> 00:54:49,754
One of my juniors' younger brothers just opened a restaurant.

810
00:54:51,954 --> 00:54:54,684
When was the last time we went out just the two of us?

811
00:54:55,324 --> 00:54:56,324
Or is this a first?

812
00:54:57,454 --> 00:54:58,464
I guess so.

813
00:55:00,064 --> 00:55:01,264
This is the first time...

814
00:55:02,334 --> 00:55:03,334
since you went off to college.

815
00:55:03,834 --> 00:55:04,934
Lately, there have been more firsts...

816
00:55:05,604 --> 00:55:06,604
than I expected.

817
00:55:08,374 --> 00:55:14,604
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

818
00:55:19,584 --> 00:55:22,314
This place just opened yesterday? The line is pretty long.

819
00:55:22,614 --> 00:55:23,854
Looks like we'll have to wait a while.

820
00:55:24,614 --> 00:55:26,284
We have a table. Let's go.

821
00:55:26,884 --> 00:55:27,884
It's going to be so good.

822
00:55:28,394 --> 00:55:31,154
- With this current order... - It's three, I'm telling you!

823
00:55:31,224 --> 00:55:33,964
- No, I'm telling you it's five. - Mom, it's three!

824
00:55:34,024 --> 00:55:35,234
- No... - Ji Hyuk, you're here.

825
00:55:35,234 --> 00:55:37,134
- Goodness. Welcome. - Hello.

826
00:55:37,364 --> 00:55:39,904
Ji Hyuk, you made it!

827
00:55:40,504 --> 00:55:45,244
- Hey, this is my sister. - I remember you from high school.

828
00:55:45,444 --> 00:55:46,574
You've gotten even prettier.

829
00:55:47,274 --> 00:55:48,814
So you're the junior from my brother's club.

830
00:55:49,074 --> 00:55:50,214
I'm Lee Su Bin.

831
00:55:50,744 --> 00:55:53,284
Make sure your big brother buys you lots of meat.

832
00:55:54,584 --> 00:55:56,014
- Mom. - Let's go.

833
00:55:56,014 --> 00:55:58,584
- Double-check it properly. - I got it.

834
00:56:00,954 --> 00:56:02,554
Hey, Ji Hyuk.

835
00:56:05,764 --> 00:56:07,794
Come on. Su Bin, have a seat.

836
00:56:23,874 --> 00:56:25,484
Ji Hyuk said he was treating me to beef.

837
00:56:27,114 --> 00:56:28,114
Oh, really?

838
00:56:28,684 --> 00:56:30,684
I'm here for the grand opening of Eun Oh's brother's restaurant.

839
00:56:32,424 --> 00:56:35,624
Why are you guys being so awkward? I thought you said it was resolved.

840
00:56:37,854 --> 00:56:39,324
- It's not awkward. - It's not awkward.

841
00:56:40,224 --> 00:56:41,464
Oh, really?

842
00:56:46,304 --> 00:56:47,464
I'll do the ordering.

843
00:56:48,064 --> 00:56:49,974
I'm going to order one of everything.

844
00:56:55,074 --> 00:56:56,774
This is so good.

845
00:57:02,214 --> 00:57:04,884
- Ji Hyuk, do you need anything? - No, we're good.

846
00:57:05,554 --> 00:57:08,454
Hey, this tastes just like it does at your mother's restaurant.

847
00:57:09,524 --> 00:57:11,054
That's the seal of approval right there.

848
00:57:11,554 --> 00:57:15,064
- Don't forget why you started. - I'll take that to heart.

849
00:57:15,934 --> 00:57:18,734
- Gang Oh, I'm going to grab a bite. - Sure, go ahead.

850
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:23,704
Hey, you can't just eat off a customer's table.

851
00:57:24,234 --> 00:57:25,704
I'm just encouraging you to eat more.

852
00:57:30,274 --> 00:57:32,844
Here, Eun Oh. You have this first.

853
00:57:33,184 --> 00:57:34,984
Gosh. Thanks.

854
00:57:43,594 --> 00:57:46,294
Eun Oh, how do you and Seong Jae know each other?

855
00:57:47,594 --> 00:57:49,364
We go way back. We're friends.

856
00:57:52,034 --> 00:57:54,304
Did you also meet Seong Jae through my brother?

857
00:57:55,904 --> 00:57:56,904
Yes.

858
00:57:57,234 --> 00:57:59,174
Mr. Vice President, has it been over ten years now?

859
00:57:59,974 --> 00:58:01,004
Yes.

860
00:58:05,714 --> 00:58:06,714
Why?

861
00:58:10,284 --> 00:58:11,584
There's already someone I like.

862
00:58:11,784 --> 00:58:14,724
I've liked her for a long time. I've clearly said no,

863
00:58:15,224 --> 00:58:16,754
and I told you there's someone else.

864
00:58:16,894 --> 00:58:18,624
So that "friend" in the hospital...

865
00:58:18,624 --> 00:58:21,364
Is she the girl you had a crush on for years?

866
00:58:22,934 --> 00:58:25,304
Did I really say all that?

867
00:58:31,874 --> 00:58:33,544
So you two have known each other for over ten years.

868
00:58:38,844 --> 00:58:40,944
Ji Hyuk, try this. It's not too salty.

869
00:59:03,504 --> 00:59:07,444
- Eun Oh, can I speak with you? - Mom. You all go ahead and eat.

870
00:59:12,344 --> 00:59:14,484
Can you excuse me?

871
00:59:20,424 --> 00:59:22,424
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

872
00:59:28,394 --> 00:59:31,534
- Where's Ji Hyuk going? - I think he went to the restroom.

873
00:59:32,264 --> 00:59:34,434
But the restroom is inside.

874
00:59:48,284 --> 00:59:49,284
Ji Hyuk.

875
00:59:51,114 --> 00:59:52,124
Ji Hyuk!

876
00:59:56,594 --> 00:59:59,694
What... But she's not even fully recovered.

877
01:00:12,304 --> 01:00:13,374
Ji Eun Oh!

878
01:00:17,644 --> 01:00:20,414
You just had surgery. You shouldn't be running!

879
01:00:20,584 --> 01:00:23,314
You're always so quick to worry about me,

880
01:00:24,384 --> 01:00:25,754
so why won't you let me worry about you?

881
01:00:28,724 --> 01:00:29,724
Because you...

882
01:00:30,524 --> 01:00:33,464
- That wasn't some minor surgery. - But you're sick too.

883
01:00:38,164 --> 01:00:39,204
Fine.

884
01:00:41,734 --> 01:00:42,774
All right.

885
01:00:45,304 --> 01:00:47,974
So what is it you wanted to say to me?

886
01:00:51,914 --> 01:00:53,444
Even if it takes a year,

887
01:00:54,344 --> 01:00:56,554
three years, or even ten years,

888
01:00:58,284 --> 01:00:59,284
I...

889
01:01:00,524 --> 01:01:02,494
Until you're completely better,

890
01:01:03,094 --> 01:01:04,854
I can be by your side.

891
01:01:10,034 --> 01:01:11,064
You can't do that.

892
01:01:12,864 --> 01:01:14,234
Yes, I can.

893
01:01:18,374 --> 01:01:21,274
- You can't. - I'm telling you, I can!

894
01:01:22,274 --> 01:01:24,744
That's how much I love you.

895
01:01:25,274 --> 01:01:27,614
I've fallen for you all over again.

896
01:01:29,084 --> 01:01:31,514
But if you keep pushing me away like this...

897
01:01:33,354 --> 01:01:34,354
then I...

898
01:01:34,954 --> 01:01:36,754
have no choice but to wait.

899
01:01:38,924 --> 01:01:40,964
And that time is just too precious to waste.

900
01:01:46,834 --> 01:01:48,104
Too precious to waste?

901
01:01:49,404 --> 01:01:50,774
But I'm already out of time.

902
01:01:53,504 --> 01:01:55,004
Do you think I'm the kind of person...

903
01:01:55,344 --> 01:01:58,044
who'd pester you to go on dates while you're sick?

904
01:01:59,984 --> 01:02:01,214
Let's just...

905
01:02:02,914 --> 01:02:04,684
look at each other,

906
01:02:06,224 --> 01:02:07,754
and be by each other's side.

907
01:02:09,854 --> 01:02:11,354
That's what you did for me.

908
01:02:12,724 --> 01:02:14,464
Even when I misunderstood you,

909
01:02:15,294 --> 01:02:17,394
even when I said I hated you and treated you with contempt,

910
01:02:19,264 --> 01:02:20,764
you always pretended you were fine,

911
01:02:22,534 --> 01:02:24,404
always put me first,

912
01:02:25,334 --> 01:02:27,374
and always stayed by my side.

913
01:02:32,014 --> 01:02:33,014
You're right.

914
01:02:37,684 --> 01:02:39,054
I loved you,

915
01:02:42,124 --> 01:02:43,194
I love you now,

916
01:02:46,024 --> 01:02:47,424
and I want to be by your side.

917
01:02:54,334 --> 01:02:55,404
But...

918
01:03:00,804 --> 01:03:01,804
I can't.

919
01:03:03,944 --> 01:03:05,614
Ji Eun Oh, always so determined.

920
01:03:10,554 --> 01:03:11,614
You're really going to force me...

921
01:03:14,824 --> 01:03:17,194
to say the one thing I never wanted to say.

922
01:03:19,794 --> 01:03:20,794
Eun Oh.

923
01:03:23,494 --> 01:03:24,594
I'm not just...

924
01:03:28,534 --> 01:03:30,234
your average patient with heart failure.

925
01:03:43,454 --> 01:03:45,114
I'm a patient who needs...

926
01:03:46,654 --> 01:03:47,684
a heart transplant.

927
01:03:55,394 --> 01:03:56,664
Are you sure you're watching her properly?

928
01:03:57,964 --> 01:04:01,004
It doesn't make sense for her to be holed up in a motel for three days.

929
01:04:01,904 --> 01:04:05,234
Yes, sir. I've confirmed food deliveries. She's definitely inside.

930
01:04:06,674 --> 01:04:08,344
Really? All right, then.

931
01:04:16,354 --> 01:04:18,284
I can't get a read on her this time.

932
01:04:20,054 --> 01:04:21,884
Did I miscalculate?

933
01:04:28,264 --> 01:04:31,294
(Motel)

934
01:04:40,004 --> 01:04:42,174
All right, everyone. As we teased earlier,

935
01:04:42,344 --> 01:04:44,774
the star of our "This Will Shock You" segment...

936
01:04:45,174 --> 01:04:46,814
is right here next to me.

937

(Samun TV)

938
01:04:48,344 --> 01:04:53,224
She looks beautiful, like she's lived a charmed life, doesn't she?

939
01:04:53,824 --> 01:04:54,824
But you'd be wrong.

940
01:04:55,954 --> 01:04:57,494
She's someone who desperately needs help...

941
01:04:57,554 --> 01:04:59,264
from me and all of you.

942
01:05:00,964 --> 01:05:02,164
Please, go ahead.

943
01:05:06,404 --> 01:05:07,404
Hello, everyone.

944
01:05:07,464 --> 01:05:08,634
(Samun TV)

945
01:05:08,704 --> 01:05:11,204
My name is Ko Seong Hui.

946
01:05:11,934 --> 01:05:14,744
I am the wife of Chairman Park Jin Seok...

947
01:05:15,444 --> 01:05:16,774
of the Shoe Joy Group.

948
01:05:56,254 --> 01:05:59,184
(Our Golden Days)

949
01:05:59,384 --> 01:06:01,224
How can someone be so vile?

950
01:06:01,284 --> 01:06:03,854
You were really raised by a monster, weren't you?

951
01:06:04,024 --> 01:06:07,624
You'll meet someone wonderful one day. I'll pray for you.

952
01:06:07,694 --> 01:06:08,864
After all, I'm just...

953
01:06:08,864 --> 01:06:10,034
your best friend's little sister to you now.

954
01:06:10,094 --> 01:06:13,464
Why are you being so reckless? Father, you're just like her.

955
01:06:13,604 --> 01:06:16,174
I didn't see this coming. Ko Seong Hui...

956
01:06:16,274 --> 01:06:17,734
- That's so like you. - This is unbelievable.

957
01:06:17,874 --> 01:06:22,444
You pushed me this far. You thought I couldn't beat you?

958
01:06:22,544 --> 01:06:25,414
Goodbye, Park Jin Seok. It's over.

959
01:06:25,514 --> 01:06:27,114
While I still have time,

960
01:06:27,344 --> 01:06:30,214
can't we go back to being colleagues so it won't be so hard to see you?

961
01:06:30,514 --> 01:06:34,124
Eun Oh. Please, just leave me be.
