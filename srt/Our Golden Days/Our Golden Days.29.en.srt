00:00:01,359 --> 00:00:03,429
(Episode 29)

2
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:04,669
What...

3
00:00:06,229 --> 00:00:08,039
What did you want to say?

4
00:00:08,439 --> 00:00:10,299
You took the compatibility test for a liver transplant.

5
00:00:11,139 --> 00:00:13,239
She might have only looked for you because she needs a match.

6
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:17,379
Are you questioning my birth mother?

7
00:00:18,649 --> 00:00:20,549
You never thought any of this was strange?

8
00:00:22,049 --> 00:00:23,149
No, I didn't.

9
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:25,289
Because we met by pure coincidence.

10
00:00:30,259 --> 00:00:33,129
Diabetes. It's hypoglycaemic shock. Please help me.

11
00:00:33,529 --> 00:00:35,259
Before I met her as a client,

12
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:38,469
we had already met in a way that left no room to doubt her.

13
00:00:38,529 --> 00:00:40,569
- Not me. Oh, there she is. - She asked Su Jeong...

14
00:00:40,629 --> 00:00:42,999
- That's Eun Oh. - who the portfolio designer was.

15
00:00:43,069 --> 00:00:45,209
- By any chance... - And the subway too.

16
00:00:45,839 --> 00:00:48,909
I was returning from a client's home,

17
00:00:48,909 --> 00:00:50,639
and she got off the subway first.

18
00:00:50,779 --> 00:00:53,249
If she were following you, she could easily arrange that.

19
00:00:54,779 --> 00:00:55,979
That's ridiculous.

20
00:00:56,449 --> 00:00:59,649
If she'd found me, she'd have said, "I'm your birth mother."

21
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:03,159
How many months has it been since I first met her?

22
00:01:03,389 --> 00:01:05,959
People say it's not a coincidence when it keeps happening.

23
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:08,999
Stop overreacting.

24
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:10,959
Eun Oh.

25
00:01:11,629 --> 00:01:13,699
You're too trusting.

26
00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:15,639
You trusted me, didn't you?

27
00:01:16,139 --> 00:01:19,309
You liked me because you saw me as some righteous, upstanding guy.

28
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:21,809
But was I really that kind of person?

29
00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:23,579
I wasn't, was I?

30
00:01:25,949 --> 00:01:27,149
That's why I'm telling you to be skeptical.

31
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:30,379
It's the liver transplant that I can't get past.

32
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:39,259
Fine.

33
00:01:39,559 --> 00:01:41,899
That's because you're the calculating one.

34
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,529
Of course, you'd be suspicious.

35
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:51,539
She is someone I've come to trust and care for.

36
00:01:52,809 --> 00:01:54,069
Don't you dare talk about her like that.

37
00:01:54,839 --> 00:01:55,839
What?

38
00:01:56,379 --> 00:01:57,379
Her birth...

39
00:01:59,709 --> 00:02:02,249
- She found her birth mother? - I said, drop it.

40
00:02:06,249 --> 00:02:07,249
(Team Manager's Office)

41
00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:22,399
Unbelievable.

42
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:25,769
You have to admit that he has a point.

43
00:02:32,449 --> 00:02:33,809
(Director Ko Seong Hui)

44
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:36,249
You didn't have to do it,

45
00:02:36,249 --> 00:02:38,449
so thank you so much for getting tested.

46
00:02:39,089 --> 00:02:42,389
Maybe fate brought us together now so I'd have someone to lean on.

47
00:02:43,059 --> 00:02:44,059
See?

48
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:48,059
She feels so guilty that she can't even bring herself...

49
00:02:48,129 --> 00:02:49,829
to ask if I actually took the test.

50
00:02:56,499 --> 00:02:57,939
Dad, congratulations.

51
00:02:58,309 --> 00:03:00,209
I hear most people fail it a few times.

52
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:05,249
I knew he'd pass. When your father sets his mind to it, he's stubborn.

53
00:03:05,679 --> 00:03:07,049
He was a good student, too.

54
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:11,289
I didn't think an arts major would pass on his first try.

55
00:03:11,349 --> 00:03:14,919
Come on. I told you I'd pass on the first try, didn't I?

56
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:18,129
You sound like you're humble bragging, Dad.

57
00:03:19,389 --> 00:03:22,359
You should've told me earlier! I would've cooked a special dinner.

58
00:03:22,429 --> 00:03:25,829
That's exactly why I waited until after dinner to say anything.

59
00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:27,799
Mother. Honey.

60
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:30,369
I am now a certified electrical technician.

61
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:33,239
I can even get a job with this certification.

62
00:03:34,539 --> 00:03:35,539
I'm home.

63
00:03:35,909 --> 00:03:37,309
- Hey. - Everyone's here.

64
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:39,279
I have something to tell you all...

65
00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:41,819
Ji Hyuk. Your dad passed his practical exam.

66
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:42,879
The one that's so hard to pass.

67
00:03:43,119 --> 00:03:45,989
Why are you making such a big deal? Goodness.

68
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:48,359
- You passed? - I did.

69
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:51,189
I heard the electrician practical was tough to pass on the first try.

70
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:54,799
It is. But it all depends on the effort you put in.

71
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:56,859
Congratulations.

72
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:58,729
Yes, thanks.

73
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:02,639
I have some news, too.

74
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:04,769
What is it?

75
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:06,809
Is something wrong at work?

76
00:04:07,469 --> 00:04:09,879
No, Mom. It's not bad news.

77
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,379
Dad already knew about this, but...

78
00:04:13,609 --> 00:04:16,219
I'm acquiring the company, AP.

79
00:04:17,179 --> 00:04:18,389
An acquisition?

80
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:22,819
Hey, what are you talking about? Even I've heard of AP.

81
00:04:24,059 --> 00:04:26,759
You're acquiring AP?

82
00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:29,559
But you said you'd given up on it not too long ago.

83
00:04:30,129 --> 00:04:31,259
I got lucky.

84
00:04:31,869 --> 00:04:33,729
Ji Hyuk, you didn't say a word all this time...

85
00:04:34,499 --> 00:04:36,539
You knew about this and didn't tell me?

86
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:40,539
What was I supposed to say? He's the one who didn't mention it.

87
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:45,179
What's all this commotion? Can someone explain what's going on?

88
00:04:45,349 --> 00:04:46,349
Ji Hyuk.

89
00:04:47,109 --> 00:04:48,149
Is this it?

90
00:04:48,679 --> 00:04:49,679
Yes.

91
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:52,319
This is amazing! Grandma,

92
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:56,919
it means Ji Hyuk is the president of this company. And it's huge!

93
00:04:56,989 --> 00:04:58,329
My goodness.

94
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:01,129
- What is she talking about? - That's incredible.

95
00:05:01,499 --> 00:05:02,829
I can't believe he acquired AP.

96
00:05:03,159 --> 00:05:05,369
Hey, come on. I'm not telling you this to brag.

97
00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:08,139
This is a huge change for me,

98
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:12,269
so I wanted to let my family know. I'll have to work my butt off now.

99
00:05:13,969 --> 00:05:15,039
My goodness.

100
00:05:20,649 --> 00:05:22,849
So you're blown away by what Ji Hyuk can do.

101
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:26,149
You're drinking to calm your nerves and to celebrate.

102
00:05:27,289 --> 00:05:28,289
That's right.

103
00:05:29,159 --> 00:05:32,089
With you breezing through your certification exam too.

104
00:05:32,589 --> 00:05:33,889
How can you two, a father-son duo,

105
00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:37,059
always skip steps 1 and 2 and jump straight to 3?

106
00:05:37,999 --> 00:05:41,539
That kid didn't just skip steps. He went straight for the prize.

107
00:05:42,499 --> 00:05:43,499
You've got a point.

108
00:05:44,239 --> 00:05:45,239
But still,

109
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:48,179
on the very day his father passes his practical exam,

110
00:05:48,679 --> 00:05:51,279
he completely steals your thunder with even bigger news.

111
00:05:53,309 --> 00:05:56,119
He said he only had half the investment funds.

112
00:05:56,949 --> 00:05:59,989
Somehow, he persuaded the chairman. Can you believe that?

113
00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:02,789
I think that's pretty incredible in itself.

114
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,559
Sure, I pushed for it myself, but he got rejected at first.

115
00:06:08,059 --> 00:06:09,429
But he pulled off the acquisition.

116
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:12,369
What that means is, that kid...

117
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:15,339
pushed it all the way to the final bid.

118
00:06:15,969 --> 00:06:17,469
That's what amazed me.

119
00:06:17,969 --> 00:06:19,839
Honestly, I still can't believe it.

120
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,479
We liberal arts majors just aren't built that way.

121
00:06:24,809 --> 00:06:27,049
Man, does that take nerve or what?

122
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:31,719
Come to think of it, I guess I never really...

123
00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:34,149
knew my own son.

124
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:37,559
You never know what's going on inside your own kid's head.

125
00:06:38,289 --> 00:06:42,659
So from his point of view, seeing me slaving away at my job,

126
00:06:42,829 --> 00:06:46,329
just struggling to get by on a fixed salary...

127
00:06:47,629 --> 00:06:49,369
I must have looked so pathetic to him.

128
00:06:49,869 --> 00:06:51,369
You're taking it too far, Sang Cheol.

129
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:56,079
Everyone's built differently. Both then and now,

130
00:06:56,609 --> 00:06:58,579
we've been hanging on for dear life too, right?

131
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:03,249
To think a guy that capable ended up in a marriage like that...

132
00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:07,989
But in the end, that too...

133
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:10,719
I guess that was my fault too.

134
00:07:20,299 --> 00:07:21,469
It looks like you've had a drink.

135
00:07:22,499 --> 00:07:23,939
I've had a couple, kid.

136
00:07:24,499 --> 00:07:27,009
- Get some rest. - It was thanks to your advice, Dad.

137
00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:29,509
You're the one who told me to go see the chairman.

138
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:32,209
That?

139
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:33,809
Right. That's why they say...

140
00:07:34,109 --> 00:07:37,219
it pays to listen to your elders.

141
00:07:38,149 --> 00:07:39,219
Thank you.

142
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:41,559
For helping me see it through without regret.

143
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:47,129
You think it all worked out just because of something I said?

144
00:07:47,789 --> 00:07:51,029
Anyway, that was all you. You're the one who did it.

145
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:06,609
Won't it be too late if you go after Seong Jae finishes work?

146
00:08:08,549 --> 00:08:11,119
That's why I told Mom I'd be home by 1am or 2am.

147
00:08:12,149 --> 00:08:14,819
I told Mom I was going with you, so don't forget.

148
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:16,819
Got it.

149
00:08:17,689 --> 00:08:21,389
But what if Seong Jae's not into you after your date today?

150
00:08:23,799 --> 00:08:24,999
He won't be.

151
00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:27,399
Are you giving up already?

152
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,999
Then why all this trouble today?

153
00:08:31,369 --> 00:08:32,569
Because I had to do this.

154
00:08:33,239 --> 00:08:34,339
You wouldn't understand.

155
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:38,479
Nobody understands how I feel.

156
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:45,519
- Ji Hyuk, hurry and eat. - You know I don't eat breakfast.

157
00:08:45,819 --> 00:08:49,159
Ji Hyuk, when's your inauguration? The whole family is going, right?

158
00:08:49,319 --> 00:08:51,629
I'm not having one. It'll be virtual.

159
00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:54,829
Hey, why no inauguration? Aren't you the president now?

160
00:08:54,929 --> 00:08:57,699
I barely managed the acquisition. I don't want to make a fuss.

161
00:08:58,269 --> 00:08:59,799
First, I need to learn the company inside out.

162
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:01,999
- I'm heading out now. - Ji Hyuk.

163
00:09:02,699 --> 00:09:06,139
We're having a farewell dinner for your grandfather tomorrow.

164
00:09:06,609 --> 00:09:08,339
Will you be able to make it?

165
00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:11,749
Of course. It's for Grandfather's send-off.

166
00:09:12,049 --> 00:09:13,849
Good. That's a relief.

167
00:09:14,579 --> 00:09:17,279
But I don't think I'll make it home tonight.

168
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,589
I have a lot of documents to review.

169
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:20,889
- I'm off. - Okay.

170
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:23,089
My goodness.

171
00:09:23,319 --> 00:09:24,719
Have a good day.

172
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:27,459
Why is everyone standing up just because Ji Hyuk is leaving?

173
00:09:29,059 --> 00:09:30,059
I know, right?

174
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:34,129
What do you mean? Ji Hyuk is the CEO now, isn't he?

175
00:09:34,369 --> 00:09:37,269
I saw on those TV shows. When someone like that leaves,

176
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:39,539

Lee Dong Ha from Neiro Webtoons?

355
00:22:10,019 --> 00:22:13,589
Am I speaking with Freedom, the creator of "Take My Heart?"

356
00:22:13,729 --> 00:22:16,259
Freedom... Yes.

357
00:22:17,199 --> 00:22:19,829
You must know of the great response you've been getting.

358
00:22:19,899 --> 00:22:23,139
So, I'd like to offer you an official serialization.

359
00:22:23,269 --> 00:22:24,599
An offer for a series?

360
00:22:26,769 --> 00:22:30,039
Right. I understand what you're proposing.

361
00:22:30,509 --> 00:22:34,049
I'll call you back later. Okay.

362
00:22:36,219 --> 00:22:37,749
Ji Wan. What was that about?

363
00:22:38,219 --> 00:22:39,319
Hey, this is huge.

364
00:22:40,019 --> 00:22:45,289
Neiro wants to sign "Take My Heart" for an official series.

365
00:22:46,429 --> 00:22:47,589
What does that mean?

366
00:22:48,259 --> 00:22:51,459
I uploaded it to the Free Comics section,

367
00:22:51,459 --> 00:22:52,929
where anyone can post.

368
00:22:53,169 --> 00:22:56,739
This call means we're getting moved to the Official Webtoon Category.

369
00:22:56,969 --> 00:22:59,109
You're going to be a real webtoon artist!

370
00:22:59,469 --> 00:23:02,809
No! If my mom finds out, I'm dead.

371
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:04,109
Look, Yeong Ra.

372
00:23:04,439 --> 00:23:08,409
We'll put the contract in my name, and all you have to do is draw.

373
00:23:08,879 --> 00:23:12,789
Basically, you'd be like a ghostwriter.

374
00:23:13,749 --> 00:23:14,819
Ghostwriter?

375
00:23:14,889 --> 00:23:19,759
Hey, I'm not going to rip you off. I'll give you all the money, okay?

376
00:23:22,329 --> 00:23:24,259
I need some time to think about it.

377
00:23:24,729 --> 00:23:28,029
How long? An hour or two?

378
00:23:28,129 --> 00:23:29,139
Three hours?

379
00:23:29,439 --> 00:23:30,439
Four?

380
00:23:31,239 --> 00:23:33,209
I think I'll need about a day.

381
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:37,879
Seriously, you'd be a total fool to miss this chance!

382
00:23:39,249 --> 00:23:40,579
Can't I even have a day to think?

383
00:23:41,849 --> 00:23:45,679
Hey, don't bring your car today. And change into something casual.

384
00:23:45,779 --> 00:23:48,619
- Why do I have to leave my car? - Hey!

385
00:23:48,689 --> 00:23:49,689
Hey, you startled me!

386
00:23:51,959 --> 00:23:52,959
And what's with this car?

387
00:23:53,589 --> 00:23:54,659
Get in.

388
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:06,569
Wait, are we going camping?

389
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:09,909
You guessed it. Our date today is a camping trip.

390
00:24:11,579 --> 00:24:13,549
Where are we going? If we leave now, when will we get back?

391
00:24:13,779 --> 00:24:15,749
I told my mom I'd be home by 2am.

392
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,089
Camping? Man, there's a first for everything.

393
00:24:21,019 --> 00:24:23,289
Where did you get all this stuff? Did you buy them?

394
00:24:23,659 --> 00:24:24,759
I borrowed them from a friend.

395
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:26,759
My friend, Ha Jun, is a huge camping fanatic.

396
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:29,699
Ha Jun? That sounds like a guy's name.

397
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:32,529
Yes. Come on, we're running late. Buckle up.

398
00:24:32,829 --> 00:24:34,569
- Here we go. - Wait, hang on!

399
00:24:34,899 --> 00:24:36,099
Are you saying you're going to drive?

400
00:24:38,869 --> 00:24:40,809
- Let's go. - Hey, wait.

401
00:24:42,339 --> 00:24:43,339
Here I go.

402
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:54,249
Wait, no. Do you even know how to drive?

403
00:24:55,789 --> 00:24:58,159
I got my license as soon as I became an adult,

404
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,389
and my big brother was a strict teacher.

405
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:02,159
How many years ago was that?

406
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:04,359
So you're basically a rusty driver, aren't you?

407
00:25:04,529 --> 00:25:07,199
I've had a clean driving record for six years.

408
00:25:08,329 --> 00:25:11,469
Driving opens up more part-time jobs with better pay.

409
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:14,409
In college, I drove company cars as a photo shoot assistant...

410
00:25:14,409 --> 00:25:15,979
and for online shops.

411
00:25:16,479 --> 00:25:20,149
Wow, a good driver and so resourceful.

412
00:25:22,049 --> 00:25:24,049
When did the kid with the runny nose grow up so much?

413
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,649
- Will you forget my runny nose? - Why would I forget that?

414
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:30,519
It's such a sweet memory.

415
00:25:31,259 --> 00:25:32,959
He calls a runny nose a sweet memory.

416
00:25:33,429 --> 00:25:36,559
If he still sees me that way, then this really is the end.

417
00:25:37,229 --> 00:25:39,599
No, don't think like that.

418
00:25:39,899 --> 00:25:42,669
I decided to just enjoy this moment as much as possible.

419
00:25:44,569 --> 00:25:45,569
Should I put on some upbeat music?

420
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:54,279
You act like I've been living under a rock.

421
00:25:54,979 --> 00:25:57,849
I thought you only ate meat that other people grilled for you.

422
00:25:59,049 --> 00:26:01,289
Kiddo, I'm friends with your brother, Ji Hyuk.

423
00:26:01,619 --> 00:26:03,589
Do you think he'd grill anything for me?

424
00:26:03,589 --> 00:26:05,219
He only ever bossed me around.

425
00:26:05,289 --> 00:26:06,459
Lee Ji Hyuk, that punk!

426
00:26:07,789 --> 00:26:09,459
No talking about my oldest brother.

427
00:26:13,569 --> 00:26:15,069
- Hey. - Yes?

428
00:26:15,529 --> 00:26:17,699
Look here. One, two, three!

429
00:26:19,539 --> 00:26:20,539
The obligatory camping photo.

430
00:26:23,109 --> 00:26:24,139
This is cooked.

431
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:27,949
Here, have a bite.

432
00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:30,219
Here.

433
00:26:35,289 --> 00:26:36,319
It's delicious.

434
00:26:37,489 --> 00:26:39,289
Hey. You've got something on your face.

435
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:57,279
What?

436
00:26:57,739 --> 00:26:58,739
Never mind.

437
00:27:02,449 --> 00:27:03,449
What is it?

438
00:27:05,349 --> 00:27:07,849
- Is there something on my face? - No.

439
00:27:08,149 --> 00:27:11,759
Come on! What is it?

440
00:27:12,289 --> 00:27:13,729
All right. Sorry.

441
00:27:14,729 --> 00:27:15,759
Let me get it for you.

442
00:27:16,629 --> 00:27:17,629
There.

443
00:27:39,989 --> 00:27:40,989
It's burning.

444
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:51,559
This is delicious.

445
00:27:55,769 --> 00:27:56,769
What?

446
00:27:56,899 --> 00:27:59,569
This is why barbecuing is a must on camping trips.

447
00:28:00,909 --> 00:28:03,479
You must've gone camping a lot. With your exes?

448
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:06,779
No, I mostly went camping with Ha Jun and my friends.

449
00:28:07,849 --> 00:28:11,849
But you know what the best part of camping really is?

450
00:28:26,129 --> 00:28:28,169
I've never seen that look on her face before.

451
00:28:29,899 --> 00:28:30,899
Done.

452
00:28:32,569 --> 00:28:33,569
Here, Seong Jae.

453
00:28:35,709 --> 00:28:38,479
Look at you, working so hard to feed this amateur.

454
00:28:44,649 --> 00:28:45,649
How is it?

455
00:28:47,789 --> 00:28:50,319
Wow, this is so sweet! Delicious!

456
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:51,619
- I know, right? - Yes.

457
00:28:57,159 --> 00:29:00,929
This must be a first for Chief Director Park Seong Jae.

458
00:29:01,899 --> 00:29:03,069
That's true.

459
00:29:05,269 --> 00:29:07,139
By the way, I'm no longer the Chief Director.

460
00:29:07,669 --> 00:29:09,039
I was promoted to Vice President.

461
00:29:10,179 --> 00:29:12,809
- Vice President? - It's just a title.

462
00:29:14,049 --> 00:29:16,919
Why are you just telling me now? I would've bought you a cake.

463
00:29:17,779 --> 00:29:19,589
It's not really something to celebrate.

464
00:29:20,949 --> 00:29:21,949
Why not?

465
00:29:22,619 --> 00:29:25,389
Life is pretty cruel.

466
00:29:26,289 --> 00:29:29,499
When I had a goal and craved power, I was just a Chief Director.

467
00:29:30,099 --> 00:29:32,629
But now that I've lost that goal, I'm the VP.

468
00:29:34,029 --> 00:29:35,529
What do you mean?

469
00:29:36,129 --> 00:29:38,969
There's already someone I like. I've liked her for a long time.

470
00:29:39,739 --> 00:29:41,339
Is he talking about her?

471
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:43,939
Does he still like her?

472
00:29:45,209 --> 00:29:47,209
So you're unhappy about the promotion?

473
00:29:48,709 --> 00:29:50,019
I wouldn't say that.

474
00:29:50,719 --> 00:29:52,919
Somewhere along the way, work actually became pretty fun.

475
00:30:04,029 --> 00:30:05,129
It's raining.

476
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:09,169
Oh, seriously? It's raining? Hey, get up.

477
00:30:16,109 --> 00:30:18,039
We're really doing it all today.

478
00:30:18,309 --> 00:30:20,179
Staring into the fire, and now staring at the rain.

479
00:30:21,949 --> 00:30:23,319
The rain is so beautiful.

480
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,259
So, tell me.

481
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,999
Jinhwa Group wants to organise an engagement ceremony.

482
00:30:37,999 --> 00:30:39,229
That's huge news, isn't it?

483
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:41,529
What? Already?

484
00:30:42,329 --> 00:30:46,369
- Yeong Ra. Were you going so fast? - No...

485
00:30:46,439 --> 00:30:49,339
You know how kids are these days.

486
00:30:49,539 --> 00:30:52,309
You act like it's still our generation.

487
00:30:53,049 --> 00:30:57,749
No, it's just... I never thought she would fall in love so fast.

488
00:30:58,249 --> 00:30:59,279
Yeong Ra.

489
00:31:02,219 --> 00:31:04,389
Stop. You're embarrassing her.

490
00:31:04,789 --> 00:31:05,889
If she's so embarrassed,

491
00:31:05,889 --> 00:31:07,389
why the talk of an engagement already?

492
00:31:08,029 --> 00:31:11,859
- My goodness. - It's with Jinhwa Pharmaceuticals.

493
00:31:13,229 --> 00:31:17,339
The Jinhwa family is more than a good enough match for Yeong Ra.

494
00:31:19,469 --> 00:31:21,739
I wanted Seong Jae to marry first,

495
00:31:21,739 --> 00:31:23,739
but you're in love, so what can I do?

496
00:31:25,139 --> 00:31:27,809
So, when are they suggesting for the engagement ceremony?

497
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:33,719
Oh, what do I do?

498
00:31:41,929 --> 00:31:43,799
(Manager Lee Ji Wan)

499
00:31:48,229 --> 00:31:50,169
It's no use telling Ji Wan about this.

500
00:31:52,199 --> 00:31:54,309
Gosh, what do I do?

501
00:32:01,209 --> 00:32:04,679
- Back up your car! - This is Inspector Nam.

502
00:32:04,949 --> 00:32:06,019
Yes, I'm here now...

503
00:32:06,019 --> 00:32:08,289
There's a landslide up ahead. You can't get through.

504
00:32:08,349 --> 00:32:11,359
- Move your cars back. - Yes, requesting equipment backup.

505
00:32:13,959 --> 00:32:16,129
- Yes. - Hi, there's been a landslide.

506
00:32:16,129 --> 00:32:17,559
You can't get through up ahead.

507
00:32:18,259 --> 00:32:19,429
But isn't there another way?

508
00:32:19,529 --> 00:32:24,099
No, this is the only road in or out. It won't be cleared until morning.

509
00:32:25,869 --> 00:32:27,339
I see. Thank you.

510
00:32:27,409 --> 00:32:29,039
- Sorry about that. - Yes, okay.

511
00:32:29,109 --> 00:32:30,279
You'll have to back your car up.

512
00:32:31,739 --> 00:32:33,779
Oh, man. What are we going to do?

513
00:32:34,249 --> 00:32:37,049
I'm so sorry. You have to work tomorrow.

514
00:32:37,979 --> 00:32:39,119
Should we try walking?

515
00:32:42,389 --> 00:32:44,289
In this heavy rain?

516
00:32:46,859 --> 00:32:48,829
Well, grab on.

517
00:32:55,999 --> 00:32:58,869
Su Bin, we're low on gas,

518
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,369
so we can't run the heater all night.

519
00:33:02,339 --> 00:33:05,139
You're right. I meant to fill up on the way home.

520
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:06,409
I'm so sorry.

521
00:33:07,109 --> 00:33:11,119
Hey, it's not your fault. We'd have gas without the accident.

522
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:13,889
Just cover up with that blanket and get some sleep.

523
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:18,859
- What about you? - I'll be fine. Go on, sleep.

524
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:21,189
Roll up the window. It's getting cold.

525
00:33:26,499 --> 00:33:27,829
Come on, roll it up. Hurry.

526
00:33:28,929 --> 00:33:31,469
All the way up.

527
00:33:54,789 --> 00:33:55,929
Gosh, my leg.

528
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:27,389
You must be cold.

529
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:32,099
- No, forget it. You'll be cold. - Don't worry. I'm fine.

530
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:33,799
The cold doesn't bother me anyway.

531
00:34:35,529 --> 00:34:38,539
Then at least sleep back here. There's plenty of room.

532
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:45,939
No, I'm fine.

533
00:34:48,849 --> 00:34:50,279
I'm not trying to make a move on you.

534
00:34:51,849 --> 00:34:55,849
- I meant we could share warmth. - No, I...

535
00:34:57,859 --> 00:34:59,019
Just go to sleep.

536
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:22,049
I'm sorry.

537
00:35:22,509 --> 00:35:24,349
For bringing you all the way out here.

538
00:35:26,989 --> 00:35:29,089
But why aren't you even mad?

539
00:35:30,889 --> 00:35:34,289
What's there to be mad about? I actually had fun.

540
00:35:37,099 --> 00:35:38,259
Really?

541
00:35:38,799 --> 00:35:40,199
Going through all this trouble?

542
00:35:42,269 --> 00:35:43,339
You'd think so.

543
00:35:44,169 --> 00:35:47,109
When I'm with you, all sorts of crazy things happen.

544
00:35:48,469 --> 00:35:50,009
You're a total troublemaker.

545
00:37:20,499 --> 00:37:21,499
It's warm.

546
00:38:20,759 --> 00:38:21,759
This is...

547
00:38:23,129 --> 00:38:24,259
I mean...

548
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:32,339
Oh, well...

549
00:38:32,969 --> 00:38:33,969
What time is it?

550
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:37,239
I'm just going to step out for a minute.

551
00:38:56,729 --> 00:38:58,199
It was so warm.

552
00:39:00,269 --> 00:39:02,299
Su Bin. Let's get going.

553
00:39:02,829 --> 00:39:04,299
- What? - We can get out of here now.

554
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:07,109
Let's go. Grab your stuff. Come on.

555
00:39:08,009 --> 00:39:09,009
- Okay. - Come on.

556
00:39:15,379 --> 00:39:18,279
Su Bin, what time does your mom usually get up?

557
00:39:18,679 --> 00:39:20,889
- Around 7am? - At 7am?

558
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:24,259
Shoot, we have to get there before then.

559
00:39:25,689 --> 00:39:27,489
Hey, slow down a bit.

560
00:39:27,659 --> 00:39:30,729
No, I can't. I'm dead if Ji Hyuk catches us.

561
00:39:51,849 --> 00:39:52,979
Okay, get out. Quick.

562
00:40:01,289 --> 00:40:02,729
You can sneak in without getting caught, right?

563
00:40:09,929 --> 00:40:10,939
What about the car?

564
00:40:12,069 --> 00:40:13,069
I'll leave it in the public lot.

565
00:40:13,469 --> 00:40:14,669
I'll leave the key on top of the back tire.

566
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:16,839
Hurry and get inside.

567
00:40:17,409 --> 00:40:18,409
Wait.

568
00:40:21,209 --> 00:40:22,209
What?

569
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:25,919
This was our third date.

570
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:31,459
So, what's your answer?

571
00:40:34,329 --> 00:40:35,329
Oh, that...

572
00:40:39,099 --> 00:40:40,969
What do you think? It's a no, obviously.

573
00:40:47,469 --> 00:40:49,769
Look, I told you before. Nothing's changed.

574
00:40:51,739 --> 00:40:55,409
Still, it was fun while it lasted, Lee Su Bin.

575
00:40:56,679 --> 00:40:57,679
All right.

576
00:40:59,319 --> 00:41:02,119
Hurry inside. If Ji Hyuk wakes up, things will get messy.

577
00:41:03,589 --> 00:41:04,889
Is that what you're so worried about?

578
00:41:05,919 --> 00:41:07,029
Don't worry.

579
00:41:07,389 --> 00:41:10,089
Even if I get caught, I won't say I spent the night with you.

580
00:41:10,629 --> 00:41:11,829
I wouldn't tell them if my life depended on it.

581
00:41:12,229 --> 00:41:13,229
So don't you worry.

582
00:41:17,569 --> 00:41:18,569
Right.

583
00:41:19,869 --> 00:41:20,869
Go on inside.

584
00:41:59,209 --> 00:42:01,809
Fine, I get it. I'll forget about it.

585
00:42:02,549 --> 00:42:03,879
If you're that sure it's a no,

586
00:42:04,519 --> 00:42:06,719
I won't push it anymore.

587
00:42:20,469 --> 00:42:21,969
I got in safe and sound without getting caught.

588
00:42:24,739 --> 00:42:26,499
Gosh, what a terrible way to end things.

589
00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:34,079
Su Bin.

590
00:42:34,809 --> 00:42:37,719
Thank you for everything you've done for me.

591
00:42:39,319 --> 00:42:40,319
I really mean it.

592
00:42:41,989 --> 00:42:44,389
But after we started dating, I realised something.

593
00:42:45,419 --> 00:42:46,419
You're...

594
00:42:47,259 --> 00:42:48,789
You're way too good for me.

595
00:42:50,459 --> 00:42:52,259
My family is the textbook example of a dysfunctional rich family.

596
00:42:52,929 --> 00:42:55,099
I can't even date or marry who I want.

597
00:42:56,369 --> 00:42:58,539
If my father even found out that you dated me,

598
00:42:59,439 --> 00:43:02,539
he's the type who would go on an absolute rampage.

599
00:43:03,309 --> 00:43:05,179
I don't want you to get hurt like that.

600
00:43:05,979 --> 00:43:09,349
I want you to meet a great guy and stay as cheerful as you are now.

601
00:43:09,909 --> 00:43:11,749
That's what I wanted to say.

602
00:43:13,449 --> 00:43:15,049
I wanted to let her go on good terms.

603
00:43:16,549 --> 00:43:18,419
But instead, I pushed her away without any real closure...

604
00:43:19,189 --> 00:43:20,189
and rushed her out.

605
00:43:44,679 --> 00:43:46,719
- My goodness! - Oh, gosh!

606
00:43:47,689 --> 00:43:50,149
So, choose. Is it me or Ji Eun Oh?

607
00:43:51,819 --> 00:43:52,819
It's Eun Oh.

608
00:43:53,929 --> 00:43:54,989
My daughter.

609
00:43:56,059 --> 00:43:57,059
Your big sister.

610
00:44:00,259 --> 00:44:01,269
I can't.

611
00:44:02,699 --> 00:44:03,769
I just can't do it.

612
00:44:09,139 --> 00:44:10,139
I'm sorry.

613
00:44:11,779 --> 00:44:12,939
I'm so sorry, but...

614
00:44:15,379 --> 00:44:17,119
I can't go through with the liver transplant.

615
00:44:26,889 --> 00:44:27,889
A surprise party?

616
00:44:29,229 --> 00:44:31,399
Do you think Eun Oh would accept if she knew it was from me?

617
00:44:31,959 --> 00:44:34,399
That's true, but...

618
00:44:34,469 --> 00:44:37,099
Do you think Eun Oh's in the mood for that?

619
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:38,939
That's all the more reason we have to do it.

620
00:44:39,369 --> 00:44:41,539
Eun Oh has spent her whole life thinking tomorrow is her birthday.

621
00:44:41,869 --> 00:44:43,039
We have to remind her of that.

622
00:44:43,939 --> 00:44:46,179
"Ji Eun Oh, your current mother is your real mom."

623
00:44:46,539 --> 00:44:47,649
"Your birthday is tomorrow."

624
00:44:49,349 --> 00:44:51,279
We have to make her forget about the transplant.

625
00:44:52,549 --> 00:44:53,989
You're right. Absolutely.

626
00:44:54,849 --> 00:44:56,489
That's a brilliant idea.

627
00:44:57,589 --> 00:45:00,629
- Really? Okay, great. - Okay.

628
00:45:03,629 --> 00:45:05,329
I don't believe that's a good idea.

629
00:45:06,529 --> 00:45:07,529
What? Excuse me?

630
00:45:08,869 --> 00:45:09,969
Cheol Min.

631
00:45:13,739 --> 00:45:14,739
Cheol Min.

632
00:45:16,609 --> 00:45:19,109
What did you say? You don't think it's a good idea?

633
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:24,249
- That's right. - Cheol Min, you're capable, but...

634
00:45:24,479 --> 00:45:26,249
Do you know you have a knack for getting under people's skin?

635
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:28,519
I do?

636
00:45:30,249 --> 00:45:32,389
You look like you've just returned from a race for love.

637
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:35,489
What the... Are you stalking me or something?

638
00:45:35,759 --> 00:45:37,159
Or do you have a bad habit of jumping to conclusions?

639
00:45:38,929 --> 00:45:39,959
With your resume,

640
00:45:40,399 --> 00:45:42,869
- it was strange you joined us. - No, sir.

641
00:45:43,729 --> 00:45:45,339
I'm not a strange person, Mr. Lee.

642
00:45:45,969 --> 00:45:48,269
I have merely...

643
00:45:48,739 --> 00:45:51,609
inherited blood that's just different from others.

644
00:45:51,939 --> 00:45:52,939
Now, you're being even weirder.

645
00:45:54,309 --> 00:45:59,319
I'm about to tell you something. But my telling you this...

646
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:02,119
cannot be used as grounds for my dismissal.

647
00:46:06,189 --> 00:46:08,289
This place is a perfect match for me.

648
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:10,799
This company is going to succeed, and my salary will go up.

649
00:46:10,899 --> 00:46:12,299
I have no intention of ever quitting.

650
00:46:14,129 --> 00:46:15,429
Would you listen to this guy? What?

651
00:46:15,829 --> 00:46:18,469
Even the way you're talking now is bizarre.

652
00:46:19,769 --> 00:46:20,769
That is because I...

653
00:46:24,139 --> 00:46:26,679
I come from a long line of male shamans.

654
00:46:28,349 --> 00:46:31,019
- You were a shaman? - No, absolutely not.

655
00:46:32,249 --> 00:46:34,819
Thanks to my grandfather's prayers, I avoided divine possession,

656
00:46:36,149 --> 00:46:37,459
and I just have to live a quiet life.

657
00:46:38,689 --> 00:46:40,859
- But you're not quiet, are you? - That's...

658
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:46,159
some foresight that just appears around people I get good vibes from.

659
00:46:48,069 --> 00:46:49,929
That's what you could call it.

660
00:46:51,139 --> 00:46:52,669
Seriously? A guy with foresight...

661
00:46:52,939 --> 00:46:54,769
is telling me a birthday party is a bad idea?

662
00:46:56,169 --> 00:46:57,909
You're good at your job, so I can't even fire you.

663
00:46:58,639 --> 00:47:01,009
Just watch what you say around the office.

664
00:47:02,449 --> 00:47:03,449
You may go.

665
00:47:09,619 --> 00:47:10,619
(CEO's Office)

666
00:47:12,989 --> 00:47:15,189
He really shouldn't throw her a birthday party tomorrow.

667
00:47:21,699 --> 00:47:23,939
- Mother, can you taste this for me? - Sure.

668
00:47:29,709 --> 00:47:32,209
The braised ribs came out great.

669
00:47:33,579 --> 00:47:36,379
My father loved spicy braised ribs more than anything.

670
00:47:37,979 --> 00:47:41,089
But I rarely made it for him, even just a few times a year.

671
00:47:42,249 --> 00:47:43,819
That's how it is for everyone.

672
00:47:44,389 --> 00:47:48,529
Everyone has regrets when their parents are gone.

673
00:47:48,689 --> 00:47:51,759
After I got married, until the day my father passed away,

674
00:47:52,059 --> 00:47:53,529
I didn't even get to visit him ten times.

675
00:47:54,469 --> 00:47:58,599
I was busy caring for my husband, since he was always sick or hurt.

676
00:48:00,399 --> 00:48:02,469
You must have had a lot of regrets too.

677
00:48:03,909 --> 00:48:04,979
These braised ribs...

678
00:48:05,709 --> 00:48:08,409
What's it called? Right, "recipe."

679
00:48:08,409 --> 00:48:10,109
Write it down and give it to your sister-in-law.

680
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:13,049
But it's not the same as making it for him myself.

681
00:48:14,549 --> 00:48:15,589
That's what I'm saying.

682
00:48:16,189 --> 00:48:19,119
Everyone feels their own loss the most.

683
00:48:21,459 --> 00:48:24,129
Mother, why are you being so philosophical today?

684
00:48:24,199 --> 00:48:25,199
That's me, the wise sage!

685
00:48:25,959 --> 00:48:27,399
How can you be laughing right now?

686
00:48:28,769 --> 00:48:31,739
Your mother has me crying one moment and laughing the next.

687
00:48:32,369 --> 00:48:34,339
- I'm home. - He's here.

688
00:48:34,409 --> 00:48:36,339
- He's here. - I ran into Grandpa on the way,

689
00:48:36,339 --> 00:48:37,639
- Yes. - so we came together.

690
00:48:41,349 --> 00:48:42,349
Hey.

691
00:48:42,779 --> 00:48:46,549
Mom, have a drink too. You can handle one beer, can't you?

692
00:48:47,279 --> 00:48:48,819
What? One beer?

693
00:48:49,319 --> 00:48:51,689
My goodness, these kids have no idea what their mother can handle.

694
00:48:52,959 --> 00:48:55,129
Back when this guy was courting her,

695
00:48:55,759 --> 00:48:58,529
she came home passed out on his back several times.

696
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:00,769
Dad!

697
00:49:02,029 --> 00:49:04,969
I was about ready to kill Sang Cheol.

698
00:49:05,539 --> 00:49:09,409
How dare that punk even think about doing that to my precious daughter?

699
00:49:09,469 --> 00:49:12,109
Father, it's not like I forced her to drink.

700
00:49:12,279 --> 00:49:14,449
We got into an argument. Then she got all worked up...

701
00:49:14,449 --> 00:49:16,649
and just started chugging drink after drink.

702
00:49:17,549 --> 00:49:18,849
Mom, you were chugging drinks?

703
00:49:19,949 --> 00:49:22,049
Grandpa, I guess Mom was a bit of a rebel.

704
00:49:22,419 --> 00:49:25,359
My goodness, is there any child who's never rebellious?

705
00:49:25,719 --> 00:49:27,359
There's no such thing in this world.

706
00:49:28,359 --> 00:49:30,529
But still, when it comes to Da Jeong,

707
00:49:30,729 --> 00:49:33,699
I'm just grateful she's my daughter.

708
00:49:35,169 --> 00:49:36,169
Dad.

709
00:49:37,739 --> 00:49:40,469
And for my part, being Sang Cheol's mother...

710
00:49:41,339 --> 00:49:42,539
has been a true joy.

711
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:46,809
What? You're going to make me cry.

712
00:49:47,509 --> 00:49:49,249
Do moms and dads really think like this?

713
00:49:51,579 --> 00:49:52,579
Father.

714
00:49:53,479 --> 00:49:54,719
Once I'm back on my feet,

715
00:49:55,549 --> 00:49:56,889
with Da Jeong by my side,

716
00:49:57,219 --> 00:50:00,119
I'll come visit you with some ice-cold makgeolli.

717
00:50:01,689 --> 00:50:03,559
All right, you do that.

718
00:50:04,259 --> 00:50:06,459
Hey, our makgeolli is getting warm.

719
00:50:06,759 --> 00:50:08,829
- Let's have a toast first. - Okay.

720
00:50:08,899 --> 00:50:11,169
- Grandpa, you do the honours. - Yes.

721
00:50:11,169 --> 00:50:13,139
- All right. - Here.

722
00:50:13,139 --> 00:50:15,769
Here's to all of us, and for everything!

723
00:50:15,909 --> 00:50:18,109
- Cheers! - Cheers!

724
00:50:28,719 --> 00:50:30,189
My, this is the life.

725
00:50:35,089 --> 00:50:38,829
- Happy birthday, dear Eun Oh - Happy birthday, dear Eun Oh

726
00:50:39,099 --> 00:50:42,269
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

727
00:50:51,039 --> 00:50:53,379
Seriously, Mom, what is all this?

728
00:50:53,939 --> 00:50:56,679
Rice cake balls, shrimp tempura, and even lasagna.

729
00:50:57,279 --> 00:50:58,849
Dumplings, tteokbokki...

730
00:50:59,549 --> 00:51:02,319
This is all the stuff she used to make for your birthday parties.

731
00:51:02,389 --> 00:51:03,389
Your favourites.

732
00:51:04,089 --> 00:51:07,159
Yes. It made me super popular with all my friends.

733
00:51:08,129 --> 00:51:11,699
But why make all these dishes from back then all of a sudden?

734
00:51:11,759 --> 00:51:13,229
And why go all out like this?

735
00:51:14,229 --> 00:51:15,999
Because I don't know when you might leave.

736
00:51:18,539 --> 00:51:20,499
What's that supposed to mean?

737
00:51:20,969 --> 00:51:23,809
You said you were thinking of getting married, remember?

738
00:51:25,039 --> 00:51:26,309
Even if it's not marriage,

739
00:51:27,109 --> 00:51:29,209
I know all kids eventually leave the nest.

740
00:51:30,509 --> 00:51:32,879
But Mom, are you crying just thinking of it?

741
00:51:33,249 --> 00:51:34,319
I guess I am.

742
00:51:37,289 --> 00:51:40,889
I'll still be in Korea. It's not like I'm actually leaving.

743
00:51:41,129 --> 00:51:42,129
So, can I eat now?

744
00:51:43,089 --> 00:51:46,899
Yes, of course. Go ahead and eat. Eun Oh, you should eat too. Eat up.

745
00:51:56,769 --> 00:51:58,509
Ta-da!

746
00:51:59,809 --> 00:52:03,279
Mom, what's all this?

747
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:04,779
They're your birthday presents.

748
00:52:06,179 --> 00:52:07,179
Go on. Open them.

749
00:52:08,289 --> 00:52:09,619
These all look like designer brands.

750
00:52:10,449 --> 00:52:11,789
Hurry up and open them!

751
00:52:25,139 --> 00:52:26,139
Mom.

752
00:52:26,739 --> 00:52:30,009
I bought them with the Recipe Reward I got from HQ.

753
00:52:31,209 --> 00:52:33,709
I've never been able to buy you anything nice before.

754
00:52:35,349 --> 00:52:39,119
Mom, why are you being like this? I don't need any of this.

755
00:52:41,419 --> 00:52:43,189
Give me the receipts. I'm going to return them.

756
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:45,889
Why would you return them?

757
00:52:46,619 --> 00:52:48,959
What? Are you trying to make a fool of me?

758
00:52:49,729 --> 00:52:52,799
I bought these with the money I earned from my recipe.

759
00:52:52,799 --> 00:52:54,629
What right do you have to return these?

760
00:52:55,429 --> 00:52:58,769
It's my first time giving you a proper gift as an adult.

761
00:53:00,569 --> 00:53:03,469
Mom, before Dad's business failed,

762
00:53:03,709 --> 00:53:08,109
I always wore the prettiest clothes and the nicest shoes in my class.

763
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:10,409
You bought me so many things.

764
00:53:10,849 --> 00:53:12,649
And when was that?

765
00:53:13,149 --> 00:53:15,549
That was only until you were a freshman in high school.

766
00:53:16,289 --> 00:53:18,719
I got you nothing in your 20s, when you were at your prettiest.

767
00:53:18,989 --> 00:53:22,489
You scrimped and saved to help the family.

768
00:53:22,889 --> 00:53:24,699
And you even used your money to help me open my restaurant.

769
00:53:27,669 --> 00:53:30,729
But Mom, I really don't need any of this.

770
00:53:31,769 --> 00:53:33,599
Why do you equate expensive with good?

771
00:53:34,609 --> 00:53:37,139
Don't you have more faith in your own daughter?

772
00:53:48,349 --> 00:53:52,089
You raised me well, so I can make any clothes look good.

773
00:53:53,589 --> 00:53:55,529
I could wear anything,

774
00:53:55,889 --> 00:53:58,199
and my friends would always ask if I got it from a department store.

775
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:02,499
"Because you raised me well," she says.

776
00:54:03,699 --> 00:54:05,069
And I didn't give birth to her.

777
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:13,539
Mom, are you crying?

778
00:54:13,939 --> 00:54:14,949
No.

779
00:54:15,809 --> 00:54:20,619
The tears just well up sometimes. That's menopause for you.

780
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:26,889
Oh, dear. What am I going to do with you?

781
00:54:30,129 --> 00:54:32,129
(Mom's Car)

782
00:54:33,029 --> 00:54:34,029
What do you want for lunch?

783
00:54:35,929 --> 00:54:37,229
You're still staring at that?

784
00:54:39,899 --> 00:54:42,939
Hey, isn't it your parents' anniversary today?

785
00:54:43,669 --> 00:54:45,509
I guess that's why she's been home all day.

786
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:47,479
That's right.

787
00:54:47,979 --> 00:54:48,979
You've got a lot on your mind.

788
00:54:51,179 --> 00:54:54,279
But why do you keep checking Director Ko's location?

789
00:54:55,519 --> 00:54:56,519
Is something bothering you?

790
00:54:58,719 --> 00:55:00,619
- It's nothing. - It's clearly not nothing.

791
00:55:01,059 --> 00:55:03,329
You're clearly worried. Come on, tell me.

792
00:55:04,399 --> 00:55:07,159
There's no point in telling you. I already know what you'll say.

793
00:55:07,299 --> 00:55:10,529
Why? Did she set a wedding date for you or something?

794
00:55:11,299 --> 00:55:15,469
What? Why would you even bring up marriage?

795
00:55:16,469 --> 00:55:20,039
Then what's wrong?

796
00:55:20,879 --> 00:55:23,879
Do you really think Director Ko is having an affair?

797
00:55:26,979 --> 00:55:28,289
That's part of it, but...

798
00:55:29,389 --> 00:55:30,549
I don't really know.

799
00:55:31,389 --> 00:55:33,319
I just feel like I need to know...

800
00:55:33,959 --> 00:55:35,359
what my mom is doing...

801
00:55:36,689 --> 00:55:37,899
and what she's up to.

802
00:55:45,039 --> 00:55:46,769
Still no word from her.

803
00:55:47,669 --> 00:55:49,669
You're making things difficult, Eun Oh.

804
00:56:00,679 --> 00:56:03,089
I told you we should at least go to Singapore this year.

805
00:56:03,549 --> 00:56:07,889
With our kids' situation, no. Once the kids are settled,

806
00:56:08,189 --> 00:56:11,059
you can take me on a cruise without a care in the world.

807
00:56:11,129 --> 00:56:12,129
All right.

808
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:13,799
How about for our 30th anniversary?

809
00:56:14,529 --> 00:56:17,029
You should look forward to it. Our 30th will be the real deal.

810
00:56:18,739 --> 00:56:19,899
For our tenth anniversary,

811
00:56:19,899 --> 00:56:21,539
you got me that apartment in Apgujeong,

812
00:56:21,669 --> 00:56:23,909
and for our 20th, the building in Sinsa-dong.

813
00:56:24,309 --> 00:56:25,409
Honey, after all that...

814
00:56:25,409 --> 00:56:28,749
You're setting my expectations high by telling me to look forward to it.

815
00:56:29,109 --> 00:56:30,509
Set them as high as you want.

816
00:56:32,579 --> 00:56:36,119
What's the point? You just donate all the money you make from them...

817
00:56:36,349 --> 00:56:37,989
instead of spending it on yourself.

818
00:56:38,859 --> 00:56:41,989
But on my birthday, our anniversary, and every Christmas...

819
00:56:42,059 --> 00:56:46,159
Do you know how much jewellery and how many handbags you've bought me?

820
00:56:46,359 --> 00:56:48,499
You've made it so I don't have to buy anything for myself.

821
00:56:50,299 --> 00:56:52,539
But for women, isn't more better?

822
00:56:52,539 --> 00:56:55,139
I've heard some even have designer bags in every colour.

823
00:56:55,869 --> 00:56:58,109
A bag is just a bag.

824
00:56:58,479 --> 00:57:02,409
If your bag costs a fortune, is it filled with happiness too?

825
00:57:03,079 --> 00:57:05,449
It's so hard to find happiness as it is.

826
00:57:10,119 --> 00:57:11,189
(Ms. Shin)

827
00:57:11,289 --> 00:57:12,919
Ji Eun Oh hasn't left the office yet.

828
00:57:15,389 --> 00:57:17,759
Ji Eun Oh is really starting to get on my nerves.

829
00:57:33,739 --> 00:57:35,009
Is anyone here?

830
00:57:36,579 --> 00:57:37,979
I think a fuse blew.

831
00:57:41,389 --> 00:57:42,489
Did everyone go home?

832
00:57:50,959 --> 00:57:54,199
- Happy birthday to you - To you

833
00:57:54,729 --> 00:57:58,099
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

834
00:57:58,369 --> 00:58:02,169
Happy birthday, dear Eun Oh

835
00:58:02,239 --> 00:58:05,879
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

836
00:58:06,939 --> 00:58:08,009
Happy birthday.

837
00:58:10,349 --> 00:58:11,479
Make a wish and blow out the candles.

838
00:58:22,859 --> 00:58:26,299
- What are you doing at the office? - It's an employee perk.

839
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:28,829
Starting today, birthday cakes are on the company.

840
00:58:37,269 --> 00:58:40,009
Ji Eun Oh is having a birthday party at the office.

841
00:58:40,909 --> 00:58:44,279
So she's having a birthday party at the office?

842
00:58:50,349 --> 00:58:52,189
- Honey. - Yes.

843
00:58:59,559 --> 00:59:00,959
This wine is really good tonight.

844
00:59:04,899 --> 00:59:06,299
Why the sudden rush?

845
00:59:10,069 --> 00:59:11,139
You.

846
00:59:12,639 --> 00:59:14,679
An employee is going in with some alcohol.

847
00:59:15,649 --> 00:59:17,679
So, you're going to have some fun on your birthday?

848
00:59:18,719 --> 00:59:20,319
I bet you're going to have a few drinks.

849
00:59:21,319 --> 00:59:23,419
I just feel like drinking tonight.

850
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:26,019
How much?

851
00:59:32,359 --> 00:59:35,029
Honey. Tonight, let's...

852
00:59:35,799 --> 00:59:39,669
- drink this wine like soju. - What's gotten into you?

853
00:59:40,769 --> 00:59:42,169
This wine is just so good tonight.

854
00:59:43,769 --> 00:59:44,779
It is, isn't it?

855
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:47,609
I'm usually a lightweight with wine, but this is going down so smoothly.

856
00:59:49,509 --> 00:59:51,449
- Bottoms up. - What?

857
00:59:53,179 --> 00:59:55,519
I love how you can be so unpredictable.

858
01:00:00,789 --> 01:00:01,789
Bottoms up.

859
01:00:08,929 --> 01:00:09,929
Oh, dear.

860
01:00:12,369 --> 01:00:14,569
It's okay. You can go. I won't need anything else.

861
01:01:43,689 --> 01:01:44,799
Director Ko?

862
01:01:51,769 --> 01:01:54,169
Is something wrong?

863
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:04,679
Yu Ra.

864
01:02:05,749 --> 01:02:06,879
I can't bring myself...

865
01:02:08,019 --> 01:02:09,789
to ask you to be a liver donor.

866
01:02:11,989 --> 01:02:12,989
But...

867
01:02:14,019 --> 01:02:15,959
I can't just let my son die either.

868
01:02:18,459 --> 01:02:20,529
Why did you have to be a match?

869
01:02:21,329 --> 01:02:23,399
Why did we have to meet at a time like this?

870
01:02:25,839 --> 01:02:27,039
Why did I...

871
01:02:28,139 --> 01:02:30,709
tell you that your birth parents might be missing you?

872
01:02:32,379 --> 01:02:33,709
If it weren't for me,

873
01:02:35,009 --> 01:02:37,009
you wouldn't be going through all this pain.

874
01:02:42,919 --> 01:02:44,019
But still...

875
01:02:45,389 --> 01:02:47,059
If you save your brother,

876
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:50,829
the three of us can make up for all the lost time.

877
01:02:51,389 --> 01:02:52,659
Let's live together.

878
01:02:54,329 --> 01:02:55,769
What else matters?

879
01:02:57,499 --> 01:02:58,899
I'll walk away from everything.

880
01:03:03,209 --> 01:03:04,469
Come live with me, Eun Oh.

881
01:03:53,019 --> 01:03:55,959
(Our Golden Days)

882
01:03:56,089 --> 01:03:57,689
Have you been out working somewhere?

883
01:03:57,759 --> 01:04:00,029
Quit right now. How much money do you need?

884
01:04:00,099 --> 01:04:02,429
- I'll cover it all. - You want us to tail someone?

885
01:04:02,499 --> 01:04:04,969
No way... Is my mom pregnant?

886
01:04:05,339 --> 01:04:07,069
Becoming the Chairman of Shoe Joy.

887
01:04:07,339 --> 01:04:10,169
That's your duty and how you can repay me.

888
01:04:10,409 --> 01:04:13,079
Eun Oh, please, you can't do this. This is just wrong.

889
01:04:13,139 --> 01:04:14,679
You came to steal my Eun Oh's liver, didn't you?

890
01:04:15,049 --> 01:04:16,609
You're a monster!

891
01:04:17,049 --> 01:04:18,109
Please, no.

892
01:04:18,519 --> 01:04:19,949
I will save my brother.

893
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:23,849
So, can I go ahead and schedule the surgery?
