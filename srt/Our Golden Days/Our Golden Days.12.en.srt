00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,440
(Episode 12)

2
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:14,520
What was that, Eun Oh?

3
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,190
What are you doing?

4
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,500
Why did you...

5
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,770
pick up my stuff
then put it down again?

6
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,700
I put it back
because it wasn't mine.

7
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,110
You're so nasty.

8
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,040
Don't look at it,

9
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,040
but if you did, put it on the table.

10
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,010
I'm sorry for peeking
without permission.

11
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,520
So you were going to go out
and pretend to come back in?

12
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,730
Do you have to show
that you notice everything?

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Clean up so I can open the cafe.

14
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,570
Wait.

15
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,600
Why did you come straight here?

16
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,440
Shouldn't you be at your Mapo site?

17
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:09,940
That site's closed for the day.

18
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,380
Why? Did something go wrong?

19
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,580
The head engineer's mother-in-law
passed away,

20
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:16,710
and the burial is scheduled
for today.

21
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,480
We'll do everything
with the electric wiring tomorrow.

22
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:21,790
You can do that?

23
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,760
What are they working on?

24
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:27,030
You talk too much for someone...

25
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,590
who just woke up in the cafe.

26
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,930
I was up until 7 a.m.
When did I fall asleep?

27
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:44,110
You shouldn't have let her know
you were working at the cafe.

28
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,610
How dare you doze off out there?

29
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,060
Here you are.

30
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,900
What's that noise?

31
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,200
Something hard to believe.

32
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,440
(Men's Restroom)

33
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,340
Ji Hyuk, is it a special day?

34
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,640
I'm pitching to investors today.

35
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:20,980
I see.

36
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,550
Thanks for wishing me luck.

37
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,290
Was he always that thick-faced?

38
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,790
He was like that sometimes.

39
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,660
The restroom.

40
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,100
It's completely dry.

41
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:48,640
It is.

42
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,380
We thought he showered at a sauna.

43
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,680
Was he trying this hard
to save money?

44
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,880
I wondered why
our water bill had gone up.

45
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,020
Goodness.

46
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:04,560
You're a bit surprised, aren't you?

47
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:07,930
Yes.

48
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,200
I think I misunderstood him
in a way.

49
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,530
How so?

50
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:32,150
As you can see, from 2020 to 2025,

51
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,290
DIY interior design
was gradually on the rise.

52
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:39,390
There are just two reasons for that.

53
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,630
Cost and individuality.

54
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,730
It's cheaper than using
turnkey interior design services.

55
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,770
In return, you must do all the work.

56
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:50,900
You can decorate your space...

57
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,240
as you want,
without anyone's interference.

58
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,610
However,
there's a problem with that.

59
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,940
Doing your own interior design
takes research.

60
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,180
But however hard you study,

61
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,320
your work won't be
as meticulous as an expert's.

62
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,780
Here's an example.

63
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,220
Cost and individuality.

64
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,920
Millennial and Gen Z designers
value both,

65
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:15,230
yet they struggle to find work
in the failing economy.

66
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,560
A new job as a coordinator...

67
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,430
overseeing
the DIY interior process...

68
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,470
is an alluring opportunity
for all of them.

consumers and providers,

improving the outcome
of your DIY interior project.

72
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,240
As you can see,

73
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,680
it's the first matching platform...

74
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,110
that lets you do
whatever you want with your space.

(Chief Director Park Seong Jae)

76
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,450
Yes.

77
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:41,790
You found it?

78
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,160
Thanks.

79
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,960
You don't need to know.

80
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:53,900
Oh, really?

81
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,200
When is that?

82
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,510
How did...

83
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,880
Where are you going?

84
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,290
The first client wants to see me.

85
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,120
It looks like
things didn't go well for Ji Hyuk.

86
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,630
Your first try rarely works out
when you have no experience.

(Coordinator Inquiries)

88
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,240
Who is this person?

89
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,950
Why do they keep posting?

90
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,720
How come you always come together?

91
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:49,020
My Yeong Ra won't do as she's told.

92
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:52,120
I told her to take a friend,
but she cares too much about me.

93
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,530
Youngyu Construction's
chairman's wife was here,

94
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:58,130
and she envied you
when I told her about you.

95
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,970
Oh, she doesn't have a daughter,
does she?

96
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,730
Just three sons, right?

97
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,770
The key's in the car.

98
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,580
Bye.

99
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,250
Drive her safely.

100
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:17,620
Sure.

101
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,230
The door. Open it.

102
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,220
Yeong Ra. Why don't you eat lunch
with your mother?

103
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,490
Because I brought a packed lunch.

104
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,960
But it's 12:10 p.m. right now.

105
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,490
You and your mom
got a massage together,

106
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,860
and it ended at lunchtime.
Shouldn't you eat together?

107
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,570
- You must eat your packed lunch?
- Yes.

108
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,540
Why?

109
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,370
Because I brought it with me.

110
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,170
Yes, that packed lunch too.

111
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:17,040
Why do you always bring
packed lunch and dinner?

112
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:20,550
If it's to avoid your stalker,

113
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,180
I'll escort you.

114
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:23,450
Let's eat out.

115
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,280
No. I always eat a packed lunch.

116
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,220
Always, every day?

117
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,450
Yes.

118
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,460
To watch my health.

119
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:36,430
Do you have some kind of illness?

120
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,700
No. I'm perfectly healthy.

121
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:43,530
Then it's even weirder.

122
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,000
What must you watch...

123
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,640
that you don't even eat out
with your mom?

124
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:51,010
I guess my mom had lunch plans.

125
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,110
You don't know for sure?

126
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:58,150
She isn't obligated
to tell me everything.

127
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,050
Do you eat your packed lunch
when you meet friends too?

128
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,160
You must eat out with them.

129
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,630
I don't see my friends.

130
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,160
Why not? You don't have any?

131
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,470
I lost them all.

132
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:15,530
Your friends?

133
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,600
How is that possible?

134
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,970
Not everyone needs friends.

135
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,540
I see.

136
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,550
When you said
the definition of a friend differed,

137
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,380
did you mean you had none?

138
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,720
You become unproductive
when you're with friends.

139
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:37,020
You eat and talk about nonsense.

140
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,090
Goodness.

141
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,730
Park Yeong Ra.
Have you ever been to a club?

142
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,330
Why would I go there?

143
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:50,370
Have you been
to an amusement park with a friend?

144
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,270
I went with my parents.

145
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:53,540
What about the Jarasum Festival?

146
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,870
Why would I go there?

147
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,510
Have you been
to a concert or a musical?

148
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,810
I go with my mom.

149
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,780
Have you seen the Yeouido fireworks?

150
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:01,980
The Hangang Park?

151
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,150
What about Seongsu-dong?

152
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,650
Have you ever played a claw machine?

153
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,780
Have you tried coin karaoke?

154
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:08,150
Did you take sticker photos
with your friends?

155
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,520
Ever been to Hongdae?

156
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,090
You've been to
an escape room, right?

157
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,320
What about a board game cafe?

158
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:17,260
I get it. You haven't been to
or done any of that.

159
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,630
My gosh. What kind of life is that?

160
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,640
What is it like?

161
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:34,150
Sorry. I'll stop asking questions.

162
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,220
From what I heard,

163
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,720
you chose the gallery
to host the exhibition.

164
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,160
Yes.

165
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,230
I owe it to you.

166
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:52,330
I only gave you a few suggestions.

167
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:56,230
The director of that gallery
doesn't host just anyone.

168
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,740
Good for you.

169
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,500
I'll do anything for my daughter.

170
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,180
I guess you asked to see me
about her, then.

171
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,580
What is it?

172
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,010
Well...

173
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:10,950
There's a list of VIPs...

174
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,780
I'd like to invite
to Yeong Ra's exhibition.

175
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:16,790
It's just a wish list of mine.

176
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,090
Do you think...

177
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:23,330
you could go over it for me?

(VIP Guest List)

179
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,000
Could you tell me...

180
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:32,470
which of those people
are interested in art?

181
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,910
You're really something, Madam Ko.

182
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,010
It looks like
this is a list of people...

183
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,910
you want to invite,

184
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:44,850
and you want me
to contact them for you.

185
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:50,320
That just shows
how much I trust you.

186
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:53,690
You're such a sweet-talker.

187
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,800
Do you think you could help?

188
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:05,600
(Interpreting
"Innate Rhythm of Rose")

189
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,360
What can I do?

190
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,200
I can't stop thinking about it.

191
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:36,570
Actually,

192
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,000
I saw this kitchen photo
ten days ago,

193
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,640
but I hesitated
because it would cost a lot.

194
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,970
I will live in this house
for at least ten years, after all.

195
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:46,010
The kitchen is important, you know.

196
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:51,380
So, are you saying you want
to replace the countertop...

197
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:54,750
and change the cupboard
to this style?

198
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:58,920
But that would cost a fortune.

199
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,690
You know the kitchen furniture
is already in production, right?

200
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:02,860
I know.

201
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,530
My husband said he'd divorce me
if I didn't change them.

202
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,800
What?

203
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,400
Every night, I kept saying,

204
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,270
"I should've done this."

205
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,840
I complained while lying in bed.

206
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,110
He doesn't want to hear it
for ten years.

207
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,280
I'm regretting my choice now.

208
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:22,050
If you are willing to pay the cost,

209
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,480
I can do that for you.

210
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,920
But what about moving?

211
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,720
We can keep our stuff in storage...

212
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,420
and stay at my parents' house.

213
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,090
Okay. I get it.

214
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,530
Please send me
the kitchen sketch you made.

215
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:37,630
I will make a drawing.

216
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,800
I'm so sorry, and thank you.

217
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,470
At first,
I thought it would be okay...

218
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,500
to just go with something cheaper
since it was new,

219
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,610
but I realized that I'd regret it
for at least ten years,

220
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,510
so I decided to change it.

221
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,240
You're right.

222
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:55,380
The kitchen is an important space
in the house.

223
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,980
It's a DIY interior design,
but the details are exquisite.

224
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:01,120
I know, right?

225
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,250
These are the photos
of my house under construction.

226
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,290
The coordinator
is absolutely amazing.

227
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,390
You were lucky
to meet a good coordinator,

228
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,990
but that's the company's policy.

229
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,130
That's true.

230
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:12,560
The CEO also has
a really great mindset.

231
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,930
(The coordinator
is absolutely amazing.)

232
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,740
Eun Oh did a great job.

233
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:25,410
I need you for my first client.

234
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,880
I'll pay 20,000 dollars.

235
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,180
You're offering 20,000?

236
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,320
The results
of the pitching presentation...

237
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,120
will be decided within 3 to 4 days,
or no later than a week.

238
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:38,420
They said the angel investment
could be decided on the same day.

239
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:45,430
It will work.

240
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,370
Instead of taking out
a secured car loan,

241
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:51,570
I'll get an investment
and pay her with my money.

242
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,510
Who is it?

243
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,880
We have an issue
regarding our first client.

244
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,520
Please come in.

245
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,050
No, it's simple.

246
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:10,790
The client wants to replace
all the kitchen furniture.

247
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,120
From the design to the materials.

248
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:15,460
That will delay
the construction schedule.

249
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,330
It will take at least a week.

250
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:20,760
She said she'd cover
all the existing furniture costs.

251
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,400
She also said
she could even put off the move.

252
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,200
Does it work for you?

253
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:25,800
Yes.

254
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:28,310
I have some previous designs,

255
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,540
so it'll just require
a little more work.

256
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,540
Then, we will have to add
the design fee.

257
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,950
You take care of it.

258
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,050
All right.

259
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,620
A week?

260
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,990
Why is everything going so smoothly?

261
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,700
Welcome.

262
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,800
Hi.

263
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,970
Where is Mamdaerozip's office?

264
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,510
Well...

265
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:06,410
Over there.

266
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,690
You know
Hyunmyeong Apartment, right?

267
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:17,050
It is currently under construction.

268
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,890
We are the representatives...

269
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:22,130
of Buildings 1, 2, 5, 7, and 8
of Hyunmyeong Apartment.

270
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,560
I see.

271
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:29,830
By the way,
the office is quite small.

272
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,500
We can have a group meeting
at the cafe.

273
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,700
Let's go out.

274
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,640
Don't you know what group buying is?

275
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,640
I do.

276
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:41,150
So, the people who are interested
in DIY interior design...

277
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,710
There are 29 households.

278
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,820
Only in Buildings 1, 2, 5, 7, and 8.

279
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,950
Are you sure we pay
all the material and labor costs?

280
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,220
We also get to make choices.

281
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,650
You can purchase the materials
yourselves.

282
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,520
We can just calculate
the quantity you need.

283
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,060
So, since this is like group buying,

284
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,800
can you offer a discount
on the coordinator fees?

285
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,300
How about 30 percent?

286
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,230
I'm afraid I can't do that.

287
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,000
What? Listen.

288
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,600
We have 29 households
who are interested for now.

289
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,910
If things go well,

290
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,770
there will be many more.

291
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,940
Our apartment buildings
are 38 years old.

292
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,850
You shouldn't view
coordinators' skills as a commodity.

293
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,220
They are all experts
in the interior design industry.

294
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,020
How about 20 percent?

295
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,550
Not even one percent.

296
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,120
If you don't want to pay
the coordinators,

297
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,590
you can do
the interior design yourself.

298
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,990
There are many
DIY interior design communities.

299
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,100
I can tell you about them
if you want.

300
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,760
You know, group buying deals...

301
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,000
are supposed to be cheaper.

302
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,940
Our apartment complex
has 3,000 units.

303
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:41,140
Let's just forget it. Let's go.

304
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,940
Why are you being so stubborn?

305
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,910
You can take on
29 construction contracts at once.

306
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,450
I'm not taking on
construction contracts.

307
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:50,710
I'm just matching you
with coordinators.

308
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,320
What's the difference?

309
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,390
- Hey, who are these ladies?
- Please, Mr. Lee.

310
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:56,890
I think
he's being pushed around by them.

311
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,160
I don't think that's the case.

312
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,560
He's not the type
to be pushed around easily.

313
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,700
What?

314
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:23,810
You're a young CEO,
but you're too inflexible.

315
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:26,380
A new company
that has just started is supposed...

316
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,350
to offer a discount
for a project with 29 units.

317
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:31,220
I have my own principles.

318
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,520
Will you stick to them
even if we don't hire you?

319
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,060
Yes.

320
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,800
That's enough. Give me that thing.

321
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,730
Here.

322
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,500
Can we draw...

323
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,070
what we want like this?

324
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,440
Yes.

325
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,970
The coordinator will create
a floor plan for the construction.

326
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,550
Then, when can you start?

327
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,050
Will you sign the contract?

328
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:02,220
- Yes.
- Yes.

329
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,720
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

330
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,290
- I'll see you later.
- Bye.

331
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:10,390
Bye.

332
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,210
- One iced Americano.
- Okay.

333
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:25,310
Ji Hyuk, what is group buying?

334
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,880
A group of 29 households
wants to hire our coordinators.

335
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:33,720
It feels like the feisty Lee Ji Hyuk
has made his comeback.

336
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,860
Where's Eun Oh? Did she go home?

337
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,760
She's cleaning the terrace.

338
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,130
She's unbelievable.

339
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,220
(Lee Myeong Hui)

340
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:13,290
I'm sorry, Myeong Hui.

341
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,990
I should've given you a call.

342
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,790
The kids?

343
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,430
Of course. I can do that now.

344
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,800
It's been months.

345
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,070
When do you want to meet?

346
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,910
If the currents flowing
in two parallel conductors...

347
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,310
are in the same direction,

348
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,480
they attract each other.

349
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,910
If they're in opposite directions...

350
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:36,950
Excuse me. Sir.

351
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,650
Could you please wake up
the man next to you?

352
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,880
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

353
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,190
Oh, dear.

354
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:45,020
This is an important part.

355
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,320
I'm sorry.
I couldn't sleep well last night.

356
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,390
If they're in opposite directions,

357
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:51,400
which means
in reciprocating conductors,

358
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,700
a repulsive force will occur.

359
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,770
I guess you are also working.

360
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,870
Yes.

361
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:04,140
How many fathers here
would come to the academy...

362
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,780
without needing to work?

363
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,980

How could I doze off in class?

367
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,800
Can't I really handle this?

368
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,740
Good for you, Sang Cheol.

369
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,980
I thought you were trying too hard.

370
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,050
I'll study upstairs.

371
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,050
Upstairs?

372
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,980
In the room with a desk.

373
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,330
What time is it?

374
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,340
It's 1 a.m. already.

375
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:09,970
Part-timers.

376
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,840
What's that?

377
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,010
Who is looking for part-timers
at this hour?

380
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,250
A convenience store in Jaeha-dong?

381
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,790
It's not in my neighborhood.

382
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,790
Only on Tuesdays, Thursdays,
and Saturdays?

383
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,790
This is perfect for me.

and has been chosen
for the investment.

396
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:19,510
Hello.

397
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,280
I'm Lee Ji Hyuk,

398
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:24,380
the CEO of Mamdaerozip,
a matching platform...

399
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,780
that helps clients...

400
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,820
design their own homes
and achieve high-quality results.

401
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:30,820
You will have four minutes
to present your project...

402
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,660
and five minutes for questions.

403
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:35,290
The timer will go off
once your time is up.

404
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,130
Please begin when you're ready.

405
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,800
Thank you.

406
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:49,510
When did you come up
with this project?

407
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:52,640
Does that even matter?

408
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,450
I could say 3 or 5 years,

409
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,250
but how would you know it's true?

410
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,550
Besides, I don't believe
that time equals depth.

411
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:02,620
What motivated me is more important.

412
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:05,920
Please share
what motivated you, then.

413
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,670
I stumbled on this idea by chance.

414
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:19,100
I got a job at a construction site
outside the city.

415
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,740
While there,
a newlywed couple asked...

416
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,410
if I could help rescue
their failed DIY interior project.

417
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,240
That's how it all began.

418
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,210
I realized many people...

419
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,180
wanted to experience the joy...

420
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,320
of living in a house
they designed themselves.

421
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,550
To me, it felt like
endless possibilities.

422
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,520
I was sure it would work.

423
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,330
Ji Hyuk, wait.

424
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:55,510
I bet I surprised you back there.

425
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,180
Wasn't that your plan all along?

426
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,240
I took a smart approach
so I could invest in your business.

427
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,710
I could have done it anonymously,

428
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,180
but you'd be furious
if you found out.

429
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,620
So?

430
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:12,920
I'll invest in Mamdaerozip.

431
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,530
You didn't even discuss this
with your team.

432
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,230
Angel investments
can be made individually.

433
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,230
I know that.

434
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,270
- It's settled, then.
- Not really.

435
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,600
I won't accept your investment.

436
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,940
Stop it already.

437
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,810
You need investment
to get a business off the ground.

438
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,750
I looked at your website
and have also seen you at work.

439
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,680
I believe in its potential.

440
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,450
Besides, it's not a big investment.

441
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:43,090
Forget it, Seong Jae.

442
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:46,990
I have already been offered
an investment from Double S Startup.

443
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,530
Also, I said...

444
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,290
I wouldn't accept anyone's help.

445
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:55,070
Are you kidding me?
Why show up today...

446
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,700
when you've already secured
an investment?

447
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:59,100
Because I promised
I would pitch my business.

448
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,400
I received the other offer
just as I was about to go in.

449
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,140
Their support is minimal,
which means...

450
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,440
you can also take
an investment from me.

451
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,040
All they're offering
is 100,000 to 200,000 dollars.

452
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:08,810
Double S Startup chose to invest
in my project,

453
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,480
and I want to make it on my own.

454
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,150
Isn't that your pride talking?

455
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,420
Why would you care about that
when you run a business?

456
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,090
I just do.

457
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,160
Still, I'm grateful, Seong Jae.

458
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,890
I appreciate the generous offer.

459
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:25,800
This isn't because of Eun Oh.

460
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:29,830
Ji Hyuk, I took the time
to study your website.

461
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:31,600
On top of that, I'm your friend.

462
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:35,740
I can see now that
you really have something going on.

463
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,210
Even if
pride is driving your business,

464
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,340
it still feels wrong
not to help you.

465
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,980
Are you telling me
you don't care how I feel?

466
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:47,080
I do care, which is why
I'm grateful for the offer.

467
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,520
But I won't compromise
my principles...

468
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,890
just to make you feel better.

469
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,560
Good for you, Ji Hyuk.

470
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,300
Let's have lunch.
It'll treat you to something nice.

471
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,200
I have plans, you know.

472
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,540
With who?

473
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,010
Someone who needs my advice.

474
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:12,740
I'll get going.

475
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:19,750
While I was gone,
he became a man of mystery.

476
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:54,420
Why did she ask to meet
at a place like this?

477
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,290
Why not just text me
the restaurant's address?

478
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:59,490
Parking is not allowed here.

479
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:03,990
- What's this?
- What?

480
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:05,830
What do you mean?

481
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,470
I mean...

482
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,200
I've never seen you
dressed like this before.

483
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,670
I have plans after lunch.

484
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,540
Let's go, Seong Jae.

485
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,210
Hold on. Why are you
suddenly linking arms with me?

486
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,810
Why not? You even used
to give me piggyback rides.

487
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,280
Linking arms is no big deal...

488
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:24,580
between us.

489
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:33,390
Su Bin, what's this?

490
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,760
Isn't this hilarious?

491
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,990
Quail eggs are the babies,
and the chicken egg is the mom.

492
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,360
I bet you haven't seen
anything like this before.

493
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,960
It's a first.

494
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:47,070
Enjoy, Seong Jae.

495
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:49,910
No, you first.
I'll get some on my own.

496
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:51,880
Whenever I see you,

497
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,010
I feel guilty for all the times
I held out my hand...

498
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:55,150
asking for snacks.

499
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,480
- Out of the blue?
- On top of that,

500
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,820
you appeared on my YouTube channel.

501
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,490
I shouldn't just thank you
with my words.

502
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:03,990
The least I can do is
treat you to a meal.

503
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:06,720
Is that why you asked to meet me?
I thought it was to talk.

504
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,930
What would I need to say to you?

505
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:11,530
You wouldn't have shown up...

506
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:12,800
if I had offered
to treat you to a meal.

507
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,860
So I made up an excuse.

508
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,300
Come on, you brat.
I doubt you're in a position...

509
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,100
to thank me over a meal.

510
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,940
Besides, I'm not a stranger
you asked for help.

511
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:27,510
It's wrong to inconvenience
even your own siblings.

512
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,710
You sounded very grown-up.

513
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,220
A grown-up is what I already am.

514
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:37,850
Since you went to college in the US,

515
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:39,260
you don't have...

516
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,520
any fond food memories
from your early to mid-20s.

517
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:44,290
I guess not.

518
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,830
Seong Jae, I bet you haven't heard
of Gangster Tteokbokki.

519
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,400
Have you even been
to the Hongdae area?

520
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,400
What about Seongsu-dong?

(CEO Yu of Living App)

522
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:06,880
Yes, hello.

523

This is Lee Ji Hyuk,
CEO of Mamdaerozip.

524
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,290
We talked some time ago.

525
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:15,090
Yes, you told me to reach out
once I secured an investment.

526
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:16,790
That's right.

527
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:20,400
I'll send you the materials
my friend used to develop the app...

528
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,870
in advance.

529
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:24,470
Review them, and we can
discuss them in the meeting.

530
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:25,970
Got it.

531
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,470
Hold on.

532
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:30,970
The family has a five-year-old boy,

533
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,710
so it'd be better
to round off the wall corner...

534
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:35,950
where the playroom
meets the living room.

535
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:38,380
Ms. Ji, not again.

536
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,180
That wasn't part of the plan.

537
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,990
Just like Chief Cha,

538
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,720
you could round the corner
by shaping the plywood.

539
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,820
Unbelievable.

540
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:51,430
You look more exhausted
than the last time I saw you,

541
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:53,030
yet you're still
giving out freebies.

542
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,300
Why are you always like this?

543
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:58,900
I told you when we discussed
the indirect lighting.

544
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,700
The family has a tight budget.

545
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:02,340
Unbelievable.

546
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:06,540
Okay, fine. I'll get it done.

547
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,980
Thank you.

548
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:11,920
In return, I'll bring
high-quality snacks tomorrow.

549
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:14,350
You'd better.

550
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:16,890
Guys, let's clean up and head home.

551
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:18,320
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

552
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,990
(Mom)

553
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,400
Hey, Mom. I'll be heading out soon.

554
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,530
Hold on.

555
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:30,930
Don't come to the restaurant.
Just come home instead.

556
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,570
I closed up for the day.

557
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:34,170
Why?

558
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,810
Gang Oh called.

559
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:39,080
He has something to say
and told us to come home.

560
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:41,310
Home?

561
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,350
I see.

562
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:46,720
All right.
I'll head home right away.

563
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,890
(Su Jeong)

564
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:04,430
Hey, Su Jeong.
I can't stop by the cafe today.

565
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:05,940
Gang Oh's home.

566
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,840
What did Gang Oh say?

567
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:17,510
He's been quiet, saying
he'll only talk once you arrive.

568
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:21,020
My heart has been racing ever since.

569
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,530
Let's go outside. We'll talk alone.

570
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:39,100
Mom should hear this too.

571
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:42,870
Sit on the floor, then.

572
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:46,140
Mom, sit with us.

573
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:47,710
Sure.

574
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:56,690
Where have you been?

575
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:59,320
You should have at least called Mom.

576
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,660
You knew she'd be worried.

577
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,760
I was too lost in thought
to think about that.

578
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:08,330
I thought long and hard, you see.

579
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:12,400
- So?
- Come on.

580
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:14,600
Why did you need...

581
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,440
to think long and hard about this?

582
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,040
I knew it.

583
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:21,940
You didn't tell her.

584
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,450
You didn't tell her
how I've been wronged,

585
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:26,020
how much you've taken from me.

586
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:29,650
What are you talking about?

587
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,520
Mom, listen to me.

588
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,430
What you spent on Ji Eun Oh,

589
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:37,330
who isn't your real daughter,

590
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,700
and the benefits she received...

591
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,930
were mine and were taken from me.

592
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:44,530
What?

593
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:45,600
So...

594
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,500
give me back the money...

595
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,140
my dad spent on you.

596
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,440
Start with 20,000 dollars.

597
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:55,410
What?

598
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:58,250
Gang Oh,
what on earth are you saying?

599
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,980
It's what she took from me!

600
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,190
She needs to return
what was originally mine.

601
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:04,550
If you want to live with Mom,
that is.

602
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:07,020
Have you lost your mind?

603
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:10,760
Eun Oh's your sister.

604
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,900
She's your dad's and my daughter.

605
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,500
Not to me, she's not.

606
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,400
I believe in blood ties, Mom,

607
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,200
so don't you tell me
to think otherwise.

608
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,970
I'm your real son,

609
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:23,040
and Ji Eun Oh's the one you adopted.

610
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,970
She's not your real daughter.

611
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:27,480
How could you say this, Gang Oh?

612
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,080
She's your big sister!

613
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,680
She was your sister
from the moment you were born.

614
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,680
How could you be so cruel to her?

615
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,750
She's not my sister by blood.

616
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:39,520
We might share fond memories,

617
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,860
but do you know
what I remember the most?

618
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,990
Even at department stores,
you bought things for her first.

619
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:46,030
You always bought her
whatever she wanted to eat first.

620
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,800
When I wanted
a padded jacket from Uvis,

621
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,000
I had to wear a boring one
from South all because of her.

622
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:52,970
She's also the reason
I had to quit soccer.

623
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,370
You just weren't good enough.

624
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:56,140
How is that your sister's fault?

625
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,510
Why didn't you let me go
to the soccer camp in the UK?

626
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:00,210
It was too expensive.

627
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:03,250
You brat!

628
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:07,080
That was right after
your father's company went under.

629
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,750
If you had saved up
instead of spending money on her,

630
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:11,850
Dad's company
might not have taken a hit.

631
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:15,220
- What?
- Should I continue?

632
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:16,530
I could do this all night.

633
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:19,600
No, that's enough.

634
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:26,200
What will you do
with the 20,000 dollars I give you?

635
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,200
That's none of your business.

636
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,140
Just give me the money.
Take it from your savings,

637
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:31,970
borrow it, or get a loan.

638
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:34,510
No.

639
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,420
I won't do any of that...

640
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,220
because I won't give you my money.

641
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,850
What?

642
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,560
The 20,000 dollars
I let you borrow...

643
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:49,130
Actually, it's 24,000 dollars.

644
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:51,360
You haven't paid
even a cent of it back.

645
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:54,430
I told you to pay me back.

646
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,200
You won't give me any money?

647
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:06,180
You're shameless and selfish,
all rolled into one.

648
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:09,110
Gang Oh, watch your words.

649
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:12,920
If you don't give me the money,
you'll be kicked out of this house.

650
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,780
Says who?

651
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:16,950
Listen to me loud and clear.

652
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,330
I won't give you any of my money.

653
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,430
Pay me back
what you borrowed last time,

654
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,530
and help Mom
at the restaurant until closing.

655
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,240
You've got to be kidding me.

656
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,310
Ji Eun Oh.

657
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,980
Whose child are you
to be this shameless?

658
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:46,350
Who are your real parents?

659
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,920
Oh, no! Gang Oh. My gosh.

660
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:52,920
Goodness me.

661
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:59,730
No, don't. Gang Oh, please!

662
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,100
Gang Oh...

663
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,870
Is it me or Ji Eun Oh?

664
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,410
What?

665
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,440
I can't live
under the same roof as her.

666
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:19,780
So, choose. Is it me or Ji Eun Oh?

667
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:37,030
It's Eun Oh.

668
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:39,070
My daughter.

669
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:43,040
Your big sister.

670
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,380
You choose Ji Eun Oh?

671
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,820
Fine.

672
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,150
I got it.

673
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:00,190
Have a good life with her.

674
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,960
Goodness.

675
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:21,140
Gang Oh, what's the matter with you?

676
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:24,110
Like you care!
You just told me to leave.

677
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,680
Gang Oh, you can't do this.

678
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,490
You know...

679
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:32,520
what your sister did for us
after your dad passed away.

680
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,160
It's thanks to her...

681
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,130
that we're making a living
running our restaurant.

682
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:37,890
How could you treat her this way?

683
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,430
As if that makes up for anything.

684
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,100
Just abandon me
and live a good life with her!

685
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:48,500
Gang Oh, what has gotten into you?

686
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,440
Gang Oh, please.

687
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:56,050
(Taxi, Reserved)

688
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,080
Hey.

689
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:00,520
Gang Oh!

690
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,850
Gang Oh.

691
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:03,820
- Gang Oh, no.
- As if.

692
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:07,220
If you leave now,

693
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,260
it'll be over between us.

694
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:11,290
I won't let you back into my life.

695
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:13,260
What a joke.

696
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:16,530
We should never have been a family
in the first place.

697
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:20,440
Tell Mom she won't see me again
until things are back...

698
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,570
to normal.

699
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:27,110
Gang Oh!

700
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,180
Gang Oh.

701
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:30,080
Gang Oh!

702
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:20,430
You crazy brat.
How could he say that to me?

703
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:27,900
Eun Oh.

704
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,270
Mom.

705
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,710
Let's not say anything today.

706
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,040
Are you hungry?

707
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:10,510
No.

708
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,820
As if. Of course, you're hungry.

709
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:15,150
Your packed meal
was obviously a salad.

710
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:19,420
Hey, let me ask you this one thing.

711
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:22,490
Why must you always have a salad?

712
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:25,800
I want to stay fit and healthy.

713
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:27,930
It's not like you want to be
in show business.

714
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:30,930
You're slim already,
so why worry about your weight?

715
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:32,770
On top of that,

716
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:34,600
doesn't art require stamina too?

717
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:42,880
Didn't you hear me?

718
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:44,480
We should go back...

719
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:47,320
to a strictly
driver-employer relationship.

720
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,190
What?

721
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,950
It's uncomfortable.

722
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:53,920
What is?

723
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,360
You.

724
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:02,060
You just want me to drive you?

725
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,200
Like before?

726
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:05,700
And treat you like a lady?

727
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,740
No. I won't go back to that.

728
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:12,470
I quit. Tell your mom.

729
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:16,810
Okay.

730
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:35,200
You're maintaining your weight.
Good for you.

731
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:38,570
Mom.

732
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,040
You haven't found a new driver yet?

733
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:44,540
Why? Is something wrong?

734
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:47,680
No, but the current driver is
a temporary replacement.

735
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:51,780
Yes. I knew
that would bother you too.

736
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:54,020
I'm down to two candidates.

737
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:55,820
I'll decide tomorrow
or the day after.

738
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,360
Since our new technology...

739
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,460
won an award at the Silicon Valley
Invention Exhibition,

740
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,030
we've been getting many calls...

741
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:06,730
from Europe as well as the US.

742
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,770
The Italian buyer
who asked to tour our Gangnam store.

743
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,130
Who will escort them?

744
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:14,740
Global Operations Director Yoon
and Team Leader Kang.

745
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:16,370
I'll join them.

746
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,710
You will?

747
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:25,380
We're yet to enter Europe.

748
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,950
It would be wise
to treat the buyer with care.

749
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:39,860
Join Director Yoon and look around.

750
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:43,730
Yes, sir. I won't overstep.

751
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,670
- Okay.
- Bye, then.

752
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,880
Did I get out of
the wrong side of the bed today?

753
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:58,110
Why is he volunteering
to do something?

754
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:01,820

You said you needed
an urgent cash injection,

761
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,490
so we'll wire
50,000 dollars right away.

762
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,660
You'll get the other 50,000
within the month.

- Sure.

766
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:06,520
Okay!

767
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:13,320
Why are you withdrawing the money?

768
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:15,760
Oh, right.

769
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:18,090
I have to pay a business partner.

770
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:20,100
Why don't you wire it?

771
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:22,500
No. I want a check
for 10,000 dollars,

772
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,800
another for 5,000 dollars,
and 3 for 1,000 dollars.

I love it so much. Oh, my!

776
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:38,880
It cost a lot more,

777
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:41,520
but the kitchen looks much classier.

778
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:44,620

the whole process so well.

Do I still have to call you
"Ms. Ji?"

00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,310
Isn't that obvious?

795
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,340

Wait.

800
00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:58,230
I just want us to have lunch.

801
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:01,160
As the CEO of Mamdaerozip.

802
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:02,800
I don't want to.

803
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:09,840
You don't have to mind me,

804
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:12,610
and you don't have to worry either.

805
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:16,510
Then...

806
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:24,820
Take this.

807
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:30,690
It's 18,000 dollars.
I paid you 2,000 beforehand.

808
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:38,270
What's that look about?

809
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:41,500
Did you think I wouldn't pay you...

810
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:42,800
for your services?

811
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:45,240
I don't believe it.

812
00:46:46,610 --> 00:46:48,210
Where did you get the money?

813
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:49,610
I got an investment.

814
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:53,320
An official investment
from Double S Startup.

815
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,150
Here.

816
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:01,990
Good for you.

817
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:20,780
Here.

818
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:24,380
Why are you giving me this?

819
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:26,750
I did my job as a coordinator.

820
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:28,420
I'll take the money just for that.

821
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:29,790
No.

822
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:32,390
I made a special offer
to pay you 20,000 dollars,

823
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,020
and you agreed.

824
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:35,960
Our contract says so.

825
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:37,730
What's wrong?

826
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,500
Do you feel sorry for me?

827
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,970
It's not that.

828
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,800
It's for my peace of mind.

829
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:48,340
That's your problem.

830
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:51,540
You put your pride and ego first,

831
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:53,440
despite your circumstances.

832
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:56,580
Why would you refuse
what you're owed?

833
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:58,250
You should be asking for more.

834
00:47:58,810 --> 00:48:00,250
Why do you keep nagging?

835
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:02,480
How dare you lecture me?

836
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,090
Why do you keep criticizing
what I do?

837
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:05,990
Ji Eun Oh.

838
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:09,390
I might be someone
you resent forever,

839
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:11,630
but you're still
simply Ji Eun Oh to me.

840
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,400
Ever since we met
when I came back to college.

841
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:19,500
You might be able to...

842
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:22,070
hate me or resent me, but I can't.

843
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:24,670
How could I?

844
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,050
I called a taxi
to take us to the restaurant.

845
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:35,120
Let's go to the cafe.

846
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:37,590
I want to walk alone.

847
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:43,930
Why...

848
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:02,280
Ji Eun Oh.

849
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:04,980
Whose child are you
to be this shameless?

850
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:07,280
Who are your real parents?

852
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:54,360
Eun Oh.

853
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:57,300
Hello, Mr. Park.

854
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:03,140
Are you all right?

855
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:08,180
Get on my back.

856
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:19,050
Why is she so light?

857
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:25,560
Hey, get Eun Oh a chair to sit on.

858
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,260
I think she needs to lie down.

859
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:28,600
- Come this way.
- Okay.

860
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:33,770
Wait.

861
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:34,770
Okay.

862
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:48,050
What happened?

863
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:51,150
I ran into her on the street.

864
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,050
Did she pass out?

865
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:55,460
Almost.

866
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:01,230
Do you think
it's because of overwork?

867
00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:04,400
Or was she stressed out
because of Gang Oh?

868
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:09,500
Where were you going?

869
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:13,140
Oh, right.

870
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,380
I have to get going.

871
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:16,510
I'm meeting with a buyer.

872
00:51:17,350 --> 00:51:19,250
Should I have taken her
to the hospital?

873
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:20,350
No.

874
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:22,280
She's asleep,
so I'll take care of her.

875
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:25,490
Okay. I appreciate it.

876
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:31,860
Why would he appreciate me?

877
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:35,000
Ji Hyuk, are you all right?

878
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,970
Yes. I won't be using the keyboard,
so it will be fine.

879
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:39,730
You can go and work at the cafe.

880
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,770
I was asking if he was okay.

881
00:53:41,290 --> 00:53:42,520
Don't get up so quickly.

882
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:46,030
You might pass out again,
feeling dizzy.

883
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,580
I owe you one.

884
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,550
If you know that,
make sure to eat...

885
00:54:07,550 --> 00:54:08,680
when someone asks you to.

886
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:13,760
There's nothing
I can do for you, right?

887
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:17,230
No.

888
00:54:30,670 --> 00:54:33,510
I remember that Mr. Park
was carrying me on his back.

889
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:41,820
I bet you haven't been eating
or sleeping.

890
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:44,220
You're right.

891
00:54:44,590 --> 00:54:45,750
And what else?

892
00:54:46,490 --> 00:54:48,260
Something else happened
with Gang Oh, right?

893
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:51,730
Since the day you went home
to see Gang Oh a few days ago,

894
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:53,530
you haven't been in your right mind.

895
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,770
Buy some porridge for Eun Oh.

896
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:06,880
Min Woo, I'll go
and buy Eun Oh some porridge.

897
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,340
It's busy, but hold down the fort
while I'm gone.

898
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:09,580
Okay.

899
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:13,080
No. It's a busy time for the cafe.

900
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:14,850
It's okay.

901
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,550
And I need to hear what's going on.

902
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,220
Hello.

903
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:23,760
Hello.

904
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:38,070
This is delicious.

905
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:39,770
I know. This place must be famous.

906
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:41,580
- The food is good.
- It's nice.

907
00:55:53,590 --> 00:55:54,660
Da Jeong.

908
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:57,090
Now that you're here to meet us,

909
00:55:57,090 --> 00:55:58,490
I guess everything is sorted out.

910
00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:01,500
Of course.
They say time heals all wounds.

911
00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:05,330
What about Sang Cheol?

912
00:56:06,070 --> 00:56:08,670
Is he doing well as an advisor
at the new company?

913
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:10,370
Let's not talk about my husband.

914
00:56:10,370 --> 00:56:11,740
He's doing just fine.

915
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:13,880
If we don't talk about our husbands
and children when we meet,

916
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,240
what else can we talk about?

917
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:16,580
Politics?

918
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:18,480
We just ask each other
how our families are doing.

919
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:21,450
You know I still work,

920
00:56:21,450 --> 00:56:23,590
and we have Myeong Hui.
Why don't you hear our complaints?

921
00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:25,890
Right. I have a lot
to talk about today.

922
00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:28,160
There's nothing new about you two.

923
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,230
What I want to hear about
is Ji Hyuk.

924
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:34,260
What about him?

925
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,530
Has your son come to his senses yet?

926
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:41,440
- What?
- I don't know...

927
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,270
how he got tangled up
in the rich girl's affair,

928
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:46,040
but he got into big trouble
because of his foolish dream.

929
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:48,180
Hey.

930
00:56:48,710 --> 00:56:51,680
Has a rich girl
ever proposed to your son?

931
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:53,980
Can you believe what she's saying?

932
00:56:54,350 --> 00:56:56,220
Hey, is a proposal a big deal?

933
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,690
The girl eloped with another guy.

934
00:56:58,690 --> 00:57:00,790
- Mi Yeong, stop it.
- Goodness.

935
00:57:01,290 --> 00:57:04,690
I'm just asking her the questions
you were curious about.

936
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:09,960
Mi Yeong, I heard your husband
cheated on you for the third time.

937
00:57:10,330 --> 00:57:11,870
What? The third time?

938
00:57:11,870 --> 00:57:14,400
No. It was his second time...

939
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:20,410
I see. So, the third time
was just a rumor.

940
00:57:20,810 --> 00:57:24,310
Is there any evidence
that Ji Hyuk's fiancee eloped?

941
00:57:24,910 --> 00:57:26,010
No, right?

942
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:28,280
Oh, right.

943
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,650
Whether it was the 2nd or 3rd time,

944
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:33,220
how are you managing life
with a husband who cheated on you?

945
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:34,390
Is it all right?

946
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:35,420
Are you just living your life
with no purpose?

947
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:38,290
- Hey, Kim Da Jeong!
- So watch your mouth, you fool.

948
00:57:38,790 --> 00:57:41,060
Even in high school,
your nickname was Blabbermouth.

949
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:43,300
Will bad-mouthing my son...

950
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:45,070
make your husband come back
after cheating on you?

951
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,400
You don't mind if I talk
about your husband, do you?

952
00:57:50,410 --> 00:57:52,610
Girls, from now on,

953
00:57:52,610 --> 00:57:54,180
I'll call her Big Blabbermouth.

954
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:57,950
Hey, isn't she being
too harsh on me?

955
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:00,850
You messed with her first.

956
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:03,050
- Let's eat, Da Jeong.
- Yes, let's eat.

957
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,350
Actually, we called you out
to cheer you up today.

958
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:08,120
I know.

959
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:10,120
I'm feeling better already.

960
00:58:10,430 --> 00:58:12,630
So, let's just skip that part.

961
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:15,330
Still, let me pay
for the meal today.

962
00:58:15,330 --> 00:58:16,800
What are you talking about?

963
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:19,500
I made you come
to the wedding for nothing.

964
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:21,440
And Big Blabbermouth
had to pay for transportation.

965
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,800
I should treat you girls today.

966
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:24,710
Let's eat.

967
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:26,470
- All right.
- Let's eat.

968
00:58:32,850 --> 00:58:33,920
Ji Hyuk.

969
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,820
I miss you so much.

970
00:58:40,290 --> 00:58:43,090
When on earth
are you going to come back?

971
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:48,060
Where are you
and what are you doing?

972
00:58:50,670 --> 00:58:51,700
You brat.

973
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:54,170
Does hiding for a year...

974
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,240
make your embarrassment go away?

975
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:59,810
The only thing you can do...

976
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:03,140
is admit your mistakes
and move forward.

977
00:59:13,690 --> 00:59:15,890
Why did you not say anything
when I said hi?

978
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:18,530
What are you doing?

979
00:59:20,430 --> 00:59:21,500
I'm eating.

980
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,400
What...

981
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:25,470
I'm hungry.

982
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:30,440
Why are you eating here alone
when you're supposed to cook dinner?

983
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:34,710
Am I someone
who cooks dinner every single day?

984
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:37,050
So what if I eat first for once?

985
00:59:38,850 --> 00:59:41,020
Did you have a bad day?

986
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:45,050
I did, which is why I'm like this.

987
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:51,330
- Okay. I'll have ramyeon...
- That darn ramyeon.

988
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:53,590
Men cook that...

989
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:55,260
as if they're making
a huge sacrifice.

990
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,300
There are side dishes in the fridge,

991
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:58,830
rice in the freezer,
and soup in the pot.

992
00:59:58,830 --> 01:00:00,130
Why can't you heat that up?

993
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:05,010
Su Bin, what should I do
in this situation?

994
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:08,610
- I'll set the table.
- Gosh, I'm hungry.

995
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:11,210
I smell something nice.

996
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:14,780
Mother.

997
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:18,420
Will you have bibimbap instead?

998
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:21,790
We have seasoned radish
and stir-fried bracken.

999
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:27,430
Yes. Let's have that.

1000
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:41,410
What's up with her?

1001
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:45,280
What else could it be about?

1002
01:00:46,550 --> 01:00:48,350
It's her son.

1003
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:52,920
Kim Da Jeong.

1004
01:00:54,690 --> 01:00:57,030
You won't tell me what it's about?

1005
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,100
I miss Ji Hyuk.

1006
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:06,800
That's it?

1007
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:10,410
Doesn't he miss home?

1008

(Cafe Agit)

1009
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:16,470
There's a coworking space...

1010
01:02:16,470 --> 01:02:18,810
near my office where we can talk.

1011
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:20,310
Will you come over?

1012
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:24,380
Pulling an all-nighter?
That's not a problem.

1013
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:26,710
I'll bring what we need.

1014
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:28,350
See you there. Bye.

1015
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:43,820
(Our Golden Days)

1016
01:03:44,090 --> 01:03:45,590
You're still up, Mom?

1017
01:03:45,590 --> 01:03:48,200
Hey, Eun Oh. You're home early.

1018
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:50,000
- Let go!
- What's going on over there?

1019
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,200
Who are you?

1020
01:03:52,470 --> 01:03:53,940
I'm her dad. So what?

1021
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:55,800
Something happened to Ji Eun Oh.

1022
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,100
And from what I observed,

1023
01:03:57,140 --> 01:03:59,440
there are two men in her vicinity.

1024
01:03:59,870 --> 01:04:00,910
What's this?

1025
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:03,640
My confession.
Don't we make a nice couple?

1026
01:04:04,450 --> 01:04:05,550
Date me.

1027
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,350
Ji Eun Oh!

1028
01:04:08,620 --> 01:04:10,750
Are you all right? Were you hurt?

1029
01:04:10,850 --> 01:04:12,890
Are you stupid?
Doesn't your brain work?

1030
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:15,360
You're getting to me
in so many ways.
