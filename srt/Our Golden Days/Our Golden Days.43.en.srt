Your symptoms...

2
00:00:06,438 --> 00:00:08,708
I think we need to run some tests on your heart.

3
00:00:11,538 --> 00:00:16,178
Based on your EKG and lab results as well as the echocardiogram,

4
00:00:16,378 --> 00:00:19,478
you've been diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy.

5
00:00:21,378 --> 00:00:23,648
Dilated cardiomyopathy?

6
00:00:24,388 --> 00:00:25,558
What's that?

7
00:00:26,088 --> 00:00:29,958
It's when the heart gets enlarged and can't pump blood effectively.

8
00:00:30,558 --> 00:00:32,658
If you don't get admitted and start treatment right away,

9
00:00:32,998 --> 00:00:35,698
your heart could stop as soon as tonight.

10
00:00:38,968 --> 00:00:39,968
Wait...

11
00:00:40,698 --> 00:00:43,368
What did you just say?

12
00:00:44,908 --> 00:00:45,908
I'm...

13
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:48,438
going to die?

14
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:54,378
We can manage the symptoms, but a full recovery is unlikely.

15
00:00:54,918 --> 00:00:58,888
Your heart function is so poor that it could stop at any time,

16
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:00,888
and it wouldn't be surprising if you died suddenly.

17
00:01:01,158 --> 00:01:03,988
You're essentially a walking time bomb.

18
00:01:05,128 --> 00:01:06,598
The only real treatment...

19
00:01:07,658 --> 00:01:10,068
is a heart transplant.

20
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:21,208

21
00:01:21,838 --> 00:01:22,848
transplant?

22
00:01:23,078 --> 00:01:27,248
Yes. Ultimately, you will need a heart transplant.

What on earth is she thinking?

182
00:12:40,858 --> 00:12:42,318
(Mom)

183
00:12:42,588 --> 00:12:43,628
It's my mom.

184
00:12:49,158 --> 00:12:53,038
- Hello, Mom. - Yeong Ra, be home by 6:30pm.

185
00:12:53,438 --> 00:12:56,638
We're all having dinner tonight to celebrate Yang Ji Il's arrest.

186
00:12:58,008 --> 00:12:59,238
Is Seong Jae coming, too?

187
00:12:59,938 --> 00:13:01,038
Of course, he is.

188
00:13:01,608 --> 00:13:02,678
Don't be late.

189
00:13:04,608 --> 00:13:05,608
Okay.

190
00:13:11,748 --> 00:13:13,118
My mom sure is excited.

191
00:13:14,088 --> 00:13:17,588
So Seong Jae must've promised he wouldn't tell Dad.

192
00:13:19,428 --> 00:13:20,428
Why?

193
00:13:22,428 --> 00:13:25,528
She wants me back by 6:30pm to celebrate Yang Ji Il's arrest.

194
00:13:27,768 --> 00:13:29,168
But I just had ramyeon.

195
00:13:30,068 --> 00:13:33,608
She doesn't know where Woo Jin is after he escaped from the hospital,

196
00:13:33,678 --> 00:13:35,678
and she is throwing a party?

197
00:13:36,648 --> 00:13:38,178
It just means she's confident she'll find him.

198
00:13:39,348 --> 00:13:44,048
Her son ran away from her. How can she feel like celebrating?

199
00:13:44,418 --> 00:13:45,418
Hey.

200
00:13:46,118 --> 00:13:48,488
Are you still trying to make sense of my mom?

201
00:13:54,898 --> 00:13:56,828
I haven't made this cake in a while.

202
00:13:57,168 --> 00:13:58,968
This is your favorite, isn't it, Yeong Ra?

203
00:14:00,038 --> 00:14:02,298
- Yes. - I like this one, too.

204
00:14:03,938 --> 00:14:06,808
Please. You prefer tiramisu.

205
00:14:08,408 --> 00:14:09,408
Go on, Yeong Ra. Blow them out.

206
00:14:13,378 --> 00:14:15,178
Congratulations, sweetie!

207
00:14:15,878 --> 00:14:17,218
Now, you're free!

208
00:14:18,018 --> 00:14:19,888
You've been through so much, Yeong Ra.

209
00:14:20,658 --> 00:14:21,658
Congratulations.

210
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:25,788
Shall we eat, everyone? You must be hungry.

211
00:14:30,898 --> 00:14:32,428
Dad, you're staring at Mom again.

212
00:14:35,068 --> 00:14:37,268
Dad, even after all this time, when you look at Mom...

213
00:14:37,568 --> 00:14:38,568
Are you still so in love with her?

214
00:14:39,978 --> 00:14:42,038
There's no one else like your mother.

215
00:14:42,908 --> 00:14:45,448
I wonder if there's anyone else like her in the world.

216
00:14:47,818 --> 00:14:50,888
That's why I'm so utterly devoted to you.

217
00:14:52,318 --> 00:14:55,088
See, Seong Jae? Pleasing a woman is quite simple.

218
00:14:55,618 --> 00:14:58,088
When a woman feels appreciated by her man,

219
00:14:58,158 --> 00:15:00,898
she'll want to repay him ten times over.

220
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:03,028
She's right about that.

221
00:15:03,998 --> 00:15:07,338
It's so touching, you almost want to be fooled by it.

222
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:12,908
What's Dad thinking?

223
00:15:18,448 --> 00:15:19,518
Hey, Yeong Ra.

224
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:22,478
You should start getting out more and enjoy your freedom.

225
00:15:23,818 --> 00:15:24,818
Okay.

226
00:15:25,948 --> 00:15:27,888
Seong Jae's right, Yeong Ra.

227
00:15:28,788 --> 00:15:30,658
And this year is off to such a great start.

228
00:15:31,358 --> 00:15:35,028
We don't need Mr. Lee anymore, and Yeong Ra can go out on her own.

229
00:15:35,328 --> 00:15:37,498
Our little girl is all grown up now.

230
00:15:39,068 --> 00:15:41,798
So, Yeong Ra, what's happening with Mr. Lee?

231
00:15:42,468 --> 00:15:45,908
There are still a few things to do, so he's working until tomorrow.

232
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:49,208
But I was so scared out of my mind.

233
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:52,008
I think I was way too overprotective of Yeong Ra.

234
00:15:52,648 --> 00:15:56,588
But what could I do? That guy was no ordinary creep.

235
00:15:56,948 --> 00:16:00,318
- Right? - You're absolutely right, but...

236
00:16:00,888 --> 00:16:02,928
it's time you paid some attention to Woo Jin.

237
00:16:05,758 --> 00:16:08,998
- Woo Jin? - Yes. Lately, you haven't...

238
00:16:09,058 --> 00:16:11,068
mentioned his name once.

239
00:16:11,798 --> 00:16:13,898
You're playing favorites, aren't you?

240
00:16:14,268 --> 00:16:15,798
Honestly...

241
00:16:16,438 --> 00:16:19,978
Come on. With Woo Jin, yesterday was the same as always,

242
00:16:20,008 --> 00:16:24,378
and tomorrow will be the same. It's always study and exercise.

243
00:16:28,918 --> 00:16:32,318
Yes, it's a 24-hour EKG monitoring device.

244
00:16:32,388 --> 00:16:33,788
You'll just need to keep it on.

245
00:16:34,988 --> 00:16:37,458
- Okay. - I'll be back to check on you.

246
00:16:44,968 --> 00:16:47,238
How on earth did I end up here?

247
00:16:52,238 --> 00:16:54,978
This is why everyone wants to be successful.

248
00:16:54,978 --> 00:16:56,808
A three-day business trip to Tokyo.

249
00:16:57,078 --> 00:16:58,078
Wow, that's really impressive.

250
00:16:59,248 --> 00:17:03,288
A sudden trip like that could be a cause for concern.

251
00:17:03,488 --> 00:17:06,188
Come on. I told you Ji Hyuk sounded cheerful.

252
00:17:06,688 --> 00:17:08,918
Can you please stop being such a worrywart?

253
00:17:09,218 --> 00:17:11,728
Anyway, it's his first trip abroad since he became the CEO.

254
00:17:12,758 --> 00:17:13,898
I bet he'll bring us back presents.

255
00:17:14,228 --> 00:17:16,628
What are you talking about, gifts? He'll be too busy for that.

256
00:17:17,598 --> 00:17:18,598
Su Bin.

257
00:17:19,028 --> 00:17:21,398
Is there anything you want your big brother to bring you?

258
00:17:22,868 --> 00:17:23,868
No, not really.

259
00:17:30,678 --> 00:17:33,148
Did you really have that little faith in me?

260
00:17:36,078 --> 00:17:37,088
What?

261
00:17:37,948 --> 00:17:41,088
I thought you seemed so gloomy and distracted lately,

262
00:17:41,988 --> 00:17:43,858
but today, the old Ko Seong Hui is finally back.

263
00:17:44,588 --> 00:17:47,298
I told you the arrest was a sure thing, didn't I?

264
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:48,698
I was that obvious, wasn't I?

265
00:17:49,928 --> 00:17:51,828
But how could I not worry?

266
00:17:52,598 --> 00:17:56,808
"What if he just gets probation? Yeong Ra's life would be ruined."

267
00:17:57,038 --> 00:17:58,268
I was on pins and needles.

268
00:17:58,838 --> 00:17:59,838
I know.

269
00:18:00,978 --> 00:18:03,048
Okay. Next topic.

270
00:18:04,008 --> 00:18:05,378
That girl Seong Jae was dating, Lee Su Bin.

271
00:18:05,678 --> 00:18:06,848
What do her older brothers do for a living?

272
00:18:08,648 --> 00:18:11,148
That's all in the past. Why are you asking about that now?

273
00:18:12,188 --> 00:18:14,988
Because Seong Jae still seems so down about it.

274
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,858
So you're worried about him.

275
00:18:19,928 --> 00:18:21,128
All right, fine.

276
00:18:21,628 --> 00:18:25,198
It was his first romance in a while. Of course, he got swept up in it.

277
00:18:26,028 --> 00:18:28,338
I guess I'll have to start looking for a good match for him again.

278
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:32,138
It's not like you to dodge a question.

279
00:18:32,438 --> 00:18:33,738
Her brothers.

280
00:18:34,178 --> 00:18:37,878
Goodness. They were nobodies. I barely remember.

281
00:18:38,508 --> 00:18:41,018
It was some kind of rinky-dink company.

282
00:18:42,148 --> 00:18:44,118
My friend, Ji Hyuk, is the CEO of AP Group.

283
00:18:47,058 --> 00:18:50,528
So that's the real reason you were so against them dating.

284
00:18:50,888 --> 00:18:52,828
Useless brothers are a worse red flag...

285
00:18:52,828 --> 00:18:55,498
than an unemployed father.

286
00:18:55,798 --> 00:18:56,798
I see.

287
00:19:12,978 --> 00:19:14,418
My curiosity is killing me. I have to find out.

288
00:19:19,318 --> 00:19:21,088
According to your MRI results,

289
00:19:21,418 --> 00:19:24,688
we found signs that you've had viral myocarditis in the past.

290
00:19:25,528 --> 00:19:28,898
You said you had a cold and aches a few months ago, right?

291
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:33,238
It was likely myocarditis then, but it went undiagnosed,

292
00:19:33,538 --> 00:19:35,998
and it appears your heart has been gradually enlarging since then.

293
00:19:37,938 --> 00:19:38,938
I see.

294
00:19:41,438 --> 00:19:43,378
I didn't get an MRI.

295
00:19:44,048 --> 00:19:46,648
I just thought it was a bad cold.

296
00:19:48,348 --> 00:19:50,888
Should I put you on the transplant waiting list?

297
00:19:56,018 --> 00:19:58,128
If I get on the transplant list,

298
00:19:59,088 --> 00:20:00,728
how long would the wait be?

299
00:20:01,058 --> 00:20:03,428
I can't say for sure right now.

300
00:20:04,098 --> 00:20:07,598
As you may know, a heart can't come from any donor.

301
00:20:08,238 --> 00:20:11,268
A registered organ donor has to become brain-dead,

302
00:20:12,238 --> 00:20:14,278
and the waiting list is very long.

303
00:20:16,378 --> 00:20:17,378
So...

304
00:20:19,048 --> 00:20:20,448
if my turn never comes,

305
00:20:22,148 --> 00:20:25,618
I'll just die waiting for a heart transplant.

306
00:20:27,858 --> 00:20:29,018
Well, let's see.

307
00:20:41,298 --> 00:20:45,708
Why the sudden trip to Tokyo? You said nothing about it at lunch.

308
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:47,938
I'm dying to know, so please tell me.

309
00:20:48,608 --> 00:20:49,608
Ji Eun Oh...

310
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:52,448
(Ji Eun Oh)

311
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,948
And then, there's you.

312
00:21:00,988 --> 00:21:03,458
- I'm home. - You're back?

313
00:21:04,258 --> 00:21:06,498
Hey, Mom. Come here for a second.

314
00:21:06,928 --> 00:21:07,928
What is it?

315
00:21:07,998 --> 00:21:12,668
I told you not to hand-wash laundry. Your wrists are bad from the trays.

316
00:21:12,768 --> 00:21:14,298
That's why your wrists are in such bad shape.

317
00:21:15,098 --> 00:21:17,138
That's why I keep telling you to buy her a spin dryer.

318
00:21:18,268 --> 00:21:19,638
Here you go.

319
00:21:19,908 --> 00:21:20,908
What?

320
00:21:21,608 --> 00:21:24,648
You need to take care of your wrists so they don't get any worse.

321
00:21:26,278 --> 00:21:29,418
What's all this? Oh, my goodness.

322
00:21:30,018 --> 00:21:31,788
Thank you, sweetheart.

323
00:21:33,018 --> 00:21:35,058
- I'll take one right now, okay? - Okay.

324
00:21:44,328 --> 00:21:46,968
My, this makes me so happy.

325
00:21:47,268 --> 00:21:48,668
I bet they'll feel better in no time.

326
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:52,168
Hey, what about me? I carry trays, too.

327
00:21:52,938 --> 00:21:55,308
Oh, please. You can just have some milk.

328
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,648
By the way, Gang Oh.

329
00:21:57,948 --> 00:21:59,578
How was your meeting with the head office?

330
00:22:00,748 --> 00:22:02,048
They rolled out the red carpet.

331
00:22:02,348 --> 00:22:03,548
Now, I just have to look for a location.

332
00:22:04,088 --> 00:22:06,288
Oh, you're carrying yourself differently...

333
00:22:06,288 --> 00:22:07,618
now that you're the boss.

334
00:22:07,688 --> 00:22:10,588
- Look at you, all on the ball. - You know it.

335
00:22:11,488 --> 00:22:14,698
I've learned that an owner's mindset is what's really important.

336
00:22:17,828 --> 00:22:19,938
Why did he suddenly go on a business trip?

337
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:24,268
I'm sure it's for company business.

338
00:22:28,978 --> 00:22:30,178
(CEO Lee Ji Hyuk, Why the sudden trip to Tokyo?)

339
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:31,308
(I'm dying to know, so please tell me.)

340
00:22:32,778 --> 00:22:33,948
What's gotten into him?

341
00:22:34,278 --> 00:22:35,948
- What? - What's wrong?

342
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:38,048
Oh, nothing.

343
00:22:47,928 --> 00:22:50,268
This just isn't like him at all.

344
00:22:51,028 --> 00:22:53,798
He says he likes me so much, so how could he not text back?

345
00:22:55,538 --> 00:22:57,008
Did something happen at work?

346
00:22:58,568 --> 00:23:00,578
Or what if he got into an accident?

347
00:23:01,608 --> 00:23:02,608
Who got into an accident?

348
00:23:03,408 --> 00:23:04,408
You scared me!

349
00:23:05,078 --> 00:23:06,918
Ji Gang Oh, you should learn to knock.

350
00:23:07,318 --> 00:23:08,718
Who got into an accident?

351
00:23:08,718 --> 00:23:10,248
You were mumbling and couldn't hear me.

352
00:23:11,218 --> 00:23:13,458
No, it's...

353
00:23:14,088 --> 00:23:16,188
Oh, it's about Su Jeong.

354
00:23:17,328 --> 00:23:21,428
Gang Oh, there's this guy who likes Su Jeong.

355
00:23:21,928 --> 00:23:24,398
And she texted him.

356
00:23:24,868 --> 00:23:27,398
But she says he hasn't replied.

357
00:23:29,238 --> 00:23:30,308
How long has it been?

358
00:23:31,068 --> 00:23:34,108
- Three hours? - Gosh, then he's not that into her.

359
00:23:35,278 --> 00:23:37,908
No, he really does like her.

360
00:23:38,348 --> 00:23:39,748
How would you know?

361
00:23:40,448 --> 00:23:42,148
He's probably told her more than a dozen times.

362
00:23:42,578 --> 00:23:44,648
That he really likes her. That he can't give up on her.

363
00:23:45,548 --> 00:23:49,358
Women, seriously... Talk is cheap, right?

364
00:23:49,418 --> 00:23:51,428
If he likes her that much, why no reply for three hours?

365
00:23:52,088 --> 00:23:53,088
Goodness.

366
00:23:54,128 --> 00:23:55,898
So, did he read the text or not?

367
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:59,828
He read it. I mean, she said he read it.

368
00:24:02,268 --> 00:24:05,308
He's just stringing her along. He's definitely not into her.

369
00:24:06,138 --> 00:24:09,338
Is Su Jeong a fool? How old is she? Why is she even asking this?

370
00:24:13,478 --> 00:24:14,978
What would a little snot-nosed kid like you know?

371
00:24:15,478 --> 00:24:16,478
Get out!

372
00:24:17,448 --> 00:24:19,188
Wait, is this really about Su Jeong?

373
00:24:19,648 --> 00:24:21,058
Hey! I said, get out.

374
00:24:22,318 --> 00:24:23,328
But...

375
00:24:38,908 --> 00:24:40,138
Of all people, why me?

376
00:24:42,838 --> 00:24:44,648
What did I do to deserve this?

377
00:24:47,918 --> 00:24:49,578
Life was just starting to get good.

378
00:24:52,288 --> 00:24:53,858
It was finally worth living!

379
00:24:58,528 --> 00:25:00,258
There's still so much I haven't done...

380
00:25:07,598 --> 00:25:09,598
This is usually how it goes in the dramas.

381
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:15,238
Father, Mother.

382
00:25:15,978 --> 00:25:17,478
I have no intention of ever getting married.

383
00:25:17,848 --> 00:25:20,178
Why? Are you one of those types, too?

384
00:25:20,678 --> 00:25:22,278
I hear that's the trend with young people these days.

385
00:25:22,548 --> 00:25:26,248
Life's hard, so they give up on things one by one, even marriage.

386
00:25:26,418 --> 00:25:28,658
It's not giving up. For some, it's a choice.

387
00:25:28,658 --> 00:25:30,158
- I was the pathetic one, - For my generation...

388
00:25:30,828 --> 00:25:32,288
blaming my parents and the world,

389
00:25:33,088 --> 00:25:35,198
while going through life thinking I was all that.

390
00:25:36,998 --> 00:25:38,928
- Ji Hyuk. - Then I made the worst choice ever.

391
00:25:38,998 --> 00:25:39,998
Jung Bo A isn't coming.

392
00:25:40,898 --> 00:25:42,168
I didn't want to live like this.

393
00:25:42,938 --> 00:25:44,438
I didn't want to go on living like this.

394
00:25:44,938 --> 00:25:46,808
And I truly wanted to start living right.

395
00:25:48,208 --> 00:25:50,608
Do you think I don't know how much you resent, despise,

396
00:25:51,678 --> 00:25:52,748
and belittle me?

397
00:25:53,878 --> 00:25:55,348
But I still came here.

398
00:25:56,848 --> 00:25:58,218
Because I needed to survive.

399
00:25:58,218 --> 00:26:00,018
I struggled and clawed my way back.

400
00:26:00,318 --> 00:26:03,318
I never apologized for making you give up your plans to study abroad.

401
00:26:03,888 --> 00:26:05,788
For not keeping my promise,

402
00:26:06,288 --> 00:26:07,358
I'm sorry.

403
00:26:08,328 --> 00:26:09,328
Dad.

404
00:26:10,728 --> 00:26:12,098
I was wrong.

405
00:26:12,298 --> 00:26:14,338
I even reconciled with my father.

406
00:26:14,838 --> 00:26:16,398
Thanks for trusting me.

407
00:26:16,398 --> 00:26:19,568
I learned I find business most fulfilling.

408
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,178
And I achieved that.

409
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:24,278
I've liked you for a long time, and I've waited for you.

410
00:26:24,378 --> 00:26:27,348
I never even stopped to consider your feelings.

411
00:26:28,618 --> 00:26:30,848
I can't do this. I just can't do this anymore.

412
00:26:31,818 --> 00:26:33,588
I can't, because I like you too much.

413
00:26:34,758 --> 00:26:35,788
I...

414
00:26:36,488 --> 00:26:37,928
I can't let you go.

415
00:26:38,988 --> 00:26:40,728
I really think that until the day I die,

416
00:26:41,528 --> 00:26:43,028
it is only ever going to be you.

417
00:26:44,328 --> 00:26:46,868
How can I ever earn your forgiveness?

418
00:26:49,398 --> 00:26:51,038
I fell in love with you.

419
00:26:51,768 --> 00:26:53,508
And I really wanted to be with you.

420
00:27:01,878 --> 00:27:04,388
(Why the sudden trip to Tokyo? You said nothing about it at lunch.)

421
00:27:05,818 --> 00:27:06,888
Eun Oh...

422
00:27:08,488 --> 00:27:10,358
She's finally curious about me.

423
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:12,658
(I'm dying to know, so please tell me.)

424
00:27:16,698 --> 00:27:18,428
I even made up with my dad.

425
00:27:22,168 --> 00:27:24,938
My work at AP is so much fun.

426
00:27:27,808 --> 00:27:29,108
Everything is just perfect.

427
00:27:33,448 --> 00:27:35,418
Does this mean it's my time to go?

428
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:41,788
It's telling me it's time to go.

429
00:27:52,598 --> 00:27:54,938
It's his first business trip since becoming CEO.

430
00:27:55,498 --> 00:27:57,438
It makes my heart pound, honey.

431
00:27:59,108 --> 00:28:02,208
My heart's pounding too, but with worry.

432
00:28:02,908 --> 00:28:06,378
Being notified of a work trip on the same day is highly unusual.

433
00:28:06,578 --> 00:28:08,378
But I told you, his voice sounded fine.

434
00:28:09,348 --> 00:28:12,388
- Should I give him a call? - Just leave him be.

435
00:28:13,248 --> 00:28:16,588
And you need to stop worrying so much about Ji Hyuk.

436
00:28:16,888 --> 00:28:18,928
All that kid thinks about is Eun Oh.

437
00:28:21,358 --> 00:28:25,168
Then do you think he called that girl...

438
00:28:25,228 --> 00:28:26,328
to say he arrived safely in Tokyo?

439
00:28:27,098 --> 00:28:29,838
They're not officially dating yet.

440
00:28:30,368 --> 00:28:33,008
They probably just exchanged a quick text or something.

441
00:28:42,678 --> 00:28:45,218
- Have a good day, honey. - Thanks.

442
00:28:45,788 --> 00:28:47,058
What are you up to today?

443
00:28:47,958 --> 00:28:51,728
I'm organizing the budget proposal for the new scholarship recipients.

444
00:28:52,428 --> 00:28:53,698
And I'm also getting a massage.

445
00:28:54,228 --> 00:28:56,058
I thought your massage wasn't today.

446
00:28:56,998 --> 00:29:01,168
I'm getting an extra one this week. Winter's making my skin dry,

447
00:29:01,238 --> 00:29:02,398
and I just feel sluggish.

448
00:29:03,268 --> 00:29:04,338
Good, you should.

449
00:29:04,638 --> 00:29:06,108
Make sure you get the full treatment.

450
00:29:12,178 --> 00:29:14,818
He's the kind of person who just agrees to anything.

451
00:29:16,818 --> 00:29:20,588
Woo Jin, what excuse could I possibly have for letting you go?

452
00:29:22,618 --> 00:29:25,388
Hey, Attorney Choi. I need to get some legal advice.

453
00:29:25,458 --> 00:29:26,458
It's rather urgent.

454
00:29:27,128 --> 00:29:29,858
Yes, it's something we should talk about in person.

455
00:29:31,198 --> 00:29:32,568
I need you to make time before you leave work.

456
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:36,438
Did you find out the date of Woo Jin's outpatient appointment?

457
00:29:37,438 --> 00:29:38,438
In ten days?

458
00:29:39,308 --> 00:29:40,578
She's going to change the appointment.

459
00:29:42,008 --> 00:29:43,778
Just let me get in touch with Woo Jin.

460
00:29:44,678 --> 00:29:45,948
You think I won't go...

461
00:29:45,948 --> 00:29:49,118
to Dongwoo Hospital in Busan with no number?

462
00:29:49,178 --> 00:29:51,648
You can go, but you won't be able to see him.

463
00:29:51,988 --> 00:29:53,588
I've already made all the arrangements.

464
00:29:54,658 --> 00:29:58,288
Put more men on it tomorrow. And watch for appointment changes.

465
00:30:01,028 --> 00:30:04,928
Why do you think ten is enough, Ms. Shin?

466
00:30:07,168 --> 00:30:09,798
Double the men at every entrance to that hospital.

467
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:16,108
Why can't she just get it the first time?

468
00:30:17,078 --> 00:30:19,408
You can go, but you won't be able to see him.

469
00:30:19,948 --> 00:30:21,478
I've already made all the arrangements.

470
00:30:24,488 --> 00:30:27,388
First, she could change the appointment date.

471
00:30:27,488 --> 00:30:29,818
Second, she'll post bodyguards.

472
00:30:30,888 --> 00:30:32,728
What else could there be?

473
00:30:32,888 --> 00:30:36,228
What makes you so smugly confident?

474
00:30:39,428 --> 00:30:44,568
The reason you transferred hospitals within Korea, Woo Jin,

475
00:30:45,068 --> 00:30:48,308
is that you cannot fly for three months after your surgery.

476
00:30:51,148 --> 00:30:53,178
I'll have to look into booking flights, then.

477
00:30:57,618 --> 00:30:59,048
What on earth are you going to do?

478
00:31:01,088 --> 00:31:03,618
Why are you asking? You said you'd quit.

479
00:31:04,528 --> 00:31:06,358
Mind your own business and just hand in your resignation.

480
00:31:07,128 --> 00:31:09,658
How can I possibly resign in a situation like this?

481
00:31:10,928 --> 00:31:13,938
- "A situation like this?" - You want to forgive her, right?

482
00:31:14,598 --> 00:31:18,268
Then forgive her. But if you do, just tell us.

483
00:31:18,868 --> 00:31:21,438
Have you considered your children who have to watch, knowing it all?

484
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:24,708
Now is not the time.

485
00:31:25,108 --> 00:31:29,278
No one's going to blame you for staying with her, Dad.

486
00:31:29,648 --> 00:31:31,888
Why do you sound like you're giving me permission?

487
00:31:32,218 --> 00:31:33,648
I just need to know for sure.

488
00:31:35,158 --> 00:31:36,958
So I can decide whether to resign or not.

489
00:31:38,428 --> 00:31:41,928
So you can't bring yourself to leave because you worry about your dad?

490
00:31:44,768 --> 00:31:46,568
(CEO Lee Ji Hyuk)

491
00:31:46,728 --> 00:31:50,808
He still hasn't texted me back. Don't you think that's a bit much?

492
00:31:51,908 --> 00:31:55,678
You're right. That is weird. He always texts back immediately.

493
00:31:56,308 --> 00:31:58,608
Or maybe he's just swamped with work?

494
00:31:59,348 --> 00:32:01,748
No, if he were busy, he could just text, "Sorry, busy."

495
00:32:01,818 --> 00:32:04,318
Is he really too busy to send two words?

496
00:32:04,718 --> 00:32:05,748
You've got a point.

497
00:32:06,548 --> 00:32:08,118
He's making me worry.

498
00:32:10,758 --> 00:32:12,888
You've really got Ji Hyuk on your mind.

499
00:32:13,228 --> 00:32:15,628
What? No...

500
00:32:15,928 --> 00:32:18,398
How could I not worry when he's acting so weird?

501
00:32:19,368 --> 00:32:21,138
It feels like he's blowing me off.

502
00:32:22,938 --> 00:32:25,208
If he ignores this one too, I'm seriously done.

503
00:32:27,108 --> 00:32:29,838
If you don't answer this time, I'm going to be really mad.

504
00:32:30,378 --> 00:32:34,478
What do you want from me, Ji Hyuk? Is it that hard to text back?

505
00:32:36,378 --> 00:32:37,748
Yes, it is, Eun Oh.

506
00:32:40,818 --> 00:32:42,118
It's just too hard.

507
00:32:49,358 --> 00:32:51,468
"Why are you rushing me?"

508
00:32:52,598 --> 00:32:53,668
Su Jeong.

509
00:32:54,668 --> 00:32:56,438
Is this really Ji Hyuk?

510
00:32:56,538 --> 00:32:59,008
This is ridiculous. Why are you rushing me?

511
00:32:59,008 --> 00:33:02,638
- I'm busy. - I know. That's so unlike Ji Hyuk.

512
00:33:03,138 --> 00:33:05,708
Maybe someone's with him and messing with you?

513
00:33:07,718 --> 00:33:09,378
What are you talking about? He's on a business trip alone.

514
00:33:10,118 --> 00:33:12,088
No, this is totally his way of talking.

515
00:33:21,758 --> 00:33:23,968
(Power off)

516
00:33:27,968 --> 00:33:30,038
(Power off)

517
00:33:35,408 --> 00:33:36,438
Eun Oh.

518
00:33:37,778 --> 00:33:39,648
I have a very serious heart condition.

519
00:33:40,548 --> 00:33:42,218
They say I need a heart transplant.

520
00:33:44,248 --> 00:33:45,448
Mom, Dad.

521
00:33:47,048 --> 00:33:49,288
They say I have to get a heart transplant.

522
00:33:50,688 --> 00:33:52,628
My heart has become enlarged,

523
00:33:53,328 --> 00:33:54,698
and they say it's not functioning properly.

524
00:34:04,938 --> 00:34:05,938
This is...

525
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:09,608
a succession memorandum to restore your status as contracted author.

526
00:34:10,308 --> 00:34:14,878
Mr. Lee Ji Wan, do you acknowledge Ms. Park is the author, Freedom?

527
00:34:17,078 --> 00:34:18,088
Yes.

528
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:20,088
Bye.

529
00:34:24,758 --> 00:34:26,958
Congratulations, Author Freedom.

530
00:34:29,698 --> 00:34:32,898
Ji Wan, hearing someone other than you...

531
00:34:32,968 --> 00:34:36,498
call me "Author Freedom" made me feel so weird.

532
00:34:37,098 --> 00:34:38,468
You'll get used to it.

533
00:34:41,608 --> 00:34:44,778
Now that I've signed the contract, I should get right to work.

534
00:34:45,008 --> 00:34:46,008
Right.

535
00:34:46,278 --> 00:34:48,748
You get to work. I have plans with some friends,

536
00:34:48,848 --> 00:34:50,018
so I'll be out for an hour or two.

537
00:34:50,548 --> 00:34:51,548
What?

538
00:34:52,388 --> 00:34:53,718
You're leaving now?

539
00:34:57,218 --> 00:35:00,458
Fine. I have to work anyway.

540
00:35:00,828 --> 00:35:01,828
See you later.

541
00:35:07,938 --> 00:35:08,998
What is this?

542
00:35:10,038 --> 00:35:12,108
Who makes plans on our last day together?

543
00:35:14,008 --> 00:35:16,438
Shouldn't he be having a farewell party with me?

544
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:21,978
He just ditches me now that I don't need his protection.

545
00:35:31,688 --> 00:35:34,498
Now that I'm drawing them, the characters look a lot like us.

546
00:35:36,998 --> 00:35:40,168
That's silly. A long-haired woman and a bodyguard-type guy...

547
00:35:40,228 --> 00:35:41,338
are a pretty common trope.

548
00:35:47,008 --> 00:35:50,578
After today, I really won't see him again.

549
00:35:55,518 --> 00:35:57,048
But what's taking him so long to get back?

550
00:35:59,348 --> 00:36:00,918
Yeong Ra! Hey, Yeong Ra!

551
00:36:01,218 --> 00:36:02,958
- Come on out for one second! - Okay.

552
00:36:02,958 --> 00:36:04,588
- Hurry up and come out! - Okay, I'm coming!

553
00:36:10,198 --> 00:36:11,428
Surprise!

554
00:36:14,038 --> 00:36:16,698
(Congratulations on the contract, Author Freedom!)

555
00:36:21,808 --> 00:36:24,078
Ji Wan, what is all this?

556
00:36:24,548 --> 00:36:26,908
Park Yeong Ra, congratulations...

557
00:36:26,908 --> 00:36:28,518
on your first contract signed on your own.

558
00:36:29,248 --> 00:36:30,378
Quick, blow out the candles.

559
00:36:33,748 --> 00:36:36,618
Today's the day you officially became an author.

560
00:36:37,358 --> 00:36:38,928
I couldn't go without throwing you a party to celebrate.

561
00:36:40,428 --> 00:36:41,428
This is so beautiful.

562
00:36:42,598 --> 00:36:44,898
So this is why you went out earlier?

563
00:36:45,428 --> 00:36:49,638
Tiptoeing to hide all this from you, I nearly got a cramp in my calf.

564
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:52,438
I'm so touched.

565
00:37:02,048 --> 00:37:04,248
And it's our farewell party, too.

566
00:37:06,788 --> 00:37:07,788
I guess it is.

567
00:37:12,328 --> 00:37:15,158
You must be cold. I'll get you a coat.

568
00:37:16,298 --> 00:37:18,528
(Congratulations on the contract, Author Freedom!)

569
00:37:28,238 --> 00:37:30,038
Here's to the debut of Author Freedom.

570
00:37:30,478 --> 00:37:31,848
Here's to your last day at work...

571
00:37:35,748 --> 00:37:37,118
Is that something to celebrate?

572
00:37:44,158 --> 00:37:45,958
You really worked so hard, Ji Wan.

573
00:37:48,098 --> 00:37:49,558
I do have one regret, though.

574
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,268
I never got to teach you self-defense.

575
00:37:53,428 --> 00:37:54,568
I should have,

576
00:37:54,568 --> 00:37:56,668
so you could go out in the world on your own, worry-free.

577
00:37:57,508 --> 00:37:58,508
Without being afraid.

578
00:37:59,508 --> 00:38:02,138
I'm not scared anymore. You've seen it yourself.

579
00:38:02,638 --> 00:38:04,508
I know how to track locations now,

580
00:38:04,778 --> 00:38:06,448
and I can even disguise myself to go undercover.

581
00:38:07,678 --> 00:38:12,088
You're right. You used to be terrified of every little thing.

582
00:38:12,718 --> 00:38:13,788
You've changed so much.

583
00:38:15,518 --> 00:38:17,658
I thought you were really weird at first.

584
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:20,688
Right away, you were like, "How old are you?"

585
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:27,028
How old? I'm asking how old you are.

586
00:38:28,238 --> 00:38:30,368
I'll have to ask my mom and get back to you on that.

587
00:38:30,498 --> 00:38:32,768
You have to ask your mom just to tell me your own age?

588
00:38:34,808 --> 00:38:37,478
Man, I was thinking, "Wow, I've never met such a brat."

589
00:38:39,548 --> 00:38:42,048
That's not really a question for you to be asking.

590
00:38:42,878 --> 00:38:46,648
There are exceptions and special cases in this world.

591
00:38:48,688 --> 00:38:51,558
That was back when I was living under my mom's thumb.

592
00:38:53,558 --> 00:38:54,558
Right.

593
00:38:55,428 --> 00:38:58,298
The world you lived in seemed so completely different.

594
00:38:58,498 --> 00:39:00,768
You seemed a little clueless.

595
00:39:01,398 --> 00:39:02,968
I've changed a lot, thanks to you.

596
00:39:03,898 --> 00:39:04,908
That's not it.

597
00:39:05,238 --> 00:39:08,208
You were always like that. You just didn't realize it.

598
00:39:10,208 --> 00:39:11,378
And what kind of person is that?

599
00:39:15,378 --> 00:39:17,518
You're passionate about the things you love.

600
00:39:17,588 --> 00:39:20,788
You're deeply caring and know how to appreciate others.

601
00:39:21,318 --> 00:39:23,158
And you have a bold side to you, too...

602
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:25,328
That's the kind of person you are.

603
00:39:27,088 --> 00:39:28,858
I just thought I had become prickly,

604
00:39:29,228 --> 00:39:30,698
but I guess I had that side to me all along.

605
00:39:33,598 --> 00:39:36,738
Thanks for helping me discover a part of myself I never knew.

606
00:39:45,808 --> 00:39:49,148
It's nothing. I just figured it out while I was your bodyguard.

607
00:39:49,348 --> 00:39:53,618
(Congratulations on the contract, Author Freedom!)

608
00:39:58,528 --> 00:39:59,528
Ji Wan.

609
00:40:01,398 --> 00:40:03,458
So, what are we now?

610
00:40:06,728 --> 00:40:08,368
What do you mean, "What are we?"

611
00:40:09,498 --> 00:40:10,768
What kind of question is that?

612
00:40:14,038 --> 00:40:15,708
We're friends now, right?

613
00:40:18,008 --> 00:40:21,018
At first, you were Seong Jae's friend's little brother.

614
00:40:22,248 --> 00:40:23,378
Then a bodyguard and...

615
00:40:23,818 --> 00:40:24,818
The young lady?

616
00:40:27,018 --> 00:40:28,018
And after that...

617
00:40:30,158 --> 00:40:33,058
We broke some rules together and tailed my mom.

618
00:40:33,188 --> 00:40:35,898
And you even helped me brainstorm my webtoon's plot.

619
00:40:37,698 --> 00:40:40,198
So, we're friends now, right?

620
00:40:43,438 --> 00:40:44,438
Of course.

621
00:40:44,808 --> 00:40:47,438
After all we've been through? Of course, we're friends.

622
00:40:47,908 --> 00:40:48,908
No, actually.

623
00:40:49,778 --> 00:40:50,778
We're comrades-in-arms.

624
00:41:21,308 --> 00:41:22,438
Aren't you taking that with you?

625
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:25,648
It's a gift.

626
00:41:25,978 --> 00:41:28,548
When you feel stuck on your webtoon, come out and have some coffee.

627
00:41:28,878 --> 00:41:29,878
Once the weather warms up.

628
00:41:30,578 --> 00:41:31,588
Thank you.

629
00:41:32,488 --> 00:41:33,488
You should get going.

630
00:41:34,688 --> 00:41:35,988
I will, once my designated driver gets here.

631
00:41:36,318 --> 00:41:37,758
I need to see you get inside safely first.

632
00:41:38,388 --> 00:41:39,888
Your shift is over.

633
00:41:40,488 --> 00:41:41,658
Just for today, you go first.

634
00:41:42,158 --> 00:41:43,358
I can handle this myself.

635
00:41:45,298 --> 00:41:47,668
Still... You've been drinking, though.

636
00:41:48,068 --> 00:41:50,298
I guess I can hold my liquor. I'm not even tipsy.

637
00:41:50,938 --> 00:41:51,938
I'm serious.

638
00:41:53,938 --> 00:41:55,408
I want to be the one to see you off.

639
00:42:02,918 --> 00:42:04,988
All right. I'll head out first.

640
00:42:07,658 --> 00:42:08,918
When will I see you again?

641
00:42:10,888 --> 00:42:12,988
I'm sure we'll see each other around.

642
00:42:14,028 --> 00:42:17,128
If we're friends, then I can call you whenever, right?

643
00:42:20,328 --> 00:42:21,338
I should get going.

644
00:42:28,108 --> 00:42:30,108
Why didn't he answer me?

645
00:42:33,748 --> 00:42:35,718
I guess he doesn't want to keep in touch.

646
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:43,018
Fine, then.

647
00:42:44,058 --> 00:42:45,058
Don't look back.

648
00:42:49,328 --> 00:42:50,328
Don't look back.

649
00:42:56,938 --> 00:42:59,738
I'm not looking back. Do not look back, Lee Ji Wan.

650
00:43:00,468 --> 00:43:02,678
If you look back now, you're a fool.

651
00:43:03,208 --> 00:43:05,748
Friends? Yes, right. It's over.

652
00:43:06,408 --> 00:43:08,448
Besides, Seong Jae and Su Bin were mixed up in this, too.

653
00:43:09,418 --> 00:43:11,088
Take care, Yeong Ra.

654
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:13,388
She'll be fine.

655
00:43:23,298 --> 00:43:25,568
But why does she keep weighing on my mind?

656
00:43:34,008 --> 00:43:36,808
Your stats are stable, so you can be discharged.

657
00:43:36,808 --> 00:43:38,278
But you can't overdo it.

658
00:43:39,748 --> 00:43:40,748
Doctor.

659
00:43:41,348 --> 00:43:43,318
In the next month or two,

660
00:43:43,978 --> 00:43:47,318
the chances of a heart transplant becoming available for me...

661
00:43:48,088 --> 00:43:49,088
are slim, right?

662
00:43:50,218 --> 00:43:54,558
That's not something I can predict. However,

663
00:43:55,228 --> 00:43:56,528
you have to stay hopeful.

664
00:44:04,168 --> 00:44:06,608
Mr. Lee is coming straight to the office after landing.

665
00:44:08,238 --> 00:44:09,308
Welcome back, Mr. Lee.

666
00:44:12,448 --> 00:44:15,248
- Welcome back, Mr. Lee. - Yes. Has everyone been doing well?

667
00:44:21,288 --> 00:44:23,588
Mr. Lee, did you have a good trip?

668
00:44:25,428 --> 00:44:27,388
Cheol Min, can you get me that thing?

669
00:44:27,788 --> 00:44:28,798
Yes, sir.

670
00:44:29,128 --> 00:44:30,128
Oh, right.

671
00:44:30,458 --> 00:44:33,468
About the job for my father... We've decided to call it off.

672
00:44:34,368 --> 00:44:35,568
Oh, really?

673
00:44:36,768 --> 00:44:37,768
I'm in for it now.

674
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:56,758
Cheol Min, what about that thing I asked for?

675
00:45:02,798 --> 00:45:04,828
- Thanks. - Of course, sir.

676
00:45:06,698 --> 00:45:07,698
All right.

677
00:45:17,378 --> 00:45:19,278
Yes? What is it?

678
00:45:19,578 --> 00:45:22,318
Did I do something wrong that day?

679
00:45:24,418 --> 00:45:25,548
What day are you talking about?

680
00:45:25,888 --> 00:45:27,118
The day you left for your trip.

681
00:45:27,648 --> 00:45:30,858
The day before yesterday. When we had lunch together.

682
00:45:33,528 --> 00:45:34,528
I have no memory of that.

683
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:37,258
Then why are you being like this to me?

684
00:45:38,468 --> 00:45:40,468
The text I sent... Did you have to reply like that?

685
00:45:40,528 --> 00:45:45,438
Send me the final Image House files. I need to take care of that today.

686
00:45:46,438 --> 00:45:49,538
Gosh, I have so much to get through today.

687
00:45:54,618 --> 00:45:57,248
So, can you send me those files right away?

688
00:46:14,528 --> 00:46:16,998
Why is he being so cold?

689
00:46:17,668 --> 00:46:19,368
Did I really do something wrong?

690
00:46:19,838 --> 00:46:21,738
If he likes her that much, why no reply for three hours?

691
00:46:22,138 --> 00:46:24,208
Gosh, then he's not that into her.

692
00:46:28,378 --> 00:46:29,378
Don't tell me...

693
00:46:30,448 --> 00:46:32,948
Don't tell me he got tired of me in just three days.

694
00:46:43,458 --> 00:46:44,598
Mom, Dad.

695
00:46:46,368 --> 00:46:47,798
My tastes have changed.

696
00:46:49,638 --> 00:46:50,798
I don't like salty food anymore.

697
00:46:51,968 --> 00:46:54,008
I do not care for soups or stews either.

698
00:46:55,238 --> 00:46:56,338
At work,

699
00:46:56,938 --> 00:46:59,208
something has come up that requires my full attention.

700
00:47:02,078 --> 00:47:03,078
But that...

701
00:47:04,248 --> 00:47:05,588
Why would I have to tell you that?

702
00:47:09,188 --> 00:47:10,218
When you're the CEO,

703
00:47:11,258 --> 00:47:12,658
you're bound to have secrets.

704
00:47:16,658 --> 00:47:18,228
I'd prefer we keep things strictly business.

705
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:22,838
Ms. Ji Eun Oh.

706
00:47:32,078 --> 00:47:33,078
This looks delicious.

707
00:47:34,178 --> 00:47:36,678
I was rushed, so I grabbed these at the duty-free.

708
00:47:37,848 --> 00:47:38,848
These are delicious.

709
00:47:39,288 --> 00:47:41,688
Hey, what about the gift I asked for?

710
00:47:42,388 --> 00:47:44,158
You asked him for a gift?

711
00:47:44,558 --> 00:47:46,228
He was on a last-minute trip, and you asked him for a present?

712
00:47:46,688 --> 00:47:48,628
Dad, it's okay. Don't be hard on him.

713
00:47:50,258 --> 00:47:52,268
I just didn't have the time to get it.

714
00:47:53,568 --> 00:47:55,238
You could've tried to make some time, though.

715
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:58,138
Hey, kids, you all keep eating.

716
00:47:58,568 --> 00:48:01,238
My daughter's been feeling a little down,

717
00:48:01,878 --> 00:48:05,208
my wife's worked so hard her wrist hurts,

718
00:48:05,578 --> 00:48:09,378
my eldest son's tired from his trip, and Ji Wan has had a long day.

719
00:48:09,948 --> 00:48:14,148
- So I'll do the dishes tonight. - Dad, come on. That's not fair.

720
00:48:14,488 --> 00:48:17,488
It's fine. Just enjoy your snacks and tangerines.

721
00:48:24,358 --> 00:48:26,368
Dad, don't worry. I'll do them.

722
00:48:26,428 --> 00:48:29,938
Why would the guy who just got back from a three-day trip do the dishes?

723
00:48:30,098 --> 00:48:31,468
Go get some rest. Go on.

724
00:48:33,138 --> 00:48:36,578
Dad, about that whole Disaster Prevention Room scam...

725
00:48:37,308 --> 00:48:38,408
"Scam?"

726
00:48:38,908 --> 00:48:41,378
Well, since I tried to pull strings to get you in,

727
00:48:41,678 --> 00:48:42,678
it was basically a scam.

728
00:48:43,578 --> 00:48:46,918
About that, you were right, Dad.

729
00:48:47,748 --> 00:48:48,818
He'll be taking over for me.

730
00:48:49,318 --> 00:48:51,488
Everyone, please greet Chief Director Oh Jae Jin.

731
00:48:51,688 --> 00:48:56,128
Right. He's actually my only son.

732
00:48:56,758 --> 00:48:59,328
Out of greed, I had him start as an intern...

733
00:48:59,568 --> 00:49:02,168
and work his way up to learn the ropes.

734
00:49:02,168 --> 00:49:03,498
Please be understanding.

735
00:49:05,938 --> 00:49:07,208
I'm Oh Jae Jin.

736
00:49:08,008 --> 00:49:11,238
I had forgotten how that made me feel.

737
00:49:12,948 --> 00:49:15,318
It wasn't fair, no matter how you look at it.

738
00:49:16,778 --> 00:49:20,548
That's right. Yes, you were in the wrong for that.

739
00:49:21,218 --> 00:49:22,218
And...

740
00:49:22,888 --> 00:49:25,088
I got a job.

741
00:49:26,028 --> 00:49:27,028
What?

742
00:49:27,428 --> 00:49:29,158
I said, I got a job.

743
00:49:29,498 --> 00:49:30,858
I got a call from the disaster control room...

744
00:49:30,858 --> 00:49:32,298
of a mixed-use building.

745
00:49:33,098 --> 00:49:34,098
For real?

746
00:49:34,598 --> 00:49:36,838
Gosh, I should have just waited a few more days.

747
00:49:37,498 --> 00:49:40,008
That's what I'm saying, kid. I told you I'd handle it myself,

748
00:49:40,238 --> 00:49:42,808
so why did you have to go groveling to other people?

749
00:49:43,238 --> 00:49:47,278
Parents and children should each do their best in their lives, son.

750
00:49:48,418 --> 00:49:49,918
Hey, Mom!

751
00:49:50,178 --> 00:49:53,918
Come on, if Dad got a job, you should've told me right away!

752
00:49:54,048 --> 00:49:56,188
- What did you say? - Really?

753
00:49:56,258 --> 00:49:57,258
Awesome!

754
00:49:58,288 --> 00:49:59,288
My gosh!

755
00:50:00,428 --> 00:50:02,358
Honey, you got a job?

756
00:50:03,098 --> 00:50:05,068
Yes, I did.

757
00:50:05,368 --> 00:50:07,168
Dad, why didn't you tell us?

758
00:50:07,368 --> 00:50:10,068
I was going to tell everyone at once when the whole family was here.

759
00:50:10,568 --> 00:50:11,638
I don't think so.

760
00:50:12,068 --> 00:50:14,138
You wanted to brag to your eldest son, didn't you?

761
00:50:14,538 --> 00:50:16,738
Come on, I wanted to be the one to tell him.

762
00:50:16,738 --> 00:50:19,448
If I told anyone else in the family, word would've gotten out right away.

763
00:50:22,278 --> 00:50:24,018
When did you hear from them?

764
00:50:24,518 --> 00:50:26,448
Right when Ji Hyuk was leaving for his trip.

765
00:50:27,688 --> 00:50:30,858
Are you kidding me? How did you keep it in for three days?

766
00:50:31,158 --> 00:50:33,558
It's not that big of a deal.

767
00:50:33,888 --> 00:50:37,098
What do you mean it's not a big deal?

768
00:50:37,298 --> 00:50:41,428
You finally got a job as an electrical technician. Right?

769
00:50:42,068 --> 00:50:44,668
It is a huge deal. Congratulations, Dad.

770
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:47,738
- You really pulled it off. - Congratulations, Dad!

771
00:50:47,738 --> 00:50:49,838
Hey, my hands are all wet. Go on, get away.

772
00:50:49,908 --> 00:50:51,708
Have Ji Wan do the dishes, Dad.

773
00:50:51,978 --> 00:50:54,308
Oh, Yes? Buying me a celebration drink?

774
00:50:55,648 --> 00:50:58,918
Well, that's... I'm sorry.

775
00:50:59,348 --> 00:51:01,448
I was in meetings all night in Tokyo.

776
00:51:01,658 --> 00:51:06,228
What was I thinking? You're tired. Go on, get some rest. Yes, go.

777
00:51:06,288 --> 00:51:07,288
Okay.

778
00:51:09,098 --> 00:51:13,028
Gosh, our family now has no worries. Nothing at all.

779
00:51:13,098 --> 00:51:14,328
Don't you wish every day was like today?

780
00:51:14,328 --> 00:51:18,308
- Yes. It's nice to finally relax. - Right?

781
00:51:18,368 --> 00:51:20,908
Mom, I'm still unemployed, you know?

782
00:51:21,538 --> 00:51:23,338
You have the security firm interview.

783
00:51:23,338 --> 00:51:24,838
You'll get in, no problem.

784
00:51:25,308 --> 00:51:28,548
- You'd better ace it this time. - Mind your own business.

785
00:51:28,618 --> 00:51:31,448
- Don't come home unless you get in. - Why don't you move out?

786
00:51:42,958 --> 00:51:43,958
This is nice.

787
00:51:47,268 --> 00:51:48,338
I've got a great family.

(All voice recordings)

789
00:52:04,848 --> 00:52:07,918
Just leaving work? Why were you at the office so late?

790
00:52:09,318 --> 00:52:10,658
Because I didn't want to go home.

791
00:52:11,318 --> 00:52:13,188
You should meet up with someone and vent.

792
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:14,758
Do you want me to come over?

793
00:52:16,158 --> 00:52:17,598
But we broke up.

794
00:52:19,028 --> 00:52:21,028
Eun Oh is still recovering,

795
00:52:22,098 --> 00:52:23,968
so I can't ask her to go for a drink.

796
00:52:25,538 --> 00:52:27,138
And since Ji Hyuk is your brother,

797
00:52:28,438 --> 00:52:30,538
I can't ask him out for a drink either.

798
00:52:30,978 --> 00:52:33,478
Seong Jae, you're really in a tough spot.

801

I love this spot. I didn't realize it was near your office.

802
00:53:39,948 --> 00:53:40,948
Su Bin?

803
00:53:48,018 --> 00:53:50,158
- Su Bin. - Is this guy nuts?

804
00:53:54,988 --> 00:53:56,128
Hey, are you okay?

805
00:53:59,968 --> 00:54:03,938
Hey! Stop right there! Did you just shove my Seong Jae?

806
00:54:10,408 --> 00:54:11,408
Su Bin.

807
00:54:35,868 --> 00:54:37,968
My gosh...

808
00:55:17,408 --> 00:55:18,478
What is all this?

809
00:55:19,448 --> 00:55:22,348
Honey, don't you need to take these documents?

00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:41,128
Honey.

813
00:55:42,538 --> 00:55:43,668
Please, just listen to me.

814
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:46,308
If you're still here when I get home,

815
00:55:47,338 --> 00:55:51,108
just imagine what will happen. I left the documents there for you.

From start to finish,

823

he's found out everything.

824
00:56:49,568 --> 00:56:50,898
Park Jin Seok, you jerk.

825
00:56:52,238 --> 00:56:53,408
How did he find out?

826
00:56:54,408 --> 00:56:55,678
How could he have found out?

827
00:57:03,878 --> 00:57:05,348
Right, no problems so far?

828
00:57:06,788 --> 00:57:08,248
Are you sure the first step is complete?

829
00:57:09,918 --> 00:57:11,118
Then prepare for the next step.

830
00:57:22,168 --> 00:57:23,198
Mother.

831
00:57:24,038 --> 00:57:25,608
So you're Eun Oh's birth mother?

832
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:28,538
Woo Jin had a liver transplant?

833
00:57:28,878 --> 00:57:31,078
I found you out, and Woo Jin found you out.

834
00:57:32,908 --> 00:57:34,708
And it looks like Yeong Ra has caught on, too.

835
00:57:35,148 --> 00:57:37,118
Just make absolutely sure Dad never finds out.

836
00:57:39,788 --> 00:57:42,188
After saying that, he snitched to his dad?

837
00:57:45,488 --> 00:57:47,428
But he was acting totally normal up until yesterday.

838
00:57:49,028 --> 00:57:50,028
No.

839
00:57:50,828 --> 00:57:52,498
He must have known for a few days.

840
00:57:55,898 --> 00:57:58,808
Then why blindside me today and tell me to get out?

841
00:57:59,938 --> 00:58:02,108
Does he want a divorce, or does he want me to beg?

842
00:58:02,638 --> 00:58:05,008
Of course, I did. You know me better than that.

843
00:58:05,678 --> 00:58:09,818
The people I hate most are cheaters. Liars.

844
00:58:10,118 --> 00:58:13,988
Woo Jin's on winter break, isn't he? You talk to him often, don't you?

845
00:58:14,518 --> 00:58:16,518
"Often?" You know how sons are.

846
00:58:16,918 --> 00:58:18,488
I think I spoke with him this past Monday.

847
00:58:21,458 --> 00:58:23,328
He knew Woo Jin took a leave of absence...

848
00:58:24,028 --> 00:58:25,768
and that he dropped out, but he still asked.

849
00:58:26,728 --> 00:58:28,368
And I walked right into his trap.

850
00:58:30,568 --> 00:58:32,738
Why would he wait this long to spring it on me?

851
00:58:34,368 --> 00:58:35,378
So that's it.

852
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:38,208
Park Jin Seok, you've always had a ruthless side.

853
00:58:39,408 --> 00:58:41,408
That's why I was always so careful.

854
00:58:42,418 --> 00:58:43,618
It was like walking on thin ice.

855
00:58:44,378 --> 00:58:48,018
I poured my blood, sweat, and tears to make that thin ice solid.

856
00:58:51,988 --> 00:58:53,058
But even if I beg,

857
00:58:53,958 --> 00:58:55,528
there's no guarantee he'll back down.

858
00:59:00,998 --> 00:59:02,268

Hey, let's go for a bike ride then.

880
01:00:41,468 --> 01:00:44,798
You said a hard ride clears the head and that it's exhilarating, right?

881
01:00:46,338 --> 01:00:48,038
Why does it have to be exercise?

882
01:00:50,508 --> 01:00:51,608
It's too cold. I don't want to.

883
01:00:53,048 --> 01:00:54,078
I can't today.

884
01:00:54,408 --> 01:00:56,878
Can't you tell I'm busy? I'm here working on a Saturday.

885
01:00:57,348 --> 01:00:58,718
Then don't work today.

886
01:00:59,618 --> 01:01:02,358
- Why shouldn't I? - Why do you say no to everything?

887
01:01:02,988 --> 01:01:06,158
Hey, have I ever pestered you to do this or that with me?

888
01:01:06,688 --> 01:01:08,458
Have I ever been this clingy with you before?

889
01:01:11,998 --> 01:01:15,398
I feel so suffocated I think I'm going to lose my mind.

890
01:01:18,238 --> 01:01:19,738
I miss Su Bin so much.

891
01:01:20,938 --> 01:01:23,278
I want to call her. I want to go see her.

892
01:01:23,608 --> 01:01:25,078
That alone is driving me crazy,

893
01:01:26,108 --> 01:01:27,778
but on top of that, my family's a complete mess.

894
01:01:28,408 --> 01:01:31,048
Hey, I have no room to breathe.

895
01:01:34,218 --> 01:01:35,218
I can imagine.

896
01:01:36,058 --> 01:01:37,058
Exactly.

897
01:01:37,658 --> 01:01:39,888
So you need to take some responsibility too, man.

898
01:01:40,688 --> 01:01:42,558
You were so against it. Have you no shame?

899
01:01:43,058 --> 01:01:45,058
Shouldn't you be the one helping me get through this?

900
01:01:46,728 --> 01:01:49,798
- I know. - Then why won't you?

901
01:01:52,408 --> 01:01:53,538
It's not that I won't. I just can't.

902
01:01:56,478 --> 01:01:59,678
Come on, no matter how busy you are, you can't spare me a few hours?

903
01:02:01,348 --> 01:02:02,548
I can't exercise.

904
01:02:05,048 --> 01:02:06,318
Why not?

905
01:02:25,638 --> 01:02:26,638
Hey.

906
01:02:27,708 --> 01:02:28,708
Hey.

907
01:02:30,638 --> 01:02:31,638
Hey, are you...

908
01:02:32,278 --> 01:02:33,708
Are you crying?

909
01:02:34,878 --> 01:02:35,878
Darn it.

910
01:02:38,248 --> 01:02:39,248
Hey.

911
01:02:40,848 --> 01:02:42,048
In a few days...

912
01:02:42,688 --> 01:02:43,718
Fine.

913
01:02:44,858 --> 01:02:45,958
Seong Jae,

914
01:02:46,588 --> 01:02:47,788
I was going to tell you anyway.

915
01:02:53,768 --> 01:02:55,498
You're going to have to clean up after me.

916
01:02:58,968 --> 01:02:59,968
What are you talking about?

917
01:03:02,508 --> 01:03:03,508
I need you to...

918
01:03:08,578 --> 01:03:09,978
help me die with dignity.

919
01:03:25,058 --> 01:03:27,968
Always leave an escape route, even when you're cornering a rat.

920
01:03:28,628 --> 01:03:30,168
Does he really think I'll just get on my knees and beg?

924
01:04:42,608 --> 01:04:45,638
I realize now that I completely misunderstood you.

925
01:04:45,638 --> 01:04:50,548
- What if I told you I like you? - But I'm only telling you.

926
01:04:50,618 --> 01:04:53,048
Heart transplant waiting list... Why were you looking that up?

927
01:04:53,118 --> 01:04:56,358
You think we can be friends again, like nothing happened?

928
01:04:56,458 --> 01:04:59,018
- Showing up here like this... - What do you want?

929
01:04:59,018 --> 01:05:00,388
Didn't I tell you not to show me that face...

930
01:05:00,388 --> 01:05:01,728
- when I walk in? - Let go!

931
01:05:01,828 --> 01:05:03,428
Mom, what are you going to do?

932
01:05:03,658 --> 01:05:08,268
Darn it... Is that jerk crazy? Hey! Park Yeong Ra!

933
01:05:08,428 --> 01:05:09,568
Park Jin Seok!

934
01:05:10,368 --> 01:05:12,738
You're a lot more dangerous than I thought.
