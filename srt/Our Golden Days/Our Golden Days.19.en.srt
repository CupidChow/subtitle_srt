00:00:01,851 --> 00:00:03,851
(Episode 19)

2
00:00:05,407 --> 00:00:06,467
Really?

3
00:00:06,737 --> 00:00:10,337
Yes. It's a match for the liver transplant.

4
00:00:11,307 --> 00:00:12,607
It's a match?

5
00:00:14,677 --> 00:00:15,847
I knew it.

6
00:00:18,217 --> 00:00:20,147
Let's discuss the next steps in person.

7
00:00:21,147 --> 00:00:22,557
Thank you for everything, Dr. Yoon.

8
00:00:29,757 --> 00:00:30,757
What a relief.

9
00:01:02,527 --> 00:01:06,167
Happy birthday to you

10
00:01:06,227 --> 00:01:09,897
Happy birthday to you

11
00:01:09,967 --> 00:01:13,567
Happy birthday to you

12
00:01:14,737 --> 00:01:16,707
Make a wish first.

13
00:01:22,447 --> 00:01:23,847
She has a boyfriend?

14
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:25,647
She got a boyfriend?

15
00:01:27,017 --> 00:01:29,287
When did she even meet a guy?

16
00:01:29,287 --> 00:01:30,857
Seong Jae didn't seem to know either.

17
00:01:32,027 --> 00:01:34,757
Celebrating a boyfriend's birthday at a convenience store?

18
00:01:35,297 --> 00:01:37,257
That's so Ji Eun Oh, being a total cheapskate.

19
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:39,067
I can tell she's showing off her skills.

20
00:01:39,427 --> 00:01:41,667
Convenience store food hacks. That's her specialty.

21
00:01:42,067 --> 00:01:43,667
Yes, believe it or not.

22
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:47,537
What if Ji Eun Oh has a boyfriend? Why shouldn't she? It's possible.

23
00:01:55,547 --> 00:01:58,717
- Oh, my. - Why are you taking pictures?

24
00:01:58,987 --> 00:02:02,387
This is a very special moment for me.

25
00:02:02,387 --> 00:02:03,657
It's amazing.

26
00:02:05,787 --> 00:02:10,057
I bet you think it'll taste weird. It doesn't. Go on, try it.

27
00:02:10,557 --> 00:02:11,557
Really?

28
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:15,067
All right.

29
00:02:19,407 --> 00:02:22,707
- It looks weird, but it's so good! - I know, right?

30
00:02:23,307 --> 00:02:25,707
- Here, try this one too. - Okay. Thank you.

31
00:02:26,207 --> 00:02:27,207
Let's see...

32
00:02:33,417 --> 00:02:36,657
Ms. Ji, there's something I've been wanting to ask you.

33
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:39,827
Why are you always looking out for me?

34
00:02:40,287 --> 00:02:43,227
I'm just some older guy you've run into a few times.

35
00:02:49,267 --> 00:02:50,437
My dad...

36
00:02:51,637 --> 00:02:54,137
He used to run a business, but it went bankrupt.

37
00:02:54,567 --> 00:02:55,777
When I was a high school freshman.

38
00:02:57,807 --> 00:03:00,577
Before that, thanks to my dad, I got to learn everything.

39
00:03:01,507 --> 00:03:04,977
Piano, taekwondo, ballet, drawing, skiing, cycling...

40
00:03:05,387 --> 00:03:07,547
And my dad taught me how to jump rope.

41
00:03:10,287 --> 00:03:11,287
My dad...

42
00:03:11,987 --> 00:03:13,627
You can't imagine how hard he tried...

43
00:03:14,557 --> 00:03:16,557
to keep the business from going under.

44
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:19,997
It would've been understandable if he'd collapsed from overwork.

45
00:03:20,727 --> 00:03:23,367
But instead, he started going out at the crack of dawn.

46
00:03:25,707 --> 00:03:28,067
I thought he was out looking for another job,

47
00:03:29,437 --> 00:03:31,737
but it took me a while to find out what was really happening.

48
00:03:33,307 --> 00:03:35,677
My dad's hands were covered in calluses,

49
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:40,487
and I saw that his shoulders were raw and red.

50
00:03:43,617 --> 00:03:44,857
That's when I realised.

51
00:03:46,657 --> 00:03:49,497
My dad was never going to get back on his feet.

52
00:03:51,057 --> 00:03:52,197
And that for our sake,

53
00:03:53,127 --> 00:03:56,367
he was doing gruelling day-labour jobs.

54
00:03:59,867 --> 00:04:01,067
So that's what happened.

55
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:05,777
He worked like that for two years before he collapsed,

56
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:08,717
and it was terminal pancreatic cancer.

57
00:04:10,577 --> 00:04:12,617
I can't imagine how much pain he must have endured.

58
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:15,857
Just a week after his diagnosis,

59
00:04:17,317 --> 00:04:18,387
he passed away.

60
00:04:20,487 --> 00:04:21,557
My goodness.

61
00:04:22,297 --> 00:04:23,997
That's why, when I look at you,

62
00:04:25,157 --> 00:04:28,997
a man whose palms were once soft and smooth...

63
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:34,907
I know what it takes to endure and study for that exam.

64
00:04:36,537 --> 00:04:38,137
Because my dad was the same way.

65
00:04:40,777 --> 00:04:43,277
Still, your father...

66
00:04:44,247 --> 00:04:45,787
He was a very lucky man.

67
00:04:47,817 --> 00:04:50,287
Not many children understand their parents that deeply.

68
00:04:50,887 --> 00:04:52,287
Especially a daughter so young.

69
00:05:02,537 --> 00:05:04,697
Only give me the files I need to see.

70
00:05:04,697 --> 00:05:05,767
Otherwise, just text me.

71
00:05:05,837 --> 00:05:06,967
Because I am not in the mood.

72
00:05:08,437 --> 00:05:10,637
Mr. Jo wants to know the results.

73
00:05:12,947 --> 00:05:13,947
Results?

74
00:05:15,747 --> 00:05:16,877
The cafe makeover.

75
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:18,947
I didn't get to ask about that.

76
00:05:20,117 --> 00:05:23,357
What is Ji Eun Oh thinking, with such a crucial matter at hand?

77
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,157
A birthday party for her boyfriend at a convenience store?

78
00:05:29,197 --> 00:05:30,227
This is so frustrating.

79
00:05:30,527 --> 00:05:33,897
Of all people, why a guy like that? And what is Seong Jae doing?

80
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:35,027
That fool.

81
00:05:37,597 --> 00:05:38,607
Goodness.

82
00:05:39,707 --> 00:05:40,707
But...

83
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:44,077
What brought you here at that hour, Ms. Ji?

84
00:05:46,147 --> 00:05:49,317
I just wanted to have a beer and clear my head.

85
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:52,117
Mr. Lee.

86
00:05:52,387 --> 00:05:54,387
Can I ask you something?

87
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:55,757
Of course.

88
00:05:56,657 --> 00:05:59,787
I got a really great offer.

89
00:06:00,757 --> 00:06:02,297
It's like a shared office.

90
00:06:02,697 --> 00:06:04,497
But I'll be sharing the office with someone I'm uncomfortable with.

91
00:06:05,097 --> 00:06:06,097
The thing is...

92
00:06:06,427 --> 00:06:09,297
I'll probably have to share it with them for a long time.

93
00:06:10,237 --> 00:06:11,467
Why are you uncomfortable?

94
00:06:11,937 --> 00:06:16,107
He must be a real piece of work for you to dislike him, Ms. Ji.

95
00:06:17,337 --> 00:06:18,337
No.

96
00:06:18,777 --> 00:06:20,577
I don't dislike him anymore.

97
00:06:21,377 --> 00:06:22,877
It's kind of a long story, but...

98
00:06:23,147 --> 00:06:24,677
Anyway, I was finally over it,

99
00:06:25,387 --> 00:06:27,117
and things were just starting to feel comfortable again.

100
00:06:27,947 --> 00:06:32,927
But just as I was feeling better, he started acting weird,

101
00:06:32,987 --> 00:06:34,287
making things awkward.

102
00:06:35,327 --> 00:06:36,327
Let me guess.

103
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:37,997
An ex?

104
00:06:39,067 --> 00:06:41,227
No, we never dated.

105
00:06:42,897 --> 00:06:45,337
I told him I liked him, but he turned me down.

106
00:06:46,437 --> 00:06:47,437
My goodness.

107
00:06:47,737 --> 00:06:49,877
That guy must be blind or something.

108
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:53,347
How could he reject you, Ms. Ji? What a fool.

109
00:06:54,777 --> 00:06:55,877
Mr. Lee.

110
00:06:56,477 --> 00:06:59,247
Would you mind not calling me that?

111
00:07:00,017 --> 00:07:03,217
You're Ms. Ji. What else am I supposed to call you?

112
00:07:03,357 --> 00:07:05,117
You can just call me Eun Oh.

113
00:07:05,427 --> 00:07:07,687
What? No, I couldn't...

114
00:07:09,727 --> 00:07:12,067
Then how about you call me by my nickname?

115
00:07:12,567 --> 00:07:13,567
The Spring.

116
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:17,197
It was my nickname in high school. The Spring, like the resilient coil.

117
00:07:17,997 --> 00:07:19,007
The Spring?

118
00:07:19,437 --> 00:07:21,437
That fits you perfectly.

119
00:07:21,967 --> 00:07:23,777
It tells me how you've lived your life.

120
00:07:24,307 --> 00:07:26,077
That nickname sums it all up.

121
00:07:26,407 --> 00:07:27,407
So, what do you think?

122
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:29,947
"Hey, Spring! The Spring."

123
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:32,717
All right, then.

124
00:07:33,087 --> 00:07:35,347
You're young enough to be my kid,

125
00:07:35,347 --> 00:07:37,957
but it was still awkward for me to call you by your first name.

126
00:07:38,457 --> 00:07:41,557
But a nickname, I can do. The Spring.

127
00:07:43,457 --> 00:07:45,767
What about you? Did you have a nickname?

128
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:49,197
Me? I was such a nerd in school. I didn't really have a nickname...

129
00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:50,937
or at least none that stuck.

130
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:53,207
Though I was considered handsome back in the day,

131
00:07:53,567 --> 00:07:55,777
so people did call me Paul Newman a few times.

132
00:07:56,437 --> 00:07:58,037
Mr. Paul Newman.

133
00:07:58,707 --> 00:08:00,307
But that's...

134
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:03,817
no different from just calling you Mr. Lee Sang Cheol, right?

135
00:08:06,147 --> 00:08:08,247
I'll give you a nickname.

136
00:08:09,017 --> 00:08:10,717
How about Mr. Early?

137
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:13,127
Mr. Early? What does that even mean?

138
00:08:13,357 --> 00:08:17,457
You're a surprisingly early adopter. You're so good with your phone.

139
00:08:17,727 --> 00:08:21,527
That's just because I needed it. I looked it up and taught myself.

140
00:08:21,897 --> 00:08:24,097
It's short for "Mister Early Adopter."

141
00:08:24,097 --> 00:08:25,167
Don't you like it?

142
00:08:26,467 --> 00:08:29,107
Goodness. Hanging out with you youngsters...

143
00:08:29,107 --> 00:08:30,537
is a whole new experience.

144
00:08:31,007 --> 00:08:34,677
Okay! Mr. Early. I'm saving it in my phone.

145
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:37,817
Anyway, back to what you, Ms. Ji...

146
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:42,117
I mean, the Spring. What you asked about earlier.

147
00:08:42,417 --> 00:08:44,157
What matters more? Your discomfort with him?

148
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:45,627
Or the work opportunity?

149
00:08:46,857 --> 00:08:48,827
The work is more important.

150
00:08:48,897 --> 00:08:53,667
Then power through the awkwardness. Act like nothing ever happened.

151
00:08:54,397 --> 00:08:57,337
Ignoring them is the best revenge.

152
00:08:58,297 --> 00:09:01,567
I wouldn't call it revenge, but...

153
00:09:02,437 --> 00:09:05,037
I've already been ignoring him for a while now.

154
00:09:05,137 --> 00:09:06,207
There you go then.

155
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:09,347
He's not family, so who cares if it's uncomfortable?

156
00:09:09,947 --> 00:09:11,117
Work comes first.

157
00:09:12,417 --> 00:09:14,887
You want to know what's painfully awkward?

158
00:09:15,387 --> 00:09:16,617
It's when someone like that is family.

159
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:21,487
You're right. Family.

160
00:09:23,157 --> 00:09:24,227
I get it now.

161
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:28,797
My gosh, it feels so good to get all that off my chest.

162
00:09:30,037 --> 00:09:31,697
That's just how people are.

163
00:09:31,697 --> 00:09:34,007
Sometimes, it's much easier to open up...

164
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:37,477
to someone who isn't tangled up in your life.

165
00:09:37,807 --> 00:09:42,577
That's why people go to monks, priests, and pastors,

166
00:09:42,717 --> 00:09:45,277
or therapists for counselling, you know?

167
00:09:45,747 --> 00:09:48,717
You're right. It's like when you told me...

168
00:09:48,787 --> 00:09:51,117
about your son who ran away from home.

169
00:09:52,757 --> 00:09:55,797
You just remind me of my son who ran away.

170
00:09:55,857 --> 00:09:59,467
I hope my son gets help like this...

171
00:09:59,627 --> 00:10:01,067
when he's having a hard time.

172
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:03,637
Yes, that's right.

173
00:10:04,097 --> 00:10:07,907
I told you things back then that I'd never told anyone else.

174
00:10:09,177 --> 00:10:11,507
Hey, how about we make a deal?

175
00:10:12,377 --> 00:10:14,807
We'll just listen. No questions asked.

176
00:10:15,507 --> 00:10:18,017
When we have something hard to tell the people in our lives.

177
00:10:18,477 --> 00:10:20,617
It's an automatic secret between us, right?

178
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:22,417
An automatic secret?

179
00:10:23,717 --> 00:10:25,457
Yes. I guess it would be, wouldn't it?

180
00:10:27,657 --> 00:10:28,727
Do we have a deal, Mr. Early?

181
00:10:29,357 --> 00:10:31,557
- Deal, Ms. Spring. - Cheers.

182
00:10:34,827 --> 00:10:36,667
My own family doesn't understand how I feel,

183
00:10:37,097 --> 00:10:38,397
but a stranger does.

184
00:10:38,767 --> 00:10:40,767
And of all people, a young woman like her.

185
00:10:41,937 --> 00:10:43,507
This is a birthday I'll never forget.

186
00:10:44,207 --> 00:10:46,247
I even made a friend across the generations.

187
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:54,817
Hey, honey!

188
00:10:55,347 --> 00:10:56,357
Da Jeong!

189
00:10:58,787 --> 00:10:59,787
Honey...

190
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:05,397
Honey...

191
00:11:06,897 --> 00:11:07,897
What...

192
00:11:10,467 --> 00:11:11,467
Honey...

193
00:11:12,637 --> 00:11:13,767
Close the door.

194
00:11:17,637 --> 00:11:19,177
You scared me.

195
00:11:19,177 --> 00:11:21,877
Why are you sitting here in the dark?

196
00:11:23,077 --> 00:11:25,847
Didn't you hear me calling for you in the alley just now?

197
00:11:26,187 --> 00:11:27,247
I heard you.

198
00:11:27,717 --> 00:11:30,657
Then why did you just ignore me and rush inside?

199
00:11:32,217 --> 00:11:33,557
Because I was about to cuss you out.

200
00:11:34,987 --> 00:11:35,997
Cuss me out?

201
00:11:36,297 --> 00:11:38,097
You were humming a tune.

202
00:11:38,757 --> 00:11:41,497
I wonder what you did that made you come home humming to yourself.

203
00:11:42,597 --> 00:11:43,937
Hey, honey.

204
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,567
The only way that makes sense is if you were with another woman.

205
00:11:46,867 --> 00:11:49,437
The Lee Sang Cheol I know wouldn't stoop that low.

206
00:11:49,977 --> 00:11:54,147
But then again, maybe you would. Since you lie so easily.

207
00:11:55,207 --> 00:11:56,577
Are you seeing another woman?

208
00:11:57,547 --> 00:11:58,547
Come on...

209
00:11:59,017 --> 00:12:01,587
What on earth are you talking about? This is coming out of nowhere.

210
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:02,817
So you're not seeing another woman?

211
00:12:03,357 --> 00:12:04,617
Then is there something you want to tell me?

212
00:12:04,917 --> 00:12:06,187
Nothing at all?

213
00:12:07,057 --> 00:12:09,327
I honestly have no idea...

214
00:12:09,327 --> 00:12:11,457
why you're acting like this right now.

215
00:12:12,227 --> 00:12:15,297
Is this because I didn't come home for my birthday dinner?

216
00:12:15,697 --> 00:12:18,567
I went to the academy today with a meal I packed for you.

217
00:12:19,967 --> 00:12:23,407
Mother worried you'd eat a cold meal all by yourself on your birthday.

218
00:12:24,407 --> 00:12:26,447
You only go there on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, don't you?

219
00:12:26,877 --> 00:12:28,347
And it's always been that way?

220
00:12:29,117 --> 00:12:32,047
Honey, look, what happened was...

221
00:12:32,117 --> 00:12:34,147
How could you lie to me like that?

222
00:12:35,587 --> 00:12:37,317
You lied.

223
00:12:37,317 --> 00:12:39,927
No matter how you slice it, you lied.

224
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:44,597
You said you were studying all week, staying late for night study,

225
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:47,097
but you only went three times a week and worked part-time?

226
00:12:47,097 --> 00:12:48,867
After promising to study and do nothing else for a year?

227
00:12:49,337 --> 00:12:51,497
That's what you promised me.

228
00:12:55,977 --> 00:12:58,837
It's already a long shot even if he does nothing but study.

229
00:12:59,907 --> 00:13:02,207
He's got way too much pride for his own good.

230
00:13:04,647 --> 00:13:06,217
And Mom must be so upset. What is she going to do?

231
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:13,187
Honey, let's sit down and talk first. I'm sorry, but...

232
00:13:13,687 --> 00:13:15,587
Please, lower your voice a little.

233
00:13:15,897 --> 00:13:17,457
You'll wake up Mother.

234
00:13:19,197 --> 00:13:20,497
I admit...

235
00:13:21,097 --> 00:13:23,497
I lied to you, and I'm truly sorry for that, but...

236
00:13:24,497 --> 00:13:28,407
Honey, I passed the written exam after only one month of class.

237
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:29,837
All while working that part-time job, you see?

238
00:13:30,107 --> 00:13:31,107
I know.

239
00:13:31,437 --> 00:13:32,677
Good for you.

240
00:13:33,477 --> 00:13:34,647
Honey, come on.

241
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:38,147
You didn't tell me the exam date, and you didn't tell me you passed.

242
00:13:38,847 --> 00:13:39,887
Lee Sang Cheol.

243
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:44,317
What exactly do you take me for? Am I even your wife?

244
00:13:45,987 --> 00:13:47,227
About the part-time job...

245
00:13:47,687 --> 00:13:51,057
I'm the man of the house. I couldn't live with myself...

246
00:13:51,327 --> 00:13:53,367
just spending money and not earning any.

247
00:13:53,727 --> 00:13:57,337
And as for the exam, I was going to tell you after I passed.

248
00:13:57,767 --> 00:13:59,837
But right when I was about to tell you,

249
00:14:00,267 --> 00:14:02,037
Ji Hyuk walked in.

250
00:14:02,307 --> 00:14:03,837
In front of our son, who's so proud...

251
00:14:03,837 --> 00:14:05,137
and won't even tell us about his business,

252
00:14:05,877 --> 00:14:09,477
it felt pathetic boasting about passing some silly written test.

253
00:14:10,377 --> 00:14:12,277
So you couldn't tell me because of Ji Hyuk?

254
00:14:13,447 --> 00:14:15,387
Honey, isn't that a bit much?

255
00:14:16,117 --> 00:14:20,287
Right. You wouldn't get it. It's a guy thing.

256
00:14:20,987 --> 00:14:23,027
Anyway, I'm sorry. I really am.

257
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:28,897
Gosh, why is this so complicated?

258
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,297
Men are so hard to figure out.

259
00:14:48,947 --> 00:14:50,517
This is a mess.

260
00:14:52,087 --> 00:14:54,287
Seriously, how am I supposed to share the building with her?

261
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:56,927
Eun Oh will probably back out.

262
00:14:57,227 --> 00:14:58,397
Renovating it means...

263
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,297
we're stuck together for who knows how long.

264
00:15:00,397 --> 00:15:01,527
She'd never agree, not with me.

What brings you here?

268
00:15:15,577 --> 00:15:18,477
I wanted to talk about Hyeon Su's proposal.

269
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:19,887
Perfect timing.

270
00:15:20,187 --> 00:15:21,887

Let me go first.

273
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:34,797
About Hyeon Su's proposal yesterday,

274
00:15:35,097 --> 00:15:36,097
I'm going to accept it.

275
00:15:36,397 --> 00:15:38,437
It's exactly what I need right now.

276
00:15:41,137 --> 00:15:42,137
Me too.

277
00:15:43,577 --> 00:15:44,577
What?

278
00:15:45,037 --> 00:15:46,177
I'm accepting it too.

279
00:15:46,707 --> 00:15:51,117
If we split, we'll wall the door and make separate entrances.

280
00:15:54,617 --> 00:15:56,017
You've really thought this through.

281
00:15:57,257 --> 00:16:00,257
- Down to how we'd split up. - Of course.

282
00:16:01,357 --> 00:16:05,857
So you're considering working in the same building as me?

283
00:16:06,667 --> 00:16:08,467
Is there any reason I shouldn't?

284
00:16:10,337 --> 00:16:11,367
A reason?

285
00:16:19,307 --> 00:16:20,307
Mr. Lee.

286
00:16:22,947 --> 00:16:24,847
Why are you staring at me like that?

287
00:16:24,847 --> 00:16:25,917
Me?

288
00:16:27,247 --> 00:16:29,357
No, I had something on my mind,

289
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:31,457
so I was just spacing out,

290
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:34,457
and I guess your face happened to be in the way.

291
00:16:35,857 --> 00:16:36,857
Excuse me?

292
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:38,427
I should get going.

293
00:16:38,757 --> 00:16:40,967
I'll come back later with some ideas.

294
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:42,267
Hold on!

295
00:16:44,067 --> 00:16:45,437
Hey, wait a second!

296
00:16:47,467 --> 00:16:49,137

Gosh, that's a load off my mind.

300
00:17:10,227 --> 00:17:13,467
From today, you two are in charge of clearing out the cafe.

301
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:16,697
- Can I count on you to do that? - Of course.

302
00:17:16,837 --> 00:17:19,667
But since it's my cafe, I'll help pay for the demolition.

303
00:17:20,107 --> 00:17:22,307
Then we'll gladly take you up on that offer.

304
00:17:23,037 --> 00:17:25,877
- But still... - Eun Oh.

305
00:17:26,277 --> 00:17:28,077
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

Let's not argue about it.

307
00:17:31,977 --> 00:17:35,817
Okay. Then we gratefully accept your help.

308
00:17:38,387 --> 00:17:41,727
Yes! I'm finally free from Ji Eun Oh.

309
00:17:41,857 --> 00:17:45,127
Hey, I'm booking my Barcelona ticket, okay?

310
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:48,227

saving money.

312
00:17:51,397 --> 00:17:53,807
I'm a little hurt you're this excited to leave.

313
00:17:53,867 --> 00:17:55,737
You should at least stick around to help clear out the cafe.

314
00:17:55,807 --> 00:17:59,377
Of course. Then, let's close up shop quickly.

315
00:17:59,747 --> 00:18:03,447
It's better to start construction sooner rather than later, you know?

Well, Ms. Ji...

After the Suri-dong meeting, I think a week should be enough.

- Right this way, please. - Okay.

00:18:35,607 --> 00:18:36,617

00:18:42,647 --> 00:18:43,787
All right.

These are the final blueprints reflecting everything we agreed on.

327

The kitchen will be the master bedroom.

328
00:18:49,957 --> 00:18:52,357
Next to it, the attic stairs will go,

329
00:18:52,427 --> 00:18:54,497
and a dressing room and a bathroom go in.

330
00:18:54,497 --> 00:18:56,967
And the living room extends to here.

331
00:18:57,537 --> 00:18:59,507
I'm most excited about...

332
00:18:59,507 --> 00:19:00,767
the combined kitchen and living room.

333
00:19:01,867 --> 00:19:04,777
Even with the new rental unit, we still have two bathrooms...

334
00:19:04,837 --> 00:19:07,247
and a floor-seating tea room over here.

335
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:08,847
My husband is absolutely thrilled.

336
00:19:08,977 --> 00:19:10,247
You mean here?

337
00:19:12,077 --> 00:19:16,657
Also, I'll have a ramp built for the entryway in advance.

338
00:19:16,987 --> 00:19:20,587
That way, it will be accessible if you ever need a wheelchair.

339
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:24,627
A floor-seating tea room? And she's planning for a wheelchair?

340
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,267
Ji Eun Oh really looks like she's in her element.

341
00:19:33,707 --> 00:19:35,937
Hey, Su Jeong. Is that coffee ready yet?

342
00:19:41,107 --> 00:19:42,847
We need to move on this as fast as possible.

343
00:19:43,077 --> 00:19:45,947
My gosh, you really want to fast-track this.

344
00:19:46,217 --> 00:19:48,647
We'll have to change the company name...

345
00:19:48,647 --> 00:19:50,287
and build a new website too.

346
00:19:51,217 --> 00:19:54,027
You don't say much, Cheol Min, but you're always on the ball.

347
00:19:55,927 --> 00:19:57,727
Wait, you're changing the company name?

348
00:19:58,457 --> 00:20:00,727
But I like the name, Mamdaerozip.

349
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:04,897
We're keeping Mamdaerozip. Just a new company and logo.

350
00:20:05,867 --> 00:20:08,837
Aren't you scared? We don't have any investments yet.

351
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:10,407
We'll get the investment.

352
00:20:10,837 --> 00:20:12,577
More importantly, we need to hire more people, Mr. Jo.

353
00:20:13,407 --> 00:20:15,407
I'll be tied up with the exhibition and funding,

354
00:20:15,407 --> 00:20:17,677
so I won't be around much. You can't handle it all by yourself.

355
00:20:18,177 --> 00:20:19,817
I'm already in over my head.

356
00:20:20,247 --> 00:20:21,687
I'm already running on fumes!

357
00:20:22,217 --> 00:20:23,487
Let's just hire two more people for now.

358
00:20:24,687 --> 00:20:27,627
Right. We're flooded with turnkey requests,

359
00:20:27,787 --> 00:20:29,187
so we really need a site manager.

360
00:20:29,597 --> 00:20:33,067
I'll handle the Series B funding and look for an exhibition venue.

361
00:20:33,127 --> 00:20:34,397
I'm counting on you both.

362
00:20:35,227 --> 00:20:36,237
Okay.

363
00:20:37,467 --> 00:20:40,307
Ji Eun Oh's liver is in excellent condition.

364
00:20:40,837 --> 00:20:42,367
The size is adequate,

365
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,407
and the vascular structure is normal.

366
00:20:45,237 --> 00:20:49,147
So there's nothing stopping her from donating for the transplant?

367
00:20:49,547 --> 00:20:52,887
Correct. As long as she consents.

368
00:20:53,687 --> 00:20:54,947
She'll agree.

369
00:20:55,517 --> 00:20:57,987
It looks like my part in this is over.

370
00:20:58,617 --> 00:21:01,527
What happens next is in your hands, Ms. Ko.

371
00:21:02,997 --> 00:21:03,997
I know.

372
00:21:05,427 --> 00:21:06,967
My life is on the line.

373
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:10,567
- You should tell Ji Eun Oh right... - The time isn't right.

374
00:21:11,197 --> 00:21:12,797
It's not a race against the clock,

375
00:21:13,267 --> 00:21:14,607
but the sooner, the better.

376
00:21:14,867 --> 00:21:18,277
As you know, I can't just spring this on her.

377
00:21:19,407 --> 00:21:20,947
I need a little more time.

378
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:23,547
I have other family matters to attend to as well.

379
00:21:23,877 --> 00:21:27,117
Then, please contact me once you have her consent.

380
00:21:27,847 --> 00:21:28,887
I must say I'm curious.

381
00:21:30,617 --> 00:21:31,657
Yes, Dr. Yoon.

382
00:21:33,827 --> 00:21:36,187
The donation to the hospital will be wired today.

383
00:21:36,627 --> 00:21:38,427
Right, thank you.

What?

387
00:21:55,407 --> 00:21:56,417
Yes, Director Ko.

388
00:21:56,547 --> 00:21:58,347
The weather's been so lovely.

389
00:21:58,347 --> 00:22:00,917
There's this gallery show, and the interior design is amazing.

390
00:22:01,117 --> 00:22:03,657
I hoped we could go together and talk a little business.

391
00:22:04,287 --> 00:22:06,927
Are you available today? Or if not, how about tomorrow?

392
00:22:10,057 --> 00:22:11,527
I'm sorry, Director Ko.

393
00:22:12,157 --> 00:22:15,367
I'm afraid a project I'm on has gotten rather busy.

394
00:22:15,627 --> 00:22:16,697
What am I thinking?

395
00:22:17,037 --> 00:22:20,637
I'm the one who said to take it slow and focus on your other work.

396
00:22:21,607 --> 00:22:23,637
I guess the great weather made me forget.

397
00:22:23,907 --> 00:22:26,747
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to rush you,

398
00:22:26,847 --> 00:22:28,147
so please don't worry, and get back to work.

399
00:22:29,007 --> 00:22:30,017
All right.

400
00:22:32,147 --> 00:22:34,647
Gosh, she was quick to turn me down.

401
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:39,357
I know my impatience just backfires. Why do I still make that mistake?

402
00:22:40,427 --> 00:22:42,727
Seriously, get it together.

403
00:22:49,527 --> 00:22:52,067
Director Ko, Curator Kim So Mi is here.

404
00:22:52,897 --> 00:22:54,067
Send her in.

(The Garden of Lingering Hearts)

406
00:22:57,237 --> 00:22:58,407
The poster looks great.

407
00:22:58,707 --> 00:22:59,777
It turned out really well.

408
00:23:00,277 --> 00:23:04,377
Please check the pamphlet draft too. I revised it based on your feedback.

409
00:23:10,217 --> 00:23:11,857
How are the promotions coming along?

410
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:21,497
We'll need a CEO's office, an office for about six people,

411
00:23:21,727 --> 00:23:23,897
a conference room, a kitchen, a lounge,

412
00:23:24,197 --> 00:23:25,897
and a space to display materials.

413
00:23:26,607 --> 00:23:27,807
What kind of materials?

414
00:23:28,767 --> 00:23:30,337
We're setting up a materials showroom,

415
00:23:30,337 --> 00:23:32,177
and I want HQ to have a sample room too.

416
00:23:33,577 --> 00:23:36,347
A general materials showroom? Out of the blue?

417
00:23:37,147 --> 00:23:39,347
It's not out of the blue. Anyway, it'll be done.

418
00:23:40,347 --> 00:23:43,017
The company name is going to change. Mamdaerozip becomes an affiliate.

419
00:23:43,087 --> 00:23:44,787
And what about an office for you?

420
00:23:46,727 --> 00:23:49,857
Doesn't a comprehensive showroom require a lot of capital?

421
00:23:50,057 --> 00:23:52,527
We'll have to find investors. When will the first draft be ready?

422
00:23:52,997 --> 00:23:56,597
- I can have it ready in two days. - Let's meet then.

423
00:23:57,237 --> 00:23:58,267
Bye.

424
00:24:17,057 --> 00:24:18,787
What is he, Don Quixote or some kind of goblin?

425
00:24:19,727 --> 00:24:21,757
A full-scale showroom, just like that?

426
00:24:24,357 --> 00:24:26,327
What? Why are you coming out this way?

427
00:24:27,727 --> 00:24:29,227
I was just about to leave, but...

428
00:24:30,437 --> 00:24:32,267
I just couldn't pretend I didn't see him.

429
00:24:32,997 --> 00:24:35,437
- See what? - Your boyfriend.

430
00:24:36,737 --> 00:24:37,937
My boyfriend?

431
00:24:38,007 --> 00:24:39,877
You celebrated his birthday with Choco Pies...

432
00:24:39,877 --> 00:24:41,107
outside a convenience store.

433
00:24:42,607 --> 00:24:45,677
I happened to be passing by and saw it all.

434
00:24:47,147 --> 00:24:49,587
He's not my boyfriend. He's just a friend.

435
00:24:49,687 --> 00:24:53,157
"A friend?" Don't make me laugh. Since when do you have friends here?

436
00:24:55,387 --> 00:24:56,727
What if I just made one?

437
00:24:57,927 --> 00:24:59,597
No, look. Just look at yourself right now.

438
00:25:00,197 --> 00:25:02,167
You can't even bring yourself to admit you have a boyfriend.

439
00:25:02,867 --> 00:25:07,137
For your birthday or his, I mean... Sitting at a convenience store?

440
00:25:07,367 --> 00:25:10,707
Why would you date a guy like that? That's just not right.

441
00:25:11,777 --> 00:25:13,147
What's not right?

442
00:25:13,207 --> 00:25:15,047
A birthday party at a convenience store is wrong.

443
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:17,117
What are you, a kid?

444
00:25:18,277 --> 00:25:19,647
Come on, seriously.

445
00:25:20,017 --> 00:25:22,147
You should date someone decent and respectable.

446
00:25:22,947 --> 00:25:23,987
If you're going to date at all.

447
00:25:25,157 --> 00:25:27,627
I've told you he's not my boyfriend. Why are you so insistent?

448
00:25:27,727 --> 00:25:29,627
Same difference if he's just a "guy friend."

449
00:25:29,997 --> 00:25:31,997
Come on, what's this about men and women being "just friends?"

450
00:25:32,727 --> 00:25:34,367
You'd be better off with Seong Jae.

451
00:25:34,927 --> 00:25:37,597
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

452
00:25:37,967 --> 00:25:40,137
I said he wasn't my boyfriend, and that should be the end of it.

453
00:25:40,507 --> 00:25:43,877
Why would I lie that he's not my boyfriend when he is?

454
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:47,877
Besides, Why do you care if we're together?

455
00:25:48,107 --> 00:25:52,247
Whether it was stacking Choco Pies or cakes, I had a great time.

456
00:25:52,747 --> 00:25:55,417
That's exactly the problem. That childish mindset of yours.

457
00:25:56,387 --> 00:25:58,487
You're still so naive about how the world works.

458
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:00,627
Seriously, what is with you?

459
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:03,797
Hey. What do you even know about me...

460
00:26:03,857 --> 00:26:06,527
to be lecturing me about my life? Am I your little sister?

461
00:26:06,597 --> 00:26:07,667
You were my junior once!

462
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:12,167
That was a long time ago. Why are you still bringing that up?

463
00:26:13,337 --> 00:26:14,837
Don't cross the line.

464
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:16,937
Did you forget the terms of our partnership?

465
00:26:19,677 --> 00:26:22,347
You and I are business partners, Mr. Lee Ji Hyuk.

466
00:26:22,477 --> 00:26:26,377
Do business partners have the right to meddle...

467
00:26:26,947 --> 00:26:28,247
in each other's private lives? Do they?

468
00:26:36,427 --> 00:26:41,427
If you interfere one more time, I swear I won't let it slide.

469
00:26:52,837 --> 00:26:54,577
Go talk over there, you brat.

470
00:26:55,377 --> 00:26:56,377
A brat?

471
00:26:56,717 --> 00:26:58,047
Did you just call me a brat?

472
00:26:58,477 --> 00:27:00,417
Are you ever going to fix the way you talk?

473
00:27:01,017 --> 00:27:03,357
Be careful who you trust. Especially men.

474
00:27:03,557 --> 00:27:05,087
Have you forgotten what I put you through?

475
00:27:05,787 --> 00:27:06,957
I'm just worried about you.

476
00:27:07,887 --> 00:27:09,487
Just don't make the same mistake again.

477
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,927
I mean, in just the few months I've been gone?

478
00:27:14,497 --> 00:27:16,167
See? That's exactly why it's so dangerous.

479
00:27:18,397 --> 00:27:19,637
Gosh, whatever.

480
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:33,647
Be careful who you trust. Especially men.

481
00:27:33,917 --> 00:27:35,517
Have you forgotten what I put you through?

482
00:27:36,117 --> 00:27:37,387
I'm just worried about you.

483
00:27:38,557 --> 00:27:40,457
He's worried?

484
00:27:43,187 --> 00:27:44,357
Who does he think he is,

485
00:27:44,957 --> 00:27:46,327
acting like he's my guardian?

486
00:27:49,897 --> 00:27:51,667
Were you always this selfish?

487
00:27:52,167 --> 00:27:54,007
That's only what you think.

488
00:27:54,537 --> 00:27:58,407
You might trust yourself, but I don't trust you.

489
00:27:58,507 --> 00:28:01,477
I won't get tangled up in business with someone I don't trust.

490
00:28:02,077 --> 00:28:04,277
I'd rather we just be strangers.

491
00:28:04,547 --> 00:28:08,787
Ji Eun Oh. I might be someone you resent forever,

492
00:28:09,017 --> 00:28:10,557
but you're still simply Ji Eun Oh to me.

493
00:28:12,217 --> 00:28:13,887
"Simply Ji Eun Oh?"

494
00:28:14,657 --> 00:28:17,397
Does he not hate me?

495
00:28:18,157 --> 00:28:22,197
Usually, when someone hates you, you hate them right back.

496
00:28:22,927 --> 00:28:24,537
So why is he worried about me?

497
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:26,297
When I'm trying so hard to push him away.

498
00:28:28,607 --> 00:28:29,767
This is so frustrating.

499
00:28:30,637 --> 00:28:32,607
Let her throw a party at a convenience store. Who cares?

500
00:28:33,847 --> 00:28:35,747
Why does she have to keep getting prettier?

501
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:41,717
Ji Eun Oh scares me. She revoked my senior privileges,

502
00:28:41,787 --> 00:28:42,787
and she won't give them back.

503
00:28:44,187 --> 00:28:45,717
Who do I have to blame but myself?

504
00:28:46,087 --> 00:28:48,357
Our eyes met while I was on the altar...

505
00:28:54,227 --> 00:28:57,167
(Shoealls)

506
00:28:58,067 --> 00:29:00,437
My friend and his wife got back from Europe...

507
00:29:00,437 --> 00:29:01,937
raved about your shoes.

508
00:29:02,167 --> 00:29:05,177
Is that right? Are you planning a trip too?

509
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:07,947
- Yes, we're going on a cruise. - A cruise? How exciting!

510
00:29:08,677 --> 00:29:11,717
You know, a cruise isn't just about staying on the ship.

511
00:29:11,817 --> 00:29:14,787
You get off at ports and spend all day exploring the city,

512
00:29:15,047 --> 00:29:16,647
so comfortable shoes are an absolute must.

513
00:29:17,687 --> 00:29:21,187
Look, I'm on my feet all day, and they never hurt.

514
00:29:21,327 --> 00:29:22,987
Are the shoes you're wearing from here too?

515
00:29:23,057 --> 00:29:26,157
Yes. Would you like to pick some out?

516
00:29:26,967 --> 00:29:29,197
There are so many. Could you recommend a few for me?

517
00:29:31,637 --> 00:29:33,297
In that case...

518
00:29:36,777 --> 00:29:37,877
How about this one?

519
00:29:45,047 --> 00:29:48,217
- How do they feel? - They're so soft and comfortable.

520
00:29:48,647 --> 00:29:50,457
- I'll take these. - Great.

521
00:29:50,817 --> 00:29:53,887
Oh, and that pair you're wearing...

522
00:29:54,127 --> 00:29:57,627
I'll take a pair for my daughter. Size 240mm, please.

523
00:29:57,757 --> 00:30:01,267
It's very popular with young people. I'm sure your daughter will love it.

524
00:30:01,367 --> 00:30:03,737
- I'll get a fresh pair for you. - Thank you.

525
00:30:08,007 --> 00:30:10,907
Su Bin, I heard you wouldn't give your number to Shin Woo Yeong...

526
00:30:10,977 --> 00:30:13,907
and turned down a second date. Why would you do that?

527
00:30:14,007 --> 00:30:15,477
I thought you said he was your ideal type.

528
00:30:18,877 --> 00:30:19,877
That's it.

529
00:30:20,647 --> 00:30:22,187
You really meant it when you said only three beers.

530
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:25,057
I told you so. Let's go Dutch.

531
00:30:25,887 --> 00:30:27,757
What are you doing? That's absurd.

532
00:30:27,757 --> 00:30:29,587
Are you really with a matchmaking agency?

533
00:30:29,787 --> 00:30:31,597
Then you should know where I stand financially.

534
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:37,097
Well, yes. And I can afford my three beers.

535
00:30:38,597 --> 00:30:41,437
Stop with the nonsense and give me your number.

536
00:30:42,337 --> 00:30:43,537
My number... I'm not so sure.

537
00:30:43,837 --> 00:30:46,137
I need some time to think.

538
00:30:46,907 --> 00:30:50,717
Why do you need time to think? What is there to think about?

539
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:54,487
There's quite a lot, actually.

540
00:30:55,517 --> 00:30:58,487
You're drunk. Su Bin, just sit down.

541
00:30:58,557 --> 00:31:00,257
- I'll call you a car... - No, don't bother.

542
00:31:00,457 --> 00:31:01,687
I've already called a taxi.

543
00:31:03,427 --> 00:31:05,357
Well then. Goodbye.

544
00:31:05,427 --> 00:31:06,427
Wait.

545
00:31:13,637 --> 00:31:15,237
So what if he's my ideal type?

546
00:31:15,237 --> 00:31:17,907
Am I supposed to ask Seong Jae for a fake employment letter?

547
00:31:18,777 --> 00:31:19,907
There's no way I can do that.

548
00:31:21,107 --> 00:31:22,277
It's a shame, though.

549
00:31:22,707 --> 00:31:24,217
Life is so cruel.

550
00:31:26,577 --> 00:31:27,587
Welcome...

551
00:31:33,457 --> 00:31:35,427
How did you find me here?

552
00:31:35,687 --> 00:31:36,997
I asked your manager.

553
00:31:37,857 --> 00:31:40,727
Why would they share my personal information?

554
00:31:40,827 --> 00:31:42,467
That's highly inappropriate.

555
00:31:42,797 --> 00:31:46,497
- What if I'm not here to see you? - Excuse me.

556
00:31:48,567 --> 00:31:50,107
From here...

557
00:31:51,207 --> 00:31:53,037
to here. I'll take all of them. In a size 270mm.

558
00:31:54,977 --> 00:31:57,377
Yes, sir. Let me check for you.

559
00:32:00,247 --> 00:32:02,517
Hey, you can't do this here.

560
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,187
Why not? I'm offering to pay.

561
00:32:09,387 --> 00:32:10,397
Thank you.

562
00:32:14,027 --> 00:32:15,067
Thank you.

563
00:32:16,027 --> 00:32:17,097
Thank you.

(Lee Su Bin)

566
00:32:30,747 --> 00:32:32,177
What's this about, so late at night?

567
00:32:34,747 --> 00:32:35,747
Hey, Su Bin. What's up?

568
00:32:35,817 --> 00:32:37,957
Seong Jae! I'm in big trouble.

569
00:32:38,687 --> 00:32:40,527
You're at your office, right? I need to see you.

570
00:32:40,587 --> 00:32:41,587
I need your advice on something.

571
00:32:41,587 --> 00:32:43,127
(Shoealls)

572
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,757
I'm working late right now. I've still got a while to go.

573
00:32:46,157 --> 00:32:48,867
I'm right in front of your office. I'm coming up.

574
00:32:54,007 --> 00:32:56,137
That guy's seen a few dramas.

575
00:32:57,237 --> 00:33:00,207
But what's the problem? It sounds like he's crazy about you.

576
00:33:00,377 --> 00:33:03,347
No, it's not that. It's a textbook case of that thing.

577
00:33:04,047 --> 00:33:06,617
I acted like I wasn't interested at all.

578
00:33:06,917 --> 00:33:09,117
It's that competitive drive that kicks in for guys.

579
00:33:09,447 --> 00:33:10,457
You acted like you weren't interested?

580
00:33:11,057 --> 00:33:12,057
Why?

581
00:33:12,617 --> 00:33:14,127
Was that your game plan?

582
00:33:14,927 --> 00:33:18,197
No, it's not that. I thought a business card was enough,

583
00:33:18,457 --> 00:33:21,567
but the matchmaking agency asked for an employment letter too.

584
00:33:21,897 --> 00:33:23,737
So I decided not to go through with it.

585
00:33:23,937 --> 00:33:26,667
Employment letter? They really asked for that?

586
00:33:27,667 --> 00:33:28,667
Unbelievable.

587
00:33:29,367 --> 00:33:30,977
So that's why you acted like you weren't interested?

588
00:33:31,777 --> 00:33:35,047
Well, then just say you're quitting to go full-time on YouTube.

589
00:33:35,307 --> 00:33:36,477
Problem solved, right?

590
00:33:36,777 --> 00:33:37,777
What?

591
00:33:37,847 --> 00:33:40,747
That was your plan anyway, right? You said you only needed one month.

592
00:33:41,287 --> 00:33:43,787
That's why you agreed to work as the store manager for a month.

593
00:33:44,887 --> 00:33:46,317
I didn't even think of that.

(Lee Ji Hyuk)

595
00:33:50,957 --> 00:33:52,197
It's Ji Hyuk.

596
00:33:54,167 --> 00:33:55,297
Hey, Ji Hyuk.

597
00:33:55,427 --> 00:33:58,767
Hey, let's meet up tomorrow. I need to talk to you.

598
00:34:01,137 --> 00:34:03,907
- What's this about all of a sudden? - It's about me.

599
00:34:04,677 --> 00:34:07,077
Really? When works for you?

600
00:34:12,847 --> 00:34:13,847
You're leaving?

601
00:34:13,847 --> 00:34:16,247
I brought more coffee, assuming you were working all night.

602
00:34:16,947 --> 00:34:19,287
I'm heading to my mom's restaurant.

603
00:34:19,287 --> 00:34:20,987
The all-nighters start tomorrow.

604
00:34:21,957 --> 00:34:24,157
Eun Oh. Why are you so lively suddenly?

605
00:34:24,227 --> 00:34:25,227
You're looking chipper again.

606
00:34:25,927 --> 00:34:28,097
Are you just excited that you're swamped with work?

607
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:30,667
That's not the main reason.

608
00:34:31,067 --> 00:34:33,937
I've cleared up the misunderstanding with my mom.

609
00:34:35,007 --> 00:34:36,007
A misunderstanding?

610
00:34:38,777 --> 00:34:41,047
I never in a million years thought...

611
00:34:41,107 --> 00:34:44,247
my mom and I could have a misunderstanding.

612
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:48,317
But because of Gang Oh, so many unexpected things happened,

613
00:34:49,047 --> 00:34:50,787
and that's just how it turned out.

614
00:34:51,687 --> 00:34:54,387
I guess everyone sees things through their own filter.

615
00:34:56,887 --> 00:35:00,367
To my mom, Gang Oh is her child, and so am I.

616
00:35:01,427 --> 00:35:05,197
So, she's caught in the middle, unable to take a side.

617
00:35:07,337 --> 00:35:10,877
I was the one who got insecure.

618
00:35:12,177 --> 00:35:13,977
So you were just bottling it all up.

619
00:35:17,047 --> 00:35:21,247
My mom and dad... Aren't they incredible?

620
00:35:21,417 --> 00:35:22,887
They're truly admirable.

621
00:35:25,087 --> 00:35:26,957
You know, I've heard it said before.

622
00:35:27,387 --> 00:35:29,357
The bond from raising a child is stronger than blood.

623
00:35:33,557 --> 00:35:34,667
I think so too.

624
00:35:37,267 --> 00:35:40,097
But Eun Oh... What about you?

625
00:35:40,167 --> 00:35:43,777
Have you ever been curious about your birth parents or missed them?

626
00:35:46,607 --> 00:35:47,847
No.

627
00:35:48,107 --> 00:35:49,107
Never.

628
00:35:50,207 --> 00:35:51,847
I figured they must have had their reasons.

629
00:35:52,347 --> 00:35:53,577
And I just left it at that.

(Damga Charcoal Grill)

631
00:35:58,887 --> 00:36:01,327
This is wonderful, Eun Oh.

632
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:04,627
You didn't even have a proper office to focus on your work.

633
00:36:04,827 --> 00:36:05,927
You were working so hard,

634
00:36:05,927 --> 00:36:08,467
crammed into that corner of the cafe.

635
00:36:09,227 --> 00:36:11,037
It wasn't that bad, but...

636
00:36:11,297 --> 00:36:14,207
Still, I'm really happy to finally have my own office.

637
00:36:14,267 --> 00:36:17,007
Of course, you are. That goes without saying.

638
00:36:18,007 --> 00:36:21,677
So, to celebrate, how about some barbecue?

639
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,347
Here.

640
00:36:26,247 --> 00:36:28,017
It's your famous barbecue.

641
00:36:28,317 --> 00:36:31,587
I bet you haven't had proper meals since you've been so busy.

642
00:36:31,657 --> 00:36:33,987
You have such a small appetite.

643
00:36:35,187 --> 00:36:38,957
Dad and Gang Oh really used to love this.

644
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:47,337
What?

645
00:36:53,207 --> 00:36:54,977
Mom, Gang Oh's outside.

646
00:36:57,877 --> 00:36:58,877
Don't go out there.

647
00:37:03,717 --> 00:37:04,717
What's Mom doing?

648
00:37:07,017 --> 00:37:08,227
Did you really abandon me?

649
00:37:13,697 --> 00:37:14,697
Mom.

650
00:37:15,167 --> 00:37:18,037
- But Gang Oh came all this way. - Not yet.

651
00:37:18,667 --> 00:37:20,137
It's not like he walked in.

652
00:37:21,167 --> 00:37:23,107
- Mom. - Stop it.

653
00:37:23,667 --> 00:37:25,677
What did I just tell you?

654
00:37:25,937 --> 00:37:28,847
Eun Oh, you're too soft on your family.

655
00:37:29,147 --> 00:37:30,177
You need to stop that.

656
00:37:30,747 --> 00:37:32,017
You need to think about your own life.

657
00:37:56,067 --> 00:38:01,147
(Spa 25)

658
00:38:12,257 --> 00:38:13,257
Father.

659
00:38:15,287 --> 00:38:17,297
I need to talk to you. Are you leaving already?

660
00:38:18,057 --> 00:38:19,057
What is it?

661
00:38:19,827 --> 00:38:21,397
So, you're working part-time at a convenience store.

662
00:38:22,067 --> 00:38:23,897
When you go in today, I want you to quit.

663
00:38:24,667 --> 00:38:25,667
What?

664
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:28,437
I couldn't help but overhear you and Mom arguing.

665
00:38:29,367 --> 00:38:30,777
I'll take care of the living expenses,

666
00:38:31,837 --> 00:38:32,837
so please, just do what Mom says.

667
00:38:34,007 --> 00:38:35,007
What did you say?

668
00:38:35,277 --> 00:38:37,277
This isn't about your pride.

669
00:38:37,877 --> 00:38:39,817
It's tough. Just a few months of studying...

670
00:38:40,177 --> 00:38:41,647
won't cut it for the practical test.

671
00:38:42,347 --> 00:38:44,257
And it's not easy to find a job right away. So,

672
00:38:45,157 --> 00:38:47,857
for now, you should just focus on studying for the exam.

673
00:38:48,157 --> 00:38:50,387
- Our living expenses... - Who do you think you are?

674
00:38:51,197 --> 00:38:52,657
I'm the head of this household.

675
00:38:52,927 --> 00:38:54,527
I'm the head of this family.

676
00:38:55,027 --> 00:38:58,997
Providing for this family is my job. Who are you to offer us money?

677
00:38:59,137 --> 00:39:01,707
Are you working that part-time job to be the head of the household?

678
00:39:02,107 --> 00:39:03,107
You're not, are you?

679
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:05,007
It's because of your pride, isn't it?

680
00:39:05,607 --> 00:39:06,907
Can you even make...

681
00:39:06,907 --> 00:39:09,307
a quarter of your old salary working just three days a week?

682
00:39:09,677 --> 00:39:11,947
You can't cover all the bills for Mom anyway.

683
00:39:12,117 --> 00:39:14,247
That's none of your business.

684
00:39:14,247 --> 00:39:15,447
I still have some severance pay left.

685
00:39:15,587 --> 00:39:17,757
The money your high-and-mighty self left for us.

686
00:39:18,117 --> 00:39:20,357
Hey, I passed the written test on the first try.

687
00:39:20,357 --> 00:39:22,257
The practical will be no different.

688
00:39:22,627 --> 00:39:23,727
Even if you get the license,

689
00:39:24,157 --> 00:39:26,497
there's still no guarantee you'll get a job right away.

690
00:39:27,297 --> 00:39:28,767
You won't be earning a steady income.

691
00:39:30,637 --> 00:39:33,737
Then use your part-time job money for your personal allowance.

692
00:39:34,107 --> 00:39:36,107
I'll give Mom the money for our living expenses...

693
00:39:36,167 --> 00:39:37,407
Get out of here, you punk!

694
00:39:39,177 --> 00:39:42,877
How dare you sneak in here uninvited and act like you own the place?

695
00:39:43,007 --> 00:39:45,147
When I'm still alive and kicking!

696
00:39:45,777 --> 00:39:47,647
You think you can walk all over me because I let things slide?

697
00:39:47,917 --> 00:39:49,547
I won't stand for this, you hear me?

698
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:51,057
Get out right now!

699
00:39:52,517 --> 00:39:53,517
I'm not leaving.

700
00:39:54,257 --> 00:39:55,257
What?

701
00:39:55,857 --> 00:39:57,497
I'll leave when I'm ready.

702
00:39:58,157 --> 00:39:59,197
But I'm not leaving now.

703
00:39:59,557 --> 00:40:00,827
Oh, you're not leaving?

704
00:40:01,097 --> 00:40:03,327
Fine. Then I'll leave, you brat!

705
00:40:15,347 --> 00:40:18,547
- Honey, what has gotten into you? - Let me go.

706
00:40:23,517 --> 00:40:26,487
Son, wait. Sang Cheol! What is all this commotion?

707
00:40:27,017 --> 00:40:29,887
Mother, I'm sorry, but I'm leaving.

708
00:40:31,097 --> 00:40:32,097
What?

709
00:40:36,097 --> 00:40:37,097
Da Jeong.

710
00:40:37,897 --> 00:40:39,237
Aren't you going to stop him?

711
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:41,907
He's not going to stop just because I try.

712
00:41:01,987 --> 00:41:04,197
I'm dying to know what happens next. I can't even sleep!

713
00:41:04,627 --> 00:41:06,397
It's an old comic, but it's really good.

714
00:41:06,527 --> 00:41:08,527
But why do you make me check out two at a time? It's a hassle.

715
00:41:08,897 --> 00:41:12,037
I'll get you the whole series. Just tell your assistant and read.

716
00:41:12,267 --> 00:41:13,267
You mean Ms. Jang?

717
00:41:15,567 --> 00:41:17,237
She'll go straight to my mom.

718
00:41:17,877 --> 00:41:18,877
The assistant...

719
00:41:19,637 --> 00:41:20,637
is she your mom's spy or something?

720
00:41:24,247 --> 00:41:26,677
You know, whenever I talk to you,

721
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:29,487
I feel like I've stepped into a parallel universe.

722
00:41:30,017 --> 00:41:32,317
Why on earth can't an artist read comic books?

723
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:33,857
Why can't you have a hobby?

724
00:41:34,357 --> 00:41:37,457
Look, I have a million questions, and you don't have a single answer.

725
00:41:38,257 --> 00:41:39,257
That's because my mom...

726
00:41:39,327 --> 00:41:43,127
It is so wrong for your mom to control your life. So wrong.

727
00:41:43,727 --> 00:41:45,797
She's doing it all for my own good.

728
00:41:47,537 --> 00:41:48,667
I don't know why I even bother.

729
00:41:49,207 --> 00:41:51,677
It's so frustrating just trying.

730
00:42:08,987 --> 00:42:11,657
Yeong Ra, how your life turns out...

731
00:42:11,727 --> 00:42:13,297
is your choice, and you have to own it.

732
00:42:13,657 --> 00:42:15,627
Look, is it actually wrong to read comics?

733
00:42:15,927 --> 00:42:17,127
Do you really believe that?

734
00:42:17,427 --> 00:42:18,437
Honestly?

735
00:42:20,697 --> 00:42:22,107
No, I guess not.

736
00:42:22,367 --> 00:42:25,777
Then do you have the right to read comics?

737
00:42:27,677 --> 00:42:28,677
I guess I do.

738
00:42:28,777 --> 00:42:31,177
But you can't tell your mom you want to read them?

739
00:42:31,477 --> 00:42:33,717
Because you're afraid of trouble? Because you're scared of her?

740
00:42:34,547 --> 00:42:36,687
Look, there's no freedom without a fight.

741
00:42:37,047 --> 00:42:38,657
You have to claim your own rights.

742
00:43:03,577 --> 00:43:05,817
Yes. What's the urgent matter?

743
00:43:06,147 --> 00:43:08,717
Sir, the Italian buyers contacted us.

744
00:43:08,717 --> 00:43:10,287
They want to open a European branch.

745
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:11,487
Is that so?

746
00:43:12,517 --> 00:43:15,187
But I thought their response was negative until they left.

747
00:43:15,557 --> 00:43:18,927
I know. Anyway, they're coordinating with me on a date for their visit.

748
00:43:19,497 --> 00:43:22,367
I see. And are the specific terms the same?

749
00:43:22,597 --> 00:43:25,197
Yes. But when we sign the contract,

750
00:43:25,197 --> 00:43:27,397
they insist on seeing Mr. Park Seong Jae.

751
00:43:29,267 --> 00:43:30,267
They are?

752
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:40,647
Wait, so the cafe is closing, and your company is moving in?

753
00:43:41,487 --> 00:43:42,487
That's right.

754
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:46,357
Things are moving fast. This and your materials showroom.

755
00:43:47,087 --> 00:43:49,927
I started planning this a while ago and have been getting ready.

756
00:43:51,697 --> 00:43:53,427
You keep showing me a side of you I never knew.

757
00:43:54,127 --> 00:43:56,067
I didn't know I had it in me either.

758
00:43:56,927 --> 00:43:57,967
What about investors?

759
00:43:57,967 --> 00:43:59,297
Have you been preparing for that too?

760
00:44:00,237 --> 00:44:03,867
Yes. The business plan is done, and I have my list.

761
00:44:04,067 --> 00:44:05,107
My IR pitch is in a few days.

762
00:44:06,307 --> 00:44:07,907
You've really done your homework.

763
00:44:09,107 --> 00:44:10,107
Then again,

764
00:44:10,577 --> 00:44:12,947
you're scarily determined when you set your mind to something.

765
00:44:14,287 --> 00:44:15,287
Hey.

766
00:44:15,747 --> 00:44:17,317
If you give me unlimited access...

767
00:44:17,717 --> 00:44:19,557
to your company's lounge, I'll invest too.

768
00:44:20,117 --> 00:44:21,127
What?

769
00:44:21,187 --> 00:44:24,957
I'd be lost without the cafe. It was my go-to spot.

770
00:44:25,427 --> 00:44:26,597
How much can you invest?

771
00:44:27,057 --> 00:44:28,297
We're talking big numbers, Seong Jae.

772
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:32,297
Well, once you have the proposal, send it over.

773
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:34,337
Okay.

774
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:37,007
I'm looking forward to it.

775
00:44:39,737 --> 00:44:41,547
Don't get all excited about my proposal.

776
00:44:42,107 --> 00:44:43,107
Hey, Seong Jae.

777
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:46,417
You're getting your hopes up, unaware that Eun Oh has a boyfriend?

778
00:44:48,187 --> 00:44:49,187
What are you talking about?

779
00:44:49,787 --> 00:44:51,287
Eun Oh has a boyfriend?

780
00:44:53,217 --> 00:44:55,557
- No way. - I saw it with my own eyes.

781
00:44:56,487 --> 00:44:58,557
- You saw them? - Yes, I did.

782
00:44:59,227 --> 00:45:00,697
So if you're going to make a move, do it right.

783
00:45:01,527 --> 00:45:03,267
She says he's just a friend,

784
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:04,937
but then...

785
00:45:04,937 --> 00:45:06,937
she wouldn't go as far as preparing a private birthday meal.

786
00:45:07,837 --> 00:45:08,837
You need to face the facts.

787
00:45:21,147 --> 00:45:22,617
Oh, Mr. Park. You're here.

788
00:45:23,547 --> 00:45:24,557
Do you have a second?

789
00:45:25,457 --> 00:45:26,587
Not really.

790
00:45:27,217 --> 00:45:29,587
Is something up? I'm a bit busy right now.

791
00:45:30,657 --> 00:45:31,657
Oh, right.

792
00:45:34,027 --> 00:45:35,027
Eun Oh.

793
00:45:35,627 --> 00:45:37,967
By any chance, do you have a boyfriend?

794
00:45:41,567 --> 00:45:43,367
Well, Ji Hyuk said he saw you with someone.

795
00:45:44,007 --> 00:45:47,577
I know it's personal, but I felt we're close enough to ask.

796
00:45:48,147 --> 00:45:49,877
Oh, you mean Mr. Early?

797
00:45:50,507 --> 00:45:52,417
I already told him we're just friends.

798
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:55,217
He said you even threw him a birthday party.

799
00:45:57,117 --> 00:45:58,117
This is ridiculous.

800
00:45:59,057 --> 00:46:00,657
He's telling you things like that?

801
00:46:01,787 --> 00:46:03,327
No, Ji Hyuk was just worried about you.

802
00:46:05,127 --> 00:46:08,097
Does he still see me as that 21-year-old rookie?

803
00:46:08,767 --> 00:46:11,197
So he's just a guy friend, then?

804
00:46:11,737 --> 00:46:13,597
If I ever got a boyfriend,

805
00:46:13,597 --> 00:46:16,507
you and Su Jeong would be the first to know.

806
00:46:17,367 --> 00:46:21,077
Run him by me before it's official. Since I'm so worried.

807
00:46:22,807 --> 00:46:23,807
Anyway, back to work.

808
00:46:40,497 --> 00:46:41,497
So? What'd she say?

809
00:46:41,967 --> 00:46:42,967
Hey, why you...

810
00:46:43,527 --> 00:46:44,967
They're just friends.

811
00:46:46,467 --> 00:46:47,467
Are you sure?

812
00:46:48,137 --> 00:46:50,937
Yes, if she gets a boyfriend, I'll be the first one to meet him.

813
00:46:51,337 --> 00:46:52,877
Why would she introduce him to you first?

814
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:54,977
That's up to Eun Oh, isn't it?

815
00:46:55,977 --> 00:46:58,717
You need to stop acting like you're her guardian.

816
00:46:59,647 --> 00:47:00,677
I gave that up a long time ago.

817
00:47:03,347 --> 00:47:05,757
Still, I'm glad he's not her boyfriend.

818
00:47:08,687 --> 00:47:10,327
- Thank you. - Thank you.

819
00:47:10,387 --> 00:47:11,397
All right, take care.

820
00:47:12,157 --> 00:47:15,967
Time to restock. Restock. Time to...

821
00:47:16,867 --> 00:47:18,697
(Missed Call, My Wife Kim Da Jeong)

822
00:47:31,077 --> 00:47:32,347
The invitations for your guests...

823
00:47:32,347 --> 00:47:33,747
will be sent to your office tomorrow.

824
00:47:34,887 --> 00:47:35,917
All right.

825
00:47:36,387 --> 00:47:38,657
Our Yeong Ra is finally making her debut.

826
00:47:39,487 --> 00:47:41,227
Send me the posters and pamphlets too.

827
00:47:41,587 --> 00:47:43,487
I'll put them up and leave some out at the office.

828
00:47:43,987 --> 00:47:47,597
Gosh, that'll look too messy and could actually hurt her image.

829
00:47:48,197 --> 00:47:50,367
It'll be obvious that she's using her dad's connections from work.

830
00:47:51,397 --> 00:47:52,737
You think so?

831
00:47:53,867 --> 00:47:55,407
The curator is handling the publicity...

832
00:47:55,407 --> 00:47:56,937
for the general public.

833
00:47:57,877 --> 00:48:00,137
I just hope a lot of the VIPs show up.

834
00:48:02,247 --> 00:48:03,447
I'm home.

835
00:48:04,207 --> 00:48:05,277
Hey, Yeong Ra.

836
00:48:05,617 --> 00:48:06,617
You must be tired.

837
00:48:07,517 --> 00:48:09,117
Wait, why are you home so early?

838
00:48:10,647 --> 00:48:11,657
I got scared.

839
00:48:12,387 --> 00:48:13,417
Scared? What scared you?

840
00:48:17,687 --> 00:48:21,297
A reporter showed up and was banging on the door. It really startled me.

841
00:48:22,667 --> 00:48:25,397
I was too scared to open the door, so I just told them to go away.

842
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:29,367
- A reporter? - You should've called Lee.

843
00:48:29,967 --> 00:48:31,537
It wasn't that guy again, was it? The stalker.

844
00:48:33,337 --> 00:48:35,107
Let's go upstairs. You can tell me about it.

845
00:48:35,907 --> 00:48:37,247
Don't you worry about it.

846
00:48:37,917 --> 00:48:40,217
Your breakfast meeting is tomorrow, so you should get some rest.

847
00:48:56,097 --> 00:48:57,627
Why would you say that in front of your dad?

848
00:48:58,337 --> 00:49:00,637
I've told you. You're supposed to tell me these things first.

849
00:49:02,167 --> 00:49:03,167
I'm sorry.

850
00:49:03,567 --> 00:49:04,577
It just slipped out.

851
00:49:07,107 --> 00:49:09,507
But you said he was a reporter?

852
00:49:11,007 --> 00:49:13,347
A reporter wouldn't just show up for no reason.

853
00:49:15,047 --> 00:49:16,717
You're sure it wasn't the stalker's voice?

854
00:49:17,787 --> 00:49:18,787
No, it wasn't him.

855
00:49:19,157 --> 00:49:21,457
He mentioned hearing about it through a gallery.

856
00:49:25,427 --> 00:49:26,527
Was Ms. Jang there?

857
00:49:28,367 --> 00:49:30,067
She was in the restroom at the time.

858
00:49:31,267 --> 00:49:32,937
My goodness. That was dangerous.

859
00:49:35,167 --> 00:49:37,367
If a reporter suddenly shows up asking for an interview...

860
00:49:38,207 --> 00:49:39,937
- What should I do? - Don't do it.

861
00:49:40,807 --> 00:49:42,607
Some useless rumour must have gotten out.

862
00:49:45,047 --> 00:49:46,047
This won't do.

863
00:49:46,747 --> 00:49:49,187
Until the exhibition, Ms. Jang will paint at her place.

864
00:49:49,447 --> 00:49:50,887
And I'll have to move the paintings at night.

865
00:49:52,617 --> 00:49:53,617
Okay.

866
00:49:55,327 --> 00:49:56,327
Get some rest.

867
00:50:06,537 --> 00:50:08,367
My gosh.

868
00:50:09,237 --> 00:50:10,637
I just lied to Mom.

869
00:50:12,237 --> 00:50:14,847
How did that lie just roll off my tongue?

870
00:50:17,547 --> 00:50:18,577
It didn't exactly roll off.

871
00:50:19,417 --> 00:50:22,347
I'm a webtoon artist, so I'm just quick-witted.

872
00:50:25,087 --> 00:50:26,587
Now, I can binge-read all the comics I want.

873
00:50:30,557 --> 00:50:31,557
Fifty dollars?

874
00:50:32,127 --> 00:50:33,397
No, that's just too much.

875
00:50:34,697 --> 00:50:36,867
- Mr. Lee? - Hey, Ms. Ji.

876
00:50:37,397 --> 00:50:38,397
The Spring.

877
00:50:38,467 --> 00:50:42,637
Right. The Spring. What brings you out at this hour?

878
00:50:42,837 --> 00:50:45,337
I was just going to grab a beer to celebrate something.

879
00:50:45,777 --> 00:50:48,077
I made up my mind. I'm getting an office.

880
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:53,717
But what's with the bag?

881
00:50:54,177 --> 00:50:55,247
This?

882
00:50:58,617 --> 00:51:00,517
I got into a huge fight with my son.

883
00:51:00,917 --> 00:51:03,827
I was so furious that I yelled, "Get out!"

884
00:51:04,027 --> 00:51:05,957
I said, "If you won't leave, then I will!"

885
00:51:06,597 --> 00:51:09,367
You'd think he'd at least pretend to leave, right?

886
00:51:09,467 --> 00:51:11,297
Of course. And he didn't?

887
00:51:11,397 --> 00:51:12,397
You know what he said?

888
00:51:12,797 --> 00:51:14,837
He just flat out said, "I'm not leaving."

889
00:51:14,907 --> 00:51:15,907
So what was I supposed to do?

890
00:51:17,237 --> 00:51:19,437
So you're the one who packed a bag and left?

891
00:51:19,607 --> 00:51:21,977
That's right. I packed a bag and left, but...

892
00:51:22,247 --> 00:51:25,517
I should probably just go back. No, forget it.

893
00:51:26,077 --> 00:51:27,547
I have to stay out at least one night.

894
00:51:27,547 --> 00:51:29,717
I was just looking for a 24-hour spa.

895
00:51:31,047 --> 00:51:32,057
I get it.

896
00:51:32,487 --> 00:51:34,357
You packed up and left because your son crossed the line.

897
00:51:34,687 --> 00:51:36,957
You have to spend at least one night away from home.

898
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:39,427
Do you know if there's a 24-hour spa around here?

899
00:51:40,397 --> 00:51:43,267
There's one over that way, but it's closed for renovation.

900
00:51:45,597 --> 00:51:48,437
I could put you up for a night, though.

901
00:51:49,037 --> 00:51:50,037
What?

902
00:51:50,707 --> 00:51:52,977
I'm saying you have a place to sleep.

903
00:52:01,177 --> 00:52:03,517
But this looks like a cafe.

904
00:52:04,417 --> 00:52:05,917
My office is this way.

905
00:52:06,787 --> 00:52:08,757
- Come on, this way. - Okay.

906
00:52:19,397 --> 00:52:22,507
I didn't mean to impose on you like this.

907
00:52:22,867 --> 00:52:26,207
You'd waste money on a room and fare for a spa in another neighbourhood.

908
00:52:26,777 --> 00:52:30,307
This might look like a storage room, but when this was an office,

909
00:52:30,377 --> 00:52:31,877
someone used to live and work here.

910
00:52:32,477 --> 00:52:34,747
I've also slept here when I had to pull an all-nighter.

911
00:52:35,417 --> 00:52:37,387
You slept here?

912
00:52:37,687 --> 00:52:40,617
Yes, but I had to sleep on a camping mat.

913
00:52:41,427 --> 00:52:43,487
Oh, my. Then I'm getting the royal treatment.

914
00:52:45,027 --> 00:52:48,867
There's a shower in the men's room and water from the dispenser.

915
00:52:49,167 --> 00:52:52,997
You won't see anyone until tomorrow, so get some rest.

916
00:52:53,867 --> 00:52:56,607
I never imagined a friend would help me out like this.

917
00:52:57,267 --> 00:52:59,877
Hey, what are friends for?

918
00:53:00,407 --> 00:53:02,007
I'll get going. Rest easy.

919
00:53:02,347 --> 00:53:04,447
Thank you. All right.

920
00:53:09,147 --> 00:53:12,117
I must say, this is way better than a 24-hour spa.

921
00:53:12,617 --> 00:53:13,617
And I have it all to myself.

922
00:53:14,587 --> 00:53:17,487
The phone is turned off. Please leave a message...

923
00:53:17,927 --> 00:53:19,227
Dad's phone is still off.

924
00:53:19,797 --> 00:53:21,257
Dad must be furious.

925
00:53:21,997 --> 00:53:24,567
The only time he stays out overnight is for business trips.

926
00:53:25,697 --> 00:53:27,097
Where in the world could he be sleeping?

927
00:53:29,507 --> 00:53:32,037
Da Jeong. Didn't you hear me?

928
00:53:33,077 --> 00:53:34,707
I can hear you, Mother.

929
00:53:34,947 --> 00:53:36,377
I just don't have an answer for you.

930
00:53:37,277 --> 00:53:39,017
I have no idea where he could be.

931
00:53:50,157 --> 00:53:52,097
What if Dad really ran away for good?

932
00:53:52,097 --> 00:53:53,257
What if Dad says...

933
00:53:53,327 --> 00:53:55,427
he'll never come home unless Ji Hyuk moves out?

934
00:53:58,167 --> 00:54:00,797
Ji Hyuk, it looks like Dad isn't coming home.

935
00:54:01,937 --> 00:54:03,637
Why did you have to fight with Dad?

936
00:54:04,877 --> 00:54:07,337
Ji Hyuk, have you tried calling your father?

937
00:54:08,307 --> 00:54:09,307
No.

938
00:54:10,007 --> 00:54:12,847
Good grief, you heartless brat!

939
00:54:13,217 --> 00:54:16,317
He was so angry with you that he packed and left.

940
00:54:16,317 --> 00:54:17,517
You're not worried?

941
00:54:17,887 --> 00:54:18,887
Come on, Grandma!

942
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:21,117
He'll be back tomorrow because of you.

943
00:54:21,857 --> 00:54:24,657
He even packed clothes and left, so he can't come back today.

944
00:54:25,097 --> 00:54:26,157
Men just can't do that.

945
00:54:26,857 --> 00:54:27,957
He kind of has a point.

946
00:54:28,567 --> 00:54:29,567
He has to stand his ground.

947
00:54:29,967 --> 00:54:32,497
He'll be back tomorrow. So don't you worry so much, Mom.

948
00:54:33,197 --> 00:54:34,907
This is the first time he's ever stayed out all night.

949
00:54:35,337 --> 00:54:36,767
You're being way too nonchalant.

950
00:54:37,507 --> 00:54:39,737
Staying out all night is no big deal.

951
00:54:39,737 --> 00:54:42,147
Besides, he won't get into trouble.

952
00:54:42,577 --> 00:54:43,607
So please, don't worry, Mom.

953
00:54:47,247 --> 00:54:48,447
What if he doesn't come home tomorrow?

954
00:54:48,717 --> 00:54:50,117
Shouldn't you be the one to move out then?

955
00:54:50,747 --> 00:54:51,757
Fine. Then I'll move out.

956
00:55:07,097 --> 00:55:11,237
"Cross the mountain, even if you have to crawl."

957
00:55:15,977 --> 00:55:18,677
Someone really desperate must have stayed here.

958
00:55:36,027 --> 00:55:37,267
Ji Wan, let's go! Hurry up.

959
00:55:38,097 --> 00:55:39,667
Ms. Jang isn't coming in starting today.

960
00:55:40,237 --> 00:55:42,067
- What? - Hurry.

961
00:55:52,047 --> 00:55:55,247
Drop me off, and rent the rest of the comics.

962
00:55:55,317 --> 00:55:58,247
Hey, your assistant isn't coming in? What happened?

963
00:55:58,887 --> 00:56:00,117
That's just what happened.

964
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:02,457
Hey, so that means you'll have the studio to yourself, right?

965
00:56:02,957 --> 00:56:04,997
Hey, Yeong Ra, congratulations!

966
00:56:05,497 --> 00:56:08,197
You finally have a space where you can breathe freely.

967
00:56:09,267 --> 00:56:10,867
I feel so relieved for you.

968
00:56:11,737 --> 00:56:13,797
This calls for some celebratory karaoke.

969
00:56:14,097 --> 00:56:16,067
- Karaoke? - All this time...

970
00:56:16,067 --> 00:56:17,867
I've been secretly renting those comics for you,

971
00:56:17,937 --> 00:56:20,137
do you have any idea how nervous I was about getting caught?

972
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:22,477
I'm going to sing all that stress away.

973
00:56:23,077 --> 00:56:24,077
I see.

974
00:56:26,117 --> 00:56:29,587
Hey, Yeong Ra. How did you deal with your stress?

975
00:56:30,647 --> 00:56:32,117
You had to draw your webtoon in secret too.

976
00:56:33,187 --> 00:56:34,717
Stress...

977
00:56:35,927 --> 00:56:37,557
I didn't even realise I was stressed.

978
00:56:39,957 --> 00:56:40,957
What?

979
00:56:42,597 --> 00:56:45,397
At this point, it's like she's been brainwashed.

980
00:56:48,367 --> 00:56:49,737
Have you ever been to karaoke?

981
00:56:52,307 --> 00:56:53,907
Forget it. Why am I even asking?

982
00:57:04,117 --> 00:57:07,087
It's unconditional

983
00:57:10,487 --> 00:57:13,857
My love for you

984
00:57:14,227 --> 00:57:17,167
It's unconditional

985
00:57:17,227 --> 00:57:20,467
My love for you

986
00:57:20,537 --> 00:57:23,137
It's very special

987
00:57:23,137 --> 00:57:24,967
Get up!

988
00:57:25,707 --> 00:57:28,907
I'll cross the Pacific and the Atlantic

989
00:57:28,977 --> 00:57:32,017
I'll even swim the Indian Ocean

990
00:57:32,277 --> 00:57:34,047
If you call for me

991
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:36,087
(Owa Fire and Electrical Training Academy)

992
00:57:42,227 --> 00:57:45,357
- So, your class ends at 3pm. - Are you here to drag me home?

993
00:57:45,627 --> 00:57:48,467
No. I figured you might be too embarrassed to come home,

994
00:57:48,527 --> 00:57:51,467
- so I came to help you save face. - Why wouldn't I go to my own house?

995
00:57:51,527 --> 00:57:52,937
Then why did you pack a bag?

996
00:57:53,197 --> 00:57:55,037
Well, I only packed for one day.

997
00:57:56,267 --> 00:57:57,467
You've got to be kidding me.

998
00:57:57,537 --> 00:58:00,537
With my mother there, did you think I'd be gone for long?

999
00:58:01,577 --> 00:58:06,447
Seeing you pack, which you never do, I thought you'd be gone for a week.

1000
00:58:07,117 --> 00:58:09,117
Then Mother would be worried sick.

1001
00:58:09,547 --> 00:58:11,417
We've been together for over thirty years,

1002
00:58:11,417 --> 00:58:13,017
and you still don't know what I think.

1003
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:16,357
I took a day off for nothing.

1004
00:58:18,557 --> 00:58:19,557
Aren't you coming?

1005
00:58:21,497 --> 00:58:24,567
What gives you the right to act so high and mighty?

1006
00:58:24,867 --> 00:58:27,267
Lying, fighting with our son, and running away from home.

1007
00:58:27,737 --> 00:58:29,567
The only reason I'm holding back is for your mother's sake.

1008
00:58:30,037 --> 00:58:32,537
I told you exactly how I felt yesterday,

1009
00:58:32,837 --> 00:58:34,437
and I am absolutely not giving up my part-time job.

1010
00:58:35,307 --> 00:58:38,647
You need to study and get your practical certification.

1011
00:58:38,777 --> 00:58:43,247
How can you get a job and provide? That's how you should support me.

1012
00:58:43,717 --> 00:58:45,717
That's why I'm telling you to study...

1013
00:58:45,717 --> 00:58:47,717
and not work until you get your license.

1014
00:58:47,787 --> 00:58:51,057
- But you won't even do that? - Cut me some slack until the exam.

1015
00:58:51,427 --> 00:58:54,827
If I fail it this time, I'll do whatever you say.

1016
00:58:55,097 --> 00:58:59,367
Let me do things my way until then. And don't take money from Ji Hyuk.

1017
00:59:07,807 --> 00:59:09,807
Seong Jae, I'm sending you the investment proposal.

1018
00:59:10,247 --> 00:59:12,147
Read it over carefully and then make your decision.

1019
00:59:18,387 --> 00:59:21,827
I've drafted the remodelling plan. Could you come over to the cafe?

1020
00:59:24,387 --> 00:59:26,257
I really don't want to see her right now.

1021
00:59:30,167 --> 00:59:31,867
Please just email it to me. I'm busy.

1022
00:59:31,937 --> 00:59:34,497
(Please just email it to me. I'm busy)

1023
00:59:38,307 --> 00:59:39,937
You're being weird again.

1024
00:59:40,337 --> 00:59:42,447
You of all people should know a meeting is standard practice.

1025
00:59:43,177 --> 00:59:44,877
If you're so busy, I'll come to you.

1026
00:59:53,587 --> 00:59:55,187
I tried keeping the existing structure...

1027
00:59:55,187 --> 00:59:56,487
as much as possible.

1028
00:59:56,957 --> 00:59:59,927
We can make the main entrance area an exhibition space.

1029
01:00:00,327 --> 01:00:03,027
For the break room, we'll tear down the counter bar over here,

1030
01:00:03,097 --> 01:00:05,397
and how about we partition it off in line with the kitchen?

1031
01:00:06,337 --> 01:00:09,107
This will be the staff office, and this will be your office.

1032
01:00:09,637 --> 01:00:12,677
A nap room will go where the kitchen used to be.

1033
01:00:12,837 --> 01:00:15,407
Should we install a small shower in the bathroom?

1034
01:00:16,547 --> 01:00:19,347
Are you saying your section will only be this small area?

1035
01:00:19,647 --> 01:00:20,647
Yes.

1036
01:00:21,277 --> 01:00:25,387
I'll use the storeroom as my office and make this a conference room.

1037
01:00:25,757 --> 01:00:30,027
I'll use a partition, not a curtain. Since there's a back door here,

1038
01:00:30,087 --> 01:00:33,597
I can make this Eunoism's entrance when I eventually go independent.

1039
01:00:33,697 --> 01:00:35,097
No, that's not what I mean.

1040
01:00:35,567 --> 01:00:38,967
Why don't you have a nap room? Why is there only one on my side?

1041
01:00:39,397 --> 01:00:43,237
We don't need to discuss that. Comment on your company's area.

1042
01:00:43,307 --> 01:00:45,807
No. We must settle the basics first.

1043
01:00:48,137 --> 01:00:50,107
Your space will extend to here.

1044
01:00:51,247 --> 01:00:52,877
I don't need all that.

1045
01:00:53,147 --> 01:00:55,687
You were always pulling all-nighters before I moved in here.

1046
01:00:55,887 --> 01:00:58,657
Are you just going to keep sleeping on a mat on the cold office floor?

1047
01:00:59,357 --> 01:01:02,027
That's not for you to worry about.

1048
01:01:02,487 --> 01:01:06,127
- I can just buy a folding cot. - Absolutely not.

1049
01:01:07,327 --> 01:01:08,327
Excuse me?

1050
01:01:09,527 --> 01:01:13,297
I want to be the kind of partner who respects my partner.

1051
01:01:14,097 --> 01:01:17,237
We might not even be partners after these three months are up.

1052
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:18,877
Don't pressure me.

1053
01:01:19,377 --> 01:01:22,377
You act like you're the only partner I'll ever have.

1054
01:01:23,047 --> 01:01:25,717
This idea that without you, I'd have no one for a turnkey partnership...

1055
01:01:25,777 --> 01:01:28,217
Where does a delusion like that come from?

1056
01:01:29,817 --> 01:01:33,317
Remember, if our partnership ends, this space becomes Eunoism's office.

1057
01:01:34,057 --> 01:01:37,487
We settled that with Hyeon Su. Right in front of both of us.

1058
01:01:43,767 --> 01:01:46,367
Just give me your input on your side of the office already.

1059
01:01:47,797 --> 01:01:51,267
That's the bigger problem, isn't it? We won't be able to change it later.

1060
01:01:51,937 --> 01:01:55,207
Okay. You take this much, and we'll use the rest.

1061
01:01:55,477 --> 01:01:57,107
I need you to revise the design accordingly.

1062
01:01:58,377 --> 01:02:01,077
But wait. If I take up this much space,

1063
01:02:01,147 --> 01:02:03,017
there's no room for your layout.

1064
01:02:03,017 --> 01:02:04,447
The CEO's office, the main office, the conference room,

1065
01:02:04,517 --> 01:02:07,617
the pantry, the break room. Especially the mini showroom.

1066
01:02:07,687 --> 01:02:09,927
There won't be enough space left for all of it.

1067
01:02:10,327 --> 01:02:12,257
Figure it out. Those are the terms.

1068
01:02:14,657 --> 01:02:16,867
Why are you being so difficult? I'm the one saying it's fine!

1069
01:02:16,927 --> 01:02:19,967
- Because I'm not fine with it. - But why on earth not?

1070
01:02:20,167 --> 01:02:21,767
Because it makes me uncomfortable.

1071
01:02:21,937 --> 01:02:24,867
Why would you be uncomfortable? What gives you the right to be?

1072
01:02:24,937 --> 01:02:26,507
I'm saying it's fine.

1073
01:02:27,107 --> 01:02:29,707
Forget it. If you don't incorporate my feedback,

1074
01:02:29,777 --> 01:02:31,447
I'm not approving the design.

1075
01:02:32,477 --> 01:02:33,747
I'm not doing it.

1076
01:02:35,547 --> 01:02:37,347
I'm the client, and you're refusing my request?

1077
01:02:39,017 --> 01:02:43,357
You're unbelievable. I'm telling you I'm fine,

1078
01:02:43,657 --> 01:02:46,257
so why do you have a problem with it? Why?

1079
01:02:46,557 --> 01:02:48,127
Seriously, what is your deal?

1080
01:02:48,197 --> 01:02:51,027
I don't know. I don't know why I'm doing this.

1081
01:02:51,227 --> 01:02:52,767
I guess I must like you.

1082
01:03:37,247 --> 01:03:40,217
(Our Golden Days)

1083
01:03:40,347 --> 01:03:43,047
- So you didn't leave after all. - I told you I wasn't going to.

1084
01:03:43,217 --> 01:03:44,887
Father.

1085
01:03:45,287 --> 01:03:46,287
Father!

1086
01:03:46,357 --> 01:03:50,127
I met the love of my life there, and we had our beautiful children.

1087
01:03:50,227 --> 01:03:53,127
My daughter loved bananas more than anything.

1088
01:03:53,197 --> 01:03:55,767
- But then, someone came. - Who?

1089
01:03:55,767 --> 01:03:57,897
His arguments are so absurd.

1090
01:03:57,897 --> 01:04:00,597
Being this fickle should be a crime.

1091
01:04:00,697 --> 01:04:02,267
He's the one who let it slip.

1092
01:04:02,267 --> 01:04:04,507
Mr. Lee, you need to get a grip.

1093
01:04:04,567 --> 01:04:05,577
Are you okay?

1094
01:04:05,777 --> 01:04:08,077
Don't help me, Eun Oh.

1095
01:04:08,207 --> 01:04:09,447
Don't be so nice to me.

1096
01:04:10,047 --> 01:04:11,247
Stop confusing me.
