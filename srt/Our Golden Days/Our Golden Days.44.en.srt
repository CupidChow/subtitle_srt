(Episode 44)

2
00:00:04,444 --> 00:00:07,284
Always leave an escape route, even when you're cornering a rat.

3
00:00:08,014 --> 00:00:09,554
Does he really think I'll just get on my knees and beg?

(Hyeonyu Department Store, Cheongju Orphanage)

6
00:00:37,844 --> 00:00:38,914
What on earth happened?

7
00:00:39,784 --> 00:00:41,184
This can't be right.

8
00:00:44,554 --> 00:00:45,554
Park Jin Seok?

9
00:00:48,294 --> 00:00:50,094
How did he find out about this?

10
00:01:12,484 --> 00:01:14,014
But why did he leave this one untouched?

11
00:01:15,624 --> 00:01:19,894
Honey, if I die suddenly, the safe code is our anniversary.

12
00:01:21,524 --> 00:01:23,624
So he left the one I gave him the code to...

13
00:01:24,824 --> 00:01:27,394
and only cleaned out my secret safe?

14
00:01:54,324 --> 00:01:57,794
Park Jin Seok!

15
00:02:16,584 --> 00:02:17,684
My ID,

16
00:02:18,514 --> 00:02:21,084
my official seal, even all my bankbooks.

17
00:02:23,954 --> 00:02:24,994
Park Jin Seok.

18
00:02:26,154 --> 00:02:27,494
What in the world are you trying to pull?

19
00:02:28,154 --> 00:02:29,324
What is this supposed to mean?

20
00:02:30,494 --> 00:02:31,494
What are you up to?

21
00:02:38,164 --> 00:02:40,504
He must've cleaned this out this morning.

22
00:02:46,874 --> 00:02:47,874
Missus.

23
00:02:50,214 --> 00:02:52,514
Was the Chairman here yesterday afternoon?

24
00:02:52,514 --> 00:02:53,514
Yes.

25
00:02:55,424 --> 00:02:56,824
I'm sure he told you to keep your mouth shut.

26
00:02:58,054 --> 00:02:59,354
I bet he told you not to say anything...

27
00:02:59,624 --> 00:03:01,724
about who he came with and what he did here.

28
00:03:03,124 --> 00:03:04,424
And if I asked whether he had been here,

29
00:03:04,794 --> 00:03:06,064
he told you to confirm that and nothing more?

30
00:03:07,264 --> 00:03:08,264
Yes.

31
00:03:26,284 --> 00:03:27,514
Stop crying, man.

32
00:03:28,054 --> 00:03:29,424
I can't leave with you carrying on like this.

33
00:03:30,124 --> 00:03:33,054
- Hey, this is my office. - I'm just in shock.

34
00:03:36,964 --> 00:03:38,534
Tell me about it.

35
00:03:42,534 --> 00:03:43,634
What about your parents?

36
00:03:45,874 --> 00:03:47,034
Do they know?

37
00:03:48,204 --> 00:03:49,204
No.

38
00:03:50,074 --> 00:03:53,514
I planned to tell you in a few days, though.

39
00:03:54,544 --> 00:03:55,784
Because I need your help.

40
00:03:57,614 --> 00:03:58,814
But other than you,

41
00:03:59,754 --> 00:04:01,184
I'm not telling anyone else.

42
00:04:02,354 --> 00:04:05,054
What are you talking about? You have to tell your family.

43
00:04:05,524 --> 00:04:07,394
If my family finds out, they'll be devastated,

44
00:04:08,864 --> 00:04:13,264
and my parents will force me to quit and just focus on treatment.

45
00:04:13,734 --> 00:04:14,994
Of course, they would.

46
00:04:15,864 --> 00:04:18,064
You have to quit your job and get treatment, Ji Hyuk.

47
00:04:18,874 --> 00:04:20,434
That's exactly why I'm hiding it.

48
00:04:21,604 --> 00:04:23,104
Even if I get treatment,

49
00:04:24,244 --> 00:04:25,674
the only endgame is a heart transplant,

50
00:04:26,014 --> 00:04:27,244
and the waiting list is way too long.

51
00:04:28,214 --> 00:04:30,684
They said even with treatment, I could collapse at any time.

52
00:04:31,954 --> 00:04:33,384
There are no guarantees, Seong Jae.

53
00:04:33,754 --> 00:04:34,784
But still...

54
00:04:36,984 --> 00:04:37,984
I...

55
00:04:38,694 --> 00:04:41,524
refuse to live my life just waiting for a heart transplant.

56
00:04:44,664 --> 00:04:46,864
- Then you're just going to... - Die soon? Is that what you mean?

57
00:04:47,794 --> 00:04:48,804
And you're not going to die?

58
00:04:49,064 --> 00:04:52,774
- We all die. The question is when. - But...

59
00:04:54,274 --> 00:04:55,344
You know,

60
00:04:56,044 --> 00:04:58,844
when I went to Cheongpo after my wedding was called off,

61
00:05:00,274 --> 00:05:02,044
I already died once back then.

62
00:05:05,554 --> 00:05:08,254
It felt like I'd just ceased to exist.

63
00:05:10,254 --> 00:05:12,294
But you brought that on yourself.

64
00:05:13,224 --> 00:05:14,724
I'm telling you. It made me miserable.

65
00:05:18,024 --> 00:05:19,794
It wasn't really living.

66
00:05:21,964 --> 00:05:24,164
I realized that life doesn't go the way you plan.

67
00:05:25,474 --> 00:05:26,704
I learned that the hard way.

68
00:05:31,074 --> 00:05:32,714
So what are you trying to say?

69
00:05:35,144 --> 00:05:37,014
You don't get what I'm saying, do you?

70
00:05:38,084 --> 00:05:40,114
You're not in my shoes, so you'll never understand.

71
00:05:41,514 --> 00:05:43,024
My family wouldn't get it either.

72
00:05:45,524 --> 00:05:47,424
So what is it you want to do?

73
00:05:49,024 --> 00:05:50,494
To keep living just like I am now.

74
00:05:51,834 --> 00:05:54,164
Waiting around for a heart that might never come,

75
00:05:55,134 --> 00:05:56,164
constantly hoping that maybe,

76
00:05:57,504 --> 00:05:58,574
just maybe...

77
00:05:59,904 --> 00:06:01,274
I refuse to live like that.

78
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,714
I want to keep working as if nothing's happened,

79
00:06:08,114 --> 00:06:10,144
eat meals, and laugh with my family...

80
00:06:10,914 --> 00:06:12,314
That's how I want to live.

81
00:06:12,754 --> 00:06:14,484
By lying to your parents and siblings?

82
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,594
- Yes. - Man, how could you do that?

83
00:06:20,554 --> 00:06:21,724
And why not?

84
00:06:23,194 --> 00:06:24,624
I'm the one who's dying here.

85
00:06:25,964 --> 00:06:28,834
What's left of my life is more important.

86
00:06:30,034 --> 00:06:32,134
I don't want those I leave behind...

87
00:06:32,834 --> 00:06:35,404
to be sad and heartbroken over me.

88
00:06:37,044 --> 00:06:38,144
And because of that,

89
00:06:39,414 --> 00:06:42,114
they can't even live their own lives properly.

90
00:06:43,744 --> 00:06:45,014
Darn it...

91
00:06:46,184 --> 00:06:48,414
Do I really have to die with everyone pitying me?

92
00:06:51,894 --> 00:06:54,894
When one of my dad's friends passed away,

93
00:06:56,524 --> 00:06:58,124
my dad told me something.

94
00:06:59,734 --> 00:07:01,534
There might be an order to when we're born,

95
00:07:02,404 --> 00:07:04,164
but there's no order to when we die.

96
00:07:06,874 --> 00:07:08,004
Come on, Lee Ji Hyuk.

97
00:07:09,904 --> 00:07:11,874
Don't you think you're giving up too easily?

98
00:07:12,844 --> 00:07:14,714
Man, you just don't get it, do you?

99
00:07:15,914 --> 00:07:17,214
Hey, look.

100
00:07:17,944 --> 00:07:19,384
I just want to live for today.

101
00:07:21,084 --> 00:07:23,584
So please,

102
00:07:25,894 --> 00:07:27,354
keep this a secret from everyone.

103
00:07:31,324 --> 00:07:32,334
Even from Eun Oh.

104
00:07:41,904 --> 00:07:43,304
I'll have to think about it.

105
00:07:44,104 --> 00:07:45,144
Don't think about it.

106
00:07:47,444 --> 00:07:48,714
I've already made my decision.

107
00:07:49,814 --> 00:07:51,084
Darn it.

108
00:07:55,824 --> 00:07:57,454
Hey, do you think making a decision like this...

109
00:07:57,884 --> 00:07:59,154
was easy for me?

110
00:08:08,464 --> 00:08:09,464
Darn...

111
00:08:20,444 --> 00:08:24,784
He didn't let on, then cleaned out my private safe yesterday afternoon.

112
00:08:25,684 --> 00:08:28,754
This morning, while I was right here in the house, he hit the main one.

113
00:08:28,754 --> 00:08:29,954
He cleaned it out completely.

114
00:08:31,154 --> 00:08:32,494
So, he wants me to beg.

115
00:08:33,354 --> 00:08:36,764
He robbed me blind to show me how angry he is,

116
00:08:37,024 --> 00:08:38,664
and I should just raise a white flag and surrender?

117
00:09:20,034 --> 00:09:23,074
Gosh, I'm starving. I shouldn't have skipped lunch.

118
00:09:25,044 --> 00:09:26,544
What? What's this?

119
00:09:28,714 --> 00:09:30,684
Don't come home before 10pm.

120
00:09:31,344 --> 00:09:32,614
Are we having guests?

121
00:09:35,014 --> 00:09:36,884
Did Dad find out something about Mom?

122
00:09:39,124 --> 00:09:40,394
No, it's better not to know.

123
00:09:41,024 --> 00:09:43,094
What I don't know can't hurt me.

124
00:09:44,464 --> 00:09:45,734
I'm so hungry.

125
00:09:46,634 --> 00:09:48,334
What should I eat today?

126
00:09:58,504 --> 00:09:59,874
Why does this taste so bland?

127
00:10:01,244 --> 00:10:03,544
I made it the exact same way Ji Wan does.

128
00:10:07,684 --> 00:10:10,024
I guess ramyeon doesn't taste as good when you eat it alone.

129
00:10:14,124 --> 00:10:16,394
I wish Ji Wan were here to make it for me.

130
00:10:24,734 --> 00:10:26,974
You're a PE graduate with a black belt...

131
00:10:27,434 --> 00:10:29,044
and have experience in VIP protection?

132
00:10:30,044 --> 00:10:32,674
- Yes. - So why personal security?

133
00:10:33,344 --> 00:10:34,674
I've learned that this line of work...

134
00:10:35,014 --> 00:10:37,314
isn't just about physically guarding someone.

135
00:10:37,714 --> 00:10:41,754
It's protecting their daily life and their peace of mind.

136
00:10:42,354 --> 00:10:44,884
I want to be able to protect someone's life...

137
00:10:45,494 --> 00:10:47,754
and be a source of support for them.

138
00:10:47,824 --> 00:10:50,064
(Interviewer)

139
00:10:50,124 --> 00:10:53,664
That all sounds great, but our company is team-oriented,

140
00:10:53,734 --> 00:10:55,504
and your lack of team experience is a concern.

141
00:10:58,734 --> 00:11:01,804
(Conference Room 2)

142
00:11:01,874 --> 00:11:04,804
I learned more than I realized from protecting Yeong Ra.

143
00:11:05,674 --> 00:11:06,714
Mr. Lee Ji Wan!

144
00:11:08,614 --> 00:11:09,614
Yes?

145
00:11:10,284 --> 00:11:12,554
We're impressed with your VIP protection experience.

146
00:11:12,884 --> 00:11:15,624
However, we'll need verification that you performed those duties.

147
00:11:16,324 --> 00:11:18,124
You were the bodyguard for Shoe Joy's daughter, right?

148
00:11:19,094 --> 00:11:20,824
Could you get a recommendation letter from her?

149
00:11:21,424 --> 00:11:25,394
- A recommendation letter? - Submit that, and the job is yours.

150
00:11:29,364 --> 00:11:31,734
Get a recommendation letter from Yeong Ra?

151
00:11:32,334 --> 00:11:34,234
Gosh, how humiliating.

152
00:11:35,204 --> 00:11:39,314
I hoped I'd never see her again. How can I go back and ask her?

153
00:11:42,144 --> 00:11:44,144
Darn it. No way. I'm not going.

154
00:11:47,454 --> 00:11:48,554
So refreshing.

155
00:11:50,354 --> 00:11:51,724
This is amazing.

156
00:11:52,224 --> 00:11:54,554
I can't believe how different today feels from yesterday.

157
00:11:55,794 --> 00:11:57,424
This is what true freedom feels like.

158
00:11:58,894 --> 00:12:01,694
This is the first time in my life I am doing things alone.

159
00:12:03,704 --> 00:12:05,834
This kind of freedom...

160
00:12:20,454 --> 00:12:22,354
But I guess it can be a little boring, too.

161
00:12:22,984 --> 00:12:23,984
This thing called freedom.

162
00:12:28,224 --> 00:12:31,494
Gosh, a man's got to eat, but this is...

163
00:12:32,064 --> 00:12:34,634
I was going to set up her security camera,

164
00:12:34,634 --> 00:12:36,164
so I guess this is good timing.

165
00:12:37,004 --> 00:12:39,334
If it weren't a rooftop room, I wouldn't even care.

166
00:12:41,504 --> 00:12:43,344
What? That's Yeong Ra.

167
00:12:44,604 --> 00:12:47,774
- You must live around here. - What? Does she know him?

168
00:12:48,414 --> 00:12:50,984
I was just passing by, and honestly, you're totally my type.

169
00:12:51,514 --> 00:12:53,284
Could I maybe get your number?

170
00:12:55,784 --> 00:12:57,984
So, you're asking for my number.

171
00:12:57,984 --> 00:12:59,654
- Right? - What?

172
00:13:00,924 --> 00:13:02,894
Yes. You're totally my type.

173
00:13:05,634 --> 00:13:09,804
I left my phone at home. Let me type my number in yours.

174
00:13:10,034 --> 00:13:11,364
Sure, here you go.

175
00:13:12,474 --> 00:13:13,774
Hey, Park Yeong Ra!

176
00:13:17,474 --> 00:13:18,474
Ji Wan!

177
00:13:19,614 --> 00:13:22,014
What? You have a boyfriend?

178
00:13:27,314 --> 00:13:29,724
Ji Wan! Hey, what are you doing here?

179
00:13:30,154 --> 00:13:31,154
Did you come to see me?

180
00:13:31,224 --> 00:13:33,524
Yeong Ra, after that stalker, you're still not afraid?

181
00:13:33,594 --> 00:13:35,524
Don't you use the Internet or YouTube?

182
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:37,564
Why give your number to a stranger?

183
00:13:38,164 --> 00:13:39,464
Do you think I'm stupid?

184
00:13:39,764 --> 00:13:41,394
I was going to give him a fake number.

185
00:13:42,804 --> 00:13:43,804
What?

186
00:13:44,404 --> 00:13:46,404
You were going to give him a fake number?

187
00:13:46,474 --> 00:13:48,834
Yes. Who goes anywhere without their phone?

188
00:13:48,944 --> 00:13:50,674
My phone's right here in my pocket.

189
00:14:05,724 --> 00:14:08,124
But why give him a fake number?

190
00:14:08,824 --> 00:14:11,164
I've never been hit on in public, so I wanted to see what it was like.

191
00:14:12,024 --> 00:14:15,464
Sure, plenty of guys would hit on me with notes or texts in school,

192
00:14:16,604 --> 00:14:18,604
but this is my first time being asked for my number on the street.

193
00:14:20,504 --> 00:14:22,074
As a webtoon artist,

194
00:14:22,344 --> 00:14:23,644
I wanted to experience it for myself.

195
00:14:24,144 --> 00:14:26,444
Besides, I have a taser in my other pocket.

196
00:14:28,544 --> 00:14:31,314
Oh, I see.

197
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:35,954
Why did you come running and yelling like it was the end of the world?

198
00:14:36,954 --> 00:14:39,254
I guess my bodyguard instincts are still kicking in.

199
00:14:42,724 --> 00:14:44,724
Anyway, Ji Wan, why are you here?

200
00:14:45,624 --> 00:14:48,134
This... I came to install a security camera...

201
00:14:48,134 --> 00:14:49,534
by your front door.

202
00:14:49,904 --> 00:14:53,504
And since I was coming anyway, there's something I need from you.

203
00:14:54,004 --> 00:14:55,074
What is it?

204
00:14:56,904 --> 00:14:59,274
Is that right? Sure, I'll write you one.

205
00:14:59,874 --> 00:15:00,874
You will?

206
00:15:01,174 --> 00:15:03,544
On one condition. Be my webtoon assistant for one day.

207
00:15:04,144 --> 00:15:06,884
Of course. I knew there'd be a catch.

208
00:15:08,884 --> 00:15:10,954
They say there's no such thing as a free lunch.

209
00:15:12,594 --> 00:15:16,764
All right. Since I'm already here, what do you need me to do first?

210
00:15:17,524 --> 00:15:18,694
(Letter of Recommendation, Name: Lee Ji Wan)

211
00:15:18,764 --> 00:15:20,734
(During his time as my bodyguard, Mr. Lee was always vigilant...)

212
00:15:23,864 --> 00:15:25,604
While I write this recommendation letter,

213
00:15:25,874 --> 00:15:28,374
could you take a look at my story notes?

214
00:15:38,214 --> 00:15:39,414
Here. Your recommendation letter.

215
00:15:43,724 --> 00:15:44,724
Thanks.

216
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:46,654
Thank you, too.

217
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:49,624
Thanks to you, the intro is much more interesting.

218
00:15:49,924 --> 00:15:52,364
Not at all. It's all based on your experiences.

219
00:15:52,764 --> 00:15:55,464
But you helped me draw all of those memories out.

220
00:15:57,864 --> 00:15:59,204
So, about that...

221
00:16:00,374 --> 00:16:02,544
Aren't you having fun working on webtoons, too?

222
00:16:03,904 --> 00:16:04,904
Yes, it's fun.

223
00:16:05,844 --> 00:16:08,344
Then why don't you work with me on this webtoon?

224
00:16:09,044 --> 00:16:11,514
You write the story, and I'll do the drawing.

225
00:16:12,684 --> 00:16:14,714
You want us to work on it together?

226
00:16:15,314 --> 00:16:18,954
Yes. Not just as a favor, but a full-on collaboration.

227
00:16:19,754 --> 00:16:21,694
Many other creators work like this, you know.

228
00:16:26,864 --> 00:16:30,004
No. I want to follow my own path.

229
00:16:33,874 --> 00:16:37,244
So you really do want to be a bodyguard.

230
00:16:38,144 --> 00:16:40,174
You'll do great on your own.

231
00:16:43,514 --> 00:16:44,544
I'm heading out.

232
00:16:47,054 --> 00:16:50,654
And before you leave, make sure to check the security camera.

233
00:17:04,764 --> 00:17:06,174
He shot me down flat.

234
00:17:07,304 --> 00:17:08,734
Without even a hint of hesitation.

235
00:17:14,174 --> 00:17:15,984
Don't come home before 10pm.

236
00:17:17,184 --> 00:17:18,614
Maybe I should call Mom.

237
00:17:20,554 --> 00:17:21,554
No.

238
00:17:21,914 --> 00:17:24,124
If something was wrong, she would've called me by now.

239
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:27,894
I wonder if they're fighting.

240
00:17:29,964 --> 00:17:31,994
What am I going to do about Ji Hyuk's parents?

241
00:17:33,864 --> 00:17:36,064
What am I going to do about Su Bin?

242
00:17:36,134 --> 00:17:38,064
(Vice President Park Seong Jae)

243
00:17:40,204 --> 00:17:42,174
Don't come home before 10pm.

244
00:17:46,114 --> 00:17:47,144
Before 10pm?

245
00:17:50,144 --> 00:17:52,714
Is he finally going to have it out with her?

246
00:18:01,054 --> 00:18:02,054
What is this?

247
00:18:03,294 --> 00:18:04,294
Honey.

248
00:18:04,824 --> 00:18:06,034
What do you want to do with me?

249
00:18:07,564 --> 00:18:08,694
What is it that you want?

250
00:18:09,304 --> 00:18:12,164
I said I didn't want to see you when I got home, didn't I?

251
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,504
My gosh. Honey, what's gotten into you?

252
00:18:15,944 --> 00:18:20,574
Why? Why are you doing this? Let go. Let go of me! Honey!

253
00:18:21,444 --> 00:18:23,114
- Honey, please! - Come on!

254
00:18:23,114 --> 00:18:25,014
What are you doing? This is wrong!

255
00:18:27,084 --> 00:18:28,084
Honey.

256
00:18:28,884 --> 00:18:30,024
Honey.

257
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:38,324
Honey!

258
00:18:38,764 --> 00:18:42,564
Honey! Darn it!

259
00:18:42,934 --> 00:18:44,234
That jerk has lost his mind.

260
00:18:46,574 --> 00:18:49,674
No shoes and no phone, in the middle of winter.

261
00:18:51,604 --> 00:18:54,644
How could he treat me like this, no matter how angry he is?

262
00:19:03,224 --> 00:19:04,984
(Incorrect Password)

263
00:19:05,054 --> 00:19:06,054
What the...

264
00:19:09,994 --> 00:19:11,094
(Incorrect Password)

265
00:19:13,064 --> 00:19:14,134
That crazy jerk.

266
00:19:14,734 --> 00:19:16,064
He changed the passcode, too.

267
00:19:27,744 --> 00:19:28,744
Hi...

268
00:19:39,254 --> 00:19:40,294
Missus.

269
00:19:43,794 --> 00:19:44,794
Right.

270
00:19:45,624 --> 00:19:47,234
She probably told her to leave.

271
00:20:32,144 --> 00:20:33,144
Mom?

272
00:20:34,314 --> 00:20:35,974
Yeong Ra!

273
00:20:37,544 --> 00:20:40,684
You know the new passcode, don't you? Open the door, quick.

274
00:20:40,754 --> 00:20:41,854
I'm freezing to death out here.

275
00:20:42,724 --> 00:20:45,224
- Mom, did Dad find out? - He did.

276
00:20:45,784 --> 00:20:48,424
Seong Jae ratted me out. He found out everything.

277
00:20:48,624 --> 00:20:50,094
That brat told him every single thing.

278
00:20:51,464 --> 00:20:52,994
Come on. Hurry up and open the door.

279
00:20:54,964 --> 00:20:56,064
Wait here.

280
00:20:56,364 --> 00:20:57,364
What?

281
00:20:58,434 --> 00:21:01,934
Dad texted me and told me to come home after 10pm.

282
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:04,474
But something felt off, so I came home early.

283
00:21:05,574 --> 00:21:07,074
I called Dad on my way over,

284
00:21:09,644 --> 00:21:12,514
and he said under no circumstances was I to come in with you.

285
00:21:13,614 --> 00:21:14,654
He said what?

286
00:21:20,994 --> 00:21:22,524
Here, at least put this on.

287
00:21:23,464 --> 00:21:25,564
I'm going to go in and hear Dad out first.

288
00:21:27,634 --> 00:21:30,004
Hey! Park Yeong Ra!

289
00:21:30,934 --> 00:21:32,664
Mom, if you come in with me right now,

290
00:21:33,534 --> 00:21:35,204
are you sure you won't get thrown out again?

291
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:45,344
Dad.

292
00:21:48,214 --> 00:21:50,054
Why did you come home early? Don't you listen?

293
00:21:51,284 --> 00:21:52,894
I told you to come home after 10pm.

294
00:21:53,424 --> 00:21:56,624
Were you just going to leave Mom out there until 10pm?

295
00:22:01,034 --> 00:22:02,294
You knew something, didn't you?

296
00:22:04,834 --> 00:22:08,204
I knew that Woo Jin got a liver transplant.

297
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,504
And you didn't tell me?

298
00:22:14,114 --> 00:22:15,214
All of you.

299
00:22:17,214 --> 00:22:18,914
Do you take me for a fool?

300
00:22:19,454 --> 00:22:20,884
How was I supposed to tell you?

301
00:22:21,454 --> 00:22:23,824
You love and adore Mom so much.

302
00:22:27,094 --> 00:22:29,154
I see now. The way I've lived is your excuse.

303
00:22:32,624 --> 00:22:34,134
What are you going to do about Mom?

304
00:22:35,634 --> 00:22:37,034
She's not even wearing any shoes.

305
00:22:38,134 --> 00:22:39,734
You can't just leave her out there like that.

306
00:22:43,374 --> 00:22:46,474
That's because your mother sent all the housekeepers away.

307
00:22:48,074 --> 00:22:50,484
If someone were here, I'd have had them brought to her.

308
00:22:51,684 --> 00:22:52,684
Brought her what?

309
00:22:56,524 --> 00:22:58,024
Take those to her along with a pair of shoes.

310
00:23:02,154 --> 00:23:03,164
Dad.

311
00:23:05,294 --> 00:23:07,464
Give those to your mother and come back inside by yourself.

312
00:23:08,134 --> 00:23:09,734
And don't dare give her your card or any cash.

313
00:23:10,934 --> 00:23:12,234
As for why I'm doing this,

314
00:23:13,504 --> 00:23:14,904
I'll explain when you come back inside.

315
00:23:32,524 --> 00:23:33,994
Dad told me to give you these.

316
00:23:44,434 --> 00:23:46,404
Your phone is in the bag.

317
00:23:48,034 --> 00:23:49,204
Did he say anything else?

318
00:23:51,344 --> 00:23:54,544
He said he'd explain things to me if I came back inside alone.

319
00:23:56,174 --> 00:23:57,184
That crazy piece of...

320
00:23:57,844 --> 00:23:59,184
The nerve of him.

321
00:23:59,814 --> 00:24:02,414
He robs me blind and has the gall to throw me out?

322
00:24:05,454 --> 00:24:06,524
Give me the car keys.

323
00:24:07,494 --> 00:24:08,494
I don't have them.

324
00:24:09,324 --> 00:24:10,994
Dad told me to leave the keys before I came out.

325
00:24:15,664 --> 00:24:18,404
Mom. What are you going to do now?

326
00:24:27,044 --> 00:24:28,044
I'll handle it myself.

327
00:24:39,724 --> 00:24:41,594
(Hotel)

328
00:24:45,664 --> 00:24:47,964
I haven't eaten all day. I'm getting light-headed.

329
00:25:07,114 --> 00:25:10,024
To me... How could he do this to me?

330
00:25:12,624 --> 00:25:14,294
I will not take this lying down.

331
00:25:18,124 --> 00:25:20,464
He thinks I can't sell the building without the deed?

332
00:25:22,494 --> 00:25:26,064
He must have thought I'd just tremble in fear.

333
00:25:27,574 --> 00:25:30,074
That I'm just some clueless woman,

334
00:25:31,474 --> 00:25:32,944
ignorant of how the world works. Is that it?

335
00:25:54,394 --> 00:25:55,464
Go upstairs.

336
00:26:21,324 --> 00:26:23,464
Barefoot? Really?

337
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:27,694
He probably knows who gave Woo Jin the liver transplant.

338
00:26:27,994 --> 00:26:29,664
Mom said he found out everything.

339
00:26:31,164 --> 00:26:34,074
Then does he also know about Ji Eun Oh's death certificate?

340
00:26:35,574 --> 00:26:38,204
Did Dad say anything about what else he knows?

341
00:26:39,274 --> 00:26:42,074
He said he'd explain after I sent Mom away,

342
00:26:42,474 --> 00:26:44,644
but then he just said we'd talk about it later.

343
00:26:47,214 --> 00:26:48,214
But honestly,

344
00:26:48,754 --> 00:26:50,554
I didn't even want to know any more.

345
00:26:51,324 --> 00:26:52,854
I was scared...

346
00:26:53,494 --> 00:26:54,494
of what else there might be.

347
00:26:56,464 --> 00:26:59,194
That must've been hard on you. It still is.

348
00:27:00,364 --> 00:27:03,264
Seong Jae, I'm trying to be okay.

349
00:27:04,134 --> 00:27:05,134
What?

350
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:07,474
I want to be okay with this.

351
00:27:08,174 --> 00:27:11,444
All this time, Mom has lived life on her own terms.

352
00:27:11,674 --> 00:27:13,374
And she's controlled my life too.

353
00:27:14,944 --> 00:27:17,614
That's why I want to get out from under her thumb now.

354
00:27:20,454 --> 00:27:22,814
- Yeong Ra. - I'm so sorry, Seong Jae.

355
00:27:23,854 --> 00:27:25,684
I'm sorry our mom is the person she is.

356
00:27:39,204 --> 00:27:40,704
"The person she is..."

357
00:27:41,934 --> 00:27:43,504
Why should you be the one to apologize?

358
00:27:52,384 --> 00:27:53,514
No.

359
00:27:54,054 --> 00:27:56,624
Don't think about Mom. Don't waver.

360
00:28:04,094 --> 00:28:06,224
I wish I could tell Ji Wan.

361
00:28:11,404 --> 00:28:13,204
(Letter of Recommendation)

362
00:28:13,204 --> 00:28:15,804
During his time as my bodyguard, Mr. Lee Ji Wan...

363
00:28:15,874 --> 00:28:18,574
never once let his guard down.

364
00:28:19,474 --> 00:28:21,844
He was protecting me from a stalker,

365
00:28:22,074 --> 00:28:25,544
but he was so considerate of my feelings and well-being...

366
00:28:25,944 --> 00:28:29,184
that it felt like he was guarding my entire life.

367
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:32,254
He's reliable and upstanding,

368
00:28:32,424 --> 00:28:35,194
always looking out for me and giving me advice,

369
00:28:35,654 --> 00:28:37,624
and he's a kind and caring person.

370
00:28:39,724 --> 00:28:42,394
Whoever gets to have Mr. Lee as their bodyguard next,

371
00:28:42,764 --> 00:28:47,204
I hope they know they're very lucky to have him in their life.

372
00:28:53,044 --> 00:28:54,614
Am I really like that?

373
00:29:33,954 --> 00:29:35,314
What's taking him so long?

374
00:29:35,654 --> 00:29:37,654
He used to get here at 7:30am on the dot.

375
00:29:53,164 --> 00:29:54,704
It's all cold now.

376
00:29:57,004 --> 00:29:58,604
Seriously, what is he doing?

377
00:30:02,644 --> 00:30:03,784
Ji Hyuk.

378
00:30:06,754 --> 00:30:09,014
What took you so long?

379
00:30:10,424 --> 00:30:11,784
It's not even 9am yet.

380
00:30:12,984 --> 00:30:14,054
I mean...

381
00:30:14,794 --> 00:30:16,894
But you're always here so early.

382
00:30:17,694 --> 00:30:18,924
People can change.

383
00:30:21,734 --> 00:30:23,234
Do I need to get your permission to change?

385
00:30:32,344 --> 00:30:33,814
Gosh, what's with him?

386
00:30:39,314 --> 00:30:40,484
Yes, that's right.

387
00:30:40,754 --> 00:30:45,624
I need to hire protection for three. But they can't know about it.

388
00:30:47,824 --> 00:30:51,294
I don't mean tailing them. There's a dangerous person involved.

389
00:30:51,924 --> 00:30:54,864
I'm worried the family will panic if they find out,

390
00:30:55,434 --> 00:30:57,404
so I want them protected discreetly.

391
00:30:58,534 --> 00:31:00,704
Their names are Ji Eun Oh and Ji Gang Oh.

392
00:31:01,074 --> 00:31:03,474
I'll give you the third name when I send the address.

393
00:31:05,444 --> 00:31:06,544
Okay, understood.

394
00:31:12,084 --> 00:31:14,084
(Eun Oh)

395
00:31:17,384 --> 00:31:19,424
What is it? Is something wrong?

396
00:31:19,954 --> 00:31:22,094
Why do you sound so startled to hear from me?

397
00:31:22,824 --> 00:31:23,824
What?

398
00:31:24,094 --> 00:31:26,834
Am I not allowed to call you either?

399
00:31:27,394 --> 00:31:30,264
"You either?" Did someone tell you not to call them?

400
00:31:31,004 --> 00:31:32,034
No, that's not it.

401
00:31:33,374 --> 00:31:36,104
I was just calling to see if something was wrong with Ji Hyuk.

402
00:31:37,544 --> 00:31:38,704
By any chance,

403
00:31:39,274 --> 00:31:43,174
is Ji Hyuk in some kind of trouble? Something work-related?

404
00:31:44,914 --> 00:31:48,554
I've been a bit busy myself, so I haven't talked to Ji Hyuk.

405
00:31:51,954 --> 00:31:54,954
So I guess nothing's wrong then?

406
00:31:55,794 --> 00:31:57,764
But why do you ask?

407
00:31:58,364 --> 00:31:59,364
It's just that...

408
00:32:00,434 --> 00:32:04,464
Ever since he got back from Tokyo, he's been acting strange toward me.

409
00:32:05,164 --> 00:32:07,604
He came back a completely different person.

410
00:32:09,234 --> 00:32:10,344
A different person?

411
00:32:11,574 --> 00:32:13,044
It seems like it's just with me...

412
00:32:16,344 --> 00:32:17,344
Actually...

413
00:32:18,044 --> 00:32:19,314
Never mind.

414
00:32:19,984 --> 00:32:21,384
If you say nothing's wrong, then it's fine.

415
00:32:22,314 --> 00:32:23,354
I'll let you go, then.

416
00:32:40,434 --> 00:32:43,304
Hey, I didn't say you could come in.

417
00:32:46,344 --> 00:32:49,144
Ji Hyuk, why are you being like this to me?

418
00:32:49,574 --> 00:32:51,614
The way you replied to my text, too.

419
00:32:51,914 --> 00:32:55,314
Is there a big problem at work or something?

420
00:32:55,684 --> 00:32:58,754
- Is that why you're so sensitive? - Say there's a big problem at work.

421
00:32:59,124 --> 00:33:02,054
Why would I take it out on you?

422
00:33:02,924 --> 00:33:05,694
What would company business have to do with you?

423
00:33:10,034 --> 00:33:12,704
You really have to ask?

424
00:33:15,674 --> 00:33:17,144
Are you asking that...

425
00:33:17,904 --> 00:33:20,514
based on my personal feelings for you?

426
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:22,114
Of course, I am.

427
00:33:22,614 --> 00:33:24,244
You told me you liked me.

428
00:33:28,684 --> 00:33:30,984
Something's come up at work.

429
00:33:32,054 --> 00:33:33,694
And I'm not going to tell you what it is.

430
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:36,224
We're not at the point where I share company secrets.

431
00:33:37,694 --> 00:33:39,864
I'm not asking for company secrets.

432
00:33:40,194 --> 00:33:42,334
I'm asking why you're treating me differently.

433
00:33:43,734 --> 00:33:45,104
I'm so preoccupied,

434
00:33:45,904 --> 00:33:47,774
I can't even think about my own feelings.

435
00:33:49,674 --> 00:33:50,844
I don't have the bandwidth to be considerate...

436
00:33:53,044 --> 00:33:54,244
or worry about anyone else.

437
00:33:58,584 --> 00:34:00,384
Is work really that...

438
00:34:00,784 --> 00:34:03,414
Right. I have an important conference call.

439
00:34:03,884 --> 00:34:04,884
It's in three minutes.

440
00:34:14,464 --> 00:34:15,464
Okay.

441
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:26,544
I wonder what's going on at the company.

442
00:34:28,174 --> 00:34:30,314
Gosh, what was I thinking?

443
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:35,214
He's so overwhelmed with work, and I'm just clinging to him.

444
00:34:42,724 --> 00:34:43,924
I'm being so needy,

445
00:34:45,224 --> 00:34:46,224
getting all upset.

446
00:34:48,334 --> 00:34:50,064
As if we were a couple or something.

447
00:34:51,664 --> 00:34:53,264
But we're not.

448
00:34:53,904 --> 00:34:54,974
Not yet.

449
00:34:58,074 --> 00:34:59,704

Hello, sir. I hope you've been well.

455
00:35:30,444 --> 00:35:32,904
There's something I'd like to consult you on.

456
00:35:33,644 --> 00:35:35,274
When would be a good time for you?

457
00:35:38,944 --> 00:35:41,154
Me? Doing so well I don't need your advice?

458
00:35:42,684 --> 00:35:43,754
I'm only just getting used to things...

459
00:35:45,684 --> 00:35:46,854
and finding my footing.

460
00:35:50,124 --> 00:35:52,294
You want to quick-sell the Apgujeong apartment?

461
00:35:53,264 --> 00:35:54,894
The Cheongdam-dong condo is also an option.

462
00:35:55,294 --> 00:35:56,534
Just sell whichever one goes first.

463
00:35:57,304 --> 00:35:58,864
List it for ten percent below market value.

464
00:35:59,264 --> 00:36:02,174
Get me a deposit within one week, and I'll double your commission.

465

The Apgujeong apartment has a buyer ready to sign now.

466
00:36:06,974 --> 00:36:08,474
I'll give them a call right away,

467
00:36:08,774 --> 00:36:11,444
so why don't you wait a little and sign the contract before you go?

468
00:36:13,344 --> 00:36:15,884
Fine. As long as they can come right now.

469
00:36:22,194 --> 00:36:23,194
Ma'am.

470
00:36:23,624 --> 00:36:26,464
You should have told me about the mortgage on it.

471
00:36:27,294 --> 00:36:28,594
You already knew about that one.

472
00:36:28,894 --> 00:36:30,334
I'm not talking about the bank loan.

473
00:36:30,964 --> 00:36:32,764
You've taken out an additional mortgage.

474
00:36:33,204 --> 00:36:36,634
That has to be paid off first before the sale can go through.

475
00:36:37,604 --> 00:36:39,174
An additional mortgage? What are you talking about?

476
00:36:42,574 --> 00:36:43,574

What do you mean the lien can't be removed?

485
00:37:31,664 --> 00:37:33,164
My husband set it up without my knowledge.

486

Regardless of the circumstances,

487
00:37:36,764 --> 00:37:39,664
The fact that the mortgage is on the property registry means...

and the mortgage agreement were all properly filed.

490
00:37:45,804 --> 00:37:48,274
Exactly! And I'm telling you he did it behind my back.

491
00:37:49,274 --> 00:37:52,984
No, look. What do I have to do to undo this?

492
00:37:53,184 --> 00:37:55,254
You'll either have to work it out with your husband directly...

493
00:37:55,614 --> 00:37:57,554
or file a lawsuit to nullify the mortgage.

Insufficient funds?

That's impossible. Try it again.

499
00:38:26,084 --> 00:38:28,314
Do you have another card, ma'am?

500
00:38:30,354 --> 00:38:32,554
So this is why you only left me this one debit card?

501
00:38:35,394 --> 00:38:36,954
It hasn't even been an hour,

502
00:38:37,894 --> 00:38:39,564
so just charge me for a 30-minute consultation.

503
00:38:40,794 --> 00:38:41,794
Okay.

504
00:39:06,654 --> 00:39:08,794

00:39:46,894 --> 00:39:49,094
Seong Jae, what brings you here?

515
00:39:50,564 --> 00:39:51,664
I was just in the neighborhood.

516
00:39:52,304 --> 00:39:54,674
And I saw a fruit truck with some great-looking tangerines.

517
00:39:55,674 --> 00:39:59,074
You shouldn't have. We have tangerines.

518
00:40:03,014 --> 00:40:04,844
Seong Jae, you're here.

519
00:40:05,514 --> 00:40:06,684
So you were home, Su Bin.

520
00:40:10,214 --> 00:40:11,684
Su Bin, go upstairs. Now.

521
00:40:12,684 --> 00:40:16,054
Dad, why? Can't I stay while he's here?

522
00:40:16,654 --> 00:40:18,024
I doubt he came to see me.

523
00:40:18,964 --> 00:40:21,634
She's right. Why would I come here to see Su Bin?

524
00:40:23,064 --> 00:40:24,464
Don't get the wrong idea.

525
00:40:25,334 --> 00:40:26,664
I'm just here as myself.

526
00:40:28,234 --> 00:40:29,604
Just because Su Bin and I made one mistake,

527
00:40:30,074 --> 00:40:31,874
were you really planning on cutting me out completely?

528
00:40:33,144 --> 00:40:36,244
Of course not. That's not it.

529
00:40:36,544 --> 00:40:38,844
Come on in, Seong Jae. Have you had dinner?

530
00:40:39,244 --> 00:40:41,114
I just made some savory pancakes. Would you like some?

531
00:40:42,154 --> 00:40:43,984
I'm glad I broke up with Su Bin.

532
00:40:44,924 --> 00:40:46,654
Especially with what Ji Hyuk is going through,

00:40:47,894 --> 00:40:49,994
it's a relief that I'm not adding to your troubles.

534
00:40:52,164 --> 00:40:53,864
No, that's okay. I was just passing by.

535
00:40:55,734 --> 00:40:57,834
You should comb your hair. What a mess.

536
00:40:59,464 --> 00:41:00,464
What?

537
00:41:00,904 --> 00:41:01,904
Slob.

538
00:41:03,704 --> 00:41:05,904
In any case, you're here, so come on in.

539
00:41:06,274 --> 00:41:09,344
- I can't. I have to go. - Your eldest son is here. What?

540
00:41:11,944 --> 00:41:12,944
Seong Jae.

541
00:41:19,884 --> 00:41:21,654
He said he saw some tangerines...

542
00:41:22,024 --> 00:41:23,724
and brought them because they made him think of us.

543
00:41:24,324 --> 00:41:26,864
Now that Ji Hyuk is here, come in and eat with us first.

544
00:41:27,294 --> 00:41:28,464
I have a meeting tonight.

545
00:41:29,234 --> 00:41:31,334
- I'm heading out. - Okay, see you around.

546
00:41:31,634 --> 00:41:32,704
I'll be on my way, then.

547
00:41:39,204 --> 00:41:41,914
Was Seong Jae always that smooth?

548
00:41:42,944 --> 00:41:44,484
You know how he is. Once he decides, he sees it through.

549
00:41:45,244 --> 00:41:47,184
How could Seong Jae ever cut ties with you two?

550
00:42:02,434 --> 00:42:04,004
He shouldn't be doing this.

551
00:42:04,534 --> 00:42:06,504
Why did he suddenly show up at our house?

552
00:42:07,804 --> 00:42:11,074
Is he saying we can just be friends again like before?

553
00:42:12,044 --> 00:42:15,644
Is he that over me that he can just come to our house?

554
00:42:20,314 --> 00:42:22,154
But then, what was with that look in his eyes?

555
00:42:23,184 --> 00:42:24,754
Why did he look so sad again?

556
00:42:25,854 --> 00:42:27,794
Why does he look like he's struggling so much?

557
00:42:35,034 --> 00:42:37,634
I went ahead and booked that hot spring resort.

558
00:42:38,064 --> 00:42:39,504
You two just need to pick a date and let me know.

559
00:42:40,504 --> 00:42:42,174
A hot spring, all of a sudden?

560
00:42:42,904 --> 00:42:44,444
Before you go back to work,

561
00:42:44,844 --> 00:42:46,374
I want you two to go enjoy a trip to the hot springs.

562
00:42:47,514 --> 00:42:48,774
Ji Hyuk.

563
00:42:49,074 --> 00:42:52,644
My goodness. Then we can go on your day off.

564
00:42:52,714 --> 00:42:56,454
Once I'm working, I'll be busy, and finding time will be tough.

565
00:42:57,184 --> 00:42:58,184
Should we?

566
00:42:59,684 --> 00:43:01,394
So you haven't started dating anyone?

567
00:43:02,794 --> 00:43:04,564
I've been too busy.

568
00:43:06,194 --> 00:43:10,434
Eun Oh grew up strong and secure, all thanks to her parents' love.

569
00:43:11,004 --> 00:43:12,534
But still, after her father passed away,

570
00:43:13,364 --> 00:43:15,474
it seems she had to become the head of the family.

571
00:43:16,004 --> 00:43:17,574
She must need someone to lean on.

572
00:43:18,104 --> 00:43:20,004
Show her that she can count on you.

573
00:43:22,044 --> 00:43:26,014
Dad, you said I wasn't good enough. Why the sudden change of heart?

574
00:43:26,314 --> 00:43:30,184
No, the Spring... I mean, seeing the way Eun Oh treats me,

575
00:43:30,784 --> 00:43:32,224
I just realized that everyone in life...

576
00:43:32,724 --> 00:43:34,954
needs someone to lean on.

577
00:43:36,994 --> 00:43:37,994
That's true.

578
00:43:39,624 --> 00:43:40,764
Especially Eun Oh.

579
00:43:42,594 --> 00:43:43,594
Ji Hyuk.

580
00:43:44,034 --> 00:43:46,564
Your father seems to really like her.

581
00:43:47,434 --> 00:43:49,734
Maybe I could just...

582
00:43:50,434 --> 00:43:51,704
meet her sometime?

583
00:43:52,144 --> 00:43:53,744
I could also take a look around your office.

584
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:56,044
No, Mom.

585
00:43:56,574 --> 00:43:57,584
Please don't.

586
00:43:57,914 --> 00:43:59,244
Why not?

587
00:44:00,544 --> 00:44:02,384
You never know. My feelings might change.

588
00:44:03,014 --> 00:44:05,124
I've just been so swamped with work lately.

589
00:44:05,754 --> 00:44:08,354
What do you mean, you'll change your mind?

590
00:44:09,924 --> 00:44:11,464
You never know what's going to happen.

591
00:44:11,824 --> 00:44:14,734
- You two rest up. I'm going up. - Hey, Ji Hyuk.

592
00:44:17,864 --> 00:44:21,904
It looks like Eun Oh isn't returning his feelings.

593
00:44:23,904 --> 00:44:24,974

Mom! Eun Oh also thinks the location is nice!

596
00:44:29,874 --> 00:44:30,914
What?

597
00:44:31,314 --> 00:44:32,314
Really?

598
00:44:33,384 --> 00:44:35,184
- Does it look good? - Yes.

599
00:44:35,184 --> 00:44:37,954
- Oh, my. - Since I work in interior design,

600
00:44:38,454 --> 00:44:40,124
I know the whole capital area like the back of my hand.

601
00:44:40,384 --> 00:44:41,424
I've been to that neighborhood before.

602
00:44:41,694 --> 00:44:44,894
- It's a vibrant neighborhood. - Should I sign this lease?

603
00:44:45,424 --> 00:44:46,424
Go for it.

604
00:44:47,294 --> 00:44:50,394
But that means we need to hire a manager for this place soon.

605
00:44:50,734 --> 00:44:52,564
That way, Mom can cut back on her hours, too.

606
00:44:52,834 --> 00:44:53,834
Right.

607
00:44:54,104 --> 00:44:56,804
Gang Oh's going to be rolling in it, right?

608
00:44:57,174 --> 00:44:59,274
I'm ready to work myself to the bone.

609
00:45:01,174 --> 00:45:04,884
Speaking of work, how about that CEO who'd do anything for you?

610
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:06,244
He said he'd visit often.

611
00:45:06,514 --> 00:45:07,984
Oh, well...

612
00:45:08,454 --> 00:45:10,214
He's just been really busy at work lately.

613
00:45:11,154 --> 00:45:14,494
You say that, but you don't sound very convincing.

614
00:45:15,524 --> 00:45:16,524
I am not!

615
00:45:17,664 --> 00:45:21,564
Gang Oh. Stop teasing your sister, and let's go home, okay?

616
00:45:21,664 --> 00:45:22,664

618
00:45:33,404 --> 00:45:34,814
Of course, Eun Oh did a great job.

619
00:45:37,074 --> 00:45:38,084
This should be fine as is.

620
00:46:01,304 --> 00:46:03,174
- I'm home. - Hey.

621
00:46:03,874 --> 00:46:05,304
Hey, Mom.

622
00:46:05,544 --> 00:46:07,574
- Ji Hyuk. - I'm home.

623
00:46:07,574 --> 00:46:10,274
- Yes. - You're home early today.

624
00:46:10,714 --> 00:46:13,744
I was thinking I'd have dinner at home today...

625
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:15,354
and get some work done here.

626
00:46:15,784 --> 00:46:17,414
I'm still tired from that work trip.

627
00:46:17,954 --> 00:46:18,954
I see.

628
00:46:19,524 --> 00:46:22,494
Then, I'll make you pot rice, so go get some rest.

629
00:46:22,754 --> 00:46:25,524
- Okay. - Pot rice? Do we have no abalone?

630
00:46:25,594 --> 00:46:26,994
I'll run out and grab some.

631
00:46:27,324 --> 00:46:31,104
- No abalone, but I did buy oysters. - Oysters.

632
00:46:31,164 --> 00:46:32,534
- Yes. - Oysters are good, too. That works.

633
00:46:32,604 --> 00:46:34,404
- They're fresh, right? - Yes, they look great.

634
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:36,134
We have green onions and...

635
00:46:37,204 --> 00:46:38,804

Mom?

640
00:46:58,364 --> 00:47:01,434
Mom! Are you okay? You're not hurt, are you?

641
00:47:01,494 --> 00:47:04,464
- Didn't you hurt your hip? - Gosh. No, I'm fine.

I was just about to tell you.

646
00:47:15,814 --> 00:47:18,714
Your dad made oyster rice. Go on downstairs.

648
00:47:20,584 --> 00:47:22,354

At this rate, you're going to be a better cook than Mom.

Trust me. You can make anything if you just follow YouTube videos.

00:48:02,454 --> 00:48:03,454
By the way, Ji Hyuk,

655
00:48:04,054 --> 00:48:07,624
I was curious about your work, so I peeked at your laptop.

656
00:48:07,964 --> 00:48:10,934
"Awaiting Heart Transplant." Why were you looking that up?

657
00:48:12,904 --> 00:48:14,804
Oh, that...

658
00:48:15,604 --> 00:48:16,734
At work,

659
00:48:17,334 --> 00:48:19,274
one of my coworkers is in that situation.

660
00:48:20,044 --> 00:48:21,414
So I got curious and looked it up.

661
00:48:22,174 --> 00:48:25,714
A heart transplant? That's serious. How old is this coworker?

662
00:48:27,084 --> 00:48:29,514
Early to mid-30s, I think.

663
00:48:30,414 --> 00:48:32,084
So they're your age.

664
00:48:33,424 --> 00:48:34,424
Yes.

665
00:48:35,354 --> 00:48:36,654
Is it a guy or a girl?

666
00:48:37,624 --> 00:48:38,624
A guy.

667
00:48:39,164 --> 00:48:42,664
Oh, no. That's so young. How awful.

668
00:48:43,734 --> 00:48:44,864
What's so terrible about it?

669
00:48:45,834 --> 00:48:48,934
Everyone dies eventually. It's the same for everybody.

670
00:48:50,134 --> 00:48:51,144
I guess you're right.

671
00:48:51,604 --> 00:48:53,604
One of my friends from high school...

672
00:48:54,074 --> 00:48:56,944
died at 30, and another at 42.

673
00:48:58,084 --> 00:49:00,744
But I wonder, is that unfair? Or is it fair?

674
00:49:01,484 --> 00:49:05,284
We all die, but it feels unfair to die sooner than everyone else.

675
00:49:06,654 --> 00:49:07,654
What's so unfair about it?

676
00:49:08,424 --> 00:49:11,764
I just think Koreans get way too worked up about death.

677
00:49:13,524 --> 00:49:16,464
You're right. Back in the day, if you said that to an elder,

678
00:49:16,594 --> 00:49:17,634
they'd get really upset.

679
00:49:18,904 --> 00:49:20,764
So, is your coworker married?

680
00:49:22,634 --> 00:49:24,034
No.

681
00:49:25,574 --> 00:49:28,144
That's a small mercy, then.

682
00:49:30,174 --> 00:49:31,184
I guess so.

683
00:49:32,314 --> 00:49:35,014
So when is the right time to die, then?

684
00:49:36,114 --> 00:49:38,024
Honey, what do you think is the best age to go?

685
00:49:38,584 --> 00:49:39,924
What a question. There's no right age.

686
00:49:40,284 --> 00:49:41,624
I agree with Ji Hyuk.

687
00:49:42,054 --> 00:49:43,394
You never know when your number is up.

688
00:49:44,424 --> 00:49:48,264
That's true. These days, a lot of young people have diabetes,

689
00:49:48,534 --> 00:49:50,364
and there are quite a few deaths from heart attacks.

690
00:49:52,734 --> 00:49:54,874
I hope you feel the same way when it's my time to go, Mom.

691
00:49:56,004 --> 00:50:00,804
You can't see what's coming, but people think they'll reach 100.

692
00:50:01,004 --> 00:50:03,614
Always chasing one thing or another. Goodness.

693
00:50:04,844 --> 00:50:05,844
You're right, dear.

694
00:50:06,184 --> 00:50:08,014
We could be saying goodbye tomorrow for all we know,

695
00:50:08,784 --> 00:50:10,284
so let's be more loving to each other.

696
00:50:11,154 --> 00:50:12,154
Honey.

697
00:50:12,484 --> 00:50:14,354
- Yes? - Open wide.

698
00:50:14,854 --> 00:50:17,494
Goodness, here.

699
00:50:18,394 --> 00:50:19,394
This is delicious.

700
00:50:20,494 --> 00:50:22,464
Mom, what about me? Feed me.

701
00:50:23,794 --> 00:50:25,334
Look at you. This is a first.

702
00:50:26,004 --> 00:50:28,574
Okay, for my son, too. Open wide!

703
00:50:29,204 --> 00:50:30,204
My goodness.

704
00:50:31,974 --> 00:50:36,474
It's a shame about your coworker, but we learned a big lesson. Right?

705
00:50:39,014 --> 00:50:40,544
Wow, this is especially good today.

706
00:50:44,384 --> 00:50:46,754
- Oh, I have to have some more. - Okay, I'll get you more.

707
00:50:48,894 --> 00:50:49,894
Take this with you.

708
00:50:50,924 --> 00:50:51,924
What's this?

709
00:50:52,364 --> 00:50:54,534
Mom packed you a lunch since you're working on a Saturday.

710
00:50:55,234 --> 00:50:58,834
I packed extra, just in case the CEO is there, too.

711
00:50:59,364 --> 00:51:01,134
- Ji Hyuk? - Yes.

712
00:51:01,434 --> 00:51:02,734
He might not even be there.

713
00:51:03,504 --> 00:51:06,574
If he's not there, just eat yours and bring the rest.

714
00:51:12,844 --> 00:51:15,314
Dad, it's delicious.

715
00:51:16,454 --> 00:51:18,684
I'll be late tonight. I've got a lot of work to do.

716
00:51:18,754 --> 00:51:20,354
- I'm off. - Okay, have a good day.

717
00:51:20,424 --> 00:51:22,694
- Mom, I'm heading out. - Okay, have a good one.

718
00:51:24,864 --> 00:51:26,594
Ji Hyuk ate a full breakfast before he left.

719
00:51:27,164 --> 00:51:28,694
He barely ever eats breakfast.

720
00:51:29,834 --> 00:51:31,864
Maybe work is so stressful...

721
00:51:32,404 --> 00:51:34,804
that he can't last until lunch on an empty stomach?

722
00:51:35,474 --> 00:51:37,734
That must be it. He's even working on the weekend.

723
00:51:38,644 --> 00:51:41,914
So maybe he's been coming home early for a home-cooked dinner?

724
00:51:42,974 --> 00:51:44,884
I should put more effort into dinner, starting tonight.

725
00:51:45,444 --> 00:51:46,844
He said he'd be late tonight, though.

726
00:51:47,744 --> 00:51:48,754
That's right.

727
00:51:49,514 --> 00:51:51,954
- I'm getting ready for work, honey. - Okay.

728
00:51:56,694 --> 00:51:57,724
A home-cooked meal?

729
00:52:25,624 --> 00:52:28,294
(CEO's Office)

730
00:52:45,174 --> 00:52:46,174
Seong Jae.

731
00:52:47,044 --> 00:52:48,774
Where are you? At home?

732
00:52:49,344 --> 00:52:52,014
No, I just got to the office.

733
00:52:54,014 --> 00:52:55,584
It's Saturday.

734
00:52:58,524 --> 00:53:01,324
All right. I'll swing by the office later.

735
00:53:05,294 --> 00:53:06,324
Unbelievable.

736
00:53:17,674 --> 00:53:18,774
Did I startle you?

737
00:53:20,004 --> 00:53:21,004
Yes.

738
00:53:21,674 --> 00:53:22,914
You're here too?

739
00:53:23,644 --> 00:53:24,914
I'm here to work.

740
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:28,084
What, do I need permission to come in on a Saturday now?

741
00:53:30,214 --> 00:53:33,424
It's just... Just don't overwork yourself.

742
00:53:34,584 --> 00:53:36,824
Hey. What time are you having lunch?

743
00:53:38,694 --> 00:53:42,234
My mom packed enough tofu pockets for two.

744
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:45,064
To thank you for helping out during Christmas.

745
00:53:45,334 --> 00:53:47,264
She said to share them with you if you were here.

746
00:53:51,804 --> 00:53:52,874
Sorry.

747
00:53:53,474 --> 00:53:55,614
The thing is, I don't eat tofu pockets.

748
00:53:56,114 --> 00:53:57,144
I don't like them.

749
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:04,114
Ji Hyuk.

750
00:54:11,394 --> 00:54:14,064
Why are you lying to me?

751
00:54:15,634 --> 00:54:17,364
You don't eat tofu pockets?

752
00:54:17,864 --> 00:54:20,904
You and I have eaten tofu pockets together more than ten times.

753
00:54:23,874 --> 00:54:25,404
Tastes change.

754
00:54:27,244 --> 00:54:28,244
No.

755
00:54:28,844 --> 00:54:30,074
That's just an excuse.

756
00:54:31,274 --> 00:54:33,014
The way you've been treating me has changed,

757
00:54:34,184 --> 00:54:35,784
and I feel like there's a reason.

758
00:54:38,524 --> 00:54:39,624
Just tell me straight.

759
00:54:40,454 --> 00:54:43,194
Don't beat around the bush like you always do.

760
00:54:45,864 --> 00:54:46,864
Why...

761
00:54:48,164 --> 00:54:50,094
are you treating me differently?

762
00:54:53,704 --> 00:54:54,974
The reason is,

763
00:55:01,414 --> 00:55:04,474
I feel I've gotten too close to people on a personal level,

764
00:55:04,844 --> 00:55:06,744
like Su Jeong and you, Eun Oh.

765
00:55:08,084 --> 00:55:11,154
I feel like I've let my guard down too much while at the think tank.

766
00:55:12,084 --> 00:55:13,784
So I'm trying to maintain a professional distance.

767
00:55:16,154 --> 00:55:18,194
And I'm supposed to believe that?

768
00:55:20,994 --> 00:55:22,464
What's so hard to believe?

769
00:55:23,764 --> 00:55:26,934
What will you do if you wear him out and he just gives up?

770
00:55:27,334 --> 00:55:28,334
Would you be okay with that?

771
00:55:29,004 --> 00:55:30,234
You have to give him a sign.

772
00:55:31,204 --> 00:55:32,204
Let him know.

773
00:55:32,774 --> 00:55:34,814
"It's okay to tell me how you feel now."

774
00:55:35,844 --> 00:55:37,874
Make it obvious enough for him to get the hint. Got it?

775
00:55:51,124 --> 00:55:52,124
What if I told you...

776
00:55:53,924 --> 00:55:55,494
that I like you?

777
00:55:59,464 --> 00:56:00,464
I...

778
00:56:01,874 --> 00:56:03,704
The misunderstandings I had about you,

779
00:56:05,544 --> 00:56:06,644
they're all cleared up now.

780
00:56:08,914 --> 00:56:12,184
Your decision to marry the daughter of Haneul Construction without love.

781
00:56:13,314 --> 00:56:15,454
I know it wasn't just because of your principles.

782
00:56:16,484 --> 00:56:17,854
I understand all of that now.

783
00:56:20,054 --> 00:56:21,084
So the misunderstanding...

784
00:56:23,794 --> 00:56:25,124
is cleared up?

785
00:56:27,864 --> 00:56:28,864
And so,

786
00:56:30,194 --> 00:56:32,364
I've forgiven you for everything.

787
00:56:42,274 --> 00:56:43,344
I see.

788
00:56:47,244 --> 00:56:49,354
And what if I mean it...

789
00:56:50,554 --> 00:56:52,254
when I say I like you again?

790
00:56:55,254 --> 00:56:56,254
Even so,

791
00:56:56,824 --> 00:56:58,324
is this still how you want to treat me?

792
00:57:01,694 --> 00:57:02,934
What's the point, Eun Oh?

793
00:57:19,414 --> 00:57:20,844
Timing really is...

794
00:57:25,454 --> 00:57:26,654
everything, isn't it?

795
00:57:32,294 --> 00:57:33,494
I'm sorry, Eun Oh.

796
00:57:34,524 --> 00:57:35,594
It seems we...

797
00:57:36,234 --> 00:57:37,334
just missed each other.

798
00:57:39,504 --> 00:57:40,764
I've already moved on.

799
00:57:42,774 --> 00:57:44,944
Moved on?

800
00:57:46,104 --> 00:57:47,274
What does that even mean?

801
00:57:48,414 --> 00:57:49,974
The human heart is a funny thing.

802
00:57:51,444 --> 00:57:53,344
While I was on my business trip,

803
00:57:54,984 --> 00:57:57,854
I did some thinking about my position as CEO.

804
00:57:59,154 --> 00:58:01,054
The CEO and a team leader...

805
00:58:02,024 --> 00:58:04,354
Don't you think it's ridiculous for us to be dating at work?

806
00:58:08,064 --> 00:58:09,594
Just because you had that thought,

807
00:58:10,734 --> 00:58:12,434
your feelings just...

808
00:58:13,664 --> 00:58:14,804
They can change, just like that?

809
00:58:16,404 --> 00:58:18,004
That's why I said it's a funny thing.

810
00:58:20,474 --> 00:58:21,674
I think I've just been...

811
00:58:23,074 --> 00:58:24,674
worn out by it all.

812
00:58:27,644 --> 00:58:30,454
And I think you were right. We're beyond repair.

813
00:58:35,124 --> 00:58:37,194
I'm sorry, Eun Oh.

814
00:58:39,494 --> 00:58:40,724
From now on,

815
00:58:43,364 --> 00:58:44,734
I'm going to keep things strictly professional.

816
00:58:49,504 --> 00:58:50,774
What you just said...

817
00:58:52,844 --> 00:58:54,244
Do you really mean it?

818
00:58:55,774 --> 00:58:56,974
Yes, I mean it.

819
00:58:58,844 --> 00:59:00,684
So you should stop thinking about me...

820
00:59:00,944 --> 00:59:02,984
and just focus on the Thirty Houses Project.

821
00:59:03,784 --> 00:59:06,024
About the official name for the project...

822
00:59:06,924 --> 00:59:09,224
I've decided to call it "Living Life Thirty."

823

(CEO's Office)

824
00:59:54,104 --> 00:59:56,304
For a mortgage suit of this scale,

825
00:59:56,304 --> 00:59:58,274
we require a 100,000-dollar retainer.

826
01:00:01,304 --> 01:00:02,414
A hundred thousand dollars?

827
01:00:03,374 --> 01:00:04,674
I can come up with it.

829
01:00:11,924 --> 01:00:12,924
What is it?

830
01:00:15,394 --> 01:00:17,224
- Operating expenses? - Yes.

831
01:00:17,224 --> 01:00:19,124
This week's operating cost payment hasn't come through.

832
01:00:19,994 --> 01:00:21,124
Just wait a few days.

833
01:00:21,794 --> 01:00:25,164
Ma'am. We don't work on credit.

834
01:00:25,904 --> 01:00:27,204
You're already two days late.

835
01:00:27,464 --> 01:00:28,804
I said I'll pay you!

836
01:00:29,034 --> 01:00:31,604
We have 100 men deployed to catch Han Woo Jin.

837
01:00:33,204 --> 01:00:35,574
Send the money within an hour, or I'm pulling everyone out.

Hey, Ms. Shin...

01:00:39,714 --> 01:00:40,814
Darn it.

840
01:00:41,914 --> 01:00:44,084
Do you have any idea how much money I've paid you?

841
01:00:46,884 --> 01:00:47,884
No way.

842
01:00:48,724 --> 01:00:49,824
I have to catch Woo Jin.

(Gaon Foundation)

850
01:01:24,194 --> 01:01:25,924
HQ called this morning and said...

851
01:01:25,924 --> 01:01:27,664
they emptied out the office yesterday.

852
01:01:27,964 --> 01:01:29,594
And they told me I'm on paid leave for now.

853
01:01:31,964 --> 01:01:33,464
He went after the foundation, too?

854
01:01:41,274 --> 01:01:43,474
You're pushing me to the brink, Park Jin Seok.

855
01:01:47,214 --> 01:01:48,654
He doesn't want me to beg.

856
01:01:52,024 --> 01:01:54,454
Ms. Ko Seong Hui, please be advised that as of today,

857
01:01:54,524 --> 01:01:56,394
you are relieved of your duties as Gaon Foundation's director.

861
01:02:12,704 --> 01:02:14,604
Sir, your wife is here.

862
01:02:16,814 --> 01:02:17,944
So she came here.

863
01:02:19,944 --> 01:02:20,984
Send her in.

864
01:02:29,724 --> 01:02:31,924
I see you came to the office instead of home.

865
01:02:33,194 --> 01:02:34,694
I told them I didn't want any tea.

866
01:02:36,194 --> 01:02:37,794
So you're just trying to make this quick?

867
01:02:38,864 --> 01:02:41,134
You don't want a long speech, do you?

868
01:02:42,034 --> 01:02:43,034
I don't know about that.

869
01:02:46,944 --> 01:02:48,504
You knew I'd come today, didn't you?

870
01:02:50,174 --> 01:02:51,174
Yes, today.

871
01:02:52,314 --> 01:02:55,254
I left you 2,000 dollars in that account.

872
01:02:55,454 --> 01:02:59,424
That'll last you what, three days at a hotel?

873
01:03:01,454 --> 01:03:02,524
Honey.

874
01:03:03,094 --> 01:03:05,824
You should've only taken the things you bought for me.

875
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:09,394
How could you steal my own assets? That's so cheap.

876
01:03:10,434 --> 01:03:13,204
That is no way for Shoe Joy's chairman to behave.

877
01:03:16,404 --> 01:03:18,974
I have no idea what you're talking about.

878
01:03:20,744 --> 01:03:21,744
Right.

879
01:03:22,614 --> 01:03:24,674
So, what brings you all the way to the office?

880
01:03:27,284 --> 01:03:29,584
I came because you've decided to end this once and for all.

881
01:03:30,284 --> 01:03:31,454
I want a divorce.

882
01:03:32,054 --> 01:03:33,054
A divorce?

883
01:03:35,594 --> 01:03:36,854
Why would I give you a divorce?

884
01:03:41,494 --> 01:03:42,594
You're refusing...

885
01:03:43,564 --> 01:03:44,664
to divorce me?

886
01:03:55,444 --> 01:03:57,444

Once the Image Modeling Project...

888
01:04:00,944 --> 01:04:02,184
and the Made to Your Taste Project start,

889
01:04:02,184 --> 01:04:03,454
it'll be a game-changer.

890
01:04:04,154 --> 01:04:05,984
I'm really enjoying this process, Seong Jae.

891
01:04:06,354 --> 01:04:08,554
Is that why you're here, working on a Saturday?

892
01:04:11,754 --> 01:04:13,064
When you're dying?

893
01:04:15,794 --> 01:04:18,834
Look, if you don't get a heart transplant,

894
01:04:19,434 --> 01:04:20,964
they said you'll die within a few months.

895
01:04:21,934 --> 01:04:23,804
How can you care about work at a time like this?

896
01:04:24,804 --> 01:04:26,004
Hey, Ji Hyuk.

897
01:04:26,574 --> 01:04:28,044
This isn't right.

898
01:04:28,574 --> 01:04:30,044
Your parents need to know about this.

899
01:04:30,044 --> 01:04:31,944
You're the one who's not getting it.

900
01:04:32,814 --> 01:04:33,814
Seong Jae.

901
01:04:34,114 --> 01:04:36,214
It's best if my parents don't know for as long as possible.

902
01:04:36,684 --> 01:04:37,714
If they find out ten days before,

903
01:04:37,714 --> 01:04:38,884
they will suffer through ten miserable days.

904
01:04:38,884 --> 01:04:41,154
If they find out a month before, it's a month of misery for them.

905
01:04:42,394 --> 01:04:43,894
It's better if it's sudden.

906
01:04:44,554 --> 01:04:45,724
If possible...

907
01:04:46,794 --> 01:04:48,594
Like the day before I die?

908
01:04:51,394 --> 01:04:52,964
I just don't get it.

909
01:04:54,904 --> 01:04:57,974
If they have to watch their own child die,

910
01:04:59,804 --> 01:05:01,644
it's best their pain is as brief as possible.

911
01:05:08,384 --> 01:05:09,384
Dad.

912
01:05:19,594 --> 01:05:20,594
Father.

913
01:06:07,344 --> 01:06:09,814
(Our Golden Days)

914
01:06:10,044 --> 01:06:12,284
"Get my affairs in order?" How could I?

915
01:06:12,544 --> 01:06:15,244
Ji Hyuk is lying.

916
01:06:15,344 --> 01:06:18,284
Does that make any sense, you fool? Our eldest son is sick.

917
01:06:18,384 --> 01:06:20,824
Isn't an artificial heart an option?

918
01:06:21,024 --> 01:06:24,794
The only reason Seong Jae would cry is to ask for their blessing again,

919
01:06:24,894 --> 01:06:26,394
or if something's wrong with Dad.

920
01:06:26,464 --> 01:06:27,994
Could my dad be sick?

921
01:06:27,994 --> 01:06:29,894
How could you, after all I did to raise you?

922
01:06:29,964 --> 01:06:32,864
You get me 200,000 dollars. You're my daughter. Got it?

923
01:06:32,964 --> 01:06:37,134
That's your punishment for deceiving me for 26 years.

924
01:06:37,204 --> 01:06:40,044
Why should I? Why? You think I'll take this lying down?
