(Episode 32)

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,290
Since you get it, does that mean I don't have to do the transplant?

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:09,659
Oh, my. Eun Oh.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,800
I know you sought me out on purpose from the very beginning.

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:15,270
It was no coincidence. Everything, from the very beginning until now...

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,840
I know you planned it all, so...

7
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:20,810
don't bother making excuses. Just leave.

8
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:26,150
That son of yours...

9
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,350
is never getting my liver.

10
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,590
What are you talking about?

(National ID Card, Name: Ko Seong Hui)

12
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:50,900
You abandoned me.

13
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:00,910
How did you get this?

14
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,290
Don't lose all hope.

15
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:10,960
This recording is more than enough evidence.

16
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,790
You were recording that?

17
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,830
Just in case.

18
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:21,570
Excuse me.

19
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:28,010
My mom salvaged some things from the ashes.

20
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:29,740
She says they're in a box in the storage room.

21
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,750
Would you like to go through it?

22
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,080
Yes.

00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,020
(National ID Card, Name: Ko Seong Hui)

25
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,549
You deliberately approached me and got close to lower my guard.

26
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,990
For months, you deceived me.

27
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,390
I will never forgive you.

28
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:20,230
- Eun Oh, please, just hear me out. - How can you be so cruel?

29
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,430
How could you do something like that?

30
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,430
How could a mother...

31
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,200
make a fool of and deceive the daughter she abandoned?

32
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:30,470
You should've come and begged me. You should have just asked.

33
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,540
But I won't even go there.

34
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,780
What?

35
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,850
Even though you abandoned me,

36
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:46,090
you did something you'd never do if you saw me as your real daughter.

37
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,850
So why bother resenting you?

38
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,060
You'll just make excuses anyway.

39
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,200
The reason I won't do the liver transplant...

40
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:59,670
is because it's the worst punishment I can give you.

41
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,370
My liver seems to be the one thing you desperately need,

42
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,710
and you came to take it from me. That's why you can't have it.

43
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,240
Aren't you something.

44
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,510
You've said your piece.

45
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,850
So can I talk now?

46
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,820
- No. - I didn't abandon you.

47
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:23,020
So you found this and just assumed I abandoned you?

48
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:28,089
After your father died, I couldn't raise you both alone,

49
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,600
so I left you there temporarily.

50
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,069
I couldn't afford to take you both,

51
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,730
so I came back for your brother first.

52
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,270
When I went back for you,

53
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,610
the orphanage had burned down.

54
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:43,580
I tracked you down to the orphanage in Cheongju,

55
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,250
but you had been fully adopted and were gone.

56
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,120
If it had been a regular adoption, I would have tried to get you back.

57
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,330
But they said it was a full adoption.

58
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:00,930
And what's more?

59
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,400
By a very wealthy family with their own business.

60
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,730
They had accepted you as their own flesh and blood.

61
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,140
So I let you go.

62
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,370
It seemed you'd have a better life than I could provide.

63
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,340
I gritted my teeth and walked away.

64
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,120
After all that, how could I show up and ask for a suitability test?

65
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,550
How could I have the nerve?

66
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,690
The fact that I found this copy of your ID...

67
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,960
means I know everything. I heard it all!

68
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,590
Heard it all? What did you hear?

69
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,990
That I came back and only took your brother?

70
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:39,100
That was for his ear surgery. I told you. I went back for you!

71
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,100
I said you'd already been adopted.

72
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:45,040
Stop it. Please, just stop with the lies!

73
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,580
The reason I approached you without telling you who I was...

74
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,280
is because there was a good chance you wouldn't be a match.

75
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,510
And besides, I wanted to see you.

76
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,880
I wanted to see how my daughter had grown up.

77
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,320
But once I actually met you,

78
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:03,090
I just couldn't bring myself to ask you to get tested.

79
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:06,990
And while that was happening, as you know...

80
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,560
We found a donor, but they backed out.

81
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,000
I...

82
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,340
I wasn't going to tell you I was your mother, ever.

83
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,670
Because I knew it would hurt you.

84
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,110
I thought we could just be like close friends.

85
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,780
I hoped I could stay in your life like that forever.

86
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,320
But then, the donor fell through.

87
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,790
So I had no choice but to turn to you.

88
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,650
Why turn to me?

89
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,220
I thought you said you didn't know if I'd be a match.

90
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,890
No, that's a lie. You knew all along.

91
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:45,330
You had me take the suitability test under the guise of a health checkup.

92
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,230
No...

93
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,670
What are you talking about?

94
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:54,239
I went back to the hospital where we had our checkup...

95
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,440
and reviewed my records.

96
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:57,980
I...

97
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,850
had an MRI and an abdominal CT scan, but they said there were no records.

98
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,820
I wonder who could've been involved.

99
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,120
Hospital Director Yoon Seong Mo and you, Ms. Ko Seong Hui.

100
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:11,490
Turns out you're both members of the same volunteer group abroad.

101
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:14,930
How much does she know?

102
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,530
Should I file a formal complaint?

103
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:23,770
With the hospital,

104
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:26,210
and look into whether a donor really did back out.

105
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:32,510
No, why on earth...

106
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:36,120
Why would you even think something so horrible?

107
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:41,020
- You should've asked. I'll explain. - Oh, please.

108
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,330
Stop it. I said, stop! Are you even human?

109
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,340
Someone's life is on the line.

110
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,210
Here we go again.

111
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,380
Please, save your brother.

112
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:06,980
He's your older brother.

113
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,650
He's your son, not mine.

114
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,550
I'm not your daughter.

115
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,520
What older brother? I don't have one.

116
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,160
Ms. Ji, is your guest leaving now?

117
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Yes.

118
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,900
This way, ma'am.

119
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,170
Who are these people?

120
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,010
She seems more like an intruder than a visitor.

121
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,940
It's time for her to leave.

122
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,040
Please escort her to the exit.

123
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,250
Ma'am, please come with me.

124
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:01,970
This is a disaster.

125
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,400
But how?

126
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:07,140
What made her suspicious?

127
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:13,450
What? After you said you visited the orphanage she abandoned you at?

128
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,150
And even after you showed her the copy of her ID?

129
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,190
She gets caught red-handed and still makes excuses?

130
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,320
How could that woman be my mother?

131
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,740
You said I should change the sign and make this my office, Mr. Lee.

132
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,780
Wow, isn't this a bit too grand for someone who's been sidelined?

133
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,510
If someone as young as me were to occupy this symbolic office,

134
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,180
it would make me, the staff, and the executives uncomfortable.

135
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,420
Until I get a handle on the company and finish the first project,

136
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,820
I'll be working out of the think tank.

137
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:57,160
Besides, I can do approvals online, and we have video conferencing.

138
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,260
For the antechamber, I've gathered some ideas like this.

139
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,970
I can't really tell her not to work.

140
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,330
Something along these lines.

141
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,470
Come to my office.

142
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,080
You can take a look.

143
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,520
Yes.

144
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:34,690
What did she say?

145
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,430
I handled it.

146
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,930
Sounds like she got the message.

147
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,870
What about you? Are you okay?

148
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,150
If that's all, may I go now?

149
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,310
There's more I want to ask.

150
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,720
It's just that you...

151
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,580
look really exhausted.

152
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:01,050
I am.

153
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,060
(CEO's Office)

154
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:13,300
She's unbelievable.

155
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:17,140
Eun Oh's holding it together, though.

156
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:22,040
She's holding up for now, probably fueled by her anger and betrayal,

157
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:25,810
but I'm worried about the emotional fallout later.

158
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,650
Let's make sure we're there for her.

159
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,480
It'll probably take some time, though.

160
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:37,490
Since Eun Oh refused the transplant, I bet that woman is a total wreck.

161
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,240
I knew it smelled like November. That's snail extract, isn't it?

162
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:54,110
Honey, you're home early.

163
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,010
I'm home too.

164
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,780
I ran into Dad out front.

165
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,650
Go wash up.

166
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:03,519
It needs to simmer for ten more minutes.

167
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,380
It'll be perfect when you're done.

168
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,150
Okay, sounds good.

169
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,830
Why are you staring at me like that?

170
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:21,100
Because of the way you were looking at Mom.

171
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,610
- Hey, you know I love your mother. - I know.

172
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:27,940
I know, but...

173
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,180
why do you love her?

174
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,480
My gosh, Yeong Ra. What kind of question is that?

175
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,990
Because she's always been so consistent.

176
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:47,030
Even if she weren't like this, she'd still be a wonderful person.

177
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:50,130
But no one stays this constant for 26 years.

178
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,530
It's not easy for people to be like that.

179
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,400
I see.

180
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,870
You should learn from your mom and be just like her.

181
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:04,440
Do that, and a man will be devoted for life.

182
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,980
I'm not sure I can be like Mom, but...

183
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:12,290
- Okay, Dad. - All right.

184
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:18,360
She's so good to Dad. What is Mom up to?

185
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,530
I'm dying of curiosity.

186
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,800
You're not doing what?

187
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,200
You're not doing the liver transplant?

188
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,900
But why?

189
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,470
Because I think you were right, Mom.

190
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,310
I told her I'm not doing it.

191
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,280
You did?

192
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:43,780
And she just agreed to that? There's no way she would.

193
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,050
If I say no, it means no.

194
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:51,760
- Mom, the menu's out in two days. - What?

195
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,160
How are the preparations coming along?

196
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:55,160
Oh, right.

197
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:57,400
We're putting up the banner tomorrow.

198
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:02,100
We'll also update the kiosk, and Gang Oh will hand out flyers.

199
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:05,100
I need to prep the menu text too. Gosh, it's so hectic.

200
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,140
You should come check it out the evening after tomorrow.

201
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:10,040
What am I, a customer? Just coming to "check it out?"

202
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,280
I'll come by during your break.

203
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,280
Just because Eun Oh refused...

204
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,550
doesn't mean that woman will give up.

205
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:21,520
- Listen, Eun Oh. - Mom.

206
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,460
Mom, please just drop it. Okay?

207
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:27,990
All right.

208
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,200
I wonder what happened.

209
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,390
Tell them not to break down the door.

210
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,320
I'll leave once I'm done talking.

211
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:01,890
- Eun Oh! - Ms. Ji?

212
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:16,880
What company has so little respect for a team leader's privacy?

213
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:20,080
Are you surprised to see me again?

214
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,620
She's here to beg.

215
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,990
I'm not here to beg.

216
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,660
Is this the kind of person you are?

217
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,830
I couldn't sleep a wink last night.

218
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:41,930
How can you so cold-heartedly decide to let your own brother die?

219
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,769
If you didn't know, it's one thing,

220
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:46,170
but you know your twin brother needs a liver transplant.

221
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:48,270
I believe I made myself perfectly clear yesterday.

222
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,340
I don't have a twin brother.

223
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,850
You're the one who abandoned me.

224
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:55,450
And you made sure I could never be found.

225
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,220
You left no record of my ID number or my parents' names.

226
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,720
And after all that, you dare to act like we're family?

227
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:06,190
Then that makes you a murderer.

228
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:11,860
If your brother dies, you'll be a murderer.

229
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,570
So don't make this about me. Think about your brother.

230
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,270
Do you want your brother to die? It's me you want to hurt, isn't it?

231
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:23,010
Then why hurt your innocent brother and not me?

232
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:28,780
If you refuse this because of me, you'll be killing your brother.

233
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,920
That's not an easy thing to live with.

234
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,660
Will you be able to sleep at night after killing someone?

235
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:44,100
Don't do something you'll regret just because you're angry with me.

236
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:50,400
You've got it all backward. He wouldn't be dying because of me.

237
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:53,810
- He'd be dying because of you. - No, it's because of you!

238
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,040
Because it's your liver he needs.

239
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,380
Are you okay with your brother dying because of you?

240
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,350
Answer me.

241
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,820
If he dies,

242
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,320
it's because you're his mother. He's dying because of you.

243
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,530
So you're really not going to do it?

244
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:20,600
The surgery is in ten days.

245
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,270
If you don't do this for him,

246
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,100
your brother is going to die.

247
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:27,870
He is absolutely going to die.

248
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,280
If you're done talking, you can leave.

249
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,670
I guess it's time to tell them.

250
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:05,580
Are you really going to be like this?

251
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,510
Let's be rational about this, Eun Oh.

252
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:10,480
I have been thinking about it rationally.

253
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,490
Now, please leave.

254
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,190
I'm not leaving until you give me an answer.

255
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:18,260
If you were going to act like this, you shouldn't have gone so far.

256
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,090
Telling me we'd live together...

257
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:24,800
You shouldn't have told that lie about getting a divorce for me.

258
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,800
In your pajamas and barefoot.

259
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:31,970
For someone so meticulous, I wonder why you weren't prepared.

260
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,710
I didn't want to hurt you.

261
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:39,450
I just wanted to save your brother without hurting you. That's all.

262
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,450
If you had just begged me from the start, I would've done it.

263
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:49,820
What a shame for that son of yours.

264
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,190
Hey, Ji Eun Oh.

265
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,130
Ji Eun Oh!

266
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:59,730
Why is the door locked in the middle of work?

267
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,330
Shouldn't you be working?

268
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,100
Eun Oh.

269
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,250
Did you lock this door?

270
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,220
Get out, now. Before I throw you out myself.

271
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,500
She threatened me.

272
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,800
She even resorted to threats.

273
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,040
(Woo Jin)

274
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,550
Woo Jin.

275
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:48,850
Ji Eun Oh.

276
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,220
Hey, why did you call me on this?

277
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,120
To save on the international calling fees.

278
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:01,390
How have you been?

279
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:03,300
What?

280
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,830
Eun Oh, what's wrong? Your voice...

281
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,600
Wait. Something's wrong, isn't it?

282
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,740
Woo Jin.

283
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,740
Woo Jin...

284
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,180
The truth is...

285
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,110
I was adopted.

286
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,020
What did you say?

287
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,950
I met my birth mother.

288
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:32,290
But she was just pretending to be a client to get to me.

289
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,390
Woo Jin, apparently, I'm a twin.

290
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,030
And because my twin brother needs a liver transplant...

291
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,640
That's why she came to me.

292
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:44,700
A liver transplant?

293
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,270
We "just happened" to meet, and she "just happened" to hire me.

294
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,940
For months, she was so incredibly nice to me,

295
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,080
and I really grew to like her.

296
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:58,080
I really liked her.

297
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,690
But all of it...

298
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:06,690
It was all a ploy to soften me up and have me test for the transplant.

299
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,730
Wait, you're a twin?

300
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:18,970
Thinking about every single moment she was lying still drives me crazy.

301
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,040
So manipulative and deceitful.

302
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,410
And that's the woman who's supposed to be my mother.

303
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,520
The woman who only wanted to take my liver...

304
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,120
is the one who gave birth to me.

305
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,260
- And so I... - I'm so sorry, Eun Oh.

306
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:43,100
I just stepped out of class for a second.

307
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,000
Don't cry, okay? I'll call you right back.

308
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,530
Don't cry, all right?

309
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:55,070
Han Woo Jin, what was that about?

310
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,080
It can't be...

311
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:12,990
(Team Leader's Office)

312
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:34,480
Gosh, you have all this long hair, and you can't even style the back?

313
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:37,880
My little sister does it in a flash. Her hands are a blur.

314
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,120
The only thing I've ever used on my hair is a blow-dryer.

315
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,120
- I get this done at a salon. - A salon?

316
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:46,760
Right. You're a third-generation heiress.

317
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,630
It slipped my mind.

318
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,130
All done?

319
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,990
Yeong Ra, you look really...

320
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:26,930
I mean, you look like a real writer.

321
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:31,070
(Director Ko)

322
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:36,040
Hey, Director Ko is on the move. From Pyeongja-dong, heading north.

323
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,240
That's toward the hospital.

324
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,650
Let's go. Quick.

325
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,320
Got the gear?

326
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:55,390
(Cheong Ah University Hospital, Lee Ji Soo, Kim Jae Yeong)

327
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,060
We agreed to start on the top floor and work our way down, right?

328
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:02,200
That way, we can check everywhere without missing anything.

329
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,470
A liver for you...

330
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:35,500
I've secured one.

331
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,200
What?

332
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:42,410
How? I'm still way down the list.

333
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:43,740
You don't need to know how.

334
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,450
You should be resting. Why are you up and about?

335
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,830
You didn't say you were coming to the hospital.

336
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:02,530
Did something happen?

337
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:05,660
No. I just felt like I had to see you.

338
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:08,730
Well...

339
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:12,440
How did you find a donor for my surgery?

340
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:16,040
I told you. You don't need to know that.

341
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,280
All you need to know is it wasn't easy.

342
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:23,420
That donor you had such a hard time finding...

343
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,050
Is her name Ji Eun Oh, by any chance?

344
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,160
What are you talking about?

345
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,370
So, it's true.

346
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:46,240
The liver is from the very person you abandoned so cruelly?

347
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:48,140
From my little sister?

348
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,310
What?

349
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:53,510
That's confidential information. Who told you?

350
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,310
- Who blabbed? - Mom!

351
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,150
You tell me how you found out first!

352
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,590
No, you tell me first.

353
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:06,660
You told me she was dead.

You told me Yu Ra was dead!

355
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:13,000
And now, after all this time, you found her?

356
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,530
Did you trick her again?

357
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:20,270
How could you?

358
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,440
Where does it end with you, Mom?

359
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,350
And you...

360
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:30,180
You never forgot about her? Even after I told you she was dead?

361
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:33,750
How could I forget?

362
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:39,160
I left Yu Ra there all alone and just followed you.

363
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,330
Let's go.

364
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,590
Yu Ra.

365
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:44,900
Brother!

366
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:49,400
- Yu Ra! - Mom!

367
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:51,900
Yu Ra!

368
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,810
You remembered that?

369
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,210
You never said a word to me about it.

370
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:02,910
Because you told me never to bring it up again.

371
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:05,950
Because I knew what would happen if I did.

372
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,520
To think you remembered something so useless.

373
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,170
I'm not getting the liver transplant.

374
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:28,510
No one sane throws their life away when there's a chance to live.

375
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:31,580
- People die when they lose hope. - No.

376
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:35,180
I won't take Yu Ra's liver.

377
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:43,520
That is not your decision to make.

378
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,440
Excuse me, doctors. What floor?

379
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,980
Hello? Doctors?

380
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,610
You haven't selected a floor.

381
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,780
- Dr. Lee. - Yes?

382
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,150
Why didn't you press the button?

383
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,290
I thought you pressed it.

384
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:00,070
Hey, these are all private rooms.

385
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,700
So, Mom's boyfriend is in a private room?

386
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:05,670
We're looking for a guy in his 50s, right?

387
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,140
No.

388
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:10,080
My mom's pretty. She could have a younger boyfriend.

389
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,480
All right, down to early 40s, then.

390
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:18,180
Okay, skip this one. It's an old man.

391
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:29,530
I wonder who put this up.

392
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:32,200
She's gone.

393
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,430
Check the room next door, too.

394
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:35,900
Okay.

395
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,100
Hey, no. This guy's in his 20s.

396
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:41,010
Definitely not a guy in his 20s.

397
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,140
What?

398
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,610
Han Woo Jin?

399
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,410
What? What's wrong?

400
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:50,220
He has the same name as my brother.

401
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,420
(Han Woo Jin, M)

402
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,930
It's my brother... Woo Jin.

403
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,170
It's really him. My second-oldest brother.

404
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,600
Your second-oldest brother?

405
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,470
I thought you said he was studying in the US.

406
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,040
Yes.

407
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,210
Why is he in the hospital?

408
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:23,280
- Because he's sick, obviously. - With what?

409
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,820
And why would my mom try to hide this?

410
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:30,590
Hey, let's just ask the nurse.

411
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:34,859
Hey. We're in disguise, remember?

412
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:38,029
Look, residents rotate every month,

413
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:39,760
so the nurses may not know all of them.

414
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,240
- Really? - Yes.

415
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:51,310
Hi, I just need to confirm the professor's orders.

416
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:53,750
Could I get the chart for Han Woo Jin, please?

417
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:57,350
- The patient, Han Woo Jin? - Yes.

418
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,490
Nurse Im!

419
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,060
Did you change your cushion foundation?

420
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:08,560
Your makeup looks amazing today.

421
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,160
Really?

422
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,870
If you tried an orange lip tint, it'd look even better.

423
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:18,440
- I've never tried an orange shade. - Really?

424
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,740
I actually have a cool undertone.

425
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,570
You really look amazing, but could we please see the chart?

426
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:25,910
Right. When I had my colors done, they said my lips were too blue,

427
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,480
so they actually did tell me to wear orange.

428
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:30,920
So what cushion did you switch to? Your skin looks incredible.

429
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:35,520
- But your skin is even better. - Gosh, stop.

430
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:37,820
(Han Woo Jin, end-stage liver disease)

431
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:38,890
(Planned for liver transplant)

432
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:45,660
Thanks so much!

433
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,530
I wasn't done reading that.

434
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:48,930
Sorry, we're busy. We have to get going.

435
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:50,799
Hey, what was that about?

436
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,770
It was all in English. I'd only just started memorizing it.

437
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,810
He needs a liver transplant.

438
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,440
A liver transplant?

439
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:04,180
So that's what's going on.

440
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:10,220
But still, why would his illness be a weakness?

441
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,590
- Does your father hate Woo Jin? - No, that's not it.

442
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:17,130
This is just...

443
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,930
all part of my mom's plan.

444
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,230
Living in your father's shadow isn't enough.

445
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,499
You need to have your own accomplishments.

446
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,770
That's how you reach a higher level in this world.

447
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:33,040
That's why I'm pushing you up there, no matter what it takes.

448
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,850
This world is all about social class,

449
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:39,750
and because of that, we get looked down on.

450
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:43,190
Yeong Ra.

451
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:45,990
Ji Wan.

452
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,930
I'm suddenly not so sure anymore.

453
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,700
I'm not sure I can defy my mom.

454
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:58,170
My mom will never give up on me.

455
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:17,620
What kind of mother does that?

456
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,130
My mom would never do that.

457
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:23,660
Neither would my dad, my grandma, my brother, or Su Bin.

458
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,400
Park Yeong Ra.

459
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,030
What kind of world did you grow up in?

460
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:30,470
You poor thing.

461
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:44,180
It smells so warm in here.

462
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,220
So cozy. This is home.

463
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:54,630
Why is Ji Wan just standing there like that?

464
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:00,700
- Hey. Hush! - Grandma.

465
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,440
Come on.

466
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,000
Why?

467
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,680
Hurry up and spit it out.

468
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:19,820
You're in money trouble, aren't you? How much? Is it bad?

469
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:21,650
No, Grandma.

470
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:25,420
You could've just gone to your room. Why were you standing there...

471
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:29,290
like you'd seen a ghost, staring at your parents' room?

472
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:31,030
No, it's just that...

473
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,830
It's just hard to explain.

474
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:38,170
Listen.

475
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,840
I...

476
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,310
I can give you a thousand dollars.

477
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:44,080
That's my entire life savings.

478
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:46,580
I told you. It's not about money.

479
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:50,380
But Grandma, how do you have a thousand dollars?

480
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,850
I saved it up, little by little.

481
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,760
Why? Is that not enough?

482
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:59,190
How much do you need?

483
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:01,460
That's her entire life savings,

484
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,260
and she'd give it all to me?

485
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,500
Grandma...

486
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,730
Goodness, hey. What's gotten into you?

487
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:12,670
I'm just so glad I was born into this family,

488
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,610
and I'm so grateful for you, Grandma.

489
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,180
For goodness' sake.

490
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,410
What's all this nonsense out of the blue?

491
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:23,950
Listen, Ji Wan.

492
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:28,350
Are you absolutely sure nothing's wrong?

493
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:31,820
Yes, I'm sure. Nothing's wrong. I promise, Grandma.

494
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,060
And...

495
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:36,130
thank you.

496
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,370
Grandma, you're a natural for a beginner!

497
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,650
Grandma, why don't you take a short break?

498
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,080
Are you home?

499
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,850
Let's get something good to eat after I get off work.

500
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:03,820
I'll pick you up when I'm done, so stay home.

501
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:08,730
Don't come here.

502
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:10,800
Text me the location, and I'll meet you there.

503
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:14,030
What if someone sees you in my neighborhood?

504
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,900
If anyone asks, I'll just say I came to see Ji Hyuk.

505
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:22,010
You said Ji Hyuk can't find out. Funny how he's your best alibi now.

506
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,180
Let me take another one.

507
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,680
When Woo Jin suddenly came home the other day,

508
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,690
was he trying to tell us something?

509
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:38,490
Yeong Ra.

510
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:40,690
No matter how much I think about it,

511
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:44,630
I really think you should be the one to tell Chairman Park.

512
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:48,070
I can't tell Dad.

513
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:52,470
But didn't you say your mom's always on eggshells around your dad?

514
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,410
Exactly. That's why I can't tell him.

515
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:57,040
My mom hid it. You want me to go tattle on her to my dad?

516
00:35:57,610 --> 00:35:59,510
How am I supposed to deal with the fallout from that?

517
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,180
Well, then...

518
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,350
You should at least go visit him.

519
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:06,780
Look, there's nothing worse than being sick and all alone.

520
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:12,090
- What if I go and Mom finds out? - Wear a disguise again.

521
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,960
Don't you feel bad for your brother at all?

522
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:17,060
I do. I feel awful.

523
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:19,600
But what if I'm there in disguise and my mom shows up?

524
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:20,930
You think I wouldn't get caught?

525
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:25,640
It's easy for you to talk since it's not your problem.

526
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:30,440
That's not it. I'm not trying to be dismissive.

527
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:33,879
It's just... Ignorance is one thing.

528
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,380
But to know and just ignore him...

529
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:39,150
Come on, that's just wrong.

530
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,690
Don't judge my situation by your standards.

531
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:45,260
They say there are things in the world that defy normal logic.

532
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,930
Who said that? Your mom?

533
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:54,930
What did I just say?

534
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:01,310
I don't remember.

535
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:05,880
You've already got so much on your mind,

536
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:08,810
and I was just pushing my own opinion on you,

537
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,080
Yeong Ra.

538
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,720
Why don't you lie down on the sofa and rest?

539
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,790
I'm going to go do my rounds.

540
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,340
I'm sorry.

541
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:33,270
It's okay.

542
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:34,840
Call me if you need anything.

- Hi, welcome. How many? - We're meeting someone.

545
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,120
- Right this way. - Hello. Welcome.

546
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:49,519
- Hi, how many in your party? - Three of us.

547
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,619
We'll clear a table and seat you shortly.

548
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,660
- Sure. - Please wait just a moment.

549
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,160
Unbelievable.

550
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:55,360
Living in some cheap rental...

551
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:58,659
And he's working at the restaurant she busted her back to open...

552
00:37:58,660 --> 00:37:59,660
for the family?

554
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:04,740
Here's the new meat dish you ordered.

555
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,870
So, what do you think? Are you enjoying it?

556
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:14,850
- It looks amazing and just melts. - Really?

557
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,580
Thank you. Enjoy your meal.

558
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:24,590
What? You're home already?

559
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:27,260
Hold on. I'll get dinner ready for you right away.

560
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:29,190
No, that's okay. I'm not eating dinner at home.

561
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:30,560
I actually have to head out now.

562
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,970
Why the black suit? Are you going to a funeral?

563
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:37,940
Byeong Ho passed away.

564
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,800
Byeong Ho?

565
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:42,010
Your friend, Byeong Ho, in Mexico?

566
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,110
The one who was great at guitar and singing?

567
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:48,810
Yes. We're holding a small memorial for him at Yeong Bo's restaurant.

568
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,750
My gosh, what happened? He was so healthy.

569
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:54,350
Car accident.

570
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:55,950
Oh, my gosh.

571
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:58,020
But didn't he say he'd come back next year?

572
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:02,790
He kept saying he was coming back for the past couple of years,

573
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:06,060
but there was always something else. Factory machines, delivery issues...

574
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,800
He promised he'd be here for sure on March 5 next year.

575
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:12,270
He even sent a picture of his plane ticket reservation.

576
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,210
That fool...

577
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:20,310
Honey. You must be so heartbroken.

578
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:23,880
Life just feels so pointless.

579
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,120
I'll be back later.

580
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,390
Can you believe we're all over 60,

581
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:36,190
and this is the only picture we have of the five of us?

582
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:39,130
Tell me about it.

583
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:42,370
That darn Byeong Ho...

584
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:45,400
Was he 35 when he moved to Mexico?

585
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,970
We only saw him three times since, didn't we?

586
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:50,740
Once was at my father's funeral.

587
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:53,980
He went halfway across the world to make a living.

588
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,850
His funeral must feel so lonely.

589
00:39:58,050 --> 00:40:00,990
Poor Byeong Ho must be heartbroken and lonely in his casket.

590
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:03,490
The dead don't feel a thing. He's fine.

591
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,190
It's harder on those of us left behind.

592
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,530
That fool...

593
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:09,730
I always felt so sorry for him.

594
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,160
Man, back in college,

595
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:15,600
the five of us were thick as thieves.

596
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,710
Hey, how about a song?

597
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:24,410
Byeong Ho left this when he moved, remember?

598
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,209
He wanted us to get together and sing often.

599
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:27,710
- Hey, Sang Cheol. - Yes?

600
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:32,680
I haven't touched one in 30 years. Think I can still do it? My gosh.

601
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:38,220
- I call out to the yonder sky - I call out to the yonder sky

602
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:40,220
One, two, three, four!

603
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:44,199
- Fly high into the sky - Fly high into the sky

604
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:48,000
- Let my heart soar too - Let my heart soar too

605
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:52,940
- Soar with my beautiful dreams - Soar with my beautiful dreams

606
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:06,750
I can start contributing to the household expenses.

607
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:13,720
I'm the head of this household. I'm the head of this family.

608
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:17,700
How dare you sneak in here uninvited and act like you own the place?

609
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:19,860
When I'm still alive and kicking!

610
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:22,470
My goodness...

611
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:24,270
Have a good day!

612
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:30,270
I'm home.

613
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:34,610
Oh, my! Look who's home. Our very own CEO!

614
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:37,450
Yes, Grandma. Your CEO is home.

615
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:38,950
Ji Hyuk, you must be exhausted.

616
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,490
How in the world do you run a company?

617
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:44,190
Ji Hyuk, have you eaten dinner yet?

618
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:46,360
- I already ate. - I see.

619
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:48,360
Then have some fruit. I'll bring some up for you.

620
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:50,030
What kind of fruit?

621
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,200
I got it at the market for Ji Hyuk, the rock of our family.

622
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:57,670
No, I'm fine. You and Grandma can go ahead and have it.

623
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:00,710
- I'm heading up. - Okay.

624
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:11,880
Why are you watching him go upstairs too?

625
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,120
Like he's some kind of king.

626
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,520
You know, I find I can't treat him the way I used to, either.

627
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:18,320
Is it because he's so successful now?

628
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,100
Oh, come in.

629
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:37,880
Here, have some of this.

630
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:41,150
I noticed you stayed up past 1am after getting home last night.

631
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,380
Thanks, Mom.

632
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:47,290
Are you working on something urgent?

633
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:49,550
Not really. Why do you ask?

634
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:52,820
This will only take five minutes.

635
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:56,790
Why? Is there some kind of family emergency?

636
00:42:57,630 --> 00:42:58,630
No.

637
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,800
Ji Hyuk, how about you get your own place?

638
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,100
Somewhere near your office.

639
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:06,370
Get my own place?

640
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:11,240
You sleep at the office so often. Isn't your commute exhausting?

641
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:16,350
You can afford a studio near work, can't you? You're the CEO.

642
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,350
That's not the point.

643
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:21,350
Mom, why are you suddenly kicking me out?

644
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:26,390
I hate seeing your father walk on eggshells around you.

645
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,590
You think Dad walks on eggshells around me?

646
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:31,160
No, Mom.

647
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,130
He's just sulking because he disapproves of me.

648
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,100
Right.

649
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,940
As if a child could ever understand their parents.

650
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,940
That's part of it, but...

651
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:44,840
Now that I'm working, it's too much to take care of everyone at home.

652
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:47,210
And ever since you became the CEO,

653
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:50,720
you've been making me nervous. It's hard to be around you.

654
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,490
Mom.

655
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:56,250
Gosh, I don't know.

656
00:43:56,850 --> 00:43:59,220
I know it sounds petty, but I can't help it.

657
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:02,560
So, let's just make life easier for everyone.

658
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:05,130
Honestly, it's time for you to move out.

659
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,240
Okay. I'll start looking for a place.

660
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,310
Here's the beer you ordered.

661
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:20,180
- Why so long? Did you make it? - I'm sorry.

662
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:23,780
And we asked for more of this side dish.

663
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,420
Oh, I must not have heard you earlier.

664
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:28,590
- I'll get that for you. - Hey.

665
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:29,750
Yes?

666
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:33,190
You're supposed to say, "I'm sorry" first.

667
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:36,190
But earlier, you only asked for two beers.

668
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:40,500
We all heard him ask for more side dishes,

669
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,930
and you're the only one who didn't. Are you trying to argue?

670
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:47,269
- Okay, I'll get it. - I told you to apologize!

671
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:48,410
Hey, come on!

672
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:50,470
Just leave it. Let him be.

673
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:52,640
He's going to be waiting tables his whole life anyway.

674
00:44:56,410 --> 00:44:59,480
I'm not just waiting tables here. I'm the owner's son.

675
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:04,990
So what, does that make you the owner? I'm so jealous.

676
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:07,490
You've got no prospects and no skills,

677
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:10,230
but at least you're lucky your folks let you wait tables here.

678
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:15,130
Gang Oh, what are you doing? The additional meat order is up.

679
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:17,940
Unbelievable.

680
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:21,110
Gang Oh, check the charcoal grill. Something seems off.

681
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:22,710
And has the meat for table two gone out yet?

682
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:23,770
It needs to go out right away.

683
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:26,910
Why does everyone keep ordering me around?

684
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,250
Ji Gang Oh!

685
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:31,550
Hey! Where's that side dish?

686
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:55,110
- Mom. You worked so hard today. - Yes.

687
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:58,080
Mom, the new menu's a smash hit. The response was amazing.

688
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,410
It's completely different from just cooking it for you kids.

689
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:05,980
When customers say it's delicious, it makes me so proud, you know?

690
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:07,520
- Really? - Of course.

691
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:09,650
- It was a great idea, wasn't it? - Yes.

692
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:14,690
Oh, my goodness. Eun Oh, look at your dark circles.

693
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:17,530
- You go on home ahead of me. - No, I'll go home with you.

694
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,900
Come on, not much left to clean. Plus, you have work tomorrow.

695
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:23,729
Mom, your eyes are bloodshot too.

696
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:25,140
- What? - You must be exhausted from today.

697
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,510
Gang Oh. Listen, for tonight,

698
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:34,350
your sister and I will head home a little early.

699
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,350
Could you finish closing up here?

700
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:39,880
Sure. Don't worry, I got it.

701
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:43,690
- We appreciate it, Ji Gang Oh. - Thanks, honey.

702
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:45,120
- Mom, go get changed. - Okay.

00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:05,980
And I get no appreciation for all my hard work.

705
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,850
Getting disrespected by customers... Darn it.

706
00:47:09,810 --> 00:47:10,920
And I'm the one who worked the hardest.

707
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:29,370
I'm your sister's mother.

708
00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:31,340
Her birth mother.

709
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:33,340
What?

710
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:37,940
Hey, where are you going?

711
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:39,810
So, what's this about?

712
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:42,350
Let's sit down and talk.

713
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:45,050
Please, sit.

714
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:48,720
I don't see why I should have to. Darn it.

715
00:47:54,690 --> 00:47:56,030
I'm sure your sister told you.

716
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,500
And you must be very angry with me.

717
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:00,730
Just get to the point, please.

718
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:08,210
Giving someone a piece of your liver is no small thing.

719
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:09,910
It's scary, too.

720
00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:11,880
So what's your point?

721
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:14,650
Your sister...

722
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:17,550
Could you convince her?

723
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:23,450
It's 500,000 dollars.

724
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:26,020
What?

725
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:31,830
Now that the surgery date is getting closer,

726
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:34,400
I think your sister is getting cold feet.

727
00:48:35,730 --> 00:48:38,070
I'll give you another 500,000 when the surgery is over.

728
00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:47,010
To you, Gang Oh,

729
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:49,280
I must seem terribly shameless, right?

730
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:54,950
Well, yes, kind of.

731
00:48:57,890 --> 00:49:01,930
But your sister and my son... They're twins.

732
00:49:03,990 --> 00:49:07,100
So what was I supposed to do?

733
00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:09,970
When I had to weigh the guilt I feel for my daughter...

734
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:13,300
against the life of my dying son,

735
00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:18,840
what kind of mother was I supposed to be?

736
00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:22,810
Why are you asking me that?

737
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:29,050
Your sister won't forgive herself if her own flesh and blood dies.

738
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:33,620
Don't mention we met.

739
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:37,390
Just tell her this liver transplant is about saving a life.

740
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:40,560
That's all you need to say to your sister.

741
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:43,670
You're offering a million dollars just to say something to her?

742
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:47,069
I meant to give it to your mother...

743
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:48,710
to thank her for raising my daughter.

744
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:53,610
I'm too embarrassed to give it to her, so I'm giving it to you.

745
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:02,120
You'll get the rest when the surgery is over.

746
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:08,290
Wait, this...

747
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:29,680
She's right. There's a price for raising someone.

748
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:31,520
What should I do with all this?

749
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:34,890
That's right. First, we'll get a three-bedroom apartment.

750
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:37,720
Eun Oh needs her own room. How long can she share with Mom?

751
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:40,560
But, man, that woman is so naive.

752
00:50:41,790 --> 00:50:44,090
She doesn't know our Ji Eun Oh at all.

753
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:48,200
My sister might be hesitating, but there's no way she'd back out.

754
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:51,800
She doesn't know her own daughter because she didn't raise her.

755
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:55,240
Ji Eun Oh is Mom's daughter.

756
00:50:56,810 --> 00:50:58,810
(Vice President Park Seong Jae)

757
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:08,550
Seong Jae, I'm in the lobby.

758
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:10,220
Can you come down and get me?

759
00:51:10,890 --> 00:51:11,890
The lobby?

760
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:19,100
(Shoealls)

761
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,100
I told you to stop doing this.

762
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:24,700
- Why did you bring me food again? - I didn't make it.

763
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,310
My mom made spicy stir-fried octopus and beef for dinner,

764
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,140
and it was so good,

765
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:31,910
I snuck some for you.

766
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:35,650
I remembered how much you seemed to enjoy it last time.

767
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:44,090
That... You remembered that?

768
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:47,420
I guess so. I think I started liking you then.

769
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,630
My goodness.

770
00:51:55,170 --> 00:51:57,170
- Hurry and eat. - Okay.

771
00:51:57,270 --> 00:51:58,270
I'm heading out.

772
00:52:01,810 --> 00:52:02,970
Stay while I eat.

773
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:06,910
I don't want to eat alone.

774
00:52:21,190 --> 00:52:25,100
There's no point in going there if you just drive me back.

775
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:27,900
But what am I supposed to do?

776
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:29,870
I can't let you go home by yourself.

777
00:52:41,210 --> 00:52:42,680
I didn't know I'd be like this.

778
00:52:49,390 --> 00:52:50,390
I'm leaving now.

779
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,720
I'll walk you to the corner.

780
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:41,770
Su Bin.

781
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,750
Kim Seok. What are you doing here?

782
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:57,290
- Who's that? - A guy I dated in college.

783
00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:00,460
My ex, actually.

784
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:02,289
He found my YouTube and wouldn't stop calling,

785
00:54:02,290 --> 00:54:04,460
so I blocked him. I guess he borrowed someone's phone.

786
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:07,860
So, he's that punk.

787
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:11,130
Are you Su Bin's oldest brother?

788
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:12,940
I've heard so much about you.

789
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:15,770
No, he's not. He's my boyfriend.

790
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:17,140
Boyfriend?

791
00:54:21,950 --> 00:54:22,950
Hey, Lee Su Bin.

792
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:25,080
Why are you going out with some old man?

793
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:28,790
"Old man?"

794
00:54:30,890 --> 00:54:32,420
Oh, so you're rich.

795
00:54:34,190 --> 00:54:36,290
- Is that why you're with him? - You little...

796
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:38,700
Are you crazy?

797
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:41,500
- Hey. - Who are you to say that?

798
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:44,400
- Do you ever look in the mirror? - There's a huge age gap.

799
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:47,100
Hey, you. What is your problem?

800
00:54:47,470 --> 00:54:50,110
When someone says no, it means no. Why do you keep hanging around?

801
00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:53,910
And you've been calling her from unknown numbers, haven't you?

802
00:54:54,610 --> 00:54:56,180
And now, you're showing up at her home?

803
00:54:56,650 --> 00:54:58,420
This is stalking!

804
00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:00,450
Unbelievable.

805
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:03,850
All right, that's it.

806
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:06,790
You're coming with me to the police station. Let's go.

807
00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:09,430
- Okay, fine. - Let's go.

808
00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:10,830
Okay! I'll stay away.

809
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:15,370
- But I thought Su Bin was single... - Well, she isn't anymore!

810
00:55:16,370 --> 00:55:18,440
Lee Su Bin. What do you want me to do?

811
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:22,910
Just let him go.

812
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:30,080
You. Apologize to her. Apologize for harassing her.

813
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:35,650
- I'm sorry for harassing you. - And promise you won't contact her.

814
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:38,160
I'll never contact you again.

815
00:55:43,390 --> 00:55:45,360
Like you said, this old guy has a lot of money.

816
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:47,830
If I see you bothering her one more time,

817
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:50,230
I'll make your life very difficult. Got it?

818
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:52,900
- Yes. - Louder!

819
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,210
- Yes! - Now, leave.

820
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:00,840
Stop.

821
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:02,910
Aren't you going to say goodbye to her?

822
00:56:08,850 --> 00:56:09,850
What?

823
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:20,760
Hey.

824
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:23,370
When did you get so cool?

825
00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:29,510
Isn't that why you fell for me?

826
00:56:30,070 --> 00:56:31,070
No.

827
00:56:31,710 --> 00:56:33,110
Then why did you?

828
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:34,480
Because you're an old man?

829
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:36,180
What?

830
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:38,750
What?

831
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:41,550
I'll tell you why later. My mom will be worried.

832
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:43,650
Bye. Drive safe.

833
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:46,590
Wait, hey...

834
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:54,260
I'm so worried, it's driving me crazy.

835
00:56:55,930 --> 00:56:57,170
She's just too pretty.

836
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:13,120
Is it because of my clothes?

837
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:15,750
Yes, that's it.

838
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:18,860
It's the clothes. The clothes are the problem.

839
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:36,040
My clothes are all too classy.

840
00:57:41,110 --> 00:57:43,050
I wonder if Woo Jin left any of his clothes here.

841
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:47,680
Come to think of it,

842
00:57:48,050 --> 00:57:49,850
I haven't talked to Woo Jin at all lately.

843
00:57:54,190 --> 00:57:56,090
I just don't understand you at all.

844
00:57:56,430 --> 00:58:00,060
We're lucky your fever went down. Why climb the hospital roof so late?

845
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:03,800
What? Was it easy to go up but too hard to jump?

846
00:58:04,270 --> 00:58:05,540
You couldn't take that final step, could you?

847
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,670
That's what it means to be human. That's what life is.

848
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,710
Life is something you only get once. When it's gone, it's all gone.

849
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:20,780
For months, she was so incredibly nice to me,

850
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:22,890
and I really grew to like her.

851
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:25,490
I really liked her.

852
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:28,990
Pull yourself together. You need to focus on staying alive.

853
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:32,000
Unless you actually want to die, you'd better take care of yourself.

854
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:37,900
And what if I do?

855
00:58:40,770 --> 00:58:42,540
Don't you remember what I told you?

856
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:45,380
I told you. You don't get to die.

857
00:58:46,810 --> 00:58:48,710
Who gave you permission to die?

858
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:54,850
How dare she refuse to donate her liver?

859
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:07,500
Why is everyone so weak?

860
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,670
They can't even stick it out to the end.

861
00:59:16,670 --> 00:59:18,240
What's this warning light for?

862
00:59:22,650 --> 00:59:23,850
It's the transmission warning light.

863
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:26,080
Let me check the oil line underneath.

864
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:35,260
You're saying this is a tracking device?

865
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:37,990
Yes. It was attached near the rear wheel.

866
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:48,300
So Ri likes Dokgo Chan too, you know.

867
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:51,340
So who's supposed to make the first move?

868
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:56,880
They're pulled together and will kiss at the same time.

869
00:59:57,750 --> 01:00:00,480
So that's how it works?

870
01:00:00,550 --> 01:00:02,620
(Take My Heart)

871
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:05,820
But still,

872
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:09,360
shouldn't Dokgo Chan be the one to cup the back of her head first?

873
01:00:10,590 --> 01:00:11,590
Like this?

874
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:16,630
No. Hey, who kisses like that?

875
01:00:16,730 --> 01:00:18,600
Hey, you need to set the mood.

876
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:20,870
How?

877
01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:24,910
Watch me, Yeong Ra.

878
01:00:28,550 --> 01:00:31,850
First, you gaze deeply into each other's eyes.

879
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:38,220
Then you both lean in at the same time.

880
01:00:41,490 --> 01:00:42,490
Like this?

881
01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:46,800
And right about now, you cup her head...

882
01:01:04,650 --> 01:01:05,820
What do you two think you're doing?

883
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:11,690
You! Get out.

884
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:15,390
- Let me just explain... - Didn't you hear me? Get out!

885
01:01:24,330 --> 01:01:25,770
I'm not leaving...

886
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:27,740
Yeong Ra here alone.

887
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:29,840
What did you just say?

888
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:34,510
Go wait outside.

889
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:36,280
No, I mean,

890
01:01:37,010 --> 01:01:38,180
please just wait outside.

891
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:42,920
All right.

892
01:02:01,970 --> 01:02:04,970
I knew you were up to something when you played innocent for your dad.

893
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:09,780
So this is what it was all about.

894
01:02:10,510 --> 01:02:12,220
He's the jerk who's been filling your head with nonsense.

895
01:02:12,850 --> 01:02:13,920
What do I do?

896
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:16,750
What am I going to do?

897
01:02:18,290 --> 01:02:21,520
So he's the reason you refused to be physically intimate.

898
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:24,930
And you had the nerve to pull that act for your father?

899
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:29,100
Your father will be thrilled when he finds out, won't he?

900
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:33,700
He's fired. Effective immediately.

901
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:36,440
You can't do that, Mom.

902
01:02:37,710 --> 01:02:38,710
What?

903
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:42,480
If you do that, then I...

904
01:02:43,580 --> 01:02:45,320
have something I need to tell Dad.

905
01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:49,750
About Woo Jin.

906
01:02:55,690 --> 01:02:56,690
What about Woo Jin?

907
01:02:59,130 --> 01:03:01,000
The fact that Woo Jin is trying to get a liver transplant.

908
01:03:02,830 --> 01:03:04,130
Should I go ahead and tell Dad about that?

909
01:03:46,610 --> 01:03:49,010
(Our Golden Days)

910
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:53,480
This is the first money I've earned all by myself. I made my own money!

911
01:03:53,650 --> 01:03:56,620
You want me to model in a fashion show?

912
01:03:56,790 --> 01:03:59,620
You shouldn't try to haggle with the designated driver.

913
01:03:59,690 --> 01:04:00,790
Come on.

914
01:04:02,660 --> 01:04:06,700
Wait, so you took the money? Are you out of your mind?

915
01:04:06,830 --> 01:04:08,600
Let's keep it a secret from your sister.

916
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:11,030
I'm hiding your liver transplant, and she dares to use it against me?

917
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:12,940
If Chairman Park Jin Seok finds out I have a secret daughter,

918
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,570
- what do you think he'd do to me? - Since you're going to die anyway,

919
01:04:15,910 --> 01:04:18,880
stop playing games with your life when you don't have the guts for it.
