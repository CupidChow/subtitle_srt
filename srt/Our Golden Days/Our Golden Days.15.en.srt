1
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:02,770
I have some conditions.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:04,180
Three, to be exact.

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:06,580
If you accept my conditions...

4
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,750
and we get them notarized,
then we have a deal.

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,580
Notarized?

6
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:13,990
First.

7
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:16,990
The partnership will be a trial
of three months.

8
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,460
Second.

9
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,460
If the partnership dissolves
after three months,

10
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,100
Mamdaerozip will get its own office
and move out.

11
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:25,700
Third.

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,570
Our relationship will be
strictly professional.

13
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,300
If you can agree
to those three conditions,

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,340
I will partner with you.

15
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,040
What do you mean
by "strictly professional?"

16
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,780
You'll be CEO Lee,
and I'll be Manager Ji.

17
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,300
Do you need...

18
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,300
some time to think about it?

19
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,800
And "if the partnership dissolves?"

20
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,410
Because our feelings could change
at any time.

21
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:09,870
Both of us.

22
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,450
So that's how you want to do this.

23
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,150
With your three conditions.

24
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:20,750
Yes.

25
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,290
And what about
the partnership terms I proposed?

26
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,960
About that...

27
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:29,390
Let's discuss it
after this is notarized.

28
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,160
So you want to
get this notarized first.

29
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:38,100
I can't have you backing out of this
once the main contract is signed.

30
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,780
So, think it over.

31
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,020
I'll draft the notarization papers.
You can go to the site.

32
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,160
I should draft the contract too.
It'll save time.

33
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,260
- Okay.
- I'll get going, then.

34
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:23,850
"Strictly professional," really?

35
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,780
And if the partnership ends,
she wants me gone.

36
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,860
You really play hardball, Ji Eun Oh.

37
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,560
I did the right thing.

38
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,160
This is how it has to be.

39
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,430
(Message)

40
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,500
Did you pull an all-nighter
at the cafe?

41
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,170
I think I just saw you.

42
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:49,410
What?

43
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,510
I'm surprised you saw me
at this hour, Mr. Park.

44
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,220
What, you haven't heard?
I've been working very hard lately.

45
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,820
So, did you pull an all-nighter?

46
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,160
(Eun Oh)

47
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,930
I'll explain later.

48
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:28,080
Whether I'm a snake or a fox,
who cares?

49
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,380
I'm Lee Ji Hyuk,

50
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,450
and I'm just going to be me.

51
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,420
Ji Eun Oh.

52
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,190
(Jo Gyeong Su)

53
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,900
Hey, Gyeong Su. It's me, Ji Hyuk.

54
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,430
Is it too early to call?

55
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:48,870
This is my new number.

56
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,240
Hey, what a surprise.
I wasn't expecting your call.

57
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,510
Hey, I heard you were back
and starting up Mamdaerozip.

58
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,470
How have you been?

59
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,680
Oh, so you heard about my situation.

60
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:02,550
I'm barely making enough to pay rent
and put food on the table at home.

61
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,550
I'm doing well enough
to eat out whenever I want.

62
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,680
What do you mean?

63
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:10,190
- Are you trying to recruit me?
- Are you interested in teaming up?

64
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,730
We're collecting new design ideas,

65
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:19,100
and we'll finalize
the renewal lineup next week.

66
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,160
Right.

67
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,600
During the initial review
of the design ideas,

68
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,640
let's make sure they align
with our brand's tone.

69
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,900
Understood.

70
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,570
We need a dedicated design line
for the overseas market.

71
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,480
You mean, create separate designs
for overseas markets, Director Park?

72
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,920
That's correct.
Each continent likes its own styles.

73
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,890
We should maintain the functionality
but differentiate the styles.

74
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:51,400
But our policy is
to maintain our core identity.

75
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,830
But I don't believe that means
we should be resistant to change.

76
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:58,570
Our company goes back decades,
to the last chairman's generation.

77
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:02,740
But what we need to focus on now
is the future of Shoe Joy.

78
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,010
(Shoe Joy, Shoealls)

79
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,240
He has a point.

80
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,980
Director Park, I trust you have data
to back this proposal?

81
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,880
Of course.

82
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,620
Anything else?

83
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,560
I would like to present a proposal
to the Management Team.

84
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,830
I visited several of our franchises
and asked for a shoe recommendation.

85
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,700
They all just recommended
the bestseller.

86
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,230
Instead of that,

87
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,000
what outfits
I'd be wearing them with,

88
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,870
what colors I usually wear,

89
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,610
or if they're for me
or a gift for my parents,

90
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,240
what my personal style is like...

91
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,980
If they ask these questions first
and then make a recommendation,

92
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,310
I think we'd be far more likely
to make a sale.

93
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,390
Actually, our franchise manual
was written years ago.

94
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,390
Right, yes.

95
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,390
Director Park, review the manual.

96
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,060
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

97
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,060
All right, what's next?

98
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,030
All right, that's all for today.

99
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,700
Good work, everyone.

100
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,480
They say all roads lead to Rome.
Took you long enough to get here.

101
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:21,650
Pardon?

102
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,920
You weren't half bad today.

103
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,660
Now, you're finally acting
like my son.

104
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,300
That's my boy.

105
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,140
Oh, this is Manager Kang's desk.

106
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:49,380
Yes, she got married.
So I've taken over for her.

107
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,680
But the text I received
came from Manager Kang.

108
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,950
It's her old work phone.
Please, have a seat.

109
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:05,560
- Is this him?
- My gosh. No.

110
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,300
You must be Su Bin.
You'll be meeting this man here.

111
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,810
Not him. I want the other guy,
the one I just saw.

112
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,340
He's totally my type.

113
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,880
I'm afraid that's not possible.

114
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:25,450
His minimum requirement is a woman
with a full-time, stable job.

115
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,550
A full-time job?

116
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:30,720
He says it's the minimum proof
of a diligent and responsible life.

117
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,060
Nowadays, everyone wants
to be a video creator.

118
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,660
"I'll quit my job
to be a video creator."

119
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,630
"Should I quit my job
and start a travel channel?"

120
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,930
"I should start my own channel too."
It's the world we live in, isn't it?

121
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,200
I didn't even ask
his qualifications.

122
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,540
I'm taking a shot based on his vibe.

123
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,940
Do you think he'd change his mind
once he actually meets me?

124
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:55,880
Then why would he have signed up
for an agency in the first place?

125
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:01,690
This is a matchmaking agency.
These days, the more a man has,

126
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,650
the more they want a woman
on their level.

127
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,160
It's just human nature, isn't it?

128
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:12,630
The text mentioned two candidates.
Who's the other one?

129
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:18,300
The CEO of a small firm
in his mid-30s. Height, 178cm.

130
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,940
Oh, and both of his parents
are pharmacists.

131
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,270
And he's handsome, right?

132
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:27,910
So what's the catch?

133
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,210
Excuse me?

134
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:32,920
He can't check every single box.
So there must be a catch.

135
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,420
Yes, there is one small drawback.

136
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,820
He's divorced.

137
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,530
With one son.

138
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,860
What did you just say?

139
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,000
- Hello?
- Oh, hello.

140
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,600
What are you doing here?
You didn't even call.

141
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,400
Is something wrong?

142
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:56,710
We're going into business
together now.

143
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:59,840
Are these the cabinets
you mentioned?

144
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,750
They look even better in person.

145
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:05,080
Right?
Now that they're installed here,

146
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,390
they look even more beautiful
and high-end.

147
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:10,390
And she was a huge help
with the color consultation.

148
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,960
Ms. Ji has always had a great eye
for design.

149
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:20,730
Wow, it looks so much cleaner
without the molding.

150
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,900
And this part here came out
exactly as I requested.

151
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,970
They say this part is customizable
however you want.

152
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:31,280
- Right.
- Ma'am, can you come here, please?

153
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,880
Yes, one moment.

154
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:41,920
Don't you think it's a little weird
to show up at my work unannounced?

155
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,890
Work on Hyunmyeong Apts began,
so I was nearby checking on it...

156
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,020
and was on my way back
from an off-site meeting.

157
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,260
It's not like I came here
to see you.

158
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,800
I'm here on business.

159
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,730
Plus, I was curious to see how
these kitchen cabinets turned out.

160
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,240
We'll get everything notarized
before heading back to the office.

161
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:02,770
- Notarized?
- I booked a notary for 4:30 p.m.

162
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:06,910
So I could do two things at once.
Is that really such a problem?

163
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,880
Especially since we're about
to notarize our partnership.

164
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,150
You could've at least texted me.

165
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:17,220
You think I didn't?
I'm not looking for trouble.

166
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:22,460
Let's go to the notary's office
when you're done here.

167
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,070
I'm sorry.
I didn't hear the text alert.

168
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:31,400
Nothing to be sorry about.

169
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,540
Han Min's mom, right?

170
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,540
Would it be okay
if I took photos of the kitchen?

171
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:41,550
Remember I mentioned this?
I'd share them in our group chat...

172
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,650
as a reference
for the other residents.

173
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,350
My gosh, you remember my kid's name?

174
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,520
Of course.
You showed me Han Min's photos.

175
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,590
- How could I forget his name?
- Go ahead and take photos.

176
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:51,690
Great, thank you.

177
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,890
What's the rush?

178
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,290
The notary leaves at 5 p.m.,
so we have to get there by 4:45 p.m.

179
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,830
That's not what I meant.
It doesn't have to be today.

180
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:34,930
For me, it has to be done today.

181
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,570
Because I said I would get it done.

182
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,210
It was brought up this morning.

183
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,980
Are you afraid I'll change my mind
by tomorrow?

184
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,110
No, don't be ridiculous.

185
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:51,450
Once Ji Eun Oh gives her word,
she sticks to it no matter what.

186
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,080
Who wouldn't know that about you?

187
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:57,720
Could you also take responsibility
for my safety?

188
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,090
You're making me really nervous.

189
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:02,790
I'm sticking to the speed limit.
I'm just weaving past cars...

190
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,100
going 20 percent slower
than the limit.

191
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:08,200
Oh, you don't drive,
so you have no sense of speed.

192
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,700
And now, you're back
to talking casually again.

193
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,010
We haven't notarized it yet,
and we haven't signed the agreement.

194
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,980
Then let's go to the notary now.
Quickly.

195
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,550
(Corporate Notarization)

196
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,990
(August 15, 2025, Ji Eun Oh)

197
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,410
Now that
the notarization is out of the way,

198
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:58,850
let's go get something to eat.

199
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:01,220
Since we got the notarization
taken care of,

200
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,760
Let's keep it professional. Mr. Lee.

201
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,890
We still haven't signed
the partnership agreement.

202
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,830
You said we should notarize it
beforehand, right?

203
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,660
This is unbelievable.

204
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,030
If it's all going to be
strictly professional after we sign,

205
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,400
I can still treat you as a junior.

206
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,900
Right?

207
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,740
Man, I'm starving.
Let's go get some gukbap.

208
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,010
No, not gukbap. I don't like it.

209
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:29,980
What? You don't like gukbap?
We used to eat it all the time.

210
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,250
I never liked it, not once.

211
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,120
I like tteokbokki.
Let's go get some.

212
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,760
I mean, I could eat it.

213
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,280
You're really digging in.

214
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,050
Ji Eun Oh.

215
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,950
Aren't you a little disappointed?

216
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,690
That I agreed so easily?

217
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,560
Not at all. Why would I be?

218
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,860
It's a very typical
Lee Ji Hyuk move.

219
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:15,790
Business always comes first for you.

220
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,700
Because money is
all that matters to me?

221
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,070
Bingo.

222
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,990
Was it because of your family?

223
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,560
Is that why you agreed
to the partnership?

224
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,430
Gang Oh...

225
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,640
Did things ever get sorted out
with your brother?

226
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,510
I'd rather not talk
about my personal life.

227
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,910
Okay, we won't.

228
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,200
How did you two get here together?

229
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,000
You're here.

230
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,270
It's kind of a long story.

231
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,110
- Should we take care of this now?
- Yes.

232
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,690
It's news to me too. I have no idea
what's up with those two.

233
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:02,570
Yes, come on in.

234
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:09,940
Here, have a seat.

235
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,010
I heard you were getting
a new web designer,

236
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,210
but it looks like
everything's already set up.

237
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,450
I needed a full-stack web developer
who could also manage the website.

238
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,920
(Partnership Agreement)

239
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:23,450
You work faster than I thought.

240
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,260
How well can one person
really know another?

241
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,290
So you had me pegged
as the slow type.

242
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,900
(Article 10: Death, bankruptcy,
or other causes)

243
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,010
I can't accept terms
that are so favorable to me.

244
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,580
Let's make it 50-50.

245
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,610
For our temporary
three-month partnership,

246
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,810
you need to be compensated
for not using Eunoism's name.

247
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,180
That's why I made the offer,
so let's just leave it as is.

248
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:56,050
If we continue after three months,
we can renegotiate then.

249
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:59,760
I'll add that as a special clause
and make the change. Okay?

250
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,530
Okay, fine.

251
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,400
(Partner A: Lee Ji Hyuk)

252
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,970
(Partner B: Ji Eun Oh)

253
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:16,210
I look forward to working with you,
Manager Ji Eun Oh.

254
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:22,480
I look forward to it too,
CEO Lee Ji Hyuk.

255
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,290
After I contact the turnkey clients,
I'll give you an update.

256
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,420
You're free until then.

257
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,220
Oh, okay.

258
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,760
Well, I'll be going then.

259
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,350
So this is what we've come to.

260
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:06,090
Fine.

261
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,060
I'll be exactly
what you want me to be.

262
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,200
Ji Eun Oh.

263
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:16,900
So you're saying you're going
into business together?

264
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,400
With Ji Hyuk?

265
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,110
Yes, I just came from signing
the partnership agreement.

266
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,670
What? Why?

267
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:27,110
Of all people, why would you
partner with Ji Hyuk?

268
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,410
Because I want to make money.

269
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,360
(Couples' Bar)

270
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:03,980
Seriously, Gang Oh?
Do you not get it?

271
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:09,190
I told you to empty all the trash.
Why'd you skip the bathroom one?

272
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,290
You want me to empty the trash
in the women's restroom too?

273
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,060
You think you're in a position
to be picky about it?

274
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,130
Just empty that into this bag
and throw it all out.

275
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:20,860
In here?

276
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,900
Pack it down. There's plenty of room
for that and more.

277
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,700
Hey, are you the one paying
for these trash bags?

278
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,770
Hey, Yang Jin Gu.

279
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,610
Aren't you going too far?

280
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,310
What am I, your servant?

281
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,650
Looks like
you'll be one for a while.

282
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,620
Since your mom
isn't giving you money.

283
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,080
I'll get the money
by the end of this week.

284
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,490
Sure, whatever.

285
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,090
Wash out all the trash cans.
Leave them upside down out back.

286
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:50,960
Seriously... Darn it.

287
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,670
Oh, Mom, you're home?

288
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,200
I'm so exhausted.

289
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:16,250
When I think about it,

290
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,950
what Gang Oh said
isn't completely wrong.

291
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,820
If I hadn't been in the picture,

292
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:25,390
all the money spent on raising me
would've gone to Gang Oh.

293
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:28,230
I don't think that's true, Eun Oh.

294
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:29,490
Me neither.

295
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:31,960
Hey, it was your parents' decision,
you know?

296
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,730
Of course, it was.

297
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,170
But still...

298
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:38,600
Anyway...

299
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,110
For my mom and for Gang Oh,

300
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,010
I've decided I need to make money.

301
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,180
So, that's how it all happened.

302
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,850
So that's how it happened.

303
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,420
This is insane.

304
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,380
What am I even supposed to say
to that?

305
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,250
Nothing.

306
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:00,760
You can't really know
unless you've been there yourself.

307
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:04,160
It's slow today,
so I'll go check on the kitchen.

308
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:16,210
Gosh, I'm dying to know.

309
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,010
Why is he just standing there?

310
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,810
Is Seong Jae waiting for Eun Oh?

311
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:27,950
Ji Hyuk.

312
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,290
Surprised I came in
without knocking?

313
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,260
Then why did you even
bother knocking?

314
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,160
I guess I was a little impatient.

315
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:39,030
I was just too curious.

316
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,500
About what?

317
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:43,670
About me offering
to partner up with Eun Oh?

318
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,500
What are you thinking?

319
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:50,010
A win-win. It's business.

320
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,840
Is that the only reason?

321
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,280
I already told you. Why ask again?

322
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:57,950
So it's really just about
expanding the business?

323
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,280
Yes.

324
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,050
I mean, what else would there be?

325
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,290
Of course, there is. You...

326
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,690
(Lee Su Bin)

327
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,930
Answer it.

328
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,530
No, it's nothing.

329
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:17,300
Look, Ji Hyuk, you...

330
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,710
It looks important.
You should take it.

331
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,340
(Lee Su Bin)

332
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,880
Let's talk about this later.

333
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,120
Talk later? About what?

334
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,550
Who does he think he is,
grilling me like that?

335
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,350
Whatever I do with Ji Eun Oh
is my business.

336
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,560
Wait, what are you talking about?
Tell me exactly what's going on.

337
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:44,060
They say I'm not good enough.

338
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,060
They say I can't do it.

339
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,060
That I'm not qualified.

340
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:50,630
Apparently,
I don't have what it takes...

341
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:51,740
to be in the upper class.

342
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,740
What are you talking about?
Make it make sense.

343
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:57,440
They said
a no-name video creator like me...

344
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,980
had no chance.

345
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,610
They said I didn't have
a proven track record.

346
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,810
I really love doing it,

347
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,120
and I work so hard on my videos,
but my subscribers just won't go up,

348
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,950
and all my subscribers
ever ask about is you.

349
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,020
My brother's gone,

350
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,960
and I can't tell Dad.

351
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:18,530
I definitely can't tell Mom.

352
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,830
Gosh, why am I even
telling you this...

353
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:23,000
You're my older brother's friend.

354
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,600
Why am I calling you
and whining like this?

355
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:31,880
- Have you had a lot to drink?
- I have, but that's not the point.

356
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:32,980
Did you drink alone?

357
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,410
I told you,
that's not what's important!

358
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,080
It is to me.

359
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:38,580
I asked, are you alone?

360
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,220
Or are you with a friend?

361
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,390
Ha Eun's inside. I'm just out front.

362
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,290
My goodness.

363
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,160
Okay, that's good, then.

364
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,290
But I'm not okay. Not at all.

365
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:50,560
I'm a complete failure!

366
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:53,100
Who said something so harsh to you?

367
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,500
What did the people
at the matchmaking agency say?

368
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:58,800
Yes. That's why I'm getting
a business card made.

369
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,470
Lee Su Bin, Assistant Manager,
PR Team, Songsong Electronics.

370
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,370
That's the business card
I'm going to make.

371
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:08,380
I'm definitely meeting that guy.
Then once he falls for me,

372
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,550
- I'm going to dump him.
- Wait, what? Songsong Electronics?

373
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,850
Are you saying you're going to make
a fake business card?

374
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,290
Yes, I am.

375
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:19,090
I'm going to test the power
of a business card and a real job.

376
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,630
People look down on me
without even meeting me first.

377
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:23,460
I'm going to put it to the test.

378
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:26,560
I'm dying to see what he'll do
once he's fallen for me.

379
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:27,630
Hey, Lee Su Bin.

380
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Hey...

381
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,140
The nerve.

382
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:39,680
The phone is turned off.
Transferring to voicemail...

383
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,150
Not her too.

384
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:51,490
Oh, you're here.

385
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,260
Su Jeong.

386
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,190
This is Cha Cheol Min.
He's the new guy at Mamdaerozip.

387
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,760
We go way back.
She runs things here at the cafe.

388
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:01,430
Hi. We met at the interview, right?

389
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,130
Yes.

390
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,300
Get back to work.

391
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:21,650
Mamdaerozip's first base camp.
It's a little modest, right?

392
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:23,820
It's cozy.

393
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,820
This is your desk, Cheol Min.

394
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:33,530
There's something I need you to do
before we start the website renewal.

395
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:37,530
A banner linking to turnkey services
and a "Meet the Coordinators" menu.

396
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:39,200
I've looked at the website.

397
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:42,670
Your growth is more explosive
than I anticipated.

398
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:46,340
Give me four days.
Which one should I do first?

399
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:47,880
That fast?

400
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:51,950
Start with the turnkey link banner.
Like this.

401
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:56,520
This will take a day and a half.
Four days total for both.

402
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:57,750
Maybe even faster.

403
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:02,230
- I'm impressed.
- Oh, and one more thing.

404
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:05,830
Your portfolio doesn't stand out.
"Coordinator 2 and 3" are generic.

405
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:10,800
Coordinator 2, Yeonnam-dong Apt.
Coordinator 3, Bulgwang-dong Villa.

406
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:13,700
You need specific titles like these.

407
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:15,840
Well, that's going to be your job
from now on.

408
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:17,340
I know.

409
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:22,110
Think you can handle all that
plus developing the new website?

410
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:25,020
It seems a Q and A section
is essential for the new site too.

411
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,980
Did you read my mind or something?

412
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,290
Well, then, I'll get started.

413
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:32,190
You won't hear the notifications
if you wear those.

414
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:35,560
I have eyes, so I can see the board.

415
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:43,930
Okay.

416
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,270
Turnkey services are available.

417
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:51,740
The type and size of your home,
the expected construction duration,

418
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:53,380
and your desired budget.

419
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:57,050
Please email us your project scope,
and we will get back to you.

420
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:00,750
Also, please note
there's a fee for a cost estimate.

421
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,590
Yes. Ohyang-dong, got it.

422
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,960
Oh, really?
Five other projects nearby?

423
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:14,160
Oh, yes, of course.
We can minimize demolition noise.

424
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:15,230
Right.

425
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,840
You heard about our work
on the Hyunmyeong Apartments?

426
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:26,880
Wear black pants and shoes.
Please keep your appearance neat.

427
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:49,530
Hello, these are freshly cooked
and delicious.

428
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,700
Care for a sample?

429
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,810
Hello, ma'am...

430
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:10,290
Oh, excuse me!
We have delicious pollack fritters.

431
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,350
Care for a sample?

432
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:19,760
Would you like one?
Oh, sure. Here you go.

433
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:22,000
Thank you. Enjoy!

434
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,110
Ok Rye? You're early today.

435
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:32,210
- Yes.
- Oh, my! "Ok Rye?"

436
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,510
Are you two dating?

437
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,150
Oh, no, we're not.

438
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:39,480
We've been friends
since we were young.

439
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:42,290
Then how come you two acted
like strangers before?

440
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:46,790
I didn't recognize her at first.
It's been decades.

441
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:49,030
Oh, I see.

442
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:52,330
Anyway, I was asking
why you came so early today.

443
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:56,130
I'm almost at 1,000.
Don't distract me.

444
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:07,740
Oh, thank you. Enjoy!

445
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:09,650
- Hope business is good!
- Thanks.

446
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,350
(Chuseok Special: Pollack Fritters)

447
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:16,390
- Da Jeong.
- Hey.

448
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,660
- Your legs must be killing you.
- Yes.

449
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,860
But it's been manageable.

450
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,330
Prop your legs on a cushion tonight.

451
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:25,200
They could be swollen
in the morning.

452
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,760
I'll have to do that.

453
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:29,900
Go on and get ready to clock out.
Leave when the night shift arrives.

454
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,500
Thanks, Myeong Hui.

455
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:35,270
Thanks to you, I got to try this job
that lets me get off before dinner.

456
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:39,380
Well, it's lucky this was just
a temporary gig for the event.

457
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,180
It's not easy hiding a job
from your mother-in-law...

458
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,450
and Sang Cheol.

459
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:46,620
- You should just tell them.
- I can't do that.

460
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,720
My husband wouldn't stand for it.

461
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:55,020
So, even after you move in,

462
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,190
call me right away
if you have issues.

463
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:01,000
Okay.
But your inspection was so thorough.

464
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,870
- I doubt I'll find anything.
- You never know.

465
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,500
Okay, I will.

466
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:08,000
Oh, and really, thanks to you,

467
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:12,280
I learned how to cut costs
and where to invest wisely.

468
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,340
Thank you so much.

469
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:17,610
I should be thanking you.
You were a pleasure to work with.

470
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:21,050
This is just a little something.

471
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,850
It's some hand cream
and rice cakes for you.

472
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:28,490
Oh! How did you know
I was almost out of hand cream?

473
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:31,890
Thank you.
I'll put them to good use.

474
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:07,030
Ms. Ji?

475
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:13,100
My gosh, when did you get here?

476
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,410
I thought you were studying.

477
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:20,640
I left the milk money over there.
And the rice cakes in front of it...

478
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:24,250
A client gave them to me today
to celebrate the end of the project.

479
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:27,980
I actually bought the milk
to have with rice cakes for dinner.

480
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:31,490
Gosh, I didn't mean to make you
feel like you had to repay me.

481
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:33,960
This isn't because of the sandwich.

482
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:36,960
I'm serious.
I got three of these boxes.

483
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:42,700
But if you just leave these things,
how would I know what you bought?

484
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:45,540
Oh, I was going to text you later.

485
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:48,500
You have my number?

486
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,510
Yes. It's in my notes
from the Mapo site.

487
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:56,680
Well, anyway...
I'll enjoy the rice cakes. Thanks.

488
00:32:58,510 --> 00:32:59,720
Good luck with your exam.

489
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,320
You even know about my exam?

490
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:06,260
After your first day on my site,
I asked you to come back, but...

491
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:08,020
you said you couldn't
because you had class.

492
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,800
You were attending classes
and studying...

493
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,630
special DC machines, generators,
and induced voltage direction.

494
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,000
When I saw you studying all that,

495
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,100
I figured it had to be
the Certified Electrician Exam.

496
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:23,140
Oh, my. How did you know that?

497
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,040
The people I work with every day...

498
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,550
are carpenters, electricians,
and engineers.

499
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:31,780
My goodness.

500
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:33,980
I can't get anything past you,
can I?

501
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:46,760
- He wants you in the office now.
- Who does?

502
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
You'd better go.

503
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:07,320
I'd like you to meet someone.
He's redoing Mamdaerozip's site...

504
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,690
and managing it, Cha Cheol Min.
And this is the CEO of Eunoism.

505
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:14,520
Manager Ji Eun Oh will be
our turnkey partner at Mamdaerozip.

506
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:19,330
- I'm Cha Cheol Min.
- You're the full-stack developer.

507
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:20,600
(Full-stack: Builds front-end
and back-end independently.)

508
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:23,870
Yes, he was
a computer science major.

509
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:26,840
I'm Ji Eun Oh.

510
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,910
So, should we take
this meeting elsewhere?

511
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:37,450
Of our four turnkey clients,
one sent a floor plan they measured,

512
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:39,320
and I've already measured two.

513
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,720
You've already done
the measurements?

514
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,720
I'll get the last one measured
by the day after tomorrow.

515
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:51,590
- Hey, but...
- Mr. Lee.

516
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,200
Sorry?

517
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,230
Why are you calling me "Hey?"
We're partners.

518
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,940
Oh, right.

519
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:01,870
Mr. Lee.

520
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:03,370
Go on.

521
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,640
What does this star symbol mean?

522
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:09,710
My gut says they're likely
to ask for an estimate.

523
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,420
They readily agreed
when I mentioned the estimate fee.

524
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,720
You charge for estimates?

525
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:18,590
People trying to get free expertise
when they're still on the fence...

526
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,920
and just walk away with it?

527
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,990
That's not how we do things here.

528
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,930
These are the designer profiles
from Mr. Jo Gyeong Su.

529
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,700
You make the call.

530
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:33,270
Me?

531
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,910
Okay, I will.

532
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,810
Text me
if you run into any problems.

533
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:53,860
We only signed the contract
yesterday,

534
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:56,290
and he's already this far along?

535
00:35:58,860 --> 00:35:59,860
Hey, Eun Oh.

536
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,860
Why was Ji Hyuk being
so formal with you?

537
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:05,740
We're business partners now.
We agreed to keep it professional.

538
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,110
But it wasn't just the formality.

539
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:10,670
It was... What's the word? Yes.

540
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,810
He was all business with you.

541
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,940
That's what I wanted.

542
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,350
We made an agreement,
so we should stick to it.

543
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:20,880
- Isn't it awkward for you?
- It's a little weird, but...

544
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,620
I prefer it that way.

545
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:26,560
I don't know.
Ji Hyuk seemed totally different.

546
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:32,230
- He's always been a go-getter.
- True.

547
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:35,930
- Hey.
- Oh, welcome.

548
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,270
But he must be getting
tons of coordination requests too.

549
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:45,070
So why did he spend all day
just on the turnkey project?

550
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,520
Go get some dinner.

551
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,320
- Can I just have some cup noodles?
- No!

552
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,860
Sorry?

553
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,600
That's not what I meant.
It's just...

554
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,460
You can't eat in the office.
You have to eat outside the cafe.

555
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:09,830
Out the back door.

556
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:11,330
Okay.

557
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,500
What about you?

558
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,910
I'm not hungry.
And I don't have time.

559
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:20,680
Look, you're working late
on your first day.

560
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,040
I'm sorry we can't even
grab a bite together.

561
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:24,610
That's actually better for me.

562
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,120
In that case, here.

563
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:41,060
This is a list of potential clients
I filtered from today's requests.

564
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,530
I've organized their info,

565
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:46,570
including contact details,
address, timeline, and scope.

566
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,610
Wait, you organized all this
and printed it out?

567
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:53,410
Well... If you don't like it,
I can email it to you from now on.

568
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:54,510
No.

569
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:58,610
You're much quicker than I expected.
Really, thank you. This is great.

570
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,920
Behind that are coordinator resumes
that came through the company email,

571
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,290
and I printed out
their portfolios too.

572
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,830
(Gangha-dong blueprints)

573
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,940
(Gangha-dong apartment client brief)

574
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,340
He does a bit of everything.

575
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,660
(The last bus!)

576
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,500
What was that?

577
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,640
She hasn't left?

578
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:56,070
Is she planning to pull
an all-nighter here?

579
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,640
Man, Ji Eun Oh is fearless
to a fault.

580
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,380
If I were her, I'd be too scared
to even go out after what happened.

581
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,320
What?

582
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,030
She's leaving now?

583
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,900
She should've left earlier.

584
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,210
Did she book a taxi?

585
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,130
What, she didn't book a taxi?

586
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:53,700
She shouldn't just hail any taxi.
She needs to book one! Book it!

587
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:57,770
No way.

588
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,100
What? She's taking the bus?

589
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:05,710
Are you kidding me? It's a long walk
from the bus stop to her house.

590
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:08,280
She's so unbelievably reckless.

591
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:11,810
I'm scared walking home at night,

592
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,450
so I leave before the last bus.

593
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,850
I even wear my dad's jacket
and a hat.

594
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,290
Goodness.

595
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:27,130
Even when she was making good money
at Doogle, she was like this.

596
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,300
I've never once seen her take a cab.

597
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:30,670
Seriously?

598
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:36,810
She's not a kid anymore.

599
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:39,310
Does she really
still have to catch the last bus?

600
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:47,040
What am I doing?

601
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,140
She's not my junior anymore.

602
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,880
Why so worried about a partner?
Don't you have better things to do?

603
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:58,590
Don't give her a second thought.
But why not? She's my partner.

604
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:02,090
Instead, I'll just have to give her
a serious warning.

605
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,290
She's fearless,
after all she's been through.

606
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,060
Unbelievable.

607
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,500
My gosh.

608
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:19,480
What?

609
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,040
Hey, what's wrong?

610
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:24,950
It's 2:30 a.m.

611
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:26,580
Why aren't you in bed?

612
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,690
Oh, you go ahead and sleep.
I'm just going to finish this up.

613
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:31,750
When's the exam, anyway?

614
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,890
You stay up past 3 a.m.
every single night.

615
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,330
It's fine.
They haven't announced the date yet.

616
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,860
Doesn't studying in this room
remind you of Ji Hyuk?

617
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,400
You miss him, don't you?

618
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,100
Okay, all right.

619
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:51,010
Just try not to stay up
past 3 a.m., okay?

620
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:05,920
Get two and freeze them.
They'll last until Chuseok.

621
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,360
- All right.
- Great.

622
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:08,690
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

623
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:12,630
Try our pollack fritters.
It's tender and not fishy at all.

624
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:16,100
Kids absolutely love it.
Here, try a sample.

625
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:19,300
- Is it good?
- Yes.

626
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:20,370
- I'll take one, please.
- Sure.

627
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:23,370
- Here you go. Thank you. Enjoy.
- Thank you.

628
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:27,140
- Da Jeong.
- Hey.

629
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:28,810
I'm going to get some eel.
You want any?

630
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:32,150
It's 40 percent off at closing time.
It's high-quality and tastes great.

631
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:34,850
Eel? My husband loves eel.

632
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:37,950
You get paid today, so splurge.
Treat the family.

633
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:39,690
Maybe I should.

634
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:46,300
Last two. Okay, good.

635
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,700
All right, that's it for today.

636
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:52,300
- Be sure to do cool-down stretches.
- Okay, thank you.

637
00:43:58,610 --> 00:43:59,610
Hello.

638
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:03,550
We're here so often.
We should introduce ourselves.

639
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,520
I'd rather not.

640
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:09,150
This is making me uncomfortable.

641
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:11,790
Then how are we supposed
to introduce ourselves?

642
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,720
And why would we do that?

643
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:20,430
I wonder what kind of family
she comes from. She's so guarded.

644
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:22,230
Excuse me, wait!

645
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:32,710
We see each other here all the time.
It's members-only, we're all vetted.

(Managing Director Min Jung Ho,

647
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:53,660
Wait for me in the car.

648
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:56,370
- Why?
- Yeong Ra.

649
00:44:58,270 --> 00:44:59,270
That was quick.

650
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:06,380
Oh, you must be her driver.

651
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:10,110
Shall we?

652
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,790
What's going on here?

653
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:23,730
I'm only here because I don't want
to be bothered while I work out.

654
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:25,830
So please get to the point.

655
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:28,730
My point is that I want
to talk to you, Yeong Ra.

656
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:32,700
My name is Min Jung Ho.

657
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:35,800
I was studying in the US
and just came back three months ago.

658
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:38,170
And now, I'm learning the ropes
at Hyeonyu Department Store.

I don't have a business card.

661
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:44,210
I'm in my last semester
of grad school.

662
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:46,480
- Art school.
- Art school?

663
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,520
What's your major?

664
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:55,320
Oh, right. I'm just the driver.

665
00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:08,670
I'll see you then.
I'll be in touch, Yeong Ra.

666
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:29,490

- He goes to my gym.
- That I know.

Hey, Park Yeong Ra.

669
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:42,800
Why are you meeting a stranger?
What if your mom finds out?

670
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:44,870
This is what my mom wants.

671
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:47,740
What?

672
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:49,650
It's complicated.

673
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:51,650
You're saying
your mom made you do this?

674
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:55,320
To talk to any random guy
and agree to a date?

675
00:46:56,490 --> 00:46:59,860
Okay, let me ask you something
I'm really curious about.

676
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:03,090
Why do you only do
exactly what your mom tells you?

677
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,930
I mean, forget everything else.
Just take your webtoons for example.

678
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:09,230
Clearly, you're very talented.

679
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:11,430
So why paint
instead of drawing more webtoons?

680
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:14,040
Why do I have to be
a webtoon artist?

681
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,340
Well, because you're so good at it.

682
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:20,340
Actually, never mind.
I've never seen your paintings,

683
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:22,140
so I can't really judge, but...

684
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,280
From what I've seen,
you have a real talent for webtoons.

685
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:29,350
That file you sent? I couldn't stop.
It was just that good.

686
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:31,220
Really?

687
00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:33,420
How many times do I have to say it?
It's good.

688
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:38,460
Did you find the corrupted file yet?
The one from the middle.

689
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:40,630
Oh, that's right!

690
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:42,530
I need to call my mom.

691
00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:46,200
Ms. Jang isn't one to be late.

692
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,100
I'm sure you'll get
the required number of pieces.

693
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:52,910
If you guarantee it, Professor Kim,
I suppose I have no reason to worry.

694
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:57,910
Please make sure Yeong Ra studies
the artist's note thoroughly.

695
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:01,520
Whatever questions she's asked,
she's the one who has to answer.

696
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:04,420
This Flower Painting Series
originated with Yeong Ra.

697
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,960
Oh, of course. I understand.

698
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:08,020
Absolutely.

699
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:14,530
I know you're busy,
so I'll get going.

700
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:16,530
Oh, just a moment.

701
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:35,980
This perfume smells wonderful.

702
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:38,320
Oh, thank you.

703
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:41,420
After the exhibition, I'll have to
get you an even nicer one.

704
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:58,270
I had tea with Min Jung Ho today.

705
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:00,410
You did?

706
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:04,450
(My Daughter Yeong Ra)

707
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:09,020
You're on your way
to the studio, right?

708
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:11,290
What about the next date?

709
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:17,190
Oh, really?
You turned him down at first, right?

710
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:21,560
Yes. He offered his business card,
but I refused.

711
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:24,400
You must be with the driver,
and Jang's at the studio.

712
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,930
Let's talk about the details
at home.

713
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:41,580
What did I just hear?

714
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:43,320
Then again, it makes sense.

715
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:44,650
You don't have to say anything.

716
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:47,120
I wasn't going to.

717
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,160
No, I mean...

718
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:52,790
You were trying to become a painter
just so you could get married.

719
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:57,170
So that's why you quit your webtoon.
Because your mom told you to. Right?

720
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:58,700
Yes.

721
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:01,240
Then about "Take My Heart."

722
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:03,710
Is it going to be your only webtoon?

723
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:06,170
I suppose so.

724
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,810
Well, then you have to tell me
the rest of the story.

725
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:12,380
No, you should finish it.
At least for your own sake.

726
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:20,120
- Hey.
- Yes?

727
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:21,590
It's just that...

728
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:25,860
Do you really think it's good?

729
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,760
What are you going to do
if I say yes?

730
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:31,230
You won't tell me what's next.
You're so weird.

731
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:35,640
I've said it's great so many times,
and I'm dying to know what happens,

732
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:36,910
and you're asking me again?

733
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,570
No, that's not what I mean.

734
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:46,110
In the middle, So Ri asks Dokgo Chan
to teach her how to fight.

735
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:50,550
But I'm stuck on the fight scenes,
so I'm sketching them separately.

736
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:55,490
Could you give me some pointers?
Since you studied PE.

737
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:59,060
I can't create a fighting style
that really feels like So Ri.

738
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:01,660
Is that right?

739
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,930
Okay, let me see.

740
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:19,010
Hey, what is this?

741
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:23,220
Hey, it's a guy with long hair
fighting a guy with short hair.

742
00:51:23,590 --> 00:51:24,850
Exactly.

743
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:28,690
Okay, Yeong Ra.
Look, for this character...

744
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:31,590
So Ri used to be
a ballet dancer, right?

745
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:34,900
So her fighting style
and all her moves...

746
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,400
Shouldn't you draw them
to look more like a ballerina's?

747
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:39,800
Like a ballerina?

748
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:42,200
Yes, exactly. Like a ballerina.

749
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:46,370
She should fight with elegant turns
and graceful footwork.

750
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:49,010
Imagine her hair flowing
in the moonlight...

751
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:51,780
Something like this.
Wouldn't that be cool?

752
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:20,780
Dokgo Chan!

753
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:22,800
My, you drew her as I described.
She's exactly the So Ri I pictured.

754
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:26,510
- Yeong Ra, you're so talented.
- Really?

755
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:27,580
Yes.

756
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:38,650
So you were being serious?

757
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:42,290
If you ask me ten more times,
it'll make it a hundred.

758
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,490
A business card for a Songsong Group
PR team employee.

759
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:47,630
If you actually make one, you know
that's document forgery, right?

760
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:51,030
You've said that a dozen times too.

761
00:53:53,770 --> 00:53:55,540
What am I going to do
with you, Su Bin?

762
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:59,710
Why are you so stubborn?
Don't you see how crazy this is?

763
00:54:00,410 --> 00:54:03,710
- Mind your own business and go.
- Mind my own business?

764
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,810
How can I mind my own business?

765
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:08,420
You're Ji Hyuk's little sister,
and I know your parents too.

766
00:54:08,850 --> 00:54:11,720
And you're going to forge documents
just to go on a date with some guy?

767
00:54:12,050 --> 00:54:13,860
Am I supposed to just stand by
and watch you become a criminal?

768
00:54:16,090 --> 00:54:17,090
Look.

769
00:54:17,330 --> 00:54:19,760
I won't become a criminal
if you just keep your mouth shut.

770
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:23,700
I'll make him fall for me
before he finds out my card is fake.

771
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:25,170
A month is all I need.

772
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:27,200
Su Bin.

773
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:31,510
You can't just make someone
fall for you.

774
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:33,480
That's what you think.

775
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:35,610
This is unbelievable.

776
00:54:37,510 --> 00:54:38,810
You see,

777
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:42,620
I have to do this,
or I'll regret it forever.

778
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,920
The moment I saw his picture,
I just knew he was the one.

779
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:47,990
I've never felt that way before.

780
00:54:48,290 --> 00:54:50,830
He has everything
I've ever wanted in a man.

781
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:52,760
He's even good-looking.

782
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:54,730
But just because
I don't have a real job,

783
00:54:55,130 --> 00:54:59,500
I have to give up without trying?
I can't stand that.

784
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:04,740
Lee Su Bin.

785
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,270
Are you really...

786
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,210
confident that you can make him
genuinely fall for you?

787
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,610
Yes, I am.

788
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:13,250
And if he does fall for you,
like you say he will,

789
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:16,080
are you going to tell him
you'll quit to be a content creator?

790
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:17,150
Yes.

791
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:28,660
Then wait.

793
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:38,340
Hold on a second.

794
00:55:40,810 --> 00:55:44,550
Here's the project estimate.
Could you please confirm this first?

795
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:46,820
For all four of them?

796
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:48,580
That was fast.

797
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:51,890
But why are you giving this to me?

798
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:54,790
What do you mean?

799
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:58,330
You make
all the turnkey decisions, Ms. Ji.

800
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:03,570
Once you confirm the blueprints
and set the construction schedule,

801
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:06,300
I just supply materials and labor
and get my commission. That's it.

802
00:56:07,270 --> 00:56:11,370
But it's our first project together.
Shouldn't you check on the process?

803
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:14,110
No. If I were going to do that,
why would we even be partners?

804
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:18,450
I'd make more money on my own.
Haven't you seen our website?

805
00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:20,150
We're flooded with new jobs.

806
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,680
I'm already swamped
just handling those.

807
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:24,920
That's why...

808
00:56:26,290 --> 00:56:27,860
I entrusted it to someone
I can rely on.

810
00:56:31,390 --> 00:56:34,300
So, I can pick
any designers I want...

811
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:37,900
and assign the projects
as I see fit?

812
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:41,700
First, send out the estimates,
and have the client sign off.

813
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:45,940
- Right.
- And you need to choose a designer.

814
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,610
I've already reviewed
all the designer portfolios.

815
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:50,880
Remember I mentioned
Mr. Jo Gyeong Su, the team lead?

816
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:55,250
He's working remotely, so I'll send
his number for you to coordinate.

817
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:56,950
Okay.

818
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:00,460
Okay, so send these quotes
to the clients,

819
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:03,690
and you don't need to report to me
until the projects are finalized.

820
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:09,300
- Okay.
- All right, I'll let you get to it.

and carried my bags for me,
even in elementary school.

855
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:52,230
That's why I've always envied you.
I never had a son.

856
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:56,660
I miss my Ji Hyuk.

857
00:59:58,070 --> 01:00:00,270
He's a real handful, that kid.

858
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:07,840
(Mamdaerozip)

859
01:00:08,810 --> 01:00:09,840
Welcome back.

860
01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:11,750
Do you have eyes
in the back of your head?

861
01:00:12,450 --> 01:00:14,050
I felt the vibrations.

862
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:16,520
I just added
the Coordinator Introduction Menu.

863
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:18,420
You did?

864
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,860
(Mom)

865
01:00:29,830 --> 01:00:30,930
Hello, Mom.

866
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:32,900
Ji Hyuk.

867
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:34,800
Just come have one meal with me.

868
01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:37,070
What?

869
01:00:37,870 --> 01:00:38,870
I just...

870
01:00:39,370 --> 01:00:41,210
want to have a meal with you.

871
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:43,440
Is that too much to ask?

872
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:48,250
Why not? Of course, I can.

873
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:50,150
You can?

874
01:00:50,490 --> 01:00:51,650
When should I come over?

875
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:53,620
Tonight.

876
01:00:55,090 --> 01:00:56,190
All right.

877
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:58,460
And bring your laundry
if you have any.

878
01:00:59,130 --> 01:01:01,230
Okay, I'm hanging up. See you later.

879
01:01:02,730 --> 01:01:03,730
Okay, Mom.

880
01:01:11,970 --> 01:01:16,040
(450-750V general-purpose
single-core PVC insulated wire...)

881
01:01:25,290 --> 01:01:27,420
(My Wife Kim Da Jeong)

882
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,120
What?

883
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:32,560
So you're really not coming home?

884
01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:35,060
Can't you come home for dinner,
just for tonight?

885
01:01:35,330 --> 01:01:37,030
I told you. I can't.

886
01:01:37,330 --> 01:01:39,430
I just don't understand why not.

887
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:41,900
Why can't you just come home
a few hours early?

888
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:45,140
I'm in the study hall.
I can't talk for long.

889
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:46,440
I have to go.

890
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:53,280
And I can't even tell him
Ji Hyuk is coming.

891
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:03,660
That smells incredible, dear.

892
01:02:04,390 --> 01:02:05,390
It really does, doesn't it?

893
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:08,800
Give him a call so he can eat this
before it gets cold.

894
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:13,200
- How close is Ji Hyuk?
- How about right here, Grandma?

895
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,440
Oh, my goodness!

896
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:18,910
- Ji Hyuk!
- My gosh.

897
01:02:18,970 --> 01:02:20,070
You came.

898
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:22,580
I'm back.

899
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:24,150
Grandma, Mom.

900
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:26,350
What do you mean, you're back?

901
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:28,950
I mean I'm home, Mom.

902
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:31,150
So you came back for good?

903
01:02:31,490 --> 01:02:32,490
That's right.

904
01:02:33,290 --> 01:02:34,620
I've come back
to live with you again.

905
01:03:20,970 --> 01:03:23,670
(Our Golden Days)

906
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,140
What are you doing waltzing in here?
Who said you could?

907
01:03:26,210 --> 01:03:30,510
What are you doing? I have to go.
You're taking a shower?

908
01:03:30,610 --> 01:03:35,020
You're really forcing my hand.
When was your last checkup?

909
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:36,650
Come with me, Ms. Ji.

910
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:38,490
It's an old house
with a nice layout,

911
01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:40,590
so I'd really like
to do the project.

912
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:44,430
Ms. Ji, is this charity or art?
This is a business, not a club.

913
01:03:44,490 --> 01:03:46,890
Do you think this is just a hobby?
How can you be so naive?

914
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:49,930
Those two... Did something happen
between you two?

915
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,170
Would Eun Oh want me to tell you
what happened between the two of us?
