1
00:00:01,445 --> 00:00:02,815
Eun Oh, you dropped this...

2
00:00:16,895 --> 00:00:18,395
What? Dad!

3
00:00:20,495 --> 00:00:21,495
Dad?

4
00:00:22,165 --> 00:00:25,005
- Mr. Early, you're his dad? - What?

5
00:00:26,835 --> 00:00:28,075
Wait, "Mr. Early?"

6
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:32,445
What? Do you two know each other?

7
00:00:36,115 --> 00:00:38,615
We're friends.

8
00:00:39,485 --> 00:00:41,555
- Yes. - Friends?

9
00:00:43,785 --> 00:00:44,785
No, wait.

10
00:00:45,055 --> 00:00:47,895
How do you know my dad? How did you two meet?

11
00:00:48,455 --> 00:00:52,325
Hold on a second. How do you two know each other?

12
00:00:55,635 --> 00:00:57,635
He's the CEO I'm partnering with.

13
00:00:59,365 --> 00:01:00,435
She was my junior.

14
00:01:01,475 --> 00:01:03,175
He was my senior in our club, too.

15
00:01:03,805 --> 00:01:05,075
And we're also business partners.

16
00:01:06,475 --> 00:01:09,175
So, you two are business partners,

17
00:01:10,075 --> 00:01:12,615
and you know each other from a college club?

18
00:01:14,485 --> 00:01:15,485
Yes.

19
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:21,255
No. But I did find someone I want to marry.

20
00:01:21,455 --> 00:01:23,625
It's just a one-sided thing.

21
00:01:23,925 --> 00:01:26,725
One-sided? So, you have an unrequited love?

22
00:01:27,365 --> 00:01:29,665
You're so outgoing. Why didn't you tell her?

23
00:01:29,665 --> 00:01:32,335
I did, and she turned me down.

24
00:01:32,635 --> 00:01:33,765
She's someone who...

25
00:01:35,335 --> 00:01:36,605
She was at my wedding.

26
00:01:42,615 --> 00:01:43,645
Eun Oh.

27
00:01:44,815 --> 00:01:47,885
How do you know my dad?

28
00:01:48,485 --> 00:01:50,615
No, I mean, how did you two even meet?

29
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:58,165
I was just reminded of my son who left home.

30
00:01:58,795 --> 00:02:01,895
I'd like to think someone out there might do the same for him.

31
00:02:02,235 --> 00:02:03,465
When he's exhausted and struggling.

32
00:02:06,805 --> 00:02:08,735
So that son he was talking about was Ji Hyuk.

33
00:02:09,935 --> 00:02:11,075
How?

34
00:02:12,445 --> 00:02:13,875
How?

35
00:02:14,475 --> 00:02:16,615
But more importantly, it's freezing out.

36
00:02:16,615 --> 00:02:19,345
You shouldn't be out here this long, especially after surgery, right?

37
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:22,685
Wait, you know about Eun Oh's surgery, too?

38
00:02:24,015 --> 00:02:25,025
I'm getting hungry, too.

39
00:02:25,555 --> 00:02:26,955
- Should we get going now? - Right. Let's go.

40
00:02:26,955 --> 00:02:28,395
Wait, hold on a second.

41
00:02:28,855 --> 00:02:31,325
- Take this. - Oh, right.

42
00:02:32,565 --> 00:02:34,565
Wait, what about me?

43
00:02:35,895 --> 00:02:37,765
Today was just supposed to be the two of us.

44
00:02:38,335 --> 00:02:39,905
I'll see you tomorrow, Mr. Lee.

45
00:02:40,765 --> 00:02:43,005
See you at home. Let's go.

46
00:02:45,275 --> 00:02:46,275
Wait!

47
00:02:48,615 --> 00:02:49,815
My dad and Eun Oh?

48
00:02:50,575 --> 00:02:53,315
There's no connection between them. How did they meet?

49
00:02:55,085 --> 00:02:56,215
Friends?

50
00:02:57,255 --> 00:03:01,225
Talk about a small world. What are the odds?

51
00:03:02,025 --> 00:03:03,155
Tell me about it.

52
00:03:05,265 --> 00:03:06,365
So, does that mean...

53
00:03:06,695 --> 00:03:09,035
the one you felt uncomfortable sharing the workspace with...

54
00:03:09,365 --> 00:03:10,665
was my son, Ji Hyuk?

55
00:03:13,335 --> 00:03:15,935
- Yes. - It's fine. Don't worry about it.

56
00:03:16,275 --> 00:03:19,345
After all, I told you about my son who ran away and broke my heart.

57
00:03:20,405 --> 00:03:23,615
Don't you worry about that. My lips are sealed.

58
00:03:23,915 --> 00:03:25,085
I know.

59
00:03:26,085 --> 00:03:28,085
Let's see.

60
00:03:29,215 --> 00:03:31,155
- Here, eat up. - No, you first, please.

61
00:03:31,215 --> 00:03:33,855
Come on, you need to eat well to recover quickly.

62
00:03:37,255 --> 00:03:38,265
Here you go.

63
00:03:38,795 --> 00:03:41,435
- Let's eat. - Thank you for the food.

64
00:03:46,865 --> 00:03:48,005
This is delicious.

65
00:03:49,135 --> 00:03:50,135
By the way...

66
00:03:51,135 --> 00:03:54,375
I guess it's going to be hard for us to talk now. Am I right?

67
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:56,375
Why is that?

68
00:03:56,815 --> 00:03:58,945
Between us,

69
00:03:59,285 --> 00:04:01,045
that boy, Ji Hyuk, is caught right in the middle.

70
00:04:02,755 --> 00:04:06,555
That's just how people are. Sometimes, it's much easier...

71
00:04:06,885 --> 00:04:09,925
to confide in someone who isn't tangled up in your life.

72
00:04:10,495 --> 00:04:15,335
That's why people go to monks, priests, and pastors,

73
00:04:15,435 --> 00:04:17,895
or even doctors for counselling.

74
00:04:21,975 --> 00:04:23,735
What we have is separate from all that.

75
00:04:24,505 --> 00:04:27,245
Do you think you'll feel uncomfortable around me now?

76
00:04:27,975 --> 00:04:31,145
I'm more worried you'll be the one who feels uncomfortable.

77
00:04:33,845 --> 00:04:35,355
To me,

78
00:04:35,815 --> 00:04:38,355
you were like a gift sent from my dad.

79
00:04:39,425 --> 00:04:42,555
You remind me so much of my dad, and you even think like him.

80
00:04:43,095 --> 00:04:44,725
So I've really come to rely on you.

81
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:50,095
Thank you. I appreciate you saying that.

82
00:04:50,735 --> 00:04:52,205
Thanks to you,

83
00:04:53,235 --> 00:04:57,375
I now understand young people. And the fact that...

84
00:04:57,635 --> 00:05:00,075
you, someone my son's age, could understand me...

85
00:05:00,545 --> 00:05:02,145
made me so grateful.

86
00:05:06,245 --> 00:05:07,345
The truth is,

87
00:05:08,285 --> 00:05:11,355
the CEO I used to be partners with offered me a position...

88
00:05:11,355 --> 00:05:13,425
as the head of design at his company.

89
00:05:14,285 --> 00:05:15,925
But that CEO...

90
00:05:17,055 --> 00:05:18,825
is the one you know.

91
00:05:19,865 --> 00:05:21,535
So I don't know if I should join his company...

92
00:05:21,795 --> 00:05:24,595
or go back to running my business like before.

93
00:05:25,335 --> 00:05:27,505
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.

94
00:05:29,135 --> 00:05:31,135
As for me...

95
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:35,675
I'm having a hard time finding a job with my electrician certification.

96
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:39,345
So I was wondering if maybe on one of your design sites,

97
00:05:40,245 --> 00:05:44,685
I could do steady work as a labourer. That's what I was going to ask.

98
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,955
A labourer? But...

99
00:05:49,395 --> 00:05:51,795
Ji Hyuk is doing so well, isn't he?

100
00:05:51,895 --> 00:05:55,265
Come on. That's a company he took over with investor money.

101
00:05:55,895 --> 00:05:57,235
He's just the CEO in name.

102
00:05:57,535 --> 00:06:00,535
He has to work like a dog to get that company off the ground.

103
00:06:00,965 --> 00:06:02,135
Anyway,

104
00:06:02,435 --> 00:06:05,905
can parents just live off their successful kids these days?

105
00:06:06,605 --> 00:06:07,605
Everyone has to make their own way.

106
00:06:10,915 --> 00:06:12,045
My mom's the same.

107
00:06:12,315 --> 00:06:15,385
She's determined to pay me back for helping her open the business.

108
00:06:16,855 --> 00:06:18,485
Right, I forgot to ask you something.

109
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,585
How did you end up having surgery?

110
00:06:23,855 --> 00:06:27,795
An unbelievable thing happened to me.

111
00:06:38,005 --> 00:06:40,575
- What's taking them so long? - That was a great meal!

112
00:06:40,675 --> 00:06:42,245
I'm stuffed.

113
00:06:42,545 --> 00:06:46,315
Oh, boy. You should take a taxi. I'll get one for you.

114
00:06:46,385 --> 00:06:48,715
No, that's okay. I've been sitting all day.

115
00:06:48,785 --> 00:06:52,085
- I'll take the bus so I can stand. - All right, if you're sure.

116
00:06:52,355 --> 00:06:53,355
I'll see you again soon.

117
00:06:53,755 --> 00:06:54,925
Okay. Get home safe.

118
00:06:55,255 --> 00:06:57,395
- Take care of yourself. - I will.

119
00:07:04,765 --> 00:07:06,065
Come out, you punk.

120
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:17,215
What? How did you know I was hiding, Dad?

121
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:21,445
The woman you have a crush on... That's her, isn't it?

122
00:07:24,085 --> 00:07:26,185
What? Dad, how did you know?

123
00:07:26,255 --> 00:07:28,825
What, you think I'm a psychic or something?

124
00:07:29,095 --> 00:07:31,425
When I saw you waiting for her out here in the cold,

125
00:07:31,425 --> 00:07:33,765
I just put two and two together.

126
00:07:34,895 --> 00:07:36,965
About that, Dad...

127
00:07:37,265 --> 00:07:40,605
Did you, by any chance, say anything to Eun Oh about me?

128
00:07:40,865 --> 00:07:43,075
Since we live together, I can just ride with you, right?

129
00:07:43,535 --> 00:07:46,145
Hey, Dad. Come on, Dad!

130
00:07:46,205 --> 00:07:48,315
Gosh, why are you being so annoying?

131
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:51,945
Why won't you just tell me? How do you even know Eun Oh?

132
00:07:52,045 --> 00:07:54,145
- I'm tired. - Come on, Dad.

133
00:07:55,755 --> 00:07:57,515
Gosh, this is driving me crazy!

134
00:08:02,295 --> 00:08:04,855
What's going on? Did they have another fight?

135
00:08:07,095 --> 00:08:09,495
That's incredible. What are the odds?

136
00:08:09,795 --> 00:08:13,705
It reminded me how enemies are bound to clash in tight spots.

137
00:08:14,365 --> 00:08:16,205
"Tight spots?" Why would you say that?

138
00:08:16,605 --> 00:08:20,805
You remember how our son said he found someone he wants to marry?

139
00:08:21,105 --> 00:08:22,675
Well, that's her.

140
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:25,785
My goodness, honey. Are you serious?

141
00:08:26,145 --> 00:08:30,015
When I told him we were friends, he got completely spooked.

142
00:08:31,485 --> 00:08:33,325
Is she really that special?

143
00:08:33,955 --> 00:08:36,495
She's wonderful. Absolutely wonderful.

144
00:08:36,825 --> 00:08:41,325
- My, then they should get married. - Hey, come on now.

145
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:44,595
Aren't you counting your chickens before they've hatched?

146
00:08:45,065 --> 00:08:48,405
Remember what Ji Hyuk said before? That she was at his wedding.

147
00:08:49,175 --> 00:08:51,875
Gosh, that crazy kid, Ji Hyuk.

148
00:08:56,215 --> 00:08:58,985
No way. How can my dad and Eun Oh possibly be friends?

149
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:11,195
Seong Jae's first marriage.

150
00:09:12,025 --> 00:09:13,825
Seong Jae's father forced him to get a divorce.

151
00:09:13,825 --> 00:09:16,865
Seong Jae's father will never give up on him.

152
00:09:16,865 --> 00:09:18,665
It won't just be you.

153
00:09:19,165 --> 00:09:21,205
Your family will be in danger, too.

154
00:09:21,205 --> 00:09:22,875
Because of your relationship with him,

155
00:09:23,075 --> 00:09:25,075
do you want him to be disowned by his family?

156
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:28,175
Was this what Ji Hyuk was talking about?

157
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,185
What do I do?

158
00:09:33,515 --> 00:09:35,015
What am I supposed to do?

159
00:09:39,355 --> 00:09:40,355
(Seong Jae)

160
00:09:44,695 --> 00:09:45,765
Seong Jae?

161
00:09:46,265 --> 00:09:47,695
Come outside. I'm right in front of your house.

162
00:09:48,595 --> 00:09:49,665
In front of my place?

163
00:09:52,365 --> 00:09:53,365
Seong Jae!

164
00:10:03,115 --> 00:10:04,675
Seong Jae, what are you doing here?

165
00:10:05,715 --> 00:10:09,115
Don't tell me he's here to break up with me.

166
00:10:12,525 --> 00:10:16,295
- Why aren't you wearing a jacket? - What are you doing here?

167
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,225
Come here.

168
00:10:21,225 --> 00:10:25,765
I have my father's permission. Now, even Ji Hyuk can't object.

169
00:10:27,035 --> 00:10:28,035
Really?

170
00:10:28,575 --> 00:10:30,675
Is your father okay with us seeing each other?

171
00:10:31,175 --> 00:10:32,175
Yes!

172
00:10:34,775 --> 00:10:36,315
What about your mother?

173
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,545
If my dad says it's okay,

174
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,455
no one can change his mind.

175
00:10:42,985 --> 00:10:45,855
- We can really be together now? - Yes.

176
00:10:45,925 --> 00:10:47,955
You should have called me first, then.

177
00:10:48,555 --> 00:10:50,595
I wanted to tell you in person.

178
00:10:51,895 --> 00:10:53,425
You've been worried sick, haven't you?

179
00:10:54,965 --> 00:10:56,335
I was on pins and needles.

180
00:10:57,195 --> 00:10:58,665
I bet you haven't been eating properly either.

181
00:10:59,205 --> 00:11:00,705
Do you want to go get something good to eat?

182
00:11:01,435 --> 00:11:02,435
This late at night?

183
00:11:03,335 --> 00:11:04,435
Oh, then...

184
00:11:04,935 --> 00:11:06,445
How about we go grab a beer?

185
00:11:06,745 --> 00:11:07,905
But I'm dressed like this...

186
00:11:09,145 --> 00:11:12,115
What? When did I put on your coat?

187
00:11:13,115 --> 00:11:17,085
- Hey, I put it on you earlier. - You must be cold. Come in here.

188
00:11:19,485 --> 00:11:20,855
I'm not cold at all.

189
00:11:21,385 --> 00:11:23,795
I'm on such a high right now, and I feel really warm.

190
00:11:25,925 --> 00:11:28,025
How about a little walk?

191
00:11:28,565 --> 00:11:32,605
No, we can't. It's too late, and you'll catch a cold.

192
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:44,445
You're home late.

193
00:11:47,585 --> 00:11:48,585
Yes.

194
00:11:49,755 --> 00:11:50,755
Good night.

195
00:11:55,795 --> 00:11:57,695
If you were Seong Jae's mother,

196
00:11:58,355 --> 00:11:59,895
you wouldn't have laid a hand...

197
00:12:00,525 --> 00:12:02,535
on the woman your son loves.

198
00:12:07,735 --> 00:12:09,875
It seems she hasn't told him we met.

199
00:12:10,805 --> 00:12:12,475
Did she actually get my message?

200
00:12:14,345 --> 00:12:19,185
So instead of making waves, she'll just see him secretly.

201
00:12:20,185 --> 00:12:22,485
She's really something else.

202
00:12:26,385 --> 00:12:27,425
Honey.

203
00:12:28,385 --> 00:12:31,095
About that girl Seong Jae is seeing...

204
00:12:31,395 --> 00:12:33,895
Oh, her. I told him to go ahead and date her.

205
00:12:36,565 --> 00:12:37,665
You gave him your permission?

206
00:12:38,905 --> 00:12:39,905
Why?

207
00:12:40,505 --> 00:12:44,235
He was so defiant, I was worried he'd just run off if I pushed it.

208
00:12:44,935 --> 00:12:46,375
I just told him to see how dating goes.

209
00:12:48,245 --> 00:12:49,375
This is driving me crazy.

210
00:12:50,215 --> 00:12:53,045
Park Jin Seok, why are you giving in all of a sudden?

211
00:12:54,015 --> 00:12:56,015
Why? Is something wrong with her?

212
00:12:57,385 --> 00:12:58,585
No, it's nothing.

213
00:12:59,455 --> 00:13:02,625
Now that you've let him date her,

214
00:13:02,895 --> 00:13:04,525
I'm debating whether or not to tell you something...

215
00:13:05,995 --> 00:13:07,925
No, I have to tell you.

216
00:13:08,965 --> 00:13:11,535
The thing is, I met that young lady.

217
00:13:12,765 --> 00:13:13,765
You did?

218
00:13:14,065 --> 00:13:16,675
I looked into her, and her family's a total disaster.

219
00:13:17,805 --> 00:13:20,205
Her dad's jobless. Her mom's a clerk,

220
00:13:20,205 --> 00:13:21,675
and her brothers are no better.

221
00:13:22,175 --> 00:13:24,275
And she's a YouTuber.

222
00:13:25,845 --> 00:13:28,285
Gosh, I knew it.

223
00:13:30,155 --> 00:13:33,155
So I tried to end things on my own. I spoke to her nicely about it.

224
00:13:34,225 --> 00:13:37,595
But she clammed up. And she hasn't told Seong Jae.

225
00:13:39,095 --> 00:13:41,625
She didn't tell Seong Jae that she met with you?

226
00:13:43,565 --> 00:13:44,895
She didn't tell him.

227
00:13:45,535 --> 00:13:47,505
So you can't tell Seong Jae either.

228
00:13:51,035 --> 00:13:53,345
Why do you think she didn't tell him?

229
00:13:54,745 --> 00:13:56,575
That girl knows what she's doing.

230
00:13:59,115 --> 00:14:00,945
So she's got some nerve.

231
00:14:03,155 --> 00:14:07,055
She's playing dumb to keep seeing him without making a scene.

232
00:14:07,855 --> 00:14:10,055
And on top of that, you gave him your permission.

233
00:14:10,425 --> 00:14:12,565
My heart just sank.

234
00:14:13,995 --> 00:14:16,165
You should've talked to me before you met with her.

235
00:14:16,995 --> 00:14:20,505
Did you discuss it with me before letting Seong Jae date her?

236
00:14:21,105 --> 00:14:23,635
- That's... - Forget it.

237
00:14:25,175 --> 00:14:26,875
Fine.

238
00:14:27,605 --> 00:14:29,145
Since I'm the stepmom,

239
00:14:30,575 --> 00:14:34,185
I wanted to do something for Seong Jae behind your back.

240
00:14:34,945 --> 00:14:36,555
And because I'm the stepmom,

241
00:14:37,015 --> 00:14:40,685
you probably figured you didn't need to discuss his love life with me.

242
00:14:42,025 --> 00:14:44,255
Come on, that's not it.

243
00:14:44,855 --> 00:14:46,495
From my perspective, after meeting that girl,

244
00:14:46,825 --> 00:14:49,335
I thought you'd need to step in, but...

245
00:14:49,735 --> 00:14:51,695
I guess that's not necessary anymore.

246
00:14:53,135 --> 00:14:56,805
If you've given your blessing, then the ship has sailed.

247
00:14:58,845 --> 00:15:00,105
No, we can't let that happen.

248
00:15:00,705 --> 00:15:01,875
Whatever.

249
00:15:02,345 --> 00:15:05,645
If you're worried about his future, you can deal with it yourself.

250
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,925
Su Bin, I got home safe.

251
00:15:15,955 --> 00:15:17,195
You're not catching a cold, are you?

252
00:15:18,495 --> 00:15:21,025
It takes more than that for me to catch a cold.

253
00:15:21,025 --> 00:15:23,935
(It takes more than that for me to catch a cold.)

254
00:15:24,135 --> 00:15:25,865
That's reassuring.

255
00:15:25,935 --> 00:15:28,835
(That's reassuring.)

256
00:15:29,005 --> 00:15:31,535
I'll always be here for you. Now, get some sleep.

257
00:15:31,935 --> 00:15:33,675
You haven't been sleeping well, have you?

258
00:15:33,745 --> 00:15:34,875
(You haven't been sleeping well, have you?)

259
00:15:35,275 --> 00:15:38,275
You too. Sleep tight, and don't even dream.

260

261
00:15:40,985 --> 00:15:41,985
I love you.

263
00:15:44,285 --> 00:15:47,985
(I love you.)

264
00:15:49,895 --> 00:15:51,695
Okay, I'll talk to you tomorrow.

265
00:15:51,755 --> 00:15:53,325
(Okay, I'll talk to you tomorrow.)

266
00:16:08,945 --> 00:16:09,945
Dad.

267
00:16:10,475 --> 00:16:13,745
How did you two first meet? Just tell me that much.

268
00:16:14,085 --> 00:16:16,415
Seriously, I was so curious I couldn't even sleep.

269
00:16:17,115 --> 00:16:18,685
Ask her yourself.

270
00:16:19,355 --> 00:16:23,755
No, Dad, you know how much I like Eun Oh.

271
00:16:24,495 --> 00:16:27,865
So what you told her about me is really important!

272
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,035
I'm sure it's important to you.

273
00:16:30,465 --> 00:16:32,805
Dad. I'm your son!

274
00:16:33,365 --> 00:16:36,105
Hey! Can't you see I'm busy trying to make breakfast here?

275
00:16:36,175 --> 00:16:37,435
Now, hurry up and get to work.

276
00:16:37,835 --> 00:16:39,445
You're unbelievable.

277
00:16:39,975 --> 00:16:42,175
Mom, is Dad always like this?

278
00:16:43,445 --> 00:16:45,115
He's always had a mean streak.

279
00:16:46,315 --> 00:16:49,955
You must have had it rough, Mom. Anyway, I'm heading out.

280
00:16:53,325 --> 00:16:55,825
You seem to enjoy teasing Ji Hyuk.

281
00:16:56,155 --> 00:16:58,155
Yes. It's a lot of fun.

282
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,625
After all, the universe hasn't abandoned me.

283
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:03,065
For the first time in my life, I'm holding all the cards, honey.

284
00:17:08,435 --> 00:17:10,075
Oh, you're early today.

285
00:17:11,505 --> 00:17:16,245
Eun Oh, just tell me one thing. How did you and my father meet?

286
00:17:16,845 --> 00:17:18,815
Didn't your father tell you?

287
00:17:19,815 --> 00:17:21,745
No, he said I should hear it from you.

288
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:25,885
It's my private life, so I'd rather not say.

289
00:17:26,285 --> 00:17:30,155
Come on, we're talking about my father here.

290
00:17:30,995 --> 00:17:33,025
But he's also my friend.

291
00:17:33,365 --> 00:17:36,035
Why do I have to tell my CEO about my personal friendships?

292
00:17:42,205 --> 00:17:44,075
Seriously, why are they both doing this to me?

293
00:17:44,405 --> 00:17:46,075
Are they trying to drive me crazy with curiosity?

294
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:47,905
Gosh, I'm seriously going to lose my mind.

295
00:17:49,475 --> 00:17:50,475
Goodness.

296
00:17:53,185 --> 00:17:56,715
Mr. Lee keeps asking me where we first met.

297
00:17:57,415 --> 00:17:58,685
Didn't you tell him?

298
00:18:00,855 --> 00:18:02,955
I didn't, just to get on his nerves.

299
00:18:06,765 --> 00:18:07,965
(Mr. Early)

300
00:18:07,965 --> 00:18:10,735
So, should I keep it from him too?

301
00:18:13,035 --> 00:18:14,305
No, go ahead and tell him.

302
00:18:14,705 --> 00:18:16,405
He can't stand being left in the dark.

303
00:18:21,305 --> 00:18:22,315
That's for sure.

304
00:18:34,055 --> 00:18:37,295
I'm going to be swamped all day, so I won't be able to get in touch.

305
00:18:37,955 --> 00:18:41,395
Me too. I'm planning a new project, so I'm going to be busy all day.

306
00:18:45,465 --> 00:18:46,705
She wants me to focus on work.

307
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,175
So she's pretending to be busy, too.

(Your email has been sent.)

310
00:18:57,345 --> 00:18:59,345
Ji Wan, I just sent in Episode 58.

311
00:18:59,685 --> 00:19:01,545
Hey, you were supposed to show me that first!

312
00:19:02,085 --> 00:19:03,555
But you already know the whole plot.

313
00:19:04,215 --> 00:19:07,055
The fans have been waiting so long, I felt rushed.

314
00:19:07,455 --> 00:19:08,725
Just read it on Neiro like everyone else.

315
00:19:09,655 --> 00:19:11,425
You really care about your fans.

316
00:19:17,835 --> 00:19:19,605
Any word from Director Ko?

317
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:22,605
Since you submitted your resignation,

318
00:19:23,235 --> 00:19:24,935
I think the misunderstanding has cleared up on its own.

319
00:19:25,775 --> 00:19:26,975
What misunderstanding?

320
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,475
Hey, who kisses like that?

321
00:19:31,075 --> 00:19:33,645
Then you both lean in at the same time.

322
00:19:34,345 --> 00:19:35,485
What do you two think you're doing?

323
00:19:40,185 --> 00:19:41,185
Oh, that...

324
00:19:53,965 --> 00:19:56,505
Well... Should we check the comments?

325
00:20:00,845 --> 00:20:03,775
Wow, it's already flooded with comments!

326
00:20:05,015 --> 00:20:08,385
Dokgo Chan's so alpha male. I bet Freedom is a man.

327
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:13,285
A man can't draw a guy that hot. I bet it's a woman.

330
00:20:21,195 --> 00:20:22,295
You're only just realising that now?

331
00:20:22,835 --> 00:20:25,265
People have been wondering about the writer since Episode Three.

332
00:20:27,005 --> 00:20:29,135
What good will their curiosity do?

333
00:20:29,135 --> 00:20:31,035
The writer, Freedom, will just vanish.

334
00:20:32,445 --> 00:20:34,875
- Why? - Because when I quit,

335
00:20:36,245 --> 00:20:38,515

00:21:00,865 --> 00:21:01,865
And why would I do that?

341
00:21:02,975 --> 00:21:05,405
- What? - Why would I give my story to you?

342
00:21:05,705 --> 00:21:08,145
A professional has to write it for people to actually read it.

343
00:21:08,675 --> 00:21:11,375
- I'll be a full-time artist. - Really?

344
00:21:11,675 --> 00:21:13,685
Can you get the Chairman's approval?

345

But he's so scary.

346
00:21:19,085 --> 00:21:21,225
If you get his permission, I'll give it to you.

347
00:21:23,025 --> 00:21:25,865
I'm going to be a full-time artist with or without his permission.

348
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,095
Go on, then.

352
00:21:51,415 --> 00:21:54,225
With this, your mom won't be able to track you.

353
00:21:55,585 --> 00:21:57,255
About the bankbook and the seal,

354
00:21:57,525 --> 00:22:00,465
I'll send them with your belongings to Yeong In's guesthouse in Busan.

355
00:22:06,805 --> 00:22:08,465
If it hadn't been for you, Woo Jin,

356
00:22:09,275 --> 00:22:11,335
I never would have gone through with the liver transplant.

357
00:22:12,745 --> 00:22:15,305
I did it for you, because you're my friend.

358
00:22:18,315 --> 00:22:21,715
And if I hadn't, I never would've gotten this money.

359
00:22:22,515 --> 00:22:23,755
So basically,

360
00:22:24,785 --> 00:22:26,855
this is just a windfall for me.

361
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:34,395
Well...

362
00:22:35,325 --> 00:22:37,295
If you insist on paying me back someday,

363
00:22:37,865 --> 00:22:39,065
I won't say no.

364
00:22:41,665 --> 00:22:42,705
I'll pay you back.

365
00:22:47,805 --> 00:22:49,315
And thank you. I really mean it.

366
00:22:50,675 --> 00:22:52,045
You've got this, right?

367
00:22:53,645 --> 00:22:54,715
Yes.

368
00:22:57,155 --> 00:22:58,585
You've got this too, right?

369
00:23:00,085 --> 00:23:01,085
Hey.

370
00:23:01,355 --> 00:23:03,725
I'm the architect of this whole plan.

371
00:23:08,695 --> 00:23:10,035
But I'm your big brother.

372
00:23:14,135 --> 00:23:15,865
I couldn't protect you before,

373
00:23:17,635 --> 00:23:19,205
and now I'm the one who needs your help.

374
00:23:21,845 --> 00:23:22,915
Han Woo Jin.

375
00:23:23,745 --> 00:23:25,615
We agreed we wouldn't do this.

376
00:23:26,185 --> 00:23:29,145
I told you. Just forget that we're twins.

377
00:23:30,185 --> 00:23:31,515
For us,

378
00:23:32,485 --> 00:23:34,955
the moment we acknowledge we're related by blood,

379
00:23:35,825 --> 00:23:38,095
it'll be hard to escape her shadow.

380
00:23:41,525 --> 00:23:42,525
Still...

381
00:23:43,535 --> 00:23:44,965
I'm Ji Eun Oh.

382
00:23:46,105 --> 00:23:47,205
You're Han Woo Jin.

383
00:23:48,205 --> 00:23:49,735
We're just friends.

384
00:23:50,905 --> 00:23:52,075
There is no Han Yu Ra.

385
00:23:56,715 --> 00:23:58,845
Okay. Let's do that.

386
00:24:06,955 --> 00:24:07,955
Woo Jin.

387
00:24:11,225 --> 00:24:12,795
You have company.

388
00:24:13,825 --> 00:24:16,665
Hi. I'm Woo Jin's little sister.

389
00:24:18,895 --> 00:24:21,265
Hi. Nice to meet you.

390
00:24:22,205 --> 00:24:23,235
Is she your girlfriend?

391
00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:26,575
No, we're just friends.

392
00:24:28,405 --> 00:24:29,675
She's a friend from high school.

393
00:24:33,345 --> 00:24:34,745
I should get going.

394
00:24:36,355 --> 00:24:40,085
- Are you leaving because of me? - No, I was about to leave anyway.

395
00:24:40,755 --> 00:24:42,025
But wait,

396
00:24:42,555 --> 00:24:46,695
I've never met Woo Jin's friends. What do you do for a living?

397
00:24:46,765 --> 00:24:47,865
Are you married?

398
00:24:50,565 --> 00:24:52,265
Does she look married to you?

399
00:24:52,835 --> 00:24:55,765
Considering your age, I was just curious.

400
00:24:57,075 --> 00:24:58,835
So, what is it that you do?

401
00:25:00,045 --> 00:25:01,545
I'm an interior designer.

402
00:25:02,005 --> 00:25:03,475
Really?

403
00:25:03,475 --> 00:25:06,685
I've been worried about the interior for my new studio.

404
00:25:07,515 --> 00:25:09,045
Could I get your business card?

405
00:25:11,115 --> 00:25:13,255
I wonder if I brought my card case.

406
00:25:14,825 --> 00:25:17,895
Or just tell me your company's name. And your phone number.

407
00:25:18,295 --> 00:25:21,295
Yeong Ra, are you redoing your art studio?

408
00:25:21,825 --> 00:25:24,195
Not my art studio. I got a new workspace.

409
00:25:26,665 --> 00:25:27,865
I have my business card.

410
00:25:28,365 --> 00:25:29,375
Here you go.

411
00:25:29,835 --> 00:25:31,105
Thank you.

412
00:25:31,475 --> 00:25:32,505
All right, then.

413
00:25:33,305 --> 00:25:34,405
I'll get going.

414
00:25:35,005 --> 00:25:36,075
Okay.

415
00:25:41,045 --> 00:25:43,355
You should have at least called to see if Mom was here.

416
00:25:43,985 --> 00:25:45,015
It's okay now.

417
00:25:46,555 --> 00:25:49,155
Here. Some bread. You can eat this now, right?

418
00:25:51,195 --> 00:25:52,195
Yes.

419
00:25:52,555 --> 00:25:55,995
- What do you do in here all day? - Well...

420
00:25:58,095 --> 00:26:01,635
I've been reading webtoons. You got me hooked, Yeong Ra.

421
00:26:02,005 --> 00:26:05,405
That webtoon you recommended. It's amazing.

422
00:26:05,405 --> 00:26:06,475
Really?

423
00:26:06,475 --> 00:26:09,915
A new episode came out today. I read it as soon as I woke up.

424
00:26:10,515 --> 00:26:11,875
That author...

425
00:26:12,475 --> 00:26:14,385
has such an incredible imagination,

426
00:26:14,815 --> 00:26:19,085
blending drama and romance so well. It's a fantastic read.

427
00:26:21,085 --> 00:26:23,295
- Is it really that good? - Totally.

428
00:26:23,825 --> 00:26:26,225
I'm so curious about the writer.

429
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:36,935
What's wrong? What is it, Yeong Ra?

430
00:26:38,235 --> 00:26:39,335
Are you not feeling well?

431
00:26:41,575 --> 00:26:44,275
Woo Jin. The truth is, I drew it.

432
00:26:44,615 --> 00:26:45,715
I'm the author.

433
00:26:47,645 --> 00:26:49,145
What? You wrote it?

434
00:26:50,685 --> 00:26:51,785
Hard to believe, isn't it?

435
00:27:00,895 --> 00:27:02,265
Woo Jin, what's wrong?

436
00:27:03,065 --> 00:27:04,395
That webtoon...

437
00:27:07,205 --> 00:27:08,665
You worked on it behind Mom's back?

438
00:27:14,145 --> 00:27:15,945
It must have been so hard on you.

439
00:27:20,045 --> 00:27:21,045
Yes.

440
00:27:25,985 --> 00:27:27,155
Yeong Ra.

441
00:27:29,555 --> 00:27:30,855
Come here. Let me give you a hug.

442
00:27:37,935 --> 00:27:39,265
All this time,

443
00:27:41,305 --> 00:27:44,005
I never even knew how to be a proper older brother to you.

444
00:27:46,205 --> 00:27:47,405
It's okay.

445
00:27:48,205 --> 00:27:50,045
I know why you've been the way you are.

446
00:27:57,355 --> 00:27:59,585
You have a real talent for making webtoons.

447
00:28:02,485 --> 00:28:05,025
But I don't have the courage to tell you to pursue it.

448
00:28:09,265 --> 00:28:10,535
I know that too.

449
00:28:19,235 --> 00:28:20,905
But I will tell you this.

450
00:28:21,505 --> 00:28:23,845
At some point, there are choices to be made.

451
00:28:25,045 --> 00:28:26,745
There comes a time when you have to decide.

452
00:28:26,945 --> 00:28:28,215
And...

453
00:28:29,315 --> 00:28:31,315
that's a decision only you can make.

454
00:28:34,985 --> 00:28:35,985
Okay?

455
00:28:39,255 --> 00:28:40,265
Yes.

456
00:28:47,835 --> 00:28:50,575
A strong start is important,

457
00:28:50,635 --> 00:28:53,175
so let's aim to finish 3 to 5 pieces first,

458
00:28:53,245 --> 00:28:55,775
and then we can arrange them in the showroom.

459
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:57,145
Okay, sure.

460
00:29:02,385 --> 00:29:04,385
You two have been working way too hard lately.

461
00:29:06,355 --> 00:29:08,255
You've still got a long meeting ahead of you.

462
00:29:08,725 --> 00:29:09,755
Thanks.

463
00:29:14,895 --> 00:29:15,995
Ms. Ji.

464
00:29:17,895 --> 00:29:18,895
Thanks.

465
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:29,145
You have one too, Cheol Min.

466
00:29:32,245 --> 00:29:34,745
My head was full of questions that I couldn't sleep.

467
00:29:36,815 --> 00:29:37,815
Let's get back to work.

468
00:29:44,555 --> 00:29:47,825
Before this curiosity drives me mad, I need to have a drink with my dad.

469
00:29:48,865 --> 00:29:49,935
Dad.

470
00:29:56,375 --> 00:29:59,235
The son who's giving my dear Mr. Early so much grief.

471
00:30:00,575 --> 00:30:01,575
"Early?"

472
00:30:02,045 --> 00:30:04,345
- What does that mean? - Your father.

473
00:30:05,275 --> 00:30:07,485
I met him working as a labourer at the Mapo site.

474
00:30:08,715 --> 00:30:10,915
Wait, you met my dad at the construction site?

475
00:30:11,615 --> 00:30:12,615
I saw a man on the street...

476
00:30:12,615 --> 00:30:14,985
who looked like my dad for three seconds.

477
00:30:15,225 --> 00:30:17,925
And that same man showed up at the Mapo site.

478
00:30:18,625 --> 00:30:21,895
When I saw his soft hands without a single callus,

479
00:30:22,525 --> 00:30:26,565
I was reminded of my own dad after his business failed.

480
00:30:27,265 --> 00:30:28,305
That's what happened.

481
00:30:32,035 --> 00:30:35,175
Wait, I was at that site too. How did I miss him?

482
00:30:35,805 --> 00:30:39,075
He only came for one day because of class, and after that,

483
00:30:39,145 --> 00:30:42,145
we met again by chance at the corner store by the office.

484
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:44,715
And you two got friendly just like that?

485
00:30:45,255 --> 00:30:48,055
Don't expect me to spill everything about my friend.

486
00:30:50,695 --> 00:30:52,625
From now on, you should listen to your dad.

487
00:30:53,365 --> 00:30:54,625
Mr. Early...

488
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:57,435
Do you have any idea how worried he was about you?

489
00:30:58,295 --> 00:31:00,905
Wait, my dad was worried about me?

490
00:31:01,405 --> 00:31:02,405
Yes.

491
00:31:04,075 --> 00:31:05,805
Having a great dad like that...

492
00:31:06,775 --> 00:31:07,875
I'm jealous, Ji Hyuk.

493
00:31:13,045 --> 00:31:16,915
(Apfel Kitchen)

494
00:31:19,055 --> 00:31:21,655
My dad was telling a stranger he was worried about me?

495
00:31:30,795 --> 00:31:33,965
I'm going to be swamped all day, so I won't be able to get in touch.

496
00:31:34,835 --> 00:31:38,535
Me too. I'm planning a new project, so I'm going to be busy all day.

497
00:31:41,745 --> 00:31:43,245
I know I said I'd be busy today,

498
00:31:44,215 --> 00:31:46,275
but she really hasn't texted me all day.

499
00:31:51,815 --> 00:31:53,425
Wow, these bean sprouts look nice and fresh.

500
00:31:55,655 --> 00:31:57,355
What? Who's here?

501
00:32:03,995 --> 00:32:07,235
Hey, Seong Jae! What a surprise. What brings you here?

502
00:32:07,505 --> 00:32:09,435
I was just visiting one of our franchise locations nearby.

503
00:32:10,105 --> 00:32:12,775
- The fruit next door looked great. - Really?

504
00:32:12,835 --> 00:32:15,245
Father. You're wearing an apron?

505
00:32:15,745 --> 00:32:18,715
Seong Jae. I'm the head cook around here now.

506
00:32:19,175 --> 00:32:20,185
What?

507
00:32:20,245 --> 00:32:23,715
Everyone else in my family works, and I felt bad just sitting around,

508
00:32:24,055 --> 00:32:25,415
so I'm running the kitchen now.

509
00:32:27,025 --> 00:32:28,825
Wow, that's really impressive.

510
00:32:29,185 --> 00:32:31,595
They say there are two types of men after retirement.

511
00:32:31,995 --> 00:32:34,265
The ones who cook, and the ones who get served.

512
00:32:34,695 --> 00:32:36,895
It's not that big of a deal.

513
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:41,165
- So what are you making today? - Some spicy braised monkfish.

514
00:32:41,665 --> 00:32:45,475
My wife always has spicy dishes like pork or squid stir-fry ready.

515
00:32:45,975 --> 00:32:49,405
But she and Su Bin love spicy braised monkfish.

516
00:32:50,275 --> 00:32:51,275
I know.

517
00:32:53,215 --> 00:32:55,345
So Mother likes spicy braised monkfish?

518
00:32:56,445 --> 00:32:58,085
- Let me help you with that. - What?

519
00:32:58,085 --> 00:32:59,955
- I'll just go wash my hands. - Okay.

520
00:33:04,425 --> 00:33:08,225
This monkfish looks way grosser than I expected.

521
00:33:10,495 --> 00:33:12,265
- I'll wash it. - What?

522
00:33:13,095 --> 00:33:15,065
- Hey, hold on. - There we go.

523
00:33:15,135 --> 00:33:16,975
You've never done this before, have you?

524
00:33:18,305 --> 00:33:19,335
My goodness.

525
00:33:26,175 --> 00:33:27,185
Oh, boy.

526
00:33:29,515 --> 00:33:30,515
Four.

527
00:33:32,415 --> 00:33:34,285
Five. Okay, that's enough soy sauce. What's next?

528
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:38,525
- Three spoonfuls of minced garlic. - Three spoonfuls of minced garlic.

529
00:33:39,055 --> 00:33:42,095
- My, that smells good. - Okay, put it on top.

530
00:33:42,165 --> 00:33:43,735
- Okay. - Go on, put it in.

531
00:33:44,535 --> 00:33:45,865
Okay. That's enough.

532
00:33:51,135 --> 00:33:52,135
Oh, my!

533
00:33:52,935 --> 00:33:54,305
This is really good.

534
00:33:54,305 --> 00:33:55,945
Really? Let me try.

535
00:34:01,315 --> 00:34:02,685
Hey, this isn't half bad.

536
00:34:03,185 --> 00:34:04,855
Hey, look at us. We made spicy braised monkfish!

537
00:34:05,155 --> 00:34:07,055
You know, with a dish like this...

538
00:34:07,525 --> 00:34:10,125
- You've got to have soju. - You know it!

539
00:34:11,055 --> 00:34:13,695
Will you look at this guy? He knows how to respect his elders.

540
00:34:14,025 --> 00:34:15,865
He can't stand an empty glass, this guy.

541
00:34:17,465 --> 00:34:20,305
I'm not trying to be attentive. An empty glass is just hard to miss.

542
00:34:20,365 --> 00:34:21,505
- Is that right? - Really?

543
00:34:21,505 --> 00:34:24,305
Park Seong Jae. What is going on here now?

544
00:34:24,605 --> 00:34:26,435
Hey, Ji Hyuk. Have you eaten?

545
00:34:26,775 --> 00:34:30,545
Hey! Lee Ji Hyuk! That was the wrong answer.

546
00:34:30,915 --> 00:34:34,385
You should learn from Seong Jae. He asked if you'd eaten right away.

547
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:36,755
You're just so thoughtful.

548
00:34:39,185 --> 00:34:41,255
Wait, Mom, have you been drinking soju, too?

549
00:34:41,485 --> 00:34:44,325
No, I'm having wine.

550
00:34:45,395 --> 00:34:49,225
Seong Jae knew I can't drink soju, so he brought this wine just for me.

551
00:34:49,795 --> 00:34:50,935
Right, so what is this?

552
00:34:51,295 --> 00:34:54,005
Seong Jae, I'm asking you what you're doing sitting there.

553
00:34:54,065 --> 00:34:57,975
Hey! Didn't you hear your mother? Are you being deliberately dense?

554
00:34:58,375 --> 00:35:01,405
This is hardly the first time Seong Jae has been over for dinner.

555
00:35:01,705 --> 00:35:04,775
Why do you have to be so harsh? Seong Jae is like family.

556
00:35:05,275 --> 00:35:08,185
It's all right, Father. Ji Hyuk's just a little rough.

557
00:35:08,615 --> 00:35:10,485
So anyway, Ji Hyuk, have you eaten?

558
00:35:11,585 --> 00:35:12,815
Yes, I have. So what?

559
00:35:13,255 --> 00:35:14,685
Fine. Go wash up and get some rest.

560
00:35:15,955 --> 00:35:18,455
Gosh, what do I do? I can't just go to my room now.

561
00:35:21,025 --> 00:35:24,695
You know what? I'll have a glass of wine, too.

562
00:35:26,735 --> 00:35:28,935
- I'm home. - Hey.

563
00:35:29,005 --> 00:35:31,775
Look who it is. My little sister's home.

564
00:35:33,305 --> 00:35:34,545
Seong Jae. You're here.

565
00:35:37,375 --> 00:35:40,085
My gosh, what's all this? What's the special occasion?

566
00:35:40,685 --> 00:35:41,915
Su Bin, have you eaten yet?

567
00:35:42,385 --> 00:35:43,815
We saved some spicy braised monkfish for you.

568
00:35:44,615 --> 00:35:47,985
- No, Seong Jae, I'll get it. - No, please.

569
00:35:48,255 --> 00:35:50,555
Tonight's guys' night in the kitchen remember?

570
00:35:55,595 --> 00:35:57,895
That jerk, Seong Jae. Where did he pick up that charm?

571
00:36:02,905 --> 00:36:03,905
You two planned this, didn't you?

572
00:36:04,405 --> 00:36:07,505
No, we didn't. I'm serious. I had no idea.

573
00:36:10,515 --> 00:36:11,975
All right.

574
00:36:13,215 --> 00:36:14,215
Here you go.

575
00:36:16,955 --> 00:36:18,785
Your dad and I made this together.

576
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:21,555
Dad and Seong Jae made spicy braised monkfish together?

577
00:36:22,025 --> 00:36:25,325
I know, right? They made this with fresh monkfish.

578
00:36:26,055 --> 00:36:27,225
Can you believe it?

579
00:36:27,595 --> 00:36:29,365
They even made steamed eggs with pollock roe.

580
00:36:30,465 --> 00:36:33,905
Steamed eggs with pollock roe, Su Bin's favourite. She'll love it.

581
00:36:34,505 --> 00:36:36,735
Su Bin likes steamed eggs with pollock roe?

582
00:36:37,235 --> 00:36:38,705
You didn't even know that, did you?

583
00:36:42,175 --> 00:36:43,915
- This is delicious! - Yes.

584
00:36:49,545 --> 00:36:50,555
It's so good.

585
00:36:54,055 --> 00:36:55,755
Park Seong Jae.

586
00:36:56,525 --> 00:36:58,025
What do you think you're doing?

587
00:36:58,955 --> 00:37:01,365
What were you thinking, coming to my house?

588
00:37:02,065 --> 00:37:04,295
What? Am I not allowed to be here?

589
00:37:04,765 --> 00:37:07,865
You didn't come as my friend, right? You're here as Su Bin's boyfriend.

590
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:09,435
I...

591
00:37:10,205 --> 00:37:12,575
I got my father's permission to date her.

592
00:37:14,005 --> 00:37:17,075
What? You got permission from the Chairman?

593
00:37:17,415 --> 00:37:18,415
I did, man.

594
00:37:20,045 --> 00:37:24,215
Still, being here is out of line. This place is off-limits to you.

595
00:37:24,285 --> 00:37:25,785
You never should have come.

596
00:37:26,685 --> 00:37:28,455
You sure have a nasty way of putting things.

597
00:37:29,325 --> 00:37:31,595
Besides, why is it any of your business?

598
00:37:31,995 --> 00:37:33,125
Really?

599
00:37:33,565 --> 00:37:35,365
Fine, let's go ask my parents then.

600
00:37:35,425 --> 00:37:37,395
Hey! Come on, Ji Hyuk.

601
00:37:37,795 --> 00:37:39,495
See? This is what I'm talking about!

602
00:37:40,505 --> 00:37:42,135
This isn't getting you anywhere, Seong Jae.

603
00:37:42,705 --> 00:37:44,075
I thought you were only dating for 100 days.

604
00:37:44,805 --> 00:37:47,075
So why are you trying to get on my parents' good side?

605
00:37:47,345 --> 00:37:49,645
You should be trying to lie low for those 100 days.

606
00:37:50,975 --> 00:37:51,975
You have a point.

607
00:37:53,115 --> 00:37:54,315
What was I thinking?

608
00:37:57,185 --> 00:37:58,615
It's not about the time frame.

609
00:37:59,285 --> 00:38:01,585
I guess I wanted their blessing, too.

610
00:38:03,285 --> 00:38:04,355
You were the same way.

611
00:38:04,825 --> 00:38:06,895
You felt the same way about Eun Oh. You wished you were her husband.

612
00:38:07,765 --> 00:38:10,235
With all that Eun Oh's been through recently,

613
00:38:10,935 --> 00:38:13,965
I found myself thinking, "What if I were her husband?"

614
00:38:14,365 --> 00:38:15,735
That's exactly how I feel.

615
00:38:16,935 --> 00:38:18,375
When Su Bin needs me,

616
00:38:19,075 --> 00:38:21,775
I want to be a man who can step up and do anything for her.

617
00:38:22,945 --> 00:38:23,945
But...

618
00:38:24,515 --> 00:38:26,745
your parents are such warm people.

619
00:38:26,915 --> 00:38:29,615
I thought there was a chance they might accept me.

620
00:38:32,455 --> 00:38:33,625
I really wanted them to like me.

621
00:38:34,285 --> 00:38:35,725
Look at this guy getting his hopes up.

622
00:38:36,055 --> 00:38:40,325
Hey, your dad probably only said yes because he thinks it's just a fling.

623
00:38:40,565 --> 00:38:41,625
Don't make this more than it is.

624
00:38:42,065 --> 00:38:44,195
Because it's obvious my sister is the one who'll get hurt.

625
00:38:44,565 --> 00:38:46,835
Will you stop jumping to conclusions?

626
00:38:48,505 --> 00:38:49,505
Ji Hyuk.

627
00:38:51,935 --> 00:38:53,035
Su Bin, come on in.

628
00:38:53,505 --> 00:38:54,705
No, you can't come in here!

629
00:38:55,845 --> 00:38:57,445
Should I go to her room instead, then?

630
00:38:58,075 --> 00:38:59,075
Are you crazy?

631
00:39:06,515 --> 00:39:08,885
You two are in your own world, aren't you?

632
00:39:09,225 --> 00:39:10,925
Ji Hyuk, you promised.

633
00:39:12,655 --> 00:39:15,595
Seong Jae. Why didn't you text me you were coming?

634
00:39:16,765 --> 00:39:18,165
I thought if you found out,

635
00:39:18,735 --> 00:39:21,165
you'd just end up worrying for no reason.

636
00:39:22,835 --> 00:39:25,605
That must've been tough. I bet you've never cooked before.

637
00:39:26,435 --> 00:39:27,745
It was actually a lot of fun.

638
00:39:28,305 --> 00:39:29,605
Maybe it's because I was doing it with your dad?

639
00:39:31,345 --> 00:39:33,315
Give me a break.

640
00:39:44,195 --> 00:39:45,855
Did Seong Jae get off okay?

641
00:39:46,625 --> 00:39:48,725
Yes. He's off with the designated driver.

642
00:39:49,925 --> 00:39:51,495
What's with the attitude?

643
00:39:52,195 --> 00:39:54,265
Seriously, Mom, what is so great about Seong Jae?

644
00:39:54,535 --> 00:39:55,865
He's always been your favourite.

645
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:59,235
He's just freeloading off us. What's so great about that?

646
00:40:00,275 --> 00:40:04,115
Seong Jae never shied away from me or any other adults.

647
00:40:04,775 --> 00:40:07,285
Your friends and even your siblings' friends...

648
00:40:07,385 --> 00:40:10,045
wouldn't include me, even when I was curious and nearby.

649
00:40:10,455 --> 00:40:12,915
But Seong Jae always took the time to talk to me.

650
00:40:14,355 --> 00:40:15,355
He did?

651
00:40:15,855 --> 00:40:16,855
Of course.

652
00:40:17,395 --> 00:40:20,425
He always has. Even now, when I'm preparing a meal,

653
00:40:20,495 --> 00:40:22,725
he'll come over, hang around, and keep me company.

654
00:40:23,165 --> 00:40:24,795
Do you have any idea how much that means to me?

655
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:27,035
Really? You're thankful for that?

656
00:40:27,865 --> 00:40:31,035
You may be my son, but ever since high school,

657
00:40:31,605 --> 00:40:33,605
have we even talked for 30 minutes a week?

658
00:40:34,945 --> 00:40:37,445
I say, "Dinner's ready. Wash up,"

659
00:40:37,445 --> 00:40:39,415
and all I get is, "Yes," or "Okay."

660
00:40:40,515 --> 00:40:42,885
Come on, Mom. Thirty minutes is a huge exaggeration.

661
00:40:43,245 --> 00:40:46,515
That's how it feels. That's just how it's been.

662
00:40:47,585 --> 00:40:49,725
Say an old woman on the street asks for directions.

663
00:40:50,395 --> 00:40:55,425
If you help her, she'll pull out a melted caramel from her pocket.

664
00:40:56,025 --> 00:41:00,365
That's what it's like. The young are awkward around elders.

665
00:41:02,305 --> 00:41:05,235
So that's what older people appreciate.

666
00:41:15,385 --> 00:41:16,945
Man, that Seong Jae.

667
00:41:18,155 --> 00:41:20,925
Always trying to get brownie points. It's so annoying.

668
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:23,285
Mom already adores you as it is.

669
00:41:26,425 --> 00:41:30,365
Seong Jae never shied away from me or any other adults.

670
00:41:30,995 --> 00:41:33,065
But Seong Jae always took the time to talk to me.

671
00:41:34,035 --> 00:41:35,905
He'd come over and hang around.

672
00:41:36,365 --> 00:41:38,035
Do you have any idea how much that means to me?

673
00:41:40,875 --> 00:41:43,975
So that's what older people like.

674
00:41:46,215 --> 00:41:47,215
All right, then.

675
00:41:48,615 --> 00:41:49,985
(Urgent: Interior worker needed)

676
00:41:50,045 --> 00:41:51,855
(Urgent: Interior wallpapering assistant)

677
00:41:53,725 --> 00:41:54,785
What?

678
00:41:55,955 --> 00:41:57,655
That job site must be getting tired of you.

679
00:41:57,925 --> 00:41:59,155
You've been staring at it so much.

680
00:41:59,755 --> 00:42:02,065
Goodness, what are you talking about?

681
00:42:02,395 --> 00:42:04,265
Honey. Lee Sang Cheol.

682
00:42:05,435 --> 00:42:07,705
Please, just take one month off.

683
00:42:08,605 --> 00:42:10,335
What would I even do if I took a break?

684
00:42:11,335 --> 00:42:12,675
By the way, honey.

685
00:42:13,305 --> 00:42:14,305
By any chance,

686
00:42:14,675 --> 00:42:17,675
would you ever consider moving out to the provinces?

687
00:42:18,475 --> 00:42:19,475
Where did that come from?

688
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:22,615
Out there, even if you're over 60,

689
00:42:22,615 --> 00:42:24,515
having an electrical technician license,

690
00:42:24,815 --> 00:42:26,585
there would still be jobs available.

691
00:42:27,255 --> 00:42:28,385
Day and night, it's always about...

692
00:42:28,385 --> 00:42:30,025
that electrical technician license and finding a job.

693
00:42:30,495 --> 00:42:32,495
I told you to drop that breadwinner complex.

694
00:42:33,095 --> 00:42:37,565
What's the point? The money to live until we're 90...

695
00:42:37,635 --> 00:42:39,065
isn't just going to fall from the sky.

696
00:42:40,065 --> 00:42:41,705
I guess you're planning on living until 90?

697
00:42:42,165 --> 00:42:44,475
No, that's the problem. I'm like this because I don't know.

698
00:42:45,035 --> 00:42:48,705
Just hearing people talk about living to 100 makes my heart pound.

699
00:42:49,345 --> 00:42:51,415
That's why I'm telling you to just rest for one month.

700
00:42:51,745 --> 00:42:53,945
You might not even live to be 90.

701
00:42:54,615 --> 00:42:57,215
Have you ever taken a week off in your entire life?

702
00:42:57,755 --> 00:42:58,915
Have you ever just relaxed and had fun?

703
00:43:01,255 --> 00:43:02,255
No, I haven't.

704
00:43:03,385 --> 00:43:04,555
Exactly. You haven't.

705
00:43:05,255 --> 00:43:07,495
You've spent your whole life living for other people.

706
00:43:08,325 --> 00:43:10,995
As a father to our kids, as a husband to me,

707
00:43:11,435 --> 00:43:13,765
as a son to your parents, and a son-in-law to mine.

708
00:43:15,365 --> 00:43:16,365
So...

709
00:43:16,965 --> 00:43:18,675
Until you get a job as an electrical technician,

710
00:43:18,675 --> 00:43:19,975
stop looking for part-time work.

711
00:43:20,205 --> 00:43:21,245
Just take one month to enjoy yourself.

712
00:43:22,575 --> 00:43:23,775
For one whole month?

713
00:43:24,615 --> 00:43:25,815
What would I do with myself?

714
00:43:27,185 --> 00:43:31,455
While working, did you ever want or envy something others were doing?

715
00:43:33,085 --> 00:43:34,085
I don't know.

716
00:43:35,155 --> 00:43:36,685
Well, there were things I hated.

717
00:43:37,225 --> 00:43:39,325
Being packed like sardines during my commute,

718
00:43:39,725 --> 00:43:41,725
having to take the bus or the subway.

719
00:43:43,125 --> 00:43:45,335
Okay, so start thinking of things from there.

720
00:43:45,865 --> 00:43:48,005
For the next month, don't worry about making breakfast or dinner.

721
00:43:48,505 --> 00:43:51,105
I'll take care of my own meals, and the kids can just have ramyeon.

722
00:43:51,335 --> 00:43:52,975
But what about Ji Hyuk?

723
00:43:53,575 --> 00:43:56,045
He comes home for a real dinner every once in a while.

724
00:43:56,875 --> 00:43:59,015
Goodness. You big softie.

725
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:02,615
You completely melted the moment Ji Hyuk knelt and apologised.

726
00:44:04,215 --> 00:44:05,215
Did I?

727
00:44:05,855 --> 00:44:09,385
I can't help it. That's just how parents are.

728
00:44:10,955 --> 00:44:12,195
That whole "being a parent" thing...

729
00:44:12,755 --> 00:44:14,195
Take a break from it. Just for one month.

730
00:44:14,695 --> 00:44:16,265
Live for yourself for a change, Lee Sang Cheol.

731
00:44:20,265 --> 00:44:21,635
I'll think about it.

732
00:44:32,375 --> 00:44:33,375
Yes.

733
00:44:37,285 --> 00:44:39,155
Do you have any plans tonight?

734
00:44:39,555 --> 00:44:42,055
I'm visiting Woo Jin in the hospital today.

735
00:44:42,785 --> 00:44:43,785
Again?

736
00:44:44,555 --> 00:44:48,395
All he looks forward to in the hospital is friends visiting.

737
00:44:48,965 --> 00:44:51,965
I'd planned a team dinner tonight, but I guess that's out.

738
00:44:52,565 --> 00:44:53,565
You guys can go without me.

739
00:44:54,005 --> 00:44:56,135
Team dinners aren't mandatory anymore.

740
00:44:56,965 --> 00:44:57,975
Right.

741
00:45:04,445 --> 00:45:07,385
Team dinner tonight, everyone! How does beef sound?

742
00:45:09,945 --> 00:45:10,955
Today's...

743
00:45:12,015 --> 00:45:13,055
OOTD.

744
00:45:13,685 --> 00:45:16,485
But cooking content is a must these days.

745
00:45:20,765 --> 00:45:21,765
Who could this be?

746
00:45:23,295 --> 00:45:24,295
Hello?

747
00:45:24,995 --> 00:45:25,995
Is this Lee Su Bin?

748
00:45:26,535 --> 00:45:29,865
This is Seong Jae's father. Chairman Park Jin Seok of Shoe Joy.

749
00:45:30,905 --> 00:45:32,835
Hello, sir.

750
00:45:33,805 --> 00:45:36,045
I hear you're Seong Jae's girlfriend.

751
00:45:36,575 --> 00:45:37,875
Let's meet.

752
00:45:38,575 --> 00:45:39,575
Excuse me?

753
00:45:41,615 --> 00:45:44,585
(Vice President Park Seong Jae)

754
00:45:45,385 --> 00:45:46,385
Yes.

755
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:50,325
Sir, the buyers from Tokyo have just arrived at the airport.

756
00:45:50,725 --> 00:45:52,425
You should head to the meeting now.

757
00:45:53,965 --> 00:45:55,025
Okay, got it.

758
00:46:01,805 --> 00:46:03,165
This is Seong Jae's father.

759
00:46:05,405 --> 00:46:07,705
Gosh, even his voice is intimidating.

760
00:46:08,775 --> 00:46:10,175
Does Seong Jae know about this?

761
00:46:11,475 --> 00:46:12,975
Should I tell him?

762
00:46:22,385 --> 00:46:23,385
Hey, Seong Jae.

763
00:46:24,095 --> 00:46:25,095
What were you up to?

764
00:46:25,395 --> 00:46:28,465
What? Just putting on makeup.

765
00:46:29,325 --> 00:46:30,525
Going somewhere?

766
00:46:31,365 --> 00:46:34,435
You said nothing about going out in your text this morning.

767
00:46:35,635 --> 00:46:36,835
So he doesn't know.

768
00:46:37,905 --> 00:46:40,505
A friend from college just called me out of the blue.

769
00:46:41,345 --> 00:46:42,405
Oh, really?

770
00:46:43,045 --> 00:46:45,375
Well, I'm on my way to a meeting with some Japanese buyers.

771
00:46:45,845 --> 00:46:47,585
We'll be touring some franchise locations,

772
00:46:48,245 --> 00:46:49,645
and I'll probably have dinner with them too.

773
00:46:50,885 --> 00:46:53,185
Right, you mentioned that yesterday. I hope the meeting goes well.

774
00:46:54,055 --> 00:46:55,085
Thanks.

775
00:46:55,455 --> 00:46:57,055
Get something good to eat with your friend, okay?

776
00:46:57,655 --> 00:46:58,655
Oh, and...

777
00:46:59,795 --> 00:47:00,925
Make sure you dress warmly.

778
00:47:02,195 --> 00:47:03,195
Okay, I will.

779
00:47:10,705 --> 00:47:13,705
Why would he want to see me without Seong Jae knowing?

780
00:47:18,515 --> 00:47:20,645
I have an appointment with the Chairman at 2pm.

781
00:47:21,015 --> 00:47:22,885
With Mr. Chairman? One moment, please.

782
00:47:33,795 --> 00:47:34,795
Su Bin?

783
00:47:37,325 --> 00:47:39,035
There's no way she'd come here without contacting me.

784
00:47:41,005 --> 00:47:42,005
It can't be.

785
00:47:48,975 --> 00:47:49,975
My gosh...

786
00:47:53,175 --> 00:47:54,185
(Shoealls)

787
00:48:07,425 --> 00:48:11,095
Hello. My name is Lee Su Bin. You asked to see me.

788
00:48:12,635 --> 00:48:13,635
Have a seat.

789
00:48:14,565 --> 00:48:15,565
Yes.

790
00:48:22,645 --> 00:48:27,445
I called you here out of curiosity. Seong Jae doesn't just date anyone.

791
00:48:28,845 --> 00:48:31,215
And I can see why Seong Jae likes you.

792
00:48:32,155 --> 00:48:33,315
What is it you like about Seong Jae?

793
00:48:34,355 --> 00:48:37,385
There isn't one particular reason why I like him, but...

794
00:48:38,355 --> 00:48:39,425
He's very affectionate.

795
00:48:40,425 --> 00:48:41,425
Affectionate?

796
00:48:42,795 --> 00:48:44,665
But he also seems lonely.

797
00:48:45,195 --> 00:48:47,835
I want to be the one to fill that void for him.

798
00:48:49,205 --> 00:48:52,735
So you're with him to fill a void. I like your attitude.

799
00:48:54,035 --> 00:48:58,515
Relationships must be built on more than simple affection.

800
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:00,645
Yes.

801
00:49:00,945 --> 00:49:02,085
Even so, you're not the one.

802
00:49:03,715 --> 00:49:06,855
- Pardon? - Marriage is out of the question.

803
00:49:07,825 --> 00:49:09,685
- But we're just... - Just dating?

804
00:49:10,325 --> 00:49:12,055
Seong Jae told me.

805
00:49:14,165 --> 00:49:15,765
But when two people are in love, they naturally...

806
00:49:16,425 --> 00:49:18,735
think about a future together. That's just human nature.

807
00:49:20,235 --> 00:49:22,535
Well, apparently, that's not the case for you two,

808
00:49:22,865 --> 00:49:26,335
since Seong Jae insists you two are "just dating."

809
00:49:27,305 --> 00:49:28,445
Something's off.

810
00:49:29,205 --> 00:49:30,875
Get it together, Lee Su Bin.

811
00:49:33,145 --> 00:49:35,945
- Did you call me because... - Yes.

812
00:49:36,685 --> 00:49:39,885
You can date him casually, but it can't go any further.

813
00:49:40,255 --> 00:49:42,425
I called you here to make that perfectly clear.

814
00:49:43,225 --> 00:49:46,995
If that's what you wanted to say, you could've told him yourself, sir.

815
00:49:47,795 --> 00:49:49,865
Well... Let's call it a precaution.

816
00:49:50,725 --> 00:49:51,835
That's how I do things.

817
00:49:52,865 --> 00:49:56,005
If we cut off any chance of being stabbed in the back,

818
00:49:56,235 --> 00:49:57,835
neither of us has to waste our energy.

819
00:50:01,375 --> 00:50:03,145
The heir to a corporate group...

820
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:05,775
marries into a family that can be an asset to the company.

821
00:50:07,345 --> 00:50:10,285
A family we can turn to for help...

822
00:50:10,285 --> 00:50:13,315
when facing obstacles most people can't even imagine.

823
00:50:15,055 --> 00:50:16,055
And Seong Jae...

824
00:50:16,425 --> 00:50:18,555
is the heir to our Shoe Joy Group, is he not?

825
00:50:19,755 --> 00:50:21,665
He is not a man who can afford to just follow his heart.

826
00:50:23,425 --> 00:50:24,495
Am I making myself clear?

827
00:50:26,535 --> 00:50:28,105
I've heard what you've had to say.

828
00:50:31,735 --> 00:50:35,045
So you've heard me, but you won't agree.

829
00:50:36,345 --> 00:50:37,405
An answer like that...

830
00:50:38,475 --> 00:50:40,645
I don't feel obligated to give you that kind of answer, sir.

831
00:50:41,445 --> 00:50:42,515
What was that?

832
00:50:45,455 --> 00:50:48,725
Did Seong Jae put you up to this? Did he tell you to say that?

833
00:50:48,785 --> 00:50:51,895
No. Seong Jae doesn't know I came here.

834
00:50:54,265 --> 00:50:57,225
- You didn't tell him you came? - That's right.

835
00:50:58,395 --> 00:50:59,965
And I don't plan on telling him, either.

836
00:51:00,795 --> 00:51:01,905
And why is that?

837
00:51:04,405 --> 00:51:06,335
Because it would upset Seong Jae.

838
00:51:07,775 --> 00:51:09,645
I don't want to see him get hurt.

839
00:51:12,445 --> 00:51:15,545
Are you really saying you'll never tell Seong Jae?

840
00:51:17,715 --> 00:51:18,915
I don't plan to.

841
00:51:21,055 --> 00:51:23,055
If you're finished, I'll see myself out.

842
00:51:46,845 --> 00:51:50,885
Mom... This room just feels so empty without you.

843
00:51:53,515 --> 00:51:54,555
Mom.

844
00:51:55,485 --> 00:51:56,955
Please, try some.

845
00:51:57,625 --> 00:51:59,755
I made spicy braised monkfish.

846
00:52:02,325 --> 00:52:04,595
Mom... To think in your whole life,

847
00:52:05,335 --> 00:52:07,465
I never once cooked a meal for you.

848
00:52:08,865 --> 00:52:10,605
After a lifetime of you feeding me,

849
00:52:11,675 --> 00:52:13,735
it never even occurred to me to make a meal for you.

850
00:52:15,975 --> 00:52:17,075
And, Mom...

851
00:52:17,715 --> 00:52:21,985
Da Jeong told me to take a month off to just relax.

852
00:52:23,085 --> 00:52:25,615
It hasn't been long since you left, and I feel a little guilty, but...

853
00:52:27,155 --> 00:52:28,155
Do you think...

854
00:52:28,455 --> 00:52:31,725
I could just do the interview and then take a month off?

855
00:52:33,695 --> 00:52:35,365
(Jamun Medical Devices)

856
00:52:35,425 --> 00:52:36,425
Welcome.

857
00:52:37,365 --> 00:52:40,795
I heard your products are very good, so I came to try them out.

858
00:52:40,965 --> 00:52:42,965
I spent all day volunteering yesterday making kimchi,

859
00:52:42,965 --> 00:52:45,175
and now my whole body is sore.

860
00:52:45,775 --> 00:52:48,675
- Go ahead and lie down here. - Okay, thank you.

861
00:52:49,175 --> 00:52:50,205
Oh, boy.

862
00:52:54,445 --> 00:52:56,185
How does that feel? Are you comfortable?

863
00:52:56,815 --> 00:52:58,985
The warmth feels really nice.

864
00:52:59,415 --> 00:53:01,855
You'll feel much better once the session is over.

865
00:53:05,125 --> 00:53:09,625
It's improving my circulation. My body feels lighter already.

866
00:53:10,625 --> 00:53:13,965
Actually, I'm here because I want to start a business.

867
00:53:14,735 --> 00:53:16,435
People are living to be 100 these days,

868
00:53:16,635 --> 00:53:19,005
so it's no surprise so many people are focused on their health.

869
00:53:19,005 --> 00:53:22,245
That's why I was looking into the wellness industry,

870
00:53:22,475 --> 00:53:23,705
and now that I've tried this for myself,

871
00:53:24,045 --> 00:53:26,715
I'm thinking a business like this could be a really good fit for me.

872
00:53:27,515 --> 00:53:29,385
Would you like me to connect you with our corporate office?

873
00:53:30,315 --> 00:53:32,055
That would be wonderful. Thank you.

874
00:53:43,195 --> 00:53:45,235
He says we can date, but marriage is off the table.

875
00:53:46,135 --> 00:53:47,395
What am I supposed to do with that?

876
00:53:53,475 --> 00:53:55,705
I guess our relationship really does have a 100-day expiration date.

877
00:53:57,205 --> 00:53:59,145
I shouldn't have suggested we only date for 100 days.

878
00:54:01,985 --> 00:54:04,415
The reasons we should break up after 100 days just keep piling up.

879
00:54:08,155 --> 00:54:10,055
She said she wouldn't tell Seong Jae?

880
00:54:10,425 --> 00:54:11,495
Come on.

881
00:54:11,495 --> 00:54:13,825
That girl will tell him everything behind our backs.

882
00:54:14,055 --> 00:54:16,365
Well, if she tells him and Seong Jae comes to confront me,

883
00:54:16,965 --> 00:54:18,765
I'll just say I was nipping it in the bud.

884
00:54:19,735 --> 00:54:21,405
I'll say, "As you said,"

885
00:54:21,635 --> 00:54:24,035
"you're only dating, not getting married."

886
00:54:24,905 --> 00:54:26,875
"I met her because I was worried. That's all."

887
00:54:28,705 --> 00:54:29,805
I mean,

888
00:54:30,545 --> 00:54:32,615
it's not like I treated her harshly or anything.

889
00:54:34,745 --> 00:54:37,385
But what's with that look on your face?

890
00:54:38,055 --> 00:54:39,885
Was she disrespectful to you?

891
00:54:40,615 --> 00:54:41,625
No.

892
00:54:42,885 --> 00:54:44,655
Actually, the girl herself isn't bad at all.

893
00:54:45,525 --> 00:54:47,125
Seong Jae has good taste.

894
00:54:48,425 --> 00:54:50,265
She's a bright young woman,

895
00:54:50,925 --> 00:54:52,765
and she's fiercely protective of Seong Jae.

896
00:54:55,235 --> 00:54:58,205
What's this? So, he actually liked her?

897
00:55:01,975 --> 00:55:04,515
It's a shame her family isn't more respectable.

898
00:55:06,115 --> 00:55:07,945
Her father's unemployed,

899
00:55:08,745 --> 00:55:10,845
and you said her brothers were nobodies, right?

900
00:55:12,185 --> 00:55:14,215
Yes, that's right.

901
00:55:15,025 --> 00:55:18,125
A person's character is a reflection of their upbringing, after all.

902
00:55:19,355 --> 00:55:23,695
No matter how decent she might be, Seong Jae is the family's first son.

903
00:55:24,595 --> 00:55:26,565
She's nowhere near good enough for him.

904
00:55:27,695 --> 00:55:28,905
Of course, she isn't.

905
00:55:31,735 --> 00:55:33,875
The fact that she's a decent kid makes me even more worried.

906
00:55:35,145 --> 00:55:37,945
If they're this crazy for each other and things go wrong,

907
00:55:38,575 --> 00:55:40,175
Seong Jae could go completely off the rails.

908
00:55:44,655 --> 00:55:47,015
So we can't let this drag on for too long.

909
00:55:48,085 --> 00:55:49,885
After the end of the year, you go have a talk with her.

910
00:55:50,855 --> 00:55:52,955
She seems like the reasonable type. I'm sure she'll understand.

911
00:55:54,965 --> 00:55:57,395
Okay. I'll take care of it.

912
00:56:02,035 --> 00:56:03,605
Everything's all set over there.

913
00:56:06,805 --> 00:56:07,805
Got it.

914
00:56:09,345 --> 00:56:10,445
How are you feeling?

915
00:56:17,345 --> 00:56:18,485
I'm excited.

916
00:56:20,255 --> 00:56:21,785
The order we agreed on...

917
00:56:22,755 --> 00:56:23,885
Don't forget.

918
00:56:25,495 --> 00:56:27,725
Hey, have you forgotten how smart I am?

919
00:56:32,035 --> 00:56:34,605
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

920
00:56:38,405 --> 00:56:40,235
- Hello. - Welcome.

921
00:56:41,505 --> 00:56:43,445
- Su Jeong. - Ms. Jeong.

922
00:56:44,145 --> 00:56:45,415
It's good to see you, Mother.

923
00:56:46,615 --> 00:56:47,615
Hello.

924
00:56:47,645 --> 00:56:51,485
Su Jeong recommended a great place. I didn't realise it was your place.

925
00:56:52,055 --> 00:56:53,385
Did she?

926
00:56:54,855 --> 00:56:55,855
When did I ever say that?

927
00:56:56,755 --> 00:56:58,955
So, where should we sit?

928
00:56:59,825 --> 00:57:03,325
Hey, Gang Oh. Seat your sister's coworkers.

929
00:57:03,365 --> 00:57:04,995
- One moment. - Okay.

930
00:57:05,335 --> 00:57:07,695
- Here you go. - It's a work dinner. Where is she?

931
00:57:08,365 --> 00:57:09,835
She said she had other plans.

932
00:57:12,175 --> 00:57:13,835
Where should we sit?

933
00:57:14,775 --> 00:57:16,105
You can sit right here.

934
00:57:16,505 --> 00:57:17,605
Thanks.

935
00:57:21,915 --> 00:57:23,115
Su Jeong, here.

936
00:57:23,515 --> 00:57:24,655
Thank you.

937
00:57:25,685 --> 00:57:27,985
Here are the extra ribs you ordered.

938
00:57:28,625 --> 00:57:31,495
We keep running into each other in places we shouldn't.

939
00:57:31,855 --> 00:57:32,925
It's so obvious what you're up to.

940
00:57:35,095 --> 00:57:36,225
What are you talking about?

941
00:57:36,465 --> 00:57:37,895
That was the point. I came here to be obvious.

942
00:57:38,495 --> 00:57:40,995
You're pretty sharp. Clearly, you're Eun Oh's brother.

943
00:57:43,335 --> 00:57:44,775
Round one goes to Ji Hyuk.

944
00:57:44,835 --> 00:57:47,505
You two are a lot alike, personality-wise.

945
00:57:48,945 --> 00:57:51,375
- What? - What?

946
00:57:53,075 --> 00:57:55,485
I wanted to give you more on the house,

947
00:57:55,485 --> 00:57:57,285
but you already ordered more.

948
00:57:57,285 --> 00:57:59,385
Don't worry. We can finish it all, Mother.

949
00:57:59,455 --> 00:58:01,555
I came here specifically for your famous galbi.

950
00:58:01,825 --> 00:58:02,985
You did?

951
00:58:03,225 --> 00:58:04,695
He's a bottomless pit.

952
00:58:04,695 --> 00:58:07,095
Back in college, when we'd go on club trips,

953
00:58:07,095 --> 00:58:09,595
you'd send us some through Eun Oh, remember?

954
00:58:10,895 --> 00:58:13,535
I still haven't forgotten that taste.

955
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:17,735
That's right. He ate so much we barely got any.

956
00:58:18,375 --> 00:58:21,075
If I'd known, I would've sent more.

957
00:58:26,775 --> 00:58:29,545
Looks like you can have them whenever you want now, Mr. Lee.

958
00:58:29,545 --> 00:58:31,385
I guess I can!

959
00:58:31,615 --> 00:58:33,815
Mother, you've just found yourself a new regular.

960
00:58:34,055 --> 00:58:38,355
- My gosh. Thank you so much. - Yes. It's really delicious.

961
00:58:38,595 --> 00:58:40,295
My sister's going to get a kick out of this.

962
00:58:42,995 --> 00:58:44,295
I'm home.

963
00:58:44,795 --> 00:58:45,795
Eun Oh.

964
00:58:46,035 --> 00:58:48,135
Mom, how come you closed up so early?

965
00:58:48,535 --> 00:58:50,265
We ran out of ingredients early.

966
00:58:51,035 --> 00:58:52,705
You must be tired. It sounds like you were busy.

967
00:58:52,735 --> 00:58:56,645
Actually, your coworkers came for a work dinner today.

968
00:58:56,805 --> 00:58:58,645
You should have given me a heads-up.

969
00:58:59,175 --> 00:59:00,175
What?

970
00:59:00,515 --> 00:59:02,385
Why would they have the work dinner at our restaurant?

971
00:59:03,615 --> 00:59:06,515
I told them I couldn't make it because I had to visit Woo Jin.

972
00:59:06,985 --> 00:59:09,385
Su Jeong recommended our restaurant, apparently.

973
00:59:10,625 --> 00:59:12,125
Su Jeong did?

974
00:59:13,495 --> 00:59:15,995
Recommended it? Don't be silly. When the CEO tells his staff to go,

975
00:59:15,995 --> 00:59:18,635
they have no choice but to follow along.

976
00:59:19,195 --> 00:59:21,865
That CEO really ran up the bill before he left.

977
00:59:23,365 --> 00:59:24,565
He did?

978
00:59:32,975 --> 00:59:34,345
Being so on edge,

979
00:59:35,315 --> 00:59:38,115
I guess I ate way too much. I feel sick to my stomach.

980
00:59:46,425 --> 00:59:48,865
It's a good thing I won you over back then.

981
00:59:48,865 --> 00:59:50,925
Where would I be if I hadn't married you?

982
00:59:51,195 --> 00:59:54,295
What are you talking about? You were just blinded by love.

983
00:59:54,365 --> 00:59:55,705
So I'm the one who lucked out.

984
00:59:56,535 --> 00:59:57,665
Oh, please...

985
00:59:58,505 --> 01:00:00,175
Yeong Ra, what's up?

986
01:00:01,575 --> 01:00:05,575
I was just coming down for some tea. You just look so happy, Dad.

987
01:00:07,045 --> 01:00:08,145
I do?

988
01:00:08,845 --> 01:00:10,715
Come on, sit down. Have some tea with us.

989
01:00:10,915 --> 01:00:15,085
Oh, no. I wanted it to be just the two of us.

990
01:00:15,125 --> 01:00:18,225
What, are you jealous of our daughter?

991
01:00:18,425 --> 01:00:21,765
Yes. Because you're my number one.

992
01:00:30,465 --> 01:00:32,635
I'm the architect of this whole plan.

993
01:00:35,575 --> 01:00:36,675
But I'm your big brother.

994
01:00:37,075 --> 01:00:38,745
Does he have a girlfriend?

995
01:00:39,345 --> 01:00:41,075
I couldn't protect you before,

996
01:00:42,745 --> 01:00:44,415
and now I'm the one who needs your help.

997
01:00:45,715 --> 01:00:46,715
Han Woo Jin.

998
01:00:47,485 --> 01:00:49,385
We agreed we wouldn't do this.

999
01:00:49,925 --> 01:00:52,655
I told you. Just forget that we're twins.

1000
01:00:53,225 --> 01:00:54,325
For us,

1001
01:00:55,195 --> 01:00:57,625
the moment we acknowledge we're related by blood,

1002
01:00:57,925 --> 01:01:00,395
it'll be hard to escape her shadow.

1003
01:01:01,095 --> 01:01:02,265
Twins?

1004
01:01:04,465 --> 01:01:06,405
So it turns out she had a twin daughter, too.

1005
01:01:08,035 --> 01:01:09,405
Poor Dad.

1006
01:01:09,845 --> 01:01:11,815
Poor Woo Jin, too.

1007
01:01:12,715 --> 01:01:14,175
And poor Seong Jae.

1008
01:01:15,745 --> 01:01:16,745
And what about me?

1009
01:01:31,865 --> 01:01:33,365
- Mom. - Yes?

1010
01:01:33,365 --> 01:01:36,435
Do you still have that notebook with the store's startup costs?

1011
01:01:36,735 --> 01:01:37,965
Can I borrow it?

1012
01:01:42,945 --> 01:01:44,375
What's up with Yeong Ra today?

1013
01:01:44,875 --> 01:01:47,475
She's been sitting there doing nothing for a while now.

1014
01:01:49,115 --> 01:01:50,115
Hey!

1015
01:01:51,885 --> 01:01:55,725
You weren't doing anything, so I was just checking on you.

1016
01:01:58,395 --> 01:02:00,355
I need to go meet someone,

1017
01:02:00,725 --> 01:02:02,525
but I don't want to tell you who it is yet.

1018
01:02:06,595 --> 01:02:09,635
All right. I'll just give you a ride, then?

1019
01:02:10,335 --> 01:02:11,605
I already called a cab.

1020
01:02:11,975 --> 01:02:15,045
Why did you call a cab? I'm right here.

1021
01:02:15,475 --> 01:02:16,905
Just make sure I get in okay.

1022
01:02:18,975 --> 01:02:23,015
Hey. Still, you should at least tell me who you're meeting.

1023
01:02:23,015 --> 01:02:26,085
This is a serious breach of my security duty.

1024
01:02:27,115 --> 01:02:29,255
I told you. I don't want to talk about it yet.

1025
01:02:29,485 --> 01:02:30,925
I'll get back on my own, too.

1026
01:02:47,535 --> 01:02:49,605
Hi, can I help you?

1027
01:02:50,045 --> 01:02:54,945
This is the right address, but the sign out front says AP.

1028
01:02:55,715 --> 01:02:58,585
Is Eunoism located here, too, by any chance?

1029
01:03:00,155 --> 01:03:01,955
This money I got...

1030
01:03:02,685 --> 01:03:05,025
The 20,000 dollars from Mom...

1031
01:03:06,125 --> 01:03:07,755
And if I break into my savings...

1032
01:03:10,225 --> 01:03:11,325
Yes?

1033
01:03:19,675 --> 01:03:20,735
Hello.

1034
01:03:24,375 --> 01:03:26,515
What brings you here?

1035
01:03:27,675 --> 01:03:29,545
I came to see my sister.

1036
01:03:31,185 --> 01:03:32,285
Your sister?

1037
01:03:33,215 --> 01:03:36,255
Don't we have the same mother?

1038
01:03:37,555 --> 01:03:38,825
Ko Seong Hui.

1039
01:04:24,505 --> 01:04:26,975
(Our Golden Days)

1040
01:04:27,375 --> 01:04:30,305
Seong Jae! How dare you make a move on our Su Bin, you punk?

1041
01:04:30,305 --> 01:04:33,675
He's divorced. And there's a nine-year age gap.

1042
01:04:33,815 --> 01:04:35,845
Seriously, how could they even have a romance?

1043
01:04:35,945 --> 01:04:39,285
Do you have any idea what nonsense you're spouting?

1044
01:04:39,355 --> 01:04:42,225
It's really over. Yes!

1045
01:04:42,755 --> 01:04:46,425
You keep saying "your mom," but she's your mother, too.

1046
01:04:46,495 --> 01:04:48,125
Did your mother put you up to this?

1047
01:04:48,195 --> 01:04:51,465
How can you say such a thing? Does your mom know too?

1048
01:04:51,625 --> 01:04:53,135
Where did you hide Woo Jin?

1049
01:04:53,435 --> 01:04:55,905
So you're the one who put these weird ideas in his head.
