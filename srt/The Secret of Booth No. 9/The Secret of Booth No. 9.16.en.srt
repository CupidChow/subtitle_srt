Episode 16

2
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,240
This message is really interesting.

3
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,320
If the phone booth number nine

4
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,960
can really grant her wish,

5
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,800
Can you make her forgive me?

6
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,080
Could it be

7
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,080
Fu Chen wrote to Fang Xiaocheng?

8
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,520
How is that possible?

9
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,960
Zhou Yihuan, what's wrong?

10
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,920
Are you going to fight with Fu Chen?

11
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,760
Let me take you somewhere.

12
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,480
What about the investigation?

13
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,840
Let's split up.

14
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,640
It hurts!

15
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,120
You deserve it.

16
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,520
Aren't we too high-profile?

17
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,080
It's okay.

18
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,400
Just get used to it.

19
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:16,760
I wish

20
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,920
time can stop at this moment.

21
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:21,000
Why do you suddenly say that?

22
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,120
Nothing.

23
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,320
I just feel

24
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,280
happiness came so suddenly.

25
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,039
Everything is so fictional.

26
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:29,920
In the future,

27
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:31,480
we will have a long time.

28
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,240
Why did you bring me here?

29
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,520
I suddenly remembered

30
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,320
we haven't had a proper date

31
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,920
we haven't had a proper date yet.

32
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,800
Wait here.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,880
I'll be right back.

34
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,520
Where are you going?

35
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,759
Wait for me.

36
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,680
Why are you so silly?

37
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,440
Zhou Yihuan, what are you doing?

38
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,880
Be my girlfriend, okay?

39
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,800
Didn't I

40
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,400
promised you before?

41
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,640
I told you

42
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,600
I want to give you an unforgettable confession.

43
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,720
Do you like it?

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,800
Yes.

45
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,960
But this ring is too expensive.

46
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,600
This DR diamond ring

47
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,360
can only be customized for a lifetime.

48
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,560
It represents

49
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,880
you are my only true love.

50
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,520
So I think it’s perfect to give you this.

51
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,880
Dumpling, I want to tell you

52
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,240
no matter where you are,

53
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,840
as long as you take it,

54
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,720
I will find you.

55
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,920
I wish

56
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,960
time

57
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,920
can stay at this moment forever.

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,920
I hope

59
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,240
time can be faster.

60
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,520
until we grow old

61
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,880
to the end of life.

62
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,640
Because I want to prove to you

63
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,040
Even if the time and space are in chaos,

64
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,360
I can still

65
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,880
love you

66
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,000
for the rest of my life.

67
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,760
I trust you.

68
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,360
This ring is the best proof.

69
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,280
No matter where I was born,

70
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,520
I will take it

71
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,800
until you find me.

72
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:39,920
You two...

73
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:40,520
Stop!

74
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,240
Give me back my hat!

75
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:41,760
Run!

76
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,720
Stop! Stop!

77
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,600
My good uncle.

78
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,280
Can you check the CCTV for us?

79
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,640
Please.

80
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,040
It's been so long.

81
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,520
How can we still find it?

82
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,240
We have a new clue.

83
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,880
We want to see the scene.

84
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,400
Brother.

85
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,000
Listen to me.

86
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,240
Excuse me.

87
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,680
Don't worry.

88
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,440
I was careless.

89
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,680
I'll look for it again.

90
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,120
What did you say to the security guard?

91
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,640
Nothing.

92
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,800
In other words,

93
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,280
you can hit ten.

94
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,520
Stop.

95
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,000
Zoom in.

96
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,480
I found it.

97
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,520
Thank you

98
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,200
Isn't this Anki?

99
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,159
Why is she here?

100
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,840
I'm leaving. Bye.

101
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,280
Have a good rest. Take care.

102
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,680
Coming.

103
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:51,960
Hello

104
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,200
Looks like something happened

105
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,080
in Oh Anki's house.

106
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,360
I'll go take a look

107
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,840
Anki.

108
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,160
Miss Wu

109
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,640
What are you doing?

110
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,920
What are you doing?

111
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,520
Let me remind you.

112
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,840
Debts.

113
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,800
Pay me back!

114
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,840
This has nothing to do with you.

115
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,440
You can leave now.

116
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,240
Let's go.

117
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,960
Come with us

118
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,880
with us.

119
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,640
Let go of me!

120
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,000
I don't know you.

121
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,480
If you keep pulling and pulling,

122
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,560
I'll call the police.

123
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,720
Go ahead.

124
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,440
Do it!

125
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,240
Your dad borrowed our money.

126
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,320
Now your dad ran away.

127
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,560
and sold the house.

128
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,880
I can only ask you for money.

129
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I don't have money.

130
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,480
It's killing me.

131
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,480
Not bad.

132
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,760
You're quite tough.

133
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,120
Who are you?

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,160

Anki.

140
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,680
Don't be so double-standard, OK?

141
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,360
Stop pretending.

142
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,640
Aren't you here to laugh at me?

143
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,840
We're just unnecessary.

144
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,800
I don't need it.

145
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,920
What are you doing?

146
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,720
What are you doing?

147
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,920
I'm asking for money.

148
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,440
