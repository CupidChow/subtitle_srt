00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,520
Where is the seat you reserved for me?

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,400
Over there.

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,360

Amazing!

11
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,440
What's wrong with you?

12
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,480
Good luck!

13
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,280

00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,520
Lin Shen, you really came.

21
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:23,760
Looks like you…

22
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,480
Can you do me a favor?

23
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,240
No problem.

24
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,240
All 100 will do.

25
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,440
Anki.

26
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,920
We meet again

27
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,880
Thank you for

28
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,920
for cheering for me.

29
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,560
You got it wrong.

30
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,920
I'm cheering for our own faculty.

31
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,960
So you're from Class 8.

32
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,560
Still, thank you

33
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,400
for watching the game.

34
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,360
You guys are amazing too.

35
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,759
We saw it just now.

36
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,600
Thank you.

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,520
I'm Li Guan from Class 2 of Design Department.

38
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,920
Nice to meet you.

39
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,479
Me too.

40
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,039
Li guan.

41
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:55,960
We are from Class 8, Design Department.

42
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,640
My name is

43
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,200
Li guan.

44
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,600
Are you the one

45
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,920
is you?

46
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,640
I advise you

47
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,560
you should stop thinking about it.

48
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,039
I've seen

49
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,760
like you.

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,160
Anki.

51
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,840
Goodbye.

52
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,040
Chen Chen.

53
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,680
Don't be angry.

54
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,560
Zhou Yihuan.

55
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,079
Are you okay?

56
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,160
The wound is so deep.

57
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,200
How can you say you're fine?

58
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,320
Let me take you to the infirmary.

59
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,320
I’m really fine.

60
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,560
Fang Xiaomei.

61
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,920
Are you done?

62
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,280
Su Tian Tian.

63
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,240
From now on,

64
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,360
Fu Chen,

65
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,560
is yours.

66
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,000
And this one for free.

67
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,480
is also yours.

68
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,560
Let's go.

69
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,520
Fu Chen.

70
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,760
What's going on?

71
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,120
Explain it.

72
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,240
Tell me.

73
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,720
the meaning of your existence here

74
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,640
is because of me.

75
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,760
And

76
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,160
You said you only have me in your heart.

77
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,760
Was it impulsive?

78
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,480
No.

79
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,240
After all,

80
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,160
we don't have much time left.

81
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,800
What happened?

82
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,200
He was fine just now.

83
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,560
Why did you suddenly change your face?

84
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,320
Let's go.

85
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,320
Why are you spacing out?

86
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,120
Forget it.

87
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,560
It's just a minor injury.

88
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,200
No way.

89
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,840
You'll get infected if you don't treat the wound.

90
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,280
I'm really fine.

91
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,160
I'm leaving.

92
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,520
Wait.

93
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,840
Do you

94
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,040
want to go to the infirmary?

95
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,560
Wait here.

96
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,480
I'll be right back.

97
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,440
Don't go.

98
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,120
How dare you touch my sister!

99
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,840
Are you okay?

100
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,360
Give me your hand.

101
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,200
I'll apply medicine for you.

102
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,440
Does it hurt?

103
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,280
It's my fault that you got hurt.

104
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,600
It doesn't hurt you.

105
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,520
It's my fault.

106
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,200
I came back late.

107
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:35,760
I made you...

108
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,400
No.

109
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,720
She insisted on waiting for you.

110
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,400
Done.

111
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,400
Thank you.

112
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,640
Don't say thank you.

113
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,880
We're friends who share weal and woe.

114
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:55,920
And...

115
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,960
you got hurt because you protected me.

116
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,040
Even if it's thanks,

117
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,440
I should thank you.

118
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,680
Friend?

119
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,760
Yes.

120
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,560
You are my most important friend

121
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,640
besides Lin Shen.

122
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,120
Besides...

123
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,320
Forget it.

124
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,400
We still have a long time.

125
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,280
I won't let anything happen to you.

126
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,440
Let’s go.

127
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,000
It’s me. I’m Lu Tianlang.

128
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,640
Why are you here?

129
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,120
What?

130
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,120
You saw me?

131
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,159
not Zhou Yihuan.

132
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,280
I let you down.

133
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,159
Why are you so violent?

134
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:49,280
Lu Tianlang, I warn you.

135
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,320
If you keep talking nonsense about Zhou Yihuan and me,

136
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,560
I'll remove your arm.

137
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,440
So

138
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,840
you don't like Zhou Yihuan?

139
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,680
Of course.

140
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,040
Lin Shen.

141
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,080
Lu Tianlang.

142
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,000
You two...

143
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,160
It's okay.

144
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,240
We're leaving.

145
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,200
Wait.

146
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,480
Listen.

147
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,680
What's that sound?

148
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,680
It sounds like crying.

149
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,640
It's from

150
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,280
from the forest over there.

151
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,480
I think so.

152
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,200
Phone booth No.9.

153
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,280
Guys.

154
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:51,720
It's him again.

155
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,000
Why are you still here at this hour?

156
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,960
Security.

157
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,080
It's you.

158
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:56,200
You scared us.

159
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,040
Mister.

160
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,280
Have you heard of

161
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,000
the legend of No. 9 telephone booth?

162
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,240
Is it the telephone booth No. 9

163
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,440
can connect to time

164
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,640
and even talk to the dead.

165
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,720
These are all lies.

166
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,080
I've been here for so long.

167
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,560
Is it really that powerful?

168
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,520
I would know.

169
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,160
Have you heard about

170
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,280
the school worker?

171
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,040
You mean...

172
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,400
the school worker

173
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,000
who broke his leg?

174
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,000
To be honest,

175
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,440
that person

176
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,240
It's me.

177
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,280
Surprised?

178
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,080
Surprised?

179
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,720
But

180
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,320
I didn't get any calls.

181
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,440
It was that rainy night.

182
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,360
When the road slipped,

183
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,520
I fell down.

184
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,800
Look at my leg.

185
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,760
It's fine.

186
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,000
It's fine.

187
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,760
His leg is fine.

188
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,320
Right?

189
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:50,920
I guess I was overthinking.

190
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,080
It's going to rain soon.

191
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,400
Go back to your dorm.

192
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,600
Don't catch a cold.

193
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:57,920
Bye.

194
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,800
Bye, mister.

195
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,520
It was a false alarm.

196
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,920
I heard someone crying just now.

197
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,320
Yes.
