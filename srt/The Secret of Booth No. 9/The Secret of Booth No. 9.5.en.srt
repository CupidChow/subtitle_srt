1
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:26,960
These three boys

2
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,800
are the most popular boys in school.

3
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,680
Zhou Yihuan.

4
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:30,720
Lu Tianlang.

5
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:31,840
Fu Chen.

6
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,120
Lu Tianlang and Fu Chen

7
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,120
hate Zhou Yihuan very much.

8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,200
Maybe

9
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,440
we can investigate

10
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,400
from Lu Tianlang and Fu Chen.

11
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,760
Fu Chen.

12
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,200
I almost forgot my unlucky ex-boyfriend.

13
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,200
What are you thinking about?

14
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,120
Nothing.

15
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,840
Are you thinking about Fang Xiaomei?

16
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,280
She told me

17
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,720
she broke up with you.

18
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,920
One-sided?

19
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,400
I'll ask her.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,840
Chen Chen.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Why are you asking?

22
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,880
You don't care about my feelings at all.

23
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,280
In that case,

24
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,039
I'd better leave.

25
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,440
Tian Tian.

26
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,880
Don't be angry.

27
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,600
That's not what I meant.

28
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,760
She's my real girlfriend.

29
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,600
I'm afraid

30
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,840
know about us.

31
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,400
You haven't told her the truth yet.

32
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,080
Do you want to break up with her or not?

33
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,600
Of course.

34
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,440
She did nothing wrong.

35
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,920
I can't tell her either.

36
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,560
Give me some time.

37
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,360
Okay?

38
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,640
Chen Chen, I heard that

39
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,800
Fang Xiaomei

40
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,520
Zhou Yihuan recently.

41
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,640
Zhou Yihuan again?

42
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,520
Fu Chen.

43
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,880
I don't think so.

44
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,200
He is

45
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,840
is jealous,

46
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,400
but he's a coward.

47
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,720
He doesn't have the guts to do this.

48
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,920
Do you think

49
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,480
Could it be...

50
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,640
Lu Tianlang?

51
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,880
Although Lu Tianlang hates Zhou Yihuan,

52
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,960
and beat him,

53
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,440
But if I kill him,

54
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,720
No.

55
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,280
Who could it be?

56
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,200
If he wants to do it,

57
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,120
he must be the most familiar person.

58
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,120
How about this?

59
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,040
I’ll keep an eye on Lu Tianlang for you.

60
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,200
But if you want to find out the truth as soon as possible,

61
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,240
you must get Zhou Yihuan's approval first.

62
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,720
It's best

63
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,840
find a chance

64
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,840
to stay by his side.

65
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,760
In this way,

66
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,680
you can know him

67
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,280
and protect him in secret.

68
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,640
What should I do?

69
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,320
Look at his face.

70
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,880
It's written on his face.

71
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,240
Come to think of it,

72
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,640
every time you come back,

73
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,480
is related to the telephone booth number nine?

74
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,280
Yes.

75
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,640
Could it be...

76
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,200
It's the telephone booth number nine.

77
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,000
Whenever I hear the phone ringing,

78
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,840
I would come back to where I am now.

79
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,800
Zhou Yihuan.

80
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,720
What are they talking about?

81
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,800
They were so excited.

82
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,520
I don't know.

83
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,960
Boring Boring

84
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,600
All you do is study.

85
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,440
Number one.

86
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,360
Awesome.

87
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,600
I'm better than you too.

88
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,880
Simple-minded.

89
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,840
My limbs are weak.

90
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,480
My limbs are weak.

91
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,240
Go to the basketball court with me if you dare.

92
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:35,960
I'm busy.

93
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,000
It seems

94
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,320
the number nine telephone booth is the key to everything.

95
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,280
What does the telephone booth

96
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,400
with Zhou Yihuan's death?

97
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,320
How about

98
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,520
we split up?

99
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,680
I'll investigate the telephone booth No. 9.

100
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,640
You're in charge.

101
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,880
to attack Zhou Yihuan.

102
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,280
Attack him.

103
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,000
This is too hard.

104
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,840
No matter what it takes,

105
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,960
we have to get Zhou Yihuan's approval.

106
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,040
Then

107
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,720
into his life.

108
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,160
Okay.

109
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,680
I'll try my best.

110
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,480
Ziqi.

111
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,040
This phone booth

112
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,720
recorded all our good memories.

113
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,079
Although you've been gone for many years,

114
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,480
I've never forgotten you.

115
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,360
No.

116
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,320
Thank you.

117
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,840
Let's go.

118
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,600
BA029.

119
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,120
Rule 1 of the guide.

120
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,159
Join us.

121
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,760
[The best way]

122
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,120
The best way

123
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,240
is to start with each other's interest.

124
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,520
What a coincidence, Zhou Yihuan.

125
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,840
You want to read this book too?

126
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,680
There's only one book left.

127
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,360
Why don't we...

128
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:09,960
No need.

129
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,680
I've seen it.

130
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,560
See for yourself.

131
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,920
Wait.

132
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,360
Zhou Yihuan.

133
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,400
Do you believe in time travel?

134
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,480
I've always doubted my attitude

135
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,400
I've always been suspicious.

136
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,760
Theoretically,

137
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,280
What about emotional?

138
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,080
Do you believe it?

139
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,320
I do.

140
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,520
or not,

141
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,920
doesn't matter.

142
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:33,280
Why not?

143
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,640
If you believe me,

144
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,640
you will know

145
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,560
I did all this for you.

146
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,320
Fang Xiaomei,

147
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,720
Why did you

148
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,960
Q1-Q get involved in this circulation?

149
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,200
Zhou Yihuan

150
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,760
Why is he so stubborn?

151
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,600
Strategy guide number two.

152
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,200
Body collision.

153
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,000
Make a chance to run into each other.

154
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,400
Think of a way.

155
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,360
They have physical contact.

156
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,560
and leave a deep impression on each other.

157
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,440
Zhou Yihuan.

158
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,080
Rule 3 of the guide.

159
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,440
Food seduction.

160
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,920
Zhou Yihuan.

161
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,240
We have to start with

162
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,120
attack Zhou Yihuan's stomach first.

163
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,560
Zhou Yihuan, breakfast.

164
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,159
Why isn’t he here yet?

165
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,520
I’d better talk to Lin Shen.

166
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:52,920
Lin Shen.

167
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,080
You must have been waiting for a long time.

168
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,560
Let's go.

169
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:54,960
It's okay.

170
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,320
This is...

171
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,720
No. 9 telephone booth.

172
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,280
Myeongdae used to have a lot of phones.

173
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,600
but they were all suspended because of the long-lost repair.

174
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,560
It's strange.

175
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,120
Only the telephone booth No. 9 hasn't been demolished.

176
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,240
Legend has it that

177
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,160
[Every midnight,]

178
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,760
the bell of the phone booth always rings.

179
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,840
[There was a school worker who answered the phone out of curiosity.]

180
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,800
There was only a sad cry inside.

181
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,280
The person who answered the phone

182
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,200
broke his leg the next day.

183
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,120
Kill him! Kill Zhou Yihuan!

184
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:06,760
Lin Shen.

185
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,000
You’re amazing.

186
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,200
I just found out

187
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,240
the horror legend of No. 9 telephone booth.

188
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I don't know

189
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,280
about Zhou Yihuan.

190
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,240
It's okay.

191
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,160
You're already amazing.

192
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,800
You found so many things in such a short time.

193
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,200
Zhou Yihuan.

194
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,760
