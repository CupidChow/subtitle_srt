1
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,680
Come and have a look

2
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,800
Come and take a look.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,800
What is it?

4
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,240
Our number nine telephone booth.

5
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,080
Dream Film Club

6
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,160
is officially established.

7
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,040
Please look forward to the comments.

8
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,400
Do you have any wishes

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,560
or anything you want to tell,

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,840
you can come to our official account.

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,520
and leave comments.

12
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,400
We'll try our best

13
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,880
to realize your dreams.

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,960
Let's

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,960
create warmth

16
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:44,600
and upward.

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,560
A beautiful campus that helps each other.

18
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,640
Idol is more powerful.

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,040
Hey,

20
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,160
What's your wish?

21
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,760
Sounds good.

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,240
Let me help you.

23
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,520
Everyone, line up here.

24
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,760
Give me one.

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:00:59,880
Fu Chen.

26
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:00,800
Look.

27
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,360
Fang Xiaomei has been with you

28
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,360
with Zhou Yihuan behind your back.

29
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,560
Come, take a look.

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,800
Attention.

31
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,480
Take a look if you're interested.

32
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,320
Please look forward to it.

33
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,560
Do you really have a wish?

34
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,680
you can leave a message on it.

35
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,280
Let's go, Chen Chen.

36
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:12,840
What do you want to say?

37
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,920
Your wish will come true.

38
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,200
Come on.

39
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,320
Take a look.

40
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,080
No hurry.

41
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,160
You have a chance to realize it.

42
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,560
What did you write?

43
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,120
Please pay attention to our official account.

44
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,680
When did Fang Xiaomei

45
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,880
have such a good relationship

46
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,640
with two boys in class.

47
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,320
Yeah, Angel.

48
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,880
You have to

49
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,479
Yes.

50
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,280
How?

51
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:36,880
Not only Zhou Yihuan and Lu Tianlang,

52
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,479
even Lin Shen

53
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:40,600
is on her side.

54
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,880
What do you want me to do?

55
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,560
It's okay.

56
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,440
Anyway

57
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,800
the summer heart-fluttering party was sponsored by her dad.

58
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,960
We'll decide

59
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,280
to appoint Fang Xiaomei

60
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,160
as the least popular girl in the school.

61
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,240
He Jing.

62
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,880
Is there anything else

63
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,039
nothing else?

64
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,039
Angel

65
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,080
Why are you

66
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,240
He Jing.

67
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,320
Even if the ball is about to start,

68
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,240
it has nothing to do with you.

69
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,640
You want to get the ranking?

70
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,280
Don't think

71
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,520
you'll really think of yourself

72
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,880
Do you really think you're a nobody?

73
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:37,800
Today,

74
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,800
Thank you for your hard work.

75
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,680
Why don't we go out tonight?

76
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,520
Sure.

77
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,040
Then you have to treat us to a big meal.

78
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,840
No problem.

79
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,000
All you know is eating.

80
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,400
What have you been doing all day?

81
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,200
Aren't you just watching?

82
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,480
It's been a day.

83
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,120
Why haven't we received

84
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,079
hasn't received the wish order yet?

85
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,640
In my opinion,

86
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,200
this is unreliable.

87
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,200
If it were me,

88
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,560
I would never

89
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,480
to others.

90
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,160
Don't be too anxious.

91
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,520
This is just the beginning.

92
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,600
A wish order.

93
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,960
It takes time.

94
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,640
Right.

95
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,160
All right.

96
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,360
Let's not talk about work tonight.

97
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,720
You're not happy when you're out for dinner.

98
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,440
Bottoms up.

99
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,120
Suit yourself.

100
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,520
Wish our Dream Film Club a successful business.

101
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,480
Cheers.

102
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,320
Zhou Yihuan.

103
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,000
I've been wanting to ask you something.

104
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,160
Why are you here

105
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,240
What are you doing here?

106
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,240
Yeah.

107
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,400
Of course I'm here to help.

108
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,480
Unlike someone.

109
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,600
Since young,

110
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,880
you've been causing trouble.

111
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,560
What do you mean?

112
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,640
Who's causing trouble?

113
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,160
You want me to help you

114
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,520
to recall

115
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,680
what you did when you were young?

116
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:05,840
How dare you!

117
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,120
When you were young,

118
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,240
You two have known each other since childhood?

119
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,480
Not only that.

120
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,520
I don't know what I did in my previous life.

121
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,640
From kindergarten

122
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,880
from kindergarten

123
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,360
in the same university.

124
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,200
in the same class.

125
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,880
What a coincidence.

126
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,200
I haven't said anything yet.

127
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,440
You feel sorry for yourself.

128
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,720
All right.

129
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,800
Today,

130
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,920
thanks to you.

131
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,760
Thank you

132
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,560
every one of you.

133
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,240
Cheers.

134
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,400
Cheers.

135
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,080
Can I really save Zhou Yihuan?

136
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,040
What are you thinking?

137
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,840
You look so focused.

138
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,480
Nothing.

139
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,880
Thank you

140
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,800
thank you.

141
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,000
Actually,

142
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,920
I'm surprised that you came.

143
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,520
I'm sorry.

144
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,640
I misunderstood you

145
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,760
I wronged you.

146
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,440
Fang Xiaomei,

147
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:08,840
If

148
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,640
you don't like Lu Tianlang,

149
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:25,920
Meteor.

150
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,200
Where is it?

151
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,800
Meteors are so beautiful.

152
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,200
I hope this moment

153
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,760
can last forever.

154
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,240
I hope we can

155
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,040
change the ending together.

156
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:53,240
I don't believe in telephone booth number nine,

157
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,680
I hope

158
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,120
it can fulfill

159
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,560
our wishes today.

160
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,600
I hope

161
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,520
everything will be fine.

162
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,720
Go back and sing me a song.

163
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,840
Fang Xiaomei.

164
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,880
What are you doing?

165
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,960
I want to give you a gift.

166
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,760
What is it?

167
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,680
Wait for me here.

168
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,880
Star core.

169
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,200
That's a nice name.

170
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,000
This is it.

171
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,240
Is the Heart of Starlight not Su Tian Tian's work?

172
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,960
but Zhou Yihuan?

173
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,920
Hello, everyone.

174
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,200
This is the star core I designed.

175
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,720
I drew the star core for myself.

176
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,200
It means every ordinary girl

177
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,320
like me

178
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,960
can shine like stars.

179
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,480
I think designing jewelry

180
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,960
doesn't need expensive jewelry

181
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,000
and exquisite craftsmanship.

182
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,440
What we need

183
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,560
to give it some stories.

184
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,800
Thank you.

185
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:39,920
Congratulations.

186
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,000
Welcome to the star map.

187
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,720
Okay.

188
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,440
How could this happen?

189
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,400
The core of stars?

190
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,880
Is it related to Zhou Yihuan's death?

191
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,840
Roger was fine.

192
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,360
Could it be someone else

193
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,559
The circulation isn't over.

194
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:43,280
Actors.

195
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:44,880
[Ming Peng as Lu Tian Lang]

196
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:45,560
