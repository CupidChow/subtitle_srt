00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,640
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,080
My name is He Jing.

3
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:37,960
Follow me.

4
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:38,960
Come here.

5
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,800
Let me introduce.

6
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:52,600
These

7
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,360
are the members of

8
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,760
of Yuanmeng Club.

9
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,800
Thank you.

10
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,880
At the same time, thank everyone

11
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,680
everyone.

12
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:08,960
Actually,

13
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,400
I've always wanted to invite you to be my dance partner.

14
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,000
But I made a mistake.

15
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,680
So your name is He Jing.

16
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,000
Let me introduce myself again.

17
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,560
Hello, He Jing.

18
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,160
I'm Li Guan from Class 2 of Design Department.

19
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,880
Can you be my dance partner?

20
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,440
Say yes.

21
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,840
Say yes!

22
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:37,600
Say yes.

23
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,080
Let's dance together.

24
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,160
Wait for me.

25
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,800
What's wrong?

26
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,960
I lost my plan.

27
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,800
Could it be the Star core?

28
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,160
Nice!

29
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,760
Take Zhou Yihuan's plan and destroy it.

30
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,960
Get lost. Don't control me anymore.

31
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,720
Hey.

32
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,079
Whose plan is this?

33
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,400
If we lose it,

34
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,520
it'll be hard to find it.

35
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,600
It's mine.

36
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Thank you.

37
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:44,680
Yihuan.

38
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,520
Why didn't you go to the interview?

39
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,640
Why are you here?

40
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,079
What about your plan?

41
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:02,960
Guys.

42
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,040
Come here.

43
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,840
Come here.

44
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,960
Don't leave the stage.

45
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,600
Zhou Yihuan's design plan is lost.

46
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,720
If anyone finds it,

47
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,360
please hand it over.

48
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,959
This

49
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,800
is related to

50
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,360
of our school.

51
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,200
If

52
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,880
hand it over,

53
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,680
Look, what's on the screen?

54
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,080
What does the plan have to do

55
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,560
with Zhou Yihuan?

56
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,320
Who took it?

57
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,440
Who took it?

58
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,720
How could this happen?

59
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,840
Isn't this Fang Xiaomei?

60
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,480
The person who followed Zhou Yihuan

61
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,960
is Fang Xiaomei.

62
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,320
Looks like

63
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,680
must be stolen by her.

64
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,960
Anki.

65
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,360
Don't frame others

66
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,080
This video can’t prove anything.

67
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,320
Then tell me yourself.

68
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,480
Why are you following him?

69
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,000
Zhou Yihuan.

70
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,280
Fang Xiaocheng approached you

71
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,480
is obviously up to no good.

72
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,280
Don't be fooled by her.

73
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,320
Zhou Yihuan.

74
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,280
What are you doing?

75
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,520
So many people are watching.

76
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,880
Yihuan.

77
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:37,200
What are you doing?

78
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,800
Fang Xiaomei is my girlfriend.

79
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,440
I know clearly

80
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,800
why she approached me.

81
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,600
No matter who shot this video,

82
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,000
is invasion of privacy.

83
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,920
I’ll investigate and deal with it according to the law.

84
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,840
As for the missing plan,

85
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,640
I can prove

86
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,840
it wasn’t Fang Xiaomei.

87
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,680
I know

88
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,040
her ability.

89
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,520
She's better than me.

90
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,600
There's no need to steal the proposal.

91
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,480
I drew the necklace

92
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,760
was drawn by me.

93
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,360
Zhou Yihuan.

94
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,240
Fang Xiaomei.

95
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,000
Come to my office.

96
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,480
Guys,

97
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,840
Dismiss.

98
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,200
If you find any clues,

99
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,720
feel free to tell me.

100
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,840
No matter what,

101
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,960
Fang Xiaocheng stalked you secretly.

102
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,600
She is the most suspicious.

103
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,640
Zhou Yihuan.

104
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,200
This matter

105
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,680
has nothing to do with you.

106
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,440
Don't be emotional.

107
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,400
I told you.

108
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,680
Someone took that video maliciously.

109
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,920
The plan

110
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,240
has nothing to do with Fang Xiaomei.

111
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,040
Mr. Zhou, please give me some time.

112
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,520
I will find out

113
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,040
and find Zhou's plan.

114
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,240
I'll give you three days.

115
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,600
Zhou Yihuan.

116
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,800
I'm sorry.

117
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,640
To prove my innocence,

118
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,240
to prove my innocence.

119
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,200
But

120
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,840
your performance was really good.

121
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,680
I think you can even get Oscar.

122
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,520
I didn't perform.

123
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,800
I'm telling the truth.

124
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:37,960
What about you?

125
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,600
I haven't asked you yet.

126
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,440
You go first.

127
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,560
Fang Xiaomei.

128
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,720
Actually,

129
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,080
I noticed you long ago.

130
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,800
I remember.

131
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,600
you worked at a convenience store late at night,

132
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,600
but you're full of energy.

133
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:11,520
Bye.

134
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,200
Bye.

135
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,040
I still remember

136
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,640
you were bullied by Anki

137
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,040
but you don't blame yourself.

138
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,760
I remember you told me

139
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,440
You said

140
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,200
the reason you're here

141
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,440
is because of me.

142
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,360
So...

143
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,200
can I ask you to be my girlfriend?

144
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,000
I don't mean anything else.

145
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,440
I just want to tell you

146
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,680
the meaning

147
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,080
the meaning of my life

148
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,320
