00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,280
Episode 20

2
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,120
You and my sister

3
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,720
between you and my sister.

4
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,280
Who are you?

5
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,880
You're the person Ziqi cares about the most.

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,680
Live for her.

7
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,920
Roger!

8
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,320
Stop singing

9
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,080
The campus group said

10
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,400
someone jumped off the building.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,800
Who is it?

12
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:53,880
I don't know yet.

13
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,080
Are you calling Zhou Yihuan?

14
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,480
Answer it.

15
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,000
Pick up.

16
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:12,840
I got it.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,080
I think it's a school security guard.

18
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,360
Roger!

19
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:17,920
Roger!

20
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,000
Could it be...

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,360
that day?

22
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,920
Roger's death

23
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,560
How can I break the cycle?

24
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,680
Roger was the one who killed me!

25
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,120
But maybe there are two Roger.

26
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,360
Let me show you

27
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,360
about the past.

28
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,680
When Ziqi and I

29
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,320
met each other,

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
when we first met.

31
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,120
Although she didn't say anything,

32
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,320
but in the crowd,

33
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,000
in the crowd.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,560
After that, I came to Ming University to study.

35
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,920
I didn't expect to meet her again.

36
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,760
I recognized her immediately.

37
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,240
We

38
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,720
[because of that.]

39
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,160
Myeongdae.

40
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,920
I'm from the gym.

41
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,240
Let's go. We're lost.

42
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,040
I can hear you.

43
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,520
Are you a teacher?

44
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:45,920
No.

45
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,880
I'm a student!

46
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,640
I'm Roger.

47
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,920
I'm a swimming athlete

48
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,200
a swimmer.

49
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,440
I'm still a freshman in school this year.

50
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,960
Logically speaking,

51
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,680
I should call you senior.

52
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,880
You call me old.

53
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,640
I'd better be your junior.

54
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,720
Hello.

55
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,960
In my pursuit of her,

56
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,920
our hearts

57
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,360
Ziqi.

58
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,000
are getting closer to each other.

59
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,240
I just finished running.

60
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,280
I'm leaving.

61
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,520
Later I found

62
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,560
she often went to the telephone booth No. 9.

63
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,640
There's a special code.

64
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,440
Call your brother.

65
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,640
Thank you.

66
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,680
No.

67
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,640
Thank you.

68
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,160
Let's go.

69
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,640
That's when...

70
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,440
Number 9.

71
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,640
Let's make a good memory together.

72
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,320
Bye.

73
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,640
Bye.

74
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,480
But good

75
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,440
always fades away.

76
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,120
Soon,

77
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,360
Ziqi was in danger.

78
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,800
To protect her,

79
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,040
I was hit by bad guys.

80
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,760
From then on,

81
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,280
I lost the qualification to be an athlete.

82
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,280
But I don't regret it.

83
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,600
The only thing I regret is

84
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,360
I didn't show up earlier.

85
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,840
Protect her.

86
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,520
Are you okay?

87
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,280
Roger!

88
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,760
was

89
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,600
who saved my sister.

90
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,640
Since then,

91
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,160
Ziqi seems to have changed.

92
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,160
On her face,

93
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,840
on her face.

94
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:13,920
Ziqi.

95
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,720
That day,

96
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,480
I swear.

97
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,040
From now on,

98
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,600
I must do my best to protect her.

99
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,720
It's okay, Ziqi.

100
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,680
I won't let her get hurt anymore.

101
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,240
I made you lose your future.

102
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,360
I was about to retire.

103
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,520
Look, there are so many excellent athletes in the country.

104
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,720
I'm not the only one left.

105
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,200
You're so good.

106
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,720
You're going to participate in an important competition.

107
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,000
It's all my fault.

108
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,600
Now that I lost my career,

109
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,680
I can't study in Myungil University anymore.

110
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,240
I can still accompany you now.

111
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,280
Look, my legs are fine now.

112
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,360
right?

113
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,840
Right?

114
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,920
Okay, don't cry.

115
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,040
But

116
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,320
an accident happened.

117
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,680
Ziqi, what's wrong?

118
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,880
She got pregnant

119
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,480
because of that hurt.

120
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,280
This won't affect my love for her,

121
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,720
but I'm afraid she can't take it.

122
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,400
Therefore,

123
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,240
I decided to propose to her.

124
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,240
and be with her forever.

125
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,320
But

126
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,240
it was a mistake.

127
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,840
When I returned home to get my household register,

128
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,320
she thought I was running away.

129
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,000
You let me down.

130
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,320
Your future

131
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,600
to be buried on someone like him?

132
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,120
A security guard

133
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,160
and a cripple.

134
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,200
Take care of my stomach.

135
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,160
I'll send you abroad.

136
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,680
You brat!

137
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,320
Come back!

138
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,640
And her beloved brother

139
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,760
didn't receive her call.

140
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,800
The sad Ziqi

141
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,040
decided to leave this world.

142
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,040
Sister.

143
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,400
My daughter.

144
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,280
Why are you doing this?

145
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,159
Why are you doing this?

146
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,200
I've lost the person I love the most forever.

147
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,360
I had no regrets.

148
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,440
But unexpectedly,

149
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,920
a seed of hatred

150
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,680
