Episode 12

2
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,120
How have you been?

3
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,080
Why haven't you

4
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,160
for so long?

5
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,720
I was so worried.

6
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,720
Can you study hard?

7
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:54,840
Of course.

8
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,640
That's good.

9
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,400
Did you fight with your dad?

10
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,680
You always mention him to me.

11
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,720
Of course not.

12
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,280
How dare I offend Director Zhou?

13
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,360
That's good.

14
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,440
Be good.

15
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,680
Ziqi.

16
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,640
Let's go.

17
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,680
BONELESS

18
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:13,960
Who is talking?

19

Yihuan.

20
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,800
Eat well.

21
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,080
Sleep well. Bye.

22
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,800
What are you thinking?

23
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,720
Brat.

24
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:35,880
You're so focused.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Nothing.

26
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,960
Yihuan,

27
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,520
You've made a lot of friends lately.

28
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,039
Don't affect your study

29
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,720
affect your study.

30
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,680
No.

31
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,440
That's good.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,200
Don't imitate your sister.

33
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,400
You know an indecent person.

34
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:00,960
who ruined

35
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,760
my life.

36
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,000
Don't mention my sister.

37
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,960
This...

38
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,640
is a dead game.

39
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,400
I can give in as your father.

40
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,200
But in this society,

41
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,079
no ordinary people can take a wrong step.

42
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,079
You're my only son now.

43
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,040
Don't let me down.

44
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,440
I'll take responsibility

45
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,800
I'll take responsibility.

46
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,200
It's up to me

47
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,680
is up to me.

48
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,840
Sit down.

49
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,760
Uncle Lu

50
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:53,240
is recruiting

51
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,079
young excellent designers.

52
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,840
He wants you to go to the interview.

53
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,240
No need.

54
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,400
I'll make my dream come true

55
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,800
with my own efforts.

56
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,920
It's not just your dream.

57
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,000
but also your sister's dream.

58
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,440
Are you going to

59
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,200
your sister’s wish?

60
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,120
Fang Xiaomei.

61
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,960
You fool.

62
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,400
Don't bully him.

63
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,920
Don't cry.

64
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,560
Here.

65
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,680
Tianlang,

66
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,200
When can you

67
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,640
get a girlfriend?

68
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,880
You must go on this date.

69
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,440
Mom, I have class today.

70
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,320
I don't have time.

71
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,800
What class?

72
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,080
Don't lie to me.

73
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,360
It's the weekend.

74
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,760
This girl

75
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,480
is the daughter of your mom's friend.

76
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,080
You met her when you were young.

77
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:40,640
Boys shouldn't be late.

78
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,040
If you don't come,

79
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,320
if you don't come,

80
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,560
I won’t protect you.

81
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,360
Lin Shen.

82
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,720
Where are you going?

83
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,640
None of your business.

84
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,720
Can you not be so fierce to me?

85
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,320
We are a team.

86
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,880
You went to the same restaurant as me.

87
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,160
Don't cry, baby.

88
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,800
Let's go eat something delicious.

89
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,880
Mister,

90
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,560
What's your relationship with this kid?

91
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,320
I...

92
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,159
I'm his father.

93
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,320
Where are your parents?

94
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,159
Do you know this man?

95
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,880
Don't talk nonsense.

96
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,400
Our child is too young to understand.

97
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,680
We still have things to do.

98
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,000
You still want to leave?

99
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,200
I’ve called the police.

100
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,400

101
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,120

102
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,400

103
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,520

with a dance partner.

105
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,280
Who is He Jing?

106
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,600
I've never heard of her

107
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,800
Angel

108
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,360
What's going on?

109
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,200
He Jing.

110
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,080
When did you become Zhou Yihuan's dance partner?

111
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,040
How would I know?

112
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,320
Zhou Yihuan even rejected me.

113
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,160
He agreed to be her dance partner.

114
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,480
It must be Fang Xiaomei.

115
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,760
I knew it.

116
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,159

117
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,120

118
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,520
with He Jing.

119
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,560
So he prepared this behind your back.

120
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,480
Fang Xiaomei.

121
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,640

122
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,080

123
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,400
