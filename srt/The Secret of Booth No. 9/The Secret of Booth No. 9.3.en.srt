1
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,320
Zhou Yihuan.

2
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,920
No matter how many times you repeat it,

3
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,040
I'll kill you.

4
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:46,960
Why?

5
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,800
Why?

6
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:54,960
See you later.

7
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,640
Bye.

8
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,880
The date is up.

9
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,240
Did I jump out of the circle?

10
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,120
Baby, what are you doing?

11
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,400
Let's meet this afternoon.

12
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,080
My mom called.

13
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,680
See you later.

14
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:11,920
Fu Chen.

15
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,600
Why are there so many treasures?

16
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,960
Which baby are you talking to?

17
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:16,760
Fang Xiaomei.

18
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,640
or Su Tian Tian?

19
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,280
Tian Tian, baby.

20
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,840
It was my mom.

21
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,160
Look at my mom. I hung up.

22
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:23,840
Pick up your call.

23
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,400
See you later.

24
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:25,960
What are you doing?

25
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,720
Scum!

26
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,640
Zhou Yihuan, are you crazy?

27
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,200
You deserve it.

28
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,160
What's wrong with you two?

29
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,479
Zhou Yihuan.

30
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:42,160
Not bad, Zhou Yihuan.

31
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:42,840
You're helping the people.

32
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,800
I have to find Roger!

33
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,200
What?

34
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,080
You don't like him?

35
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,120
Find out what happened.

36
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,360
Is there someone you like?

37
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:48,960
Su Tian Tian.

38
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,240
Duoduo.

39
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,360
Xinxin.

40
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,520
Or Fang Xiaomei?

41
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,120
Shut up.

42
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,440
Tell me.

43
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,360
Fang Xiaomei,

44
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,880
Don’t try to buy time.

45
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,400
Where is my necklace?

46
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,440
Bro.

47
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,840
Just admit it.

48
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,080
June 20.

49
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,200
It's in advance.

50
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,160
Say something.

51
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,240
Looks like

52
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,560
I have to solve this problem first.

53
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,040
Go to Zhou Yihuan.

54
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,720
Fang Xiaomei.

55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,400
Do you know why I called you here today?

56
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,320
No.

57
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,880
I stole Angie's necklace

58
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,960
I'll pretend nothing happened.

59
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,760
It's good enough that

60
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,680
to report you to Director Zhou.

61
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,560
Not me.

62
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,960
What do you want?

63
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,960
Angel

64
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,800
Bro.

65
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,240
Calm down.

66
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,360
Why are you upset?

67
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,040
People who don't know

68
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,240
will think we're bullying you.

69
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,240
Yeah.

70
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,160
Forget it.

71
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,200
I don't want the necklace.

72
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,280
I don't like to bring things people touch.

73
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,960
I'll give you one month.

74
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,400
buy me a new one.

75
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,960
Otherwise,

76
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,480
you'll be fired.

77
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,280
What are you doing?

78
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,079
What are you doing?

79
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:33,960
Get lost!

80
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:41,880
It's okay.

81
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,120
Are you dumb?

82
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,560
You took the necklace, didn't you?

83
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,720
Take it out.

84
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,240
The class is about to start.

85
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,320
Don't waste everyone's time.

86
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,760
Do you have evidence?

87
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,480
Who else could it be?

88
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,600
That's right.

89
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,360
You think so too?

90
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:09,960
Bro.

91
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,760
Calm down.

92
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,520
Everyone

93
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,800
just want to help Anki find something first.

94
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,960
I believe

95
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,279
Even if you took it,

96
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,800
you must have your reasons.

97
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,040
Su Tian Tian.

98
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,040
Why didn't I notice

99
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,520
you're a snob.

100
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,360
Xiao Min.

101
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,200
What are you talking about?

102
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,000
Anki.

103
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,040
When was the last time

104
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:40,000
the last time you saw the necklace?

105
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,280
I think so.

106
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,560
Last night...

107
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,159
Before going to the bar,

108
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,520
I didn't bring it

109
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,320
so I didn't bring it.

110
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,200
and put it in the box.

111
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,560
What do you mean?

112
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,280
Do you really think you're Conan?

113
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,360
Yes.

114
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,159
What about the exact time?

115
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,120
I don't remember.

116
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,200
I know.

117
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,280
8:40 p.m.

118
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,080
We watched

119
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,480
last night.

120
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,200
Anki was changing her clothes.

121
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,200
I was almost late.

122
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,320
The show was at 9 p.m.

123
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,720
So I remember it clearly.

124
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,120
That means

125
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,760
we just need to check

126
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,040
where everyone is

127
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,920
where is everyone?

128
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,640
We'll know

129
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,840
who went back to the dorm.

130
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,000
According to you,

131
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,159
everyone will go back to the dorm to rest at night.

132
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,920
Then everyone is suspected.

133
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,200
Su Tian Tian.

134
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,000
You're right.

135
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,000
Except Anki,

136
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,120
each of us

137
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,080
is a suspect.

138
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,280
I went out with Anki last night.

139
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,640
We were together all night

140
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,960
I just came back.

141
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,320
Maybe

142
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,960
she's the thief.

143
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,720
Please.

144
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,400
It's just a necklace.

145
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,080
Buy as much as you want.

146
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,600
Do I need to lie to you?

147
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,320
Bro.

148
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,440
You’ve said it all.

149
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,320
What about you?

150
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,160
What a coincidence.

151
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,640
Last night,

152
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,040
all night

153
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,640
in the library.

154
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,640
What library?

155
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,520
Can anyone prove it?

156
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,600
You're the most suspicious.

157
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,680
Take it out.

158
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,520
If I can prove it,

159
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,120
Su Tian Tian.

160
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,600
Next.

161
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,360
is you.

162
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,520
Anyway,

163
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,920
if you can't find the necklace,

164
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,560
none of you can escape.

165
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,440
I didn't expect that I would jump out of the circle this time.

166
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:49,640
But what's going on?

167
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,880
It seems that only he knows.

168
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,480
Who are you?

169
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,280
What's wrong, Zhou Yihuan?

170
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,159
Stop pretending.

171
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,400
Don't you know why I'm here?

172
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,080
What happened today?

173
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,760
So violent.

174
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,560
Hit anyone you see.

175
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,920
Why are you following me?

176
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,320
Puppy.

177
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,360
So cute.

178
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,520
Did you raise it?

179
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,200
What do you think?

180
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:12,840
Isn't it cute?

181
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:13,760
I found it.

182
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,600
But we can't keep it in the staff dorm.

183
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,640
I'm quite worried.

184
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,440
That's good.

185
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,240
Let me take care of it.

186
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,400
We're destined to meet.

187
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,240
You look so alike.

188
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,800
Indeed.

189
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,920
That's great.

190
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,040
Help me solve a big problem.

191
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,880
Be good.

192
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,160
Good boy.

193
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,760
Why is he so gentle?

194
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,440
His legs are fine too.

195
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,800
What should I call you?

196
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,080
