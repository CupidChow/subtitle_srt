1
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,600
You've done it, haven't you? You've done it, haven't you?

2
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,640
Have you forgotten?

3
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,240
As a student,

4
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,240
how can you not study hard every day?

5
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,520
I didn't expect that after graduation for so many years,

6
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,560
after graduation.

7
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:49,920
What are you mumbling about?

8
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,800
What are you talking about?

9
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,040
I mean

10
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,680
after so many years,

11
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,600
you haven't changed a bit.

12
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,120
You're still so energetic.

13
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,440
You don't have to flatter me.

14
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,920
I know what you girls

15
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,440
what you are thinking.

16
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,640
Although

17
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,680
in college,

18
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,240
allowed students to fall in love freely,

19
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,760
But I can't let you

20
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,039
to do whatever you want.

21
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,560
Mr. Zhou,

22
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,280
I really didn't harass Zhou.

23
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,600
You misunderstood.

24
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,760
Bad news, Mr. Zhou.

25
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,880
Bad news, Mr. Zhou.

26
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,680
Liu.

27
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,880
Why are you in such a hurry?

28
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,440
Zhou Yihuan.

29
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,920
Something happened.

30
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,080
Yihuan!

31
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,000
Could it be...

32
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,720
Zhou Yihuan had an accident?

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,840
It's today.

34
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,360
Zhou Yihuan.

35
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,520
It's really you.

36
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,120
What's going on?

37
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,280
Trust me.

38
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,520
I'll figure it out.

39
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,640
Why am I here again?

40
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,480
Am I tied to Zhou Yihuan's death?

41
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,800
July 13th, 2018.

42
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,680
It's this day again.

43
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,000
I still couldn't jump out of the circle.

44
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,120
But fortunately,

45
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,960
She's fine.

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,840
Zhou Yihuan.

47
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,800
Are you okay?

48
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,720
Why are you shouting?

49
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,240
Fang Xiaomei,

50
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,160
If you want to fail,

51
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,200
if you want to fail.

52
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:54,720
Sit down.

53
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,760
Sorry.

54
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,680
It's so awkward.

55
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,760
But luckily,

56
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,040
Zhou Yihuan is still alive.

57
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,160
You have bad taste.

58
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,320
You should

59
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,360
you should chase me.

60
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,160
What is Fang Xiaomei doing?

61
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,000
Is she also Zhou Yihuan's fan?

62
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,600
With her?

63
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,960
Look in the mirror.

64
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,880
Chen Chen.

65
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,800
Fang Xiaomei has such a good boyfriend.

66
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,760
with such a good boyfriend.

67
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,800
Not like me.

68
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,800
Fang Xiaomei.

69
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,200
What are you doing?

70
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,920
How embarrassing.

71
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,600
Who are you to control me?

72
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,800
What right do I have?

73
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,120
I'm your boyfriend.

74
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,160
Yes.

75
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,000
Fang Xiaomei, I warn you.

76
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,440
Stop following me.

77
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,960
Fang Xiaocheng,

78
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,840
I hope you can be safe this time.

79
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,160
and return to your original life.

80
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,960
Lu Tianlang.

81
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:42,920
Are you free?

82
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,720
Let's talk.

83
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,000
Aren't you Zhou Yihuan's fan?

84
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,480
I have nothing to talk about.

85
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,040
Who said I'm his fan?

86
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,320
I'm your fan.

87
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,240
What I did just now

88
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,079
for you.

89
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,960
Do you think

90
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,680
Do you really think Fang Xiaomei can save you?

91
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,080
Zhou Yihuan, you don't deserve to be saved.

92
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,120
Where are you?

93
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,400
Come out.

94
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,000
I told you.

95
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,720
I won't allow you to be happy.

96
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,760
Those who wish to save you

97
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,120
will be dragged into the cycle of pain by you.

98
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,320
Fang Xiaocheng,

99
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,840
Why did you come back?

100
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,640
For me.

101
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,440
Yes.

102
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,960
When I was in the exam hall,

103
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,880
to disturb Zhou Yihuan

104
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,120
to take him off

105
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,840
from the first place.

106
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,600
Really?

107
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,800
It's true.

108
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:59,000
Think about it.

109
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,480
He is

110
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,840
is focusing on studying.

111
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,400
How can I compete with you?

112
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,600
You're right.

113
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,080
I didn't expect you to care so much about me.

114
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,120
That's...

115
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,280
Unfortunately,

116
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,560
such a good plan

117
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,680
was disrupted by Director Zhou.

118
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,200
Don't worry.

119
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,920
I have another plan.

120
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,880
What plan?

121
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,640
If Zhou Yihuan

122
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,720
can't take the next exam,

123
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,240
What will happen?

124
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,159
I'm sorry.

125
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,680
Hey, where are you?

126
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,840
[I'm in kindergarten.]

127
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,960
Zhou Yihuan.

128
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,800
I'm sorry.

129
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,640
To protect you,

130
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,400
I have to lock you up here.

131
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,800
Are you ready?

132
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,640
Don't worry.

133
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,400
He can never escape.

134
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,440
What are you doing?

135
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:12,640
Lin Shen.

136
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,920
Don’t play this trick on me.

137
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,080
Don't try to get close to me.

138
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,800
By the way,

139
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,640
Lin Shen and I became good friends

140
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,840
after that.

141
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:20,880
Lin Shen.

142
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,000
Why are you here?

143
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,680
Are you

144
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,960
looking for Zhou Yihuan?

145
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,200
Why am I here?

146
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,840
I should be asking you that.

147
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,240
And you.

148
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,200
Cut the crap.

149
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,600
Follow me to the director’s office.

150
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,240
Lin Shen, be gentle.

151
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:35,600
Lin Shen.

152
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,360
It hurts.

153
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,520
Lin Shen.

154
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,160
What are you doing?

155
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,880
I’m warning you.

156
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,280
Stay away from Fang Xiaocheng.

157
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,720
You like to fight against me?

158
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,240
A029.

159
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:14,960
BA029.

160
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,640
Lin Shen.

161
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,560
We just want to

162
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,880
with Zhou Yihuan.

163
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,159
Lock Zhou Yihuan.

164
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:35,640
Let him miss the next exam.

165
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,600
This is nothing.

166
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,480
Lin Shen, you heard it.

167
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,960
Why are you so protective of Zhou Yihuan?

168
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,400
Tell me.

169
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,360
Do you like him

170
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,360
bullying others,

171
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,520
I will.

172
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,400
Lu Tianlang.

173
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,840
Director Zhou will blame us.

174
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,080
I'll take the responsibility.

175
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,200
I won’t implicate you.

176
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,480
Fang Xiaomei,

177
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,680
You are so loyal.

178
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,760
I will

179
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:56,080
your friend.

180
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,200
By the way,

181
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,320
how could I forget Zhou Yihuan?

182
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,080
He must still be locked in the studio.

183
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,600
Ten big locks.

184
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,800
I don't believe

185
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
he can escape.

186
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,120
Now,

187
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,800
He should be fine.

188
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,920
What's wrong?

189
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,120
Did you see anything falling?

190
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,520
I think someone fell.

191
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,960
Excuse me.

192
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,600
Mr. Liu.

193
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:33,919
What happened?

194
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,200
Did something happen to Zhou Yihuan?

195
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,200
