00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,800
Episode 13

2
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,000
Xiaomei.

3
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,120
He Jing.

4
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:38,720
He Jing.

5
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,400
You look so pretty today.

6
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,800
Really?

7
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,840
Thank you.

8
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,160
Fang Xiaomei.

9
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,440
You are really helping He Jingjing.

10
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,600
This year's summer ball

11
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,920
must be very lively.

12
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,080
Everyone comes to the summer ball.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,440
Look in the mirror.

14
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,120
He Jing.

15
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,400
Don't take their words to heart.

16
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,360
Just enjoy your performance today.

17
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,280
But...

18
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,720
Will Zhou Yihuan really come today?

19
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,080
Don't worry.

20
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,200
He has promised to come.

21
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,200
Su Tian Tian.

22
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,840
Did you

23
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,000
Zhou Yihuan just now?

24
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,600
No.

25
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,920
That's strange.

26
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,400
The ball is about to start.

27
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,160
Our campus beau

28
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,880
hasn’t shown up yet?

29
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,640
Fang Xiaomei.

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,640
Lin Shen.

31
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,600
You’re finally here.

32
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,880
Come here.

33
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:40,880
What’s wrong?

34
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:55,479
Lu Tianlang.

35
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,280
What happened to your leg?

36
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,320
Muss.

37
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,160
Tianlang.

38
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,080
Tian Lang.

39
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,080
Behave yourself.

40
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,200
Tianlang.

41
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,639
What happened?

42
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,600
Get up.

43
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,560
Are you hurt badly?

44
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,520
Auntie.

45
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,760
Isn't this Shen Shen?

46
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:18,520
Why are you two together?

47
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:19,880
Could it be...

48
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,720
the girl I went on a blind date with?

49
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,440
What blind date?

50
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,079
I'm just out for dinner.

51
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,400
Don't move.

52
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,600
Tian Lang.

53
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,240
I'll take you to the hospital.

54
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,960
You guys are amazing.

55
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,440
You’re brave.

56
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,960
Lin Shen, you are my idol.

57
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,960
Why don’t you praise me?

58
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,079
I even got hurt.

59
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,560
Your leg...

60
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,600
Are you okay?

61
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,120
I'm fine.

62
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,840
It’s only 100 days.

63
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:47,960
Lin Shen.

64
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,920
I got hurt because of you.

65
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,280
You can't leave me alone.

66
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,640
Muss.

67
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:54,800
Xiaomei.

68
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,760
Zhou Yihuan may not be able to come.

69
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,120
What?

70
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,800
He's going for an interview.

71
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,280
It's all my dad's fault.

72
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,520
He insisted on being a young designer.

73
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,920
for young designers.

74
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,280
But the prom is about to start.

75
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,800
Can he make it in time?

76
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,320
What should we do now?

77
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,000
Don't look at me.

78
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm a patient.

79
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,200
But He Jing is still looking forward to it.

80
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,840
We can't let her down.

81
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,720
Fu Chen.

82
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,640
Come with me.

83
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,320
Fu Chen.

84
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,280
Can you be He Jing's partner?

85
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,079
Sure.

86
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,320
I have a condition.

87
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,680
What is it?

88
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:53,960
Xiao Min.

89
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:56,040
Let’s make up.

90
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,920
Think about how beautiful

91
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,840
how wonderful it was.

92
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,720
After we separated,

93
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,880
I've always regretted

94
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,440
when I saw Zhou Yihuan with you,

95
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,880
I feel heartbroken every day.

96
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,120
As long as we make up,

97
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,120
I'm willing to do anything.

98
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,920
Fu Chen.

99
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,800
It's impossible for us.

100
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,600
Don't you feel sorry

101
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,840
don't you feel sorry

102
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,320
and Su Tian Tian?

103
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,360
Please

104
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,720
help me if you want.

105
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,600
Forget it if you don't want to help.

106
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,240
I really don't love Su Tian Tian.

107
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,800
It's all her wishful thinking.

108
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,880
I shouldn't have asked you for help.

109
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,240
I have something to do.

110
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,160
I have to go.

111
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,520
Bro.

112
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,600
Give me another chance.

113
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,600
Fang Xiaomei

114
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,560
humiliated me again and again.

115
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,280
I won't let you go.

116
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,040
Meteors are so beautiful.

117
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,360
I hope this moment

118
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,080
can last forever.

119
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,480
Class,

120
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,520
our summer ball is about to start.

121
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,840
Come here, everyone.

122
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,160
Come on.

123
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,160
In this summer season

124
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,120
in the middle of summer,

125
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,920
We welcome the annual summer party

With our youth

128
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,040
with our youth.

129
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,520
Tonight, let's dance

130
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,760
with dance

131
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,000
for the beautiful campus life.

132
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:43,720
Next,

133
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,680
we announce

134
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,800
the summer ball of Mingchuan University

135
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,640
officially begins.

136
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,159
Let's welcome He Jing

137
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,560
Zhou Yihuan, please get ready.

138
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,680
Xiaomei.

139
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,080
It’s OK.

140
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,480
I know you did your best.

141
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,280
I was too greedy.

142
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,520
He Jing.

143
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,360
Do you want to have

144
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,800
your own solo dance?

145
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,400
Me.

146
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,680
OK?

147
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:23,960
Lin Shen.

148
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,800
Lu Tianlang.

149
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,080
Can you help me?

150
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,400
Fang Xiaomei, I’m late.

151
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:03,880
It’s OK.

152
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,120
You came just in time.

153
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,960
Hello.

154
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,800
I believe that before today,

155
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,640
no one knows me.

156
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,800
That's right.

157
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,920
I'm just a nobody in school.

158
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,680
Well,

159
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,720
Walking on the campus

160
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,760
on the way to school.

161
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,280
But today,

162
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,720
Thank you very much.

No. 9 Telephone booth, Yuanmeng Club.

164
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,920
They

165
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,480
gave me

166
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,400
to be myself.

167
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,520
At the same time,

168
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,720
I also want to

169
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,800
who are like me

170
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,000
say something.

171
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,120
I hope

172
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,280
can do
