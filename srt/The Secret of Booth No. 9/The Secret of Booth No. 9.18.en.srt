00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,800
Episode 18

2
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,840
Two bottles.

3
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:32,759
Two bottles.

4
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,560
Take a bag of sugar.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,800
Take another bag.

6
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,520
One more.

7
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,240
Are you done?

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,200
I came to the supermarket with you.

9
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,400
Don't push your luck.

10
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,880
Why are you so fierce?

11
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,320
I'm a patient now.

12
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,440
Besides,

13
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,640
we have

14
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,680
a major discovery?

15
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,920
Eat you to death.

16
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,200
This one.

17
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,360
Take a box.

18
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,280
A box?

19
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,440
I'll eat more.

20
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,240
It’s good for your health.

21
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:21,960
Lin Shen.

22
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,320
Are you okay?

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,840
I'm fine. It hurts.

24
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,520
I'll take you to the hospital.

25
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,800
It's okay. I'll be fine after a sleep.

26
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,000
Stop it.

27
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,479
What if you hurt your bone?

28
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,120
Let me take you to have a check.

29
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:53,960
It's okay.

30
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,720
Look.

31
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,640
I can still run.

32
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,800
Enjoy yourself.

33
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,800
I'm going back.

34
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,080
Wait for me.

35
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,200
Wait for me!

36
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,760
Hey, you can't go in here.

37
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,160
Sorry.

38
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,760
It's late.

39
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,079
Go back and rest.

40
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:32,640
But...

41
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,360
I have to ask Roger.

42
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,480
And we don't have much time.

43
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,120
Now that we have a clue,

44
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,720
rest is more important.

45
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,760
What a coincidence!

46
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,520
We just found Roger

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,040
he disappeared

48
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:52,960
Maybe

49
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,320
it has nothing

50
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,880
has nothing to do with him.

51
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,640
I also think it's unbelievable.

52
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,440
Roger! Security!

53
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,280
Why would he steal the plan?

54
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,240
But we can't let our guard down.

55
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,600
Let's look for it tomorrow.

56
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,520
Tomorrow is my sister's birthday.

57
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,040
[If it hadn't happened that day,]

58
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,240
that day.

59
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,520
What's wrong?

60
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,800
What happened?

61
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,240
Nothing.

62
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,720
It's getting late.

63
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,960
Go back and rest.

64
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,960
See you tomorrow.

65
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,000
See you tomorrow.

66
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,360
Bye.

67
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,800
What's wrong with Xiaomei and Zhou Yihuan?

68
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,960
Why do they look so down?

69
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:39,920
Maybe

70
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,240
Tomorrow is Zi Qi's birthday.

71
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,040
He must be in a bad mood.

72
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,040
Sister.

73
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,040
Zhou Yihuan's biological sister

74
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,880
is a few years older than us.

75
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,320
When I was young,

76
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,000
Zhou Yihuan and I got into trouble.

77
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,400
It's all her fault.

78
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,120
who pleaded for us to Uncle Zhou.

79
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,320
Why is he in a bad mood

80
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,080
on her birthday?

81
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,280
She passed away.

82
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,520
Actually, since then,

83
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,840
Zhou Yihuan seemed to have changed.

84
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,320
Later, I rarely saw him smile.

85
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,960
Let's go.

86
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,400
This is

87
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,520
is the closest to my sister.

88
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,840
Phone booth

89
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,360
It carries a lot of memories of me and my sister.

90
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,440
Happy birthday.

91
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,520
Ziqi.

92
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,480
Thank you, Xiaomei.

93
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,760
Sorry.

94
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,800
I didn't know about her before.

95
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,400
It's okay.

96
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,200
I didn't tell you in advance.

97
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,360
How did Zi Qi...

98
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,560
I'm the one

99
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,520
It's all my fault.

100
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:43,840
What?

101
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,040
Why are you here?

102
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,600
Fang Xiaomei.

103
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,720
Zhou Yihuan.

104
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,920
Why are you here?

105
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,960
What are you doing here?

106
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,920
Are you here to visit

107
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,240
Ziqi?

108
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,480
Speaking of which,

109
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,880
Ziqi Zhou

110
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,240
She's my junior.

111
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,120
What?

112
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,360
You're Zi Qi's senior.

113
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,440
What are you talking about?

114
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,160
How could my sister be your junior?

115
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,680
Maybe.

116
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,520
My hair

117
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,080
looks older.

118
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,920
I'm sorry.

119
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,960
Mister, no.

120
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,440
Boss.

121
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,680
It's okay.

122
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,560
I've been called uncle for many years.

123
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,480
I've never heard

124
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,200
about you and my sister.

125
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,720
It's normal that she didn't mention it to you.

126
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,960
I have no presence.

127
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,200
Luo.

128
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,960
Do you often visit Ziyi?

129
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:45,720
Yes.

130
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,400
She helped me a lot before.

131
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,000
It's my duty

132
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,120
for her.

133
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,960
Thank you for caring about my sister.

134
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,360
I thought in this world,

135
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,520
only my father and I

136
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,040
who

137
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,200
remember her.

138
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,800
Ziqi Zhou.

139
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,320
She's so outstanding

140
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,160
and kind.

141
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,520
I shouldn't be forgotten.

142
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,080
By the way, Zhou,

143
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,360
In the past,

144
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,120
Ziqi often came to this phone booth.

145
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,240
She once told me

146
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,600
she cared about

147
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,640
is you.

148
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,360
Although that happened,

149
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,320
but I hope

150
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,760
don't be too sad.

151
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,880
You still have a long way to go.

152
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,920
Just now,

153
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,360
Roger seems to have

154
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,120
is not as simple as normal classmates.

155
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,600
But since he cares so much about Ziqi,

156
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,680
Zhou Yihuan is her brother.

157
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,240
He wouldn't do anything to hurt Zhou Yihuan.

158
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,360
It seems that

159
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,960
the one who stole the plan

160
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,760
is not Senior Roger.

161
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,280
His suspicion

162
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,760
can be excluded.

163
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:03,920
Actors.

164
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,280
