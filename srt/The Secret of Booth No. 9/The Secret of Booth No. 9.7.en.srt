1
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,240
Will it work?

2
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,600
Of course.

3
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,760
Trust me.

4
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,400
Okay.

5
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,120
Close the door

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,880
Anki

7
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,680
Someone asked me to give this to you

8
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:46,800
Who is it?

9
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:47,840
What are you doing?

10
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,520
Li guan from Class 2.

11
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,360
He wants to invite you

12
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,760
to be his partner for the summer ball.

13
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,440
Li guan.

14
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,400
What is he?

15
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,000
He deserves to be my dance partner.

16
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,120
I've given it to you.

17
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,840
It's up to you whether to go or not.

18
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:17,800
Zhou Yihuan.

19
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,440
Someone asked me to give you this downstairs.

20
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,640
What is it?

21
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,960
Is it a love letter?

22
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,720
Who is it?

23
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,520
Could it be Fang Xiaomei?

24
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,000
Could it be Lin Shen?

25
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,240
Not a girl.

26
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,800
It's a man.

27
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,200
Ziqi.

28
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,720
I didn't expect

29
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,680
in this world.

30
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,400
Let's go.

31
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,800
Two kids

32
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,480
They're on the phone.

33
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,880
Hey, where are you?

34
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,079
I'm in kindergarten.

35
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,040
Why?

36
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,560
He's not picking up.

37
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,040
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,200
Why didn't you answer

39
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,800
your sister?

40
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,040
I didn't mean it.

41
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,520
I regret it too.

42
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,320
Stay back!

43
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,840
What’s wrong?

44
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,400
Fang Xiaomei,

45
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,680
I didn’t mean to push you away.

46
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,760
But getting close to me

47
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,320
will only put you in danger.

48
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,720
Zhou Yihuan.

49
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,520
Breakfast.

50
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,320
Although the circulation is ahead of schedule,

51
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,120
accidents can happen anytime.

52
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,120
Before I know everything,

53
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,920
I can only stay away from you temporarily.

54
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,280
Lin Shen, Xiaomei.

55
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,400
Zhou Yihuan.

56
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,680
Zhou Yihuan.

57
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,120
It's getting closer

58
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,240
to July 13.

59
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,320
How can I save you?

60
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,800
Zhou Yihuan.

61
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,240
Why are you avoiding me?

62
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,360
I'm not hiding from you.

63
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,760
I just remembered

64
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,640
I have something to do.

65
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,280
Can you

66
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,760
take a look at the design drawing?

67
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,440
No.

68
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,240
Mr. Zhou, why are you here?

69
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:10,880
Here.

70
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,320
The color is not obvious.

71
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,200
You purposely expanded the colour warmth

72
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,440
to control the saturation.

73
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,440
The whole painting looks weird.

74
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,760
Add the fixed color.

75
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,840
The color is too subjective.

76
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,000
and ignored the objective fact of describing objects.

77
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,160
Fang Xiaomei, are you childish?

78
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,520
Zhou Yihuan.

79
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,640
You are the one with two faces.

80
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,080
Pretend to be a student when there's someone.

81
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,560
When no one is around,

82
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,840
Just like now.

83
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,640
cold and mean.

84
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,760
Are you done?

85
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,480
What do you want?

86
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,520
I just want you to help me with my study.

87
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,560
Mr. Zhou said

88
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,240
the exam is coming.

89
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,000
A student with bad grades

90
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,720
should learn from a good student.

91
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,440
Alright.

92
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,880
I'm sorry, okay?

93
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,640
Here.

94
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,680
It's a telephone booth number nine.

95
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,680
Why did you draw this?

96
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,520
Because

97
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,440
I want to make

98
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,160
a public account of No. 9 telephone booth

99
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,040
and tell you the story.

100
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,680
What story?

101
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,280
Because of some mysterious reason,

102
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,920
Telephone booth No. 9

103
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,520
can connect two dimensions.

104
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,640
A girl

105
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,840
and a boy.

106
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,200
Because the telephone booth can talk through space.

107
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,159
This girl

108
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,280
saved the boy

109
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,520
in another time and space.

110
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,159
Why?

111
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:44,920
You mean

112
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,840
why you want to make this public account?

113
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,480
Because...

114
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,120
No.

115
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,200
I mean...

116
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,320
Why did you save

117
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,840
someone unrelated?

118
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:54,960
I believe

119
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,320
If it were you,

120
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,960
you would do the same.

121
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,760
Fang Xiaomei,

122
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,920
You may never know

123
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,560
there was someone

124
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,200
who was there

125
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,000
I'll always protect you.

126
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,320
If

127
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,480
come close to me,

128
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,040
will make you miserable.

129
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,600
The reason I exist in this time and space

130
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,280
is because of you.

131
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,680
Let me accompany you.

132
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,400
to revive the telephone booth No. 9.

133
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,040
What are you doing?

134
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,520
Fu Chen, what's wrong with you?

135
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,360
Fang Xiaomei.

136
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,440
Su Tian Tian told me you were pursuing Zhou Yihuan.

137
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,760
I didn't believe it.

138
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,520
I didn't expect you to be so shameless.

139
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,080
What else do you have to say?

140
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,400
I have nothing to say.

141
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,960
We broke up long ago.

142
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,440
What am I to you?

143
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,040
You're nothing.

144
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,080
To be honest,

145
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,400
I only have Zhou Yihuan in my heart.

146
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,600
What did you say?

147
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,800
Zhou Yihuan.

148
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,680
It has nothing to do with you.

149
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,559
Fang Xiaomei,

150
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,880
Who do you think you are?

151
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,280
Zhou Yihuan likes you?

152
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,720
Whether he likes you or not,

153
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,120
is related to her.

154
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,440
It has nothing to do with you.
