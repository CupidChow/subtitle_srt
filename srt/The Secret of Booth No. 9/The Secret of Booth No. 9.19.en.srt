1
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,760
No way.

2
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,560
How could I steal the plan?

3
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,120
BA029.

4
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,280
It's us, not you.

5
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,680
This time,

6
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,120
BAOL.

7
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,680
We must kill Zhou Yihuan.

8
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,080
We were going to ask Roger,

9
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,960
but he showed up.

10
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,440
What if...

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,240
wasn't Roger,

12
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,480
It's him

13
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,640
Okay, Detective Fang.

14
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,640
Let's go to Su Tian Tian

15
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,120
and ask her.

16
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,400
Okay.

17
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,360
What's wrong, Yihuan?

18
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,760
Nothing.

19
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:33,240
Bro.

20
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,280
I have something to do at home.

21
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,280
I have to go back.

22
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,600
I'll try my best

23
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,720
I'll try my best to get there.

24
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,479
Okay, I'll wait for you.

25
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,120
Bye!

26
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,640
Roger

27
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:55,600
Zhou Yihuan, why are you here?

28
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,640
You really took the plan.

29
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,400
What are you doing?

30
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,280
Zhou Yihuan.

31
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,760
I'm sorry. I really don't know

32
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,080
How long are you going to pretend?

33
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,000
I really don't know

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,360
why I have the plan.

35
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,520
I really don't know.

36
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,440
Let me help you figure it out.

37
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,400
You used my sister's death

38
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,040
to threaten me.

39
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,320
Sing a children's song to make me feel guilty.

40
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,320
Break my will

41
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,360
How is it?

42
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,920
Now I remember.

43
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,120
Impossible.

44
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,000
Impossible.

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,040
I didn't write this.

46
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,160
This time,

47
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,560
What do you want this time?

48
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,640
Kill me?

49
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,600
Should we do it now

50
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,040
or July 13th?

51
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:36,960
No.

52
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,880
I just want to hand over the plan to you.

53
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,520
What July 13th?

54
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,280
What do you mean?

55
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:44,840
Roger!

56
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,200
Stop pretending!

57
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,480
Do it.

58
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,160
What are you waiting for?

59
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,160
Kill him now!

60
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,000
So...

61
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,560
Are you telling the truth?

62
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,160
Did I

63
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,720
Did I do it?

64
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,600
I won't hurt you.

65
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,760
I won't let anyone hurt you again!

66
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,400
Roger's eyes don't look like they're faking it.

67
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,160
But the one who hurt me...

68
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,760
was him.

69
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,040
What's going on?

70
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,520
Did something go wrong in space and time?

71
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,360
Look.

72
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,440
Welcome.

73
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,200
Fang Xiaomei.

74
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,600
Why isn't Zhou Yihuan here yet?

75
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,079
Something happened at home.

76
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,400
Maybe he's delayed.

77
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,480
It's best if he doesn't come.

78
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,720
I don’t want to see his square face.

79
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:48,920
Dumpling.

80
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,440
He Jing.

81
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,840
What are you doing?

82
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,720
Happy birthday.

83
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,760
How did you know it was my birthday?

84
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,200
It's a secret.

85
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,040
Later,

86
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,040
There's something more surprising.

87
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,520
Just don't be scared.

88
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:01,840
Go in.

89
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,840
I left you a seat.

90
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,640
Thank you.

91
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,040
He Jing.

92
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,880
Happy birthday.

93
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,880
Nice.

94
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,320
Thank you.

95
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,320
Sit down.

96
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,079
He's shy!

97
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,880
Could there be two Roger?

98
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,440
No way!

99
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,159
Why is there a cake?

100
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,960
Happy birthday.

101
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,040
Thank you.

102
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,080
Let's sing a song together.

103
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,720
Click it.

104
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:05,520
Happy birthday to you

105
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,320
Happy birthday to you

106
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,600
Thank you.

107
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,440
Happy birthday.

108
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,160
Blow out the candles and make a wish.

109
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,440
What's wrong?

110
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,280
I remember

111
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,560
I always celebrated her birthday.

112
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,800
But she never remembers my birthday.

113
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,400
I think

114
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,200
she must be regretting it now.

115
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,840
Will you forgive her?

116
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,040
No one is perfect.

117
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,880
who can't be wrong?

118
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,800
Am I right?

119
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,080
Yes.

120
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,760
No, I mean her.

121
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,760
Why are you here?

122
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,440
You're here.

123
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,400
You told me to come.

124
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,400
Not me.

125
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,680
It's also me.

126
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,640
But it doesn't matter.

127
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,640
I'm here to end this today.

128
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,560
What a coincidence.

129
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,440
Me too.

130
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,240
I won’t let you hurt Fang Xiaomei.

131
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,560
Actually,

132
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,720
I've always wanted to

133
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,400
I've always wanted to say sorry to you in person.

134
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,840
But I was afraid you wouldn't forgive me.

135
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,080
When I saw Li guan inviting you to dance,

136
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,320
I was scared.

137
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,360
I'm afraid you'll ignore me

138
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,720
after you fall in love.

139
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,960
And about what happened before,

140
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,320
I was too selfish.

141
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,880
I shouldn't have done that to you.

142
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,600
I'm sorry.

143
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,680
Li guan.

144
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,800
You must treat He Jing well.

145
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,080
Don't bully her.

146
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,400
If you dare to bully her,

147
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,800
I'll go to your faculty and tell your counsellors.

148
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,000
and expose you on campus.

149
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,400
Xiao Min, Lin Shen,

150
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,200
Thank you.

151
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,000
He Jing.

152
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,440
Li guan.

153
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,160
I wish you happiness.

154
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,320
Wait.

155
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,720
Who said I won't forgive you?

156
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,040
You don't know me at all.

157
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,760
Am I that kind of person who holds grudges?

158
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,360
I mean, I don't hate you at all.

159
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,960
Why can't I forgive you?

160
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,600
He Jing, you should have told me earlier.

161
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,880
I said so many cheesy words.

162
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,240
I thought you'd never talk to me again.

163
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,159
How is that possible?

164
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,400
I had a hard time without you.

165
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,520
I've been working in secret lately.

166
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,200
Look at my hands.

167
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,440
Happy birthday.

168
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,400
Thank you.

169
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,480
Thank you.

170
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,200
This is nice.

171
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,200
That's right.

172
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,080
When I saw you, I realized

173
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,400
In a blink of an eye,

174
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,200
she has been gone for so long.

175
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,040
The boy

176
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,480
who risked his life for her sister

177
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,840
has grown up.

178
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,520
You and my sister

179
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,120
between you and my sister.

180
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,680
Who are you?

181
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,280
You're the person Ziqi cares about the most.

182
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,080
Live for her.

183
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,920
Roger!

184
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:28,880
