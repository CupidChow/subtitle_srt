00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,800
Episode 4

2
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,240
Zhang Yong.

3
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,560
Li Shuqin.

4
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:33,880
Lin Shen.

5
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,040
Fang Xiaomei

6
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,360
Anki.

7
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,000
Su Tiantian.

8
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,480
He Jing.

9
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,760
You're late in the same dorm.

10
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,360
You are so united.

11
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,000
Go back to your seat.

12
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:52,880
Li Qiang.

13
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,320
What's wrong with you?

14
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,400
You didn't call and wake me up in the morning.

15
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:56,960
You didn't even buy breakfast.

16
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,200
Zhou Yihuan.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,200
Don't be late next time.

18
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,120
Fang Xiaomei.

19
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,480
Lu Tianlang.

20
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,120
You’re late.

21
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,960
Why did you bring a dog?

22
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,480
How dare you!

23
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,520
Mr. Zhou.

24
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,320
See you.

25
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,039
I'm leaving.

26
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:13,840
Bye.

27
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:17,880
Class begins.

28
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,080
Zhou Yihuan.

29
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,360
Zhou Yihuan.

30
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:24,920
Fang Xiaomei.

31
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,480
Why do you bother him?

32
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,320
That's right.

33
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,840
Open the textbook.

34
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,400
Zhou Yihuan.

35
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,520
Were you

36
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,720
at the library last night?

37
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,479
Did you leave before the store closed?

38
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,840
Do you remember

39
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,960
the person sitting opposite you

40
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,080
is me.

41
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:49,840
I don't remember.

42
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,720
You have to remember.

43
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,200
This concerns my innocence,

44
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,320
and your life.

45
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,440
Zhou Yihuan.

46
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,920
Think about it.

47
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,240
I fell asleep

48
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,960
fell asleep.

49
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,080
He didn't wake up before the restaurant closed.

50
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,280
What time is it?

51
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,200
Guys, stop studying.

52
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:29,840
A desperate adventure.

53
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,880
is closing.

54
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,960
Come back tomorrow.

55
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,520
Go.

56
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,840
Pack up and go back.

57
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,360
Zhou Yihuan.

58
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,680
Zhou Yihuan.

59
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,200
Is it an honor to fall asleep?

60
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,120
You're the only one

61
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,480
in the entire library.

62
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,160
How is it?

63
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,160
I stayed at the library last night.

64
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,040
last night in the library.

65
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,840
I don't have time to steal Anki's necklace.

66
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,200
If you don't believe me,

67
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,960
you can ask the librarian.

68
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,880
Su Tian Tian.

69
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,600
If I'm not mistaken,

70
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,840
The necklace.

71
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,560
You took it, didn't you?

72
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,600
What?

73
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,600
Don't talk nonsense.

74
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,120
Get in.

75
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,200
Hurry.

76
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,160
What’s wrong?

77
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:26,960
Fang Xiaomei.

78
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,240
Where are you going?

79
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,040
Fang Xiaomei.

80
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,120
We are best friends.

81
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,440
You trust me, right?

82
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,880
Explain it to me.

83
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,079
I used to think

84
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,360
you were my best friend in college.

85
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,680
But what about you?

86
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,200
You were with Fu Chen behind my back.

87
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,200
Dumpling is different now.

88
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,560
Will Roger change too?

89
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:53,200
Is this your so-called best friend?

90
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,280
When did you know

91
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,440
about me and Fu Chen?

92
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,520
He Jing.

93
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,600
Anki.

94
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,520
Just do what you should do with the necklace.

95
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,640
or compensate me.

96
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,920
or tell Director Zhou.

97
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,480
But you can't use violence.

98
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,280
Fang Xiaomei,

99
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,080
Stop pretending.

100
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,840
Fu Chen really likes me.

101
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,320
He's with you

102
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,240
just to pity you.

103
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,480
Just think about yourself.

104
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,959
Don't be so annoying.

105
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:18,880
All right.

106
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,839
I've said everything I want to say.

107
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,720
As for the rest,

108
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,600
the rest.

109
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,920
By the way, Su Tian Tian,

110
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,280
tell Fu Chen

111
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,400
I broke up with him.

112
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,720
No violence.

113
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,400
Let's go.

114
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,159
Stop looking.

115
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,280
Let’s go.

116
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,360
Lin Shen.

117
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,520
Thank you.

118
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:01,880
For what?

119
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,880
Thank you

120
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,320
for standing up for me.

121
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,120
Thank you for being so righteous.

122
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,080
Are you crazy?

123
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,160
I don't know what you're talking about.

124
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,440
It's okay.

125
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,600
Take it as a parallel world.

126
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,760
You helped me.

127
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,720
let me feel the warmth

128
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,760
at the coldest moment.

129
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,720
Do you have time?

130
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,840
Can we talk?

131
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,200
Roger!

132
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,440
Maybe he's not

133
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,800
who can travel through time.

134
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,440
Looks like I've completely jumped out of the circle.

135
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,520
Everything is going in a good direction.

136
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,760
Zhou.

137
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,520
Zhou, are you okay?

138
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,680
Am I hallucinating?

139
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,760
If there's nothing else,

140
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:03,880
If there's nothing else, I'll go on patrol.

141
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,520
Lin Shen,

142
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,440
I want to ask you

143
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,520
about Zhou Yihuan.

144
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,400
Zhou Yihuan will have an accident in the future, right?

145
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,560
Why are you...

146
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:21,920
Not only that,

147
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,040
I also know

148
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,880
you are not from this time and space, right?

149
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,040
I don't know why.

150
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,400
When I was young,

151
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,760
I had strange dreams.

152
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,640
I can see the cause of death in my dreams.

153
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,240
I can't distinguish illusions from reality.

154
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,560
You may not understand.

155
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,159
When I was young,

156
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,120
every time I met a new friend,

157
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,560
these images will appear in front of me.

158
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,600
I couldn't do anything.

159
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,160
Later, I started to cut down social relations.

160
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,960
It's strange.

161
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,040
Since I was alone,

162
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,080
I never had these dreams again.

163
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,840
Until one day,

164
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,680
I dreamed that Zhou Yihuan had an accident.

165
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,120
No, it's not what you think.

166
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,160
You young people.

167
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,240
You mentioned parallel space and time.

168
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,400
and Zhou Yihuan.

169
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,800
So I guess

170
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,760
you are not from this time and space.

171
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,200
You appear here

172
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,680
to save Zhou Yihuan, right?

173
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,320
Huan Huan.

174
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,159
I didn't call you.

175
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,320
I'm calling a dog.

176
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,560
Are you crazy?

177
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,400
Go back to play games.

178
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,600
If you want to stop Zhou Yihuan's accident,

179
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,400
Only by saving Zhou Yihuan

180
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,000
can I return to my time and space.

181
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,400
Now,

182
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,240
I only know the time of Zhou Yihuan's death.

183
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,040
Thank you.

184
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,080
He was pushed down from the rooftop.

185
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,320
The way he died

186
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,920
is the same as my dream.

187
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,320
Tell me then.

188
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,880
Zhou Yihuan

189
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,159
Is there any enemy?

190
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,320
Enemy?

191
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,840
You're blocking my light.

192
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,000
My heart is black.

193
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,040
It won't shine anywhere.

194
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,640
Can't you change your seat?

195
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,600

and polite to others.

211
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,960
He's an idol of all girls in school.

212
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,760
Based on the current information,

213
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,000
he has no enemies.

214
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,160

Every time I approach him,

218
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,080
I was either reported by him

219
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,600
or scolded by him.

220
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,360
Maybe it's because he's too good.

221
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,040
people around him dare not approach him.

222
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,680
