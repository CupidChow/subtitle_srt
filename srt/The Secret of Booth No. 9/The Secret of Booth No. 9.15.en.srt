00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,800
Episode 15

2
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:26,880
I'm here.

3
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,280
the meaning of my life

4
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,520
because of you.

5
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,440
After all,

6
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,160
I came here because of you.

7
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,360
Let me do this.

8
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,720
How can you be so perfunctory

9
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,080
You're so perfunctory.

10
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,880
Please.

11
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,240
Can you show us?

12
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,280
It's not that I don't want to help you.

13
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,200
But look.

14
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,520
The CCTV is broken.

15
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,759
I have no choice.

16
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,000
What a coincidence!

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,160
Only these are broken.

18
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,800
The equipment is aging.

19
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,680
It can't be helped.

20
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,800
I'm really sorry.

21
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,759
Thank you.

22
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,960
Let's go.

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,520
I don't believe it's a coincidence.

24
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,040
Zhou Yihuan.

25
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,400
Just wait and see.

26
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,280
Actually, in my time,

27
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,840
Su Tian used the Star core

28
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,320
to become a top designer.

29
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,720
But now I'm sure

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,560
that

31
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,800
this plan is yours.

32
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,880
Stop investigating this.

33
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:41,920
About the plan,

34
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,000
I'll tell my dad.

35
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,640
That won't do.

36
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,120
Maybe this is

37
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,800
the trigger of your accident.

38
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,040
I'm fine now.

39
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,880
Don't worry.

40
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,480
If you're worried,

41
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,880
you can watch me 24 hours a day.

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,800
Bro.

43
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,800
Come here.

44
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,000
What is it?

45
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,200
just say it here.

46
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,120
Zhou Yihuan, it's none of your business.

47
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,920
Xiaomei,

48
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,080
I really have something important to tell you.

49
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,160
It's about Su Tian Tian.

50
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,520
Okay then.

51
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,280
Wait for me at the book cafe.

52
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,520
I'll come to you later.

53
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,240
I’ll wait for you there.

54
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,360
Xiaomei.

55
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,680
Plan?

56
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,160
should still be at the ball.

57
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,560
Let's look for it together.

58
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,520
Over there.

59
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,800
Hey.

60
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,600
Come here.

61
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,280
What are you doing?

62
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,560
Come back.

63
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,240
Auntie, we want to go in and find something.

64
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,840
We're closed now.

65
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,920
No one can enter.

66
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,240
Go back.

67
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,880
Miss.

68
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,840
I'm from the Department of Design.

69
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,200
I forgot my homework

70
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,400
I forgot my homework here.

71
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,440
Just let us in.

72
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,560
Otherwise, my exam will be over.

73
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,600
This young man is quite good at chatting.

74
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,040
I have a niece at home.

75
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,440
She's about your age.

76
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,399
How about

77
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,840
I have a girlfriend.

78
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:25,960
Okay.

79
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,040
Hurry up.

80
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,840
Come out if you find it.

81
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,320
Okay, thank you.

82
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,240
Thank you.

83
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,520
Be careful.

84
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,720
Where is your little pump?

85
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,080
Why did you leave alone

86
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,080
as soon as we got together?

87
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,440
Where is Chai?

88
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,640
You and your father are on your own.

89
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,159
I'm injured because of me.

90
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,680
I don't have time to walk Huan Huan.

91
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,960
Aunt Lu will take care of Huan Huan.

92
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,200
We can't let Shen Shen

93
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,360
take care of two of them alone.

94
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,200
About the plan,

95
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,560
What are you going to do?

96
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,280
No hurry.

97
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,400
Didn't Mr. Zhou give us three days?

98
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,720
Three days?

99
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,000
There are so many people at the ball.

100
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,440
How can we find out?

101
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,680
I suspect

102
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,400
the person who cast the screen

103
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,640
and the person who stole the plan

104
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,080
is probably the same person.

105
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,600
It should be Su Tian Tian.

106
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,680
However,

107
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,000
the surveillance equipment is aging.

108
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,400
There's no evidence yet.

109
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,600
Go find it now.

110
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,800
Why are you sitting here so calm?

111
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,080
Xiao Min has gone to investigate Su Tian Tian.

112
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,240
He asked us to wait for someone here.

113
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,640
Are you busy?

114
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,320
That day,

115
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,640
I saw Su Tian Tian

116
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,560
threw something away.

117
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,560
Now that I think about it,

118
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,840
it should be Zhou Yihuan's plan.

119
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,960
But it was heavily guarded that day.

120
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,080
she couldn't have taken it away.

121
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,440
Plus, the restaurant is closed these two days.

122
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,560
the plan must still be here.

123
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,440
I'll look for it there.

124
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,200
Wait for me here.

125
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,400
Thank you.

126
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,680
for helping me realize my wish.

127
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,040
Li guan and I

128
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,520
are already together.

129
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,880
The person you should thank the most

130
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,480
is Fang Xiaocheng who was bullied by you.

131
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,160
I know.

132
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,280
Actually,

133
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,560
I'm here today

134
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,920
to make up for

135
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,480
I know.

136
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,760
who cast the screen.

137
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:38,880
So,

138
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:40,960
the one who screened at the ball

139
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,520
should be Anki.

140
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,800
So exciting?

141
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,920
He Jing.

142
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,480
From what you know about Anki Wu,

143
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,360
does she look like someone who would steal the plan?

144
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,480
She is

145
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:54,800
usually

146
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,920
a little grumpy.

147
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,720
but he would never

148
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,720
such a sneaky thing.

149
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,600
We've searched everywhere.

150
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,400
There's nothing.

151
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:11,960
Could Su Tian Tian

152
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,800
has been taken by Su Tian Tian?

153
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,640
Let's go.

154
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,480
Okay.

155
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,320
I'm done talking.

156
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,400
I'll get going.

157
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,240
What is it?

158
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,840
Is the investigation not going well?

159
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,640
We still haven't found a plan.

160
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,440
Shall we

161
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,720
to confront Anki?

162
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,720
And Su Tian Tian.

163
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,480
Do we still need to investigate?

164
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,320
There's a new message on the official account.

165
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,159
Take a look.

166
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,920
This message is really interesting.

167
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:00,000
If the phone booth number nine

168
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,640
can really grant her wish,

169
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,480
Can you make her forgive me?

170
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,760
Could it be

171
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,760
Fu Chen wrote to Fang Xiaocheng?

172
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,200
How is that possible?
