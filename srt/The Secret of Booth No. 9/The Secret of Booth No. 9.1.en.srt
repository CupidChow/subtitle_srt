1
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,440
Fang Xiaomei.

2
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,840
Fang Xiaomei.

3
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,800
Who are you?

4
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,560
Where am I?

5
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,640
Don't be afraid.

6
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,760
Come with me.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,440
Why am I back in college?

8
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,480
Why am I here?

9
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,680
Shouldn't I be at the wedding?

10
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:08,600
Fu Chen.

11
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,120
How stingy you are!

12
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,280
It's a big day.

13
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,000
A wedding in such a shabby place

14
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,240
It was meant to be held on the lawn.

15
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,440
It just rained

16
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,039
so I moved here.

17
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:17,440
Stop.

18
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,800
What does Wang Yangming mean?

19
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,680
Witness.

20
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,400
It’s also Xiaomei’s idea

21
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,440
to hold a wedding at school.

22
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,240
Bro.

23
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,000
I’ve chosen a wedding place.

24
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,640
It's at the school lawn.

25
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,479
That's where we know each other.

26
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,640
It's very memorable.

27
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,600
What do you think?

28
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,479
Look, she's here.

29
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:40,280
Ask her if you don't believe me.

30
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,400
What's wrong?

31
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,240
What did you ask me?

32
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:44,720
I'll leave Wang Yang Ming alone.

33
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,440
How do you explain this?

34
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,280
You don't even have a proper wedding ring.

35
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,840
Why are you getting married?

36
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:52,759
Don't make it hard for Fu Chen.

37
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,840
So is he.

38
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,080
I really don't understand

39
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,560
What did Fu Chen do to you?

40
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,400
No.

41
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,560
Her parents passed away early.

42
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,400
But as long as I’m here,

43
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,120
if you treat her badly,

44
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,840
I'll never let you off.

45
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,680
Don’t worry.

46
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,919
I’ll be good to Xiao Chan.

47
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,160
Wait.

48
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,520
Su Tian Tian.

49
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,640
My college roommate.

50
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,560
She designed it before graduation.

51
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,440
the star core

52
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,560
The biggest design company in Mingchuan City

53
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,320
of Mingchuan City.

54
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,240
and become the Imperial Design Director.

55
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,160
Su Tian Tian.

56
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,280
Why are you here?

57
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,160
Fang Xiaomei.

58
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,760
You don't deserve Fu Chen.

59
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,960
How could you say that?

60
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,960
Why are you here?

61
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,400
Chen Chen.

62
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,960
1256. Why did you do that to piss me off?

63
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,240
Why did you

64
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,920
just to piss me off?

65
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,280
You...

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,760
Farewell.

67
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,360
Fu Chen.

68
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,880
Tian Tian said

69
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,440
she's willing to give you another chance.

70
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,920
As long as you leave with her today,

71
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,040
she will open you

72
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,160
for you.

73
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,320
Fang Xiaomei, listen to her.

74
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,280
Stop fighting!

75
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,480
Stop fighting!

76
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,240
Stop fighting!

77
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,040
Let go.

78
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,880
What?

79
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:41,440
Stop fighting!

80
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,320
What are you doing?

81
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,079
Stop fighting!

82
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:46,440
Stop fighting!

83
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,240
What's the meaning

84
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,160
in this life?

85
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,520
Zhou Yihuan.

86
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,079
Didn't he die

87
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,079
a few years ago?

88
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,560
Was that not a dream?

89
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,760
I came here because of him.

90
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,080
Why is Fang Xiaomei here?

91
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,080
Why is she here

92
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,280
the day I had an accident?

93
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,640
Could it be...

94
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,840
she's in the same circle as me?

95
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,520
Zhou Yihuan.

96
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,960
In broad daylight,

97
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,320
in broad daylight.

98
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,240
Did you remember something?

99
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,000
It seems that she didn't remember anything.

100
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,960
But this time,

101
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,400
how did she know I was going to die?

102
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,200
It's warm.

103
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,440
There's a shadow.

104
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,960
You're not a ghost.

105
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,480
Wait.

106
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,880
Am I dreaming?

107
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,440
It's not a dream.

108
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,600
What's going on?

109
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,560
You're not dead.

110
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,600
Isn't it 2023 now?

111
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:38,200
Have you read too many time travel novels?

112
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,720
Today is July 13th, 2018.

113
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,440
Friday.

114
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,840
I just finished the final exam.

115
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:46,240
Do you remember now?

116
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,680
I have something to do.

117
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,600
See you.

118
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,120
Wait.

119
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,640
Are you done?

120
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,960
I can go anywhere I want.

121
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,280
What's wrong with you?

122
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,280
Mind your own business.

123
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,000
I know what I'm saying now

124
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,920
what I'm saying now.

125
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,360
But I'm not teasing you.

126
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,400
To be honest,

127
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,520
I might have travelled through time.

128
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,040
Look.

129
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,640
Is that Fang Xiaomei in our class?

130
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,360
No.

131
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,200
You want to attract my attention

132
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,320
in a special way.

133
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,600
Like this.

134
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,520
Suddenly

135
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,520
in front of me.

136
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,080
Unfortunately,

137
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,240
I've seen many of these moves.

138
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,440
You misunderstood.

139
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,560
I really came from 2023.

140
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,840
I don't know what happened.

141
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,480
When I open my eyes,

142
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,320
until now.

143
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,160
Are you done?

144
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:31,880
No.

145
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:32,840
By the way,

146
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,560
in my time,

147
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,240
in my time.

148
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,680
Then how did I die?

149
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,840
When did I die?

150
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,240
The specific reason

151
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,800
The school

152
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,920
didn't reveal it yet.

153
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,680
And it's been so many years.

154
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I don't remember

155
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,560
I don't really remember.

156
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,400
Mr. Security.

157
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,560
Look at that girl.

158
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,040
That girl.

159
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,760
harassed Zhou Yihuan.

160
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,720
Catch her!

161
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,560
Just trust me.

162
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,600
Hey.

163
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,600
Let's go.

164
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,520
Come with me to the office.

165
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,560
Is she in danger?

166
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,680
Trust me.

167
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,200
I'd better follow him.

168
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:11,840
Let's go.

169
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,040
It’s not what you think.

170
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,440
Lin Shen.

171
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,120
Are you familiar with it?

172
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,880
Not really.

173
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,440
Mister.

174
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,040
It's really not what you think.

175
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,000
You don't have to say anything.

176
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,640
I understand.

177
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,320
At your age,

178
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,280
Yeah handsome

179
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,080
and smart.

180
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,200
It's normal

181
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,840
is very normal.

182
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,200
Back then,

183
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,080
I felt the same way.

184
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,200
I miss you.

185
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,440
Me too.

186
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,760
Tian Tian, you're so pretty.

187
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,159
I like you so much.

188
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:50,800
Tell the director yourself.

189
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,720
It's really not.

190
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,280
So Fu Chen and Su Tian Tian

191
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,400
are already together.

192
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,200
Bro.

193
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,120
Let me explain.

194
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,720
Bro.

195
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,720
