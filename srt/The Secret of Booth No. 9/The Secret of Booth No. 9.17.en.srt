1
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,160
I called the police.

2
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,960
If you don't want to cause trouble,

3
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,560
if you don't want to cause trouble.

4
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:33,280
Call the police.

5
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,200
What's wrong with calling the police?

6
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,600
What reason?

7
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,280
Anki's father is in debt.

8
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,000
It has nothing to do with her.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,800
That's right.

10
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,280
What does that have to do with you?

11
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,160
You followed her and blackmailed her

12
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,640
and threaten her personal safety.

13
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,920
Without paying,

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,440
without paying.

15
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,720
and used nether coins on purpose.

16
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,520
is considered a crime of fraud and theft.

17
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,360
and many crimes.

18
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,640
Do you know the consequences?

19
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,720
What consequences?

20
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,080
What consequences?

21
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,560
Just you wait.

22
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:05,680
I'm excited.

23
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,120
Wait.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,800
Lin Shen.

25
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,960
Why did you ask me to come here in the middle of the night?

26
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,280
You stole Zhou Yihuan's design plan, right?

27
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,480
How is that possible?

28
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,560
Didn’t Fang Xiaocheng steal the plan?

29
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,760
Did you hear anything from someone?

30
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,880
Zhou Yihuan admitted

31
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,560
Fang Xiaomei is his girlfriend.

32
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,240
How dare you frame others?

33
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,440
It’s not me.

34
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:35,800
Lu Tianlang.

35
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:37,080
Why are you here?

36
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:38,920
Su Tian Tian.

37
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:39,840
Don't play dumb.

38
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,840
Hand over Zhou Yihuan's plan.

39
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,000
What are you talking about?

40
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,840
Do you have evidence?

41
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,680
Don't slander me.

42
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,000
Don't cry until you enter the coffin.

43
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,000
Look.

44
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,520
Isn't this the ring you're wearing?

45
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,160
There are many similar rings.

46
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,800
This can't prove anything.

47
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,760
Fu Chen is willing to prove it for Fang Xiaocheng.

48
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,680
Fu Chen.

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,120
How could it be possible?

50
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,520
Tian Tian.

51
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,920
Zhou Yihuan, Fang Xiaomei.

52
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,200
Thank you for today.

53
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,160
You're welcome.

54
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,040
Actually,

55
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,720
the video of the ball was me.

56
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,440
Actually,

57
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,560
already knew.

58
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,440
You already know

59
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,560
Anki Wu.

60
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,640
Who sent you that video?

61
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,320
The sender of the video is anonymous.

62
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,600
He said if I agree to do this,

63
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,000
he would give me some money.

64
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,440
As you know,

65
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,240
I need money right now.

66
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,560
Who hates me so much?

67
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,680
Or his target is

68
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,720
Zhou Yihuan.

69
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,320
Is it...

70
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,920
No.

71
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,240
But why did he do it at the scene?

72
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,360
Fang Xiaomei,

73
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,280
Can I ask you

74
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,320
Can I ask you for a favor?

75
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,600
Of course.

76
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,320
What's your wish?

77
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,280
Miss Wu,

78
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,480
Can you ask He Jing to forgive me?

79
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,000
You posted

80
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:23,960
You sent it.

81
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,120
If the phone booth number nine

82
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,560
can really grant her wish,

83
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,240
Can you let her forgive me?

84
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,400
So there was a misunderstanding

85
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,360
was a misunderstanding.

86
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,160
Bring out the plan.

87
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,240
I saw

88
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,320
what happened that day.

89
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,520
Fu Chen.

90
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,720
Tian Tian.

91
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,120
Don't call me.

92
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,000
Fu Chen.

93
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,600
Have you ever loved me?

94
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,040
Or

95
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,040
I’m just a tool for you to provoke Fang Xiaomei?

96
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,160
What about you?

97
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,920
You're really in love with Chen Chen.

98
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,040
Or do you have an ulterior motive?

99
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,320
Su Tian Tian.

100
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,120
I've seen a lot of people like you.

101
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,519
Taking down Zhou Yihuan and Lu Tianlang

102
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,800
to defeat Zhou Yihuan and Lu Tianlang.

103
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,120
Fu Chen.

104
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,080
I can try.

105
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,240
Tian Tian.

106
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,200
If it weren't for you,

107
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,040
how long

108
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,760
are still

109
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,280
you are still protecting Fang Xiaomei.

110
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,000
Fu Chen.

111
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,600
Stop pretending.

112
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,960
You can't take a slap.

113
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,360
Aren't you responsible?

114
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,040
Can you say you don’t like me?

115
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,120
Do you dare to say that you are loyal to him?

116
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,280
Two-faced.

117
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,120
I deserve it.

118
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,120
Tian Tian.

119
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,120
Stop making mistakes.

120
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,640
It’s all my fault.

121
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,160
I hurt you,

122
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,320
and you.

123
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,760
In my memory,

124
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,280
Anki Wu became a joke in school.

125
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,360
and became close to Su Tian Tian.

126
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,400
Afterwards, Anki's family went bankrupt.

127
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,800
Su Tiantian changed the situation

128
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,080
the situation between the two has completely changed.

129
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,920
If I can find the person who stole the plan this time,

130
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,520
maybe I can change Zhou Yihuan's ending.

131
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:32,920
Anki.

132
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,040
Since you chose to apologize,

133
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,360
why don't you

134
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,560
in person?

135
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,680
It'll be awkward to apologize face to face.

136
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,960
Besides,

137
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,400
what if she doesn't forgive me?

138
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,680
The plan is at the ball.

139
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,159
Go find it yourselves.

140
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,720
I've looked everywhere.

141
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,760
There's nothing.

142
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,640
How is that possible?

143
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:02,920
How about

144
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,520
ask the security guard?

145
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,560
Back then,

146
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,520
he reminded me to take the plan.

147
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,960
That's all I know.

148
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,920
I took the plan

149
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,120
was for Fu Chen.

150
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,800
Now it seems

151
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,160
there's no need for that.

152
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:19,960
Tian Tian.

153
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,240
Tian Tian.

154
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:24,840
I knew it.

155
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,080
Giving up on love

156
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,080
This IQ

157
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,840
come up at once.

158
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,240
Let's go to the supermarket.

159
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,120
Are you okay with that?

160
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,880
Let's go.

161
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,520
Anki.

162
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,960
If you want to be forgiven,

163
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,120
don't be afraid of embarrassment.

164
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,600
We'll help you with this.

165
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,720
Really?

166
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,440
That's great.

167
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,840
When are you going to do this?

168
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,840
What are you going to do?

169
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,280
Let me tell you.

170
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,280
don't make the atmosphere awkward.

171
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,520
But we can't rush it.

172
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,800
Does He Jing like dolls?

173
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,160
or something?

174
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,120
The atmosphere is right.

175
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,880
I think the atmosphere is very important.

176
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,680
