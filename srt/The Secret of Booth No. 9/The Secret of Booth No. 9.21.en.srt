1
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,520
Why am I here again?

2
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,360
Isn't this Roger's room?

3
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,080
When we were at the karaoke,

4
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,920
Zhou Yihuan didn't die.

5
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,760
But I still travelled through time.

6
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,440
Could all of this

7
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,040
because of Roger?

8
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,800
What's wrong with your leg?

9
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,039
Who are you now?

10
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,320
That lame Roger...

11
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,360
Roger from another time and space!

12
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,240
What?!

13
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,760
Two Roger!

14
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,320
I've investigated everything

15
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,920
Cripple Roger Zhou Yihuan

16
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,160
An accident

17
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,400
And you came here

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,560
because of the telephone booth No. 9.

19
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,840
Phone booth No.9

20
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,039
can connect two dimensions.

21
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,320
But to open it,

22
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,640
you need strong love

23
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,160
or resentment.

24
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,080
It seems that Zi Qi's death

25
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,400
is the key to all this.

26
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,479
But what kind of love and resentment

27
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:38,240
caused all this?

28
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,840
Back then, Cripple Roger

29
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:42,240
because he couldn't accept Ziqi's death.

30
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:44,840
He blamed everything

31
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,920
blame Zhou Yihuan

32
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,400
who didn't answer the phone.

33
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,240
chasing Zhou Yihuan over and over again.

34
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,840
Fortunately, you showed up

35
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,320
you saved Zhou Yihuan

36
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,360
with love.

37
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,479
I understand

38
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,040
The resentment of Cripple Roger brought us here

39
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,040
and hurt Zhou Yihuan

40
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,480
And my accident

41
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,720
changed the direction.

42
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,479
What can I do to end this?

43
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,680
and save Zhou Yihuan?

44
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,920
You used to be in another time and space

45
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,360
came to G.E.M.

46
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,640
the moment of the accident.

47
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,600
Roger who replaced that time and space

48
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,760
saved Zhou Yihuan.

49
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,320
That's why

50
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,160
didn't get hurt.

51
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,480
But

52
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,200
Ziqi passed away.

53
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,280
So Roger

54
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,640
in different dimensions.

55
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,800
and kind Roger.

56
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,400
Just like you,

57
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,640
can travel through time

58
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,760
and infiltrate Roger's body.

59
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,960
Because of you,

60
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,440
because of you.

61
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,040
That's why there's good, evil, Roger, and me.

62
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,360
If you want to change the ending,

63
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,160
You have to make a choice like me.

64
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,440
Go!

65
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,200
Go!

66
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,320
I'm back.

67
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,160
I want to change everything quickly.

68
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,360
Time is limited.

69
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,400
I'll cut to the chase.

70
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,360
Zhou Yihuan.

71
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,400
I like you.

72
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,200
I've liked you for a long time.

73
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,920
Uncle security, look.

74
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,520
He Jing, Anki Wu.

75
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,840
Security, come here.

76
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:30,880
What?

77
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,680
Security.

78
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,160
The Zhou Yihuan I harassed.

79
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,320
Take me away.

80
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:35,840
What?

81
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,400
How could she steal my lines?

82
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,800
Yeah.

83
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,680
You stole my lines too.

84
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,960
What else can I say?

85
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,360
Lin Shen.

86
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,760
Are you familiar with it?

87
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,520
Not really.

88
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,200
Dumpling.

89
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,240
Fu Chen.

90
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,320
Whether it's me,

91
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,320
Su Tian Tian

92
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,080
or your baby?

93
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,480
If you like someone,

94
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,600
when you like someone.

95
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,160
and play with other people's feelings.

96
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,280
It's not cool at all.

97
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:16,640
No.

98
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,200
Sorry, sorry.

99
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,120
Xiaomei, I...

100
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,279
Fu Chen.

101
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,720
Which other treasure do you have?

102
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,320
Well...

103
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,120
Lulu.

104
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,960
Xin.

105
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,400
Cool.

106
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,000
Paper

107
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Well,

108
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,200
Mr. Zhou, that's what happened.

109
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,640
Look at you girls.

110
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,240
look like.

111
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,480
Mr. Zhou.

112
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,360
If there's nothing else,

113
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,120
I'll get back to work.

114
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,080
Go ahead.

115
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:03,800
BA029.

116
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,520
BA029.

117
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,440
It's you.

118
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,200
What are you doing?

119
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,880
I’m warning you.

120
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,320
Stay away from Fang Xiaocheng.

121
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,000
You want to know?

122
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,760
Come with me.

123
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,480
Zhou Yihuan

124
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,920
is an excellent student representative of our school.

125
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,440
I've warned you seriously.

126
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,400
Stop, Mr. Zhou.

127
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,600
I've heard that.

128
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,920
I gotta go.

129
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,520
Roger

130
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,480
If you hurt Zhou Yihuan again

131
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,600
or threaten him,

132
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,159
I won't let you go.

133
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,720
Do you think

134
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,360
can stop this?

135
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,560
There's only you and me on the rooftop.

136
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,920
If you jump from here now,

137
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,600
you'll be the first suspect.

138
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,600
And before I came here,

139
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,480
I've already

140
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,320
on the alumni website.

141
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,000
From now on,

142
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,080
you can't hide yourself as a security guard anymore.

143
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,880
Zhou Yihuan.

144
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,840
I hope this time

145
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,480
this time.

146
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,280
This will be the end.

147
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,640
I'm older than you.

148
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:56,400
I miss you so much.

149
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,200
I miss you too.

150
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,600
I'm sorry.

151
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,400
I never blamed you.

152
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,800
Take care.

153
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,040
Come here.

154
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,240
Here.

155
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,159

and take a photo.

157
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,799
Make a wish.

158
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:34,960
Come on.

159
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,240
Propose! Propose!

160
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,920
Answer it!

161
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,480
