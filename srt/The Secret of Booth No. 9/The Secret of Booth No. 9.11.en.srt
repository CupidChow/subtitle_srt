1
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,600
Bro.

2
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,240
You must be surprised

3
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,720
Surprised, right?

4
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:33,160
Accident?

5
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,520
Not really.

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,840
You surprised me.

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,280
That night,

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,120
you were the one

9
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:40,960
is you, right?

10
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,680
Who is it?

11
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,080
He Jing.

12
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,800
Everyone has their own troubles.

13
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,960
I just didn't expect

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,120
you're our first client.

15
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,960
I didn't expect

16
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,319
you would help me.

17
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,040
After all,

18
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,880
I bullied you

19
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,400
bullied you.

20
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,400
No matter what,

21
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,200
since

22
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,720
has become our client,

23
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,360
We will do our best

24
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,120
to fulfill your wish.

25
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,280
Yes, He Jing.

26
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,400
Just say it.

27
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,400
Come with me.

28
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,160
Let go of my mom.

29
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:25,840
Come back with me.

30
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,840
No.

31
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,360
Get in.

32
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,760
Get out!

33
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,200
I told you to run!

34
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,560
Let go of my mom!

35
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,000
Run!

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Let her go!

37
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,280
You two get lost.

38
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,120
and never come back.

39
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,200
You jinx.

40
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,280
You loser!

41
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,360
Get as far as you can.

42
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,840
It should be here.

43
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:08,960
Look

44
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,440
Is that Nanny Fan?

45
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,120
That's He.

46
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,800
Please come in.

47
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,720
He Jing.

48
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,560
He Jing.

49
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,000
Hurry up.

50
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,880
What's wrong?

51
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,920
These clothes are for you.

52
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,200
Just keep them.

53
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,400
Don’t thank me.

54
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,040
WAIL

55
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:32,360
All.

56
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,960
Let me tell you.

57
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,079
these clothes are expensive.

58
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,640
At least your mother

59
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,200
three months' salary.

60
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,760
Take it and wear it.

61
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,680
Thank you.

62
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,440
Get me a glass of water before you go.

63
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,320
You're blocking me from sunbathing.

64
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,760
I want some water.

65
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,720
What's wrong with you?

66
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,280
You can't even massage properly.

67
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,079
Throw these shoes away for me

68
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,440
So dirty.

69
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,640
Get the clothes.

70
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,600
So

71
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,360
Anki and I

72
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,520
look good friends.

73
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,160
but I'm the only one who knows.

74
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,800
I'm just

75
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,320
a servant of her.

76
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,720
Just like my mom.

77
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,800
just like my mom.

78
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,000
I know I shouldn't complain

79
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,280
After all, it's Anki's house.

80
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,040
She gave me

81
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,400
to live with my mom.

82
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,240
But...

83
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,040
But...

84
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,160
I'm just sad.

85
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,440
I'm a girl too.

86
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,040
But every time...

87
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,040
Every time

88
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,360
by Anki's side,

89
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,440
I can only be

90
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,519
as a green leaf that suits her.

91
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,720
Do you think

92
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,720
Am I too greedy?

93
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,320
But I just want to try again.

94
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,760
I want to live a different life.

95
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,040
Don't do anything

96
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,960
[what you don't want.]

97
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,920
Since you've experienced

98
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,960
being bullied,

99
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,960
Why do we have to do the same thing

100
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,480
do the same thing?

101
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,840
Bro.

102
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,159
Sorry.

103
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,240
It's okay.

104
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,360
It's all in the past.

105
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,360
Since the past can't be changed,

106
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,640
then from now on,

107
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,320
live for yourself bravely.

108
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,120
So what is your wish?

109
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,480
I want to be

110
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,800
of this summer ball.

111
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,120
I'm going to stop Zhou Yihuan

112
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,280
to be the star of love.

113
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,560
Why don't we take the risk?

114
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,640
How about this?

115
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,040
Let Zhou Yihuan

116
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,560
to be your partner for the summer ball.

117
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,240
Really?

118
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,720
But we have a condition.

119
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,960
What is it?

120
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,880
After we help you fulfill your wish,

121
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,760
you have to answer us a question.

122
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,800
As long as you can help me fulfill my wish,

123
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,640
I’m willing to do anything.

124
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,040
Fang Xiaomei.

125
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,440
No means no.

126
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,600
Please.

127
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,480
Please, Zhou Yihuan.

128
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,320
Fang Xiaomei.

129
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,720
No wonder you took Zhou Yihuan to join Yuanmeng Club.

130
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,520
So that's your plan.

131
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,560
Let Zhou Yihuan

132
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,680
to be your tool.

133
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,520
What's wrong with being a tool?

134
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,080
You didn't even help me.

135
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,520
Cheapskate.

136
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,560
A favor?

137
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,560
Do you know what this prom represents?

138
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,520
A small favor.

139
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,360
Fang Xiaomei,

140
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,040
Have you considered my feelings?

141
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,800
Are you worried

142
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,480
the prom will affect you

143
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,720
or what?

144
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,960
Do you really want me

145
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,400
to be He Jing's dance partner?

146
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,400
Of course.

147
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,560
If you can come this time,

148
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,680
our wish order

149
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,000
will be done easily.

150
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,560
If Zhou Yihuan is willing to be He Jing's partner,

151
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,159
it'll definitely be an explosive news in Ming Da.

152
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,000
He Jing.

153
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,080
Zhou Yihuan.

154
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,600
It reminds me of you.

155
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,600
I don't think so.

156
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,440
He Jing doesn't deserve to be Zhou Yihuan's partner.

157
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,240
She just wants to be seen by more people.

158
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,520
Don't tell me

159
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,720
you want He Jing

160
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,159
to be a star in campus?

161
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,560
Why not?

162
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,920
People shouldn't be bound by single standards.

163
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,880
I want you to know

164
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,800
apart from delicate appearance,

165
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,160
and slim figure,

166
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,440
there are many beauties.

167
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,880
Every girl can shine brightly.

168
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,560
This time,

169
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,760
with the influence of Zhou Yihuan,

170
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,400
He Jing can stand on the stage.

171
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,520
maybe

172
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,880
become the star of love.

173
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,720
Fang Xiaocheng.

174
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,800
Why don’t you understand this?

175
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,200
Just tell me.

176
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,320
Summer Ball in Ming University.

177
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,320
It's also called "Heartbeat Dance".

178
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,800
It's supposed to dance with someone who's excited.

179
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,000
In other words,

180
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,760
we'll be dancing partners that day.

181
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,680
We all like each other.

182
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,760
Zhou Yihuan doesn't want to be He Jing's partner.

183
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,880
because of you.

184
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,280
Lu Tianlang, what are you talking about?

185
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,760
How could I not know?

186
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,600
But saving you now

187
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,159
is more important than anything.

188
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,040
Fang Xiaomei,

189
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,280
I promise you.

190
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,080
Are you looking for me?

191
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,520
Yihuan is back.

192
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,640
Accompany me.

193
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,440
with Dad.

194
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:41,679
Actor table.

195
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,320
