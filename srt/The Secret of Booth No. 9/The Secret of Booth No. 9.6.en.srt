1
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,720
Someone prepared it for me.

2
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,640
Give me breakfast.

3
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:39,600
Breakfast.

4
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,200
This is for you.

5
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,840
Stop looking. It's not for you.

6
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,360
Eat.

7
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:44,840
What?

8
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,400
It's not for you.

9
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,040
Smells good.

10
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,400
I’ll kill you.

11
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,200
Lu Tianlang.

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,680
I’ll copy the notes later.

13
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,720
Sure, no problem.

14
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,440
Have some.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,800
Okay.

16
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,920
I'll return it to you in the next class.

17
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,880
So annoying.

18
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,000
The summer star's ball is about to begin.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,960
I don't know

20
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,120
this time.

21
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:14,960
Who else could it be?

22
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,320
It must be Zhou Yihuan.

23
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,960
But last time, Lu Tianlang and Zhou Yihuan

24
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,880
are only two votes short.

25
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,480
This time, it might exceed.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What the hell?

27
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,400
I don't care.

28
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,760
You have no taste.

29
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,120
Lin Shen.

30
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,840
In this summer ball,

31
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,200
if Zhou Yihuan is a heart-fluttering star,

32
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,000
wouldn't it be too much hatred for him?

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,240
What can we do?

34
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:36,600
After all,

35
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,240
Zhou Yihuan is really famous

36
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,479
in Ming University.

37
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:42,960
What should I do

38
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,759
to stop Zhou Yihuan from being the star of love?

39
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,840
It seems that the public account needs to hurry up.

40
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,039
Anki, are you okay?

41
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,120
Help what?

42
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,360
Pick up my phone.

43
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,720
I can't spare my hands.

44
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,520
What are you talking about?

45
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,920
You don't want

46
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,000
this month's salary?

47
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:06,960
Angel

48
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,479
Is the sponsor of this summer ball

49
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,639
is still your house?

50
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,560
Of course.

51
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,080
It's always sponsored by her dad.

52
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,960
Big mouth

53
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,720
Will you die if you keep quiet

54
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,160
Angel

55
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm speaking for you

56
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,800
I don't need you to talk.

57
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,400
Are you blind?

58
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:38,920
I'm sorry.

59
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,840
Are you okay?

60
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,480
Anki.

61
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,640
Your coat is dirty.

62
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,280
I left in a hurry.

63
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,720
Let me clean it for you.

64
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm Li guan from Class 2.

65
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,440
Li guan.

66
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:49,880
My name is...

67
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,760
What are you doing?

68
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,920
Class begins.

69
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,240
Go in.

70
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:57,800
Li guan.

71
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,040
Isn't this Anki's campus card?

72
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,440
You know her?

73
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,240
Everyone in Ming University knows her.

74
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,320
A rich and beautiful girl.

75
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,640
You, Li guan,

76
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,560
A straight A student.

77
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,560
I know nothing.

78
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,480
Anki.

79
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,680
Class begins.

80
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,440
You kids

81
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,600
only care about useless things.

82
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,840
Just

83
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,200
pay more attention to your grades.

84
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,440
This semester's final exam

85
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,760
If you don't pass,

86
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,920
I'll personally teach you.

87
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,280
You tutor them yourself?

88
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,280
I might as well fail the exam.

89
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,880
It's fine if you don't want me to tutor you.

90
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,680
Then try to improve yourself.

91
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,760
If you don't have solid basics,

92
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,880
go to the studio more often.

93
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,440
If you don't understand,

94
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,760
find good students in class

95
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,160
in class.

96
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,760
It's a good idea to ask Zhou Yihuan for tutoring.

97
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,400
He can't refuse me now, right?

98
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,080
Lin Shen.

99
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,360
Give it to Zhou Yihuan.

100
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,399
Give it to Zhou Yihuan.

101
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:21,959
For whom?

102
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,760
Lin Shen said to give this to Zhou Yihuan.

103
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,560
to Zhou Yihuan.

104
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,280
Just say it was given by Fang Xiaomei.

105
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,640
Why can’t you give it to me yourself?

106
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:54,800
Hurry up.

107
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,640
Fang Xiaomei.

108
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,000
Fang Xiaomei.

109
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,080
I saw it.

110
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,120
Stay away from me.

111
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,840
Don't you understand?

112
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,360
He said he broke up with you.

113
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,840
Lu Tianlang.

114
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,040
What are you doing?

115
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,880
You asked me to come to the rooftop.

116
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,560
Yes.

117
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:50,960
What is it?

118
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,680
Tell me.

119
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,680
What do you think?

120
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,480
I'll leave if there's nothing else.

121
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,400
I advise you

122
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,000
stay away from her.

123
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,720
You like her?

124
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,480
Yes.

125
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,320
And she likes me.

126
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,840
To be honest,

127
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,080
That letter

128
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,600
from her.

129
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,000
I have nothing

130
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,280
has nothing to do with me.

131
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,280
If you really like her,

132
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,720
let her

133
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,880
leave me alone.

134
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,960
That's good.

135
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,040
Zhou Yihuan.

136
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,080
Don't forget what you just said.

137
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,800
Are you okay?

138
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,280
Just now...

139
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,000
Did he threaten you

140
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,440
threaten you about the summer ball?

141
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,240
Nothing.

142
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,600
Zhou Yihuan.

143
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,480
Why don't you give up?

144
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,840
You can give Lu Tianlang

145
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,120
to Lu Tianlang.

146
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,400
You care so much about him?

147
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,080
No.

148
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,360
I'm just worried.

149
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,160
Don't worry.

150
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,520
I'm not interested

151
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,160
I'm not interested in this kind of activity.

152
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,680
Why is this security man

153
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,280
Why is he staring at us?

154
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,120
Looks like

155
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,360
the way to paste

156
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,400
still doesn't work.

157
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,440
What are you doing?

158
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,840
Hello.

159
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,440
I'm Li Guan from Class 2.

160
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,840
Don't get me wrong.

161
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,560
I'm here to give you something.

162
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,720
What is it?

163
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,040
I want you

164
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,120
give this to Anki from Class 8.

165
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,800
I hope she can be my dance partner

166
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,720
at the summer ball.

167
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,280
And this card.

168
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,440
I found this.

169
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,960
Please return it to her too.

170
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,600
The campus card is fine.

171
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,400
You should give her the invitation yourself.

172
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,520
Please.

173
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,840
This is the first time

174
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,440
inviting girls to a ball.

175
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,840
Okay.

176
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,760
We can give this to her.

177
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,440
But we don't know

178
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,560
we're not sure.

179
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,880
I'm grateful

180
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,280
to give it to her.

181
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,400
Thank you.

182
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,520
You're welcome.

183
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,680
That's Anki.

184
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,440
The ball hasn't started yet

185
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,120
before the ball starts.

186
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,680
But it's normal.

187
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,600
The summer ball

188
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,240
is popular in Myungdae

189
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,400
because of the dance part inside.

190
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,880
Everyone

191
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,720
want to

192
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,840
with someone they like.

193
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,799
Zhou Yi, Lu Tianlang and Anki Wu

194
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,159
have always been invited the most.

195
