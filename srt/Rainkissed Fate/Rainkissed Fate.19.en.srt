00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,820
=Episode 19=

3
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,200
The man from six years ago

4
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,350
is He Yuchen.

5
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,200
He's the father of
Bu Sheng and Bu Xiang.

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,600
Are you saying she ran away

7
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:57,790
because of that man?

8
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,120
I think you wouldn't

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,040
want Bu Yan to spend her life

10
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,590
with someone like him.

11
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,430
If you agree...

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,840
Open the door!

13
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,790
Dad, it's Bu Yan.

14
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,150
Can you hear me?

15
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,210
Open the door!

16
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,730
Dad, open the door.

17
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm curious

18
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:36,950
who's yelling

19
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,390
outside our house
in the middle of the night.

20
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,280
Isn't this the former Miss Bu?

21
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,150
You caused Hongfu's stock to plummet,

22
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,680
and now you have the nerve
to show up here?

23
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,870
- Get out.
- Move aside.

24
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,350
I want to see my dad.

25
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,070
Still think you're the Bu Family heiress?

26
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,200
Get out. Don't let this stray dog in.

27
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,040
Yes, madam.

28
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,880
- Leave.
- Step aside.

29
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,400
Stop her.

30
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:59,790
Dad!

31
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,120
- Bu Yan.
- Get out!

32
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,070
This is not a place you can just walk into.

33
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,000
You've been kicked out.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
- Your dad's resting.
- Mr. Bu.

35
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,230
- Move aside.
- Don't disturb him.

36
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,240
- I'll step aside.
- Dad!

37
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,430
- Stop right there.
- Dad!

38
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,630
The conversation between us.

39
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:11,790
Don't stop me.

40
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,190
I hope you won't mention this to Bu Yan.

41
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,030
Move aside.

42
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,890
Bu Yan.

43
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,360
Dad!

44
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,680
Let go of me.

45
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,240
Don't stop me.

46
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,500
- Get out.
- Dad.

47
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,030
Dad.

48
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,680
Get out.

49
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,520
You get out.

50
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,030
Dad.

51
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,560
Yuchen's mother's in a coma.

52
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,560
The doctor says she's at risk

53
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,800
if we don't operate now.

54
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,360
But the only one who can do this surgery

55
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,750
is your old friend, Dr. Guo.

56
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,800
Please, her life's at stake,
I need your help!

57
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,630
Yan, you were pregnant out of wedlock,

58
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,470
and you severed ties with your dad

59
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,150
just to give birth to
those two illegitimate kids.

60
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,910
We thought you'd change

61
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,280
after going through hardships,

62
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,840
but what did your dad get?

63
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,840
You once again, for a Man,

64
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,710
disregarded Hongfu's reputation,

65
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,960
set up your own brother,

66
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,240
and caused Hongfu's stock to plummet.

67
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,240
I set up Bu Jingyang?

68
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,270
Sun Zheng,

69
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,400
your son slandered others
for using banned substances

70
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,400
and fixed matches.

71
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,310
Did he consider Hongfu's reputation

72
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,960
while doing these things?

73
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,150
People should take responsibility
for their actions.

74
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,750
The company's interests always come first.

75
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,080
Now you have your own business too.

76
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,560
Don't you understand this principle?

77
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,470
Dad, I don't want
to discuss business philosophy

78
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,800
with you at this moment.

79
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,590
Just promise you'll help me,

80
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,800
and I'll agree to anything.

81
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,240
Anything?

82
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,400
Two conditions.

83
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,550
First,

84
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,960
use your company's shares

85
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,560
to cover the Group's losses.

86
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,520
Alright.

87
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,710
I'll exchange 51%

88
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,430
of my company's shares.

89
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,750
- Is that enough?
- You!

90
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,590
Your company is your foundation,

91
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,190
your livelihood.

92
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,430
Plus, you have two kids to support.

93
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,590
For a man,

94
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,870
you're giving it all up?

95
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,000
Money can be earned again,

96
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,310
but a person once lost is gone for good.

97
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,190
- You.
- You are really generous.

98
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,680
Those who don't know,

99
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,840
would think that Mrs. He

100
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,190
is your real mom.

101
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,590
Dad.

102
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,560
Mrs. He's illness

103
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,630
was because of the fixed match Incident.

104
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,520
Her condition today

105
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,400
is a responsibility
that Hongfu cannot shirk.

106
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,190
This is the compensation we should provide.

107
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,200
Guards!

108
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,360
Have this ungrateful daughter kicked out!

109
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,830
Dad, you tell me

110
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,600
taking responsibility
is the most important thing.

111
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,060
Let go of me, Dad.

112
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,070
- Go.
- Dad.

113
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,110
Let go of me.

114
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,520
Open the door.

115
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:51,710
Dad.

116
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,870
If you think it's my fault,

117
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,440
I admit it.

118
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,190
As long as you are willing to save Mrs. He.

119
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,600
It's all my fault.

120
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,390
I beg you.

121
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,720
I beg you.

122
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,870
Save He Yuchen's mother.

123
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,610
Dad, I beg you.

124
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,800
You've seen how she is.

125
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,800
- She's always had this temper.
- Dad.

126
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,630
I've already scolded her enough.

127
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,040
Let's do as you said.

128
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,870
Okay.

129
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,520
Hello, Dr. Guo,

130
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,390
I need a favor from you.

131
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,760
Dad.

132
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,350
Dad.

133
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:46,670
Please.

134
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,630
I beg you.

135
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,630
It's all my fault.

136
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,470
Dad.

137
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,120
I beg you.

138
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,400
Dad!

139
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,560
Dad!

140
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:10,800
Please...

141
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,390
Yuchen.

142
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,190
Yuchen.

143
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,840
Yuchen.

144
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,110
Yuchen.

145
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,080
Mrs. He...

146
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,560
Mrs. He...

147
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,430
Mrs. He will be fine.

148
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,680
The elderly doctor just now.

149
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,920
He is Dr. Guo.

150
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,520
With him here,

151
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,240
Mrs. He will definitely be fine.

152
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,920
You found Dr. Guo?

153
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:47,770
That's great.

154
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:49,920
Yes...

155
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,510
I want to help you.

156
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,430
You don't need to worry about it.

157
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,390
Yuchen.

158
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,160
Wenli saved your mom.

159
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,120
You can't let her down again.

160
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,720
She has devoted her heart to you.

161
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,640
Auntie,

162
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,830
this is what I should do.

163
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,510
Didn't Dean Guo retire?

164
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,070
Who did you find to get him?

165
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,840
Yuchen,

166
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:14,800
what do you mean by asking this?

167
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,920
You think it was Bu Yan who got him?

168
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,600
Yuchen.

169
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,390
I went to our group's Mr. Deng.

170
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,310
I really put in a lot of effort

171
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,680
to get Dr. Guo.

172
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,630
How could you...

173
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,680
Yuchen.

174
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,560
That Bu Yan

175
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,480
is just a

176
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,310
disgraced heiress
who was kicked out of her home.

177
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,430
How could she possibly invite Dr. Guo?

178
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,920
Besides, when your Mom fell ill,

179
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,600
she just disappeared.

180
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,680
It was Wenli who was busy running around,

181
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,830
helping you contact Dr, Guo.

182
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,120
You need to thank her.

183
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,920
Auntie, Bu Yan is my wife.

184
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,270
I don't want to hear any more

185
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,680
slander about her.

186
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,480
You two are in a fake marriage.

187
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,680
What kind of wife is that?

188
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,830
She is my wife.

189
00:07:58,830 --> 00:07:59,670
She is the one.

190
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,440
Thank you

191
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,070
for helping me find Dr. Guo.

192
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:11,830
Yuchen,

193
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,190
you don't need to be formal.

194
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,070
Family of Mrs. He.

195
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,510
Please sign the surgery consent form.

196
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,350
Thank you.

197
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,200
The IV is finished.

198
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,910
Let's check on her later.

199
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,630
I'll go make some ginger soup.

200
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,470
Okay.

201
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,460
(In Operation)

202
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,440
The surgery was very successful.

203
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,160
Thank you, Mr. Guo.

204
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,390
Thank you.

205
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,230
That's great.

206
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,240
Thank you, Mr. Guo.

207
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,560
Thank you.

208
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:15,000
The number you dialed
is currently unavailable.

209
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,750
What's wrong with you?

210
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,750
Your wife is this sick,

211
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,960
and you disappear, right?

212
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,390
You waste.

213
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,000
If you don't show up now,

214
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,600
then don't ever show up again.

215
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,240
The Ginger Soup is ready.

216
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,840
I'll go.

217
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,200
Why are you here?

218
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,390
This is none of your business.

219
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,230
It's about my wife.

220
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,200
How is it not my business?

221
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,600
He Yuchen.

222
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,040
He Yuchen.

223
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,000
Take care of your own mess first.

224
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,390
Bu Yan doesn't need you.

225
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,390
Don't be here and cause trouble.

226
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:25,510
Get lost.

227
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:33,750
Bu Yan.

228
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,080
Yuchen.

229
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,560
I'm here.

230
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,080
I'm leaving it to you.

231
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,240
If you don't take good care of her.

232
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,600
I'll make you regret it.

233
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,750
Let's go, we're leaving.

234
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,080
