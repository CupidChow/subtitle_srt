=Episode 16=

3
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,880
They said

4
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:47,430
Bu Yan is Hongfu's daughter.

5
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:50,230
This...

6
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:53,910
This is impossible.

7
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,070
I need to ask.

8
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,600
Mrs. He.

9
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:57,920
Don't, don't get angry.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,280
- Sit down.
- Mrs. He.

11
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,710
Calm down.

12
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:01,600
I'll get your medicine.

13
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,840
Mrs. He, don't get angry.

14
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,920
We still don't know the truth yet.

15
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,260
(Partner Contract)

16
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:32,680
- Ms. Bu.
- Ms. Bu.

17
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,520
Don't leave.

18
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:34,680
Tell us more, Ms Bu.

19
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,520
Explain in detail.

20
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,040
Please explain, Ms. Bu.

21
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,480
If you step forward,
it's trespassing.

22
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,430
I will call the police.

23
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,200
What's going on?

24
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,040
Just leave.

25
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,070
If Mom finds out about
my connection to Hongfu...

26
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,040
It's okay.

27
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,350
I'll explain.

28
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,190
Mom.

29
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,870
You fool.

30
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,800
Hasn't Hongfu ruined you enough already?

31
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,430
And now you've brought their daughter

32
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,080
into our home?

33
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,520
- Mom.
- And you,

34
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,030
what are you thinking?

35
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,400
Mom, I...

36
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,520
Mom,

37
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,400
this has nothing to do with Bu Yan.

38
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,120
She doesn't know what happened.

39
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,120
I'll explain everything to you clearly.

40
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,080
Please calm down first.

41
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,280
She didn't know what her family did
in the past?

42
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,190
But hiding her identity to marry you,

43
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,280
that's a fact, right?

44
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,910
The reporters said

45
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,630
she's just here to
make money for the Group.

46
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,310
And you're so blinded by her,

47
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,560
you believe everything she says.

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,280
A rich heiress.

49
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,560
Did you think it was fun
playing us for fools?

50
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:48,870
Auntie,

51
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,520
this is my family's matter.

52
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,710
You'd better stay out of it.

53
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,080
Alright.

54
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,310
Mom.

55
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,030
I truly didn't know about

56
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,120
what Hongfu did before.

57
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,680
But the only reason

58
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,840
I'm with Yuchen is

59
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:00,750
I love him.

60
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,030
What's this online gossip about?

61
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,470
Some contract marriage?

62
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,470
What ten million?

63
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,470
Let me see.

64
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,080
See for yourself.

65
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,310
See.

66
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,400
Your Hongfu Group

67
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,430
has done nothing but evil,

68
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,910
and now you still won't stop.

69
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,680
You even want to use money

70
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,560
to break the backbone of our He family.

71
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,710
Mom, it's not like that.

72
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,120
- Please calm down.
- Let go.

73
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,430
Listen to me, I...

74
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,910
Don't call me Mom.

75
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,310
When I treated you and the kids
with all my heart,

76
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,280
when I treated them
like my own grandchildren,

77
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,030
were you laughing inside?

78
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,280
Laughing at how easy it is
to bully the He family?

79
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:57,400
Laughing at how easy it is
to fool a dying old woman?

80
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,560
- Mrs. He.
- Mom, I was involved too.

81
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,430
I signed the contract too.

82
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,630
- You.
- Mom.

83
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,750
At the beginning, Bu Yan and I

84
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,030
were indeed bound together

85
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,120
by that contract.

86
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,310
But after spending time together
and getting to know each other,

87
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,710
our feelings no longer
need that piece of paper.

88
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,070
Bu Yan is already carrying my child.

89
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,360
Does a love like this

90
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,040
still need any proof?

91
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,520
See for yourself.

92
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,040
See for yourself.

93
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,560
This is the child you're carrying?

94
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,800
How could this be?

95
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,260
(Obstetrics Test Report: Bu Yan)

96
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,500
(Not pregnant)
My pregnancy test was positive.

97
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:52,240
The hospital even called
to tell me I was pregnant.

98
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,640
Mom.

99
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,800
Where did you get this test result?

100
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:59,920
I found it.

101
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,040
I picked it up on the road in our village.

102
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,480
She must have faked the pregnancy

103
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,560
and tried to secretly throw this away,

104
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,920
but didn't expect me to find it.

105
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,000
You've done nothing but evil.

106
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,430
Even heaven can't stand it.

107
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,880
Get out!

108
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,430
- I don't want to see you again.
- Mom.

109
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,430
Mom, I understand how you feel right now.

110
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,270
What happened back then...

111
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,070
I'll give you an explanation.

112
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,430
Get out, I don't want to see you.

113
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,390
Mrs. He, pretend to faint.

114
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,750
- Or Yuchen is going.
- Bu Yan!

115
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,040
Yuchen!

116
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,160
Yuchen!

117
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,750
Mrs. He fainted.

118
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,430
Are you okay?

119
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,270
Mrs. He!

120
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,870
- Mom.
- What happened to you?

121
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,000
- What's wrong with you?
- Mom.

122
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,480
- Ms. Bu.
- Ms. Bu.

123
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,720
Is it true that you spent ten million

124
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,950
to buy He Yuchen?

125
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:44,900
- What purpose?
- Please answer.

126
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,640
Say something, Ms. Bu Yan.

127
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:46,930
Ms. Bu, please explain.

128
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,040
You wicked woman!

129
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,750
It's her!

130
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,360
What Hongfu heiress?

131
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,870
She's clearly a shameless woman.

132
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:57,120
Who knows which man

133
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,390
she had those two brats with?

134
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,270
Using her money and power

135
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,480
to force our Yuchen to marry her.

136
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,190
Wicked woman!

137
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,600
Bad woman!

138
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,800
You're so shameless.

139
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,240
Shameless.

140
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,230
Say something.

141
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,870
You are shameless.

142
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,680
- Get out.
- Are you avoiding the question?

143
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,520
Get out.

144
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,720
You can't do this, Ms. Bu.

145
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,030
Get out of our village!

146
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,920
Stop.

147
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:23,920
Get out of Haifeng Village.

148
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,310
Who are you?

149
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,270
What are you doing?

150
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,430
So this is her man.

151
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,920
Shameless.

152
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,560
Truly shameless.

153
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,270
What are your relationships?

154
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,110
Look at you.

155
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,600
Look, even come to our village.

156
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,830
- Let's go.
- No need.

157
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,630
No need, thank you.

158
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,750
You really are shameless.

159
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,630
- Don't leave.
- Shameless, get lost quickly.

160
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,000
- Ms. Bu.
- He knows something.

161
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,250
- Stop.
- I haven't finished...

162
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,130
- You get out too.
- Leave.

163
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,630
This is my business card.

164
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,040
It has my lawyer's phone on it.

165
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,070
He will contact you.

166
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,720
Also, your village chief will tell you

167
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,360
how long defamation

168
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,430
will be sentenced.

169
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,240
How is it?

170
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,600
All indicators are normal.

171
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,320
Mom.

172
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,040
Don't you know Mrs. He's condition?

173
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,120
Yuchen,

174
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,680
she can't get so angry.

175
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,880
Right?

176
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,360
Don't be angry, Mrs. He.

177
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,720
Then I'll call an ambulance.

178
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,280
Yuchen,

179
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,040
she has already taken medicine.

180
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,630
If we call an ambulance
and go to the hospital,

181
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,630
it'll just be more exhausting.

182
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:39,950
Why not let Mrs. He

183
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,190
rest at home?

184
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,670
Alright.

185
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,630
I'll go ask Dr. Li to come check on her.

186
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:49,800
Yuchen.

187
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,590
Hello Dr. Li,

188
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,040
my mom is feeling a bit unwell.

189
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,120
Could you come over and take a look?

190
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,590
Okay, thank you.

191
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,000
(Bu Yan)
Don't worry about me.

192
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,480
Take care of Mom first.

193
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,560
I will get to the bottom of this.

194
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,240
Yuchen.

195
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,190
Where are you going?

196
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,000
You're not going to look for
that Bu Yan again, are you?

197
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:09,750
Mrs. He just fainted.

198
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,720
You can't...

199
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,410
You can't...

200
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,830
Is my mom really fainting,

201
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,270
or is this all just you taught her?

202
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,400
I...

203
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,870
What do you mean by that?

204
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:23,750
I don't understand.

205
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,600
Who took the contract?

206
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,240
You don't understand either, right?

207
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,960
I...

208
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,910
I'm just afraid that you and Mrs. He

209
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:38,240
will be deceived by her again.

210
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,080
I'm doing this for your own good.

211
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,150
Really.

212
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,550
And after I posted it online,

213
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,000
I deleted it quickly.

214
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,280
If you don't believe me, look.

215
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,480
Mom, I asked Dr. Li to come and see you.

216
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,440
I'll step out for a moment.

217
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,390
I'll be back soon.

218
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,790
Don't disturb my mom.

219
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,030
Let her rest.

220
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,840
Did you hear that?

221
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,590
Okay.

222
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,230
Hello, Huzi.

223
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,840
Organize the Hongfu information

224
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,680
I collected.

225
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,550
Yan, get in the car.

226
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Thank you, no need.

227
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,120
Yan, don't be stubborn.

228
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,550
Get in the car.

229
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,670
You know I'm not pregnant.

230
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,080
What do you mean?

231
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,440
That pregnancy test result
was supposed to be at the hospital.

232
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,200
You're not going to tell me
it was just lost, are you?

233
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,050
Yes,

234
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:59,870
it was me.

235
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,840
I never thought you

236
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,620
would do such a thing.

237
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:07,670
I promised you

238
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,790
I would do my best

239
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,390
to help you find
a bone marrow match for Xiang.

240
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,150
But you still want to
have a child with him.

241
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,480
You are with him

242
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,960
not just for Xiang.

243
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,550
He is the kids' father.

244
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,750
I want to be with him.

245
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,030
My heart will always lean towards him.

246
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,360
Is there anything wrong with that?

247
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,920
Even if

248
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,870
you have to keep going through
all that again?

249
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:26,990
Yes.

250
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,870
Why do you always
choose the hardest path?

251
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,550
I'm back.

252
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,240
You can think of me as a safe haven.

253
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,270
Choose to rely on me.

254
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:36,790
When I was at my lowest,

255
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,320
I never thought of relying on anyone.

256
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,270
I won't now, either.

257
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,270
I think you should know exactly
what you want.

258
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,120
What you regret is your loss,

259
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,670
not losing me.

260
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,000
Is this how you see me?

261
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:02,270
Just because I made that choice back then,

262
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,910
you judge me like this today.

263
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,670
Your choice wasn't wrong.

264
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,320
It just reminded me,

265
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,960
we are not from the same world.

266
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,480
I have never judged you in my heart,

267
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,030
because I don't care.

268
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:18,750
Since you don't care,

269
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,510
then let's give it a try.

270
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,200
Sorry.

271
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:43,670
Excuse me.

272
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,320
This time

273
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,670
I won't lose you again.
