3
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,350
Yuchen,

4
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:53,400
are you at home?

5
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,320
Auntie, why are you here?

6
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,600
It smells like booze in here.

7
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,430
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

8
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,080
I heard from Huzi that
no one's been taking care of you at home.

9
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,430
So I made you some food.

10
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,670
Come on.

11
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,230
Let me tell you,

12
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,710
a woman with kids,

13
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:10,840
it is just not worth it.

14
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,670
When the child is sick,
how can she take care of you?

15
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,840
Let alone take care of your mother.

16
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:18,200
What do you mean the child is sick?

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,920
Don't you know?

18
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:22,590
Her son's got allergies
and he's in the hospital.

19
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,560
I ran into them there yesterday.

20
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,920
Didn't I tell you he had an allergy?

21
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,560
Allergy?

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,200
He seemed fine...

23
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,760
(She rushed to the hospital yesterday)

24
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,720
(Not to find that Tang Ze.)

25
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,430
(But because Xiang's sick.)

26
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,430
Yuchen, you should eat first!

27
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,120
Xiang, look, what is this?

28
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,000
Xiang.

29
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,120
He Yuchen.

30
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,150
I'm sorry.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,640
I didn't take good care of you.

32
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,560
I let you eat barbecue...

33
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,760
But look what I got for you.

34
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,230
It's a Transformer!

35
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,320
Mom is here.

36
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,950
Xiang,

37
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,960
get some rest

38
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,310
and recover well.

39
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,950
I'll come to see you
again next time, alright?

40
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:27,600
Okay.

41
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,190
Ms. Bu, Doctor Tang.

42
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,040
Mom.

43
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:36,990
Xiang,

44
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,950
such a

45
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,400
good boy.

46
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,470
Xiang is really a good boy.

47
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,040
Come here.

48
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,200
This is my new friend.
Take care of him.

49
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,790
How about we go
buy a toy plane later?

50
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,950
(As long as Xiang is fine.)

51
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,950
(They're a family. A real one.)

52
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,440
(What does it have to do with me?)

53
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,110
(Why am I looking for him?)

54
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,510
(He's just a jerk.)

55
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,750
♪The world changes unpredictably♪

56
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,780
♪The light in my eyes has faded away♪

57
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,860
♪How can I hide my panic now♪

61
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,140
(Bu Family)

62
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,630
Bu Yan had a child out of wedlock
five years ago.

63
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,840
She disgraced Hongfu.

64
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,390
And now you're bringing her back?

65
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,190
Bu Jingyang,

66
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,240
she is your sister.

67
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,960
Besides, you've been running
the boxing club for six years,

68
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,150
and it's losing money every year.

69
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,240
If it doesn't turn a profit soon,

70
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,560
you're out of the company.

71
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,400
Okay.

72
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,040
Six years ago, I forced
He Yuchen out of the ring

73
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,950
and made Hongfu
the top club in the industry.

74
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,240
Now, I can force him back

75
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,640
to make money for me.

76
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,470
But Bu Yan...

77
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,440
She's not coming back.

78
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,680
Impressive.

79
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:18,800
(Bu Yan.)

80
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,720
(You got kicked out.)

81
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,470
(That old man still thinks of you.)

82
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,950
But,

83
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,390
you really surprised me.

84
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,150
Your husband

85
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,640
turns out to be He Yuchen.

86
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,830
Long time no see, champ.

87
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,200
Banned for years,

88
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,240
but your punches are as sharp as ever.

89
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,640
Bu Jingyang,

90
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,270
you've got some nerve
showing up in front of me.

91
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,200
No need to be angry, Chen.

92
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,440
I'm here to invite you

93
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,030
to a championship match.

94
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,510
Big prize money.

95
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,830
You think I'd fight for you?

96
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,680
You can refuse.

97
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,240
But you know how Hongfu operates.

98
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,390
You've seen what happens
to those who refuse me.

99
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,200
Think carefully about the consequences.

100
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,000
I'll give you three days.

101
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,000
The stakes? Your new wife.

102
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,440
Hello?

103
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,120
She is not my wife.

104
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,000
If you're trying to
use her against me,

105
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,800
she's not worth the leverage.

106
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,040
Now that I'm even more curious…

107
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,470
Let's see

108
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,760
if she really means nothing to you.

109
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,350
(He's serious.)

110
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,640
(I can't let Bu Yan stay here.)

111
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,590
No need to apologize.

112
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,240
Come back tomorrow.

113
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,120
What's the matter?

114
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,510
Mom,

115
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,950
please stop arguing.

116
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,000
Make up?

117
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,080
(For Xiang)

118
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,440
(I can endure anything.)

119
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,440
What's the matter?

120
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,680
Your things are there.

121
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,640
The contract is over.

122
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,070
I'll return the payment

123
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,120
and the money for the house.

124
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,870
He Yuchen,

125
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,070
I've put up with a lot.

126
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,160
Break the contract before it's up?

127
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,000
You'll have to

128
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,320
pay a penalty.

129
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,310
Didn't you already

130
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,640
make up with your ex?

131
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,120
Wouldn't it be better

132
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,030
to have his child instead?

133
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,160
Let me tell you.

134
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,120
I won't help you to annoy your ex.

135
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,070
If you want to play this kind of game,

136
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,150
find someone else.

137
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,470
He Yuchen.

138
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,680
Listen to me.

139
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,430
Tang Ze is my ex.

140
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,390
We broke up.

141
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,360
It's over.

142
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,030
There's no getting back together.

143
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,150
So no, I'm not ending the contract.

144
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,350
What do you mean?

145
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,830
It means that

146
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,710
no matter what's going on
between you and him,

147
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,150
my decision stays the same.

148
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,120
The contract is over.

149
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,040
He Yuchen, that's enough.

150
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:47,750
Yuchen.

151
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,950
Yan.

152
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,120
Be careful with your steps.

153
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,280
Take it slow.

154
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,230
This is the house that Bu Yan bought.

155
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,720
I’m not trying to meddle, but...

156
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,830
You can't spoil your
daughter-in-law like that.

157
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:07,200
You see, she is too tough.

158
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,870
She just moved in and already wants to
move your whole family here.

159
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,670
After all, she's a girl from the city.

160
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,160
She still looks down on our country people.

161
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,960
She doesn’t even do

162
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,390
the laundry

163
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,470
or cook.

164
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,040
I've never seen anyone so...

165
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,280
Mom.

166
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,390
Yuchen.

167
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,870
You boy.

168
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:23,840
Alright,

169
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,040
I'll head back.
Got some stuff to do at home.

170
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,000
Alright.

171
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,840
Mom.

172
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,200
Why did you come back?

173
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,830
How do you think I got back?

174
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,680
The wedding photo,

175
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,910
bought a house.

176
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,550
Why are you still hiding it from me?

177
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,390
Mom,

178
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,230
Bu Yan and I are just...

179
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,280
Mrs. He.

180
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,870
My girl,

181
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:48,630
look at you.

182
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,080
You shouldn't have spent so much.

183
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,080
I was thinking of

184
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,950
throwing you both a wedding.

185
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,470
What do you think?

186
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,200
Mom.

187
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,560
Okay.

188
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,630
Thank you, Mrs. He.

189
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:07,280
Oh, no trouble at all.

190
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,920
Thank you, mom.

191
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,110
I've been waiting for this day, you know?

192
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,320
Finally, it's here.

193
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,350
The wedding can't be held.

194
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,750
Why?

195
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,950
Don't tell me you're being
stingy with money.

196
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,470
Your girl bought the house for us.

197
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,870
You can't be this cheap

198
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,840
when it comes to a wedding.

199
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,840
Mom, it's not that.

200
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,240
You want to save money for me, don't you?

201
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,350
I understand.

202
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,750
But you're a grown man now.

203
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,230
You can't just think about me.

204
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:52,470
Your wife is the one
you'll spend your life with.

205
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,080
Don't worry, dear.

206
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:59,350
I won't let this rascal make you suffer.

207
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,680
I'll arrange the wedding for you
as soon as possible.

208
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,990
Alright, Mom.

209
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,240
You just got out of the hospital.

210
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,110
Get some rest.

211
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,360
- Come here.
- You...

212
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,200
Go handle the wedding.

213
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,080
Come here.

214
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,350
Did you hear that?

215
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,320
You take a rest.

216
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,800
Come over here.

217
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,040
Let me tell you.

218
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,550
Stay out of this.

219
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,440
Just go.

220
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,000
Why should I stay out of it?

221
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,710
Mom said she wanted to hold the wedding.

222
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,630
I didn't care at first, but now...

223
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,870
If you keep pushing,

224
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,670
the wedding will happen.

225
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,560
Bu Yan.

226
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,030
Getting fired up, huh?

227
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,120
Feifei.

228
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,350
What's up?

229
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,480
Three things.

230
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,550
First, contact a wedding planning company.

231
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,030
Second, Xiang is leaving
the hospital today.

232
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,550
Help me with the discharge procedures.

233
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:41,470
Third, bring Bu Sheng and
Bu Xiang to my wedding.

234
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,440
When?

235
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,630
Tomorrow.

236
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,620
Don't think that just that phone call,

237
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,510
the wedding has to happen.

238
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,080
I said I won't do it, and I won't.

239
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,750
Don't forget,

240
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,080
who has the final say
in this marriage, right?

241
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,440
Bu Yan.

242
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,630
Holding the wedding so hastily.

243
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,360
Marrying a man you don't like.

244
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,960
Is it worth it just to spite your ex?

245
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,380
You should mind your own business.

246
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,510
You broke up with your ex-boyfriend

247
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,000
because you were too stubborn

248
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,350
and unreasonable?

249
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,870
Yes.

250
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,240
I don't like to compromise

251
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,400
or discuss things.

252
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,280
So when I make a decision,

253
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,680
don't try to change it.

254
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,630
You better prepare yourself.

255
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,080
My decision is the same.

256
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,480
Bu Yan,

257
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,270
if you don't leave, I'll tie you up,

258
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,480
put you in the car and send you away.

259
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,320
Alright.

260
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:46,990
Once I step out of this door,

261
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,750
do you believe I will buy
the entire Haifeng Village?
