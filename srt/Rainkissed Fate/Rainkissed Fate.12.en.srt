=Episode 12=

3
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,760
You're quiet like this
only when you're asleep.

4
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,870
(Mission accomplished?)

5
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,590
It's not like I haven't seen it before.

6
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,190
You've already exercised
your rights over me.

7
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,840
The wedding's over.

8
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,430
Think about when to
terminate the contract

9
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,520
and let me know as soon as you can.

10
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,960
Already?

11
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,840
You're quite fast.

12
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,680
What was He Yuchen's reaction?

13
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,400
Nothing special.

14
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,960
For him, this matter

15
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,430
is just fulfilling the contract.

16
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,800
Moreover, he just wants me
to leave quickly now.

17
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,560
He doesn't mind paying the penalty
for breaking the contract.

18
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,870
Once it's over,

19
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,430
the father's out,
but the child stays.

20
00:02:59,150 --> 00:02:59,990
Bu Yan.

21
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,280
Why do you seem a bit down?

22
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:06,840
You aren't in love, are you?

23
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,680
No.

24
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,310
That's good to hear.

25
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,910
That jerk isn't worth it.

26
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,870
How is the company?

27
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,080
We're negotiating with

28
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,920
a foreign company,

29
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,680
but there are too many competitors.

30
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,310
It's not going well.

31
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,360
Let's go to the office.

32
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,430
Tell the project team.

33
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,360
Meeting at 1 o'clock.

34
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,280
Hello, what's your name?

35
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,640
He Yuchen.

36
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,470
Are you feeling unwell?

37
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,590
When did you meet Bu Yan?

38
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,470
Why did you break up?

39
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,120
Working hours.

40
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,590
I don't like discussing personal matters.

41
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,280
Just don't like talking to me, right?

42
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,840
I see you

43
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,240
get along fine with Bu Yan.

44
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,870
He Yuchen, you are already married.

45
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,680
If you are a real man,

46
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,030
then don't be so paranoid.

47
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,590
I'm just curious.

48
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,910
You seem to be obsessed with Bu Yan.

49
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,630
Is it because she dumped you back then?

50
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,640
You cheated?

51
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,080
First love, parents disapproved.

52
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,310
Anything else you want to ask?

53
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,750
First love, how many others after that?

54
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,640
Only Bu Yan.

55
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,040
Why didn't your parent approve?

56
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,560
This is my personal matter.

57
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,040
It has nothing to do with you.

58
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,630
If you're not here for treatment,
please leave.

59
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,430
Since your parents disapproved,

60
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,360
why are you still so obsessed with her?

61
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,240
That was in the past.

62
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,160
If it were now,

63
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,000
would you still have a chance?

64
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,160
(Stable job, decent temper)

65
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,510
(No other relationships all these years)

66
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,430
Her views on marriage,

67
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,480
are a bit unconventional.

68
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,160
Are you sure you can handle it?

69
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,600
What do you mean?

70
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,510
I mean

71
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,040
if she doesn't cherish you,

72
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,630
if she goes off with another man...

73
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,320
He Yuchen,

74
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,600
if you're bothered by my past with her,

75
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,830
you can divorce her.

76
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,240
But you cannot insult her.

77
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,560
(You’d go this far for Bu Yan.)

78
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,800
(Seems like he's someone worth trusting.)

79
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,120
Feifei,

80
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,560
I've figured out a solution
for that cooperation.

81
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,000
The plan will be out tonight.

82
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,040
I'll just work overtime.

83
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,870
Alright, bye-bye.

84
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,230
Who are you?

85
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,350
What do you want?

86
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,870
Don't worry, someone wants to
have a talk with you.

87
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:01,680
Let go of me.

88
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:02,670
Let go of me.

89
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,110
Go away.

90
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,950
What are you running around
for this late?

91
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,520
He Yuchen.

If you come back late,

106
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,390
you can tell me and I'll pick you up.

107
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:34,670
No need.

108
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,680
Aren't you eager to
terminate the contract with me?

109
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,240
After that, I will leave.

110
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,630
I won't trouble you anymore in the future.

111
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,760
This is the best.

112
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,200
Get on the car.

113
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:08,920
Come.

114
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,320
He Yuchen, you!

115
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,120
If you cause trouble for her,
you're asking for trouble.

116
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,000
Look, I'm taking such a big risk
to come find you.

117
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,240
I really want to talk business with you.

118
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,600
I told you before,

119
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,030
I don't fight fixed matches.

120
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,750
Also, that woman has nothing to do with me.

121
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,390
Don't cause trouble for her.

122
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,000
Nothing to you?
Then why are you being so angry?

123
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,710
By the way,

124
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,960
didn't you say she wasn't your wife?

125
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,000
How did you end up married?

126
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,150
Were you just fooling me?

127
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,200
You're dragging women into men's affairs.

128
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,480
You're really cowardly, aren't you?

129
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,630
Don't forget.

130
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,030
It was your doing that got me banned
in the first place.

131
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,080
Now you want me back for a fake fight?

132
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,000
You really think because you're rich,

133
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,600
you can do whatever you want?

134
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:09,790
Of course,

135
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,630
you knew what Hong Fu

136
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,510
was capable of six years ago, didn't you?

137
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,440
I could make you banned back then,

138
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,000
and I can get you reinstated now.

139
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,480
How about it? I can help you
return to the ring.

140
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:23,870
Aren't you happy?

141
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,280
I'm telling you,

142
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,870
this fake fight? You'll do it,

143
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:34,840
whether you like it or not.

144
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,030
My patience has limits.

145
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,840
Either

146
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,080
you stay with your wife

147
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,480
and kids all the time,

148
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,630
or you'll regret it later.

149
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:05,120
(Someone who is so short of money)

150
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,630
(is suddenly willing to pay the penalty.)

151
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:11,910
(Could it be because...)

152
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:21,640
Didn't you say you would leave
in a couple of days?

153
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,270
When exactly is that?

154
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,960
That person was after you just now.

155
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,270
He tried to grab me to threaten you?

156
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,840
Ms. Bu, we are just
in a contractual relationship.

157
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,030
What kind of threat are you considering me?

158
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,870
He Yuchen,

159
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,030
tell me the truth.

160
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,790
Have you gotten yourself
into some trouble recently?

161
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:02,960
You're afraid it'll drag me down,

162
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,870
so you're in a rush
to terminate the contract.

163
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,560
Right?

164
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:15,910
Since when did I become
so great in your heart?

165
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,670
You think after sleeping with me twice,

166
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,910
I'll be this affected by it?

167
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,390
That would be best.

168
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,550
Since we're ending the contract anyway,

169
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,550
you can sleep here for the next few days.

170
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,000
(It's time to deal with Bu Jingyang,)

171
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,720
(the source of the problem.)

172
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,280
He Yuchen.

173
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,840
You!

174
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,870
He Yuchen, stop!

175
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:19,870
Stop!

176
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:20,750
Dare to touch my woman.

177
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,930
I'll make sure you pay for it!

178
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:23,960
Stop!

179
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,750
I am the heir of the Hongfu Group!

180
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,630
If I die, your family
won't have it easy either!

181
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:30,550
Let's see who kills who first.

182
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,070
