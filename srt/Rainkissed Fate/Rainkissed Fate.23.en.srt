What's going on?

38
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,320
Why are you packing?

39
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,920
Yuchen.

40
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,920
This isn't our home.

41
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,990
I'm going back to my own home.

42
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,760
Auntie,

43
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,310
why did you call me back so urgently?

44
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,430
What's going on?

45
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,760
- I?
- Auntie.

46
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,240
I put Yuchen's clothes

47
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,360
in too.

48
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,430
Didn't I tell you

49
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,310
not to let Mrs. He see this photo?

50
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,310
How careless can you be?

51
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,200
- I might've just accidentally taken it out.
- Give it to me.

52
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:38,950
- Give it to me.
- Mom.

53
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,630
- I already burned this photo.
- Mom.

54
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,870
Why is it still here?

55
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,040
- Mom.
- Give it to me.

56
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,960
Mom, you only told me the person

57
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,790
in the photo was

58
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,440
connected to Dad's death,

59
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,400
I took it from the fire.

60
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,160
I need to keep

61
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,680
this photo

62
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,440
to find the person who killed Dad.

63
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,160
Are you trying to drive me crazy?

64
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,510
This happened 20 years ago.

65
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,280
If they could've caught the murderer,

66
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,510
they would've by now.

67
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,640
Yuchen,

68
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,550
listen to me.

69
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,520
Even if we find the murderer,

70
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,040
we can't defeat them.

71
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,120
I don't want you to get hurt.

72
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,480
Let's just live our lives

73
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,800
and forget about it, okay?

74
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,830
This is Bu Honghui,

75
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,720
Bu Yan's father.

76
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,190
No, you're mistaken.

77
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,360
You got it wrong.

78
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,350
I'm not mistaken.

79
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,430
I saw it in the company profile of Hongfu.

80
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,350
- I saw it.
- No.

81
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,560
It definitely is him.

82
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,360
Wendy, stop making it worse.

83
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,560
I'm not.

84
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,760
I really saw it.

85
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,640
Mom, this is Bu Honghui.

86
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,430
I don't care if she cleared your name or not.

87
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,510
- She...
- Mom.

88
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,390
She is...

89
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,240
Mom.

90
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,630
She is Bu...

91
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:54,470
Mom.

92
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Mom.

93
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,560
You know

94
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,150
Bu Yan is Bu Honghui's daughter?

95
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,910
That's why we can't be together.

96
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,880
So,

97
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,830
Bu Honghui is the one who killed Dad.

98
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,830
- Mrs. He.
- Mrs. He.

99
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,920
Mr. Bu, He Yuchen has beaten our guys

100
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,160
and is trying to barge in to see you.

101
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,150
He Yuchen.

102
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,830
Who do you think you are,

103
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,920
barging in like that?

104
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,830
You.

105
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,030
Bu Honghui,

106
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,760
take a look at this photo first.

107
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,710
Mr. Bu, this is for you.

108
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,750
Let him in.

109
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,590
Yes.

110
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,950
(How does he have a picture
of me and Changting?)

111
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,710
(Could it be...)

112
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,390
Are you He Changting's son?

113
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,830
Did you kill my father?

114
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,560
You do look a bit like him,

115
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,440
but how could that be?

116
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,350
Answer me.

117
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,910
Did you kill my father?

118
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,910
(He Yuchen's file)

119
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,950
(He Yuchen's Info)
(didn't mention his father.)

120
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,560
Are you his son?

121
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,150
I'll need to confirm.

122
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,240
I can't just take your word for it

123
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,760
based on a photo.

124
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,030
Alright.

125
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,350
I'll wait.

126
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,120
Take your time.

127
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,440
Li, come here.

128
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,640
Mr. Bu.

129
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,480
Look into He Yuchen's records.

130
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,360
Why isn't there any info on his father?

131
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,320
And find out who his father really is.

132
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,680
Yes, Mr. Bu.

133
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,560
Also,

134
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,640
this is a special guest of the Bu family.

135
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,480
Show him to a guest room.

136
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,320
Yes.

137
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,430
My dad was tough,

138
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,600
not like you—

139
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,150
a kid with no father.

140
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,800
Who says I don't have a father?

141
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,350
Next spring,

142
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,390
when the flowers bloom,

143
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,120
I will be back.

144
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,640
Yuchen,

145
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:18,120
it's all because Mom's been unwell.

146
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,710
Otherwise, you wouldn't have to

147
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,680
give up your finance degree

148
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,950
and go fight in the ring.

149
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,200
Always covered in bruises.

150
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,360
It's okay, Mom.

151
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,950
With Dad gone,
I'm the only man left in the family.

152
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,710
If I don't take care of you, who will?

153
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,520
Just you?

154
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,440
You think you can even meet with Mr. Bu?

155
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,240
He Yuchen,

156
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,400
you've picked the wrong side.

157
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,360
I heard Changting died

158
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,400
trying to help his friend.

159
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,550
- What a tragedy.
- Mom.

160
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,000
Only the mother and child remain now.

161
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,790
What are we going to do now?

162
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:34,630
- Mom.
- Yeah, the child is still so young.

163
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,910
- Mom.
- Mr. He is also a poor man.

164
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,360
I must say, his friend

165
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,320
really is a terrible person.

166
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,950
(He Changting Info)
He Yuchen really is his son.

167
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:51,560
He...

168
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,080
How can I make it right with your family

169
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,080
without causing more harm?

170
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,350
Mr. Bu, I've got the information.

171
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,270
Before it was handed to you,

172
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,470
Dr. Tang reviewed it.

173
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,120
I heard you're moving back to the Bu family.

174
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,160
I'll go see Sheng and Xiang another day.

175
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,080
Alright.

176
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,470
He Yuchen,

177
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,240
why are you here?

178
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,390
He's in your house?

179
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,080
Doesn't he fear your dad breaking his hands?

180
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:29,400
Are you crazy?

181
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,480
Before my dad finds out,

182
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,350
hurry up and leave.

183
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,200
Don't bring up your dad.

184
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,990
What's wrong with you tonight?

185
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,400
Do you even know where you are?

186
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,350
Where am I?

187
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,590
A wealthy family.

188
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,150
Does your dad

189
