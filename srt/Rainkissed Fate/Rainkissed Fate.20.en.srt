Yuchen, your mother's awake.

22
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,840
(Auntie)
Come quickly.

23
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:36,940
Remember to eat porridge.

24
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,660
Take your medicine on time.

25
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,140
Wait for me.

26
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,370
(City Jiang First People's Hospital)

27
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,260
Come.

28
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,540
Mom.

29
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:09,940
Yuchen.

30
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,580
Mom told you

31
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,420
you must properly

32
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,940
thank Wenli for me.

33
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,100
Get some rest.

34
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,700
Don't worry.

35
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,300
I'll repay

36
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,460
Wenli's kindness.

37
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,140
Yuchen,

38
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,700
how do you plan to repay?

39
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,500
What do you want?

40
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,460
Feel free to speak up.

41
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,220
You know,

42
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,460
what I've always wanted is you.

43
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,020
Yuchen,

44
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,460
you know very well

45
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,100
I don't agree

46
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,020
you and Bu Yan.

47
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,500
So,

48
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:53,300
how about the two of you together.

49
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,420
Mom, don't worry.

50
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,540
You should rest well first.

51
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:03,980
Wenli,

52
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,060
come out with me for a moment.

53
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:15,820
Yuchen,

54
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,540
I know what you want to say.

55
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,100
But I don't care about these things.

56
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,780
We couldn't be together before,

57
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,500
and won't be possible in the future either.

58
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,780
Yesterday, it rained so heavily,

59
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,700
I was running around
trying to contact Dr. Guo.

60
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,420
I don't feel tired at all.

61
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,660
Because I love you.

62
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,660
I'm willing to do these things for you.

63
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,220
But can Bu Yan do these things?

64
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,260
I'll say it again.

65
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,180
Bu Yan is the one and only in my heart.

66
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,980
She doesn't need to compare with anyone.

67
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,260
Nor does she need to sacrifice anything.

68
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,100
She is the wife I have chosen.

69
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,660
I will repay the kindness of you.

70
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,740
But aside from gratitude,

71
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,260
I can't give you any other feelings.

72
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,300
Yuchen,

73
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,620
I...

74
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,980
- Don't go.
- Let go.

75
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,540
- I won't let go.
- Let go.

76
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,260
- Let me go.
- You are mine.

77
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,100
No one can take you away.

78
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,180
Let go.

79
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,100
I won't let go.

80
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:01,980
Release it.

81
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,500
I won't let go.

82
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,260
You're still sick.

83
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,340
Why did you come here?

84
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,180
Yuchen,

85
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,190
you haven't said yet.

86
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,540
How will you repay me?

87
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,180
Bu Yan,

88
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,860
yesterday, Chen Wenli contacted Dr. Guo,

89
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,860
which really helped our family a lot.

90
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,580
How do you think we should thank her?

91
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,780
I'll listen to you.

92
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,180
(It was actually her who got in touch.)

93
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,420
Yuchen treats you so well.

94
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,580
And what about you?

95
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,140
Where were you when Mrs. He was sick?

96
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,540
Now that everything's settled,

97
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,660
you've finally shown up.

98
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,540
Chen Wenli.

99
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,620
Yuchen, I'm very curious

100
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,460
if a woman

101
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,780
truly loves you

102
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,420
and she sees another woman

103
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,300
hugging you,

104
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,140
why would she have no reaction at all.

105
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:04,980
Or is it that

106
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,780
actually Ms. Bu,

107
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,540
you don't really care
that much about Yuchen?

108
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,060
I know.

109
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,140
You expect me to misunderstand.

110
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,420
Then turn around and leave.

111
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,340
And part ways with him.

112
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,740
But you underestimate
my trust in He Yuchen.

113
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,740
Between him and me,

114
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,100
it's not something that can

115
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,460
be ruined by a few words from you.

116
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,100
Yuchen, Wenli.

117
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,180
You all come in.

118
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,780
Let's go in together.

119
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,140
I'm glad to know Mrs. He is fine.

120
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,500
She needs to rest quietly now.

121
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,380
Once she's better,

122
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,820
I'll talk to her.

123
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,060
You go in first.

124
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,460
Thank you for trusting me.

125
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,220
As for my mom,

126
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,820
I can help you explain it clearly.

127
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,220
Yuchen, it's not good to
keep Mrs. He waiting.

128
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,740
Go ahead.

129
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,540
What are you doing?

130
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,140
Just now, Yuchen asked me
to make a decision for him.

131
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,660
To express his gratitude to you.

132
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,340
Go ahead, speak.

133
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,900
How can he thank you

134
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,860
properly?

135
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,620
Mrs. He has already made it very clear.

136
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,060
It's impossible between you two.

137
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:37,940
What?

138
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,500
Are you still waiting for Yuchen to

139
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,980
abandon his own mother for you?

140
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:43,980
Do you really think

141
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,380
love conquers all?

142
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,780
Mrs. He doesn't like you,

143
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,420
so this won't last.

144
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,180
If he says he can, then he can.

145
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,340
Don't be so smug.

146
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,980
In the end, you don't even know

147
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,420
who'll be by his side.

148
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,420
Alright, Mrs. He.

149
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:37,180
Mr. Bu, the Tang family's promise
has been fulfilled.

150
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,820
You should let Bu Yan return to my side.

151
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,340
Mommy is back.

152
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,740
Mom.

153
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,280
Mom.

154
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,700
Come.

155
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,660
Come on, you two, go play in the room.

156
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,540
Alright?

157
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:06,820
Let's go.

158
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,260
Mr. Bu, what brings you here?

159
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:16,180
You promised me.
It's time to fulfill that promise.

160
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,780
What do you mean?

161
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,380
I have invited Dr. Guo for you.

162
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,020
I'm here to collect my payment.

163
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,980
(Dr. Guo was invited by my dad)

164
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,420
(Chen Wenli is lying)

165
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,620
Ms. Bu, it was Mr. Bu who invited Dr. Guo.

166
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,460
I understand.

167
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,260
Please thank Dr. Guo for me.

168
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:42,940
Confirmed?

169
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,820
Didn't you say you wouldn't help?

170
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,860
I am a businessman.

171
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,820
There's no reason not to
do a profitable deal.

172
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,220
The share transfer documents are all ready.

173
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,820
Mr. Bu, as efficient as always.

174
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,780
I have already informed Deng Yun

175
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,020
to assist you as

176
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,420
the new CFO to get familiar with the work.

177
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,980
CFO?

178
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,620
Your company has been merged
into Hongfu Group.

179
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,740
As of today, you're the CFO of Hongfu.

180
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,940
That is the fruit of your mother and me

181
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,060
I trust you the most with it.

182
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,220
Your mother, in spirit,

183
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,420
would also approve of my decision.

184
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,780
You did all this

185
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,780
just to make me return?

186
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,660
Dad is getting old.

187
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,300
I agreed.

188
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,940
But we'll wait until He Yuchen's mother
is out of the hospital.

189
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,060
(Hongfu Group)

190
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,380
Have you heard?

191
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,180
Mr. Bu has taken action against
his daughter's company.

192
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,180
Really?

193
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,540
There's no doubt about it.

194
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,580
His daughter caused
Hongfu's stock to crash,

195
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,340
and now her company's been liquidated

196
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,620
and merged into our group.

197
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,580
(Bu Yan, now you have nothing left.)

198
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,220
(How are you still so high and mighty?)

199
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,140
Wenli,

200
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,260
you're the apple of Mr. Deng's eye.

201
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,340
When you rise to the top,

202
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,500
don't forget about us.

203
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,860
Yes, Wenli.

204
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,540
What are you talking about?

205
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,740
So, how is Bu Yan doing now?

206
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,620
She?

207
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,060
I heard she's drowning in debt.

208
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,700
That night, during the heavy rain,

209
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,340
she knelt outside the door
for most of the night,

210
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,780
and Mr. Bu completely ignored her.

211
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,820
(I wonder what else you still have)

212
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,060
(to cling to Yuchen?)

213
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,180
What are you doing here?

214
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,580
How can you do this?

215
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,820
How dare you hit me?

216
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,380
You're the one getting hit.
