3
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:47,110
Mr. Bu,

4
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,580
the share transfer agreement is ready.

5
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:49,500
(Share Transfer Agreement)

6
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,040
Mr. Bu,

7
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,680
it's fine to transfer the shares to He Yuchen.

8
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,430
But breaking the engagement
with the Tang family

9
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,750
could impact the two companies' collaboration.

10
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:06,280
Most of the contracts are already signed,

11
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,920
and backing out now could
lead to serious legal consequences.

12
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,950
(Bu Honghui)
I've thought this through carefully.

13
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,560
I owe this to He Yuchen.

14
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,760
I'll handle the situation with Tang family.

15
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,080
Go ahead.

16
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,950
Mr. Bu, you asked for me.

17
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,840
You don't look well.

18
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:37,390
Are you feeling alright?

19
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,390
Let me check.

20
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,510
Tang Ze.

21
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,390
The train

22
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,950
will always return to its track.

23
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,760
That's inevitable.

24
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,030
Mr. Bu,

25
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,670
I'm her first love.

26
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,840
I was meant to be her right track.

27
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,200
You asked her to marry your friend's son

28
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,080
because of guilt.

29
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,950
That's why you arranged this.

30
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,160
But they met,

31
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,710
fell in love,

32
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,110
and had two kids.

33
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,200
If my friend hadn't passed,

34
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,270
they would've met before you.

35
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,360
That's just how fate works.

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,440
I don't believe in fate.

37
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,670
If a doctor believed in fate,

38
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,990
how would patients entrust their lives to them?

39
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,790
I believe it's up to us.

40
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,150
Tang Ze.

41
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,040
You.

42
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,510
Mr. Bu.

43
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,990
Please take your medicine first.

44
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,270
Tang Ze.

45
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,640
I hope you'll

46
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,480
think carefully about this.

47
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,200
If you agree to call off the engagement,

48
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,480
I'll make sure the Tang family's loss
is fully compensated.

49
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,270
Did you find it?

50
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,150
I can't believe it.

51
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,470
After searching for so many years,

52
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,800
we had already met.

53
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,350
You came after us?

54
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,560
To silence us?

55
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,350
Your father's death...

56
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,080
It's connected to me.

57
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,160
Bu Honghui, you were friends.

58
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,240
Why would you betray him?

59
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,590
This.

60
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,160
(Shares Transfer Agreement)
It's what I owe to the He family.

61
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,320
Dad, the board meeting needs...

62
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,440
Bu Honghui.

63
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,880
Dad!

64
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,640
- Dad!
- Bu Honghui.

65
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,120
Bu Honghui.

66
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,830
Dad, what's happening?

67
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:08,950
Dad, wake up!

68
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,270
- Mr. Bu!
- Dad!

69
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,110
Tang Ze.

70
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,350
- Get him checked!
- Lay him flat!

71
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,800
Mr. Bu,

72
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,440
what happened?

73
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,510
Call an ambulance!

74
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,350
Okay.

75
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,910
Where's my phone?

76
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:27,910
Hello?

77
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,270
Doctor,

78
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,000
my father has collapsed.

79
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,120
We are at Hubin Road.

80
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,310
(56% Shares)
Mingding Villa.

81
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,430
Okay, please hurry!

82
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,760
56% of Hongfu Group's shares

83
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,030
are all being transferred to He Yuchen?

84
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,800
How is this possible?

85
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,180
(In Operation)

86
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,830
How's my dad?

87
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,560
He's out of danger,

88
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,600
but based on his current condition,

89
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,000
he may remain in a coma for a long time.

90
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,880
Be prepared for that.

91
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,440
A long-term coma?

92
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,440
There have been many cases like this before.

93
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:22,830
My suggestion is

94
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,070
to let him recover at home.

95
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,150
It'll help with his recovery.

96
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,080
- But...
- Don't worry.

97
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,150
I'll keep

98
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,910
monitoring his condition at home.

99
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:34,760
Thank you.

100
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,760
No need to thank me.

101
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,270
We are family.

102
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,150
Is it you?

103
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,150
What are you doing?

104
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,270
This is a hospital.

105
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,950
Your father was perfectly fine

106
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,680
until you came back.

107
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,150
(Bu Honghui's sudden illness)

108
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,950
(seems suspicious.)

109
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,390
(Someone must be behind this.)

110
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,310
You want to grab the fortune.

111
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,830
First, you ruined your brother's reputation

112
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,000
and sent him abroad.

113
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,360
(Looks at Sun Zheng this way.)

114
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,680
(It doesn't seem like she'd do this.)

115
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,830
(Bu Jingyang is abroad,
so he had no chance to act.)

116
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,000
And now pushing your father

117
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,070
to transfer

118
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:03,910
the shares to him.

119
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:05,800
Answer me.

120
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,070
Feeling guilty now?

121
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,480
Listen, Bu Yan.

122
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,320
If your dad...

123
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,680
If you have any doubt,

124
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:11,750
you can bring it up at home.

125
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,750
If you keep making noise here,

126
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,150
I'll have you thrown out of the Bu family.

127
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,830
- How dare you?
- Stop.

128
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,680
I'll call the security.

129
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,520
Get out of my way.

130
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,880
Tell me what's going on.

131
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,880
How should I know?

132
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,390
He Yuchen,

133
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,480
my dad was fine,

134
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,720
but suddenly collapsed in front of you.

135
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,070
You're the one receiving the shares.

136
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,470
Now you're telling me you don't know anything?

137
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:40,390
What do you think is going on?

138
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,880
You're avoiding my question.

139
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,200
What are you hiding?

140
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,560
He Yuchen.

141
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,150
Is it because my dad

142
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,160
disagreed with us being together?

143
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,640
He threatened you, so you...

144
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,320
So what?

145
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,640
Say it.

146
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:05,830
Go on, say it.

147
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:10,760
I don't believe it.

148
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,640
Unless you say it.

149
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:15,760
Alright,

150
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,350
I'll say it.

151
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,920
It's all because Bu Honghui

152
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,830
owes my family.

153
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,440
He's getting what he deserves.

154
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,880
So, you pressured my dad into this?

155
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,480
If you really think it's me,

156
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,480
then call the police.

157
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,590
I want to call them too.

158
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,680
My father's death is connected to him.

159
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,440
He Yuchen, even if you are

160
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,840
the largest shareholder of Hongfu now,

161
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,730
it doesn't mean you can

162
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,990
treat Yan like this.

163
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,680
She's my fiancée.

164
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:56,920
I suggest you show some respect.

165
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,350
Then make sure your fiancée

166
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,960
to keep her hands

167
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,950
off other men.

168
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,830
Are you okay?

169
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,280
(Before I entered the study,)

170
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,200
(Tang Ze had been there.)

171
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,750
(He's the one who targeted Bu Honghui.)

172
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,950
(He doesn't care about the shares.)

173
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,080
(What was he after with Bu Honghui?)

174
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:31,990
(Bu Yan?)

175
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,230
(Until the truth is clear,)

176
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,470
(I can't leave Bu Yan around him.)

177
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,320
Dad,

178
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,590
I'm sorry.

179
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,590
If I hadn't gotten involved with He Yuchen,

180
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,680
none of this would've happened.

181
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,470
You wouldn't be like this.

182
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,440
Dad, please wake up.

183
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,670
Whatever grudges there are

184
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,950
between the Bu family and the He family,

185
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,360
I won't let He Yuchen

186
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,560
hurt you again.

187
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,830
Once I find out the truth,

188
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,350
if it's really him,

189
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,320
I won't let him get away with it.

190
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:15,910
Ms. Bu,

191
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,350
He Yuchen and his people are here.

192
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,790
From now on,

193
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,150
no one enters Bu Honghui's room

194
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,990
without my permission.

195
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,080
- Yes.
- Yes.

196
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,560
He Yuchen,

197
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,830
what are you doing?

198
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,320
This is my house.

199
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,160
Get your people out.

200
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,560
That won't be possible.

201
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,120
I'm here to fulfill the contract

202
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,230
as your husband.

203
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,200
I already told you

204
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,320
the agreement's over.

205
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,630
I never signed it.

206
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:01,040
That was your decision, not mine.

207
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,200
Don't forget,

208
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,120
Bu Honghui gave me

209
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,160
56% of Hongfu Group's shares,

210
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,440
as well as his assets.

211
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,560
Legally,

212
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,510
I own half of this house.

213
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,350
Is that reason enough

214
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,870
for me to stay?

215
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,920
He Yuchen, you.

216
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,110
I'm the largest shareholder in Hongfu now.

217
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,040
Don't make me angry,

218
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,830
or I'll destroy

219
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,110
everything Bu Honghui

220
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,320
built.

221
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,200
He Yuchen,

222
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,280
you're shameless.

223
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,110
You brought

224
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,510
this man in

225
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,480
and ruined this family.

226
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,750
Look at what you've done.

227
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,590
You.

228
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,320
Who do you think you are?

229
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,560
You dare to touch my woman?

230
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,320
Ever since you came here,

231
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,800
you've been bullying Bu Yan.

232
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,560
Why are you silent?

233
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,280
Are you afraid of me?

234
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:20,750
Well then,

235
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,350
let me tell you this.

236
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,350
From now on,

237
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,200
this house is under my control.

238
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,030
As long as I'm here,

239
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:31,230
no one's allowed to hurt Bu Yan.

240
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,990
Now

241
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,390
pack your things

242
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,030
- and get out of this house.
- I.

243
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:40,110
I'm Bu Honghui's legal wife.

244
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,560
You dare kick me out?

245
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:48,680
Wake up, Honghui!

246
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,350
This family is falling apart!

247
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,670
Don't forget,

248
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:59,320
I'm now the largest shareholder
in Hongfu Group.

249
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,750
Are you saying

250
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,230
you are willing to stay and take care of

251
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,320
a bedridden old man

252
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,950
with nothing left?

253
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,630
Great, I just moved in.

254
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,350
The house needs a caretaker.

255
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,630
You stay.

256
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:19,280
You.

257
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,160
He Yuchen.

258
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,320
Bu Yan.

259
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,320
Just wait.

260
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,560
Just wait...

261
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,750
I'll have my son come back and deal with you.

262
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,350
I don't need your fake kindness.

263
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,950
Move my things

264
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,560
to Bu Yan's room.

265
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,560
- Yes.
- Yes.

266
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,230
What are you doing?

267
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,870
Don't move them!

268
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,160
He Yuchen.

269
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,680
Don't push your luck.

270
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,830
Back in the village,

271
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,950
we stayed together every night.

272
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,870
Now that we're here,

273
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,400
I shall stay

274
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,950
wherever you do.

275
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,510
Do you think

276
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,680
there's a chance

277
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,800
for us now?

278
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,750
What are you doing?

279
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,160
Let go of me!

280
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,280
He Yuchen.

281
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,630
Put me down.

282
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,590
He Yuchen.

283
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:19,990
Put me down.

284
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,560
Put me down.

285
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,960
I'll say it one more time.

286
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,830
He Yuchen.
