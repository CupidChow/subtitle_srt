3
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,720
Why's the power out, Li?

4
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,120
It's me.

5
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,840
Come on, follow me.

6
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,280
Yuchen.

7
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,390
Tang Ze planted a bug in your dad's room.

8
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,760
Our engagement was something

9
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,760
you personally agreed to.

10
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:34,000
A man should keep his promises,

11
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,510
don't you think?

12
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,720
You shouldn't have woken up.

13
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,120
I never intended to kill you,

14
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,030
but if you wake up,

15
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:51,760
she'll know the truth,

16
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,000
and I really can't be with her.

17
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:05,920
So this was all your trap

18
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,270
to catch him?

19
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,600
I love Yan.

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,510
I can't live without her.

21
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,510
Anyone who stands in the way of me and Yan

22
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,320
has to die.

23
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,990
Bu Yan.

24
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,390
Don't worry, nothing's happened.

25
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,670
Now that you know the truth,

26
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,990
what will you do, Bu Yan?

27
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,550
Yuchen, you go out first.

28
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,720
Bu Yan.

29
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,670
It's fine.

30
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,670
I'll be right outside.

31
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,670
Why do this?

32
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:20,600
Because

33
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,120
I don't want to lose you again.

34
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,670
You're crazy.

35
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,950
Yeah,

36
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,480
I've gone crazy.

37
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,550
When I came back and
saw you married this peasant,

38
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,160
I've been crazy since then.

39
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,160
Why him?

40
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,710
He's good for nothing except fighting.

41
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:38,520
What gives him the right

42
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,710
to have your love?

43
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,110
Is that why you hurt my dad?

44
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,440
Tang Ze,

45
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,400
when you

46
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,680
chose to leave me,

47
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,750
you already knew the answer,

48
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,710
didn't you?

49
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:50,600
Yes,

50
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,080
I made the wrong choice.

51
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,510
But I don't want to keep making wrong choices.

52
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,680
I'm so close to succeeding now.

53
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,030
We're already engaged.

54
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,590
As long as he doesn't wake up,

55
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,160
no one can break us apart.

56
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,680
Even if you care for He Yuchen,

57
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,540
it doesn't matter.

58
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:04,080
As long as we're together, as long as...

59
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,920
Tang Ze,

60
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:09,110
we'll never be together.

61
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,670
Why?

62
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,360
Because he and I

63
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,630
will do anything

64
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,470
to protect the ones we love.

65
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,470
That's the biggest difference between us.

66
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,390
Yan,

67
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,200
I made the wrong choice.

68
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,200
If I had stayed with you back then,

69
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:29,480
we'd be a happy family

70
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,800
of four by now,

71
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,480
living together,

72
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,440
wouldn't we?

73
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,120
Tang Ze,

74
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,830
from now on,

75
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,270
we're done.

76
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,560
I'll announce the end of our engagement.

77
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,310
As for whether you'll

78
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,320
go to prison,

79
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:50,510
we'll wait for

80
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,590
my Dad to wake up.

81
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,910
But no matter what he decides,

82
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,590
I will never forgive the harm

83
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,030
you've caused my father.

84
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,350
Bu Yan.

85
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:05,000
Now, please leave.

86
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,270
You never loved me, did you?

87
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,270
No.

88
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:14,830
I don't believe it.

89
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,680
Didn't I tell you,

90
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,910
when you said you were leaving for abroad,

91
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,880
I was relieved?

92
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,750
Because when I was with you,

93
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,120
I always feel guilty,

94
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,000
guilty for always taking advantage
of your kindness.

95
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,590
Since you've taken advantage of me,

96
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,470
why not just use me until the end?

97
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:47,760
Tang Ze,

98
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,390
let go.

99
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:30,030
You said your father's death
is related to my dad.

100
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,270
Why are you still doing this for me?

101
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,920
It's done,

102
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,200
no need for so many questions.

103
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,880
Then can you tell me

104
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,590
what exactly happened?

105
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:48,710
Hello, is this

106
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,390
Bu Xiang's mom, Bu Yan?

107
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,390
Yes, this is her.

108
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,030
We've found
a matching bone marrow for Bu Xiang.

109
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,030
Really?

110
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:57,870
Please come by tomorrow.

111
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,590
Let's discuss the details.

112
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,830
That's great.

113
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,680
I'll come tomorrow.

114
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,760
Thank you.

115
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,510
You found it?

116
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,440
How did you find it?

117
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,910
I told you,

118
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,240
I have my ways.

119
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,120
Don't worry about it.

120
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,120
How did you get hurt?

121
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,200
This injury...

122
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,440
has nothing to do with this.

123
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,200
Don't overthink it.

124
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,510
Thank you.

125
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,270
Chen Wenli,

126
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,630
how about we team up?

127
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,240
We both get what we need.

128
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,380
(Pediatrics)

129
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:15,560
The follow-up results will be
available soon.

130
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,390
Thank you.

131
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,830
Xiang, you need to be brave.

132
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,070
Once the results come in,

133
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,560
we can do the surgery.

134
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,560
He Yuchen said

135
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,190
a real man doesn't shed tears.

136
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,560
I'm not going to cry.

137
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,830
Once the final results are in,

138
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,200
I'll contact you as soon as possible.

139
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,920
There are some

140
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,750
pre-surgery instructions,

141
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,160
make sure to follow them.

142
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,830
Thank you.

143
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,750
Keep an eye on Bu Xiang these days,

144
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,590
and make sure he takes his medicine on time.

145
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,400
Alright,

146
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,040
we're heading back now.

147
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:49,860
Thanks again.

148
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,630
Xiang?

149
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,440
Xiang!

150
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,110
Xiang!

151
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,800
Xiang!

152
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,560
Watch it.

153
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,710
Did you see Xiang?

154
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,040
He went that way.

155
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,110
Xiang!

156
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,440
Xiang!

157
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,350
Xiang.

158
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:43,920
Xiang.

159
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,560
Xiang.

160
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,920
Xiang.

161
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,680
Xiang!

162
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,230
Xiang!

163
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,950
Xiang!

164
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,670
Xiang!

165
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,440
Wake up, Mom's here.

166
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:04,800
Xiang.

167
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,440
What's wrong?

168
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,710
Are you not happy to see me?

169
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,040
Bu Jingyang,

170
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,040
do you know this will land you
in prison for life?

171
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,080
Let Xiang go now.

172
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,680
Don't worry.

173
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,630
This kid is still useful.

174
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,230
I won't hurt him.

175
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:31,800
But of course,

176
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,200
you'd better

177
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,990
listen and behave.

178
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,630
Tell me,

179
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,990
what do you want?

180
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,160
You're

181
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:52,040
truly my sister.

182
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,360
Even now,

183
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,520
you're so calm.

184
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,350
Why not?

185
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,630
Here for a chat?

186
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:02,870
Why?

187
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,080
Why do you always act

188
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,470
so high and mighty?

189
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,470
Just because our father favors you?

190
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,680
We're both from the Bu family.

191
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:11,630
Why do you always

192
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,630
take up all of our father's love?

193
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,200
Why do you always

194
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,520
defy his wishes?

195
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,830
I've given my all to the Bu family.

196
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,830
Why can't I compare to you?

197
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,630
Because

198
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:30,470
there's good and evil in people.

199
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,630
Good and evil...

200
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,350
Good and evil...

201
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:37,830
My evil

202
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,520
was forced out by you and father.

203
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,560
I want to see,

204
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,110
without father's protection,

205
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,680
will your husband, who took the shares,

206
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,470
come save you?

207
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,470
Go.

208
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,600
- Your wife and child are in my hands.
- Let go of me!

209
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,470
Xiang!

210
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,990
Xiang!

211
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,120
Bu Jingyang, let him go.

212
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,680
He's just a child.
