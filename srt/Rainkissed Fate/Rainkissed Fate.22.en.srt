3
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,280
Ms. Bu, is it true that you're engaged

4
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,120
to Tang Ze?

5
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,600
Is there a bigger plan behind the union

6
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,000
between Hongfu Group and Tang Group?

7
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,000
Did you agree to the engagement

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,280
with Mr. Tang?

9
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,110
I heard Mr. Tang will be moving into
the Bu family house.

10
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:58,350
Is it for wedding preparations?

11
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,230
There are doubts about

12
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,120
the financial interests

13
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,080
behind this union.

14
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,390
What do you have to say about that?

15
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,710
If he lost his mother and his career

16
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,560
because of you,

17
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,280
do you think he will stay with you?

18
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,480
So, you're engaged to Tang Ze.

19
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,600
Does this mean you're breaking up
with He Yuchen?

20
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:14,300
Yes.

21
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,190
Ms. Bu,

22
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,040
can you elaborate on that?

23
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,880
Wait, don't go.

24
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,150
Bu Yan!

25
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,600
Bu Yan!

26
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,760
You were pretty tough before.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,040
Why aren't you fighting back now?

28
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,230
I'm not fighting back

29
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,000
because you're Bu Yan's father.

30
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,400
You're the one
who forced Bu Yan to marry Tang Ze.

31
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,510
(He Yuchen's Info)
I've seen your background.

32
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,790
You're a top student
from Jiang University's Finance Department.

33
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,070
I don't know why you became a boxer,

34
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,710
but you don't need to fight,

35
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,400
you could still make a name

36
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,750
for yourself on your own.

37
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,240
Stop dragging Bu Yan into this.

38
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,000
I'll start a company for you.

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,960
You can support yourself

40
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,750
and take care of your mother.

41
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,120
If not for yourself,

42
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,910
think about Bu Yan.

43
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,840
Six years ago,
she was kicked out because of you.

44
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,590
Now, she's lost everything

45
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,590
she worked so hard because of you.

46
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,560
You can't give her a stable life.

47
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,550
Six years ago,

48
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,470
it was because of me?

49
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,470
Dr. Guo came back

50
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,870
because Bu Yan used her company
to make it happen.

51
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,470
Didn't she tell you?

52
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,310
She knelt in the rain all night,

53
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,470
begging me for help.

54
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:56,710
(Bu Yan.)

55
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,030
(You've done so much for me...)

56
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,590
(Didn't even know...)

57
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,470
Don't feel moved by what she did.

58
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,590
She's just trying to make up for

59
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,240
the harm caused to you and your mother

60
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,590
by Hongfu back then.

61
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,520
Go.

62
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,590
Yuchen.

63
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:35,990
Yuchen.

64
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,800
I know you're upset right now.

65
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,870
Bu Yan's already

66
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,470
with another man.

67
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,240
She's been pretending with you all along.

68
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,430
Tell me,

69
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,240
did you invite Dr. Guo here?

70
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,590
You doubt me?

71
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,430
I really went to ask for help.

72
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,470
But how was I supposed to know
Mr. Deng would lie to me?

73
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,910
Still trying to fool me?

74
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,280
- I...
- You didn't actually help,

75
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:05,800
but you made it seem like

76
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,280
it was all thanks to you.

77
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,470
No, I...

78
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,870
Yuchen...

79
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,560
If you don't want everyone to find out

80
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,150
about the dirty things you've done,

81
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,280
you'd better stop badmouthing Bu Yan.

82
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:33,710
Bu Yan.

83
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,900
Bu Yan, stop.

84
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,790
Go inside.

85
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,120
- He Yuchen.
- He Yuchen.

86
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,430
You two go ahead.

87
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,830
I will come up soon.

88
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,080
Okay.

89
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,040
If you insist on breaking off the engagement

90
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,510
and being with He Yuchen,

91
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,040
I'll break one of his arms

92
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,600
and end his boxing career.

93
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,800
His mother's treatment will stop too.

94
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,390
You've done so much for me.

95
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,630
Why don't you say anything?

96
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,600
You invited Dr. Guo.

97
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,070
Why not tell the truth?

98
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,630
My dad contacted you?

99
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,270
He's the one who hurt you.

100
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,750
Don't worry, I can handle it.

101
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,870
Handle it?

102
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,310
What else can you do

103
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,160
besides throwing punches?

104
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,480
Has something happened to you?

105
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,800
You don't have to carry this alone.

106
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,600
You can rely on me.

107
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,870
We can solve it together.

108
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,920
I'm engaged to Tang Ze.

109
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,920
We're done.

110
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,680
I'm moving on, and you should too.

111
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,600
You're nothing to me anymore.

112
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,510
It's Tang Ze and I now—no one else.

113
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,800
Do you think I'll believe you?

114
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,160
Who cares if you believe me or not?

115
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,950
By the way, the contract is off now,

116
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,920
from now on, we go our separate ways.

117
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,760

I've been living in constant fear.

188
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,720
This photo is still here.

189
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,720
Probably something Yuchen kept.

190
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,600
You better hide it.

191
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,910
Don't let Mrs. He see.

192
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,320
Isn't this a photo of Mr. He and his friend?

193
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,480
Mr. He's death

194
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,150
was connected to this person.

195
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,670
Their families even had an engagement.

196
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,670
It's tragic.

197
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:31,840
By the way,

198
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,360
this friend's surname is Bu.

199
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,200
I'd say

200
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,320
the Bu and He family

201
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,120
just don't get along.

202
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,320
No wonder she doesn't want to live there.

203
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,150
I wouldn't want to either.

204
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,910
What happened?

205
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,320
How would I know?

206
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,120
It's been over 20 years.

207
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,750
If Mr. He hadn't died back then,

208
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,030
they wouldn't have had to suffer so much.

209
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,720
Here's the company's history.

210
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,750
You can go through it.

211
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,120
It will be helpful.

212
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:04,670
Come on, I'll show you around.

213
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,840
Alright.
