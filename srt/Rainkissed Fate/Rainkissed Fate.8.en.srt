3
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,230
Do you have something to say?

4
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:30,870
Are you free in the evening?

5
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:33,760
What's the matter?

6
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,270
Stop being difficult.

7
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:37,960
5 o'clock.

8
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:38,870
See you on the boat.

9
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,790
Weird.

10
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,080
Why did you call me here?

11
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,310
What's wrong?

12
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,840
Why did you insist on marrying me?

13
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,080
Wasn't it all written in the contract?

14
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,150
Then why did you insist on
having kids with me?

15
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,430
Your ex seemed like a decent guy.

16
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,960
What?

17
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,680
What's with the sudden interest in me?

18
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,710
Did you fall for me?

19
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,360
I need to know what kind of person
my wife is.

20
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,080
I'm only your wife for three months.

21
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,870
You don't need to be so curious.

22
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,960
Really? You can't tell me anything?

23
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:41,960
Not even

24
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,430
who the kids' father is?

25
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,630
Why do you care so much?

26
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,590

Yuchen.

Ms. Bu.

44
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,160
We're here!

45
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,150
Hello!

46
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,320
Mom!

47
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,200
Mom!

48
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:47,590
Why are you here?

49
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,230
- Yuchen.
- Mom.

50
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,320
Yuchen.

51
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,750
Didn't you say you wanted to
treat everyone to barbecue?

52
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,830
So I called everyone over.

53
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,160
- We're here.
- Alright.

54
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,270
Let's set up here.

55
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,950
Xiao Wu, bring some drinks.

56
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,830
Put the meat over here.

57
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,180
- Xiang.
- Bring some more water.

58
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,040
- Sheng, take this one
- Did you say thanks?

59
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,240
- Thank you.
- Mom, can I drink this?

60
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,000
What do you want to eat?

61
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,000
Yes, you can drink it.

62
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,270
- Here.
- Ugh, it's so spicy!

63
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,310
- Let me do it.
- You're married now,

64
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,040
still letting Wenli
take care of everything?

65
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,560
I...

66
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,720
I'm just used to helping Yuchen.

67
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,750
So I'll take care of this too.

68
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:24,430
Then who's the real wife of you?

69
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,270
Come, sit over here.

70
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,870
Yeah, who exactly is your wife?

71
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,270
(No need to care)

72
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,310
(It's just a contractual relationship)

73
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,630
(Once it's over, we'll be strangers)

74
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,270
I'll go bring some barbecue to

75
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,190
my wife.

76
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,190
Why aren't you joining them?

77
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,680
Not used to being around them?

78
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,400
Grab me a bottle of water.

79
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,980
Fresh off the grill.

80
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:54,990
Here.

81
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,560
Is it delicious?

82
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,480
Thank you.

83
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,520
Good kid.

84
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,360
Xiang,

85
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,560
do you want some too?

86
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,720
He doesn't eat it. He's allergic.

87
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,190
Allergic to barbecue?

88
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,920
Fried food, barbecue,

89
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,360
and preserved foods.
He's allergic to all of it.

90
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,800
Aren't they twins?

91
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,310
With different conditions.

92
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,270
Xiang,

93
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,360
let's not eat this.

94
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,310
Let me take you to play.

95
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,640
Let's go.

96
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,950
Sheng, sit here.

97
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,920
It smells so good.

98
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:56,670
Give it to me.

99
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,320
I...

100
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,310
I also want to play with you.

101
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,150
Come here.

102
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:07,190
We also want to play with you!

103
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,480
- Let's play together.
- Alright, alright.

104
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,720
- You b...
- What?

105
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,830
Brilliant friends.

106
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:13,680
Be nice.

107
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:16,790
Tug in.

108
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,240
Eat up.

109
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,110
Here.

110
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,070
(Blood relationship)

111
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,680
(really creates natural affection?)

112
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,120
Look!

113
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,510
So beautiful.

114
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,880
Be careful.

115
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,920
Feifei,

116
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,190
what's up so late?

117
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,430
You sound in a good mood.

118
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,750
Did you get it done?

119
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,270
Not yet.

120
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,950
It's been a rollercoaster.

121
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,940
- Do you want to eat?
- Come on, don't be shy.

122
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,430
Let's have a drink!

123
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,000
- Cheers.
- Come on.

124
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,880
Bottoms up!

125
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,240
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

126
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,920
- He Yuchen, look.
- It's okay.

127
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,190
He Yuchen, what are you doing?

128
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,160
- Go play over there.
- But...

129
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,310
- Just a bite.
- What is that?

130
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,190
Come on.

131
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,160
You're the kind of person

132
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,240
who enjoys yourself
but suppresses your kids.

133
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,270
I know

134
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,240
junk food isn't good for them,

135
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,080
but just a bite or two to make them happy.

136
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,480
Is it really such a big deal?

137
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,360
Didn't I tell you he's allergic?

138
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,230
Allergic?

139
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:40,960
Isn't he fine?

140
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,270
Just because you don't see symptoms
doesn't mean he's not allergic.

141
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,080
If something happens,
will you take responsibility?

142
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,000
- I will.
- Can you really handle it?

143
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,390
You think having money makes you superior?

144
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,000
The kids are none of your business.

145
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,720
The only reason we're even talking

146
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,120
is because of the contract.

147
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,320
You just need to fulfill your obligations.

148
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,240
And that's it.

149
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,960
Remember,

150
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,510
the money I give you is not for free.

151
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,800
Alright,

152
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,390
consider it my meddling.

153
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,440
You just want to sleep together?

154
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:12,710
Go home.

155
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,870
Aren't you going to do that?

156
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,230
What?

157
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,270
Do I have to take the initiative?

158
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,030
Six years ago, you could do it.

159
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,270
