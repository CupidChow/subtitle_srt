3
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,740
(Haifeng Village)

4
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,640
- Look.
- Move it over there.

5
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,200
Who's moving?

6
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,110
Such a big move.

7
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,640
Where did this girl come from?

8
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,200
She's really pretty.

9
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,230
Is she the one who's been dating Yuchen?

10
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,540
Look, such pretty eyes.

11
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:10,400
Getting married so fast?

12
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:11,760
Come on, move it this way.

13
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,920
- You can tell this woman's rich.
- Exactly.

14
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,310
Whoever marries her is lucky.

15
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:17,280
Be careful.

16
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,560
Take it slow, no rush.

17
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:28,710
I'll do it.

18
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,880
I'll do it.

19
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,070
Hello?

20
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,590
He Yuchen.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,790
I've arranged a property for you.

22
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:36,950
No. 28, First Team, Haifeng Village.

23
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,680
I'll have the movers take your stuff

24
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,120
from the boat to here.

25
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,590
You can just come back here directly.

26
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,640
You, newlywed,

27
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,230
don't check on your
hospitalized mother-in-law.

28
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,120
Living on the boat is enough,

29
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,350
yet you're spending
so much money on a big house?

30
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,000
- Do you have no conscience?
- Mom!

31
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,080
- Babe.
- Mom!

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,260
Are you okay?

33
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,200
I am fine.

34
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,950
She doesn't like living on the boat,

35
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,660
so buying a house

36
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,560
makes sense.

37
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,760
If it were you, you'd probably
be able to handle that.

38
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,920
I'm spending my own money on this house.

39
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,230
What does it have to do with you?

40
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,590
Using your own money?

41
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,510
Who would believe that?

42
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:10,520
This house

43
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,870
must cost at least a million or so.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,150
It must be the money
for Yuchen's mom's treatment.

45
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,330
Madam Hua's life-saving money.

46
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,240
Truly heartless.

47
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,150
What's wrong?

48
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,630
Yuchen.

49
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,870
Yuchen,

50
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,400
you should talk to your wife.

51
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,750
Your mom is still in the hospital
waiting for money to save her life.

52
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,120
And she's causing such trouble.

53
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,840
Auntie,

54
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,800
she bought the house with her own money.

55
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,910
Her own money?

56
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,990
- How could you lay a hand on her?
- If it's not the case...

57
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,510
Why so worked up?

58
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,680
Bu Yan,

59
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,000
you are truly impressive,

60
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,630
raising two children,

61
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,960
without a job,

62
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,470
yet you can drive a luxury car,

63
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,680
buy such a big house,

64
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,870
and have endless money to spend.

65
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,120
- Yeah..
- How does she have money if she's not working?

66
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,080
Guess she's being kept by someone.

67
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,590
Yuchen,

68
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,870
you absolutely cannot marry this woman.

69
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:57,710
Auntie,

70
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,840
don't say things without proof.

71
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,840
Besides,

72
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,680
Bu Yan and I are already married.

73
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,150
Yuchen is already married.

74
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,960
Mind your own business.

75
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,800
Go home, go home.

76
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,120
Everyone,

77
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,360
from today on,

78
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,750
Bu Yan will be our family's daughter-in-law.

79
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,470
We live in the same village,

80
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,960
seeing each other everyday.

81
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,400
Please be nice.

82
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,430
Yuchen must be captivated by her.

83
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,270
Alright, time to go.

84
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,560
Go where?

85
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,750
We're all here,

86
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,360
so I'll make myself clear.

87
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:30,870
I, Bu Yan,

88
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,120
run a company,

89
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,150
and have a job.

90
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,360
My mother-in-law is frail,

91
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,550
and the boat's too unstable,

92
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,840
she could easily fall and hurt herself.

93
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,120
Once she's out of the hospital,

94
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,280
she'll live at home, in a proper house.

95
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,710
Yeah, that makes sense.

96
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,750
Sounds reasonable.

97
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,190
Seems like she wronged her.

98
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,190
I think so too.

99
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,280
I'm

100
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,280
a reasonable person,

101
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,240
easy to get along with,

102
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,750
but I'm not someone to be pushed around.

103
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,680
Let me make myself clear.

104
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,150
If something like this happens again,

105
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,470
I will call the police.

106
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,960
Lawyers, court summons,

107
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,190
you name it.

108
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,560
Don't blame me for making things awkward later.

109
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,710
Yeah, let's keep the peace.

110
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:07,680
Let's go.

111
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,190
Alright, alright.

112
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,240
It's over for today.

113
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,310
Come on, time to go.

114
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:12,710
Alright, alright.

115
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:14,560
Move it!

116
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,560
Want to see the new house?

117
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,400
Sure.

118
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,560
Thanks for

119
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,080
the house,

120
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,680
but I'll pay you back.

121
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,240
I only said all that for the argument,

122
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,270
to take the

123
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,430
moral high ground.

124
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,720
But really, I bought the house for the kids.

125
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,190
This is how you thank me?

126
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,750
Next time something like this happens,

127
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,950
don't act stubbornly on your own.

128
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:59,870
I'm not afraid of them.

129
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,830
Is this really about being afraid or not?

130
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,120
You're taking care of two kids by yourself,

131
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,270
not realizing how dangerous people can be.

132
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,560
Get out of my house.

133
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,870
Here's the key,

134
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,270
I accep that you gave up,

135
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,750
but I won't give up on my children.

136
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,680
I've been through it all.

137
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,680
In these six years, I've faced so much,

138
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,430
I know better than you

139
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,390
what needs to be done in certain situations.

140
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,160
We're just in a contractual relationship,

141
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,870
you don't need to worry about me.

142
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,150
Indeed.

143
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,720
I'm just being nosy,

144
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,190
worrying about your business.

145
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,160
Sheng, Xiang.

146
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,120
Come here.

147
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,560
Mom, I don't want to take a bath.

148
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,480
Come on, it's time to bathe.

149
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,070
Mom, I don't want to take a bath.

150
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,830
Mom's counting to three, two, one...

151
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,190
I'm coming to get you!

152
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,700
Come.

153
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,000
The big monster's coming!

154
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,270
- You can't catch me.
- Got you.

155
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,510
These two little ones

156
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,360
are more endearing than their mom.

157
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,040
If mom catches me, I'll take a bath.

158
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,630
No running! It's bath time today.

159
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,840
You need to wash your hair.

160
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,870
Can't catch me! Come on, come on!

161
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,310
Xiang, don't be naughty.

162
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,680
Run away!

163
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,000
Don't run.

164
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,310
Don't run.

165
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,270
I'm coming to catch you.

166
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,270
Six years ago...

167
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:29,800
When you got caught, you had to wash your hair.

168
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:30,710
Five years old?

169
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,720
I don't want to.

170
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,680
I got you.

171
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,720
I don't want to take a bath.

172
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,390
Mom is coming to catch me.

173
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,750
Could they be mine?

174
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,430
Xiang, don't run.

175
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,800
Come, come, be good.

176
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,240
Line up for a bath.

177
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,310
-Go in, go in.
-Time for a bath.

178
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,870
It's bath time.

179
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,800
Give it to me. Don't take it.

180
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,190
Come, let mom take it.

181
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,160
- Don't move, don't move.
- Mom.

182
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,920
You'll catch a cold
if you get the towel all wet.

183
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,760
Come here.

184
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:01,790
You stand there.

185
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,950
Don't move, don't pick it up.

186
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,680
Clumsy.

187
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,310
Let the little ones go out.

188
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,390
You two, change your clothes.

189
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,400
What?

190
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,630
Helping Auntie out with your own agenda?

191
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,310
Feeling guilty?

192
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,750
Who's playing that game?

193
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,920
I think you're doing this on purpose.

194
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,920
On purpose?

195
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,040
Doing what?

196
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,870
Explain yourself clearly.

197
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,600
Spilling water all over yourself

198
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,190
to seduce me?

199
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,440
Exactly.

200
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,360
You're supposed to honor the contract,

201
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,270
aren't you?

202
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,270
What?

203
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:50,680
Afraid?

204
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,560
I'm not interested in a drowned rat.

205
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,480
Next time you want to tempt me,

206
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:05,920
dress better.

207
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,390
Do you mean I am ugly?

208
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,660

00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,720

210
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,870

211
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,840
(Don't you know drinking's bad for you?)

212
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,150
