=Episode 2=

3
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:47,020
Hello, hello hello.

4
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,020
Can you hear me?

5
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:51,150
Hello everyone!

6
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,280
I'm here to read a marriage ad.

7
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,840
He Yuchen.

8
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,880
Male, 28 years old.

9
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,670
Lives in Haifeng Village.

10
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,280
Works as a fisherman.

11
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,600
Owns a motorcycle

12
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,870
and a fishing boat.

13
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm a pretty ordinary man...

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,310
Everyone,

15
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,240
I'm here

16
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,040
as He Yuchen's bride-to-be.

17
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:14,840
Nice to meet you.

18
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,590
Nice to meet you.

19
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:17,840
Who's this young girl?

20
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,150
Who is she?

21
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,510
How far are you gonna take this?

22
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,600
Get lost.

23
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:24,630
Yuchen,

24
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:25,840
what's going on?

25
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,150
Auntie, she's got the wrong person.

26
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,230
I knew it!

27
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,120
You and Wenli have known each other
since childhood.

28
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,070
There's no need to find a wife
through matchmaking.

29
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,040
Exactly.

30
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:36,990
Auntie.

31
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,640
I posted the ad,

32
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,500
but Wenli and I...

33
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:40,350
Yuchen!

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,950
Are you really going to marry her?

35
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,000
Didn't you say you didn't want to get married?

36
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,940
Probably because of his mom.

37
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,150
Wenli, it's good you came in time.

38
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,240
Otherwise,

39
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,350
Yuchen

40
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,230
would have been poached by this outsider.

41
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,680
Exactly.

42
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,950
If Yuchen really likes her,

43
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,120
that would be nice too.

44
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,640
So, we are competitors then?

45
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,760
Pfft.

46
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,630
You, a woman with two kids,

47
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,400
how can you compete with our Wenli?

48
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,000
Get out of our Haifeng Village.

49
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,190
Yes, get out, get out.

50
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,310
- Get out.
- Get out of our Village.

51
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,310
Get out of our village.

52
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,680
- Enough!
- Just leave!

53
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,800
- Exactly.
- Get out!

54
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,640
Just leave!

55
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,080
I'll get married,

56
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,840
but not to you.

57
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,840
Even if you give me ten million,

58
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,840
or even a hundred million,

59
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,910
I wouldn't be some cheap dad

60
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,430
to these two wild brats.

61
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,190
My kids,

62
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,280
they have names.

63
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,800
How's the communication
with the kids' father going?

64
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,560
Can you have another kid?

65
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,360
His leukemia is in the chronic phase,

66
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,870
but it will take time to prepare
for the bone marrow matching.

67
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,240
You need to make a decision soon.

68
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,360
The sooner we get the cord blood, the better.

69
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,080
Do not miss the optimal transplant time.

70
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,120
Mom, don't be sad.

71
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,520
We won't cry.

72
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,150
Mom, we will protect you.

73
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,960
With you by my side,

74
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm not sad at all.

75
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,280
Blood!

76
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,900
(City Jiang First People's Hospital)

77
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,360
Hello, here for Bu Xiang.

78
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:38,550
Okay.

79
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,590
Take it slow, Mom.

80
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,920
How is it?

81
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:50,870
Feeling better?

82
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,800
I'm much better.

83
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,750
Don't mind me nagging.

84
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,910
You're a grown man now.

85
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,080
It's time to get married.

86
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,310
(Turns out he's looking
for a spouse for his mom)

87
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,870
You need to make a decision soon.

88
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,710
The sooner we get the cord blood, the better.

89
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,840
Don't miss the optimal transplant time.

90
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,390
Yuchen,

91
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,440
why are you here?

92
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,040
- Mom, she...
- Yuchen,

93
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,120
Yuchen, who is this girl?

94
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,710
Madam,

95
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,910
I am...

96
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,240
I'm a friend of Yuchen,

97
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,080
I just came to see you.

98
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,000
Let go, don't force me to do something.

99
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,590
He Yuchen,

100
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,870
you didn't treat me like this that night.

101
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,040
I... What do you mean by that night?

102
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,900
What are you talking about?

103
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,480
That night in the car...

104
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,560
That night, you and I...

105
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,600
Mom, I'm taking her out.

106
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,560
We'll be back in a while.

107
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,800
Goodbye.

108
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:56,720
Bye-bye.

109
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,800
Yuchen is getting married soon!

110
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,000
You dare to follow me.

111
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,950
And threaten me with my mom.

112
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,830
You looking for trouble?

113
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,000
Your mom is already so sick.

114
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,190
And you are still being picky.

115
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,510
With your conditions for marriage,

116
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,120
which girl would be willing to marry you?

117
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,510
No dating,

118
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,240
no dowry, no house.

119
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,070
Get married and live with you
on that fishing boat.

120
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,160
- I...
- A grown man.

121
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,000
Just getting married,

122
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,510
to fulfill your mother's wish.

123
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,160
Why drag this out?

124
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,000
You...

125
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,510
I am your best option.

126
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,270
- You!
- Look here.

127
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:09,950
Here's my number.

128
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,360
You've got two hours to decide.

129
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,960
Asleep?

130
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,760
How is it?

131
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,560
What did He Yuchen say?

132
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,840
Disagree.

133
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,430
He played the innocent act.

134
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,040
And he still didn't agree.

135
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,030
How about

136
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,360
you tell him about the kids?

137
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,830
His own kids,

138
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,800
he can't just let them die, can he?

139
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,560
Besides his fake boxing and suspension.

140
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,950
Now, every day, all he does
is underground boxing

141
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,510
and loaf around in the village,

142
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,480
acting like a gangster.

143
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,480
I won't let the kids know

144
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,480
their father is like this.

145
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,070
Alright,

146
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,830
I'll go out for a while.

147
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,360
Please look after Xiang for me.

148
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,600
- Call me if there's anything.
- Okay, go ahead.

149
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,000
Why are you still bothering Yuchen?

150
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,390
He won't marry you.

151
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,480
So please stop disturbing his life.

152
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,190
A woman like you with two illegitimate brats

153
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,040
is not worthy of our Yuchen at all.

154
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,190
I said before,

155
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,600
my kids have names.

156
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:37,750
I know,

157
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,040
any person,

158
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,160
with an ID card,

159
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,070
has a name.

160
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,750
But if the father is unknown,

161
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,870
they're illegitimate kids.

162
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,240
See that?

163
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,390
I grew up with Yuchen.

164
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,800
He'll never choose you.

165
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,840
Let go of me.

166
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,630
The marriage you just mentioned,

167
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:02,830
is it still valid?

168
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:05,470
Of course.

169
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:08,790
Yuchen,

170
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,270
did you forget?

171
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,630
You said you didn't want to
be the father of two brats.

172
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,000
Chen!

173
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,310
Since you don't like her...

174
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,150
Why...

175
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,270
You...

176
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,520
You...

177
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,920
Considering we will meet again in the future,

178
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,120
this slap is to teach you to

179
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,070
show a bit more respect to my kids.

180
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,270
Don't let these filthy words

181
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,600
reach my kids' ears.

182
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,840
Yuchen!

183
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,960
You will regret it!

184
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,180
(Pediatrics)

185
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,240
Where are you taking me?

186
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,720
Where exactly are you taking me?

187
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,390
Get in the car.

188
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,720
(Where should I put my hands?)

189
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,920
Take it off.

190
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,910
Look, this isn't urgent.

191
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,360
We need to time it right
to make it easier to succeed.

192
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,350
Change into it.

193
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,320
We're going to

194
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,440
get marriage license.

195
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,960
License?

196
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,360
What? Are you backing out?

197
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,480
Marriage?

198
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,870
But he's a thug.

199
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,030
What if he refuses to divorce later?

200
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,390
Spend your whole life with him?

201
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,150
I mean...

202
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,510
Just get married, no license.

203
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,360
Temporary marriage agreement, keep it simple.

204
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,240
No license? You expect me
to have children with you?

205
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,390
What if you run off?

206
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,720
Besides,

207
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,080
what if you turn it around

208
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,440
and accuse me of trafficking?

209
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,200
Who am I going to talk to about that?

210
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,720
What do you want?

211
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,000
Your ID as collateral.

212
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,840
We'll sign as is.

213
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,790
Otherwise, no deal.

214
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,200
Agreed.

215
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,360
No wedding celebrations.

216
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,510
No talking about assets.

217
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,900
Live together, no strings attached.

218
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,870
You must cooperate with me before my mom.

219
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,440
Or I'll terminate the agreement at any time.

220
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,920
Rest assured.

221
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,390
Pleasure working with you.

222
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,080
ID card.

223
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,560
Pleasure.

224
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,980
(Bu Yan)

225
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,870
Sir, please lean in toward the girl.

226
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,120
And you,

227
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,270
lean your shoulder toward him.

228
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,790
Make it a bit sweeter, and give me a smile.

229
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:47,720
A little more sweetness.

230
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,320
Perfect, that's great.
