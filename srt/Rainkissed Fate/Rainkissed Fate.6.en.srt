00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,160
Nice!

4
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,390
- Good shot!
- Beat him!

5
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:50,990
Come on!

6
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:51,990
He's cheating!

7
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:56,800
Beat him to death!

8
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:57,910
He's cheating!

9
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,190
No,

10
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,350
this is a no-holds-barred fight.

11
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,710
There are no rules.

12
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,480
You can use anything
to take down your opponent.

13
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,070
Even weapons.

14
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,000
Beat him to death!

15
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,070
Go Monkey!

16
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,350
Monkey! Monkey! Monkey!

17
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,640
If Monkey wins,

18
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,870
you won't get a penny.

19
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,190
Well done!

20
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,190
Relax.

21
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,640
We've got experience
with fixing fights.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,950
First, we'll beat your husband

23
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:31,350
to the brink of death,

24
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,150
then Monkey will fake a knockout,

25
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,230
letting your husband "win".

26
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,400
That way, you get the money,

27
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:36,790
and we get our revenge.

28
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:37,800
Perfect, right?

29
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:39,950
You jerks!

30
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,120
He Yuchen!

31
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:44,830
Get up and hit him!

32
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,480
He Yuchen!

33
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,870
Get up and hit him!

34
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,680
Stand up!

35
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,230
Get up and hit him!

36
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,120
He Yuchen!

37
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,600
He Yuchen!

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,240
Monkey, are you okay?

39
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,840
Monkey, get up!

40
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,120
He's tough to take down.

41
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,560
Get him, hit him.

42
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,550
Come on!

43
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,630
Beat him to death, Monkey!

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,430
Don't worry,
it's almost over.

45
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,270
Let go of me.

46
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,870
- Let go of me!
- Your temper suits me.

47
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,120
- Be with me.
- Don't touch me.

48
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,400
You won't have to live in fear every day.

49
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,710
Don't be nervous.

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,360
You like playing with fighters?

51
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,360
- I promise.
- Let go.

52
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,430
- I'm more fun than He Yuchen.
- Don't touch me.

53
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,000
Congratulations, the money's yours.

54
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,800
Let's go.

55
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,840
- Grab them!
- Chase them!

56
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,870
- Grab them!
- Don't let them get away!

57
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:15,710
Don't run!

58
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,150
Go.

We need to find a way.

65
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,800
Why is there no signal?

66
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,120
You go first.

67
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,080

71
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,910
What about you?

72
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,200
I won't die.

73
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,960
(The only way is to
get out and bring help.)

74
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,630
(Staying here will only hold him back.)

75
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,190
(In the end, we'll both be finished.)

76
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,000
Did you hear what I said?

77
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,920
Hurry up and leave!

78
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,760
Okay.

79
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,160
Where are they?

80
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,390
(That's more like her.)

81
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,390
Search over here.

82
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,960
Over there!

83
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,150
After her!

84
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,960
Stop!

85
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,480
Feifei, where are you?

86
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,840
Where are you?

87
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,240
Almost there, almost there.

88
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,480
Is everything okay?

89
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,750
Do you have enough people?

90
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,310
As you said, I call
the company's all guards.

91
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,430
They're all here.

92
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,600
Good, hurry up, hurry up.

93
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,800
Almost there, just a few minutes away.

94
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,000
If anything happens to Yuchen,

95
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,310
I will never forgive you.

96
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,160
Go, hurry, go.

97
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,390
Over there, over there.

98
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,390
- Which side.
- This side.

99
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,230
That way.

100
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,720
- Ms. Bu
- Hurry!

101
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,190
- That way!
- Bu Yan, are you okay?

102
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,080
I'm fine.

103
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,470
What about the kids?

104
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,480
They are fine. Don't worry.

105
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,160
He Yuchen is still inside, hurry.

106
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,240
Hurry, that way.

107
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,270
Come on.

108
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,920
Hello, teacher.

109
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,310
Are the kids okay now?

110
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,720
Ms. Bu,

111
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,510
why couldn't I reach you on the phone?

112
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,800
They are getting anxious.

113
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,830
They're not in a good state.

114
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,000
Please come quickly.

115
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,200
Alright.

116
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,920
Sorry, I'm on my way.

117
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,150
Yan,

118
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,110
it's been five years.

119
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,920
I'm back.

120
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,750
You're back. Did you pick up the kids?

121
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,720
Thank you for today.

122
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,070
It's so late, you should hurry back.

123
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,270
I'll treat you to barbecue another day.

124
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:31,360
Yuchen, let me help you with the injuries.

125
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,330
I'll do it myself.

126
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,270
You've got too many injuries.

127
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,700
It's hard for you to handle.
Let me help.

128
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,750
Really, it's fine.

129
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,440
Yuchen,

130
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,510
why are you avoiding me
so urgently?

131
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,070
Because of that woman who ran off
and left you?

132
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,950
That woman is my wife.

133
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,080
Feifei.

134
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,270
You finally have signal.

135
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,680
I've called you several times.

136
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,390
How's He Yuchen? Did you save him?

137
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,800
We were a step too late.

138
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,800
He Yuchen was rescued by his brothers.

139
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,920
As long as he's safe.

140
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,480
Thank you, Feifei.

141
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,510
And please thank everyone
who came to help.

142
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,000
Don't worry, leave it to me.

143
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,480
He Yuchen is...

144
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,680
He is a fisherman from Haifeng Village.

145
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,070
Now he is my husband.

146
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,070
Mom, I'm so sleepy.

147
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,160
Alright, we're home.

148
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,150
Time to sleep.

149
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,840
I live here.

150
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:45,790
Bu Yan,

151
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:53,070
you... live here?

152
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,560
Thank you for bringing me back.

153
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,720
- Let me hold Sheng.
- Yan.

154
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,680
You should head back now.

155
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,070
I'll take them back to sleep.

156
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:09,920
Yuchen!

157
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,510
Yuchen, wait a moment.

158
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,360
Looks like I came back
at the wrong time.

159
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,000
I interrupted something, didn't I?

160
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,120
It really is the wrong time.

161
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,030
Do you even know how late it is?

162
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,390
Bu Yan,

163
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
bringing a man home

164
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,320
in the middle of night...

165
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,630
isn't that a bit too much?

166
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,350
Chen Wenli,

167
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,510
this is my family matter.

168
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,550
It has nothing to do with you.

169
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,840
You go back first.

170
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,200
Why are you leaving?

171
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,240
Explain to me how I'm
being "too much".

172
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,470
Yan,

173
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,160
I'm sorry.

174
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,150
If I had known back then
that breaking up

175
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,600
would lead to you
marrying a man like this

176
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,390
and suffering like this,

177
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,200
I would never have let you go.

178
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,080
Breaking up back then?

179
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,960
So, an ex-boyfriend, huh?

180
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,320
What are you doing?

181
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,510
What am I doing?

182
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,360
I am your husband,
this is my son.

183
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,970
Holding him is only natural.

184
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,080
What's wrong?

185
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,910
Is cheating during marriage
also "only natural"?
