12
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:39,990
does it hurt?

13
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,150
Six years ago,

14
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,590

15
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,560

16
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,520
Why do you believe it?

17
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,000
Because the He Yuchen of today,

18
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,800
even when threatened with his life,

19
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,190
refuses to throw a fight.

20
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,630
So why would
the He Yuchen of the past,

21
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,870
at the peak of his career,
ever give in?

22
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,870

23
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,750

24
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,710

25
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,120
