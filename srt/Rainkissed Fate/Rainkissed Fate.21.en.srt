=Episode 21=

3
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,150
How can you do this?

4
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:48,400
You dare hit me?

5
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:49,960
You deserve it.

6
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,190
Wenli, who is she?

7
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:53,360
I am Bu Yan.

8
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,110
Bu Yan? The heiress?

9
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,550
What kind of heiress is she?

10
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:02,230
A rejected daughter kicked out by Dr. Bu?

11
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,590
You really think
you're still the Bu Family heiress?

12
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,000
I think you are

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,430
not an heiress.

14
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,430
Yes.

15
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:12,870
Let me guess,

16
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,150
what are you here for?

17
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:18,430
Came to beg Mr. Bu to forgive you?

18
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,350
What am I doing here?

19
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,150
I don't need to report to the employees.

20
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,120
But you all

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,640
gossiping during work hours.

22
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:28,510
Maybe you should finish
your resignation process.

23
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,150
Then you'll have more time for gossip.

24
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,430
Bu Yan.

25
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,950
You really love your drama, huh?

26
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,360
First fake marriage,

27
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:38,950
then fake pregnancy,

28
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:41,070
and now you're playing fake boss?

29
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:41,920
Is that it?

30
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,230
Let me tell you.

31
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,390
You're nothing special now.

32
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,230
I suggest you leave now.

33
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:48,560
So you're telling me to leave?

34
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,280
Are you the manager?

35
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,430
Or the security?

36
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,200
Wenli is a favorite of Mr. Deng.

37
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,790
Let me tell you.

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,200
I'm not security,

39
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,680
but I can call them

40
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,950
to kick you out.

41
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,760
Security!

42
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,470
What's wrong, Ms. Chen?

43
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,510
Kick her out.

44
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,160
Throw me out?

45
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,280
You'll have to go through
the board of directors first.

46
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,360
Let's see if you're even qualified for that.

47
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,320
Why need the board?

48
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,510
Mr. Deng can do it.

49
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,320
Then try it.

50
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,920
You'll regret it soon enough.

51
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,950
Okay.

52
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,200
The new CFO is coming.

53
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,790
You'd better shape up.

54
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,760
A new boss always makes waves.

55
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,820
(Chen Wenli)

56
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,710
She wants to see the financial reports
from the last six years.

57
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,510
The number you have dialed
is temporarily unavailable.

58
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,600
Please do not hang up.

59
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,030
The number you have dialed
is currently in use.

60
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,240
Mr. Deng is probably in a meeting.

61
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,950
He'll be here once it's over.

62
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,080
Right.

63
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,510
Can't get through?

64
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,200
Let me help you.

65
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,480
The CFO's not someone you want to mess with.

66
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,320
That Chen Wenli, I've been too nice to her...

67
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,500
(God CFO)

68
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,150
Ms. Bu,

69
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,110
I am preparing the materials for you.

70
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,470
I am in the lobby.

71
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,360
What?

72
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,600
You're here?

73
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,390
Yes, I'm here.

74
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,910
- Someone wants to kick me out.
- Still pretending?

75
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,320
Saying you have the right to do so.

76
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,840
Come over here.

77
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,510
Help me with the resignation.

78
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,310
Stop putting on airs.

79
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,040
Get out before Mr. Deng arrives.

80
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,190
Or you'll just

81
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,320
embarrass yourself.

82
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:45,920
I'm not worried.

83
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,160
Why are you?

84
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,550
- Mr. Deng.
- You're here.

85
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,080
Ms. Bu.

86
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,750
I thought you were coming tomorrow.

87
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,030
Why didn't you inform us in advance?

88
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:56,990
Do I need to

89
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,910
report to you for?

90
00:03:58,910 --> 00:03:59,750
No, no.

91
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,080
About the resignation

92
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,230
in the phone call.

93
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,710
That was a joke, wasn't it?

94
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,320
Ask them.

95
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,120
Are they joking?

96
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,750
Mr. Deng, you...

97
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,590
Chen Wenli.

98
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,320
You tried to push Ms. Bu out?

99
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,190
Who do you think you are?

100
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,590
- Who are you?
- I...

101
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,630
When did HR matters

102
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,710
become your business?

103
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,560
No, I...

104
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,320
Mr. Deng,

105
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,940
isn't she the one who messed things up?

106
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,030
What's she doing here?

107
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,350
What nonsense are you talking about?

108
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,800
Ms. Bu is our CFO,

109
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,320
appointed by the board.

110
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,470
Ms. Bu.

111
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,590
She...

112
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,300
- She is...
- By the way,

113
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,480
I came to

114
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,630
check something

115
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,480
with you.

116
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,330
Please.

117
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,760
Did my father ask you

118
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,920
to bring Dr. Guo back,

119
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,560
or was it Chen Wenli?

120
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,360
Send someone to pick up Dr. Guo.

121
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,680
Don't worry, Mr. Bu.

122
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,190
Mr. Deng, please give me

123
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,270
Dr. Guo's contact.

124
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,150
If you help me,

125
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,080
I'll repay you.

126
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,510
Sure, then you can pick up
Dr. Guo for me later.

127
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,680
Ms. Bu,

128
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,000
you must be kidding.

129
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,070
How could it be Chen Wenli?

130
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,600
I don't have that kind of influence

131
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,910
to invite Dr. Guo.

132
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,630
It was Mr. Bu's doing.

133
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,240
I just picked up Dr. Guo.

134
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,000
Mr. Deng, are you turning your back on me?

135
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,880
Chen Wenli,

136
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,320
you really think I brought

137
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,440
Dr. Guo in for you?

138
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,630
He's a big deal in medicine.

139
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,800
You think I can just call him?

140
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,430
It was the Mr. Bu who arranged that

141
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,830
for Ms. Bu.

142
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,400
I...

143
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,320
Then I...

144
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,440
You're full of yourself.

145
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,590
Talking nonsense.

146
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,070
Ms. Bu isn't holding this against you today,

147
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,430
but the company won't tolerate

148
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,720
employees who lie and cause trouble.

149
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,190
She thought she was special

150
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,510
just because Mr. Deng was after her?

151
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,750
Now look where she's ended up.

152
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,920
Look at her,

153
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,640
trying to kick people out.

154
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,560
Acting like

155
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,200
she runs the place.

156
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,030
From now on,

157
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,240
just stick to your job

158
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,000
and keep a low profile.

159
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,190
Ms. Bu's getting engaged?

160
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,120
Really?

161
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,880
- Really?
- Ms. Bu.

162
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,440
Congratulations.

163
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,870
It really is.

164
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,360
She's engaged to the son of the Tang family!

165
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,950
(Notice)
Seems like Ms. Bu's a big deal to Mr. Bu.

166
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,720
They even gave the day off for the engagement!

167
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,950
Tang family's a big player in business.

168
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,120
This engagement

169
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,630
is also a big win for us.

170
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,510
Indeed.

171
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,000
(Big news indeed.)

172
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,950
(I wonder how Mrs. He)

173
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,710
(will react to this.)

174
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,100
(Notice)

175
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,700
Mom.

176
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,020
You just got out of the hospital.

177
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,820
You still need to rest.

178
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,060
Eat something nutritious.

179
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,540
Tell me,

180
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,460
are you still planning to
go see that Bu Yan?

181
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,260
Why do you have

182
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,020
such a problem with her?

183
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,860
(Because of)
- Mom.

184
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,460
(your dad's death.)

185
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,340
(So you two can never be together.)

186
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,020
Because she's from

187
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:14,020
the Bu family.

188
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,740
Mom, Bu Yan isn't like

189
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,660
the rest of the Bu family.

190
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,660
Look for yourself.

191
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,500
See.

192
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,620
(CFO Bu Yan, to be engaged to Tang Ze,
heir of Tang Group, in three days.)

193
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,220
You think she's your wife.

194
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,140
Does she think the same?

195
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:38,900
Yuchen,

196
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,180
what are you doing?

197
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,500
Unless she tells me herself,

198
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,780
I won't believe a word.

199
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,140
Dad,

200
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,060
what's going on with the announcement?

201
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,620
How can you arrange my marriage without my say?

202
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,980
You came to me,

203
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,860
saying you'd accept any condition.

204
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,540
You've met the first condition.

205
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:08,700
The second is the engagement to Tang Ze.

206
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,940
You didn't mention that condition.

207
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,140
Even if I did,

208
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,700
would you refuse

209
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,220
to save He Yuchen's mother?

210
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,140
Business is all about profit.

211
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,180
This time, Tang Group helped
fill the financial gap

212
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,580
for Hongfu.

213
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,660
Tang Ze's background, looks, and career

214
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,980
are miles ahead of He Yuchen's.

215
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,020
And he's in love with you.

216
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,820
I think it's a good match.

217
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,620
Just follow through with the agreement.

218
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,700
But I'm not a product.

219
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,020
I don't agree.

220
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,580
Even if his mother

221
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,100
was out of the hospital,

222
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,780
she still needs further treatment from Dr. Guo.

223
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,740
Without my help,

224
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,220
will he be able to manage?

225
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,660
I'm sure you don't want to see

226
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,940
He Yuchen lose his only family.

227
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,820
I thought you really wanted me back,

228
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,180
but I was wrong.

229
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,060
Your coldness and selfishness

230
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,260
haven't changed at all.

231
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,820
Bu Yan, I am your father.

232
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,500
Everything I do is for your own good.

233
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,060
Of course, you can choose.

234
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,420
If you insist on breaking off the engagement

235
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,100
and being with He Yuchen,

236
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,140
I'll break one of his arms

237
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,660
and end his boxing career.

238
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,860
His mother's treatment will stop too.

239
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,220
The marriage between Hongfu Group
and Tang Group

240
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,500
has attracted a lot of media attention.

241
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,140
I'm sure

242
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,140
you know what to do.

243
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,620
Also, you should move back home.

244
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,820
He Yuchen can't compete with Mr. Bu.

245
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,060
If you insist on being with him,

246
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,940
it's only him who will get hurt.

247
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,420
If he loses his mother and his career

248
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,300
because of you,

249
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,620
do you think he'll stay with you?

250
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,420
You'll probably move back
to the Bu family soon.

251
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,020
See you at our home.

252
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,020
What do you mean?

253
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,580
Everyone knows we are engaged.

254
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,140
When you move back to the Bu family,

255
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,180
I'll move in

256
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,220
as your fiancé.

257
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,660
Mr. Bu arranged this for me

258
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,100
to take care of Xiang.

259
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,420
Don't waste your effort.

260
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,020
Even if I move back,

261
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,540
it's not because of the engagement,

262
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,540
it's for Yuchen.
