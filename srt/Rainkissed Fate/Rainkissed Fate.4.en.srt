I'm heading out first.

16
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,280
I need to stay at the hospital tonight.

17
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,200
Come quickly.

18
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:23,550
Look.

19
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,680
Look.

20
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,590
Look.

21
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,750
What's wrong with your mouth?

22
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,240
Nothing.

23
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,630
- Look.
- Look, there's a snail.

24
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,560
The scenery in this village is quite nice.

25
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,190
The company has me during this time.

26
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,370
- Don't worry.
- There's more over there.

27
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,430
It's great to have you.

28
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,030
Who else would do it
if not the godmother of the kids?

29
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,860
I'm sure I can find it.

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,840
By the way,

31
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,750
you two...

32
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,630
Don't mention it.

33
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,800
Don't be too resistant.

34
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,030
For Xiang,

35
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,630
there's no other choice.

36
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,190
I can accept it logically.

37
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,520
But he's a young man

38
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:07,870
at the prime of his life.

39
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:08,710
He just

40
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,150
left like that.

41
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,960
Why?

42
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,310
Could it be that

43
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,470
he has already passed his prime?

44
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,400
Six years ago, he was vigorous.

45
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,840
So much time has passed.

46
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,750
He is like an old, malfunctioning machine.

47
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,310
It can no longer operate properly.

48
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,840
What should we do then?

49
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,800
Think of another plan.

50
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,310
Hello?

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,280
Okay, thank you, Doctor Chen.

52
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,310
Alright.

53
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,960
Got it.

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,870
Okay, I'll do it quickly.

55
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:57,710
Alright.

56
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,680
Separate rooms?

57
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,520
Then you go to sleep.

58
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,560
You're back.

59
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,750
Are you tired? Thirsty?

60
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,680
Have a glass of water.

61
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,080
No need.

62
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,630
I fell asleep because I was waiting for you.

63
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,270
If you don't drink, I won't be at ease.

64
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,870
Are you uneasy,

65
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,160
or do you have some bad intentions?

66
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,240
An apology?

67
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,870
Drink this, and we'll call it even.

68
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,870
Cheers.

69
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,030
I...

70
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:26,680
Mom,

71
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,370
I am thirsty.

72
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,400
You can't drink.

73
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:37,920
I told you

74
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,160
someone has bad intentions.

75
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,870
Mom is also very thirsty.

76
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,720

didn't Dad ever tell you

129
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,720
that enduring hardships is the way to success?

130
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,510
We've never seen Dad.

131
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,670
Never, not even once?

132
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,440
What about Grandpa and Grandma?

133
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,390
No Grandpa or Grandma.

134
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,510
Grandma passed away,

135
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,360
and Grandpa doesn't like us,

136
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,600
so we've never seen him either.

137
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,440
(No wonder she gives off)

138
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,840
(a feeling of "stay away from me")

139
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,840
(She's been doing this all alone for years,)

140
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,440
(She must have been through a lot.)

141
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,870

142
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:53,840
What?

143
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,870

144
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,600
who's such a handful,

145
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,790
I would also kick her out.

146
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,000
Don't talk bad about our mom!

147
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,360
She was kicked out

148
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,600
because she was protecting us!

149
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,790
I didn't mean it that way.

150
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,270
I mean

151
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,870
we are now a family.

152
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,510
I won't kick you out.

153
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,910
- Really?
- Of course.

He Yuchen,

155
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,120
you must not deceive us.

156
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,550
Of course, I won't deceive you.
