00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,820
=Episode 18=

3
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,450
Mr. Bu, was the suspension of
He Yuchen

4
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:47,470
- your doing?
- Please answer.

5
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:48,960
- Stop filming.
- Mr. Bu, don't leave!

6
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,790
How involved was Hongfu in this incident?

7
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,320
- Step back.
- Explain, Mr. Bu.

8
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,100
- Stop filming.
- Did Chairman Bu Honghui know about this?

9
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:54,950
We've heard that

10
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,280
Coach Zhao Ming's actions back then

11
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,030
were all under your direction.
What's your take on this?

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,430
- Don't leave!
- Say something.

13
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,640
- Please say something.
- Move aside.

14
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,560
Bu Yan.

15
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,400
Mr. Bu, do you have anything to explain?

16
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,150
Mr. Bu, say a few words.

17
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,920
Mr. Bu, don't leave, Mr. Bu.

18
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,760
How involved was Hongfu Group
in this incident?

19
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,280
- Step back.
- Explain, Mr. Bu.

20
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,200
- Stop filming.
- Did Chairman Bu Honghui know about this?

21
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:29,400
You've shown your cards

22
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,920
to those reporters.

23
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,710
What if I don't find that test result?

24
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:36,640
What will happen
to your reputation?

25
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,000
I didn't think that far.

26
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,120
I just felt you were more important.

27
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,200
You're important to me too.

28
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,280
- Mom.
- He Yuchen.

29
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,120
Be careful.

30
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,120
You're back.

31
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,400
- He Yuchen.
- Invincible.

32
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,510
- Hurry up!
- Be careful.

33
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,350
Catch him.

34
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,280
Okay, alright.

35
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,840
- Come on.
- He Yuchen, I miss you so much.

36
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,840
How should we do this?

37
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,190
Come on.

38
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,080
This blood relation is truly amazing.

39
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,590
When do you plan to tell them?

40
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,750
I'll wait until his mother
opens her heart to me.

41
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,750
Then I'll share this good news with them.

42
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,520
I don't want him to reject me

43
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,870
and then start doubting the kids.

44
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,710
My turn!

45
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,030
Come on, Sheng.

46
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,750
I've taught you

47
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,630
to think ahead.

48
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,150
Is your only move to slander

49
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,470
your sister and He Yuchen?

50
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,590
I'm doing this for the company.

51
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,560
He Yuchen can't be stopped

52
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,910
but he refuses to fix matches.

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,440
How can we control things
behind the scenes?

54
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,960
Since his suspension,

55
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,400
how much has the company made
in six years?

56
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:54,910
Don't you know?

57
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,630
But now?

58
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,590
With this public scandal,

59
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,590
do you know how much Hongfu has lost?

60
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,960
If Bu Yan and He Yuchen hadn't

61
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,030
exposed me,

62
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,590
the company wouldn't be in trouble.

63
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,280
Why don't you blame Bu Yan?

64
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,870
Why?

65
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,120
You still don't understand?

66
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,470
Your sister just went to a boxing match,

67
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,710
and everything went wrong.

68
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,190
Who drugged her?

69
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,710
Do I still need to say it?

70
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,180
(He found out six years ago)

71
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,320
(I drugged Bu Yan and He Yuchen)

72
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,960
(and ruined their reputation)

73
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,000
You investigated it.

74
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,960
When did you find out?

75
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,590
You didn't hesitate

76
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,030
to throw Bu Yan out.

77
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,150
It must've been after she left, right?

78
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,750
No wonder she cut ties with you.

79
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,840
You still don't see me, do you?

80
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,910
I said before, if you play too dirty,

81
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,400
you'll trip over your own schemes.

82
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,710
But you pushed me into this corner!

83
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,750
If you hadn't been so biased,
if you had trusted me,

84
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,030
none of this would've happened.

85
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:01,120
I wasn't around when you're growing up,

86
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,630
and I always felt guilty about it.

87
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,190
That's why, no matter what,

88
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,710
I never blamed you for anything.

89
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,520
Even when you made huge mistakes,

90
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,710
I cleaned up after you.

91
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,190
But that doesn't mean

92
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,040
you can do whatever you want.

93
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:21,800
That coach,

94
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,510
he was arrested for criminal activity.

95
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,510
Do you know what will happen to you?

96
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,870
Dad, I am your son.

97
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,430
You can't just care about my sister

98
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,360
and ignore me, can you?

99
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,600
Don't worry about the Group's matters.

100
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,510
You need to lay low for a while.

101
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:46,790
Dad,

102
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,680
are you firing me?

103
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,680
The company's interests come first.

104
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,720
No one with a criminal record
can join the exec team.

105
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,590
Dad,

106
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,560
I think the real issue is
that you can't accept me.

107
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,150
It is reported that

108
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,720
the boxing champion, He Yuchen,
was banned due to false accusations.

109
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,750
Coach Zhao Ming has been taken
in for questioning.

110
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,160
The event organizer, Hongfu Group,

111
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,480
is now caught in a public scandal.

112
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,560
Chairman of Hongfu Group, Bu Honghui,

113
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,680
has personally issued an apology

114
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,120
regarding the He Yuchen incident.

115
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,360
I deeply apologize for the unfair treatment

116
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,830
of boxing champion He Yuchen.

117
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,680
We are also willing to compensate him

118
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,560
for the mistakes made by Bu Jingyang.

119
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,830
Additionally, Hongfu Group has dismissed

120
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,950
Bu Jingyang from all positions

121
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,680
and has launched an internal investigation.

122
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,870
Bu Honghui.

123
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,360
Your friend is really something.

124
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,680
His company gets into trouble.

125
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,200
He's borrowing money from you
to cover the gaps.

126
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,040
That money was meant

127
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,830
for your son's college fund.

128
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,630
What if your friend
turns out to be a scammer

129
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,470
and takes all that money?

130
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:00,720
Honghui is not that kind of person.

131
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,430
We've been close friends
for half our lives.

132
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,270
I trust him.

133
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,440
Besides,

134
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,120
he borrowed money to save the company.

135
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,480
This money...

136
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,870
I'm investing in the company.

137
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,030
Don't worry.

138
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,240
I'll be back soon.

139
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,120
Who is this person?

140
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,680
- Why put it here?
- It's so bad luck.

141
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,680
Isn't this Yuchen's mom?

142
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,480
- Yuchen's dad?
- It's Yuchen's dad.

143
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,800
Mom, what happened to dad?

144
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,600
- It's really...
- Mom, don't cry.

145
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,630
Mr. He was stabbed by
an ex-employee of Bu Honghui

146
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,600
and on the way to hospital, he...

147
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,830
What about Bu Honghui?

148
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,070
Where is Bu Honghui?

149
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,070
Bu Honghui from Hongfu Group?

150
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,270
Bu Yan's father,

151
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,580
is him.

152
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,560
Mom.

153
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,840
Mrs. He.

154
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,360
I came here to tell you…

155
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,600
Actually, I am Hongfu...

156
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,440
Get lost!

157
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,640
Get lost!

158
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,130
Bu Yan.

159
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,880
Are you okay?

160
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm fine.

161
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,150
Mom.

162
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,680
The truth about my fixed matches

163
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,720
has been revealed to the public.

164
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,510
It was Bu Yan
who helped clear everything up.

165
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:31,270
I don't care if she
cleared it up for you or not.

166
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,440
She...

167
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,640
Mom.

168
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,360
She is...

169
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,720
- Mom!
- Bu...

170
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,190
- Mom!
- Bu...

171
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,040
Get her to the hospital!

172
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:47,820
(In Operation)

173
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,680
Doctor, how is my mom?

174
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,670
Your mother's condition is critical.

175
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,440
The only person in the country

176
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,910
who can perform this surgery is Dr. Guo,
who retired from

177
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,270
our hospital years ago.

178
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,480
So where is he now?

179
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,030
I'm sorry, I don't know either.

180
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,670
After Dr. Guo retired,
he stopped practicing.

181
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,440
The situation is urgent,

182
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,840
so please be prepared for the worst.

183
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,670
What do you mean?

184
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,550
Someone can save my mom right now.

185
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,070
You're telling me
to wait here and do nothing?

186
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,720
I understand how you feel,

187
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,480
but getting angry and upset

188
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,720
won't solve anything.

189
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,320
Yuchen.

190
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,030
After Dr. Guo retired,

191
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,750
there's one person
who can contact him.

192
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,920
Who is it?

193
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:51,840
As long as we can invite Dr. Guo,

194
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,240
I can do anything.

195
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,510
Your father.

196
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,480
That's why I didn't say it earlier.

197
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,440
Because He Yuchen had a falling out
with your father,

198
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,150
and exposed He Yuchen's fixed matches,
the ban,

199
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,630
and all the connections to Hongfu,

200
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,510
which led to Bu Jingyang
to flee the country,

201
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,120
and Hongfu's stock price plummeting.

202
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,320
In this situation,

203
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,870
I don't think your father will help you.

204
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,030
After all, Mrs. He's illness

205
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,270
was caused by me.

206
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,320
No matter what, I have to give it a try.

207
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:35,970
Hello?

208
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,550
Sorry, the person you're trying to reach

209
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,150
is unavailable.

210
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,030
Please try again later.

211
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,510
Open the door, is anyone there?

212
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,350
Open the door.

213
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,560
Open the door.

214
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,080
Dad.

215
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,870
It's Bu Yan.

216
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,720
Please, talk to me.

217
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,390
Dad!

218
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,270
Open the door!

219
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,150
- Go ahead.
- Dad!

220
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,440
What's so important that
you're making favors

221
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,030
and braving the rain to come here?

222
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:18,360
Mr. Bu, I'm Tang Ze.

223
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,270
Step needed a doctor's help.

224
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,320
This doctor happens to be my teacher.

225
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,030
I would like to introduce him to you.

226
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,510
Mr. Bu,

227
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,720
I know you've been

228
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,030
thinking about her
all these years.

229
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,270
You two are stubborn but soft-hearted.

230
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:35,030
All these years,
you've just needed an excuse.

231
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,080
If I can help smooth things

232
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,120
over between you,

233
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,120
it'll be a good deed.

234
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,680
Moreover,

235
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,030
right now, Hongfu is under attack

236
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,240
because of He Yuchen.

237
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,550
If Hongfu

238
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,720
helps the He family,

239
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,870
it could improve the Group's image.

240
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,910
Then, the Tang family will step in

241
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,870
to fill the gap for Hongfu.

242
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,440
Everything you're doing

243
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,080
is beneficial to both Hongfu and us.

244
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,480
What are you after?

245
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:05,990
All these years,

246
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,870
I have never forgotten Bu Yan,

247
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,600
and I don't want to see her
fall into another trap.

248
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,600
What do you mean?

249
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,240
Don't you know?

250
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,440
The man from six years ago,

251
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,510
is He Yuchen.
