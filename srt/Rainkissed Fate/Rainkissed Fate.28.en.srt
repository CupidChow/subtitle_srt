=Episode 28=

3
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,430
Wife and husband,

4
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,790
quite close, huh?

5
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:55,680
Bu Jingyang,

6
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,720
you brought me here

7
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,000
for the Hongfu shares, didn't you?

8
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:02,360
I'll give them to you.

9
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:13,070
For a woman,

10
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:14,640
you'd even give up the shares.

11
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,870
Impressive.

12
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,510
You got the contract.

13
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,760
Let Bu Yan and Xiang go.

14
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,790
Let's make things clear.

15
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,760
The contract was always mine to take.

16
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,790
It's not a deal.

17
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:27,640
Bu Jingyang!

18
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,750
Let me think.

19
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,200
If my sister were still around,

20
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,590
she'd always make me unhappy.

21
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,360
Dad would always favor her.

22
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,080
So...

23
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,000
She has to die.

24
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:47,870
I'll replace her.

25
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,310
Fine.

26
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,700
Let me think.

27
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:59,350
You're the one

28
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,510
who made it so I can't return home,

29
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,390
made my mom suffer with me.

30
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,950
You took my family's shares.

31
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,110
When I'm done with you,

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,390
I'll send your wife and kid after you.

33
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,440
You're asking for death.

34
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,480
Move aside.

35
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,360
If you've got the nerve, just do it.

36
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,030
But you'll never know

37
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,200
where Bu Xiang is.

38
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,470
The child will be buried with me.

39
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,360
Worth it.

40
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,950
Yan.

41
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,550
Another one.

42
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,600
Let's go.

43
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,510
I'm done playing with you.

44
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,760
Goodbye.

45
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,360
He Yuchen,

46
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,480
- Hurry, leave!
- Watch her blow herself up!

47
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,360

did you find Xiang?

00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,870
Yes, we found him.

85
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,870
He's been sent to the hospital by ambulance.

86
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:34,750
I'm working with the police

87
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,200
to provide evidence of Bu Jingyang's crimes.

88
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,590
Good.

89
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,680
Please sign here.

90
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,640
Your wound also needs attention.

91
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,030
It's okay.

92
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,950
All the paperwork is done.

93
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,030
How is the situation?

94
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,380
(In Operation)

95
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,200
Who's Bu Xiang's family?

96
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,720
- I am.
- I am.

97
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,360
I'm his father.

98
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,200
The child has developed

99
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,440
severe anemia due to complications.

100
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,360
The blood bank is low on resources.

101
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,480
Are any of you type A or O blood?

102
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,510
Come with me for transfusion.

103
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,350
I'm type A.

104
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,310
I'll do it.

105
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,800
Aren't you the child's father?

106
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,870
Immediate family can't give blood.

107
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,390
It could cause

108
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,030
a rejection reaction,

109
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,080
especially with

110
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,600
leukemia patients.

111
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,750
It's very risky.

112
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,670
A slight mistake

113
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,070
could be life-threatening.

114
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,590
I'm just his legal father.

115
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,640
Let me do it.

116
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,240
I'll go for a while.

117
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,470
Take care of

118
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,390
everything here.

119
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:10,550
Let's go.

120
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,390
(If Bu Xiang dies because of you...)

121
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,440
(You can't be together anymore.)

122
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:24,830
No way.

123
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,390
He can't.

124
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,240
I said he can't.

125
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,270
What's wrong with you?

126
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:37,880
I'm type O.

127
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,880
Use mine.

128
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,950
The same blood type is better.

129
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,710
Come with me quickly.

130
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,470
He's the child's father.

131
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,720
You won't tell me

132
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,040
that six years ago, after you slept with me,

133
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,640
you had these two brats?

134
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,710
Want to be a father?

135
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,590
Alright,

136
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,390
sign the contract with me,

137
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,320
and you can be their dad right away.

138
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,950
Why do you insist on marrying me?

139
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,000
The reason is...

140
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,800
It has to be you.

141
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,150
We haven't met Dad.

142
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,470
He's the biological father.

143
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,950
Yuchen,

144
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,040
I'm here to say goodbye.

145
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,350
Chen Wenli,

146
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,590
do you know?

147
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,440
You and Bu Jingyang

148
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,350
almost killed my wife and child.

149
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:15,800
I'm sorry.

150
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,710
I'm really sorry.

151
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,590
Get lost.

152
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,630
Don't ever show up in front of us again.

153
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,470
Yuchen, I...

154
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,420
(In Operation)

155
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,960
Bu Yan.

156
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:44,920
Bu Yan.

157
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,120
Goodbye.

158
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,200
Yuchen.
