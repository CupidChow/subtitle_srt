00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,470
(Sports News)
King Wang's invitation match starts today.

4
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,750
His opponent is He Yuchen,
the domestic champion

5
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,070
who was banned for five years

6
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,190
after being accused of fixing matches.

7
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,000
He recently made a comeback.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,790
Interestingly,

9
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:56,640
the two fighters were involved in

10
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,600
the match-fixing scandal years ago.

11
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,640
Now that He Yuchen has

12
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,560
cleared his name,

13
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,600
will he redeem himself?

14
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,840
Will today be a fight for fame

15
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,310
or a total defeat?

16
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,840
Let's wait and see.

17
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,390
He's here.

18
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:13,840
Look.

19
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,360
He's here.

20
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:15,480
Is it him?

21
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,720
It's him.

22
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,310
- Yuchen, go for it!
- Yuchen!

23
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,840
Yuchen!

24
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:23,200
Yuchen!

25
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,920
- Yuchen!
- It's him!

26
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,390
- Go for it.
- He Yuchen.

27
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,000
Come on!

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,870
Nice!

29
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,710
Go Yuchen!

30
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:35,790
- Go Yuchen!
- Keep going!

31
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,200
- I trust you.
- Go take a seat.

32
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:40,330
Let's go.

33
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,640
It's time.

34
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,670
Yuchen's looking good.

35
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,590
Go Yuchen.

36
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,120
Come on.

37
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,840
Come on Yuchen.

38
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,720
Keep it up!

39
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,640
Hit him!

40
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,510
Go for it!

41
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,040
Go, He Yuchen!

42
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,760
- Nice!
- Well done, He Yuchen!

43
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,030
Keep going!

44
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,800
He Yuchen, keep it up!

45
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,470
He Yuchen, go for it!

46
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,780
Hit him, He Yuchen!

47
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,040
He Yuchen, don't give up!

48
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,110
Strike quickly!

49
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,320
Keep pushing!

50
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,760
Hit him!

51
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,710
Alright!

52
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,990
Nice!

53
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,200
Can you have some faith in your man?

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,790
Go, He Yuchen!

55
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,790
The same old tricks.

56
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,800
You'll still be taken down
by the same old tricks.

57
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,320
Just testing your limits.

58
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,390
Now it's my turn.

59
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,750
Go, He Yuchen!

60
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,310
He Yuchen is amazing.

61
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,030
He Yuchen is incredible!

62
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,590
- Go, go, go!
- Come on, Yuchen.

63
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,080
Go, Yuchen.

64
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,510
Keep it up, He Yuchen.

65
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,040
Fight back.

66
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,440
You must hold on.

67
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,990
- Yuchen, fight back.
- What's happening?

68
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,750
He's really slowed down.

69
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,400
His opponent is a world champion, after all.

70
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,320
He Yuchen hasn't fought for years.

71
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,400
Why'd he even take this match?

72
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,480
All that hype for nothing.

73
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,480
Stand up!

74
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,510
Stand up, Yuchen.

75
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,440
Come on!

76
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:29,800
What a waste of my trust.

77
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,480
I shouldn't have trusted you.

78
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,400
Look at...

79
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,520
Can you all just shut up?

80
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,390
Go for it!

81
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,390
Keep going!

82
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,080
You can do it!

83
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,230
- Get up!
- Stand up!

84
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,810
You got this!

85
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,340
Stand up!

86
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,640
He Yuchen, go!

87
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,800
He stood up!

88
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,650
He's standing!

89
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,790
He Yuchen is on his feet!

90
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,830
Admit it, now I am

91
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,120
no longer the person

92
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,390
you defeated six years ago.

93
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,640
My punches

94
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,550
were forged in the world championships.

95
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,760
We are worlds apart now.

96
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,910
Good job, He Yuchen!

97
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,010
Hit him!

98
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,640
Knockout!

99
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,800
(For six years, you fought in the dark.)

100
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,680
(Countless underground matches
for your mother.)

101
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,200
(But now…)

102
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,750
(You're finally fighting for yourself.)

103
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,080
(A real boxing match.)

104
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,000
(He Yuchen.)

105
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,710
(Congratulations, you're living in the light.)

106
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,400
He Yuchen!

107
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,120
Amazing!

108
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,000
You won!

109
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,150
Well done!

110
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,870
Congratulations.

111
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:19,680
Thank you.

112
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:27,440
He Yuchen.

113
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,950
He Yuchen.

114
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:24,590
This is for you.

115
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,440
Bu Yan.

116
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,350
Is it a proposal?

117
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,680
Marry him.

118
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,430
Marry him, marry him!

119
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,270
Marry him.

120
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,360
Marry him!

121
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,680
Marry him.

122
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,070
The gift for engagement.

123
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,680
Marry him.

124
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,750
Marry him.

125
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,950
Say yes to him!

126
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,240
Say yes, say yes!

127
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,800
She said yes.

128
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,950
Forever together!

129
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,270
That's amazing!

130
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,440
Be happy!

142
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,440
You once said

143
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,590
you wanted your Dad

144
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,350
to be as strong as Transformers.

145
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,120
In the past,

146
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,390
I didn't deserve to be with you.

147
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,560
In the last five years,

148
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,560
I wasn't there

149
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,000
for you.

150
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,390
It's all my fault.

151
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,440
But now,

152
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,150
I hope you can give me a chance.

153
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,800
Let me protect you

154
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,160
and Mom.

Xiang,

157
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,870
would you give me another chance

158
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,560
and forgive me?

159
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,200
He's your dad.

160
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,990
He's your dad.

161
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,200
- Dad.
- Dad.

162
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,330
- Nice.
- Great.

163
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,670
Great.

164
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,010
- Great.
- Great.

165
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:47,610
Good.

166
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,950
That's great.

167
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,470
Congratulations.

168
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,080
Congratulations.

169
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,680
Thank you.

170
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,470
Hello, can you hear me?

171
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,990
Dear fellow villagers

172
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,750
of Haifeng Village.

173
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,200
Everyone,

174
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:40,680
it's me again,

175
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:44,350
I'm He Yuchen's fiancée.

176
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,840
Today, Yuchen and I

177
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,480
are officially married.

178
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,350
Great!

179
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,830
Congratulations!

180
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,470
I'll be here from now on.

181
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,440
I hope we'll get along well.

182
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,350
Great.

183
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,280
Great.

184
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,200
That's great.

185
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,960
This is how you

186
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,280
informed them?

187
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,030
It's very efficient this way.

188
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,390
Everyone is here.

189
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,560
Congratulations!

190
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,590
Yuchen,

191
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,870
you really wore me out!

192
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:19,960
In this heavy rain,

193
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,680
you want me to set up
500 banquet tables at dawn?

194
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,680
I finally managed to pull it off for you.

195
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:25,750
You need to

196
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,950
ask my wife about this.

197
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,200
If you marry a few more times,

198
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,840
I'd be exhausted.

199
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,990
Still, need to ask my wife.

200
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,360
Such a joyful day.

201
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,480
What are you talking about?

202
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,480
Then you go

203
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,670
get married a few more times.

204
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,590
No, that's not it.

205
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,400
A gentleman doesn't argue with a lady.

206
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,790
Don't talk like that.

207
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,390
That's just because you can't win.

208
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,280
Pfft.

209
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,400
Dad's still waiting.

210
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,960
The villagers are waiting for the feast.

211
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,800
Let's go.

212
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,440
Help me change out of

213
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,550
this dress.

214
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,590
Time to go light.

215
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,590
Oh, one more thing.

216
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,680
Hand me the bouquet.

217
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,670
It's time.

218
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,520
Get ready.

219
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,400
Ready.

220
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,870
One.

221
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:10,440
Two.

222
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,400
Three.

223
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:13,870
Here.

224
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,160
Here it comes.

225
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:17,750
Ma Hu,

226
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,750
what are you doing?

227
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,080
Grab the bouquet.

228
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,710
Bu Yan.

229
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,430
I love you.

230
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:33,040
Congratulations.
Double the joy coming your way!

231
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,170
