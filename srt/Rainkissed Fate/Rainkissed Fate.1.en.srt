3
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,760
Go for it, Monkey!

4
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:46,620
Come on!

5
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:47,640
Come on!

6
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,040
- Go for it, go for it!
- Come on, Monkey!

7
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:50,910
Hit him!

8
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:52,880
Go, Chen!

9
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,370
- Hit him, hit!
- Keep going!

10
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,230
Punch!

11
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,110
Come on, He Yuchen!

12
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:03,950
Good shot!

13
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:05,560
Go Monkey, beat him up!

14
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:06,840
(He Yuchen)

15
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,480
(Six years ago, in Pro Boxing Championship)

16
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,070
(Used banned substances in fixed matches)

17
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:13,790
(Banned from competition)

18
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,510
(Now in Haifeng Village)

19
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,590
(Fights in underground matches)

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,350
Ms. Bu, you're here.

21
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:25,550
I want him.

22
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:26,910
Got it.

23
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:28,950
Ms. Bu, please wait upstairs.

24
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:31,230
Go, Monkey!

25
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,510
Chen, hit him!

26
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,920
Make him cry like a baby!

27
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,040
Chen, hit him!

28
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:37,910
Hit him!

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,040
Won!

30
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,270
Get up, Monkey!

31
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,400
Get up, Monkey!

32
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,880
Ms. Bu.

33
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,200
The bonus is mine.

34
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,350
Of course, but there's a small issue.

35
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,880
Money,

36
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,640
you need to go upstairs
and get it from the backer.

37
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,080
You are the backer.

38
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,710
Where is my bonus?

39
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,150
Mr. He,

40
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,470
long time no see.

41
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,430
What?

42
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,910
You used me up for six years.

43
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,960
Changed your mind,

44
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,120
coming back to fix it?

45
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:43,750
Yes,

46
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,800
six years ago, you just slept with me,

47
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,680
and disappeared.

48
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,910
Now you reappear.

49
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,630
What do you take me for?

50
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,840
Your contract husband?

51
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,710
Here's the dowry: 10 million.

52
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,090
I bought your three months.

53
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,430
We still haven't settled the old debts.

54
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,240
Now you want me to be your contract husband?

55
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,720
You think a few money bills make you special?

56
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,160
Don't you want to
pay for your mother's treatment?

57
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,800
You've investigated me?

58
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:42,750
This match today...

59
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,240
It was all a setup to bait me, wasn't it?

60
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,800
How dare you!

61
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,110
He Yuchen,

62
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:58,000
this is a society with laws.

63
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,680
Don't try to scare me

64
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,680
with your dirty tricks.

65
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:04,720
Fine,

66
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,120
let me tell you,

67
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,630
I'm using all those tricks.

68
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,270
And I'm going to have you right now.

69
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,560
Okay.

70
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,190
Then I'll take that as your consent.

71
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,600
I'll start counting this towards

72
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,520
your performance.

73
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,800
You are hopeless.

74
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,920
I'm not interested in your shady business,

75
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,760
you rich people.

76
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,040
Find someone else.

77
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,310
If you think being a woman's lover insults you,

78
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,800
we could always arrange a marriage.

79
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,270
You'd better get your head checked,

80
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,800
and get some meds while you're at it.

81
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,400
Ma Hu!

82
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,560
Let's go.

83
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,020
(He Yuchen's Info)

84
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,800
Someone as morally corrupt as you,

85
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,680
easily bought with money.

86
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,750
I don't believe I can't win you over.

87
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,120
(Lover)

88
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,270
(Marriage)

89
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,750
(The scam's come all the way to me.)

90
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:09,800
You're so capable,

91
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,240
even managed to find my home.

92
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,560
- I...
- Mom!

93
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,840
Mom!

94
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,200
Mom!

95
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,430
- Mom!
- Xiang.

96
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,560
Didn't I tell you to wait for Mommy

97
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,720
in the car with your sister?

98
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,870
Why did you leave the car?

99
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,430
Bu Sheng said she was afraid
you'd be bullied by bad people.

100
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,870
This bad guy won't just bully your mom,

101
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,950
I'll throw you both in the sea
to feed the fish.

102
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,960
He Yuchen.

103
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,510
You're not telling me that

104
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,830
after that time six years ago,

105
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,360
you had these two little brats?

106
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,480
Want to be a dad?

107
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,470
Well, then

108
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,190
sign the contract with me.

109
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,070
You'll immediately be their dad.

110
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,630
They are not mine?

111
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,040
Then it's a single mom looking for a backup,

112
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,070
buying a poor dad for ten million.

113
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,750
Am I really that valuable?

114
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,600
If you think it's a bargain,

115
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,160
then sign the contract.

116
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,470
In these three months,

117
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,560
all you need to do is to
provide an heir for our family.

118
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,750
After three months, we'll go our separate ways.

119
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,630
I promise you'll never see me again.

120
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,200
How about it?

121
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,240
Leave an heir?

122
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,360
You already have two kids.

123
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,720
Now you want to have one with me too?

124
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,480
You rich people really play around, huh?

125
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,270
Like having kids is a hobby.

126
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,390
Be careful what you say in front of the kids.

127
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,470
Just tell me,

128
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,080
are you in or not?

129
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,390
I'll tell you...

130
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,870
Not in.

131
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,350
He Yuchen,

132
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,670
earning money through illegal boxing
is very dangerous.

133
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,080
Do you want to end up dead in the ring?

134
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,600
- Mom!
- Let me go.

135
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,120
- I'm fine.
- Mom!

136
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,960
Mom!

137
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,160
Mom!

138
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,280
Mom!

139
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,160
This is the last time.

140
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:10,870
Don't make me see you again.

141
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,630
I'm saying this one last time.

142
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:13,870
Are you in or not?

143
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,230
Mom!

144
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,280
Mom!

145
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,680
He Yuchen!

146
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,600
Mom, are you okay?

147
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,360
I'm fine.

148
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,440
Mom was just playing around with him.

149
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,910
He doesn't want to play with you.

150
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,960
Here's the paper plane
I just made for you.

151
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,080
Thank you.

152
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,150
Where did this come from?

153
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,510
(Marriage ad)
I found it on the ground.

154
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,860
(Marriage ad: He Yuchen only wants someone
who's down-to-earth to live with.)

155
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,670
Clearly eager to marry,

156
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,990
but won't take a wife and kids
that come to his doorstep.

157
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,740
(Marriage as: He Yuchen)

158
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:55,730
(He Yuchen)

159
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:56,840
(A marriage ad, huh?)

160
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,550
(I'll definitely be your wife.)
