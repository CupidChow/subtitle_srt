Are you talking about the contract?

00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,560

you were this kind of person.

But...

62
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,310
What kind of person?

63
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,680
You're still such a jerk.

64
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:17,630
I am a jerk.

65
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,920
But that's not what I wanted to say.

66
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,480
Then what did you want to say?

67
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,720
I am pregnant.

68
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,680

You're that happy?

70
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,360
If my parents know,

71
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,680
they'll probably be happy too.

Thank you for telling me all that before,

91
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,000
but I won't leave him.

92
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,360
(Since you refuse to leave him...)

93
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,710

This is called making
the most of what you have.

He Yuchen's comeback
generated a wave of hype.

104
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,120
Now that he's lost,

105
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,080
we can capitalize on it again.

The Internet gets its spectacle,

107
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,240
and the group-sponsored event

108
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,870
gets even more attention.

109
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,150
Isn't this a win-win?

110
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,350
You should always
leave some room for others.

111
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,600
Kicking someone when they're down
and leaving them no way out...

112
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,150
It'll come back to bite you.

113
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:22,270
Dad, are you lecturing me on
how to be a decent person,

114
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,320
or is it because

115
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,120
I'm targeting He Yuchen,

116
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,120
your son-in-law?

117
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,720
I am teaching you,

118
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,550
if you play too dirty,

119
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,870
you'll eventually trip over
your own schemes.

120
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,270
I have done so much for the Group.

121
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,200
But in your eyes,
not once have I done it perfectly.

122
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,870
You just think I'll never
measure up to my sister.

123

Yes.

Then I'll start stewing the fish.

They can have some soup
when getting home.

137
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,960
Ms. Bu, was it you
who had your husband, He Yuchen,

138
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,440
- throw matches?
- To make money for Hongfu Group?

139
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,480
Is that how far you'll go?

140
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,390
Please answer this.

141
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,860
You marry to the village
just to use He Yuchen?

142
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,270
Six years ago, it was Hongfu who reported

143
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,360
that He Yuchen was fixing matches.

144
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,360
The public deserves the truth.

145
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,080
- Miss Bu, please explain.
- Yuchen, let me explain.

146
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,240
I am from Hongfu,

147
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,890
- But I really didn't...
- Please.

148
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,480
Please, say something.

149
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:47,910
Six years ago, it was you who reported

150
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:48,870
He Yuchen for a fixed match.

151
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,720
Move aside.

152
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,390
I didn't fix matches.

153
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:53,150
Bu Yan had no involvement
in those fights.

154
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,200
As for who Bu Yan is
and whether she used me,

155
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,000
I know better than any of you.

156
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,790
You knew all along?

157
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,870
Was it you who took down
the trending topic?

158
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,870
To me, you're just Bu Yan.

159
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,270
Mr. He, you've been fixing matches before.

160
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,440
Are you still doing it now?

161
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,270
Can you guarantee
your past achievements were real?

162
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,480
Do you feel you've been
fair to your fans?

163
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,360
Can you swear you never
fixed matches before?

164
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,000
Please explain.

165
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,870
Give us an answer.

166
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,670
He doesn't owe anyone an explanation,

167
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,510
but you do.

168
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:29,790
Bu Jingyang, that day will come very soon.

169
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Ms. Bu, what does that mean?

170
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,150
- Please explain.
- Please explain.

171
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,670
Do not disturb our lives anymore,

172
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,240
or I'll take legal action.

173
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,600
Ms. Bu, please explain.

174
