=Episode 5=

3
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,000
Hello?

4
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Mom!

5
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,070
Mom, come save me, Mom!

6
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,110
- Xiang?
- Mom!

7
00:00:59,110 --> 00:00:59,950
Ms. Bu,

8
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,390
your son and daughter are in my hands.

9
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:03,960
Prepare one million.

10
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,710
Bring it to the Yanghe Chemical Factory.

11
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,920
I can bring the money.

12
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,280
But let me hear
their voices first.

13
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:13,590
Not too stupid.

14
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:14,710
Mom!

15
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,200
Save me!

16
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,040
Mom!

17
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,310
Let me talk to them.

18
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,400
Don't waste time.

19
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:22,640
Hurry and bring the money over.

20
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,760
I...

21
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,430
Don't call the police

22
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:36,950
or you'll regret it.

23
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,660
(He Yuchen)

24
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,580
(Bu Yan)

25
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,900
(Bu Yan)

26
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:54,760
Why are you here?

27
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,710
I'm worried about Mrs. He.

28
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,680
So I came to check on her.

29
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,280
She looks quite well today.

30
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,200
You don't need to
come to the hospital so often.

31
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,070
Why do you

32
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,040
always push me away?

33
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,000
Is it because you're worried about

34
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,190
what Bu Yan might think?

35
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,030
Yes.

36
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,280
But no matter what,

37
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,870
six years ago we...

38
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,440
I'm grateful for you,

39
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,280
but you know I...

40
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,190
You don't want me here?
Fine, I'll stay away.

41
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,140
(Hu)

42
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,310
What's wrong?

43
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,080
Is Yuchen next to you?

44
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,120
I can't reach him by phone.

45
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,470
He's not here.

46
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,870
What should we do then?

47
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,710
What happened?

48
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,310
I just ran into Monkey and his gang
at the store.

49
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,710
They said they're waiting for Bu Yan.

50
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,240
(Bu Yan)

51
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,710
(You'd be better off dead)

52
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,680
Alright,

53
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,400
I'll help you get in touch.

54
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,870
The number you have dialed
is currently switched off.

55
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,560
Please try again later.

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,280
He Yuchen, answer the phone.

57
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,150
He Yuchen.

58
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,910
(Has she been taking
her medicine properly?)

59
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,120
- Hello?
- Yuchen.

60
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,960
I think Bu Yan might've

61
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,520
been targeted by Monkey and his crew.

62
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,780
(Bu Yan)

63
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,640
Senior,

64
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,430
I already said

65
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,630
I don't know where Bu Yan is.

66
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,980
(Bu Yan)

67
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,960
Hello?

68
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,720
Something happened
with Sheng and Xiang!

69
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,760
What?

70
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,240
It's urgent.

71
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,560
Don't ask why.

72
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,510
Just do as I say.

73
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,350
Okay.

74
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,510
What happened to her?

75
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,630
Come on, harder!

76
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:45,710
Hit him!

77
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,880
Hit him!

78
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,560
Come on!

79
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,480
Mr. Hei is inside.

80
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,680
Mr. Hei, I'm going out to take a look.

81
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,400
Here she comes.

82
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,760
Where is my kids?

83
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,680
I want to see the kids first.

84
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,070
Shouldn't your kid
be at home at this hour?

85
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,160
Why are you asking me?

86
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,510
You don't think
I kidnapped your kid, do you?

87
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,750
That's illegal.

88
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,070
I don't do that.

89
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:43,910
Mom!

90
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,270
Mom, come save me, Mom!

91
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,360
Didn't expect an AI-generated voice

92
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,870
to scare you like that.

93
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,870
Just kidding,

94
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,920
don't take it so seriously.

95
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,070
No leverage, no money.

96
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,120
Your man's fighting
in the ring.

97
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,120
This is your bet money.

98
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,800
Trying to take money legally, huh?

99
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,480
Enough talk.

100
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,320
Tie her up!

101
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,270
Where are you going?

102
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,160
Let go of her.

103
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,160
Mr. Hei.

104
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,870
If you want me to fight,
let's talk about it.

105
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,430
Why did you call my wife here?

106
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,830
Let me take her home first,

107
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,000
and we can settle this between us.

108
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,430
You dare come here?

109
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,390
Hurry back with me.

110
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,160
Wait, don't rush off.

111
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,270
Last time in the ring,

112
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,600
you beat Monkey,

113
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,390
and that made things hard for him.

114
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,920
If you don't lose once
to set an example,

115
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:02,430
how can he keep his reputation?

116
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,360
Take a fall,

117
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,510
and I'll make sure
your wife leaves safely.

118
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,430
I don't throw fights.

119
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,430
Did I hear that wrong?

120
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,270
He Yuchen,

121
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,830
have you forgotten

122
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,830
why you ended up
in underground fights?

123
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,390
Six years ago,

124
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,560
during the Pro Championship,

125
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,630
you were banned for
throwing a match.

126
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:27,830
Tonight,

127
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,950
the winner of the Championship is...

128
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,240
He Yuchen!

129
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,360
He Yuchen,

130
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,950
you've been accused of
match-fixing.

131
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:39,830
Come with us.

132
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,590
Mr. Hei

133
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,480
I told you, I don't throw fights.

134
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,040
If you want to help Monkey
get his dignity back,

135
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,480
there are other ways.

136
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,070
You could do it six years ago,

137
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,570
but now you're acting
all high and mighty?

138
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,750
With a record like yours,

139
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,040
who are you trying to fool?

140
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,310
He said he won't throw the fight.

141
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,270
Mr. Hei, no need for all this trouble.

142
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,750
If you wanted to help Monkey,

143
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,830
you should've
come after He Yuchen

144
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,870
right after he won.

145
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:15,950
No need to wait this long.

146
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,040
You just want this money,

147
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,950
and to teach He Yuchen a lesson.

148
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,480
That's why you set me up.

149
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,270
He Yuchen,

150
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,430
your wife's something else.

151
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,950
Impressive.

152
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,240
I'll bet on him to win.

153
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,270
That way, the money goes straight
to your pocket.

154
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:42,710
Mr. Hei!

155
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,480
If you're still unsure,

156
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,800
we'll talk later.

157
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,360
Place your bets.

158
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,240
Wins and brings honor home.

159
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:56,960
And lose,
I'll take the money home.

160
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,600
Either way, we don't lose.

161
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,470
Fight seriously.

162
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,350
Mr. Hei,

163
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,220
you want me to get killed by him?

164
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:07,830
How am I supposed to beat him?

165
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,630
Oh, I forgot to mention the rules.

166
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,430
This is a

167
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,510
no-holds-barred fight.

168
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,670
What does that mean?

169
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:21,710
Monkey!

170
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,920
Go Monkey!

171
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,000
Come on, Monkey!

172
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,630
Go Monkey!

173
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,550
Go Monkey!

174
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,590
Get him, Monkey!

175
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,720
- Go!
- Go Monkey!

176
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,240
Come on!

177
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,870
Go!

178
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:48,750
Go Monkey, go!

179
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,120
Go Monkey!

180
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,790
Come on, hit him!

181
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,200
Fight back, Monkey!

182
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,720
Hold on, Monkey!

183
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,440
Come on, hit him!

184
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,870
Hit him, Monkey!

185
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,150
Go Monkey, go!

186
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,840
Go Monkey!

187
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,360
Go Monkey!

188
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,160
Take him down!

189
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,630
Good shot!

190
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,870
- Nice!
- Beat him!

191
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,470
