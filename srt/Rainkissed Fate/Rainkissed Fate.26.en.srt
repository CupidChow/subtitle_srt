=Episode 26=

3
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,320
Dr. Tang,

4
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,320
it's quite late.

5
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,280
You're going to Mr. Bu's room?

6
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,520
What's wrong?

7
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,230
Mr. He,

8
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,760
do you suspect me of harming Mr. Bu?

9
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,150
You'd better make sure
there's no trace.

10
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,920
If it was really me,

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,200
what would you do about it?

12
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,360
Do you have any proof?

13
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,560
If it was you, that would be perfect.

14
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,400
Make sure you handle it cleanly.

15
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,510
Finish him off,

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,870
then

17
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,430
I can use your hands

18
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,950
to get my revenge.

19
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:49,760
He Yuchen,

20
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,560
I will make sure you disappear from this house.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,840
Fine,

22
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,920
I'll wait.

23
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,790
I warn you,

24
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,510
stay away from Yan.

25
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,920
She's my fiancée.

26
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,560
And I won't back down.

27
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,040
Bu Yan is my woman.

28
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:12,160
And on this, I won't back down either.

29
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,080
He Yuchen,

30
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,040
you'd better know your place.

31
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,670
You should realize

32
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,200
that you and Yan won't have a good ending.

33
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,510
In the end, she's the one
who will get hurt.

34
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,880
If you think this through,

35
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,160
stay away from her.

36
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,950
How do you know,

37
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,230
you're not the one

38
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,920
hurting her?

39
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,360
Do you suspect me of harming Mr. Bu?

40
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,160
If it was you, that would be perfect.

41
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,080
If it really was me,

42
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,360
what would you do about it?

43
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,160
Do you have any proof?

44
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,990
(Why did Tang Ze say that?)

45
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,790
(It's connected to Tang Ze?)

46
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,150
(But he has no personal grudge against dad.)

47
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,390
(Why would he do this?)

48
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,270
(Where did things go wrong?)

49
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,510
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

50
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,680
Before Mr. Bu's incident,

51
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,280
he asked me to transfer all his shares

52
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,270
to Mr. He Yuchen.

53
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,510
Mr. Zhou,

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,670
did my father say why?

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,800
Why would he suddenly transfer shares

56
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,320
to someone with no blood relation?

57
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,310
Mr. Bu said once,

58
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,880
that he owed Mr. He.

59
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,600
Mr. Zhou,

60
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,760
did my father arrange anything else

61
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,640
besides the share transfer?

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,920
No.

63
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,960
After the transfer,

64
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,160
Mr. Bu didn't make any other
arrangements, and I left.

65
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,400
By the way, when I left,

66
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,790
Mr. Tang Ze came in.

67
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,160
He said he was there
to give Mr. Bu his medicine.

68
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,480
(Medicine?)

69
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,200
Big airplane.

70
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,190
When I left,

71
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,510
Mr. Tang Ze came in.

72
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,320
Move aside.

73
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,630
- Mom.
- Xiang, are you okay?

74
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,560
Let me see.

75
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,390
I'm fine, Mom.

76
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,030
Bu Yan.

77
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,760
Let's have a talk.

78
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,590
I'm a bit tired.

79
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,080
Do you want me to say this
in front of the kids?

80
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,830
Xiang, go to your room, okay?

81
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,670
Alright.

82
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,920
Let go!

83
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,150
Tang Ze, let go of me.

84
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:18,870
Are you scared of me?

85
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,080
Why are you scared of me?

86
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,200
I'm not.

87
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,470
Really?

88
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,350
Wasn't your behavior just now obvious?

89
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,080
Why are you treating me like this?

90
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,760
When I know Xiang's illness,

91
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,800
I switched from surgery to internal medicine.

92
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,270
I humbled myself to beg Dr. Guo.

93
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,120
I had a fallout with my mother for you.

94
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,270
I've done all this for you, but what about him?

95
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,040
He hurt you.

96
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,270
He hurt the Bu family.

97
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,040
You hate him.

98
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,440
Why stay with him?

99
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,150
I'm the one who's always loved you,

100
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,390
not him.

101
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,910
What you're doing isn't for me.

102
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,710
It's your own obsession.

103
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,880
You regret breaking up with me.

104
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,510
And now you want to take me back
from someone else.

105
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,880
I'm a person.

106
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,440
Not an object.

107
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,270
I don't belong to you.

108
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,640
No.

109
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,120
Yan.

110
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,710
I never saw you as an object.

111
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,950
You and my father made a deal,

112
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,680
without considering my feelings,

113
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,030
forcing me to accept the engagement.

114
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,120
Is this your so-called love?

115
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,950
I was wrong, Yan.

116
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,000
Everything I did, I did for you,

117
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,760
because I love you.

118
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,080
Yan, stay with me, please.

119
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,880
Let go.

120
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,320
You still don't understand.

121
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,080
Love has never been a transaction.

122
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,950
How would you know if you don't try?

123
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,880
Let go.

124
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,880
Don't come closer.

125
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,270
Did you become so cruel

126
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,950
after spending time with him,

127
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,080
or have you always hated me?

128
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,760
I never love you,

129
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:29,880
so there's no hate.

130
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,470
Even if I stay out of your business,

131
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,560
you'll never have a good ending.

132
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,560
Yan,

133
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,510
you're too naive.

134
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,440
Just wait and see.

135
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,640
You will come back to me.

136
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,270
I will be a good father.

137
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,270
And someone you can rely on.

138
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,470
I will find

139
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,950

Xiang needs a bone marrow match.

153
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,470
What illness does he have?

154
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:22,750
(He heard.)

155
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,950
He needs a bone marrow match.

156
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,160
Does he

157
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,630
have leukemia?

158
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,600
Why care so much?

159
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,630
It has nothing to do with you.

160
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:36,520
Right,

161
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:37,710
not my business.

162
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,990
What about Tang Ze?

163
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,950
He's the child's father?

164
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,280
Doesn't his match work for Xiang?

165
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,550
If it matched,

166
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,800
there wouldn't be much trouble.

167
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,950
I'll help you find one.

168
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,350
Are you a doctor? How?

169
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,920
I have my own channels.

170
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,990
Don't worry about it.

171
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,510
(Things have escalated to this point.)

172
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,520
(He doesn't know.)

173
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,710
(That's the best.)

174
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,950
(It's better for everyone.)

175
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,200
Did I misunderstand He Yuchen?

176
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,470
I thought he hurt you,

177
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,520
but my instinct tells me

178
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,080
he didn't.

179
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,400
Was it Tang Ze?

180
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:43,520
Dad.

181
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,870
Please wake up.

182
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,870
Tell me what happened.

183
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,320
Tell me what happened between our family

184
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,870
and the He family.

185
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,040
Ma Hu,

186
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,750
quick, call the doctor.

187
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,830
With the current situation,

188
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,520
Mr. Bu will wake up soon.

189
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,950
That's great, thank you

190
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,440
(If you wake up,)

191
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,680

00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,830
(So, it's better if you just stay quiet.)

194
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,960

195
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,080
Let's go check.

196
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,630
Why's the power out, Li?

197
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,040
It's me.
