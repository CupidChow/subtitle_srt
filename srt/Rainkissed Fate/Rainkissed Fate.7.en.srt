=Episode 7=

3
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,150
I don't owe you an explanation.

4
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,320
Mom, I'm sleepy.

5
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,670
Come, I will hold you.

6
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:02,710
This is my house.

7
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,280
I don't welcome
an ex-boyfriend here at this time.

8
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,310
Give me back my daughter.

9
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:10,710
Tang Ze,

10
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,680
you should go back and get some rest.

11
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,920
You can tolerate running into all this?

12
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:17,880
Bu Yan,

13
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:19,920
where's your pride from back then?

14
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:22,440
Now I have something

15
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,040
more important than pride to protect.

16
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:27,920
The kids?

17
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,640
But by choosing a father
like this for them,

18
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,350
have you considered their feelings?

19
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,280
He Yuchen.

20
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,370
Hug!

21
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,190
Come here.

22
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,070
Mom said you're really good at
beating up bad guys.

23
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,310
So cool!

24
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,000
Go back to the room and sleep

25
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,120
I'll give you 30 seconds
to deal with your ex,

26
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,280
then come inside and sleep.

27
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,590
Sir, the place is too small.

28
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,430
We won't keep you here.

29
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,750
He Yuchen.

30
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,840
Alright, go back to the room.

31
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:40,710
Okay.

32
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,030
As you can see,

33
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,080
the kids really like him.

34
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:03,430
And today, he protected me.

35
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,030
Go back and get some rest.

36
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,520
He Yuchen, you're injured.
You can't drink.

37
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,800
For a man, this doesn't count as alcohol.

38
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,870
- No.
- You can't drink.

39
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,190
How about water?

40
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,430
You are injured.

41
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,550
Okay.

42
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,030
I'll listen to Sheng.

43
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,960
I won't drink.

44
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,840
He Yuchen, why do you listen
to Sheng and not to me?

45
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,430
Don't you like me anymore.

46
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,030
We're both men.

47
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,870
Sheng is a girl.

48
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,750
Of course, men should protect girls.

49
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,590
Here.

50
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,960
A reward.

51
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,000
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

52
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,430
Sheng, Xiang.

53
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,590
- Come here.
- Mom.

54
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,520
Mom.

55
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,360
Alright.

56
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,260
Time to sleep.

57
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,670
Go on.

58
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:12,710
Your arm.

59
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,950
Lift it up.

60
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,160
I'm talking to you.

61
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,240
Let me apply the medicine.

62
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,230
What?

63
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,150
No mouth?

64
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,030
Can't even speak?

65
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,270
Caught red-handed, huh?

66
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,350
Feeling guilty?

67
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,360
Meeting your ex
in the middle of the night,

68
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,640
you think you're in the right?

69
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,510
Weren't you also cozying up

70
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,830
with your childhood friend?

71
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,510
So it evens out.

72
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,390
You were the one
who wanted to get married.

73
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,390
If being married to me

74
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,120
means giving up your
so-called pride and dignity,

75
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,630
you can go find that pretty boy.

76
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,510
I don't care.

77
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,510
Then you've misjudged me.

78
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,950
I've always been someone
who values commitment.

79
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,320
I'd never abandon a partner.

80
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,870
At least not during the contract period.

81
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,190
Yeah, decisive and

82
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,200
quick to leave.

83
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,240
Very committed indeed.

84
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,310
I sent people to help,

85
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,390
but I was a step too late.

86
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,950
You were already rescued
by Chen Wenli.

87
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,240
You went back?

88
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,390
I went to pick up the kids,

89
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,270
but I asked Feifei to bring a car

90
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,320
full of company guards to save you first.

91
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,430
What a ridiculous drama

92
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,760
I've stumbled into.

93
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,360
Finally, a chance for a beauty
to save the hero,

94
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,590
and I was still too late.

95
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:46,710
What?

96
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,560
You think I won't clarify myself,

97
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,880
and just let misunderstandings
sit here forever?

98
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,150
You're quite brave and resourceful, huh?

99
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,950
I'm sorry.

100
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,560
Were you always like this before?

101
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,760
Handling everything on your own.

102
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,920
If you were a single father,

103
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,870
raising two kids alone,

104
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:22,880
you'd understand

105
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,150
what it feels like
to rely only on yourself.

106
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,830
Who is the kids' father, really?

107
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,800

But you're partly to blame too.

117
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,870
Who told you to be such a jerk?

118
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,070
You slept with him and left.

119
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,150
It's all karma.

120
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,800
Repaying kindness with betrayal, huh?

121
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,680
After all the help I've given you...

122
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,560
Do it yourself.

123
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,800
What are you doing?

124
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,830
Your wounds shouldn't get wet.

125
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,590
Let me use warm compresses on them.

126
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,750
No need, I'll do it myself.

127
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,310
Don't move.

128
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,150
Stay.

129
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,390
You.

130
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,000
I won.

131
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,590
Come here.

132
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,320
Stand properly.

133
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,270
Be careful, hands on top.

134
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,150
Put it over there.

135
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,030
In the chemical factory...

136
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:44,950
Thank you.

137
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,590
What did you say?

138
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,870
Don't move.

139
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,440
How did you get this injury?

140
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,800
Where is Bu Honghui?

141
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,160
You?

142
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,080
Trying to find our Chairman Bu?

143
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,160
You should know your place.

144
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,670
Exactly.

145
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,200
Before, Hongfu invited you to fight,

146
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,040
and you refused.

147
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,560
Now that you're a fake boxing champion,
you come knocking?

148
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,630
Whether I threw fights or not,

149
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:28,560
Hongfu knows best, don't they?

150
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,320
He Yuchen,

151
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,230
your only mistake was
choosing the wrong side.

152
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,560
I'll handle it myself.

153
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:40,870
You're even troublesome

154
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,160
than the kids.

155
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,280
Do you really want to help me bathe,

156
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,800
or are you trying to sleep with me?

157
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,230
Get your facts straight, okay?

158
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,120
That was originally written
in the contract.

159
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,440
It's you who never followed through.

160
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,480
Like I've been scheming to sleep with you?

161
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,480
Isn't that right?

162
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,320
Yes.

163
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,350
I want to sleep with you.

164
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,550
But I'm not that heartless.

165
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,950
Even if you want to now,

166
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,200
I'd still worry about your... condition.

167
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,240
What?

168
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,160
What do you mean?

169
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,350
Your "quality" isn't up to par.

170
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,830
What do you mean?

171
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,230
What quality is not good?

172
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,200
What a ridiculous drama

173
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,580
I've stumbled into.

174
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:42,200
Finally, a chance for a beauty
to save the hero,

175
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,560
