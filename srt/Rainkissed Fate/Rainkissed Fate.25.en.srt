75

Does it still hurt?

76
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,870
My tummy doesn't hurt.

77
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,240
My arms don't hurt.

78
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,760

00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,800
How could you lie to Mom?

82
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,600
I didn't lie.

83
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,790
Mr. Tang told me

84
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,760
Xiang was sick

85
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,710
and missing.

86
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,710
So,

87
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:15,040
he asked me to get Mom
to find him together.

88
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,150
I'm sorry.

89
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,510
I was wrong.

90
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,630
I shouldn't blame you.

91
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,950
I should've asked more carefully.

92
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,080
I was wrong.

93
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,950
It's my fault.

94
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,880
Sheng, don't cry.

95
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,590
I'm sorry, Sheng.

96
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,720
Sorry, it's all my fault.

97
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,560
Xiang,

98
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,270
did you run off?

99
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,110
Hug.

100
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,000
- He Yuchen
- Mom, hug me.

101
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,510
Hug me.

102
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,710
I'm sorry, Sheng.

103
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,390
Alright,

104
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,270
why are you upset again?

105
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,120
We made a promise.

106
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,430
You said you wouldn't kick us out,

107
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,760
but now you are.

108
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,560
Look, the fairy
is apologizing too.

109
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,480
Can you tell me

110
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,950
what do I need to do
to make you forgive me?

111
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,310
I didn't kick you out.

112
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,430
Didn't I move in

113
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,320
with you?

114
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,630
I'll feel bad

115
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,560
if you keep crying.

116
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,960
Sheng,

117
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,230
come here.

118
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,760
Sheng, don't cry.

119
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,680
Mom said sorry.

120
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,310
What should you say to Mom?

121
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,750
It's okay, Mom.

122
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,710
I forgive you.

123
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:35,240
You cried like a little fog.

124
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,070
Croak, croak.

125
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,590
Alright, Sheng, don't cry.

126
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,720
There, there, don't cry.

127
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,240
No more tears, alright?

128
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,120
Croak, croak.

129
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,440
Little frog.

130
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,950
You two need to go to bed now.

131
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,080
- Come on.
- Let's go.

132
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,560
Mom will read you a story.

133
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,150
Promise?

134
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:12,150
Can someone find out

135
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:17,030
what the humans are up to?

136
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,150
King Tiger...

137
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:27,210
Yan,

138
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,000
I came to talk to you.

139
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,320
The kids are all asleep.

140
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,320
I don't want to wake them.

141
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,150
Let's talk tomorrow.

142
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,700
Yan,

143
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,640
I'm sorry for today.

144
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,080
I made Sheng lie.

145
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,200
I was just worried about you.

146
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,800
With what happened today,

147
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,880
I was afraid something might happen to you.

148
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,880
I'm fine,

149
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,080
but you know Xiang isn't well.

150
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,760
Using that excuse made me worried.

151
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,240
And letting the kids lie isn't good either.

152
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,390
Yes.

153
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,320
Yan,

154
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,350
right now, Hongfu is in turmoil,

155
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,160
and the stock transfer

156
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,240
affects your control.

157
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,590
Can I help?

158
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,560
As long as we marry soon,

159
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,830
the Tang family will help.

160
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,880
Thanks,

161
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,350
but marriage is about love.

162
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,470
I don't love you.

163
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,070
I've faced many

164
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,590
challenges before.

165
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,830
If I can't handle this,

166
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,000
I'd be weak.

167
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,030
What are you doing?

168
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,640
It's late,

169
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,200
so of course, going to sleep.

170
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,560
He Yuchen, Bu Yan is my fiancée.

171
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,600
You said it yourself,

172
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,240
fiancée means unmarried.

173
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,150
Once you're married,

174
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,560
you can act.

175
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,680
He Yuchen.

176
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,910
He Yuchen, what are you doing?

177
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,950
Let me down.

178
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,350
The kids are asleep.

179
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,910
What do you want?

180
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,320

(Why did you transfer the shares to me?)

200
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,680
(What were you about to say
before you passed out?)

201
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,630
Yuchen,

202
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,320
you stayed here

203
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,230
because you were worried about this old man.

204
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,750
I just don't get it.

205
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,440
He's your enemy.

206
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,360
For him,

207
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,630
you're putting up with
your wife's misunderstandings.

208
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:41,750
Is it worth it?

209
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,110
As for my dad,

210
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,470
we'll talk about it when Bu Honghui wakes up.

211
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,870
But now that he's suddenly in danger,

212
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,800
someone must have targeted him.

213
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,280
Until we know what they want,

214
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,280
we need to protect Bu Yan and the kids.

215
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,950
You've done so much.

216
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,160
And Bu Yan still
worries you might harm them.

217
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,440
This isn't the time to talk about that.

218
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,440
Pull yourself together.

219
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,800
Bu Honghui's in a coma.

220
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,120
It must be an accident

221
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,280
for the person who did this.

222
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,680
He's the only one who saw them,

223
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,030
so now, that person

224
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,950
must be worried Bu Honghui will wake up.

225
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,630
They'll come back

226
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,440
to make sure he never wakes up.

227
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,630
Stay alert, understood?

228
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,870
Got it.
