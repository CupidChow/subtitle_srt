00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,820
=Episode 13=

3
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,840
You... You're my brother-in-law.

4
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,670
We are family.

5
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,880
Hongfu's gone,
and my sister lost a lot too.

6
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,880
Family?

7
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,600
So you don't know who my sister is?

8
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:05,790
What do you mean?

9
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:11,350
Bu Yan,

10
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,150
her surname is Bu, and so is mine.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,150
Do you think it's a coincidence?

12
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,120
She is the eldest daughter
of the Bu Family.

13
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,350
She is my sister.

14
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,310
What, she didn't tell you?

15
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,120
Yes, it's me, Bu Yan.

16
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,510
How did you get this injury?

17
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,790
You rejected the invitation of Hongfu.

18
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:42,950
And now fake boxing champ,

19
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:43,870
you've shown up at my door?

20
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,120
You've got a record already.

21
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,100
Stop acting so high and mighty.

22
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,680
He said he won't fight fixed matches.

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,950
You've known about

24
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,480
Hongfu's power for years.

25
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,510
She is the eldest daughter of Hongfu.

26
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,840
And my sister.

27
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:09,080
Why do you insist on
sleeping with me?

28
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,080
The reason is

29
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,150
it has to be you.

30
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,400
Let go of me.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,840
Okay.

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,190
Stop refusing.

33
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,960
You have to fight this match.

34
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,520
And you can't win.

35
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,630
You must lose to Hongfu's fighter.

36
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,590
Beat him!

37
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,590
By the way,

38
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,240
there's something
I haven't told you.

39
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,280
My dear sister.

40
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,910
She's just a discarded member of Bu family.

41
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,120
She was already kicked out
of the house long ago.

42
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,240
If you dare to
fight me to the death,

43
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,430
my mother will never let her off,

44
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,910
or those two little brats.

45
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,190
You've seen

46
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,520
Hongfu's methods before.

47
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,770
What happened?

48
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,150
Be careful.

49
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,910
How did you end up like this?

50
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,270
You're burning up.

51
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,270
I made you some medicine.

52
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,430
Drink it now.

53
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,160

you said you wanted to talk with me.

80
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,390
Why did you start cooking for me?

81
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,640
Yuchen,

82
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,270
you asked me to take care of
Mrs. He last night,

83
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,630
and today you're here cooking.

84
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,190
What are you up to?

85
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,630
This money is from fighting.

86
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,800
I'm leaving my mom and Bu Yan in your care.

87
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,760
Wait,

88
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,920
what do you mean?

89
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,720
Tomorrow, I'm fighting Lei Zhenting.

90
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,950
With Lei Zhenting?

91
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,360
The same Lei Zhenting

92
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,240
who killed two people in the ring?

93
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,600
You're still injured,

94
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,160
and you've been out of
the ring for so long.

95
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,630
You trying to get yourself killed?

96
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:45,120
This way, Bu Yan won't be dragged down
because of me.

97
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,720
Is it really worth it?

98
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,240
Let's go.

99
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,100
Mom, where are we going?

100
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,720
Back to our home.

101
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,180
Let's go.

102
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,120
Let's go.

103
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,630
Ready.

104
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,240
Start.

105
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,750
Hit him! Kill him!

106
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,680
Beat that fake boxing champion!

107
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,630
Go, Lei Zhenting!

108
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,270
Beat that fake boxing champion!

109
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,270
Go for it.

110
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,740
Lei Zhenting!

111
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,070
Go for it!

112
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,360
Beat that fake boxing champion!

113
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,530
Take him down!

114
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,200
Go Lei Zhenting!

115
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,270
Come on, go for it!

116
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,960
Come on!

117
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,160
Oh my, Bu Yan!

118
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,590
Come and see quickly!

119
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:15,750
Hongfu Group is hosting
a boxing championship.

120
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,480
The fake boxing champion He Yuchen

121
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,060
(City Jiang News)
has been invited back to the ring

122
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,600
to face Hongfu's
star fighter, Lei Zhenting.

123
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,120
The Internet is buzzing about it.

124
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,480
After all, he's a former champion

125
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:27,240
who was banned for match-fixing.

126
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,560
There's a lot of controversy around him.

127
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,440
I heard if he loses this comeback match,

128
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,790
his career is over for good.

129
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,020
Do you think

130
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,750
He Yuchen has a chance of winning?

131
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,320
Feifei, I'm going out for a while.

132
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,550
Please take care of the kids.

133
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,120
Long time no see.

134
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,840
You used me to threaten He Yuchen,

135
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,680
didn't you?

136
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,840
Not bad.

137
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,670
You finally figured it out.

138
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,320
At least He Yuchen's suffering
wasn't for nothing.

139
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,200
What do you mean?

140
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,670
Make it clear.

141
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,510
No rush.

142
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,670
You'll find out in an hour.

143
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,750
Bu Jingyang, I know you hate me.

144
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,200
If you've got some dirty tricks,

145
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,630
just come at me directly.

146
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,480
He Yuchen is just
my contract husband.

147
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,390
Even if you kill him,

148
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,390
it wouldn't mean much to me.

149
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,720
Fake marriage, real feelings, huh?

150
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,670
It's truly touching.

151
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,670
However, he also told me the same thing.

152
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,550
Did you know,

153
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,600
to protect you,

154
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,390
he was ready to take us both down.

155
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,750
Even after finding out
you're the daughter of Hongfu,

156
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,000
he still signed a death contract with me

157
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,120
to fight in the ring.

158
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,000
In a little while,

159
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,550
he will be lying on the ground
like a dead dog.

160
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,350
Bu Yan,

161
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,630
whether it's a contract

162
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,080
or a legal relationship,

163
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,440
you are his weakness.

164
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,390
That's just the truth.

165
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,630
How interesting.

166
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,030
He Yuchen's weakness

167
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,630
is actually a daughter of Bu family.

168
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,750
How ridiculous.

169
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,080
What does it mean?

170
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,870
This is your fault.

171
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,510
He's willing to die for you,

172
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,000
yet you're acting

173
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,910
like a clueless fool.

174
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,240
He's about to be finished.

175
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,440
Once He Yuchen dies in the ring,

176
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,120
Hongfu will make a fortune off the hype.

177
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,720
It's a win-win.

178
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,510
You're too late.

179
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,440
The match has already started.

180
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,870
Go Lei Zhenting!

181
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:24,710
Go!

182
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:25,860
Go!

183
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,300
Come on!

184
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,390
- Are you crazy?
- Sorry.

185
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,530
- Yan.
- Watch where you're walking.

186
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,790
I saw your pregnancy test.

187
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,510
Congratulations, you're pregnant.

188
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
