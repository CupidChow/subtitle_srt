3
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,920
Are you fighting?

4
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,790
Dummy, this is kissing.

5
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,430
Mom will sleep with you.

6
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:28,990
Let's go.

7
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,240
You tightened your belt

8
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,630
to save that money?

9
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,240
None of your business.

10
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,870
Hello?

11
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,280
Ms. Bu,

12
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,750
Xiang just fainted from a fever.

13
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,910
We called an ambulance.

14
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:32,750
You better come quickly.

15
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,840
I'm on my way.

16
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,960
What happened?

17
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,430
My ID card.

18
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,630
Give me the ID card.

19
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:45,310
What happened?

20
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,800
My ID card, didn't you hear?

21
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,240
Need a ride? Where are you going?

22
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,080
No need.

23
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,820
(Pediatrics)

24
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:12,990
Feifei.

25
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,080
Don't worry.

26
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,680
The doctor is examining him.

27
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,360
Xiang will definitely be fine.

28
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,030
I shouldn't have been careless,

29
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,080
thinking he just

30
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,080
had a bite of barbecue.

31
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,840
Don't worry, Yan.

32
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,150
The doctor this time is Tang...

33
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,590
Tang Ze.

34
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,310
I just transferred here.

35
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,310
He's asleep.

36
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,360
How is he?

37
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,590
The test results are out.

38
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,400
Luckily, it hasn't reached
the critical phase.

39
00:03:59,150 --> 00:03:59,990
Feifei.

40
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,400
I want to talk to Yan alone.

41
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,710
I'll get you some water.

42
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,000
Chronic myeloid leukemia,

43
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,560
the best time for a bone marrow transplant

44
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,600
is within the first year
of the chronic phase.

45
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,830
You insisted on marrying
He Yuchen at this time

46
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,630
because

47
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,480
he is the child's biological father.

48
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,600
I knew you must have a reason.

49
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,480
But why didn't you tell me?

50
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,160
I am a doctor.

51
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,720
I believe the doctors

52
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,800
will do their best
to manage Xiang's illness

53
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,040
but the crucial bone marrow match

54
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,240
still depends on me.

55
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,870
I can also help you
find a bone marrow match

56
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,950
and help you get in touch

57
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,400
but you shouldn't marry a person like that.

58
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,510
I couldn't wait.

59
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,510
How can I watch you

60
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,750
be with someone like that?

61
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,830
It's my fault.

62
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,120
I should have stayed
to take care of you.

63
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,040
Take care of the kids.

64
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,680
I don't want to bring up the past.

65
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,830
If I hadn't left back then,

66
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,160
your life wouldn't have
turned out like this.

67
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,870
I am willing to
take care of you and the kids.

68
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,160
Would you

69
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,510
give me this chance?

70
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,240
(The kids?)

71
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,630
(So, the kids' father really is him.)

72
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,760
I've said it before,

73
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,000
all of this was my choice.

74
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,270
I chose it.

75
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,630
So no matter how the outcome turns out,

76
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,750
I have to accept it.

77
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,680
I believe

78
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,870
I can change my fate
by my own.

79
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,630
You are still the same as before

80
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,510
but I am not the same as before.

81
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,230
This time,

82
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,800
I won't let go.

83
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,480
Alright then, I'll go check
on Xiang first.

84
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,990
Maybe you want some time
to think about it.

85
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,920
(He can't find out about Xiang's illness.)

86
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,750
Why are you here?

87
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,480
Did you follow me?

88
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,830
Afraid I'd disturb you two, huh?

89
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,120
What did you hear?

90
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,600
What are you afraid I'd hear?

91
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,270
Afraid I'd come cause trouble for your ex?

92
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,680
He is the father?

93
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,310
(Thankfully, he didn't hear about
Xiang's condition.)

94
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,430
You're not denying it.

95
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,560
Then why didn't you tell me the truth

96
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,160
when I asked you before?

97
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,240
This is my privacy.

98
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,560
You don't need to know.

99
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,350
Right,

100
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,630
I don't need to know.

101
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,070
I just need to be a

102
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:40,000
clueless tool for these three months, huh?

103
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,920
Since there's a contract,

104
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:45,950
why did you bring him home

105
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,240
during the contract period?

106
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,950
You wanted him to see
how miserable you are,

107
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,040
and use me to
get back at him, didn't you?

108
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,870
He abandoned you and the kids.

109
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,720
You're still hung up on him.

110
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,270
So you're using me to
make him jealous, right?

111
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,800
He Yuchen, that's enough.

112
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,040
I don't have the patience
to deal with your craziness.

113
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,040
Just leave.

114
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,190
Don't go beyond the contract.

115
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,760
Fine.

116
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,310
Then let's stick to

117
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,480
what's within the contract.

118
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,760
What are you doing?

119
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:16,710
Let go.

120
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,720
He Yuchen, I'm warning you.

121
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,720
What are you doing? I'm warning you!

122
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,270
Warning me not to touch you?

123
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,390
Isn't that what's written in the contract?

124
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,510
He Yuchen, calm down.

125
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,720
If you keep this up, I will...

126
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,320
Are you crazy?

127
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,120
I'm crazy? Am I as crazy as you?

128
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,720
You spent ten million on a contract game,

129
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,480
just to spite your ex-boyfriend?

130
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,200
He Yuchen.

131
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,510
I remind you

132
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,960
this contract game is something
you signed for.

133
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,960
How to play it is my business.

134
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,790
I signed this because

135
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,320
at that time, I had no idea

136
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,550
there was a third person involved.

137
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,470
Bu Yan,

138
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,000
even if it's a fake marriage,

139
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,630
it's still between two people, right?

140
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,080
Fine.

141
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:33,200
Then I'll make it clear to you now,

142
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,960
there is no third person.

143
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,910
Can you let go of me now?

144
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,510
Can I go back to the hospital?

145
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,160
No.

146
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,840
You still want to go back to the hospital?

147
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,270
You still want to go back
to find him, right?

148
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,270
- I...
- Fine.

149
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,910
Don't you want to have a child?

150
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,480
I'll help you with that.

151
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,630
I'll help you make him jealous.
