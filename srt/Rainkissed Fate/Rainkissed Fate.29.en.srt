3
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:04,790
Mom was kicked out

4
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,230
to protect us.

5
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,400
If you were a single dad with two kids,

6
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,230
you'd understand.

7
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,230
You can only rely on yourself.

8
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,230
Who is the kids' father?

9
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:17,670
Why did you two

10
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,230
separate?

11
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,790
I'm fine.

12
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,360
Why are you crying?

13
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,360
Is something wrong with Xiang?

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,160
Where's Xiang?

15
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,760
Xiang.

16
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,950
He's fine.

17
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,200
Our son is fine.

18
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,320
You knew?

19
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,040
Honey.

20
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,200
Xiang just had the transplant surgery.

21
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,990
The doctor said it went well.

22
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:43,790
Honey.

23
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,790
Honey.

24
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,200
It's all okay now.

25
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,640
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,440
I didn't realize.

27
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,990
I didn't understand until now.

28
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,040
I'm sorry.

29
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:10,440
I didn't realize.

30
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,200
I'm sorry.

31
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,880
I'm sorry.

32
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,740
(Two months later)

33
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,160
Xiang.

34
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,520
Xiang,

35
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,550
if your dad were

36
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,790
as strong as Transformers,

37
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,440
able to protect you and Mom,

38
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,390
would you accept him?

39
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,790
Alright,

40
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,190
if he's really that strong

41
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,830
and can protect Mom,

42
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,790
I'll consider it.

43
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,830
Well.

44
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,640
Deal?

45
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:50,710
Dad,

46
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,560
the wind's too strong here.

47
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,120
You just recovered.

48
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,440
Maybe we should come another day.

49
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,950
I've already waited 20 years.

50
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,760
I can't wait anymore.

51
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:05,710
Mrs. He

52
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,200
I'm sorry.

53
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,390
When the factory restructured,

54
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,630
we faced financial trouble.

55
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,440
I had to lay off some people.

56
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,120
I didn't expect it to spark their hatred.

57
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,310
Changting sacrificed himself

58
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,560
to protect me.

59
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,200
I owe him my life.

60
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,910
That's why I must

61
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,510
find his son

62
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:30,200
and fulfill the promise between the two kids.

63
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:34,200
I'm trying to make up for what happened.

64
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,510
I should've apologized

65
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,800
20 years ago,

66
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:43,320
but I was severely injured and in a coma.

67
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,560
When I woke up,

68
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,710
you and Yuchen had already moved.

69
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,680
I searched everywhere

70
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,640
but couldn't find you.

71
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,270
That's why this apology

72
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,320
is 20 years late.

73
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,560
Bu Yan brought her dad to apologize.

74
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,720
If you don't want to accept it,

75
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,950
that's fine.

76
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,760
I'll have Bu Yan take him back.

77
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,200
It's this Bu Honghui

78
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,760
who wronged our family.

79
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:19,320
But how can I face Bu Yan?

80
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,800
Mom.

81
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,200
Grandma.

82
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:27,830
Grandma.

83
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,600
Open the door.

84
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,460
We miss you so much.

85
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,270
Grandma, we miss you so much.

86
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,200
Grandma.

87
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,980
Grandma.

88
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,150
Grandma.

89
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,030
- Open the door.
- I miss you.

90
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,680
Grandma.

91
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,000
We missed you.

92
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,840
Grandma.

93
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,800
Grandma.

94
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,440
Come here, my darlings.

95
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,560
Grandma missed you too.

96
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,000
Grandma.

97
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,950
I want your wonton noodles.

98
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,000
- What about you?
- Me too.

99
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,800
Alright.

100
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,560
Grandma will make it for you.

101
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,640
Mom.

102
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:11,390
Let your dad

103
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,760
have dinner together.

104
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,000
Let's go.

105
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:25,510
Dad,

106
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,320
let's eat together.

107
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,510
Do you remember

108
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,750
the first time we came here?

109
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,830
When?

110
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,270
Do you mean the time we signed the contract?

111
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,070
No, it's not.

112
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,950
No, earlier than that.

113
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,680
Before that…

114
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:01,440
You're with the bubbles...

115
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,030
Bu Yan.

116
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,880
Alright, just kidding.

117
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,560
It's you who said

118
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,350
all these random things.

119
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,310
Who knows what you mean?

120
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,510
I'm confessing my feelings for you.

121
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,750
But you're not taking the hint.

122
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,640
Wait a moment.

123
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:17,760
Confessing?

124
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,270
So you liked me that early.

125
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,120
You still remember

126
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:30,910
our first night?

127
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,920
Stop talking nonsense.

128
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,710
Don't think I don't remember

129
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,280
the first time I asked you

130
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,320
to sign the contract,

131
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,750
your awful attitude.

132
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,240
You slept with me

133
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,560
and then disappeared for six years.

134
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,150
Then you came back and threw money at me.

135
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,870
What attitude did you expect from me?

136
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,680
That was for the child.

137
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,080
Wait,

138
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,040
were you looking for me at that time?

139
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,030
Isn't it a bit shallow to fall for someone

140
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,350
just because of that?

141
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,440
You're that kind of person?

142
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,110
Your dad said

143
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,630
we've engaged since childhood.

144
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,320
You were my wife
since the very beginning.

145
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,320
I'm not shallow.

146
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,160
In the future,

147
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,680
don't take everything on yourself.

148
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:51,870
I want to help you.

149
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,680
You're so nice.

150
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,230
It's not because of the child, right?

151
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,680
It's because of you,

152
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,150
from the very beginning,

153
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,870
from that ridiculous beginning.

154
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:10,950
It's just because of you.

155
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,440
You said you love me.

156
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,040

we'll check it as soon as possible.

- Okay.

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,320
in your man?

206
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,110
Did you even listen to me?
