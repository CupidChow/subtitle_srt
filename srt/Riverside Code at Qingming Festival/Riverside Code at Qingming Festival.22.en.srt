196
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:00,320
You went into danger to help Su find her mother.

197
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,960
How are you irresponsible?

198
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:05,080
It's just that Mrs. Lan is more experienced with kids.

199
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,960
And it's good news that Mrs. Lan

200
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,080
wants to adopt Su.

201
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,730
You are still a child yourself.

202
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,610
Don't be too harsh on yourself.

203
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:16,240
Go back.

204
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,640
Wen Yue.

205
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,640
You're right.

206
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:23,110
Mrs. Lan is all by herself.

207
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,280
She won't be so lonely with Su around.

208
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,400
Besides, we live so close to each other.

209
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,840
Whenever Su misses us,

210
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,530
she can come over for fun.

211
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,960
And I believe

212
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,550
that a family doesn't have to be

213
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,550
bound by blood.

214
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,150
Wherever there is love, there is home.

215
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,000
Right?

216
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,670
You have really grown up.

217
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,350
Thank you, Wen Yue.

218
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,790
I used to feel sorry for myself.

219
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,200
I thought I was pitiful

220
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,230
because I had never seen my mother.

221
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,880
But later, I found out

222
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,610
that there are many poor people

223
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,380
in this world.

224
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,450
Just like Su

225
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,280
and Mr. He

226
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,440
who was locked up with me.

227
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,550
What about him?

228
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,000
He told me

229
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,150
that his father used to be a boat builder

230
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,400
by Taihu Lake.

231
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,550
One day, a villain broke into their home

232
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,840
and killed his parents.

233
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:19,280
And his older sister went missing.

234
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,670
His surname is He, right?

235
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,150
What else did he say?

236
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,670
He said

237
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,150
that his original surname

238
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,110
was Su, and not He.

239
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,550
Wait for me.

240
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,440
Come on.

241
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,180
Pass it.

242
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,150
Catch it.

243
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,350
Aren't you the sister who saved us?

244
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:02,000
Little girl, is Mr. He here?

245
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:04,910
He was here just now.

246
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,440
Should I take you to wait for him in his room?

247
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,550
Okay.

248
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,470
Here.

249
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,350
Sister.

250
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,230
This is Mr. He's room.

251
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,000
Please wait for him here.

252
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,230
I'll go back to playing.

253
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,520
Okay, thank you.

254
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,080
Lady Wen, be careful.

255
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,150
This Mahoraga figure has been broken once.

256
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,650
I glued it up.

257
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,110
This is yours?

258
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:23,880
Yeah.

259
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,030
My big sister made it for me.

260
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,590
She said that one was her

261
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,590
and the other

262
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,440
was me.

263
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,080
How did it

264
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,080
break?

265
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:41,670
Sorry.

266
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,740
I don't mean to pry.

267
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,280
I don't mind telling you.

268
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,030
It's just that it broke

269
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,670
when I lost my loved one.

270
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,110
One night when I was a child,

271
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,710
a villain broke into our house.

272
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,960
I saw him

273
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,670
killing my parents.

274
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,670
I rushed forward to bite him.

275
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,400
The Mahoraga figure

276
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,150
broke at that moment.

277
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,000
I was too young

278
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,880
to beat him.

279
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:39,000
He threw me to the side

280
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,030
and I passed out.

281
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:43,550
I woke up

282
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,150
only to learn from the authorities

283
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,500
that my sister had gone missing

284
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,790
and my parents

285
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:53,890
were dead.

286
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:02,520
Actually,

287
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,400
I also made a Mahoraga figure

288
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,280
for my brother when I was young.

289
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,110
It looked just like this one.

290
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:14,190
But I hadn't had time to color it.

291
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,400
My Mahoraga figure

292
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,830
wasn't colored, either.

293
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,640
I colored it myself.

294
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,680
Over the years,

295
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,920
whenever I see it,

296
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,800
I tell myself

297
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:36,590
that maybe

298
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,520
my big sister is still alive somewhere.

299
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,760
I came here today

300
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,160
because Ban told me

301
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,350
that you once lived at the Taihu Boatyard

302
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,000
with the surname "Su".

303
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,680
When I was young,

304
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:02,450
I also lived at the Taihu Boatyard

305
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,770
with the surname "Su".

306
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:22,960
Hurry up.

307
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,280
I was only unconscious.

308
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:29,240
But the murderer didn't check on me

309
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:30,940
before running away.

310
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,620
I wandered around for over a decade

311
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:36,970
and ended up in East Capital.

312
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,160
Headmistress Chi took me in

313
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,520
and put me to take care of these kids at the welfare center.

314
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,470
Whenever I look at

315
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,710
these poor kids,

316
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,760
I remember

317
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,310
how I picked thrown-away clothes

318
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,140
and begged for leftovers.

319
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,680
Headmistress Chi is gone.

320
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:05,880
I can't

321
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,610
let them grow up like me.

322
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,300
From now on,

323
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,250
Mo, Ban, and I

324
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:16,280
will come here often.

325
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:22,260
Yue.

326
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,180
Do you remember?

327
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,700
We had a river like this

328
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,070
outside our house.

329
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,830
Mother often took us to pick lotus pods

330
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,230
to make Lotus Fish.

331
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,640
I'd even ask for it in winter.

332
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:34,710
Then mother

333
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:37,560
would make lotus pods with flour.

334
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,590
And you helped her trick me.

335
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,460
Yue, what's wrong?

336
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:50,920
Nothing.

337
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,770
It's just a bit too abrupt.

338
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,720
You met Ban.

339
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:02,850
Then Ban told me about you.

340
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,250
Otherwise, we wouldn't have

341
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,480
recognized each other.

342
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,520
I bet our parents' spirits

343
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,280
led us to reunite.

344
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,210
Be careful.

345
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:28,580
How fancy.

346
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,440
What's going on? What's the fuss?

347
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:33,950
What's going on?

348
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,400
What a scene.

349
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,950
What are we celebrating?

350
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,760
What is Zhao Buyou doing?

351
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,760
Wen Yue. Shopkeeper of Wen's Umbrella Shop.

352
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,710
My wife.

353
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,500
I'm here to take you home.

354
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,070
[Wen's Umbrella Shop]
He's picking up his wife?

355
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,590
Buyou.

356
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:48,470
You don't

357
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:50,310
look like you're picking up your wife.

358
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,110
It's more like picking up a bride

359
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,430
at the wedding.

360
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:54,430
Am I right?

361
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,920
Yeah.

362
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,470
There she is.

363
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,350
I always treat my wife

364
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,680
as my bride.

365
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,710
Therefore,

366
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:08,950
every day is our wedding day.

367
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,950
- What are you talking about? - We wish you

368
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,880
a happy marriage.

369
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,760
May your love last forever.

370
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:18,950
Thank you.

371
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:19,760
All right!

372
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,800
Wen Yue.

373
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,640
Let's go home.

374
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,160
I haven't locked the door yet.

375
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,110
Wonderful.

376
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,020
Wonderful.

377
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,430
Come on.

378
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,950
Let's welcome Wen Yue home.

379
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,230
Wen Yue.

380
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:50,710
This is quite a fancy meal.

381
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:51,950
We each made a dish,

382
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,520
containing our name.

383
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,050
This one.

384
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,440
"Youdunzi" pancake.

385
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,350
"You"

386
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,520
as in Zhao Buyou.

387
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,160
I made this stir-fried duck

388
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,560
with "douban" sauce.

389
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,710
"Ban" as in Zhao Ban.

390
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,280
Wen Yue.

391
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,160
I made

392
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,070
this "Moyu" cuttlefish.

393
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:11,800
I haven't

394
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,280
done this for a long time.

395
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:16,470
I learned this

396
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,880
from an imperial chef.

397
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,000
It's called...

398
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,310
"Fengqili" pear.

399
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,760
"Li" as in Zhao Li.

400
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,000
Wen Yue, let me tell you

401
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,110
about this main dish.

402
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,190
This is

403
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:28,000
Rainbow Bridge over the Bright Moon.

404
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,880
We are here.

405
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,710
This is you.

406
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,000
All these dishes

407
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,070
constitute a feast

408
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,710
called "A Lifetime with You".

409
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,040
We'll stay by your side

410
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,430
forever.

411
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:43,470
Our family of five

412
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,560
finally reunited.

413
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,070
Let's drink

414
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,230
to it.

415
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,190
Cheers.

416
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:49,190
Cheers.

417
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:49,830
Cheers.

418
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,230
Come on, Father.

419
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,680
Now that you're back,

420
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,560
the whole family is here.

421
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,640
Since everyone is here,

422
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,310
I have something to say.

423
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,050
Who is it?

424
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:10,920
Come on in.

425
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,560
Mr. He?

426
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,310
What brings you here?

427
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,680
Excuse me.

428
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,590
I didn't see my sister

429
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,070
at the umbrella shop.

430
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,110
So I thought she should be here.

431
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:29,160
The authorities are closing us down.

432
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,680
I have nowhere to stay, so...

433
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,000
Did I come

434
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:35,590
at the wrong time?

435
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,000
Sister?

436
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:40,000
Who is your sister?

437
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,640
Yue.

438
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:47,070
Yue.

439
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,350
Me.

440
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,590
Why are you standing there?

441
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:54,850
Come on.

442
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,070
Sit down.

443
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,190
Let's talk.

444
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:05,920
Mo.

445
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,280
Zheng.

446
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,800
I'm keeping some things here.

447
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:10,800
That part is yours.

448
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,470
No need to bother.

449
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:13,830
I hate to see you

450
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,040
sleep at the dormitory

451
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,040
because of me.

452
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,230
I used to sleep on wooden boards

453
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:19,880
when I was a refugee.

454
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,190
I'm used to it.

455
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,070
Mo.

456
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:26,880
Don't go.

457
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,560
I'll sleep

458
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,200
on the floor or here.

459
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,890
But it's easier to go to work

460
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,110
from the dormitory.

461
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,710
I-If you want to sleep here,

462
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:41,110
I'll put these things away.

463
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,520
No need to bother.

464
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:43,520
I...

465
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:45,520
I...

466
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:48,920
Zheng,

467
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,640
feel at home.

468
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,430
I'm off.

469
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,440
Are you really leaving?

470
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,040
See you.

471
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,760
Wen Yue, take a look.

472
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,400
That one

473
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,350
and this one.

474
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,560
Which one makes me look more gallant?

475
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,520
You look gallant in both.

476
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,160
But neither of them looks good.

477
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:35,310
Wen Yue.

478
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,950
How come you're not so happy

479
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:38,520
about finding your brother?

480
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,230
Wear this one.

481
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,470
I like it better.

482
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,470
All right.

483
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,800
Nothing escapes your discerning eyes.

484
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:54,470
Don't you think

485
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,560
that everything has been going

486
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,520
too smoothly?

487
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,190
We obtained evidence

488
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,800
against the Zou family so easily

489
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:04,230
and found the orderer Chi Liaoliao.

490
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,520
I even

491
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,830
found my brother by chance.

492
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,880
- It's going way too smoothly. - It's going so well.

493
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,350
Well,

494
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:16,230
life has been too hard on you.

495
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:18,160
That's why you're paranoid.

496
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:21,470
The good days have come.

497
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,710
Have you ever heard of

498
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,520
the saying,

499
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,110
"Our day will come."

500
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,760
And our day has come.

501
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,430
I just don't

502
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,230
feel at ease.

503
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,230
I know.

504
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,760
I'll work harder

505
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,350
and make more money

506
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,350
to buy you a new house.

507
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,430
Then you'll be at ease.

508
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,160
Then why are you still here?

509
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,470
Go make money already.

510
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,190
I'll buy you a new house.

511
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:52,760
Okay.

512
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,710
Wen Yue.

513
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:58,710
I'll take Zheng to work.

514
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:02,160
Buy a new house.

515
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:03,040
Buy a new house.

516
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,110
Be careful.

517
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:25,560
I got this.

518
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,920
You usually carry this alone?

519
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,520
Yeah.

520
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,960
Jia.

521
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:34,470
This is my spot.

522
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,040
You know?

523
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,470
You haven't come for days.

524
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:37,190
I thought you quit.

525
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,560
Still, you can't take my spot.

526
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,560
Move.

527
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,430
Come on, young man.

528
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,350
Give me a hand.

529
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:42,730
Buyou, let me help him.

530
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:45,710
Let's go.

531
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:54,070
[Litigation]
The best in East Capital.

532
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,520
Buyou.

533
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:01,590
When you were at the Office of Justice,

534
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,070
have you heard of Dong Qian,

535
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:03,950
Judge Dong?

536
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,310
Why are you asking about him?

537
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,350
I borrowed this book from Mo some days ago.

538
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,160
It says

539
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,590
that Judge Dong is fair and just,

540
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,160
and good at solving cases.

541
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:24,950
I really admire him.

542
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:27,310
Buyou.

543
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,520
You know what?

544
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,470
Yue and I are from

545
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:30,400
the same place as him.

546
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,000
What a small world.

547
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,160
Yeah.

548
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,160
It is a small world.

549
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:37,640
Back then,

550
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,430
we lived at the Taihu Boatyard.

551
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,680
He was our county magistrate.

552
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,590
We saw him often.

553
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,950
It's a pity that I was young

554
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:48,470
and scared of the authorities.

555
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,190
If we had known

556
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,810
that he'd become such a great hero,

557
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,130
we would have made friends with him

558
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,040
to seek his protection.

559
00:28:58,830 --> 00:28:59,710
Then perhaps,

560
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:03,290
my parents wouldn't have been killed.

561
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,520
He was just a county magistrate

562
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,280
who had to listen

563
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,760
to his superiors.

564
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,520
He's not as amazing as you said.

565
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:13,800
Really?

566
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,470
But Mo also admires him very much.

567
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:24,800
Buyou.

568
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,470
Tell us more

569
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:27,640
about Judge Dong

570
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,160
when you have time.

571
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,680
I was just

572
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,800
an archive keeper

573
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,710
at the Office of Justice.

574
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,920
I didn't deal with

575
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,800
Judge Dong very much.

576
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,710
I'll ask around for you.

577
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,430
Didn't you say

578
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:48,230
you wanted to get something

579
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:49,640
from the morning market?

580
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,710
The merchants are here. Go take a look.

581
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:53,000
I'll look around.

582
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:53,830
Don't take too long.

583
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,110
Shiliu.

584
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,520
Shiliu.

585
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:12,590
Shiliu.

586
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,190
- Shiliu. - Duo.

587
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:18,110
Who are you looking for?

588
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,040
Sister.

589
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:21,190
The authorities said they'd send us

590
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,190
to a welfare house.

591
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,640
Shiliu doesn't want to go.

592
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,760
I can't find her now.

593
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:26,400
Don't panic.

594
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,280
Let me help you.

595
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,000
Okay.

596
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:28,880
Let's go.

597
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,830
Shiliu.

598
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,430
Shiliu.

599
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:34,640
Shiliu.

600
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,350
Shiliu.

601
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,800
Shiliu.

602
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:41,640
Shiliu.

603
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,310
What are you doing here?

604
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,400
Why are you hiding here?

605
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,470
Why are you hiding?

606
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,350
I don't want to go to the welfare house.

607
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,950
I miss Liaoliao.

608
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,190
That's why you're hiding here?

609
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,760
Is this Liaoliao's room?

610
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,830
Yes.

611
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,880
Does He Huan want us to go to the welfare house?

612
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:07,680
Yes.

613
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:11,640
If He Huan doesn't let you go,

614
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,880
you wouldn't go?

615
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,190
We all have to listen to him.

616
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,560
Mr. Shen.

617
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,310
Mr. Yang.

618
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,640
Liaoliao.

619
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:24,160
Chi Liaoliao also listened to him?

620
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,310
Liaoliao

621
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:27,280
listened to him the most.

622
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,430
He Huan

623
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:31,040
didn't like Liaoliao in colorful dresses

624
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:33,110
and she never wore those again.

625
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:36,040
He also made her have cakes made from milk

626
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,760
and wear hair ribbons he made.

627
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,620
But Liaoliao never liked them.

628
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:52,010
Let's go out and play.

629
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,230
Go ahead.

630
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,070
Speak.

631
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,430
Who are you?

632
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,710
Why are you after me?

633
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:55,190
I'm someone who lives in your shadow.

634
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,110
I'll never walk in the light

635
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:58,950
and I'm doomed to end miserably.

636
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,520
Live in my shadow?

637
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,000
What does that mean?

638
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,710
See?

639
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,440
Zheng didn't just help out at the litigation booth.

640
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,840
He also bought me

641
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,640
the belt I'd been longing

642
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,940
for years.

643
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,920
Thank you.

644
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,760
Black accessories suit you the best.

645
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:10,040
Buyou.

646
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,190
How do you like my new outfit?

647
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,040
Sorry.

648
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:14,810
I can't see it.

649
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:16,430
All I can see is my belt.

650
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:17,870
Ban.

651
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:18,910
A young lady

652
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,950
of your age should wear bright colors.

653
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,560
You look good.

654
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,280
Say thank you.

655
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,470
Thank you, Zheng.

656
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,280
Wen Yue.

657
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,360
- Look. - Yue.

658
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,470
Zheng gave me this belt.

659
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:29,840
Looks good, huh?

660
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:30,670
Wen Yue.

661
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:31,560
Wen Yue, look.

662
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,360
How do I look in yellow?

663
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,600
Zheng bought it for me.

664
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,190
What do you think?

665
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,280
- Your outfit... - Looks good.

666
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,360
Not bad.

667
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,280
Let me see.

668
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,230
Look.

669
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:44,560
He's showing off to others.

670
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,500
Yue, what's wrong?

671
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,670
Zheng.

672
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:49,860
I know

673
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,250
life hasn't been easy for you these years.

674
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,870
Now you're finally home.

675
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,930
I get it that you want to bond with them.

676
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:58,760
Of course.

677
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,710
I've come here and caused them trouble.

678
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:02,710
Naturally,

679
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:03,710
I must offer something.

680
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:05,870
After all,

681
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:07,600
others wouldn't like me

682
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:10,800
as much as you do.

683
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,520
I bet people in the welfare center

684
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:18,430
like you very much too.

685
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:23,760
Of course.

686
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:25,760
Yeah?

687
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:31,020
[Suburb of East Capital]

688
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:34,560
Mr. Zou.

689
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,230
What is this for?

690
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:37,870
You are in charge

691
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,080
of the Ministry of Justice.

692
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,800
[Zou Mian, Manufacturing Bureau]
Please do me a favor.

693
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:59,290
I have served the court all my life.

694
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:03,230
My youngest daughter Ziyin

695
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:05,360
matters more than anything to me.

696
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:08,040
I really can't bear to watch her

697
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,280
framed by villains

698
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,870
and suffer in jail

699
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:14,080
due to wrongful conviction.

700
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,390
Mr. Liu.

701
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:17,870
Please show mercy.

702
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,150
This case

703
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:24,950
has reached His Majesty.

704
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,260
No one in East Capital

705
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,420
dares to meddle with this mess.

706
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,000
Mr. Liu.

707
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,970
Do you recognize this yellow silk cloth?

708
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,840
His Majesty once

709
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:42,000
held my master's arm.

710
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,230
After that,

711
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,150
my master

712
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:46,600
always kept this yellow silk cloth on his arm

713
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,630
and he's never bowed

714
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,870
to anyone ever since.

715
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,560
But today,

716
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:52,080
my master bowed to you formally.

717
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:55,230
It was like His Majesty was here.

718
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:56,190
How is it

719
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,390
a "mess"?

720
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:07,080
Forgive me.

721
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:08,080
There's nothing I can do.

722
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:09,190
Mr. Zou, please

723
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,190
seek help somewhere else.

724
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:30,150
Nothing went wrong at home, right?

725
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:31,840
All staff on board

726
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,800
have signed irredeemable contracts.

727
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:35,390
We also paid off

728
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:36,600
everyone we've come across.

729
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,230
Please rest assured.

730
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:39,520
Your secret visit here

731
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,230
is highly confidential.

732
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:43,560
No one will know about it.

733
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,280
Still, a long night is fraught with dreams.

734
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:49,430
I came in person

735
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,560
to get Ziyin out of trouble.

736
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:55,630
No matter how much it costs,

737
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:57,080
I must get her out.

738
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:00,670
Go work on it.

739
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:18,560
Father.

740
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,000
Have some tea.

741
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:22,230
Okay.

742
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,150
Where is Zheng?

743
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,710
Where did that brat go again?

744
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,800
He's probably playing somewhere.

745
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,520
Father.

746
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,390
Mother.

747
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:40,710
What happened?

748
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:42,910
How did you get hurt?

749
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,040
It was Goudan's fault.

750
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,470
He bought a new Mahoraga figure.

751
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,360
He was being petty

752
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:49,950
and wouldn't let me play.

753
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,910
Then...

754
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,000
Then you fought?

755
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,280
No.

756
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,670
I got mad and ran away.

757
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,600
Then I fell on the way home.

758
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:01,040
You fell?

759
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,470
He fell?

760
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,040
Go wash up.

761
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:05,950
Go ahead.

762
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:06,600
Come on.

763
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:07,760
It's fine.

764
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:09,600
- Silly kid. - It's just a figure.

765
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,000
I will make one for you.

766
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:11,800
Really?

767
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:15,000
If you make a Mahoraga figure for me,

768
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,630
I swear I will keep it safe

769
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,120
and take it wherever I go.

770
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:18,650
Okay.

771
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,130

The devoted viewers must have noticed

825
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,470
that making an oil paper umbrella

826
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,430
is a delicate matter.

827
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,280
It's divided into five steps.

828

Paper is cut and glued onto the skeleton.

836
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:40,870
It is trimmed, shaped, and exposed to sunlight.
