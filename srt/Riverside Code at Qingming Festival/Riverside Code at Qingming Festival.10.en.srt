People from all over the world gather here,

12
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,380
and envoys from various countries come to communicate with the authorities.

What's going on?

19
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:42,120
I caught the Hat Demon!

20
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:43,910
How did you catch it?

21
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,760
Look, it... it's coming over!

22
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,000
It stopped moving.

23
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,120
Why did it stop moving?

24
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,040
Why isn't it moving?

25
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:06,800
It's completely still.

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,800
There's blood on it.

30
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,520
I'm not sure if it's human or animal blood.

31
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,720
It smells awful.

32
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:30,600
Mo,

33
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,750
do you know

34
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,800
how the Hat Demon can fly?

35
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,800
There's gunpowder inside.

36
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,960
It's said that during the reign of the founding emperor,

37
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,160
a military officer once added gunpowder

38
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,320
to crossbow arrows.

39
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,080
It made the arrows fly faster.

40
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,270
I didn't expect you

41
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,030
to be not only handsome

42
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,030
but also so knowledgeable.

43
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,080
Thank you for the compliment, Lady Zhang.

44
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,880
My brother has been diligent since childhood.

45
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,520
He's still young.

00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,440
I believe

48
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,320
that I'll catch the culprit soon.

49
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,360
Perhaps, Lady Zhang, you should return home

50
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,720
and wait for my news.

51
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,390
Going back is too boring.

52
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,160
Your whole family is delightful.

53
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,270
So interesting.

54
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,110
You're just my kind of people.

55
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,910
It's just a pity

56
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:25,960
that our house

57
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,440
is too small

58
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,960
to accommodate such an esteemed guest like you.

59
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,520
It's fine.

60
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,080
I'll just squeeze in with you two.

61
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:36,270
I replaced the bed in your room

62
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:37,550
with a new one.

63
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,240
You don't mind, do you?

64
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,470
No...

65
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,000
Lady Zhang, if you're really

66
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,600
so casual about it,

67
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,160
come inside with me.

68
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,000
Sure.

69
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,720
Zhao Buyou,

70
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,470
come in.

71
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,600
Shall I come in?

72
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,670
The space is a bit small,

73
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,510
but make yourselves comfortable.

74
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,160
Where is the original furniture in this room?

75
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,830
I had the servants

76
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:27,440
move all that old junk to the back gate.

77
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:31,950
Wen Yue.

78
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:32,670
You stay here.

79
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,320
Buyou, your wife is really strict with you.

80
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,700
Yue always has the final say with you.

81
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,940
I'm so envious.

82
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,670
Lady Zhang,

83
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,670
please stay out of our private matters.

84
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:47,720
Don't meddle in our affairs,

85
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,110
all right?

86
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,000
Once Yue comes back,

87
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,550
let's have a proper chat:

88
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:52,950
how are

89
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,070
the three of us supposed to sleep on it tonight?

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,790
Come on,

91
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,390
maybe the two of us shall squeeze in first.

92
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,680
You...

93
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,060
You've got some nerve.

94
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,720
Someone hired me to kill you.

95
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,070
This is the bounty.

96
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,760
The deadline is in two days.

97
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,920
Just as I suspected.

98
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,440
How much did he offer you?

99
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,760
I'll pay you ten times that.

100
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,440
I never planned

101
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,550
to take this money.

102
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,950
Then what do you want?

103
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,790
I want to find out who sent the order.

104
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,950
That person must be connected to the Hat Demon case.

105
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,110
Plenty of people want me dead.

106
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,720
How will you find them?

107
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,720
Do you have a lead?

108
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,790
No.

109
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,200
But I've made up my mind.

110
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,200
I'll be your bodyguard.

111
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,000
That won't do.

112
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,270
Don't interrupt.

113
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,320
They sent you to kill me,

114
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,230
but you're here to protect me instead?

115
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,390
Like I said,

116
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,000
I only want to find the person who sent the order.

117
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,830
So,

118
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,760
you want to use me as bait.

119
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,790
What if you suddenly change your mind

120
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,000
and decide to kill me while you're close?

121
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,790
Wouldn't that be even easier?

122
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,230
My wife isn't that kind of person.

123
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,510
Quiet.

124
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,830
I already said I don't want the money.

125
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,040
Lady Zhang,

126
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:23,880
sometimes,

127
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,640
a woman's promise

128
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,110
is more reliable than a man's.

129
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,720
Don't you think?

130
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,440
What about the Hat Demon case?

131
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,640
My husband will continue investigating.

132
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,440
He'll catch the culprit.

133
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,110
You two split the work, one inside, one outside.

134
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,160
Seems like I have no better option.

135
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:54,790
Besides,

136
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,320
if I keep you around,

137
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,270
Buyou

138
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,950
will surely put in the effort.

139
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,440
So we're even.

140
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,550
I use you as bait,

141
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,950
and you use me as leverage.

142
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,550
Deal?

143
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,000
Deal.

144
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:10,880
Did you hear that clearly?

145
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:12,920
I heard it clearly.

146
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,040
Deal.

147
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,160
Well then,

148
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,160
it's getting late...

149
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,040
I'm tired.

150
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,720
I'll sleep here tonight.

151
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,110
How are the three of us supposed to sleep on it?

152
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,670
This bed is so small.

153
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:25,720
How can it fit three people?

154
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,040
Yue, are you still awake?

155
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,480
I knew you weren't asleep.

156
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,600
Tell me,

157
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,670
as a woman like you,

158
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,450
married into this kind of family,

159
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,510
how do you live like this?

160
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,200
I live just fine.

161
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,180
Whether a woman is happy or not isn't about what she says.

162
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,000
It's like they say:

163
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,200
you alone know if the water you drink

164
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:08,950
is warm or cold...

165
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:37,540
Dry weather, be careful with fire!

166
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,800
Dry weather, be careful with fire!

167
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,470
It's not even dawn yet,

168
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,440
and you're already up cooking?

169
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,400
My wife is going out today,

170
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,200
so I wanted to make her something nice.

171
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,400
Aren't there servants here?

172
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,080
Let them do it.

173
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,590
Why bother doing it yourself?

174
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,550
My wife cooks for me every day.

175
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,150
This water is so cold.

176
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,280
No wonder your wife's hands

177
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,470
are so rough.

178
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,550
My wife's hands

179
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,520
used to be beautiful too.

180
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,470
But after marrying me,

181
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:36,440
with my younger siblings still small

182
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,960
and me being useless,

183
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,320
she worked day and night in the umbrella shop

184
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,150
just to help make ends meet.

185
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,840
The bamboo needles

186
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,320
pierced her hands over and over.

187
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,400
Then my father's health got worse,

188
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,440
and his mind grew weaker.

189
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,000
My wife

190
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,150
even had to wash his clothes.

191
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,150
In the winter,

192
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,550
the water was freezing cold.

193
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,550
She wouldn't spend money on hand balm,

194
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,400
taking on all the dirty and heavy work herself.

195
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,960
So what if her hands are rough?

196
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,030
Even if they are,

197
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,960
I still love holding them.

198
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,840
I want to hold her hands for a lifetime.

199
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:57,640
I once did all these things for someone too.

200
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,150
But in the end,

201
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,850
he sold me out.

202
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,840
I haven't slept this well in a long time.

203
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,520
Buyou,

204
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,760
I'll take Yue with me now.

205
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,960
Wen Yue,

206
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,000
be careful with everything.

207
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,280
Don't worry.

208
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,470
You two,

209
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,640
listen to your elder brother

210
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,710
and take good care of father.

211
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,080
Do you two have time?

212
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,670
No.

213
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,080
I want you to help me

214
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,520
with the Hat Demon case.

215
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:02,670
Sure!

216
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,140
[Day Four after Taking the Task]

217
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,110
I'm not someone you can just arrest at will.

218
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:09,640
Inspector Gu,

219
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,960
what's so urgent that you need me?

220
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,880
Hurry and find the key!

221
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,670
Before Kang Qian died,

222
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,550
someone was drinking with him.

223
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,520
That person

224
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,410
has been brought back.

225
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,090
Quickly!

226
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:19,710
Who is it?

227
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:20,540
Let me go!

228
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,840
Commander Tao, who locked you in here?

229
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:24,880
Hurry up!

230
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,150
Find the key!

231
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,080
I'm looking.

232
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,640
Commander Tao,

233
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,550
who locked you in here?

234
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,550
If I find that brat,

235
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,080
I'll send him to your house

236
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,030
so you can interrogate him yourself.

237
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,320
- Find the key! - I'm looking for the key.

238
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,710
Where could the key have gone?

239
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,550
Stop talking and search!

240
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,550
- I'm on it. - I won't let you off so easily!

241
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,200
Boss.

242
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,350
Your Excellency!

243
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,110
What's going on?

244
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,550
What are you doing here?

245
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,350
Mr. Zhao.

246
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,440
Inspector Gu.

247
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,590
They're treating me like a criminal.

248
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,670
You've had a hard time.

249
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,320
- Please sit down. - They're treating me like a criminal.

250
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:56,480
What kind of nobleman am I now?

251
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,030
We at Kaifeng Court are just doing our job.

252
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,590
I never expected

253
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:00,910
they'd bring you in.

254
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:01,280
Oh...

255
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,200
- Hurry up! - What's the meaning of this?

256
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,230
Find the key quickly

257
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:03,880
and bring it here!

258
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,880
- Got it! - The key is on its way.

259
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,030
The key isn't here yet.

260
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,350
Please sit for a moment.

261
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,640
Let's have a chat.

262
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,790
It's all because of that wretched Kang Qian.

263
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,030
Ever since he died,

264
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,440
I've been scared out of my wits.

265
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,790
Kang Qian was drinking with you,

266
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,880
so how did he...

267
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,960
how did he suddenly die?

268
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,760
Inspector Gu,

269
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,790
Commander Tao is one of us.

270
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,000
The way you're asking

271
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,230
makes it sound like he's a suspect.

272
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,320
I...

273
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,230
I didn't mean that.

274
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:33,440
How could I have killed Kang Qian?

275
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,400
The two of us

276
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,440
were just having a drink.

277
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,440
Still drinking?

278
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,350
You'll ruin your health with that habit!

279
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:43,030
I... I only have this one little vice.

280
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,440
Your vice

281
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,670
is far from little.

282
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:49,200
Mr. Zhao, you understand me best.

283
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,520
Mr. Gu is one of us.

284
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:52,590
He won't make this hard for you.

285
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,710
Just tell us what you know.

286
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,230
Once we're done, it's just routine,

287
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,200
and you'll be free to go. Sound good?

288
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:58,760
Really?

289
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:05,080
Kang Qian and I have known each other for years.

290
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,230
Usually,

291
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,840
he holds his liquor pretty well.

292
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,520
But this time,

293
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,840
he had just a little to drink

294
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,320
and started feeling sick.

295
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,400
In a hurry,

296
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,000
he ran straight to the bathroom.

297
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,110
You all know what happened after that.

298
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,400
It was absolutely terrifying.

299
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,440
Did Kang Qian

300
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,640
have any enemies?

301
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:26,790
What do you think?

302
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,790
With all the things he and Zhang Qiniang did,

303
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,910
how could he not?

304
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,400
What exactly did Zhang Qiniang do?

305
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,280
Speak up.

306
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,710
In East Capital,

307
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,350
she bought and sold land and properties

308
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,520
using some despicable tricks.

309
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,520
The Hat Demon

310
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,590
was entirely

311
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:47,670
Kang Qian's creation to scare people!

312
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,030
Tell me more about it.

313
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,350
This all started

314
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,470
five years ago.

315
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,790
Back then, rumors of the Hat Demon

316
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:56,960
spread like wildfire

317
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,000
throughout the capital.

318
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:02,150
Naturally, our Imperial Guards kept an eye on it.

319
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,200
That Hat Demon

320
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,440
didn't cause chaos anywhere else.

321
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,400
It only caused a fuss around Yanglou Street.

322
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,960
Because of it, property values

323
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,760
on the entire street dropped.

324
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:13,320
Then

325
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:15,110
Zhang Qiniang showed up.

326
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,650
In one swoop,

327
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,470
she bought up most of the street.

328
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:19,650
Not long after that,

329
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:21,470
there was news

330
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:22,630
- that they'd build - Write down everything he said.

331
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,440
a garden for some noble on this street.

332
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,590
And what happened?

333
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,070
The Hat Demon suddenly disappeared.

334
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,510
Property prices

335
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,590
skyrocketed overnight.

336
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,270
Buying low, selling high,

337
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,880
how much do you think the Zhangs made?

338
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,880
What a scheme!

339
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,440
So what you're saying is

340
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,200
there was never a Hat Demon case.

341
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,070
They spread the rumors themselves

342
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:45,270
to scare the commoners,

343
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,440
drive down the prices,

344
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,630
and then profit by flipping the land.

345
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,560
Since you knew,

346
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,590
why didn't the Imperial Guards stop it?

347
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,630
Stop it?

348
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,830
How could we?

349
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:55,680
Do you know who backs Zhang Qiniang?

350
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,950
That person

351
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,830
could move mountains!

352
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,200
Who could dare interfere?

353
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,120
To think that a rumor

354
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,830
from five years ago

355
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:09,150
has turned into reality today.

356
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,270
And now,

357
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,830
Kang Qian actually died at the hands of the Hat Demon.

358
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,800
I guess that's karma.

359
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,710
These people

360
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:19,920
are really monsters!

361
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,630
- Inspector Gu, Zhao Buyou! - What happened five years ago

362
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:23,420
and what's happening now

363
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,800
- Let me go! - must be connected.

364
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,120
Let's head to Kang Qian's house now.

365
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,470
But Kang Qian just died,

366
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,880
and only his wife remains at home.

367
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,630
It's not appropriate for two men to go.

368
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,240
Let's bring Zhao Ban with us.

369
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,630
All right.

370
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,560
I... I didn't kill anyone.

371
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,070
Yes.

372
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,000
Of course not.

373
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,150
Your Excellency!

374
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,800
Did you find the key?

375
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,360
We found it.

376
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:42,710
Quickly!

377
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,360
Let me out of here!

378
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,510
We have a key,

379
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,270
but it's in the prison.

380
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,590
We can't get it.

381
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,510
Come on! Carry Commander Tao into the cell!

382
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,150
- I... - Yes, sir!

383
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:49,950
I...

384
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:50,830
I'm not going into the cell!

385
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,200
I... I won't go!

386
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,000
- Don't worry... - I won't go into the cell!

387
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,360
- We'll free you there. - I won't go in there!

388
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,560
- You'll be free there! - I won't go!

389
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,220
[Memorial Tablet of the Late Husband, Kang Qian]

390
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:03,180
[Chun Xi, Kang Qian's Wife]

391
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,720
Mrs. Kang,

392
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,990
may I ask where you were when your husband

393
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,350
had his accident yesterday?

394
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,870
I was at home.

395
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,350
My late husband valued propriety.

396
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,350
I rarely leave the house.

397
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,110
Did someone inform you?

398
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,680
Last night,

399
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,750
someone suddenly ran in and told me

400
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,840
that my husband had an accident.

401
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,750
He was just going out to drink,

402
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,150
but I never expected the Hat Demon...

403
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:43,870
Officers,

404
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,630
my husband died such an unjust death.

405
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:49,150
Please, sirs, seek justice for him.

406
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,960
Mrs. Kang,

407
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,320
please get up.

408
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,110
Ban.

409
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:59,200
I'll help you up.

410
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:00,270
What's wrong?

411
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,350
It's nothing.

412
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:21,560
Mrs. Kang,

413
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,480
would you mind if we looked around the house?

414
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,510
So many powders and cosmetics here.

415
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,430
Mrs. Kang,

416
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,560
may I take a look at these?

417
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,760
This is a new kind of facial balm.

418
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:21,160
Yours is much better than mine.

419
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,430
These things aren't mine.

420
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,000
They belonged to my late husband.

421
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:31,710
Ban.

422
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,880
This is the first time I've seen

423
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,560
such a large bronze mirror in someone's home.

424
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,280
This bronze mirror

425
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,470
was also custom-made by my husband.

426
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,680
It seems that Kang Qian, in life,

427
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:50,000
paid a lot of attention to his appearance.

428
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,760
My late husband worked for the Zhangs.

429
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
The Zhang household has a rule:

430
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,470
everyone in the manor

431
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,800
had to appear pleasing

432
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,680
to Zhang Qiniang.

433
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,430
Otherwise, they would be punished.

434
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,880
Over time,

435
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,230
my husband became obsessed with his appearance.

436
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,000
Whether he was going to the Zhangs' estate,

437
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,520
meeting guests, or going out,

438
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:07,230
he would dress himself up carefully.

439
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,590
I see.

440
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,190
What about the room over there?

441
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,350
What is it used for?

442
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,830
It's the bathing room.

443
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,310
This is...

444
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,160
Fourfold Noble Incense.

445
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:53,880
Mrs. Kang,

446
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,830
we won't trouble you any further.

447
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,070
Buyou!

448
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,280
Dear guests,

449
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,160
I rarely leave the house,

450
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,590
so I won't see you off too far.

451
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,430
Please stop here, Mrs. Kang.

452
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,240
Buyou, I'm heading back.

453
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:40,920
All right.

454
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,310
Inspector Gu,

455
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,680
I'll head to the autopsy room now.

456
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:44,560
Ban,

457
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,520
if you discover anything,

458
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:49,190
have Yao He report to me immediately.

459
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:50,000
Got it.

460
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,350
Don't eat anything in the autopsy room!

461
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,310
If Ban

462
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,400
gets promoted,

463
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,070
will she report to you directly?

464
00:21:58,710 --> 00:21:59,280
Yes.

465
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,430
How much is the monthly salary?

466
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,470
Aren't you asking a bit too much?

467
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,950
What are you looking at?

468
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,110
Someone is watching us.

469
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,350
Let's go have some tea.

470
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,590
Madam,

471
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,920
do you have good tea?

472
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,520
Ah, two esteemed officers!

473
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,590
Please sit.

474
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:31,310
Yes,

475
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,310
we have fine tea.

476
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:33,640
Madam,

477
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,110
do you know the Kang family?

478
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:38,590
Of course I do.

479
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,710
We're all neighbors.

480
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,070
Does Mrs. Kang of the Kang family

481
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,160
rarely ever leave the house?

482
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,710
Yes.

483
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:45,920
Mr. Kang

484
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,920
was working in a wealthy household.

485
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,430
He was always so polite.

486
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,190
His wife, Mrs. Kang, too,

487
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,520
whenever she stepped out,

488
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,070
she always covered her face with a fan,

489
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,680
so dignified.

490
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,000
Such a pity.

491
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,310
It truly is.

492
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,470
Madam,

493
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:06,040
are you burning incense here?

494
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,000
Yes,

495
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,520
it's lit inside.

496
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,430
This incense smells nice.

497
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,880
And the burner is exquisite.

498
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,230
Is this incense

499
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,700
the Fourfold Noble Incense?

500
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,400
Yes,

501
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,430
how do you know that?

502
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,880
This is...

503
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,350
Fourfold Noble Incense.

504
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,470
That's the same incense as the one at Kang's house.

505
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,800
This incense isn't cheap.

506
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,160
A single tael of Fourfold Noble Incense

507
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,280
costs more

508
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,950
than your tea stall earns in a month.

509
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,160
That expensive?

510
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:37,760
Where did you get it?

511
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,280
Officers,

512
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,590
don't misunderstand.

513
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,640
It was given to me by Mr. Kang.

514
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,190
Why would he give you incense?

515
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:47,470
He didn't just give it to me.

516
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:48,830
Mr. Kang

517
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:49,640
was a generous man.

518
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,880
He often gave us neighbors

519
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,830
fancy food

520
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:53,950
and new trinkets.

521
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,520
The Kang Qian we knew

522
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,230
wasn't so generous.

523
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:59,040
Did he ask you for any favors?

524
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,400
His wife is beautiful

525
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:03,590
and often home alone.

526
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,310
Mr. Kang

527
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,560
was afraid the street thugs

528
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,590
would disturb her.

529
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,070
Anyone visiting his house

530
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:13,520
was watched closely by us.

531
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,950
So were there often strangers

532
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,160
visiting the Kang household?

533
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,350
No!

534
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:19,640
Mrs. Kang

535
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,000
always hired a few

536
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,830
regular errand boys

537
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,560
for her shopping.

538
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,880
She's very proper.

539
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,680
However,

540
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,110
just earlier,

541
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,560
I saw three strangers,

542
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,470
two men and a woman,

543
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,760
go inside.

544
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,920
That was us.

545
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:38,600
You'd better keep a close eye on things.

546
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:41,930
Now then,

547
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,110
let me serve you some tea.

548
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,400
- All right. - I'll bring you the finest tea.

549
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,590
She's hiding something.

550
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,000
Which "she" are you talking about?

551
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,230
I'm talking about...

552
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,760
Mrs. Kang.

553
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,160
Exactly.

554
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,710
I meant Mrs. Kang too.

555
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,000
Why do you think she's hiding something?

556
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,000
Just a feeling.

557
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:06,880
What about you?

558
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,000
Just now,

559
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,830
there was a burn mark on her arm.

560
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:12,730
Did you notice?

561
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:16,540
It was caused by a branding iron.

562
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:18,330
When Ban helped her up,

563
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:19,830
her upper arm, back...

564
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:21,400
her whole body was in pain.

565
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:23,710
This proves that the branding iron burns

566
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:24,880
are not just that one.

567
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,110
Who do you think

568
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,430
would use a branding iron

569
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,950
to burn a woman like that?

570
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,560
If the shopkeeper was right,

571
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,310
and Kang Qian

572
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:41,350
was very particular about his wife's going out,

573
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,430
then it could only be him.

574
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,310
Exactly.

575
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,760
Anyone who works for Zhang Qiniang

576
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,710
is bound to have issues of their own.

577
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,110
Judging by these burn marks,

578
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,950
Kang Qian abusing his wife

579
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,950
is undeniable.

580
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,110
That being the case,

581
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:07,190
Mrs. Kang now has a motive for murder.

582
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,760
However,

583
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,160
the Hat Demon case

584
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,560
couldn't have been planned by her alone.

585
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,400
That's right.

586
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,760
Here's what we'll do.

587
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,110
Send someone immediately

588
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:24,470
to keep an eye on Chun Xi day and night.

589
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,580
Watch who she associates with.

590
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,160
How do you know

591
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:40,700
I don't already have people

592
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,200
watching her?

593
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,430
The tea is here!

594
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:46,110
Here, sirs,

595
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,470
please enjoy.

596
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,230
This is Seven-Treasure Tea.

597
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,560
Seven-Treasure?

598
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:55,760
Good tea!

599
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,160
It's definitely poison.

600
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,470
Can you identify what kind?

601
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,230
I examined

602
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,160
the food, drink, and dishes

603
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,590
last used by Kang Qian and Commander Tao.

604
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:35,430
None of it was poisoned.

605
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:36,430
No poison?

606
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,350
Then how was the poison administered?

607
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,430
What is it?

608
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,920
Lip rouge.

609
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,190
It's definitely lip rouge.

610
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,760
Lip rouge?

611
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:17,830
So many powders and cosmetics here.

612
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:28,680
Kang Qian's dressing table had everything.

613
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,280
But there was no lip rouge.

614
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:32,710
Yet he had lip rouge on his lips.

615
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,590
This means...

616
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:34,830
It means someone deliberately

617
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,560
took the lip rouge from his table.

618
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,040
The lip rouge was poisoned.

619
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:40,920
I've figured it out.

620
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,950
Before Kang Qian entered the restaurant,

621
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,680
his lips were already painted with lip rouge.

622
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,110
But as long as he didn't eat or drink,

623
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:49,160
the poison wouldn't enter his body.

624
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,280
When he drank wine,

625
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,040
the poison from the lip rouge mixed with the wine,

626
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:55,230
entered his mouth,

627
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,310
and triggered the poisoning.

628
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,190
And the poisoned lip rouge

629
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,070
was hidden afterward.

630
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,350
Whoever managed all this

631
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,560
could only be...

632
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,710
Upon further investigation,

633
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,310
these three errand boys

634
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,280
regularly do shopping for Chun Xi.

635
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,070
Aside from them,

636
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,430
Chun Xi rarely goes out

637
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:18,000
or interacts with anyone else.

638
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,000
Speak up.

639
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:22,190
What are your names, and how old are you?

640
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:28,280
Answer!

641
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,350
I'm Zhang Siwu.

642
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:32,800
I just turned 14 last month.

643
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,640
I'm Yan Shun,

644
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,040
also 14.

645
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,190
I'm Chen Xiaoyi.

646
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:40,160
I'm 15 this year.

647
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,230
I have checked the household registry.

648
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,830
They're all classified as child laborers.

649
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,800
The first two are residential workers,

650
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,350
and the last one, Chen Xiaoyi,

651
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,430
is a transient worker.

652
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,430
Recently,

653
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,230
what have you bought for the Kang family,

654
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:53,830
and when did you buy it?

655
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:59,190
Speak!

656
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,520
Speak up!

657
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,850
- I... - I what? Just say it!

658
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:02,710
Just tell the officer

659
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,040
what you told me!

660
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:05,680
He won't eat you!

661
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:07,950
Boss,

662
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:08,830
they're terrified

663
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:10,560
because they heard this incident

664
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,920
is related to the Hat Demon case.

665
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,560
They're scared out of their wits.

666
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,520
Being able to state their names

667
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,000
and ages clearly

668
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
is already quite something.

669
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,070
However,

670
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,640
I've already prepared the deposition.

671
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,830
It's three pages in total.

672
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:32,880
Here,

673
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:33,950
one,

674
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:34,950
two,

675
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:35,920
three.

676
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,160
Show it to him.

677
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:45,430
Did you manage

678
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,110
to get all their purchases

679
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,310
from the past year clear?

680
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,110
From the past three months.

681
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,520
I figured it out within half a day.

682
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,560
Get to the point.

683
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,880
Right, I'm getting to it.

684
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,590
I checked every single item on the list.

685
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,470
Get to the point.

686
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,190
There's no poison.

687
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:02,920
Zhao Buyou.

688
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:05,590
See anything unusual?

689
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,190
The records confirm there was no poison.

690
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:11,280
So the poisoner must be someone else.

691
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:13,350
Wan Fu,

692
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,680
these three errand boys are innocent.

693
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,350
Release them.

694
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,470
Zhao Buyou.

695
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,640
- You're ordering me to release them? - Release them.

696
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,800
Get lost!

697
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:32,950
Take your things.

698
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:36,520
Leave, hurry up!

699
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,230
Zhao Buyou.

700
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:44,920
Which one do you suspect?

701
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,400
Xiaoyi.

702
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:50,430
Wan Fu.

703
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,350
Have someone tail those three errand boys.

704
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,880
Focus on Xiaoyi.

705
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,160
Are you sure about this?

706
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,710
I'm almost certain.

707
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,280
Fine.

708
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,310
Alright.

709
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,800
Alright.

710
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:19,920
One!

711
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:21,710
Two!

712
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,160
Three!

713
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,430
Four!

714
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:29,350
This is the blade

715
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,470
I used in battle before.

716
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,640
No wonder. It feels different.

717
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,590
Is it heavy?

718
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,280
It's pretty heavy.

719
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,350
I mean, does it have a heavy scent of blood?

720
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:47,680
It's a fine blade.

721
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,190
Why him?

722
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,040
You mean Chen Xiaoyi?

723
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,560
Yes.

724
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,830
This is Chun Xi's purchase list

725
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,280
for the past three months.

726
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:06,000
Besides everyday necessities,

727
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,280
it includes

728
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:08,430
some burn ointments

729
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,950
and injury treatments.

730
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:11,280
Kang Qian abusing her.

731
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,640
It's no surprise she bought these.

732
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,800
Among those errands,

733
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,590
there's only one person

734
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:20,560
she always trusted to buy her medicine.

735
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:23,920
It shows Chun Xi trusted him.

736
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:27,070
You could say that.

737
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,240
Sit.

738
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,800
So you're saying

739
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,720
Chen Xiaoyi was responsible

740
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:37,990
because if Chen Xiaoyi

741
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:42,080
bought the poison for her

742
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,320
but didn't leave a record,

743
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,320
it's possible.

744
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:45,750
That's possible.

745
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,080
But to plan

746
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,480
a murder using the Hat Demon,

747
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,840
she couldn't

748
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,150
have done it alone.

749
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:55,990
She must have an accomplice outside.

750
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:57,110
So my guess is

751
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,440
Chen Xiaoyi is the key.

752
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:01,390
Boss!

753
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:03,870
You're still here?

754
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,200
Boss,

755
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,320
Just as I suspected.

756
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:09,960
Guess which of those three errand boys

757
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,000
has a problem?

758
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,720
Isn't it...

759
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:16,150
Isn't it Chen Xiaoyi?

760
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,720
Exactly, it's Chen Xiaoyi!

761
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,830
I followed all three of them.

762
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:21,920
The other two errand boys

763
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,870
took any job offered.

764
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:26,590
But Chen Xiaoyi

765
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:28,390
wouldn't take any job.

766
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,590
Even when they offered more money, he refused.

767
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,390
That's when I knew something was off.

768
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,280
So I kept following him.

769
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,110
And then?

770
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,200
Where did he go?

771
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:37,960
He went home.

772
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:38,720
What?

773
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:44,960
Inspector Gu,

774
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:46,110
I'll go take a look.

775
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,310
Much obliged.

776
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:53,960
Judge Wan,

777
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,520
why do you think

778
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,040
only Chen Xiaoyi among the three

779
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,790
is suspicious?

780
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:01,870
Isn't it what you said?

781
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:13,830
I just don't like him.

782
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:17,440
Fair enough.

783
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:26,150
Were you busy making money?

784
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:28,520
How many errands did you run yesterday?

785
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,150
Only ten.

786
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:31,200
Ten? What about you?

787
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,350
Not many,

788
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,150
but today's better.

789
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,200
All right, I'll head out too.

790
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,240
You...

791
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,480
Oh, it's you, sir!

792
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,370
Xiaoyi.

793
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,310
I just

794
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:45,520
happened to pass by.

795
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:46,790
I'm a bit thirsty.

796
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,390
Would you mind if I ask for a bowl of water?

797
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,390
Of course not. Have a seat.

798
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,040
It's pretty simple here.

799
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:53,870
Please don't mind.

800
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,680
It's fine.

801
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:56,920
It's actually quite pleasant.

802
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:00,150
Thank you for helping me out earlier.

803
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,070
We common folks get nervous

804
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,870
when we see officials.

805
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,350
We can't even talk straight.

806
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:07,680
Xiaoyi!

807
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:09,040
Bo.

808
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,280
I heard Kaifeng Court took you away.

809
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:11,870
Are you all right?

810
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:12,530
I'm fine.

811
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:13,680
See? Perfectly well.

812
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,150
Thanks to this sir. He helped me out.

813
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:18,870
Thank you.

814
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,280
Mr. Zhao!

815
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:23,870
You are?

816
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,760
I'm Sun Bo.

817
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,550
Sun Bo?

818
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,390
Do you know each other?

819
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:32,920
I used to be classmates with Mr. Zhao's brother,

820
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,040
Zhao Mo.

821
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:36,870
It's been so many years since we last met.

822
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,280
You're doing errands too?

823
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:41,630
I've got no skills,

824
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,960
just trying to make a living.

825
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,040
You're not right.

826
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,070
This is a skill.

827
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:48,350
Mr. Zhao,

828
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:50,040
I heard from them

829
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,280
that you solved the case

830
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,280
and cleared my name.

831
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:53,870
Thank you.

832
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:54,830
It was nothing.

833
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,760
Since we're here by chance,

834
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,240
I'll prepare some food.

835
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,350
Let's sit down and have a good chat!

836
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,550
I'll pass.

837
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,440
Mr. Zhao, I haven't finished my delivery yet.

838
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,680
I need to get going.

839
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:03,870
I'll visit you another day.

840
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:04,630
All right.

841
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,870
Come to my home sometime.

842
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:06,480
Sure!

843
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:07,480
All right.

844
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,830
Bo, take it slow.

845
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,070
Mr. Zhao, please sit.

846
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,830
It's such a coincidence that you two live together.

847
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:20,580
You wouldn't know.

848
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:21,920
When I first came to East Capital,

849
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:23,830
I had nowhere to stay and no work.

850
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,200
If Bo hadn't taken me in,

851
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:28,040
I don't know where I'd be now.

852
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:27,920
You've already looked around

853
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,280
every inch of my place, haven't you?

854
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
So,

855
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,930
what do you think of my house?

856
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:34,980
The house is too big

857
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:36,170
with too many vulnerabilities.

858
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,980
Any assassin

859
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,870
could find seven or eight ways to get in.

860
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,870
Then I really did find the right person.

861
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:44,000
So stop running around.

862
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,110
A personal bodyguard

863
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,630
is supposed to stick close to me.

864
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,630
Don't take a single step away from me.

865
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:51,790
The deadline to kill you hasn't come yet.

866
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,520
Other than me,

867
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,520
no one else should come after you.

868
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:57,920
Don't forget about that Hat Demon.

869
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:00,240
If Buyou

870
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,630
fails to uncover the Hat Demon,

871
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:05,310
it's still uncertain who will make the first move

872
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:06,760
between us in the end.

873
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,520
Then you can try me.

874
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,440
Mrs.,

875
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,080
I was just joking with you.

876
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,040
Look at you,

877
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:18,920
always so serious.

878
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:21,830
Since there's nothing to do,

879
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,440
how about I help you dress up?

880
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:27,280
No, thank you.

881
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,790
I don't like heavy makeup.

882
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:33,200
So Buyou prefers

883
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:35,590
someone as plain as a chrysanthemum?

884
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:38,070
I've never thought about what he likes in me.

885
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,000
This is just who I am.

886
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,310
Which man doesn't love beauty?

887
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,590
Buyou once said

888
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,920
his feelings for you turned from love to fear.

889
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:51,280
But where did that love come from?

890
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:54,870
It must have been your beauty that captivated him at first.

891
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:58,390
If you had ever been truly loved,

892
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:00,280
you wouldn't say such things.

893
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:07,240
With my looks,

894
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:09,200
my figure,

895
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,630
and my status,

896
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:12,720
how could no one admire me?

897
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,480
I just don't want to be loved by one person.

898
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,590
I want to be loved by many, many people.

899
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:22,280
Loved by so many...

900
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:24,200
aren't you tired?

901
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:27,000
It's like when I already have plenty of money,

902
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,720
but I still want

903
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,280
more and more money.

904
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:32,720
No matter how much I have, it's never enough.

905
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,590
You're so greedy.

906
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,110
Is greed a crime?

907
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,200
Greed isn't a crime.

908
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,110
But greedy people are greedy

909
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:46,960
because they always want

910
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,680
what they can never have.

911
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:56,760
[The Academy of Painting]

912
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,350
Mr. Zhao,

913
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:59,070
did you come here

914
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:01,040
to see my paintings?

915
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,630
These are scenes I recently painted

916
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:04,870
while traveling around East Capital.

917
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:07,070
They're truly breathtaking.

918
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:09,280
The streets you painted

919
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:12,310
look exactly like what I see every day.

920
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:15,070
All things in the streets change in an instant.

921
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:16,630
If you want to capture them,

922
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,110
you must work diligently

923
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,870
and you have to paint with care.

924
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:20,590
Good.

925
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:23,520
I need to borrow one of your paintings

926
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,150
to find someone.

927
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:25,440
Are you solving a case again?

928
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:28,830
Have you found the culprit behind the Hat Demon case?

929
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,070
Not yet.

930
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,890
I've been around Yanglou Street lately,

931
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:33,830
chasing that Hat Demon.

932
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,200
Whenever the Hat Demon appears,

933
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,440
I draw it.

934
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,590
You've drawn it all?

935
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:41,630
Look.

936
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,630
When was this painting done?

937
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:50,210
It was the day we saw it

938
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:51,350
before the demon hunt event.

939
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:53,310
Yes.

940
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:55,830
That's where we met.

941
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,200
This is Kang Qian's house.

942
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:03,550
So the person standing behind that door must be Mrs. Kang.

943
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,960
You even captured the plum blossom fan

944
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,070
in her hand.

945
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:09,310
Mr. Zhang,

946
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:11,680
do you remember

947
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,870
who was visiting

948
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,550
when Mrs. Kang opened the door?

949
