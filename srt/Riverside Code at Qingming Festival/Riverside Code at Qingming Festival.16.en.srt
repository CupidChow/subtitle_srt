People from all over the world gather here,

00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,380
and envoys from various countries come to communicate with the authorities.

Mr. Song is not dead.

23
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,590
Why is everyone so unhappy?

24
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:45,800
Maybe it's because

25
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,310
if the deceased is Zou Yongjin,

26
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,800
then who killed him

27
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,660

the murderer acted out of anger,

30

which is why they stuffed so many books

31
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,380
into his stomach.

32
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,720
Maybe the books were stuffed

33
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,600
to make him study more.

34
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:01,800
But,

35
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,130
who would do such a thing?

Song Qiyu.

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,600
Sir,

38
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,960
the scholar from Jinzhou you're looking for

39
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,910
lives in this room.

40
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,750
Thank you.

41
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,240
May I ask, are you Wang Qin from Jinzhou?

42
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:40,720
I'd like to ask you

43
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,110
about Song Qiyu.

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,270
I haven't seen that bastard in ages,

45
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:46,480
and it's none of my business!

46
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,190

Mr. Wang!

49
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,160
I know you owe the shopkeeper two guan of wine money.

50
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,000
Come out and talk with me.

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,750
I'll pay it for you.

52
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,390
Mr. Wang!

53
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,160
Mr. Wang!

Here's the wine money

56
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,360
and a family letter.

57
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,320
Please,

58
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,110
deliver it back

59
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,390

60
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,750
Everyone in the Song family is dead.

61
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,110
Who am I delivering this to?

62
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,880
Young man,

63
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,630
you seem quite decent,

64
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,830
so how can you misjudge people like this,

65
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,640
befriending such a scoundrel?

66
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,320
If you ask me...

67
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,030
What are you saying?

68
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,630
I'm saying that orphaned bastard

69
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,670
should've died already.

70
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,720
He's got the face of someone doomed to an early death.

71
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,720
You...

72
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,320
mixing with someone like Song,

73
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,600
you're no good either!

74
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,390
Flashing your family's bit of wealth,

75
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,440
acting all high and mighty,

76
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,440
looking down on everyone!

77
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:43,880
You're lying!

78
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,550
Mr. Song isn't like that.

79
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:47,270
He's not!

80
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:48,800
He's not!

81
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:49,830
He's not!

82
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:50,830
He's not!

83
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,880
I'm not lying.

84
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,080
The Song family has only Song Qiyu left to manage things.

85
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,030
At sixteen, he inherited the family estate

86
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:58,910
and started dominating the place,

87
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,270
which is well-known in Jinzhou!

88
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,910
Although I haven't seen him in the past two years,

89
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,190
I personally saw him on the street before,

90
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,630
constantly beating or scolding his servants.

91
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,360
In his household, there was a mule driver,

92
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,440
whose son was his pageboy.

93
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,360
This father and son were treated like dogs,

94
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,320
serving him day and night!

95
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,030
If you don't believe me,

96
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,600
go ask around.

97
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,320
If I, Wang Qin, utter a single lie,

98
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,000
may I choke on cold wine and die!

99
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,320
So, Song Qiyu

100
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,510
is really alive.

101
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,350
The dead man was Zou Yongjin.

102
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,440
Wen Yue,

103
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,110
you don't seem surprised at all.

104
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,920
Did you already guess it?

105
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,070
Judging by Mo's reaction yesterday,

106
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:09,920
I feel like

107
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,880
he knows something but hasn't told us.

108
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,070
Are you saying

109
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,230
Mo already knew?

110
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,120
Mo is simple-minded,

111
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,260
but not foolish.

112
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,210
Besides, he and Mr. Song

113
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,040
are such close friends.

114
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,660
So, where do you think Song Qiyu is now?

115
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,350
I wonder if Zhao Mo

116
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,790
is still in contact with him.

117
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,160
If they are,

118
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,230
that would be trouble.

119
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,350
Not reporting what you know

120
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,480
and harboring a runaway

121
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,760
are serious crimes.

122
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,600
Logically,

123
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,790
I hope

124
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,320
Zhao Mo cuts ties with him

125
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,040
and tells us the truth.

126
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,670
But emotionally...

127
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,510
That's where the difficulty lies.

128
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,200
Mo grew up

129
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:05,320
only close to Sun Bo and Mr. Song.

130
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:06,760
Besides,

131
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,550
judging from Mr. Song's behavior,

132
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,950
he doesn't seem like a vicious person.

133
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,390
There must be more to it.

134
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,670
No matter the hidden truth,

135
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,440
killing someone is still killing.

136
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,040
The law is impartial.

137
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,950
But thinking about the situation of people like Song Qiyu and Sun Bo,

138
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,070
I can't help but wonder...

139
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:30,790
Then how do we

140
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,390
deal with people like them?

141
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,950
Is there no justice in this world?

142
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:38,790
Can the lives of the poor

143
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,480
just be trampled on?

144
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,950
If they don't want to be prey,

145
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,320
slaughtered at will,

146
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,550
should they pick up a blade?

147
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,160
I really don't dare think further.

148
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,070
Even though things have reached this point,

149
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,510
I feel

150
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,070
we should extend a hand to help him.

151
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,480
You're right.

152
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,270
Let Song Qiyu tell the truth

153
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,320
and turn himself in.

154
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,600
I'll draft a petition for him

155
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,850
and submit it to the court.

156
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:20,600
This way,

157
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,670
we might be able to save his life.

158
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,230
The problem is,

159
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,950
how do we get Song Qiyu to speak the truth?

160
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,920
The only person who can get Song Qiyu to open up

161
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,160
in this world

162
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,880
is probably Zhao Mo.

163
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,770
This is the ancestral home of Jian Zhuang,

164
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:45,720
leader of the Seven Scholars of Dongshui.

165
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,640
We've been searching for him for days,

166
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,110
and it turns out he fled back here.

167
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,920
I knew you would come,

168
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,230
so I've

169
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,880
prepared everything.

170
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:57,550
Boss,

171
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,070
should we continue searching?

172
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,110
No need.

173
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,320
He's been waiting for us.

174
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,550
My family

175
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,000
have all been sent away.

176
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:12,920
They know nothing

177
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,390
of my affairs.

178
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:29,920
These

179
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,880
are the benefits I've gained

180
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:34,840
over the years

181
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,320
from arranging exam proxies.

182
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,440
These things have kept me on edge every day.

183
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,110
Now that you're here,

184
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,280
I actually

185
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,590
feel relieved.

186
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,960
The famous Scholar Jian Zhuang

187
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,840
turns out to be a man greedy for wealth!

188
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,520
I'm not!

189
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,670
They promised to find me a position after the deed was done.

did you kill those scholars too?

I didn't!

00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,160
this shouldn't have happened!

381
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,920
All the blame

382
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,470
should've fallen on me alone!

383
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,400
Why did you have to ruin my son's future?

384
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:32,760
That old man dared to come here crying,

385
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,350
ruining your good mood.

386
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:37,520
Let them report to the authorities. We'll say I killed a dog.

387
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,430
You go to Kaifeng Court

388
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:40,830
and settle the matter.

389
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,290
After my father died,

390
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,690
I wanted to follow him.

391
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,470
But those hateful, despicable people

392
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,920
are still alive.

393
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,430
I must avenge my father

394
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,000
and drag them all to the grave with him!

395
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,950
Whether it's Zou Yongjin,

396
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,950
Zhang Mei, or Zheng Dun,

397
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,880
they should all face justice under the law.

398
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,430
And what has the law decided?

399
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,070
Did your complaint that day lead to anything?

400
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,590
Do people like us, lowly commoners,

401
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:29,800
deserve to be manipulated?

402
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:34,000
If they push a pawn on the chessboard to death,

403
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,350
then I'll make

404
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,310
the players

405
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:41,590
experience the fear of death too.

406
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,430
Kaifeng Court already knows

407
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,710
the corpse is Zou Yongjin,

408
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:52,470
not you.

409
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,950
And those wicked Zou family members

410
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,830
will soon receive their punishment.

411
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:01,350
But if you go to Zheng Dun now,

412
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,830
you won't walk away in one piece.

413
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,830
From the day I decided to take this step,

414
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,800
I knew there was no turning back.

415
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,040
Last time,

416
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,920
when I thought you were harmed,

417
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,590
my heart died once already.

418
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:25,950
This time,

419
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,430
I won't let anything happen to you.

420
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,000
Here's all my savings.

421
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,230
Hire a carriage

422
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,950
and leave East Capital immediately.

423
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,000
Do you remember our laminated beam arch bridge?

424
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,040
As long as the main beam remains intact,

425
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,070
the bridge won't collapse.

426
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,950
It's the same with people.

427
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,760
Everyone takes a wrong path sometimes,

428
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,640
but as long as you have the will to change,

429
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,680
as long as your core stays strong,

430
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:03,040
it's never too late to turn back.

431
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:08,640
Forget everything that happened here.

432
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,350
Find a place where no one knows you

433
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,880
and live true to yourself.

434
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:24,800
Who's there?

435
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:28,920
Zheng Dun.

436
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,880
Mo,

437
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,560
you scared me.

438
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,000
Song Qiyu...

439
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,280
Song... Song Qiyu...

440
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:39,680
What's wrong?

441
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,520
No!

442
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,470
No, Mr. Song!

443
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,710
I told you to leave me alone!

444
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,430
Spare me!

445
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,160
Spare me! I don't want to die!

446
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,230
Spare me!

447
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,230
If blood must be spilled today,

448
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,470
let me finish this for you.

449
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:00,880
No!

450
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,190
Mo!

451
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,310
you must not kill!

452
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:05,920
You're pure and innocent.

453
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,190
You still have family,

454
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,920
and a bright future ahead.

455
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,190
You're the person I envy the most.

456
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,350
You must not kill.

457
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,620
[Nanshan Tea House]

458
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,310
It's here.

459
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,110
Tie Chi, Fei Jian!

460
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:25,710
Got it!

461
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,520
Officers!

462
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,160
All of you officers,

463
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,110
you've arrived just in time!

464
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:35,070
Song Qiyu and Zhao Mo are trying to kill me!

465
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,000
What are you doing to me?

466
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,190
Those murderers...

467
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:38,830
they're upstairs!

468
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,280
The culprits are on the second floor!

469
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,040
Hurry!

470
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,110
The officers are here!

471
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,280
Is there another exit?

472
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:50,920
Hold me hostage.

473
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:53,560
Zhao Mo and the others want to kill me!

474
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,760
Why are you grabbing me?

475
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,230
The murderer is upstairs!

476
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,830
If, from the very beginning when you met me,

477
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,800
you knew I was born of a lowly background,

478
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,190
would you still have been my friend?

479
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,110
No matter who you are,

480
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,590
what difference does it make?

481
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,570
Who is the murderer?

482
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:22,360
It's...

483
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,830
Shan Shiliu.

484
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,710
He's the Zou family's blade in East Capital.

485
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:27,920
He kills for the Zou family.

486
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:29,920
He came to me every time.

487
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,350
He's the one who killed them.

488
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:33,040
It has nothing to do with me!

489
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,680
Officers, it really has nothing to do with me!

490
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,710
Officers!

491
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:36,710
Take him away.

492
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:37,190
Move.

493
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:37,950
Officers!

494
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,110
Mo!

495
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:40,640
Mr. Song,

496
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,470
what... what are you doing?

497
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:45,000
Song Qiyu,

498
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:46,950
put the knife down first.

499
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,280
Zhao Mo is your closest friend.

500
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:51,540
And we've

501
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,350
already considered you like a younger brother.

502
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,000
We just learned about your situation.

503
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,000
We're sorry, Mr. Song.

504
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,430
During your hardest times,

505
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,040
we couldn't be there to help.

506
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,230
Put the knife down first.

507
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:06,040
Mr. Song,

508
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,230
Mo cares about you the most.

509
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,430
You shouldn't hurt him.

510
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,640
I'd rather you all think Mr. Song is already dead.

511
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,800
I don't deserve your family's kindness.

512
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:20,590
Mr. Song...

513
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:21,560
Step back!

514
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,760
Mr. Song,

515
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,310
Buyou is a litigator.

516
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,000
No matter your grievances,

517
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,950
he'll help you seek justice.

518
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,400
Yes!

519
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,190
Zheng Dun has already been captured.

520
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:34,400
What's urgent now

521
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,280
is getting him to reveal the truth about the proxy exams

522
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,760
and expose their entire network.

523
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:39,950
Only then can we

524
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:41,040
wipe them out completely.

525
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,560
That's how we get revenge!

526
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:48,880
Up to the second floor, quickly!

527
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,430
Yes!

528
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,350
- Hurry! - Mr. Song.

529
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,760
Give me the knife

530
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:53,160
or it will be too late.

531
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,560
My name is Ding Dan.

532
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,160
Everything from the past...

533
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,230
I ask for your forgiveness.

534
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,470
Qiyu!

535
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,310
Song Qiyu!

536
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:12,880
Song Qiyu!

537
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,230
All officers of Kaifeng Court,

538
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,400
please bear witness here!

539
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,560
It was solely my decision to kill Zheng Dun!

540
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,040
It has nothing to do

541
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,800
with Zhao Mo!

542
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:24,880
Song Qiyu!

543
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,110
Everything that happened today

544
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,040
was done by me holding him hostage!

545
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:31,310
Song Qiyu, Zhao Mo!

546
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,710
Both of you, come down!

547
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:35,230
Kaifeng Court is willing to go easy on you!

548
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:36,950
Song Qiyu, open the door!

549
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:37,920
Open the door!

550
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,000
Mo...

551
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,310
Mr. Song...

552
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:42,880
Meeting you in this life

553
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:47,280
has been enough.

554
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:52,640
I...

555
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,640
I'm sorry.

556
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,310
The lock...

557
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,950
this...

558
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,070
Help me undo it...

559
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,430
Thank you.

560
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,760
I'll undo it.

561
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,470
If you wish to carve a tombstone for him,

562
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,310
you should first write the message,

563
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:46,430
then use red ink to outline the characters.

564
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,190
Paste the paper onto the stone,

565
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:49,040
then carve the words.

566
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,680
That's the only way to preserve his dignity.

567
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,680
Buyou,

568
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:07,470
just a few days ago,

569
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,430
he and I

570
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,470
were drinking together.

571
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,040
A perfectly fine person,

572
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,470
suddenly,

573
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:22,070
reduced to a handful of dirt.

574
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:25,470
I have also experienced

575
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,680
that feeling you have.

576
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,400
With an old friend,

577
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,470
sharing drinks joyfully one day,

578
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,190
only for the next meeting to be a farewell.

579
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,310
I've felt that sense

580
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,760
of powerlessness.

581
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,920
Ding Dan has died twice

582
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:44,310
in front of me.

583
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,520
Aside from carving his tombstone message,

584
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,310
there's nothing more I can do for him.

585
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,520
But I don't even know how to carve.

586
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:57,230
Don't blame yourself.

587
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,230
Didn't you compile that poetry collection for him?

588
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,920
That's a comfort for him in the afterlife.

589
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:09,000
Buyou,

590
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,230
do you ever feel

591
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,070
like we're living on a chessboard?

592
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:18,710
Following the rules,

593
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,950
being manipulated

594
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,040
like chess pieces from birth to death.

595
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,310
No.

596
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,680
Humans shouldn't be chess pieces.

597
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,560
Though

598
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,230
life may be like chess,

599
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:36,040
are we really pieces on a board?

600
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,920
I don't think so.

601
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,280
Chess is played by people.

602
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,350
Where you place a piece,

603
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,680
it stays there.

604
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,920
Humans are different.

605
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:48,520
Humans can choose, advance, or retreat.

606
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,560
Even if the big picture is hard to change,

607
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,680
we can still choose our fate.

608
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,470
Take Ding Dan,

609
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,400
wasn't he always trying

610
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,830
to change his destiny?

611
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:02,680
Even though his methods were questionable,

612
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,190
he refused to be someone else's pawn,

613
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:10,000
even as a scholar.

614
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,230
I truly respect

615
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:13,350
such a person.

616
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:14,640
Mo,

617
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,230
finish carving the message.

618
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:18,590
Let's toast him together.

619
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:19,230
How about that?

620
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:25,740
[Tomb of]

621
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:32,700
[Ding Dan]

622
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:34,070
I'm a scholar taking this year's exam,

623
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:35,760
working as an inspector in the news bureau.

624
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:37,470
If I truly pass the exams and get appointed,

625
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:38,470
I will become an official

626
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:39,950
who ensures the people have enough to eat

627
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,470
and someone to rely on.

628
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,880
It's fortunate that you and I

629
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,350
are willing to fight for the people,

630
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,760
to enter service for the sake of their well-being.

631
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,040
Mo!

632
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,160
Mo!

633
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,590
My name is Ding Dan.

634
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,280
Everything from the past...

635
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,430
I ask for your forgiveness.

636
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,780
[Ding Dan]

637
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,590
Buyou,

638
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,950
will he remember me?

639
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,710
He will.

640
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,920
[Tomb of Ding Dan]
Ding Dan wanted to change his destiny,

641
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,450
but in the end, he was still manipulated.

642
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:19,560
He untied the lock

643
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,000
but deliberately left it for me.

644
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,110
He wanted to show me his helplessness.

645
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:26,400
Mo,

646
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,710
I don't understand what you meant just now.

647
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,710
Inside the lock I gave Ding Dan,

648
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,520
I found this note.

649
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,750
[The one who exposed your true identity is still alive...]

650
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,350
[If you don't believe it, ask Chen Baoshan at Great Shop of Mules and Horses.]

651
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:49,560
"The one who exposed your true identity

652
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,880
is still alive.

653
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,950
He's still hidden among the Seven Scholars.

654
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,310
If you don't believe it,

655
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,280
ask Chen Baoshan

656
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,640
at the Great Shop of Mules and Horses."

657
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:01,190
True identity...

658
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,310
What does it mean?

659
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,680
Song Qiyu's original name was Ding Dan.

660
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,830
Recently,

661
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:10,870
the mule driver killed by the Zou family was Ding Dalang,

662
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:12,600
his biological father.

663
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:14,230
Which means,

664
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:16,230
the real instigator

665
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:18,040
has been watching from the sidelines,

666
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,560
manipulating

667
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,670
Ding Dan into killing.

668
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,280
That's roughly how it seems.

669
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,040
What we know for sure now is

670
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,520
the instigator isn't Shan Shiliu.

671
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,390
Shan Shiliu killed Xiao Yishui

672
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:30,870
only because Xiao Yishui

673
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,600
ruined the auspicious occasion

674
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,360
and disrupted Zou Mian's plans.

675
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,040
Even if Shan Shiliu isn't the instigator,

676
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,150
he can't just be let off.

677
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,280
Don't worry.

678
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,520
Inspector Gu will catch him,

679
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,390
right?

680
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,430
Where am I supposed to catch him?

681
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:48,230
Everyone who should be dead is already dead.

682
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,190
He wouldn't still be in East Capital,

683
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:52,740
waiting for me to catch him.

684
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,840
What if someone who should be dead isn't dead?

685
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,190
What kind of idea are you cooking up now?

686
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,800
Let's hear it.

687
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,120
If Shan Shiliu thinks Song Qiyu is dead,

688
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,470
he'll assume the job is done and leave,

689
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,280
right?

690
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:10,760
The news of Song Qiyu's death

691
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,230
is only known to a few of us.

692
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,000
We shouldn't let it out.

693
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:17,560
Issue another wanted notice for Song Qiyu

694
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,800
to lure Shan Shiliu out.

695
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:21,390
Taking advantage of the thick morning fog in the woods recently,

696
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:22,360
we can capture him.

697
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,390
I'll go too.

698
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,230
I want to catch Shan Shiliu.

699
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,040
You...

700
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:26,670
just sit down.

701
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,800
Who asked for your opinion?

702
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,000
Can Wen Yue go?

703
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,280
Of course not.

704
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,910
She's a delicate woman.

705
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:34,950
What's the point of her going?

706
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:35,870
Mo,

707
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:37,390
do you realize

708
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,080
how dangerous

709
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,080
this is now?

710
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,520
No matter how dangerous, I have to go.

711
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:47,040
Before Ding Dan died, he returned the lock to me

712
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,870
so I could know that the ones

713
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,840
who caused his death

714
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,040
were the people in the Zou family's proxy exam network.

715
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:54,600
And Shan Shiliu was their killer, silencing people for them.

716
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:55,950
I can't let Ding Dan

717
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,360
or those candidates

718
00:35:57,910 --> 00:35:58,870
die in vain.

719
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,430
We must catch Shan Shiliu.

720
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,080
Inspector Gu already knows this.

721
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,710
You just wait for our news.

722
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:07,800
Either way, you can't go.

723
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,520
Buyou...

724
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:08,940
Enough!

725
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,080
Zhao Buyou,

726
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:13,080
don't you know your younger brother's nature by now?

727
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:14,670
Mo,

728
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,390
sit down.

729
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,710
Stop indulging him.

730
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,120
You should just stay home

731
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,360
and wait for my updates...

732
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,360
Since that's the case,

733
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,320
then for everything,

734
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,470
you must listen to your brother and sister-in-law.

735
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,520
Don't act impulsively

736
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:47,150
and lose your life.

737
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:55,340
- Mr. Zhang, farewell. - Take it.

738
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:56,420
Farewell.

739
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:01,280
Kaifeng Court decree:

740
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:02,470
Effective immediately,

741
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,080
the entire city must capture the runaway

742
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,280
Song Qiyu.

743
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,600
Song Qiyu...

744
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:09,670
Kaifeng Court Announcement:

745
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,530
[Wanted Notice for Song Qiyu]

746
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:11,560
As per the laws of the Great Song Dynasty,

747
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:13,600
to calm public anger

748
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,320
and punish the true culprit,

749
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:19,360
this court hereby issues a wanted notice.

750
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,320
Shh.

751
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,360
Don't make noise.

752
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:10,120
Mo!

753
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:12,000
Where's Zhao Mo?

754
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:13,630
Mo!

755
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:14,520
Let's go find him.

756
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:30,040
