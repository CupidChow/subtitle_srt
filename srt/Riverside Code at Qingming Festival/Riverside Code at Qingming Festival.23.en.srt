People from all over the world gather here,

12
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,940
and envoys from various countries come to communicate with the authorities.

Sorry,

21
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,370
I had too much on my plate and came late.

22
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:57,840
It's okay.

23
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,830
I asked you out last minute.

24
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,230
Have some tea first.

25
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,080
Zheng,

26
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,680
do you have something to say?

27
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,160
No,

28
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,270
I just feel like you're always too busy

29
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,190
and probably don't take care of yourself.

30
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,240
From now on,

31
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,800
you should come home for meals.

32
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:17,440
It's fine.

33
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,720
The Office of Justice has a public kitchen.

34
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,470
But the food from the kitchen

35
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,630
is no match for our sister's cooking.

36
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,110
Actually, I am wondering

37
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,210
is it because I moved in

38
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,930
and caused trouble for everyone

39
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,360
that you don't want to stay home?

40
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,830
No, Zheng.

41
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:42,600
Really, no.

42
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,360
Oh, right.

43
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:49,890
This is for you.

44
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,520
I found it while packing my things.

45
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,550
I took it from home when our family

46
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,830
fell into misfortune.

47
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,440
I've kept it close all these years.

48
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,730
You love clever objects,

49
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,940
so I'm giving this to you,

50
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,500
meaning it's somewhere where it can be a value.

51
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,360
This is...

52
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,390
a ship blueprint?

53
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,170
Yes.

54
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,910
My father was the chief shipbuilder at the Taihu Shipyard.

55
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,320
He handed

56
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,440
this blueprint to me personally before he passed.

57
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:28,960
Zheng,

58
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,960
this is too valuable.

59
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,160
I can't accept it.

60
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,390
No, Mo!

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,190
Now I'm with all of you,

62
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,050
and I have this family.

63
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:36,920
I cherish it greatly.

64
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,750
It's time for me to let go of these things.

65
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,670
Zheng,

66
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,600
you are Wen Yue's family,

67
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,830
so you're our family too.

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,030
Don't worry.

69
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,830
I'll keep this blueprint safe.

70
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,000
Then,

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
let's toast with tea instead of wine.

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,800
Sure.

73
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,470
Why not have dinner at home tonight?

74
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,190
What would you like to eat?

75
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,360
I'll pick it up on my way back.

76
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:12,750
Alright.

77
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:16,880
By the way,

78
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,200
don't tell my sister

79
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,550
about the blueprint.

80
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:20,950
I'm afraid it'll upset her.

81
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,000
First, heat the oil.

82
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,920
You need ginger to stir-fry chicken,

83
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,320
so it won’t have a greasy smell.

84
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,830
Put it into the wok!

85
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,230
Water, pour it in!

86
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,320
Pour it all?

87
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:38,830
All of it!

88
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,270
Cover the lid.

89
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,390
Ban,

90
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,670
do you need help with anything?

91
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,600
I'm done.

92
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,830
Take it to Wen Yue.

93
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,440
Ban,

94
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,000
go find Father and bring him back for dinner.

95
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,760
Got it!

96
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,480
Zhao Ban,

97
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,790
where are you going?

98
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,480
Zhao Mo! A surprise seeing you here.

99
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,040
I'm going to find Father.

100
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,720
Alright, off I go.

101
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,830
Mo's back!

102
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,200
Wen Yue, Buyou,

103
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:08,640
Zheng.

104
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,390
This is custard from the Office of Justice's kitchen.

105
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,720
You're just like your big brother.

106
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,200
You have my style!

107
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,160
Did you come back today because you knew

108
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,880
the imperial chef cooked himself?

109
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,510
Your cooking is getting more delicious.

110
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,600
I'm going to grab some clean clothes.

111
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,600
Go ahead.

112
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,390
What did he say he's getting?

113
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,040
Some clean clothes.

114
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,600
Dear,

115
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,200
help me stir the chicken.

116
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,480
Why did he come back so suddenly?

117
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:41,730
Let's add another dish for Mo.

118
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,350
Mo,

119
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,520
is there something special you'd like to eat?

120
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,770
Tell Wen Yue, and she'll make it for you.

121
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:57,900
Got it.

122
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,000
Is it cold

123
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,670
sleeping over at the office?

124
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,760
No, not at all.

125
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,550
Since Zheng came back,

126
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,720
he's been using your bed.

127
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,550
I'm feeling sorry about it.

128
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,200
I want to discuss something with you.

129
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,550
Look, Mo,

130
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,760
let's push this rack out

131
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,550
and place your bed here.

132
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:15,760
I'll add another board to make it wider...

133
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,070
Buyou, no need.

134
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,510
Once we move to the new house,

135
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,510
there'll be more space.

136
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,270
Okay.

137
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,200
When we get the new house,

138
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,230
I will give you the biggest room!

139
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,160
By the way,

140
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,550
I want to ask you something.

141
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,880
Was the old shipyard of Wen Yue's family

142
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,230
a private one or a government-run one?

143
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,550
A private one, I think.

144
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,960
Why are you asking about this?

145
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,940
A private shipyard?

146
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:45,480
What's the matter?

147
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,480
Come on.

148
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:53,830
Sit over here.

149
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:59,760
Buyou,

150
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,920
look at this blueprint.

151
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,950
Is it for a warship or a private ship?

152
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,880
I don't know how to tell.

153
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,000
How can you distinguish it?

154
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,000
This is a modification blueprint.

155
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,480
The ship has several rows of oars.

156
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,200
This is obviously a warship.

157
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,600
But

158
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,000
why would a private shipyard

159
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,670
have a blueprint for a warship?

160
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:20,880
Are you saying

161
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,790
this blueprint

162
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:22,950
is from Wen Yue's family?

163
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:25,160
Zheng said this blueprint

164
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,350
was handed to him by his father before he passed.

165
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,040
It's from their shipyard.

166
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,790
What else did he say?

167
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,790
He said he knew I was interested in these things,

168
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,600
and he didn't want to keep them

169
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,510
because they reminded him of sad memories.

170
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,720
So he gave it to me.

171
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,160
Did Wen Yue see it?

172
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,440
No.

173
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,350
Right.

174
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,390
It's all in the past.

175
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,640
Don't tell her.

176
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,640
I'm afraid it'll upset her.

177
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,830
I understand.

178
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,720
Zheng also explicitly told me

179
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,760
not to let Wen Yue know about this.

180
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,110
I'll take the ship blueprint and study it.

181
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,350
Time to eat.

182
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,390
Oh, you're cooking.

183
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,760
Inspector Gu, you arrive just in time for dinner.

184
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:18,760
Gu,

185
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,440
you knew we were about to eat,

186
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,480
so you came over!

187
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,070
Mr. Gu is here!

188
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,600
Mo,

189
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,440
go help bring out the dishes.

190
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,000
Alright.

191
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,510
Zhao,

192
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,350
Zou Mian may already be in East Capital.

193
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,110
Wasn't Zou Mian in the South?

194
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,550
In the past two days,

195
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,520
some high-ranking officials were accused of taking bribes,

196
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,790
rumored to be as much as 300,000 liang of silver.

197
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,590
They've all been taken in for questioning.

198
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,470
This includes officials from the Ministry of Justice,

199
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,780
the Office of Justice,

200
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,320
and our Kaifeng Court.

201
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,280
They're all responsible for handling criminal cases.

202
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,710
All of them are connected to Luan Hui's case.

203
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,470
That old scoundrel Zou Mian

204
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,080
must be here to save his son-in-law and daughter.

205
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,590
It's said that he's gravely ill in the South,

206
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,400
but I suspect

207
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,880
he's already slipped

208
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,000
into East Capital unnoticed.

209
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,470
What's wrong?

210
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,120
It's possible.

211
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,720
Something on your mind?

212
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:23,800
No, I'm listening.

213
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:27,910
Mo,

214
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:29,250
where's Zheng?

215
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,520
He was just here.

216
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,230
Getting ready for dinner.

217
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,790
- Zheng, come out for dinner! - Let's eat first.

218
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:35,550
We'll talk after dinner.

219
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,350
Mo,

220
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,910
hurry, bring some wine over.

221
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,080
I must have come at a bad time.

222
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,670
You all go ahead and eat.

223
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:42,590
Have you eaten?

224
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,350
I'll catch up with you later, Gu.

225
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:51,960
Xie Laoba

226
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,910
keeps asking me to drink away his sorrows.

227
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,580
Every time he drinks, he'll cries,

228
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,760
loud enough

229
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,880
for all of Sparrow Lane to hear.

230
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,880
- People even think I'm bullying him... - Alright, Father.

231
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,910
Father, you're back!

232
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:01,640
We're back!

233
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,520
I'm back!

234
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,670
Let's eat first, Father.

235
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,080
Go out after dinner.

236
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,230
What's for dinner today?

237
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,910
Today...

238
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:09,840
we're having stir-fried chicken.

239
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:10,910
Have a seat, Father.

240
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:11,840
Where's Zheng?

241
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,710
He's still in the room.

242
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,200
Zheng, come out for dinner!

243
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,110
I'll tell you...

244
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:16,790
Mrs. Lan...

245
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,280
- Coming! - She doesn't side with me at all.

246
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,280
- I know exactly where she's gone. - Uncle.

247
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,200
Ban.

248
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,080
Come on, dinner time!

249
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,710
Time to eat.

250
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,080
Now that Mo's back,

251
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,000
Uncle and Buyou should have a drink, shouldn't you?

252
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,010
Not today.

253
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:31,880
I'll drink.

254
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,030
It's all yours.

255
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:36,640
No way.

256
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,880
- That's too much. - That's too much for him!

257
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,230
This is mine.

258
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,000
All mine!

259
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:44,910
Mo.

260
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,120
- You're not eating, just drinking? - Father.

261
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:47,960
Have a bite first.

262
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,470
Here.

263
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:56,910
Buyou,

264
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,110
this bowl of wine

265
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,640
is to thank you for taking me in,

266
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,760
and thank Mo for being so understanding.

267
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:05,230
You've given me such a wonderful family.

268
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,910
So,

269
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,280
I toast to you all.

270
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,470
I...

271
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,000
Zheng,

272
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,350
you're being too kind.

273
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,880
Buyou and I

274
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,000
will down this drink together.

275
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,910
Don't force yourself.

276
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,000
It's fine.

277
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,790
It's rare for Zheng to be in such good spirits.

278
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,790
I'm happy to have you with us.

279
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:36,590
Come on.

280
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:43,620
Buyou, you're so bold!

281
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:45,900
Buyou,

282
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,080
let me refill your bowl.

283
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,320
- This is really good. - You all eat something first.

284
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,320
Alright, it's fine.

285
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,000
Mo.

286
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,520
This wine is pretty good.

287
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,200
Buyou...

288
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,110
He fell asleep.

289
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,230
Fell asleep...

290
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,000
Mo,

291
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,910
let's continue...

292
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:10,470
Zheng,

293
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,110
that's enough.

294
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,400
You've had plenty.

295
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,550
What's so special about tonight

296
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,470
that you're this happy?

297
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,440
Wen Yue,

298
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,470
tonight,

299
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,200
everyone's here.

300
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,840
How could I not be happy?

301
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,440
I've waited so long, and finally, we're all together.

302
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,520
Let me have just one more drink.

303
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:32,960
Alright,

304
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,550
then I'll come home for dinner more often.

305
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,470
Zheng, stop drinking.

306
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,200
Look, you're getting a headache.

307
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,590
That's enough.

308
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,910
Everyone, stop drinking now.

309
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,150
Ban,

310
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,290
get Buyou to bed.

311
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:53,540
Mo,

312
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,360
help Zheng to his room.

313
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,840
- Zheng, let's go. - No...

314
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,280
No more?

315
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,320
No more. Stop now.

316
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:01,880
Let's go.

317
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,400
I still have to go back to the Office of Justice.

318
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,760
Zheng.

319
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:12,880
Wen Yue.

320
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,670
Lie down.

321
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:16,960
Does your head still hurt?

322
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,910
No, just feeling a little off.

323
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,520
Every time I faked being sick when I was a kid,

324
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,790
you'd give me

325
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,440
that serious look to test me.

326
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,550
I never thought

327
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,790
you'd still test me as an adult.

328
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,080
After we grow up,

329
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,300
many things have changed.

330
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,760
Do you think I've changed

331
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,030
or has your affection for me changed?

332
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,960
If you're not feeling well,

333
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:56,350
don't wander around at night.

334
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,260
Don't make it worse.

335
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,840
And what if I don't want to listen?

336
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,960
You're still the same as when we were kids,

337
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,760
so serious about jokes.

338
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,150
Don't worry.

339
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,670
I'll rest properly.

340
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,280
Besides, I know

341
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,550
nowadays,

342
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,590
no matter what I do,

343
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,590
you'll always be there for me.

344
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,470
Right?

345
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,440
Yes.

346
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,640
I'll...

347
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,200
always be here for you.

348
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,760
We seek an audience with Mr. Zou.

349
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:11,320
We seek an audience with Mr. Zou.

350
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,710
We seek an audience with Mr. Zou.

351
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,350
All right.

352
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:40,710
Zou Mian,

353
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,880
you've finally come.

354
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,230
You put drugs in Buyou's wine

355
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,590
just for this?

356
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,880
Wen Yue,

357
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,760
I knew you'd come.

358
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,110
Wen Yue,

359
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:03,710
look,

360
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,000
Zou Mian is there!

361
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,440
He really snuck into East Capital.

362
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,400
Whether he came or not,

363
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,320
what does that have to do with you?

364
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,280
Of course it has everything to do with me.

365
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,760
If he didn't come,

366
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,550
all my careful planning before

367
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:17,590
would've been for nothing.

368
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,710
From the Mei's Boat case

369
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:21,960
to the Hat Demon case,

370
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,230
to the Imperial Exam case

371
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:24,470
and the Fan Tower case...

372
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:26,350
Wen Yue,

373
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,080
haven't you always been with me throughout?

374
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,280
I planned the Mei's Boat case,

375
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,710
intentionally leaking Zou's plan to present an auspicious sign

376
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,200
to his enemies.

377
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:36,760
The auspicious sign turned into a bad omen,

378
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,880
giving the old scoundrel a warning.

379
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,840
In the Hat Demon case,

380
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,790
my aim was to strike at Zou's monopoly

381
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,910
over the property brokers in East Capital.

382
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,320
In the Imperial Exam case,

383
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:49,590
I sought to expose Zou's network

384
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,280
of corruption in the exams.

385
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:52,760
In the Fan Tower case,

386
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,590
I wanted to completely destroyed

387
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:57,200
Zou Mian's base for colluding with influential officials in East Capital,

retrieving evidence of collusion among these corrupt officials,

390
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,200
tearing apart Zou Mian's network in East Capital,

391
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,910
one at a time.

[Wen's Umbrella Shop, submit in 25 days]

393
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,640
These accomplices of the old scoundrel deserve their fate.

394
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,310
I want to ruin their reputations,

395
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,590
make them experience the pain of losing their families

396
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,280
their power,

397
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,350

[True Identity]
and taste the fear of despair!

399
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,880
From the beginning of my plan...

400
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,680
This is the bounty.

401
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,000
I deliberately sent bounties to you,

402
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:25,830
so you wouldn't miss

403
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:28,680
the grand scheme I painstakingly laid out.

404
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,190
So, it was you.

405
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,400
You're the one who sent me the bounties.

406
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:35,920
And Chi Liaoliao

407
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,310
is nothing but your puppet.

408
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,280
That's right.

409
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,000
But she should thank me.

410
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:44,000
Her entire family was slaughtered by the Zou family,

411
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,430
leaving no trace of their remains.

412
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,680
I gave her the chance for revenge.

413
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,590
We need revenge too.

414
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,190
Wen Yue,

415
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,590
our family's tragedy

416
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,920
wasn't caused by mere bandits.

417
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,710
The real culprit behind our parents' deaths

418
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,070
is that old scoundrel,

419
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,680
Zou Mian.

420
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,160
Back then,

Father discovered

422
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,760
Zou Mian had messed with the ship blueprints,

423
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,800
converting warships

424
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,520
into stone transport ships for personal gain.

425
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,880
Because of this,

426
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:16,950
Zou Mian

427
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,040
sent people

428
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,190
to kill our entire family.

429
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,160
How do you know this?

430
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,950
Not only do I know,

431
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,680
but Buyou does too.

432
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,000
I sent you bounties

433
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:31,430
to lead you step by step to the Zou family

434
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,520
to uncover the truth.

435
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:33,830
But Buyou

436
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,920
has deliberately hidden it all along,

437
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,280
blocking the truth.

438
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,560
Wen Yue,

439
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,350
shouldn't you ask him yourself

440
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,760
why he did this?

441
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:07,880
Father.

442
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,110
You're finally awake.

443
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,470
Have I been sleeping the whole day?

444
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,040
That's right.

445
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,760
No one could wake you up.

446
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,880
Where is everyone?

447
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,520
They all went out.

448
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,800
My head hurts.

449
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,520
Hurts?

450
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,000
Alright,

451
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,070
here,

452
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,040
I've prepared for you

to cure hangovers.

456
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,830
Will it work?

457
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:44,840
Will it work?

458
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,350

459
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,350
that I've also got

460

Father,

466
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,470
don't tell me you drank that formula

467
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,680
and made me.

468
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,000
Such disrespect!

469
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,350
There's food left on the stove for you.

472
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,160
I'll tell you this.

473
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,880
There are newcomers at Xianhe Residence,

474
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,190
and someone invited me over.

475
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,280
Take care, Father.

476
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,430

What are you after?

491
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,950
Didn't the notes in Dong Qian's journal and secret letters

492
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,920
make it clear?

493
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,830
Wen Yue, Dong Qian

and the Zou family

495

496
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,330
I don't know what you're talking about!

497

No need to be nervous.

498
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,350
No need to deny it either.

There's no one else here.

500
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:50,800
Why don't we talk about

501
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,950
where you put Dong Qian's journal?

502
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I don't know what journal you're talking about.

503
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,830
There is no journal at all!

504
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,920
Then I assume

505
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,640
your younger siblings don't know

506
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:02,640
they're Dong Qian's children either.

507
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,430
You're talking nonsense.

508
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,040
Zhao Buyou,

509
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,160
you don't dare avenge your family

510
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,350
and you hide the truth from them.

511
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:10,640
What gives you the right to make decisions for them?

512
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,890
It's not your place to judge me!

513
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:18,230
What am I supposed to tell them?

514
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,800
My wife raised my younger siblings with her own hands,

515
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,990
and now should I tell her

516
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,920

517
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,630

519
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,080
He's her sworn enemy!

520
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,270
Is that what I should say to her?

521
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:38,870
Who are you?

522
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,990
What exactly do you want?

523
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,320
Dear.

524
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,280
It's me.

525
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,440
I want to hear you say it yourself.

526
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,270
Wen Yue,

527
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,870
I've completed the task you gave me.

528
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:14,840
So, I'll take my leave now.

529
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,630
Thank you.

530
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:46,840
Buyou!

531
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,480
Zhao Mo!

532
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,230
Buyou!

Buyou!

534
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:50,150

Mo!

536
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,320
What you just said... Was it all true?

537

Ban, Mo...

538
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,630
Why are you here?

00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,680
Zhao Mo!

540
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,080
Mo!

541
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,200

542
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,800
Zhao Mo!

543
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:14,080
Zhao Mo!

544
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,200
Zhao Mo!

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,270
Zhao Mo!

546
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,480
Zhao Mo!

547
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:25,870
At a time like this,

548
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:27,800
can't you stop leaving me behind?

549
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:30,920
Ban,

550
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,350
I want to be alone for a while.

551
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,190
Go home first.

552
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,110
Go home?

553
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,640
You're telling me to go home alone?

554
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,310
If what Buyou said is true,

555
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,710
then both of us are Dong Qian's children.

556
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,040
This is something

557
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,400
we need to face together.

558
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,470
Ban,

559
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,070
do you know?

560
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:55,070
Ever since I joined the Office of Justice,

561
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:57,470
I've been reading

562
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,040
Dong Qian's case files almost every day.

563
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,190
In my mind,

564
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,280
he's incredible!

565
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,640
I've always hoped that one day

566
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,310
I could become someone like him.

567
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:09,640
But I never imagined

568
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,500
he could do something like this.

569
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,590
He murdered Wen Yue's parents.

570
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,560
Wen Yue raised us,

571
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,560
but we're his children!

572
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:20,190
What's even more pathetic

573
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:22,430
is that I used to look up to him as my role model.

574
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,680
Then let's go home together

575
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,280
and let's apologize to Wen Yue together!

576
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:29,590
That was a massacre!

577
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,710
Why does she have to forgive us?

578
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,040
Ban!

579
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:44,760
Mo!

580
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,430
You sent Mo and Ban

581
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:51,950
to the water stage, didn't you?

582
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,110
Wen Yue,

583
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,680
tonight

584
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,280
they aren't ready to face you.

585
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:02,070
I still want to take you to visit a place.

586
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:08,280
Ban,

587
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,310
this is something

588
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,470
I need time to process.

589
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,680
Zhao Mo,

590
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:26,280
from now on, I'll stop going against you.

591
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:28,800
Whatever you want me to change, I'll listen to you!

592
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,000
Mo,

593
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,680
I don't want to go home alone!

594
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,280
I don't know how to face Wen Yue!

595
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:43,590
Mr. Zhao?

596
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,310
Where have you been this late at night?

597
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,230
You're soaking wet!

598
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,920
Mo,

599
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:54,190
can you stop ignoring me?

600
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,710
You're making me so worried.

601
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,070
Why are you looking for me so late?

602
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:15,070
What happened?

603
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,230
...my siblings' biological father

604
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,070
is Dong Qian...

605
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:48,190
He's her sworn enemy!

606
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:51,520
That was a massacre!

607
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:53,830
Why does she have to forgive us?

608
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,640
Have some tea.

609
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,500
I added something to calm your nerves

610
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,400
and warm you up.

611
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:32,800
Dear!

612
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,330
Wen Yue!

613
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,580
Wen Yue!

614
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,830
In this life,

615
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,590
having your own goals is a good thing.

616
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,230
I support you.

617
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,950
I'll spend my life with you.

618
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:50,000
I'll never leave you.

619
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,560
Let it out and cry if you want.

620
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,230
You'll feel better if you cry.

621
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:11,880
It's okay, Ban.

622
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,520
No matter what we face,

623
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,710
we'll always find a way through.

624
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:20,350
Yes...

625
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,400
There's always a way through...

626
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,560
There's always a way through...

627
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,070
This will all pass...

628
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:33,520
It'll all pass.

629
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:15,350
You ungrateful child!

630
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:17,520
You still remember this home, do you?

631
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,400
At this late hour,

632
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:23,350
I wanted some hot soup noodles,

633
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,680
and no one's here to make them.

634
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,190
In such heavy rain,

635
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,830
why are you the only one back?

636
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,560
Where's Wen Yue?

637
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:31,950
Where's Ban?

638
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,400
Where's Mo?

639
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:35,100
Where is everyone?

640
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,160
Father,

641
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,590
I'll go make you some food.

642
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,070
Go ahead.

643
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,680
None of them are coming back.

644
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,470
This family is falling apart.

645
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,070
Father,

646
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,520
I'm really tired today.

647
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:08,640
I won't cook for now.

648
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,040
Did you eat anything then?

649
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:22,710
It's been years since I last cooked.

650
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:25,160
I wonder if it still tastes the same.

651
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,560
Father,

652
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:33,280
you always said this family was falling apart.

653
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,430
I never thought it would actually happen.

654
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:39,230
Back then,

655
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,000
when you brought those two kids home,

656
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,470
I disagreed.

657
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,400
You sat there in silence all night.

658
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,710
I told you

659
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,560
that you had to properly

660
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,160
deal with those two burdens.

661
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:56,400
I didn't expect

662
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,520
that you took them out of the city

663
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,590
and brought them back home.

664
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,680
Later on,

665
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,710
you looked for several families,

666
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,120
but none were willing to take them in.

667
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,840
I knew,

668
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,760
deep down, you couldn't let them go.

669
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,910
After all, they were two

670
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,280
living, breathing lives.

671
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:22,000
So,

672
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,600
I came up with an idea.

673
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:24,950
Why not leave these kids

674
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,150
to me?

675
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,190
Zhao Li,

676
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,760
you scoundrel!

677
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,120
Back then, what sweet words did you use to coax me?

678
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,040
I must have been out of my mind

679
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,630
to leave these kids behind for you!

680
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,710
Don't lay a hand on me now!

681
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,800
Everyone, look closely!

682
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,360
From today onward,

683
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:54,080
these two kids...

684
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:56,630
Will take the Zhao surname.

685
00:34:59,120 --> 00:34:59,910
Father,

686
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,870
that event really made you suffer unfairly.

687
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,870
Suffer?

688
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:07,950
I actually think

689
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:10,870
you were the one who suffered.

690
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,630
My tarnished reputation

691
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:17,390
doesn't matter.

692
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,670
But how could we support these two kids?

693
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,390
I never expected it,

694
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:25,190
Buyou,

695
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,760
but you pulled it off.

696
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,080
Through all the mess

697
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,800
and hardship,

698
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,320
you really raised them.

699
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:40,670
Later,

700
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:45,230
when Wen Yue married into our family,

701
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,840
she put in so much effort to manage everything.

702
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:50,150
Our days were tough.

703
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:53,000
The five of us

704
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:57,800
shared just this pot of soup noodles.

705
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:05,760
Mo and Ban were especially sensible.

706
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,320
They fought over the soup,

707
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,760
pushing the noodles

708
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,120
into my bowl.

709
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,470
This meat is for you.

710
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,150
Go ahead, you all.

711
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,280
But...

712
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:24,600
I couldn't swallow

713
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,760
those noodles...

714
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,520
Let's not talk about this anymore.

715
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:35,080
I just feel like...

716
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:37,430
I've let Ban down,

717
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:39,710
I've let Mo down,

718
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,800
and I've let my wife down, too.

719
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:44,710
Nonsense.

720
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,600
You raised those two kids well,

721
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,000
better than I did.

722
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:57,910
You've done your duty.

723
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,390
In this family,

724
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,800
you haven't let anyone down.

725
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:06,180
In truth,

726
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,240
sibling quarrels

727
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:12,240
never last overnight.

728
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,280
Listen to me,

729
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:14,950
eat your fill

730
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,910
and get a good night's sleep.

731
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:19,080
I'll go with you to find them tomorrow.

732
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,950
To be honest,

733
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,520
I keep bringing up

734
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,430
how this family

735
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,870
might fall apart.

736
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,080
But deep down, I'm truly afraid

737
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,470
that it really will.

738
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,520
If the two kids

739
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,870
ever find out the truth about their identities,

740
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:50,800
won't this family

741
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,560
really fall apart?

742
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,870
And besides, you don't even have a child of your own.

743
00:37:58,910 --> 00:37:59,760
Buyou,

744
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:03,870
I'm getting old.

745
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,100
How many more times can I make soup noodles for you?

746
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,840
Father, I'm full.

747
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:02,820
Father.

748
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,560
When did Mo come home?

749
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:08,280
And how did he end up going out with Ban?

750
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,390
I saw

751
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:13,630
Mo come back with that young man surnamed He.

752
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,840
He whispered a few words

753
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:17,670
into Ban's ear,

754
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:19,560
and then they went out together.

755
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:40,000
[He Residence]

756
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,150
This is my residence.

757
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,600
Yes.

758
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,500
Someone as capable as you,

759
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,560
how could you not have a place to stay?

760
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,430
Why endure living in our small house?

761
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:53,040
Wen Yue,

762
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:54,280
please follow me.

763
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,280
I want to show you something.

764
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:02,560
Look at this pavilion.

765
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,600
Does it look familiar?

766
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:06,430
I rebuilt it exactly like the one

767
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:08,040
from our old home by Taihu Lake.

768
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:12,190
Do you remember that night?

769
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:15,470
I narrowly escaped with my life.

770
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,320
From then on,

771
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,040
I had to live on my own,

772
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,120
scraping by in this world.

773
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,040
For over twenty years,

774
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,230
aside from seeking revenge,

775
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,950
my biggest hope

776
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,970
was to see you again.

777
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:39,580
But when I finally saw you again,

778
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:42,600
you already had new siblings

779
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:45,040
and a new family.

780
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:48,320
And I...

781
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,190
I could only stay with this pavilion alone.

782
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,180
Zheng,

783
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,080
you've already reunited with me as you wished.

784
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,460
Why drag Ban and Mo into this

785
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:09,520
to hear those things?

786
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,910
At a time like this,

787
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,430
you're still calling them

788
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:15,150
Mo and Ban so affectionately!

789
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,150
Have you ever considered

790
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:17,390
how I, your real brother, feel about this?

791
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,950
Yes, I did it on purpose.

792
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:22,470
Am I wrong to treat our enemy's children this way?

793
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,870
And yet, you're here blaming me on their behalf!

794
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:28,560
I can't understand it.

795
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,670
I can't make sense of you.

796
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:32,040
You say

797
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,430
the Zhao family gave you hope for a new life.

798
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:35,330
But that hope

799
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:36,840
was built on lies!

800
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,670
That's not your real family.

801
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:43,470
If you can't bear to tear it apart,

802
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,190
then I'll have to.

803
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,420
Su Zheng,

804
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,280
the grudges of the previous generation

805
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,320
should not be borne by Ban and Mo.

806
00:41:58,230 --> 00:41:59,430
The dead take their debts with them.

807
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:02,760
If we exact vengeance on the innocent,

808
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:07,120
our hearts will be just as ruthless

809
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:09,060
as those evildoers.

810
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:16,300
Wen Yue,

811
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:19,950
now you're accusing me of being ruthless?

812
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:27,600
Everything I've worked so hard for

813
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:30,470
is to clear the Su family's name

814
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:34,360
and seek justice for our wrongfully slain parents.

815
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:36,120
Wen Yue,

816
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:37,760
if you think I'm wrong,

817
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:40,840
then kill me now!

818
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:43,000
That way,

819
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:45,430
the one sending the bounties will disappear for good.

820
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:48,190
You'll have no more worries

821
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,670
and can return to the Zhao family...

822
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:55,950
to live out the rest of your days as if nothing happened.

[An In-Depth Look at Welfare Systems in Northern Song. Narrator: Lin Jiachuan]

826
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,840
Did you know the Song Dynasty made efforts

827
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,950
in social welfare?

828
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,320
In the drama, the welfare center where He Huan works

829
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:15,080
was a government-run institution

830
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,190
providing aid for childbirth for the poor

831
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:19,470
and taking in abandoned infants and orphans.

832
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,600
Not only that,

833
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,150
in the booming real estate market of the Song Dynasty,

834
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:25,120
low-rent housing also emerged.

835
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,470
The central government even regulated

836

housing prices several times,
