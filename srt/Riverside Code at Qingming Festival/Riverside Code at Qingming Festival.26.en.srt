People from all over the world gather here,

What's going on?

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,910
Can they hear us?

00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:04,590
No.

29
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,160
But since they haven't come down for so long,

30
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,830
they might be getting suspicious.

31

00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,190
Are they running away?

34
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,670
I knew it. It was a trap.

35
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,670

I'm so itchy.

39
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:32,320
Sit tight.

00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:33,960

00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,800

Never see each other again!

00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,880
I'm wronged!

65

66
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,360
don't listen to these untrustworthy people's

Not only did I end up here,

72
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:50,960
but I was also falsely accused of corruption!

Dear,

77
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,550
you've overplayed this drama!

78
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,630
Zhao Buyou,

79
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,630
do you have any evidence

80
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,550
for what you just said?

00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,000
If not,

82
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,600
I won't allow you to act like this!

83
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,320
Reporting to you, my lord,

84
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,240

85
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,070
Fine.

86
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,160
Bring him to Kaifeng Court for trial another day.

87
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,830
Why can't we try him here?

88
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,040
Let's just try him here!

89
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,000
Exactly!

90
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,110
Let's just try him here!

91
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,350
Bring the witness up!

92
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,270
Bring up the witness!

93
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,320

94
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:45,230

96
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,200
The Imperial Guard Department is here to take Zou away!

00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,640
Zou Mian!

98
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,920
I also want to cut him into pieces,

99
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,040
but we should bring him to justice

100
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,880
and make his crimes known to all,

101
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,000
so the people of the East Capital will know his true face!

102
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:08,920
Make it known to all

103
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,200
and bring him to justice.

104
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,160
Yes.

105
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,350
Me too,

106
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,920
but I can't do that.

107
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,510
Offer Mr. Zou a seat!

108
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,230
What should we do?

109
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,200
It seems that the Imperial Guard Department has been bribed.

110
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,200

We're ordered by our superior

117
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,200
to take Mr. Zou back!

118
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,440
Get lost!

119
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,760
My lord,

120
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,160
may I question the witness?

121
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:14,600
Granted.

122
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,550
Witness,

123
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:18,920
do you confess your guilt?

124
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,720
I...

125
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,440
I confess.

126
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,390
The Governor is right in front of you.

127
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,830
Tell him the truth

128
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,070
of what you know.

129
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,720
Try to get a lighter punishment.

130
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:31,950
My name

131
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:33,760
is Zheng Dun.

132
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,200
For nearly a decade,

133
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,320
I've been instructed by the Zou family

134
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,550
to secretly find substitute scholars

135
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,440
for the Zou family's children

136
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,880
and kill them afterward

137
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,320
to silence them

138
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,950
and avoid future troubles.

139
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,510
But I didn't participate

140
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,390
in the killing.

141
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,790
Zou Mian was the one who instructed it.

142
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,600
Okay.

143
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:58,550
Zheng Dun,

144
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,950
is this Zou Mian you mentioned on the stage?

145
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:07,550
Master!

146
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,640
I didn't know you were here.

147
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,880
I really didn't know you were here.

148
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,160
Our Zou family

149
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,000
is a scholarly family that has produced many talents.

150
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,720
But now we're being slandered by this scoundrel.

151
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,320
My lord,

152
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,790
please be discerning!

153
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,070
Get out of the way!

154
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,350
We're all on the same side, no need to draw weapons!

155
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,440
Master, please give me another chance!

156
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,350
I don't want to die...

157
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,270
I really don't want to die...

158
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:35,720
I don't want to die...

159
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,320
Zheng Dun!

160
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:36,760
I don't want to die...

161
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:38,230
Here.

162
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,950
Was what you just said true?

163
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,040
They... they forced me to do it!

164
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,670
They forced me to do it!

165
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,270
They forced me to do it!

166
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,640
Why is his testimony inconsistent?

167
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,320
They forced me...

168
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,390
Yeah. Why is it inconsistent?

169
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,760
...to frame the Zou family.

170
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,920
The Zou family has nothing

171
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,720
to do with this!

172
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,350
Nothing at all!

173
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:26,950
Zhao Buyou,

174
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,670
the witness has retracted his confession,

175
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,000
which means the testimony needs further verification.

176
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,320
If you don't have any new evidence,

177
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,000
I'll end this drama

178
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,230
here today.

179
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,110
Wait!

180
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,200
My lord,

181
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:42,640
I still have physical evidence.

182
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:43,910
Present the physical evidence!

183
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,440
Father, sit down.

184
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,320
Be patient.

185
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,280
What is this?

186
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,910
Zou Mian,

187
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,080
do you recognize this gown?

188
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,440
How would I recognize it?

189
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:07,400
This is the gown that your daughter Zou Ziyin

190
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,150
was wearing the last time she met you.

191
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,000
She probably didn't expect

192
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,110
that meeting with her father

193
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,080
would be her last.

194
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,150
Zhao Buyou!

195
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,840
Don't slander me.

196
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:20,400
Ziyin

197
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,520
clearly died of the disease in prison.

198
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,520
Is the autopsy report out?

199
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,440
Yes.

200
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,280
My lord,

201
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,760
I'd like to request

202
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,910
that the coroner of Kaifeng Court

203
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,880
announce the cause of Zou Ziyin's death

204
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,840
to the public.

205
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:46,910
Granted.

206
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,960
I'm Coroner Yao He of Kaifeng Court.

207
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:59,840
Zou Ziyin, daughter of Zou Mian

208
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,350
from the Southern Manufacturing Bureau, and her husband Luan Hui

209
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:05,000
didn't die from the disease,

210
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,200
but from poisoning.

211
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,150
And the so-called disease

212
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:12,150
was just a cover-up!

213
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,350
Zou Mian,

214
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,710
to protect yourself,

215
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,960
you even killed your own daughter!

216
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,760
Shut up.

217
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,760
Do you

218
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,470
recognize this?

219
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:26,440
Everyone,

220
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,230
this is a coin.

00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,280
Four characters are engraved on it:

Longevity and Good Health.

224
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,550
When you gave it

225
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,440
to your daughter,

226
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,760
I believe

227
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,030
you were also a father who loved his daughter.

228
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,400
You never expected

229
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,320
that your daughter would die in front of you

230
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,880
wearing this coin.

231
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,790
You have no conscience at all!

232
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,790
Return Ziyin's belongings

233
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,640
to me!

234
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,590
You don't deserve to be a father!

235
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,910
Ziyin...

236
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,580
[Longevity and Good Health]

237
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,440
You beast.

238
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,150
Even a tiger won't eat its cubs.

239
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,790
Are you even human?

240
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:20,760
You're worse than a beast!

241
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,590
No matter how you repent,

242
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,200
your daughter won't hear it.

243
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:25,230
Zou Mian,

244
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,880
you don't deserve to be a father!

245
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,080
Scum!

246
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,080
He's worse than a beast!

247
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,440
You won't escape self-blame

248
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,760
for the rest of your life.

249
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,910
Why should I blame myself?

250
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,590
Ziyin

251
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,550
did commit suicide at my persuasion.

252
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,840
I was upholding justice

253
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,470
for the people

and eliminating a threat for His Majesty!

255
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,790
He's still making excuses!

256
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,960
Over the years,

257
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,230
Ziyin was misled by her husband Luan Hui

258
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,670
to do many harmful things,

259
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:14,710
making me unable to face His Majesty and the people.

260
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:17,280
Their refusal to confess wasn't enough to ease public anger.

261
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,590
Between family and justice,

262
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,320
I chose justice!

you targeted me everywhere!

You're just a mere litigator,

yet you dare to be so arrogant.

00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,350
what are your intentions?

271
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,880
You even dared to stop the Imperial Guard Department!

272
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,840
Are you tired of living?

273
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,280
I'll kill you.

274
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:46,910
Get up!

275
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,310
There's some chaos over there by the stage.

Mr. Li mentioned the Shipbuilder Su Zhi from the Taihu Shipyard.

282

When he was killed,

283
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:37,910
he had a daughter

00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,550

00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,910
Chief Minister of Office of Justice, Dong Qian,

287

00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,740
was my sworn brother's elder brother.

What I did today

292
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,740
is both for personal grudges

293
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,740
and for justice.

294
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,140

00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:12,740
Today,

297
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,430

on behalf of Su Zhi's family, I accuse you

301

of covering up the truth

302

[Taking Justice into His Own Hands]

311

00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,820
on behalf of Sun Bo, I accuse you

00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,870
of pretending to be a ghost

316
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,140
and monopolizing land prices.

00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,990
on behalf of Song Qiyu, I accuse you

00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,310
on behalf of Su and Xie Laoba, I accuse you

323
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,430
of exchanging power for sexual favors

Last but not least,

on behalf of all the people in the world, I accuse you

00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,140
of faking auspicious signs,

00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,580
over this official!

daring to oppose me.

348
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,580
Ants trying to shake a tree,

349
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:19,940
overestimating themselves.

350
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,350
You're so arrogant.

351
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:25,620
Even if the Great Song Law can't touch you,

352
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,910
aren't you afraid of divine retribution?

353
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,030
Divine retribution?

354
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:30,990
Who is the divine being?

355
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,940
The Emperor is the divine being!

356
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,620
A few lowly lives,

357
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,110
what's the big deal?

358
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:40,910
Now,

359
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,820
the rare stone has reached the palace.

360
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,380
This piece of heaven

361
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:45,910
is now

362
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:50,380
shielding and protecting this official!

363
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,820
Seeing this sleeve

364
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,650
is like seeing the Emperor himself.

365
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:09,340
You still don't kneel?

366
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,650
I've heard of this. It's true.

367
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:14,220
Why should we kneel to him?

368
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:14,890
I won't kneel!

369
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:16,890
It's like seeing the Emperor in person.

370
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,220
Kneel!

371
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,250
Back then,

372
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:31,060
when my father passed this job on to me,

373
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,740
he made sure I remembered:

374
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,250
never be the first to handle a case.

375
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:36,220
Because this can save my life.

376
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:39,860
Avoid taking responsibility

377
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:41,890
and learn to take advantage of situations.

378
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,890
Just be content with a little wealth.

379
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,370
Until that year,

380
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:48,860
you are here.

381
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,740
I, Wan Fu,

382
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,830
finally knew what I should do.

383
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,620
I should

384
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,100
protect Inspector Gu

385
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,190
and make him

386
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,140
feel at ease,

387
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,500
so he can focus

388
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,620
on what he has to do

389
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,620
and what he wants to do.

390
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,100
You scoundrels!

391
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,140
Do you all intend

392
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,500
to defy the Emperor?

393
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,710
Shut up!

394
00:18:59,030 --> 00:18:59,790
Who is it?

395
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,430
Why you again?

396
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,380
Zou Mian, you wretch!

397
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,740
Mencius once said,

398
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,140
"The people are the most important,

399
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,980
the state is second,

400
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,860
and the ruler is the least."

401
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,830
As a royal official,

402
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,500
how dare you act recklessly

403
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,740
and take lives unjustly!

404
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,100
Do you realize

405
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,910
even the Emperor fears the heavens?

406
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,030
What are the heavens?

407
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,670
The heavens are the Emperor's people!

408
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:28,830
Exactly!

409
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,070
The very people

410
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,860
you scorn as mere ants,

411
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:35,740
the countless masses!

412
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,460
No matter how misguided the Emperor may be,

413
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,950
he deeply understands this truth.

414
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,100
Even if

415
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,910
he were here today,

416
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,950
He wouldn't forgive you at all.

417
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,620
Do you confess your crimes?

418
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,430
Do you confess your crimes?

419
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,500
Do you confess your crimes?

420
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,830
Corrupt official!

421
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:56,740
Do you confess your crimes?

422
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,670
The heavens of the Great Song

423
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,140
belong to no one,

424
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,260
and they certainly don't belong to you, Zou Mian!

425
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:07,070
The realm of the Great Song

426
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:10,030
is built by countless small families.

427
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,910
The so-called lowly commoners

428
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:15,830
[Litigation]
are living, breathing individuals like us!

429
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,500
Yesterday,

430
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,500
under your oppression,

431
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:22,740
the Su family,

432
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,790
the Dong family,

433
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:24,740
and the Li family,

434
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,590
three small families,

435
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,380
were torn apart

436
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:29,860
and destroyed!

437
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,070
Tomorrow,

438
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,830
it could be my Zhao family,

439
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,310
the Wang family,

440
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,100
the Song family,

441
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,380
or the Sun family,

442
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:40,860
[Litigation]
all of us together!

443
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,140
Under your tyranny,

444
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:45,950
I ask,

445
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:48,220
[Litigation]
who could escape harm?

446
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,500
When one family or household is unsafe,

447
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,460
how can the Great Song

448
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,310
find peace?

449
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,790
Well said!

450
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:00,620
Well said!

451
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,220
[Litigation]

452
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:02,860
Well said!

453
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:04,070
Yes!

454
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:06,380
Well said!

455
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,220
Today, I, Zhao Buyou,

456
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,380
as a litigator,

457
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,950
will sue you in this temporary court

458
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,550
of Kaifeng Court.

459
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,950
[Litigation]
You have already confessed.

460
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,550
All the spectators

461
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,950
and all the people

462
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,220
are witnesses.

463
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,030
Everyone,

464
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,620
I, Zhao Buyou,

465
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,100
ask all of you

466
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,190
to be my witnesses.

467
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:35,340
Are you willing?

468
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:39,740
This...

469
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,260
I'm willing!

470
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:44,620
I'm willing!

471
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,030
I'm willing!

472
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:48,790
I'm willing!

473
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:51,140
I'm willing!

474
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,830
[Litigation]
I'm willing!

475
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:56,430
I'm willing!

476
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:57,830
I'm willing!

477
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,030
I'm willing!

478
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:02,980
I'm willing!

479
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:04,710
I'm willing!

480
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,980
This court will accept this case today.

481
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,500
You have to help me.

482
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,980
[Litigation]

483
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:45,670
Zhao Buyou,

484
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,220
do you know

485
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,550
what a serious crime it is

486
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:51,070
to falsely accuse

487
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,950
a court official?

488
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,500
Yes, I do.

489
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:57,380
Do you dare to take responsibility for what happened today?

490
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:27,260
Yes!

491
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,220
Good!

492
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,590
Someone!

493
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,020
[Litigation]

494
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,950
According to the Great Song Law,

495
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:39,310
take the criminal

496
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:41,910
Zou Mian

497
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,950
into custody at Kaifeng Court!

498
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:44,590
Yes, sir!

499
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,590
Great!

500
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,590
You guys...

501
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,670
Great!

502
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:54,950
Great!

503
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,100
Public trial!

Zou Mian pleads guilty!

507
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,140
Public trial!

[Litigation]

510
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,460
Great!

511
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,070
Let's go

512
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,460
and welcome Buyou back.

513
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,430
Let's go!

514
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:44,420
[Litigation]

515
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,460
Is the trial over?

516
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,260
Are you alright?

517
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,950
You made it.

518
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:43,830
I made it.

519
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,950
I knew you could make it.

520
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:51,190
I knew you could.

521
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,430
It's all thanks to you.

522
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:58,260
Gu Zhen!

523
00:25:58,670 --> 00:25:59,380
Gu Zhen!

524
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:09,790
You planned this with him beforehand

525
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,260
and kept me in the dark?

526
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,830
Gu Zhen,

527
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,910
can't you see

528
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,980
that I did all this for you?

529
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:17,710
Wan Fu!

530
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:19,830
Here.

531
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:38,590
Let's go home.

532
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:40,710
Let's go.

533
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:42,430
Let's go.

534
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:46,910
Zhao Buyou...

535
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,550
Look, the sky...

536
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,590
is about to light up.

537
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,620
With the lamp of my heart...

538
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:00,340
I'll light his way

539
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:04,250
through the cold, long night.

540
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:16,170
Buyou!

541
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,410
Buyou!

542
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:18,940
Buyou!

543
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,740
You're amazing!

544
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,170
Buyou, thank you.

545
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,410
You look much more pleasing to the eye today.

546
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:26,620
I didn't expect you to settle

547
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:28,130
this big issue for our family.

548
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:28,940
Well,

549
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,010
I didn't expect it to work at first,

550
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:32,410
but I tried my best!

551
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:33,220
How did you do it?

552
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,010
Speaking of which...

553
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:38,060
Count me in!

554
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,220
Father...

555
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,250
It's all thanks to Father.

556
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:41,890
And

557
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:43,620
thanks to the help of our neighbors.

558
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,410
Litigator Zhao!

559
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:47,410
Wen Yue,

560
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:48,650
What a pity you missed it.

561
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:49,530
Let me tell you,

562
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:51,100
he scolded that corrupt official

563
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,370
so badly,

564
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:53,290
That corrupt official like this...

565
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:01,580
Although you're a great litigator now,

566
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,010
you still have to listen to me

567
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:04,740
about family matters.

568
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,490
Right?

569
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,290
I always do!

570
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:09,100
I have every right to say this.

571
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:09,700
Right, Ban?

572
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,010
If it weren't for me...

573
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,250
Exactly.

574
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:13,980
If it weren't for Wen Yue,

575
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,580
you would have been dead by now.

576
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,290
Our family

577
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:19,290
is finally safe.

578
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,060
Father, we've always been safe!

579
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,530
We're safe, Father.

580
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:23,490
Don't worry!

581
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:25,010
Yao He, come here!

582
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:32,370
[Litigation]

583
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:33,220
He's back!

584
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,460
Buyou is back!

585
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,530
Our hero!

586
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,100
[Litigation]

587
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:44,980
He is back!

588
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:46,940
He's back!

589
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,170
He's finally back!

590
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:51,170
[Litigation]
My heart's about to burst out of my chest!

591
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:54,580
My dear neighbors,

592
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:56,530
in today's battle,

593
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:57,650
Zou Mian was brought to justice

594
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,130
thanks to all of you.

595
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:00,580
Thank you!

596
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,010
[Litigation]

597
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:07,250
Peerless Litigator!

598
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:07,860
Let's go.

599
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,770
Peerless Litigator!

600
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:13,820
Thank you for today.

601
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,620
That was truly satisfying.

602
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,770
Truly satisfying.

603
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,740
We scared that corrupt official so much

604
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:27,220
that he was shaking all over

605
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,340
and didn't even dare to make a sound!

606
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:32,220
When it comes to the biggest credit,

607
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,580
it's got to be you, Zhao Buyou.

608
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,460
Of course.

609
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,740
The Peerless Litigator of the East Capital.

610
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,060
I'm truly convinced!

611
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:39,250
I admire you.

612
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:41,860
The guards on the ship were so tight.

613
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,490
How did you catch Zou Mian?

614
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,220
Speaking of this,

615
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,290
it was pure luck.

616
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,890
Thanks to Father.

617
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,250
He looks like him.

618
00:30:58,740 --> 00:30:59,740
Really looks like him.

619
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,740
Exactly the same as the portrait

620
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,100
of His Majesty that I saw.

621
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:06,290
Well,

622
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:08,460
His Majesty also scratches like this?

623
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:13,490
From tomorrow on,

624
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:15,060
I'll write about you two

625
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,620
in my book.

626
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:17,940
Good!

627
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:18,860
Will I be

628
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,250
in the book?

629
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:20,770
Yes.

630
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:21,370
I have to be in it.

631
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:23,340
You'll all be in it.

632
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:24,250
We'll all be in it.

633
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,100
Enough.

634
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,530
Buyou has been tired all day.

635
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:27,370
Let's not disturb him any further.

636
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,290
Let's head home.

637
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:28,860
That's right.

638
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:29,410
No worries.

639
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:30,060
We're leaving now.

640
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:31,290
- Stay a bit longer. - No worries.

641
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:32,530
We're leaving now.

642
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:33,980
Thank you.

643
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:34,620
See you again.

644
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,250
Thank you.

645
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,580
Tell it to me.

646
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,220
I'll tell you next time.

647
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:37,890
Next time, right?

648
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:38,340
Next time.

649
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,010
Okay.

650
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,130
Goodbye.

651
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,460
- Everyone - Take care.

652
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,410
- See you again! - Take care.

653
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:43,370
See you again!

654
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,620
Enough, Father.

655
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,580
Stop acting.

656
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:47,740
Let's go back.

657
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,130
No.

658
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:48,890
Let's change clothes.

659
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:49,740
No need to change.

660
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:50,410
Enough acting.

661
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:51,010
Time for bed, Father!

662
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:51,580
Enough acting.

663
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:53,060
Enough acting!

664
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,010
Buyou, how about my clothes?

665
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:54,460
They're good.

666
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:54,860
Do they fit?

667
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:55,410
They fit.

668
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:56,620
Come on.

669
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,620
Dear,

670
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:12,100
from now on,

671
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:14,890
you don't have to worry anymore.

672
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:16,410
What you said about your family

673
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:17,980
is actually true?

674
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,740
It's always been true.

675
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,170
Just no one believed it.

676
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:44,460
Good morning, dear!

677
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,460
Morning.

678
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:46,650
Dear,

679
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:48,620
I'll take Zhao Mo with me

680
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:49,770
to the litigation booth later.

681
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:50,860
Today,

682
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:51,490
after we get there,

683
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:52,980
we'll also put up the "Peerless Litigator" sign

684
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,490
that His Majesty

685
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:55,370
personally inscribed.

686
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:56,370
You have no idea

687
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:57,530
how many people

688
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:59,100
were there yesterday.

689
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,170
Business is booming.

690
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:02,580
As it happens,

691
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,650
I just got a big order

692
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,130
from the Consort's Residence.

693
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,340
After I finish the order,

694
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:10,490
let's go to the property agent.

695
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:12,580
Okay.

696
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:15,100
Then we'll be able to buy a house soon.

697
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,700
Any news about Zheng?

698
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:25,740
Not yet.

699
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,860
But Inspector Gu said

700
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,410
that someone saw Zheng.

701
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,100
He should be alive.

702
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:31,940
Don't worry.

703
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,700
I'll watch it and update you if there's news.

704
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:39,860
Zhao Mo, come help me!

705
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:40,620
Okay.

706
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,290
Coming.

707
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,370
Good morning, Wen Yue.

708
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:43,820
Morning.

709
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:44,650
Wen Yue.

710
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:45,250
Morning.

711
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,370
Father,

712
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:47,700
breakfast is ready.

713
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,740
Can we eat now?

714
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:54,060
Yes.

715
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,290
Dear,

716
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:57,340
you made all my favorite food

717
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,770
for breakfast.

718
00:33:59,010 --> 00:33:59,820
Thank you.

719
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:05,980
Why are you two still holding hands while eating?

720
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,420
What's wrong with it?

721
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:10,930
Haven't you heard

722
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,690
that brief separations enhance love?

723
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:14,580
Wen Yue and I

724
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,730
even hold hands while sleeping.

725
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:19,860
Right?

726
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:25,420
Buyou, please stop.

727
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,660
Wen Yue has had enough.

728
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:29,290
Buyou,

729
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:30,900
the medicine I gave you

730
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:32,620
worked.

731
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:33,970
What?

732
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:46,180
Come on. Be careful.

733
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,450
That's so exaggerated!

734
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:49,860
Ban.

735
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:52,580
Ban,

736
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:54,900
this was my own decision.

737
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:55,930
It has nothing to do with my Father.

738
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:57,490
Yao He.

739
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,140
Wen... Wen Yue.

740
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,010
You're looking for Ban, right?

741
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,340
You two talk.

742
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:05,450
Wen Yue,

743
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:08,490
an elder must be present for this.

744
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:11,900
Okay.

745
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,210
Then I'll stay here.

746
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,490
Speak up.

747
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:16,900
Ban,

748
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,690
I want to...

749
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,930
When trying Zou Mian at the market

750
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:24,690
in front of so many people,

751
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:25,930
weren't you a good speaker?

752
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:27,660
Why do you get tongue-tied

753
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,010
when you see Ban?

754
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:30,620
I...

755
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:32,380
Today is a happy day for my family.

756
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:34,180
I'm going to be an aunt. I'm so happy.

757
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,140
So,

758
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,420
no matter what you say today,

759
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:41,060
I... I'll agree to it.

760
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:42,420
I...

761
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:46,420
I want to wish Wen Yue a healthy baby.

762
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,690
And congrats, you're an aunt now.

763
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:57,620
I'm going all out.

764
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:03,530
Ban.

765
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:09,180
[Marriage Proposal]

766
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,250
Lady Wen,

767
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:21,820
congratulations.

768
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,730
You're pregnant.

769
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,620
