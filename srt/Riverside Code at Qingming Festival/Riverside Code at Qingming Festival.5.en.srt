A life of happiness, huh?

194
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,320
That's very resolute.

195
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:04,600
This

196
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,720
doesn't look like what he will do.

197
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,640
What did you do with him

198
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,640
except buying the white horse?

199
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:12,760
Come over here.

200
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:13,790
Ban'er.

201
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,550
Where have you been?

202
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,880
And what did Buyou say to you?

203
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,350
He said, don't hesitate,

204
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,230
and leave the city right away.

205
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:25,790
There's nothing else?

206
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,550
Zhao Buyou.

207
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,440
We expected you to come

208
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,590
work at the Kaifeng Court.

209
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:40,320
But you didn't show up.

210
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,400
Why did you run off to this place?

211
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,350
Inspector Gu, Judge Wan, please sit.

212
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,440
I want to buy you some tea.

213
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,030
What's the matter?

214
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,670
Here's the thing.

215
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,790
I lost my job a few days ago.

216
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,230
I was afraid my wife would find out.

217
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,910
So I was anxious

218
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,590
to find a job at Kaifeng Court.

219
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,550
Let's just wait another day.

220
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,880
I'm not in a hurry now.

221
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,030
That's not up to you.

222
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:09,710
Continue.

223
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,110
I came here today...

224
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,640
Just tell us already.

225
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:20,280
Inspector Gu.

226
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:25,760
Back then when Bao Zheng resides at Kaifeng Court.

227
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,320
Wait a second.

228
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:28,350
Who's that again?

229
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,640
I said Bao Zheng.

230
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,200
Why did you bring that up?

231
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,280
When he was in charge,

232
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,470
Anyone could file a lawsuit in court.

233
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,000
All grievance must be avenged,

234
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,550
and all evil must be eliminated.

235
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,470
May I ask, Inspector Gu,

236
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,880
can we do that in today's Kaifeng Mansion?

237
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,400
Zhao Buyou, listen carefully.

238
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,760
Before we had Bao Zheng.

239
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,590
Now we have Inspector Gu.

240
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,520
In East Capital,

241
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,470
everything is put under our control.

242
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,470
We'll arrest every criminal.

243
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,200
My investigation shows

244
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,110
Li Yan's case fifteen years ago

245
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,550
and the Auspicious Sign today

246
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,790
are the works of the same person.

247
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:18,790
Do you dare to arrest him?

248
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,880
Who's him?

249
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,520
The prosecutor,

250
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,000
Di Lun at the Office of Justice.

251
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,200
Boss.

252
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,910
I knew something's off with this man.

253
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,230
He's been hanging around since the trial opened.

254
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,880
Do you have evidence?

255
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:42,440
I have.

256
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:46,670
I am the witness.

257
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,200
That doesn't count as evidence.

258
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,150
I can guarantee sure it's him.

259
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,000
Your guarantee doesn't mean anything.

260
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,400
You can't prove that man's guilty.

261
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,080
Zhao Buyou, I didn't know you were such a conspicuous man.

262
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,470
You seriously want the Kaifeng Court to go against the Office of Justice?

263
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,110
Is that correct?

264
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,790
A few days ago,

265
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:06,550
you were fired by Mr. Di.

266
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,110
So

267
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,030
you hold a grudge against him.

268
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,710
You plan to pin this on him.

269
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,760
Am I correct?

270
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,640
That's what happened.

271
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,840
And then he just took off.

272
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,880
Try to give it another thought

273
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,280
and see if you have missed something.

274
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,670
Have I missed something?

275
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,200
Oh, right.

276
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,760
He wrote another letter.

277
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,200
He mentioned

278
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,230
an abandoned place in the eastern suburbs.

279
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,150
I don't know what it is.

280
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,470
He seemed to arrange a meeting, but he wouldn't let me know.

281
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,960
The eastern suburbs.

282
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,200
Abandoned?

283
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,760
Wen Yue, where are you going?

284
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,400
Mr. Zhao's getting a divorce!

285
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,320
- Wen Yue, you can ride a horse? - What are you doing?

286
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,110
I knew how to do it when you were still kids.

287
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,320
Wen Yue, you are leaving?

288
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,760
Take care of my Father.

289
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,710
Yue!

290
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,350
You forget about this.

291
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,110
Sir,

292
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,440
our people saw

293
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:18,550
Zhao Buyou was hanging with the Thinduese.

294
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,320
Later, he thought of your name.

295
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,550
He already figured it out

296
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,550
that it was you who ordered the man to make the Auspicious Sign.

297
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:27,960
Rest assured, sir.

298
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,910
The Thinduese is right here.

299
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,520
Alright, take it away.

300
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,790
Clear the room for us.

301
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,230
Turns out I have

302
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,960
underestimated Zhao Buyou.

303
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,350
I didn't know he'd collude with the pirates?

304
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,640
You were smart and resourceful.

305
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,230
You used Rice Noodles with Shredded Chicken

306
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,470
to find out Xiao Yishui wasn't from Meishan.

307
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,110
I missed Rice Noodles with Shredded Chicken in my hometown.

308
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:59,230
Yeah, it was so tasty.

309
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,080
I just don't understand.

310
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:05,110
You already figured out the problem yesterday.

311
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,280
Why don't you capture them at once today?

312
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,520
The Auspicious Sign is very important.

313
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,400
We've been doing this secretly.

314
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,880
A bunch of hooligans wouldn't know

315
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:16,710
there are some treacherous officials behind this whole thing.

316
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,470
You want to know who's behind this?

317
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,520
Yes.

318
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,710
If we don't find out who's behind this,

319
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,640
what am I supposed to tell the higher-ups?

320
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,710
As for Xiao Yishui,

321
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:29,710
keep watch on him.

322
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,080
As for Zhao Buyou and his wife,

323
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,350
go get them.

324
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,150
Everything's set?

325
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,080
Yes, sir.

326
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,350
Tonight, you will be posed

327
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,150
as kidnappers,

328
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,640
and captured Zhao Buyou and his family.

329
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,760
But remember

330
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,110
to keep it low.

331
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,400
Sir.

332
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,790
Why don't we just kill them

333
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:59,670
under the cover of night?

334
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,710
I want them alive

335
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,030
for a reason.

336
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,320
Go get prepared.

337
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:13,910
Report!

338
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:16,400
Mr. Di.

339
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,030
You've got a letter.

340
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,000
The messenger said it was urgent.

341
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,710
Bring two bottles of flowing glow to the abandoned ship graveyard

342
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:30,200
in eastern suburbs at 7 p.m..

343
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:31,710
Zhao Buyou.

344
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,760
What's this man up to, really?

345
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,440
Two bottle of flowing glow.

346
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,440
Go prepare the wine.

347
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:01,840
Yes.

348
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:06,180
[Abandoned ship graveyard, Eastern suburbs]

349
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:16,960
Buyou.

350
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:18,840
Search the area.

351
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:21,910
You got here early.

352
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,000
See what you've done.

353
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,880
We've been working together for over a decade.

354
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,590
Yet you even sent me an invitation just to drink together.

355
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,230
That's too polite.

356
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:45,670
The problem is you invited me here,

357
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,910
yet I'm the one to bring the wine.

358
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,590
No wonder everyone said

359
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:53,080
you are the most frugal man in the Office of Justice.

360
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,590
Let's drink.

361
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,840
You seem odd today.

362
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:09,030
You used to be more obedient.

363
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,000
If you want to say anything, just spit it out.

364
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,550
You were right.

365
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,520
I always thought I'm the biggest loser

366
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,000
in the Office of Justice.

367
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,280
Listen.

368
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,440
For over a decade,

369
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:28,670
I drafted your closing files.

370
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,150
Your household chores,

371
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:33,670
like sweeping fallen leaves in your courtyard,

372
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,280
writing invitation letters,

373
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,670
and escorting your relatives

374
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,670
when they see the doctor,

375
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,320
I was in charge of them all.

376
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:43,350
I thought I was a huge loser,

377
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:47,030
until recently I found out some secrets of yours.

378
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,320
Then I found out

379
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,910
you were the biggest loser among us.

380
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,560
What secrets?

381
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,920
Tell me.

382
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,280
I saw you sucked up to the Chief Minister all the time.

383
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:19,520
It's understandable.

384
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,470
But his wife

385
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,310
is old enough to be your mother.

386
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,070
Why hooked up with her?

387
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,110
You're not doing this to pry into the secrets of

388
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,470
the Office of Justice, right?

389
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,110
Cheers.

390
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,310
Listen, man.

391
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,800
You like to treat the higher-ups to some meals,

392
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,590
and suck up to them.

393
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,350
It's fine.

394
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,830
But last time I was in Sunyang Restaurant.

395
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,280
When I looked inside your booth,

396
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,800
you were dancing there.

397
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,070
You even sang for them.

398
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,800
You were not trying to be an actor, right?

399
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,590
You're a prosecutor, after all.

400
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:59,040
Didn't you feel ashamed?

401
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,710
Cheers again.

402
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,040
Anything else?

403
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:07,280
I heard you also worked for someone

404
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,430
outside the Office of Justice.

405
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,110
They must have your salary deducted all the time.

406
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,920
Otherwise, why would you

407
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,000
try to deduct the salaries

408
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,160
of us subordinates.

409
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,680
It must be hard for you.

410
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:20,000
I bet you hasn't got much from this.

411
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,560
That's all?

412
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,350
That's all for now.

413
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,070
All right, Zhao Buyou.

414
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:58,400
You asked me here in the middle of the night.

415
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:02,000
If that's what you want to talk about,

416
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,070
I'm done with it.

417
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,950
Do you still remember

418
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,310
the ship in front of you?

419
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,110
Fifteen years ago,

420
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,760
Li Yan and his family, along with the crew,

421
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,830
were murdered by some pirates.

422
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,520
You were the one

423
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:25,880
to hire those pirates, right?

424
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,520
Fifteen years later,

425
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,590
you arranged the Auspicious Sign

426
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:31,070
over the Bian River to cause confusion among the people.

427
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,710
The problem is, why would a prosecutor like you

428
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,160
have the guts to do this?

429
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,520
Lately, I've gathered some evidence.

430
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:39,760
Clearly,

431
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,760
there's a really powerful man behind you.

432
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:45,160
He ordered you to do this,

433
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:45,830
right?

434
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,350
Now die!

435
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,680
So I was right.

436
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,710
Unsheathe your sword.

437
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:05,880
A scribe who got fired by his superior

438
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,680
attempts to spread rumors and smear his superior.

439
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,230
This is a felony.

440
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:12,760
Take him away.

441
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,590
Tie him up.

442
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,160
Don't move!

443
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,190
The Office of Treasury is colluding with the Office of Miscellaneous Purchases.

444
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,110
Am I correct?

445
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:26,280
I heard Mr. Di is about to be transferred there.

446
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,000
A fat job at the Office of Treasury.

447
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,560
The man behind you

448
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,830
has promised to help you

449
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,160
transfer to the Office of Treasury, right?

450
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:35,920
Keep dreaming.

451
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,000
That position was taken yesterday.

452
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,470
Really?

453
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,640
You don't believe me?

454
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I have evidence with me.

455
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,800
It's in my pocket.

456
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:50,400
Let me take a look.

457
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,320
The man who took the job yesterday

458
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,400
has ordered some umbrellas

459
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,270
in my wife's shop.

460
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,830
We have his signature.

461
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:00,830
If you don't believe me,

462
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:01,550
go ask around.

463
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:04,430
Someone from the Office of Treasury came looking for you.

464
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,880
He said their newly appointed leader,

465
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,080
Mr. Wei is planning to

466
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,640
buy some umbrellas for the palace.

467
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:10,240
[The Office of Treasury has purchased 50 green umbrellas with 36 guan of gold.]

468
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:10,850
[Wen's Umbrella Shop will deliver the green umbrellas]

469
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:11,390
[to the Office of Treasury in 25 days.]

470
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:11,510
[The goods have been paid for.]

471
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:11,920
[Wei Santong, person in charge in the Office of Treasury]

472
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,680
Di Lun, now you know

473
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:19,190
who's the most pathetic man in the Office of Justice, right?

474
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,520
You do all the dirty work for him.

475
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,920
Yet he fooled you.

476
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,000
What's that sound?

477
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,880
Go check.

478
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,070
Why sneak around?

479
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,710
I dare you to show yourself!

480
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:33,950
Honey.

481
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:35,190
What a pleasant  surprise.

482
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,310
Get her.

483
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,310
Yue, watch out!

484
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,430
Mr. Di.

485
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,160
Let's go!

486
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:04,640
Zhao Buyou, run!

487
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,430
Zhao Buyou.

488
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:31,950
Come out now.

489
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:35,950
Let's go.

490
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:47,110
Lay down the shabby umbrella in your hand,

491
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:48,800
now!

492
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:31,800
It's all set.

493
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,590
Honey.

494
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,070
When you came here,

495
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,310
did you see the others?

496
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,880
What do you mean?

497
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,470
You're expecting someone?

498
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:00,710
I didn't see them.

499
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,710
We'll talk once we get out of here.

500
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,310
Burn it.

501
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,310
Burn it!

502
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:09,880
Di Lun.

503
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:11,830
Fifteen years ago,

504
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:14,310
I came to you with Li Yan's case file.

505
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,800
There was a problem with the closure.

506
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:17,310
Right now,

507
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,160
I'm a dying person.

508
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:21,110
Can you at least tell me the truth?

509
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:30,000
You want to know the truth?

510
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,800
Let me tell you this.

511
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,190
Even I don't know about the truth!

512
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:39,310
Because of the man you just talked about.

513
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:42,160
Because I was born into a poor family.

514
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,190
I took the imperial exam with his financial support.

515
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,350
That was why I had to sign

516
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,520
a 20-year contract with him.

517
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,000
I have to stay in this position.

518
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:53,560
I have to hide in the Office of Justice

519
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,640
and do all the dirty work for him!

520
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,680
You're damned right.

521
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,520
He did promise me.

522
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,070
If I managed to make that Auspicious Sign,

523
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:07,040
I could transfer to the Office of Treasury

524
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,350
and took that fat job.

525
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,070
Then I wouldn't have to hide anymore

526
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,310
and lived a life of great fortune.

527
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,710
But I was wrong.

528
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:21,710
Right.

529
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,640
Fifteen years ago, I didn't do it clean

530
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,950
with Li Yan's case

531
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:29,640
and let you stay alive.

532
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,880
I thought if I handed you over

533
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,520
I could make up for it.

534
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,040
Who would have thought

535
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,350
he had given up on me long ago.

536
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,430
Twenty years.

537
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,070
What did I get from twenty years of hard work?

538
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:49,430
Completely nothing

539
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:51,640
and a tarnished reputation.

540
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,070
Di Lun.

541
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:59,470
Did you change your handwriting

542
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,760
to engage in secret communication with him?

543
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,830
Yeah.

544
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,310
I practiced for three years.

545
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,830
The fire at the National Archives,

546
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,520
you did it, right?

547
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,070
You wanted to burn all the files

548
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,070
that concerned you, right?

549
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,230
I spent all night picking through the files.

550
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,800
Who do you work for?

551
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,040
What are their name?

552
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,640
Tell me their name.

553
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,880
I'd know who to get revenge on if I have to die.

554
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,190
Who are their name?

555
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:00,160
Di Lun.

556
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,040
Release my wife!

557
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,710
Watch them burn to ashes before you leave.

558
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,310
Yes.

559
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,680
If I knew we would end up like this,

560
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,710
I would've surrendered to them.

561
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:21,710
That was exhausted.

562
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,760
Honey, didn't I tell you to run?

563
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,950
Why did you come back?

564
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,950
Then you should've said something harsh.

565
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,000
It was my fault.

566
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,640
I'm always a burden.

567
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,070
It seems

568
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,310
we can't make it out alive.

569
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:46,040
Honey.

570
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,110
It occurred to me

571
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,680
not long after we met each other,

572
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,280
[Wen's Umbrella Shop]
you were running the umbrella shop.

573
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,800
I came to your shop one day.

574
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,400
You leaned on my back just like what you do now.

575
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,880
When you were making umbrellas,

576
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:06,230
every time I watched you put the tool behind you,

577
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,110
I'd secretly move my hands there.

578
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:12,310
I was waiting for you to put down the tool.

579
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,470
If I got lucky, I'd touch your hand.

580
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,160
I was thinking

581
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:23,110
it would be wonderful if I could hold her hands for the rest of our lives.

582
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:25,880
Now

583
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,880
over ten years have passed.

584
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:30,880
Honey.

585
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,430
If afterlife truly exists,

586
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:36,830
in our next life,

587
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:38,560
and the life after that,

588
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,950
let's be together again, all right?

589
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:42,070
Enough! That's not the time

590
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,400
for this.

591
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,160
Do you want to die here?

592
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,190
Promise me.

593
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,280
Let's be together again, all right.

594
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,070
All right.

595
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,590
Gu Zhen!

596
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,110
I'm dying because of you!

597
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,280
Who's that?

598
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,950
Inspector Gu?

599
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:01,520
Right!

600
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,710
Gu Zhen!

601
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:06,230
You're such a jerk!

602
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:11,310
Zhao Buyou!

603
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,590
Judge Wan.

604
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:13,560
Hurry up!

605
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:16,430
Judge Wan, what took you so long?

606
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,800
He didn't say

607
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,560
who's the man behind him.

608
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,190
Hurry!

609
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:24,520
Let's go!

610
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,520
Slowly.

611
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,400
Over here.

612
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,070
All right.

613
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,230
Just put it there.

614
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:43,760
Zhao Buyou.

615
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,160
What's the show you've put on?

616
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,880
This is not a show.

617
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,680
I was going all out.

618
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:55,000
It almost cost me my life.

619
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,350
Di Lun.

620
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,470
Buyou, my brother!

621
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,070
I'm glad you're fine.

622
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,070
What a relief.

623
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,880
We will talk about this later.

624
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,760
As long as you're okay.

625
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,760
What's this? You...

626
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,040
Hang on a second.

627
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,230
Inspector Gu.

628
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,920
Can we have a moment?

629
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,310
Let's talk right here.

630
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,400
All right.

631
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:41,950
We're all allies now.

632
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:44,760
Inspector Gu.

633
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:47,680
Do you even know who's behind me?

634
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,880
You said who's behind you?

635
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:53,880
Isn't it Wan Fu?

636
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,560
Yeah.

637
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:56,160
It's me.

638
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,920
Judge Wan, please don't joke about it.

639
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,590
I know

640
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,190
I've done many things wrong for all these years.

641
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:07,040
But I've decided

642
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,430
to tell you who's behind me

643
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,760
and all the dirty work I've done

644
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,920
for him for all these years,

645
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,350
every last bit of it,

646
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,920
including the case

647
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,000
concerning Li Yan fifteen years ago.

648
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:21,280
How about this?

649
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:23,800
You and I cooperate to take him down.

650
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:24,800
You agree?

651
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,830
So you were the one

652
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,800
who killed Li Yan?

653
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:35,280
That's correct.

654
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,040
Is this?

655
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:56,070
Member of the Jingyuan Triumphant Army,

656
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:56,760
Gu Zhen.

657
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,950
And the Commander of the same army

658
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,470
is Li Yan.

659
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:57,520
It's right here.

660
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:12,360
It's been fifteen years.

661
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:18,910
I've been looking for you for fifteen years.

662
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:23,080
Go to hell

663
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,470
and apologize to my brother.

664
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,430
Gu Zhen

665
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,390
of the Jingyuan Triumphant Army

666
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:41,470
has avenged the Commander

667
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:49,230
Li Yan!

668
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:23,430
Wen Yue.

669
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,950
How did you get away?

670
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,360
Li Yan's a good official.

671
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,600
I couldn't bring myself to do it.

672
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,320
Our employer told me

673
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,520
to kill them all,

674
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,320
every last one of them.

675
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,390
Kill them!

676
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,230
Kill them!

677
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:52,470
Kill them!

678
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:02,910
Kill him!

679
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,470
We'll talk about it later.

680
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,360
It's the Office of Justice.

681
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:14,870
They are here.

682
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:15,800
We're here for an investigation.

683
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,430
You've been surrounded.

684
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,560
Surrender now!

685
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,710
Later, those people from the Office of Justice arrived.

686
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:22,470
They told us to surrender

687
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,560
while shooting arrows at us.

688
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,520
In a moment of despair, I jumped into the water and went ashore.

689
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,000
That's how I got away.

690
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,040
When he died,

691
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:35,150
did he suffer?

692
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:37,520
It happened

693
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:39,520
in the blink of an eye.

694
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:43,670
Inspector Gu.

695
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:46,870
What do you plan to deal with us?

696
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:48,870
With laws?

697
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,080
Or morality?

698
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:08,320
I'll come see you one day.

699
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,000
Let's go.

700
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,670
You seemed tough

701
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:41,390
when you wrote the divorce letter.

702
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:44,470
"I wish you a life of happiness."

703
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,040
So I came to your rescue.

704
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:47,760
Happy now?

705
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,670
I swear to Heaven,

706
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,430
I sincerely hoped you could leave.

707
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,840
I wanted Gu Zhen

708
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,600
to arrest that scumbag.

709
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,150
Husband and wife are supposed to share weal and woe.

710
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:01,800
If I forsake you to live a peaceful life,

711
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:04,390
do you really think I can get over the guilt?

712
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,000
Let's go.

713
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,320
Go home.

714
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,520
Honey.

715
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:16,000
I've been thinking about it for a while,

716
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,560
but my legs feel like jelly.

717
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,190
You said,

718
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:38,190
as long as we're living people, we won't starve to death in East Capital.

719
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,840
Is it true?

720
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,120
Of course.

721
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:45,560
So you're not leaving?

722
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:47,670
I'm staying.

723
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:54,710
Please help me up.

724
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:09,120
Zhao Buyou, wake up.

725
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,470
Hang in there, we're home.

726
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:24,190
If you still feel dizzy and nauseous,

727
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,910
try to chew a slice of ginger.

728
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:30,600
Honey.

729
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,590
Am I too much of a wimp?

730
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:39,270
I'm a grown man in my late thirties.

731
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,120
Yet it almost scared me to death.

732
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:44,560
I can't even begin to imagine

733
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,560
how you pulled through

734
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,710
while you were still in your teens.

735
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,000
But rest assured.

736
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:12,670
Di Lun is dead.

737
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,670
No one can prove it now.

738
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,150
As for Inspector Gu,

739
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,080
he dared take such a great risk

740
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,390
just to avenge a fellow soldier.

741
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,950
I think he's a man of integrity.

742
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:29,950
He won't be coming for us.

743
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:33,670
I'm worried about your fellow disciple, though.

744
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:36,120
Yishui is

745
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:39,560
indeed a trouble.

746
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,710
Honey, how about you just go slice the ginger for me?

747
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:54,700
[Kaifeng Court]

748
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,120
Boss.

749
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,800
I can assure you

750
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:05,760
no one will ever find the man.

751
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,870
I never doubt your competence.

752
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,390
There's one thing I don't understand.

753
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:13,710
Well.

754
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000

Don't you think you were a bit reckless?

762
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:37,280
Normally,

when you receive bribes,

764
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,520
will you do as they say?

00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,040
I never take bribes.

766
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:54,560

why do they willingly give you the money?

775
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,670
That's

776
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,870
because I've done a great job.

777
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,560
