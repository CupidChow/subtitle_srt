why are you here?

I'm sorry.

00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,370

Don't do anything so dangerous again.

75
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,790
But Luan Hui and his wife are dead,

76
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,850
so there's no one left to testify against Zou Mian.

77
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,340
Once the rare stone reaches the imperial palace,

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,920
he'll likely regain the Emperor's favor.

He's not worth risking your life for.

I won't allow

00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:11,270
Sure.

95
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:12,950
I'll make it for you.

Sure.

99
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,010
I'll do it tomorrow.

101
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,020
I was worried Father hadn't eaten,

102
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:48,270

105
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,200
I can cook for Father.

106
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,200
It's fine.

107
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,650
If you can get Yao He to help,

108
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,670
it works too.

109
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,160
Then, during this time,

110
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,640
just ask Yao He to help out.

111
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,440
Okay.

112
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,830
Is there food for me?

113
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,390
Yes, there is!

114
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,000

115
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,550

If we all know Wen Yue's situation,

119
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,460
this family will fall apart.

120

Pretending we know nothing

121

Don't worry.

As long as I'm here

124
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,600
and Wen Yue is here,

125
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,350
this family won't break apart.

126
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,040

Wen Yue

130
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,720

131
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,780
Once they're resolved, she'll return.

132
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:18,920
The key is

133
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,280
making that old villain Zou Mian pay.

134
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,480

to host a banquet for his ministers.

176
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:52,620
Yes.

Money flows here like water,

- Sir, you're here. - Could Father really be here?

180

Have some fun...

181
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,140
Look at how serious he seems.

If he really is here,

183
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,030
then he has no sense of propriety.

00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,400
My little peach...

193
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,000
I caught one...

194
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,030
I caught one!

195
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,000
Another one!

196
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:32,760
Don't move!

197
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,880
Why are you here?

198
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,320
Go back!

199
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,520
Go back, both of you!

200
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,200
Shh.

201
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,000
I didn't summon you here.

202
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,350
Hurry and leave!

203
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,150
Come on!

204
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,640
Sir,

205
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:48,960
are you together?

206
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,080
Shall I prepare another room for you?

207
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,110
- No need. - No, thanks.

208
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,200
Madam,

209
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:54,790
may I ask

210
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,910
how much silver will he need to pay for tonight?

211
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:59,170
Well,

212
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:00,350
we don't take silver as payment.

213
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,840
Just using this luxury room

214
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,530
costs ten liang of gold.

215
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:06,790
Alright.

216
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,790
I don't have enough money on me.

217
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:14,760
Here's the plan:

218
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:15,730
Later,

219
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:16,930
you take Father away first.

220
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:17,880
No way.

221
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,150
I can't leave you here alone!

222
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,000
Didn't you hear?

223
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,010
Ten liang of gold!

224
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,230
Show some backbone,

225
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,230
and take Father away.

226
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,000
If anything happens,

227
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,760
I'll handle it.

228
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,590
Enough!

229
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,710
Don't play any more games tonight!

230
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,730
Who is it?

231
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:36,640
It's nothing.

232
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,910
Let's go home first!

233
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,520
Don't leave!

234
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:43,320
What's going on?

235
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,640
Sir,

236
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,960
are the girls not serving you well?

237
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,280
How can they behave so improperly?

238
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,910
Calm down.

239
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,790
Come over here.

240
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,000
My daughter

241
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,110
is too spoiled.

242
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:00,000
She has a bad temper.

243
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:00,940
Come on,

244
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,200
let's go on!

245
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,840
Oh, you're the princess.

246
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,230
What princess?

247
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,080
Nonsense!

248
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,280
What a temper she has!

249
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,470
I already told you...

250
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:16,670
Princess,

251
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:17,910
escort His Majesty

252
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,810
back home.

253
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,640
- Time to leave. Let's go home! - Ban...

254
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,110
- Ban! - Let's go home!

255
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,110
I've not done having fun!

256
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,230
My little peach.

257
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:27,030
- It's fine... - Sir.

258
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,280
Take care!

259
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,150
My little fairy...

260
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,030
Take care!

261
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:30,910
My fairy!

262
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:31,590
Let's go!

263
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,450
- My clothes are still inside. - Forget them!

264
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:34,280
I've not done having fun!

265
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,470
Sorry about this.

266
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,550
Sorry to trouble you.

267
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,550
So,

268
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:40,960
how much do we owe you?

269
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,320
Please spare us!

270
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,690
You're embarrassing us.

271
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,440
If we have done anything wrong,

272
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:48,550
please forgive us.

273
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,790
Spare us, Sir!

274
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,000
Please!

275
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:54,880
All of you,

276
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,200
sorry for the intrusion.

277
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,230
Not a single coin was spent?

278
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,400
I don't understand it either.

279
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:15,150
That madam even called me a princess.

280
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,790
Could they really have mistaken Father

281
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:18,960
for the Emperor?

282
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,350
What's strange about that?

283
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,960
We are of the same royal bloodline.

284
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,880
That Eleventh Brother.

285
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:29,230
When he was young, he was reckless and carefree,

286
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,150
just like me.

287
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,520
Father, could you explain in detail?

288
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,640
Does he resemble you

289
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,880
in behavior or in appearance?

290
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:40,230
A bit of both.

291
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,400
Back then,

292
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,440
when Eleventh Brother was the Prince of Duan,

293
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,350
we often hung out together.

294
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,550
People frequently

295
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,350
mistook me for him.

296
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,150
So, does that mean

297
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,470
our family is closely related to the Emperor?

298
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,080
What close relation?

299
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,670
That Eleventh Brother

300
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,230
could never handle hearing the truth.

301
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,320
That's why I left.

302
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,470
Someone recommended him to the Empress Dowager

303
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,520
to make him the Emperor.

304
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:09,760
I wondered

305
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,550
if he could be Emperor,

306
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,080
why couldn't I?

307
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,520
And because of that comment,

308
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,110
he held a grudge against me

309
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,200
and made trouble for me everywhere.

310
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,400
I got so angry

311
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,520
that I left.

312
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,440
I've never interacted

313
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,470
with them since then.

314
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,840
Then why did you use his identity to go

315
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,030
to go to that den of luxury?

316
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,130
You can't blame me for that.

317
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:32,200
I didn't do it on purpose.

318
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,910
The moment I walked in,

319
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,550
they all dropped to their knees...

320
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,710
Please spare us!

321
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:39,000
...bowing and pleading.

322
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,590
You've got the wrong person.

323
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,710
You just look

324
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,200
a lot like His Majesty.

325
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:50,840
After all,

326
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:51,960
we are legitimate

327
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,110
royal family members!

328
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,110
Buyou,

329
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,520
don't get upset.

330
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:03,640
I won't go there again.

331
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,960
I've come up with a way to deal with Zou Mian.

332
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,520
Zheng, come here.

333
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:29,960
Plum Blossom Soup Noodles,

334
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,470
Lotus Stuffed Fish...

335
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,350
They're all our hometown dishes.

336
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,000
And this braised chicken.

337
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,910
It was your childhood favorite.

338
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,550
Do you remember?

339
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,110
Take a seat.

340
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,280
This first cup of wine

341
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:58,020
is for our parents.

342
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,840
If they knew from the afterlife

343
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,230
that we siblings had reunited,

344
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,550
they'd surely be overjoyed.

345
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,350
This second cup of wine

346
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,280
is my apology to you.

347
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,200
What are you apologizing for?

348
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,320
After seeing you,

349
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,960
I didn't reveal myself earlier.

350
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,910
Instead, I acted like a sneaky bounty poster.

351
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,400
I didn't know if you still remembered me

352
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:35,710
or if you'd even acknowledge me.

353
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,050
I could only hide

354
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:41,740
and watch you from a distance,

355
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,350
wondering how you've been all these years.

356
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:47,890
Until I saw Zhao Buyou

357
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,470
deliberately deceiving you,

358
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,710
I couldn't bear it.

359
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:52,640
Zhao Buyou

360
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:55,890
is your brother-in-law.

361
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:58,410
He must have had his reasons for keeping things from me.

362
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,480
If not for him taking me in,

363
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,810
would we even

364
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,250
be reunited today?

365
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,360
It's all thanks to him.

366
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:11,000
I understand his struggles.

367
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,610
I know there's a chasm

368
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,790
between you two.

369
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,470
Only the person who started the problem can resolve it.

370
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,350
I've thought of a good way

371
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,200
to reconcile you and him,

372
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,760
so there will be no more resentment between you two.

373
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:27,520
Our family

374
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,740
will live happily together.

375
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,230
What's your plan?

376
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,470
Tell me.

377
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,150
A few days ago,

378
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,130
I had a deep talk with Mo.

379
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:40,360
He wants to avenge his father.

380
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,400
How would he take revenge?

381
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,250
Of course,

382
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,670
by stopping Zou Mian from reaching the imperial palace.

383
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,280
But Mo is just a child.

384
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:51,030
How could he possibly stop Zou Mian?

385
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,840
And I was just a child too,

386
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,710
but I've done so much.

387
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,350
Mo is different.

388
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,080
I mean,

389
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,110
Mo is naive

390
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,310
and keeps everything bottled up.

391
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,350
Once he makes up his mind,

392
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:09,830
he will see it through.

393
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,000
Then let him do it!

394
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,160
Sorry.

395
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,760
But if he truly stops Zou Mian,

396
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,470
he'd not only avenge his father

397
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:28,760
but also redeem him.

398
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,070
Wouldn't that be killing two birds with one stone?

399
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:32,770
Zheng,

400
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,110
you're still not telling me

401
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:36,940
everything.

402
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:39,640
Wen Yue!

403
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,110
Do you know what day it is today?

404
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:44,400
What day?

405
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:50,230
Today

406
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,800
is my birthday.

407
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,350
Do you forget it?

408
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,190
Zheng,

409
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,160
I'm sorry.

410
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,280
From now on, I'll be with you

411
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,680
every year on your birthday.

412
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:07,480
But Mo's matter

413
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,820
can't wait even a moment.

414
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,710
How foolish of me.

415
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,000
Ban.

416
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,040
Wen Yue.

417
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:29,640
Where's Buyou?

418
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,400
I don't know.

419
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,350
I just got back.

420
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:34,640
Both Buyou and Father aren't home.

421
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,710
Alright. Let's go.

422
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,190
Follow me. We'll find Zhao Mo.

423
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,000
Quickly!

424
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,940
[The Office of Justice]

425
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:46,950
Mr. Yan!

426
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,110
Mr. Yan!

427
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,800
Is Zhao Mo not inside?

428
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,040
Mo isn't here.

429
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:51,830
By the way,

430
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,040
his colleagues said

431
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,400
he borrowed quite a bit of money earlier,

432
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,040
saying he needed to buy some materials.

433
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,920
We found this on his desk.

434
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,760
Take a look yourselves.

435
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,800
- Thank you. - Thanks.

436
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,230
No problem.

437
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,830
What is this?

438
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:09,800
Ban,

439
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,400
is it Rainbow Bridge in the drawing?

440
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:14,400
It seems so.

441
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,160
Niter and sulfur...

442
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,520
I just remembered,

443
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,760
these are ingredients for making gunpowder!

444
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,070
Zhao Mo once used them

445
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,280
to produce highly potent gunpowder.

446
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:27,070
Mr. Mo,

447
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,190
you managed to figure out a gunpowder recipe!

448
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,520
I only used a small amount,

449
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,470
and it was already so powerful.

450
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:32,680
Handle the quantities right.

451
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,160
Don't end up blowing up the bridge!

452
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,040
What exactly is he trying to do?

453
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,880
Rainbow Bridge is a critical route for Zou Mian to reach the imperial palace.

454
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,800
If Zhao Mo

455
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,680
is planning to stop him...

456
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:44,880
This is bad!

457
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,070
Quick, let's find Inspector Gu!

458
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,310
- Okay. - Listen to me!

459
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:50,280
- What's going on? - They're trying a corrupt official at the market today!

460
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,160
Exclusive scoop!

461
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,760
Tonight at the business center, Zou Mian will stand trial!

462
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,800
Zou Mian will stand trial tonight?

463
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,950
You all just go to see it.

464
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,680
It's bound to be an earth-shattering revelation!

465
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,640
You all have to see it!

466
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,280
Yes!

467
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,020
Let's all go!

468
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,110
Let's all head there.

469
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,590
Are we ready?

470
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,590
We're ready.

471
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:17,230
Tonight at the business center, enjoy a grand show!

472
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,920
Publicly trying corrupt officials, let justice glow!

473
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,880
Tonight at the business center, enjoy a grand show!

474
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,710
Publicly trying corrupt officials, let justice glow!

475
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:24,560
Tonight at the business center, enjoy a grand show!

476
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,160
Publicly trying corrupt officials, let justice glow!

477
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,880
Tonight at the business center, enjoy a grand show!

478
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,680
Publicly trying corrupt officials, let justice glow!

479
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,110
Tonight at the business center, enjoy a grand show...

480
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,560
Why has the ship stopped?

481
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,310
A small, blind boat

482
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,470
has blocked the way.

483
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,230
Deal with it quickly.

484
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:52,280
We mustn't delay presenting the treasure.

485
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,000
Understood.

486
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:56,950
Wait!

487
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,230
Leave.

488
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,170
Leave.

489
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:12,310
This flute music

490
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,800
carries a regal air,

491
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,310
not something played by an ordinary person.

492
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,760
Harmonious notes played on a jade flute...

493
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,760
The Emperor once played incognito

494
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,880
while traveling in the South.

495
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,800
It's the exact same tune they performed!

496
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,950
Where is the criminal Zou Mian?

497
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:43,160
The criminal

498
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,400
Zou Mian is here!

499
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,230
I told you the moment he sees me,

500
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,280
he'll have to kneel.

501
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,980
Father, stop talking.

502
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,760
Zou Mian,

503
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,110
get off the ship at once

504
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,760
and come forward to meet His Majesty!

505
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,590
At once!

506
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,310
Quickly, dock the ship!

507
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,350
Father,

508
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:13,800
he believed it.

509
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,710
Is it really the Emperor?

510
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:18,920
Could this be a trick?

511
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,310
I've seen the Emperor more than a dozen times.

512
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,640
How could I mistake him?

513
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,400
Buyou,

514
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,400
look.

515
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,400
I feel like my eyebrows

516
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,800
look too thick after you drew them.

517
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,230
No problem.

518
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,560
Your eyebrows

519
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,280
were drawn exactly like the portrait.

520
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,400
They're identical.

521
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,430
What about my hair?

522
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:39,560
Is it too black?

523
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,430
It's so dark out.

524
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:41,310
It all looks the same.

525
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,160
Still, I feel like

526
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,950
you cut my beard too short.

527
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,310
Trust me.

528
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,680
The beard was drawn exactly like the portrait too.

529
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,230
What are they whispering about?

530
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,470
This is exhausting.

531
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,040
Father,

532
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,350
sit up straight. - What's going on?

533
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:54,520
What...

534
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,040
what are they doing?

535
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,190
This is unbearable!

536
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,040
Hang in there.

537
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,070
It's almost done.

538
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,040
This doesn't feel right.

539
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,190
Don't forget,

540
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:04,400
you're the Emperor now.

541
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,430
The appearance of the Geng Yue Stone

542
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,430
is a heavenly blessing

543
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,430
anticipated by the entire court.

544
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,400
Criminal Zou Mian

545
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,880
humbly welcomes Your Majesty aboard

546
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:23,640
to accept the Geng Yue Stone,

547
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,970
bestowing fortune upon all the people!

548
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,590
Where could Zhao Mo be?

549
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,280
Boss,

550
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,640
we got news from the underground market today

551
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,160
that Zhao Mo bought a large amount of sulfur and niter.

552
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,430
He's dead set on blowing up the bridge.

553
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:51,310
Clear the area.

554
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:52,000
Yes, sir.

555
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:52,950
Tie Chi, Fei Jian.

556
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:53,430
Here!

557
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:54,230
Take our men

558
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,680
and secure both sides of Rainbow Bridge.

559
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,000
Ensure that all citizens

560
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,830
can only exit, not enter.

561
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,710
But with so many people,

562
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:59,430
we'll need...

563
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:00,560
we'll need some sort of justification.

564
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,280
With a divine blessing entering the capital

565
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,190
and the sacred stone crossing the bridge,

566
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,280
no one may stand above the stone.

567
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,110
Anyone who disobeys will be executed!

568
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:08,470
Understood!

569
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:09,040
Move!

570
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:10,110
All units,

571
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,350
with a divine blessing entering the capital

572
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:12,520
and the sacred stone crossing the bridge,

573
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,760
no one may stand above the stone.

574
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:16,070
Anyone who disobeys will be executed!

575
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:17,190
Make way!

576
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,560
Get off the bridge!

577
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,280
Get off the bridge!

578
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,280
Move quickly!

579
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,430
Hurry up!

580
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,190
Father,

581
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:29,070
I think they're starting to suspect something.

582
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:30,310
Don't turn around.

583
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,520
Let me handle this.

584
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,640
Zou Mian, how dare you!

585
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:38,950
His Majesty wants to see you,

586
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:40,680
and you're still not coming down immediately?

587
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:53,830
Father,

588
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:55,640
insult him.

589
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,310
You scoundrel!

590
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,710
Still not coming down immediately?

591
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,400
Insult him with authority!

592
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,310
You scoundrel!

593
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:05,590
He seems

594
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,880
a bit different

595
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,110
from the last time I saw the Emperor.

596
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,800
Is he here?

597
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,640
Can we

598
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,230
get a glimpse of His Majesty's face?

599
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:19,040
Zou Mian, how dare you!

600
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,110
Today, the Emperor graces you with His presence,

601
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,470
yet you're being so insolent!

602
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,590
Father, retreat!

603
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,000
Let's head to the shore first.

604
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,680
The raft is moving, heading to the shore.

605
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,000
They're running away?

606
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:34,800
So it was a trick after all.

607
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,800
I'll send someone to capture them immediately.

608
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,430
Guards!

609
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,560
Capture them!

610
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,470
Everyone, get off the bridge!

611
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:43,880
Have you seen Zhao Mo?

612
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,160
No sign of him anywhere.

613
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,000
I'm talking to you, did you hear me?

614
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,190
Hey, the one pushing the cart!

615
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:53,280
Get off the bridge!

616
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:54,880
I'm talking to you,

617
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:55,950
the one pushing the cart!

618
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,190
Get off the bridge immediately!

619
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,190
Tie Chi, Fei Jian,

620
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:00,230
stop the one pushing the cart!

621
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,350
Yes, sir!

622
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,110
Move quickly!

623
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,070
Off the bridge now!

624
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,280
What are you doing?

625
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,190
Didn't you hear the order?

626
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,400
Off the bridge now!

627
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:12,880
Get down!

628
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:13,530
Stop!

629
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:16,590
Archers, ready!

630
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:17,760
Quickly!

631
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:19,610
It's Zhao Mo!

632
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,520
Mo!

633
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,730
Zhao Mo!

634
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:23,400
Hurry!

635
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:23,950
Zhao Mo!

636
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,800
Put the things down first.

637
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,350
Come on, step off the bridge.

638
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:29,920
I have

639
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,430
six fire bombs here.

640
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,950
If I ignite them,

641
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:34,760
the entire bridge will blow up.

642
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,160
All of you, leave now.

643
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:38,640
Get down!

644
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,430
Inspector Gu,

645
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,310
let me talk to Mo.

646
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,350
Do you think talking to him now

647
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:44,470
will make any difference?

648
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,760
Mo is young and impulsive.

649
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,230
Get down!

650
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,830
He's taken the wrong path in a moment of panic.

651
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:49,920
Give him a chance.

652
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,230
He'll listen to me.

653
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,800
And if he doesn't listen to you?

654
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,800
Look at the people below the bridge.

655
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,470
You wouldn't want to harm them, would you?

656
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,000
- Give me the fire striker... - Get down!

657
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,590
If anything happens,

658
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:01,430
I'll take full responsibility.

659
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,190
Can you bear the consequences?

660
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:05,190
If something goes wrong,

661
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,800
the only one who can act is me.

662
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:09,040
Get down!

663
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,470
Fine.

664
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,230
Alright.

665
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,660
You have only this one chance.

666
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:15,680
I won't play with the lives

667
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,350
of so many people.

668
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,800
If you fail,

669
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,190
I will act.

670
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,410
Everyone, move back!

671
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,070
Thank you.

672
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:25,800
I'm going with you!

673
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,310
- Ban! - Stay there, Ban!

674
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:26,880
Zhao Mo...

675
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,160
Wen Yue is here.

676
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:42,920
Mo,

677
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,230
what are you doing?

678
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,430
Don't act rashly.

679
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:49,000
Listen to me.

680
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,310
Put down the fire striker.

681
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:53,160
Wen Yue,

682
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,520
I'm sorry.

683
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,590
Ban and I apologize to you.

684
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,680
Once Zou Mian's ship

685
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:05,830
arrives,

686
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,950
I'll light the fire bombs,

687
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,160
blow up Rainbow Bridge,

688
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,950
and stop the stone from entering the palace.

689
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,110
Then I'll have avenged you.

690
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:14,920
Mo,

691
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,400
I've never held anything against you.

692
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,760
No matter whose child you are,

693
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,160
you're my brother,

694
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:25,950
my family.

695
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,880
I never thought about revenge,

696
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:30,760
and I don't need you

697
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,880
to do anything for me.

698
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,160
Listen to me, Zhao Mo.

699
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,400
Put down the fire striker.

700
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,590
Now.

701
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,760
Stay back, Wen Yue!

702
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,430
Don't come any closer!

703
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:40,160
Don't come any closer...

704
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:46,590
I'm doing all this

705
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,280
not just for you,

706
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,950
but also for Sun Bo,

707
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,350
and for Ding Dan.

708
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,880
Against people like them,

709
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,470
what else can we do?

710
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,160
Is there no justice in this world?

711
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,230
Are the lives of the poor

712
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,880
so easily trampled on?

713
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,680
They were all victims of Zou Mian.

714
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:11,590
I once made a pact with Ding Dan

715
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:13,710
to plead for the people,

716
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,040
to join the government for the common good.

717
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:21,040
I will be another Detective Dee...

718
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,320
Then I'll be another Zhang Jianzhi!

719
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,520
But Zou Mian has committed so many crimes,

720
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,800
why has he never been punished?

721
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,680
There

722
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,560
is no justice in this world.

723
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,430
With my blood, I will stain the rare stone.

724
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,830
With my body, I will pave the righteous path!

725
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:41,560
This is the path I've chosen.

726
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:42,430
Zhao Mo,

727
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:43,400
get a hold of yourself.

728
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:46,040
I don't want to discuss righteousness with you now.

729
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,300
Your life

730
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,040
was saved by our father and your brother,

731
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,110
and raised by me with ten years of toil!

732
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,680
Your life

733
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,470
is meant for something greater!

734
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:58,710
What's the point of blowing up some stone?

735
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,850
Kill one Zou Mian,

736
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:01,890
and there will be another.

737
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,170
If you're not afraid of death,

738
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:04,760
then why not live boldly instead?

739
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,590
Step by step, we can change the world.

740
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,560
Mo,

741
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,560
I also want to see

742
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:19,070
the better world you dream of.

743
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,760
Let's face life together.

744
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,190
The ship is almost here.

745
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:30,590
I can't let it all fail now!

746
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,470
Wen Yue,

747
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:34,210
being part of the Zhao family

748
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,710
and being your and Buyou's younger brother

749
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,430
has been enough for me

750
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,110
in this lifetime.

751
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,160
Wen Yue, please leave.

752
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,260
Please leave now!

753
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,690
I beg you, please leave!

754
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,470
At your coming-of-age ceremony,

755
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,830
you knelt before me,

756
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:12,470
saying it wasn't easy for me to raise you for ten years

757
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:15,280
and that half of your life belongs to me.

758
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,950
Doesn't that make me half a mother to you?

759
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,560
If you die,

760
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,590
how will I go on?

761
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,230
If today,

762
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,350
you insist on blowing up this bridge,

763
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:36,110
then I'll stay here with you!

764
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:39,350
On the path to the afterlife, I'll walk with you!

765
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:42,230
In the next life, let's be family again!

766
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:47,560
I beg you, Zhao Mo!

767
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,040
Wen Yue,

768
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:16,110
I'm sorry.

769
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,310
All right.

770
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:37,950
Wen Yue...

771
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:38,830
Wen Yue...

772
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:52,590
Mo,

773
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,350
I'm utterly disappointed in you.

774
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:06,710
It's over.

775
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,160
Everything is over.

776
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,160
Move!

777
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:17,430
Stop!

778
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,710
I have firebombs here.

779
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:23,830
Zheng,

780
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,950
you didn't listen to me after all.

781
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,470
You brat, what are you doing?

782
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:28,800
The ship has already passed!

783
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,000
Wen Yue,

784
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:35,070
How I wish you had come for me.

785
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,430
But alas, you didn't.

786
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,760
You think I'm different from Zhao Mo,

787
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:44,590
so I'll join him and die with that old villain.

788
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:47,160
But you won't give me this chance.

789
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:49,190
Do you know how dangerous it is here?

790
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,920
You risked your life to save Mo.

791
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:58,110
Are you abandoning me again?

792
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:00,040
Who are you really,

793
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:02,680
Su Yue or Wen Yue?

794
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,760
Who do you truly call family?

795
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,950
My brother

796
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:11,390
is Su Zheng,

797
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,630
not He Huan.

798
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:14,910
I...

799
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,040
Spare him! Don't shoot!

800
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,120
Su Zheng

801
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:32,040
already died on that fateful road of escape.

802
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,710
For twenty years,

803
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:38,430
to transport these damned rare stones,

804
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:42,760
how many laborers have been killed?

805
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:45,950
How many toilers have died?

806
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:51,080
The people along the riverbanks have been displaced.

807
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:52,840
Everywhere these stones pass,

808
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:54,870
they leave behind only bones!

809
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:56,710
The splendor of the East Capital,

810
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,360
the so-called divine blessing,

811
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,150
are built upon the blood and tears of the people!

812
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:03,600
In such a world,

813
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:07,040
only evil can counter evil.

814
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:09,520
If all those Su Zhengs

815
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,470
had survived,

816
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,910
today,

817
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:19,120
they'd all be He Huan.

818
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:28,950
Zheng...

819
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,320
It's okay.

820
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:36,840
Wen Yue.

821
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,520
Here, take this back.

822
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:58,800
Tie Chi, Fei Jian!

823
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,320
Zheng!

824
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:06,870
Zheng!

825
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:15,080
Zhao Mo...

826
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,630
Zhao Mo...

827
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,150
Let's go home.

828
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,020
Look at him, still so young...

829
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:33,760
Boss,

830
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:35,130
something's happening over there.

831
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,560
Make way!

832
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,280
Everyone,

833
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,040
please remain calm.

834
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:52,360
Since I've gathered you here,

835
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,600
just get your brushes and ink ready.

836
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,560
There's bound to be shocking revelations soon.

837
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:58,000
What shocking revelations?

838
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
We've been waiting forever!

839
00:36:59,050 --> 00:36:59,900
Be patient.

840
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,120
Excuse me, make way!

841
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:04,470
Who's this guy?

842
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:06,210
You know the Governor, right?

843
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:06,800
The Governor is here!

844
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,910
Didn't I tell you

845
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:09,040
there'd be big news?

846
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:10,430
The Governor himself is here!

847
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:11,470
It must be big!

848
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,950
I'm here to watch the play.

849
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,800
Why did you seat me on the stage?

850
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:18,360
Father, trust me.

851
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,430
For this play,

852
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:21,080
you're sitting in the best seat.

853
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,630
You and your clever ideas!

854
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:33,400
Here they come!

855
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,630
Everyone knows

856
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,000
that I often tell stories

857
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,710
here at the business center.

858
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:45,580
In the past,

859
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,360
I mostly told historical tales.

860
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,160
Today,

861
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:50,640
I'll be inviting a young talent

862
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:53,430
to join me in recounting

863
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:55,230
a tale of past secrets.

864
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,710
A tale of past secrets...

865
00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:01,390
Please stay and enjoy the performance.

866
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:03,950
I thank you all in advance.

867
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:08,910
Let us welcome this talented guest,

868
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,360
Zhao Buyou!

869
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,360
Who's Zhao Buyou?

870
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:14,120
Never heard of him.

871
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,200
Zhao Buyou...

872
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:15,760
Who is he?

873
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:17,520
Who?

874
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,190
Never heard of him.

875
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,040
Never heard of him.

876
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,040
Never heard of this guy.

877
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:21,320
Who is he?

878
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,190
Ladies and gentlemen,

879
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,120
I am Zhao Buyou, a litigator from Xiangran Street.

880
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:30,000
It is a great honor to share the stage

881
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,190
with Mr. Li today.

882
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,120
Mr. Li,

883
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:33,120
please, go ahead.

884
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,670
More than twenty years ago,

885
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,910
a corrupt official in the South,

886
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,360
hoping to curry favor with the Emperor,

887
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:44,390
planned to present a treasure to the palace.

888
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:45,150
However,

889
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:47,390
the South and the East Capital

890
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:49,470
are thousands of miles apart.

891
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:50,950
Transporting a treasure

892
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:53,470
was no easy feat.

893
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,670
What could he do?

894
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:58,280
A corrupt official always has their schemes.

895
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,560
He seized military ships

896
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,390
and converted them into cargo ships.

897
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,320
Here's a blueprint of the modifications.

898
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,910
On this ship,

899
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:08,120
there are multiple rows of oars.

900
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:09,520
It's clearly a warship.

901
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,630
But

902
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:12,190
how could a private shipyard

903
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,840
have blueprints for a warship?

904
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:22,710
This corrupt official was truly bold.

905
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,360
Illegally modifying military ships

906
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:25,870
is a capital offense!

907
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,600
He seized military ships and converted them into cargo vessels.

908
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,360
He dared to do such a thing!

909
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,150
He, too,

910
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:34,560
feared that this would be exposed.

911
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,560
But later,

912
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,280
a shipbuilder named Su Zhi

913
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,710
discovered his crime.

914
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:42,630
To cover his tracks,

915
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,080
this corrupt official brutally murdered

916
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,120
Su Zhi and his entire family.

917
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:49,540
Killed them?

918
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,120
He killed to silence them!

919
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,040
Such cruelty!

920
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,520
This is truly horrifying.

921
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,150
A tragedy beyond words!

922
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:00,320
What an evil man!

923
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:01,600
Utterly despicable!

924
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:04,470
Later on,

925
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,710
this corrupt official, through his presentation of treasures to the palace,

926
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:09,430
was promoted and amassed great wealth.

927
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,120
Before long,

928
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,040
he became a tyrant of the South.

929
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,150
To facilitate the transport of treasures,

930
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:18,520
he intensified his oppression:

931
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:20,760
Tearing down bridges, destroying roads,

932
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,080
and marking off areas with imperial seals.

933
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,630
The people were displaced,

934
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,560
suffering beyond measure.

935
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,390
In this world,

936
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:30,560
where such corrupt officials exist,

937
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,470
there must also

938
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,710
be upright and loyal ministers.

939
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,800
Were there still such righteous men?

940
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,000
At the time,

941
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,150
the Deputy Transport Commissioner, Li,

942
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:42,080
was such a virtuous official.

943
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:45,150
He repeatedly reported to impeach this corrupt official,

944
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,360
vowing to rid the people of their oppressor.

945
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,280
Did he succeed in bringing him down?

946
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,870
Li persistently impeached him,

947
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:55,150
but achieved nothing.

948
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:58,320
He decided to personally go to the palace to file a complaint.

949
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,760
But who would've thought,

950
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,190
word got out,

951
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,430
and the corrupt official

952
