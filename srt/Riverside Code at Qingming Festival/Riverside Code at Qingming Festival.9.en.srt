- Yeah. - It suits you.

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:52,850
Get one.

00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,880
Do you have any fine hand cream?

50
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,080
Of course. Please come in.

51
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,720
Just a second.

52
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:43,390
Look at your lips. They are peeling.

53
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,190
- Miss, here's our new arrival. - Try this.

54
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:46,190
Thank you.

55
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:46,960
No, thank you.

56
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,470
I don't apply this kind of stuff.

57
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,800
The color is reddish brown.

58
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,880
It's very natural.

59
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:51,520
No, thank you.

60
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,160
It's very moisturizing. Try it.

00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,600
Please allow me to

introduce you to my wife.

64
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,800
We know each other.

65
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,670
What a coincidence, Yue.

66
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,270
It seems

67
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,600
that you have taken my advice.

68
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,880
Their hand cream is really good.

69
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,160
Wen Yue, she is...

70
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,960
I've already visited Lady Zhang today.

71
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,670
We also discussed about applying makeup.

72
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,470
It's good that you're here.

73
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,550
I need you for something.

74
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:42,720
- Let's go. - Okay.

75
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,080
Buyou.

76
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,960
You haven't finished your work, have you?

77
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:48,910
That's right.

78
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,390
Wen Yue, I still have work to do.

79
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,240
See you at home.

80
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,270
What kind of work

81
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,520
brought you to a rouge shop?

82
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,110
Go home first.

83
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,670
- I'll tell you later. - Buyou.

84
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,470
I think

85
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,600
you'd better go back with Yue.

86
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:11,470
After all, you are known to be a henpecked husband.

87
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,800
Don't get yourself into trouble.

88
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,630
I...

89
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,000
You bought groceries?

90
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:19,830
Then hurry home

91
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,880
and make food.

92
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,440
Don't you see that I'm busy?

93
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,000
Go home first.

94
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,390
All right.

95
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,350
Buyou, it looks like

96
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,880
you call the shots at home.

97
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,070
Why do you have so much to say?

98
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,000
Can't you see I'm working on a case?

99
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,390
Just go about

100
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,200
your business.

101
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,480
That was his wife?

102
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,880
I think so.

103
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:18,640
Zhao Mo.

104
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,320
Are you sure you're making ice?

105
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,390
It's done?

106
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,070
Stay back.

107
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,950
Where's the fire lighter?

108
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,600
Fire lighter.

109
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,110
It's lit.

110
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,320
Father.

111
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,480
Father.

112
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,670
It flew.

113
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:19,830
That was how

114
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,270
the Hat Demon managed to fly.

115
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,550
Lady Wu.

116
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:35,480
Who is it?

117
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,070
It's me.

118
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,270
Zhao Buyou from the Kaifeng Court.

119
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,270
Please come in.

120
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,670
Mr. Zhao, what brings you here?

121
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,320
I just came back

122
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,550
and haven't made any tea.

123
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,000
Please take a seat.

124
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:50,830
Where is Wu Ao?

125
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,670
He went to the store.

126
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,950
I have a few questions for you.

127
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,720
Your eldest brother Wu Xiang

128
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,200
was in charge of the accounts, wasn't he?

129
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:08,350
He was an addicted gambler.

130
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:11,920
I heard that he had lost a lot of money recently

131
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,720
which had cost you the mansion.

132
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,390
I have no idea.

133
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,670
But this is

134
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,790
the hard-earned money

135
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,110
you and Wu Ao made

136
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,160
by selling homemade bao

137
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,440
from day to night.

138
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,230
Don't you feel bad?

139
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,760
Lady Wu.

140
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,110
Can you lift your sleeves

141
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,600
and show me your arms?

142
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,640
You and Wu Ao went to the clinic,

143
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,320
claiming that your arm was burned.

144
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,760
Correct me if I'm wrong.

145
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,830
It was caused by the lamp oil.

146
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,790
As you said,

147
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,760
Wu Xiang died on the second floor.

148
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,270
How did I go upstairs with my disability?

149
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,040
Is it possible

150
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,320
that you got off the wheelchair

151
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,760
and walked upstairs?

152
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,000
You may not know.

153
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,110
But a person who rides a wheelchair

154
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,720
rarely gets her shoes and the hem

155
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,110
of her dress dirty.

156
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:36,760
Besides, I saw Qibai Powder on the shelf of your dressing table.

157
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,080
Lady Wu from Wu's bao shop

158
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,790
recommended me this powder.

159
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,350
Lady Wu?

160
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,760
She uses my powder every day

161
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,230
and buys two boxes a month.

162
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,320
Would you like one?

163
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,550
It's so high up there. How do you reach it?

164
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,590
Do your brothers get it for you

165
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:54,400
every time you use it?

166
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,910
Judging from your expression,

167
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,200
I think I got it right.

168
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,550
That night,

169
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,280
You and Wu Ao came home

170
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,590
with the night watchman.

171
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,320
Xiang, we are back.

172
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:14,960
Xiang.

173
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,550
Xiang.

174
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:16,590
That was

175
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,910
how you hid the truth

176
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,710
about the murder.

177
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,110
Am I right?

178
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:27,440
Mr. Zhao.

179
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,240
Is it true

180
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,550
that you investigators only care about

181
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,000
the effect and not the cause?

182
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,030
I don't know about others.

183
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,150
But I believe

184
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,030
that there must be

185
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,790
a cause to every effect.

186
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,880
I would like you

187
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,230
to tell me about the cause.

188
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,760
Will you?

189
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,400
This is the old mansion

190
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:05,840
where my parents and I lived back in the day.

191
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,080
They made bao here

192
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,400
while Wu Ao and I played hide and seek in the yard.

193
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,000
Then we lost the mansion

194
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,080
and our parents died.

195
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,230
Wu Ao and I

196
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,400
were entrusted to Wu Xiang.

197
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,550
Wasn't Wu Xiang your brother by birth?

198
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:27,440
No.

199
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,000
He was our cousin.

200
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,200
He was nothing but a hooligan

201
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,760
who indulged in bad habits.

202
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,350
He made me pretend to be paralyzed,

203
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,960
making and selling bao

204
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,400
in a wheelchair for a living.

205
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,000
He said

206
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,640
that it would help us win the sympathy of diners

207
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,760
to make more money.

208
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:53,400
His method really worked.

209
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,590
Later,

210
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,320
the land price of Yanglou Street doubled.

211
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,640
I made money

212
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,790
and managed to buy this mansion back.

213
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,790
The money you made from Wu's bao shop?

214
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,670
But you know what?

215
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:16,200
Once we got better off,

216
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,350
Wu Xiang intensified his control over Wu Ao and me.

217
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,880
He was out there flirting with ladies.

218
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,150
Back home,

219
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,670
he even laid his hands on me.

220
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,230
Wu...

221
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,280
Wu Ao

222
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,030
has always been frail and sickly.

223
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:42,350
He was no match for Wu Xiang.

224
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,550
Every time he tried to defend me,

225
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,000
he ended up getting beaten up.

226
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,550
Wu Xiang started betting big

227
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,590
after he had money.

228
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,000
Actually that night,

229
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,640
he lost a fortune.

230
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:59,320
Give it here.

231
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,030
Xiang, please.

232
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:00,790
Give it here.

233
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:01,640
Give it here.

234
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,320
Give it to me.

235
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:02,910
Please.

236
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:03,880
Give it to me.

237
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,470
Please.

238
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,790
Give it here.

239
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,030
Give me that.

240
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,000
Xiang, please stop.

241
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,960
Spare Wu Ao and me.

242
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,710
Get lost.

243
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,550
Give it here.

244
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,320
But if we let him sell this mansion,

245
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,230
Wu Ao and I would have nothing to hold on to.

246
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:20,960
Go away.

247
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,470
That night,

248
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,300
Wu Ao struggled

249
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,880
to protect the property deed.

250
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,030
I'll strangle you!

251
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:31,150
I'll strangle you!

252
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,080
I'll strangle you!

253
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,280
Wu Xiang almost

254
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,280
strangled Wu Ao to death.

255
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,470
I was so scared.

256
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,910
I didn't know what to do.

257
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:39,760
I...

258
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,710
I just stood up

259
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:42,960
and held up the oil lamp.

260
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,880
I'll strangle you!

261
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,470
I ended up killing that evil man.

262
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,110
So it was the oil lamp.

263
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:04,760
Lady Wu.

264
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,150
I really understand

265
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,550
your immense courage to protect your family

266
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,200
at such a critical moment.

267
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,910
Thank you

268
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,320
for your trust.

269
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:29,280
Will you come with me to the Kaifeng Court?

270
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,470
Let's go to Inspector Gu

271
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,760
and tell him

272
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,350
everything that has happened

273
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,670
to seek a lenient punishment.

274
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,110
Are you okay?

275
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,350
Life hasn't been easy for her.

276
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,440
Don't be too harsh on her.

277
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:53,710
Rest assured.

278
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,840
I heard everything.

279
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,760
You surely know

280
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,550
how to ​​​​solve cases.

281
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,110
Well.

282
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,110
Let's grab a drink somewhere.

283
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,280
Tell me

284
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,400
what I should do to be like you.

285
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:09,960
Okay?

286
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,670
If you really want to learn,

287
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,910
be humble.

288
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,470
You're in trouble.

289
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,550
Help me.

290
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,760
Wan.

291
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,910
Go back first.

292
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:30,550
Okay?

293
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,550
Let's call it a day.

294
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,520
Go back.

295
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,400
All right.

296
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:34,790
Zhao Buyou.

297
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:35,840
I'll go back now.

298
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,400
Go ahead.

299
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,670
Wen Yue.

300
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,350
I was helping with the case.

301
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,280
It was work.

302
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,400
I was looking for clues back there.

303
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:54,780
You get it, right?

304
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:57,590
Zhao Buyou.

305
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,940
You didn't come home last night.

306
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,320
Explain yourself well

307
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,790
or I promise you won't be able

308
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,670
to even hold chopsticks, let alone have dinner.

309
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:10,150
I can explain.

310
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:10,910
Wen Yue.

311
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,200
I have a witness.

312
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,320
I swear.

313
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,910
Zhang Qiniang of Yanglou Street wanted to solve

314
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,110
the Hat Demon case

315
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,760
and offered a huge payment.

316
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:20,790
And I was like,

317
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,520
"This is the type of case I like."

318
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,840
So I took on the job.

319
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,790
Why did I do that?

320
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,590
Because I wanted to make money

321
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,000
to buy you a mansion.

322
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,470
So you're saying

323
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,230
that you did it for me?

324
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,520
Of course, I did it for you.

325
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:34,080
Do I need you to make money?

326
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,960
Now you're ambitious

327
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,710
about supporting the family.

328
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,200
Zhao Buyou.

329
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,030
Did you like Zhang Qiniang's rouge?

330
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:46,470
Oh, please.

331
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,200
I bet she likes how you peel

332
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,440
those iced lychees.

333
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,590
How about I hire a cart for you?

334
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,230
Pack your stuff

335
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,030
and move in with your Qiniang.

336
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,710
I will be happily free.

337
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:57,960
I was solving a case.

338
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,200
Why would you say that

339
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,960
to make Inspector Gu envy me?

340
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,030
Keep it to yourselves.

341
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,200
Don't drag me into this.

342
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,760
We've been married for so long.

343
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,000
Doesn't she know me?

344
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Aren't we a couple?

345
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,030
Yeah, I wonder.

346
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,110
But we're a couple.

347
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,350
We've been a couple for over a decade.

348
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:14,400
How come we're...

349
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,940
[Dagger]

350
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:19,020
Let go.

351
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:21,960
You just sold me out.

352
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:24,250
Let go.

353
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,640
Someone paid you

354
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,840
to kill Zhang Qiniang.

355
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,740
I bet

356
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,790
this person also hired Xiao Yishui.

357
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:34,030
He

358
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,080
kept you in the dark

359
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,640
lest you run away again.

360
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,440
So he came to me

361
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,960
and asked me to help him

362
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,320
uncover the truth.

363
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:43,910
And I

364
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,350
took him

365
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,520
to meet someone

366
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,000
at midnight yesterday.

367
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,590
[Fan Building]

368
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,200
Gentlemen, please come in.

369
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,670
Long time no see.

370
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:25,470
Your Excellency.

371
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,210
We'd like to consult you

372
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:28,780
[Commander Tao of Imperial Guard Department]

373
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,230
about something.

374
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,540
Enough.

375
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,680
Leave us alone.

376
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,400
Thank you, Commander.

377
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,760
Thank you, Commander.

378
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,950
So boring.

379
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,880
It's the same every day.

380
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,640
Well...

381
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,470
Why are you still here?

382
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,680

383

He's with me.

384
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:51,710
He's from the Kaifeng Court.

385
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,590
He met you when he was working

386
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,710
at the Office of Justice

387
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:55,400
back then.

388
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,110
He really admires you.

389
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:59,110
He insisted on tagging along today.

390
00:17:59,110 --> 00:17:59,760
Look at him.

391
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,310
So fair-looking

392
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,920
and well-mannered.

393
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,830
Come here.

394
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:05,680
Let me look at you.

395
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,310
I...

396
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:09,590
Come on.

397
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:10,760
Hurry up.

398
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:11,590
Well...

399
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,190
Your Excellency.

400
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,820
How dare you!

401
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:16,470
I am Gu Zhen's buddy.

402
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,040
Today, we're here to ask you

403
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,800
some questions.

404
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,760
Just answer

405
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:22,070
our questions.

406
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,430
Do you hear me?

407
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:26,800
Zhao Buyou.

408
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:28,420
You...

409
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:29,230
You...

410
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:29,760
I...

411
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,230
I like it.

412
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:36,920
Your Excellency.

413
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,190
You know what's happening

414
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:41,520
in the city much better than we do at the Kaifeng Court.

415
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,470
So

416
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:43,680
we'd like to

417
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,520
inquire about a woman.

418
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,830
We're here to drink.

419
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,070
Forget about women.

420
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,430
What a bummer.

421
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,040
You're right.

422
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,350
There is a woman

423
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:55,880
called Zhang Qiniang.

424
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,430
Have you heard of her?

425
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,830
Tell you what.

426
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,640
Zhang Qiniang's

427
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,680
foster father

428
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,120
is not someone we can mess with.

429
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,640
Her foster father is...?

430
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:09,350
We ran out.

431
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:12,640
Give it to me.

432
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,190
Let him...

433
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,040
I'll do it.

434
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:14,830
I'll go.

435
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:15,310
Hurry up.

436
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:16,310
- Zhao Buyou. - Buyou.

437
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,110
Hurry up.

438
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,190
Your Excellency, I'm back.

439
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:22,710
He's gone?

440
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:25,350
What was that?

441
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,230
If you hadn't stopped me,

442
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:28,280
I would have slapped him.

443
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,310
Tell you what?

444
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,230
Zhang Qiniang's foster father

445
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,110
is Mr. Zou

446
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,000
from the South.

447
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:48,800
Also,

448
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,520
he even has informants

449
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,400
in our Imperial Guard Department.

450
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:15,660
[Bath House]

451
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,680
Inspector Gu.

452
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,280
Do me a favor.

453
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,800
Don't tell my wife

454
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,800
what happened tonight.

455
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,400
Do me a favor, too.

456
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,110
What is it?

457
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,190
Don't tell Wan Fu

458
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:31,160
what happened tonight.

459
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,520
Once he learns about it,

460
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,230
everyone in the Kaifeng Court will know.

461
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,590
I thought...

462
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,920
Okay, you have my word.

463
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,560
So Zhang Qiniang is backed by the Zou family.

464
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,710
The person who gave the commission

465
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,310
appeared again.

466
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,280
So did the Hat Demon.

467
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,000
This is quite interesting.

468
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,920
Do you want to make 100 liang of gold

469
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,560
or not?

470
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,800
Of course, I do.

471
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,800
You are

472
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,470
the worst.

473
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:17,470
You caught me by my weak spot.

474
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,710
From what I know about your family,

475
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,950
you have what it takes to make the money.

476
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,130
Do you really think

477
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,760
I'm an ordinary citizen?

478
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,070
You have three days

479
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,560
to decide

480
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,310
if you will kill

481
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,520
Zhang Qiniang.

482
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:53,280
To wash off the rouge,

483
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,310
we used quite some soap

484
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,520
and wood ash.

485
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,640
Actually...

486
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,520
He wanted to

487
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:06,280
help you find the person who issued

488
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,040
the commissions

489
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:09,070
but didn't have a clue.

490
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:11,310
That's why he approached Zhang Qiniang

491
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,950
to see if she had any enemies.

492
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:15,350
The Hat Demon case happened right then,

493
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,230
obviously

494
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,920
targeting Zhang Qiniang.

495
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:20,560
We both thought

496
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,310
these two incidents were related.

497
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:23,520
Therefore,

498
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,640
he agreed

499
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:28,400
to look into the case for Zhang Qiniang.

500
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:32,190
Got it, Inspector Gu.

501
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:35,920
It's so hard for you officials to work on cases,

502
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,430
not to mention

503
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:38,680
that my husband

504
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
is just an ordinary citizen.

505
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,920
Zhao Buyou.

506
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,230
Do you feel

507
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,000
deeply wronged?

508
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,880
Just a little bit.

509
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:52,040
Do you feel great about yourself?

510
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,710
Just a little bit.

511
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:56,020
What's so great about you?

512
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,080
It's so simple.

513
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,350
Why didn't you just tell me?

514
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,280
Not in front of him.

515
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,680
You wanted me to misunderstand

516
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,430
your relationship with Zhang Qiniang.

517
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:04,710
What are you trying to hide?

518
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,110
Nothing.

519
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:07,400
Nothing?

520
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,710
There's nothing between us.

521
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,590
If you had made it clear,

522
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,310
would I have been jealous?

523
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,470
Is that what a couple would do?

524
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,470
Zhao Buyou.

525
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,680
You don't know me at all.

526
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:21,230
So tell me.

527
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:21,950
Tell me so that...

528
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:22,680
I'm going to cook.

529
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,310
We're not done here.

530
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,110
Inspector Gu.

531
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,470
This commission is for me, right?

532
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,430
Yeah.

533
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:31,680
Deal.

534
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:33,640
Wen Yue.

535
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,830
Wen Yue.

536
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,430
I don't quite get it.

537
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,230
She took on the mission

538
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:41,160
and grabbed the groceries.

539
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,520
Is she mad at you

540
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,950
or not?

541
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,110
Inspector Gu.

542
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:50,110
You are still single.

543
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,520
I'm afraid

544
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,000
you don't get this.

545
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,470
Don't you see?

546
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:56,040
Two women

547
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,520
fought for me.

548
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,040
So this is a battle

549
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,800
between two women to win you over.

550
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,880
Go home.

551
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,280
Does Zhang Qiniang

552
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,710
really like me so much

553
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:13,400
as to destroy my family?

554
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,800
Zhao Buyou.

555
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,430
Let me remind you.

556
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,880
At this point, you have

557
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,160
two days left.

558
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,400
Master.

559
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:53,590
The meeting with all the elders is in two days.

560
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,310
Everything is ready.

561
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,830
Please take a look.

562
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,520
Are those old men

563
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,250
so eager to see me

564
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,640
because they miss me?

565
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,710
I'm afraid it's because

566
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:08,000
the land prices plummeted

567
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,560
due to the Hat Demon case.

568
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:11,760
Those old men

569
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,400
got anxious

570
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:16,310
and wanted an explanation from you.

571
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:18,160
I'm too bored to see them.

572
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:20,310
Talk to them on my behalf.

573
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,400
Understood.

574
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,950
What if

575
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:26,190
your foster father asks about it?

576
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,710
Do you know how this quail soup is made,

577
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,710
Commander Kang?

578
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:40,560
It's stewed with the tongues

579
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,640
of hundreds of quails.

580
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,230
There's nothing you don't know, Commander Kang.

581
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,680
Does my foster father

582
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,470
have to know such a trivial matter?

583
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,190
No, he doesn't.

584
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,160
Whoever talks too much

585
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,230
and upsets my foster father

586
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,760
would be upsetting me as well.

587
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,160
I dare not.

588
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,190
Of course, I know

589
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:12,760
why my foster father

590
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,470
sent you to work for me.

591
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:18,040
Commander Kang,

592
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:20,190
please speak nicely of me.

593
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,430
Please rest assured, Master.

594
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,190
I dare not speak rashly.

595
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:29,160
You scared me and I lost my appetite.

596
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,680
Since you're so talkative,

597
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,590
this stew

598
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,190
is the best for you.

599
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,830
Have it when it's warm.

600
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:47,640
It won't taste so good once it turns cold.

601
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,760
Your sister-in-law cooks...

602
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,920
So well.

603
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,230
The last one.

604
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:46,640
Wen Yue, this cinnamon-vine soup is so nice.

605
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,280
Want some more?

606
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:50,590
That's enough.

607
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:51,560
I'm stuffed.

608
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,110
Buyou.

609
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,640
I heard you caught the real culprit.

610
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,950
It was Lady Wu.

611
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:01,470
Does that mean

612
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:03,110
Sun Bo has cleared his name?

613
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,070
I'll go

614
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:07,000
to the Kaifeng Court and ask Inspector Gu.

615
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,110
Okay.

616
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:09,920
Dig in.

617
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,640
I'm also stuffed.

618
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:15,190
Enjoy the meal.

619
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,000
You're going to the Kaifeng Court again?

620
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,110
I'll go with you.

621
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:28,190
I'll go

622
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:28,950
wherever you go.

623
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,920
What's wrong?

624
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,470
Got a problem?

625
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:36,160
I was assigned a job.

626
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,710
I have to figure out

627
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,350
what's going on here.

628
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:45,830
Let's go together.

629
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,520
I'll take you there.

630
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:59,720
The weather is dry. Be careful of fire.

631
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,680
Are you sure this is the place?

632
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,560
They say all the errand boys live here.

633
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,000
They must pass by from here.

634
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,710
So we can't miss him if we wait here.

635
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,920
It's only been one hour.

636
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:20,280
Why are you hungry again?

637
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,400
You ate a lot.

638
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:28,920
But you're hungry, too.

639
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:35,920
Don't even think about it.

640
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,310
I bought this for Bo.

641
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:52,640
You...

642
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,190
Where did you get this?

643
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:55,880
You never make plans

644
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,070
about your pocket money.

645
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,830
I bought it on the way.

646
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,430
I'm going to eat it.

647
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:03,000
Here we go.

648
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,070
Take a bite.

649
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,830
I can't enjoy it alone

650
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,280
when you're so hungry.

651
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,470
Thank you, Ban.

652
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:23,800
Only one bite.

653
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,590
Zhao Mo, you...!

654
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:34,280
Spit it out!

655
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,160
Spit it out!

656
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,040
Excuse me.

657
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:38,220
- Sorry. - Are you okay, miss?

658
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,190
I'm okay.

659
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:40,830
Are you looking for

660
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:41,760
someone?

661
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,160
We're looking for Sun Bo.

662
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:45,000
Sun Bo?

663
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:46,350
I don't know him.

664
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:48,950
We're looking for the errand boy.

665
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,000
Yi.

666
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
You got visitors.

667
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:54,000
Please wait here.

668
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,190
Thank you.

669
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:55,920
Thank you.

670
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,760
Who is it?

671
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,190
Bo and I rented this room together.

672
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,430
That's his bed.

673
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,640
It's 300 wen per month.

674
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,520
We split the rent.

675
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,560
It's very affordable.

676
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,350
Why don't you sit down?

677
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:21,280
No need.

678
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,680
Where is Sun Bo?

679
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:25,160
He must have suffered in jail these days.

680
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,880
He left for errands.

681
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:28,110
You just missed him.

682
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:30,680
He's working right after he got released?

683
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:31,920
Is everything fine?

684
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:32,950
Did he

685
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,400
suffer in jail?

686
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,000
Who doesn't suffer in jail?

687
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,350
But people like us

688
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,470
can't afford to be fragile.

689
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,000
How many jobs

690
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,310
have he missed these days?

691
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,680
He's rushing to make money.

692
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:45,830
So where did he go?

693
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,950
Somewhere around Mahang Street,

694
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,190
I suppose.

695
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:53,000
Then we'll take our leave.

696
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:54,640
Take care.

697
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:56,520
Sorry for the trouble.

698
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:58,760
We're off.

699
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,190
I thought we were

700
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,880
living a hard life.

701
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,000
But I saw Sun Bo's place and realized

702
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,430
that it was incomparable.

703
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,230
Bo's family used to be quite wealthy.

704
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,710
Next time you see him,

705
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:22,830
don't ask him so directly.

706
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:24,310
It would hurt his feelings.

707
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:27,520
Do you really see me

708
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,800
as an insensible fool?

709
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,070
Aren't you?

710
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,430
So what should I do?

711
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:37,430
Give me the rest of your money.

712
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,310
I'll buy him a gift on your behalf.

713
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,800
It should be something

714
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,760
he can use now.

715
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,070
What else

716
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,110
can I do?

717
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:58,430
Go back and watch our father play.

718
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,230
Buyou and Wen Yue went to see Inspector Gu.

719
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:01,920
Our father is left alone.

720
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,350
Don't let him lose everything.

721
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:03,950
Go ahead.

722
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:04,470
I'm off.

723
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:05,400
Wait.

724
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:06,680
Hold it.

725
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,280
Here.

726
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,800
Take this with you.

727
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,160
Just in case you run into him.

728
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,400
Do you have anything more practical here?

729
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:21,950
This one.

730
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:28,800
Hat Demon.

731
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,880
The Hat Demon is back!

732
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,400
Run!

733
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:37,930
Run!

734
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,400
The Hat Demon is here.

735
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,880
The Hat Demon. Run!

736
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:45,800
Run!

737
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:01,680
Isn't that Commander Kang working for Zhang Qiniang?

738
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,880
How did he become like this?

739
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,110
It's him.

740
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:05,400
It's him.

741
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:07,640
He's dead.

742
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:09,230
The Hat Demon killed someone again.

743
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,470
Another man down!

744
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:20,150
Stay back.

745
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,630
The Hat Demon is moving.

746
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,430
Stay back.

747
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:24,150
Didn't they catch the culprit?

748
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,520
I thought it was a fraud.

749
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,670
There's black smoke.

750
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:31,520
It looks different from the Hat Demon last time.

751
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:32,520
Be careful.

752
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,840
It may kill someone else.

753
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,710
Stay away.

754
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:58,430
I don't mind if you temper with my vegetables.

755
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,360
But if you touch my pine tree,

756
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:01,800
I swear I'll kill you.

757
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,080
Why are you here?

758
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,840
Well...

759
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,630
How's it going with the case

760
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:10,520
of the Wu family?

761
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:12,710
She confessed.

762
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:13,840
She said

763
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,280
it was all her doing

764
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,670
and Wu Ao was innocent.

765
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:18,760
What about Wu Ao?

766
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:20,040
We let him go.

767
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,800
Why did you let him go?

768
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:23,520
Lady Wu already said that...

769
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:25,190
Wait.

770
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,190
My wife is here too.

771
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:30,280
She insisted on tagging along.

772
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:31,950
Tell her as well.

773
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:32,520
Wait.

774
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,320
Wen Yue, come here.

775
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:36,950
Inspector Gu

776
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,360
wants to analyze the case.

777
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,190
Join us there.

778
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,040
I can hear you.

779
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:42,950
Inspector Gu.

780
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,670
Louder, please.

781
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,670
Why did you let him go?

782
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:52,470
Wu Qiao said

783
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,760
that she did everything on her own

784
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:58,190
and Wu Ao was innocent.

785
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:01,470
I have neither witnesses

786
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,390
nor evidence.

787
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:04,670
What did she say

788
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,870
about the Hat Demon?

789
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,630
Wen Yue.

790
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,600
About the Hat Demon,

791
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,040
Wu Qiao said

792
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,560
that it was all her doing.

793
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,120
But

794
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,390
she couldn't clarify

795
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,600
any details I asked about.

796
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:28,080
I only know for sure

797
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,040
that Lady Wu killed Wu Xiang

798
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,560
on a whim.

799
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,760
Meanwhile, Wu Ao

800
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,840
could be an accomplice.

801
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,560
However,

802
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:37,280
they have nothing

803
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:39,040
to do with the Hat Demon.

804
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:43,910
The Hat Demon case is a cover for their crimes.

805
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,800
Their whole family knows.

806
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,950
That's why I let go of Wu Ao.

807
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,080
I did it to see

808
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:55,760
who he would meet in private.

809
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:01,950
Brilliant move.

810
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,430
You old fox.

811
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,040
He did well.

812
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,320
It's like setting a bait.

813
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,280
Wen Yue.

814
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:10,150
Buyou.

815
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:12,840
What's wrong, Mo?

816
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,000
Easy.

817
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,600
That...

818
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:16,910
- That... - Easy.

819
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:17,910
What is it?

820
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:18,470
The Hat Demon?

821
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,910
Zhang Qiniang barged into our house

822
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:20,870
with a group of people.

823
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,000
I didn't invite her.

824
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,280
I didn't.

825
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,360
This is impressive.

826
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,950
So impressive.

827
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,470
Look.

828
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:44,360
The color.

829
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,760
Exactly.

830
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,670
So luxurious.

831
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,950
Two horses!

832
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,230
Is she

833
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,390
a fairy from heaven

834
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:56,320
or

835
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,360
a lady from the palace?

836
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,000
So luxurious.

837
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:01,360
Laoba.

838
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,710
Don't you say you know many big shots?

839
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,670
Do you know Zhang Qiniang?

840
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,840
Qiniang?

841
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:12,320
Well...

842
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,840
Back when I was in the Lord's Mansion,

843
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,360
we often drank together.

844
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:18,950
She's a lady from the palace.

845
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,520
The Zhao family are said to be relatives of the royal clan.

846
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:22,950
Now I believe it.

847
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:23,950
Me too.

848
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:24,960
- Right? - Seriously.

849
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,190
These are gold bars.

850
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,120
Buyou is here.

851
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:35,800
Buyou.

852
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,040
Buyou, you're back.

853
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:37,920
- Yue. - Buyou.

854
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:40,840
Buyou, what's going on?

855
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,600
Talk later.

856
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,520
Talk later.

857
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:44,630
Move. It's my home.

858
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:46,230
He's my brother.

859
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:48,760
We are neighbors.

860
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:53,230
It looks better now, right?

861
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,760
So beautiful.

862
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,710
After your trimming,

863
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:59,600
it actually has a classy vibe of the royal family.

864
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,120
Lady Zhang, you flatter me.

865
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:05,560
Your presence

866
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,470
brings such an exuberant vibe to my humble residence.

867
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,120
Father.

868
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,560
Shhh.

869
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,600
Buyou.

870
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,230
We're admiring flowers.

871
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,230
I recall a poem by my friend.

872
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:25,280
This mundane life is too short to spare me joyful moments.

873
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:29,390
Who would hold on to wealth over one genuine smile?

874
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:33,150
Holding the wine cup, I persuade the setting sun

875
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:37,150
to cast its brilliance on the flowers a little longer for my friends.

876
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,360
Great verses.

877
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:41,910
Father.

878
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:42,430
I'm flattered.

879
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,430
Put the verses aside

880
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:45,520
for a second, please.

881
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,120
Lady Zhang.

882
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:49,080
What are you doing at my house?

883
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,040
Why did you decorate our house like this?

884
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:55,120
Because

885
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,000
I'm going to live here.

886
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,470
What's that attitude?

887
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,870
We're having a guest.

888
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:03,870
What's the fuss?

889
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:04,760
Exactly.

890
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,600
Lady Zhang.

891
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:07,470
I'll plant and grow

892
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,950
whatever flowers you like.

893
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:11,600
Really?

894
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,150
Yeah.

895
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,760
Can you teach me?

896
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,000
Of course.

897
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:17,710
That would be great.

898
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:20,520
Then I don't have to hire a horticulture consultant.

899
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,470
No need.

900
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,520
That's great.

901
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:24,190
Mo.

902
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,320
Help our father into his room.

903
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:27,190
Back to my room.

904
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,390
Wen.

905
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:31,670
I bet you can tell.

906
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,230
Lady Zhang

907
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:35,040
must be an amazing lady

908
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,870
who appreciates both the refined and the popular

909
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:39,190
and knows all kinds of art.

910
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:41,150
I happen to have some calligraphy and painting

911
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:41,950
under my bed.

912
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:44,600
I love calligraphy and painting.

913
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:45,360
Really?

914
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:46,670
Hurry up.

915
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:47,120
Okay.

916
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,560
I'll get them.

917
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,360
- Okay. - Let's enjoy them.

918
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:55,600
Hurry up.

919
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:57,260
Father.

920
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:57,870
Father.

921
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,320
Lady Zhang, let's cut to the chase.

922
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:04,580
What do you want?

923
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:11,280
Buyou.

924
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,950
You said you would help me catch the Hat Demon.

925
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:18,670
But this Hat Demon is getting out of control.

926
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,360
Even my housekeeper

927
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,760
fell victim to it just now.

928
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:22,800
Tell me.

929
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:25,320
Is it going to be my turn next?

930
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,390
I'm so scared.

931
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:32,870
You don't look like someone who would be afraid.

932
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:34,470
Exactly.

933
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,670
Only a fool

934
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:38,080
is scared of nothing.

935
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,520
I'm in the light

936
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,950
while my enemy is in the dark.

937
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,040
I can't be at ease.

938
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:51,840
Now I get it.

939
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,320
You wouldn't think

940
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,360
that my wife and I somehow made a Hat Demon,

941
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,290
would you?

942
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,670
That's hilarious.

943
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:01,120
She thought we did it?

944
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,520
How could it be us?

945
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,710
If it were me,

946
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:06,430
I would also suspect that.

947
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:07,080
Yeah.

948
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,120
We appeared when the Hat Demon showed up.

949
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,840
It's quite suspicious.

950
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:20,870
I just love how straightforward you are, Yue.

951
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:23,870
If it's really just a coincidence,

952
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,120
then you're sent to me by fate.

953
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:29,360
Yue, Buyou.

954
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,470
One is brave and the other is wise.

955
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,390
When I'm with you,

956
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:34,670
I'm sure

957
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:37,150
that the Hat Demon won't dare to pick on me.

958
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:40,710
Buyou, Wen Yue.

959
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,390
I caught the Hat Demon.

960
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:43,670
She's my sister.
