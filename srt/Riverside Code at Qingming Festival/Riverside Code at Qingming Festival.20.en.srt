This was

21

found

22

It's a Missing Person Notice for Song Yingying.

24

Song Yingying died

25
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,620
very horribly.

26
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,630
Her body

27

In her mouth and nose.

30
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,720
Before she died,

31
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,440
she must have been brutally tortured...

32
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,160
And beaten.

33
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,630
Why did she die in the same way as the case

35
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,830
The man who died at Fan Tower was likely

36

46
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,080
just now,

47
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,630
Tie Chi came to report

48
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,360
that the embroidery found here

49
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,670
was made by the same stitching

50
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,520
as that

51
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,670
red silk.

52
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,320
Could it mean that all those women

53
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,960
were killed in the same way as Song Yingying?

54
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,880
We can confirm Song Yingying

55
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:36,880
is the only one

56
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,320
who have been killed shortly after she went missing.

57
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,910
Lu Sanzhen buried Song Yingying.

58
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,360
Then,

59
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46,190
due to some certain

60
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,110

61
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,000
someone committed a murder case at Fan Tower.

62
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,110
After those three people were tortured,

63
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,030
they were hung upside down in ink

64
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,240
and died from suffocation.

65
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,030
Then, Lu Sanzhen

66

pawned his property.

00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,960

But where is Ci now?

69
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,010
Isn't there a woman

70
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,760
in black who acted stealthily?

71
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,240
Could she be Ci?

72
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,280
The embroidery workshop is certainly involved.

73
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,030
And the stains

74
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,470

75
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,670

if anyone came looking for her,

96
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,950
I should give the package to that person.

97

192
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,550
Mrs. Lan just gave us these two.

193
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,910
You can't ask her for more.

194
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,080
Please, come on.

195
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,000
Okay.

196
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,470
Let's go now.

197
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,150
Keep some food for me.

198
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:35,960
Okay.

199
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,840
Come on, let's go.

200
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,280
Let's go.

201
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,670
Here, eat more.

202
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,400
Here.

203
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,110
Since you've asked them to come back,

204
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:48,910
aren't you

205
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,110
going to say something?

206
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:50,840
Yeah, brother.

207
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,550
Since you've called me back,

208
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,550
aren't you going to tell me

209
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,350
the things I want to know?

210
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,760
Yeah, I asked you to come back

211
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,080
to talk about

212
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,280
the things you two did

213
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,030
when you were naughty kids.

214
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,350
Yeah.

215
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:09,710
It's about you were naughty.

216
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,400
- Well... - Naughty?

217
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,880
Someone is coming.

218
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,790
- Open the door, dear. - Someone is coming?

219
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:16,710
Yes.

220
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,470
Shut up.

221
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,200
Wen.

222
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,470
Mr. Chen and Mrs. Chen?

223
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,000
Come in please.

224
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,000
- Alright. - Dear.

225
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,740
I asked them to come.

226
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:30,840
Come on.

227
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,590
It's been a while.

228
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,030
Yes. It's been a long time.

229
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:32,840
Have a seat.

230
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,470
Dear, have a seat.

231
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,030
Buyou.

232
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:36,470
Hello.

233
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,910
My father just went out.

234
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,640
Let me introduce them to you.

235
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,200
They were

236
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:45,280
our neighbors

237
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,200
when we lived in the old house.

238
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,790
They are Mr. Chen and Mrs. Chen.

239
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:50,150
They even held you when you were little.

240
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:50,960
- Yes. - Yeah.

241
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,790
Right.

242
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,200
Here is the thing,

243
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,550
well,

244
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,710
they kept asking me

245
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,470
about their childhood

246
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:58,960
and background.

247
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,960
I didn't know how to tell them.

248
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:03,200
That's why

249
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,790
I called you here

250
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:06,590
to tell them.

251
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,030
You may

252
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,760
tell them.

253
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,080
I won't. You will do it.

254
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,450
You do it.

255
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:15,590
Mrs. Chen.

256
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,110
You may tell us.

257
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,790
Go ahead.

258
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,000
In my memory,

259
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,640
it happened

260
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,400
more than ten years ago.

261
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,200
Yes.

262
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:31,440
Two beautiful ladies suddenly

263
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,350
came to your house,

264
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,710
each with a child.

265
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,710
Zhao Li,

266
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:38,110
you bastard!

267
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,080
What sweet promise did you make to me?

268
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,440
I can't believe I was bewitched by you

269
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,840
and had a baby for you.

270
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,400
You said

271
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,640
if my baby is a boy,

272
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,520
you'd marry me in a grand wedding.

273
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:49,350
But now?

274
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,790
I've brought you the baby!

275
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:51,590
As his father,

276
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:52,760
how could you refuse him?

277
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:53,760
I'm telling you.

278
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,710
You can avoid us for a short while

279
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:55,710
but not forever.

280
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,550
I must get even with you today!

281
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,470
Are you a man or not, Zhao Li?

282
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:58,960
Enough.

283
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,880
Yeah, that's what happened.

284
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,670
Yeah.

285
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,440
So, Ban and I

286
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,520
were the babies you mentioned?

287
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:10,500
Yes.

288
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,370
Those two women

289
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,490
were our mothers?

290
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,790
Yes.

291
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:20,960
Then,

292
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,910
who were they?

293
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,000
Your father, Zhao Li,

294
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,200
was a playboy.

295
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,440
He often went to the brothels.

296
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,280
He probably met your mothers there.

297
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,150
Let me explain it in a simple way.

298
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,520
Our mother

299
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,030
is not the same person,

300
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,150
but we have the same father.

301
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:52,640
So, we are a family.

302
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,350
Yeah.

303
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,550
A family.

304
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,840
Didn't we agree to tell them the truth?

305
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,760
I would have wanted to.

306
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:19,790
But when I thought

307
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,960
about the connection between Dong Qian and Zou Mian,

308
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:25,960
as well as the case at Fan Tower,

309
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,280
I was afraid that they would keep

310
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,280
investigating once they knew the truth.

311
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,520
It'd be dangerous.

312
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,790
How long do you plan to hide it from them?

313
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,320
Play it by ear.

314
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,080
Maybe after everything is settled.

315
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,280
Dear,

316
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,440
it's pretty late now.

317
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,110
Don't go back to the umbrella shop tonight.

318
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,080
I think the orderer will show up again.

319
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,180
[The crimes of Dong Qian are fully recorded here.]

320
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,200
Don't you feel cold?

321
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,960
Is something troubling you?

322
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:07,960
Do you believe

323
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,470
what they said?

324
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,000
I have no idea.

325
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,880
Mo,

326
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:21,880
should we stop now?

327
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,350
I'm also curious about my identity.

328
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,960
When I helped Su to look for her mother,

329
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,380
I also wondered

330
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,580
what kind of a woman my mother was.

331
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:42,280
But I'm also afraid to know the truth.

332
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,550
I wonder if I'd be even sadder

333
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:47,640
than when I was called a child

334
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,670
without a mother.

335
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,910
I'm not as brave as you are.

336
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,470
I'm happy with the life we have now.

337
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:02,550
Since we are living together,

338
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,190
I'm satisfied enough.

339
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,590
Buyou is such an honest man.

340
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,520
Don't torture him anymore, okay?

341
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,280
I feel sorry for him.

342
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,800
If I encounter something,

343
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,590
I'll always investigate it

344
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:22,460
thoroughly.

345
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,230
I always thought I was right.

346
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,710
But when I saw Buyou

347
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:29,590
in an awkward position,

348
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,520
I hesitated.

349
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,560
I believe that Buyou has his own reason.

350
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,190
Let's wait then.

351
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,950
Quit investigating.

352
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,000
Anyway,

353
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:45,640
I can't find

354
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,230
the truth on my own.

355
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,070
I won't ask him anymore.

356
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,920
Promise me.

357
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:52,230
I promise.

358
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,280
Finally, you won't be hard on him.

359
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,590
I didn't want to be hard on him.

360
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,880
Then move back.

361
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:58,860
He'll be happy

362
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,080
to see you move back.

363
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,800
I'll sleep at home tonight.

364
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,040
Although sometimes you are

365
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,520
quite stubborn

366
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,950
and annoying,

367
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,590
you are always my dear brother.

368
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,950
Zhao Ban!

369
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:22,710
Fine,

370
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:23,470
I'm stubborn

371
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,800
while you are not.

372
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,560
Fine, after we buy a new house,

373
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,520
I'll live in the southern-facing room.

374
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,400
Anyway,

375
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,430
the southern-facing room is mine.

376
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:32,230
Wait!

377
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,800
Zhao Mo, Wen Yue agreed to let me

378
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,110
live in the southern-facing room.

379
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,000
I don't care.

380
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,400
Zhao Mo!

381
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,350
How could you do this?

382
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,000
Bed time.

383
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:48,110
- Bed time. - Ban.

384
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,110
What's this?

385
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,880
This is called trotting horse lamp.

386
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,950
Mo made it for me.

387
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,590
Mo is so clever.

388
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,680
He is

389
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,110
sometimes clever

390
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,920
but sometimes stupid.

391
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,190
Sometimes he treats me well,

392
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,950
but sometimes he goes against me.

393
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:14,950
He's pretty complicated.

394
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:16,880
Ban,

395
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:21,070
who gave you these then?

396
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,160
This

397
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,400
was given by my father.

398
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,520
It's pretty old.

399
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,430
This was given by Buyou.

400
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,280
They always

401
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,310
think I'm a child

402
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,310
who can never be mature.

403
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,310
Ban,

404
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,190
are you mature enough now?

405
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:41,950
Not yet.

406
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,110
Ban,

407
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,400
why are there

408
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,920
so many herbs in your room?

409
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,520
Because I always

410
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,520
want to be a physician.

411
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,400
Wen Yue supports me.

412
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,800
She prepared these for me.

413
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,560
But I failed

414
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,590
to be a physician.

415
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,680
Then I felt

416
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,640
that I could be a coroner.

417
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,350
Wen Yue

418
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,710
still

419
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,590
supports me.

420
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:15,710
So, I became a coroner.

421
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,120
What do you want to be?

422
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,600
Su,

423
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,620
don't worry.

424
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:42,100
I've already found out the "Ci Rou"

425
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,800
your mother embroidered on the handkerchief.

426
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,680
I will go ask about it tomorrow.

427
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:57,920
Why aren't my name and Ban's name

428
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,310
on the family record?

429
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:00,000
Mo and I

430
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,280
can't possibly not belong to this family, right?

431
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,400
Twenty years ago,

432
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,950
my family died right in front of me.

433
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,830
Buyou,

434
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:20,070
thank you for taking care of us during these years.

435
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,520
Run!

436
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:51,760
Mother!

437
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:15,110
Ban,

438
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,470
you are leaving so early.

439
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,830
You are early, too.

440
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,350
Ban.

441
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,800
Yao He?

442
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,710
Are you

443
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,680
going to work or have you just finished it?

444
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,590
Just finished my work.

445
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,800
Just finished it?

446
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,070
Why so late?

447
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,160
Did you conduct an autopsy last night?

448
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,110
Why didn't you call me?

449
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,280
No,

450
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,310
how dare I conduct an autopsy alone at night?

451
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,310
So what did you do last night?

452
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,280
I went to the court

453
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,430
and copied the autopsy record.

454
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,430
I fell asleep as I was so tired.

455
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,350
You know what?

456
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:48,040
There were a lot of mosquitoes.

457
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,520
That's why I came back till now.

458
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,430
You may sleep in the autopsy room

459
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,000
which has much fewer mosquitoes.

460
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,020
Mosquitoes don't often bite me anyway.

461
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,190
Where are you going?

462
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:02,560
I will look for clues about Su's mother.

463
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,800
I have to go.

464
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,830
Let me go with you.

465
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:06,070
No, I'm good.

466
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,190
Just go home and have a rest.

467
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,230
I'm fine. I often

468
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:09,070
stayed up.

469
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,070
No.

470
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,280
If you die,

471
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,110
who will teach me then?

472
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:15,830
Are you sure you go alone?

473
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,000
Yes, I'm sure.

474
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:17,920
Okay,

475
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,920
see you then.

476
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,370
See you.

477

Ban,

478
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,310
I will cook for you.

479
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:30,920
Okay.

480
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,570
See you.

481
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,300
- Your ox is good. - Look.

482
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,210
Yes, I fed them with good grains.

483
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,210
It's surely strong.

484
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,180
Really?

485
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,920
Yeah, it eats good grains.

486
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,090
It eats what I eat.

487
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:49,320
What are you chatting about?

488
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,300
Your ox is good.

489
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,350
Little rooster, you are so beautiful.

490
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,470
Yeah?

491
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,560
I raised it.

492
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,160
Beautiful.

493
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,640
Its feather looks so nice.

494
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,520
Yeah.

495
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:11,680
Morning.

496
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,190
You are up?

497
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:14,190
Father,

498
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:17,230
why are Mo and Ban both not at home?

499
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,350
I have no idea.

500
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,800
Well,

501
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,920
Mo went to work.

502
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,230
I had a dream about my mother last night

503
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,920
and cried bitterly.

504
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,950
To comfort me,

505
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:31,710
Ban went to look for my mother.

506
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,920
Little rooster, come out.

507
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,040
Come out.

[Ci Rou Women's Mutual Aid Society]

509
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,400
Hello! Anyone here?

510
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,040
Lady.

511
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,920
May I help you?

512
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,350
I wonder if this handkerchief

513
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,800
belongs here.

514
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,830
This was embroidered by a lady in the mutual aid society.

515
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:37,070
It's only exchanged among members.

516
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:39,310
How did you get it?

517
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,230
It was left by Ci

518
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:44,400
and Song Yingying.

519
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:46,590
I'd like to know about them.

520
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:47,920
That's why I came here.

521
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,470
So, you were introduced by Ci and Yingying.

522
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:54,070
Let's go to the rear hall then.

523
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:56,560
Let's have some tea and talk about the details.

524

Have they come here recently?

525
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,190
I was just asking.

526
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:02,160
All of our members are close.

527
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,400
How can I just let you stand here to talk?

any news about those two people?

Ban went to look for Ci again.

533
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:27,430
After all, Ci's a suspect,

534
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,920
and I feel a bit worried.

535
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,280
Have you posted their

to the homes of the missing girls

What does Ci Rou mean?

546
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,470
It seems

547
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:00,830
to be a place where women are taught needlework,

548
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:01,830
located in Wuxue Alley.

549
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,280

550
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,640
in the embroidery workshop.

551
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:10,230
Ban also saw one in Song Yingying's room.

552
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,640
She said Ci also has one.

00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,040
When she came here three days ago,

576
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,640
what did she do?

577
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,590
As you did,

578
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:24,830
she came to ask about Yingying.

579
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:26,350
Ask about Yingying?

580
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:32,070
No way.

581
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,280
Yingying had already...

582
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,400
Yingying had already died by that time.

583
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,310
Right?

584
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:42,190
Maybe she was like you,

585
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:44,430

what are we searching for?

Anything suspect.

Mr. Zhao,

I want to tell you something.

608
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,230
I went to Kaifeng Court

609
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:38,310
and I was told that you might be here.

610
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,000

that case at Fan Tower?

612
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,830

that the girls on the red silk

We often quarreled recently.

640
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,110
I was so furious that day

641
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,710
and ran away out of anger.

642
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,070
Mrs. Xie.

643
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,000

00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,160
- Mrs. Xie. - to meet you on the street.

Where are you going?

646
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:19,680
I thought

647
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,110
since Lady Wen could make umbrellas,

648
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,710
Xi could butcher pigs,

649
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,280
and even Mrs. Mu could

650
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:26,880
make a living as a matchmaker,

651
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,350
I should

652
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:30,350
also learn some skills

to make a living.

654
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,280
That's why I went

655
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,830
to the Ci Rou Mutual Aid Society.

656
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:43,400
But I didn't expect...

659
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,040
I went to that place

660
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,350
and had some tea.

661
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,560
Then, I passed out.

662
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,280
They used this method to abduct women

663
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,950
and then imprison them here.

00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,560

668
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:17,920

We won't be able to go out.

677
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:45,230
We will be beaten if they catch us.

678
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,760
Every time they took someone out,

679
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,070
their eyes were blindfolded.

680
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:50,800
No one knew the way here.

681
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:54,000
No, we have to find a way.

682
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:55,350
How about this?

683
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,110
Let me go have a check.

685
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,310
I will come back to save you.

You want to run away?

746

748
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:36,280
she's new here.

749
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,390
She doesn't know the rules.

750
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,390
We didn't want to escape.

751
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,710
We were

752
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:42,080
too hungry.

753
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,800
You didn't want to escape?

754
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:46,670
Then,

755
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:47,560
why did you come here?

756
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:50,230
I was merciful

757
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:52,080
to allow you to recuperate in the room.

758
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:55,000
Yet you are so ungrateful.

759
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:56,630
Don't touch her!

760
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,000
Master.

761
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,000
We know we are wrong.

762
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,280
Please spare us.

763
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:06,000
You are so dirty.

764
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,470
You stained my eyes.

765
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,950
Who are you?

766
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:12,360
How could you bully her?

She needs to be taught well.

774

Harming others is a crime.

Let me tell you,

780

According to the Law of the Great Song Dynasty,

781
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,290
if a husband hurts his wife, the penalty is reduced

782
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,910
by two levels compared to harming others.

783
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,040
If he harms a concubine, the penalty is reduced by another two levels.

784

if a wife harms her husband,

788
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,360
the penalty is increased by one level.

789
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,320
As a woman,

790
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:10,430
it's important to know your place.

Fine,

Don't let these two women ruin our mood.

The East Capital of the Song Dynasty had a vast and complex layout.

888

The city heavily relied on its intricate network of canals.
