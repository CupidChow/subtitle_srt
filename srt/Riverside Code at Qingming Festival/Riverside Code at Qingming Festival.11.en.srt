The fact that this young lady can taste the greasiness

42
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,440
is not because she is being picky.

43
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,110
It's just that she has a sharp taste.

No, absolutely not.

Those who are in love with each other

117
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,270

That was his motivation.

123
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,560
But why would he want to

I've already set him free.

131
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,030
But I didn't tell

If you can write the bill of complaint for free,

169
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,240
could you

170
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,680
write one for Sun Bo as well?

171
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,470

If you want me to help Sun Bo,

177
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,120
please tell me what you know of him.

178
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,870
Can you do that?

179
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,710
We've known each other ever since we were kids.

180
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,430
Tell me about it.

181
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,800
We grew up together in Yanglou Street.

182
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:57,960
There weren't

183

many children of the same age in the street.

184

Only a few of us got to hang out with each other.

185
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,680
I remember when Sun Bo was still a child,

186
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,310
his family was quite well-off.

187
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,710
How did it sink into poverty?

188
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,030
He was born into a rich family.

189
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,520
But his father was a gullible man.

190
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,400
When the rumor spread about the Hat Demon,

191
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,400
someone fooled him and talked him

192
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,990
into selling the house passed down from his ancestors.

193
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,120
But he didn't get much money from it.

194
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,120
His dad then got drunk every day.

195
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,240
He became a gambler

196
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,840
and ruined the entire family.

197
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:30,520
In a fit of temper,

198
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,680
Sun Bo's mother

199
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,800
pushed his dad into the river

200
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,630
when he was drunk, resulting to his death.

201
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,590
Then his mother jumped into the river and killed herself.

202
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,240
Since then,

203
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,710
Sun Bo was all alone.

204
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,270
I stole some bao

205
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,510
from the restaurant and gave them to him.

206
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,200
So he could have food to eat.

207
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,000
Later, one day,

208
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,200
he left without saying goodbye.

209
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,270
We met again only recently.

210
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,680
I knew it was him when I first saw him.

211
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,470
Oh, right.

212
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,270
As for Chunxi, Kang Qian's wife,

213
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,800
do you know her?

214
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,150
Of course I know Chunxi.

215
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,320
We grew up together

216
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,950
in Yanglou Street.

217
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:15,710
Five years ago,

218
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,270
Lady Zhang forcibly bought

219
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,510
Chunxi's family house in Yanglou Street at a low price

220
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,360
and ordered her parents

221
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,470
to be beaten to death.

222
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,590
She then became a maid

223
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,710
of Lady Zhang's house

224
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,880
and was forced to marry Kang Qian.

225
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,390
Actually, she and Sun Bo were in love with each other.

226
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,470
They got engaged

227
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,150
even before they were born.

228
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,030
They'd make a cute couple.

229
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,510
Sun Bo isn't in the house.

230
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,270
Let us get in and take a look.

231
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,650
- He's not here. - Let us take a look.

232
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:45,560
Sun Bo isn't here.

233
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,710
Then where is he?

234
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:49,830
I don't know.

235
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:50,950
He didn't tell me anything.

236
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:51,950
We're from Kaifeng Court.

237
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:52,920
Move aside!

238
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:54,150
Yi.

239
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,710
That was very bold of you.

240
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,200
What's going on?

241
00:09:59,070 --> 00:09:59,830
You delivered the message

242
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:00,750
and poison.

243
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,830
That makes you an accomplice to murder.

244
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:02,390
Do you know that?

245
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,760
Where's Sun Bo?

246
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,120
I don't know.

247
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:05,800
Sir.

248
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,700
I really don't know about it.

249
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,150
He

250
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,030
came back a few times.

251
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,560
But he didn't tell me where he was heading.

252
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,000
Come on, let him stand up.

253
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,320
Tell us more.

254
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,320
Well,

255
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,360
I don't think

256
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,470
he's ever coming back again.

257
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,470
What makes you think so?

258
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,630
He put his savings

259
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,630
under my bed

260
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,800
and left a note saying they were mine now.

261
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,070
Let him go.

262
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:26,950
Show me the money.

263
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,070
This is physical evidence.

264
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,120
Bring it back to Kaifeng Court.

265
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:45,470
Did you see that?

266
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,320
It's a planned crime.

267
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,680
If I were in charge of it, this case

268
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,800
would be closed now.

269
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,560
Judge Wan.

270
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:54,680
What should we do now?

271
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,710
It's fine.

272
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:58,070
Boss has sent two of our men

273
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,440
to keep tabs on Kang Qian's house.

274
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:00,760
Let's go.

275
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,200
Let us go to Kang Qian's house

276
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,360
and arrest that killer couple.

277
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,760
Ban.

278
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,070
Sun Bo

279
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,470
is a good man.

280
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,440
I know.

281
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,360
Buyou, do something about this.

282
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,950
Buyou.

283
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,950
Kaifeng Court's going to arrest Sun Bo.

284
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,560
Could you think of a way to help him?

285
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,760
Don't worry.

286
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:35,630
It may be a good thing for them to be arrested by Kaifeng Court.

287
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,030
I'm just afraid

288
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,510
he might fall into someone else's hands.

289
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,070
Yue,

290
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,200
why don't you let us do your hair?

291
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,440
You'd make a pleasant sight with the blooming flowers here.

292
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,200
Whether it is pleasant or not

293
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,030
depends on whom you are with.

294
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,150
I saw your servants

295
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,000
going in and out

296
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,200
with the stuff they bought in their hands.

297
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,320
I guess

298
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,440
you're going to entertain some distinguished guests, right?

299
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,510
Tomorrow night,

300
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:15,440
I'm going to entertain some friends who relied on me to make money

301
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,630
but later betrayed me and tried to get rid of me.

302
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,950
Let's not talk about it now.

303
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:22,440
Come on.

304
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:31,120
Here's the fine wine stored in the mansion,

305
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,200
Graceful Spring.

306
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,200
Come have a taste.

307
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,440
I'm here for work,

308
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,830
so I shouldn't be drinking.

309
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,510
Well I drank it.

310
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,830
I can tell that you can hold your liquor.

311
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,800
How about this?

312
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,590
Let's drink only a few cups.

313
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,360
All right.

314
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:04,680
Let's drink a few cups.

315
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,440
With only a few cups,

316
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:10,630
let's talk about some interesting things for each.

317
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:13,880
For the first cup,

318
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,710
how about we talk about our men?

319
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,270
I'm back.

320
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:22,390
Father.

321
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,320
Have Ban and Mo come back?

322
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,000
Father.

323
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:44,000
Father!

324
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,120
Yeah, vegetables are fresher in the morning market.

325
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,150
I always buy from the lad at the entrance to the alley.

326
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:48,830
He's an honest man.

327
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:51,680
Yeah, he never sprays water on them to get a few more pounds.

328
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,120
Mrs. Muzhu.

329
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,470
Did you see my father?

330
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,270
No, I didn't.

331
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,120
What's wrong, Buyou?

332
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:57,920
Nothing.

333
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,470
What happened to his father?

334
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,510
What's going on?

335
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,000
He seems to be in a rush.

336
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,470
Xie Laoba, did you see my father?

337
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,390
Yes, I did.

338
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:08,680
He said he was itchy all over,

339
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,510
so he went to take a bath.

340
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,560
All right.

341
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,120
Thanks.

342
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,680
All right.

343
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,920
Come back again.

344
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,030
Sir, you need to change your shoes before you get in.

345
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,120
Sir.

346
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,360
It feels so good.

347
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,560
Father.

348
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,200
Who do you call father?

349
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:40,920
I'm sorry.

350
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,030
Zhao.

351
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:48,630
Zhao.

352
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,200
Are you all right, Mr. Zhao?

353
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:50,920
Zhao.

354
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,030
Wake up.

355
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,100
What's wrong, Zhao?

356
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:54,590
Wake up.

357
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:56,950
Father.

358
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,520
Father!

359
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,320
Zhao.

360
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,950
Let's get him to the clinic.

361
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,510
- Wake up. - Hurry, Zhao!

362
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,320
Let's go. Hurry up!

363
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,000
Let's get him to the clinic.

364
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,920
Let's go. Hurry up!

365
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,360
Buyou.

366
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,390
Buyou, you are such a silly child.

367
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,560
You called others father.

368
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:25,030
When I first met Buyou...

369
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:25,830
Stop.

370
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,270
Buyou is my man.

371
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,830
He's mine only.

372
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,590
I know everything

373
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:33,760
about where and how

374
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,560
you met him.

375
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,560
It isn't new to me.

376
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,270
How about you talk about your man?

377
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:43,030
Who grants you the power

378
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:44,800
and brings you the wealth?

379
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,270
That sounds interesting.

380
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,830
Seems you're curious about my life.

381
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,120
Let me tell you a story.

382
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:57,760
Once upon a time, there was a magistrate

383
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:00,880
who took in many girls and raised them in his house.

384
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,150
One day,

385
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,830
the magistrate received

386
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,470
a short-tempered horse and no one can control it.

387
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,030
He then gave a challenging task

388
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,360
to the girls

389
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,120
to see if

390
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,560
anyone could tame the horse.

391
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,950
Everyone tried to tame the horse

392
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,270
but no one succeeded.

393
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:21,200
Later, a girl appeared in front of him

394
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:24,710
and asked for three things, which were

395
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,440
an iron whip,

396
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,920
an iron hammer,

397
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,440
and a dagger.

398
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,760
She said:

399
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,060
"When the horse doesn't listen, whip it.

400
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,710
If this doesn't work, bang its head with the hammer.

401
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,400
If it fails again,

402
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,270
slice the horse's throat

403
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,440
with the dagger."

404
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,120
This man's really something.

405
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,360
But the girl

406
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,030
sounds even crueler.

407
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,800
You are truly a sensible person.

408
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,150
Men are all the same.

409
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,470
Regardless of their age,

410
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:01,150
they are selfish, every one of them.

411
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,150
All we women ever want in this world

412
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,350
is to earn a living.

413
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:09,920
But often we have to

414
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,200
become a scapegoat for what a man commits.

415
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,510
That magistrate is a good example.

416
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,990
That's all about him.

417
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,920
Let's cheer.

418
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,080
Just now,

419
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:27,750
old Mr. Zhao couldn't find his clothes

420
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,920
so he couldn't pay the bill.

421
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,510
We asked where he lived.

422
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,870
But he couldn't tell us the address.

423
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,200
I was so worried.

424
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,960
Thank god you are here.

425
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,720
It must be hard for you.

426
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,270
It's fine.

427
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:38,720
You shouldn't give him this much.

428
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,080
All right.

429
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,510
He didn't tell you the truth.

430
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,800
Some jerk I don't know

431
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,320
took away my clothes.

432
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,200
I...

433
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,210
I looked for it everywhere,

434
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:53,900
but I couldn't find it.

435
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,340
I even asked the manager about it.

436
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,320
But he wouldn't tell me who he was.

437
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,510
I'm glad you're all right.

438
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,800
What do you mean?

439
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:02,440
Buyou, I must warn you.

440
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,800
Since you've accepted their orders,

441
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,630
you'll have to do a great job in delivering it.

442
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,320
Don't have ulterior motives.

443
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,680
If it's a secret between two of you,

444
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,150
you can't tell others, not even the government.

445
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:17,720
Father.

446
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,230
Why did you say that to me?

447
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:22,320
When I was taking a bath,

448
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:25,200
someone bent over and told me about this.

449
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,960
I've thought of our second topic.

450
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,510
Have you killed someone before?

451
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,990
Let's try change the topic.

452
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,030
How did it feel

453
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,680
to kill a person?

454
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,600
Disgusting.

455
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,200
I felt nauseated,

456
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:11,840
but I couldn't throw up.

457
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,630
That was terrible.

458
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:18,080
Then why did you have to kill them?

459
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,480
I want to live on,

460
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,870
so I must fight.

461
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,080
There were monsters out there.

462
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,960
I was simply protecting myself.

463
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,440
Let's toast

464
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,270
to understanding women's helplessness.

465
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,230
Mrs. Kang.

466
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,080
So you're here.

467
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,960
Through our investigation,

468
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,390
we found you're suspected of killing your husband.

469
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:56,960
Please come with us.

470
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,030
That won't be necessary.

471
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,800
I'll walk on my own.

472
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:08,940
I didn't see this coming.

473
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:10,960
She seems weak and gentle.

474
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,080
- Could she kill her husband? - Seriously?

475
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:12,840
Move aside!

476
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:13,560
Let us through.

477
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,920
At the Imperial Guard Department's order,

478
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:19,080
we're here to arrest Mrs. Kang.

479
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,150
The Imperial Guard Department is investigating the Hat Demon case?

480
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,560
Take her away.

481
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,100
[Escort Pei Chunxi, Kang Qian's wife, to the Imperial Guard Department]

482
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,100
[Governments at all levels are not allowed to stand in the way]

483
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,670
I can't believe she actually did this.

484
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,200
Kaifeng Court hereby hands over

485
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,510
the suspect to the Imperial Guard Department.

486
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,450
Could this be a mistake?

487
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,680
Never judge a book by its cover.

488
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,800
There must be some mistakes.

489
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:05,270
They were from the Imperial Guard Department and Kaifeng Court.

490
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,800
I don't think there could be a mistake.

491
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,350
But Commander Kang treated her wife so well.

492
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,410
So what's our next topic?

493
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,110
You once told me,

494
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,630
it would be a great burden to be loved by someone.

495
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:22,750
Why did you say that?

496
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,510
Only young people seek mutual love.

497
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,830
Husband and wife

498
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,540
share weal and woe.

499
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,440
I'm so sick of such bullshit

500
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,720
about how women should behave.

501
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:36,510
Do you mean women

502
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,630
can only take shelter from men?

503
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,440
That's not true.

504
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:42,840
I chose my own life.

505
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:47,230
I can't bear such a life.

506
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,800
Those men who wanted to bind me with love

507
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,440
was buried at this place by me.

508
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:56,630
Inspector Gu.

509
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:57,990
Inspector Gu.

510
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,750
Something's wrong with my family.

511
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,110
What's going on?

512
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,270
Did something happen?

513
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,750
The orderer has threatened my father.

514
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:05,560
I've told you this.

515
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:06,840
Severe the tie.

516
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,030
You had it coming.

517
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:08,630
Boss.

518
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:09,960
The horse is ready.

519
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,230
You're going out?

520
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,920
I was ordered to set off

521
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,840
for a business trip

522
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,680
to Chenliu without delay

523
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,960
and put down everything

524
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,920
I'm in charge of.

525
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:19,110
That means the higher-ups want you to stay out of the Hat Demon case.

526
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:25,320
Tomorrow will be the orderer's deadline.

527
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,920
It's tomorrow too?

528
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,350
Yeah, what's wrong?

529
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,800
Lady Zhang is merely a pawn

530
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,510
working for Zou Mian in East Capital.

531
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,960
Many bigwigs are involved

532
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,480
in her dealings.

533
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,750
Except for discussing business in Zhang's Manor,

534
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,720
they won't go anywhere.

535
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,350
Now the Hat Demon has resurfaced,

536
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,350
it affects their secret dealings.

537
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,630
I've found out

538
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,440
that their next gathering

539
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,110
will be tomorrow.

540
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,720
So many things happen in one day.

541
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:54,750
Boss.

542
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,350
The Imperial Guard Department

543
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,350
took away Chunxi.

544
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,510
The Imperial Guard Department?

545
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:05,440
Lady Zhang's stepfather

546
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:08,440
is the renowned Mr. Zou

547
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,320
from the South.

548
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,680
He even arranged some of his people

549
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,630
to work in the Imperial Guard Department.

550
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:18,800
This is bad.

551
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,390
Lady Zhang knows about it.

552
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:21,960
Where are you going?

553
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:23,600
I'm heading to Lady Zhang's place.

554
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,750
[Zhang Mansion]

555
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:26,410
Please just let me in.

556
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:27,560
What are you doing here?

557
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:30,110
Please let her know I'm here.

558
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,150
Just tell her

559
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,110
Zhao Buyou has found

560
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,560
who's responsible for the Hat Demon case.

561
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,200
Can you do that?

562
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,870
My wife said

563
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:37,200
you were of no use to her anymore.

564
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:38,150
Sir.

565
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,110
Please let her know I'm here,

566
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:41,680
all right?

567
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,510
Wen Yue.

568
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,030
Wen Yue!

569
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:45,920
Go away.

570
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,800
When we first met,

571
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:50,510
I knew you and I were very much alike.

572
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,680
Do you know why I don't like you?

573
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:03,150
I just can't bear to see someone who's very much like me

574
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,510
has a happy family

575
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,390
and a loving husband.

576
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:11,800
You actually have something I don't have.

577
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:14,510
That's just absurd.

578
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,870
You've poisoned the wine?

579
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,480
Get out of the way.

580
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,270
Could you please tell her I'm here?

581
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:34,800
Zhao Buyou.

582
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,150
Inspector Gu asked me to come here to help you.

583
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,150
I'm here for you.

584
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,030
Judge Wan.

585
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,750
They already know what happened

586
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,320
between Sun Bo and Chunxi.

587
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,480
I don't have

588
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,560
other means to save my wife.

589
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,350
Can Kaifeng Court do something about it?

590
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,030
Don't be nervous.

591
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,030
There's nothing

592
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,390
we can't accomplish in East Capital.

593
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,680
What a relief! Let's get in...

594
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,270
But the truth is,

595
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,600
I can't get in

596
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,200
the Zhang Mansion.

597
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,750
And I'm not the only one.

598
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,720
Even Inspector Gu can't get in there.

599
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:08,200
You can't just barge in there.

600
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:09,870
We have to think of another way.

601
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:40,620
[Fertilizer house, Zhang Mansion]

602
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,110
How's it?

603
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,510
You want to say it or not?

604
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,110
Sun Bo and I

605
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,290
had agreed to meet last night.

606
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,390
But I was arrested by Kaifeng Court

607
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,940
so I didn't see him.

608
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,600
I don't know where he is now.

609
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,680
What a pair of miserable lovebirds.

610
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:18,600
You must have your own ways of communication.

611
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:20,870
I really don't know his whereabouts.

612
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,750
Now I have been arrested,

613
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,870
he must've run away.

614
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,630
Weren't you childhood sweethearts?

615
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:28,800
He ran away?

616
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,270
What a heartless man.

617
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,720
He doesn't owe me anything.

618
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:36,440
But I owe him a lot.

619
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,960
I heard

620
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:40,350
when you got arrested,

621
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,840
you brought this with you.

622
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,080
It's a key.

623
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,270
Let me guess.

624
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,350
This must be the key to your rendezvous.

625
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,920
Lady Zhang.

626
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,320
I beg you, please let him go.

627
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,230
You know what,

628
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,920
Kang Qian hurts me every single day.

629
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,200
He'd either burn me,

630
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,330
or hit me.

631
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,080
I used to think I'd never

632
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,750
escape from this cage for the rest of my life.

633
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,840
Later I met Sun Bo.

634
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:14,150
He used up his savings

635
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:15,750
and bought a small house in a distant village.

636
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:18,150
He even hired someone to draw a painting and hung it on the wall.

637
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,200
He wanted to start over with me.

638
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,920
If you hadn't shown up on Yanglou Street,

639
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,350
we wouldn't end up like this now.

640
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:27,870
I beg you.

641
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,920
That's what makes a man vulnerable.

642
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,480
He'd even forego his life

643
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,110
for his third leg.

644
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,960
There's nothing between us.

645
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,720
We've never shared the bed before.

646
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,600
So Sun Bo did all those for nothing?

647
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,750
Yue.

648
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,150
Do you think

649
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,320
Sun Bo will come to her rescue?

650
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,840
Yue.

651
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,480
It must've been

652
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,870
hard for you last night.

653
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,680
Stop being a hypocrite.

654
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:18,350
I want you to die. That's true.

655
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,840
But I also like you.

They don't go against each other.

657
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,200
If I die,

658
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,630
the orderer will be coming for you.

659
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,920
The orderer?

660
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:34,510
There are tons of men who want to kill me.

661
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,270
And I don't give them a damn.

662
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,750
I'm just joking around.

663
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,150
Do you think

664
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:42,840
I'm the little girl in that story?

665
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:44,870
Actually, I was that horse

666
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:46,630
at that time.

667
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,230
I've died so many times.

668
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:53,600
I'm not afraid of anything.

669

pick a flower you like.

672
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,600

673
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,270
Is this feasible?

674
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,190
Indeed.

Any materials you need?

676
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,790
I can find everything I need

So let's keep it low.

706
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,190
Lately, due to the rumors about the Hat Demon,

707
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,590
30 percent of tenants on Yanglou Street have decided to terminate their lease.

708
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,800

00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,760
of the streets around the neighborhood.

710
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,470
This has incurred losses of thousands of guan.

711
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:43,190
The Hat Demon case has been solved.

712
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,640
The land prices and rents

713
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:47,800

714
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,350

Manager Qin,

717
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,950
you've deposited your pawnshop's earnings in our house,

718
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:00,070
so we could make more money from it.

719

00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,470
about your little losses?

722
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:09,680
I deposited my money here

723
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,830
because of Mr. Zou.

724
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,560
The East Capital is a commercial hub

725
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,680
where endless merchants would come and go.

726
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:18,920
It's very easy to make a profit in the city.

727
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:22,000
You're asking too much, Manager Qin.

728
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:25,590
No businesses are guaranteed to be profitable.

729
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,250
So that's what you ask of your son?

730
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:29,950
I see.

731
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,470
As for how I teach my disobedient son,

732
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:32,560
what does it have to do with you?

733
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,640
My father

734
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,230
asked me to deliver a message.

735
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:39,830
He said we would only be responsible for

00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,040

737
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,040
of the losses.

738
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,640
Now I understand what you want.

739
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,830
But what if I don't agree to this?

00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,190
Lady Zhang.

741
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:01,160
Your stepfather sent you to do business with us

742
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,800
because he wants you to build the connections

744
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,950
I don't think

745
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:11,430
you should offend us.

747
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,950

I'm sitting here

749
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:20,110
only because of your stepfather.

750
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:21,280
If we use the money we lost

751
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:24,230
and go have fun in a brothel,

752
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:28,280
we can find tons of prostitutes as beautiful as you.

753
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,000
I'll now write a letter and send it to the South.

754
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:36,880
Then you'll be stripped of every last bit of power.

755
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:49,430
Manager Qin is indeed harsh.

756
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:55,430
I bet you must make a lot of enemies.

757
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,640
Do you know

758
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:02,350
one of your enemies

759
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,880
really wants to see you die?

760
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:08,390
And who's that?

761
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,120
Your son,

762
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,470
Master Qin.

763
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,520
I'm only doing his bidding.

764
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,630
He asked me to do this.

765
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,520
I know you lost a small fortune

766
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,430
after what happened recently.

767
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:58,560
But I've already earned you a great sum.

768
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,390
Aren't you satisfied?

769
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:11,840
All right.

770
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,630
Let me introduce you

771
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,840
to my new steward.

772
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,040
Lady Kang.

773
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,180
So what do you plan

774
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,430
to do next?

775
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:28,390
I want to discuss a huge business deal with you.

776
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:31,390
You're guaranteed to make a fortune.

777
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:32,840
What's it?

778
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,190
The Hat Demon case

779
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,910
may cost us some money.

780
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,470
But we can also take advantage of it

781
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:42,190
to make a fortune.

782
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,150
Too bad, a few years ago,

783
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:48,080
I could only spread rumors about the Hat Demon.

784
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,150
But now the real deal has appeared.

785
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:53,760
All we need to do is make a few more Hat Demons

786
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,740
and put it on other people's land

787
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,280
so they will cause chaos there.

788
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,520
Then the land price there

789
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,470
will plummet too.

790
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,760
We will purchase some at a low price.

791
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,230
Then the Imperial Guard Department will appear

792
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:09,560
and solve the Hat Demon case.

793
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,520
Later when the land price returns to normal,

794
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,430
we'll sell the land we purchased.

795
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:18,000
Guess how much we can earn from this.

796
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,910
That's a good idea.

797
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:22,280
My father will consent to it.

798
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,120
I'm sure of it.

799
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:24,560
Lady Zhang.

800
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,630
You're quite the strategist.

801
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,950
Do you plan to buy half of East Capital?

802
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:34,190
I'm just a little

803
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,840
greedy, you know.

804
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,760
But who will be responsible

805
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,630
for making the Hat Demon?

806
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:06,910
Commander Liu.

807
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:09,430
She's the woman you handed over to me.

808
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:11,910
Her lover

809
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:13,710
can make a Hat Demon.

810
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:15,430
So where is he?

811
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:16,950
I've sent someone

812
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:19,320
to spread the news of Chunxi being here.

813
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,080
The result

814
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,360
is just as I expected.

815
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,710
Here's the food you ordered.

816
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:25,870
Come on in.

817
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:34,080
Lady Zhang.

818
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:35,120
We've brought him here.

819
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:36,560
Bring him in.

820
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:37,360
Yes.

821
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:43,120
Chunxi.

822
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:44,950
Sun Bo.

823
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,390
Sun Bo!

824
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:50,390
What an affectionate man.

825
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:51,280
Let her go!

826
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,760
- Chunxi - Let her go!

827
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,150
was right about you.

828
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,000
His romantic deeds are

829
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,520
even more touching than those shows in the theatre.

830
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,390
Anyway,

831
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,520
- I saw the plum blossom patterns... - Curse you!

832
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,520
- I'll kill you all! - It's so delicate.

833
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,280
What a unique flavor!

834

You slut!

835
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:15,600
You can't even take this?

836
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,430
Young lad,

837
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:20,430
since you're here,

838
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,150
you should just behave yourself.

839
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:26,520
There are many more to come.

840
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,800
Just listen to what we say.

841
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,430
Beat him! I want him dead!

842
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,160
Don't hit him!

843
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:47,430
Sun Bo.

844
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:49,800
Sun Bo.

845
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,050
I'm begging you. Don't hurt him.

846
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:55,120
I dare you to kill me.

847
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:56,760
Now stop it.

848
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,040
All right.

849
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,040
Actually,

850
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:08,840
I've never thought of killing you.

851
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:12,190
I only want your skills.

852
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,150
Just make us a few

853
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,280
Hat Demons.

854
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,870
They fly like real demons.

855
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,120
Why?

856
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:25,600
I'll do it.

857
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,190
I'll do it!

858
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:29,080
So you won't ask why this time?

859
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:30,910
Yes.

860
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:32,910
I won't ask that anymore.

861
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:37,870
Why are there so many officers?

862
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,320
Kaifeng Court is here for an investigation.

863
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,470
So many officers.

864
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:42,600

873
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:56,360
To catch the Hat Demon.

874
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,000
The Hat Demon?

875
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:00,870
Right.

876
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:03,080
We've received reports

877
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,230
that a Hat Demon is wreaking havoc in the mansion.

878
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,840
So we're here to quell the demon.

879
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,430
Come on, open the gate.

880
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,320
Do you know whose mansion is it?

881
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:13,760
That doesn't matter. Can you hear me?

To tell you the truth,

905
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:33,430
hurting a girl is my least favorite thing to do.

908

I'm afraid I'll have to do it.

909
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:43,280
All right, I'll do it.

910
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,280
I'll do it!

Move it!

917
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,760
Let me go!

918
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:03,610
Get in.

919
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:05,120
Get in there.

920
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,430
If you want to kill me, just do it.

921
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,080

I killed way faster than you just did.

We had a kind of tri-edged knife.

When it was stabbed into the human body,

928
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:49,800
there will be a gush of blood.

929
