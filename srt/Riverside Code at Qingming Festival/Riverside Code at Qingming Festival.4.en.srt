you ended up sticking this in my arm.

193
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:10,320
​I've been wearing it to this day.

194
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,630
You said this morning

195
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,440
that you would let me go

196
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:22,950
if I helped you get the case file.

197
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,680
I want both

198
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,120
the case file

199
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,710
and you.

200
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,440
No way!

201
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,760
Where are you going?

202
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:34,630
Go away!

203
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,270
Did you get the case file?

204
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,150
Yes.

205
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,320
I don't have it with me.

206
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,830
Don't give me your attitude.

207
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,070
Hush!

208
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:19,800
Welcome!

209
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:20,510
Come in, please!

210
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,880
Manager Bao, I'm sorry to trouble you.

211
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,390
Today, a pig's head appeared

212
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,590
in the Bian River.

213
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,590
Have you heard of it?

214
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:28,920
Yes.

215
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,620
​We followed the clue

216
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,070
to a pig shop.

217
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,680
The manager there said this batch

218
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,120
of pigs were all sold to you.

219
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:37,270
Inspector Gu,

220
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,950
pigs' heads are not valuable

221
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,030
to us.

222
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,710
We usually throw them away after cutting out the key parts.

223
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:44,030
Everyone might pick them up.

224
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,830
​Besides, with so many customers here every day,

225
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:47,920
it's hard to know who picked up that pig's head.

226
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,270
​Has there been a recent customer here

227
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,510
with the surname Xiao?

228
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,270
He looks very strong.

229
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:55,630
Well...

230
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,800
There is indeed one.

231
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,000
​He has been here a few days.

232
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,760
He's here right now.

233
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:05,760
Inspector Gu, this way.

234
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,470
Jiu'er, don't be angry.

235
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,030
I've taught him a lesson for you.

236
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,470
Give me a handkerchief to wipe my face.

237
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,450
You two clean this up.

238
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,220
Jiu'er, come back to me.

239
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,730
This is the life you should be living.

240
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,150
On the run,

241
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,360
living a dangerous life.

242
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,880
​What a miserable life you have been living

243
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,560
for the last ten years or so!

244
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,880
Why do you want the case file?

245
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,240
​What are you going to do next?

246
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,150
[Culprit-Arrest Abstract Volume]
Will you get me in trouble?

247
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,510
What are you talking about?

248
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,970
I want the case file to avenge my father.

249
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,270
Master was killed by those from the Office of Justice.

250
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,710
​Everyone on the banks was a witness.

251
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:00,240
Look over there! What's that?

252
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,590
​The employer wanted us

253
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:07,830
to kill everyone

254
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,760
and leave no survivors.

255
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,510
Kill!

256
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:14,590
Kill!

257
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,000
Kill!

258
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,710
Go ahead and kill them!

259
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,800
I'll handle you when we go back.

260
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,390
We're from the Office of Justice!

261
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,030
You are surrounded!

262
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,510
Surrender and confess quickly!

263
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,200
You are surrounded!

264
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,560
Surrender and confess quickly!

265
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,630
Don't you think those from the Office of Justice

266
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:43,800
came too quickly back then?

267
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,440
​And when they arrived,

268
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,360
they shot everyone to death indiscriminately with arrows.

269
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,850
It's totally illogical.

270
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,120
Back then,

271
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:54,920
on the ship,

272
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,830
- Master... - We're from the Kaifeng Court!

273
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:57,630
Hold on!

274
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:58,770
- Quick! - You can't go in.

275
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,680
Manager Xiao, sorry!

276
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,760
They're from the Kaifeng Court!

277
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:06,950
He is the one I referred to.

278
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,000
His surname is Xiao.​

279
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,360
It's you.

280
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,030
Just now I heard

281
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:28,030
a ship mentioned.

282
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,200
​Which of you is going to explain?

283
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,760
What happened

284
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:32,950
on the ship?

285
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,070
What did you say?

286
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,240
What did you two do?

287
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,360
You are indeed here.

288
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,100
You're away too far.

289
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,240
What's going on?

290
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,830
Buyou,

291
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,760
let me explain.

292
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,680
Explain what?

293
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,070
Shut up!

294
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:03,000
A man and a woman alone,

295
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,160
what are you doing here?

296
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:05,880
She is my wife.

297
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,410
Are you trying to seduce her?

298
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,190
What are you doing?

299
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:15,880
​I have fallen in love with your wife.

300
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,590
I don't mind telling you about it.

301
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,000
I'm going to compete with you.

302
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,590
How dare you!

303
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:22,640
Tell me.

304
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,110
How did you meet?

305
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,040
Haven't I told you?

306
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:27,560
I wanted to buy bamboo.

307
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,310
He's the bamboo merchant.

308
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,640
I'm talking business.

309
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,800
Business?

310
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,280
Are you sure it's a good place to do business?

311
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:34,560
Lady Wen,

312
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,350
I want to propose you marry me.

313
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:39,590
Ever since I met you,

314
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:41,560
I've been fascinated by you.

315
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,560
All I can think about is you.

316
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,070
What should I do?

317
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,350
​From now on,

318
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,470
you will be the most important treasure

319
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,350
to me.

320
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,830
You're mine.

321
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,640
I want to have a baby with you.

322
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,920
Inspector Gu, please kindly help me.

323
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,800
Silence!

324
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,190
Show me your customs document.

325
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,430
Do you have it?

326
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,160
I see.

327
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:02,920
My customs document.

328
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,280
Here it is.

329
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:09,350
Read it.

330
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:09,920
Yes.

331
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,760
Xiao Yishui.

332
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,590
It's me.

333
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,170
Hush!

334
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,470
You are from Meishan, Chengdu Prefecture.

335
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:23,230
On February 21, the third year of Xuanhe,

336
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,800
you came to East Capital to sell bamboo.

337
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,560
The goods include 200 jun of Shouzhu,

338
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,280
100 jun of Arrow Bamboo, 50 jun of Sinocalamus Affinis,

339
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,760
30 jun of Bambusa cerosissima McClure, and 30 jun of Mottled Bamboo.

340
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,190
Xiao Yishui, Jingxi South Road.

341
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,310
Issued by Meishan, Chengdu Prefecture.

342
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,190
Xiao Yishui?

343
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,110
Yes.

344
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:41,920
How do you spell your surname?

345
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,520
X-i-a-o.

346
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,400
​As for my first name,

347
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,280
it's Y-I-S-H-U-I.

348
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,380
Xiao Yishui.

349
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,140
Nice body.

350
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,830
I lived a poor life when I was little.

351
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,110
Tell him about your situation.

352
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,950
​I am a Sichuan merchant who sells bamboo.

353
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,190
Lady Wen specializes in making umbrellas.

354
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:01,310
Why you again?

355
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:03,000
So we met each other

356
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,470
and become familiar.

357
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,000
I see.

358
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,470
A bamboo merchant.

359
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:18,640
That's right.

360
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:19,520
You're from Meishan?

361
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,350
Yes.

362
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:39,000
Inspector Gu...

363
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,470
Prosecutor Di from the Office of Justice arrives!

364
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,040
You are from Merishan, right?

365
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,230
I'm from Leshan.

366
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,400
We are from the same place.

367
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,470
It's amazing?

368
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,310
Are you serious?

369
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,710
Are you really from Meishan?

370
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,590
Can I take a look?

371
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,420
Mr. Gu,

372
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,400
what's wrong with you?

373
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,470
Why didn't you tell me

374
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:10,640
you had a clue?

375
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,720
Mr. Di.

376
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:14,500
I haven't been back to the hometown in over ten years.

377
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,880
No wonder I feel warm in my heart

378
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,070
when I see you.

379
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,470
I really miss the Rice Noodles with Shredded Chicken from the hometown.

380
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,350
Yes, that's delicious.

381
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,950
​I have heard that the men

382
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,070
of Meishan are so good to their wives.

383
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,710
​Those who marry our men there live happily.

384
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,830
They enjoy an easy life,

385
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,560
and they don't need to work.

386
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,000
​Lady Wen, if you marry me,

387
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:44,950
you will have a happy

388
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:45,680
and easy life.

389
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,560
Prosecutor Di!

390
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,280
What are you talking about with each other?

391
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,230
Don't you think it's improper?

392
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:51,350
Wen Yue is my wife.

393
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,310
You useless! Shut up!

394
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,000
Wan Fu.

395
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,710
I'm here.

396
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:56,430
Is there any problem with the document?

397
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,310
No.

398
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,000
Mr. Di.

399
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:06,590
Let's go.

400
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:07,520
Yes.

401
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,800
Here you are.

402
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:18,830
I'm leaving.

403
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,560
See you.

404
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,760
​I will leave you to your own affairs.

405
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,040
See you.

406
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,090
I'm leaving as well.

407
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:29,430
I won't bother you anymore.

408
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,640
Did you enjoy it just now?

409
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,830
I seem to understand a little why Jiu'er married you.

410
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,370
You have a good mind.

411
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:08,950
Smart.

412
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,190
Alright.

413
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,430
Now that you're here,

414
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:15,880
let's have a talk.

415
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,040
Don't be afraid.

416
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,350
It's an underground culvert in East Capital.

417
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,830
If people die here,

418
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,710
[Underground Culvert East Capital]
they will never be discovered.

419
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:38,640
Tell me.

420
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,880
Where is the case file?

421
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,800
What is he talking about?

422
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,470
Didn't you tell him?

423
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,800
I did everything by myself.

424
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,190
He doesn't know anything.

425
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:47,830
Wen Yue,

426
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,520
you have been to the Office of Justice?

427
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,040
​Have you heard of my dismissal?

428
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:51,920
We can talk about it later.

429
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,430
I didn't mean to...

430
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:55,760
Let's talk about it later.

431
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,190
Free him,

432
00:22:58,470 --> 00:22:59,710
and I will now take you to get what you desire.

433
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:00,520
No way!

434
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,280
Well...

435
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,680
You...

436
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,280
Big brother,

437
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:05,760
what... what file do you need?

438
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,710
I have no relationship with you.

439
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:07,590
Cover his mouth!

440
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,880
I won't say a word anymore.

441
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,830
I won't.

442
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,280
Free him.

443
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:18,070
​Do you believe I would kill him now?

444
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,680
Then you can get nothing.

445
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,160
Don't even try to avenge your father.

446
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,160
Jiu'er,

447
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,710
I care about you the most.

448
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,310
I agree with you on everything.

449
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,470
I'll free him right now.

450
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:36,880
Free both of us.

451
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,880
You can go now.

452
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,520
Free both of us.

453
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,160
What are you guys doing? Zhao Buyou!

454
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,110
Bury him!

455
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,430
Let me ask you again.

456
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,830
Where is the case file?

457
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,100
Don't you plan to tell me?

458
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,350
Don't regret it after he dies.

459
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:32,160
From the moment you walked in today,

460
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,430
I felt something was wrong.

461
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,590
Tell me the truth.

462
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,000
You didn't get the case file, did you?

463
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:39,880
You...

464
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,310
How did you cut it open, Jiu'er?

465
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,710
Free him!

466
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:44,160
Okay.

467
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,350
Free him.

468
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,430
Untie!

469
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,680
Okay. Untie.

470
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,350
Hurry up and leave!

471
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:05,590
Let him go!

472
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,040
I'll take you to pick the file up now.

473
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,110
Don't deceive me, Jiu'er.

474
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,800
You didn't get the file, did you?

475
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,560
Otherwise, why would you do this?

476
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,280
You want to trade your life for his?

477
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,800
Do you think it's worth it

478
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,710
for such a useless man?

479
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,110
Wait!

480
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:27,520
Li Yan, the Deputy Commissioner of Transport of Liangzhe Region,

481
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,760
was assassinated on the Bian River.

482
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,800
No one on the ship survived.

483
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,760
​The murder weapon was a triangular dagger.

484
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,680
Li Yan's head was gone.

485
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,400
It was replaced by a pig's head.

486
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,000
The culprits were presumed

487
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:42,160
to be refugees from the South

488
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:44,710
who killed Li Yan due to his corruption.

489
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,710
What did you just read?

490
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,230
I can recite all the files in the National Archives

491
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:50,950
of the Office of Justice.

492
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,710
But if you dare to hurt my wife,

493
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,280
I may forget.

494
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:59,160
Why didn't you say it earlier?

495
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,640
You didn't ask me either.

496
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,400
No.

497
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,800
Hold on.

498
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,760
Didn't Jiu'er tell you?

499
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:11,950
Then how did you know that I wanted this file?

500
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,000
Aren't you a pirate of the South?

501
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,440
You guys get money from others

502
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,400
and avert disaster for them.

503
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:20,230
Fifteen years ago, someone paid you

504
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:22,110
to board a ship and kill Li Yan

505
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,640
to perform a scene

506
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,590
in which refugees take revenge on a corrupt official.

507
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,830
​After you had done so,

508
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,190
all those who had boarded the ship were killed.

509
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,170
Someone from the Office of Justice was behind it, right?

510
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,710
Otherwise, why did those from the Office of Justice

511
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:34,950
get there so quickly at the time?

512
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,950
Who is behind the matter?

513
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,040
Who?

514
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:38,880
I don't know.

515
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,350
​I've been reading that case file for years.

516
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:42,470
I didn't find anything strange.

517
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,520
What do you exactly want the case file for?

518
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,190
I want to know who tricked my father.

519
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,110
I want to avenge my father.

520
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,800
​My father was hired to kill Li Yan at the time.

521
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,110
But the case was hastily closed

522
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,800
with the conclusion of refugees retaliating

523
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,880
against corrupt officials back then.

524
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,590
No one even looked into who was behind it.

525
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:01,470
The person investigating this case must have been involved.

526
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:02,800
I need to get the case file

527
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,470
and see who closed the case.

528
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,040
This is probably the man

529
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,350
who tricked my father.

530
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:08,760
I remember now.

531
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,110
It was an Administrative Judge of the Office of Justice who closed the case.

532
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,280
Cheng Rui.

533
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:14,680
Do you know where he is?

534
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,640
He died of illness three years ago.

535
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,590
He had a low official rank.

536
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:19,950
I don't think he had that ability.

537
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,280
Then he is not behind the matter.

538
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:23,400
But he must have been ordered.

539
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:25,190
It's the same person

540
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,470
who tricked my father back then

541
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,350
and made the fake Auspicious Sign today.

542
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,160
He won't die.

543
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,280
Today, I destroyed the Auspicious Sign

544
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,470
to seek revenge

545
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:34,950
and declare war on him.

546
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,830
You don't even know who this person is.

547
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,800
How can you be sure they are the same one?

548
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,000
Of course I can.

549
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,920
​I have two letters in my hand.

550
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,280
One is a secret letter

551
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:49,520
from the person who hired my father

552
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,830
to kill Li Yan back then.

553
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:53,160
The other is a secret letter from the person

554
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:55,310
[Secret letter]
who planned the fake Auspicious Sign today.

555
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,830
Same handwriting.

556
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:59,310
Doesn't it prove

557
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,680
that the same person is behind both?

558
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,310
How did you get the secret letter

559
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,430
of planning the Auspicious Sign?

560
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,920
It's none of your business.

561
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:06,830
What I want is that case file.

562
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,520
You go to the Office of Justice now

563
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,800
and get me that case file.

564
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,800
It's too late.

565
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,950
The National Archives caught fire,

566
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,440
and the case file was burned.

567
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:15,880
[Assassination Case of Li Yan,]

568
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,060
[the Deputy Commissioner of Transport of Liangzhe Region, on the Bianhe River]

569
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:18,920
That file happened to get burned?

570
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,680
What a coincidence!

571
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,110
Yes.

572
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:24,190
Who set the fire?

573
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:25,680
I don't know.

574
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,830
But I know who was the last to leave.

575
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:28,710
Who?

576
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,040
His name is Luo Zhun.

577
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,560
But I don't know if he set the fire.

578
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,230
I don't know.

579
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:35,160
​I know how to confirm if it's him.

580
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,800
Jiu'er, as soon as I finish what I'm doing,

581
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:42,230
I'll pick you up at your house.

582
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,350
Zhao Buyou,

583
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,070
I have been a refugee before.

584
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,560
You know that.

585
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,590
Later,

586
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,520
as I couldn't afford to eat,

587
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,350
I joined the pirates.

588
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,920
​I did not mean to tell you this,

589
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:24,830
but now you know it too.

590
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,160
Gan Liang was killed by me

591
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,640
because he knew about my past

592
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:35,400
and threatened me.

593
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:43,920
​I thought I had escaped from them.

594
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,950
But they came to me again.​

595
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,830
Xiao Yishui disguised himself as a bamboo merchant

596
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:56,430
and asked a broker to invite me to talk business with him.

597
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:59,710
I only found myself in his trap

598
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,520
when I arrived at the ship this morning.

599
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,000
Jiu'er,

600
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,760
it's been fifteen years.

601
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:11,230
Have you forgotten who you are?

602
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:14,190
​You were the one who told Gan Liang about my past.

603
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:16,350
He bullied you so much.

604
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,110
I felt bitter for you.

605
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,070
So I gave you a chance

606
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,190
to kill him

607
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,830
and recollect who you truly are.

608
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,760
You didn't let me down.

609
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,350
You haven't changed.

610
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,640
You still have good martial skills,

611
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,920
and you didn't become a coward.

612
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,110
Jiu'er, come back to me.

613
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,230
Let's do something big together.

614
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,190
Come over.

615
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:36,470
A good show is about to start.

616
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,350
I like the way you are.

617
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:45,560
Did you see it, Jiu'er?

618
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:48,110
This is the life you should be living.

619
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,310
I didn't mean to say it,

620
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:54,190
but you didn't choose a bright future.

621
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:56,590
I really don't understand why you married Zhao Buyou.

622
00:30:57,430 --> 00:31:00,640
But now it seems helpful to me.

623
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,430
There is a file at the place

624
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:03,680
where he works.

625
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,950
It's about the Li Yan case from fifteen years ago.

626
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,190
I need that.

627
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:08,430
​Ask him to get it out for me.

628
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,800
​I want to see

629
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:17,680
if you can get out of it again.

630
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,310
Xiao Yishui forced me into the game

631
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,560
by pushing me into the water.

632
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,230
In a moment of desperation,

633
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:27,160
I took off the clothes from the boatman's body

634
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,280
and covered my face.

635
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,710
So the person you saw

636
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,400
in the water this morning was indeed me.

637
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,710
​Later, as I ran home,

638
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,710
I received those food of Sunyang Restaurant from him.

639
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:47,160
He said that if I didn't follow his instructions,

640
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:49,470
he would ruin our family.

641
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,520
I had no choice but to go to the Office of Justice

642
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:58,070
to steal the case file and settle the matter.

643
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,000
​This is what I've been hiding from you for the last few days.

644
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,230
Coincidentally,

645
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,400
you went to the Office of Justice.

646
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:17,190
You must have known about my dismissal.

647
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:20,590
​That's what I've been hiding from you for the last few days.

648
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:23,590
We are even.

649
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,800
Let's go back.

650
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,520
Something else to do.

651
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:58,680
Hurry up, Buyou is back.

652
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,760
Don't rush me.

653
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,710
Wen Yue?

654
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:01,280
You are back.

655
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:03,680
Wen Yue, I thought you didn't want us anymore.

656
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,430
Buyou, what happened?

657
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:06,590
I'm fine.

658
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,560
I fell down.

659
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,950
Wen Yue, the note you left...

660
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:11,470
By the way, Wen Yue,

661
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:12,520
I need to tell you one thing.

662
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,470
Tonight,

663
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,680
a man from the Office of Treasury came to you.

664
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,570
​He said their newly appointed official,

665
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:19,160
surnamed Wei,

666
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:21,710
is preparing to buy a new batch of green umbrellas for the palace.

667
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,520
So he wants to talk to you about a deal.

668
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,230
Alright.

669
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,460
I see.

670
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:34,640
It's a dangerous day today. Luckily, we are safe now.

671
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:38,230
Wen Yue,

672
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,430
For large orders from the Office of Treasury,

673
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,760
those officials must have made a lot of money.

674
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,350
I think we can raise the price

675
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:46,230
appropriately by then.

676
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:51,950
Sign it.

677
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:53,310
What is this?

678
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,430
A Letter of Divorce.

679
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:00,350
Wrote by Zhao Buyou from East Capital.

680
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:02,830
Ten years ago, introduced by a matchmaker...

681
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,430
Wen Yue,

682
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:06,280
what do you mean by it?

683
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,600
You saw Xiao Yishui today,

684
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:13,080
​and you know what he is like.

685
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:15,430
He even dared to destroy the Auspicious Sign.

686
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:18,040
I'm not sure if he will cause any other big trouble.

687
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:22,230
​I must leave, or I'll get you into trouble.

688
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,230
Besides, I lied to you,

689
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:25,430
father,

690
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,760
Ban'er,

691
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,230
and Mo'er.

692
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:32,280
In the morning, you told me to run.

693
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:35,520
You're probably right.

694
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:38,390
Maybe it's my fate to be on the run.

695
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,600
Sign it.

696
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,320
I won't sign it.

697
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,230
When did I say I wanted to divorce you?

698
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,000
Why do you make decisions for me?

699
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,360
I strongly disagree.

700
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,190
I'm going to burn it.

701
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:55,230
I'm going to burn it.

702
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,800
It's ashes now.

703
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:01,280
Zhao Buyou, didn't you hear everything today?

704
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:02,800
Xiao Yishui said that he would come to me again

705
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,520
after he finished what he was doing.

706
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,430
I'm sure he will come to me.

707
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,470
​If he comes to Sparrow Lane

708
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,630
and lets all the neighbors know that I was once a pirate,

709
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:16,190
how can you, father, Ban'er, and Mo'er

710
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,150
continue to live here?

711
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:25,390
This is the 800 guan

712
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,390
that we mentioned before.

713
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,630
From this day forward, it's your responsibility to keep them.

714
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:36,190
Don't spend them recklessly.

715
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,910
You

716
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,320
earned this money

717
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,230
by making umbrellas

718
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,230
one by one

719
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:50,950
day and night.

720
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:57,190
You must use the money to buy a house.

721
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:02,710
Buy house?

722
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:05,280
Will you come back and stay here after I buy it?

723
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,800
​Since the day you mentioned buying a house,

724
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,390
I've been thinking

725
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:16,470
about getting a new bed

726
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:17,670
in our room

727
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,600
and hanging a mosquito net

728
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:22,150
in your favorite color.

729
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:24,280
If you're not home,

730
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,670
is that home?

731
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,360
Alright.

732
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,120
I'll listen to you.

733
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,470
​I will use the money

734
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:45,230
to buy the house you mentioned.

735
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:46,430
​After buying it,

736
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,840
I will live there

737
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,000
with my future wife.

738
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:52,840
Also, we'll drink iced plum wine

739
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,430
in that yard.

740
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,280
Sorry that you can't enjoy it.

741
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,710
You can only watch.

742
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:00,430
Alright.

743
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,710
Remember to reserve the south room for your father.

744
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,150
I see.

745
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,600
Wen Yue,

746
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,760
you're ruthless.

747
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:17,280
Then, don't blame me.

748
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,760
Come here. They're quarreling again.

749
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,000
