201

Check for injuries.

203

204
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,160

Could it really be the Hat Demon?

209
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,350
Is there any other possible cause of death?

210
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,670

211
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,350
Some poisons cannot be identified from observation.

212
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,440
We can try that.

213

We'll know if the poison was oral.

221

Four hours.

227

Four hours! That's really long.

229
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,150
You didn't let me do it the last time.

233

No.

242
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,760

What should we do now?

247

249
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:34,960
I can test the poison on living things.

00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,030
How come he's dead all of a sudden?

378
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,110
I have said it.

379
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:36,030
A medical emergency took Mr. Ji.

380
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,520
He's so young.

381
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,550
What medical emergency could he have?

382
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,030
How did he become a pot of ash?

383
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,520
Cut it down.

384
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,230
You've got a lot of money.

385
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,520
Take the urn and leave.

386
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,670
What do I need the money for?

387
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,760
I will have my explanation!

388
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,550
You can't get in.

389
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:54,640
Get her out of here!

390
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,960
Let me in!

391
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,050
[Back Door of Zhang's Mansion]
Let me in!

392
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,230
Let me in!

393
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,960
My poor boy!

[Warm Chamber of Zhang's Mansion]

396
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,640
The sun lights up the Incense Burner Peak, creating a purple mist.

397
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:02,640
Two golden orioles sing amid the emerald willows.

398
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:06,710
Stopping my carriage, I admire the evening maple forest.

399
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:12,800
I would rather be a pair of mandarin ducks than envy immortals.

400
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,160
You are intruding,

401
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,520
and it's not the conduct of a gentleman.

402
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,040
Guards!

403
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,040
Take him!

404
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,070
Bring him over.

405
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
You treacherous man.

406
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,920
What's your business up here?

407
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,400
I saw you put out a bounty

408
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,590
for the Hat Demon by the gate,

409
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:33,800
and I'd like to be a part of the action.

410
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,830
Oh, like you will!

411
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:35,880
Get him out of here!

412
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,400
Wait.

413
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,680
Since you are already here,

414
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,040
tell us

415
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,760
about what you can do.

416
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:01,040
So, you can't do anything.

417
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,710
I've been to

418
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,800
the crematorium in the suburb

419
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,350
and witnessed cremation.

420
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:09,160
I can never forget

421
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,000
that smell.

422
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,230
I smelled the same scent in the garden

423
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,310
of Zhang's Mansion just now.

424
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:20,640
It's the smell of a young

425
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,190
and nice-looking man burnt.

426
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:23,470
Total nonsense.

427
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,800
Death must be what you are seeking here.

428
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,040
You do have some tricks up your sleeves.

429
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,920
How many bodies are cremated

430
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,070
in the crematorium outside the city?

431
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:39,400
I can't bear the thought

432
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,830
of sending my man there and letting him share a place

433
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,040
with so many people.

434
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:48,350
I heard that some people buried bodies in the garden,

435
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,880
and the plants

436
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,880
all died overnight.

437
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,520
Even the roots are rotten.

438
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,880
Scaring warms crawling on the land.

439
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,400
The smell is awful.

440
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,170
Then, I realized

441
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:03,900
that bury the ash

442
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,260
from burning the body in the garden

443
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,520
and the flowers grow better.

444
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,920
The colors are brighter.

445
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:15,310
Guess where that young man is right now?

446
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:28,800
As it turned out, cremains are the best fertilizer.

447
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,880
Look at how beautiful my flowers are.

448
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,230
You intruded into my place.

449
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,070
Do you want to become my fertilizer as well?

450
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,680
I think that Lady Zhang's most urgent business

451
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,830
is not the fertilizer,

452
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:49,560
but the Hat Demon, right?

453
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,690
Do you have what it takes?

00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,160

00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,350
I'm Zhao Buyou, a former official at the Office of Justice.

456
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,070
I helped the Kaifeng Prefecture with the investigation.

457
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,880
I'm giving you the information

458
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,800
just to prove

459
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,880
that I am capable of working for you.

461
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,400
Don't listen to his nonsense.

463
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:23,920
I…

464
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,190
I can be your fertilizer.

465
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:28,880
Okay.

466
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:32,470
Let's see what you are made of.

467
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,280
We are back.

468
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,880

470
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,800
Have you heard

471
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,590
of the incident about the Hat Demon

472
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,310
on Yanglou Street from last night?

473
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,430
People are talking about it.

474
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,160
Do you remember

475
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,400
Mo'er was quite close to a friend

476
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,470
when he was a child

477
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,310
named Sun Bo.

478
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,640
Of course. How can I forget?

479
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,830
Mo'er doesn't have many friends.

480
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:12,040
Sun Bo was the only one he was close to.

481
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,000
That's him!

482
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:14,520
He's in trouble.

483
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,640
He's the suspect in the Hat Demon Case.

484
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,640
The Kaifeng Prefecture arrested him.

485
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:22,920
Didn't Sun Bo disappeared

486
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,760
after a family accident?

487
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,470
He did.

488
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:28,310
But Mo'er and I met him again yesterday.

489
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:30,470
I wonder if he has moved back.

491
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:34,560
We all thought that he was an honest man.

492
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,280
He has helped everyone in the Yanglou Street neighborhood.

493
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,350
They must have wronged him.

494
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,880

Buyou

497
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:48,760
is familiar with Inspector Gu, right?

498
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,190
Kind of.

499
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,040
Why?

500
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,830
We'd like to see

501
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:57,040
if Buyou can talk to Inspector Gu

502
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,160
and let us see Sun Bo.

503
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,350
We just want to know what's the situation

504
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,310
or what happened.

505
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,560
When Buyou comes back,

506
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,710
you can ask him yourself.

507
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:07,190
Wen Yue, he listens to you.

508
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,760
Can you ask him for us?

509
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:11,950
All right.

510
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:12,950
When Buyou comes back,

511
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:14,160
I'll ask him.

512
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:14,800
Great.

513
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,760
You two should stop getting involved in things like this.

514
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,160

I haven't told you yet.

517

518
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,280
Again?

519
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:33,110
What's the reason this time?

520
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,040
I twisted someone's arm yesterday.

521
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,430
You hurt someone?

522
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,560
The dishes are delicious.

525
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,470
Wen Yue, let me tell you.

526
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:49,310
When I went to the clinic to check on Ban'er…

527
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,950
Although Physician Ge is well off,

528
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,560
they don't have decent food there.

529
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,760
The best dish is your cured meat.

530
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,360
He spoke highly of you for your good performance.

531
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:58,930

532
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,400
Have you finished your food?

533
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,070
Almost. Why?

534
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,190
If you are done, come with me.

535
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,110
All right. I'll do the dishes later.

536
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,430
What is it?

537
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:09,830
I didn't go to the clinic today.

538
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:21,280
I want to visit Physician Ge tomorrow.

539
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,160
Do you care

540
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,400
about your brother and sister at all?

541
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,470
Zhao Ban'er was fired by the clinic yesterday.

542
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:29,560
How should I know?

543
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,760
She didn't say anything.

544
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:33,280
Ban'er!

545
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,950
These two whelps.

546
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:36,830
They run off.

547
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:38,590
They left.

548
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,800
She's worried that you may scold her.

549
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:40,880
Oh, no!

550
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,830
They've been talking about a case since they got back.

551
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,230
I have to go after them.

552
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,430
Where are they?

553

[Opera Theater, Yanglou Street ]

554
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:54,920
Yao He!

555
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,710
- Over here. - Yao He.

556
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,950
We almost got caught.

557
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,560
It's fortunate that we were fast.

558
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:11,310
I was so nervous at dinner

559
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,400
that I'm hungry again.

560
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,310
I'll go get you some food.

561
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,800
Wait here.

562
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,950
- Thank you. - Mo'er.

563
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,190
What brought you here?

564
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,070
I heard that

565
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:24,920
there's a Hat Demon Hunting Assembly on the Yanglou Street.

566
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,160
I'm here for that.

567
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,800
There are a lot of people.

568
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:29,710
Looks lively.

569
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,070
Let's go check it out.

570
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,110
There's no Hat Demon.

571
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,560
It's nonsense.

572
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,160
Mo'er.

573
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,950
Who are these two?

574
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,070
You are the one

575
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,920
who got bombed with him the last time!

576
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:48,110
You look okay when freshened up.

577
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:51,230
This is  Zhao Ban'er, my sister.

578
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:54,110
This is Yao He, the coroner of the Kaifeng Prefecture.

579
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,400
Ban'er.

580
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,950
Yao He.

581
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,640
I'm Song Qiyu.

582
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,090
You are the one who wrote an article

583
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,710
about Zhao Mo'er, right?

584
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,730
What did you write?

585
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:14,760
He kept it from me and won't tell me.

586
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,920
What's wrong with you two?

587
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:28,950
- Ban'er. - Why…

588
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,400
I you'll go get you food.

589
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:41,830
Yao He

590
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,280
is an interesting guy.

591
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,590
Is it getting started?

592
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,710
I'm not watching.

593
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,920
I'd be glad if they all went to the Hat Demon Hunting Assembly.

594
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,400
That will give us a chance to sneak into

595
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,430
the residence of the Wus.

596
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:54,400
The Wus?

597
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,070
-Shhh! - Is it

598
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,680
the Wus

599
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,230
that people say the Hat Demon killed?

600
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:58,950
Yes.

601
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,590
Visiting a crime scene at night.

602
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,800
That will make a good article.

603
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,470
Well organization

604
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:07,520
and carefully thoughts

605
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,950
will make a good article.

606
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,280
Enough.

607
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,310
Let's go now.

608
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,230
Come on.

609
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,950
Yao He!

610
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:22,160
Come!

611
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:22,950
Coming!

612
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,650
Owner, next time, then.

613
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,490
It's delicious.

614
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,760
Mr. Zhao.

615
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,520
Mr. Zhao!

616
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,160
Mr. Zhao.

617
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,350
Are you also here for the event?

618
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,560
Are you here for the demon-hunting as well?

619
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,430
Because of the Hat Demon incident on Yanglou Street,

620
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:57,350
I've been doing my paintings here for a few days now.

621
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,280
I'll leave you to your paintings.

622
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,110
I'm going to check things out.

623
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:00,710
All right.

624
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,560
All the talented heroes.

625
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:16,760
Lady Zhang Qiniang is here in person today

626
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,830
in hopes of finding

627
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:20,710
the hero that can capture the Hat Demon

628
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:23,920
and restore Yanglou Street to its usual peace.

629
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:26,470
It's time for you to show us what you can do.

630
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,950
Anyone who can do the job

631
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,230
will be rewarded

632
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,560
500 guan.

633
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,340
[Death to the Hat Demon]

634
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,470
They are hunting the Hat Demon over there.

635
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,760
I hope they get the demon as soon as possible.

636
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,560
Yes.

637
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,160
Sounds like a party.

638
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:22,830
Yes!

639
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:23,950
Shall we go check it out?

640
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:24,880
Well…

641
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:26,310
It's okay.

642
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,920
It will take just half an hour.

643
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,680
Come on, let's go.

644
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,560
Hurry up!

645
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:37,160
Come out!

646
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,130
Hurry!

647
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,710
Please stay in the yard

648
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:26,310
and watch out for us.

649
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,320
Let's go.

650
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,080
Ban'er, you…

651
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,440
You are a brave lady.

652
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:39,150
Good catch.

653
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:41,800
Describe me more in your next article.

654
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,350
This is why the man is almost bald.

655
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,440
Here's his hair and scalp.

656
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,350
You are adventurous.

657
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,600
An article in today's newspaper says

658
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:17,270
that the Hat Demon sucks people's souls out.

659
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:20,030
The hair of the victim

660
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,750
will be left on it.

661
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:23,600
After some time,

662
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,530
it becomes wrapped in hair.

663
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,140
The places it flies by

664
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,490
are also covered in hair.

665
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,320
The hair

666
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:35,150
is probably

667
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,750
covering something up.

668
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:39,440
Mo'er is also adventurous.

669
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,990
Here I come!

670
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,270
Here I come!

671
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:49,390
Ladies and gentlemen,

672
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:52,270
I came down the mountain today

673
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,960
to fry the demon

674
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,690
for Lady Zhang Qiniang!

675
00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:00,480
My relic is the essence of nature.

676
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:02,920
No demons

677
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,870
can escape this!

678
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,510
That's impressive!

679
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:09,990
Come!

680
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:11,920
Come!

681
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:16,150
Come!

682
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,600
Get the Hat Demon!

683
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:20,030
It's in the pot!

684
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,960
The liquid is boiling.

685
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,320
The Hat Demon will be eliminated.

686
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:35,680
Show yourself, Hat Demon!

687
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,150
Show yourself, Hat Demon!

688
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,390
Show yourself, Hat Demon!

689
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:44,080
Show yourself, Hat Demon!

690
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,720
That man is powerful.

691
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,480
Who's that?

692
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:53,720
Who are you?

693
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,440
Who are you?

694
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,270
Who are you?

695
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:58,080
Is that man possessed by the Hat Demon?

696
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,440
Don't get in the way of the master's ritual.

697
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,870
He's trying to make trouble.

698
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,320
Isn't that hot?

699
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,270
Who are you?

700
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:12,080
Who do you think you are?

701
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,510
How is he washing his hands in the pot?

702
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,720
He's washing his hands in the fryer.

703
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:27,990
I'm okay.

704
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,200
He's fine.

705
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,600
What's going on?

706
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,560
How come?

707
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:34,270
Isn't that hot?

708
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,350
Come here and try it.

709
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,230
Didn't you get burnt?

710
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,600
It's not hot!

711
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,490
Right?

712
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:44,750
It's sour.

713
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:45,960
It tastes sour.

714
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:48,270
It has vinegar in it.

715
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,230
Stop there!

716
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:51,800
He's not blind.

717
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:53,990
He was pretending to be blind, wasn't he?

718
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,080
Trickster!

719
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:55,680
You are not blind!

720
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,270
Trickster!

721
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,110
You are a fake!

722
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,960
There's a hole in the beam.

723
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,920
The mouth was milled by rope.

724
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:20,720
The body

725
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:22,600
was hung there by the rope.

726
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:26,990
But in that case,

727
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,480
people outside will see the one

728
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:35,110
that's pulling the rope.

729
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:38,800
If you don't want to be seen,

730
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,270
then there must be a second hole

731
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,960
of the same level on the beam.

732
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,720
Lords above and lords below,

733
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,200
please do not use your spiritual power.

734
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,840
Every debt has its debtor.

735
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:50,680
May you suffer less in the next life.

736
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,840
How could I have forgotten my charm?

737
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:10,200
I found it.

738
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,720
The body was hung by a rope

739
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,630
that went through these two holes.

740
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:16,520
The one pulling the rope was probably hiding

741
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:18,550
in the corner blocked by the door.

742
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:26,520
That explains

743
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,350
why the body was in mid-air.

744
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,550
What about when the Hat Demon flew out?

745
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,830
Help!

746
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,520
Get off of me!

747
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,350
Get off!

748
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,240
Get off!

749
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,280
What's going on?

750
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:44,630
Hurry!

751
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:46,350
What is it?

752
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,150
