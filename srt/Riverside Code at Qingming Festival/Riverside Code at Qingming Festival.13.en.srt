Thousands of homes are brightly lit,

00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,860
and the doors to them are wide open.

00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,020
This is East Capital.

11
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,420
People from all over the world gather here,

12
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,380
and envoys from various countries come to communicate with the authorities.

18
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,400
Wen Yue, right after you left,

19
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,910
Buyou cried his heart out

20
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:36,680
in the kitchen.

21
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,190
So I scolded him,

22
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:40,230
"What's the point of crying now?

23
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,440
Our ancestors must have done a million good deeds

24
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,400
to find you such a perfect wife.

25
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:45,870
Yet you didn't cherish her."

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,400
Aren't you thirsty

27
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,510
from all the talking?

28
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,310
I know you're the best.

29
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:04,550
Wen Yue.

30
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,360
Our family

31
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,620
is about to collapse without you around.

32
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,360
Please come home.

33
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,160
What happened between you and my brother?

34
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,160
It's my fault.

35
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:24,240
I've taken so much care of your brother

36
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,880
that he lost ambition.

37
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,030
He's worked in the Office of Justice for over a decade

38
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,360
without a single promotion.

39
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,830
And he's never around

40
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,360
to run the litigation booth.

41
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,390
I moved out mainly to motivate him.

42
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,800
Don't you feel sorry for me?

43
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,280
Won't you let me slack off for a few days?

44
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,720
I feel for you.

45
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,240
I totally do.

46
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,000
Feel free to slack off.

47
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,800
I knew it.

48
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,190
You've been supporting this family for years.

49
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,440
Of course, you're tired.

50
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,720
But Wen Yue,

51
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,160
Mo is getting carpentry work now.

52
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,080
And I've found what I want to do.

53
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,550
We can share your burden from now on.

54
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,110
You found what you want to do?

55
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,030
W-What are you going to do this time?

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Wen Yue.

57
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,670
You know me.

58
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:23,240
I'm stronger than the average people

59
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,720
and I make a terrible physician.

60
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,390
I've been thinking a lot.

61
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,590
I don't necessarily have to practice medicine on someone alive.

62
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:37,080
You won't practice medicine on someone alive?

63
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,440
You want to be a coroner?

64
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,280
I know.

65
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,440
I know this is a bit unconventional.

66
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,470
But I think

67
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,030
I'll do much better as a coroner

68
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,280
than as a physician.

69
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,670
You've made up your mind?

70
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,390
That's right.

71
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,880
And it's been quite a while.

72
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,160
I know there will be criticism

73
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,110
against female coroners.

74
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,590
We will not be as respected as our male counterparts.

75
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,640
Don't you mind the criticism?

76
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,440
No, I don't.

77
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,240
It's not at all easy

78
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,670
to find something I like

79
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,640
and happen to be good at it.

80
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,440
If I'm so easily bothered,

81
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,520
then I'll be trapped in the house

82
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,710
sighing over my misfortune.

83
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,190
Then go for it.

84
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,430
It's good

85
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,240
to have a life-long pursuit.

86
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,870
You have my support.

87
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:26,520
Really?

88
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,820
Wen Yue, don't you think...

89
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,990
No, I don't.

90
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,120
You're not breaking any laws.

91
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,270
But if someone

92
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,470
gives you a hard time over this,

93
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,310
I'll stand up for you.

94
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,710
But there's one problem.

95
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,990
It may be difficult for you to get married.

96
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,190
I won't marry anyone.

97
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:51,270
I want to be with you forever.

98
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,400
How can you stay single forever?

99
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,870
If someone despises my job,

100
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,800
then he doesn't really like me.

101
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,590
I don't want him.

102
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,470
You've got a point.

103
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,870
Wen Yue.

104
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,120
So when will you move back?

105
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:10,960
All right.

106
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,860
You've told me about your new career path.

107
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,400
Work hard.

108
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,470
When I will move back

109
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,310
depends on Buyou's performance.

110
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,520
Here's a task for you.

111
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:23,240
Go home and monitor him.

112
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,150
Consider it done.

113
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,190
Go ahead.

114
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,270
See you, Wen Yue.

115
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:34,990
Take care.

116
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,120
You've sighed 28 times

117
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,030
since we came here.

118
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:06,360
Why?

119
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,120
You know

120
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,710
my wife.

121
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,430
She's so hot-tempered.

122
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,750
The orderer is after her,

123
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,300
so she wants to take him head-on.

124
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,460
And she told me to stay out of it.

125
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,680
When did I want to meddle with it?

126
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,840
But she is my wife.

127
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,240
I have to help her.

128
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,080
I can't, though.

129
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,400
Come with me to the Kaifeng Court.

130
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,680
Xiao Yishui was killed.

131
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,800
This is the fatal wound.

132
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,680
It took his life.

133
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:05,960
The cut is as thin as a cicada's wing and deep.

134
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,800
I don't know what weapon it is.

135
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,840
You said the orderer asked to meet Xiao Yishui.

136
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,870
So Xiao Yishui was very likely

137
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,190
killed by that person.

138
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,240
What a pity.

139
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,640
The pier was crowded.

140
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,080
I didn't see his face.

141
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,680
You could help your wife

142
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,430
by solving the case.

143
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,260
Can I solve it?

144
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,000
Why didn't you notify the Kaifeng Court

145
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,250
that you and your wife went to the pier?

146
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,400
I didn't want to implicate you.

147
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,080
Because I don't believe in this world.

148
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,920
Nor do I trust the ultimate power.

149
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,960
I remember you told me...

150
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,990
A battle seemingly between fiends

151
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,430
could be a power struggle

152
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,080
between the deities.

153
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,360
When deities fight,

154
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,430
the mortals better keep their heads down.

155
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,030
But if we dare not even look up,

156
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,270
how are we any different

157
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,120
from the most lowly animals?

158
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,080
It's not easy to live

159
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,680
in this world.

160
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,150
Even petty men are better

161
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,030
than lowly animals.

162
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,840
My father took me

163
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,560
to a business center when I was a kid.

164
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,120
A group of performers happened

165
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,240
to be playing deities.

166
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,440
My father wouldn't buy me a ticket,

167
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,630
so I sneaked in

168
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,120
only to be caught.

169
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,030
They beat me up

170
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,200
and threw me out.

171
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,030
Then my father told me,

172
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,880
"When deities fight,

173
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,470
we mortals

174
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,030
better not watch it."

175
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,680
But you didn't listen to your father.

176
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,560
That's why you got beaten quite often.

177
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,560
And I thought,

178
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,240
"Why can't I watch

179
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,150
deities fight?

180
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,440
I get beaten up, in the worst case.

181
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,630
Am I not alive and well?"

182
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,060
In a straw cloak...

183
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,810
Spend my life in mist and rain.

184
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:15,240
Better than a saddled horse I like sandals and cane.

185
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:17,320
Oh, I would fain.

186
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,360
I may be a petty man but I'm brave.

187
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,880
A petty man who dares to face the deities.

188
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:26,830
I'll take on

380
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,440
You get to the bottom of everything,

381
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,080
which is perfect for case review.

382
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:13,960
If you become an official,

383
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,230
there will be no more

384
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,680
wrongful convictions.

385
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:18,870
Then

386
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,720
I would be Di Renjie of the Great Song.

387
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,030
Then I'll be Zhang Jianzhi.

388
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,990
You can be in the legal system,

389
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:27,350
while I manage the court.

390
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,390
The two of us will work together

391
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:30,990
to make some achievements.

392
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,320
Well said!

393
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:36,390
Well said!

394
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:36,990
Well...

395
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:37,960
Mo...

396
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,480
Well...

397
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,450
Hurry up and dig in.

398
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,960
Take care of the guest.

399
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,800
Come on.

400
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:43,750
Dig in.

401
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,320
- It's amazing. - Buyou.

402
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:45,960
Buyou.

403
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:47,750
I'm serious.

404
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,270
Okay.

405
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:49,720
Qiyu also thinks I can make it.

406
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,960
He introduced me to the Seven Scholars of Dongshui.

407
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,600
I have learned a lot.

408
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,750
I know all too well about the Office of Justice.

409
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,560
I've been there for over a decade.

410
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,960
And I know my brother well.

411
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,030
So uptight.

412
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,200
If he really gets enrolled,

413
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,350
he won't even last for three days.

414
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:10,440
What kind of knife did the murderer use?

415
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,200
What are you doing?

416
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,290
Where are you going?

417
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,800
To study.

418
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,510
Study what?

419
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,920
I officially made Yao He's father my mentor yesterday.

420
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:29,800
I'm a legit coroner now.

421
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,560
You can't stop me.

422
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,600
Wen Yue is gone.

423
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,960
Life has to go on.

424
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,600
We can't all be hopelessly inept.

425
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,440
Don't say that about our father.

426
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,920
I'm not talking about him.

427
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,720
Mo is still

428
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,390
quite young.

429
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:43,970
Give him some time.

430
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:45,740
I'm not talking about him either.

431
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,230
Take a look.

432
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:49,970
Which one looks like

433
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:50,920
the murder weapon?

434
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:52,920
You're working on a new case?

435
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:54,630
Can I help?

436
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:57,450
Let me tell you about it.

437
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:00,240
A man in his forties

438
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,790
was killed by a sharp cut

439
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,120
on the neck.

440
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,430
The wound

441
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,720
is thin

442
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,480
and deep.

443
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,550
What kind of weapon was it?

444
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:09,720
It's probably,

445
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,430
you know,

446
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:11,840
a bone remover

447
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,030
or a tea knife.

448
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:15,280
What is a bone remover?

449
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,270
It's the knife those butchers would use.

450
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,760
Uncle Zhu is a butcher.

451
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,820
You can ask him.

452
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,790
Zhu, let me try some more.

453
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:26,120
Give me a break.

454
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,240
Look at this.

455
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,240
How can I sell

456
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,240
this badly cut meat?

457
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,400
I don't have the knife you want.

458
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,880
Ask the bookshop across.

459
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,240
What bookshop?

460
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,150
Zhu.

461
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,030
What bookshop?

462
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:43,760
Xi.

463
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,910
The Jixiantang Bookshop.

464
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,950
The knives they use to cut newspapers

465
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:48,910
are thin and sharp.

466
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,550
It fits your description.

467
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,430
Okay.

468
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,070
Uncle Zhu once said

469
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:55,640
that it would be easy to slice pork with those knives.

470
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,240
Jixiantang Bookshop.

471
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:58,910
Okay.

472
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,500
Yue.

473
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:05,030
Since I last read Mo's article,

474
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:07,030
I started following the tabloid.

475
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,880
I'm quite addicted to it now.

479
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:17,270
a great romance between a matching couple.

480
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,840
That's the smell.

481
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:25,950
Fei.

482
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,840
Where did you get this tabloid?

483
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,450
From the Jixiantang Bookshop.

485
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,720

486
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,430
What are you doing here?

487
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:48,120
What about you?

488
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,310
This needs some fixing.

489
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,120
Attend to our customers.

490
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,720
May I help you, Miss?

491
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:05,430
The fragrance of your ink

492
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,790
is quite unique.

493
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,720
You don't say.

494
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,270
It's one of a kind in East Capital.

495
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,150
They call it the fragrance of scholars.

496
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,150
It's very elegant.

497
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,550
Sir, please be careful.

498
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,910
That knife is very sharp.

499
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:17,720
Whose knife is this?

500
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,240
It's a replica.

501
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,360
Each one of us has one.

502
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,310
I see.

503
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,190
I'm just looking around.

504
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:23,760
Okay.

505
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:08,550
Run.

506
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,270
Wen Yue, be careful.

507
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:36,150
Get the authorities. Help!

508
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:37,070
Get the authorities.

509
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,530

Wen Yue.

512
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:08,000
Where did he go?

513
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,120
He got away.

514
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:11,310
He did?

515
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,600
It's all my fault.

516
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:14,950
I slowed you down.

517
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,720
Or you'd have caught him.

518
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,310
It's not your fault.

519
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:24,190
I will go to the bookshop

520
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,950
for more clues tomorrow.

521
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:27,880
We'll catch him for sure.

522
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,400
Forget it. Can't you tell

523
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,150
that I'm no match for him?

524
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,400
Really?

525
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,550
Then let's go.

526
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:37,410
Hurry up.

527
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,400
- Okay. - You want to get killed?

528
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,190
I know you still care about me.

529
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,480
Are you okay?

530
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:48,400
Born with pride, I admire the lofty mountains.

531
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,480
Why should I ask the cloud to be my witness?

532
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:54,400
Qiyu.

What clouds?

536
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,840
What can they witness?

00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:03,150

541
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,600
looks familiar.

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,190
For wider rivers,

572
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,790
just repeat the process.

573
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,190
Then the bridge can be extended up to dozens of li.

574
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,150
Stone has always been

575
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,880
the preferred material for bridge construction.

576
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,430
Stone is certainly stronger

577
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:35,030
to withstand rain and wind.

578
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:37,120
But the wooden stacked beam arch bridges

579
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,430
are also very strong.

580
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,840
Amid wind and rain,

581
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:43,360
or constant floods,

582
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,600
as long as the main beams stand,

583
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,400
the bridge will never collapse.

584
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,720
You're lying.

585
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,240
The bridge collapsed.

586
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,600
If the main beams are broken,

587
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:02,400
no matter how strong the bridge may be,

588
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,840
it will collapse.

589
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:06,000
All right.

590
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,640
Give it a try.

591
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,640
Come on.

592
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:09,760
Bridge.

593
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:11,550
What are you doing?

594
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:16,430
Qiyu.

595
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,150
Is something bothering you?

596
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:25,950
Mo.

597
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,840
I need to tell you something.

598
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:29,950
What is it?

599
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:31,270
I'm moving.

600
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,030
You're moving?

601
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:34,950
You might as well guess

602
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:36,720
where I'm moving to.

603
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:44,910
Is it tasty?

604
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:45,950
Yeah.

605
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,640
Laoba.

606
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,190
Good to see you, Mo, Qiyu.

607
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:54,840
Come here.

608
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,430
Sit.

609
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,640
Look at all those bags.

610
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,950
Are you moving to our shabby streets?

611
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:05,760
Laoba felt sorry for me

612
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,720
because I was paying so much rent.

613
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,670
So he cleared a room for me.

614
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,600
From now on,

615
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,760
I will have to

616
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,670
count on you a lot.

617
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,430
Don't be so formal.

618
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,130
Yeah.

619
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,550
Laoba.

620
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,880
I thought you didn't need extra money.

621
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,600
Why are you renting out your room?

622
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,240
So clueless.

623
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,000
Is it about the money?

624
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,670
I asked Qiyu to move in.

625
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,310
One day, my house could be

626
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:34,190
the residence of the top scholar.

627
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:37,000
What a great insight.

628
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,760
Laoba.

629
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:59,950
The windows are drafty and leaking.

630
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:03,360
Can you fix it a bit for Qiyu?

631
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,030
The exam is coming up.

632
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,240
I will just make do.

633
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,400
Besides,

634
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,790
Laoba is being very generous.

635
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,240
Qiyu.

636
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,670
Listen to Auntie.

637
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:18,550
The imperial exam is coming up.

638
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:19,950
You have to be careful.

639
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:22,910
Don't go out unless it's necessary.

640
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,600
Is it about the ghost examiner, Mrs. Lan?

641
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,000
It's always the same before the exam.

642
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,240
What a cliché.

643
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,520
You'd better believe her.

644
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:35,070
Mrs. Lan never lies.

645
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,880
Listen to me.

646
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,760
I heard that the ghost examiner

647
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,310
is nine chi tall.

648
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,790
His face is dark like charcoal.

649
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,430
He has no organs under his gown.

650
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,910
He only has a collection

651
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:49,190
of the hearts of those scholars he killed.

652
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:51,270
Rumors stop with the wise.

653
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,360
Ghosts and deities don't exist.

654
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:55,310
Even if they do,

655
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,910
Qiyu has nothing to do with them.

656
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,150
Don't you know

657
00:29:58,150 --> 00:29:59,950
that it only gets the bad guys?

658
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,550
I am so upright.

659
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,360
If he really comes for me...

660
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:05,720
I'll just run away.

661
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,310
Listen to that.

662
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,240
Qiyu.

663
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,150
Invite your uncle to sit down

664
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:13,360
and have some water and nuts.

665
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,360
I'm not familiar with this young man.

666
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,580
You got it wrong.

667
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,270
Really?

668
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,120
I saw you going back and forth

669
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,120
and I thought you were old acquaintances.

670
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,950
It's just my job.

671
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,310
My job is

672
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,030
to keep my employer cozy.

673
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:32,400
As long as he's cozy.

674
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,310
I haven't paid him yet.

675
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:51,150
I forgot to pay you.

676
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Qiyu.

677
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:12,950
Wen Yue.

678
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,790
What were you doing

679
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,760
at the Great Shop of Mules and Horses last night?

680
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:20,070
I was at home all night,

681
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:22,120
preparing to move.

682
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,790
I didn't go to any shops.

683
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:25,840
Qiyu.

684
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:30,190
The neighbors said that you moved here.

685
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,600
Why didn't you come say hi?

686
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:33,430
Buyou.

687
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,700
We are neighbors now.

688
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:38,310
Feel free to tell us

689
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,840
whenever you need something.

690
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:42,520
Wen Yue.

691
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:44,360
Why did you come?

692
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:45,910
Are you here to help?

693
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,200
Mo.

694
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:53,270
Help Qiyu settle in.

695
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,730
Mo, help him.

696
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,030
You're cooking?

697
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:08,880
All right.

698
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,310
I happen to be hungry.

699
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,240
Wen Yue.

700
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,240
I asked Inspector Gu to look into it.

701
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,070
That suspect

702
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,430
was working at the bookshop.

703
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,240
And the knife he used

704
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,670
was his personal belonging.

705
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,000
It was extremely sharp

706
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,190
and cut the paper neatly.

707
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:26,400
The bookshop owner liked it a lot

708
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,120
and made replicas for all the staff.

709
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,400
The shop owner said

710
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,550
that this man registered a fake name

711
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,640
and place of origin.

712
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,150
Is there a portrait?

713
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,720
No.

714
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:37,360
They said

715
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,720
that he was quite peculiar.

716
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,950
He didn't bond with

717
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:40,950
or even greet anyone.

718
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,120
And he

719
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,030
wore a hat all year round

720
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:45,520
so no one knew how he looked.

721
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:48,150
Give me the basket.

722
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,670
Are you going for groceries?

723
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,490
We actually make a great team.

724
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,050
We worked so well together

725
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:57,270
at the bookshop yesterday.

726
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:01,550
What are you doing?

727
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:02,640
I'm returning to the umbrella shop.

728
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:04,360
Take care of everyone.

729
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:28,580
[Top Scholar]

730
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:42,880
No way.

731
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,240
Qiyu...

732
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,070
Mr. Jian.

733
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,270
Director Zhang.

734
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,680
I'm here to see Qiyu off.

735
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,550
What were you...

736
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,640
It was nothing.

737
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,880
Qiyu is under a lot of pressure.

738
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,790
Please help ease his mind.

739
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:20,920
Qiyu.

740
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,470
Director Zhang and I

741
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,020
will wait for you at the door.

742
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,360
Qiyu.

743
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:46,790
You're going to the exam.

744
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,200
My family and I made this Top-Scholar Cake

745
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,710
for you last night.

746
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,640
We wish you the best and great success

747
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:53,600
in this imperial exam.

748
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,790
Try it.

749
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,160
Thank you.

750
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:02,920
What's wrong?

751
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,750
Are you nervous?

752
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:05,710
Or did you

753
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:07,360
get scolded by the mentors again?

754
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:09,710
No.

755
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:11,990
Qiyu.

756
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,440
Don't be nervous.

757
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:15,070
You will definitely

758
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:16,640
do well in the exam.

759
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,310
Have your pen and ink?

760
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:19,750
Don't forget anything.

761
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:22,790
Let's go. I'll see you off.

762
