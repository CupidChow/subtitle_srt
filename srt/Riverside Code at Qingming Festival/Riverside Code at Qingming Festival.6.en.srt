planned to create a fake Auspicious Sign at the Qingming Festival.

175

The way to take revenge was to board the boat and kill the person.

176

Then, his fake Auspicious Sign would be ruined.

191
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,350
Get lost!

192
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,030
Remember,

193
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:48,030
Jiu is my woman!

194
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,640
Mine!

195
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,520
When I get out, I will go see her.

196
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,080
Xiao Yishui.

197
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,440
You want to take revenge.

198
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,200
But I have my family.

199
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,080
Listen,

200
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,880
if you dare make my wife involved,

201
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,640
I will kill you.

202
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,230
Zhao Buyou,

203
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,550
I thought you

204
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,790
were a coward!

205
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,550
Come on, kill me, now!

206
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,440
Now!

207
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,470
Kill me!

208
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:28,520
Come on, kill me!

209
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,590
Jiu, wait for me!

210
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,350
I...

211
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,320
What are you doing, Zhao Buyou?

212
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:35,230
Let go!

213
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,030
I'll kill him.

214
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,470
Let go.

215
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,200
Let go!

216
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,110
Let go!

217
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:40,960
Zhao Buyou,

218
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,910
you want to kill me?

219
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,470
Judge Wan,

220
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,200
if he goes to meet my wife, what should I do?

221
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,640
Think about it!

222
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,230
Since he committed such a serious crime,

223
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,910
he won't be released.

224
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,440
He won't be released?

225
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,320
Sure.

226
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,590
I know.

227
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,710
Inspector Gu.

228
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:28,960
Inspector Gu?

229
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,400
You've turned such a large area

230
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:37,000
behind the Kaifeng Court into a vegetable garden.

231
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:39,440
It used to be filled with flowers and plants,

232
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,710
but I thought

233
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,910
they weren't practical, so I cleared them all out

234
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,440
and planted vegetables instead.

235
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,520
Why do you like growing vegetables?

236
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,670
Back when I was fighting with the Jingyuan Army,

237
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,960
supplies were scarce.

238
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,320
My elder brother, Li Yan,

239
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,350
planted vegetables all around the camp.

240
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,710
Vegetables were precious.

241
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,350
Are you growing them

242
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,280
to honor your brother, Li Yan?

243
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,320
I grow vegetables just to eat.

244
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,350
Yes, Li Yan also loved eating vegetables.

245
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:06,960
What's this called?

246
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,200
This is called lettuce.

247
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,880
My wife says it can be eaten raw.

248
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,280
I've used manure as fertilizer.

249
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,030
If you are free,

250
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:22,880
help me harvest that patch of chives.

251
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,400
Inspector Gu...

252
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,280
Don't eat them.

253
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:36,520
Inspector Gu.

254
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,320
I've pulled out the chives.

255
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,000
Do you think they are enough?

256
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,710
You pulled out the chives?

257
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,030
Yeah...

258
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:45,760
If I don't pull out...

259
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,760
We harvest chives

260
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:50,790
by cutting them.

261
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,350
Cutting chives.

262
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,590
You don't know it?

263
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,670
I will keep it in mind next time.

264
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,520
When I pulled out the chives,

265
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,000
I thought

266
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:02,280
that Li Yan might finally

267
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,110
rest in peace.

268
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,670
You've avenged him to some extent.

269
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,520
I just dealt with a clown in front,

270
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,880
Di Lun...

271
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,320
Not exactly revenge, though.

272
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:16,840
Inspector Gu.

273
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:20,910
When Di Lun was dying, he said that he had a supporter behind him.

274
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,760
You've already guessed who it is, haven't you?

275
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,910
Back when my brother, Li Yan,

276
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,960
was reassigned as the Deputy Commissioner of Transport of Liangzhe Region,

277
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,110
there was a prominent figure

278
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:35,400
who collected rare treasures and exotic stones for the imperial family,

279
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,320
extorted and oppressed

280
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:39,910
the common people.

281
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:43,470
My brother impeached him several times,

282
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:44,760
which created a grudge between them.

283
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,590
The person your brother impeached

284
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,880
is the one known as "Southeast Court"?

285
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,080
Zou Mian.

286
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,840
Zou Mian is the one who supports Di Lun behind.

287
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,000
He instructed Di Lun to fabricate a fake Auspicious Sign

288
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,960
to flatter the imperial family.

289
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:02,910
Xiao Yishui was backed

290
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,840
by a mysterious force,

291
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:07,230
and they deliberately sabotaged the fake Auspicious Sign.

292
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,960
On the surface, it seems like two little devils are fighting,

293
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,590
but in reality, it's the immortals behind the scenes

294
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,320
battling each other.

295
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,880
Exactly.

296
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,910
When immortals fight,

297
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,790
it's best for common people not to look up.

298
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,640
But if they're too afraid to even lift their heads,

299
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,640
it's no different from living like animals.

300
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,790
Inspector Gu.

301
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,280
Your words are exactly

302
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,760
what I was thinking.

303
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,880
Let me help you to tidy up.

304
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,790
Are you going to deal with Zou Mian?

305
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,200
In my lifetime,

306
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:56,280
I will surely have him beheaded.

307
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:01,030
But he's way too powerful.

308
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,080
Not in a rush.

309
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,440
There will be a chance.

310
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,200
May I ask you something?

311
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,840
I heard Wan Fu say

312
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:23,000
that the people below have their own way of making money.

313
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,230
Could you ask him to teach me someday?

314
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:31,790
Here.

315
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,550
I'm relying on you to purchase a house.

316
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,840
You'd better rely on yourself to buy a house.

317
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,400
Yeah, sure...

318
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,000
Zhao Buyou.

319
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,080
Ever since you came home yesterday, you've been in a good mood.

320
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,110
What good news? Still want to keep it to yourself?

321
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,110
You could tell it?

322
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,830
Of course, it's comfortable when no one is disturbing me.

323
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:07,920
Good news,

324
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,040
Xiao Yishui was caught

325
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,760
and he won't be released.

326
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,520
Why are you happy

327
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,800
that he was caught?

328
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,160
Why are you upset that he was caught?

329
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:17,800
I...

330
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,350
I'm not worrying about him.

331
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,230
He's a man of the world,

332
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:27,350
so it's his fate.

333
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:29,160
I'm worried that since he was caught,

334
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,160
what if

335
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,920
he reveals

336
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,560
my secrets?

337
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,310
Xiao Yishui

338
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,310
is clear about his grudges.

339
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:38,000
But he's involved in several murder cases,

340
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:39,520
so he won't be released.

341
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,760
For now, it seems that we are safe.

342
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,520
Let's just live our lives.

343
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,040
I also have something to tell you.

344
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,710
I took the order

345
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,000
of the Office of Treasury.

346
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,430
Great.

347
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:00,640
Surviving a great calamity guarantees future blessings.

348
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,800
So, I've been thinking

349
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,230
that we really should live our lives well.

350
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,110
Even if we have to borrow more money,

351
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,350
today I must

352
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,640
buy that house in Maijie Alley.

353
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,160
Are you determined to buy a house?

354
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,280
Sure.

355
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,400
I told you,

356
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,760
only one's own house truly feels like home.

357
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:27,190
Fair enough.

358
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,520
I'll go find Mr. Huang soon

359
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,160
and ask him to apply for a litigation booth.

360
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,560
Let's buy it.

You have a crush on Bun Beauty?

368
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,350
at a woman with such intense focus.

Her wheelchair

00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,560
Enough.

Vinegar is here.

379
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,110
Even if the steam buns are delicious,

380
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,110
you don't have to eat them so recklessly.

381
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:47,430
We've waited for the seats for so long.

382
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:49,000
It's made by Bun Beauty.

383
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,230
I surely need to savor it well.

384
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,800
When you pay to eat, you are paying for the taste.

385
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,110
What does her appearance have to do with it?

386
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,560
Of course, it matters.

387
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:57,920
Bun Beauty's

388
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,760
reputation is built on that very thing.

389
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,950
Wu Qiao is so pitiful.

390
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,880
She's been crippled since childhood,

391
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,070
but she has a good brother

392
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,950
who carries her to and from work every day.

393
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,400
Look at her brother.

394
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,110
If you were crippled,

395
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,400
I'd definitely make you a better wheelchair.

396
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,640
Bah!

397
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:17,710
What are you saying?

398
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,560
Even if I were crippled,

399
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,560
I could heel myself

400
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,000
without needing your wheelchair.

401
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,680
Just eat your buns!

402
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:31,190
This is your first time at my restaurant?

403
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,350
How do you like the taste?

404
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,710
Terrific.

405
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:35,830
Good news.

408

will receive one of these cards.

409
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,470
Once you collect four,

we'll give you a free serving of bamboo shoots and pork bun.

411

Please enjoy.

412

Let me have a check.

413
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,110
Okay.

414
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,920
Excuse me.

415

How did you fall down?

416

Are you alright?

417
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,070
I'm fine.

But these...

419
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,560
Hurry up and pay for the buns

and the plate.

421

But...

422
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,160
It was him who was in a hurry and bumped into me.

Why is he back?

426

Then should I

Are you blind?

432
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,710
You bumped into him

433
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:19,830
and even wronged him.

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,640
it wasn't my fault.

444

Besides, my daily wage can't

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,800
even afford two buns.

according to the pattern

562

00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:19,430
Please reprint it.

569
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,560
I don't think he can do it.

570
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,950
OK.

571
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,160
But who will

572
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,230
cover the cost?

573
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,430
You?

574
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:30,950
Isn't this cheating?

575
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:31,470
Sir.

576
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:34,350
Mo has saved you a lot of money.

577
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:37,760
Yeah, he also saved me on labor costs.

578
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,710
You don't need to do as much work as before.

579
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:40,880
I'll cut your salary in half.

580
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:42,640
You two,

581
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,560
drag him out.

582
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,070
Sir, you promised me.

583
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,160
How can you break your word?

584
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,280
If you don't correct it,

585
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,520
I'd rather you don't publish it.

586
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,830
It means doing a lot more work.

587
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:50,520
Get out!

588
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:53,880
Although the tabloid is just for leisure,

589
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,070
you should treat it seriously.

590
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,590
Mo.

591
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,800
Let's go.

592
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:08,710
Excuse me,

593
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,190
well...

594
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,590
is Mr. Huang still there?

595
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,190
Yes.

596
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,470
OK, thank you.

597
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,280
Doctor, I need another therapist!

598
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,920
I just had a sore arm before,

599
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:23,800
but now I feel pain all over.

600
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,470
Please be gentle.

601
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,920
She's my student.

602
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:29,280
She's both capable and eager to learn.

603
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,710
She's just a bit too strong.

604
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,280
Please show mercy.

605
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:32,950
Please show mercy.

606
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:33,430
Ban.

607
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:34,590
Release him.

608
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,430
Doctor Ge, you mean?

609
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,830
You've worked for quite a while.

610
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,430
We can't waste your effort.

611
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,470
After all, you've spent so much effort.

612
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,950
But being a doctor

613
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:53,350
requires a certain gift.

614
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,350
You have no gift.

615
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:56,640
You may leave now.

616
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,280
Please.

617
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,070
Excuse me,

618
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:20,710
when will Mr. Huang meet me?

619
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,350
He has left.

620
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:24,880
He has left?

621
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:28,390
I...I've been waiting here for a whole day.

622
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:30,040
Why didn't he tell me he had left?

623
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:32,000
He's so busy every day.

624
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:34,190
Who do you think you are?

625
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,950
He's so unreliable.

626
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,800
Why hasn't he showed up?

627
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,640
Property viewing on donkey's back, free of charge.

628
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,230
Our Tianshui Alley faces south.

629
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,110
[Property Agency, East Capital]
Well-ventilated.

630
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,230
There's a pool in the middle.

631
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:53,040
The north side is right next to the Imperial Temple.

632
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,430
I'll tell you a secret.

633
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:55,160
This house was

634
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,830
where high-ranking officials and nobles lived.

635
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,000
Be happy. We're buying a house.

636
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,280
Are you happy?

637
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,350
Why don't you laugh?

638
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,680
You got something on your mind too?

639
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,070
Who are you?

640
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:31,710
What were you throwing?

641
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:51,760
Wen Yue.

642
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:52,470
Wen Yue.

643
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:53,160
Wen Yue.

644
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,190
Where's your brother?

645
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:56,400
He hasn't showed up yet.

646
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,760
Let's not wait for him.

647
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,830
Let's take care of business first.

648
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,070
Sir...

649
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:05,430
Lady Wen.

650
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,110
You're here for another property viewing?

651
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:10,520
You've spent almost a year on it.

652
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,110
I'm here to

653
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,310
pay the deposit.

654
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,000
The house on the Maijie Alley.

655
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,880
I'll buy it today.

656
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,400
Alright. I'll draft the contract right away.

657
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:32,430
[Dagger]

658
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,430
In our line of work, there's a rule.

659
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,160
If the person sending the order doesn't want to show themselves,

660
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,070
they write the character "Dagger" on the wrapping.

661
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,000
Kill Zhang Qiniang in five days.

662
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,430
A reward of 100 liang of gold is offered.

663
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,280
If you disobey it,

664
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,070
I'll kill your whole family.

665
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:04,230
Move aside.

666
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,800
- Move aside. - Move aside.

667
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:08,880
Move aside.

668
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:10,470
Move aside.

669
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,430
Get out of the way.

670
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,430
Move aside.

671
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:13,640
Make way.

672
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,350
Make way.

673
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,470
Here.

674
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,470
Come here.

675
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,190
Wen Yue.

676
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,040
Are you alright?

677
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,000
Greetings, Zhang Qiniang.

678
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,830
Can I help you?

679
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:36,070
Just as usual.

680
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:36,760
It's Zhang Qiniang.

681
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:39,590
I'm here to check out what's new and good.

682
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:41,710
By the way,

683
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,590
Why haven't the properties I entrusted

684
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,680
to you been sold yet?

685
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:51,430
Several were sold recently.

686
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,430
But it's said

687
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,830
that the Hat Demon showed up on Yanglou Street recently.

688
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,560
Nonsense!

689
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:12,640
[Zhang Qiniang]
Call all the brokers here.

690
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:15,470
I must figure out today

691
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,230
who's spreading the rumor.

692
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,560
Qiniang.

693
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,560
Pan Family Residence.

694
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,230
Check out the Pan Family Residence on Donghua Street.

695
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,950
Looking south from the second floor,

696
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:34,160
you can see half of the capital.

697
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:37,800
This view is unique in all of the city.

698
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,190
Liang Family Residence.

699
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,640
Liang Family Residence on Beiyuan Street

700
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,560
is one of the largest residences in East Capital.

701
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:47,470
It is as large as three or four typical ones.

702
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:49,710
Lin Family Residence is also one of the top ones.

703
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,800
It is indeed smaller than the Liang's.

704
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:54,110
But

705
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,520
its location is incomparable.

706
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,400
Who's she?

707
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,350
Why is she so rich?

708
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:59,880
The famous Zhang Qiniang.

709
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,280
Half of the East Capital

710
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,110
is hers.

711
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:04,400
We've been waiting here for the contract for a long time.

712
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:06,160
When can we sign it?

713
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,350
We're your clients as well.

714
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,360
It's partiality.

715
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,470
This is against the rules.

716
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,300
[Kang Qian, the butler of the Zhang residence.]

717
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,360
Rules are set by wealth.

718
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,190
Sorry.

719
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,000
We came first.

720
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,280
Who's this lady?

721
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,190
Are you complaining?

722
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:21,950
My siblings were a little too blunt in their words.

723
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,360
But they were right.

724
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:25,950
First come, first served is the most basic rule.

725
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,230
Rules

726
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:30,560
are only for ordinary people like you.

727
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,040
Do you think you can do anything with money?

728
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:37,280
You three are family?

729
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:39,630
Here to buy a house?

730
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:41,630
Come in.

731
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:45,710
Let me see which properties you're interested in.

732
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,230
They're interested in

733
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,430
the one on Maijie Alley.

734
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:56,080
That small one is indeed good.

735
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,950
Your taste is almost

736
00:34:58,630 --> 00:34:59,950
as good as mine.

737
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:01,600
Qiniang,

738
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:02,950
are you interested in it?

739
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:05,630
I'll buy all the residences

740
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,560

741
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:09,280
Wait.

742
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,000
You can buy any one on that Alley

743
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:16,000
except for this one. I've paid the deposit.

744
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,560
Deposit?

745
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,080
I got it.

746
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:21,670

00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:26,190
Here, with my name on it.

748
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:29,000
I've paid the deposit.

749
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:31,560
The residence is ours.

750
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,670
Please bring the brush and ink. I'll sign it.

751
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,230

752
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,670
Wen Yue, we've finally got our own house.

753
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,870
Thank you for your work in the past year.

754
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,120
Lady Wen, the deposit is here.

755

00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,280
the property broker would also be held accountable as guarantor,

944
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:36,040
facing joint punishment if anything went wrong.

945
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,630
How does buying a house in the Song Dynasty compare to today?

946
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,800
Even officials had to consider

947
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:43,120
if they had the financial means to afford

948
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,630
their own homes.

949
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:46,800

would anyone want

951
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,760
to step into the booming real estate scene of the Song Dynasty

952
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,430
and be a property broker?
