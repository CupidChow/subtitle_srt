189
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:51,920
Are Father and Buyou not home?

190
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,570
Buyou

191
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,070
went to see Wen Yue.

192
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,240
He's not back yet.

193
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,710
As for Father,

194
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,360
he's probably drinking somewhere again.

195
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,320
Mo,

196
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,590
what's wrong?

197
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:20,000
Our family is part of a branch of the royal lineage.

198
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,510
Father's always making up stories about this.

199
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,510
Are you starting to believe him, too?

200
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,710
He didn't make up stories.

201
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,470
He was telling the truth.

202
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:30,830
How do you know?

203
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,320
After I applied to the Imperial Academy,

204
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,510
they checked my household registration.

205
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:40,590
Are you saying

206
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,270
our surname really came

207
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:43,920
from...?

208
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,470
A director at the Imperial Academy said

209
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,030
that in the genealogy,

210
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,470
Buyou is the only descendant listed under Father.

211
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,150
Neither of us are included.

212
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:56,390
Could there

213
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,030
have been a mistake?

214
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:01,240
The Imperial Clan Court verified it.

215
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,710
There couldn't have been a mistake.

216
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,680
Something's off.

217
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,630
I need to talk to Father and Buyou

218
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:09,710
to get to the bottom of this.

219
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,270
You're not going anywhere.

220
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,200
Come back here!

221
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:17,390
I...

222
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:18,710
Wait!

223
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:19,390
Get back here!

224
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:21,120
Ban!

225
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,070
- Go back inside! - Ban!

226
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,120
You're not going anywhere!

227
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,470
Why are you stopping me?

228
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,560
People have been pointing fingers at us since we were kids,

229
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,680
calling us illegitimate.

230
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:32,070
Haven't we lived through all these years just fine?

231
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,510
Does it really matter whether we're in that genealogy or not?

232
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:39,830
It's one thing to have no mother, and another to have no roots.

233
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,000
Ban,

234
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,070
I know you're trying to protect this family,

235
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:46,950
and you're not wrong.

236
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,510
But I'm not wrong for wanting

237
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,680
to know the truth either!

238
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,880
None of us in this family did anything wrong.

239
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,830
That's why we should stick together and focus on building a good life.

240
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,760
When Wen Yue comes back,

241
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,150
we can go back to how things used to be.

242
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,880
Isn't that enough?

243
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,000
Now go back

244
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,000
and get some sleep.

245
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:42,740
[Find peace]

246
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,020
[Dong Qian, Office of Justice]

247
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,270
Don't worry, Dong Qian.

248
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,070
These two kids are so well-behaved.

249
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:31,920
They don't cry or cause trouble.

250
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,070
I promise I'll raise them

251
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,630
and keep them safe and healthy.

252
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,830
I've never

253
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:43,240
let the kids suffer all these years.

254
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,200
Buyou.

255
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:09,030
What are you doing here?

256
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,240
Are you drinking Father's stash?

257
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,830
What if he finds out tomorrow?

258
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,320
I'll go to bed after I finish this.

259
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,240
Stop drinking.

260
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,630
Go back to your room and sleep.

261
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,150
Go to bed.

262
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,320
Good night.

263
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:40,360
Buyou.

264
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,000
Why are you still here?

265
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:44,440
I'll just sit here for a bit.

266
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,070
I'll go to bed soon.

267
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:50,030
I'll sit and chat with you for a while, then.

268
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:57,320
Buyou,

269
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,070
Mo and I

270
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,680
went to the welfare center today

271
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,360
to donate books to the children.

272
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,440
Some boys were calling the girls "stray kids."

273
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,800
I told them,

274
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,440
"I've been called

275
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,800
a 'stray kid' since I was little, too."

276
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,830
I've always wanted to ask you

277
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:19,320
what our mother looked like.

278
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:21,830
Our mother

279
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:25,760
was beautiful.

280
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,120
But she wasn't happy in this family.

281
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,150
Otherwise,

282
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,440
she wouldn't have left.

283
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,760
Buyou,

284
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,830
Mo and I both know

285
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,200
we've been motherless since we were little.

286
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,270
But we really are part of this family, right?

287
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,880
Why would you ask me that?

288
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:51,510
Of course, you're part of this family.

289
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,920
I was just rambling.

290
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:58,830
Look at us.

291
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,120
You and I

292
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,320
look so much

293
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,960
like Father.

294
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,920
Let me take a look.

295
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,720
You really do look

296
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,920
like our mother.

297
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,150
Then who does Mo look like?

298
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:22,720
Mo?

299
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,080
You know what?

300
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:29,800
He actually looks a lot like his father.

301
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:33,990
"His father"?

302
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,150
Yes,

303
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:38,800
he looks like his father,

304
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,350
Zhao Li.

305
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,030
Go to bed now.

306
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,050
All right, I'm going to bed.

307
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,520
Don't stay up too late.

308
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:56,720
Buyou.

309
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,640
I keep thinking of this scene.

310
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:04,920
I can't tell if it's a dream or real.

311
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,800
In it, you're holding me

312
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,110
and Mo

313
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,320
in a place

314
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,390
filled with smoke,

315
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,840
and you're crying because of the smoke.

316
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,270
How could you remember that?

317
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:28,030
You were only one year old at the time.

318
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,270
I remember your tears falling into my mouth.

319
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,350
They were salty.

320
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:40,840
Back then,

321
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,230
Father

322
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:46,720
rarely

323
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,340
came home.

324
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,150
I had to take care of you both,

325
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,200
so I'd

326
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,680
often go to the kitchen to cook for you

327
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,390
while holding you in my arms.

328
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,350
One time, the firewood I used

329
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,600
was too damp.

330
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:01,990
It produced a lot of smoke,

331
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,720
and it

332
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,030
made my eyes

333
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,990
stream with tears.

334
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:10,480
Even now,

335
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:12,870
my eyes

336
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:15,390
hurt

337
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,680
because of it.

338
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:24,840
Look, I can remember something from when I was one year old.

339
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,270
- You're incredible. - Isn't that amazing?

340
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:29,110
It's amazing you can remember that.

341
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,270
Shh.

342
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,270
All right,

343
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:34,560
I'm really going to bed this time.

344
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,750
Go on. Get to sleep.

345
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,440
Go.

346
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,110
Buyou.

347
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,030
Buyou.

348
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:10,990
What is it?

349
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,320
Thank you for taking care of us all these years.

350
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,350
That's what I should do.

351
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,920
Good morning, Ban.

352
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,230
Good morning, Buyou.

353
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:51,480
Breakfast is ready.

354
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,750
Call Mo

355
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,750
and Father out to eat

356
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,480
in a moment.

357
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,390
Mo went out early this morning.

358
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,510
Where did he go?

359
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,920
I think he went to check the recruitment results.

360
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,990
Did he apply for a job?

361
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:05,510
Yes,

362
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:07,630
he said he wanted to get a position.

363
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:08,680
All right.

364
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,080
Go eat breakfast now.

365
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,110
Call Father, too.

366
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:14,870
Father,

367
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,350
breakfast is ready!

Ban.

369
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,560
Look at me.

370
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:24,110
Do I

371
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,230
look good?

372
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,630
Father, why are you dressed like this?

373
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,560
The Fan Building

374
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,600
is hosting a spring banquet today.

375
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:34,510
Many

376
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,960
courtesans

377
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,720
will be there.

378
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,870
I must go there today

379
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:39,200
to enjoy the view.

380
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:39,960
Father.

381
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:40,750
Father...

382
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:41,680
Come

383
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,480
and have breakfast first

384
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,660
before you talk about going to the Fan Building.

385
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,060
Come on.

386
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:47,560
Yeah,

387
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,230
The Fan Building is a money pit.

388
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,480
We can't afford to go.

389
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:52,230
If you go,

390
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:54,560
you'll drain our entire month's food budget.

391
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,560
Exactly.

392
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,680
Since when do you two get to tell me what to do?

393
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,110
I'm telling you,

394
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,480
I'm going today, no matter what.

395
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:04,920
Come on. Eat.

396
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:09,630
Mo.

397
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,840
- Mo. - Did you go check the recruitment results?

398
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:12,680
Come here.

399
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,200
Sit down.

400
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,840
What kind of job did you apply for?

401
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:17,840
A position at the Office of Justice.

402
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:20,030
The Office of Justice?

403
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,440
Do they

404
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,270
have openings?

405
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,030
They're never short-staffed.

406
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,750
They posted a recruitment notice recently,

407
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,680
and I applied.

408
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,110
I checked the results today.

409
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,390
I can

410
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,750
start tomorrow as an assistant.

411
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,230
What position?

412
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:38,320
Buyou, don't you remember?

413
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,750
Your old position has been vacant

414
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,920
ever since you were dismissed

415
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,800
from the Office of Justice.

416
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:46,840
That's perfect.

417
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,110
Buyou didn't do well,

418
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,600
and now Mo is taking over.

419
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:53,320
For Mo to work as a scribe

420
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,110
is a waste of talent.

421
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,920
With your abilities,

422
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,560
you should work at the Department for Palace Construction

423
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,840
or the Directorate of Armaments.

424
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,110
Why work as a scribe at the Office of Justice?

425
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:02,800
Buyou,

426
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,840
Mo is now working

427
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,510
for the government, too.

428
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,200
I have

429
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,320
an idea.

430
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,390
Why don't you give me

431
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,680
some money?

432
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,800
Let's all go to the Fan Building

433
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:14,800
today

434
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,150
to celebrate.

435
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:16,750
Wouldn't that be great?

436
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:17,440
Father,

437
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,110
every year you come up with dozens

438
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,960
of excuses to go to the Fan Building.

439
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:22,440
When did we ever let you go?

440
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:22,990
Stop thinking about it.

441
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:23,870
You just don't want me to...

442
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:24,600
You're not going.

443
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,230
You're not going.

444
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:28,720
I'm going today, no matter what!

445
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:29,920
No one can stop me.

446
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,030
Father, there's something I want to ask you.

447
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:32,110
Father, did you hear that?

448
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:32,960
Mo has something to ask you.

449
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,480
Come on,

450
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,270
let's hear what Mo has to say first.

451
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,680
Father, go ahead and head to the Fan Building.

452
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,680
The spring banquet is about to start.

453
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:38,990
Are Ban and I your biological children?

454
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:45,200
I...

455
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,320
What did he say?

456
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,960
I didn't catch that either.

457
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,750
Are Ban and I your biological children?

458
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,390
Father.

459
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,030
Father.

460
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:57,630
Father's not feeling well.

461
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:58,110
What's wrong?

462
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:58,840
I'll help him inside first.

463
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,350
Don't worry.

464
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,110
You two keep eating.

465
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:02,600
Ungrateful kids!

466
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:03,510
What do we do?

467
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,870
What do we do?

468
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:10,870
Zhao Mo,

469
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,370
look at what you've done to Father!

470
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:13,990
You handle this.

471
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:15,270
What's up with you?

472
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,840
Father's faking it.

473
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:18,920
I saw him signaling Buyou

474
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,110
with his eyes just now.

475
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,680
Father's never muddleheaded when it comes to serious matters.

476
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:28,350
I'm going to bring breakfast to Wen Yue.

477
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,230
Buyou,

478
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:29,990
I want to ask you something, too.

479
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:30,750
He wants to ask

480
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,390
if Father's feeling better.

481
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:34,320
Much better.

482
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,920
Just make sure he doesn't go out.

483
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:36,800
It's not that.

484
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,840
Why aren't Ban and I

485
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,720
listed in the genealogy?

486
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,080
What...

487
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:50,990
How could you not be in it?

488
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,600
You're definitely in there.

489
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,440
I checked.

490
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,110
We're not.

491
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,480
Your family is indeed part of a branch of the royal lineage.

492
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:00,630
However, in your family genealogy,

493
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,480
only your father

494
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:04,990
and your elder brother are listed.

495
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:07,940
[Li, male, one son, Buyou]
Zhao Mo and Zhao Ban aren't included.

496
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,510
Oh, I see.

497
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,100
I remember now.

498
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:18,080
Father used to be part of the royal family,

499
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,280
but later, he became a commoner.

500
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:20,480
I

501
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,320
was born before that,

502
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,560
so my name is included.

503
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,350
But you two were born

504
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:26,680
after he became a commoner,

505
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,030
so only my name is in there,

506
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,630
and yours weren't added.

507
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,750
That's right.

508
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,510
He doesn't know the rules.

509
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:33,600
- That can't be right. - There must have been a mistake.

510
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,920
I've asked around.

511
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:36,920
All descendants of a former royal family member

512
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,800
are recorded in the genealogy.

513
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:42,680
Why did you ask about that?

514
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,630
You already knew your names weren't included, and yet you kept investigating?

515
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:45,680
What are you trying to do?

516
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,230
Are you...?

517
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:49,270
I see.

518
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:52,150
You're wondering if you're not

519
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,750
Father's biological son, aren't you?

520
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,840
Deep down, you don't

521
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,030
want to be part of this family anymore.

522
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:56,560
Am I right?

523
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,800
That's not what I mean!

524
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,920
I just want to figure out who I really am.

525
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,990
You're Ban's elder brother,

526
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:02,080
my younger brother,

527
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,480
and Father's son.

528
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,720
It's that simple!

529
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:07,200
You're being ridiculous.

530
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:07,870
I'm done talking to you.

531
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:08,960
I'm off to deliver breakfast.

532
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:12,200
Today,

533
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,230
I'll move to the quarters of the Office of Justice.

534
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,390
I won't come back until you tell me the truth.

535
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:18,200
Enough, Zhao Mo!

536
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,480
Then I'll tell you this.

537
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:22,680
If you move to the Office of Justice today,

538
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:24,600
don't ever come back to this house!

539
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:28,110
The brothers are turning against each other!

540
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:28,680
Wait,

541
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,350
Buyou!

542
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,990
Buyou, that's not what he meant!

543
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:31,560
Keep an eye on Father.

544
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,600
Don't let him go to the Fan Building.

545
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,800
What's wrong with you?

546
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,320
My son's disowning his family!

547
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,200
Enough already. Let's eat.

548
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,990
The Zhao family is falling apart!

549
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:50,480
Eat.

550
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,110
I'm not eating.

551
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,110
I'm going to the Office of Justice.

552
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,990
Zhao Mo!

553
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,750
The brothers are turning against each other!

554
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,030
Come back!

555
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,350
Mo!

556
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:07,600
Mo!

557
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,350
Don't go.

558
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,270
Don't go.

559
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:15,960
Fine, don't ever come back!

560
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,390
You seem troubled.

561
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:25,440
Wen Yue,

562
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:29,390
there's nothing I can hide from you.

563
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,990
Let me tell you a secret

564
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,680
about our family.

565
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:39,600

Qian.

572
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,960
He had two children with him.

573
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,440
He said they were his son and daughter,

574
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,320
and he asked me to take care of them.

575
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,350
He said he'd made up his mind to accomplish something big,

576
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,270
and that it might cost him his life.

Where did they come from?

579
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,080
I asked you a question. Answer me.

580

They're from a friend.

581

Two days later,

586
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,350
something terrible happened at the Dong Residence.

587
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,720
Everyone there was brutally killed.

588
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:03,960
Looking back now,

589
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,870
since the killer was Shan Shiliu

590
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:09,320
I realize Qian must have offended the Zou family.

591
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,150
That's what led to such a disaster.

592
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:14,440
The Emperor ordered a joint investigation by all ministries,

593
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:15,200
but in the end,

594
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:17,030
the case was hastily closed

595
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,150
as a revenge killing

596
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,270
by a criminal Qian had arrested.

597
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,990
I visited several welfare centers on the outskirts

598
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:29,230
and spoke to a few farmers.

599
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:31,110
I thought I'd found a decent household,

600
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:34,720
but then I discovered the husband was a drunk who beat his wife,

601
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,230
so I decided not to leave the kids there.

602
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,510
There, there.

603
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,110
Don't cry.

604
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,460
It's okay. Don't cry.

610
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,030
I begged Father

611
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:23,110
to take in Dong Qian's two children.

612
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,990
To keep their true identities hidden

613
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,630
and protect them from harm,

614
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:29,800

00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,460
where did you get this hair ribbon?

757
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:41,110
This?

758
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:42,920
My younger brother made it for me.

759
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,440
Your brother made it?

760
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,280
My sister-in-law makes these, too.

761
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,240
She loves adding two little seed beads

762
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,680
at the end of her ribbons.

763
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,830
What a coincidence.

764
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,050
Everyone, stay calm.

765
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:56,040
- Stay calm. - Back to the hall, everyone!

766
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,440
Quiet down!

767
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:57,920
Move back!

Yes.

00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:05,110

774
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,870

789
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,960
select a representative

790
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,040
to record the names

791
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:39,680

792
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,590
Just a moment.

793
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,790

794
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:42,790

Stop shouting.

796
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:47,150

803
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,200
the killer chose this time and place

804
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,630

807
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:05,550
They obviously wanted to make a scene.

808
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:06,960
Did they succeed?

809
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:08,390
Of course, they did.

810
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,920
Everyone here is in a panic.

811
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,240
Then do you think

812
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:13,520
the killer would stick around

813
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,830
and wait for us to catch them?

814
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:19,440
What if the killer's

815
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,310

816

817
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,680

818
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,000
This is the spring banquet at the Fan Building.

820

846
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:22,460
We need to get the bodies examined.

Oh.

848
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,890
Inspector Gu, can I help examine the bodies?

849
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:36,060
There's skin discoloration

850
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,260
with signs of abuse.

851
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,480
Based on the discoloration,

852
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,240
the estimated time of death is three days ago.

857
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,550

862

863
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,830
submerged in ink before death.

864
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:42,550

865
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:43,390

There are minor bruises behind the ears.

869
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,720
He was likely hung upside down for a long time before death.

The Feng Sai case

871
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,960
is at a critical point.

884
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,980

886
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:28,720
No, none at all.

888
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,040
It's fragrant and foul at the same time.

889
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,560
It's the smell of fragrant powder.

890
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,660
It was sprinkled on the bodies to mask the stench of decomposition.

That's not what I wanted to ask.

896

897
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:52,440
the names on the red satin cloths.

898
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:56,040
These names

899
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,240
are a bit strange.

They're all women's names.

902
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:06,110
And that means we don't need to transcribe them?

903
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,070
Of course not.
