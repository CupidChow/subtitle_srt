00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,440
his death was very suspicious.

191
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,300
I discovered that the three dead people at Fan Tower

192
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,710
were the judges

193
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,570
of the Dong family massacre case back then.

194
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,070
Do you think these two cases

195
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,360
might be connected in some way?

196
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,500
Well, let's talk more when we have time.

197
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,000
I still have some things to take care of.

198
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:57,120
Don't forget to come back for dinner tonight.

199
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,120
Zhao Mo,

200
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,760
let them know

201
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,150
that one of the bookshelf legs

202
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,200
is missing a piece.

203
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,800
Ask them to fix it another day.

204
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,920
Got it.

205
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,940
[Wuyou]

206
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,150
What is she doing here?

207
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:44,920
We've arrived.

208
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,270
Stop. Don't move.

209
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:11,830
Who is this?

210
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,030
Ever since that old guy from the Water Dagger Sect died,

211
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,710
no one has come down to play with me.

212
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:22,470
[General Wuyou]

213
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,630
Are you Wen Yue?

214
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,030
It really is you!

215
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,360
So,

216
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,950
you've come down to see me?

217
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,360
I need your help.

218
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,390
Fifteen years without seeing each other,

219
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:40,270
and you immediately ask me for help?

220
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,030
How boring!

221
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,560
Too boring!

222
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,320
Go on,

223
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,000
what do you need me to do?

224
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,880
Recently, there's been a murder case at Fan Tower.

225
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,240
The bodies were transported through underground routes.

226
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,950
I want to know

227
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,240
the transport routes.

228
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:04,760
She is from the authorities!

229
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,630
If the officials find out the routes, it'll be over!

230
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,630
No way.

231
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,240
Absolutely not!

232
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,070
If I give you the transport route map,

233
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:13,510
it would reveal the layout of the routes.

234
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,800
Those corrupt officials above

235
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,880
have always wanted to figure out the routes

236
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,200
so they can wipe us out completely!

237
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,150
And anyway,

238
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:27,000
what use is it to you?

239
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,160
To save someone.

240
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,850
That won't do.

241
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,950
The person you want to save isn't yourself.

242
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,360
Wuyou Cave

243
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,390
has never helped outsiders for free.

244
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,120
Then what do you want?

245
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,680
You're in my territory now.

246
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,710
You'll have to follow my rules.

247
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,560
Bring it out!

248
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,800
Great!

249
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,070
Great!

250
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,940
[Life; Death]

251
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,630
Do you have the guts?

252
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,200
Spin it and let fate decide.

253
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,440
Life or death is destined.

254
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,070
Wealth and honor are determined by heaven!

255
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:12,030
Life or death is destined! Wealth and honor are determined by heaven!

256
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:14,150
Do you dare?

257
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:23,020
[Life; Death]

258
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,150
This is the will of heaven.

259
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,270
Bring it out!

260
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,150
It will lead you

261
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:48,760
to the place you fear most in your heart

262
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,150
to face the person you dare not confront.

263
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,000
If you walk through, the clouds will clear.

264
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,830
If you fail,

265
00:15:55,830 --> 00:16:00,590
your soul will remain in eternal darkness.

266
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:16,950
You...

267
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:17,950
why are you here?

268
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,880
I should be the one asking that.

269
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,680
You were the one who cruelly left first.

270
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,360
I...

271
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,680
I had no choice but to leave.

272
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,470
You can leave too.

273
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,070
If I leave,

274
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,040
who will bear

275
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,710
Su Yue's regret and pain for you?

276
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,710
Back then, you left me alone.

277
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,360
I pleaded with you many times,

278
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,710
but you ignored me,

279
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:47,710
pretended not to hear.

280
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:53,760
Yes,

281
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,390
I was selfish.

282
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,680
I always

283
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,630
tried hard to completely forget you,

284
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,030
to completely rid myself of you.

285
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:07,840
But

286
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,230
I have never forgotten you for a single day.

287
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,080
The happier I am,

288
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,320
the stronger the unease in my heart grows.

289
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,100
I know it's because of you.

290
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,720
Do you blame me?

291
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,080
No.

292
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,800
I've never blamed you.

293
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:31,440
I'm

294
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,840
just afraid of you,

295
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:34,680
afraid that you'll

296
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,390
pry my hands open

297
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,990
and take away everything I'm holding onto.

298
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,230
That's not fear.

299
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,600
It's disgust!

300
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:48,350
It's just like how I disgust myself.

301
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,970
If we both feel disgusted,

302
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:53,720
then my existence has no meaning.

303
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,080
No!

304
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,320
Please, let go.

305
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:00,630
I'm begging you...

306
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:02,870
Give me the knife!

307
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,840
Give me the knife!

308
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,150
I can't take it anymore.

309
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,440
Why, when I've done nothing,

310
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,840
am I still tormented by so much?

311
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,630
Seeing you again

312
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,480
is really nice.

313
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,560
This time, I'll take you out with me.

314
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:30,330
Getting out?

315
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,920
What's the point?

316
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,510
Even outside,

317
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,030
I can't shake off this mess.

318
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,720
I never thought

319
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:48,800
that one piece of bread

320
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,440
would trap me in terrible trouble,

321
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,600
unable to escape.

322
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,440
Do you think

323
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,960
I'm a burden to you?

324
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,390
Not at all.

325
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:04,270
I've always tried my best

326
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,840
not to let you down.

327
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,150
Why?

328
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,390
Even though

329
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,230
you suffered so much

330
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,600
because of that bread,

331
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,600
I survived because of it.

332
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,510
One must

333
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:29,440
accept oneself in the end,

334
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,510
neither too humble nor too proud.

335
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,080
That's how you find your place in the world.

336
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,250
The world?

337
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:45,630
I want to see your world.

338
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,180
Is it bright?

339
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,370
Is it good?

340
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,630
Sometimes it's good,

341
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,720
sometimes it's not.

342
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,630
What's it like when it's good?

343
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,840
When it's good,

344
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,230
spring breezes for miles,

345
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,750
and plants competing to thrive.

346
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,990
And when it's not good,

347
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,630
tossing and turning,

348
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,270
unable to sleep at night,

349
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,960
just wanting

350
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:29,630
to kick the person beside me out of bed.

351
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:33,970
That sounds funny.

352
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,680
It's great that you're living for me.

353
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,600
Don't you want

354
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,730
to have a world of your own?

355
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:54,970
Me?

356
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,490
Would you dare to eat it again?

357
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:06,920
I'll join you.

358
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:22,150
Can I have my own world too?

359
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,230
When?

360
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,560
When...

361
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,680
you meet a fool

362
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,750
who buys you a white horse.

363
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,800
Don't let him slip away.

364
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:06,990
You did it!

365
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,150
You did it!

366
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,600
What's this about?

367
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:13,560
Fifteen years ago, that old man brought you down here.

368
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:16,410
I could see then that you had worries in your heart.

369
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,810
Now I'm giving you a chance

370
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,150
to walk out on your own.

371
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,390
Today,

372
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:23,800
I can say I've done right by your master.

373
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,150
Give it to me.

374
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,390
This is the transport route map.

375
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,680
Don't let it fall into the hands of the authorities.

376
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:35,990
Wen Yue,

377
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,660
farewell forever!

378
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,320
Don't you think it's strange?

379
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,390
Zhao Buyou, a man so stingy,

380
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,390
actually treated me to steamed dumplings.

381
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:51,030
What trick is he up to this time?

382
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:51,630
Boss,

383
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,410
this morning in Yulin Alley, there was a street fight.

384
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:55,460
In Yu Alley, someone stole wine.

385
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,200
In Yutang Alley, someone got bitten by a dog.

386
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:58,440
It's all here.

387
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,390
How's the list going?

388
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:00,150
All posted.

389
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:00,690
Any progress?

390
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:02,510
No real results.

391
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:03,600
Why not?

392
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,390
Very few of the families

393
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:06,750
of the missing women

394
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,030
have come forward to report.

395
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,080
Progress is slow.

396
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:09,970
Progress is slow.

397
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,680
Progress is slow.

398
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,800
As expected.

399
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:16,920
Why do you say that?

400
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:21,030
These women,

401
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,870
confirmed to be missing,

402
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:25,510
mostly come from poor, ordinary families.

403
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,720
They're confirmed as missing

404
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,870
is because

405
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:29,800
their families

406
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,690
at least reported them missing to the Kaifeng Court in the past.

407
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,870
What does this tell you?

408
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,640
It shows that at least their families

409
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,750
care about them.

410
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,270
Come on,

411
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,080
sit down and take a careful look.

412
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,270
The rest of the missing women

413
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,200
are likely from low social classes,

414
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,150
or they're orphans and drifters.

415
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,520
They are someone's daughters,

416
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:53,750
wives,

417
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,030
or sisters.

418
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,860
But even knowing they're missing,

419
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,610
their families don't come forward to report it.

420
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,320
It's either because of saving face,

421
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,080
not wanting to damage their reputation,

422
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:03,940
or because

423
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,510
no one really cares whether they live or die.

424
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,350
Your cold,

425
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:11,350
formal missing persons notice

426
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,580
is certainly useless.

427
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,960
More than half

428
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,230
of the suffering of this world...

429
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:29,270
is borne by us women.

430
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,720
Draft another notice,

431
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,560
this time saying

432
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,600
that the family of each listed missing woman

433
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,990
can come to the court to collect compensation,

434
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:48,840
two guan of money.

435
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,390
In less than two days,

436
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:51,440
I guarantee

437
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,980
you'll gather all the information on the missing women on the list.

438
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:57,960
As for the money,

439
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:02,030
take it from my father's monthly salary.

440
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,490
She's so filial, huh?

441
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:26,480
Zhao,

442
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,600
are you treating me to dumplings

443
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,960
or trying to get information on the case?

444
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,720
- Eating dumplings. - Another bowl, please!

445
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,440
Waiter, two bowls!

446
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,450
Right away!

447
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,170
This dumpling shop is pretty good.

448
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,270
The dumplings are well-made,

449
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,390
and the maker is impressive too.

450
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,440
Judge Wan,

451
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,870
you mentioned earlier

452
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:53,150
that the three victims of the Red Silk Case

453
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:55,030
had met

454
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,840
with a mysterious woman

455
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:57,750
before they died.

456
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:58,870
A mysterious woman

457
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,050
in black.

458
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,740
Do you know what she looked like?

459
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,110
She had her face covered.

460
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,580
No one saw her clearly.

461
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:05,440
Sir...

462
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,320
The bill, please.

463
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,630
- Right away! - Another bowl!

464
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:08,570
Coming up!

465
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:09,330
What are you doing?

466
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,370
Well...

467
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,760
I haven't touched this bowl yet.

468
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:12,730
Untouched?

469
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:13,440
Untouched!

470
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,630
I don't eat what others have touched.

471
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:17,600
Here it is!

472
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,160
This bowl is still mine.

473
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,170
All right.

474
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:21,410
What did you just say?

475
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:22,270
Nothing, forget it.

476
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:23,200
All right, enjoy your meal.

477
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,230
He's faster than usual today.

478
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,030
Did that woman in black

479
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,600
leave any clues about her whereabouts?

480
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,200
She hired a carriage.

481
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,840
When we found the carriage,

482
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,720
the driver took us to Quyuan Street

483
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,440
in the southern part of the city.

484
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,600
We searched the alley there for a long time

485
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:47,200
but found nothing.

486
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:48,960
What's the name of the alley?

487
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,320
Ban Alley.

488
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,840
Ban Alley?

489
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,390
There's a small, nameless restaurant

490
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,750
[Nameless]
in the front half of the alley.

491
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,030
Their grilled pork ribs are exceptional.

492
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,630
What are you thinking about?

493
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,270
Nothing.

494
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:14,720
I'm full.

495
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:16,920
All right then.

496
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:17,630
Sir,

497
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:18,280
the bill, please.

498
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,390
Got it!

499
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:19,920
No need!

500
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,750
I'll pay.

501
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:21,480
Sir,

502
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,750
tally it up.

503
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,600
I'll pay in a bit.

504
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,130
All right!

505
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:24,560
No!

506
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:25,360
Judge Wan,

507
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,180
I invited you out,

508
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:26,870
so I should pay.

509
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,680
Why should you pay?

510
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:29,920
I said I'll pay.

511
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:30,630
No,

512
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,720
I'm treating you.

513
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,680
You're treating me?

514
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,630
Then how would I cook the books on my expense account?

515
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:43,440
Wan,

516
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,200
are you always this straightforward?

517
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:47,800
Yeah. What's wrong?

518
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,150
Won't Inspector Gu hold you accountable?

519
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,720
Inspector Gu?

520
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,480
He despises dishonesty the most.

521
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,870
He hates secrecy.

522
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,030
I always handle things directly.

523
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:58,080
If it works, it works.

524
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,630
If it doesn't, forget it.

525
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,680
I never keep things hidden.

526
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:03,320
You ate six bowls today.

527
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:04,390
Later,

528
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:05,390
how many will you report?

529
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:07,870
Sixty bowls!

530
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,390
Now I'm getting a little hungry myself.

531
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:17,870
Can I also...

532
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,350
You're quite dishonest!

533
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,200
Sir!

534
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:25,630
- Another bowl. - Make it three.

535
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:26,080
Got it!

536
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,630
Are you that hungry?

537
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,480
Here!

538
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:05,800
Ban!

539
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,350
Yao He,

540
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,960
you can ride a horse?

541
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,750
I know a lot of things.

542
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:24,600
You'll discover them over time.

543
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,660
What have you found?

544
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,520
I asked around earlier.

545
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,990
They said they hadn't seen Aunt Su

546
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:46,410
in the supply area for days.

547
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,920
That means

548
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,990
Lu Sanzhen might be lying.

549
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:53,230
I've been tracking Lu Sanzhen here for some time.

550
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,320
I saw her paying respects at a grave.

551
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,320
She even seemed to be crying.

552
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:13,720
But look...

553
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,270
this burial mound is freshly made.

554
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:21,800
There's no headstone either.

555
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,030
I don't know whose grave it is.

556
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,920
Could it

557
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,270
be Aunt Su's?

558
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,920
Aunt Su?

559
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,560
Are you saying

560
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,840
Lu Sanzhen killed Aunt Su?

561
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,030
If...

562
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:37,510
if Lu Sanzhen did kill Aunt Su,

563
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:39,350
then why would she come here to mourn, burn offerings,

564
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,640
and even cry at the grave?

565
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:43,090
What if

566
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:45,150
it's because she feels guilty?

567
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,340
It's possible.

568
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,030
That makes sense.

569
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,040
We'll know whose grave it is

570
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:57,600
once we dig it up.

571
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:59,200
Don't rush.

572
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,350
According to "The Song Penal Code,"

573
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,350
anyone who digs up a grave

574
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,350
is sentenced to exile with labor.

575
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,480
If you open the coffin,

576
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,270
it's the death penalty by hanging.

577
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,230
If you don't open the coffin,

578
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,200
it's three years of imprisonment.

579
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:08,990
What does that mean?

580
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,510
It means anyone who digs up a grave

581
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,600
will face punishment.

582
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,840
If you open the coffin,

583
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,990
you'll be sentenced to death by hanging.

584
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,400
If you dig up the grave

585
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,080
but don't open the coffin,

586
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,160
you'll get three years.

587
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,200
Easy!

588
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,030
We can report it to the Kaifeng Court

589
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,960
and let them open the coffin.

590
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,480
Right,

591
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,630
that's smart.

592
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,960
Someone recently visited the grave.

593
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,440
Ci's disappearance is suspicious,

594
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,990
so I followed Lu Sanzhen.

595
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:41,750
She visited the grave because of a guilty conscience.

596
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:44,080
Uncle,

597
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:45,840
this must be a murder case.

598
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,820
I trust Ban's judgment,

599
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,390
but if anything goes wrong,

600
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,630
I'll take full responsibility.

601
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:56,800
Yao He,

602
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:58,920
you're quite clever.

603
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,320
You've memorized "The Song Penal Code" well.

604
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:04,200
Here I go,

605
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,630
digging up the grave.

606
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,750
But what if it's not a murder case?

607
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,270
Can you bear the responsibility?

608
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,990
It's still my problem, isn't it?

609
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,560
Stop messing around.

610
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:19,610
Let's go.

611
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:20,270
Judge Wan!

612
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,350
If you don't believe us,

613
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:25,030
please keep this a secret for Yao He and me.

614
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:26,440
No matter what,

615
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,800
I'm digging up this grave!

616
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,320
Did you learn something?

617
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:43,750
I did.

618
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,080
What did you learn?

619
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,090
I learned...

620
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:49,010
Trust yourself!

621
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:52,880
Dig!

622
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,760
Judge Wan,

623
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:06,880
we've dug it up.

624
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:16,960
Open it!

625
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:17,780
Yes, sir.

626
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:28,800
It's not Ci.

627
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,370
What?

628
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,380
It's not her?

629
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,390
Oh...

630
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:35,820
Zhao Ban,

631
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,290
why did I even trust you?

632
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:39,720
Uncle...

633
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:40,720
What now?

634
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,560
I...

635
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,520
What now?

636
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,350
Wasn't this supposed to be a murder case?

637
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:44,240
I don't know either.

638
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,370
Then who is this?

639
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,240
Wait!

640
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,110
I know this person.

641
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:48,760
Who is she?

642
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,500
Song Yingying from Jinxiu Embroidery Workshop.

643
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:52,040
I once met her at Welfare Center!

644
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,090
We are embroiderers

645
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:56,080
here to teach embroidery to the girls.

646
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,520
She is Auntie Song,

647
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,830
Song Yingying.

648
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,420
[Song Yingying]

649
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,830
She's on the list.

650
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:06,390
It's not a mistake.

651
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,960
It's not a mistake anyway.

652
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,150
She's on the list.

653
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,310
You still have the nerve to laugh?

654
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,070
You scared me half to death.

655
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:02,350
This is the place.

656
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,200
Judge Wan,

657
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,830
this is the room shared by Lu Sanzhen and Song Yingying.

658
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:13,390
This one is Ci's room.

659
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:15,520
Search.

660
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,870
Yes, sir!

661
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:21,760
Who is it?

662
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:23,850
Who is it?

663
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:32,070
Wen Yue!

664
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,150
I'm Dong Qian,

665
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,790
the Senior Judge of the Office of Justice.

666
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,280
I was supposed to capture a gang,

667
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,410
but you messed it all up.

668
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:53,600
You spent seven days ruining three months of my hard work.

669
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,590
Since when has the jianghu ever been honest?

670
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,920
Drink and eat meat!

671
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,110
- There's a small, nameless restaurant - Sir, bring some wine!

672
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:59,350
in the front half of the alley.

673
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:00,550
Their grilled pork ribs are exceptional.

674
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,200
Wine works better than medicine!

675
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,150
Here are ten skewers of grilled pork ribs.

676
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,070
All right.

677
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:08,110
A jar of wine.

678
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:11,760
Enjoy your meal.

679
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,390
All right.

680
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,350
Hero...

681
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:15,280
No...

682
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,390
Senior Judge Dong,

683
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:18,310
are you sure you don't need me to accompany you to the clinic?

684
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,390
Wine works better than medicine.

685
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,790
We ordered just one jar of wine.

686
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:26,390
Why did they bring two?

687
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,630
Regulars get a complimentary jar of their private brew.

688
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,630
Newcomers don't.

689
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,110
Next time you come,

690
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,280
you won't need to order it.

691
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,150
Here.

692
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:44,920
Eat up.

693
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,520
Sir.

694
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:56,830
Sir.

695
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,480
What would you like to order?

696
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,590
Two skewers of grilled pork ribs.

697
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,000
Why didn't you let me go down the well

698
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,240
with Wen Yue?

699
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,830
What's at the bottom of that well?

700
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,790
Didn't I stay out of it too?

701
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:14,830
Go investigate.

702
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:15,390
Yes, sir.

703
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,240
Investigating cases is dangerous.

704
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:21,760
Don't act recklessly.

705
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:23,760
Come,

706
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,240
let me take you search this room.

707
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,380
Then why can Wen Yue

708
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,630
go all the way down there?

709
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:30,170
She's skilled.

710
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:32,520
She's skilled?

711
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:35,440
She's skilled in her craft...

712
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:37,550
She's skilled in her craft?

713
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:38,870
Wen Yue

714
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:39,760
is able

715
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,450
to make umbrellas.

716
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:41,520
She can turn bamboo

717
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,110
into umbrellas.

718
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:43,960
That's

719
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,870
incredible craftsmanship.

720
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:45,760
She's skilled.

721
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:49,040
But she can go down the well...

722
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,240
Enough about her.

723
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,000
I don't know her well.

724
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,310
Go ask your brother if you want to know.

725
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,790
For now, let me take you to investigate this case.

726
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:56,830
Look,

727
00:39:57,350 --> 00:39:58,480
this room

728
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:00,760
belongs to the embroiderers.

729
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:04,390
Tie Chi.

730
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:05,200
Here!

731
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,040
Come over here.

732
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:08,960
Take these items

733
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,680
back.

734
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:10,440
Find someone

735
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,100
to compare them with the embroidery

736
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:12,920
on the red silk.

737
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,550
Understood.

738
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,580
Ci Rou...

739
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,960
[Ci Rou]
My mother said she found this.

740
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:27,000
Hey...

741
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:29,400
I'm not as good at autopsies as you are,

742
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:31,730
but you're inexperienced when it comes to investigations.

743
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,940
If you disturb the surface clues,

744
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:37,390
you can easily destroy crucial hidden evidence.

745
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:38,070
Understand?

746
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,550
Judge Wan,

747
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:41,980
there's a handkerchief in Ci's room,

748
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,200
identical to this one.

749
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:45,390
Really?

750
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:48,200
That one also has the characters "Ci Rou" embroidered on it.

751
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:50,630
They're good friends,

752
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,390
aren't they?

753
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:53,760
It's normal for them to have something similar.

754
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,110
This is what we call surface clues.

755
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:00,280
Come on,

756
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:02,000
let me take you over there to investigate.

757
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,440
Surface clues...

758
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,840
You sent Yao He to perform the autopsy on his own.

759
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:07,480
