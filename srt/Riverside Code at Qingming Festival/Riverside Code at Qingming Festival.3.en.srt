00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,110
What poison?

379
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,600
Stop meddling in things you don't know.

380
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,840
I just checked.

381
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:15,600
These men are not wearing the crew uniforms like the rest

382
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,990
and they have daggers hidden at their waist.

383
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,750
They have a lot of muscles,

384
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,870
which means they can fight.

385
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,030
It's not easy to kill them.

386
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:22,230
Besides,

387
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,720
they don't have any other injuries

388
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,480
other than the lethal ones,

389
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,920
which means they didn't struggle or fight back

390
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,440
when they were killed.

391
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,870
I suspect that they were pre-drugged.

392
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,200
Even if it's no poison,

393
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,200
it's some medicine that could rob people of their ability to fight back.

394
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,030
You still can't do it.

395
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,560
Before testing for poison,

396
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,750
we need to use the black locust water

397
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,960
to clean the silver needle.

398
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,680
That's how it won't affect the result of the autopsy.

399
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,510
You do it.

400
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,440
Sure.

401
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,200
What's up?

402
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,230
Don't get sick for being scared.

403
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,480
Let me check.

404
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,440
No!

405
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,720
It's okay.

406
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:30,960
I'll get better after a while.

407
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,600
I'll be fine.

408
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,750
Zhao Buyou

409
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,440
is interesting.

410
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,900
His whole family is interesting.

411
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,080
If the silver needle can't test the poison,

412
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,510
then this will work.

413
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,210
If the poison is weak,

414
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:53,920
then the silver needle won't be able to test it.

415
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,600
But by using hot vinegar to apply heat to the body,

416
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,150
the weak vinegar will be pushed out.

417
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,110
The rice ball

418
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:01,560
absorbs poison better than the silver needles.

419
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,270
Put it in the mouth of the body

420
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,150
and if it turns black,

421
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:06,480
that means there's poison in the body.

422
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:21,270
You are incredible.

423
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,750
It seems that I'm not

424
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,150
built to be a coroner.

425
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,350
Who released the mine?

426
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,230
What are you doing?

427
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,230
I just applied a little,

428
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,270
and it's already so powerful.

429
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:35,750
If I add more,

430
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,270
the whole house will break down.

431
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,960
You try…

432
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,320
Don't add too much stuff.

433
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,110
You may bomb the bridge!

434
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,440
Has the color changed?

435
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,230
Yes.

436
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,080
The color really changed.

437
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,720
Your method worked!

438
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,200
Can we be sure of the type of poison?

439
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,440
Why don't I smell it?

440
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,990
Smell it?

441
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,230
My nose has always been sensitive.

442
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,150
That's why my father

443
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,720
trained me to smell all kinds of poisons.

444
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,480
It smells like garlic.

445
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,630
Isn't that natural?

446
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:19,480
They needed to eat.

447
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:20,480
No.

448
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,350
Never mind. Put away your nose.

449
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,680
I'll see it for myself.

450
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,630
What are you doing now?

451
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,320
I'll cut the body open

452
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,150
and check what it contains.

453
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,440
No! You can't do that.

454
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:28,560
How about this?

455
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,990
Let's finish the autopsy on all these bodies

456
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:32,720
and see what's going on.

457
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,920
And then, we'll report to Inspector Gu

458
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,320
and decide what to do next.

459
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,030
Go check it out.

460
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:47,800
Yes.

461
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:57,250
Mo'er,

462
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,030
did we

463
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,150
succeed?

464
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,390
Lord.

465
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,630
Why are they so stubborn?

466
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,110
You were right, Boss.

467
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,440
He did it.

468
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,270
Elaborate.

469
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,840
It's the magnesia and sulfur.

470
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,030
I read a book about alchemy

471
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:20,990
which says

472
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,440
that burn the mixture of magnesia

473
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,440
and sulfur,

474
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,230
the light it creates

475
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:25,440
shins brighter than sunlight.

476
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,480
Yes. I saw it.

477
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,270
It's more impressive

478
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,350
than the fireworks.

479
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,110
I can't believe that.

480
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,080
Are you all right?

481
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:31,870
I'm fine.

482
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:34,560
So,

483
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,560
sulfur

484
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:37,150
can be bought everywhere

485
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,230
while magnesia is rare.

486
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,320
Did you check

487
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,110
where one can get some

488
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:41,990
and who's the buyer?

489
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,510
You should ask me that question.

490
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:45,440
This is a prohibited product.

491
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,840
It took some effort for the men I sent to get those.

492
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:50,440
No one other than government officials can do that.

493
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,680
Inspector Gu.

494
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,510
We've finished the autopsy.

495
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:56,810
There are four bodies

496
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,540
that are dressed differently.

497
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,440
They brought daggers,

498
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,970
and they were fighters judging by their body builds.

499
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:02,750
These four bodies

500
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:05,200
happen to be the ones poisoned.

501
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,150
What kind of poison?

502
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,480
It should be the red spider lily.

503
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,320
I smelled garlic

504
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,480
from their mouths.

505
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,600
It's not lethal if you take in just a little,

506
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:15,110
but it will cause a lack of strength and control.

507
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:16,150
Red spider lily.

508
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,600
I've never heard of it.

509
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,350
It grows in the Jiangnan area.

510
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,840
I don't think we can find it here.

511
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:22,350
No wonder.

512
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,150
All right. You guys can go back now.

513
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:25,720
Yes.

514
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,230
Ban'er, don't try to help without knowing the situation.

515
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:28,990
Trust me.

516
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:33,510
Inspector Gu.

517
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,110
Since Mo'er found magnesia and sulfur

518
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,320
and the light at the crime scene

519
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,680
came from the river,

520
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,390
could they

521
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:42,030
have been burning

522
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:43,110
magnesia and sulfur on the same boat

523
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,080
and created the bright light?

524
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:45,480
Did you check

525
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,200
the boats that were on the river?

526
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,920
Yes.

527
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:50,440
We detained all the boats at the crime scene.

528
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,750
There's no magnesia or sulfur.

529
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,800
So, is there any sign

530
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,510
of smoke on those boats?

531
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:56,720
Nothing abnormal

532
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,680
on the boats.

533
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,990
I have an idea.

534
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,040
Maybe we can try that.

535
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:03,800
Mo'er!

536
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:04,840
Mo'er!

537
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,150
Mo'er!

538
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:10,870
Mo'er.

539
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,080
What's the plan?

540
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:13,390
Boats get woodworms.

541
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,870
The sulfur in the bright light fuel

542
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:16,600
expels worms.

543
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,080
So,

544
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,720
we'll go smoke the worms out.

545
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,870
If there are worms,

546
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,320
they would have

547
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,990
been smoked by sulfur this morning.

548
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,150
The boat that doesn't have any worms on it

549
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,630
is the boat we are looking for.

550
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,320
Because it has been

551
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,750
smoked this morning.

552
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:36,800
That's right.

553
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,720
Even if other traces on the boat

554
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,750
can be cleaned,

555
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,870
it's impossible to get the worms back.

556
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:44,390
Can I come with you?

557
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:45,440
- Of course. - Ban'er.

558
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,560
Buyou.

559
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:53,080
Why are you here obstructing the work?

560
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:53,960
If Mo'er can help,

561
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,440
why can't I?

562
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,230
I don't want you to lose your job

563
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,560
and get scolded by Wen Yue.

564
00:24:58,750 --> 00:24:59,990
Do you mean I should thank you?

565
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,960
You should.

566
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:07,270
When I left home this morning,

567
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,390
Wen Yue was angry with me.

568
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,960
I'm worried that she might be struggling with it.

569
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:11,960
You

570
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,270
go home

571
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,800
and check on her for me.

572
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,440
Buyou, what did you do to Wen Yue?

573
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:20,750
Just go back and check on her for me.

574
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,110
You won't tell me.

575
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,990
Then I'll ask Wen Yue.

576
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,270
Boss.

577
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:27,230
This is the boat owner who transported Xiao into the city.

578
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,480
Speak.

579
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,320
People led by Mr. Xiao

580
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,990
boarded our boat in Yingtian Prefecture.

581
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,630
They asked us to keep our heads down

582
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:37,080
and forbade us to look at their faces.

583
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,440
The only thing I know

584
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,270
is that they are all big

585
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,390
and strong.

586
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:42,960
They went straight into the cabin

587
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,870
after boarding the boat

588
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,720
and asked us to sail directly to the capital city.

589
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,510
On the way here,

590
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,320
I heard some of the conversations

591
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,150
they had in the cabin.

592
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,440
They seem

593
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,720
to have mentioned

594
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,750
finding a pig head.

595
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:56,840
A pig head.

596
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:57,990
Boss!

597
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,440
That's the bunch!

598
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,320
Keep talking.

599
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:01,560
One of them mentioned

600
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,040
about finding

601
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,740
a lady named Fu Ling.

602
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:07,320
He said that she knew her way around medicine,

603
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,150
and he'd visit her every time he was here.

604
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,110
Fu Ling.

605
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,840
Father. You are back.

606
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,480
- Yes. - Father!

607
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,750
You smell like alcohol.

608
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,200
What are you doing?

609
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,270
A few days back,

610
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:26,200
the doctor made a prescription.

611
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,630
We are drying the medicines.

612
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,510
Buyou,

613
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,230
I know a lady who can give prescriptions.

614
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:33,230
Her name is Fu Ling.

615
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,510
She's a sneaky one.

616
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,080
I heard that she gives prescriptions

617
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:39,870
to a lot of men on boats.

618
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:41,840
They all feel better afterward.

619
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,080
Prescriptions.

620
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,510
What else?

621
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,750
They also said

622
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,480
that their master has a female junior apprentice.

623
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,080
A female junior apprentice.

624
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:53,800
Boss,

625
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,030
I'm thinking

626
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,990
that Xiao and his bunch

627
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:58,600
have definitely committed murder.

628
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,230
Fu Ling is his master's apprentice.

629
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,320
Who is this apprentice?

630
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,630
That's the masked person

631
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:06,480
who came out of the Bian River.

632
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:09,600
Judge Wan,

633
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,440
can I record it like this?

634
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,800
A female doctor from a clinic

635
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:15,600
named Fu Ling

636
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,800
is suspected to be the masked woman overboard.

637
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:20,560
Yes.

638
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,840
That's how you should write it.

639
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:23,960
Tie Chi. Fei Jian.

640
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:24,560
Yes.

641
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:28,560
Search for a doctor named Fu Ling in every clinic in the city.

642
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:29,510
Do you understand?

643
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:30,200
Yes.

644
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:30,750
Go.

645
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:33,200
Let's go.

646
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,480
Boss.

647
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:36,800
We witnessed

648
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,510
what happened this morning on the Rainbow Bridge, right?

649
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:41,080
Then I asked my uncle

650
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,150
to come.

651
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,150
He does painting for a living.

652
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:45,680
I told him

653
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,080
everything I saw

654
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:48,870
and he

655
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:50,230
drew everything down

656
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:52,800
in the painting

657
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,920
based on what I said.

658
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,750
This is the Rainbow Bridge.

659
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,390
I don't think the number of people

660
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:57,560
on the bridge is right.

661
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,350
Of course.

662
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,440
This is a diagram.

663
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,920
My point

664
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,630
is the Mei's Boat.

665
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:02,600
The scale

666
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:04,110
of the boat and the bridge is also not right.

667
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,990
Are you picking on me on purpose?

668
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,080
It's just about the painting.

669
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,030
Inspector Gu.

670
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,990
I know a painter

671
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,870
who drew the crime scene

672
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:16,030
from this morning.

673
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,680
I can get him here if you need him.

674
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,750
You making a recommendation again.

675
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:23,720
The fish on my boat are rotten.

676
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,720
This huge thing just happened out of the blue.

677
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,210
[Rainbow Bridge Pier]

678
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,270
Who knows when can things return to normal?

679
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,440
Who's going to compensate me?

680
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,630
What are you doing here?

681
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,440
- What's your business here? - State your business.

682
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,320
I'm here for the investigation. Inspector Gu sent me.

683
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,390
What investigation?

684
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:36,510
We already had such a long day.

685
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:37,750
Are you going to let us go?

686
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:39,560
Our goods on the boats are rotting.

687
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:39,990
What are you going to do about that?

688
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,390
I'll help you get rid of the worms.

689
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,200
Worms? We don't need that.

690
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:43,720
Leave!

691
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,480
Inspector Gu sent me here for the investigation.

692
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,350
He's wrong.

693
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:51,800
Inspector Gu

694
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,080
sent us to perform exorcism.

695
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,080
Exorcism?

696
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,630
A lot of people died in the river today.

697
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,110
The river is stained.

698
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,720
Inspector Gu is worried that the evilness

699
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,960
has boarded your boat.

700
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,560
I found it.

701
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:51,180
Mr. Zhao.

702
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,230
My painting

703
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,480
will help crack the case.

704
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,630
I just introduced you

705
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:56,390
to Inspector Gu.

706
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,080
You paint what you see.

707
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,960
Don't get ahead of yourself.

708
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,080
Was there a litter?

709
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,750
There was a litter,

710
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,030
two horses,

711
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:06,960
and three donkeys on the bridge.

712
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,840
The two donkeys were dragged.

713
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:10,630
A man was riding the other donkey.

714
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,600
The person on the litter

715
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,350
and the horse rider won't give way to each other

716
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:16,320
and caused a jam at the top of the bridge.

717
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:17,750
Do you think you can afford

718
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,080
the time of our lord?

719
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:25,960
Yes.

720
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,230
Yes. He has got all of that.

721
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,340
How many people

722
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,930
were on the Mei's Boat

723
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,840
back then?

724
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,230
27 people in total.

725
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:37,110
How many bodies did we find?

726
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,030
When passing the Rainbow Bridge,

727
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,440
the whole crew

728
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,600
was busy with the mast.

729
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,480
How come there are four people in the cabin?

730
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,510
What were they doing?

731
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,200
They were drinking.

732
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:50,270
They were drunk.

733
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,200
That's not right.

734
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,560
All four of them?

735
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,480
Inspector Gu.

736
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:58,320
How many people were poisoned did the coroner say?

737
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,200
There are four bodies

738
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,840
that are dressed differently.

739
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:02,630
They are fighters judging by their body builds.

740
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,350
That's those four.

741
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,390
Why are there four fighters

742
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,440
on a transportation boat on the Bian River?

743
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,320
How did a boat as huge as the Mei's

744
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,150
disappear into thin air?

745
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,110
Mr. Zhang.

746
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:20,920
Did you notice anything abnormal

747
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,600
when you were doing the painting by the Bian River?

748
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:24,990
There was.

749
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,150
This

750
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:30,920
was painted earlier this morning.

751
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:32,440
It depicts the west side of the Rainbow Bridge.

752
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,600
You can attach it to the other painting.

753
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,870
What's the abnormality?

754
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,270
Check the boat in this painting.

755
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,230
Which one

756
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,560
looks different with the boats usually sail

757
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,480
the Bian River?

758
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,800
The boats I usually see on the Bian River

759
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,750
install the anchor lifter

760
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,720
at the end of the boat.

761
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,920
This boat has an anchor lifter

762
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:53,510
installed on the top of the boat.

763
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,440
In addition, this one

764
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,840
is wider

765
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,080
than the others.

766
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,680
Both these boats

767
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,870
have rudders at the end.

768
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:02,080
But you didn't draw one on this boat.

769
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,920
Is it because it doesn't have one?

770
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,440
Yes.

771
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:06,320
Inspector Gu.

772
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,510
I found the boat that created the bright light.

773
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,990
It's a deserted small boat.

774
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,230
When the crime was committed,

775
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,680
the boat went back to the pier.

776
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,720
Several people sneaked out of the boat

777
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,680
and were never seen again.

778
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,480
The owner of the boat next to it saw everything

779
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,480
and got the wrong idea.

780
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,750
He took the boat for himself.

781
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:21,960
When we exposed his lie,

782
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,750
he said the truth.

783
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,150
The people who got off the boat

784
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,270
were the crew

785
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,840
and a man from Western Regions.

786
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:28,390
A man from Western Regions?

787
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,230
They are all over East Capital.

788
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,200
How are we supposed to find him?

789
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:37,840
Let's find this boat first.

790
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:40,560
I'm leaving.

791
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:41,920
Already?

792
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,630
Yes.

793
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,110
I need to go back to print the newspapers.

794
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,960
Thank you for your help today.

795
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:50,720
Don't mention it.

796
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,560
No need to thank me.

797
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:52,350
Wait.

798
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,440
I'd like to talk to you about something.

799
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,840
If you are going to write an article,

800
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,960
don't make mistakes

801
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,990
in the order of steps of today's experiment.

802
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,850
Common people

803
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,340
don't understand this, normally.

804
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,150
But

805
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,150
I will do that.

806
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:09,480
Thank you.

807
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:13,440
Mo'er,

808
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,320
your mortise and tenon toy is sophisticated.

809
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:16,920
Do you know about this?

810
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,320
A little.

811
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,600
Let me show you how to disassemble it.

812
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:21,560
That's okay.

813
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,350
I'd like to try that myself.

814
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,870
You are special.

815
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:32,600
People rarely appreciate this.

816
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,680
It is truly sophisticated.

817
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,680
I made it myself.

818
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,230
It might take you a while to disassemble it.

819
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:39,350
But it's okay.

820
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,680
You can bring it back and study it.

821
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,320
Mo'er, you look different

822
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,840
when speaking of the mortise and tenon.

823
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,110
I'll hold you to your offer.

824
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,350
Thank you.

825
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:53,440
Mo'er,

826
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:56,270
if you use your talent

827
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:58,600
on detective work,

828
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,600
you will achieve something.

829
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,750
Maybe you will

830
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,600
be able to help more common people

831
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,200
like you and me.

832
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,280
See you.

833
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,760
Inspector Gu.

834
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,790
Has Judge Wan and the other returned

835
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:25,550
from their boat searching?

836
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,760
The greedy pig met his fate.

837
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:30,590
Who are they

838
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:33,200
calling greedy?

839
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,550
It might be

840
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,440
someone like Li Yan

841
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,790
from 15 years ago.

842
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:41,000
Do you think Li Yan

843
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:43,440
is truly corrupted?

844
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,310
I actually noticed

845
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:47,760
something strange in the case file.

846
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,110
The boat

847
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:51,920
was loaded with money,

848
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,550
yet he and his wife

849
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,070
were wearing simple cotton clothes.

850
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,150
Besides,

851
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,240
their food

852
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,920
was quite simple.

853
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:04,960
Is it possible

854
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,350
that the fortune on the boat was a set-up?

855
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,350
That's just my own deduction.

856
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:15,680
Don't take it seriously.

857
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,680
Have you mentioned your deduction

858
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,830
to anyone?

859
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,760
No.

860
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,590
I dare not.

861
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,000
I mentioned it

862
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:27,870
to my boss,

863
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,070
Di Lun.

864
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,550
What did he say?

865
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:54,240
If you ever

866
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,630
spot anything when working with me,

867
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,200
you can talk to me.

868
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,150
Boss!

869
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,920
We found the Mei's Boat that disappeared.

870
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:32,550
It… It was hidden in a bigger boat.

871
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:40,590
Put your shoulders to it!

872
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:44,440
[Bian River Wild Beach, Suburb]
That big boat as the husk

873
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,000
is the suspicious boat

874
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,150
that Zhang Zeduan painted.

875
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,000
The Mei's Boat can fit into the belly of the big boat.

876
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,350
No wonder we couldn't find it.

877
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:53,240
Fortunately,

878
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,630
we locked down the Bian River.

879
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,240
Those wicked bunch can't get out of here.

880
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:58,550
So they abandoned the boat.

881
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,390
After you issued the order,

882
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,760
I brought our men and searched

883
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,760
along the banks of the Bian River.

884
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,590
That's how we found it.

885
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:07,960
- Careful! - Lift it up.

886
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:08,870
All right.

887
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:09,960
Is everything all right in there?

888
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,310
Be careful!

889
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,600
Come on.

890
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:15,440
Mr. Zhang.

891
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,790
Thank you for the trouble.

892
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,040
Mr. Zhao!

893
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:19,240
Mo'er.

894
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,760
Did you find anything?

895
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:23,870
The whole boat is made of paulownia wood.

896
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:25,720
The wood is light,

897
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,680
and the boat is a catamaran.

898
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,070
[Bottomless Catamaran, Middle Chamber]
These two think enclosed cabins

899
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:32,480
are sufficient to make the boat float.

900
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,870
The locations of the anchor lifter and the rudder are different

901
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:36,960
because the end of the boat is a gate.

902
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,390
Judging from its appearance,

903
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:40,830
the boat looks like a passenger boat,

904
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,040
but it's actually a husk,

905
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,070
and it has no bottom.

906
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,070
The gate at the end opens

907
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:48,000
and Mei's Boat can be pulled right in.

908
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,440
Make it simple when talking to your superior.

909
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,070
Just say that it's a big drawer.

910
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:53,350
Boss,

911
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:55,790
Di has never left.

912
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:56,630
He's right there.

913
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:01,390
Master Zhang.

914
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:03,630
Thank you for your help today.

915
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,720
Inspector Gu. Judge Wan.

916
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,350
Thank you so much.

917
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,000
We are fortunate to have you here.

918
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,590
Mr. Zhao, don't say that.

919
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:13,760
I should go now.

920
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:17,960
Mr. Di.

921
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,760
Mr. Gu.

922
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,790
It's quite the project.

923
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:24,150
Their project

924
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:25,870
of creating the omen is even grander.

925
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,680
I can see that Mr. Gu had decided to pursue the matter.

926
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,830
The omen is fake.

927
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,280
That's a crime of lying to His Majesty.

928
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,200
Do you think that one

929
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,760
cares about the genuineness of the omen?

930
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:43,440
All right.

931
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:44,440
It's getting late.

932
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:46,150
I should go back now.

933
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:47,760
Thank you for your hard work.

934
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:49,240
A grand project.

935
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:53,200
Boss.

936
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:58,680
We found several bodies inside.

937
00:38:58,870 --> 00:38:59,760
There's also a bronze furnace.

938
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:00,830
Slow down.

939
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,800
- Help me a little more. - Be careful.

940
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,560
All right.

941
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,520
It's a mixture of nitre, sugar,

942
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:32,240
and some spices.

943
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:33,440
I was right.

944
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:36,200
The smoke is made in the furnace.

945
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:40,200
I have definitely seen this furnace before.

946
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:49,720
Oh, I know!

947
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,280
It's a Thindu furnace!

948
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,960
I saw it when watching shows

949
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,040
in the business center.

950
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,480
Some people can perform a kind of light fireworks

951
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,240
or painting scenery in the air.

952
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,150
I couldn't have gotten my head around how they did it.

953
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:00,680
So I sneaked into their backstage.

954
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:01,870
They were using this kind of furnace

955
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:02,870
when making smoke.

956
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,720
Why did the boat owner say

957
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,040
that he saw a man from the Western Regions?

958
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,680
Most people can't tell

959
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,040
Western Regions people from Thindu people.

960
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:13,000
Judging from the current clues,

961
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,590
we can basically deduct

962
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:16,720
the whole picture of the crime.

963
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
- Someone… - Zhao Buyou!

964
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,200
You are a bit abrupt.

965
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:24,630
Is this how you do things at the Office of Justice?

966
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,760
Is deduction your work?

967
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:30,070
Let's hear it.

968
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:34,000
You do it

969
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,790
and I'll listen.

970
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:35,720
Someone

971
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,040
used Thindu light fireworks

972
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:41,110
and created the fake omen.

973
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,630
They put a furnace on Mei's Boat

974
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,680
and when the boat is near the Rainbow Bridge,

975
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,960
they release the smoke.

976
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:48,040
According to their plan,

977
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:51,000
Mei's Boat will be pulled

978
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,520
into this catamaran.

979
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:55,550
Mei's Boat's magical disappearance

980
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,870
is a part of this good omen charade.

981
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:00,760
Somehow, this show was obstructed.

982
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,790
- Apparently, there's another group… - It's a good omen!

983
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:03,870
…learned about this plan

984
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:06,110
and sneaked into the boat.

985
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:08,440
When it was the climax of this good omen show,

986
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:10,480
they killed the crew on Mei's Boat

987
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:12,480
and turned a good omen into a cruel murder.

988
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,070
In the meantime, the people on the big boat,

989
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,350
those who created the omen, don't know

990
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:20,550
the situation on Mei's Boat because of the smoke.

991
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:24,350
They pulled Mei's Boat into the big boat as the plan.

992
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:27,480
So, Mei's Boat disappeared nonetheless.

993
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:30,240
People who created the good omen

994
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,720
disappeared into the smoke

995
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,350
after the murder.

996
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:36,920
The ones who created the good omen

997
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,630
pulled Mei's Boat into the big boat

998
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,000
and found that all the people on Mei's Boat were dead.

999
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,200
They realized that things went south,

1000
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,110
and Inspector Gu has sealed off the Bian River,

1001
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:49,790
so they had to leave the boats here

1002
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:51,040
and escape.

1003
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,680
That's what happened.

1004
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,680
So, the point is to find the ones that obstructed the good omen.

1005
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:57,760
To find the ones that obstructed the good omen,

1006
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,790
we need to find the ones that created it first.

1007
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:00,630
So, the important thing to do right now

1008
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:02,440
is to find the Thindu man.

1009
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,680
I agree with him.

1010
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:07,720
Yes, Boss.

1011
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,480
As I've said,

1012
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:12,240
the important thing is to find the Thindu man.

1013
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:14,280
There aren't many of them in East Capital.

1014
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,680
It would be easy to find that man.

1015
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:17,480
