so can we

00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:36,440
enjoy ourselves a little now?

21
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,510
Alright.

Why is this carriage parked here?

This carriage

39
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,470
What about

40
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,000
this big barrel on the carriage?

41
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,110
It's a wine barrel.

42
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,080
I wondered the same while painting:

43
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,600
Why would the Women's Aid Society

44
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,190
need so much wine?

45
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:30,520
Exactly.

46
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:31,880
It's a wine barrel,

47
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,470
but it might not actually contain wine.

48
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,320
What about the mark on the horse?

49
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,600
It's a branding mark.

50
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,720
It's a fish symbol.

51
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,670
This horse belongs to Yayuan Mansion.

52
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,190

who else would dare run such a business?

00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,150

Didn't the doctor warn you?

201
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,550
It could lead to period pain.

202
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,590
Isn't it because of your incompetence?

203
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,030
Alright,

204
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,840
it's all my fault.

205
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,200

All you care about is the ledger.

440
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:37,400
You call yourself the head of this welfare center,

441
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,640
yet you show no compassion!

442
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,520
I disagreed to let her take the risk of sneaking into Yayuan Mansion,

443
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,920
but you insisted she go!

444
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,880

What are you doing?

463
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,680
We should report this to the authorities.

is with you.

473
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,430
Hand it over.

474
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,110
What... what ledger?

475
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,470

00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,880
What are you doing?

481
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,560
I told you, I don't have anything!

482
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:50,920
Well...

483
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,110
I didn't see anything.

484
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,290
Lock them both in the woodshed.

485
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,400
Get in!

486
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,710
- Be quiet! - Hey!

487
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:02,800
What's the meaning of this?

488
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,590
Mr. Shen!

489

Mr. Yang!

490
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,520
Aren't you afraid our families will report this to the authorities?

491
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,110
They actually locked us up!

492
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:15,230
Why do I keep ending up locked up everywhere I go lately?

493
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:17,520
What bad luck!

494
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,070
We turned Yayuan Mansion upside down

495
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:27,430
and found so many missing women,

496
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:28,680
but Ban wasn't among them.

497
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,560

499
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:31,920

501
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,800
where's Luan Hui?

502
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,110
Gu Zhen!

503
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,070
What are you doing here?

504
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,070
I came to help you.

505
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:42,610
You...

506
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:43,290
Don't worry.

507
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:44,280
My father doesn't know about this.

508
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,280
I came on my own.

509
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,000
Where to next?

510
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:51,880
Where is Zhao Buyou?

511
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,280
Boss!

512
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,110
Mr. Zhao has gone to Taoyuan Welfare Center!

513
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:56,520
He said Ban might be there!

514
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,880
Stop following me,

515
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,230
or face the consequences!

516
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,800
I'm coming with you!

517
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,160
Wait for me!

518
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,950
The Governor's daughter...

519
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,800
Head to Taoyuan Welfare Center!

520
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:20,190
Dear!

521
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,160
Dear!

522
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,590
There's trouble!

527
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:32,830
Dear...

528
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,400
you've got to find a way to save me!

529
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,950
Those absurd literary men's ridiculous nonsense,

530
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,520
you brought it on yourselves.

531
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,350
What does it have to do with me?

532
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,760
The ledger is missing!

533
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,880
You good-for-nothing fool!

534
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,830
You couldn't even safeguard one simple thing!

535
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,430
Wasn't it Father who told me

536
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:53,230
to record all the bribes we gave to officials?

537
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:55,190
I was just following orders!

538
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:58,590
My father wanted leverage against those officials.

539
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,040
Who told you to leave the ledger lying around?

540
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,640
If those documents end up in the court's hands,

541
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,560
it's a crime punishable by death for the whole clan!

542
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,400
I know. I hid it very well!

543
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,520
I don't know how it got stolen.

544
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,760
Who stole it?

545
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,530
It was that...

546
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:16,470
that...

547
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:18,000
that vile woman, Ci!

548
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,470
Come with me.

549
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,900
Is the Ci you mentioned

550
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,400
this woman?

551
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:41,700
That's right.

552
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,000
The ledger isn't on her.

553
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:56,070
Didn't you say she stole it?

554
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:57,000
Then where is it?

555
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,760
Didn't you say you went back to Yayuan Mansion to catch them?

556
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:01,880
Where are they?

557
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,190
If I hadn't foreseen you'd be unreliable

558
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:08,070
and sent someone to clean up your mess,

559
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,520
that Ci would've walked

560
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:11,800
right out of Yayuan Mansion!

561
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,680
You blind fool!

562
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,680
You blind fool!

563
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,880
- You blind fool! - Dear, stop hitting me!

564
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,880
She must have accomplices!

565
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,880
Yes, she must have accomplices.

566
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,430
The ledger is with her accomplices.

567
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:23,520
You need to leave now.

568
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,430
Hurry and hide!

569
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,110
Alright.

570
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,400
Find a way to sneak out of the capital.

571
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,110
Don't go back.

572
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,630
The farther you go, the better.

573
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:33,680
When all this blows over,

574
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,840
I'll send someone to find you.

575
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,230
Dear!

576
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:38,800
Dear,

577
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,870
but I can't bear to leave you.

578
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,750
If not for the bond we share as husband and wife,

579
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:49,080
I'd have already chopped you up on my father's behalf!

580
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,680
Very soon, the authorities will come looking for you here.

581
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,800
What about the ledger?

582
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,080
You useless fool!

583
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,960
What else can we do at this point?

584
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,750
I'll go find it myself!

585
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,080
Mr. He...

586
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:20,840
I'm sorry to have involved you.

587
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,560
It's nothing.

588
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,960
Thank you for helping me

589
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,150
keep the ledger a secret.

590
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:32,080
But why did you help me?

591
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,510
I didn't set out to help you.

592
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,580
I just didn't know how to react

593
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:39,690
at the time,

594
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,630
and I ended up locked up here with you

595
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:42,640
before I knew it.

596
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:44,990
Still,

597
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,600
Headmistress Chi did act rather oddly today.

598
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,200
Who would've thought she's the headmistress,

599
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:54,440
a cold-hearted courtesan with no principles.

600
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:54,990
You're not right!

601
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,960
She may have a temper,

602
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,560
but she's definitely a good person.

603
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,350
She herself was an orphan.

604
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:02,990
She can't bear to see these children

605
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:04,530
endure the same suffering she did.

606
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:06,840
To keep the welfare center running,

607
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,750
she travels everywhere performing.

608
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,350
She doesn't spend a single coin of the money she earns.

609
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,510
She's a good person.

610
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,510
Alright.

611
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,920
But given her ways,

612
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,630
I'm not comfortable entrusting her with the ledger.

613
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:22,870
The ledger...

614
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:23,560
Oh no,

615
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,170
I need to find a way out of here.

616
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,350
If she gets her hands on that ledger,

617
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:30,390
that would be bad.

618
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,600
Mr. He,

619
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:39,480
could you think of a way to help me?

620
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,080
You're locked up here.

621
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,440
Won't your family worry

622
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,560
if they can't find you?

623
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:47,600
I don't have any family.

624
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,800
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. He.

625
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,920
I didn't know about that.

626
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,270
I apologize.

627
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,230
It's fine.

628
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,480
There's no need to apologize.

629
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:17,760
Then...

630
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,440
have you ever tried looking for your family?

631
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:24,630
I couldn't find them.

632
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,750
You couldn't find them?

633
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,600
They died...

634
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,030
right in front of me.

635
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,230
It's alright.

636
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,740
It happened a long time ago.

637
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,320
Here we are!

638
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:53,390
Quick!

639
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:55,960
Here!

640
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:57,990
Ban!

641
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,510
Ban!

642
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:01,750
Ban!

643
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,680
Zhao Ban!

644
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,110
Zhao Ban!

645
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:07,270
This way!

646
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:09,800
Ban!

647
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,110
Ban!

648
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,320
Ban!

649
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:17,440
Ban!

650
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:21,080
I knew you'd come here soon.

651
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:22,840
Mrs.,

652
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,840
my sister is named Zhao Ban.

653
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,960
I heard she's here with you.

654
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,080
Do you know her?

655
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:29,920
Your sister is safe now.

656
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:30,990
Rest assured.

657
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,720
Thank you!

658
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,720
You know us?

659
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,320
Of course.

660
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,320
You truly carry yourself with distinction.

661
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:40,600
I've always wanted to test your skills.

662
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,390
How do you know about me?

663
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,560
Enough talk!

664
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,750
Zhao Buyou,

665
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:45,510
Yao He,

666
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,920
go find Ban.

667
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,680
Got it. Be careful.

668
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,390
Zhao Ban!

669
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:53,920
Ban!

670
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,150
Ban!

671
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,080
Zhao Ban!

672
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,270
Zhao Ban!

673
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:00,960
Ban!

674
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,270
You search that side!

675
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:02,840
Alright!

676
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:07,960
Today,

677
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,350
I'm going to challenge you!

678
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,390
Zhao Ban!

679
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,350
Ban!

680
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,350
Let's split up and search!

681
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:35,840
Alright.

682
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,230
Ban!

683
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:44,200
Ban!

684
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,150
Ban!

685
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,350
Ban!

686
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:04,990
With your clumsy skills,

687
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,150
you think you can take me on?

688
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:08,870
Speak,

689
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:10,350
who are you,

690
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,680
and why are you targeting me?

691
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,200
I'm someone who lives in your shadow,

692
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:15,830
unable to see the light,

693
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:17,870
destined for a miserable end.

694
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,390
Living in my shadow?

695
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,680
What do you mean?

696
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,870
- Why would you... - Search inside!

697
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,070
She came looking for you?

698
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:30,680
Why is she here?

699
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,390
Who is she?

700
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:33,110
Zou Mian's daughter, Zou Ziyin.

701
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,310
Sneaking around and targeting the Zou family,

702
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:44,310
did you think I wouldn't find this shabby place?

703
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:48,790
Hand over the ledger from Yayuan Mansion.

704
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:51,000
Otherwise,

705
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:52,150
you'll end up

706
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,480
just like her!

707
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,790
Sanzhen!

708
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,240
I was the one who placed the orders these past few days

709
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:02,070
for you to go against the Zou family.

710
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,310
Now they've come to our doorstep.

711
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:05,630
You took my money.

712
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,070
You should resolve my troubles.

713
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:12,760
So many people risked their lives to retrieve it.

714
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,240
How could I possibly give it back to you?

715
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,000
You won't hand it over?

716
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:17,830
Fine.

717
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,200
Flatten this place!

718
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,240
Yes!

719
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,110
If you help me today,

720
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,680
we'll be even, and I won't trouble you again.

721
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,170
As for the orders, we'll discuss later.

722
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,480
Hurry up!

723
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,680
There's one more!

724
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:57,830
Ban!

725
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,040
What are you doing here?

726
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:07,480
We heard a noise outside,

727
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,680
got scared, and hid here.

728
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,240
Alright,

729
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:11,960
just stay here.

730
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,150
Don't make any noise!

731
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,580
Stay hidden and keep quiet!

732
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:16,390
Everyone, stay quiet!

733
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,440
Ban!

734
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,150
Remember this:

735
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:31,720
the secret to martial arts lies

736
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,000
in focusing all your energy

737
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,150
into your hands.

738
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:37,240
Imagine they're made of iron,

739
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:38,830
unbreakable.

740
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,240
Kaifeng Court is investigating!

741
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,440
Arrest everyone!

742
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:11,830
Arrest them all!

743
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:12,680
Yes!

744
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:16,680
Squat down, don't move!

745
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,630
Don't leave!

746
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:19,040
- Squat down! - Let's see who dares to touch me!

747
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:21,070
Mere Kaifeng Court,

748
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:22,440
do you know who my father is?

749
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,280
Take her!

750
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:26,920
You...

751
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:28,280
you must have a death wish!

752
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:37,830
Where's Ban?

753
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,110
Ban!

754
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,550
- Yao He! - Ban, where are you?

755
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:41,630
Yao He, I'm over here!

756
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:42,330
- Ban! - Yao He!

757
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:43,440
Move aside. I'm breaking in!

758
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,440
What?

759
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,200
You...

760
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:49,150
Hold on!

761
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,070
I'll take you to treat your injuries now.

762
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:52,550
What are you doing?

763
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:53,940
