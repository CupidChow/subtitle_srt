00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,150
Officers.

195
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,240
What brought you here?

196
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,360
Have you seen anyone suspicious passing by?

197
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,150
Well…

198
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,440
How come

199
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,950
you two are in damp clothes, and your hair is wet?

200
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,680
Speak your names.

201
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,510
Where do you live?

202
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,710
What are you doing in this area?

203
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,630
What are you looking at him for?

204
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,080
I'm asking you a question.

205
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,920
Are you two together?

206
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,830
Officers.

207
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,800
This is my fiance.

208
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,950
We just had a lovers' spat.

209
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,470
We were pushed into the river

210
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,470
by the crowd.

211
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,800
I failed to protect her,

212
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,590
and she's angry with me at the moment.

213
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,000
We are honest East Capital residents,

214
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:52,300
and we live at the East Turret Alley.

215
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:52,800
The Zhaos.

216
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:53,830
The Zhaos.

217
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,920
Zhao Buyou, from the Zhaos.

218
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,960
As it turns out, I work at the Office of Justice as well.

219
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,640
Just this morning,

220
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,960
I met your boss,

221
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,960
Di Lun, Lord Di.

222
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,230
We are colleagues.

223
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,440
In that case,

224
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,280
may I ask about your position?

225
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,080
I'm a scribe at the National Archives.

226
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,790
A scribe?

227
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,880
Why are you even opening your mouth here?

228
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,230
Are you two a real couple?

229
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,400
How dare you to come here?

230
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:25,030
Is it not embarrassing enough to have dropped into the river for a fuss?

231
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,880
Are you trying to let the whole East Capital know this?

232
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,080
Do you not want to cancel the engagement?

233
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,640
Just say so.

234
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,200
Don't go nuts on me.

235
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,110
Listen up.

236
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,760
If you keep embarrassing me in front of

237
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,470
my colleagues,

238
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,000
I will…

239
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,320
I will call off the engagement.

240
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,780
Suit yourself.

241
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,110
You willful woman!

242
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,150
I have spoiled you, haven't I?

243
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,230
- You two… - Just watch me…

244
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:43,760
That's enough.

245
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:45,880
Bring your lovers' spat

246
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,670
back to your home.

247
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,280
You!

248
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,910
You are an embarrassment to the Office of Justice!

249
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,790
Let's go!

250
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:54,790
Take care, officers.

251
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:59,200
Wait.

252
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,000
[Maxing Street, East Capital]

253
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,150
Qingming cold food!

254
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,000
Date Swallow Cake!

255
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:16,550
Sir, come and try our newly harvested spring tea!

256
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,080
We should separate here.

257
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,520
I'm worried that the officers

258
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,710
are still onto you.

259
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,350
You are the only one who has been onto me.

260
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,790
So…

261
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,470
Why did you say that I'm your fiance?

262
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,670
You have no idea.

263
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,400
Those officers cannot be easily deceived.

264
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,080
If they got you,

265
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:38,910
they would torture you first

266
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:39,880
without asking about your reasons.

267
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,080
Other excuses won't be so convincing.

268
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,350
Aren't you worried that I might be a villain?

269
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,590
That's impossible.

270
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,910
You fool.

271
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:52,200
Speaking of which,

272
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,400
are you really…

273
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,000
A refugee!

274
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,320
My parents died early,

275
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,320
and I've lost my home.

276
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,640
The fireworks are on.

277
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,710
What are you looking at?

278
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,280
Am I the first refugee you've seen?

279
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,280
I've seen refugees before,

280
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,550
but not one like you.

281
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,000
Refugees

282
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,960
come from complicated backgrounds.

283
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,520
You get all sorts of wicked people.

284
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,230
Maybe I killed the man

285
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,670
on the boat.

286
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,520
How impressive!

287
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,350
Listen,

288
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:38,150
if you are caught, mention my name.

289
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,320
Maybe you'll get some special treatment.

290
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,660
I am…

291
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,350
A junior scribe at the Office of Justice

292
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,080
and a member of the Zhaos at the East Turret Alley.

293
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,280
Zhao Buyou.

294
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,520
Here.

295
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,400
I hope your love lasts forever

296
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,400
and that you have a peaceful and joyous life.

297
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,110
I hope all of us can enjoy a peaceful life.

298
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,710
Hey, it's still daytime,

299
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,910
and you drank up?

300
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,110
It's my day off.

301
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,550
Can I get started on the food now?

302
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,150
Go ahead.

303
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,960
Did you see what happened

304
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,670
on the Bian River?

305
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:38,280
I met with a bamboo supplier this morning.

306
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,000
I heard people talking

307
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,910
on my way back.

308
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,200
It was exciting.

309
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,590
Who do you think is the perpetrator of this case?

310
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:48,590
Could it be the same bunch from 15 years ago?

311
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,280
How should I know?

312
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,790
Weren't you pushed into the river by the onlookers?

313
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,200
Isn't that how you met Wen Yue?

314
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,520
It has been too long

315
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,110
that I can't remember clearly.

316
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,910
Wen Yue, do you remember anything?

317
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,840
I just got to East Capital at the time.

318
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,790
I didn't know anyone

319
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,550
or been to anywhere.

320
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,000
I was just following the crowd

321
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,910
and got pushed into the water.

322
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,400
I don't know anything more than Buyou.

323
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,320
How can you be so boring?

324
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,520
If you are so interested in the omen,

325
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,520
I can analyze it for you.

326
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,790
The omen must have been faked.

327
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:29,520
There has to be some sort of mechanism.

328
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:32,790
Good omens

329
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,670
are created by some brown-nosing

330
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:37,000
boot-licking…

331
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:37,880
Father!

332
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,960
We can't say things like that.

333
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:41,350
Why can't we?

334
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:43,150
Shhh. Don't say that!

335
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,910
Why are you two being so weird?

336
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,470
Never mind.

337
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,000
Let me tell you.

338
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,350
The identity

339
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,880
of those murderers

340
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,470
have been an unsolved mystery.

341
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:02,520
Some say

342
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,280
that they are swordsmen who move around,

343
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,520
and this is their way

344
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,710
of upholding justice.

345
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:08,790
Some say

346
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,760
that they are the people who were scraped

347
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,200
by the deputy transportation officer,

348
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,880
and this is their act of vengeance.

349
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:17,710
No one knows their names,

350
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,320
their genders,

351
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:20,520
their looks,

352
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,320
or their hold-up spots.

353
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,280
One more thing.

354
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,910
Who's the last person

355
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:27,590
who emerged from the river today?

356
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:30,400
Oh, right!

357
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,150
I heard that it was a female.

358
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,710
Wen Yue, have you caught a cold?

359
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,350
No.

360
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,960
Maybe a little

361
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,000
from last night.

362
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,400
Wen Yue.

363
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:50,110
I think your hair was damp when you got back.

364
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,320
Did you

365
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,150
get pushed into the river again

366
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,080
when you were watching in the crowd

367
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,760
and you are too embarrassed to tell us?

368
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:02,520
No.

369
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,320
Is this the Zhaos of Que'er Alley?

370
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,840
Who is it?

371
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,320
I'm the delivery man.

372
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,550
I'm here to deliver you food.

373
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,520
Coming!

374
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,710
Ban'er, check before opening the door.

375
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,840
I'm opening the door.

376
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,880
The Stewed Assorted Delicacies from Sunyang Restaurant.

377
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,710
It's from Xiao Yishui, the bamboo supplier.

378
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:27,470
Thank you.

379
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:28,520
Who is it?

380
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:30,200
Xiao Yishui, the bamboo supplier.

381
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,000
Mr. Xiao who hired me

383
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,670
I wish the Zhaos to be healthy and safe.

384
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,790
Thank you. Thank you very much.

385

386
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,840
- Open it. - Yes.

387
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,910
Wen Yue, is this

388
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:52,550
from the bamboo supplier you met this morning?

389
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,320
He's quite generous.

390
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,200
I want that one.

391
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,320

396

Wen Yue asked you to not eat it just yet.

397
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,560
Listen to her.

399

I'd like to talk to Wen Yue

401
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:26,520

406
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,230
No.

407
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,310
Maybe later.

408
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,590
Even I can't have it?

409
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,710
Our family is breaking apart!

410
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,880
It's just a meal. There's no such saying.

411
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,160
- Where are we going? - Mo'er!

412
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,520

Where did you get

415
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,680
the dry clothes after you fell into the water?

416
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,110
Kaifeng Prefecture is looking into this.

417
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,110

421
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,070

422
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,350

423
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:43,920

Even though I didn't say anything, it doesn't mean others won't.

430
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,800
When the officers checked my store, they said

431
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,710
that the investigation was carried out throughout the city.

432
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,040
When Lord Gu

433
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,110
was supervising the investigation at the crime scene by the Rainbow Bridge,

434
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:53,190
he said that he'd find everyone who was in the water

435
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,310
and were wearing soaked clothes.

436
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:56,680
You'd better think of something.

437
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,470
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

Anyone who has information about the ones overboard

440

can line up to exchange information for money.

441
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,640
I heard that the Kaifeng Prefecture inquired people across the city.

442
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,520
If we see someone with wet clothes,

443
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,470
we have to report it.

444
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,520
That's right.

445
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,520
The officers asked questions throughout the city.

446
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,380
It is said that they got the name list in a short time.

Oh, no.

00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:10,390
We arrived in the same year.

572
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:11,750
It has been over a decade.

573
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,110
Yes.

574
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:14,920
Here's the thing.

575
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,800
Is there anything

576
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,600
I need to change or improve

577
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:21,750
during work?

578
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:22,990
Why would you even say that?

579
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:25,110
From cleaning to organizing,

580
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,870
you are treating the archives as your home.

581
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,110
That's all within our duty.

582
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:33,080
Last night,

583
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:33,920
my wife…

584
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:36,920
There was a fire at the National Archives.

585
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,840
Did you know that?

586
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:40,200
Did you say that there was a fire

587
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,150
at the National Archives?

588
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,600
Don't be alerted. Sit down.

589
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,630
It happened because of a candle.

590
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:47,560
A few old case files were burnt.

591
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,600
At what hour did that happen?

592
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,870
At Xu hour.

593
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,960
No wonder.

594
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,200
I was off work.

595
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,390
So, who left the last?

596
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,110
Luo Zhun.

597
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,600
He was drunk

598
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,720
as always when I left.

599
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,990
He was sleeping on his desk.

600
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,960
Of course, it's him.

601
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,110
No, I…

602
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:15,990
I'm not saying that he has something to do with the fire.

603
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:19,200
I won't be able to protect him this time.

604
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,080
No, you have to.

605
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,200
Luo Zhun's uncle

606
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,010
is the Personnel Minister.

607
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:27,270
If you go after him

608
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:29,110
and his uncle comes after you,

609
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:29,800
what should you do by then?

610
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,630
I know that.

611
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,480
But someone has to take the fall.

612
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,200
We need to give our superior a result.

613
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:35,870
Let's take some time.

614
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,560
Let me think about it.

615
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,200
Zhao Xiaoliu!

616
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:41,870
No.

617
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:42,800
It can't be Zhao Xiaoliu.

618
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,510
He has some background as well.

619
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:45,600
This is troublesome.

620
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,270
So,

621
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,320
what's the usual punishment

622
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:53,350
for a fire

623
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,200
if the superior department pursues the matter?

624
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:56,800
It's just a matter of formality.

625
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,800
A few words of criticism, at most.

626
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,390
We just need to give them a result.

627
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,440
How about this?

628
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,080
Stop.

629
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,300
No!

630
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,230
- Zhao Buyou! - Listen to me.

631
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,920
You have nothing to do with this.

632
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,960
I am a part of this.

633
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,330
- But… - The most important thing

634
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,600
is that if no one takes the blame,

635
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,200
it won't be just you who's affected.

636
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,750
Everyone in the National Archives

637
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:23,990
will be affected.

638
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:25,800
- So… - You have such a kind heart.

639
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:27,920
All right.

640
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:28,870
I'll head back now.

641
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:29,440
What are you going to do?

642
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,990
Words are not believable enough.

643
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,080
I'll go write down the process of how it happened.

644
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:33,960
You don't need to.

645
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,110
Come with me.

646
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,840
I've written it for you.

647
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:45,030
You are always one step ahead.

648
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:46,200
You just need to

649
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:46,870
[Name Zhao Buyou]

650
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:47,560
leave your fingerprint.

651
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,390
That will do.

652
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,600
Wonderful.

653
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,260
[Name Zhao Buyou]

654
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,920
Why is my name already written?

655
00:27:58,390 --> 00:27:59,600
Or what?

656
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,510
Who else could it be?

657
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:06,100
[I voluntarily take a leave to review my actions.]

658
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,320
Why does it say

659
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,510
"take a leave to review my actions?"

660
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:12,110
I just said it.

661
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,920
It's just a matter of formality.

662
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,800
When the investigators leave,

663
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:18,150
I'll still be in charge of the National Archives.

664
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,270
I will

665
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:21,750
pick you up from your home by then.

666
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,630
In addition to that,

667
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:25,110
a promotion

668
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,840
and a raise in your salary.

669

[Name Zhao Buyou]

670
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:40,660
[Notice of the Office of Justice, Expelling Zhao Buyou]

671
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,150
I have to bring food

672
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:44,840
to the table of a family of five.

673
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:46,480
So,

674
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,440
I'd like to work for you.

675
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,110
I have more than one file.

676
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,110
I remember every case file stored

677
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:55,390
in the National Archives of the Office of Justice.

678
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,440
And

679
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,200
based on what I know about Di Lun,

680
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,720
he won't bring you the case file on a silver plate.

681
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,390
Sit.

682
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:14,840
Do you know why I want the case file

683
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,600
15 years ago?

684
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,030
Yes.

685
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,350
You think

686
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:23,110
that what happened 15 years ago resembles this case

687
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,110
in two ways.

688
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,510
One, the pig heads.

689
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,990
Two, the blood messages of "justice has been done."

690
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,560
I could offer

691
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,720
the third valuable perspective.

692
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:39,150
In Li Yan's case 15 years ago,

693
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,320
at the crime scene,

694
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,320
the same kind of wounds were found on every body,

695
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,390
all made by a triangular dagger.

696
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,840
This is a rare weapon.

697
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,840
Over the decade after the case,

698
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,920
I've never seen a wound like that in any case file.

699
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,230
If that is found

700
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,840
on the bodies,

701
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,110
[The weapon is a triangular dagger]
in this case,

702
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:57,440
I'm sure

703
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,350
that these two cases are related.

704
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:02,840
Check the bodies.

705
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,750
Let me see the wound.

706
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,270
That one.

707
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,990
My eyes are not tricking me, right?

708
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:25,720
I think it's him.

709
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:30,840
Zhao Buyou!

710
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:37,990
What are you doing here?

711
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,960
I heard about the case

712
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:43,440
and wanted to offer some clues.

713
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,840
What does this have to do with you?

714
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:46,610
Hey…

715
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,110
Listen up.

716
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,560
The Kaifeng Prefecture is working on the case.

717
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,110
The Office of Justice shouldn't interfere.

718
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,030
- Yes. - You got that?

719
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,920
Go home and rest.

720
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,800
Am I still a member of the Office of Justice?

721
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,230
Yesterday, you put up

722
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:03,270
an expelling notice

723
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:04,350
once I left.

724
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:05,720
Who are you trying to bluff here?

725
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:12,800
Yes.

726
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,320
You are expelled.

727
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:15,840
That's why

728
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,920
you have nothing to do here.

729
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:18,960
Leave.

730
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,510
Get lost!

731
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,750
Come and take a look.

732
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,390
Is this wound

733
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:32,800
caused by

734
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,150
that dagger you mentioned?

735
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,630
He knows nothing.

736
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,390
Prosecutor Di.

737
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,270
Did you

738
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:52,720
let this guy go?

739
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,990
Yes. We can't let him stay.

740
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,200
Then the Kaifeng Prefecture hired him.

741
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,680

742
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:04,320

You…

744
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:14,800
Do you have to be like that?

745
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,110

How come we still don't have the overboard record?

750
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,060
Tie Chi is recording the names in that room.

751
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,440
Inspector Gu,

752
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,920
I'll go ask Tie Chi to speed up.

753

Boss, here's the testimony from the onlookers.

754
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,350
Tie Chi, this is the list from the city north.

755
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:45,800
Is it complete?

756
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,270
Yes.

757
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:46,750
All right.

758
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,630
Tie Chi, the complete list of the South Street.

759
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,510
Okay.

760
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:52,990
Tie Chi,

761
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:55,110
Inspector Gu asked me to come here

762
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,350
and check on the overboard record.

763
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,030
Here. I just got the whole list.

764
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:57,800
Let me see.

[Mr. Wen, Wen's Umbrella Store]

766
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:14,960
Tie Chi,

767
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:18,320
why are the three lists written in different handwriting?

768
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,750
A lot of people participated in the collection.

769
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:20,920
It's natural that the handwritings are different.

770
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:24,110
How about this? I'll help you copy them

771
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:24,920
and then you can deliver the list.

772
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,720
That's not necessary.

773
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:26,870
The Kaifeng Prefecture

774
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:27,960
doesn't care about the red tape.

775
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:28,960
Boss!

776
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,440
I've got it!

777
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:41,510
The complete overboard record is here.

778
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,840
Why is the pig head moving?

779
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,390
Is it?

780
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:52,560
The mouth opened.

781
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,150
That's true.

782
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:54,320
I'll go check it out.

783
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:56,960
What happened?

784
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:57,840
Look!

785
00:33:59,080 --> 00:33:59,630
It's moving.

786
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,350
The pig.

787
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,920
- It opened its mouth! - Mouth?

788
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:14,960
What's with the fuss?

789
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,440
Boss.

790
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:20,590
What's going on?

791
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:21,200
Boss.

792
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:23,480
The pig head… It moved!

793
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,050
Yes.

794
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:25,200
It moved.

797
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,040

799
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:14,790
The pig head is high up there.

800
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:16,480
How did the toad get up there?

801
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:22,110
Boss!

802
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:22,760
Go find out.

803
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:25,070
Check where did this pig head come from and who's the buyer.

804
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:25,630
Yes.

00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,960
Go find everyone on the list.

806
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:37,660
Yes.

807
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:48,520
The pig just opened its mouth and talked.

808
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,070
What did it say?

809
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:54,630
There was a toad in its mouth.

810
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,280
It's probably because the temperature is low

811
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,680
and the toad wanted to get warm.

812
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,720
Are you afraid?

813
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:06,310
Why afraid of a toad?

814
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,070
The Kaifeng Prefecture has issued an order.

815
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:22,070
The case has to be cracked within three days.

816
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,280
I'm going to conclude

817
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,440
the situation of the case.

818
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:30,550
At Chen hour this morning,

819
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,790
a big boat

820
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:34,240
tried to go through the Rainbow Bridge

821
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,550
without letting down the mast.

822
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:38,720
I brought some people to yell at the boat.

823
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:41,870
Here's the key point.

824
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,550
The point is that I led the people

825
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,480
to awaken the crew,

826
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,440
and the crew let down the mast

827
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:53,520
to allow the big boat to sail under the Rainbow Bridge.

828
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,830
That's when

829
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,070
the frog on the bridge dispersed.

830
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:58,830
Squat!

831
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,240
Then, a big mass

832
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,280
of good omen appeared in this region.

833
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:04,440
The people were awed by the omen

834
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,070
and they were saying their wishes.

835
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,110
Then, the omen disappeared.

836
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:09,830
In the meantime,

837
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:10,830
the big boat

838
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,440
disappeared as well.

839
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,680
I concluded some clues.

840
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,150
Here.

841
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:19,150
First,

842
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,680
the boat did disappear,

843
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,550
but we found the owner.

844
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,960
The owner's family name is Mei,

845
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,280
so the boat is named "Mei's Boat."

846
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,350
According to the owner,

847
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,960
someone bought that boat

848
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,440
at a generous price a few months back

849
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:36,110
and asked him to deliver it

850
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:39,680
to an abandoned lake in the suburb along the Bian River.

851
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,310
He left afterward.

852
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,110
Second,

853
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,110
the bodies

854
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:44,960
are all pierced through by sharp pointy weapons.

855
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,660
We haven't been able to

856
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:48,960
identify the victims.

857
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:51,440
No one came to claim the bodies, either.

858
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:53,790
Third,

859
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,200
The murderer.

860
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:56,860
This morning, a masked person

861
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:59,280
was on the Bian River.

862
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,830
Because of the fog,

863
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:03,630
no one has seen the person's face.

864
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,680
We investigated all the people overboard or with wet clothes,

865
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,790
but all of them

866
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:10,390
had alibis.

867
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:11,870
So,

868
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,680
we don't have a suspect.

869
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:16,000
There is an important clue

870
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,680
that came from the Gate Guarding Department of the Ministry of Justice.

871
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,790
A few days ago,

872
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,870
there was a mysterious bunch

873
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,150
who travelled into the East Capital through the waterway

874
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:26,150
with fake customs documents.

875
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:28,000
The leader

876
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,720
was addressed as Mr. Xiao.

877
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,520
I wonder if these people

878
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,590
have something to do with the case.

879
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:36,960
The Stewed Assorted Delicacies from Sunyang Restaurant.

880
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,000
It's from Xiao Yishui, the bamboo supplier.

881
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,480
Zhao Buyou.

882
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,040
Yes!

883
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:47,590
Li Yan's case which happened 15 years ago

884
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:51,390
is quite similar to this case.

885
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,200
Tell everyone about it.

886
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:56,590
15 years ago,

887
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,960
- on the boat of Li Yan's case… - It's a long speech.

888
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:00,520
Sit down.

889
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:02,310
Sit.

890
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,240
In Li Yan's case which happened 15 years ago,

891
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:17,240
Li Yan was the only one beheaded,

892
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:19,440
and the rest victims all died

893
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,590
in a similar way of those in this case.

894
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:24,630
What happened to the perpetrators?

895
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,920
There were three perpetrators

896
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:28,240
who were eliminated by the Office of Justice on site.

897
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:30,550
Deducting from the content of the blood message,

898
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:33,550
someone thought Li Yan was corrupt

899
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:34,830
and upheld justice.

900
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,480
Prosecutor Di.

901
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,760
This is how the Office of Justice closed the case, right?

902
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,040
Inspector Gu,

903
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:47,550
you can't do this to me.

904
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,040
This man is no longer a member of the Office of Justice,

905
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:52,680
but I still am.

906
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,590
Without my superior's permission,

907
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:56,390
I can't say anything.

908
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:57,960
That's how the case was closed.

909
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:02,200
Prosecutor Di was the one who ordered me

910
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,550
to put the file in the National Archives.

911
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,790
What are you doing now?

912
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,240
Guys,

913
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,870
we asked you to gather here

914
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,630
to discuss the working route for this case.

915
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,630
Two possibilities just came to me.

916
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,590
First, is the perpetrator

917
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,760
imitating the old case?

918
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,830
Second,

919
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,520
I'm guessing

920
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:28,390
that maybe the Office of Justice

921
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:30,760
failed to cover all aspects of the old case.

922
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,310
Why are you saying that?

923
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:36,390
Just a guess.

924
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,830
The masked person could have slipped.

925
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,110
This "masked fish" is good.

926
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:43,440
I checked all the overboard people

927
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,920
and there's no sign of him.

928
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,720
Inspector Gu,

929
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,440
I have a suggestion for this case.

930
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,480
Let us hear it.

931
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,590
I believe that everyone has seen

932
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,040
the good omen today.

933
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,110
It's most likely fake.

934
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,590
I think it's necessary to look into

935
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:00,440
the creator of the good omen

936
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:00,920
and the method used.

937
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,920
Shut up!

938
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:12,630
Prosecutor Di.

939
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,070
Inspector Gu,

940
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:16,200
can we talk in private?

941
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,040
Mr. Gu,

942
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,520
now that we are responsible for this case,

943
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:34,790
if you look into the good omen

944
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,480
and

945
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,870
angers the one,

946
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,920
the Kaifeng Prefecture and the Office of Justice
