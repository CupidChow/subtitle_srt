You stayed out all night.

00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,550
treacherous, and unpredictable.

Well then, I'll take my leave.

What if I don't let you go?

166
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,480
The less you want from me,

00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,600
the more interesting I find you.

that when I see something I like,

171
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,280
I should paste a yellow seal on it

172
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:41,200
no matter whom it belongs to,

173
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,400
and then it'll be mine.

174
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,400
So, what...

175
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:52,760
what happened next?

176
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,670
None of your business.

177
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,590
Lady Zhang, be careful.

178

Zhao Buyou

00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,960
isn't like the others.

180
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,520
Enough.

181

I told you to hire more guards.

182

184
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,670
are already waiting in the front hall.

185

It's been so long, and Lady Zhang

186
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,440
still hasn't come out to meet us.

187
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:24,960
What an attitude!

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,670
What do you want?

192
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,790
To see Zhang Qiniang.

193
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:44,110
Lady Zhang isn't someone you can just barge in and see.

194
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,440
Are you out of your mind?

195
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:46,560
Hurry up

196
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,080
and leave.

197
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,560
Help!

198
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,760
Someone's breaking in!

199
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,470
You...!

200
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:59,080
Was everyone who came to see Zhang Qiniang a lunatic?

201
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,590
Excuse me, miss.

202
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,590
Who just broke in?

203
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,670
I did.

204
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:07,840
You must be joking, miss.

205
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,590
It was her.

206
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:09,550
Stop her, now!

207
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,910
I'm here to talk to someone,

208
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,550
not to fight anyone.

209
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:15,470
Who barged in?

210
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,440
It's you.

211
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,520
I'm here to ask Zhang Qiniang a few questions.

212
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:27,470
The Zhang Mansion isn't somewhere anyone can set foot in.

213
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,110
Nor is Lady Zhang someone you can meet on a whim.

214
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,400
This is perfect.

215
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,440
Show me what you're capable of.

216
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:34,640
Understood.

217
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,230
I'm a guard of the Zhang Mansion.

218
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,000
If you take one more step,

219
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,280
don't blame me for being rude.

220
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,520
How exactly do you plan to be rude to me?

221
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,110
I'm unarmed, you know.

222
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,320
I wouldn't want to hurt

223
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,080
a beautiful lady like you.

224
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,960
Would you like me to lend you my sword?

225
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,110
Talk about a sneak attack!

226
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,960
Weren't you offering me your sword?

227
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:06,880
Have you changed your mind?

228
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,760
Take it back.

229
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,910
A sword that can be given away so easily

230
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,710
must not be worth much.

231
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:23,470
Here, have it back.

232
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,400
Miss,

233
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,000
I'm also a guard here.

234
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,670
I can't just let you walk in.

235
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,470
And how exactly do you plan to stop me?

236
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:34,790
My weapon

237
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,670
is a bit heavy.

238
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,350
If it ends up hurting you

239
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,350
during our fight,

240
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,590
please forgive me.

241
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,710
Since you're using a weapon,

242
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,520
I'll use mine as well.

243
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,030
What kind of weapon is that?

244
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,110
Don't recognize them?

245
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,080
Are those

246
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,590
cinnamon-vines?

247
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,790
These aren't ordinary cinnamon-vines.

248
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:02,320
Apologies in advance!

249
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,590
If I'd been using a sword,

250
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,280
you'd be dead by now.

251
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,640
I've lost.

252
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,550
Remember to wash it with vinegar when you get home.

253
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,740
May I ask

254
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:33,350
what's so special about your cinnamon-vines?

255
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,640
I bought them at the morning market.

256
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,640
They're much cheaper.

257
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,640
Are you here because of what happened

258
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,230
at the property agency last time?

259
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,080
If you have anything to say,

260
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,280
I'll pass it on to Lady Zhang

261
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,670
word for word.

262
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,840
Just tell her to come out.

263
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,080
I need to speak with her in person.

264
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,350
Well...

265
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,670
Impressive skills!

266
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,400
Lady Zhang.

267
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,280
I'd only thought

268
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,110
you were beautiful

269
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,400
and decisive.

270
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,710
I didn't expect you to be so skilled in martial arts.

271
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,550
Hurry up and eat something.

272
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,400
We're waiting for Wen Yue to come back

273
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,080
and make cinnamon-vine soup for us.

274
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,080
Fine. Keep waiting, then.

275
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,440
Buyou,

276
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,350
what are your thoughts on the Hat Demon case?

277
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:34,840
Why are you asking about that?

278
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,360
Wu Xiang's body

279
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,350
wasn't pulled into the air by the Hat Demon.

280
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,080
It was suspended by ropes.

281
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,470
He was definitely

282
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,960
killed by a person.

283
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,640
Someone was using the Hat Demon story

284
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,880
to achieve a hidden goal.

285
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:48,850
Buyou,

286
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:50,930
what's your take on it?

287
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,150
You two

288
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,670
are not to meddle in this case.

289
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:58,520
It's too dangerous.

290
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:59,350
Do you hear me?

291
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,710
Are you investigating it, then?

292
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:02,760
Why would I?

293
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,230
Then why did you join the demon-hunting frenzy yesterday?

294
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,110
How do you know I went

295
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,710
demon-hunting last night?

296
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:16,880
I saw you.

297
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,670
Me too.

298
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,880
Wen Yue saw you too.

299
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,760
What exactly did you see?

300
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,790
We saw you

301
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,110
get into Zhang Qiniang's fancy cart.

302
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,080
Then why didn't you two

303
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,350
call out to me?

304
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,520
She just crooked her finger...

305
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,760
And you slipped right in.

306
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,150
What did you do in there?

307
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,440
Well,

308
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,320
you both want rooms in the south wing,

309
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,030
so I thought

310
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,150
I'd earn some reward money

311
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,080
to buy a bigger place

312
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,590
with two rooms in the south wing,

313
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:53,790
one for each of you.

314
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,910
You went into Zhang Qiniang's cart

315
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,400
to earn reward money?

316
00:14:59,150 --> 00:14:59,960
Buyou,

317
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,550
I never thought you'd stoop to this.

318
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,150
We despise you for it!

319
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,550
You two ingrates.

320
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:07,910
Get out of here.

321
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:08,840
Mind your own business.

322
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,320
Shame on you!

323
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,840
Found it!

324
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,400
I've found the money for wine!

325
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,710
Buyou,

326
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:22,790
look.

327
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:24,590
All right.

328
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,790
Take it and go have your wine.

329
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,520
It's odd. How did such a small sum

330
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,880
turn into this pouch of money?

331
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,350
Oh, Father,

332
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,440
how could you go through my things?

333
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:37,790
Buyou.

334
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,000
Buyou,

335
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,710
not all money

336
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,000
is meant to be earned.

337
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,080
Father,

338
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,840
do you know something?

339
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:00,150
When I saw that pouch,

340
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:02,110
I realized what you were hiding.

341
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,590
Don't take money

342
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:09,670
from that cart.

343
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,470
Father,

344
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,320
what are you talking about?

345
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,350
Enough.

346
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,350
Just go have your wine.

347
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,580
[Third day after taking the task]

348
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,710
This Peach Blossom Cream is made from a secret formula.

349
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,710
It's made with the finest motherwort,

350
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:41,470
infused with 49 kinds of herbs,

351
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:44,710
and mixed with honey.

352
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:48,400
After you use it, your skin will be radiant and smooth.

353
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,440
You'll see in a moment.

354
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,200
Most hosts

355
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,230
just serve tea and snacks to their guests,

356
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,200
but Lady Zhang, your way

357
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,790
of entertaining guests is truly unique.

358
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,440
Most guests

359
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:04,110
only bring fruits or pastries as gifts,

360
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,640
but you

361
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,190
barged in with cinnamon-vines.

362
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,520
Since your approach was so unconventional,

363
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,190
how could I receive you

364
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:14,070
in an ordinary way?

365
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,070
I have business to attend to at my shop.

366
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,280
Once I get my questions answered, I'll leave.

367
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,470
I knew you were something else

368
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,880
when we first met at the property agency.

369
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,710
I haven't asked your name yet.

370
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:30,160
Just call me Mrs. Zhao.

371
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,950
Mrs. Zhao?

372
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,160
Do you mean to say

373
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,560
you're Buyou's wife?

374
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,710
That's right.

375
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,640
So, you came here today

376
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,350
to ask about your husband?

377
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:48,920
Ask away.

378
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,830
What business did my husband

379
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,760
have with you last night?

380
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,520
Why did a man visit a woman

381
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,040
in the middle of the night?

382
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,680
There are plenty of possibilities.

383
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,110
Oh, here.

384
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,000
Try these.

385
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,310
Buyou loves them.

386
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,710
He said

387
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:09,190
they're best served chilled.

388
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,280
I know

389
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,640
Zhao Buyou well.

390
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,880
He may have a wandering eye, but he wouldn't dare cross the line.

391
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,520
Besides, a man like him

392
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,000
is hardly someone you would covet.

393
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,880
Then why did a woman like you marry him?

394
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:25,830
What did you see in him?

395
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,190
Naturally, I have

396
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,230
my reasons,

397
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:31,230
but I don't need anyone else's opinion.

398
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:33,070
Let's not waste time.

399
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,470
Tell me why he came

400
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,680
to see you.

401
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,430
The Hat Demon case.

402
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,190
Last night,

403
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,880
Buyou offered to help me

404
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,640
investigate it.

405
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,400
You know,

406
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,560
if you want to see how well a woman is doing,

407
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,430
her face only tells part of the story.

408
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,470
It's her hands

409
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,230
that reveal the truth.

410
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,710
You are beautiful and talented,

411
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:18,350
yet you're trapped in the grind of household chores.

412
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,680
Just one look at your hands

413
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,920
tells me you haven't spared yourself

414
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,350
from any hard work.

415
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,520
On the other hand, when Buyou

416
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,560
peeled lychees for me last night,

417
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,710
I noticed

418
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,190
how smooth

419
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,920
his hands were.

420
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,520
Indeed.

421
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:39,590
I can't bear

422
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,710
to let him do any work at home.

423
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,430
Those hands of his

424
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,640
are reserved for washing my feet.

425
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,590
And apparently, they were also used

426
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,350
to peel lychees for you last night.

427
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:05,780
[Zhang Mansion]

428
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,470
Don't water the pine trees randomly.

429
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,070
Stick to the vegetable patch.

430
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,070
Leave those alone.

431
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,070
I'm only good for rough work.

432
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,560
No wonder I can't keep these flowers alive.

433
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,640
What are these?

434
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,070
Shredded tripe.

435
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,070
Steamed ribs with rice powder.

436
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,430
You took a bribe again, didn't you?

437
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,310
Why else would there be such a feast?

438
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,230
Which case is it this time?

439
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,430
The Hat Demon case.

440
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:02,920
That much?

441
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:03,880
It's

442
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,880
from Zhang Qiniang's steward,

443
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,110
Kang Qian.

444
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:09,710
They want me to smooth over the Hat Demon case.

445
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:12,520
As always, I'm showing it to you first,

446
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,350
and then I'll distribute it monthly

447
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,040
to the veterans of the Jingyuan Army.

448
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,350
I've been handling

449
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:19,160
so many problems for you.

450
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,070
Boss,

451
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,190
taking this much money from them

452
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,760
is hardly unfair.

453
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,950
They're the ones getting a bargain.

454
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,430
Do you know how much chaos this case has caused?

455
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:31,760
The whole of Yanglou Street is in panic,

456
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,470
and property prices have dropped to rock bottom.

457
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,350
Have you arrested anyone?

458
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:35,880
Yes.

459
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:39,560
I arrested an errand boy named Sun Bo.

460
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,350
He was spotted at the crime scene last night,

461
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,430
and we have a witness.

462
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,070
A young

463
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,190
and homeless

464
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:48,830
male

465
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:49,950
who runs errands.

466
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:50,590
Boss,

467
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,110
even if he's innocent

468
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,280
this time,

469
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,640
just wait.

470
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,190
He'll cause trouble

471
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,800
sooner or later.

472
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,110
I call this nipping trouble in the bud.

473
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,110
Return

474
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:06,760
the money.

475
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,560
The Hat Demon case

476
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,000
is Zhang family's business.

477
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,680
You can't smooth it over.

478
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,110
Why not?

479
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,310
Boss.

480
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,760
Zhao Buyou is here to see you.

481
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:21,830
Come on in.

482
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,470
Inspector Gu.

483
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,880
Why haven't you gone home at this hour?

484
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,070
I'm already home.

485
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,560
You live here?

486
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:35,190
Life in the East Capital is too comfortable.

487
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,800
If I lived any better,

488
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:38,800
I'd start turning into one of them.

489
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,000
Have a seat.

490
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,280
I want to ask you about someone.

491
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,160
Who?

492
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,560
Zhang Qiniang.

493
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,070
You've heard of her, right?

494
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:52,800
I have.

495
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,400
Do you think she's connected

496
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,230
to the Hat Demon case?

497
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,400
Zhang Qiniang, Yanglou Street,

498
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,070
and the Hat Demon case.

499
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:00,680
Of course, she is.

500
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,160
What do you think?

501
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,800
I just find it strange

502
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,810
that she's amassed such wealth

503
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:11,470
at such a young age.

504
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,590
Who do you think is backing her?

505
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,710
She's dealing in real estate here in the East Capital,

506
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,760
and she's so young.

507
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,110
There must be

508
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,190
someone powerful behind her.

509
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,520
You'd better stay away from her.

510
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,430
Did you get entangled with her?

511
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,360
It's a long story.

512
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,760
Had fun with some woman, didn't you?

513
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,400
No.

514
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,760
I went to see Zhang Qiniang.

515
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,310
Let me give you some advice.

516
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,880
Don't go looking for trouble.

517
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,640
Is she really that dangerous?

518
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,160
Two years ago,

519
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,280
our court handled a case.

520
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:02,800
A young, handsome tutor

521
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,310
vanished

522
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,950
after teaching her

523
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,950
calligraphy and painting

524
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,350
in her mansion.

525
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,470
His family later came to report his disappearance,

526
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,520
but soon after that,

527
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,350
they disappeared too.

528
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,560
In the end, the case

529
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:21,190
was left unresolved.

530
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,520
She said something like this to me:

531
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,950
When I see something I like,

532
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,950
I'll paste a yellow seal on it,

533
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:33,310
and then it'll be mine.

534
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,230
What does that mean?

535
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,520
She actually said that?

536
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,430
Yes.

537
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,680
It's precisely because this is

538
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,070
a big case

539
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:48,110
that we can't afford to offend the Zhang family.

540
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:50,160
We don't want to offend the Zhang family,

541
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,760
but should we just leave the case unsolved?

542
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,800
The Zhang family

543
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,830
wants the Hat Demon case buried quickly.

544
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,190
But we represent the Kaifeng Court.

545
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,310
We must investigate every case

546
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,950
carefully and thoroughly.

547
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,230
If you put it that way,

548
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:11,070
I understand.

549
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,470
I know what to do now.

550
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,040
Zhao Buyou is going to investigate the Wu family.

551
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:14,760
Help him out.

552
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,590
I don't need him. I can handle it myself.

553
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,920
Fine, I'll work with him on this case.

554
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,070
Mo,

555
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:28,710
Ban!

556
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,110
Qiyu!

557
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:37,000
Our investigation yesterday turned up nothing,

558
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
and we nearly got caught.

559
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,520
I bet you couldn't write a decent article either.

560
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:54,000
[Young Craftsman Unveils Truth]
I rewrote one late last night.

561
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,860
[Behind Hindu Illusion]

562
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,350
And I changed "bitter ashes" to "bitter soil."

563
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,800
But

564
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,160
this is the only copy.

565
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,310
Let me

566
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,160
take a look.

567
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,070
It's the first time I've seen something like this.

568
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,520
As your good friend, he's certainly generous with praise.

569
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,640
Your supervisor is awfully picky.

570
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:15,590
Will he...?

571
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:17,110
If he complains, I'll just

572
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:18,830
take back that typesetting machine

573
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,070
you made for him.

574
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,310
So, where are we doing today?

575
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,640
Keep investigating the case.

576
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:25,190
Let's go.

577
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,110
All right.

578
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:31,260
[Kaifeng Court]

579
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:39,680
Why are you

580
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:41,800
dressed like this?

581
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:44,070
Yao He

582
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,830
always looks sharp and composed.

583
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:47,380
Dressing up a bit now and then

584
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:49,760
is quite a pleasant surprise.

585
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,520
Didn't we agree to re-examine the body?

586
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,710
How will you get any work done

587
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:55,520
dressed like this?

588
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,400
Exactly.

589
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,830
Don't worry.

590
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:58,710
Look.

591
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:00,230
It's perfectly fine.

592
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:01,710
I can work just like I always do.

593
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,070
Yesterday,

594
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,040
I found my father's

595
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,190
notebook.

596
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:09,110
And I

597
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:09,800
realized

598
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,830
some of the theories in it

599
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:11,880
might still come in handy.

600
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,640
Look.

601
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,830
This part, for example,

602
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,190
should work just fine.

603
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,520
Give me your hand.

604
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,040
Let's get to work.

605
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,490
If Wu Xiang died

606
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:52,520
after being hung up,

607
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:53,470
the discoloration

608
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:55,590
should appear at the extremities of his limbs.

609
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:57,400
No.

610
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:00,070
The discoloration

611
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:02,040
isn't concentrated at the extremities of his limbs.

612
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:03,190
Yao He,

613
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,590
give me a hand.

614
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,880
Lift him up for a moment.

615
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:10,640
Look.

616
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,000
The discoloration is concentrated

617
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,800
on the back of his limbs and torso.

618
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:15,040
If that's the case,

619
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:16,310
Wu Xiang must have been

620
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,880
lying face-up when he died.

621
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,640
Face-up?

622
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,430
That means

623
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,070
he was already dead

624
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:22,920
when he was hung up.

625
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:24,160
Exactly.

626
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,800
Step aside!

627
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,190
You're here.

628
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:37,760
Let's go inside.

629
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,280
Judge Wan.

630
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,310
How are you two holding up?

631
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,950
Where have you been staying lately?

632
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,040
Judge Wan,

633
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,560
after the incident,

634
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,490
my sister and I have been staying at our restaurant.

635
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:56,640
Tie Chi.

636
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,070
Yes, sir.

637
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,450
Introduce them.

638
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:02,640
These two are the deceased's younger siblings.

639
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,400
And this is Mr. Zhao, a litigation master invited by our court

640
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:06,430
to assist with the case.

641
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:09,400
My condolences.

642
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,280
If the Hat Demon isn't caught,

643
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:13,070
my big brother will never rest in peace.

644
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,040
Don't worry.

645
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,830
In all my years at Kaifeng Court,

646
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,640
there hasn't been an unsolvable case.

647
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:19,430
Isn't that right?

648
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,710
There's no such thing as a demon without a trace,

649
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,280
only killers who leave behind clues.

650
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,280
Well said.

651
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:39,350
Has anyone been in here

652
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:40,920
since the incident?

653
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:44,920
Yes.

654
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:47,070
A group of people came in last night,

655
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:49,400
but they weren't here to steal anything.

656
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,520
Wu Xiang's body

657
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,520
wasn't pulled into the air by the Hat Demon.

658
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,310
It was suspended by ropes.

659
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,640
He was definitely

660
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,950
killed by a person.

661
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:00,680
Someone was using the Hat Demon story

662
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,920
to achieve a hidden goal.

663
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:03,230
Zhao Buyou,

664
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,400
did you see anything unusual here?

665
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:09,590
Nothing so far.

666
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,430
Let's check somewhere else.

667
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,190
Lady Wu,

668
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:18,920
could you tell me

669
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:21,280
where your rooms are located?

670
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,350
The room on the first floor is mine.

671
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:25,430
The two upstairs

672
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:27,160
belong to my brothers.

673
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:29,560
May I take a look around your room?

674
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:55,230
May I open that cabinet?

675
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:17,880
Is this where you do your hair?

676
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,110
Yes.

677
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:23,040
The table is much tidier than my sister's.

678
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,520
Are all these items up there yours?

679
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,540
[Qibai Powder]

680
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,920
Is this Qibai Powder yours?

681
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,710
Yes, but I hardly ever use it.

682
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,800
This is a hand cream, right?

683
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,000
May I check upstairs?

684
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,470
Mr. Zhao, I can't go upstairs because of my legs.

685
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:02,680
Ao, why don't you take them upstairs?

686
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,520
Sure.

687
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,560
This way, please.

688
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,160
The room at the end of the hall belonged to my brother.

689
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,040
Wu Xiang seemed

690
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,280
like a big, rough man,

691
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,070
but his room is surprisingly neat and organized.

692
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,400
Has anyone

693
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,680
been in this room since the incident?

694
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,350
After the incident,

695
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,160
neither of us came back in here.

696
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:58,400
If he was lying face-up when he died,

697
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,160
then it's even clearer

698
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,470
that there's no such thing as a soul-sucking Hat Demon.

699
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:03,950
He must have died for some other reason.

700
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,400
Died for some other reason?

701
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,070
Then what could it be?

702
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,190
We tested for poison,

703
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:10,160
but he wasn't poisoned.

704
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,710
We checked for injuries too,

705
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
but all we found were

706
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,190
some minor, non-lethal head wounds.

707
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,430
What could have killed him?

708
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,160
People say that a dead body

709
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,590
tells its own story.

710
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:24,800
So what story is it trying to tell?

711
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,890
Wu Xiang, will you please tell us...?

712
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:30,950
Yao He,

713
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:31,950
look.

714
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:34,160
Why is his right eye so red?

715
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:36,230
Generally speaking,

716
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:37,680
if the right side of the head

717
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,160
suffers a fatal blow,

718
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,950
blood will pool in the right eye.

719
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:46,190
Didn't you check his head yesterday?

720
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:48,160
I might not have been thorough enough.

721
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:50,190
Gloves dull the sense of touch.

722
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,280
I'll check again.

723
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,800
There it is.

724
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,230
Is this your brother?

725
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:23,390
No, that's Han Xin.

726
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,040
Han Xin?

727
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,150
Why would one worship Han Xin?

728
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,910
To study military strategy?

729
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,280
Your family's in real trouble, I'm telling you.

730
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,910
Why worship Han Xin?

731
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,230
Everyone knows

732
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:47,760
Han Xin was Liu Bang's right-hand man,

733
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,390
but not everyone knows

734
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
that he defected to Han from Chu.

735
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,870
[Dates, Hei Sijie]
Have you been

736
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,080
studying military strategy

737
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:57,910
and plotting rebellion?

738
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:58,470
Are you spies

739
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:00,560
planted here by a foreign power?

740
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:01,600
Judge Wan...

741
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,560
Not necessarily.

742
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,430
Back when Han Xin commanded troops,

743
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:07,630
he invented some gambling games

744
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,910
to ease tension in the army.

745
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,670
Later on,

746
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:14,320
people who hoped to get rich started worshipping him.

747
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:16,670
That's impossible.

748
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:18,910
I've never heard of that.

749
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,080
What does it say on the back?

750
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,000
[Grant me wealth]

751
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,910
"Grant me wealth"?

752
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,670
And look at this censer.

753
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,320
If he wasn't worshipping Han Xin for that, then what?

754
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:31,840
Wait.

755
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,870
People actually worship Han Xin to get rich?

756
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,000
Do you know

757
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,600
what the dates

758
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,710
written here mean?

759
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:43,390
I don't know.

760
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:46,280
Judge Wan,

761
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,280
I'd like to take this for further investigation.

762
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:49,390
Go ahead.

763
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:52,080
Take me somewhere else.

764
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:52,760
Sure.

765
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:56,360
Worshipping Han Xin?

766
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,390
They're out.

767
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,560
Wu Xiang's room

768
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,950
is pretty clean.

769
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,230
Looks like he was a decent man.

770
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,360
It's a shame he had to die this way.

771
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:11,430
Something's off.

772
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,470
The neatness is likely just for show.

773
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,800
His wardrobe is messy.

774
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,600
His room

775
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,230
must have been cleaned by someone

776
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:22,390
who was trying to erase clues.

777
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,910
Also, did you notice

778
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,430
something was missing

779
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:26,230
in his room?

780
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:27,470
What was missing?

781
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,470
An oil lamp.

782
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,390
Right, there was no oil lamp.

783
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,870
There should have been one.

784
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,080
I saw an oil mark on the table.

785
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:40,670
That was where the lamp used to sit.

786
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:43,710
Personally,

787
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:46,600
I've never believed the story about a Hat Demon killing people.

788
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,710
Everything

789
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:50,040
must have been done by a person.

790
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:51,630
Your sister's here.

791
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:54,840
Get back here!

792
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:57,760
Calm down. Don't scare the kids.

793
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,390
What are you doing here?

794
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,430
We just finished examining Wu Xiang's body,

795
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,800
and we found a new clue.

796
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,080
Inspector Gu told us to report it to you.

797
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,280
"We"?

798
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,710
You mean they were with you, too?

799
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,520
Why didn't you listen to me?

800
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:16,470
Didn't I tell you to stay out of this?

801
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,630
Aren't you getting involved too?

802
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:19,670
The fish rots from the head...

803
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,560
I asked you first. Don't talk back.

804
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:23,670
Don't scold your sister

805
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:24,910
in front of everyone.

806
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:26,600
Be gentler with the kids.

807
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:28,630
What did you find?

808
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,870
You tell us.

809
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,430
Wu Xiang's skull

810
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:34,910
has a fracture on the right side,

811
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,280
and his right eye is bloodshot.

812
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,840
He likely died from a blunt-force blow to the head.

813
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:40,710
A blunt-force...

814
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:43,710
The oil lamp?

815
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:45,040
It's just a guess.

816
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:48,470
We'll need to look further into it.

817
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:50,560
Let me have a word with them.

818
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:52,190
Come with me.

819
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,120
Did you

820
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:01,840
sneak

821
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,040
into the crime scene last night?

822
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:08,150
The four of us went in together.

823
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,080
Listen.

824
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:16,430
Someone tampered with the crime scene.

825
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,840
Judge Wan is looking for those

826
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,150
who went in.

827
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,390
Now hurry back home.

828
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,390
Buyou, we want to help.

829
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:24,230
Help with what?

830
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,520
Enough. Go home.

831
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:26,870
Buyou...

832
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,150
Be kinder to the kids, will you?

833
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,390
You're too harsh.

834
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,430
So, what do we do next?

835
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,910
I'll keep digging.

836
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,150
Ban,

837
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,430
it was so brave of you

838
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,910
to touch the bloodied body

839
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:49,870
with your bare hands.

840
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,120
How did it make you feel?

841
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,040
I'm thinking of writing about a female coroner

842
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,150
in my next article.

843
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,040
I don't even know

844
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,840
if I can become a real coroner yet.

845
00:38:59,040 --> 00:38:59,670
Well.

846
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,950
- Just tell me how you felt... - Qiyu!

847
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:02,560
Try this. It's a new flavor.

848
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:05,430
Ban,

849
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:08,040
examining bodies isn't easy.

850
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,630
Take my father for example.

851
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,230
He's a seasoned coroner,

852
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,670
and even he makes mistakes sometimes.

853
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:15,190
How do you know what I'm thinking?

854
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,520
Because I've been through this myself.

855
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,840
What do you think I should really do?

856
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,040
I wanted to work at a clinic,

857
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,280
but I got dismissed.

858
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,490
Then I tried my hand at being a coroner,

859
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:32,430
but I missed such an important detail.

860
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:33,840
Why didn't I notice

861
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,520
that fracture on his skull the first time?

862
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,150
I've wasted so much time.

863
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:39,280
Don't think that way.

864
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:41,950
This case is full of mysteries.

865
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:44,470
If it hadn't been for you,

866
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:46,760
we wouldn't have made any progress at all.

867
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,150
That's not true.

868
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,120
You've been a big help.

869
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,230
But I couldn't have done it without you.

870
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,390
Why not?

871
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,670
Because...

872
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,950
Because I'm easily frightened.

873
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:58,230
That's true.

874
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:02,630
What's wrong?

875
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:03,870
Where did those two go?

876
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,840
Well...

877
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,390
I'll have one.

878
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,600
Sir,

879
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:13,710
I don't want ice.

880
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:16,560
I'd like to buy some saltpeter that you use to make ice.

[Female Wrestling Ring, Songjiaqiao Business Center]

882
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:19,470
Ladies and gentlemen,

883
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,080
today, two female wrestlers face off for the championship.

884
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:23,710
He Sainiang, the Lady Hercules,

885
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:25,560
is up against Hei Sijie, the Whirlwind!

886
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,600
Nice!

887
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:30,470
Feel free

888
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,520
to place a small bet

889
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,630
to add some excitement to the match!

890
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:33,560
Come on!

891
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,600
Will He Sainiang's strength win the day,

892
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,800
or will Hei Sijie's skill claim the victory?

893
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,360
Let the match begin!

894
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:44,470
Young man.

895
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:47,080
Could you tell me who those two are up there?

896
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,430
The one in gray pants

897
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:49,670
is Hei Sijie,

898
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,230
and the one in blue pants...

899
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:52,840
Nice!

900
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,800
That's He Sainiang!

901
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,360
My friend told me

902
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,670
to bet on Hei Sijie.

903
00:40:58,670 --> 00:40:59,360
Is it a good idea?

904
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:00,870
Who told you that?

905
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,670
Wu Xiang.

906
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,190
The eldest son of the Wu family, right?

907
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,470
He's a regular here.

908
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,470
That guy, well...

909
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:09,670
Nothing.

910
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:10,360
Never mind.

911
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:14,670
All right, listen.

912
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,040
He has

913
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,190
terrible luck.

914
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,560
He loses every time he bets.

915
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,840
I heard

916
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,760
he lost a lot of money

917
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,710
a couple of days ago.

918
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:23,360
In just one round,

919
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,390
he lost an entire house's worth of money.

920
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:27,430
He passed out on the spot.

921
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,150
Then I can't listen to him.

922
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:29,760
Exactly!

923
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,040
If you do, you'll lose everything you own.

924
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,560
- Don't listen to him. - Thank you so much.

925
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:33,470

If you needed something,

00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,080
you could've just sent a servant to find me.

No need to come all this way yourself.

I don't even know where I'm heading yet.

I haven't decided.

963
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:47,430
