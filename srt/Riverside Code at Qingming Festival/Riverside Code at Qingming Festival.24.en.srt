00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,640
you got us straight out of prison.

192
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,110
Does that mean you've taken care of everything for us?

193
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:07,550
To get

194
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,280
the two of you out this time,

195
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:15,350
I used every connection I had.

196
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,030
This half-day reunion

197
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,960
didn't come easy.

198
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,350
Half-day reunion?

199
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,790
Does that mean we have to go back

200
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,470
at dawn tomorrow?

201
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,670
I'd rather die

202
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,200
than return to that filthy place!

203
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,880
Even if you wanted to go back,

204
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,400
Father wouldn't let you.

205
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,520
Right, Father?

206
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,180
Sir,

207
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:42,670
by dawn tomorrow,

208
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,140
I'll...

209
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:43,670
No,

210
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:44,870
I'll take Ziyin

211
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:47,180
back to the South right now.

212
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,380
We'll live in the countryside.

213
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,260
I promise you, sir,

214
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,700
not a word of this will be revealed to anyone.

215
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,310
We'll disappear from the world entirely.

216
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:55,110
Sir,

217
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:58,580
please save me.

218
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,310
What are you doing?

219
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,670
It seems your husband

220
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,310
still doesn't know you well enough.

221
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:12,350
You were born into wealth and privilege.

222
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,870
How could you possibly live in seclusion in the mountains?

223
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,230
Sir...

224
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:19,870
Hui?

225
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:21,380
Hui!

226
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:22,790
Hui!

227
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:23,790
Hui, what...?

228
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,230
Father,

229
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,470
Hui may have done wrong,

230
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,260
but he did it for the sake of our family.

231
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,670
He is my husband.

232
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:38,790
Father,

233
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,430
please spare his life.

234
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:41,740
He is your husband,

235
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,310
but he's also married into the Zou family!

236
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,550
The situation has spiraled out of control.

237
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,030
The people are outraged,

238
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,500
and the Emperor is furious.

239
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,620
Cutting off an arm to save the body

240
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,430
is the only way to preserve the Zou family.

241
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,030
I know everything

242
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,580
you two have done

243
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,990
in the East Capital

244
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,550
over the years.

245
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:08,820
Luan Hui brought about this disaster

246
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,470
by exploiting the Zou family's power

247
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,550
to satisfy his greed.

248
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:18,550
Out of familial affection,

249
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,740
I pulled some strings

250
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,820
to get him released,

251
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:26,580
allowing him to leave with a shred of dignity.

252
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,670
That's already the most I could do for him!

253
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,430
In critical moments,

254
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,060
sacrificing oneself for the greater good

255
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,990
is what true family does.

256
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,430
If I let him live,

257
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,470
the entire Zou family

258
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,030
would be dragged down with him.

259
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,790
Sir,

260
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,500

261

00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,350
save me.

263
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,500
Save me.

264
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,430
Hui,

265
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,500
I've been with you for years.

266
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,620
Of course, I don't want to lose you.

267
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:12,740
But for the sake of the Zou family,

268
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,940
even if it breaks my heart,

269
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,870
I have to respect Father's decision.

270
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:21,110
Don't worry.

271
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,030
I'll take care of your family.

272
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,620
You can go in peace.

273
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:31,700
Zou Ziyin,

274
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,110
you're so heartless!

275
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:39,110
You're such a venomous snake.

276
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:41,700
I knew

277
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,670
you never truly

278
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,110
cared for me.

279
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:49,940
You don't deserve my love for you all these years.

Zou Mian.

281
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,060
Zou Mian!

282
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:03,500
I, a man of dignity, married into your family.

283
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,670
Do you think

284
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,700
I didn't know why you chose me?

285
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,550
I swallowed my pride,

286
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,230
endured humiliation,

287
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,500
and worked like a slave for you.

288
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:21,110
And this is how you repay me?

289
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,060
If I can't

290
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,700
live today,

00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,620

Without my family's support,

293
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,310
you would've been nothing but a poor village tutor!

294
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,550
You'd never have had the chance to even set foot

in the East Capital.

296
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,310
And now you're trying to kill me?

297
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,310
What a joke!

298
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,350
Why am I...?

299
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,260
Get over yourself.

You're just an abandoned pawn, too.

00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:24,700

what do we do now?

Zou Mian, that old villain,

310
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,820
has come to the East Capital.

311
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,230
We can't let him escape.

312
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,470
I've waited for this day

Why did you close the shop so early?

You're here.

318
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,260
This isn't like you,

319
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,310
Manager Wen.

320
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,910
It seems your luck's been pretty bad lately.

I know a fortune-teller.

322
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,140
Why don't I bring him over for a reading?

323
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,830
I'm not stopping because I think you've outdone me.

324
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,500
I just hate seeing you take out your frustration

328
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:19,260
I don't have friends here in the East Capital.

Come to think of it,

330
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,980
you seem to be the only person I can really

331
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,590
share my thoughts with.

332
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,340
I don't see you as a friend.

333
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:31,260
I see you as my rival.

334
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:35,260
Do you think my life is better than yours?

335
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:38,670
Now you're hurting my feelings.

336
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,070
That's not what I meant.

337
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,310
Well,

338
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:44,460
I admit I do envy you.

339
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,670
We've known each other for over a decade,

340
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,550
and I've spent just as long competing with you,

341
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,140
over the quality of our umbrellas,

342
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:51,950
the success of our shops,

343
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,260
and even the devotion of our men.

344
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:57,380
At first, I hated myself for it.

345
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,030
But eventually, I figured it out.

346
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,460

00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:02,950

00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,380
Without you as my rival,

351
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,910
I wouldn't have had the motivation.

352
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,100

00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,460
and even

380
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,310
lost the ledger,

381
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:32,030
which led to this disaster.

382
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,550
They gave

383
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,860
those who covet my position the perfect excuse

384
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,860
to attack me.

385
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:42,830
I can't even protect myself now.

386
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,190
If I'd let them live,

387
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,070
I wouldn't be able to escape suspicion

388
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,550
when the investigation points to me.

389
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:52,460
With the Zou family's future uncertain,

390
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,100
perhaps death

391
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,740
was the easier way out for Ziyin.

392
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:01,950
Master,

393
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,950
I'm sure she'd understand

394
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:07,140
your intentions in the afterlife.

395
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:08,980
Transport Ziyin

396
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,740
and her husband back to prison tomorrow.

397
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:15,380
Make sure the record says they died of illness.

398
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:16,380
Also,

399
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,500
spread the word that I'm hosting a grand banquet tomorrow night

400
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,190
on this ship on the outskirts.

401
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,500
It will surely draw unwanted guests.

402
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,380
Meanwhile, we'll slip away unnoticed,

403
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:27,860
like a cicada shedding its shell.

404
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:31,140
My years in the Manufacturing Bureau have taught me

405
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,980
the Emperor's preferences.

406
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:36,950
If I can present that stone to him,

407
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,980
it will surely delight him,

408
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,590
and all will be well.

409
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,980
After that,

410
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:45,620
I'll deal with the traitors one by one

411
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,950
and use them to honor my Ziyin.

412
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,380
It's starting!

413
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:54,070
It's starting. Let's go listen.

414
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:57,500
They say a rare stone

415
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:01,220
has been discovered in a lake down south.

416
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:02,950
A rare stone?

417
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,140
This stone is said to have been forged by the heavens.

418
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,790
It shines as brightly as the sun and moon,

419
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,430
symbolizing the prosperity of the Great Song.

420
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:10,220
Amazing!

421
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:11,620
Wonderful!

422
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,190
The Astronomical Bureau

423
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,910
observes the stars at night

424
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,670
and concludes that if this stone

425
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:20,100
can be brought to the capital at an auspicious hour,

426
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:23,310
the Great Song will enjoy eternal prosperity.

427
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,590
Really?

428
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:25,790
On this day,

429
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:29,260
the Emperor's favored official, Mr. Zou,

430
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,910
is ordered to escort the stone by ship

431
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:34,860
to present it to His Majesty.

432
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:38,070
This Mr. Zou is none other

433
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,590
than Zou Mian.

434
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:43,950
His reputation precedes him.

435
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,500
Some say

436
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:50,260
he's been extorting the people's wealth and oppressing the common folk

437
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,070
under the guise of collecting rare treasures

438
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,620
for the Emperor.

439
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,100
Inspector Gu,

440
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:58,980
Mr. Zhao,

441
00:22:58,980 --> 00:22:59,860
I'm truly sorry,

442
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:01,550
but I really didn't notice anyone

443
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:02,670
from the Ministry of Justice

444
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:04,460
passing by with the Luan couple.

445
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:05,430
That's all right.

446
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,790
You've already been a great help.

447
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,790
Finding clues in your painting

448
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:10,710
would've been a stroke of luck.

449
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,790
Not finding anything is perfectly normal.

450
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:14,670
Zhen,

451
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:15,830
let's come up with another plan.

452
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:16,860
I can help you.

453
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,740
Lady Wang.

454
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,710
How did you know we were here?

455
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,860
My father left the city last night.

456
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:30,260
Before he left

457
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:33,430
I overheard him discussing with some elders

458
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:34,980
about a secret meeting

459
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,340
with an esteemed guest on the river tonight.

460
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:38,340
An esteemed guest?

461
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,030
Zou Mian.

462
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,460
My father said they'd be going

463
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,910
to a wild forest

464
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:46,740
by the Bian River in the eastern suburbs.

465
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,030
Perhaps...

466
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,620
Lady Wang, thank you so much.

467
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,340
Inspector Gu

468
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,740
owes you

469
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,910
a big favor for this.

470
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:04,710
Right.

471
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,100
How are you ever going to repay her?

472
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:06,910
Wait, Buyou.

473
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:07,710
Buyou...

474
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:10,980
Found anything?

475
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,590
How do you plan to thank me?

476
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,340
- How do you plan to thank me? - Inspector Gu!

477
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:23,550
This is the place.

478
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:34,310
Here's to Mr. Zou.

479
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,430
Cheers!

480
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,380
Come on.

481
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,340
Let's have another drink to congratulate Mr. Zou!

482
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,860
This rare stone you found is truly something, Mr. Zou.

483
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,590
It's an auspicious sign.

484
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:51,460
It must be a heavenly blessing for Mr. Zou!

485
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,830
What a blessing for Mr. Zou!

486
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,260
You're sure to earn imperial favor!

487
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,710
What a heavenly blessing

488
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:59,100
for Mr. Zou!

489
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,740
- Yes. - It's all thanks to Mr. Zou.

490
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:05,790
Don't move.

491
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:08,190
Where are the others?

492
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,340
Please, spare me!

493
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,380
It's just

494
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,620
the two of us here.

495
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,140
Impossible.

496
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,620
I heard men's voices just now.

497
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,430
Thank you for your support, Mr. Zou.

498
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,710
Here's to you, Mr. Zou.

499
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:20,460
Madam,

500
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,380
we're shadow play and vocal performers.

501
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:23,220
Last night,

502
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,100
someone paid us

503
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,100
to come here and perform.

504
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,030
They told us to create the illusion that Mr. Zou was here.

505
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,260
It seems they were trying to lure someone in.

506
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,100
Catch the assassin!

507
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,430
Catch the assassin!

508
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,140
Hurry!

509
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,030
Follow them!

510
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:49,860
[Hats and Boots, Trustworthy Service]

511
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:57,420
[Shop for Sale]

512
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:02,980
Did you ask for me?

513
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,100
Wen Yue, you're here.

514
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,590
Are you planning to sell the shop?

515
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:09,340
I'm getting old.

516
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,590
I can't keep this up anymore.

517
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,140
Come warm yourself by the fire.

518
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:15,860
Come on.

519
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,260
Warm up.

520
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:30,460
There's no one in the cabin.

521
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,310
No one on the deck either.

522
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:35,860
The boat is empty.

523
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:44,190
That old fox Zou Mian played us.

524
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:48,670
Boss,

525
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,030
the Luan couple were our key witnesses.

526
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,500
What do we do now?

527
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,550
Without their testimony,

528
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,710
we can't link the ledger to Zou Mian.

529
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,500
Forget the evidence.

530
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:00,860
I'll take our men right now

531
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:03,380
to intercept him and finish him off!

532
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,550
Brothers!

533
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:05,220
Yes, sir!

534
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:06,220
Follow me!

535
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:07,860
Wan Fu, wait!

536
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:09,670
With so few men,

537
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:10,460
you won't stand a chance.

538
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,220
Zou Mian is heavily guarded.

539
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,380
If you go near him now,

540
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:15,220
it'll be a bloodbath.

541
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,340
None of you will come back alive!

542
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,340
I'm not afraid to die.

543
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:19,710
Are you?

544
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,030
No!

545
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:24,620
Gu Zhen,

546
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,380
say something.

547
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:30,740
Don't forget

548
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:32,550
what Kaifeng Court stands for.

549
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,590
It's a place where every grievance is addressed,

550
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:36,260
and every crime is investigated.

551
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,460
It's not a place for personal vendettas.

552
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,790
Zou Mian deserves to die,

553
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,980
but we should bring him to justice,

554
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:45,030
expose his crimes to the world,

555
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,190
and let the people of the East Capital see his true nature.

556
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:49,340
That's what we should be doing.

557
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,100
Brothers,

558
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:54,310
trust me. Don't go.

559
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:55,830
Inspector Gu,

560
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:57,910
please,

561
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,220
stop them.

562
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,550
Expose his crimes to the world

563
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:21,140
and bring him to justice?

564
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:21,790
Exactly.

565
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,030
I want that, too,

566
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,140
but I just can't.

567

You said you had something to tell me?

572
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,620
No rush.

573
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:06,550
You'll know soon enough.

It's been

15 years already.

576
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,500
I still remember the day

577
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:15,310
you and Buyou first met in my shop.

578
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:17,190
How did so many people die?

I need dry clothes.

588
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,500
what happened to you?

589
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,950
I got pushed into the river while watching the commotion.

590
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,140
What a coincidence.

591
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:47,620
Just earlier, someone else came in soaked

592
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,860
and asked for dry clothes.

593

596

I want to formally apologize to you on behalf

00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:37,910

I don't blame you

602
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:49,190
for keeping this from me.

603
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:51,790
I know

604
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,380
you were just trying to protect our family.

605
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,460
But at the same time,

606
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:00,830
I do hold it against you.

607
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:04,100
You didn't trust me.

608
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,710
You underestimated how much I valued

609
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:09,980
the Zhao family living in Sparrow Lane.

610
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:22,140
Even though I know the truth now,

611
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:25,100
I still feel the same way.

612
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,910
I still want us to stay together

613

Died in prison from an illness outbreak?

The information is reliable.

622
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,550
I just heard about it.

623
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:17,830
How could they

suddenly die like that?

00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:33,500
So Zou Mian wasn't trying to save them.

631

He got them out to kill them.

632
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:38,100
He'd even kill his own daughter and son-in-law.

00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:39,590
How ruthless.

Look at you. You've lost weight.

642
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:15,700
Right? I noticed it, too.

are not yours to bear.

I'm sorry.

You've done nothing wrong.

Do you really still see me as family?

662

What are you talking about?

663
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:31,870
You were just this tall

664
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,870
when I started living with you.

665
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,460
Didn't I watch you grow up?

666
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,700
Of course, I see you as family.

667
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:45,150
What about Mo?

668
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,390

00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:54,420
Do you still blame him for hiding the truth from you?

671
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:59,310
Of course, I understand

672
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,500
why he did what he did.

673
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,180
He just wanted to protect

674
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,700
the family we have now.

675
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,660
I don't blame him.

Do you hear me?

678
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:17,350
The ones who committed those evil deeds are the ones to blame.

679
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,500

envy others for having a mother.

688
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,900
But ever since you became part of our family,

689
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,310

726
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:25,150
I owe you an apology.

You don't need to apologize.

Wasn't your family also destroyed by Zou Mian?

736
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,500
I'm sorry your efforts were wasted.

737
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:55,190
I wanted to gather more evidence,
