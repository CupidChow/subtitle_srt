00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,240
As you know,

196
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,390
my brother

197
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:22,000
treats you as his biological sister

198
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,760
since childhood.

199
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,560
He never hides secrets from you.

200
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,320
You will not

201
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,390
leave him behind,

202
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:31,800
right?

203
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,240
Listen. Wen Yue.

204
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,390
To be honest,

205
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:41,880
I

206
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,360
won't walk away from our relationship

207
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,200
over the past 15 years.

208
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,070
Do you believe me?

209
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:51,680
I

210
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,510
don't allow you to leave me.

211
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,120
Could you shut up, please?

212
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,240
You've made us a laughing stock to our neighbors.

213
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,880
I don't allow you to leave me.

214
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,510
Just take a rest here.

215
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,070
Sit.

216
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,590
Sit.

217
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,590
Darling.

218
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,920
There is more than one

219
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,030
groundhog in the hole.

220
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,630
What does groundhog look like anyway?

221
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,510
Take care of dry goods.

222
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,560
Watch out for fire accidents.

223
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,030
Take care of dry goods.

224
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,360
Watch out for fire accidents.

225
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:12,920
No way!

226
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:13,560
Song...

227
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,030
Don't forget

228
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,390
what I have taught you.

229
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,710
No matter how hard you work,

230
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,710
you have to bend kneels in front of money and power.

231
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,000
I was a surrogate test taker.

232
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,150
I was threatened by someone.

233
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:31,120
I suffocated my ambition

234
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,760
by placing the name of others on my paper.

235
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,170
Mo.

236
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,330
Why do you get up so early?

237
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,020
It's three o'clock in the morning.

238
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:02,360
Have you stayed up all night?

239
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:05,800
Get some sleep.

240
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,180
Good night.

241
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,630
Where are you going?

242
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,700
[Wen's Umbrella Shop]

243
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,240
Darling. Why are you up so early?

244
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,320
What happened?

245
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,150
You look unhappy.

246
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,510
I know.

247
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,830
There is a lot going on recently.

248
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,470
It's too much for you.

249
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,760
I fought with you

250
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,150
only to

251
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,800
distance you guys from the murder case.

252
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:11,630
I felt so sad after fighting with you with those words.

253
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,030
I know

254
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,200
you did this

255
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,470
to protect the family.

256
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,560
Zhao Buyou.

257
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:23,000
I am scared. Really.

258
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,270
Twenty years ago,

259
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:34,000
my family died in front of me.

260
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,950
My real name is Su Yue.

261
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:40,510
My dad was an engineer at Taihu Boatyard.

262
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,120
Run!

263
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,590
Run!

264
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,150
Zheng.

265
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,950
Zheng!

266
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,240
Run!

267
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,270
Don't come back.

268
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,390
Later, the Court issued a notice

269
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,240
saying they had arrested

270
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:05,270
and killed the murderer, who were bandits.

271
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,680
You've known what happened to me later.

272
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,270
I was homeless

273
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,150
and wandered around,

274
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,070
ending up as a pirate.

275
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,440
I'm fine.

276
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,000
My tears have dried up

277
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,950
over the years.

278
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:28,080
My only concern is to protect the family.

279
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,590
I hope the five of us

280
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:33,920
could lead a peaceful life.

281
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:06,710
Do you

282
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,830
have good news for me?

283
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,710
You went home?

284
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,390
You two are back to normal?

285
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,320
It' privacy.

286
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,470
Unspeakable.

287
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,440
Good.

288
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:24,800
I'm happy

289
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,440
to know that you are back together.

290
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,320
I've pulled the documents

291
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,320
about those deadly fugitives.

292
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,510
I've found a guy that fits the description.

293
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:35,000
This man

294
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:38,030
hurt people with a super thin blade.

295
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:39,560
He was imprisoned once.

296
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,120
According to the file,

297
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,320
he has an eccentric character.

298
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,000
What's his name?

299
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,680
Shan Shiliu.

300
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,800
He is from Qian Prefecture.

301
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:50,000
His parents died when he was a child.

302
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,320
He had been bullied for years.

303
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,830
After he grew up,

304
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,590
he hurt people multiple times

305
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,680
because of his extreme personality.

306
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,710
On the way to banish him to Ya Prefecture,

307
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,590
he escaped.

308
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,120
Escaped?

309
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,120
No one knows his whereabouts.

310
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:04,990
He just vanished.

311
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,510
You are saying

312
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,510
Shan Shiliu

313
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,600
is probably the murderer.

314
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,320
Much likely.

315
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:14,990
Boss.

316
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:17,680
Boss.

317
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:18,600
The Academy...

318
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,920
What's happened?

319
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,750
Someone was murdered in the Academy.

320
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:27,800
What do we have?

321
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,150
Buyou.

322
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,270
Your brother is the main suspect.

323
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,750
Murder!

324
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,990
Murder!

325
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:51,990
[Academy]
Help!

326
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,630
Help! Call the Court!

327
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,870
Call the Court!

328
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,480
You mean Zhao Mo?

329
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,080
Yes.

330
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:01,390
- Director. No Way! - Calm down.

331
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:01,800
Zhao.

332
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,320
Calm down.

333
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,230
Wan Fu.

334
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,480
Go to the umbrella shop and notify Wen Yue.

335
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,440
Copy that.

336
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,230
- Gu. - Stay calm.

337
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:09,800
Impossible.

338
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,420
- My brother... - Come with me.

339
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,110
Let's go to the Academy.

340
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:13,460
Sure.

341
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:13,960
Sure.

342
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:14,800
Let's go.

343
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:17,350
Someone was killed.

344
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,680
What do those words mean?

345
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,270
Stay put.

346
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,630
Don't even try.

347
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,920
You cannot get away with this.

348
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,560
Excuse me.

349
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,510
Don't even try.

350
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,840
Who called the Court?

351
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,920
Sir.

352
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,150
It's him.

353
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,030
He is the murderer.

354
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,320
When I opened

355
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,920
the door in the morning,

356
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,030
I saw him

357
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,870
tampering with Supervisor Zhang's body

358
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:41,720
and keeping him

359
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,390
in a position of kneeling down.

360
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,560
If he were not the murderer,

361
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,750
who would

362
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,560
tamper with a dead body?

363
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,110
Look at him.

364
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,630
Blood is all over his clothes.

365
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,560
Blood must have been stained on his clothes when he was killing.

366
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,320
Enough.

367
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:54,960
We will decide if he is guilty

368
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,840
after investigation.

369
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:03,870
Officers?

370
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:04,510
Sir.

371
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,800
Bring him to the Court.

372
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,630
Yes, sir.

373
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:40,750
Mo.

374
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,480
Mo.

375
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,480
If you say something

376
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,800
- irresponsible... - Mo.

377
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,340
- we will arrest you, too. - I'm Buyou.

378
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,200
It's okay.

379
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,030
- Tell me. - Ghost Examiner!

380
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,720
- What happened? - It's the Ghost Examiner!

381
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,510
No way!

382
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,390
It's the Ghost Examiner!

383
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:07,110
Ghost Examiner!

384
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:07,990
Ghost Examiner!

385
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,600
It's the Ghost Examiner!

386
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,960
It's the Ghost Examiner!

387
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,510
Why won't they allow us inside?

388
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:23,870
Don't go there.

389
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,480
Since Mo is related to two cases,

390
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,230
Director Gu has to follow the protocol.

391
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,350
Don't make it too hard for him.

392
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,720
Why not do something about it?

393
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,510
Zhao Mo.

394
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,390
So, tell me.

395
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,230
What happened?

396
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,270
I...

397
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,080
I knew

398
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,510
that

399
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,270
Song Qiyu

400
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,350
took an exam for others under coercion.

401
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,230
Did he?

402
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,510
Why didn't you report to us earlier?

403
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,080
I was recalling something yesterday.

404
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:22,840
On the date of examination,

405
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,800
they actually

406
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,630
fought over the issue.

407
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:28,920
No way!

408
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,390
Song...

409
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,600
He became so emotional

410
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:37,990
because they were putting pressure on him.

411
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,800
But Song agreed their offer later

412
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,720
out of no reason.

413
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:46,750
Song's attitude changed.

414
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,680
I want to

415
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:54,510
consult Supervisor Zhang about something.

416
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,320
Are government officials

417
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:58,680
all righteous and incorruptible?

418
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,630
They won't engage in corruption

419
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:02,750
and twist the truth?

420
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:04,510
Song Qiyu

421
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:07,270
changed his attitude towards Supervisor Zhang for a reason.

422
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,150
I wanted to confront Supervisor Zhang.

423
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,080
When I arrived at the Academy,

424
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,560
I saw him

425
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:18,800
kneeling like that.

426
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,630
I remembered the wound

427
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:47,870
on the body of Song.

428
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,630
I wanted to compare it with Zhang Mei's wound.

429
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,440
Later,

430
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,510
the witness appeared.

431
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,560
Kong Er,

432
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,440
who died earlier,

433
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:01,960
was also a surrogate exam-taker

434
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,030
according to Song.

435
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,390
After Song was murdered,

436
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,870
I believe

437
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,510
these cases are connected

438
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,560
by surrogate test takers.

439
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,960
Why didn't you

440
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,870
report what you know to us?

441
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:18,560
It happened all the time.

442
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,600
You did nothing about it.

443
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,080
What's the point of reporting it to you?

444
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,560
We did nothing

445
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,400
because we didn't get the clue.

446
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,110
Fine.

447
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:33,960
What about the mule man

448
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,520
who was beat to death in Taohuadong Brothel?

449
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,080
I reported the case to you.

450
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:40,030
You still did nothing.

451
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,440
Zhao Mo.

452
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,080
I'm so hurt

453
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,200
about your accusation.

454
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,510
I arrested those people.

455
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,200
You saw it. Right?

456
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:53,870
Have I made the arrest?

457
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:54,630
Definitely.

458
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:56,480
You told us

459
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,320
that they beat the man to death.

460
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,110
- But it's... - That's because they bribed the witnesses.

461
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:01,270
Why didn't you investigate?

462
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:01,920
Sit!

463
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,870
You did nothing!

464
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,230
Nothing!

465
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,390
Sit!

466
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:06,510
You did nothing!

467
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,750
Sit! Understand?

468
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:09,150
Stop!

469
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,320
Darling!

470
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,230
It was because you did nothing!

471
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,630
- Sorry. - Zhao Buyou.

472
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,990
You are completely useless.

473
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,080
Are you alright, Mo?

474
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:18,680
Wen Yue.

475
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,680
I've told them the truth.

476
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,480
But they did nothing.

477
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,200
It's them to blame.

478
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,110
Watch your words!

479
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:22,680
Mo.

480
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:23,990
Calm down.

481
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:26,630
Director Gu.

482
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,720
If there were surrogate exam-takers before,

483
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:31,630
is it possible that

484
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,510
these students have been killed?

485
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,990
Director Gu.

486
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:39,270
There is a lot of crimes going on

487
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,960
even in East Capital.

488
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,680
No all missing persons

489
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,960
or unknown bodies

490
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,560
would be reported to Kaifeng Court.

491
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,840
Send you man to gather information from tomb raiders

492
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:51,720
or body traffickers.

493
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,870
Maybe you would have some clues.

494
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,350
Well,

495
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,230
I will review all case files

496
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:03,630
about missing test takers over the decade.

497
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:04,440
Ok.

498
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,600
I will pull the name list of test takers from Ministry of Rites.

499
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:11,720
Wen Yue.

500
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:20,230
Mo.

501
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:23,440
I'll prove your innocence.

502
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:24,560
Wait for me.

503
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,270
Heard?

504
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:31,800
Mrs. Wen.

505
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,320
You said who may provide

506
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,390
useful tips?

507
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:37,270
Tomb raiders

508
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:39,440
or body traffickers.

509
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:40,200
Let's go. Mo.

510
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:43,390
Wait.

511
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:44,270
I...

512
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:44,990
still want...

513
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,320
Take care.

514
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,480
Excuse me. Move!

515
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:50,800
Mo.

516
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:53,200
Don't discard the clothes

517
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,200
you take off later.

518
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:56,680
Let's go home and have a rest.

519
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,750
Buyou will find the truth for us.

520
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,480
No need to worry.

521
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,270
Take it easy.

522
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,080
Wen Yue.

523
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:09,230
Why did Buyou and you

524
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:10,510
approach

525
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,750
Song Qiyu that day?

526
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,080
Suspect of the Mei's Boat case was killed.

527
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,350
Buyou, Director Gu and I

528
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,720
decided to find the murderer.

529
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,920
Buyou and I were following the target all the way

530
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,680
to the back alley of Great Shop of Mules and Horses.

531
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:27,110
Then we lost the target.

532
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,630
I saw Song

533
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,110
entering a courtyard over there.

534
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:34,630
Wen Yue.

535
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,150
Where did you see him?

536
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:38,150
Back alley of Great Shop of Mules and Horses.

537
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:42,510
What's wrong, Mo?

538
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:44,270
Nothing.

539
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,510
I have to go somewhere.

540
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,740
- Wen Yue. Go home now. - Look.

541
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:48,840
No.

542
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:50,390
You just witnessed a murder case.

543
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,630
I'm so worried

544
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:52,870
about your situation.

545
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,720
Come on. Wen Yue.

546
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:57,840
Fine.

547
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,110
I would follow you from distance,

548
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:01,390
okay?

549
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,510
Okay.

550
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,350
Go.

551
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,840
[Great Shop of Mules and Horses]
Look at this horse.

552
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,480
It is ready for cargo or riding.

553
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,390
Have a look.

554
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:17,680
Come on.

555
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,270
See for yourself.

556
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,390
You cannot miss this one.

557
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,080
Come on.

558
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:23,990
Stop eating

559
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,480
if you are full.

560
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:27,800
Everyone.

561
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:30,080
Don't miss it.

562
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,960
It's best of the best.

563
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,200
More discount, please.

564
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:39,960
Sir.

565
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:40,510
Sir.

566
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:42,320
Do you know someone

567
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,200
called Song Qiyu?

568
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,440
No.

569
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,510
You can ask around there.

570
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:47,600
Sir.

571
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:49,600
This is strong mule.

572
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,680
No discount?

573
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,250
Sir.

574
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,030
Do you know someone

called Song Qiyu?

576
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,080
No.

Buddha.

578
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:35,920
I've been following laws

579
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,630
and doing good deeds my entire life.

580
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,510

Who is this?

584
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,320
Sir.

585
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,110
Do you know someone

586
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,080
who is of a similar age to me?

587
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,150
His surname is Song,

588
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:55,800
and he is a scholar.

589
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:57,800
I haven't seen any scholars.

590
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,110

592
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,440
- Sir. - Get out!

593

Calm down, sir.

595
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,680

596
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,350

598
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,960
and causing you any inconvenience.

599
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,840

in East Capital.

601
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:12,870
There is a serial killer at large.

602
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:13,990
I know nothing about this.

603
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,230
Sir.

604
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,230
My husband is invited

605
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,480
by the Zuojun Director of Kaifeng Court

606
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,800
to help investigate the case.

607
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,320
If you know something

608
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,390
and tell us,

609
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,110
I promise the Court

610
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:28,350
will protect you.

611
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,390
Come in.

612
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:41,680

613
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,110
Did Song

614
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,600
come here often?

615
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,200
Yes.

616
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,270
Song used

617
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,960
to visit Ding from time to time.

618
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:54,110
Ding is an honest

619
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,270
and quiet man.

620
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,200
But

621
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:57,270
he is unlucky.

622
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:59,080
He hurt his leg

623
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,150
when he was working here.

624
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:01,630
Fortunately,

625
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,750
he is good at driving mules.

626
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,560
Despite his injury,

627
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,870
he worked very hard.

628
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,440
So he can earn some money

629
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,480
each month.

630
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:13,270
Song

631
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:15,630
visited him regularly,

632
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,480
offering him some allowance.

633
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:18,840
Ding was doing quite well,

634
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,150
indeed.

635
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:23,720
If so,

636
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,510
he didn't have to lie to you.

637
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,960
This is no

638
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:30,300
dirty secret.

639
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:32,800
Sir.

640
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,920
Why were you kicking me out

641
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,870
as soon as you heard his name?

642
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,270
As you know,

643
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,230
all neighbors know that

644
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,960
Song was murdered.

645
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,440
But the suspect

646
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,870
is still at large.

647
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,320
I don't want to get involved.

648
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:48,920
One more thing.

649
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:50,600
Ding never told anyone

650
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,750
that they know each other.

651
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,270
He kept it as a secret.

652
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,990
Why are you so hospitable?

653
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,800
You guys are friends?

654
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,270
No. I meet him

655
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,350
for the first time.

656
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,630
Why did he

657
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,440
hide the truth?

658
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,320
I've heard that Ding

659
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:12,560
was a servant of Song's family.

660
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,720
But he was kicked out

661
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:16,390
because of some wrongdoing.

662
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,840
It's their privacy.

663
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:20,200
I don't want pry into their secret.

664
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,440
But both of them died on the same day.

665
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,480
If Ding

666
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,150
did not went to the Brothel,

667
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,350
he would

668
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,080
have survived.

669
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,680
He was gone all of a sudden.

670
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,510

Sir.

672
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:42,870
When did Ding come to East Capital?

673
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:45,630
When did Song start to visit him?

674
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,600
He came here at beginning of the year.

675
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,270
Ding was single.

676
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,230
Song visited him

677
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,920
after he hurt his leg.

678
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,440
But Song always came here at night.

679
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:01,870
Anyway,

680
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:03,960
Ding knew Song as a child.

681
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,230
It's apparent

682
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,750
that they have a

683
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:08,200

Supervisor Zhang died of a throat cut.

697
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,920
Blood from the throat

698
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,350
would cause suffocation.

699
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,560
So those words in blood

700
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:19,960
were no way written by him.

701
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:23,350
