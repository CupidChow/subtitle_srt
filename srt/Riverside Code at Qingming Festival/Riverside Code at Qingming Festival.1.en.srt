Come on!

388
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,800
Why is the head so heavy today?

389
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,990
Push harder.

390
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,750
So heavy on my side.

391
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:50,840
Leave.

392
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,440

393
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,230
Move.

What's going on?

Look!

399
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,230
Why does the turtle become two-headed?

400
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,750
Why?

401
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,110
The opera doesn't go as usual.

402
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,720
Yeah. I've never seen the two-headed demon before.

403
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,840
Why does the demon have two heads?

404
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,560
Yeah.

405
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,600
Have you seen the demon before?

406
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,120
Why does the turtle

become two-headed?

408
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,560

Gan Liang was tipped off that

426
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,470

Do you know Gan Liang?

531
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,800
Of course.

532
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,310
Gan…

533
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:58,760
Everyone knows him.

534
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,070
Someone saw you and Gan

535
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:05,190
coming into the warehouse of the troupe.

536
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,800
Mrs. Zhao.

537
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,520
Have you seen Gan

538
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,920
after coming into the warehouse?

539
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,470
I went to the toilet.

540
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,760
When I was passing by the warehouse,

541
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,640
I saw the door was open.

542
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,710
My husband

543
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:25,280
used to show off secrets about magic to me.

544
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,680
I was wondering

545
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:31,040
what the secret is behind the opera today.

546
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:32,950
So I went inside

547
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:35,680
and I want to surprise him.

548
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,470
A stubborn woman.

549
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,760
Why did you go there?

550
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,880
She was gone

551
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,040
for a long time.

552
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,440
I needed to find her.

553
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:47,990
In the warehouse,

554
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:49,280
my wife

555
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,310
discovered so many tricks and secrets…

556
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,280
Enough about your nonsense!

557
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,880
Gan Liang was missing

558
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,160
after you guys came into the house.

559
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,560
What have you done to him?

560
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,760
I've never seen Inspector Gan.

561
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,640
Me too.

562
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,880
Backstage is much more interesting

563
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:23,470
than forestage, right?

564
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:28,070
The opera became tasteless

565
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:29,990
the minute you know the secrets.

566
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,590
Are you two-headed demon?

567
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:32,990
No.

568
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,990
Don't you ask me

569
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:39,040
what two-headed demon is?

570
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,190
I saw it.

571
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,710
Everyone saw it.

572
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,590
I've interviewed the troupe members.

573
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,160
The two-headed demon was not supposed to

574
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,280
appear in the opera today.

575
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:55,160
The demon

576
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,680
was played by someone else.

577
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:01,590
Is it possible that Inspector Gan

578
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:06,560
was missing because of the demon?

579
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:12,830
Maybe.

580
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,710
Maybe Inspector Gan

581
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:17,070
played the demon by himself.

582
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,110
Enough. Buyou.

583
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:20,800
Have you seen him actually?

584
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:23,160
What demon anyway?

585
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:26,110
We came here to watch the opera.

586
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,560
We know nothing else.

587
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,110
Apology. Young lady.

588
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:40,590
Why is your sleeve wet?

589
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,310
When we went through the crowds,

590
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:49,560
we knocked over a bucket of fruits.

591
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,920
I got some honey on my sleeve.

592
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:56,040
It's not sticky at all.

593
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,710
I washed it off.

594
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,830
So be it.

595
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,560
Tonight,

596
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,310
there would be a hard time for each one.

597
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,190
Silence!

598
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,590
A few hours ago,

599
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:22,310
there was a serious case going on here.

600
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:25,800
Gan Liang, Zuojun Inspector of Kaifeng Court,

601
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,680
was gone.

602
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,190
Gone?

603
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,760
There is a two-headed demon,

604
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:37,440
which is related to Gan's missing.

605
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:38,990
This is horrible.

606
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,190
Those who provide useful tips

607
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,230
would be rewarded.

608
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:43,640
Inspector Gan is missing.

609
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,520
That's awesome…

610
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:47,070
Bad news.

611
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,070
Bad news.

612
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,400
Each vendor is scared of

613
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,230
Inspector Gan.

614
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,070
Yeah.

615
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,920
Wives and daughters

616
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,280
try so hard to avoid him.

617
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:56,950
Be careful with your words.

618
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:58,590
What's happened to him?

619
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:59,760
This is karma.

620
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,800
We have a missing case.

621
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,470
You have a reward, right?

622
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,110
I saw something.

623
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,440
Are you sure?

624
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,400
He dodged the attack.

625
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,230
Is he blind or not?

626
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:19,040
He must be pretending.

627
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,400
Boss.

628
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,400
You saw something?

629
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,990
The two-headed demon wore a mask.

630
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:35,590
I don't know the person behind the mask.

631
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,310
However,

632
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:41,110
there was a woman following the demon.

633
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,230
Tie Chi.

634
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:46,040
Move.

635
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,800
Is her?

636
00:33:58,830 --> 00:33:59,520
Yes.

637
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,800
What did you see?

638
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,030
Boss.

639
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:23,830
We have something here.

640
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,640
One body, two heads.

641
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,200
The blind man told me

642
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:50,720
he saw your wife

643
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,720
was following the demon

644
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:55,550
to the water stage.

645
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:56,790
Mrs. Zhao.

646
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,070
Who played

647
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,200
the demon?

648
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:07,310
Talk.

649
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:09,160
Director Gu.

650
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,160
It's me.

651
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,350
It's me.

652
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,550
Didn't you say that

653
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:19,480
you are not two-headed demon?

654
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:23,720
This is 15th anniversary for us.

655
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:25,200
I stole the outfit

656
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,510
from the warehouse

657
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:29,160
to amuse my wife.

658
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:33,550
Is it possible that

659
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:36,200
Gan Liang

660
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,160
was stalking your wife.

661
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,350
He was going to

662
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,350
touch her.

663
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:43,960
Then you hurried to the warehouse

664
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:45,480
and killed him.

665
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,550
Of course not.

666
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:48,110
Then you hided his body

667
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:50,000
in this outfit

668
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:52,030
and dumped the body here.

669
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:52,830
Director Gu.

670
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:53,590
This is a mistake.

671
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:54,700
We didn't see Gan Liang.

672
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,400
Tie Chi.

673
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:55,960
Sir.

674
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:57,270
Search!

675
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,270
Yes, sir.

676
00:35:58,270 --> 00:35:59,200
Especially the bottom of the river.

677
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:01,510
Everyone, search!

678
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,550
Search the river.

679
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:06,480
It's a life at stake.

680
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:25,960
Wan Fu.

681
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,510
Yeah.

682
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:29,640
- Judge Wan. Don't do that. - You two.

683
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:31,590
Take off the cover.

684
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:32,350
Yes.

685
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,310
What is it?

686
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,680
Fireworks.

687
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:45,680
It's fireworks.

688
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,920
Why are you so nervous?

689
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,790
I intended to

690
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:50,750
give my wife a surprise.

691
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:51,750
Buyou.

692
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,070
Stop trying.

693
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,480
Inspector Gan is missing.

694
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,030
But Kaifeng Court

695
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:58,160
has not caught the suspect yet.

696
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:01,030
Finally, they would use us as scapegoats.

697
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,880
Ordinary people like us

698
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:06,550
are expendables to them.

699
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,550
They don't care.

700
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,480
Watch your language.

701
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:12,240
You're slandering the Kaifeng Court.

702
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,960
Inspector Gan is one of yours.

703
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:17,680
He is a bully,

704
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:20,720
making excuses to rob us,

705
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,750
smashing our shops,

706
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:25,640
and hitting us at whim.

707
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,790
Yeah.

708
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:27,420
Yeah.

709
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,520
Officers from Kaifeng Court are bullies.

710
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:34,510
I'm not lying, right?

711
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:36,310
Darling. That's enough.

712
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:38,310
Those people are known for collaboration in evildoing.

713
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:39,590
What were you saying?

714
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:41,240
They are hitting people again.

715
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,270
As I said,

716
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:44,830
take us as scapegoats.

717
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,110
Shame on them!

718
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,640
Blaming the couple for the wrongdoing of Gan Liang.

719
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,790
Yeah.

720
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,880
Gan Liang even broke the leg of my brother.

721
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,790
Kaifeng Court did nothing about it.

722
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:54,400
These court men are covering for each other.

723
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,350
They're looking for scapegoat.

724
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,680
When does the interrogation end?

725
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,110
The couple is doomed one way or another.

726
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,440
Yeah.

727
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,110
- Yeah. - They're covering for each other.

728
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:06,590
Boss.

729
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,680
Search is done.

730
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,640
Nothing.

731
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:10,270
Release them.

732
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,170
- Let them go. - Let them go.

733
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,550
The girl is innocent.

734
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:14,920
Let's go.

735
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,270
Boss.

736
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:17,070
Are we done?

737
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,070
Let's go.

738
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:24,830
I'm going to return the outfit now.

739
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,960
15th anniversary.

740
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:34,960
Sorry.

741
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:38,400
Move!

742
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:39,750
Move!

743
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:42,300
- Move! - Let's go.

744
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,600
Back to work.

745
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,580
Go home. Young lady.

746
00:38:52,100 --> 00:39:02,380
[Kaifeng Court]

747
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,160
Tie Chi.

748
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,270
- Sir. - Dismiss our men.

749
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:04,720
Copy that.

750
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,510
There must be something wrong with the couple.

751
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,310
Why did you let them go?

752
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,510
They channeled

753
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,310
the emotion of a crowd easily.

754
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,720
Why?

755
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,310
Because Gan Liang

756
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:22,640
has a notorious reputation.

757
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,270
I'm sure that

758
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,960
he is dead.

759
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:29,720
If we cannot find him,

760
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,480
the he is considered missing.

761
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:33,110
If he is missing,

762
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,720
we would keep looking

763
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,200
for him.

764
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:16,960
Drop.

765
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,640
Ok.

766
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:04,790
Blade went through his lung,

767
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:07,680
then slant and upward,

768
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,920
into his heart.

769
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,480
Blood in the chest would not

770
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,480
burst from the cut.

771
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:14,960
