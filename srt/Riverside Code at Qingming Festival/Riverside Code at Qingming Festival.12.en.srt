Have you forgotten the promise you made to her?

Put the knife down,

174

Calm down.

184
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:59,390
What you're doing might be justified,

185
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,800
but it's not your place to do it.

186
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:02,830
Let's think of another way,

187
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:03,440

188
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,200
What other way is there?

189
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,830
When I'm against people like her,

190
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,320
what other choice do I have?

191
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,920

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,440
secretly urged him to do it.

384
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,760
They used a letter made of cut-out characters

385
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:58,980
[Kill Zhang Qiniang within five days]

386
00:22:59,020 --> 00:22:59,460
[Kill your entire family]

387
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,620
[Kill Zhang Qiniang within five days]

388
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:02,630
to inform him

389
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:03,480
that Kang Qian

390
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,310
staged the Hat Demon incident

391
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,560
and to instruct him

392
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,230
to take revenge on Kang

393
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,920
in kind.

394
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,210
So, someone was giving him orders, too.

395
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:17,800
Who do you think

396
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:20,440
this orderer is?

397
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,480
Whoever they were,

398
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,680
they didn't outsmart you, did they?

399
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,920
You flatter me.

400
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:46,750
Judge Wan.

401
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,200
Give me your hand.

402
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,750
You helped us solve the Hat Demon case.

403
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:54,630
This

404
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,800
is a reward Inspector Gu requested for you.

405
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:00,920
If there's

406
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,840
any case that needs my help in the future,

407
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,150
just let me know.

408
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,510
From now on,

409
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,150
if you and your wife work together

410
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,990
to assist us,

411
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,960
you'll be able to afford a new house in no time.

412
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,990
Inspector Gu,

413
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,270
I can give you all the help you need.

414
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,350
Why do you need my wife as well?

415
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,680
Do you think you're worth that much on your own?

416
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:31,600
So you need us both?

417
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,920
Then I can't accept this.

418
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,150
I can't

419
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,350
speak for her.

420
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:41,800
Work with me.

421
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,680
You won't regret it.

422
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,600
Why should we agree to that?

423
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,630
I heard you were looking to buy a house

424
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:51,390
and were still short a fair amount of money.

425
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,750
There are plenty of ways to earn money.

426
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:55,990
Kaifeng Court isn't the only option.

427
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,870
Isn't it better to make

428
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,440
honest money by working

429
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,560
with the government?

430
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,480
Or

431
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:05,870
would you rather take

432
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,600
that 100 liang of gold from that orderer?

433
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:08,780
[Reward: 100 liang of gold]

434
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,320
Someone hired me to kill you.

435
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:12,320
Here's the reward money.

436
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,270
The orderer?

437
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,480
I, Wen Yue, never take money to be coerced into anything.

438
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,080
Then work with me.

439
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,720
Inspector Gu,

440
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:31,200
why are you so eager to have the two of us work with you?

441
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:37,680
I admit I have my own reasons,

442
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:40,230
but I, Gu Zhen,

443
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:42,800
would never harm you or your husband.

444
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,390
Add another fifty percent.

445
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,920
I'll have someone send it over shortly.

446
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,750
No need.

447
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,960
Just give it directly to Zhao Buyou.

448
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,510
It'll make him happy.

449
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,350
You already talked to her,

450
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,080
and she agreed.

451
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,150
Why bother telling me now?

452
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,630
She's already signed off on it.

453
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:12,230
You're just giving me the reward now

454
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,630
to keep me happy for a while, huh?

455
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,080
One more thing.

456
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,750
Xiao Yishui has been sentenced to exile on Shamen Island.

457
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,680
He'll never be able to come back.

458
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:25,080
I told you.

459
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,320
He'll be

460
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:26,990
gone for good.

461
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,990
You can live your life in peace now.

462
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,800
Well, that's good news.

463
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:32,560
Thank you, Inspector Gu.

464
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,840
Come on. Give it to me.

465
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,750
I'll take it.

466
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,320
Wen Yue.

467
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,230
Did you get the reward?

468
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,560
Let me give you a hand.

469
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,030
No need.

470
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,320
There's something

471
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,080
I think

472
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,440
you should know.

473
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:18,510
Xiao Yishui

474
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,230
has been sentenced to exile on Shamen Island.

475
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:21,630
He's leaving tomorrow.

476
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,150
I've looked into it.

477
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,390
It's likely a one-way trip.

478
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,270
Talk to Inspector Gu for me.

479
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:50,270
I'd like to see him off.

480
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,200
All right.

481
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:55,990
I'll go with you.

482
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:00,350
Boss told us

483
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,480
to wait outside.

484
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,200
All right,

485
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:02,990
thank you.

486
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:03,870
Wen Yue,

487
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:04,870
go ahead.

488
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,680
It's the first cell.

489
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,560
Yishui.

490
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,230
Oh, Jiu!

491
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,960
You came after all.

492
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,840
Master drank this same kind of liquor

493
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,120
before getting on the boat

494
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,200
and killing Li Yan.

495
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:44,440
I knew you hadn't moved on.

496
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,150
You're being exiled to Shamen Island.

497
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:48,680
There's no coming back,

498
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,440
so I came to see you off.

499
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,600
After seeing me off,

500
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:55,630
you'll go back to living your simple life, huh?

501
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,720
Sounds nice.

502
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,680
I need to put the past behind me.

503
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,080
Only if it can be left behind.

504
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,390
Once you set foot in the jianghu,
[*martial arts world]

505
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,750
you'll never be able to leave.

506
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:13,200
The liquor's good.

507
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,600
But sadly,

508
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,150
I'm going to let you down.

509
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,510
I'm not going to die anytime soon.

510
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:28,150
Someone secretly sent me word

511
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:30,800
that they'd bribed the officers escorting me

512
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,720
and arranged to meet me halfway.

513
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,320
Who?

514
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:37,920
No idea.

515
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,210
But judging

516
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,230
by the sneaky way they acted,

517
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:43,350
it could be that orderer.

518
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,320
The orderer?

519
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,510
Why do they want to meet you?

520
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,270
Who knows?

521
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,150
Since they've made the arrangements,

522
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:53,750
what's the harm in me riding the wave?

523
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,200
That's why I said

524
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,350
you couldn't cut ties with me.

525
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,510
Just wait for me.

526
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,350
So, when and where

527
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:05,680
are they

528
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,750
meeting you?

529
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:08,560
At the latter half of the Si hour

530
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,990
in the wild pine forest outside Chenzhou Gate.

531
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,630
All right.

532
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,800
Let me tell you,

533
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:23,150
if I want to cut ties,

534
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,870
I will.

535
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,350
Jiu!

536
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,440
And I'll tell you this.

537
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:39,150
You won't!

538
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,800
Wen Yue, what are you doing?

539
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:53,990
Didn't you hear everything in the prison?

540
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,720
The orderer might be showing up.

541
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,350
I'm going to meet them

542
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,560
and let them know

543
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,990
I'm living an ordinary life now

544
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,560
and don't want to be involved in their affairs.

545
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,440
Then why are you bringing a dagger?

546
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:05,800
For self-defense, of course.

547
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,230
Then I'll go with you.

548
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,800
This is a jianghu matter.

549
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,510
Can you just stay out of it?

550
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,990
What "jianghu matter"?

551
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:15,390
I've spent over a decade copying case files at the Office of Justice.

552
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:16,870
Do you think I'm clueless?

553
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:17,920
You and Xiao Yishui

554
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,480
were using codes,

555
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,200
weren't you?

556
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,990
The latter half of the Si hour

557
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:24,510
in the wild pine forest outside Chenzhou Gate.

558
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,720
What codes?

559
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,110
"The latter half of the Si hour"

560
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,840
refers to the previous hour.

561
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,270
And the actual location

562
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:33,990
is in the opposite direction.

563
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,840
In the opposite direction, there's only one road,

564
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,440
and it leads to the Bian River pier,

565
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:42,960
right?

566
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,630
You're not coming.

567
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,230
I'm serious.

568
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:50,960
Here.

569
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,080
Mr. Xiao,

570
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,350
we're just doing our job.

571
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,200
Don't worry.

572
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,110
We won't

573
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:58,630
let you suffer along the way.

574
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,870
How far are we from the stage station?

575
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:08,080
We'll get there in about four hours.

576
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:09,680
Four hours?

577
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,630
Take off these shackles for me.

578
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:15,560
They're digging into me. It hurts so much.

579
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,320
Well...

580
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:21,030
I won't cause any trouble.

581
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,480
I just want to loosen up a bit.

582
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:24,680
You can put them back on

583
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,110
when we set off again.

584
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,750
You're carrying weapons anyway.

585
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:29,750
What could I possibly do?

586
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:30,410
If I act out,

587
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:31,870
just kill me with one stroke.

588
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,390
We wouldn't dare.

589
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:34,800
Come on. Let's do it.

590
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,310
Is your produce fresh?

591
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,240
Of course.

592
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,310
Take your pick.

593
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,750
Waiter,

594
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:04,000
bring me a pot of good tea!

595
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,870
Coming!

596

598
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,600

599
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,840

604
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:32,270
Sesame candy!

605
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,560
Be careful.

606
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,270
Don't worry.

607
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,480
Small trinkets!

608
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:37,560
One wen each!

609
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:39,760
Come take a look!

610
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,790
Small trinkets! Come take a look!

611
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,440
Shad, pomfret,

612
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,750
and fresh crucian carp!

613
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:47,770
Delicious bao!

614
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,660
Come and have a look!

615
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:51,630
Pinwheels!

616
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,590
Small trinkets!

617
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:55,750
Shad, pomfret,

618
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,350
and fresh crucian carp!

619
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,270
Sesame flatbread!

620
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,350
Freshly baked sesame flatbread!

621
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:04,150
Two wen each!

622
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,080
Radishes, eggplants, and Shandong millet!

623
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,480
Come and take a look!

624
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,680
Sesame candy!

625
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,440
Sir, this way, please.

626
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:31,240
This way.

627
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,350
Murder!

628
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:35,280
Someone's been killed!

629
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,460
Report it to the authorities!

630
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,100
Report it!

631
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,760
- Someone's been killed! - Report it!

632
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:44,310
What's going on?

633
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:46,520
I don't know.

634
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:47,760
He just collapsed suddenly.

635
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,830
A murder in broad daylight? How terrifying!

636
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,440
Stop chasing.

637
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:54,280
Zhao Buyou, what are you doing here?

638
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,040
Stop chasing.

639
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,470
That's a ruthless outlaw.

640
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,440
Report it!

641
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,220
Someone's been killed!

642
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,210
Report it to the authorities!

643
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:13,960
Wait up, Wen Yue.

644
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:15,830
You're back, Wen Yue.

645
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,150
Everything's fine.

646
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,350
Wen Yue, I'm sorry.

647
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:22,550
I shouldn't have secretly followed you to the pier.

648
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,830
I told you

649
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:24,920
not to meddle

650
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,850
in jianghu affairs.

651
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:27,360
Why didn't you listen to me?

652
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,680
You're my wife.

653
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,870
As your husband,

654
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:34,830
how could I let you go

655
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:35,830
to such a dangerous place alone?

656
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,390
If you hadn't stopped me earlier,

657
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:38,960
I would've caught the killer by now.

658
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:40,440
You're making it sound

659
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,630
like I caused you trouble.

660
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:42,960
You did cause me trouble.

661
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,350
Zhao Ban,

662
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,590
what are they saying?

663
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,550
It sounds like they're arguing.

664
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,960
Buyou said he caused Wen Yue trouble.

665
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,070
I wonder what happened.

666
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:57,960
Enough.

667
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:00,870
What are you kids meddling

668
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:02,680
in their business for?

669
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:04,070
Buyou...

670
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,390
I'm brewing medicine for him right now.

671
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,310
Zhao Buyou,

672
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,680
after I married you

673
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,200
and became part of this family,

674
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,440
I thought I could leave my past behind.

675
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,240
But to my surprise,

676
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:24,480
it came back to haunt me again.

677
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,480
It's just jianghu affairs.

678
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,150
We can handle them together.

679
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:33,040
It's not that simple.

680
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,250
Matters of the jianghu

681
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,590
can only be resolved within the jianghu.

682
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:38,760
Since they sent the orders to the umbrella shop,

683
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:40,790
I'll wait for them there.

684
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,110
If they won't leave me alone,

685
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,480
I won't let them off either.

686
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,790
If you move to the shop,

687
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:49,590
what about the rest of us?

688
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:51,720
Only by leaving here

689
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,920
can I keep this family safe.

690
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,240
- Wen Yue... - Father, Mo, Ban

691
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,070
are still living here.

692
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,680
I can't drag them into this.

693
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,070
I can protect them.

694
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,920
I'm a strong man.

695
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:03,590
I'll face this with you.

696
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:07,000
You're just an ordinary man.

697
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,200
You've given me over a decade of peace,

698
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:10,720
and for that, I'm grateful.

699
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:12,590
Wen Yue,

700
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,350
don't underestimate me.

701
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:18,390
You've never dealt with those people before.

702
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,280
It's not that I underestimate you.

703
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,680
It's just that you have no idea how dangerous they are.

704
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,240
How dangerous can they be?

705
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,070
Weren't the Hat Demon case

706
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:26,720
and the Mei's Boat case dangerous?

707
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,280
They still got solved.

708
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:28,870
I

709
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:29,630
solved them.

710
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:31,870
This isn't the same as solving cases.

711
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,920
Your petty tricks

712
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,110
are useless here.

713
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:38,040
What did you say?

714
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,760
You think I only have "petty tricks"?

715
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:42,590
That's right.

716
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,870
A petty man with petty tricks

717
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,000
can never handle something this big.

718
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,110
- Wen Yue, are you... - Wen Yue.

719
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:52,000
Heading out?

720
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,350
Wen Yue!

721
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,680
Buyou!

722
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,960
Buyou, quick, go stop her!

723
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:00,590
You just had to meddle!

724
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,520
You don't even know what's going on.

725
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,110
You never step up when you should,

726
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:08,240
and now you're stirring up trouble at the wrong time!

727
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,920
This family is falling apart!

728
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:37,760
Congratulations on your grand opening!

729
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,070
Thanks.

You're truly something else.

731
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:44,000
What do you mean?

732
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,680
You started as an apprentice at the umbrella shop,

733
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,200
and in just two years, you've got your own stall.

734
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,870
You said

735
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,070
that no one in the East Capital would go hungry as long as they worked hard.

736
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:56,310
