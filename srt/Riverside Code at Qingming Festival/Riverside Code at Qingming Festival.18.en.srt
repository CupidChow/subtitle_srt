90
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,320

91

Each body had one.

92

Investigation shows

93
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:36,600
that those fish charms

00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,040
are the passes to the Yayuan Mansion.

95
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,040
I suspect

96
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,950
that someone is trying to frame

97
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,200

98
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,510
Therefore,

99
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,950
I came to inquire about this

100
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,200
with Mr. Luan.

101
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:53,550
I wonder

102
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,950
if Mr. Luan has any enemies.

103
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:59,510

104
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,920

116
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,160
There's nothing

117
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,480

118
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,390
How can you tell that's from my Yayuan Mansion?

119

120
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:59,160
you haven't even figured out how many fish charms there are

121

122
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,110

126

I have no personal enmity with anyone.

127
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,200

00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,550
Mr. Zhao, be careful.

196
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,080
- Father. - Be careful.

197
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:03,590
- Be careful. - Be careful.

198
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,320
Everyone is gone.

199
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:08,910
Buyou.

200
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:09,960
Wen.

201
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,590
Good to see you.

202
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,460
Our whole family is here.

203
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:14,960
Where is Zhao Mo?

204
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:15,760
Ban.

205
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,230
Take your father home.

206
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,400
I'm not going back.

207
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,320
I'm not done drinking.

208
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,280
Wen Yue.

209
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,230
This case

210
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,150
seems to involve a lot of women.

211
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,170
I want to stay

212
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,230
and investigate with you.

213
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:27,200
Don't talk nonsense.

214
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,110
Inspector Gu still hasn't come back

215
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,520
from the Yayuan Mansion, you know?

216
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,880
Do you know how complicated it is?

217
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,710
How complicated can it be?

218
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,280
Yayuan Mansion.

219
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,320
Isn't that

220
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,790
Luan Hui's place?

221
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,320
What's so great about him?

222
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,670
He's just

223
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,080
the son-in-law of Mr. Zou.

224
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,840
In fact,

225
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,200
the Mei's Boat case

226
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,910
was someone's attempt

227
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,280
to prevent the Zou family from presenting

228
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:55,960
the auspicious sign.

229
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,030
And the Hat Demon case

230
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,520
was meant to harm the real estate business

231
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,960
of the Zou family in East Capital.

232
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,230
And the imperial exam case

233
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,910
was meant to expose the Zou family

234
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:11,230
and stop them from cheating.

235
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,960
Aren't these cases you're working on

236
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,150
all related to the Zou family?

237
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,440
Father.

238
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,470
How come you know everything?

239
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,230
There are too many plays

240
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,000
in this Fan Building.

241
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,030
Some are true.

242
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,880
Some are false.

243
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,550
What stories are true?

244
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,790
What stories are false?

245
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,000
Father.

246
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:37,590
That's enough.

247
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,000
The Kaifeng Court

248
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,350
will surely look into these cases.

249
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:42,880
Zhao Ban.

250
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,760
Take Father home.

251
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,470
Hurry up.

252
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,220
I want to stay and investigate.

253
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,020
Ban.

254
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,230
Go home.

255
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,520
I'll find you

256
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,470
if we need your help.

257
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,290
Manager.

258
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,720
Your wine is watered down.

259
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,470
All right.

260
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,000
Wen Yue, I'll do as you say.

261
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,400
I'll be waiting.

262
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,150
Take him back.

263
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,790
Father.

264
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,520
Stop drinking.

265
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,280
That's enough.

266
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,320
Let's go home.

267
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,220
Put my cup away.

268
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,000
Let me help you.

269
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,880
- But... - Let's go.

270
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,640
- Buyou. - Let's go.

271
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:07,550
We're off.

272
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,050
Father, go home and rest.

273
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,280
- We rarely... - Go home.

274
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,850
- gather here. - Let's go.

275
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,890
Yao He.

276
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,030
Father.

277
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,470
Please get someone

278
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,400
to send the bodies back.

279
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,440
Okay.

280
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,000
Let's go.

281
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:20,710
Okay.

282
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:43,710
When did you put up the red silk?

283
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,520
Red silk is precious.

284
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,150
It's only put up a few days before the festival.

285
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,280
After the performance,

286
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,110
I would pull the rope down there

287
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,550
and the red silk would fall.

288
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,840
Who could have thought

289
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,670
that there were bodies in there?

290
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,470
Manager.

291
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,550
Who else has touched the red silk

292
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,710
apart from him?

293
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,280
Apart from Xiaoliu,

294
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:16,470
there is another handyman.

295
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,110
But he's new here.

296
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:22,230
So we only put him to serve tea

297
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,230
and do odd jobs.

298
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,400
The sewage in the kitchen leads to the Underground Culvert.

299
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,150
The cover

300
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,880
seems to have been moved recently.

301
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:34,790
Manager.

302
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,230
Can you get the handyman

303
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,200
you just mentioned?

304
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,000
I'll get him.

305
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,000
Officer.

306
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,030
Did you see anyone suspicious

307
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,440
when the incident occurred today?

308
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,400
Not really.

309
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,550
Where were you at the time?

310
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,280
We were busy today

311
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,080
and I was sent to help in the kitchen.

312
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,760
That's true.

313
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:10,700
What's with your hand?

314
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,130
It's nothing.

315
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,490
I got bitten by a mad dog.

316
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,910
Where were you last night?

317
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,760
I was on duty at the restaurant.

318
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,110
I was right here.

319
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,350
Did you see anything unusual?

320
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:35,760
No.

321
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:36,960
All right.

322
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,110
Thank you for your time.

323
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:40,880
You may leave.

324
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:47,470
Have you

325
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:48,520
found any clues?

326
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,960
We'll see tonight.

327
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,150
All right.

328
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,140
Have some wonton.

329
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:04,080
Fresh out of the pot.

330
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,400
I'm stuffed.

331
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,760
We can go.

332
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:09,910
Already?

333
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:11,580
Have some wonton.

334
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,760
What else do you want?

335
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,020
[Office of Justice]

336
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,880
You want to see Zhao Mo?

337
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,400
Then just say it.

338
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,030
I ended up having so many wontons

339
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,910
outside the Office of Justice.

340
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,150
Father.

341
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,350
Let's check on my brother.

342
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,710
Why would I?

343
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,790
He doesn't see me as his father.

344
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,670
And I should beg him to be my son?

345
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:37,910
He was like,

346
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:39,740
"Am I your biological son?"

347
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,910
Of course, he is.

348
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,880
Who else can be his father?

349
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,800
Father, that's not what Mo meant.

350
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,540
What did he mean?

351
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,600
He didn't say you weren't his father.

352
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,560
Go ahead

353
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,550
if you want to see him.

354
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,200
I'm stuffed. See you at home.

355
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,440
I'm off.

356
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,320
Father.

357
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,280
Father, don't get lost.

358
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:03,110
Rest assured.

359
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,690
Have some wonton.

360
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:24,020
[Office of Justice]

361
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:27,920
Mo, you're heading out?

362
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,180
Have some wonton.

363
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,010
Fresh out of the pot.

364
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:43,050
Wonton.

365
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,070
Why did you come?

366
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,280
I won't go home.

367
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,830
Don't flatter yourself.

368
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,780
I'm not asking you to come home.

369
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,830
What's wrong?

370
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,230
Nothing.

371
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,680
I know

372
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,280
you're still mad about what happened in the morning.

373
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:18,200
It's easy to repay someone who gave birth to me

374
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,570
but didn't raise me,

375
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,560
while it's hard to repay someone

376
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,440
who did the opposite.

377
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,030
I totally understand.

378
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,110
Even if we're not bound by blood,

379
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,390
it doesn't change the fact

380
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,560
that Father and Buyou are my family.

381
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:36,630
But I have to figure out

382
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:37,960
who I really am.

383
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,680
This is the meaning

384
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,990
of my life.

385
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:44,800
I must figure out what's going on

386
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,030
to learn to face it.

387
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,350
But

388
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,510
you're not guaranteed

389
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:51,750
to find a closure

390
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,110
even if you face it.

391
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,270
Wouldn't you want to know

392
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,800
who you are?

393
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,560
I just want to be with my family.

394
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:17,680
Are you coming home tonight?

395
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,750
I fought with Buyou so badly this morning.

396
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,840
So maybe not.

397
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,560
In that case,

398
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,750
forget about the wonton.

399
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,600
You can leave.

400
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,800
Pay the bill.

401
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,920
Four bowls in total.

402
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,680
Come on, the wonton is ready.

403
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,200
Look.

404
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,840
The Office of Justice is right there.

405
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,960
[Office of Justice]
Let's report to the authorities.

406
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:26,560
Su.

407
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,750
Your mother might be back soon.

408
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,230
Let's wait a bit more, okay?

409
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,960
But I miss my mother.

410
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,270
Let's report it now.

411
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,110
Mr. He?

412
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:36,720
Ban.

413
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,080
Aren't you

414
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,990
the little fighter?

415
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,080
What happened?

416
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:46,720
Su's mother left the city to purchase goods

417
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,030
and entrusted her to us.

418
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,350
She must have been delayed.

419
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,630
But it's been five days.

420
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,780
My mother said

421
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,750
that she'd be back in three days.

422
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,510
So your name is Su.

423
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,870
I saw how brave you were at the Welfare Center.

424
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,230
I was just like that when I was a kid.

425
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,350
I never cry.

426
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,150
But I miss my mother a bit.

427
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,630
My mother is missing.

428
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,870
Auntie Song is also missing.

429
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,200
And Auntie Lu rarely comes back.

430
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,150
Don't they want me anymore?

431
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,030
Am I going to be homeless?

432
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:23,630
No way.

433
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:24,800
You won't be homeless.

434
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,030
No way.

435
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,230
Is there anyone else in your family?

436
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,840
No.

437
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,480
Su lives in the embroidery workshop

438
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,390
with her mother Ci

439
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:36,230
and her two aunts.

440
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,230
Su calls them Aunties.

441
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,440
She has no one else.

442
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,080
Look.

443
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,680
You are so well dressed

444
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,350
and your hair is so neatly combed.

445
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:50,510
Your mother and aunties must love you very much.

446
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,800
I wasn't so lucky as a kid.

447
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,440
I had to wear my second brother's old clothes.

448
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,350
The two hair buns

449
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,480
my eldest brother tied

450
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,320
were always uneven.

451
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,390
The kids in the alley used to laugh at me

452
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,920
about my "crooked corners".

453
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:05,600
Let's go.

454
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,440
Let me walk you home, okay?

455
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,000
Okay.

456
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,560
Maybe your mother is waiting for you.

457
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,390
Really?

458
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,080
- Let's go. Let's hold hands. - Let's go.

459
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,560
Want to hold hands?

460
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:15,350
Let's go.

461
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:16,800
Let's go.

462
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,630
Here.

463
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,210
Su.

464
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,510
- Excuse me. - My father

465
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:26,270
got lost once before.

466
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:27,560
I cried every day

467
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,150
while searching for him.

468
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,750
But then one day,

469
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,680
somehow...

470
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,800
- Excuse me. - He came back on his own.

471
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:35,480
Sister.

472
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,720
This is our embroidery workshop.

473
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,110
Jinxiu Embroidery.

474
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,030
It closes so early?

475
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,840
Ever since my mother left,

476
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,600
we've been closing early.

477
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,750
Su.

478
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,230
Now that you are home,

479
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,270
I have to go.

480
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:55,920
- Come on. - Okay.

481
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,720
- Excuse me. - Don't worry.

482
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,990
- Your mother will surely come back. - Groceries.

483
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:00,080
Pendants. Take a look.

484
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,160
I have work to do.

485
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,230
Okay.

486
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,630
Thank you, He Huan.

487
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:05,800
Ban.

488
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,720
Let me show you my house.

489
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,480
Okay.

490
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,110
Let's go.

491
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,230
From there.

492
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:10,870
Back door.

493
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:12,230
- You have a back door? - Miss.

494
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,210
Come and take a look.

495
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,270
Our home is right inside.

496
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:17,750
Here. Yeah.

497
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:18,560
Right here.

498
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:25,200
I live here with my mother.

499
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,390
Auntie Song and Auntie Lu live there.

500
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,150
So you have three embroiderers.

501
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,990
Auntie Lu stayed to look after the workshop and didn't teach embroidery

502
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:39,150
at the welfare house last time.

503
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:39,870
I see.

504
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:42,150
My mother and I live in that room.

505
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:43,350
Let me show you.

506
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:44,030
Is that fine?

507
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:44,960
Of course.

508
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:45,800
Let's go.

509
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:46,480
Let's go.

510
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,750
Come on in.

511
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:55,480
This is the room for you and your mother?

512
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,480
That's right.

513
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,870
Look. She embroidered this.

514
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,110
It's pretty, right?

515
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,680
Your mother made all these?

516
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,480
That's right.

517
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,750
So pretty.

518
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,720
Excellent embroidery work.

519
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,110
This one

520
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:12,600
seems a bit worse

521
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,200
than the other embroidery.

522
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,920
I bet this is not your mother's work.

523
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,560
Ci Rou?

524
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:22,870
No.

525
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,990
My mother said she found it on the street.

526
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:27,750
- She did? - Who are you?

527
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,480
Why are you in our house?

528
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:32,440
[Lu Sanzhen, Embroiderer]
I-I'm here...

529
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,580
Auntie Lu.

530
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,720
This is Sister Zhao Ban.

531
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:40,720
I asked her to help me find my mother.

532
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:43,200
Nonsense.

533
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:44,600
Su.

534
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,920
Didn't I tell you that your mother

535
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:47,960
went to buy goods?

536
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,150
Just a second, please.

537
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:53,270
I have something to do.

538
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,440
No rush.

539
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,440
Take your time, Lady Lu.

540
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,800
I'll check out the house first.

541
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:00,630
But...

542
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,870
But my mother has been gone for days.

543
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:04,870
I miss her.

544
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:08,080
But you can't just

545
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,350
take a stranger home.

546
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:11,080
Okay.

547
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,920
Sister, let me walk you out.

548
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,720
Sister.

549
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,990
Sorry.

550
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,560
Don't be mad at Auntie Lu.

551
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,800
It's okay.

552
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:30,630
Is she close to your mother?

553
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:31,390
Yes.

554
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:34,080
They've always been close.

555
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,630
Why isn't your Auntie Song here?

556
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:42,270
My mother said that Auntie Song went back to her hometown.

557
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:44,560
Su.

558
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,920
Do you know where your mother went to purchase goods?

559
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,480
A few days ago, Auntie Lu said she went to Xiangfu.

560
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,230
Xiangfu? That's not far.

561
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,110
Listen.

562
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,840
I'll ask my friend to look for your mother there.

563
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,480
I'll keep you updated, okay?

564
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,270
Okay.

565
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,680
Go back. I'm going home too.

566
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:04,150
Sister.

567
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:05,510
Where do you live?

568
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:06,320
Me?

569
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,720
I live in Sparrow Lane.

570
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,320
Over there.

571
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,150
There is a persimmon tree

572
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:11,480
in our yard.

573
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,480
That's my home.

574
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,720
Go back.

575
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,560
See you.

576
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,200
See you.

577
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:34,840
I'll leave you to handle

578
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,110
the embroidery workshop.

579
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,230
Rest assured. Leave it to me.

580
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:40,270
Please stay.

581
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:54,110
Excuse me.

582
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:58,230
Now I remember.

583
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,110
Your family wanted to buy a house.

584
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,110
No wonder you looked familiar.

585
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:03,600
Well...

586
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:04,750
Excuse me.

587
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,690
Is this embroidery workshop for sale?

588
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,090
Not just that.

589
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:10,870
The backyard is also for sale.

590
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,150
You want to move here?

591
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:14,030
No.

592
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,270
Thank you.

593
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,870
You're leaving

594
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,320
so late?

595
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,440
Have you heard of the murder

596
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,390
in this building?

597
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:10,800
Officer.

598
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,990
I've said it earlier.

599
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:12,560
Yeah.

600
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,390
Let me ask you something.

601
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,440
What does it take for someone

602
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,440
to sneak three corpses

603
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,680
into the Fan Building?

604
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,030
No idea.

605
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:25,840
An Underground Culvert.

606
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,200
Is that so?

607
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:29,600
Do you have one here?

608
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,630
I have no idea.

609
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:34,750
The sewage in the kitchen leads to the Underground Culvert.

610
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,840
There we go.

611
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,390
Do they need an insider?

612
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:42,990
Of course.

613
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:47,080
This guy has that stench

614
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,510
of weird fragrance

615
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,870
of the bodies we found in the morning.

616
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:51,680
I don't smell.

617
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,630
Officer.

618
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,720
Even if I do, that's because I'm a waiter

619
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,600
who runs around.

620
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,630
I must have gotten that smell somewhere.

621
00:28:58,870 --> 00:28:59,600
Yeah.

622
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,230
That's it.

623
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:00,870
That's it.

624
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,510
I've given you a chance.

625
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,990
Don't waste it.

626
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:19,750
A chance?

627
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:20,920
"Don't waste it"?

628
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,800
I'm telling the truth here.

629
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:24,920
Okay.

630
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:28,320
Feng from the Fan Building

631
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,750
killed three men,

632
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,750
sneaked the corpses into the Fan Building

633
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,230
on his own

634
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,630
and dumped them on the stage

635
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:35,750
during the spring banquet

636
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:36,960
to get back at the manager.

637
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:37,560
Case closed.

638
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,960
- You... - Congratulations

639
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,320
on solving the case, Judge Wan.

640
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,720
I'm wronged, officer.

641
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,230
I'm wronged.

642
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:44,080
I didn't do that.

643
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:46,030
I only helped transport the corpses.

644
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,510
He said he transported the bodies.

645
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,110
No, no.

646
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:54,560
I didn't know

647
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,390
those were corpses when I transported them.

648
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,350
Nor did I kill anyone or dump their bodies.

649
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,320
Officer.

650
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,990
I swear.

651
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:02,870
Feng.

652
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,150
You'd better confess.

653
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:07,350
I'll close the case right away

654
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:09,030
if you tell a single lie.

655
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:11,750
Understood.

656
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:12,750
I confess.

657
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,750
I confess.

658
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:16,680
I...

659
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:17,870
I...

660
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,480
I'm addicted to gambling.

661
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,480
I was buried

662
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,840
in gambling debt some days ago.

663
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:26,440
Then

664
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,510
my creditors did this to me.

665
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,920
One day, I met a person in the Underground Culvert.

666
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:47,350
That person gave me some medicine

667
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,480
and a bag of money

668
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,110
and told me to apply for a job here

669
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,230
to help smuggle

670
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,840
prohibited items

671
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,080
into the Fan Building

672
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,200
before the spring banquet.

673
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,200
I didn't know

674
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,560
they were transporting corpses.

675
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,720
They simply promised

676
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,800
to pay me

677
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,200
the other half of the commission.

678
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,480
Then I could repay my gambling debt.

679
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,960
I had no choice

680
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:09,480
but...

681
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:12,230
but accept the offer.

682
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,870
What does that person

683
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,390
look like?

684
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,270
I don't know.

685
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:21,840
Close the case.

686
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,800
I know.

687
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:25,870
I know.

688
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,080
It was dark in the Underground Culvert.

689
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,680
That person was wearing black

690
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,630
with a dark veil.

691
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,860
I couldn't see that person's face.

692
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,270
But, although that person

693
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:40,110
spoke in a lowered voice on purpose,

694
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:41,400
I could tell that

695
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,600
it was a woman.

696
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:43,990
I thought

697
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,230
she was a frail woman and tried

698
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,320
to stalk her.

699
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,270
But she found out

700
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,230
and kicked me

701
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,920
to the ground effortlessly.

702
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,870
No more tricks.

703
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,230
Or I'll kill you.

704
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:03,200
If you tell anyone about me,

705
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,750
I'll kill you too.

706
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,390
Understood.

707
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,630
Thank you.

708
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,080
No problem.

709
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:20,030
Take him away.

710
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,110
Officer.

711
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,720
I'm telling the absolute truth.

712
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,080
I'm not lying.

713
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,510
Please let me go, officer.

714
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,560
Please let me go.

715
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,390
Officer.

716
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:35,600
Congratulations

717
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,870
on solving

718
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:38,720
the murder case, Judge Wan.

719
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,600
I learned from

720
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,200
the best teacher.

721
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,630
That's all

722
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,270
Feng knows.

723
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,270
Did you hear that?

724
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:50,870
Enlightening.

725
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,110
I wouldn't have shouted

726
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,390
if you weren't here.

727
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:59,750
We've identified the corpses

728
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,030
on the stage.

729
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:02,680
That's basically all we know.

730
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:06,270
They are all high officials.

731
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:08,680
Fifth-rank.

732
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:10,680
Such a high rank?

733
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:11,600
Who are they?

734
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,390
Zhao Muyan, Transportation Inspector of Kaifeng Court.

735
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:17,350
Yue Qide, Deputy Commissioner of salt and iron.

736
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:18,960
And Zhang Qi from

737
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:20,870
the Left Section of the Ministry of Revenue.

738
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,510
Why do they

739
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:24,960
sound so familiar to me?

740
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:28,480
Who are those women

741
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:30,720
mentioned on the red silk?

742
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,060
We're working on it.

743
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:34,560
Several of them are reported missing.

744
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,720
Gu.

745
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:39,410
What about the owner of the Yayuan Mansion?

746
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,560
What can I do?

747
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:43,320
Even the governor is his guest.

748
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,680
His friends are all over the court.

749
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:47,320
We can't look into him.

750
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:49,200
So what do we do now?

751
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:50,440
Right now,

752
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,560
we have only two options.

753
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:54,960
One.

754
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,510
We start with

755
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:57,600
these three victims.

756
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,600
Leave it

757
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,030
to the Kaifeng Court.

758
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,750
Two.

759
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:04,600
Inspect the Underground Culvert.

760
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:06,680
Who will do that?

761
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,340
[Trouble-free]

762
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,110
I'll look into

763
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,150
the Underground Culvert.

764
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,240
No way.

765
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,440
It's too dangerous.

766
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:16,920
Don't go.

767
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,760
The culvert is also called the "trouble-free hole".

768
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,350
Many dangerous outlaws of East Capital

769
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,680
