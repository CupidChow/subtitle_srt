192
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,710
Right!

193
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,510
I don't care anymore!

194
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,390
You're not even considering Zhang Jianzhi.

195
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,950
How can I save those people all by myself?

196
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,950
No one wanted to be my friend when I was young.

197
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,880
They all said I was useless.

198
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,630
They all said I was a freak.

199
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,950
Even if I passed the exam,

200
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,830
maybe, just like my brother said,

201
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,760
I'd be dismissed right after.

202
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,200
If that's the case,

203
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:46,240
then it's better

204
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,510
to forget about it from the start.

205
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,880
I took someone's place in the exam.

206
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:02,760
Remember this register

207
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,360
and remember this name.

208
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,320
Tomorrow, the one entering the exam hall

209
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:07,630
will be him,

210
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,560
not you.

211
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:11,800
I was forced,

212
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:14,630
went into the exam hall,

213
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,950
and wrote the essay.

214
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,240
My essays and poetry,

215
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:25,390
my lofty ambitions,

216
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,760
in the end, all written under someone else's name.

217
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,760
Who forced you?

218
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:36,760
Let's go.

219
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,200
Let's report this to the authorities!

220
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:38,590
Let's go...

221
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,270
- No... - Let's go...

222
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,150
No!

223
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,470
No, Mo!

224
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,470
I...

225
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,510
I can't report it to the authorities.

226
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:47,880
Why?

227
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,120
Why can't you report it?

228
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,120
Because I can't become the next Errand Boy Bo!

229
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,360
I have people I need to protect.

230
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,630
I can't take the risk.

231
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,460
[the Unsilenceable]

232
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,590
I'm not an esteemed scholar.

233
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,920
I always hesitate and overthink.

234
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,560
I'm just a coward.

235
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,510
What's done is done.

236
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,030
There's no turning back now.

237
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,440
I can't untangle

238
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,830
your problem.

239
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:31,930
Wen Yue,

240
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,830
what are you doing here?

241
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:34,710
I'm here for you.

242
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,630
That night, I chased someone

243
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,030
to the shop of mules and horses,

244
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:55,510
and I saw you.

245
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:59,440
But I knew that person wasn't you.

246
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,630
You won't speak up. There must be a reason.

247
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:04,610
But still...

248
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,390
I saw the person you were looking for.

249
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,150
He had a brand on his face.

250
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,000
He's a convicted criminal.

251
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:41,320
Why are you willing to tell me today?

252
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,010
Your family has treated me so kindly.

253
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,060
I'm not a plant.

254
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:48,880
How could I be heartless?

255
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,920
However,

256
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,000
I don't understand.

257
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,500
It's obvious

258
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,030
I haven't been honest about this matter.

259
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:00,150
I've been hiding something from you.

260
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,120
Why didn't you warn Mo

261
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,320
to stop associating with me?

262
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,630
People in this world

263
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,590
may all have a few secrets.

264
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,560
I trust Mo's judgment,

265
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,510
and I also believe

266
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,710
you are a pure-hearted child.

267
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,320
You came to the capital alone for the imperial exam.

268
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,360
If you run into any trouble,

269
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,120
you can come to the umbrella shop

270
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,390
with Mo.

271
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,440
Also, please do me a favor

272
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,240
and tell Buyou about this.

273
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,510
The Ministry of Justice keeps records

274
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,070
of severe criminals.

275
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,180
It's easy to find out

276
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,470
his real identity.

277
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,270
Where did you get this information?

278
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,240
You have me,

279
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,390
and I have my own people.

280
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,800
Don't I have informants?

281
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,120
You trust me so much

282
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:02,920
without asking?

283
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,000
I'm not asking.

284
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,630
But who is your informant?

285
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,000
I'm actually a bit curious.

286
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,150
That won't work.

287
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,320
My informant is timid,

288
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,950
afraid to deal with officials.

289
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,390
It's a one-on-one relationship with me.

290
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,290
Gu,

291
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:21,120
about this,

292
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,320
if we catch the severe criminal,

293
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,950
how much is the bounty?

294
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,240
We'll talk after you catch him first.

295
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,590
You and I, brothers in arms,

296
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,560
who can escape us?

297
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,760
Boss!

298
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,830
Something big has happened!

299
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,680
You three, get out!

300
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,270
Last night, there was heavy rain.

301
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,200
A body was washed up from the suburbs.

302
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,760
A single fatal blow.

303
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,560
The wound is narrow and deep.

304
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,440
Same killer as before.

305
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,680
A fatal blow, exactly the same.

306
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,070
But this one...

307
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,630
Come, Ban,

308
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,510
lift it up.

309
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,680
Why was the face skin peeled off?

310
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,680
The victim looks to be just over twenty.

311
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:09,960
The thumb and index finger have calluses,

312
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,680
Probably a scholar.

313
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:14,390
There's a birthmark behind the left ear,

314
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,110
right here.

315
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:18,350
The fingertips have a touch of dark purple.

316
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,680
Not sure what it is.

317
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,680
Dark purple?

318
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,630
What did he touch before he died?

319
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,080
Can... can I smell it?

320
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:47,840
He

321
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,230
has the smell of mulberry on his hands.

322
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,150
Ban,

323
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,390
check his tongue.

324
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,510
Okay.

325
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,080
The tongue also has dark purple.

326
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:03,840
That's not right.

327
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,350
You can't find mulberries for sale

328
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,420
in East Capital this year.

329
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,680
How did he eat them?

330
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:09,860
Qingfeng Tower,

331
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,330
This year, Qingfeng Tower

332
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,230
launched a new delicacy

333
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,720
called candied mulberries.

334
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:16,680
It's specifically for their VIP guests.

335
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,260
So Qingfeng Tower monopolized

336
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,960
all the mulberries in East Capital.

337
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,630
It seems

338
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,600
- that the victim is very likely... - So...

339
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:25,750
Boss,

340
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,230
I boldly guess

341
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:30,390
the victim must have been a VIP guest at Qingfeng Tower.

342
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,480
You're so smart.

343
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,510
Take a guess,

344
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,440
how many VIPs does Qingfeng Tower have?

345
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,750
Hmm...

346
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,390
Go check.

347
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,600
Yes.

348
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,480
You two handle this properly.

349
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:01,150
"Born with a proud bone, loving the unusual peak,

350
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,440
Why prove it by reaching the clouds?

351
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,960
the Unsilenceable..."

352
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,510
Mo.

353
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,200
Where did you go this morning?

354
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,750
I just returned from the autopsy room.

355
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:21,640
Last night, there was heavy rain in the suburbs,

356
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,440
and a faceless body was washed up.

357
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:28,030
The victim looks to be just over twenty.

358
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,960
What a pity.

359
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,370
Probably a scholar.

360
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:33,800
No face?

361
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,720
No face.

362
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,480
So, at the moment, we can't confirm

363
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,600
the victim's identity.

364
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,840
We can only say

365
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:43,200
that it might have been a VIP guest at Qingfeng Tower.

366
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,990
It's a scholar staying at Qingfeng Tower.

367
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:50,870
Qiyu.

368
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,510
May I have a look at this body?

369
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:56,990
I think

370
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,270
I might know him.

371
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,110
Are you ready?

372
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,390
It's really tragic.

373
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,080
East Capital is dangerous.

374
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,390
I can't stay here any longer.

375
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:19,990
Qiyu,

376
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,990
what exactly happened?

377
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,720
I know the dead man.

378
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,320
It's Kong Er.

379
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:32,990
Kong Er?

380
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,480

381
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,840
Before entering the exam hall that day,

382
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,870
I saw him using someone else's register.

383
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,960
What you mean is

384
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,780

386
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,510
have you heard the story of the Ghost Examiner judging scholars?

387
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,840
Perhaps scholars like us

388
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:59,230
will truly be judged.

389
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,600
Kong Er took the exam for someone else,

390
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,870
and became an unknown corpse.

391
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,440
So, who will be the next to die?

392
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,230
No!

Come with me.

396

Just come with me.

397

Where to?

398
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,720
To Kaifeng Court to find Inspector Gu

399
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,050
and tell him the murder is related to exam cheating.

400
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:15,570
No.

401
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,870
We can't report it to the authorities.

402
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:17,800
Why?

403
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:20,960
Do you think

404
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,350
exam cheating is something new this year?

405
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,150
Has the court ever questioned or investigated it before?

406
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:30,630
I don't believe there is no justice in this world.

407
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,390

I really can't involve your family any further.

413
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,720
Kong Er is already dead.

414
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:42,990
I could be killed at any moment.

415
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,030
Today, I must leave the city.

416
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,480
But before I go, I need to meet someone.

417
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:48,870
I'll go with you.

418

This umbrella looks great.

419

The color is really nice. It suits you.

420
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,390
I'll take this one.

your craftsmanship is still the best.

424
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,350
Yesterday's rain was heavy.

425
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,750
The umbrellas I bought elsewhere were all broken,

426
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,320
but hers was perfectly fine.

427
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:11,000
I asked and found out it's from your shop.

428
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,700
Lady Wen's umbrellas

429
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,780
are not only beautifully designed

430
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,080
but also sturdy and durable.

431
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,460
In East Capital,

432
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,680
they're unique.

433
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:20,110
That doesn't mean other shops' are bad.

434
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,150
It's just because yesterday's rain was really heavy.

435
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,390
I couldn't agree more.

436
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:24,990
It didn't just ruin umbrellas,

437
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,840
but even people got washed out.

438
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,350

It was horrifying.

a narrow cut,

he's usually

464
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,560
a bit strange.

471
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:47,840
that the unknown corpse lived here before.

Stop asking around.

475
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:55,150
I just searched the room carefully.

476

This man seems to have come into some unexpected wealth.

477
00:24:59,150 --> 00:24:59,960
What do you mean?

478
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,480
His outer clothes are all made of expensive silk and satin,

and they're all newly bought.

480
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:09,080

if a sudden windfall came my way,

485
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,350
I'd only focus on dressing the outside

486

and not care much about the base layers.

487
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:23,960
Don't worry.

00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:47,960
I'm going...

570
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,630
I'm just going to relieve myself.

571
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:53,200
Judge Wan!

572
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,800
Judge Wan!

573
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,480
Come in!

574
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,320
Judge Wan,

575
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,450
I'm here today

576
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:01,750
to...

577
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,080
Come in yourself.

578
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,270
Wait outside.

579
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,680
I'm here today

580
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,270
just to talk

581
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:10,990
about my master's case.

582
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:12,350
I'm suing Zou Yongjin.

583
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,630
Why hasn't he come?

584
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:16,440
Judge Wan, here's how it is.

585
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,720
- I... - Both you and your master

586
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,030
killed an old man

587
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,800
at the Taohuadong Brothel

588
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:22,510
around half past Shen time.

589
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,630
Song Qiyu and I witnessed it firsthand.

590
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:28,200
He's talking

591
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,680
about cart driver, right?

592
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,050
That cart driver

593
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:35,690
saw our master spending lavishly,

594
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:37,020
so he tried to extort money from us.

595
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,320
He was bringing a cart full of goods

596
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,030
and immediately demanded 50 guan from us.

597
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:43,530
Has he never seen money before? Is he crazy?

598
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:44,280
What are you saying?

599
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,440
Zhao Mo.

600
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,510
Beating people at Kaifeng Court?

601
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:47,600
- Does anyone care or not? - Zhao Mo!

602
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,510
Use words, not force.

603
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:49,720
Let go of him!

604
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,480
Let go!

605
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,260
Turning things upside down.

606
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,800
They're turning things upside down!

607
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,050
Fifty guan?

608
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,920
Is that your reason for murder?

609
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,720
I clearly saw

610
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,750
not only did you hit the old man,

611
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,150
but you also publicly humiliated him,

612
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,200
with no humanity whatsoever!

613
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:08,230
His injuries are still there.

614
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,800
If we send for the coroner,

615
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,800
we'll know after examining the body.

616
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,030
You're spitting out lies!

617
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,510
He's spitting out lies!

618
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:17,080
He can just make money honestly,

619
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:17,990
but he...

620
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:19,560
he had to smash his head on the ground.

621
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,920
He didn't do it properly,

622
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,270
and killed himself.

623
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,480
- No... - Look at him...

624
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:24,740
He's wrong.

625
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:25,680
He's lying!

626
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,110
Clearly, your people

627
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:28,320
held him down and beat him,

628
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:29,920
and didn't let anyone help!

629
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,170
Judge Wan,

630
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:35,390
I've made it clear to you,

631
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:37,270
but it's impossible to explain to this blockhead.

632
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,560
You go ahead.

633
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:39,630
I have something to do.

634
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,800
I'm leaving.

635
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:41,870
Stop!

636
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,390
When Zou Yongjin committed murder,

637
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,200
Song Qiyu and I were both present.

638
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,320
We are both witnesses.

639
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,030
Witnesses, huh?

640
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:52,480
I have witnesses too.

641
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,350
Look, all the servants behind me

642
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,510
are witnesses.

643
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,320
Did you see anyone hit the cart driver?

644
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,350
Did you see it?

645
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,350
- I didn't see it! - No!

646
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,720
Judge Wan, you heard it too.

647
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:05,560
No one saw it.

648
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:08,350
Then, that's that.

649
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,840
I'm leaving now.

650
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,800
You scoundrel!

651
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,390
You can't leave.

652
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:14,350
You're an accomplice.

653
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,320
You can't leave! You're an accomplice!

654
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,180
What are you doing?

655
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:17,990
You're an accomplice!

656
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,270
Accomplice!

657
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,080
What's going on?

658
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:25,920
Get out!

659
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,720
Go, quickly.

660
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,080
You...

661
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,480
go back first.

662
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,270
I understand

663
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,720
the situation, alright?

664
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:44,750
Go back first...

665
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,200
If you don't arrest those two,

666
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,270
I'm not going anywhere!

667
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,440
It's not that simple.

668
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,870
Handling a case takes time.

669
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:54,630
You see,

670
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,800
we've written everything down.

671
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,270
Alright?

672
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:59,080
Don't get too worked up.

673
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,340
Go back first, alright?

674
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,220
I'm not going!

675
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,390
Arrest them!

676
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:05,150
You're such a stubborn child.

677
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,230
Why are you so stubborn?

678
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:07,480
I'm not going!

679
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,230
Judge Wan.

680
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:09,680
Hey, you...

681
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,630
Here.

682
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,800
He's just a blockhead.

683
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,870
Why bother with him?

684
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,350
Here's a little money.

685
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:14,920
Just take it.

686
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:16,510
Buy drinks for your people.

687
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,600
I know a good restaurant.

688
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,870
I'll take you there next time.

689
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,600
What's this for?

690
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,080
Guards.

691
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,030
Here!

692
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:33,320
Get him out.

693
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:35,920
What do you mean?

694
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,600
You're all in it together.

695
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:41,560
You're all in it together!

696
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:42,560
Just you wait!

697
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,210
- I'll find the witnesses - A kid who hasn't even grown up,

698
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:45,640
- and bring them here! - still pretending to uphold justice.

699
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,920
I'll sue you!

700
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:49,560
Judge Wan,

701
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,600
you can tell fortunes by reading palms?

702
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:55,230
I learned it recently.

703
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:56,510
Come on.

704
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:58,510
Let me tell you,

705
00:33:58,630 --> 00:33:59,510
recently,

706
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:01,600
- I'm always... - You're destined for prison trouble.

707
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:02,630
Really?

708
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:03,920
Let me check it again.

709
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,960
No way.

710
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,840
Guards.

711
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,920
- Here! - Cuff him!

712
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,070
Wan Fu,

713
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,630
do you know who my master is?

714
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,000
You can say I have no evidence of your murders,

715
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,390
but bribing court officials in public,

716
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:13,150
the evidence is undeniable!

717
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:13,800
Take him away!

718
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:15,600
Wan Fu, just wait!

719
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,870
And those people!

720
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,350
- Sir... - Move!

721
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,960
Arrest them and question them properly!

722
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:32,720
Illegal goods.

723
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,280
Those scoundrels from the Zou family

724
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:48,680
bribed the witnesses!

725
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:50,440
Qiyu,

726
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,790
let's go to the court together.

727
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:52,720
You can testify for me!

728
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,350
Qiyu...

729
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,300
[Tao Te Ching]

730
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,620
[Tao Te Ching]

731
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,760
What bad luck.

732
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,130
I don't usually

733
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:26,920
provoke anyone.

734
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,280
Why did this have to happen to me?

735
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,790
What bad luck.

736
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,440
The wound

737
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,110
is deep and narrow,

738
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,200
clearly caused by the same murderer.

739
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,200
First, Xiao Yishui was killed,

740
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,350
then Kong Er,

741
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:03,110
now Song Qiyu.

742
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:05,960
This doesn't add up.

743
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,480
These three have no connection.

744
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,830
The wound was to the neck artery,

745
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:14,310
yet no blood splattered on the bookshelf.

746
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,440
The murder didn't happen here.

747
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,110
One blow,

748
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,240
how much blood would that have been?

749
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,590
He was killed,

750
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:37,590
and his face was skinned.

751
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,000
How deep a grudge is this?

752
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,240
[Tao Te Ching]

753
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:51,070
The killer has something to say.

754
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:56,440
Song Qiyu?

755
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:03,960
Wait.

756
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:20,680
Move.

757
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:33,930
Zhao Mo.

758
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:37,390
Zhao Mo.

759

Don't be too sad.

The dead can't come back to life.

761
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,310
But I have a few questions for you.

762
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,830
Before Song Qiyu died,

763
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:49,140
did you notice him

764
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,280
interacting with any suspicious people?

765
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:52,550
And also,

766
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:54,790
did he display any unusual behavior before he died?

767
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:55,310
Wan Fu,

768
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,310
Could I

769
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:58,040
take Mo home first?

770
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:02,000
We'll go to the court tomorrow to give our statements.

771
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:07,200
Let's go back and rest first.

772
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,200
Come on.

773
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,040
Listen to me. Let's go back and rest first.

774
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,240
Don't be reckless!

775
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,040
This is a crime scene.

776
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,680
I've heard all about it.

777
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,000
How is Mo now?

778
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,870
He hasn't slept all night.

779
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,480
He can't go without eating and sleeping.

780
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:09,630
Go talk to him.

781
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,920
Should I go, or will you?

782
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,070
Wen Yue brought you breakfast.

783
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,920
Eat some.

784
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,480
I understand your feelings,

785
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:17,960
and I can relate to your feelings for Song Qiyu.

786
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:20,960
After all these years,

787
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:22,960
he's the only friend

788
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,310
you've ever brought home.

789
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,280
When I was your age,

790
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:31,760
I also had a close friend.

791
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,390
Back then,

792
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,960
he was my guiding light in life.

793
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:41,920
Later, due to an accident,

794
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,200
he left me.

795
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,590
At the time, I thought everything had collapsed.

796
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:53,960
I even thought of following him.

797
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,870
But later, I realized,

798
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:03,310
born as humans,

799
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:06,440
we are destined to face so much helplessness and weakness.

800
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,590
You can't change life and death.

801
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,150
You can't keep the people who are meant to go.

A person's growth

803

804
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,310
And the pain of that kind of tearing

805
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
can only be healed slowly by time.

806
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,760
What we can do

807
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,790
is to lift ourselves up,

808
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:58,830
help the deceased finish their unfinished business,

809
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,830
and comfort their soul.

810
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,590
Once you're done crying,

811
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,110
remember to drink the porridge while it's still hot.
