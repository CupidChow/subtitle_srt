1
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:27,918
What are you doing?

2
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:29,626
I'm sorry

3
00:00:29,959 --> 00:00:31,584
Sorry for what? Why are you apologizing all of a sudden?

4
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:34,792
You are not my type at all. I’m really sorry.

5
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:37,209
What the hell is wrong with you?

6
00:00:40,918 --> 00:00:43,626
It’s been a year since I broke up with my ex.

7
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:45,250
He was in the military.

8
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,792
We broke up around the time he was a corporal.

9
00:00:47,167 --> 00:00:48,709
I was busy hanging out.

10
00:00:48,709 --> 00:00:51,375
and I was sick and tired of having a boyfriend who was bound by the millitary.

11
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:53,083
So, without anyone saying "Let's break up",

12
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:54,792
We broke up.

13
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,876
What am I doing?

14
00:00:58,626 --> 00:01:00,250
Should I try an app?

15
00:01:01,459 --> 00:01:03,500
But I don’t have any photo to upload though.

16
00:01:09,709 --> 00:01:10,918
Minho Kang?

17
00:01:12,876 --> 00:01:14,626
Hmm… Should I press this or not?

18
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:16,334
Damn it, I don’t know.

19
00:01:22,292 --> 00:01:24,250
What? You usually don’t allow me to go in,

20
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,334
and now you want me to come over?

21
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:32,083
Come in.

22
00:01:34,834 --> 00:01:36,417
I’m going to wash up.

23
00:01:37,042 --> 00:01:38,000
Okay.

24
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,709
I thought you hated kissing.

25
00:02:00,417 --> 00:02:01,959
It's nothing.

26
00:02:37,792 --> 00:02:39,375
What’s going on here?

27
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:41,918
I didn’t know either, but

28
00:02:43,417 --> 00:02:45,292
you two aren't even together anymore.

29
00:02:45,292 --> 00:02:46,125
Are you out of your mind?

30
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,751
Do you think this makes any sense?

31
00:02:49,417 --> 00:02:50,667
Because of you, I was really...

32
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,876
That was in the past.

33
00:02:53,334 --> 00:02:54,959
- WTF, how dare you?
- Hey.

34
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:56,918
Stop it.

35
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:01,542
- I’m leaving.
- Where are you going? You should finish what you were doing.

36
00:03:01,751 --> 00:03:02,626
What?

37
00:03:02,918 --> 00:03:04,250
Why don’t you join us?

38
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:06,250
You don’t mind, do you?

39
00:03:27,334 --> 00:03:29,542
Chan-gyu, what are you doing this weekend?

40
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:32,334
I don’t have any plans yet.

41
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:43,500
Remember, you promised. My time is in the morning

42
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,542
and yours is in the afternoon.

43
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:45,626
Got it.

44
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,584
Where are we going?

45
00:03:47,876 --> 00:03:50,834
Just wait. I’ve planned everything.

46
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:53,459
It’s going to be way better than with that old guy.

47
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,375
Shut up.

48
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,542
I’m starving.

49
00:03:57,542 --> 00:04:01,083
Wait a minute. Let’s go get something delicious to eat.

50
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:02,626
I’m hungry right now.

51
00:04:02,626 --> 00:04:04,834
You’re hungry as soon as you wake up.

52
00:04:04,834 --> 00:04:07,792
Just wait a bit longer, we’ll eat something really good.

53
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:14,834
Here we are.

54
00:04:14,834 --> 00:04:16,459
What? No way.

55
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:18,250
I can’t handle scary rides.

56
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,042
Come on, you can ride with me.

57
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:20,667
Come on.

58
00:04:44,834 --> 00:04:46,626
Time’s up, it’s my turn now.

59
00:04:46,626 --> 00:04:48,500
I'm already fed up with it.

60
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,959
Chan-gyu, do you want to hang out with me longer?

61
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:52,334
Let’s go.

62
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,626
such a boomer.

63
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,125
Hey, wait up!

64
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:38,375
It was so much fun today.

65
00:05:38,751 --> 00:05:41,334
I’ve never ridden such scary things before.

66
00:05:41,334 --> 00:05:43,667
But it wasn’t so bad.

67
00:05:43,667 --> 00:05:44,626
See?

68
00:05:44,626 --> 00:05:47,584
Wasn't it reassuring because I was by your side?

69
00:05:48,542 --> 00:05:50,334
Maybe.

70
00:05:51,667 --> 00:05:53,083
Do you want to go bungee jumping next time?

71
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,584
That’s totally insane.

72
00:05:54,584 --> 00:05:56,167
That’s totally insane.

73
00:05:56,167 --> 00:05:57,334
I’m just kidding.

74
00:05:57,334 --> 00:05:59,334
I think i saw you pee your pants just a moment ago.

75
00:05:59,334 --> 00:06:00,542
What? No way.

76
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:14,709
Are you out of your mind?

77
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:16,334
Are you having something going with the twins?

78
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,542
That could happen.

79
00:06:18,876 --> 00:06:20,125
Oh, my.

80
00:06:20,626 --> 00:06:22,584
That could happen? Are you serious?

81
00:06:22,584 --> 00:06:25,083
You’re such a jerk

82
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,000
You are living in south Korea, not America.

83
00:06:30,042 --> 00:06:32,918
I don’t know what should I do.

84
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:35,918
Why are you so serious. You need to consider one thing. Which one is bigger?

85
00:06:37,042 --> 00:06:38,542
Why do I need to answer the horrible question?

86
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,417
I could ask you a question. Anything wrong?

87
00:06:42,417 --> 00:06:43,542
Actually, I wanna know that too.

88
00:06:43,542 --> 00:06:45,250
Are twins differnt in size?

89
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,250
I don’t want to answer.

90
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,167
Forget it.

91
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:51,292
Then end that weird relationship as soon as possible.

92
00:06:51,292 --> 00:06:52,500
That’s the answer.

93
00:06:54,042 --> 00:06:55,250
Okay.

94
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:59,334
Are you sure?

95
00:06:59,334 --> 00:07:00,959
Okay!

96
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:04,334
Okay. Get it sorted out quickly and let me know.

97
00:07:05,417 --> 00:07:07,209
And lastly,

98
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:08,083
What?

99
00:07:08,709 --> 00:07:10,209
Which one’s better in bed?

100
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:15,042
Shut up! Don’t ask weird questions!

101
00:07:15,042 --> 00:07:16,042
Hang up!

102
00:07:23,792 --> 00:07:26,417
Chan-gyu, do you want to go on a trip abroad?

103
00:07:26,792 --> 00:07:27,542
Abroad?

104
00:07:27,542 --> 00:07:28,918
No way!

105
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:30,834
Damn it, why again?

106
00:07:30,834 --> 00:07:32,083
No trips abroad.

107
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,375
Who do you think you are?

108
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,709
If you’re going, I’m going too.

109
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:37,250
Just stay home.

110
00:07:37,751 --> 00:07:39,209
A homebody like you shouldn’t go on trips.

111
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,834
You’ll just end up fighting.

112
00:07:41,167 --> 00:07:42,834
No, it’s not allowed.

113
00:07:44,417 --> 00:07:45,292
Hey!

114
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:48,167
You’re making decisions without even considering Chan-gyu’s opinion.

115
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,209
What do you think, Chan-gyu?

116
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,500
Well, I...

117
00:07:53,751 --> 00:07:54,542
You don’t want to?

118
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:56,709
No, it’s not that.

119
00:07:56,709 --> 00:08:00,000
But if we’re going, wouldn’t it be better if we all went together?

120
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,459
Let’s see how long you can keep this up.

121
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:10,250
Hey! Min-cheol!

122
00:08:14,334 --> 00:08:15,751
Don’t worry about it.

123
00:08:16,042 --> 00:08:18,542
How can I not worry about it

124
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,209
It's going to take just a couple of days.

125
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:21,918
But he’s still younger brother.

126
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,209
Then you should make a decision quickly.

127
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,000
It’s time to do it.

128
00:08:27,334 --> 00:08:28,876
Okay.

129
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,876
Just give me a little more time.

130
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:39,459
Hey guys, let’s meet at the park in an hour.

131
00:08:46,918 --> 00:08:48,125
I’ve been thinking about it.

132
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:49,459
So?

133
00:08:49,918 --> 00:08:50,542
Min-cheol,

134
00:08:50,542 --> 00:08:51,626
Yes?

135
00:08:51,876 --> 00:08:53,459
I’m sorry, Min-cheol.

136
00:08:54,292 --> 00:08:56,959
I’ve spent a lot of time with Min-ho,

137
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:02,709
and honestly, it just doesn’t feel right to be with you, his twin brother.

138
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,042
I’m really sorry.

139
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,959
Thank you.

140
00:09:10,626 --> 00:09:11,876
What?

141
00:09:12,292 --> 00:09:13,542
Where’s Min-cheol?

142
00:09:13,792 --> 00:09:14,626
Who?

143
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,292
Min-cheol.

144
00:09:16,292 --> 00:09:17,542
Min-cheol?

145
00:09:17,542 --> 00:09:18,918
Who’s Min-cheol?

146
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:22,167
Stop kidding me. Where’s your brother Min-cheol?

147
00:09:22,542 --> 00:09:25,083
What do you mean, my brother? I don’t have a brother.

148
00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:28,125
But you were with him just now.

149
00:09:28,918 --> 00:09:30,375
Are you sick?

150
00:09:30,542 --> 00:09:32,292
What’s going on?

151
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:33,209
Oh... no.

152
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:36,834
Look at the pictures we took together.

153
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,542
Look, it’s just the two of us.

154
00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:42,459
Who’s Min-cheol?

155
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,500
That can’t be.

156
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:45,959
I’m sure...

157
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,250
Min-cheol was there too.

158
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:51,959
Are you okay?

159
00:09:55,292 --> 00:09:57,334
Anyway, Chan-gyu

160
00:09:58,209 --> 00:10:00,542
We’re going out again, right?

161
00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:04,042
Yes, we are.

162
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:08,292
Thank you so much. I’ll be better to you.

163
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:10,751
Let’s go. I’m hungry.

164
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:21,042
[One year later]

165
00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:23,167
It’s been so long since I’ve been here.

166
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:27,083
Should we take a picture here?

167
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:27,709
Sure,

168
00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:29,542
but Min-ho.

169
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:30,542
What?

170
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,417
You really don’t remember Min-cheol?

171
00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:35,959
That again?

172
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,083
Okay. I got it.

173
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:38,959
Let’s take a picture.

174
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:39,959
Hold on.

175
00:11:00,834 --> 00:11:01,834
Min-cheol Kang?
