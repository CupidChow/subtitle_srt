1
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,200
Jihyeon!

2
00:01:42,633 --> 00:01:46,366
I want to make noodles

3
00:01:46,367 --> 00:01:48,399
I need to go buy some

4
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,633
You should sleep more

5
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,467
I'm sorry

6
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:42,333
Do you want some noodles?

7
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,333
Later...

8
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:51,633
What... should we do with his things?

9
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,333
We should mail it to his parents

10
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,600
Ya...

11
00:05:04,667 --> 00:05:08,600
I saw his sister at school a while ago

12
00:05:11,467 --> 00:05:13,132
You have her contact information?

13
00:05:13,133 --> 00:05:15,333
No...

14
00:05:25,567 --> 00:05:27,367
Should we just move out?

15
00:05:28,067 --> 00:05:29,233
Move out?

16
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,633
Kind of feels weird to stay

17
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,767
Gyuchul　-What?

18
00:05:57,567 --> 00:05:59,100
What should we do about Geonwu?

19
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,333
I don't know...

20
00:06:04,533 --> 00:06:06,600
it's all so confusing

21
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,067
What do we do with these?

22
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,667
There's 3 more inside

23
00:06:42,233 --> 00:06:43,767
He was gone,

24
00:06:44,567 --> 00:06:47,433
but the scent of him remained

25
00:06:49,767 --> 00:06:54,200
The faint smell lingered in the darkness
and threatened to fade away at any time

26
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,633
It wandered, lost, in my mind

27
00:08:24,433 --> 00:08:26,067
Hey, Sujin

28
00:08:26,567 --> 00:08:28,333
What are you doing?

29
00:08:29,633 --> 00:08:30,467
What are you doing?

30
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,267
Replacing a light bulb

31
00:08:33,533 --> 00:08:35,333
Jihyeon,

32
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,600
I'm going to be late tonight

33
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,233
How come?

34
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,333
This sucks...

35
00:08:43,433 --> 00:08:46,667
We were supposed to go get pasta...

36
00:08:46,767 --> 00:08:48,667
We'll have to rain check...

37
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:50,267
Ya...

38
00:08:50,367 --> 00:08:51,567
Do you have to work overtime?

39
00:08:51,767 --> 00:08:53,133
Ya...

40
00:08:55,267 --> 00:08:57,500
Don't be too angry, work hard!

41
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,600
Got it.

42
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,066
If I finish early, I'll call

43
00:09:04,067 --> 00:09:06,600
Ok, go on then

44
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,533
All right

45
00:09:19,567 --> 00:09:21,133
Come in

46
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,266
We're here to collect the TV?

47
00:09:25,267 --> 00:09:25,567
Hello!

48
00:09:25,568 --> 00:09:26,699
Is this for Professor Min's class?

49
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,566
Yes. Are you fixing the lamp?

50
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:30,599
Ya, don't forget the cables

51
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,667
Senior.

52
00:09:32,067 --> 00:09:35,366
Jihyeon, leave it, he'll do it later

53
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:36,433
Nah

54
00:09:36,567 --> 00:09:37,733
Who says I'm gonna?

55
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,333
Wait...

56
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:42,233
Is everyone here?

57
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,266
Ya, except two

58
00:09:44,267 --> 00:09:45,400
Ok, work hard

59
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,367
My peaceful everyday, with good people

60
00:10:29,633 --> 00:10:32,167
$3 bento,

61
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:35,233
the lunch of a contract staff

62
00:10:39,367 --> 00:10:41,267
"Live like the flowing river"

63
00:10:44,033 --> 00:10:46,333
But to where is my river flowing?

64
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,333
Yes

65
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,533
Yes

66
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,500
Jihyeon,

67
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,700
hi

68
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:30,100
Wow, look who it is!

69
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,200
What brings you here?

70
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,432
It's been a while

71
00:11:36,433 --> 00:11:37,733
Were you writing something?

72
00:11:38,033 --> 00:11:40,733
Ah this... just scribbles

73
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,200
How have you been?

74
00:11:47,533 --> 00:11:49,399
How was life as the youngest last year?

75
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,233
Oh, that's all over

76
00:11:51,433 --> 00:11:53,367
I want to make my own now

77
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,033
Coffee?

78
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,500
You're making me nervous

79
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,767
Good to see you, still

80
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,232
What

81
00:12:15,233 --> 00:12:16,500
Nothing.

82
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,267
You remember when I was in school,

83
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,766
my professors didn't like me?

84
00:12:24,767 --> 00:12:26,067
And?

85
00:12:31,433 --> 00:12:34,199
They'd never let me, so...

86
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,600
You want to use school equipment?

87
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:40,432
If it's too much trouble, it's ok

88
00:12:40,433 --> 00:12:42,367
I'll make do with what I have

89
00:12:45,367 --> 00:12:47,033
When are you filming?

90
00:12:50,467 --> 00:12:53,133
Just as long as the dates don't overlap
with the students'

91
00:12:54,767 --> 00:12:56,433
Thank you, Jihyeon

92
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:05,999
I'm doing this
because I want to see your movie, ok?

93
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,467
So make it good

94
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:09,400
I will

95
00:13:10,067 --> 00:13:12,200
And don't bring stuff like this next time

96
00:13:13,033 --> 00:13:14,167
Sure

97
00:13:15,267 --> 00:13:16,332
So when next month?

98
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:19,000
Next month, third week...

99
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,433
For 4 days?　-Yeah.

100
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:31,432
You have a pretty wife, a son,

101
00:13:31,433 --> 00:13:32,632
and a nice house,

102
00:13:32,633 --> 00:13:34,667
so why don't you go home?

103
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:38,699
Ya, ya, I totally understand

104
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,399
I knew it was something like that

105
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,666
You had a totally beat look,

106
00:13:43,667 --> 00:13:46,999
I wondered if something bad happened

107
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,066
I didn't intend to look or anything,

108
00:13:49,067 --> 00:13:52,632
but I saw the marks on your wrist, too

109
00:13:52,633 --> 00:13:55,066
You wanted to end it all, huh?

110
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:56,000
Huh?

111
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:59,532
Ya, I totally knew it

112
00:13:59,533 --> 00:14:02,567
I do understand, I do

113
00:14:03,433 --> 00:14:05,000
Ok, ask me anything

114
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,633
Come on.

115
00:14:08,533 --> 00:14:10,999
Sure, you can definitely wonder that

116
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,066
Does the insurance company

117
00:14:14,067 --> 00:14:17,633
cover a premeditated death, a suicide?

118
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,200
That's what you want to know?

119
00:14:19,367 --> 00:14:23,033
Does the insurance company
cover a premeditated death, a suicide?

120
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,200
Forget it, asshole

121
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,766
Oh, look, the record button was on

122
00:14:29,767 --> 00:14:31,766
A suicide is not claimable at all

123
00:14:31,767 --> 00:14:36,232
Don't even think about killing yourself

124
00:14:36,233 --> 00:14:37,633
People work their asses off

125
00:14:37,767 --> 00:14:41,633
How dare you think such things?

126
00:14:41,767 --> 00:14:44,700
Do some honest work, you fucking ass

127
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,700
Good. We'll be in touch

128
00:14:53,033 --> 00:14:55,766
I have another one I can show you,

129
00:14:55,767 --> 00:14:59,099
it'll blow your mind

130
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,533
Just now was good too. I'll call you

131
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:06,433
Thank you

132
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,733
A conscription order was issued

133
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,532
We'll all be dragged to serve

134
00:15:17,533 --> 00:15:20,000
as shields of the Japanese army

135
00:15:22,267 --> 00:15:24,400
No one wants to die a wasteful death

136
00:15:26,733 --> 00:15:28,567
On January 20, 1942,

137
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,533
Australian troops recaptured New Guinea

138
00:15:30,633 --> 00:15:32,999
and on May 30, the US Navy defeated

139
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
the Japanese army and occupied Palau

140
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,066
On November 11, 1942,

141
00:15:37,067 --> 00:15:39,433
British troops defeated Japanese troops
in Myanmar

142
00:15:39,533 --> 00:15:41,166
and US submarine units captured

143
00:15:41,167 --> 00:15:43,067
the Japanese Aleutian Islands

144
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,166
We have received information
from Korean students

145
00:15:48,167 --> 00:15:51,367
who joined the ROK Army

146
00:15:52,533 --> 00:15:54,100
that hundreds of deserters

147
00:15:54,233 --> 00:15:56,367
joined our Liberal Army

148
00:15:58,067 --> 00:16:00,732
In Manchuria there are more than
2 million Korean compatriots,

149
00:16:00,733 --> 00:16:02,333
and 300,000 of them are ready to

150
00:16:02,433 --> 00:16:05,100
join the Army immediately

151
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,132
In the Soviet Union and Central Asia,

152
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:10,067
more than 300,000 trained soldiers are

153
00:16:10,267 --> 00:16:12,067
ready to be deployed

154
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:18,167
Now Tokyo is being helplessly bombed
by the US,

155
00:16:18,567 --> 00:16:22,100
and Japanese Navy lost
four main carriers in the Sea of Japan.

156
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,560
Have you ordered from here before?

157
00:16:25,633 --> 00:16:27,700
Ya, a few times.

158
00:16:28,433 --> 00:16:31,332
It feels home-made

159
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,667
We've been ordering from here often

160
00:16:35,567 --> 00:16:37,233
I like home-cooked meals,

161
00:16:38,367 --> 00:16:40,367
ever since I moved out

162
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,400
It makes me miss mom

163
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,366
Anyway, sorry,

164
00:16:45,367 --> 00:16:47,132
I know
I need to pay my share of the deposit

165
00:16:47,133 --> 00:16:48,700
Just right now, things are a bit...

166
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:53,633
It's ok, it's money we'll get back

167
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,032
Apparently we can use the rooftop, too

168
00:16:57,033 --> 00:16:58,067
Really?

169
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,499
We can have barbeques up there

170
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,000
Sweet

171
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,332
We need to buy some chairs

172
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:06,400
Ya?

173
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,167
Well, we can't eat on the floor

174
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,500
We'll buy a little at a time

175
00:17:13,067 --> 00:17:14,633
Let's get camping chairs

176
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,267
Nice

177
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:21,600
There should be things we can reuse
from the stuff at home

178
00:17:27,233 --> 00:17:28,533
This is so good

179
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:39,100
（Without Saying Goodbye）

180
00:17:54,767 --> 00:17:56,366
It's because you're attacking me

181
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:59,032
You didn't answer your phone last night

182
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:00,333
Where were you drinking?

183
00:18:00,433 --> 00:18:01,433
I was at Byeongcheol's

184
00:18:01,434 --> 00:18:05,267
I'm supposed to believe your phone died
at Byeongcheol's house?

185
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,732
This is total nonsense,

186
00:18:06,733 --> 00:18:08,367
do you think you're convincing?

187
00:18:09,067 --> 00:18:12,667
No battery? At someone's house?

188
00:18:13,067 --> 00:18:14,366
Shouldn't you believe me?

189
00:18:14,367 --> 00:18:16,132
And I apologized　-Would you believe it?

190
00:18:16,133 --> 00:18:18,167
And someone who's sorry acts like this?

191
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,166
Anyone watching would think

192
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:24,000
I'm the bad guy, not you

193
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:31,700
You aren't actually sorry

194
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,633
What the hell

195
00:19:23,567 --> 00:19:25,467
If you'd heard the things

196
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,600
I wanted to say

197
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:32,167
If I'd known the things

198
00:19:33,033 --> 00:19:34,400
you couldn't say

199
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,100
Good, huh?

200
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:36,567
What kind of noodles are these?

201
00:20:37,367 --> 00:20:40,700
The cheapest kind

202
00:20:41,633 --> 00:20:43,267
Then how come it's so good?

203
00:20:44,433 --> 00:20:47,666
The trick is making soup with seaweed

204
00:20:47,667 --> 00:20:51,567
kind of tastes like ones we ate as kids

205
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,333
These are terrific

206
00:20:57,167 --> 00:20:58,599
Perfectly al dante

207
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,300
Whose recipe is this?

208
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,700
Mine

209
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:18,333
Slightly undercooked noodles are best

210
00:21:20,233 --> 00:21:22,467
I don't want them if they're too soggy

211
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,667
How should we take care of the chores?

212
00:21:30,133 --> 00:21:32,767
We divide them,

213
00:21:33,133 --> 00:21:37,067
but it's hard to make a schedule

214
00:21:37,233 --> 00:21:39,367
so we just take turns

215
00:21:40,033 --> 00:21:43,167
we're pretty flexible

216
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,766
Nothing's concrete

217
00:21:45,767 --> 00:21:48,199
Usually whoever's home does it

218
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,566
But Geonwu does all the laundry

219
00:21:50,567 --> 00:21:51,732
You like doing laundry?

220
00:21:51,733 --> 00:21:54,667
I do. In fact, the machine's going now

221
00:21:56,667 --> 00:21:58,200
I love doing laundry

222
00:21:59,233 --> 00:22:02,167
When we have our barbeque on the roof

223
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:04,067
tell Sujin to come, too, Jihyeon

224
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,732
Yeah.

225
00:22:05,733 --> 00:22:07,467
She can be a bit shy...

226
00:22:11,167 --> 00:22:12,567
Would she be uncomfortable with us?

227
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,100
No, nothing like that,

228
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,532
but it just takes her time
to warm to up to someone

229
00:22:17,533 --> 00:22:18,533
I never got to meet her

230
00:22:18,534 --> 00:22:19,699
Yeah?

231
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,432
Isn't she curious about how you live?

232
00:22:22,433 --> 00:22:25,600
I should use honorifics with her, ya?

233
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,133
Ya, I accidentally said Sujin just now

234
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:33,300
You don't have to be so formal with her

235
00:22:34,133 --> 00:22:35,366
You're right.

236
00:22:35,367 --> 00:22:37,167
Gaeun comes occasionally often

237
00:22:37,433 --> 00:22:39,433
What's occasionally often?

238
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,367
She says occasionally

239
00:22:42,733 --> 00:22:44,600
but it's actually often?

240
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:51,567
She kind of stays but comes often?

241
00:22:53,367 --> 00:22:56,733
The view is great from up there,
so invite her

242
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,100
Have some water　-Thanks.

243
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:11,133
I didn't look sad this time, right?

244
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:17,533
See...

245
00:26:22,733 --> 00:26:26,499
it doesn't have to be exactly like that

246
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:30,167
You did a good job, really, just...

247
00:26:32,767 --> 00:26:34,500
How should I say...

248
00:26:39,733 --> 00:26:42,167
Not every emotion has to be

249
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:50,233
expressed for the audience to see

250
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,700
I just keep thinking

251
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,600
I need to look sad

252
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,733
It is written as a sad scene...

253
00:27:13,333 --> 00:27:20,033
The set up and dialogue are somber...

254
00:27:21,367 --> 00:27:23,767
But if you think about

255
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,466
the person he's missing,

256
00:27:26,467 --> 00:27:30,667
this is not what he would've wanted

257
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:40,000
So sadness doesn't need to be shown

258
00:27:45,033 --> 00:27:47,766
You can do it!

259
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:50,033
We're almost there!

260
00:27:51,033 --> 00:27:54,433
Ask when Gangseop is getting here

261
00:27:58,767 --> 00:28:02,533
Anyway, put simply,

262
00:28:04,267 --> 00:28:09,400
the person you're portraying...

263
00:28:11,667 --> 00:28:14,599
doesn't need to look miserable

264
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,299
Laugh, joke, whatever,

265
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,232
do what feels right,

266
00:28:20,233 --> 00:28:27,299
even if the lines don't say it

267
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:35,233
You just need to not to look... sad

268
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:39,000
Because with the dialogue...

269
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,767
Hum.....

270
00:28:42,233 --> 00:28:44,699
the message is pretty clear

271
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,466
The meaning is apparent, so relax

272
00:28:46,467 --> 00:28:48,666
and do what you feel is right

273
00:28:48,667 --> 00:28:49,667
What I feel is right?

274
00:28:49,668 --> 00:28:54,766
Right, let's not try to "make,"

275
00:28:54,767 --> 00:28:59,132
but go with whatever occurs naturally

276
00:28:59,133 --> 00:29:00,432
Kind of confusing, right?

277
00:29:00,433 --> 00:29:02,300
Ok, let me try one more time

278
00:29:02,433 --> 00:29:05,733
No, we can try lots of times

279
00:29:06,233 --> 00:29:08,132
Just relax, and go with it

280
00:29:08,133 --> 00:29:09,400
Ok, I'll try

281
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:13,000
I think I can do it in one

282
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,200
The rain is really coming down

283
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:56,533
Come in

284
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,433
Hello

285
00:34:03,467 --> 00:34:06,767
Is Jihyeon around?

286
00:34:07,433 --> 00:34:10,100
He just stepped out...

287
00:34:12,033 --> 00:34:15,032
He'll be back soon,
so you can sit and wait

288
00:34:15,033 --> 00:34:16,433
Sure

289
00:34:35,167 --> 00:34:37,467
Are you eating cereal
instead of a proper meal?

290
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,500
Because I really like cereal...

291
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,400
Jihyeon always eats cereal instead, too

292
00:34:46,467 --> 00:34:48,067
Are you... his girlfriend?

293
00:34:48,433 --> 00:34:49,600
Yes, I am

294
00:34:50,067 --> 00:34:51,033
Nice to meet you,　-Nice to meet you, too.

295
00:34:51,034 --> 00:34:52,433
I'm Geonwu, I live with him

296
00:35:15,433 --> 00:35:16,700
Y'all listening?

297
00:35:17,567 --> 00:35:20,233
Second of all, connections

298
00:35:22,667 --> 00:35:24,000
Third of all,

299
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,200
connections

300
00:35:28,333 --> 00:35:32,400
This is the reality of the film scene
in Korea

301
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:36,367
Am I wrong? Back me up, Jihyeon

302
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,999
Stop asking him to agree with you

303
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,400
I don't really know...

304
00:35:41,133 --> 00:35:45,632
He's been doing this longer,

305
00:35:45,633 --> 00:35:47,267
so why can't I ask?

306
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,300
Did I make things awkward?

307
00:35:54,567 --> 00:35:58,400
You've talked about this three times

308
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,767
You should stop now

309
00:36:00,133 --> 00:36:02,732
You're always telling me to stop

310
00:36:02,733 --> 00:36:06,500
It's for your own good

311
00:36:06,667 --> 00:36:09,366
Ok, ok. But did I do something wrong?

312
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:13,699
No, it might cause a misunderstanding
So stop

313
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,600
How?

314
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:17,699
Why can't you ask when you're sober?

315
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:22,100
You always do this when you're drunk

316
00:36:25,033 --> 00:36:26,766
Oh, so I have made things awkward

317
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:29,133
No, no

318
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,567
Just admit it if it's true

319
00:36:33,667 --> 00:36:36,466
We're all friends now

320
00:36:36,467 --> 00:36:38,567
Tell me if you're pissed off,

321
00:36:39,233 --> 00:36:42,033
but I'm just telling you the truth

322
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,033
See, but Mr Dongjae...

323
00:36:51,767 --> 00:36:53,366
Right, Jihyeon, you're seeing him
for the first time

324
00:36:53,367 --> 00:36:54,667
Dongjae,

325
00:36:56,033 --> 00:36:58,299
is on vacation from the army

326
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,367
and wants to have fun,

327
00:37:01,533 --> 00:37:03,533
but things are too serious right now

328
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,066
Did I make it serious?

329
00:37:07,067 --> 00:37:08,532
No, it's not that,

330
00:37:08,533 --> 00:37:10,466
but everyone knows the reality already,

331
00:37:10,467 --> 00:37:13,133
so we don't need to hear it repeated?

332
00:37:14,067 --> 00:37:19,633
We know it's unfair and not easy

333
00:37:20,067 --> 00:37:23,533
I'm saying that younger people

334
00:37:24,167 --> 00:37:26,467
should know the social obstacles

335
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:27,767
We get it

336
00:37:27,768 --> 00:37:29,467
Are you a broken stereo?

337
00:37:31,367 --> 00:37:34,066
I've already heard the stories

338
00:37:34,067 --> 00:37:39,300
and you tell me every time I'm here

339
00:37:39,633 --> 00:37:42,333
You've got it all messed up, Dongjae

340
00:37:42,633 --> 00:37:45,333
you're in the army right now,
so you don't know

341
00:37:45,767 --> 00:37:48,700
The army's almost done, so you're happy

342
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,699
But once you get out? It'll be hell

343
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,033
So what do you think of my prospects?

344
00:37:53,667 --> 00:37:55,499
You are too complacent right now

345
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,632
I'm too complacent?

346
00:37:56,633 --> 00:38:02,767
With no thoughts about the future...

347
00:38:03,067 --> 00:38:06,333
This is no laughing matter

348
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,100
So,

349
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:16,200
what do you think I should do?

350
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:20,500
What do I think...?

351
00:38:21,367 --> 00:38:22,399
Jihyeon, where are you going?

352
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,400
Gotta make a call...

353
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,800
My standards are...

354
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,167
They're so noisy

355
00:38:31,333 --> 00:38:33,333
I was about to go to my room, too

356
00:38:34,767 --> 00:38:38,900
Why do people say stupid shit
when they're drunk?

357
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,633
Who knows...

358
00:38:43,933 --> 00:38:45,667
Do you want to watch a movie here?

359
00:38:46,833 --> 00:38:48,167
Do you want to?

360
00:38:51,067 --> 00:38:52,600
I'll come over

361
00:38:59,867 --> 00:39:02,499
You're serving now,
but after your service,

362
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,132
you'll be an actor

363
00:39:05,133 --> 00:39:06,699
But I'm saying you aren't ready

364
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:09,300
I'm not ready?　-And you are?

365
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,199
Geonwu, you tell him

366
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,067
He's not ready.

367
00:39:17,367 --> 00:39:18,867
He's not, right?

368
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,832
Let me just ask one thing

369
00:39:24,833 --> 00:39:26,200
What have you been doing?

370
00:39:26,633 --> 00:39:27,633
Me?

371
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:31,132
I'm doing auditions like crazy

372
00:39:31,133 --> 00:39:36,533
What's the point though?
You're always drunk when I see you

373
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,566
And all you say to me is I'm not ready,

374
00:39:38,567 --> 00:39:40,167
or that I'm oblivious

375
00:40:30,967 --> 00:40:34,533
Are they going to
the washroom together?

376
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,167
I guess they're that close

377
00:40:39,067 --> 00:40:41,100
Indeed

378
00:40:47,133 --> 00:40:50,000
I heard you work for a company...

379
00:40:50,333 --> 00:40:51,433
Ya,

380
00:40:53,067 --> 00:40:54,900
it's a small one

381
00:40:56,733 --> 00:41:00,299
I'm trying to become a news anchor

382
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:03,532
though it's not my major

383
00:41:03,533 --> 00:41:05,133
Oh, really?

384
00:41:06,633 --> 00:41:09,267
I think it would suit you well

385
00:41:09,833 --> 00:41:11,000
Thank you

386
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:30,167
How long have you been seeing Geonwu?

387
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,900
About 4 years

388
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,600
That's a long time

389
00:41:36,733 --> 00:41:39,199
I heard you've been dating a while, too

390
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,033
Ya, I think we're nearing 4 years

391
00:41:56,067 --> 00:42:00,732
I know we said we'd build a log house

392
00:42:00,733 --> 00:42:02,867
on the east coast when we're old

393
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,833
but I've been thinking,

394
00:42:07,133 --> 00:42:10,633
wouldn't Jeju be nicer?

395
00:42:11,767 --> 00:42:12,767
Right?

396
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:19,967
We can build right on the shore,

397
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:24,800
have a couple of big dogs...

398
00:42:25,833 --> 00:42:27,000
Thoughts?

399
00:42:32,267 --> 00:42:33,333
It's good

400
00:42:33,967 --> 00:42:35,400
What's good?

401
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,033
Did you even hear me?

402
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,367
Jeju is good

403
00:42:42,833 --> 00:42:46,367
Then do you want to go to Jeju
for our summer vacation?

404
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,100
We can look at houses　-Go to sleep...

405
00:42:56,633 --> 00:42:57,433
Hug me

406
00:42:57,434 --> 00:42:59,133
Stop

407
00:43:01,833 --> 00:43:03,233
Are you sleeping?

408
00:43:05,233 --> 00:43:06,500
Are you that tired?

409
00:43:10,967 --> 00:43:12,833
That's not good.

410
00:43:13,833 --> 00:43:15,000
I'm going to bite!

411
00:43:18,067 --> 00:43:19,367
Don't...

412
00:46:19,867 --> 00:46:22,133
The pinwheel sends my heart fluttering

413
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:26,167
Relieving my parched throat

414
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:30,633
and the tears that welled up in my eyes

415
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,200
Oh man, how much did you drink?

416
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,000
Get a grip.

417
00:46:50,133 --> 00:46:51,533
Where are you going?

418
00:46:55,533 --> 00:46:56,973
Have you got something on your mind?

419
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:01,733
Stand up

420
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:07,032
Jihyeon, I'm ok, seriously

421
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:08,667
Ok, ok

422
00:47:10,533 --> 00:47:11,533
What's your name?

423
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,300
Oh Gyucheol

424
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:19,200
How the heck are you Gyucheol

425
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,700
Be careful...

426
00:47:38,967 --> 00:47:40,000
Let's go home

427
00:47:40,867 --> 00:47:42,232
Let's go home

428
00:47:42,233 --> 00:47:43,299
We will

429
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:44,467
Let's go

430
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:49,500
Here!

431
00:47:53,333 --> 00:47:54,333
Are you ok?

432
00:48:03,633 --> 00:48:05,032
He drank too fucking much

433
00:48:05,033 --> 00:48:06,900
Why's he so trashed?

434
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:09,632
Senior! Senior!

435
00:48:09,633 --> 00:48:11,367
Grab him

436
00:48:12,233 --> 00:48:13,300
I'm your friend Seongi

437
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:15,767
Watch your head

438
00:48:20,433 --> 00:48:21,967
Why he so trashed?

439
00:48:22,967 --> 00:48:24,067
Legs in

440
00:48:27,367 --> 00:48:29,466
Shove over, asshole

441
00:48:29,467 --> 00:48:30,767
Wake up

442
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:35,033
I'll close the door

443
00:53:28,067 --> 00:53:30,200
You're pretty good at this

444
00:53:34,033 --> 00:53:36,066
I can never get it to light

445
00:53:36,067 --> 00:53:37,967
That's why I don't even try

446
00:53:38,967 --> 00:53:40,500
It just goes out right away

447
00:53:41,033 --> 00:53:42,167
Sorry, sorry

448
00:53:42,767 --> 00:53:43,767
Welcome

449
00:53:44,267 --> 00:53:45,533
The traffic was horrible

450
00:53:46,067 --> 00:53:47,333
Late again, huh?

451
00:53:47,667 --> 00:53:49,667
Sorry　-You're always late

452
00:53:51,233 --> 00:53:53,433
Why do you bother to make appointments?

453
00:53:56,833 --> 00:53:57,833
What's got him irked?

454
00:53:58,333 --> 00:53:59,333
What

455
00:53:59,333 --> 00:54:00,333
You angry?

456
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:01,500
No

457
00:54:02,333 --> 00:54:03,733
You totally are

458
00:54:04,133 --> 00:54:05,499
I'm not angry,
you're just late all the damn time

459
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:07,366
Stop it, guys

460
00:54:07,367 --> 00:54:09,033
I already apologized

461
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:14,733
You're in no position to get angry back

462
00:54:16,433 --> 00:54:17,533
Stop it

463
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:20,533
Well, you're late, so go get the meat

464
00:54:22,333 --> 00:54:25,300
Why are you telling me what to do?

465
00:54:26,033 --> 00:54:27,000
I'm not

466
00:54:27,001 --> 00:54:30,199
We prepared everything, just go grab it

467
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,900
Don't look at me like that

468
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:34,900
Stop it

469
00:54:36,767 --> 00:54:43,200
We've been waiting to do this
for days

470
00:54:46,433 --> 00:54:47,433
Jihyeon...

471
00:54:55,533 --> 00:54:56,567
I'll just go get it

472
00:54:57,133 --> 00:54:58,233
What's wrong

473
00:55:05,667 --> 00:55:06,867
What's his problem?

474
00:55:08,267 --> 00:55:10,533
Is he PMSing?

475
00:55:16,233 --> 00:55:17,933
The fire's dying

476
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:22,500
Don't go picking fights

477
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:23,500
Seongi,

478
00:55:24,133 --> 00:55:25,133
Cho Seongi!

479
00:55:28,933 --> 00:55:30,467
Should we go down?

480
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:38,967
The fire's totally dead

481
00:57:02,967 --> 00:57:03,967
Hey

482
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:08,260
Are you going to keep being a stranger?

483
00:57:09,667 --> 00:57:10,667
You can stop

484
00:57:10,668 --> 00:57:11,988
if that's what you're here to say

485
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,467
Dad's not doing very well

486
00:57:15,333 --> 00:57:17,267
He wants to see you for the
last time

487
00:57:18,633 --> 00:57:21,732
I don't care whether he dies or not

488
00:57:21,733 --> 00:57:23,067
Act your age

489
00:57:24,133 --> 00:57:26,332
How long are you gonna keep this up?

490
00:57:26,333 --> 00:57:28,367
I don't like him either

491
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:31,067
You may not like him

492
00:57:31,733 --> 00:57:33,066
but you like his money,

493
00:57:33,067 --> 00:57:34,766
you can buy a house, start a café...

494
00:57:34,767 --> 00:57:35,767
Stop!

495
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,667
I'm busy. You should go

496
00:57:53,233 --> 00:57:55,073
Spend it or don't
Do whatever the hell you want

497
00:59:17,233 --> 00:59:20,367
I used to go once a month, and gladly

498
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,833
But then it became once a year,

499
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,400
or several years

500
00:59:33,067 --> 00:59:36,867
I still can't get used to being
in the same room as my father

501
00:59:39,333 --> 00:59:41,267
He came home drunk all the time

502
00:59:44,667 --> 00:59:46,800
when I was in high school

503
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:54,500
A friend's family owned a bath house

504
00:59:55,333 --> 00:59:57,000
so I lived there for a month...

505
00:59:57,933 --> 00:59:59,933
Sometimes I'd help clean

506
01:00:01,067 --> 01:00:02,533
Basically I ran away from home

507
01:00:04,133 --> 01:00:05,367
Then went back later

508
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:11,766
You didn't get in trouble?

509
01:00:11,767 --> 01:00:13,200
Of course I did

510
01:00:15,167 --> 01:00:17,600
I've never been beaten worse

511
01:00:26,933 --> 01:00:28,067
And your younger brother?

512
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:34,600
Well, he wants to leave home, too

513
01:00:35,233 --> 01:00:37,799
but because of his personality,

514
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,400
he hasn't been able to leave yet

515
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:48,133
When I see my parents

516
01:00:49,333 --> 01:00:53,533
I used to only dislike my father

517
01:00:54,833 --> 01:00:58,732
but now, I wonder why my mother

518
01:00:58,733 --> 01:01:01,633
makes herself put up with him

519
01:01:03,067 --> 01:01:04,700
They both seem stupid

520
01:01:06,533 --> 01:01:10,400
I realized this in high school

521
01:01:13,567 --> 01:01:22,033
From then, I didn't want them meddling

522
01:01:23,433 --> 01:01:24,799
But how to gain that freedom?

523
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:27,267
I shouldn't receive financial help

524
01:01:28,167 --> 01:01:34,033
I'm in my last term of college now

525
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:41,567
I paid for my tuition and living costs,
taking terms off to work

526
01:01:43,433 --> 01:01:44,967
whenever I needed money

527
01:01:45,533 --> 01:01:50,600
And like that...

528
01:01:52,533 --> 01:01:54,500
When they didn't give me money,

529
01:01:55,967 --> 01:01:57,833
they got involved less

530
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,867
and told me to do as I pleased

531
01:02:00,233 --> 01:02:02,600
I don't know...

532
01:02:04,567 --> 01:02:05,667
It's not easy...

533
01:02:14,467 --> 01:02:15,700
I hear you...

534
01:02:19,467 --> 01:02:21,800
You know what they say

535
01:02:22,333 --> 01:02:25,367
Better I leave if I dislike where I am

536
01:02:26,133 --> 01:02:27,933
So I left home

537
01:05:54,467 --> 01:05:58,367
Dude, you didn't actually see anything,

538
01:05:59,767 --> 01:06:02,667
so don't make it sound as if it's fact

539
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:08,200
Ask them yourself, stop questioning me

540
01:06:08,933 --> 01:06:11,633
How can I answer if I've seen nothing?

541
01:06:16,567 --> 01:06:18,100
You're making no sense, I'm hanging up

542
01:07:48,833 --> 01:07:54,000
Without anger, without anger

543
01:07:54,467 --> 01:08:00,199
When giving and giving love
without holding back

544
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:05,533
A million, a million flowers bloom

545
01:08:06,267 --> 01:08:11,200
And I can return to my planet

546
01:08:12,133 --> 01:08:17,367
Without anger, without anger

547
01:08:17,833 --> 01:08:23,167
When giving and giving love
without holding back

548
01:08:23,633 --> 01:08:28,967
A million, a million flowers bloom

549
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:34,333
And I can return to my planet

550
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:46,667
True love brought tears of pain
to my eyes

551
01:08:47,433 --> 01:08:58,367
A world filled with sorrow,
with too many farewells

552
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:10,932
I discovered a love that gave everything

553
01:09:10,933 --> 01:09:22,067
that came like the rain,
after countless years

554
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:27,233
Without anger, without anger

555
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:33,100
When giving and giving love
without holding back

556
01:09:33,833 --> 01:09:38,567
A million, a million flowers bloom

557
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:44,433
And I can return to my planet

558
01:09:45,900 --> 01:09:50,733
Without anger, without anger

559
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:56,567
When giving and giving love
without holding back

560
01:09:57,767 --> 01:10:02,067
A million, a million flowers bloom

561
01:10:03,467 --> 01:10:08,200
And I can return to my planet

562
01:10:15,233 --> 01:10:20,000
It will continue,
even if everyone has departed

563
01:10:20,967 --> 01:10:25,433
It was a long-awaited love

564
01:10:27,033 --> 01:10:31,633
that came to find me

565
01:10:33,033 --> 01:10:44,632
With you, I can make more flowers bloom

566
01:10:44,633 --> 01:10:55,167
And as one, we will return to my star

567
01:10:56,033 --> 01:11:00,567
Without anger, without anger

568
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:07,233
When giving and giving love
without holding back

569
01:11:07,633 --> 01:11:12,067
A million, a million flowers bloom

570
01:11:13,533 --> 01:11:17,933
And I can return to my planet

571
01:11:19,433 --> 01:11:24,333
Without anger, without anger

572
01:11:25,267 --> 01:11:30,167
When giving and giving love
without holding back

573
01:11:30,933 --> 01:11:35,933
A million, a million flowers bloom

574
01:11:36,867 --> 01:11:41,167
And I can return to my planet

575
01:12:30,567 --> 01:12:32,767
Yo Ray! Question!

576
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:35,232
Rihanna with no boobs,

577
01:12:35,233 --> 01:12:37,433
and Beyonce with elephant thighs.

578
01:12:39,733 --> 01:12:41,100
Give me five seconds...

579
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:42,733
Rihanna

580
01:12:42,734 --> 01:12:44,167
Fuck man! You gay.

581
01:12:44,267 --> 01:12:46,299
No boob that's gay.

582
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:47,467
Rihanna so young

583
01:12:48,667 --> 01:12:50,699
Wash you hands man, I'm cool

584
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:52,266
Shit! Man!

585
01:12:52,267 --> 01:12:54,466
Think how many fags used this toilet.

586
01:12:54,467 --> 01:12:55,899
You right...

587
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:56,900
Use your soap

588
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:25,867
Good afternoon...

589
01:13:49,733 --> 01:13:51,300
Hello.

590
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,732
I told you he is gay!

591
01:13:55,733 --> 01:13:57,999
You might get HIV now man

592
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,599
Don't touch me!

593
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:01,232
Wash your hands

594
01:14:01,233 --> 01:14:02,233
Wash it twice man!

595
01:14:02,433 --> 01:14:14,867
Damn!

596
01:14:39,967 --> 01:14:41,433
Can I borrow a light?

597
01:14:54,733 --> 01:14:56,300
Fuck, man...

598
01:15:10,867 --> 01:15:12,067
What did you say?

599
01:15:17,967 --> 01:15:19,533
I said, what did you say?

600
01:16:58,033 --> 01:16:59,567
Just tell them

601
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:04,867
I don't want to lie

602
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:09,833
Stiffen up your upper lip,

603
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:13,867
and just say I made you do it,

604
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:17,333
that you were a victim

605
01:18:19,633 --> 01:18:25,867
Ok, I'll be at the overpass at 9:20

606
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:30,133
Got it, take care

607
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:43,800
Geonwu,

608
01:18:47,733 --> 01:18:49,867
people are telling me I'm crazy

609
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:56,767
But I believe you'll come back to me

610
01:18:59,367 --> 01:19:02,833
Because you just got lost for a bit

611
01:19:11,167 --> 01:19:13,933
What do you say to going to the beach
during summer break?

612
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:16,467
Let's just call it off

613
01:19:22,233 --> 01:19:23,567
What?

614
01:19:24,533 --> 01:19:26,167
No, we can't end it like this

615
01:19:26,700 --> 01:19:27,767
I'm sorry

616
01:19:39,667 --> 01:19:41,800
You like that dirty bastard that much?

617
01:20:10,367 --> 01:20:12,100
What makes you think you're so clean?

618
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:51,033
(I'll do it.)

619
01:24:40,633 --> 01:24:41,800
You don't like women?

620
01:25:04,733 --> 01:25:11,232
Blow job, man!

621
01:25:11,233 --> 01:25:13,399
Shit man, I want to have sex

622
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:14,533
That was good

623
01:25:21,233 --> 01:25:23,000
Let me go, you fucker

624
01:25:35,667 --> 01:25:36,699
Stop it, stop it

625
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:41,000
I thought we were friends, asshole

626
01:25:41,633 --> 01:25:43,833
I'll kill you

627
01:25:45,633 --> 01:25:46,667
Fuck!

628
01:28:46,900 --> 01:28:48,067
Sorry to barge in

629
01:28:48,567 --> 01:28:49,733
Hello!

630
01:29:04,333 --> 01:29:05,467
Sorry to barge in

631
01:29:15,567 --> 01:29:18,067
Jihyeon, did something happen?

632
01:29:18,733 --> 01:29:19,733
It's nothing

633
01:29:30,100 --> 01:29:31,100
Jihyeon,

634
01:29:31,967 --> 01:29:33,800
do you like Japanese songs?

635
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:37,467
I don't know

636
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:44,267
I will sing you one to cheer you up

637
01:29:53,133 --> 01:30:01,366
Let's walk with our eyes on the sky

638
01:30:01,367 --> 01:30:09,666
Don't let the tears fall

639
01:30:09,667 --> 01:30:12,167
It's a lonely night

640
01:30:13,300 --> 01:30:23,133
that reminds me of that spring day

641
01:30:26,133 --> 01:30:33,899
Let's walk with our hearts straight

642
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:41,332
Count the fading stars

643
01:30:41,333 --> 01:30:47,333
It's a lonely night

644
01:30:48,367 --> 01:30:53,633
on a teary walk home

645
01:30:55,867 --> 01:31:02,000
Is happiness above the clouds?

646
01:31:02,900 --> 01:31:09,000
Is happiness beyond the sky?

647
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:18,066
Let's walk with our hearts straight

648
01:31:18,067 --> 01:31:24,667
Don't let the tears fall

649
01:34:20,433 --> 01:34:21,433
Jihyeon

650
01:34:22,967 --> 01:34:24,400
I'm sorry,

651
01:34:25,933 --> 01:34:28,067
but you need to move out

652
01:34:32,067 --> 01:34:35,400
I can't be housemates with you anymore

653
01:34:37,633 --> 01:34:42,733
You're basically a rapist...

654
01:34:45,633 --> 01:34:46,633
Ya,

655
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:54,533
maybe you can go tomorrow?

656
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:08,567
I think...

657
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:14,267
It'd be better if you didn't stay here

658
01:35:16,267 --> 01:35:18,333
Shouldn't have had you move in
in the first place

659
01:35:23,933 --> 01:35:28,567
Why are you all hanging your heads?

660
01:35:31,033 --> 01:35:32,900
Are we all not thinking the same thing?

661
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:37,367
Say something

662
01:35:40,967 --> 01:35:43,067
I'll pack my things and leave tomorrow

663
01:35:51,233 --> 01:35:52,767
I'm going to call it a night

664
01:36:05,700 --> 01:36:08,167
He's so damn shameless

665
01:36:09,867 --> 01:36:10,966
Woah, easy

666
01:36:10,967 --> 01:36:12,267
Let him hear!

667
01:36:13,467 --> 01:36:15,366
We haven't done wrong

668
01:36:15,367 --> 01:36:17,733
Can you guys look up?

669
01:36:18,467 --> 01:36:22,566
Geonwu, don't look so down,

670
01:36:22,567 --> 01:36:24,767
it makes you look like the guilty one

671
01:36:37,867 --> 01:36:40,732
As summer fades and autumn begins,

672
01:36:40,733 --> 01:36:44,700
mornings and nights have become cooler

673
01:36:45,867 --> 01:36:49,600
"I don't read books by living authors

674
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:52,532
but with the dead,

675
01:36:52,533 --> 01:36:55,700
everything feels more forgivable,"

676
01:36:56,900 --> 01:36:59,700
said a character from a novel

677
01:37:00,933 --> 01:37:02,933
There are many reasons

678
01:37:03,333 --> 01:37:09,066
the departed leave marks in our hearts,

679
01:37:09,067 --> 01:37:13,000
especially those who left us too soon

680
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:17,067
they are free from mistakes or errors

681
01:37:17,833 --> 01:37:21,733
and also from betrayal, or changes

682
01:37:23,133 --> 01:37:27,599
In an ever-evolving world such as ours

683
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:33,333
maybe it's natural to miss
those who will never change

684
01:37:34,300 --> 01:37:38,067
The first song request of the night is

685
01:37:38,333 --> 01:37:42,100
Shim Soobong's One Million Roses

686
01:37:55,533 --> 01:37:59,633
A long time ago, when I came to earth

687
01:38:01,333 --> 01:38:06,033
from a distant star

688
01:38:07,200 --> 01:38:11,400
There was a whisper in my ear,

689
01:38:13,133 --> 01:38:17,333
that said, "go spread love"

690
01:38:19,067 --> 01:38:23,400
make blossom the flowers that bloom

691
01:38:24,933 --> 01:38:29,400
when you're in love

692
01:38:30,967 --> 01:38:35,467
A rose of love that only blossoms

693
01:38:36,933 --> 01:38:41,333
for true love

694
01:38:42,900 --> 01:38:47,833
Without anger, without anger

695
01:38:48,700 --> 01:38:54,033
When giving and giving love
without holding back

696
01:38:54,367 --> 01:38:59,567
A million, a million flowers bloom

697
01:39:00,267 --> 01:39:05,167
And I can return to my planet

698
01:39:06,267 --> 01:39:11,333
Without anger, without anger

699
01:39:12,067 --> 01:39:17,133
When giving and giving love
without holding back

700
01:39:17,833 --> 01:39:22,933
A million, a million flowers bloom

701
01:39:23,900 --> 01:39:28,467
And I can return to my planet

702
01:39:30,167 --> 01:39:40,667
True love brought tears of pain
to my eyes

703
01:39:41,700 --> 01:39:47,666
A world filled with sorrow,

704
01:39:47,667 --> 01:39:52,367
with too many farewells

705
01:39:53,500 --> 01:40:04,167
I discovered a love that gave everything

706
01:40:05,267 --> 01:40:15,633
that came like the rain,
after countless years

707
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:21,267
Without anger, without anger

708
01:40:22,333 --> 01:40:27,367
When giving and giving love
without holding back

709
01:40:28,100 --> 01:40:32,600
A million, a million flowers bloom

710
01:40:34,167 --> 01:40:38,567
And I can return to my planet

711
01:40:39,933 --> 01:40:44,833
Without anger, without anger

712
01:40:45,733 --> 01:40:50,767
When giving and giving love
without holding back

713
01:40:51,633 --> 01:40:56,167
A million, a million flowers bloom

714
01:40:57,400 --> 01:41:02,333
And I can return to my planet

715
01:41:17,833 --> 01:41:18,833
What?

716
01:41:21,300 --> 01:41:24,067
Stop eating cereal, you'll get fat

717
01:41:25,533 --> 01:41:27,400
I'm going to the gym tomorrow...

718
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:31,467
Could you stock up on my cigarettes?

719
01:41:32,500 --> 01:41:34,067
Can you actually do some work...

720
01:41:34,633 --> 01:41:38,366
And, when I'm arguing with the director

721
01:41:38,367 --> 01:41:40,200
shouldn't you be on my side?

722
01:41:52,467 --> 01:41:56,967
I just wanted to see you

723
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:01,367
and wanted to ask you

724
01:42:03,100 --> 01:42:04,733
why you did what you did

725
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:07,200
and where you are now

726
01:42:10,133 --> 01:42:12,267
Then you'd say,

727
01:42:15,767 --> 01:42:17,733
that I'll know with time

728
01:42:19,067 --> 01:42:20,933
So I'll ask again,

729
01:42:24,033 --> 01:42:26,133
did you not worry about me at all?

730
01:42:28,567 --> 01:42:30,900
You'd tell me

731
01:42:33,733 --> 01:42:35,767
stop being childish

732
01:42:40,933 --> 01:42:43,967
So I'd ask again,

733
01:42:55,100 --> 01:42:56,200
did you...

734
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:02,433
not miss me?

735
01:43:09,967 --> 01:43:12,033
And you'd reply...

736
01:43:25,933 --> 01:43:27,200
You...

737
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:49,767
you'd sigh and take a drag

738
01:43:57,400 --> 01:43:59,433
Then I'd be crying like this...

739
01:44:01,733 --> 01:44:02,833
And you'd...

740
01:44:09,300 --> 01:44:10,933
And you'd...

741
01:44:18,467 --> 01:44:20,367
hug me, right?

742
01:45:05,033 --> 01:45:07,299
There was an old roadside pub there

743
01:45:07,300 --> 01:45:09,900
and it had superb food

744
01:45:11,933 --> 01:45:13,500
But the owner died

745
01:45:16,367 --> 01:45:18,233
Hung himself in the store

746
01:45:24,700 --> 01:45:27,400
Around the time I began this life,

747
01:45:31,733 --> 01:45:34,533
Around the time I was doing everything
to be noticed

748
01:45:39,900 --> 01:45:41,767
It was all my fault,

749
01:45:43,667 --> 01:45:45,533
all of it
