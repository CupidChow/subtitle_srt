[BLEND FEELINGS Episode 15]

2
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:02,130
Let's talk.

3
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,260
Okay, let's talk.

4
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:05,970
About what?

5
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,110
You've been jumpy all day.

6
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:08,940
Why?

7
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,670
Clause 3 says Party B must unconditionally

8
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:16,950
be honest with Party A.

9
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,440
I know.

10
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,780
If I tell him that I know his fate

11
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,550
because of the bullet comments,

12
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:27,350
he definitely won't believe me.

13
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,039
I had a dream.

14
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,630
Dreamt that someone killed you.

15
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,590
So you've been worried about me all day?

16
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,770
I know I'm dumb,

17
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,600
and I can't really help you much.

18
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,270
But I'm really afraid
something might happen to you.

19
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,450
Come with me.

20
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,140
What is this?

21
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,090
From the car to the office to the house,

22
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,620
there's a full security system.

23
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,360
It includes an electric fence,
anti-intrusion system,

24
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,920
24-hour alarm system,

25
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,010
patrol system,

26
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,650
and perimeter defense system.

27
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,890
Are these all foolproof?

28
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,880
They can defend against
over 99% of threats.

29
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:31,100
But many of my dreams
have come true before,

30
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,460
so you absolutely can't get hurt.

31
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,040
You must live a long life, okay?

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,610
Okay.

33
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,970
M-M-My takeout has arrived.

34
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,840
What did you order?

35
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,120
Jian Xiangxiang, don't chicken out.

36
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:18,610
Gu Jingshi.

37
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,130
What did you call me?

38
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,280
I don't want to call you Chairman Gu.

39
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,640
I want to call you Gu Jingshi.

40
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,390
Actually,

41
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,440
I had ulterior motives

42
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,490
when I approached you at first.

43
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,380
Back then,
I wanted to get revenge on Gu Jiacheng.

44
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,910
I wanted to become your wife.

45
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,300
But as time went by,

46
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,710
and we got to know each other,

47
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,340
you kept helping me,

48
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,920
encourage me,

49
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,040
pulling me out of the mud.

50
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,880
I don't know

51
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,150
when I fell for you.

52
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,660
But by the time I realized it,

53
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,200
you were already in my heart.

54
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,760
Gu Jingshi,

55
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,890
I like you.

56
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,260
Confessions

57
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,920
are better left to men.

58
00:04:53,409 --> 00:04:54,240
Look.

59
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,000
Do you like it?

60
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:12,150
You prepared this?

61
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,210
I've never been a romantic person.

62
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:15,810
But for you,

63
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,210
I can learn.

64
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,210
So...

65
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,230
You like me too?

66
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,560
Haven't I made it obvious enough?

67
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,130
Why do I feel like crying right now?

68
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,870
This is so sweet.

69
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:20,730
Kiss him.

70
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,200
Better get in a few more kisses now.

71
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,400
Someone else is about to show up.

72
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,080
Do you have someone else?

73
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,340
What are you thinking?

74
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,159
Who's that?

75
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:03,180
Jingshi, when did your legs heal?

76
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,950
Why didn't you tell me?

77
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,070
Jingshi, that's wonderful!

78
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,690
You can finally stand again.

79
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,600
You're here so late at night.

80
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,590
What's the matter?

81
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:21,950
Jingshi, please go explain to the police

82
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,170
that this is all a misunderstanding.

83
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,120
Tell them to let Jiacheng out.

84
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,900
Faking a statement is illegal.

85
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,150
He's your nephew, after all.

86
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,150
He knows he was wrong.

87
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,390
I'm begging you.

88
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,240
Please let him go.

89
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,720
He's my only son.

90
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,350
He can't go to prison!

91
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:55,159
Jingshi, I know it was Jiacheng's fault.

92
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:58,070
But for the sake of family,

93
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,430
could you show some mercy and let him go?

94
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,080
Family?

95
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:06,990
Jingshi.

96
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,260
Are you really going to be so ruthless?

97
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,810
Actions have consequences.

98
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:12,340
He brought this on himself.

99
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,350
Gu Jingshi...

100
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,730
Don't hold me back!

101
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,970
Please stop making a scene, alright?

102
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,120
I am the victim here.

103
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,640
I was the one who called the police.

104
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,840
I'm the one who wants Gu Jiacheng
to receive his punishment.

105
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,690
It has nothing to do with Gu Jingshi.

106
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,090
Miss Jian, could you please...

107
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:40,890
No.

108
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,840
I cannot forgive him.

109
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:43,679
I won't change my testimony,

110
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,210
and I won't commit perjury.

111
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,610
Please stop pressuring him.

112
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:49,540
This is my decision.

113
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,220
Forget it.

114
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,880
Let's stop pressuring Jingshi.

115
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,360
Dad, let's go.

116
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:02,920
Come on.

117
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,880
We'll meet again, Miss Jian.

118
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,230
That scared me to death.

119
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,050
Thank you for getting me
out of that situation, Miss Jian.

120
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:17,250
Protecting Mr. Gu is my honor.

121
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,000
Well...

122
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,900
We were interrupted just now.

123
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,790
Shall we continue?

124
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:25,890
Continue what?

125
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,630
When do you think the formula
for the Eight Methods of Fragrance

126
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,470
will see the light of day again?

127
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,340
You carry this thing with you?

128
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,200
I take it out and flip through it
when I have nothing to do.

129
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,000
Why do you ask?

130
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,790
I thought you'd hide something

131
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,150
so important.

132
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,260
Is it important?

133
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:17,450
To outsiders, it might be a legend,

134
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,350
and yes, it's important to me too,

135
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:23,590
but I'd rather combine
experience and innovation

136
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,420
to develop its essence further.

137
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,310
Let me see.

138
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,840
I can try to restore it.

139
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,060
Really?

140
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,800
Go squeeze a bowl of lemon juice for me.

141
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,850
Lemon juice?

142
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,440
Okay.

143
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,040
Lemon juice.

144
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:19,660
Heating citric acid

145
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,720
helps the paper fibers expand

146
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,910
which can restore some faded text.

147
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,080
Well?

148
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,280
We need to wait a moment.

149
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,020
Wow, that's amazing!

150
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,840
Gu Jingshi, you're incredible!

151
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,290
However, due to its age,

152
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,690
this is the best we can do.

153
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,460
I'm already very satisfied.

154
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,200
This is the Golden Fragrance of Jade Dew.

155
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,100
Doesn't this mean the other formulas
can be restored too?

156
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,630
That's fantastic!

157
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:01,800
Give me your hand quickly.

158
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,330
I want to see if this is real.

159
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,870
That hurt, didn't it?

160
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:09,370
So I'm not dreaming!

161
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:17,690
Jingshi, do you know what my dream is?

162
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:18,360
What is it?

163
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:25,240
I hope to bring traditional Chinese scents
to the world,

164
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,610
so that more people

165
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,480
can appreciate
our country's cultural treasures.

166
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,810
Alright, let's work on it together.

167
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,690
Yes, let's work on it together.

168
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,990
I already leaked to you that Chairman Gu

169
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,350
burns incense to sleep.

170
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,420
Stop making me...

171
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:05,650
What?

172
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,350
You're going to
make a move on Chairman Gu?

173
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,550
Once this job is done,

174
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,570
we'll be even.

175
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,590
Okay, I'll take photos
of the security layout for you.
