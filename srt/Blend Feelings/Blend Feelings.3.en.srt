[BLEND FEELINGS Episode 3]

2
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,190
In the perfumes you've developed,

3
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,960
all I smell is a jumble of scents.

4
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,210
No emotion,

5
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,320
no complexity,

6
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:49,980
just cloying cheapness.

7
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,030
Chairman Gu.

8
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,130
I-I-I'll go back and fix it right away.

9
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:54,110
Next time, I'll definitely...

10
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:58,170
If you don't succeed by month's end,
the entire department is disbanded.

11
00:00:59,100 --> 00:00:59,960
Uncle Jingshi.

12
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,080
You may leave now.

13
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,440
What is it?

14
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,780
Chairman Gu, um,

15
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,930
this is a traditional scent
newly developed by my team and I.

16
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:15,880
Kunshan Jade.

17
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,180
What's the formula?

18
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,370
Agarwood, sandalwood,

19
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:23,930
frankincense, amber,

20
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,660
honey, and jasmine.

21
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:26,750
What kind of honey?

22
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:28,190
Jujube flower honey.

23
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,320
You led the development?

24
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,060
I told you not to lie to me.

25
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,740
It was
developed by a novice perfumer.

26
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,850
I don't care what methods you use,

27
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,980
but there mustn't be any legal issues.

28
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,120
I've already prepared everything.

29
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:17,980
[Jian Xiangxiang]

30
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,220
Kunshan Jade alone is not enough.

31
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,050
We need to release
a couples' edition for the Qixi Festival.

32
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,170
Develop a men's version within a month.

33
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:35,170
Well...

34
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,050
Is that a problem?

35
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:39,550
No,

36
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:40,970
no problem. Don't worry.

37
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,020
Leave.

38
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,420
What the hell?

39
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,980
Damn cripple.

40
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,640
Hey, baby.

41
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,030
Gao Yi.

42
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:12,290
Boss.

43
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,300
Look into Jian Xiangxiang.

44
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,430
I want every detail.

45
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:16,970
Yes, Boss.

46
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,170
Xiangxiang.

47
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:32,620
Get out.

48
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,490
Xiangxiang.

49
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,600
Listen to me, Xiangxiang.

50
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,880
Xiangxiang, I was wrong.

51
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,320
I had too much to drink that night.

52
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,760
I said things I shouldn't have, okay?

53
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,720
Xiangxiang, if you really love me,

54
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,680
shouldn't you just forget about this?

55
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,480
Xiangxiang, forgive me this once, please?

56
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,880
What about Kunshan Jade?

57
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,610
Why did you steal my formula?

58
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:53,410
My dear Xiangxiang.

59
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,400
Just think about it.

60
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:58,760
Can you and your grandfather
launch Kunshan Jade on your own?

61
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,110
You...

62
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,310
Even if you succeeded in developing it,

63
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,200
wouldn't you need money
for marketing and distribution?

64
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,130
Do you have that?

65
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,190
I do.

66
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,360
Yaoge Group has plenty of money.

67
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,540
I'll take Kunshan Jade to new heights.

68
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:12,810
Xiangxiang,

69
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,020
just for that,

70
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,100
shouldn't you be thanking me?

71
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,070
I bet a pack of spicy strips

72
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,269
she's going to forgive this jerk again.

73
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,960
How dumb is she? How can she believe this?

74
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,790
I must say, Gu Jiacheng's
manipulation tactics are something else.

75
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,790
Don't go soft now,

76
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,980
he only came to you for that Qixi Festival

77
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,510
couples' edition perfume.

78
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,360
Falling for it once is naive.

79
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,720
Falling for it twice is just stupid.

80
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,600
Shut up! All of you shut up!

81
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,090
Are you crazy?

82
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:39,870
Gu Jiacheng,

83
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,920
you think I don't know
what you're thinking, don't you?

84
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,080
You're trying your old tricks

85
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,240
to steal my formula again, aren't you?

86
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:45,760
Let me tell you,

87
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,610
I'm not that stupid!

88
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,740
How did this idiot suddenly get smart?

89
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,970
I can't believe
I trusted you so much in the past.

90
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,930
I won't fall for your sweet talk
ever again.

91
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,010
I'm telling you.

92
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,480
You stole my Kunshan Jade formula.

93
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,290
I'm taking you to court.

94
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,510
We live in a society ruled by law now.

95
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,920
If I didn't have your signed transfer,

96
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:07,280
how could I possibly get your formula?

97
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,120
Gu Jiacheng.

98
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,790
Gu Jiacheng, listen.

99
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,040
Kunshan Jade succeded!

100
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,630
I'm so happy!

101
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,080
Xiangxiang.

102
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,090
If you're not drunk,

103
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,020
write your name for me.
I don't believe you.

104
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,320
So that's why...

105
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,240
That's why you asked
for my signature that day.

106
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,800
You were
tricking me into signing a transfer!

107
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,600
Yeah.

108
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,770
I tricked you into signing a transfer.

109
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:44,490
So what?

110
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,030
Gu Jiacheng, you...

111
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,760
Even so,

112
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,500
go ahead and sue me if you dare!

113
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,659
Let me tell you.

114
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,840
The entire legal department of Yaoge Group
is ready to take you on anytime.

115
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,210
I'll give you a few days.

116
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,160
Think it over before you come back to me.

117
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,640
Grandpa.

118
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,530
Weren't you at the nursing home?

119
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:34,680
Why did you come back?

120
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,280
I came back to get something.

121
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,880
What do you need?

122
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,940
I'll get it for you.

123
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,560
Grandpa

124
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,230
heard everything.

125
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,690
I'm sorry, Grandpa.

126
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,600
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

127
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,720
It's not your fault.

128
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,040
Not your fault.

Kunshan Jade

130
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:02,770
helped you see someone's true colors.

131
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,320
To me, that's really worth it.

132
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:08,270
Nothing is

133
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,480
more precious than my granddaughter.

134
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:21,010
This manuscript has been
in our family for six generations.

135
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:24,050
Today, I'm

136
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,410
passing it to you.

137
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,960
The Eight Methods of Fragrance.

138
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,790
This book really exists?

139
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:32,590
Yes.

140
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,960
But this book is too precious,

141
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,740
I don't dare to keep it.

142
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,540
Grandpa is getting old.

143
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,890
It's time

144
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,800
to pass it on to you.

145
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,280
Due to various reasons,

146
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,909
it has become incomplete,

147
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,210
so outsiders can't read it at all.

148
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,400
Only our Jian family,
through oral tradition,

149
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,440
has preserved some secret techniques.

150
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,360
Actually,

151
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,080
they're the perfume-making techniques
I've been teaching you.

152
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,860

153
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,490
with your talent,

154
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:06,710
you'll gradually unlock

the essence of this manuscript

156
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,360
and create more traditional scents.

157
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,900
I won't let the Jian name down.

158
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,770
And I won't let you down.

159
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,570
Good.

160
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,300
Boss.

161
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:31,620
I've looked into it.

162
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,690
Director Gu and Miss Jian
were college sweethearts.

163
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,780
Interesting.

164
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,679
Also,

165
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:43,970
this Miss Jian

166
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,800
is Jian Mowei's granddaughter.

167
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,360
The legendary Eight Methods of Fragrance
originated from the Jian family.

168
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,980
People say the Eight Methods of Fragrance
have been lost for years.

169
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,290
Otherwise, Jian Mowei wouldn't have

170
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,700
spent all these years
stuck in a tiny workshop

171
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,230
with nothing to show for it.

172
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,590
Call Jian Xiangxiang

173
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,340
and tell her to come to work tomorrow.

174
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:03,920
Yes, sir.

175
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,450
But Boss,

176
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,920
do you think Miss Jian

177
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,560
will really be of use to us?

178
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,000
In that car accident 10 years ago,

179
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,750
I lost my mother, and nearly my own life.

180
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,750
I'll never forget

181
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
this grudge.

182
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,620
Even the smallest pawn,

183
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,480
if placed in the right position,

184
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,680
can become the key to changing the game.

185
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:23,690
Understood.

186
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,170
[Jian's Fragrance]

187
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,600
Hello?

188
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,600
Hello,

189
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,920
is this Jian Xiangxiang, Miss Jian?

190
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,590
Yes, that's me.

191
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:53,230
Hello.

192
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,340
I'm Gao Yi, Yaoge Group
Chairman Gu's special assistant.

193
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,680
Chairman Gu asked me to inform you
to report to work tomorrow.

194
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,560
Is that okay?

195
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,160
That's no problem.

196
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,600
Thank you,

197
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,920
and please thank Chairman Gu as well.

198
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,520
Great.

199
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,250
See you tomorrow.

200
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,250
See you tomorrow.

201
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:28,170
Thank you, Chairman Gu,

202
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:28,950
thank you for hiring me.

203
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,480
I'll definitely work hard.

204
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:33,990
Chairman Gu.

205
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,540
Have you been to the hospital
for a check-up?

206
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,720
Sedatives are central nervous system
depressants.

207
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,090
Even brief exposure

208
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:40,700
could affect you...

209
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,260
Let go.

210
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:48,290
This ice-cold boss is terrifying.

211
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,050
Bye bye.

212
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,080
Hello.

213
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,370
Who are you looking for?

214
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,790
Hi, I'm Jian Xiangxiang, the new perfumer.

215
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,380
Pleased to meet you.

216
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,060
How come I didn't know

217
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,390
the company was hiring?

218
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,200
Mr. Gao asked me to come here.

219
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,520
Gao Yi?

220
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:38,820
And you are?

221
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,650
I'm Director Gu's secretary,

222
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:43,630
Lin Shasha.

223
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,560
In three months,
you'll be sent to a mental hospital

224
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,360
by the scumbag couple in bed now.

225
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,980
The same bracelet.

226
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,380
And she's his secretary too.

227
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,310
She must be the woman from that day.

228
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,940
My boyfriend gave this to me
on Valentine's Day.

229
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,720
Is it pretty?
