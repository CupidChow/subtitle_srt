[BLEND FEELINGS Episode 10]

2
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,190
[Who are you?]

3
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
She's now with Uncle Jingshi.

4
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,370
She'll probably give
the Eight Methods of Fragrance to him.

5
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,620
No.

6
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,440
No, why?

7
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,030
Why does he get all the good things?

8
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,810
My father is the eldest son,

9
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,730
yet he only has
a nominal position in the company.

10
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,640
I'm Gu Jiacheng,

11
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,940
the only child in the third generation
of the Gu family.

12
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,480
Why does he get all the good things?

13
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,280
Alright.

14
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,920
At worst, get rid of her.

15
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,830
What do you mean?

16
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,350
As long as Jian Xiangxiang is gone,

17
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,079
neither us nor Gu Jingshi

18
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,780
can get the book.

19
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:20,790
What do you mean?

20
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,000
There are many ways

21
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,350
to make someone disappear in this world.

22
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,120
I just got the news.

23
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,850
Gu Jingshi will go to Hong Kong
in a few days for business.

24
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:34,010
That’s our best chance.

25
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:38,930
Indeed.

26
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,800
They say the more beautiful a woman is,
the more dangerous she is.

27
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,480
I just hope

28
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,800
there’s only one
Mrs. Chairman of Yaoge Group.

29
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,280
And that's me.

30
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,180
Of course.

31
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:42,670
Oh my God, why would I have such a dream?

32
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:45,960
But

33
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,480
if Chairman Gu can stand up,
that’d be good.

34
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,940
Chairman Gu, are you okay?

35
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,380
Have you had enough?

36
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,880
Get out now.

37
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,300
You've already fallen down.

38
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,890
Let me help you up first.

39
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,570
Then close your eyes first.

40
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,250
Okay.

41
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,370
Here I come then.

42
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,340
What are you doing with your hand?

43
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,280
I'm helping you up.

44
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,470
What else would I be doing?

45
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,600
Close your left eye.

46
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:44,830
Fine.

47
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:50,490
Chairman Gu.

48
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,740
You're so heavy.

49
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,570
Stop helping me.

50
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:55,980
Go get my shirt first.

51
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,040
It's okay, let me help you up first.

52
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:11,910
Clause 15 of the contract:

53
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,180
Party B must not touch Party A physically.

54
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,840
Go memorize the contract now.

55
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,990
I’ll check tonight.

56
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,240
I was just trying to help you,

57
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,640
and you're lecturing me.

58
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,730
What did you say?

59
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:22,450
I said okay.

60
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,740
I'll definitely memorize it by tonight.

61
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,160
Chairman Gu, here are your pants.

62
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,440
Let me help you put them on.

63
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,240
No need.

64
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,720
How can you not need help?

65
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,030
How can you do it by yourself?

66
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,470
Can't I handle this simple task?

67
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,780
You're underestimating me.

68
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,650
You’re wearing it wrong.

69
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:37,570
That's just one side.

70
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:38,570
No, it’s not.

71
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,470
I'm sorry.

72
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:41,850
Get out.

73
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,370
Are you Miss Jian?

74
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,380
I'm Chairman Gu's maid, Liu.

75
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,750
Hello, Mrs. Liu.

76
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,400
Miss Jian,

77
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,080
what would you like for lunch?

78
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,880
I'm fine with anything,

79
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,490
I’ll eat whatever Chairman Gu eats.

80
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:09,290
Okay.

81
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:11,730
What is this?

82
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,600
Chairman Gu burns the benzoin incense
every night.

83
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,000
May I take a look?

84
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:16,620
Of course.

85
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,320
[Benzoin Incense]

86
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,160
Benzoin incense.

87
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,750
Why does it smell a bit bitter?

88
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,250
Chairman Gu.

89
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,500
What is it?

90
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,540
Where did you buy this benzoin incense?

91
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,800
From an incense master in Hong Kong.

92
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,720
A friend I trust completely. What’s wrong?

93
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,800
If I tell you

94
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,530
that there’s something wrong

95
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:57,890
with this incense,

96
00:07:58,780 --> 00:07:59,980
would you believe me?

97
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,680
What kind of problem?

98
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,100
I suspect it contains cocklebur.

99
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,520
Excessive use can cause headaches,
dizziness, irregular heartbeat,

100
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:15,850
and even shock.

101
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:23,090
Are you sure it contains cocklebur?

102
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,080
Absolutely sure.

103
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:26,520
You may doubt anything about me,

104
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,040
but not my sense of smell.

105
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:29,550
Although it's

106
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,570
not as strong as aconite,

107
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,289
for experts,
it's still quite recognizable.

108
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:43,190
Gao Yi, go test the incense’s
ingredients in the lab.

109
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:46,350
What do you want to say?

110
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:47,790
I just think

111
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,970
though you look powerful,

112
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:53,370
there are many dangers around you.

113
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,500
I'm used to it.

114
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,540
Is there anything I can do for you?

115
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,940
You’ve done enough, thanks.

116
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,700
You can go now.

117
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,550
Though the boss stays calm,

118
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,520
being betrayed by his friend

119
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,380
must be very painful for him.

120
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,420
Chairman Gu.

121
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:44,370
What?

122
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,480
I’ll make incense to
help you get better sleep,

123
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:48,270
okay?

124
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:56,290
Okay.

125
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,220
Chairman Gu,
do you have any favorite scents?

126
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,900
Aren’t you making incense
that can help me get better sleep?

127
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,780
There are many kinds.

128
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,280
But many perfumers ignore one thing,

129
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,290
and that's the feeling of comfort.

130
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,680
For example,

131
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,000
I like the scent of gardenia.

132
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,760
If a perfume

133
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,150
has gardenia,

134
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,570
I feel at ease.

135
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:33,530
So I want to add a scent you like

136
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,370
to double the effect.

137
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,860
Osmanthus.

138
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:40,580
Osmanthus.

139
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,790
If you ask where the autumn dew
in the fragrant woods comes from,

140
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:52,010
it comes from the depths of
the Moon Palace.

141
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,950
If you talk about the rose on the sea,

142
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:56,480
but how it compares to
the grace of osmanthus.

143
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,580
Osmanthus is both medicine and food.

144
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,740
Adding it to the benzoin incense

145
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,590
is the finishing touch.

146
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,290
This can’t be touched yet.

147
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,280
It must be dried in the shade
for half a day.

148
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,880
You can't touch it until it's shaped.
