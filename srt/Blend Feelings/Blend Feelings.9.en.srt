[BLEND FEELINGS]
[Episode 9]

2
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:58,970
Jingshi, you're here.

3
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,660
Uncle Jingshi.

4
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,440
What did the doctor say?

5
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,900
Dad was fine this morning.

6
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,770
He suddenly felt dizzy after lunch.

7
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,700
The doctor said it's a mild stroke.

8
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,400
Since it's nothing serious,

9
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,560
I'll be heading out.

10
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:27,870
Do you even see me as your father anymore?

11
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,039
Dad, calm down.

12
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,759
Set up a meeting next week

13
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,450
with Miss Ma Qingqing,
the third daughter from Kangmin Pharma.

14
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:45,820
Not interested.

15
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:47,820
Kangmin Pharma can fill

16
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,660
the gap in our group's business.

17
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,780
A marriage alliance
would benefit us greatly.

18
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,830
Chairman Gu, I'll take my leave now.

19
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,030
Let me introduce you.

20
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,710
This is my girlfriend, Jian Xiangxiang.

21
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,680
So sudden?

22
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,520
Using me as a shield?

23
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,130
Is he telling the truth?

24
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,050
Then I'll go along with it.

25
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,760
Yes, we're dating.

26
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,450
Dad,

27
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,630
haven't you always wanted Jingshi

28
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,310
to find a girlfriend?

29
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,740
Now that he has,

30
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,170
why don't you believe it?

31
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,820
Don't scare Miss Jian.

32
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:55,510
Jingshi and Miss Jian
look perfect together.

33
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:58,130
Dad, please give them your blessing.

34
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,970
Miss Jian, where do you work?

35
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,320
I'm an assistant to Mr. Gao.

36
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,040
Does our company have such a position?

37
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,500
Xiangxiang is a perfumer.

38
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:10,110
She developed
the Glittering Stars & the Moon

39
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,910
Miss Jian, what does your family do?

40
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,079
My family makes traditional scent.

41
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,910
Miss Jian might become
your third aunt in the future.

42
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:25,230
Third Aunt? I like this title.

43
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,640
Mom, don't be fooled by her.

44
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,950
This woman is actually my...

45
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,350
Xiangxiang went to the same college
as you.

46
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,280
I know exactly what kind of relationship
you two have.

47
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:45,490
Then Miss Jian really is fated
to be part of our family.

48
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,000
There's still work at the office.

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,120
We'll get going.

50
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,380
You little rascal.

51
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:00,180
Every time I want him to keep me company,
he gets so impatient.

52
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,800
Don't be upset, Dad.

53
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,270
The company keeps him busy.

54
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,570
Jingshi's under pressure.

55
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,370
I'll be here to keep you company.

56
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:11,760
Dad,

57
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:12,830
get some rest.

58
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,690
Goodbye, Grandpa.

59
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:24,960
Hurry up.

60
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,160
What is it, Mom?

61
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,450
Your Uncle Jingshi has a girlfriend now.

62
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:32,650
Your chance has come.

63
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:34,650
What chance?

64
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,240
You need to get close to Ma Qingqing.

65
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:38,870
Why?

66
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,480
Isn't your grandpa eager to form an alliance
with Kangmin Pharma through marriage?

67
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,360
If you win her over,

68
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,360
what does that mean?

69
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,840
It means I'd have a higher place
in Grandpa's heart

70
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,400
and more power in the company.

71
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,600
Exactly.

72
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,580
Come on. Mom, I know Ma Qingqing.

73
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:01,450
She's...

74
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,710
really not my type.

75
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,800
Once you're with her,

76
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,040
you can have as many girlfriends
as you want on the side.

77
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,360
Don't think I don't know

78
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,020
about you and that secretary.

79
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:15,210
It's fine if you're just playing around,

80
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,650
but if you want her to marry into
the Gu family, forget it.

81
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,080
Mom,

82
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,220
I know what I'm doing.

83
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:21,950
Don't worry.

84
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,710
I've already checked.

85
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:29,440
Tomorrow, Ma Qingqing will be playing golf
at the golf course in the western suburbs.

86
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,280
Don't worry.

87
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,800
Wait for me, Mom.

88
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,920
[Contract Couple Agreement]

89
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:42,980
Contract couple?

90
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,240
As you've seen,

91
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,720
my father keeps setting me up
on blind dates.

92
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,400
I need a way

93
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,120
to keep him quiet for a while.

94
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:52,420
And your intentions are pretty clear.

95
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:53,950
What intentions?

96
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,210
I don't have any intentions.

97
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,130
Two years.

98
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,350
The price is up to you.

99
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,550
I get it.

100
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,120
He must have feelings for me

101
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,400
but is too shy to say it,

102
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,680
so he's using this contract as an excuse.

103
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,940
Fine, a contract it is.

104
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,470
It gets me one step closer
to my goal anyway.

105
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,490
If you have any concerns, just say it.

106
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,090
Since you made the offer,

107
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,480
don't blame me for asking for more.

108
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:18,050
If you want me
to be your contract girlfriend,

109
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,250
it's not impossible.

110
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,200
However,

111
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,180
you have to live with me.

112
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,290
Don't push your luck.

113
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,530
I'm not.

114
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,340
We need to make it convincing.

115
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,950
If you're not willing,

116
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:45,170
then I'll leave.

117
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:46,930
Sign it.

118
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:02,460
Go pack your things.

119
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,600
I didn't expect it to go so smoothly.

120
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,000
I'm actually moving in
with Gu Jingshi now.

121
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:20,950
Thanks.

122
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,220
What are you doing?

123
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:28,900
What's this?

124
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:29,790
Grandma's pajamas?

125
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,650
They're pure cotton
and really comfortable, okay?

126
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,460
Jian Xiangxiang,
you two are just a contract couple.

127
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,990
Sooner or later, it'll end.

128
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,600
So you need to take advantage of this time

129
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,440
and make the most
of your girlfriend status

130
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,280
to stir things up

131
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,200
at the company

132
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,090
and take down that scumbag,

133
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:46,030
so you can escape your fate
of being sent to a mental hospital.

134
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,110
I will. Besides,

135
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,900
I've got you as my silly—

136
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,440
I mean, strategic advisor, right?

137
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,360
So tell me what to do.

138
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,600
I'll listen to you, okay?

139
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,560
First...

140
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,360
You need a bottle of wine.

141
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:01,130
Why?

142
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,960
Alcohol gives courage, okay?

143
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,120
Pack it up.

144
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,190
Second,

145
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,130
you need a set of sexy pajamas.

146
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,750
I've already got them ready.

147
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,470
Let me pack it for you.

148
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,799
Chairman Gu, which floor is your room on?

149
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,460
I'll move my luggage in first.

150
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:39,850
I had Ms. Liu prepare a guest room.

151
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,179
That won't do.

152
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,810
What do you mean?

153
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,760
I mean if we're putting on an act,
we should make it convincing.

154
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,400
Couples don't sleep in separate rooms.

155
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,460
If others see it, won't we be exposed?

156
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:04,900
Fine.

157
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,840
But there's one thing:

158
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:10,330
the bedroom on the third floor
is off limits.

159
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:12,660
Don't worry.

160
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:13,770
We're a contract couple;

161
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:14,990
we should respect each other's privacy.

162
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:15,830
I get that.

163
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,200
I'll go then.

164
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,400
Alcohol gives courage.
I'm counting on you.

165
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,670
Chairman Gu, come have some food.

166
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,350
No need.

167
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,870
Today is our first day living together.

168
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,200
It's quite meaningful.

169
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,130
Although it's all takeout,

170
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:53,350
please do me the honor of joining me.

171
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:21,700
Chairman Gu,

172
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,480
the first toast is to thank you
for letting me join Yaoge Group

173
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,230
and giving me the chance to develop
the Glittering Stars & the Moon.

174
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,850
The second toast is to thank you

175
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,110
for helping me out
when Gu Jiacheng caused trouble.

176
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:32,610
The third toast
is to a happy life living together.

177
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:55,430
Chairman Gu...

178
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,170
wait a moment.

179
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,960
[Gao Yi]

180
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:28,900
What is it?

181
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,450
Boss, as we expected,
Li Fang couldn't wait any longer

182
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,200
and had Gu Jiacheng contact Ma Qingqing.

183
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,400
It's as expected.

184
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,460
Your plan is really brilliant.

185
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:37,530
But Boss,

186
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,950
why did you offer yourself as bait?

187
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,010
Only by luring the snake out

188
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,730
can we catch them all at once.

189
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,300
You're overthinking.

190
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,110
Luring the snake out?

191
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,450
Catch them all at once?

192
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:28,470
Do you have many enemies around you?

193
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,320
Yeah.

194
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,820
So it's dangerous to be around me.

195
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,970
If you want to back out of the deal,
now's your chance.

196
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,480
Don't worry,

197
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,130
I'll definitely protect you well.

198
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,500
Did you hear me?

199
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,160
Say something.

200
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:51,160
Say something.

201
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:51,960
You? Protect me?
