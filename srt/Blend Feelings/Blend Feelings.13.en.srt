2
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,230
-Hello.
-Director Gu.

3
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,920
Everything you asked for
has been taken care of.

4
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:49,810
Good. The money will be in your account
within an hour.

5
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:51,620
Thank you, Director Gu.

6
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,690
Make sure Jian Xiangxiang suffers a bit.

7
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,240
Don't worry, leave it to me.

8
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:00,730
I'll definitely
teach her a lesson for you.

9
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,009
Boss,

10
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:44,990
we've caught him red-handed this time.

11
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:47,450
Director Gu won't be able to
get away with it.

12
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,479
According to the tracker you planted

13
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:55,080
in Miss Jian's hair tie,

14
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,020
this place on Yunniu East Road
is a private nursing home.

15
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,220
There are a lot of mentally ill patients
locked up inside.

16
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,280
I don't know

17
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,040
the exact scent on your mother,

18
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,820
but based on what you described
—cotton and a hint of soap—

19
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,060
I made this perfume.

20
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,800
I named it Mother's Love.

21
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,920
I hope that when you smell it,

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,360
you'll feel a little less sadness

23
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,560
and a little more joy.

24
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,850
After all, your smile is really beautiful.

25
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,680
Mom, your wontons
are the best in the world.

26
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,240
You're always such a flatterer.

27
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:10,010
Don't worry, I'll protect you well.

28
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,200
Chairman Gu.

29
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,340
Happy birthday.

30
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,950
You're my girlfriend now.

31
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,220
We should at least
make the act believable.

32
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,200
Gao Yi, book the flight tickets.

33
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,630
Boss, the person behind this
hasn't shown up yet.

34
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,550
Shouldn't we wait a bit longer?

35
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,130
I said book the tickets.

36
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:04,820
[Ren'ai Psychiatric Care Center]

37
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:30,350
Time for your meds.

38
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,080
I'm not sick.

39
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,240
I'm not taking them.

40
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:33,640
Take them.

41
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,480
No.

42
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:37,030
No? Then prepare for electroshock.

43
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,720
Electroshock?

44
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,460
I'm not sick at all.

45
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:41,950
It's illegal.

46
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,010
Take the meds,

47
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,070
or get electroshocked.

48
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:45,990
Your choice.

49
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,010
Well...

50
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,450
I'll be good and take the meds.

51
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:54,360
Could you please untie me?

52
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,770
Look, you have so many doors here,

53
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,750
and so many staff members.

54
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,640
I couldn't escape
even if I wanted to, right?

55
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:16,630
Open it wider.

56
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,600
Stay put and don't run around.

57
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,680
Be good.

58
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,220
Be good.

59
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,640
Look at my baby, look!

60
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,760
My baby.

61
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,720
My baby.

62
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,680
Is my daughter pretty?

63
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,760
Is she cute?

64
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,100
Look.

65
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,630
Look. Look at my baby. Look.

66
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,200
Are you new here?

67
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,400
I'm a monkey head mushroom.

68
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,960
Are you an enoki mushroom?

69
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,570
Yes, yes, yes, I'm an enoki mushroom.

70
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,560
Where's my doll?

71
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,480
Where's my doll?

72
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,640
-What doll?
-Give me back my doll!

73
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,600
-Let go of me!
-If you don't, I'll kill you!

74
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,600
Where's my doll?

75
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,340
It's over there.

76
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:29,960
Do you see it?

77
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,810
What are you doing?

78
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:32,930
Let go! This is my baby!

79
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:36,730
If I wasn't short on money,

80
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,260
why would I be working here?

81
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:40,360
Dealing with a bunch of crazy people
every day

82
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,720
is driving me nuts.

83
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,700
Hurry up and find me a good job.

84
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,560
Ma'am,

85
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,060
I can help you find a job.

86
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,620
You just need to lend me your phone.

87
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:57,950
You're new here, right?

88
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:58,900
Trying to trick me

89
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,980
and steal my phone?

90
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,040
Do you know Yaoge Group?

91
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,300
If you help me make a call,

92
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,330
I'll get you a job there.

93
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:09,870
What's the number?

94
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:11,570
176...

95
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,840
He hung up?

96
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,900
Try again.

97
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:31,730
I'm not calling anymore.

98
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,760
I must have been out of my mind
to believe you.

99
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,240
No, you have to get through to him today.

100
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,580
Let go of me, or I'll call the doctor.

101
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:38,570
No, no,

102
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,280
don't call the doctor.

103
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,400
I'm being good.

104
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,659
Where is everyone?

105
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:28,840
Is anybody here?

106
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,120
Is anybody here?

107
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:36,850
Is anybody here?

108
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,320
Where's my doll?

109
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,170
Give me back my doll!

110
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:15,900
Monkey head mushroom,

111
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,420
the doll is here.

112
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,740
Give me back my doll right now!

113
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,870
Fire!

114
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,620
Fire!

115
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,640
My baby!

116
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,930
-Fire! Fire!
-Have you seen my baby?

117
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:05,770
My baby!

118
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,740
There are patients causing trouble inside.

119
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,200
You should go check it out.

120
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,750
Did you see someone
in a doctor's coat leave?

121
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,320
She just went out.

122
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:51,790
Go after her!

123
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,050
Don't let her get away!

124
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,810
You guys go that way!

125
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:00,940
You guys go that way!

126
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,560
Stop!

127
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,560
Stop!

128
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:09,950
Stop!

129
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,320
Stop!

130
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,720
Stop! Stop right there!

131
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,540
Jian Xiangxiang, you can do it.

132
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,810
You can get away!

133
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,110
Hurry! Hurry!

134
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:24,170
Stop!

135
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:25,490
Stop!

136
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,050
Stop!

137
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:35,440
She's running out of strength.

138
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,720
Hurry, hurry!

139
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:41,270
Stop!

140
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,720
Stop!

141
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,030
Stop chasing.

142
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:05,280
She won't get away.
