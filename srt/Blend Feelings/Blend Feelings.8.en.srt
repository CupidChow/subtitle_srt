[[BLEND FEELINGS: Episode 8]

2
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,610
Chairman Gu, what brings you here?

3
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,270
Why are you back ahead of time?

4
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,680
This job didn't really need
half a month at all,

5
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,480
so I finished the inspection
within just five days.

6
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,320
I thought if I stayed any longer,

7
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,940
it would just waste our company's money,

8
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,470
so I came back ahead of time.

9
00:01:15,289 --> 00:01:16,090
Chairman Gu.

10
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,810
Why are you here
to see me so late at night?

11
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,890
I'm just passing by.

12
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,030
You're just passing by again, huh?

13
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:29,380
Oh, by the way, Chairman Gu,

14
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,320
I brought you something.

15
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:41,420
What's going on?

16
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,860
He's here to see me
in the middle of the night

17
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,789
just for this...

18
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,990
How... How many chillies did you eat?

19
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:10,650
I...

20
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,340
I just ate extra-spicy
and extra-numbing food.

21
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,140
Water.

22
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,320
Oh! W-Water!

23
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,490
I-I-I'm sorry.

24
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,520
Chairman Gu, I've forgotten that

25
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,560
there's a rule in the 89 prohibitions

26
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,760
that you can't eat chillies. Right?

27
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,079
Well, I didn't know

28
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,880
that you would actually kiss me.

29
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,270
Why are you here
to see me so late at night?

30
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,480
Do you have something to tell me?

31
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,200
Keep your doors and windows closed.

32
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,060
Go to bed early.

33
00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:54,930
Alright. I got it.

34
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:59,030
Boss, this mysterious person
was extremely cunning.

35
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,480
Our men split into two groups
to chase him.

36
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,210
But he still managed to escape.

37
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:04,930
Boss.

38
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,270
Actually, when we gave up
besieging the house,

39
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,070
we already missed our chance to catch him.

40
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,420
Are you questioning my decision?

41
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:18,770
No, I just feel it's such a pity for you.

42
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,100
He finally showed up.

43
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,280
Now that we've missed this opportunity,

44
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,960
I don't know when we'll be able
to catch him in the act.

45
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,220
Stop talking about it.

46
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:27,410
Go back.

47
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,970
The product I've developed
is called Glittering Stars & the Moon.

48
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,810
It has a fresh and clean aldehyde scent
of soap,

49
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,970
which is as pure as bright moonlight.

50
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,079
With the coolness of patchouli,

51
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,400
it's like a cool breeze in the night.

52
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,590
And the agarwood

53
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,370
adds a mysterious essence to it.

54
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,300
So the overall tone of this perfume

55
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,940
is like a classical Chinese lady
from the water towns of Jiangnan,

56
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,630
looking beautiful and elegant.

57
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,950
It really has a classical charm.

58
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,660
It gives me the feeling
of a lady from a prominent family.

59
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,690
Did you also add cardamom
and honeysuckle to it?

60
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,490
The scent has greater depth now.

61
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,940
Chairman Gu,
regarding the quality of this perfume,

62
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,720
I can guarantee

63
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,700
there's absolutely no match
for it in the market.

64
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,500
Well done.

65
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:23,850
Xiangxiang, you're really amazing.

66
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,040
Chairman Gu,
where did you find such an elite?

67
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,900
You really have a discerning eye.

68
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:33,650
Chairman Gu.

69
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,360
Under Director Gu's request, this was made

70
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,440
by the renowned Singaporean perfumer,
Shen Yifei.

71
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,190
It's called Attachment.

72
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,909
Shen Yifei
doesn't create fragrances easily anymore.

73
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:47,710
I used my personal connections.

74
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,420
Only then did he do this favor.

75
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,050
Why are you laughing?

76
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,870
If Director Gu
had paid over 10,000 yuan to Shen Yifei

77
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,330
to create this fragrance,

78
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,400
that would be totally not worth it.

79
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,330
What do you mean?

80
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,610
This fragrance called Attachment

81
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,280
has plagiarized
at least three different perfume formulas,

82
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,520
including Innate from Japan,

83
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,200
1874 from Britain

84
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,450
and The Nun from Norway.

85
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:26,320
Now that you've mentioned it,

86
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,930
I can actually detect The Nun's scent.

87
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,220
But it's such a niche product.

88
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,350
Not many people in China know about it.

89
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,440
Jian Xiangxiang, you're talking nonsense!

90
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,300
Master Shen
would never plagiarize others' works.

91
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,480
I've already stated
my professional assessment.

92
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,480
Director Gu, if you insist on
launching this product,

93
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,960
and it damages Yaoge Group's reputation,

94
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,830
are you willing to
take full responsibility?

95
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,220
Go to the R&D Lab
to figure out the formula and the ratios.

96
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,610
If it truly overlaps
with these three fragrances,

97
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:52,420
destroy it immediately.

98
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,480
Okay, Chairman Gu.

99
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:54,450
Dismiss.

100
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,540
Chairman Gu.

101
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,630
Please wait a moment.

102
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:14,500
Chairman Gu.

103
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:17,560
I'd like to further optimize the formula
for Glittering Stars & the Moon.

104
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,200
And I need a Benzoin fragrance.

105
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,520
But this fragrance is possessed
by the collector, Li Nanguang.

106
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,510
I'd like to get his contact information

107
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,770
so that I can visit him.

108
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,430
Let me solve this problem.

109
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:28,860
Thank you, Chairman Gu.

110
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,010
Is there anything else?

111
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:43,460
I'd like to ask what you meant yesterday.

112
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,180
Yesterday?

113
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,040
What happened yesterday

114
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,720
was just a misunderstanding.

115
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,280
What?

116
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,280
A misunderstanding?

117
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,410
You kissed me for so long,
and it was a misunderstanding?

118
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,110
What's going on?
Are you trying to seduce my Uncle Jingshi?

119
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,640
It's none of your business.

120
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,120
Jian Xiangxiang.

121
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,850
I advise you
to give up as soon as possible.

122
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,480
Uncle Jingshi

123
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,210
has a crush on this ideal woman.

124
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,940
She's a famous cellist.

125
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,120
Compared with her,

126
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,640
you're worthless.

127
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,880
No wonder it's so hard to win him over.

128
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,990
It turns out that he has unrequited love
for an ideal woman.

129
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:44,120
At least, this scumbag
told me some useful information.

130
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,960
That's right.
I just want to pursue your Uncle Jingshi.

131
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,650
Regarding Chairman Gu,

132
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:50,080
whether it's about his appearance,
ability or physique,

133
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,060
compared with him,

134
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,860
you're the one who's worthless.

135
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,490
Let me tell you.

136
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,550
Just wait to face the humiliation.

137
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:27,180
I found it. The cellist, Lin Yu,

138
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,360
has won many awards
both domestically and internationally.

139
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,669
But she withdrew from the musical circle
three years ago.

140
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:35,400
Some people say
it was because of her hand injury,

141
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,679
while the others say
she has married into a wealthy family.

142
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,240
Anyway, her whereabouts remain a mystery.

143
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,030
Cello.

144
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:48,720
Cello.

145
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,200
Oh, right.

146
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,230
I remember you also learned
to play the cello when you were a kid.

147
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,570
Even Heaven is helping you.

148
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:57,700
Finally, there's something
that the boss might admire.

149
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:02,590
This is the first time
that I've seen him smile so tenderly.

150
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,730
I was wondering
why you still couldn't win over Gu Jingshi

151
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,530
with all your previous efforts.

152
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:12,010
It turns out that he has a crush
on this ideal woman.

153
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,220
For men,

154
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,110
are those unattainable ideal women
really irreplaceable?

155
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,650
Psychologically, there's an effect

156
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,310
called the Zeigarnik Effect,

157
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,670
which means that people tend to
more vividly remember

158
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,980
or be unable to forget things

159
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,210
that were suddenly interrupted

160
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:28,340
or left unfinished.

161
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,520
This effect

162
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,320
also applies to relationships.

163
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,660
In short,

164
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,040
what we can't get is the most precious.

165
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:38,570
Then what should I do?

166
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,350
That's not difficult at all, is it?

167
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,620
Be a substitute. Then you'll succeed.

168
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:52,320
No. Being a substitute is usually painful
both physically and emotionally.

169
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,530
No risk, no gain.

170
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,220
What if the boss is attracted?

171
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,720
I know how to win over Gu Jingshi now.

172
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,520
How?

173
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:04,290
Have you heard of being a substitute?

174
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,920
Gu Jingshi
eats at this restaurant every Friday.

175
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,850
He sits in this spot every time.

176
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,920
So?

177
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,490
So this is my perfect opportunity
to make a good impression.

178
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,220
He must be captivated by me.

179
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,720
How dare you show off such amateur skills?

180
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:26,730
I'm supposed to play along,
but I'm just ignoring it.

181
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,350
He's leaving.

182
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:29,140
Chase him!

183
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:31,200
You're about to succeed!

184
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,000
Chairman Gu!

185
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,400
I want to explain what just happened.

186
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,390
It was not like what you thought.

187
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,920
Jian Xiangxiang.

188
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,840
You've really amazed me this time.

189
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,960
You put on such a good show
in front of me.

190
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,360
It looks like

191
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,730
you know a lot about my past.

192
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,150
I don't know that much.

193
00:12:58,690 --> 00:12:59,800
Just...

194
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,780
a... a little bit.

195
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,280
What?

196
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,640
You want to be my woman?

197
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,170
Do you know what I hate the most?

198
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,600
Don't play tricks in front of me.

199
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,760
And don't try to imitate her.

200
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,880
Jingshi, Dad has fainted. Come back now.

201
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,440
I'll come back at once.

202
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:42,330
Chairman Gu.

203
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,850
Where are you going?
Let me take you there.

204
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:44,960
Let's go.
