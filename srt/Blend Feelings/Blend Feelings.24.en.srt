[BLEND FEELINGS: Episode 24]

2
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,580
Come to Xingcheng Warehouse in one hour.

3
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,160
If you call the police,
prepare to collect her corpse.

4
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:57,500
This is the Inpatient Department.

5
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,370
This is Gu Jingshi.

6
00:00:58,370 --> 00:00:59,500
Where is Gu Shenshi?

7
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:01,430
Chairman Gu,
we were just about to report this to you.

8
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:02,690
Gu Shenshi is missing.

9
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:21,050
It's been a long time since we last met.

10
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:22,770
My dear brother.

11
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,870
My dear brother.

12
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,830
I've lost everything now.

13
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,210
What's there for me to be afraid of?

14
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,979
Since you've pretended to be lame
for so many years,

15
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:57,039
then I'll just let you stay seated
for as long as you can.

16
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:06,590
Are you okay?

17
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,040
I'm fine.

18
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,560
So you're awake?

19
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,280
It's you.

20
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,030
The good show is about to begin!

21
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,880
Don't move.

22
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,160
This place is filled with explosives.

23
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,350
There are countless laser beams
throughout this space.

24
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,220
However,

25
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,370
you guys can't see them.

26
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,770
If you touch any one of them...

27
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,530
Let's play a game.

28
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,700
The rules are quite simple.

29
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,290
Whichever of you kills the other

30
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,660
will be able to leave here alive.

31
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,870
One of you will stay alive,
while the other will die.

32
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,780
The game begins now!

33
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,920
Gu Jingshi.

34
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,770
If you're killed by your own woman,

35
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,500
your death will be worthwhile.

36
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,030
Don't hate me.

37
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,600
Jingshi.

38
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,480
You...

39
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,440
No matter what the situation is,

40
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,320
I'll never let you be in danger.

41
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:50,920
But...

42
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:51,620
Let go.

43
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,010
Since you gave up the chance
I had given to you,

44
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,410
then just die together.

45
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,240
Good luck to you both!

46
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,760
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

47
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,280
What should we do now?

48
00:06:35,409 --> 00:06:35,930
You...

49
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,990
I have no choice but to give it a try.

50
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,490
Jingshi!

51
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:43,420
This is too dangerous.

52
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,480
I won't let you go.

53
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:46,640
If we stay here,

54
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,680
we'll both die.

55
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,250
We'll have a chance if we give it a try.

56
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,040
But...

57
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,870
I'll get you out of here alive.

58
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:37,470
Wait!

59
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,690
T-The last laser beam seems to be...

60
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:54,110
I-It seems to be from the upper right
to the lower left at a 45-degree angle.

61
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:57,470
So... So you should step forward
with the left foot first.

62
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,020
That should be it.

63
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,660
[Chairman Gu]

64
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,560
If I were you,

65
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:22,650
I wouldn't have set up a trap
with such an obvious flaw.

66
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,030
That's impossible.

67
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,700
That's impossible.
How could this be possible?

68
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,850
I've already called the police.

69
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,640
Gao Yi told me

70
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,700
you were the real owner of Qingcheng.

71
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,150
Grandpa told me

72
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,690
you visited him
at the nursing home every week.

73
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,240
Wang told me

74
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,760
you used my name and your mother's name

75
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,420
to establish
the Hanxiang Charity Foundation.

76
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,190
Gu Jingshi.

77
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:52,170
Can you tell me

78
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:56,610
whether you'll still

79
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,810
keep things from me in the future?

80
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,060
Would you give me another chance?

81
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:21,720
I'll give you one minute
to confess your love.

82
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,460
59.

83
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,560
58.

84
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,300
57.

85
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,630
Gu Jingshi, you're such a rascal.

86
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,490
This is the confession of my love.

87
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,040
My couple
is finally displaying the affection.

88
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,690
It's so touching.

89
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,060
Oh? You guys are still here.

90
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,380
Hehe, we've been peeking at the screen

91
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,730
and enjoying all your lovey-dovey moments.

92
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:32,670
We've finally seen your happy ending.

93
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,790
Now we can leave with satisfaction

94
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,480
and move on to the next story.

95
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,250
How did I fall asleep while writing it?

96
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,030
Jian Xiangxiang said while being kissed,

97
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,440
"Gu Jingshi, you're such a rascal."

98
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,560
This is the confession of my love.

99
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,890
Jian Xiangxiang, I'll stick with you
for the rest of my life.

100
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,910
Don't even think about getting rid of me.

101
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,880
This kiss lasted for a long time

102
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,810
until they had to stand apart
to catch their breath.

103
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:11,880
When they opened their eyes...

104
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,560
Chairman Gu.

105
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,680
Have you finished your novel?

106
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,780
I've almost finished it.
