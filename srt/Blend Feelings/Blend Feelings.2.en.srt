[BLEND FEELINGS Episode 2]

2
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,760
What's going on with you?

3
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:46,950
Guys, I'm ending the stream now.

4
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,210
I'll talk to you later.

5
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:50,560
What happened to you?

6
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,020
Gu Jiacheng cheated on me.

7
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,640
He betrayed me

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,540
and stole my perfume formula.

9
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:56,760
That jerk dared to cheat on you?

10
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,800
I'll beat him up.

11
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,860
With your physique?
You'd just get yourself killed.

12
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,920
Give me two weeks.

13
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,160
Once I build up my biceps,

14
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,480
I'll rip him to pieces.

15
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,720
Come on.

16
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,060
Got any alcohol? Let's drink.

17
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:17,760
Here.

18
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,039
Drowning heartbreak in alcohol.

19
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:30,840
Women like this are so pathetic.

20
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,860
Drink up.
You're about to have a bloody disaster.

21
00:01:34,289 --> 00:01:35,759
It's bad for your heart and your health.

22
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,400
Who could be more miserable than you?

23
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,850
How could I possibly
have a bloody disaster?

24
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,130
Is a rock going to fall from the ceiling?

25
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,120
What's wrong?

26
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,479
You even hurt yourself opening a can.

27
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,280
Give it to me.

28
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,110
Hey, Wang.

29
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:53,830
Do you believe me?

30
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,000
Yes.

31
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,600
No matter what I say, you'll believe me.

32
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,900
You won't think I'm crazy, will you?

33
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,830
What exactly do you want to tell me?

34
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,960
I can see predictive bullet comments.

35
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,699
It's true. The comments warned
I'd get hit by a car,

36
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:12,010
and I almost did.

37
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,620
And they also said
I'd have a bloody disaster today.

38
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,420
Look,

39
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,700
a bloody disaster.

40
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:17,829
That tiny cut?

41
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,520
It'll heal on its own
if you don't bandage it soon.

42
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,920
You call that a bloody disaster?

43
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,800
I've told you before,

44
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,500
stop reading
those online novels and dramas.

45
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,200
Even if you do,

46
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,300
at least turn off the bullet comments.

47
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,900
I'm not joking.

48
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:27,720
The comments said

49
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,770
Gu Jiacheng will send
me to a mental hospital.

50
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,170
A mental hospital!

51
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,450
When people are under extreme stress,

52
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,500
the brain can produce hallucinations.

53
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,700
Get some rest and you'll be fine.

54
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,770
Why don't you believe me either?

55
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,250
Then tell me.

56
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,079
Why is he treating you like this?

57
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:48,870
To get the Eight Methods of Fragrance.

58
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,820
Then why not get on your knees, beg,
and give him the book?

59
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,750
The problem is I've never
even seen this book myself.

60
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,110
So what are you planning to do?

61
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,530
I'll show you a way out.

62
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,010
Make that jerk Gu Jiacheng's Uncle Jingshi
fall in love with you,

63
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,290
and become his woman.

64
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:12,260
[Gu Jingshi: Mobile Internet is a gradual
reform, not a disruptive revolution]

65
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,079
It's him.

66
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,540
Isn't that Gu Jiacheng's third Uncle?

67
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,600
You know him?

68
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,650
He's the chairman of Yaoge Group.

69
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:36,850
Five years ago,

70
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,880
he multiplied the company’s
performance several times.

71
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,760
He has sharp vision

72
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,020
and ruthless tactics.

73
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,670
They say he’s extremely calculating.

74
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,530
When he first joined the company,

75
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,210
the company’s veterans didn’t respect him.

76
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,970
Now they've all listened to him.

77
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,860
So,

78
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,560
why should I end up with a bad ending?

79
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,300
Why should I be sent to a mental hospital?

80
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,400
I must change my fate.

81
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,710
I'll tear that jerk apart

82
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,620
and make him kneel and beg for mercy.

83
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,960
What are you mumbling about?

84
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,520
I said I want to be Gu Jingshi's woman

85
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,180
and Gu Jiacheng's third Aunt.

86
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,600
You don't even have a fever.

87
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,060
But you've lost your mind.

88
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:18,170
Fine.

89
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,820
You're my best friend.

90
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,519
I'll help you just this once.

91
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,130
Let me think of a way.

92
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,480
I spent a fortune to find out that

93
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,910
Gu Jingshi is now in room 3011.

94
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,880
Take your resume and portfolio
to go block his way.

95
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,140
Succeed or die trying.

96
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,330
Miss, are you okay?

97
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,090
Who are you calling "miss"?

98
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,350
Try falling like I did.

99
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,500
Help me up and
take me to the hospital now!

100
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,040
What's wrong with you?

101
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,880
I'm so sorry.

102
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,000
Slowly.

103
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,250
Please don't report me.

104
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,790
What took you so long?

105
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:08,430
Hurry!

106
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,510
What are you doing?

107
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:10,880
Why are you dressed so plainly?

108
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,430
Never mind.

109
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,010
We're out of time.

110
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:12,450
Hurry.

111
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,200
Wait.

112
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:13,880
Who are you?

113
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:14,920
-This is the room key.
-What?

114
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,150
This room. Quick!

115
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,440
I just go in by myself?

116
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,180
Yes.

117
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,230
Do your best.

118
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:25,980
Good luck!

119
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,600
Good luck.

120

Hello, Chairman Gu.

121
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,640
I'm here to apply for
the perfumer position.

122
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,860
My name is Jian Xiangxiang.

123
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,659
Here's my resume and portfolio.

124
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,600
Get out.

125
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,280
No, I can't give up like this.

126
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,200
Chairman Gu.

127
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,800
Your perfume is composed of
pink pepper, fir,

128
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,780
papyrus and sandalwood.

129
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,600
You...

130
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,580
Are you trying to play the victim,

131
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,370
or seduce me?

132
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:48,840
Let go of me.

133
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,420
I...

134
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,970
I don't know what you're talking about.

135
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,970
I just came to submit my resume.

136
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,120
Submit your resume?

137
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,090
You came here...

138
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,650
Isn't this what you wanted?

139
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:23,070
A misunderstanding. The person at the door
wasn't arranged by Wang.

140
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,470
Gu Jingshi has been drugged.

141
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:27,730
Come on, coward, go get him.
Make him take responsibility.

142
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:33,290
Don't miss this chance!
Don't let this prize slip away!

143
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,330
Calm down.

144
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,120
Shortcut or the right path,

145
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,260
think it through.

146
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:51,740
Please let me go.

147
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,820
Go get me a bottle of cold water.

148
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:42,380
You've been drugged.

149
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:45,030
Get out.

150
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,250
This is something I made myself.

151
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,440
It's called Zen's Dream.

152
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,900
It helps calm people down.

153

Chairman Gu, it was all him.

154
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,320
Zhang Yingjun told me to do this.

155
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,440
He said he drugged you

156
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,680
and told me to seduce you.

157
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,920
Then call the police afterward,

158
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,880
accuse you of rape

159
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,000
and ruin your reputation.

160
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,740
Chairman Gu, please don't
listen to her nonsense!

161
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,180
She’s slandering me!

163
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm telling you.

164
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,440
I’ve got chat records as proof.

165

I didn't take any money,

166
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:05,850
so don't try to make me the scapegoat.

Take a look at these documents

169
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,530
and calculate

how many years you’ll be sentenced to.

172
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,760
I was wrong.

173
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,000
I was really wrong.

build this company.
