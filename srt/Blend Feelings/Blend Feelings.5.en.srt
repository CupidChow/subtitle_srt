[BLEND FEELINGS]
[Episode 5]

2
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,990
Help!

3
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:34,550
Oh my God.

4
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,580
Who can tell me who this man is?

5
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:38,650
He's probably some kind of pervert.

6
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:42,310
Don't make a sound.

7
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,070
He's right outside.

8
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,520
Oh my god. Acid?

9
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,590
Does he have a grudge
against the little coward?

10
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,310
He was hired by Lin Shasha.

11
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,360
This woman is insane.

12
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,430
What are you doing?

13
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,770
Why are you running? Stop!

14
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,930
Chairman Gu!

15
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,960
Chairman Gu, open the door! Chairman Gu!

16
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,740
Chairman Gu, please open the door!

17
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:22,829
What is it?

18
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,250
Chairman Gu, help!

19
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,760
Someone wants to harm me!

20
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,790
Your acting
is getting more and more convincing.

21
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,270
Can you stop already?

22
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:33,570
I'm not acting.

23
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,680
This is real!

24
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,329
Someone really is after me!

25
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,010
Then please handle it yourself.

26
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:38,940
Don't come to me.

27
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:44,380
Chairman...

28
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,200
Chairman Gu! Chairman Gu!

29
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,930
Chairman Gu, open the door!

30
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:49,850
Chairman Gu!

31
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:51,890
Chairman Gu!

32
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,480
Find out

33
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,880
what happened to Jian Xiangxiang tonight.

34
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,740
I've already given you the formula.

35
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:19,500
Why do you still want to hurt me?

36
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,150
Why?

37
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,810
Just for tonight. Come in.

38
00:04:59,159 --> 00:04:59,960
Thank you.

39
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:08,920
Chairman Gu,

40
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,680
do you have a blanket?

41
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,840
I feel a bit cold.

42
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,900
You're having a fever.

43
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,200
I'm sorry.

44
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,120
I didn't mean to trouble you.

45
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:26,660
Lie down on the sofa.

46
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:29,740
Thank you.

47
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,240
Why do I feel so dizzy?

48
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:46,840
My throat hurts too.

49
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,670
This hand is so cold.

50
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,520
That feels nice.

51
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,480
Time to take your medicine.

52
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,520
Come on, get up.

53
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,940
I won't accept a bad ending.

54
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,220
What?

55
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,840
I'm not afraid of you.

56
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:33,360
I'm not afraid of you.

57
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:34,870
Once I win over

58
00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:36,930
Gu Jingshi,

59
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:39,180
I'll make you all pay.

60
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,880
You?

61
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:15,620
Oh my God.

62
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,800
The boss took care of me last night.

63
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,760
I didn't expect him to be cold
on the outside but warm on the inside—

64
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,220
he's actually quite nice.

65
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,240
You useless thing!

66
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,480
-I…
-What?

67
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,440
That was such a good chance.

68
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,030
You could've had breakfast together and built some chemistry.
Why did you run off?

69
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:17,520
But I...

70
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,280
With a hopeless bestie like you,

71
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,080
I really need some peace and quiet.
I'm hanging up.

72
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,340
Gu Jiacheng, what are you doing?

73
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,070
What are you doing? Let go of me!

74
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,720
Jian Xiangxiang,

75
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,880
who told you to come work at Yaoge?

76
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,070
Resign immediately.

77
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,040
I'm not leaving.

78
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,740
Jian Xiangxiang,

79
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,290
you came to Yaoge

80
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,330
just to spite Jiacheng, didn't you?

81
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,270
Jian Xiangxiang,
I'm warning you, don't cause trouble.

82
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:42,520
I got this job fair and square.

83
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,080
What trouble am I causing?

84
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,040
Haven't seen you in a few days

85
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,220
and your tongue's gotten sharper, huh?

86
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,440
We've already broken up.

87
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,260
What gives you the right

88
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,590
to interfere in my life?

89
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,850
What gives me the right?

90
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,480
I'm the young boss of this company.

91
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,040
Well, sorry.

92
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,000
I was hired by Chairman Gu.

93
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,600
If you want to fire me,

94
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,330
you'll have to tell him to do it.

95
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,480
Don't think just because
you work for Uncle Jingshi,

96
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,380
I can't do anything to you.

97
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,030
Jian Xiangxiang, I'm telling you—

98
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,430
if I wanted you dead,

99
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:14,520
I've got ten thousand ways to do it.

100
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,310
Oh, I know.

101
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,760
The method you two used

102
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,960
was nothing but a low-life trick—

103
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,090
throwing acid at me.

104
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:22,420
Gu Jiacheng, Lin Shasha,
you're despicable!

105
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,370
Throwing acid?

106
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,480
Do you have any proof?

107
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,280
If not,

108
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,490
we can sue you for defamation.

109
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:26,950
There are bullet...

110
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:27,590
Enough.

111
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,280
500,000.

112
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,150
I'll buy the Kunshan Jade.

113
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,090
We don't owe each other anything now.

114
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,040
Revenge is never too late.

115
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,860
Once I win over Gu Jingshi,

116
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,030
I'll deal with you.

117
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,440
Young Boss,

118
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,500
don't try to brush me off
with petty gains like this.

119
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,640
Got it?

120
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,240
Jian Xiangxiang,

121
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,350
I'm telling you,

122
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,920
you're worthless to me.

123
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,400
-You, and your love,
-Let go of me!

124
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,350
are cheap.

125
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,680
-Jiacheng!
-You and your love...

126
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,480
Let go of me!

127
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:06,670
Uncle Jingshi.

128
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:08,230
Chairman Gu.

129
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,310
Tell him

130
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:27,790
I won't accept any form
of apology or negotiation.

131
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:30,130
I'd rather see both sides burn

132
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,500
than give him a chance to fight back.

133
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,860
No wonder Gu Jiacheng is so afraid of him.

134
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,020
He's really fierce.

135
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,400
Both sides burn...

136
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:50,570
"Both sides burn?"

137
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,790
"Never give him a chance to fight back?"

138
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:53,740
Makes sense.
