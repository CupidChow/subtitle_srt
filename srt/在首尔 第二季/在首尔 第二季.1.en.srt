1
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:13,670
In this world, there are yokai, ayakashi,

2
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,670
spectres, demons,

3
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,680
mononoke, and ghosts.

4
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,730
Creatures with those names exist,
just like everything else.

5
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,130
There is reason that transcends reason,

6
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,190
and logical and illogical go hand in hand.

7
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:38,700
By the way, I got to witness the
wisdom of our lady the other day.

8
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,240
Amazing! You were in the
presence of our great lady!

9
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,570
Oh, how I envy you!
I hear that she is quite beautiful.

10
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:49,790
Indeed. Though she is human,

11
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:57,210
she offered her right eye and left leg
to become our Goddess of Wisdom.

12
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:00,840
She is beauty and elegance defined.

13
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,180
She eventually reached the age
of twenty, and has been solving

14
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,870
all sorts of conflicts among ayakashi,

15
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,730
and resolving problems
that occur with humans.

16
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:15,890
Just the other day, she solved a
problem that could've gone south

17
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,410
peacefully and without injuries.

18
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:23,080
According to the rumors I've heard,
our lady can be rather harsh.

19
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,370
On the other hand, yes, she can be harsh.

20
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:32,830
Those who defy our lady will be seen
through in an instant, and suffer pain.

21
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:36,550
One must admire her ruthlessness.

22
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:40,670
There are times when the humans
finding out about our existence

23
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,300
can prove to be inconvenient for us.

24
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:48,470
That is when she tells the humans that we
do not even exist, using a convincing lie,

25
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:51,270
to make sure we can stay hidden.

26
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:54,820
This cannot be achieved with average wit.

27
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,550
But I'm sure there are those
who don't find her amusing

28
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,270
and defy her.

29
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,460
And surely there are those who

30
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:05,910
would use violence or yokai
powers to try to harm our lady.

31
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,670
She may be the Goddess of Wisdom,
but if she is dainty and elegant,

32
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,410
Health Land

33
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:12,160
she may be easily killed.

34
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,450
Have no fear. Our lady has many allies.

35
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:19,800
It's also in those situations when
our lady's wisdom truly shines.

36
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,600
She will see through any insolent
fool who tries anything,

37
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:28,310
and before they know it, the fool has fallen
for her trap and is defeated instead.

38
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,700
But that doesn't change the fact
that she's in a dangerous position.

39
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,990
No need to worry.

40
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:37,400
In recent years, our lady has
found herself a boyfriend,

41
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,610
and he protects her without fail.

42
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:42,960
A boyfriend?!

43
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,430
But surely, he must be a human, as well.

44
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:50,740
Apparently, he looks like a normal human
to our lady and the rest of the humans,

45
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:54,580
but through our eyes, he could not
look any more cursed and unsightly.

46
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:58,630
He was with our lady the other day,
and he is still truly horrifying.

47
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,490
I believe his name is Sakuragawa Kuro,

48
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:05,510
and he became immortal because
he ate mermaid flesh!

49
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:08,780
Immortal, eh?
Then we can't let our guard down.

50
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,650
But wouldn't that make him
almost a monster?

51
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:16,040
Alas, he has consumed one other yokai.

52
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,480
This gave him another terrifying power.

53
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,440
Thankfully, he is obedient to our lady,

54
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,630
but if that creature goes berserk,
we would stand no chance,

55
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,950
even with a thousand of our best.

56
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,910
So he's more powerful than the rumors say.

57
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:35,960
What's the matter? Is there something
you wanted to discuss with her ladyship?

58
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,580
Yes.

59
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:42,350
It appears as though a troublesome monster
has wandered into the condo I am haunting.

60
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,370
Who knows? I may be strangled to death.

61
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,180
So, what do you think, Kuro-senpai?

62
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,770
Why don't we move?

63
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,740
And how did we get on this subject again?

64
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:04,360
I told you a ghost haunting
some condo had contacted me.

65
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:08,760
And you had previously mentioned that it
was becoming difficult to live here,

66
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,030
so you wanted to move.

67
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:14,040
Ah, yes. Ever since some neighbors decided

68
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,370
to spread rumors about
me bringing a little girl

69
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:19,580
to my apartment and doing lascivious deeds.

70
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,890
But why would anyone spread
such a vile rumor?!

71
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,170
It's because of you.

72
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,820
Because you keep coming over
to my place and causing a fuss.

73
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,160
Then all you need to do is
explain that I'm your girlfriend,

74
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,540
and I attend your university!

75
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,310
I'd rather not lie like that.

76
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,690
But that's not a lie! It's the truth!

77
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,690
And we are doing salacious things!

78
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:43,150
I actually wish you'd be
more forward in doing so!

79
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:46,880
Again, it's because you say these
things that these rumors spread.

80
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,430
So, what exactly did this ghost want?

81
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:55,740
The ghost who came to me is
the ghost bound to that area.

82
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,460
He mostly spends his time living
in room 3 on the fifth floor.

83
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,690
The human living there loves movies,

84
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:04,260
and the ghost enjoys watching them with him.

85
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,560
I mean, I'm sure ghosts
need entertainment, too.

86
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,300
And when they're in that
apartment late at night...

87
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:22,800
They hear what sounds like someone
slowly pounding a log onto the floor,

88
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,050
like, "thunk, thunk," from the room above.

89
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:33,970
I wouldn't say the sound is particularly loud,

90
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:36,670
but it has a bizarre heaviness
and steadiness to it,

91
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:39,670
and it doesn't sound as
though the resident above

92
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,920
is making that noise to
complain or to be malicious.

93
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,510
The sound itself doesn't last very long,

94
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:50,800
so the owner of this condo seemed
to generously ignore it.

95
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,530
But I immediately started to
get chills from that noise,

96
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,530
so I just had an awful feeling.

97
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:01,970
The condo's owner also started to feel
as though the noises grew more frequent

98
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,440
and became creeped out by it,

99
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,250
so he asked the manager to give
the resident above a warning.

100
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,730
But then the manager said...

101
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:13,490
that the apartment directly above has
been vacant for over two months.

102
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,230
Oh, how terrifying!

103
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,670
Now, calm down.

104
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,180
It could just be that the building materials

105
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:22,210
started settling due to changes in
the weather, and so made that noise.

106
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,630
That happens all the time.

107
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:27,070
But then it would just be some
small noise, like a crack.

108
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:29,220
It wouldn't be a heavy, continuous "thud."

109
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,710
But that's not the only thing!

110
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:34,970
The manager grew concerned and
checked out the room directly above.

111
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:39,180
And within this empty room with
no furniture or curtains...

112
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,890
An old doll that hadn't been there
before happened to be on the floor.

113
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:51,770
This doll was very creepy, and it was
clearly emitting a suspicious aura,

114
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:54,530
so he couldn't even get closer to it.

115
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:56,220
Oh, how scary!

116
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,710
Dolls are creepy.

117
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,850
Especially older ones that easily
become cursed or filled with desire.

118
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:05,790
The manager couldn't bring himself to touch
it, so he just shut the door and ran away.

119
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,790
That doll can't be normal.

120
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:12,600
A proper ghost or monster would
show themselves in the room,

121
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,520
and would come to properly greet me.

122
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,800
Instead, they just keep making
that sound, as if to threaten me,

123
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,260
and remain hidden.

124
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,120
What could they be plotting?

125
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,990
They might just be slowly spreading
a curse across the whole building.

126
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:32,130
If it's just an item meant to spread a curse,
we won't be able to reason with it.

127
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,940
It would be troublesome to deal with.

128
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,630
The manager said he would talk to
the owner to get it checked out

129
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,920
or possibly have the room exorcised,

130
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,960
but there are still nights
when we hear the noise.

131
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,920
And the owner of the condo
can't move away easily,

132
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,710
so he's getting anxious.

133
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:50,070
I'm a ghost bound to this land,
so I can't leave this place.

134
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:52,670
And I'm too scared to go upstairs.

135
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,670
Please, my lady.

136
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:59,050
Could you go upstairs to
find out what lurks above

137
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,720
and help us resolve this matter peacefully?

138
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:06,040
Hm... So the problem is this doll.

139
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,900
We'll have to find out about
its past inhabitant, too.

140
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,770
And there you have it!

141
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:15,180
So that I can fully
investigate that apartment,

142
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,600
let's go ahead and move there ourselves!

143
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,730
It's not that far from our school,
so I think it'd be perfect for you.

144
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,210
You don't think it's odd that
a ghost or a monster is scared

145
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:25,790
of some mysterious sound?

146
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:29,790
Those are things most humans
fear as supernatural phenomena.

147
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:33,470
Even among monsters, dealing with
another that is unpredictable

148
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,550
and unable to reason is frightening.

149
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,400
You know, even among humans,

150
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:41,310
squabbles between neighbors over
simple noise can lead to murder.

151
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:43,620
Squabbles between neighbors?

152
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,810
You're probably not wrong, but...

153
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:48,270
Well, let us go investigate!

154
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,270
Two
Days
Later

155
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,900
After investigating the apartment,

156
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:55,530
it's been confirmed that the
supernatural is not involved.

157
00:09:56,530 --> 00:10:00,220
A pet that belongs to the manager
escaped into the building,

158
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:03,240
and was hiding in that vacant
apartment for a while.

159
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,920
The building had poor construction,

160
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,000
so there was a small gap where
it could go in and out.

161
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:12,090
The sounds that pet made every once
in a while would carry downstairs,

162
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:13,500
making you two suspicious.

163
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:17,630
But then, my lady, what of the
doll that was in the room?

164
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,510
That was a lie made up by the manager.

165
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,640
It does not exist.

166
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,700
The existence of the doll
and any plans for an exorcism

167
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,770
were only what the manager said.
No one else has seen anything.

168
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:30,020
He could've fabricated as much as he liked.

169
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,040
The manager heard the complaint
about the strange noises upstairs

170
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,650
and realized his lost pet was in that room,

171
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:38,150
so he immediately went there to retrieve it.

172
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,780
That took care of the noise,

173
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,490
but it wasn't possible to hide the truth

174
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:43,770
that something was in the
vacant room making noise.

175
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,990
That's why the manager tried

176
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,370
to convince others that the
noise was supernatural in nature,

177
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:51,000
and tried to hide the existence
and escape of his pet.

178
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,750
Oh, there are no pets
allowed in this building.

179
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,880
It would be extremely bad if people
had found out the manager had one.

180
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,930
Even more so since he let it escape.

181
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:02,510
He had to see this lie through.

182
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,130
But wouldn't it have been easier to deceive us

183
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:11,310
if he'd said someone was in the vacant room,
and they were making that noise?

184
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:14,530
A little bit of research would've easily
revealed that the room was indeed vacant.

185
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:18,520
But if he tells a bad lie and is caught,
he'll be asked why he lied,

186
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,900
making it even worse for him.

187
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:24,660
That's why the manager had no choice
but to admit that was a vacant room.

188
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:30,870
But wouldn't blaming the supernatural
result in the possible loss of residents?

189
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:33,360
He only had to say that the
exorcism was successful,

190
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,500
and as long as there was no more noise,
the problem would be solved.

191
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,630
Because the problem would've been
with the doll, not the room,

192
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:43,130
so the condo's reputation wouldn't be damaged.

193
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:46,160
But we just heard that heavy sound
again the day before yesterday!

194
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,840
If he retrieved his pet long ago,

195
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,000
we should no longer be hearing the sound.

196
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:53,730
If the sound disappeared as soon
as the manager went up there,

197
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:56,560
it would be clear that he did something.

198
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,260
The possibility that the supernatural
was involved would dwindle, too.

199
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:03,070
It would also be easy to imagine
that something was in the room.

200
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:06,320
So in order to make it look like the
supernatural was indeed involved,

201
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,570
it was better for him to continue
letting the sound be heard.

202
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:11,080
That's why, after the
manager retrieved his pet,

203
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,500
he would sneak into the
vacant room every night

204
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,040
and continue stomping on the
floor to make the sounds.

205
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:20,250
Would someone really work
that hard to hide a pet?

206
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,570
It may make him look bad as the manager,

207
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:26,110
but I don't think it's the best idea
to continue these unfavorable deeds.

208
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:28,260
The pet in question isn't a mere dog or cat.

209
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,390
It's a large reptile.

210
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:35,640
And a breed that would cause issues if
you were to own one in this country.

211
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,230
Not to mention, this now involves
the building's poor construction.

212
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:41,520
Having a problem with
the building's construction,

213
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,990
as opposed to something being
a supernatural phenomenon,

214
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:47,130
is more likely to lead the residents to
want management to take responsibility,

215
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:49,570
and so affects management directly.

216
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:53,650
Meaning, as the manager, he had to
hide the truth, no matter what.

217
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:58,670
A r-reptile? That's terrifying for
a completely different reason.

218
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,460
I couldn't handle them
when I was alive, either.

219
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,280
Unbelievable. This is truly
what they mean when they say,

220
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,340
"Upon closer inspection, the ghost
upstairs was merely a reptile."

221
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:09,670
I was completely fooled!
That wasn't very nice of the manager!

222
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:12,490
To think I was cowering over a sound like that...

223
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,850
I still have so much to learn as a ghost.

224
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:18,870
I have already confronted the
manager and made him confess.

225
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,350
The sounds should now stop.

226
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:24,410
I have no intention of letting this
incident come to light in the human world.

227
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:29,360
If it gets out, this area will become a zoo,
and it'll be harder for all of you to live here.

228
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:32,490
In exchange for pretending this
never happened, I asked the manager

229
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,620
to let Kuro-senpai rent that
apartment for a very low price.

230
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:41,350
You must have punished that
foolish little manager.

231
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,950
Excellent work, my lady!

232
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,250
You truly are harsh!

233
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,980
No, that's just blackmail. Plain and simple.

234
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,690
You mustn't think about this like a human!

235
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:50,760
Now...

236
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,330
Another case has been solved!

237
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:04,030
That God's Name Is

238
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,220
My lady, thank you kindly.

239
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,880
Was there really a reason
to not tell them the truth?

240
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,750
Most of that explanation was a lie.

241
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,480
There really was a bizarre doll,

242
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,270
and it really was causing
the noise in the room.

243
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:26,510
One wrong move and that doll
would've strangled us to death.

244
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:30,380
There's no point in scaring
those three further.

245
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:36,310
Both the manager and the owner seemed
very grateful that I removed the doll.

246
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,170
They wanted to get rid of it,
but couldn't touch it.

247
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:41,220
They asked people to exorcise it,
only to have them decline or run away.

248
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:45,590
If they left it alone, it was going to mess
with the reputation of the apartment itself.

249
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:48,470
They said they'd waive both
the deposit and the key fee,

250
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,240
and the rent's cheap, so it's worth it.

251
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:56,810
All that's left is for us
to take care of that doll.

252
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:03,800
What is that doll, anyway?
I wouldn't exactly call it Pinocchio.

253
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,740
It's a cursed doll.

254
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,800
A voodoo doll that was
crafted hundreds of years ago.

255
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,680
It's a clay doll that was crafted to

256
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,310
ward off any demons or monsters
from the area it was placed in.

257
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:16,440
It's essentially like a powerful charm.

258
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:20,280
It was probably previously placed in
some prestigious building or plot,

259
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,450
where it used its power.

260
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:24,940
With the changing times,
it likely lost its place,

261
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:29,040
so its functions were ceased
and it was dumped somewhere.

262
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:32,620
The resident of that room must
have picked it up somewhere

263
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,580
and brought it back to the apartment,

264
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,400
but when they moved out,
they left it in a place

265
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,210
where it couldn't be seen.

266
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:42,770
So nothing happened when someone
was actually in the room?

267
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:45,290
It may be a voodoo doll,
but with its functions ceased,

268
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,470
it's just a doll.

269
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:52,230
When the occupant left, they must've
accidentally done something to reactivate it.

270
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,830
They have a tendency to activate if you
just leave blood or spit in the right spot.

271
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:00,730
Seems like the kind of thing that
would latch on to stuff like that.

272
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:06,320
And every night from then on, whatever
force was within that doll manifested

273
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,990
to protect that vacated
room from the ayakashi.

274
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,870
But why does it only happen at night?

275
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:15,470
Most ghosts and monsters conduct
their activities at night.

276
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:18,120
The doll probably only functions
during those hours, as well.

277
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:21,410
And it's meant to protect
the area that it's in,

278
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:23,250
so it wouldn't leave the room.

279
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:28,300
If the ghost from the room
below had gone to investigate,

280
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,760
it would've been exterminated for sure.

281
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,380
Once that doll's powers have been activated,

282
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:37,020
it likely can't be moved easily
by people who aren't like me.

283
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:41,680
We were correct to move it into
those woods during the daytime.

284
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,350
I've ordered all the ayakashi in
the area to stay away, as well.

285
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:55,900
That doll will kill any and all
spirits and monsters in the area,

286
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,440
so it is far too dangerous
to exist in this age.

287
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,160
Considering my position,
I'll have to see it destroyed.

288
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,280
But if we break the doll itself
without proper preparation,

289
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:09,400
we'll only release the cursed energy within it,
making it more difficult to destroy.

290
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,450
That's why we'll have to

291
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:13,780
spontaneously destroy all of the
energy pent up inside it at night.

292
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,580
So that's basically the doll's true identity.

293
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:30,350
Correct. I'm sure the energy within that's
supposed to destroy any evil around it

294
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:33,280
was made to take on the
same form as the doll.

295
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:37,950
By the way, why was this doll
modeled after a sumo wrestler?

296
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,780
The word we use for sumo wrestlers,
"rikishi," means "one who is powerful,"

297
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:44,300
and they have been around long
enough that even

298
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,000
haniwa dolls were modeled after them.

299
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,320
There was also a god named Kongo Rikishi,

300
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,760
so it's probably a fitting
choice to ward away evil.

301
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:53,840
Also, sumo wrestling itself
is considered a Shinto ritual,

302
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,710
and there are some theories
stating that their stomping

303
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:59,010
is a ritual to quell evil spirits in the ground.

304
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:06,060
So the noise they heard in that room
happened to be the stomping ritual.

305
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:12,570
Since it's meant to quell evil spirits,
it's no wonder the ghost below was scared.

306
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:15,770
Seeing as he wasn't stomping on dirt,

307
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:18,300
the power was muted until it fully manifested.

308
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:23,500
I'm definitely surprised that the noise
happened to be a stomping sumo.

309
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,010
It is quite a surprising fact.

310
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:27,330
Uh, are you sure no one's going to get mad?

311
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:29,840
By the way, the former
occupant of that apartment

312
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,090
was a skilled sumo wrestler in school.

313
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:36,090
So when he happened to find an old
doll shaped like a sumo wrestler,

314
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:38,550
he must've taken it home for good luck.

315
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,640
And because of that, he scored very well,

316
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,270
but he recently suffered a
major injury and had to retire.

317
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:49,200
At the same time, he became averse
to the fact that he had the doll,

318
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,250
yet he couldn't bring himself to throw it away,
so he left it in the apartment.

319
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:57,530
So on that note, Kuro-senpai,

320
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,840
please fight with that thing,
just like we discussed!

321
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,290
Then this will all be over!

322
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:05,380
Uh, it looks pretty strong.

323
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:10,090
And what kind of sumo wrestler
has four arms and a horn?

324
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:12,500
I'm sure it has to do with
the craftsman's tastes.

325
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,650
Just making it a sumo wrestler wasn't enough,

326
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:17,910
so they added some rhinoceros beetle
features to make it look stronger.

327
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:21,470
A rhinoceros beetle?
You mind if I run away?

328
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,310
That thing will automatically eliminate
monsters or anything supernatural.

329
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,880
You are feared more than any other
supernatural being on earth,

330
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,570
so once you go near it,
it'll immediately attack you.

331
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,320
Oh, it seems as though he's noticed us.

332
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:40,720
Oh, and because I'm a goddess,
that thing will not attack me.

333
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,920
Just go ahead and fight it!

334
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:04,610
By the way, Kuro-dono apparently
ate the flesh of another yokai

335
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,760
and gained an incredible power.

336
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,470
But what kind of power is it?

337
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:12,440
Yes, Kuro-dono has eaten a kudan.

338
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,630
A kudan? The monster that
predicts the future, then dies?

339
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:20,190
Are you saying Kuro-dono gained that
power and can now see the future?

340
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:22,150
Not only can he predict the future,

341
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:25,130
but he can choose whichever future he desires.

342
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:27,330
Of course, not just any future is possible,

343
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,660
but if there's a possibility it may happen,

344
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:32,830
he's able to make that future come true.

345
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:35,380
So he can control the future?

346
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,200
That's pretty scary.

347
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,090
But kudan die immediately
after predicting the future.

348
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:43,470
Actually, I heard that they can see
the future because they're dying.

349
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:47,250
How could Kuro-dono be okay
after using that power?

350
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,260
Maybe we don't need to be scared of him...

351
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:53,190
No. Kuro-dono has consumed mermaid
flesh, meaning he's immortal.

352
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,940
He'll come back from the dead even
after using his kudan powers.

353
00:20:56,180 --> 00:21:00,690
More so, I hear that Kuro-dono can
use his kudan powers after dying.

354
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:04,070
Meaning he can control the future
in exchange for his life.

355
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:28,720
Which means that even if Kuro-dono is killed...

356
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:34,150
He'll come back to life with the optimal
future so he can fight back.

357
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:35,510
How much you killed him wouldn't matter.

358
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:38,230
Do you truly believe you stand a
chance against a creature like that?

359
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:52,530
Truly...

360
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:54,540
What a terrifying monster!

361
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:21,400
That's perfect, Senpai!

362
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,820
Whoa...

363
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,580
There was no easier way to defeat that thing?

364
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:14,470
I was able to determine this
future after dying once,

365
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,630
but that was definitely pushing it.

366
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:21,590
Well, your body immediately regenerates,
and you don't feel any pain.

367
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:28,590
And I was left with no choice but
to stab my beloved staff into it.

368
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:32,150
There must've been a way
to keep you out of danger.

369
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:34,560
It's not like that was actually dangerous.

370
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:37,560
It's all because of the hard work you put in.

371
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,580
This was nothing.

372
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:45,170
I reconcile concerns between
quarreling monsters,

373
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,330
and when humans get involved,

374
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:51,620
I bring things under control to
see that no one gets harmed.

375
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:55,230
Compared to all of that trouble,
this was far easier.

376
00:23:55,230 --> 00:24:00,370
Well... it is less complicated when we can
just defeat the thing and be done with it.

377
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:02,040
Now, let us go home.

378
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,630
We still have to go to school in the morning.

379
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,800
Aren't the reports you're
supposed to turn in piling up?

380
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,300
I mean, you can't use the excuse of
"I was helping out some yokai."

381
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:16,060
Then you should help me as my boyfriend.

382
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,890
There's no point unless you do it yourself.

383
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,780
My name is Iwanaga Kotoko.

384
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,260
Yokai, ghosts, the supernatural,
and demons...

385
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:52,010
I protect the beings who go by those
names, and the order in this world,

386
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,600
as their Goddess of Wisdom.

387
00:24:57,010 --> 00:25:00,010
To be continued
