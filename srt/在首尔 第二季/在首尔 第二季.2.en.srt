00:00:01,799 --> 00:00:05,639
DAVID TENNANT (VO): The animal world
is full of spectacle and wonder.

2
00:00:07,159 --> 00:00:10,479
But what's it like to be
right in the heart of the action?

3
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:16,159
To find out, our team of spy creatures
goes undercover.

4
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:21,119
They not only look like the animals
they film...

5
00:00:22,959 --> 00:00:24,759
they behave like them too.

6
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:32,599
Armed with the latest camera technology...

7
00:00:35,279 --> 00:00:37,519
they are heading across the globe.

8
00:00:43,599 --> 00:00:44,879
From the heat of the tropics...

9
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,599
to the lands that lie in the north.

10
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:56,599
From the islands of the southern seas...

11
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:03,079
to the snow and ice of the frozen poles.

12
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:10,439
Our spies reveal the astonishing variety
of life that thrives there...

13
00:01:11,999 --> 00:01:14,479
from inside their world.

14
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:26,919
On this assignment, our spy creatures
explore life in the temperate zone.

15
00:01:27,559 --> 00:01:30,799
The lands that lie
between the tropics and the Arctic circle.

16
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:40,359
In this northern realm,
animals find extraordinary ways

17
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,279
to cope with the changing seasons

18
00:01:42,639 --> 00:01:45,159
and the surprising
opportunities they bring.

19
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:50,359
In the mountains of Japan,
winters can be harsh

20
00:01:50,679 --> 00:01:53,119
and temperatures can fall far below zero.

21
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:02,839
The Japanese macaque is the only monkey
that can survive this far north.

22
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:09,759
Here, volcanic springs
bring comforting warmth...

23
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,119
a mountain spa.

24
00:02:14,399 --> 00:02:16,799
The perfect spot to luxuriate.

25
00:02:20,559 --> 00:02:23,279
A new member has just joined
their health club.

26
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:27,759
Spy macaque is already making friends.

27
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:36,839
A youngster, just nine months old.

28
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:43,879
MACAQUES CHATTER

29
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:50,159
The spa has another new recruit.

30
00:02:57,999 --> 00:03:01,839
One that can film the monkeys'
bathing rituals both from above...

31
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:04,119
and below.

32
00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:09,919
It's already capturing unique behaviour.

33
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,879
As a mother grooms her baby

34
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:17,559
she lets warm water
penetrate deep into its fur.

35
00:03:23,679 --> 00:03:27,679
The hot tub is a place to socialise
and strengthen friendships.

36
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:32,639
It's a shared activity.

37
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,399
You scratch my back...

38
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:36,719
I'll scratch yours.

39
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,599
The troop has a clear hierarchy.

40
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:44,239
Who grooms who
helps keep everyone in their place.

41
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,039
It's also a chance to relax.

42
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:03,159
Nearby, winter sports are on offer.

43
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:08,159
The young males love play-fighting.

44
00:04:08,399 --> 00:04:09,959
MACAQUES CHATTER

45
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,359
One day, they'll leave the troop
to join another.

46
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:18,159
Testing their strength helps prepare them
for that moment.

47
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:32,639
Today, they have a chance
to play with a snowball.

48
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,839
One that can film.

49
00:04:46,239 --> 00:04:47,559
Rather than play...

50
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,519
he admires his reflection in its lens.

51
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:56,639
Nearby, games are almost over.

52
00:05:05,159 --> 00:05:08,599
In the spa,
spy monkey is still making friends...

53
00:05:10,719 --> 00:05:12,519
including the curious baby.

54
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,879
But when social position is everything

55
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:30,559
you can't always choose
who your friends are.

56
00:05:32,559 --> 00:05:34,239
It's Mum who decides.

57
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,639
The spa not only gives warmth,
it gives therapy...

58
00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:47,679
helping them de-stress.

59
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:55,199
It's used most by the females,
especially those who are pregnant.

60
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,199
As females never leave the troop,
they pass the custom down

61
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,639
through the generations.

62
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:08,319
The troop's young males will soon be gone.

63
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:12,639
For now, a favourite pastime
is disturbing the peace.

64
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:15,479
MACAQUES SCREECH

65
00:06:27,719 --> 00:06:30,199
The baby isn't so quick off the mark

66
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,599
and Mum is nowhere to be seen.

67
00:06:45,679 --> 00:06:48,359
But what mother would ever really
leave her baby?

68
00:06:58,799 --> 00:07:03,999
Now a special kind of warmth,
one only a mother can offer.

69
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,319
But there goes her chance to relax.

70
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:22,159
While it's still winter in Japan...

71
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,039
the mountains of north west Mexico
are having their first taste of spring.

72
00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:33,519
It's the setting for perhaps the most
beautiful wildlife spectacle of all...

73
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,159
one that requires a unique spy creature.

74
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:41,599
The blue-throated hummingbird
is native to these forests.

75
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,399
This spy version hovers
just like the real thing.

76
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:53,999
In the heart of this grove, half a billion
monarch butterflies lie sleeping.

77
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,239
They have travelled from as far as Canada

78
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,519
to escape the cold northern winter.

79
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:09,679
How they return to this exact spot
is a mystery.

80
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:13,959
Like the butterflies,
hummingbirds feed on nectar

81
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,759
SO our spy isn't seen as a threat.

82
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:22,839
While resting, they cluster together
to conserve precious warmth.

83
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:28,199
But as winter ends,
the sun warms their fragile wings.

84
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,479
Once they reach a critical
13 degree Celsius...

85
00:08:36,359 --> 00:08:37,879
they start to fly.

86
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:47,319
As the day warms,
the forest comes to life.

87
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:56,359
Spy hummingbird won't harm
these delicate butterflies.

88
00:09:00,199 --> 00:09:02,919
It's moving parts are shielded
to keep them safe.

89
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:07,319
Butterflies can even safely land
on its wings.

90
00:09:21,719 --> 00:09:24,959
It soon captures something
quite extraordinary.

91
00:09:32,479 --> 00:09:36,279
What starts as a trickle
soon becomes a stream...

92
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,119
then grows into a cascade.

93
00:09:53,599 --> 00:09:56,279
A spectacle that has rarely been filmed.

94
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,119
And our spy is harmlessly
in the very heart of it.

95
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,559
Beauty also lies in the detail.

96
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:11,439
After five months spent hibernating,
each monarch must take a drink.

97
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:18,279
It will convert their fat stores
to vital sugars.

98
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:23,759
Fuel for the long journey that lies ahead.

99
00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:42,519
Re-energised, they begin their migration
back to North America.

100
00:11:54,319 --> 00:11:57,719
The journey will involve
three successive generations

101
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:00,999
each completing a new stage
of the journey.

102
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:06,839
Only the last will return in the autumn.

103
00:12:10,199 --> 00:12:15,359
It's a relay race across the generations
of up to 6,000 miles.

104
00:12:18,719 --> 00:12:23,479
How they return to this exact same grove
remains a mystery.

105
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:39,679
In Alaska, at the other end of North America,
spring is only just starting to arrive.

106
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:50,759
Here, bald eagles rule the skies.

107
00:12:53,359 --> 00:12:56,439
Including, for now, a spy.

108
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:03,679
At this time of year,
the glaciers are volatile

109
00:13:04,239 --> 00:13:06,839
bringing danger
to the life that thrives here.

110
00:13:09,319 --> 00:13:13,559
As the sun rises higher each day,
the spring melt begins.

111
00:13:16,999 --> 00:13:19,599
Already, cracks have started to form.

112
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:26,399
Soon the sea ice will be gone.

113
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:37,439
The resident harbour seals now haul out
on ice cast from the glacier.

114
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,799
With spring,
humpback whales also start to arrive.

115
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:56,879
They migrated north from California

116
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,719
to enjoy the feeding opportunities
now found here.

117
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,959
Sea otters gather in huge rafts.

118
00:14:11,599 --> 00:14:13,439
Up to 2,000 in all.

119
00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:28,479
The nursing mothers congregate
in the areas now free of ice.

120
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,319
Spy sea otter joins them
in their floating nursery.

121
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:51,839
She's immediately accepted
by these notoriously shy creatures.

122
00:14:55,239 --> 00:15:00,359
It's a privileged insider's view
of the most sociable otter of all.

123
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:08,959
Here, they not only have company,
there are more eyes to spot danger.

124
00:15:11,439 --> 00:15:14,119
The spring melt makes
the glaciers unstable.

125
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:18,839
GLACIER RUMBLES

126
00:15:41,439 --> 00:15:45,559
The ice fall creates a rolling wave,
up to ten metres high.

127
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:51,079
It may still be a danger
over a kilometre away.

128
00:15:55,439 --> 00:15:58,959
In the turmoil,
mothers and pups are easily separated.

129
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:05,359
They must find refuge away from
the glacier.

130
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:30,239
In a cove, they find a solution
to the turbulent waters.

131
00:16:32,439 --> 00:16:35,199
Kelp offers the moorings they need.

132
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,679
It's just a matter of how best
to attach themselves.

133
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:51,159
But even this beginner
is having success.

134
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:02,519
As the ice vanishes,
more kelp beds will soon appear.

135
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,319
The otters can enjoy
the upcoming summer in peace.

136
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:21,119
Spring has also reached Manitoba
in central Canada.

137
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:26,239
It marks the beginning
of an extraordinary awakening.

138
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:33,679
These are garter snakes.

139
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:44,999
After hibernating together underground,
they emerge in their thousands.

140
00:17:49,479 --> 00:17:51,999
Remarkably, all are male.

141
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,439
They warm themselves in the sun,
preparing for the moment

142
00:18:00,639 --> 00:18:02,239
when the females emerge.

143
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:08,519
This one has a camera.

144
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:15,399
Our spy is entering a world
governed by smell.

145
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:18,639
Snakes use their tongues
to pick up scent.

146
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:21,639
All are searching for females.

147
00:18:26,999 --> 00:18:30,879
When the males detect a likely partner,
they swarm all over her

148
00:18:31,239 --> 00:18:33,039
desperate to be the first to mate.

149
00:18:36,399 --> 00:18:39,679
But spy snake is witnessing something
quite extraordinary.

150
00:18:41,239 --> 00:18:45,119
Although there are no females here,
the males are still swarming.

151
00:18:52,439 --> 00:18:54,479
And even more are joining the scrum.

152
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:06,199
Nearby, others have also
picked up the scent.

153
00:19:10,239 --> 00:19:11,839
Soon, there's no stopping them.

154
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:35,279
As everyone piles in,
spy snake becomes buried

155
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:37,039
in the growing ball of snakes.

156
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:59,479
Then, in the middle,
the reason for the knot of serpents...

157
00:20:05,399 --> 00:20:06,599
...an imposter.

158
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,639
A male that smells like a female.

159
00:20:10,719 --> 00:20:12,959
He's deliberately attracting the males.

160
00:20:17,439 --> 00:20:20,119
His aim is to share their warmth.

161
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,679
By fooling them into embracing him,
he becomes super-heated

162
00:20:25,239 --> 00:20:28,879
a huge gain for a cold-blooded reptile
looking for a mate.

163
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:34,279
Finally, there she is.

164
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,559
Her perfume is far stronger
than the imposter.

165
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:46,199
Nothing beats the real thing.

166
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:52,039
The warmest males are already
hot on her trail.

167
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,119
But the super-heated imposter
leads the charge.

168
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:15,999
Here, snakes that impersonate females
get ahead in the mating game.

169
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:21,279
Best leave them to it.

170
00:21:28,719 --> 00:21:31,959
Summer has arrived in the forests
of southern Germany.

171
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:40,879
The season of plenty for a secretive
and industrious creature.

172
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:50,519
The only clue to its presence,
a carefully-constructed wood pile.

173
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:57,879
This is the time beavers raise their young

174
00:21:59,239 --> 00:22:02,519
making the most of the lush vegetation
that summer brings.

175
00:22:03,999 --> 00:22:05,839
They recognise each other by smell.

176
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,159
Rubbing noses confirms their friendship.

177
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,039
They pair for life,
and live together as a family.

178
00:22:24,399 --> 00:22:25,879
They are wary of strangers.

179
00:22:27,959 --> 00:22:30,119
Newcomers enter at their own risk.

180
00:22:31,639 --> 00:22:34,359
Somehow, spy beaver must win them over.

181
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:38,639
But first, he must pass the odour test.

182
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:46,839
Real beavers have scent glands
that tell family from foe.

183
00:22:49,879 --> 00:22:53,839
As our spy doesn't smell like a beaver,
he's free to explore.

184
00:22:57,999 --> 00:23:00,319
Their lodge has a concealed entrance...

185
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,519
that lets them come and go
without being seen.

186
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:13,039
Keeping a low profile hides them
from predators like lynx and foxes.

187
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:21,599
On the bank,
a new spy is there to greet her.

188
00:23:25,439 --> 00:23:27,599
Beavers are strict vegetarians

189
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:32,679
and spy baby beaver is surrounded
by willow, their favourite meal.

190
00:23:34,399 --> 00:23:35,919
BEAVER SQUEAKS

191
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:50,159
Her teeth are coloured orange
by iron deposits that strengthen them.

192
00:23:58,279 --> 00:24:02,279
They are also self-sharpening,
and slice through wood like a knife.

193
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:13,759
Beavers can fell
300 shrubs and trees each year

194
00:24:14,239 --> 00:24:17,799
clearing old growth, and helping
to maintain their entire ecosystem.

195
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:25,159
For now, the youngsters
leave it all to the grown-ups.

196
00:24:28,199 --> 00:24:30,239
They spend most of their time at play.

197
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:35,079
Wrestling is a rarely-filmed pastime.

198
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,919
Beavers also have friends.

199
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:05,959
A muskrat.

200
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:16,199
This mini-me lives alongside the beavers,
and even shares their lodge.

201
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:25,479
Wherever the beaver goes...

202
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:28,159
the muskrat follows.

203
00:25:32,719 --> 00:25:36,639
Being ten times smaller means the
best food is usually out of reach.

204
00:25:37,999 --> 00:25:41,879
But while the beaver does the hard work,
the muskrat can sit back.

205
00:25:57,999 --> 00:25:59,799
This is what friends are for.

206
00:26:11,199 --> 00:26:13,919
Beavers with young
are always on high alert.

207
00:26:37,239 --> 00:26:38,439
A false alarm...

208
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:43,919
but always best
to err on the side of caution.

209
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:53,199
After a fright,
grooming is a comfort for everyone.

210
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:05,399
By creating a layer of air between
skin and underfur, it provides insulation.

211
00:27:10,999 --> 00:27:12,959
Harmony is soon restored...

212
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:18,199
while the muskrat just keeps himself busy.

213
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:29,919
For Mum, a well-earned massage
after a hard day's work.

214
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:44,399
As early summer arrives,
Baja, California becomes the focus

215
00:27:44,479 --> 00:27:46,319
of a great natural gathering.

216
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:53,279
Here, brown pelicans patrol some of
the richest fishing grounds in the world.

217
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:05,359
There's a new member of the flock,
a spy on the wing.

218
00:28:08,879 --> 00:28:12,839
One that can film the fishing party,
wing-tip to wing-tip.

219
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:29,399
Where warm currents
create plankton blooms

220
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:31,879
huge fish shoals are found.

221
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:39,359
It's just a matter of spotting them
from the air.

222
00:28:42,479 --> 00:28:44,359
Then taking them by surprise.

223
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:00,679
But where fishing is easy,
everyone wants a piece of the action.

224
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:05,279
Bottlenose dolphins.

225
00:29:09,879 --> 00:29:13,239
By spreading out, they increase
their chances of finding a shoal.

226
00:29:16,719 --> 00:29:18,719
Dolphins are intensely curious.

227
00:29:21,879 --> 00:29:25,039
They leap to check out the strange bird
that's following them.

228
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:48,999
Here, it's not just dolphins
that take to the air...

229
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:54,559
Mobula rays.

230
00:30:07,719 --> 00:30:09,439
Why they leap is a mystery.

231
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,439
But it might be a signal to show
where food has been found.

232
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:41,839
For where rays are jumping,
huge blooms of plankton are not far away.

233
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:50,559
And rays converge
in their tens of thousands to feed.

234
00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:18,599
The aerial view may be astonishing,
but more wonder lies below.

235
00:31:24,239 --> 00:31:27,999
Spy ray gets closer than
any human diver can.

236
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:33,799
Deep into the heart of the shoal.

237
00:31:50,959 --> 00:31:52,799
With a spy swimming among them...

238
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:55,399
and a spy in the sky...

239
00:31:56,519 --> 00:32:00,199
our cameras capture an event
never filmed before.

240
00:32:03,639 --> 00:32:09,039
As the rays circle, they create a vortex,
concentrating the plankton inside.

241
00:32:17,639 --> 00:32:21,279
At every turn,
more plankton is sucked into the centre.

242
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:24,079
They just have to scoop it up.

243
00:32:32,879 --> 00:32:36,199
When they feed near the surface,
they use a different technique.

244
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:41,559
Ripples pass through the masses
like a subaquatic Mexican wave.

245
00:32:55,199 --> 00:32:57,479
Soon, the leaping starts again.

246
00:33:01,639 --> 00:33:03,599
For spy ray, it's a case of...

247
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:06,639
"If you can't beat them, join them."

248
00:33:22,879 --> 00:33:27,399
As the day ends, our spy keeps
leaping with the best of them.

249
00:33:40,199 --> 00:33:41,919
It's mid-summer in Alaska.

250
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:46,039
The fishing season for grizzly bears.

251
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:51,719
BEARS GROWL

252
00:33:52,639 --> 00:33:57,759
With uncanny timing, mother bears
bring their cubs to a remarkable event.

253
00:33:59,239 --> 00:34:03,519
Soon, a million salmon
will pass up this river to spawn.

254
00:34:06,719 --> 00:34:09,359
This year, a newcomer is joining them.

255
00:34:16,039 --> 00:34:20,479
With his teddy bear looks and camera eye,
he's well-prepared.

256
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,719
Late arrivals must be quick.

257
00:34:26,359 --> 00:34:28,719
The best fishing spots will soon be taken.

258
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,599
Our spy also has a quick way down.

259
00:34:42,919 --> 00:34:44,999
He's now in prime position.

260
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:53,359
Risky when a mother bear
is still staking out her claim.

261
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,799
BEAR GRUNTS

262
00:35:08,879 --> 00:35:11,119
But he seems to have got away with it.

263
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:22,719
SPY BEAR GROWLS

264
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:25,679
For all, it's a waiting game.

265
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:29,719
The tide is out, and the river empty.

266
00:35:32,759 --> 00:35:36,039
But her cubs have yet to master
the art of patience.

267
00:35:37,999 --> 00:35:40,759
They head out to the estuary
to search for the salmon...

268
00:35:45,879 --> 00:35:48,279
...leaving mother bear to bide her time.

269
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,879
Spy bald eagle is already on their trail.

270
00:35:59,999 --> 00:36:03,079
Bears can smell fish up to 20 miles away.

271
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:11,439
By following their nose, they soon find
where the salmon are gathering.

272
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:25,519
With fish everywhere,
just how hard can it be to catch one?

273
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:10,479
Finally! After all that effort.

274
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,639
Older bears know better
than to waste their energy.

275
00:37:21,479 --> 00:37:24,519
They've learnt that salmon arrive
on the high tide.

276
00:37:26,999 --> 00:37:29,559
But the first is not what it seems.

277
00:37:31,759 --> 00:37:34,479
Spy salmon swims just like the real thing.

278
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,119
It too is ready to run the gauntlet
of the bears.

279
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:52,719
In its wake are countless sockeye salmon.

280
00:37:58,199 --> 00:38:01,519
They've travelled thousands of miles
to spawn in the river

281
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:03,039
where once they were born.

282
00:38:14,399 --> 00:38:19,439
The salmon bottleneck beneath the falls,
before taking a leap into the unknown.

283
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:23,999
A prime spot for fishing.

284
00:38:29,879 --> 00:38:31,639
Bears can see underwater...

285
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:34,199
useful for targeting.

286
00:38:52,999 --> 00:38:54,319
With so many fish

287
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:56,279
it's like bobbing for apples.

288
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:09,279
They can eat over 30 salmon a day

289
00:39:09,439 --> 00:39:11,559
and almost double their weight
in the fishing season.

290
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:18,879
They soon become fussy,
picking the most nutritious treats

291
00:39:18,999 --> 00:39:20,559
like the skin and head.

292
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:27,679
But any good party can attract
unwelcome guests.

293
00:39:38,879 --> 00:39:41,079
They have good reason
to feel nervous.

294
00:39:42,959 --> 00:39:44,839
Males can Kill cubs.

295
00:39:53,399 --> 00:39:55,119
One mother makes a stand.

296
00:39:56,999 --> 00:39:58,039
BEAR GROWLS

297
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:01,879
She's joined by another.

298
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:21,999
He may be powerful,
but he's no match for a mother's fury.

299
00:40:44,999 --> 00:40:46,519
He won't be back in a hurry.

300
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:55,599
Now that the cubs have nothing to fear,
why not tackle a bear of their own?

301
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:04,039
Grab the paw first...

302
00:41:11,279 --> 00:41:12,399
That showed him.

303
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:16,079
Now the Killer bite.

304
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:23,319
Maybe not.
- BEAR GRUNTS

305
00:41:25,559 --> 00:41:26,639
SPY BEAR GROWLS

306
00:41:28,359 --> 00:41:31,759
Meanwhile, spy salmon has been left
high and dry.

307
00:41:33,919 --> 00:41:35,199
Surely a better bet.

308
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:51,479
Never mind,
there's always one that gets away.

309
00:42:00,799 --> 00:42:02,559
As summer draws to an end...

310
00:42:02,959 --> 00:42:05,319
Istanbul, in Turkey, sets the scene

311
00:42:05,399 --> 00:42:07,239
for another great spectacle.

312
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:13,079
White storks are heading south
to escape Europe's upcoming winter

313
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:15,039
when food will be hard to find.

314
00:42:16,759 --> 00:42:19,999
Half a million will make
the perilous journey to Africa

315
00:42:20,399 --> 00:42:22,199
of up to 8,000 miles.

316
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:29,719
They have a fellow traveller.

317
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:36,399
He joins them in the thermals
that rise from the ground below.

318
00:42:40,879 --> 00:42:45,719
Spy stork's broad wings are designed
to ride these natural elevators

319
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:47,599
just like the real birds.

320
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:54,719
The twisting columns of hot air
offer the storks a free ride upwards.

321
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:21,999
Once they reach the top of one thermal,
they simply glide to another.

322
00:43:25,919 --> 00:43:29,039
They head to the city
with hardly a wing flap.

323
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:31,199
Good move.

324
00:43:32,759 --> 00:43:37,599
The roads and buildings of Istanbul
reflect the heat, creating huge thermals

325
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:40,439
which carry them upwards
even higher than before.

326
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:06,999
Riding only on hot air,
they can reach heights of nearly a mile.

327
00:44:12,959 --> 00:44:14,479
They need the altitude.

328
00:44:14,919 --> 00:44:17,439
They now face the riskiest part
of their journey

329
00:44:18,279 --> 00:44:20,919
because thermals don't form over water.

330
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:37,439
As they try to glide

331
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:40,079
there's nothing to give them
the lift they need.

332
00:44:45,279 --> 00:44:49,079
Those who hadn't gained enough height
on land soon drop from the sky.

333
00:44:57,079 --> 00:45:01,279
To avoid plunging into the sea,
they must flap their heavy wings.

334
00:45:05,319 --> 00:45:08,319
They start burning body fat
just to stay airborne

335
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:11,639
consuming 20 times more energy
than when they glide.

336
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:20,119
If a wing so much as touches the water,
they will fall in and drown.

337
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:26,439
They are battling for their lives.

338
00:45:37,399 --> 00:45:39,359
Then suddenly, a lifeline.

339
00:45:41,799 --> 00:45:44,439
An outcrop rising from the sea.

340
00:45:56,359 --> 00:46:01,159
Just enough sun-baked rock to create
the thermals they so desperately need.

341
00:46:11,999 --> 00:46:15,559
It's a free ride upwards
that saves their lives.

342
00:46:20,039 --> 00:46:23,359
In this way, storks use islands
as stepping stones

343
00:46:23,439 --> 00:46:25,039
to help survive the crossing.

344
00:46:26,919 --> 00:46:30,079
Travelling only by day,
it can take four weeks

345
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:32,479
before they arrive over
the plains of Africa.

346
00:46:46,959 --> 00:46:50,519
Here, they'll have all the insects
and other food they need

347
00:46:50,959 --> 00:46:53,799
as they wait out Europe's upcoming winter.

348
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:11,079
In England, the early morning mist signals
that autumn has finally arrived...

349
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:17,559
and with it, the greatest and most
colourful transformation in nature.

350
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:39,479
The trees survive the winter by taking back
nutrients and chlorophyll from the leaves.

351
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:50,639
What's left behind are the autumn hues.

352
00:47:53,719 --> 00:47:56,439
The leaves that once fed the trees
are then discarded.

353
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:04,919
Grey squirrels are among the many preparing
themselves for the changing season.

354
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:18,719
Spy squirrel is poised and ready
with his camera eye.

355
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:26,159
Well, nearly ready.

356
00:48:29,319 --> 00:48:30,839
Along with his spy nut

357
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:34,319
other disguised cameras are strewn across
the forest floor.

358
00:48:42,959 --> 00:48:46,039
In autumn, squirrels stock up
their winter larder.

359
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:51,879
Each may bury around 10,000 nuts.

360
00:48:52,839 --> 00:48:56,799
In an amazing feat of memory,
they may retrieve 4,000 of them.

361
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:01,919
With so many nuts to find,
competition is rife.

362
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:19,879
Every nut is a gift for would-be thieves.

363
00:49:27,879 --> 00:49:31,519
In fact, around a fifth of all squirrels
steal from others.

364
00:49:33,959 --> 00:49:35,199
That'll do nicely.

365
00:49:50,599 --> 00:49:52,199
It's one thing to steal a nut...

366
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:55,559
Another to keep hold of it.

367
00:50:01,239 --> 00:50:04,039
It's not just squirrels
feeling the seasonal change.

368
00:50:05,239 --> 00:50:07,639
Autumn is the rutting season for red deer.

369
00:50:09,479 --> 00:50:12,999
By breeding now,
they will have their young in the summer.

370
00:50:16,599 --> 00:50:17,719
Their stag.

371
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:21,679
He tries to gather together
as many hinds as he can.

372
00:50:23,919 --> 00:50:25,359
Perhaps 20 in all.

373
00:50:28,799 --> 00:50:31,679
Spy squirrel is right in the middle
of his herd.

374
00:50:36,439 --> 00:50:38,559
But the stag has other things
on his mind.

375
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:42,999
STAG GRUNTS

376
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:45,959
In the rutting season,
he has his work cut out.

377
00:50:49,239 --> 00:50:52,439
Rounding up his straying hinds
is a constant battle.

378
00:51:08,039 --> 00:51:10,079
But he has an even bigger challenge...

379
00:51:11,439 --> 00:51:12,439
...a rival.

380
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:15,879
STAG GRUNTS

381
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:20,719
A bevy of hinds
is just what he's looking for.

382
00:51:27,679 --> 00:51:29,719
Females will go with the strongest stag.

383
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:32,079
STAG GRUNTS

384
00:51:34,679 --> 00:51:37,039
The rival must fight to prove his mettle.

385
00:51:44,479 --> 00:51:45,959
STAG GRUNTS

386
00:51:48,799 --> 00:51:50,159
Battle lines are drawn.

387
00:51:58,439 --> 00:52:00,519
One mistake could prove fatal.

388
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:05,359
Whoever gains most ground wins.

389
00:52:08,919 --> 00:52:10,719
Victory for the reigning stag.

390
00:52:11,159 --> 00:52:12,759
STAG GRUNTS

391
00:52:13,279 --> 00:52:15,159
Spy squirrel may be worse for wear

392
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:18,559
but he still captures one final shot
of the champion.

393
00:52:18,679 --> 00:52:20,479
STAG GRUNTS

394
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:30,919
For the squirrels, there's still one last
nut they've yet to get their paws on.

395
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:44,479
Another trophy to squirrel away.

396
00:52:57,159 --> 00:53:01,559
Back in Germany, among the beavers,
autumn is also well underway.

397
00:53:02,799 --> 00:53:04,999
It won't be long until the winter sets in.

398
00:53:10,799 --> 00:53:14,199
Before then, their lodge must undergo
some maintenance.

399
00:53:16,679 --> 00:53:18,679
Spy beaver investigates.

400
00:53:21,959 --> 00:53:24,199
It's the beavers' busiest time of year.

401
00:53:26,599 --> 00:53:28,879
They scour the river for building material.

402
00:53:34,799 --> 00:53:37,639
Stones help stabilise the lodge
against flooding.

403
00:53:43,999 --> 00:53:47,759
Preparing their home for winter
is everyone's responsibility.

404
00:53:57,799 --> 00:54:00,719
Sticks and logs bring strength
to the structure.

405
00:54:09,279 --> 00:54:13,119
They can also be used to plug holes,
and reduce leaks to the main chamber.

406
00:54:20,959 --> 00:54:23,319
Small sticks are used to fill in the gaps.

407
00:54:25,399 --> 00:54:28,999
To cap it all, a thatch of turf
helps weatherproof the roof.

408
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:36,079
On the riverbank,
the whole family is hard at work

409
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:38,319
collecting food and nesting material.

410
00:54:44,279 --> 00:54:45,999
Even the youngsters do their bit.

411
00:54:53,079 --> 00:54:56,279
The beavers must harvest
what they can before winter sets in.

412
00:54:58,759 --> 00:55:00,639
Everything must be ferried back home.

413
00:55:04,599 --> 00:55:07,359
The muskrat uses grass
as nesting material

414
00:55:07,439 --> 00:55:09,399
to furnish his own quarters in the lodge.

415
00:55:19,799 --> 00:55:22,959
As winter approaches,
the beavers re-double their efforts.

416
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:39,839
And the muskrat
gets ever more ambitious.

417
00:55:52,879 --> 00:55:54,719
With everyone working flat-out

418
00:55:55,239 --> 00:55:57,679
they'll soon be ready
for the upcoming winter.

419
00:56:04,919 --> 00:56:07,959
They'll spend most of it safely
tucked up inside.

420
00:56:15,679 --> 00:56:19,879
As the year comes to an end,
the snows have returned to Japan.

421
00:56:22,839 --> 00:56:25,639
Already the macaques
are huddling together for warmth.

422
00:56:31,479 --> 00:56:35,359
Once more, their social life revolves
around the hot tub.

423
00:56:41,399 --> 00:56:43,759
Our spies are at the end of their mission.

424
00:56:49,959 --> 00:56:52,439
Sweet dreams soon come to all.

425
00:57:07,279 --> 00:57:09,999
Time out for our spy creatures too.

426
00:57:16,839 --> 00:57:18,719
Next time, our spies travel

427
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:20,799
to the islands of the southern seas

428
00:57:21,159 --> 00:57:23,919
to meet yet more extraordinary animals.
