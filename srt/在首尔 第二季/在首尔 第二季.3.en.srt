1
00:00:44,689 --> 00:00:45,603
Hey.

2
00:00:45,647 --> 00:00:47,431
Can I sleepin here tonight?

3
00:00:47,474 --> 00:00:48,998
Yeah, of course.

4
00:01:00,531 --> 00:01:03,534
I just can't believel might
never see him again.

5
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:18,288
Hey, man, we still good?

6
00:01:20,029 --> 00:01:22,118
So, you'll have the passport
tomorrow?

7
00:01:22,161 --> 00:01:24,163
Great.

8
00:01:24,207 --> 00:01:25,706
No, no, that's...
that's great.

9
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:27,752
I'm on my way
to get the eight grand now.

10
00:01:27,776 --> 00:01:29,778
Yeah.
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

11
00:01:44,618 --> 00:01:47,186
No. No.

12
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:48,230
No!

13
00:01:59,111 --> 00:02:01,461
I'm sorry. I'm just
trying to figure out

14
00:02:01,505 --> 00:02:04,029
another way to get
the money, you know.

15
00:02:04,073 --> 00:02:06,815
Got like 300 bucks,
and you can have my car.

16
00:02:06,858 --> 00:02:09,078
But please, man. Please.

17
00:02:12,081 --> 00:02:14,083
Right, okay.

18
00:02:37,671 --> 00:02:39,475
And Henry... we're talking
about King Henry now...

19
00:02:39,499 --> 00:02:41,240
Henry wants to form

20
00:02:41,284 --> 00:02:43,547
an alliance between...
with France.Right.

21
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,264
Hello, Sam.

22
00:03:06,613 --> 00:03:09,051
Is that short
for "Samantha" or...?

23
00:03:09,094 --> 00:03:11,967
Clean this by the
end of the week.

24
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:14,578
Okeydoke.

25
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:16,710
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

26
00:03:21,397 --> 00:03:24,270
I don't know why
Nia trusts you guys.

27
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,811
But I don't.

28
00:03:39,033 --> 00:03:40,557
- My God.
- My God.

29
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,664
Sam held youat gunpoint?

30
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:43,386
Yeah.

31
00:03:43,429 --> 00:03:45,997
I mean, not, you know,
exactly at gunpoint,

32
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,521
but, like, she...
The gun was very present.

33
00:03:48,565 --> 00:03:49,585
I mean,
she could have killed me.

34
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:51,655
I'm like a sitting duck
in there.

35
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:54,310
Hey, this box just came

36
00:03:54,353 --> 00:03:56,312
for Jessica Damon.
I think it's, like,

37
00:03:56,355 --> 00:03:58,105
doggy medical supplies
or something.

38
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,750
Yeah. Yup, that's me.

39
00:03:59,793 --> 00:04:03,780
You can just toss it
on the counter-ino.

40
00:04:08,084 --> 00:04:09,738
Cool.

41
00:04:09,781 --> 00:04:11,087
Cool.

42
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,958
Cool. Thank you so much.

43
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:15,502
We're just in the middleof
a little executive huddle.

44
00:04:15,526 --> 00:04:16,962
Okay.
Thank you.

45
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:19,312
Bye. Thank you.

46
00:04:19,356 --> 00:04:21,575
My God, justbone
her already.

47
00:04:21,619 --> 00:04:23,510
Just get it outof your system.
I think that's really cute

48
00:04:23,534 --> 00:04:25,971
that you think I can
have sex without feelings,

49
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:28,582
but you know, if I... if
I have sex with that woman,

50
00:04:28,626 --> 00:04:31,150
I'm gonna... well,
I'll marry that woman.

51
00:04:31,194 --> 00:04:33,651
Okay. And so I can't think
abouthaving a relationship right now,

52
00:04:33,675 --> 00:04:35,111
considering...

53
00:04:35,154 --> 00:04:36,939
Being a lesbiansounds
exhausting.

54
00:04:36,982 --> 00:04:39,724
You know, it certainly
is on the wrist.

55
00:04:39,768 --> 00:04:42,074
Guys, can we
please circle back?

56
00:04:42,118 --> 00:04:44,729
What am I doing about
the Sam situation? Nothing!

57
00:04:44,773 --> 00:04:46,402
There's no problem.
There's no situation.

58
00:04:46,426 --> 00:04:48,753
The only situation is that
we need to clean this money.

59
00:04:48,777 --> 00:04:50,126
Okay.

60
00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:52,737
Nobody cares
about Felix's safety. Good.

61
00:04:52,781 --> 00:04:54,584
I'll fake some more
grooming truck transactions,

62
00:04:54,608 --> 00:04:56,151
and Murphy can
make the deposit.

63
00:04:56,175 --> 00:04:57,742
I have to goto
the bank again?

64
00:04:57,786 --> 00:05:00,416
Yes. I told you you haveto
make lots of little deposits.

65
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,225
Jess? Yeah.

66
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:04,116
Can you maybe, like,
fix up the grooming truck

67
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,118
so we can start blending
insome real customers in there?

68
00:05:06,142 --> 00:05:08,207
What makes you think
that I can fix up a truck?

69
00:05:08,231 --> 00:05:09,406
Because you're... What?

70
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:10,886
You always are the one

71
00:05:10,929 --> 00:05:12,428
that puts the
inkin the printer.

72
00:05:12,452 --> 00:05:14,933
I'm not stereotyping.
My God.

73
00:05:14,977 --> 00:05:16,456
Whatever. Fine.

74
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,243
How are you
feeling about Max?

75
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:25,552
Worse.

76
00:05:25,596 --> 00:05:28,033
It's so annoying. Ever
since he came back,

77
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:30,122
I'm, like, in a
constant st...

78
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:36,409
Whatever. Just don't...
don't make plans after work.

79
00:05:36,433 --> 00:05:37,956
We're going out. I...

80
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,392
I don't...

81
00:05:39,436 --> 00:05:41,003
I can't feel like
this anymore.

82
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,051
This is stupid.

83
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:53,319
License and
registration, please.

84
00:05:56,845 --> 00:05:58,716
Why? I'm just parked here.

85
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,371
This is private property,
and we got a complaint.

86
00:06:32,663 --> 00:06:34,796
Morning.

87
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:36,449
Hey, Dean Cuisine!

88
00:06:36,493 --> 00:06:37,731
Please don't call me that.

89
00:06:37,755 --> 00:06:39,191
Sorry, I'm just
excited, man.

90
00:06:39,235 --> 00:06:41,324
I got a call from some
cop in New Castle.

91
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:43,258
Guess who they found
sleeping in the parking lot.

92
00:06:43,282 --> 00:06:44,849
Max Parish. Bing!

93
00:06:44,893 --> 00:06:47,132
I'm gonna go get him. Nah,
thought we'd go together.

94
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,635
I will go. I'm the one with

95
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:50,657
the address, so I have to go
with you... it's crazy.

96
00:06:50,681 --> 00:06:51,769
Come on.

97
00:06:52,242 --> 00:06:53,634
I'll drive.

98
00:07:23,441 --> 00:07:25,356
Okay, Murphy?

99
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:27,421
I have to run an errand,
so here's everything

100
00:07:27,445 --> 00:07:28,683
you need to make
the deposit.

101
00:07:28,707 --> 00:07:30,448
Please text me
when that is done.

102
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:31,841
An errand?

103
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:33,383
You run out of tampons
or something?

104
00:07:33,407 --> 00:07:34,471
Hilarious, very funny.

105
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:35,801
Any more?
You done?

106
00:07:35,845 --> 00:07:37,474
Nope. Seriously,
where are you going?

107
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:39,979
I just have to, you know,
take care of something,

108
00:07:40,023 --> 00:07:41,851
in light of recent events.

109
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:43,243
Don't worry about it.

110
00:07:43,287 --> 00:07:45,506
Well, can youpick
me up a box, too?

111
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,093
And some maxi pads
for nighttime.

112
00:07:47,117 --> 00:07:48,858
You know how it is.

113
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:50,381
Cool joke.

114
00:07:50,424 --> 00:07:52,949
Hey, I'm gonna
take my lunch.

115
00:07:52,992 --> 00:07:54,428
What time is it?

116
00:07:54,472 --> 00:07:55,778
I don't know, 11:00?

117
00:07:55,821 --> 00:07:58,041
Okay, don't you get
here at, like, 10:00?

118
00:07:58,084 --> 00:07:59,564
I'm starving, man.

119
00:07:59,607 --> 00:08:02,175
You can take your
lunch at 12:30, okay?

120
00:08:02,219 --> 00:08:03,960
You know, I
livewith my sister.

121
00:08:05,657 --> 00:08:07,200
The chick you have
a giant crush on.

122
00:08:07,224 --> 00:08:09,139
I don't have a
giant crush on...

123
00:08:09,182 --> 00:08:11,750
Yeah, yes, well, she shows
me your text messages.

124
00:08:11,794 --> 00:08:14,294
By the way, you know thatshe
can see when you're typing.

125
00:08:14,318 --> 00:08:17,190
And then you delete it, and
then you're... starting again.

126
00:08:17,234 --> 00:08:18,602
And then youdelete it again.

127
00:08:18,626 --> 00:08:20,498
Yeah, so I can
pretty much tell Chels

128
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:21,562
whatever I want, you know...

129
00:08:21,586 --> 00:08:22,955
If you're coolor
if you're a loser.

130
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:24,067
Yeah, she'll listen.

131
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:26,504
She's...
she's pretty insecure.

132
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,985
Well, you know, I mean,

133
00:08:29,028 --> 00:08:31,726
if you're starving,
then I think,

134
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,076
go ahead, take lunch.

135
00:08:33,119 --> 00:08:35,426
Just try to keep
it brief, okay?

136
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:42,868
You guys were here
yesterday, right?

137
00:08:42,912 --> 00:08:44,522
I wa... Yeah.

138
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,437
Yes...

139
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,526
Our company
is just really...

140
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,093
really killing
it these days.

141
00:08:50,136 --> 00:08:51,659
Good for you guys.

142
00:08:53,052 --> 00:08:55,576
Receipt? Yeah,
for taxes and...

143
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,404
and such.

144
00:09:01,626 --> 00:09:03,149
Find outside.

145
00:09:28,522 --> 00:09:30,611
Stay. Stay.

146
00:09:30,655 --> 00:09:32,657
Stay.

147
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,877
Stay there.

148
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,357
Stay.

149
00:09:41,579 --> 00:09:43,755
Reagan! Reagan!

150
00:09:43,798 --> 00:09:45,061
Quiet!

151
00:09:45,104 --> 00:09:46,062
Hey.

152
00:09:46,105 --> 00:09:47,715
Hey, Mom.

153
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:49,761
I was just upstairs
looking for you.

154
00:09:49,804 --> 00:09:51,545
What are you doing here?

155
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:53,069
Just came by to say hi.

156
00:09:53,112 --> 00:09:55,462
I...

157
00:09:55,506 --> 00:09:57,508
miss you.

158
00:09:57,551 --> 00:09:59,684
Okay. What, I
can't miss you?

159
00:10:01,991 --> 00:10:03,514
Hey, Reagan.

160
00:10:10,608 --> 00:10:12,088
Finally.

161
00:10:12,131 --> 00:10:13,916
Hi.

162
00:10:15,526 --> 00:10:17,267
What's up?

163
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,703
Hello.

164
00:10:18,746 --> 00:10:20,899
Is there a person in charge
we can speak with?

165
00:10:20,923 --> 00:10:22,533
I,

166
00:10:22,576 --> 00:10:24,326
I don't really know
who's in charge.

167
00:10:24,361 --> 00:10:26,537
I just answer the phone.

168
00:10:29,409 --> 00:10:30,996
Good day, miss.
Is there any chance

169
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,606
you can help us
with some things?

170
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:35,981
Yeah, there's some
pamphletsover there somewhere.

171
00:10:36,025 --> 00:10:38,307
No, sorry, we're-we're
not here about a guide dog.

172
00:10:38,331 --> 00:10:40,594
We're... we're
from the IRS-CI.

173
00:10:40,638 --> 00:10:41,726
What's that?

174
00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:43,380
IRS Criminal Investigation.

175
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,515
Okay.

176
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:49,516
Is there a place
we can chat?

177
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,128
Of course. Yeah.

178
00:10:52,171 --> 00:10:54,434
And is there
a Jessica Damon here?

179
00:10:54,478 --> 00:10:56,001
She's here.
Great.

180
00:10:56,045 --> 00:10:57,239
We'll want to speak
to her as well.

181
00:10:57,263 --> 00:11:00,005
Perfect. I will...

182
00:11:00,049 --> 00:11:02,399
find her for you...

183
00:11:02,442 --> 00:11:03,966
my lord.

184
00:11:08,471 --> 00:11:10,231
I'm Pam Clarke.
This is Josh Wallace.

185
00:11:10,255 --> 00:11:11,299
Here's our card.

186
00:11:11,343 --> 00:11:13,127
Thank you.

187
00:11:13,171 --> 00:11:15,105
We handle financial crimes
relating to tax fraud,

188
00:11:15,129 --> 00:11:16,609
laundering and drug fronts.

189
00:11:16,653 --> 00:11:18,152
Blah, blah, blah.
This is really

190
00:11:18,176 --> 00:11:20,439
just a formality.
It won't take long.

191
00:11:20,483 --> 00:11:22,156
Normally, we'd do
this over the phone,

192
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,704
but CSI: Chicago
here insisted

193
00:11:24,748 --> 00:11:26,053
that we come in person.

194
00:11:26,097 --> 00:11:27,248
Yeah, we're happy to help.

195
00:11:27,272 --> 00:11:29,535
Was there a...
an issue or something?

196
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:31,339
Well, I noticedyour tax
exemption paperwork

197
00:11:31,363 --> 00:11:33,602
was refiled when
yourorganization changed hands.

198
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:35,585
That triggereda
background check

199
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:37,476
on all of your
cosignerson the account.

200
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,197
Which is standard protocol.

201
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,242
Yeah, yes.
Yeah, of course.

202
00:11:41,286 --> 00:11:42,568
And that led me to you,
Jessica Damon.

203
00:11:42,592 --> 00:11:43,854
Okay.

204
00:11:43,897 --> 00:11:46,204
You have a
suspiciousactivity report

205
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:49,250
connecting youto a $10,000
cash withdrawal.

206
00:11:50,295 --> 00:11:51,775
Yes, yep.

207
00:11:53,864 --> 00:11:55,387
I bought a ring.

208
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,649
For my girlfriend.

209
00:11:56,693 --> 00:11:58,608
Yeah, I wasgonna propose,

210
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:02,263
but... she broke up
with me, so...

211
00:12:02,307 --> 00:12:03,308
Well, sorry.

212
00:12:03,351 --> 00:12:04,352
It's okay.

213
00:12:04,396 --> 00:12:05,528
I'll survive.

214
00:12:05,571 --> 00:12:07,355
And in regards
to Guiding Hope,

215
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:09,183
your recent,
cash revenue increase,

216
00:12:09,227 --> 00:12:10,378
that-that caught
my attention, as well.

217
00:12:10,402 --> 00:12:12,056
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

218
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:14,275
So, we,
we recently started a...

219
00:12:14,319 --> 00:12:16,060
dog grooming service.

220
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:17,167
Yeah. And it's mobile.

221
00:12:17,191 --> 00:12:19,890
So we can go to the dogs.

222
00:12:19,933 --> 00:12:21,761
Dogs can come to us.
It's on wheels.

223
00:12:21,805 --> 00:12:23,328
And then all
of our proceeds

224
00:12:23,371 --> 00:12:24,479
are going to our
guide dog school, so...

225
00:12:24,503 --> 00:12:25,654
Yes, we're gonna
shampoo, conditioner.

226
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:26,699
It's all, you know...

227
00:12:26,723 --> 00:12:27,680
And it's been...

228
00:12:27,724 --> 00:12:28,725
awesome.

229
00:12:28,768 --> 00:12:29,987
It's doing really well.

230
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,486
Like, very...
It's super successful.

231
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,120
Really, really well.

232
00:12:33,164 --> 00:12:35,514
There you go... engagement
ring, dog grooming.

233
00:12:35,558 --> 00:12:37,342
I think we're done here.

234
00:12:37,385 --> 00:12:38,691
That's it?

235
00:12:38,735 --> 00:12:40,277
Well, actually...
Yeah, that's it.

236
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,216
Just send us the books
to back that up

237
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,499
when you have a chance.
Our address is on the card.

238
00:12:44,523 --> 00:12:46,307
And you owe melunch now.

239
00:12:47,918 --> 00:12:49,330
Thanks very
muchfor your time.

240
00:12:49,354 --> 00:12:50,505
Yes, of course. No problem.

241
00:12:50,529 --> 00:12:53,576
Thank you.

242
00:12:53,619 --> 00:12:55,926
Enjoy the States.

243
00:12:57,449 --> 00:12:59,059
Are they gone?

244
00:12:59,103 --> 00:13:01,235
I think I'm gonna throw up.

245
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,195
So, come on, why
are you really here?

246
00:13:04,238 --> 00:13:05,805
Do you need money?

247
00:13:05,849 --> 00:13:07,241
No, actually.

248
00:13:07,285 --> 00:13:09,679
My company
is doing extremely well.

249
00:13:11,289 --> 00:13:12,377
And how are you?

250
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,379
Good.

251
00:13:14,422 --> 00:13:16,773
Still single, I presume?

252
00:13:16,816 --> 00:13:18,905
Actually, I...

253
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:21,081
have a girlfriend.

254
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:22,213
No, you don't.

255
00:13:23,693 --> 00:13:26,783
Shall I open up yourfavorite
Bordeaux for you?

256
00:13:26,826 --> 00:13:29,089
Okay, she's not,
like, officially

257
00:13:29,133 --> 00:13:31,396
my girlfriend, but I am...

258
00:13:31,439 --> 00:13:33,224
seeing someone.

259
00:13:33,267 --> 00:13:34,878
Pretty serious.

260
00:13:34,921 --> 00:13:37,837
Is it that,
Jess friend of yours?

261
00:13:37,881 --> 00:13:40,057
Nope, she's still gay.

262
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,146
Who isn't these days?

263
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:43,974
Her name is Chelsea.

264
00:13:44,017 --> 00:13:45,976
What does
Chelsea do for work?

265
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:47,586
She's a bartender.

266
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,849
Fee.

267
00:13:49,893 --> 00:13:51,653
Unlike you and everyone else
in this family,

268
00:13:51,677 --> 00:13:54,047
I like people for who they
are, not for their pedigree.

269
00:13:54,071 --> 00:13:55,768
Just use protection, okay?

270
00:13:55,812 --> 00:13:58,466
I don't need you knocking
upsome bartender, okay?

271
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,555
I need... I need
a gun. What?

272
00:14:00,599 --> 00:14:02,862
I need a gun.
That's why I'm here.

273
00:14:02,906 --> 00:14:04,168
Okay, Mom? I need a gun.

274
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:06,257
Why?

275
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,129
Because there's a vagrant
in my building's alleyway

276
00:14:09,173 --> 00:14:12,306
threatening me,
and I told the cops.

277
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,743
They don't do anything.

278
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:14,874
And I just...

279
00:14:14,918 --> 00:14:17,572
want to feel safe, so...

280
00:14:17,616 --> 00:14:19,270
here I am.

281
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:23,491
I'm proud of you.

282
00:14:23,535 --> 00:14:26,581
You have a right
to defend yourself.

283
00:14:31,151 --> 00:14:33,501
Well, he couldn't
have gone far.

284
00:14:33,545 --> 00:14:35,199
So that means we're close?

285
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,071
Wow, that's exciting.

286
00:14:38,115 --> 00:14:40,552
Listen,
I'm gonna check the motels.

287
00:14:40,595 --> 00:14:43,400
Why don't you search the mall
and the surrounding wherever?

288
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,730
You think he's in there?

289
00:14:44,774 --> 00:14:45,824
What, is he shopping?

290
00:14:45,862 --> 00:14:48,560
Just cover your bases, okay?

291
00:14:52,564 --> 00:14:54,392
I'll do that.

292
00:14:57,663 --> 00:15:00,317
What would you say your
most valuable trait is?

293
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:02,095
I'm very punctual

294
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:05,229
and, loyal, I guess.

295
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:07,294
You don't have
any food service experience?

296
00:15:07,318 --> 00:15:09,233
That's true.

297
00:15:09,276 --> 00:15:11,211
But you didn't have
food service experience

298
00:15:11,235 --> 00:15:12,932
till someone took
a chance on you.

299
00:15:12,976 --> 00:15:14,281
Yeah.

300
00:15:14,325 --> 00:15:17,067
Um, you don't have
any references on here.

301
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:19,634
That's 'cause the,
template I used

302
00:15:19,678 --> 00:15:21,090
didn't have a space
for references.

303
00:15:21,114 --> 00:15:22,942
Look, Darnell...

304
00:15:22,986 --> 00:15:25,162
Wait...

305
00:15:25,205 --> 00:15:27,077
I've been on ten of these.

306
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,166
I knowmy résumé sucks,

307
00:15:29,209 --> 00:15:30,733
but I really need a job.

308
00:15:30,776 --> 00:15:32,343
I will work really hard.

309
00:15:33,387 --> 00:15:35,520
Okay.

310
00:15:35,563 --> 00:15:37,740
I... got to get back.

311
00:15:47,924 --> 00:15:50,274
Do you think
they bought it?

312
00:15:50,317 --> 00:15:52,276
They seemed to.

313
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:55,235
Nice lie, by the way,
with the, engagement ring.

314
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,020
Thank you.

315
00:15:58,325 --> 00:16:00,023
I really...

316
00:16:00,066 --> 00:16:01,589
I really do thinkwe're fine,

317
00:16:01,633 --> 00:16:03,872
but we should just...
to be safe, we should just

318
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:05,613
get the truck ready
as soon as possible.

319
00:16:05,637 --> 00:16:07,595
Yeah... I know.

320
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:09,249
I-I'm trying.

321
00:16:09,293 --> 00:16:11,184
Where the hell
is Felix? Probably buying

322
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,229
17th-century armor for his
nonexistent battle with Sam.

323
00:16:13,253 --> 00:16:14,820
Just have your
wifey help you.

324
00:16:14,864 --> 00:16:16,126
No, I...

325
00:16:16,169 --> 00:16:17,867
I can't, I can't
be around her.

326
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,279
It's a phys-physical
problem.

327
00:16:19,303 --> 00:16:20,608
What was that?

328
00:16:20,652 --> 00:16:22,499
Yesterday, I masturbated
to her Instagram.

329
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:23,611
Jess!

330
00:16:23,655 --> 00:16:26,136
I know, I'm gross.

331
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:31,663
What are you guys doing?

332
00:16:31,706 --> 00:16:33,360
Nothing.
Hey, that dude's here

333
00:16:33,404 --> 00:16:35,449
to see you.

334
00:16:35,493 --> 00:16:37,190
You got to be more specific.

335
00:16:37,234 --> 00:16:39,976
Bruh.

336
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:41,499
Come on, Pretzel.

337
00:16:50,203 --> 00:16:51,204
Murphy.

338
00:16:51,248 --> 00:16:52,902
It's Josh Wallace.

339
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:55,252
We met earlier.

340
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,819
Have you got a second?

341
00:17:04,967 --> 00:17:07,361
So, what's up?
Did you see I took out $20

342
00:17:07,405 --> 00:17:09,494
from an ATM three years ago
or something?

343
00:17:09,537 --> 00:17:10,930
No, it's my dog, Oliver.

344
00:17:10,973 --> 00:17:12,714
He could use a bath
and a haircut,

345
00:17:12,758 --> 00:17:14,542
so I thought I'd give this,

346
00:17:14,586 --> 00:17:15,936
this grooming service a go.

347
00:17:17,153 --> 00:17:18,503
Hi, Oliver.

348
00:17:18,546 --> 00:17:20,244
I tied him
to a bench outside.

349
00:17:20,287 --> 00:17:22,507
I saw your
"service dogs only" sign.

350
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,335
A rule follower.

351
00:17:24,378 --> 00:17:26,032
Love it...

352
00:17:26,075 --> 00:17:28,600
Yeah, why don't you just
give me a second.

353
00:17:28,643 --> 00:17:29,751
I'm gonna go talk with Jess.

354
00:17:29,775 --> 00:17:31,405
She... she takes care
of our grooming.

355
00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:32,821
I'll grab Ollie.

356
00:17:32,865 --> 00:17:34,736
Okay.

357
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,999
Great.

358
00:17:39,175 --> 00:17:41,177
Find outside.

359
00:17:48,794 --> 00:17:50,709
Hey, Ollie.

360
00:17:53,451 --> 00:17:54,843
Jess!

361
00:17:56,584 --> 00:17:58,238
Don't freak out.

362
00:17:59,283 --> 00:18:00,477
The guy from
the IRS is back.

363
00:18:00,501 --> 00:18:02,024
And he brought his dog.

364
00:18:02,068 --> 00:18:03,635
And he wants us to groom it.

365
00:18:03,678 --> 00:18:05,177
Well, tell him that...
that we're busy,

366
00:18:05,201 --> 00:18:06,701
that we're booked up
and that we're busy

367
00:18:06,725 --> 00:18:08,268
or whatever!
No, he walked by the truck.

368
00:18:08,292 --> 00:18:10,292
He must have seen
that it was not in use.

369
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,776
You're just gonna
haveto groom the dog.

370
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,059
Where? We don't have a
grooming truck, Murphy.

371
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:19,670
All that we have is a-a mini
fridge and a cutting board.

372
00:18:19,694 --> 00:18:22,064
And most importantly, I don't
know how to groom a dog!

373
00:18:22,088 --> 00:18:23,674
Don't they teach you that
in vet school?

374
00:18:23,698 --> 00:18:25,700
They do not.

375
00:18:25,744 --> 00:18:27,702
Sterling.

376
00:18:27,746 --> 00:18:29,835
She know...

377
00:18:29,878 --> 00:18:31,358
She knows how to do it.

378
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:32,664
Your spank bank Sterling?

379
00:18:32,707 --> 00:18:35,101
Yes. I looked at her résumé.

380
00:18:35,144 --> 00:18:36,687
She worked at
PetSmart for a year.

381
00:18:36,711 --> 00:18:38,907
Just put your boner away
and get her to help you.

382
00:18:38,931 --> 00:18:40,367
No, I don't... Come with me!

383
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:41,760
Murphy...

384
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:52,116
I don't know what more
to tell you.

385
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,360
Hi... again.Hi.

386
00:18:54,403 --> 00:18:55,946
Jess here is gonna
take Oliver back

387
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:58,016
and give him a nice cut
and a bath.

388
00:18:58,059 --> 00:18:59,459
Thanks for squeezing him in.

389
00:18:59,495 --> 00:19:02,934
Of course. We had alast-minute
cancellation, so...

390
00:19:02,977 --> 00:19:06,198
Hi, mister.Hi. Okay, well,

391
00:19:06,241 --> 00:19:08,983
we're gonna
takegood care of you.

392
00:19:09,027 --> 00:19:11,551
Come on.

393
00:19:11,594 --> 00:19:14,641
Well, I didn't even ask
how much it is.

394
00:19:14,684 --> 00:19:18,166
30. It's 30.That's it?

395
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:19,689
That's why we're so popular.

396
00:19:19,733 --> 00:19:21,493
So you can just,
you can just come back

397
00:19:21,517 --> 00:19:22,779
in about an hour or so,

398
00:19:22,823 --> 00:19:24,148
and he'll beall
nice and pretty.

399
00:19:24,172 --> 00:19:26,871
Well, I'd like to stay,
if that's all right.

400
00:19:26,914 --> 00:19:28,614
And maybe you could
give me a tour?

401
00:19:31,266 --> 00:19:33,225
Be delighted.

402
00:19:34,182 --> 00:19:37,229
Okay, now...

403
00:19:37,272 --> 00:19:40,058
the pistol has
more mag capacity,

404
00:19:40,101 --> 00:19:43,148
but the revolver has
fewer jam issues.

405
00:19:43,191 --> 00:19:44,932
Which one do you want?

406
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:48,109
The one with fewerjam
issues, I guess.

407
00:19:49,937 --> 00:19:52,113
Okay.

408
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:54,246
Do you need me to show
you how to use it?

409
00:19:54,289 --> 00:19:55,943
No. I think I got it.

410
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:57,989
Are you sure, now?
Mom, I got it.

411
00:19:58,032 --> 00:19:59,904
Thank you.

412
00:19:59,947 --> 00:20:01,383
That cold front that hit

413
00:20:01,427 --> 00:20:04,386
Northern Illinois last night
is still going strong.

414
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:07,346
We will be dealing witha
large amount of snow and sleet

415
00:20:07,389 --> 00:20:09,522
with highs today
in the low 30s.

416
00:20:09,565 --> 00:20:12,264
Freezing temperatures...

417
00:20:16,224 --> 00:20:18,072
Hey, is there...
is there anywhere close

418
00:20:18,096 --> 00:20:20,968
I can order a pizza from?

419
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:23,188
Thanks.

420
00:20:26,234 --> 00:20:29,063
Hi, Oliver.

421
00:20:29,107 --> 00:20:30,804
Hi.

422
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,762
I, thought this
wasa grooming van.

423
00:20:32,806 --> 00:20:34,286
It is. Yeah.

424
00:20:34,329 --> 00:20:36,027
Um, well, I'm making it one.

425
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:39,334
Yeah, that guy is, like,
a really big donor,

426
00:20:39,378 --> 00:20:43,948
so we may have... inflated
the readiness of the van.

427
00:20:43,991 --> 00:20:45,384
So you lied to your donor?

428
00:20:45,427 --> 00:20:47,212
Yeah.

429
00:20:47,255 --> 00:20:49,170
Okay, good.
'Cause that makes me feel

430
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:51,192
a lot better aboutlying
on my résumé.What?

431
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:52,434
What do you mean?

432
00:20:52,478 --> 00:20:55,220
I sort of never,
worked at PetSmart.

433
00:20:55,263 --> 00:20:56,221
Okay.

434
00:20:56,264 --> 00:20:58,136
Yeah. I just, I really

435
00:20:58,179 --> 00:20:59,180
needed this job.

436
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:01,443
Hey,
we'll-we'llfigure it out.

437
00:21:01,487 --> 00:21:02,967
How hard could it be?

438
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,925
Lavender hand soap.

439
00:21:04,969 --> 00:21:06,840
We're good.

440
00:21:06,883 --> 00:21:08,363
Yeah.

441
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:13,238
And then this is
our training area,

442
00:21:13,281 --> 00:21:16,284
where we, you know,
train the dogs and stuff.

443
00:21:16,328 --> 00:21:19,896
About how many dogs
do you raise a year?

444
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,898
A hundred or so.

445
00:21:21,942 --> 00:21:23,988
A hundred. Wow.

446
00:21:24,031 --> 00:21:26,227
'Cause I read, as technology
is advancing more and more,

447
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:27,924
people won't really need
guide dogs.

448
00:21:27,948 --> 00:21:29,882
What with Uber and Postmates
and all that.

449
00:21:29,906 --> 00:21:32,474
Not here.

450
00:21:32,518 --> 00:21:34,085
Well, that's the tour.

451
00:21:34,128 --> 00:21:35,695
Short.

452
00:21:35,738 --> 00:21:37,958
Well, I guess
I'll just wait here

453
00:21:38,002 --> 00:21:39,090
until Ollie's done.

454
00:21:39,133 --> 00:21:41,048
Do you want a
pop or something?

455
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:42,180
A what?

456
00:21:42,223 --> 00:21:43,616
A soda.

457
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:03,592
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Mystery man</i></font>

458
00:22:05,594 --> 00:22:09,468
<font color="#ffff00"><i>In a forsaken land</i></font>

459
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:14,299
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Hold a gun to his head</i></font>

460
00:22:15,691 --> 00:22:18,085
<font color="#ffff00"><i>But you won't</i></font>

461
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:20,348
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Shoot him dead...</i></font>

462
00:22:23,351 --> 00:22:25,179
I'm starving.

463
00:22:28,443 --> 00:22:30,271
Max, it's over.

464
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:32,230
You're under arrest.

465
00:22:35,728 --> 00:22:36,860
Stop!

466
00:22:38,905 --> 00:22:40,428
Come on, man.

467
00:23:02,189 --> 00:23:04,104
You have the right
to remain silent.

468
00:23:04,148 --> 00:23:05,821
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

469
00:23:05,845 --> 00:23:07,170
in a court of law.
Yeah, I got it.

470
00:23:07,194 --> 00:23:08,650
You have the right
to an attorney.

471
00:23:08,674 --> 00:23:11,324
If you can't afford an
attorney, one will be provided.

472
00:23:22,712 --> 00:23:25,062
Don't touch me.

473
00:23:38,206 --> 00:23:39,729
You gotta be kidding me.

474
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,691
Do you have service?

475
00:23:44,734 --> 00:23:46,562
Does it look like
I have a phone?

476
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:49,956
It's not gonna work.

477
00:23:49,981 --> 00:23:51,339
Can you shut
up for a second?

478
00:23:51,364 --> 00:23:52,854
Or what, you're
gonna kill me?

479
00:23:53,434 --> 00:23:54,644
What did you just say?

480
00:23:54,669 --> 00:23:57,369
Or do you reserve that kind
of treatment for teenagers?

481
00:24:00,706 --> 00:24:01,893
Hello?!

482
00:24:02,363 --> 00:24:04,278
Help!

483
00:24:05,968 --> 00:24:08,884
Can anyone hear me?
We're on the elevator.

484
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,076
Do many clients come by,

485
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,415
or is it justmainly
employees?

486
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,789
No, they're usually here.

487
00:24:15,108 --> 00:24:17,501
Yeah, we're
justbetween litters.

488
00:24:17,545 --> 00:24:19,373
But once we
getsome new puppies,

489
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:22,071
then there'll be lots of...
lots of, clients

490
00:24:22,115 --> 00:24:24,944
and puppy
raisersand trainers.

491
00:24:24,987 --> 00:24:27,033
It's a whole thing.
It's really special.

492
00:24:27,076 --> 00:24:28,967
And do most people who
have lost their sight,

493
00:24:28,991 --> 00:24:30,079
they use guide dogs?

494
00:24:30,123 --> 00:24:33,387
Most peoplethat
come here. Yeah.

495
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,180
And you give the
dogs away for free?

496
00:24:35,215 --> 00:24:36,912
I read your brochure.

497
00:24:36,956 --> 00:24:38,716
Yeah, we don't... we
don't believe in-in...

498
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:41,874
in, you know, charging
peoplefor such a beautiful gift.

499
00:24:41,917 --> 00:24:42,875
How do you afford it?

500
00:24:42,918 --> 00:24:44,354
We have a lot of donors

501
00:24:44,398 --> 00:24:46,008
and, the grooming truck,

502
00:24:46,052 --> 00:24:47,899
which is doing
really well, like I said.

503
00:24:47,923 --> 00:24:49,422
And I'm gonna go
checkwhat's taking so long.

504
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:52,232
Okay, Pretzel, find
outside, find outside.

505
00:25:00,109 --> 00:25:01,110
What?

506
00:25:01,154 --> 00:25:03,156
He's not a frying pan.

507
00:25:03,199 --> 00:25:05,898
Do you have a... Do you
have a better suggestion?

508
00:25:09,902 --> 00:25:12,078
How dare you.

509
00:25:12,121 --> 00:25:14,099
This is my officialGuiding
Hope uniform.

510
00:25:14,123 --> 00:25:16,038
Felix told meit's
very expensive.

511
00:25:16,082 --> 00:25:18,258
I'm sure he did.

512
00:25:20,129 --> 00:25:22,001
I'm so sorry
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

513
00:25:22,044 --> 00:25:23,544
Let me see.
That actually hurt.

514
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,227
What is taking so long?

515
00:25:31,271 --> 00:25:33,012
We're just... We're
just grooming.

516
00:25:33,055 --> 00:25:34,709
Well, groom faster.

517
00:25:34,752 --> 00:25:36,905
Mary Poppins is asking me
a million questions.

518
00:25:36,929 --> 00:25:38,104
Okay.

519
00:25:40,676 --> 00:25:43,461
We should probably
finish this.

520
00:25:43,505 --> 00:25:45,463
Right.

521
00:25:55,948 --> 00:25:57,384
Can you stop that, please?

522
00:26:00,304 --> 00:26:02,306
You know, I can
help you, Max.

523
00:26:03,917 --> 00:26:06,136
I can ease your sentence

524
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:10,576
if you give me information
about Nia's organization.

525
00:26:20,214 --> 00:26:22,167
You still there?

526
00:26:22,979 --> 00:26:26,026
Hello? Yeah, sorry.
I nodded.

527
00:26:26,069 --> 00:26:28,115
I should've realized
not-not to do that.

528
00:26:28,158 --> 00:26:31,335
It's fine. They're
almost done, so...

529
00:26:36,123 --> 00:26:37,733
Can I ask you a question?

530
00:26:37,777 --> 00:26:40,954
Another one? Sure.

531
00:26:41,998 --> 00:26:43,783
What's being blind like?

532
00:26:43,826 --> 00:26:46,046
What's being blind like?

533
00:26:46,089 --> 00:26:47,874
Like how do Imatch my socks,

534
00:26:47,917 --> 00:26:49,484
or am I depressedall
the time?

535
00:26:49,527 --> 00:26:51,201
I'm sorry. I know.
I shouldn't have asked.

536
00:26:51,225 --> 00:26:53,009
It's okay.

537
00:26:53,053 --> 00:26:54,576
People ask me that a lot.

538
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:57,492
I don't knowhow to answer,

539
00:26:57,535 --> 00:27:00,538
besides just my... my norm.

540
00:27:00,582 --> 00:27:03,411
I have to be honest,
I'm-I'm...

541
00:27:03,454 --> 00:27:04,693
I'm kind of amazed by you.

542
00:27:04,717 --> 00:27:08,503
I don't know.
I don't know. I...

543
00:27:08,546 --> 00:27:12,028
That's why you
came back. What?

544
00:27:12,072 --> 00:27:14,422
You want to
have sex with me.

545
00:27:14,465 --> 00:27:17,077
I'm sorry? No. It's okay.

546
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,707
You think I came here
to have sex with you?

547
00:27:18,731 --> 00:27:20,123
Yeah, you did.

548
00:27:20,167 --> 00:27:22,212
You looked at my
photoon the website,

549
00:27:22,256 --> 00:27:23,537
and you thought, "Never
boned a blind chick."

550
00:27:23,561 --> 00:27:24,606
Here you are.

551
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:27,217
What? What?
That's highly offensive.

552
00:27:27,261 --> 00:27:29,611
I definitely don't
want to do that.

553
00:27:29,655 --> 00:27:32,353
And I wouldn't prey on
someone with a disability.

554
00:27:32,396 --> 00:27:33,354
Come on.

555
00:27:33,397 --> 00:27:35,835
No. I have to go.

556
00:27:35,878 --> 00:27:37,663
Hang on, please. Don't...

557
00:27:37,706 --> 00:27:39,403
It's... I didn't... I...

558
00:27:52,547 --> 00:27:54,288
Hello.

559
00:28:01,175 --> 00:28:02,456
That guy could
put us in jail.

560
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,631
Yeah, I thought
I was giving him

561
00:28:03,655 --> 00:28:04,806
what he wanted.
Sorry. What he wanted?!

562
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,880
Hey. Did you guys
havean actual customer?

563
00:28:08,351 --> 00:28:09,874
Let's go in your office.

564
00:28:09,918 --> 00:28:11,310
That guy was from

565
00:28:11,354 --> 00:28:12,964
the IRS?

566
00:28:13,008 --> 00:28:14,879
Why? Why? Why?

567
00:28:14,923 --> 00:28:17,205
Why? What was he doing here?
Why did you groom his dog?

568
00:28:17,229 --> 00:28:18,990
He was looking into
whywe have so much

569
00:28:19,014 --> 00:28:20,319
excess cash revenue.

570
00:28:20,363 --> 00:28:21,993
So I told him it
wasbecause of the success

571
00:28:22,017 --> 00:28:23,453
of our grooming truck.

572
00:28:23,497 --> 00:28:24,822
Yeah, and then he brought
his dog in to get groomed.

573
00:28:24,846 --> 00:28:25,910
And then once he realized
that we didn't know

574
00:28:25,934 --> 00:28:26,954
what we were doing,
he stormed out?

575
00:28:26,978 --> 00:28:28,763
No, he stormed
outbecause I thought

576
00:28:28,806 --> 00:28:31,263
he wanted to have sex with
me, but apparently he didn't.

577
00:28:31,287 --> 00:28:32,244
You tried to have sex
with someone

578
00:28:32,288 --> 00:28:33,985
that can put us in prison?

579
00:28:34,029 --> 00:28:36,311
Of course, because she can't keep
it in her pants. I will fix it!

580
00:28:36,335 --> 00:28:39,774
I leave for three hours,
and everything falls apart.

581
00:28:39,817 --> 00:28:42,167
Felix, where were
you? Where did you go?

582
00:28:51,394 --> 00:28:52,264
You bought a gun?

583
00:28:52,308 --> 00:28:53,614
What?! Are you kidding me?

584
00:28:53,657 --> 00:28:55,877
I borrowed a gun
from my mom.

585
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,052
You got a mom gun?

586
00:28:57,095 --> 00:28:59,097
It's a...
It was my dad's gun.

587
00:28:59,141 --> 00:29:01,186
It's a dad gun.
To protect us.

588
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,145
Felix...

589
00:29:04,146 --> 00:29:05,626
you know that having a gun

590
00:29:05,669 --> 00:29:07,105
makes you more likely...

591
00:29:07,149 --> 00:29:08,692
to be the victim
of gun violence.

592
00:29:08,716 --> 00:29:11,458
Yes, I do know that, but...

593
00:29:11,501 --> 00:29:13,198
it makes me feel safe, okay?

594
00:29:13,242 --> 00:29:15,046
You are not having a
gun in this building.

595
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,656
I have to put it somewhere.
Well, then, I don't...

596
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,310
Where? Where do you...
Wait, wait. I don't know.

597
00:29:18,334 --> 00:29:19,335
Put it in the truck.

598
00:29:19,378 --> 00:29:20,379
I'll show you where.

599
00:29:20,423 --> 00:29:21,990
Murphy,

600
00:29:22,033 --> 00:29:24,427
you have to deal with
the guy from the IRS.

601
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:26,124
Yeah. Like, now.

602
00:29:27,169 --> 00:29:30,520
Say more obvious
things, Felix.

603
00:29:32,391 --> 00:29:33,499
This will work, right? Sure.

604
00:29:33,523 --> 00:29:34,916
Okay.

605
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:39,311
Okay, let's go.

606
00:29:44,273 --> 00:29:45,709
No way.

607
00:29:45,753 --> 00:29:47,363
Trey?

608
00:29:47,406 --> 00:29:49,602
I almost didn't recognize
you with that bald-ass head.

609
00:29:49,626 --> 00:29:51,454
It's been forever.

610
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:53,108
I know.
How's your sister?

611
00:29:53,151 --> 00:29:54,738
She's good, she's good.
Two kids now.

612
00:29:54,762 --> 00:29:56,415
Wow. We getting old? Yeah.

613
00:29:56,459 --> 00:29:57,895
Yeah. Old as hell.

614
00:29:57,939 --> 00:29:59,482
Yo, what's up with
the suit, man?

615
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:01,353
Nia got y'all dressing
up for work now?

616
00:30:01,377 --> 00:30:03,292
Actually, I don't work
for Nia anymore.

617
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:04,336
Wow.
Yeah.

618
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,531
I mean, I work for Josiah.

619
00:30:05,555 --> 00:30:07,165
I can put it in
a word for you.

620
00:30:07,209 --> 00:30:08,403
Nah, nah, I'm good.
I'm trying

621
00:30:08,427 --> 00:30:09,753
to get out the whole game,
you know?

622
00:30:09,777 --> 00:30:11,300
For real?
Yeah.

623
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:13,302
I never thought I'd
hear you say that.

624
00:30:13,345 --> 00:30:15,652
Look, give me
a call. All right.

625
00:30:15,696 --> 00:30:18,196
Let's go grab a beer. All right?
All right, for sure. All right, man.

626
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,198
Listen, don't do that
thing you did last time.

627
00:30:20,222 --> 00:30:22,200
That was you. You kept me
waiting for, like, four weeks!

628
00:30:22,224 --> 00:30:24,624
Stop! Stop! Four and a half
weeks, brah. Come on!

629
00:30:29,971 --> 00:30:31,973
Hello?

630
00:30:34,758 --> 00:30:37,544
Wait. Seriously?

631
00:30:39,371 --> 00:30:41,896
Yeah. Yeah,
I-I can start tomorrow.

632
00:30:41,939 --> 00:30:43,898
Yeah. All right. Hey.

633
00:30:43,941 --> 00:30:45,682
Thank you very much.

634
00:30:45,726 --> 00:30:48,337
All right, thank you.
All right, bye.

635
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:53,429
I'm starving.

636
00:30:53,472 --> 00:30:55,494
You couldn't have arrested
meafter I got my pizza?

637
00:30:55,518 --> 00:30:58,018
You really want to spend the
next ten years in prison?

638
00:30:58,042 --> 00:30:59,000
Stop.

639
00:30:59,043 --> 00:31:00,828
Just stop trying.

640
00:31:00,871 --> 00:31:02,569
I'm never gonna
work with you.

641
00:31:02,612 --> 00:31:04,396
After what you
did to Murphy.

642
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,835
You know, you should
stopbeing so loyal to Murphy.

643
00:31:08,984 --> 00:31:12,335
You know, I didn't
want to tell you this.

644
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,535
Tell me what?

645
00:31:14,058 --> 00:31:15,451
The day afteryou left,

646
00:31:15,494 --> 00:31:19,237
Murphy sort of
threw herself at me.

647
00:31:19,281 --> 00:31:20,958
That's not true.

648
00:31:21,082 --> 00:31:22,083
We had sex.

649
00:31:22,751 --> 00:31:24,710
Okay.

650
00:31:26,549 --> 00:31:30,553
She has this cute little
birthmark on her right hip.

651
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:32,860
Sort of shapedlike a moon.

652
00:31:36,472 --> 00:31:38,722
I think we have more in
common than you think.

653
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,656
- Hang tight.
- We're gonna get you out.

654
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:50,878
Please tell me we don't
have to groom another dog.

655
00:31:50,921 --> 00:31:53,489
I want to show
you something.

656
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:57,101
Look.

657
00:31:57,145 --> 00:31:59,538
Easier to bathe the dogs in.

658
00:31:59,582 --> 00:32:01,758
What are you doing?
I know your friends

659
00:32:01,802 --> 00:32:03,412
think you can
fix up this truck

660
00:32:03,455 --> 00:32:06,545
because you're gay,
but you, obviously can't.

661
00:32:06,589 --> 00:32:08,219
No, no, I can't.
Can you? Because...

662
00:32:08,243 --> 00:32:11,376
I don't know. But, it'san
excuse to hang out with you.

663
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:13,117
And once we actually learn

664
00:32:13,161 --> 00:32:15,424
how to cut dog hair,
we can do it here.

665
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:18,383
And there's, like, storage
everywhere in this thing.

666
00:32:18,427 --> 00:32:23,427
For shampoo and-and stupid
doggy bandanas or whatever.

667
00:32:26,304 --> 00:32:27,741
Hey.

668
00:32:27,784 --> 00:32:28,829
What?

669
00:32:30,439 --> 00:32:31,875
Come here.

670
00:32:35,487 --> 00:32:37,489
Yeah?

671
00:33:05,387 --> 00:33:08,564
Max, you have a
chance to start over.

672
00:33:08,607 --> 00:33:10,697
Don't throw your life away
for her.

673
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,742
I know that you
thinkthat she loves you,

674
00:33:12,786 --> 00:33:13,961
but Murphyis incapable

675
00:33:14,004 --> 00:33:15,527
of loving anyone
but herself.

676
00:33:18,922 --> 00:33:20,726
Look, I know you have
something on Nia.

677
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,467
Something big enough
to put her away.

678
00:33:22,491 --> 00:33:24,295
You wouldn't have been such
a valuable informant to Sarah

679
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:27,539
if you didn't,
so what is it?

680
00:33:29,933 --> 00:33:32,283
I know where
Nia's stash house is.

681
00:33:32,327 --> 00:33:33,763
How?

682
00:33:33,807 --> 00:33:35,654
Someone in your position
would ever know that.

683
00:33:35,678 --> 00:33:37,221
They gave me a burner
when I started,

684
00:33:37,245 --> 00:33:39,310
and I got a text from
someone in her organization.

685
00:33:39,334 --> 00:33:40,727
It wasn't meant for me.

686
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:42,206
Does Nia know about this?

687
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:44,208
No one does.

688
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:51,215
I will tell you
under one condition.

689
00:33:51,259 --> 00:33:52,758
When we get
out of this elevator,

690
00:33:52,782 --> 00:33:54,697
I want you to get me
a new passport.

691
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,719
I need a fresh start.
Totally clean record.

692
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:57,894
I'll tell you
everything I know

693
00:33:57,918 --> 00:33:59,746
the second
you deliver that to me.

694
00:34:01,299 --> 00:34:04,912
Okay, but no one can knowl
found you today. No one.

695
00:34:04,955 --> 00:34:06,522
You run, it's over. No deal.

696
00:34:06,547 --> 00:34:09,158
Got it?
Got it.

697
00:34:10,626 --> 00:34:12,802
Freeze!

698
00:34:12,846 --> 00:34:15,196
Max Parish,
you're under arrest.

699
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,675
What's up, D?

700
00:34:21,035 --> 00:34:22,907
You can call ita
hunch, I guess.

701
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:24,474
Thank you.

702
00:34:26,557 --> 00:34:28,515
Mira. Mira.

703
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:29,908
What the hell happened?

704
00:34:29,952 --> 00:34:31,364
I told you to
stay at the mall.

705
00:34:31,388 --> 00:34:33,148
Man, I didn't hear from you
for a few hours,

706
00:34:33,172 --> 00:34:35,020
and I thought you might've
beenin trouble and needed backup.

707
00:34:35,044 --> 00:34:36,306
So I tracked your car.

708
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,136
Look, I know
what I'm doing.

709
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:41,528
You can trust me.

710
00:34:41,572 --> 00:34:43,487
Great. Thank you.

711
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:45,508
Of course. I got your back,
always. I told you.

712
00:34:45,532 --> 00:34:47,162
I keep telling you that.
I don't know how many times

713
00:34:47,186 --> 00:34:48,685
I got to keep telling you
I got your back,

714
00:34:48,709 --> 00:34:50,009
but you got to utilize me.

715
00:34:52,713 --> 00:34:53,802
Yeah?

716
00:34:53,845 --> 00:34:55,978
Murphy Mason
is here to see you.

717
00:34:59,982 --> 00:35:02,767
Hi, Murphy.

718
00:35:02,811 --> 00:35:04,987
Hey.

719
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,573
How's the rest
of your day going?

720
00:35:06,597 --> 00:35:08,033
It's fine.

721
00:35:08,077 --> 00:35:11,558
What are youdoing here?

722
00:35:11,602 --> 00:35:14,997
Look, I, I came to
apologize about earlier.

723
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,844
I shouldn't, I shouldn't
have said those things.

724
00:35:16,868 --> 00:35:19,131
It's okay. It's
not, but I am

725
00:35:19,175 --> 00:35:21,830
just in a bad place
romantically or whatever.

726
00:35:21,873 --> 00:35:23,273
Seemed like
it. And I'm sorry

727
00:35:23,309 --> 00:35:25,268
about your dog.

728
00:35:25,311 --> 00:35:27,270
Our groomer is new
and overwhelmed,

729
00:35:27,313 --> 00:35:29,074
and we're just
working out some kinks.

730
00:35:29,098 --> 00:35:31,665
Yeah. So again, I'm sorry.

731
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,018
So are we good? 'Cause...

732
00:35:36,061 --> 00:35:38,257
'Cause I apologized
for the sex thing. You did.

733
00:35:38,281 --> 00:35:40,239
And the dog thing. I know.

734
00:35:40,283 --> 00:35:41,826
And I answered all
of your questions.

735
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:44,200
That's correct. But I
still feel weirdness?

736
00:35:44,243 --> 00:35:46,637
No weirdness.

737
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,379
Then what is it?

738
00:35:49,422 --> 00:35:50,815
Okay, look...

739
00:35:50,859 --> 00:35:52,599
When Guiding Hope

740
00:35:52,643 --> 00:35:55,317
came across my desk, I started
looking into what you do.

741
00:35:55,341 --> 00:35:57,741
And it should have beena
five-minute phone call,

742
00:35:57,778 --> 00:35:59,737
but, well, I had
to come see you guys

743
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,304
because...

744
00:36:02,348 --> 00:36:04,873
I'm sort of...

745
00:36:06,918 --> 00:36:09,921
I'm sort of losing
my eyesight.

746
00:36:09,965 --> 00:36:11,227
And I'm gonna

747
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:14,273
keep losingmy eyesight.

748
00:36:16,972 --> 00:36:19,322
That sucks. That sucks.

749
00:36:19,365 --> 00:36:20,690
Well, I thoughtit
would make...

750
00:36:20,714 --> 00:36:22,281
make it easier, you know,

751
00:36:22,325 --> 00:36:23,935
coming inwith work, but...

752
00:36:23,979 --> 00:36:27,852
I see. Um, well, did it?

753
00:36:27,896 --> 00:36:32,291
No. But hey, look, a-at
least I met a blind person.

754
00:36:35,251 --> 00:36:37,731
You're actually
the first person I've told.

755
00:36:40,125 --> 00:36:41,648
Wow.

756
00:36:41,692 --> 00:36:46,305
But I used my positioninappropriately,
and I'm sorry.

757
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:49,569
Well, then, we're even.

758
00:36:49,613 --> 00:36:52,659
'Cause of the whole
inappropriate thing.

759
00:36:52,703 --> 00:36:55,358
Is it okay if I come
by again? I mean...

760
00:36:55,401 --> 00:36:56,968
And not as someone

761
00:36:57,012 --> 00:36:58,554
going through your finances
or whatever,

762
00:36:58,578 --> 00:37:02,365
but I just...
well, I don't...

763
00:37:02,408 --> 00:37:05,324
I don't really have someone
I can talk to about this.

764
00:37:07,283 --> 00:37:10,025
Sure.

765
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,433
More to clean for next week.

766
00:37:27,477 --> 00:37:29,740
Okay.

767
00:37:35,833 --> 00:37:37,791
What's up with you?

768
00:37:37,835 --> 00:37:40,055
What?

769
00:37:40,098 --> 00:37:42,274
You're just not so jumpy.

770
00:37:43,972 --> 00:37:45,495
Thank you.

<font color="#ffff00"><i>Heartaches...</i></font>

773
00:38:17,353 --> 00:38:18,702
Hey.

774
00:38:18,745 --> 00:38:20,704
I thought we were
goingto the Linsmore.

775
00:38:20,747 --> 00:38:22,551
I changed my mind.
I don't think having sex

776
00:38:22,575 --> 00:38:25,361
is gonna make me feel better,
so I'm just gonna be sad.

777
00:38:25,404 --> 00:38:27,232
And I'm sleeping here again.

778
00:38:27,276 --> 00:38:29,756
Unless you were
planning on sexy time

779
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,758
with Sterling's Instagram.

780
00:38:33,021 --> 00:38:34,935
I actually don't
need Instagram.

781
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:38,374
I can scroll through the
memories of the real thing.

782
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:40,071
What?

783
00:38:40,115 --> 00:38:42,310
I thought you said you
couldn'tdate anyone right now.

784
00:38:42,334 --> 00:38:44,380
I'm not dating her No.

785
00:38:44,423 --> 00:38:46,164
We're not.
We're just casually...

786
00:38:46,208 --> 00:38:48,384
Jess, no. This
is a disaster.

787
00:38:48,427 --> 00:38:50,386
I can compartmentalize.

788
00:38:50,429 --> 00:38:53,389
I've watched you do
it my whole life.

789
00:38:53,432 --> 00:38:57,132
Yeah, I sort of suck at it
right now.

790
00:38:57,175 --> 00:39:00,439
Obviously.

795

What's this?

796
00:39:19,436 --> 00:39:21,482
Nia Bailey's old money
guy got arrested again.

797
00:39:21,507 --> 00:39:23,422
She's got a new one.
Yeah, I'm on it.
