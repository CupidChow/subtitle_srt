17

29
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:11,082
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">How could they do this to him?</font>

30
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:15,581
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">We need to get something
on the Lim family and appeal.</font>

31
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:18,486
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">And when do you plan
to use that tongue of yours?</font>

32
00:04:19,825 --> 00:04:25,491
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Afraid the Deputy Prime Minister
is too powerful even for the King?</font>

33
00:04:27,633 --> 00:04:29,100
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Well, you see...</font>

34
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:31,999
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Do you not understand
what your elder is saying to you?</font>

35
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:33,901
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Are you afraid of Lim?</font>

36
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:40,110
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">But no matter
how furious this makes us,</font>

37
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:43,272
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">how can we submit a false appeal?</font>

38
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,476
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">But that's exactly what they did!</font>

39
00:04:49,121 --> 00:04:51,282
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Even if the other side does evil,</font>

40
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:55,588
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">as a scholar I cannot lower myself
to the same level as them.</font>

41
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:57,787
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">So what you're saying</font>

42
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:02,094
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">is that since you're a scholar,
you will overlook this travesty?</font>

43
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:09,503
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You don't think
I'm in torment as well?</font>

44
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,405
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I'm just as upset as you, father.</font>

45
00:05:13,245 --> 00:05:18,478
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I must leave for the Royal Court.</font>

46
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,978
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">How can you leave when your brother
is in that condition?</font>

47
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:24,487
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You also don't need to scold me.</font>

48
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:30,696
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">No, you cannot just leave!</font>

49
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,998
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">- What do you think...
- Look here!</font>

50
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:38,203
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Look at this leg...</font>

51
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:40,601
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">and you still wish to talk
of your academic duties?</font>

52
00:05:44,443 --> 00:05:46,604
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Aren't you even angry?</font>

53
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:49,774
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Our family has been disgraced.</font>

54
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:55,776
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Who gives a damn about integrity</font>

55
00:05:55,921 --> 00:05:57,889
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">and academic duty?</font>

56
00:05:58,724 --> 00:06:00,988
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Do you not want vengeance?</font>

57
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:07,695
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Know what people
are whispering behind your back?</font>

58
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:15,005
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">They're saying
that you're a selfish coward!</font>

59
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:30,778
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Inspections officer, Kim Yoon-suh,
is here your Majesty.</font>

60
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,594
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Good, good.</font>

61
00:06:45,237 --> 00:06:47,603
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Have you heard about the case
on your way here?</font>

62
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,800
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Yes, I have your Majesty.</font>

63
00:06:51,343 --> 00:06:54,506
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Despite my limited means,
I will do my best.</font>

64
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,984
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Deputy Prime Minister.</font>

65
00:07:04,523 --> 00:07:07,287
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What happened to Inspector Kim's
younger brother?</font>

66
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:19,303
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">He received the court's unlimited grace
and arrived home today.</font>

67
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,301
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">If they're brothers,</font>

68
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:27,312
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">their personalities must be similar.</font>

69
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:30,377
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Inspector Kim Yoon-seo is different.</font>

70
00:07:30,816 --> 00:07:37,984
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">He is a man of gentle temperament
who avoids going against the tides.</font>

71
00:07:41,126 --> 00:07:44,391
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">He looks that way, too.</font>

72
00:07:46,932 --> 00:07:49,196
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Anyway, I hope he resolves it,</font>

73
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:57,703
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">and puts a smile on my lady's face.</font>

74
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:11,585
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I accepted it because
I couldn't tell the difference.</font>

75
00:08:12,424 --> 00:08:15,791
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">But the scribble I put on the back
as a child wasn't to be found.</font>

76
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,891
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It was switched by someone
while being mounted.</font>

77
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:30,201
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Not only was it dear to my heart,</font>

78
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:33,610
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">but our family's honor
is on the line.</font>

79
00:08:38,817 --> 00:08:40,375
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Whoever it was,</font>

80
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:44,184
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">he knew what he was doing.</font>

81
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:50,193
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Both the paper and artist's seal
has been duplicated perfectly.</font>

82
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,798
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It seems you have profound knowledge
in Chinese paintings and writings.</font>

83
00:08:58,537 --> 00:09:00,300
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I would profess an interest</font>

84
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,103
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">but nothing close
to profound knowledge.</font>

85
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:10,275
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I'd love to hear your thoughts
on the subject sometime.</font>

86
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:14,886
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Of course.</font>

87
00:09:20,926 --> 00:09:23,190
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">We trust you will put your utmost
efforts into this case.</font>

88
00:09:24,129 --> 00:09:26,893
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You must catch the culprit.</font>

89
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:33,100
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You must not take this case.</font>

90
00:09:33,939 --> 00:09:35,099
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It's fruitless.</font>

91
00:09:35,941 --> 00:09:39,308
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Think the scoundrel is waiting
around for you to find him?</font>

92
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,804
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">But it's the King's order.</font>

93
00:09:41,947 --> 00:09:43,778
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Whatever.</font>

94
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,679
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Feign illness and dismiss yourself.</font>

95
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,490
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Take good care of yourself.</font>

96
00:09:55,627 --> 00:09:58,892
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">We are about to embark
on a great journey.</font>

97
00:10:01,533 --> 00:10:03,194
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What journey?</font>

98
00:10:05,337 --> 00:10:09,398
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Have you lost your mind?</font>

99
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:17,382
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">We must annihilate Lim
and his faction,</font>

100
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:20,076
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">and establish a new state!</font>

101
00:10:20,819 --> 00:10:21,877
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Never mind this.</font>

102
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:25,184
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">We've had enough.
Take it for yourselves.</font>

103
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:29,694
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Yes, sir.</font>

104
00:10:32,731 --> 00:10:34,596
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You're spoiling your servants.</font>

105
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:36,895
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Giving them our food...</font>

106
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:47,003
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Have you heard of Lee Gwang-hun?</font>

107
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:49,676
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I heard he's very experienced.</font>

108
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:52,884
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Lee Gwang-hun?</font>

109
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:58,483
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You mean the 'angel of death'
of the Justice Administration?</font>

110
00:11:19,044 --> 00:11:21,308
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I need to ask you a favor.</font>

111
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:37,195
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I must say, you've got guts.</font>

112
00:11:37,729 --> 00:11:40,596
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Do you even know
which party I'm a part of?</font>

113
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:46,293
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It's the King's order,
sides don't matter.</font>

114
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:50,506
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Are you sure
we're at the marketplace?</font>

115
00:11:50,642 --> 00:11:52,803
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">There are no stores open.</font>

116
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,674
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">They only open up briefly
in the early evening.</font>

117
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,776
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Once the sun sets,
housemaids fill the streets.</font>

118
00:12:00,819 --> 00:12:02,480
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Who knows what they're selling.</font>

119
00:12:07,826 --> 00:12:11,887
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">So how old are you?</font>

120
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,595
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Who, me?</font>

121
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:18,703
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Thirty-six, why do you ask?</font>

122
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:24,608
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You seem to be talking to me
as if you're an elder.</font>

123
00:12:25,944 --> 00:12:27,707
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">How old are you?</font>

124
00:12:29,414 --> 00:12:30,779
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Thirty-three.</font>

125
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:32,678
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Satisfied?</font>

126
00:12:34,319 --> 00:12:36,184
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I'm your elder then.</font>

127
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:43,886
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Look, look. Is that him?</font>

128
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:50,991
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">- Please let me go!
- Where do you think you're going?</font>

129
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,000
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Oh, right.</font>

130
00:13:01,446 --> 00:13:03,778
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Inspector Kim.
Check inside.</font>

131
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,179
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Oh, right.</font>

132
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,279
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Why do you think we're here?</font>

133
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,785
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">How should I know?</font>

134
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:16,988
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Why, you little...</font>

135
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:21,897
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Ouch, ouch.</font>

136
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:23,296
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Where's the mounter?</font>

137
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:25,198
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Mounter? Mounter? Who's that?</font>

138
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:32,009
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">If I find even one piece
of stolen goods here,</font>

139
00:13:32,544 --> 00:13:34,512
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I will break every bone in your body.</font>

140
00:13:34,646 --> 00:13:35,806
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Stolen goods?</font>

141
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:38,173
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What stolen goods?</font>

142
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,682
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You're really asking for it.</font>

143
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:47,191
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You dare snatch it?</font>

144
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:49,193
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Then what should I use to hit you?</font>

145
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:53,189
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Okay, then how about this one?</font>

146
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,393
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Alright, Let's do it.</font>

147
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:59,595
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Mister Lee...</font>

148
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:01,399
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Over here.</font>

149
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,008
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">He's getting away.</font>

150
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,708
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What are you doing here?</font>

151
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:40,905
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Transcribing a book.</font>

152
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:49,487
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What book is that?</font>

153
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:53,482
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It's a book of indecency.</font>

154
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,092
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Then you're committing a crime.</font>

155
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,296
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It's definitely not a right thing.</font>

156
00:15:07,739 --> 00:15:12,301
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">There was a racket outside,
so weren't you scared?</font>

157
00:15:13,845 --> 00:15:16,177
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Of course I was.</font>

158
00:15:18,216 --> 00:15:20,684
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">But there are many waiting
for this book.</font>

159
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:26,987
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You're very skilled at calligraphy.</font>

160
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:34,495
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">My lowly stature
limits the potential of my talent.</font>

161
00:15:37,135 --> 00:15:39,103
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">But your talent is undeniable.</font>

162
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,701
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Shall I leave?</font>

163
00:15:44,242 --> 00:15:45,607
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">No.</font>

164
00:15:47,045 --> 00:15:48,603
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Please go on.</font>

165
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:56,681
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Why are you going around
hitting people?</font>

166
00:15:56,822 --> 00:16:00,189
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">This village
is getting a little too scary.</font>

167
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:02,989
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">How dare you.</font>

168
00:16:03,428 --> 00:16:06,591
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Hwang, you know this man?</font>

169
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,893
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">This gentleman is...</font>

170
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:12,203
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">He's with the Justice Administration.
He's here to buy some chinaware.</font>

171
00:16:12,337 --> 00:16:13,998
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Come on by later.</font>

172
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:17,504
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">If he came for chinaware,
he must be the housewife.</font>

173
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,407
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Why that...</font>

174
00:16:20,545 --> 00:16:23,378
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Whether I'm a housewife or not
is my business.</font>

175
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,884
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You're interfering with my duties.</font>

176
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:32,283
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">- So get out of here.
- Get out of here?</font>

177
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:42,999
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">- What if I say no?
- Come on man,</font>

178
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:44,602
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">he asked you to leave.</font>

179
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,302
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Oh yeah?</font>

180
00:16:55,747 --> 00:16:59,877
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">By any chance, is that a rod</font>

181
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:02,684
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">made out of a bull's cock?</font>

182
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:08,391
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You've got a good eye.
You must've gotten a taste of it.</font>

183
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:10,194
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Hey.</font>

184
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:14,892
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It looks longer than ours.</font>

185
00:17:16,134 --> 00:17:20,093
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You've hit others with this
but have never been hit, huh?</font>

186
00:17:51,536 --> 00:17:52,901
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Hey you,</font>

187
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,900
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">do you know who I am?</font>

188
00:18:00,545 --> 00:18:01,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">How is it?</font>

189
00:18:02,547 --> 00:18:06,381
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Got a good taste of it?</font>

190
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:12,881
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What happened?</font>

191
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:56,292
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Sorry I passed out.</font>

192
00:18:57,235 --> 00:19:01,194
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I caused more trouble for you.</font>

193
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:06,804
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You can barely pluck a chicken,
so don't try that again.</font>

194
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:14,875
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">- About today...
- Maybe you should get on your way.</font>

195
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,984
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I've got a lot to do.</font>

196
00:19:42,647 --> 00:19:46,879
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Did you paint these here?</font>

197
00:19:48,219 --> 00:19:49,982
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Yes, it's a hobby of mine.</font>

198
00:19:51,022 --> 00:19:52,387
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Why do you ask?</font>

199
00:19:55,527 --> 00:20:00,794
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Such strength in the strokes...</font>

200
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:03,200
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It's really nothing.</font>

201
00:20:04,135 --> 00:20:07,195
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I've got to see to those vagrants.</font>

202
00:20:12,944 --> 00:20:16,778
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Let me see you out.</font>

203
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,483
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Sir, to be honest,</font>

204
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:06,987
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I don't want to protect
that mounter either.</font>

205
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:13,801
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It's just that a friend of mine
is involved.</font>

206
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:20,303
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">His only crime is that
he can copy any drawings.</font>

207
00:21:20,945 --> 00:21:22,970
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">He's innocent sir.</font>

208
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:31,880
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I will do all I can
to protect his identity.</font>

209
00:21:33,024 --> 00:21:36,585
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Could you trust me on this?</font>

210
00:21:37,128 --> 00:21:39,892
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Your loyalty to him...</font>

211
00:21:40,031 --> 00:21:43,592
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">would only bring you your death.</font>

212
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:08,693
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Go here
and see if you find something.</font>

213
00:22:21,439 --> 00:22:25,398
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Would you like to read
a few verses?</font>

214
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:31,072
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What kind of person
do you think I am?</font>

215
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:35,486
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">But if you insist.</font>

216
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,895
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Wet genitals,,,</font>

217
00:22:48,032 --> 00:22:51,490
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Genitals?</font>

218
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:00,701
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">She holds a thick penis in her hand,</font>

219
00:23:00,845 --> 00:23:02,779
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">and puts it in her mouth,</font>

220
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:06,077
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It certainly is outrageous.</font>

221
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,786
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">That's the purpose of these books.</font>

222
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:15,891
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It's not all that special.</font>

223
00:23:16,327 --> 00:23:17,589
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Really?</font>

224
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:24,491
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">The author's pen name is In Bong.</font>

225
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:28,301
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">He's considered the best of his kind.</font>

226
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,005
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">In Bong?</font>

227
00:23:31,142 --> 00:23:35,909
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">The whole city
waits for his latest creation.</font>

228
00:23:37,715 --> 00:23:39,376
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">The whole city?</font>

229
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:51,093
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Why haven't I heard of him?</font>

230
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:56,189
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You and he live in different worlds.</font>

231
00:23:56,935 --> 00:24:00,200
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Like a bird in the sky
and a fish in the waters.</font>

232
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:06,600
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">A bird shouldn't be ashamed
that it isn't aware of the fishes.</font>

233
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:14,785
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Go on.</font>

234
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,582
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">And so, both Kim Mak-swe</font>

235
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:23,183
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">and Hwang Eoh-geun
were flogged fifty times.</font>

236
00:24:24,829 --> 00:24:27,798
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Don't you think their punishments
were rather light?</font>

237
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:33,500
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">- Well, yes but in this case...
- I see.</font>

238
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,098
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Do what you see fit.</font>

239
00:24:40,144 --> 00:24:45,480
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I heard you're an excellent writer
and calligrapher.</font>

240
00:24:47,518 --> 00:24:51,579
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">My lowly talent is not worth mention,
your Majesty.</font>

241
00:24:53,524 --> 00:24:56,687
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Anyway, the Queen will be very happy.</font>

242
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:06,101
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Please cure them well.</font>

243
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:12,105
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I don't understand...</font>

244
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:14,609
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">why you're doing this.</font>

245
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:19,674
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Don't worry, I just liked you
from the beginning.</font>

246
00:25:19,817 --> 00:25:22,684
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You're very masculine and energetic.</font>

247
00:25:23,821 --> 00:25:26,790
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">But why me?</font>

248
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:29,291
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">We've just met.</font>

249
00:25:29,827 --> 00:25:31,988
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">And I'm not energetic.</font>

250
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:34,298
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I like you, too.</font>

251
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:38,002
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">A nation is not only made of men
of prominence.</font>

252
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:42,197
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Men who can copy paintings like you
are necessary.</font>

253
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:44,806
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Don't you think?</font>

254
00:25:46,744 --> 00:25:52,478
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I can safely say that you will be
in great demand someday.</font>

255
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:55,484
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">No, that will be very unlikely.</font>

256
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:59,888
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Now, please get some rest.</font>

257
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:06,388
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">There's a wound here.</font>

258
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:27,878
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Can I ask you something?</font>

259
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,488
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Yes, if you must.</font>

260
00:26:33,324 --> 00:26:36,487
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It's about what
the calligrapher said.</font>

261
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:42,399
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Is there some trouble again?</font>

262
00:26:42,533 --> 00:26:45,195
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">No, no, that's not it.</font>

263
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:55,202
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">He said the writings of In Bong
are renowned.</font>

264
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:59,080
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What about it is so exceptional?</font>

265
00:26:59,917 --> 00:27:03,785
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">His name is not to be said in vain
under any circumstances.</font>

266
00:27:03,921 --> 00:27:08,085
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It's a pseudonym anyway.</font>

267
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:11,693
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What makes it so great?</font>

268
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:17,392
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I've never thought about why.
It's a difficult question.</font>

269
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:21,300
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">How can I explain this?</font>

270
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,608
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">He knows the true flavor of it.</font>

271
00:27:27,945 --> 00:27:31,278
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">True flavor? What do you mean?</font>

272
00:27:33,718 --> 00:27:38,781
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You're the greatest writer in Korea,
so how can you ask that?</font>

273
00:27:40,124 --> 00:27:43,992
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Oh, come. Please explain.</font>

274
00:27:44,128 --> 00:27:47,097
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Well, it's almost dreamlike.</font>

275
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:49,993
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Dreamlike?</font>

276
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:54,004
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It's like you're in a dream...</font>

277
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,703
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">and seeing things in a dream.</font>

278
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:01,812
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Tasting things
you can only dream about.</font>

279
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:06,783
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">That's the true flavor of it.</font>

280
00:28:12,623 --> 00:28:17,083
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Oh boy, how could you have written
without knowing these things?</font>

281
00:28:17,728 --> 00:28:19,787
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It's hot!</font>

282
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:33,601
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I heard you carried out the King's
order with dedication and diligence.</font>

283
00:28:35,646 --> 00:28:41,175
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">And you joined forces with our enemy
who did that to your brother?</font>

284
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,080
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I did carry it out
but I was not the one...</font>

285
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,588
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Silence!</font>

00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,980
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Genitals,,,</font>

289
00:29:53,124 --> 00:30:01,691
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">The thick penis penetrated
the woman 's wet genitals,</font>

290
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:35,392
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">These are the rules.</font>

291
00:30:36,033 --> 00:30:39,901
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You are not to look at the Queen.</font>

292
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:44,502
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">If she gives you a gift,
you are to just bow in gratitude.</font>

293
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:47,110
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">If you extend your hand...</font>

294
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:50,373
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Look, I know that much.</font>

295
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:30,281
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I asked you to come see me
so that I could thank you personally.</font>

296
00:31:31,922 --> 00:31:34,390
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I was only doing what was my duty.</font>

297
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:42,598
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I heard your physical strength
played a big role this time.</font>

298
00:31:44,935 --> 00:31:47,802
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I don't understand, my Lady.</font>

299
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,106
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">With the gang of vagrants.</font>

300
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:57,878
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">When you and your partner
were in danger,</font>

301
00:31:58,015 --> 00:32:00,575
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I heard you let out
a thunderous roar.</font>

302
00:32:01,218 --> 00:32:03,584
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Then you pounced on the criminal,</font>

303
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:06,690
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">and he moved his arm like so,</font>

304
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:11,591
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">and you flew like a frog
towards the wall.</font>

305
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:16,588
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Well, that was...</font>

306
00:32:18,936 --> 00:32:23,805
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">And you went dizzy
and fell in and out of consciousness.</font>

307
00:33:21,832 --> 00:33:23,299
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Thank you.</font>

308
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:28,496
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What do you mean, my Lady?</font>

309
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:49,986
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Anyway, thank you.</font>

00:33:51,128 --> 00:33:56,794
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I was stung by a bee as a child
and ever since I cannot stand bees.</font>

but go on, tell me.</font>

312
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:10,997
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I wrote it on a whim, I mean,
for game.</font>

313
00:35:12,042 --> 00:35:15,307
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Would you take a look at it?</font>

314
00:35:15,946 --> 00:35:17,379
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What's it about?</font>

315
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:22,577
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It's an indecent book.</font>

322
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:48,002
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Well, what do you think?</font>

323
00:36:53,744 --> 00:36:55,905
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I knew it.</font>

324
00:36:56,213 --> 00:36:59,376
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I was planning to burn it anyway.</font>

325
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:02,285
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Who would've thought
you of all people?</font>

326
00:37:02,419 --> 00:37:07,686
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Come on now.
I said it was for sport.</font>

327
00:37:12,529 --> 00:37:15,987
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">This is what I think.</font>

328
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:22,095
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I think you should make this
a series of stories.</font>

329
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:27,199
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">From the moment they meet,
until the deed is done.</font>

330
00:37:28,846 --> 00:37:32,179
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Make it tantalizing.</font>

331
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:35,080
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You think it merits such a fuss?</font>

332
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:36,879
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Look.</font>

333
00:37:38,822 --> 00:37:41,484
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I thought my trousers
were going to bust.</font>

334
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:24,298
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Did you get the treatment?</font>

335
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:29,497
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">We could have met at my store.
Why do we have to meet here?</font>

336
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,107
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Looks like there's a problem.</font>

337
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:37,878
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You don't look too well.</font>

338
00:38:40,317 --> 00:38:41,784
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">No book either.</font>

339
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:48,284
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I was too arrogant and proud.</font>

340
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,088
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Arrogant?</font>

341
00:38:50,527 --> 00:38:56,295
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I thought it would be easy,
but it wasn't at all.</font>

342
00:38:56,433 --> 00:39:00,096
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">So you didn't even try?</font>

343
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:04,804
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Let's see, I promised
the manuscript to the merchants on...</font>

344
00:39:06,443 --> 00:39:10,777
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">To make copies and get them ready,</font>

345
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:13,576
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I needed it by today.</font>

346
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:15,979
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Now I can't honor this deal.</font>

347
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,680
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It's going to become messy.</font>

348
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,491
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Those merchants can get nasty.</font>

349
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:25,288
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Oh sir, if only you could...</font>

<font face="sans-serif" size="53">'Hukgok Bisa'?</font>

351
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:39,709
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You mean,
'Tale of the Dark Valley'?</font>

352
00:39:39,843 --> 00:39:42,004
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I was just trying it out.</font>

353
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:43,670
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Do you think it is inappropriate?</font>

354
00:39:44,214 --> 00:39:45,476
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It's pretty explicit.</font>

355
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:48,483
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Isn't that the point?</font>

356
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:52,180
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Well, these books
tend to have sober titles.</font>

357
00:39:54,424 --> 00:39:55,789
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">But from the first page?</font>

358
00:39:57,327 --> 00:40:00,490
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Wait, I guess I don't have
what it takes.</font>

359
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:03,293
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">- Give that back to me.
- Sir, hold on.</font>

360
00:40:06,436 --> 00:40:07,698
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Slap it here.</font>

361
00:40:08,438 --> 00:40:09,803
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What is this?</font>

362
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,909
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Just do it
and stop asking questions.</font>

363
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:16,879
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Now we have an agreement.</font>

364
00:40:17,014 --> 00:40:19,983
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Hwang, wait!</font>

365
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:24,076
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Hwang! Hold on!</font>

366
00:40:41,638 --> 00:40:44,607
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">So you haven't started
Chapter Two yet?</font>

367
00:40:46,443 --> 00:40:48,707
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Well, it is what it is.</font>

368
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:53,183
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I was feeling under the weather.</font>

369
00:40:53,817 --> 00:40:57,275
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">And filial duties kept me busy.</font>

370
00:40:57,721 --> 00:41:01,987
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">And the maids mistakenly threw out
what's been written so far?</font>

371
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:07,090
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Yes, that's right.</font>

372
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:27,075
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">So, what's the reaction
to Chapter One?</font>

373
00:41:29,319 --> 00:41:34,780
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Well, I mean, it is your first time,
a little rough around the edges.</font>

374
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:36,790
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I see.</font>

375
00:41:38,228 --> 00:41:39,593
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I understand.</font>

376
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:46,102
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Let's just say it never happened.</font>

377
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:49,203
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I just don't think
I can keep this up.</font>

378
00:41:49,339 --> 00:41:52,399
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">That darn temper of yours.
It is a huge sensation, okay?</font>

379
00:42:01,518 --> 00:42:05,284
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Really, are you sure?</font>

380
00:42:06,823 --> 00:42:08,688
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Look, this is your book.</font>

381
00:42:08,825 --> 00:42:10,292
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">See how it's all worn out?</font>

382
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:13,487
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">And look at the last page.</font>

383
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:18,098
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Who wrote all that?</font>

384
00:42:18,735 --> 00:42:20,293
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Those who read your prose</font>

385
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:25,204
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">were inspired to write down
their thoughts and opinions here.</font>

386
00:42:26,343 --> 00:42:28,903
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What do you call these messages?</font>

387
00:42:30,914 --> 00:42:33,075
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">In my ten years as a merchant,
this is a first.</font>

388
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:38,677
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Since the readers left messages...
how about calling it a message board?</font>

389
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:42,085
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">A message board.</font>

390
00:42:43,927 --> 00:42:50,594
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Sleep abandoned me
after I read your work.</font>

391
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:57,102

of a woman's heart.</font>

392
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,605
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It is strange.</font>

393
00:42:59,142 --> 00:43:01,201
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">This is my story.</font>

394
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:03,973
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I must meet the writer.</font>

395
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:09,684
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Did my lover confess to you?</font>

396
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:14,189
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Chu Wol Sek, the writer.
He is human trash.</font>

397
00:43:15,325 --> 00:43:17,691
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I will never read his writing again.</font>

398
00:43:17,828 --> 00:43:19,693
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I will only read your work.</font>

399
00:43:21,631 --> 00:43:25,089
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">In Bong's followers are all trash.</font>

400
00:43:25,836 --> 00:43:26,700
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Die In Bong!</font>

401
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:30,796
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I eagerly await the next chapter!</font>

402
00:43:31,441 --> 00:43:32,908
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You want to keep this?</font>

403
00:43:35,645 --> 00:43:37,374
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Aren't those colored glasses?</font>

404
00:43:39,616 --> 00:43:41,277
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">My eyes are fine.</font>

405
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:45,479
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">These aren't for improving vision.</font>

406
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:49,686
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Writers usually wear these.</font>

407
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:18,683
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Writer...</font>

408
00:44:24,027 --> 00:44:27,394
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">How can you all
come in droves like this?</font>

409
00:44:27,531 --> 00:44:31,490
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Sorry, good bye.</font>

410
00:44:31,635 --> 00:44:35,594
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">The writer only wants to work with us.
What can I do?</font>

411
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:38,198
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I'm sorry.</font>

412
00:44:38,341 --> 00:44:41,105
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I'll see you later. Go on, go on.</font>

413
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:44,175
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Those tradesmen.</font>

414
00:44:44,514 --> 00:44:47,881
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I've already circulated sixty copies,
and I'm still short.</font>

415
00:44:48,618 --> 00:44:50,677
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Such a fuss over some clumsy work.</font>

416
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:55,182
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Well, it seems you've recovered
the cost of paper.</font>

417
00:44:58,328 --> 00:45:01,491
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Well, that is...</font>

418
00:45:01,631 --> 00:45:03,496
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Sir, your books are selling well.</font>

419
00:45:03,633 --> 00:45:04,998
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">But the uproar is, well...</font>

420
00:45:05,135 --> 00:45:09,003
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">In Bong has come out with a new book,
'Maiden Ok Ryung'.</font>

421
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:14,208
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Oh, I see.</font>

422
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,274
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I was wondering what that was.</font>

423
00:45:31,128 --> 00:45:33,289
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">This man, In Bong.</font>

424
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:36,490
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I'd like to meet him.</font>

425
00:45:37,033 --> 00:45:40,491
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Every book of his causes a sensation.</font>

426
00:45:41,838 --> 00:45:45,501
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Your books are no less of quality.</font>

427
00:45:46,643 --> 00:45:48,804
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It's just that...</font>

428
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:52,380
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Just what? Tell me.</font>

429
00:45:52,816 --> 00:45:55,785
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Do I lack that 'true flavor'?</font>

430
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:57,682
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">No, not at all.</font>

431
00:45:58,622 --> 00:46:01,989
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It's just that...</font>

432
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:05,588
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">There's an air of pretentiousness.</font>

433
00:46:06,129 --> 00:46:07,790
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">No, I mean...</font>

434
00:46:13,737 --> 00:46:15,398
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Air of pretentiousness?</font>

435
00:46:16,139 --> 00:46:20,007
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Yours is the second
best selling book,</font>

436
00:46:20,143 --> 00:46:21,303
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">so what's the problem?</font>

437
00:46:22,045 --> 00:46:23,478
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You have such ambitions.</font>

438
00:46:28,518 --> 00:46:30,782
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Second to 'Maiden Ok Ryung'...</font>

439
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:33,380
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Why isn't this working?</font>

440
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:19,292
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Your joke is going too far.</font>

441
00:47:21,938 --> 00:47:25,499
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Where would I get a book like that?</font>

442
00:47:30,714 --> 00:47:32,579
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Who is trying to incriminate me?</font>

443
00:47:35,418 --> 00:47:37,886
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I'm not saying you read it.</font>

444
00:47:39,923 --> 00:47:41,083
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What?</font>

445
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:45,392
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Then why are you here?</font>

446
00:47:50,934 --> 00:47:54,199
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">In truth,
I'm writing this kind of novel.</font>

447
00:48:03,813 --> 00:48:05,075
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">So what?</font>

448
00:48:08,918 --> 00:48:11,682
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">But I need some illustrations,</font>

449
00:48:14,624 --> 00:48:18,583
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">and wanted to ask you to paint them.</font>

450
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:31,402
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">So you want me to illustrate
your scandalous books?</font>

451
00:48:32,642 --> 00:48:33,904
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Me?</font>

452
00:48:37,514 --> 00:48:38,674
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Yes.</font>

453
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:42,885
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You've got some nerve!</font>

454
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:57,994
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">How dare you ask this of me?</font>

455
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:07,910
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What about that painting?</font>

456
00:49:11,915 --> 00:49:14,076
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I wanted to ask the person
who painted this</font>

457
00:49:14,617 --> 00:49:16,676
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">to illustrate my book.</font>

458
00:49:17,921 --> 00:49:19,889
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Even if it's indecent,</font>

459
00:49:20,924 --> 00:49:23,484
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">my fans are eagerly awaiting
for the next chapter.</font>

460
00:49:32,535 --> 00:49:35,902
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">The life and breath in this painting.</font>

461
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:40,999
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">The lust behind the twitching muscles.</font>

462
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:45,180
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I need the person who created this.</font>

463
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:48,682
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I know I may be acting rash.</font>

464
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:52,987
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">But I need you.</font>

465
00:49:53,123 --> 00:49:56,786
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I really want your pictures.</font>

466
00:50:02,532 --> 00:50:04,295
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I'm going to act like this
never happened.</font>

467
00:50:06,136 --> 00:50:08,400
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">This is the first time
I'm disobeying the national law</font>

468
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,608
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">by not throwing you into jail.</font>

469
00:50:16,713 --> 00:50:18,180
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Go back home quietly.</font>

470
00:50:59,522 --> 00:51:01,285
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Please do this favor for me.</font>

471
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:08,597
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Are you dying</font>

472
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:12,301
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">to be locked up in here?</font>

473
00:51:36,726 --> 00:51:40,093
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I bring you over
to a wonderful place like this,</font>

474
00:51:42,131 --> 00:51:43,894
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">so why such a long face?</font>

475
00:51:45,235 --> 00:51:50,696
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">As members of the court,
we shouldn't be socializing like this.</font>

476
00:51:54,444 --> 00:52:01,475
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Shouldn't be socializing?</font>

477
00:52:02,318 --> 00:52:07,881
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">If it's so wrong, why are you here?</font>

478
00:52:16,032 --> 00:52:17,590
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You girls go outside.</font>

479
00:52:39,923 --> 00:52:41,185
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What's this?</font>

480
00:52:43,526 --> 00:52:44,686
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">If I was you,</font>

481
00:52:46,029 --> 00:52:49,590
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I wouldn't touch that and just leave.</font>

482
00:52:57,941 --> 00:52:59,602
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It's not too late.</font>

483
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:04,573
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Just walk way.</font>

484
00:53:18,227 --> 00:53:20,787
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I apologize for the commotion,</font>

485
00:53:20,997 --> 00:53:26,264
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I only wanted to thank you
for your efforts,</font>

486
00:53:27,337 --> 00:53:31,205
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You saw me alarmed
by a trifle animal,</font>

487
00:53:32,041 --> 00:53:37,479
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You risked embarrassment to save me,
I can never thank you enough,</font>

488
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:40,974
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I send this small token to you,</font>

489
00:53:41,618 --> 00:53:48,182
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">and hope you'll accept it
as a sign of my gratitude,</font>

490
00:54:03,539 --> 00:54:05,803
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">She sewed it personally.</font>

491
00:54:08,044 --> 00:54:09,568
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Don't accept it.</font>

492
00:54:13,316 --> 00:54:16,979
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Ifyou do, she'll ask to meet,</font>

493
00:54:18,321 --> 00:54:22,485
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">If there's something the Queen wants,</font>

494
00:54:23,126 --> 00:54:25,788
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">she will do whatever to have it,</font>

495
00:56:21,344 --> 00:56:24,973
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Where is your courage?</font>

496
00:56:29,619 --> 00:56:32,588
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I refused to believe people
who called you a coward.</font>

497
00:56:34,423 --> 00:56:38,189
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Where is the man who struck the bee
without a second thought?</font>

498
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:42,498
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Your words don't matter.</font>

499
00:56:43,232 --> 00:56:44,597
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I'm leaving.</font>

500
00:56:55,645 --> 00:56:59,979
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Do you know how difficult it was
to leave the palace?</font>

501
00:57:22,638 --> 00:57:24,105
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What business do you have here?</font>

502
00:57:32,815 --> 00:57:34,976
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Father, I will take it from here.</font>

503
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:38,187
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Please don't worry and go inside.</font>

504
00:57:44,026 --> 00:57:47,189
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">With a court lady?</font>

505
00:57:49,432 --> 00:57:51,491
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I don't believe this.</font>

506
00:57:53,936 --> 00:57:55,597
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Please speak.</font>

507
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:03,476
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It's indecent,
not to mention blasphemous.</font>

508
00:58:04,313 --> 00:58:06,076
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">And it makes no sense.</font>

509
00:58:06,249 --> 00:58:07,409
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Oh my.</font>

510
00:58:08,317 --> 00:58:11,582
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">- That's the physiology of these books.
- Well!</font>

511
00:58:11,721 --> 00:58:13,689
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">So are you going to do it or not?</font>

512
00:58:14,724 --> 00:58:16,282
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I want to do it.</font>

513
00:58:23,332 --> 00:58:27,200
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I'd like to start
Chapter Three like this.</font>

514
00:58:28,337 --> 00:58:34,401
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Queen Yoon is overcome with desire
and sneaks out of the palace.</font>

515
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:39,281
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">She has an encounter
in the midst of the crowds</font>

516
00:58:39,415 --> 00:58:41,883
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">during the lotus festival.</font>

517
00:58:42,618 --> 00:58:44,677
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">That's ridiculous!</font>

518
00:58:45,421 --> 00:58:46,786
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What do you mean?</font>

519
00:58:47,323 --> 00:58:49,086
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">How can a woman of her stature?</font>

520
00:58:51,227 --> 00:58:56,688
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Even fiction should
have some plausibility.</font>

521
00:58:57,133 --> 00:59:00,398
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Reality is unrealistic.</font>

522
00:59:05,341 --> 00:59:07,206
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It's like a dream.</font>

523
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:11,172
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Like something seen in a dream.</font>

524
00:59:12,415 --> 00:59:15,680
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Like something tasted in a dream.</font>

525
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:20,282
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">That is what this book is all about.</font>

526
00:59:22,124 --> 00:59:27,391
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You could call it
the 'true flavor' of life.</font>

527
00:59:30,533 --> 00:59:31,898
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">True flavor'.</font>

528
00:59:33,436 --> 00:59:36,803
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">And one more thing,
I'm the writer here.</font>

529
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:40,709
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">And you're the illustrator.</font>

530
00:59:40,943 --> 00:59:43,571
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Please recognize the difference.</font>

531
00:59:46,315 --> 00:59:47,373
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I understand.</font>

532
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:54,287
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Anyways,
the two lovers circle a pagoda,</font>

533
00:59:55,224 --> 00:59:59,285
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">and the man pulls the queen
into the storage.</font>

534
01:00:02,131 --> 01:00:06,295
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">If you don't stop, I'll scream!</font>

535
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:12,897
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I know you don't have it
in you to scream.</font>

536
01:00:18,914 --> 01:00:22,179
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Why are you doing this?</font>

537
01:00:33,229 --> 01:00:36,995
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What? He touches right away?</font>

538
01:00:37,433 --> 01:00:38,593
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Of course,</font>

539
01:00:39,435 --> 01:00:42,996
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Wouldn 't he be stupid not to?</font>

540
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:45,400
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">But there would be
a couple upstairs already,</font>

541
01:00:45,541 --> 01:00:46,701
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Hey.</font>

542
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:49,977
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It doesn 't matter,</font>

543
01:01:02,425 --> 01:01:05,087
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Can it be this wild?</font>

544
01:01:34,423 --> 01:01:36,482
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Stop it!
He took off his noble hat?</font>

545
01:01:37,226 --> 01:01:39,285
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Why are you yelling?</font>

546
01:01:39,628 --> 01:01:47,194
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You're saying he took off his hat,
and explores there with his mouth?</font>

547
01:01:47,536 --> 01:01:51,700
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">And I plan to describe in detail
the shape and state of the genitals</font>

548
01:01:51,841 --> 01:01:53,809
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">in this edition.</font>

549
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:55,203
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Gen...</font>

550
01:01:55,945 --> 01:01:57,469
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Such indecent words.</font>

551
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:03,683
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Genitals.</font>

552
01:02:07,123 --> 01:02:09,387
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Why are you sitting like that?</font>

553
01:02:12,328 --> 01:02:13,989
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Do you have an erection?</font>

554
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:15,790
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What are you talking about?</font>

555
01:02:18,334 --> 01:02:20,199
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">So can you draw it?</font>

556
01:02:21,437 --> 01:02:22,597
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Draw what?</font>

557
01:02:23,139 --> 01:02:28,907
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">A guy standing her back to a tree,
with his mouth exploring down there?</font>

558
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:34,281
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Let's draw them lying on the ground,</font>

559
01:02:34,717 --> 01:02:37,083
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">with him exploring in earnest.</font>

560
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:43,486
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You could draw his behind
at a slightly lowered angle.</font>

561
01:02:44,426 --> 01:02:49,693
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">How are you going to make
sixty copies with such a slow hand?</font>

562
01:02:51,133 --> 01:02:52,293
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You're right.</font>

563
01:02:52,835 --> 01:02:54,598
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You're not making art.
Take it easy.</font>

564
01:02:56,839 --> 01:02:58,500
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">If you don't like my work,
I can leave.</font>

565
01:02:58,641 --> 01:02:59,903
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">No, no, no.</font>

566
01:03:00,042 --> 01:03:01,304
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Keep going.</font>

567
01:03:02,244 --> 01:03:03,973
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I'm strangely tired.</font>

568
01:03:04,914 --> 01:03:07,075
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I only do it
because I like the paintings.</font>

569
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:10,984
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Okay, okay.
I'll take better care of you.</font>

570
01:03:13,322 --> 01:03:18,385
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Wow, what a great idea
to illustrate the writing.</font>

571
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:21,391
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I'm shocked.</font>

572
01:03:22,932 --> 01:03:25,992
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">One must be a cut above the rest.</font>

573
01:03:27,436 --> 01:03:31,702
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Allow me the liberty of saying.</font>

574
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:38,272
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Go ahead. It's between us.</font>

575
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:46,482
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You are my treasure and fortune.</font>

576
01:03:48,123 --> 01:03:49,886
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You're too much.</font>

577
01:03:53,229 --> 01:03:54,389
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Anyways.</font>

578
01:03:54,830 --> 01:03:59,699
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">In your next book,
what's your vision for that scene...</font>

579
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:03,396
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What pose will you depict?</font>

580
01:04:03,539 --> 01:04:06,508
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">That's a marvelous talent of yours.</font>

581
01:04:12,414 --> 01:04:16,077
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Just your typical
man and woman position.</font>

582
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:20,088
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Nothing special.</font>

583
01:04:20,422 --> 01:04:22,390
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I knew it. I knew it.</font>

584
01:04:22,524 --> 01:04:25,891
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Nobles are too boring.
That's why I asked to make sure.</font>

585
01:04:34,637 --> 01:04:36,901
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Come over here.</font>

586
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:39,602
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Me?</font>

587
01:04:40,242 --> 01:04:42,301
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I'm transcribing right now.</font>

588
01:04:46,315 --> 01:04:47,577
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I said come here.</font>

589
01:04:50,419 --> 01:04:54,583
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Don't nobles
usually take this position?</font>

590
01:04:54,823 --> 01:04:59,783
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Like this until it comes out, right?</font>

591
01:04:59,928 --> 01:05:02,089
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">They just keep doing this, yes?</font>

592
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:04,096
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What fun is that?</font>

593
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:06,494
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Only a cricket would like it.</font>

594
01:05:06,635 --> 01:05:10,503
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I'll show you what women like.</font>

595
01:05:10,939 --> 01:05:12,201
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Lift this.</font>

596
01:05:12,341 --> 01:05:13,399
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Relax, stop tensing up.</font>

597
01:05:13,542 --> 01:05:15,510
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Like this?</font>

598
01:05:15,844 --> 01:05:20,872
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Now, if you do it like this,
what happens?</font>

599
01:05:21,216 --> 01:05:22,376
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It goes really deep, no?</font>

600
01:05:23,319 --> 01:05:27,380
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">She'll go crazy, saying it's deep,</font>

601
01:05:27,623 --> 01:05:30,091
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">it hurts, and it feels good.</font>

602
01:05:31,126 --> 01:05:32,286
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">This much.</font>

603
01:05:32,928 --> 01:05:34,293
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">This is the least you can do.</font>

604
01:05:37,032 --> 01:05:40,092
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I've been thinking
of one or two things.</font>

605
01:05:41,136 --> 01:05:42,501
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Two things?</font>

606
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:47,500
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Don't think too indecent of me.</font>

607
01:05:49,244 --> 01:05:50,370
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">A noble takes off his hat?</font>

608
01:05:53,015 --> 01:05:54,482
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Please hold this.</font>

609
01:05:58,020 --> 01:05:59,783
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Please stand up for me.</font>

610
01:06:00,923 --> 01:06:02,481
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Me again?</font>

611
01:06:02,624 --> 01:06:06,390
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">- Come, get up.
- Oh, why me?</font>

612
01:06:10,232 --> 01:06:12,097
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Turn around like this.</font>

613
01:06:13,836 --> 01:06:16,396
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Prop up the woman like this.</font>

614
01:06:17,339 --> 01:06:19,500
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">The man goes behind her,</font>

615
01:06:20,442 --> 01:06:23,377
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">and lifts the leg like this.</font>

616
01:06:25,514 --> 01:06:27,778
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Darn, it's stiff.</font>

617
01:06:28,817 --> 01:06:33,686
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Like this from the behind.</font>

618
01:06:34,423 --> 01:06:36,084
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Doing it like this.</font>

619
01:06:37,526 --> 01:06:40,984
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Oh my, it does look a bit sadist.</font>

620
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:43,097
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Saddest? Why sad?</font>

621
01:06:44,933 --> 01:06:52,897
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">This position is good when the ground
is lumpy and there's little time.</font>

622
01:06:55,744 --> 01:06:58,178
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">So that's one.</font>

623
01:06:59,715 --> 01:07:01,683
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Now lie down.</font>

624
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:08,988
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">This time, move up, up farther.</font>

625
01:07:09,124 --> 01:07:10,887
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Lay the woman like this,</font>

626
01:07:11,527 --> 01:07:16,396
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">and the man lies next to her
with a leg up like this.</font>

627
01:07:18,634 --> 01:07:22,798
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Hey, can you make that sound again?</font>

628
01:07:29,511 --> 01:07:31,172
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Like this, okay?</font>

629
01:07:31,814 --> 01:07:33,679
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Doing it like this.</font>

630
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:41,679
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">The distinction here is that each
can do his or her own business.</font>

631
01:07:41,824 --> 01:07:45,988
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Scholars like us
have a lot of reading to do.</font>

632
01:07:47,329 --> 01:07:49,593
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Look here, give me that book.</font>

633
01:07:49,731 --> 01:07:50,891
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Book.</font>

634
01:07:52,334 --> 01:07:55,701
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">So while making love</font>

635
01:07:56,939 --> 01:07:58,406
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">you can also read.</font>

636
01:07:59,041 --> 01:08:03,978
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">That's a great position for me!</font>

637
01:08:04,313 --> 01:08:07,282
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I can write while doing it.</font>

638
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:09,179
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Yes, you're right.</font>

639
01:08:09,318 --> 01:08:12,583
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You don't have any time
to rest anyway.</font>

640
01:08:15,023 --> 01:08:16,388
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Is there any more?</font>

641
01:08:18,827 --> 01:08:20,988
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Well, yes.</font>

642
01:08:22,631 --> 01:08:26,192
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">But he's too old for it.</font>

643
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:34,603
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What position is it now?</font>

644
01:08:37,212 --> 01:08:38,474
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Tell me.</font>

645
01:08:39,114 --> 01:08:41,878
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Then let's go into the bedchambers.</font>

646
01:08:44,019 --> 01:08:46,283
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">No, just tell me.</font>

647
01:08:47,022 --> 01:08:48,683
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I was able to draw the other two.</font>

648
01:08:48,824 --> 01:08:51,884
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I said let's go to the bedchamber.</font>

649
01:08:52,027 --> 01:08:53,392
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I said no.</font>

650
01:08:57,733 --> 01:08:59,894
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Why, are you frightened?</font>

651
01:09:01,537 --> 01:09:02,902
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Oh, please.</font>

652
01:09:07,442 --> 01:09:09,000
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Then listen carefully.</font>

653
01:09:12,614 --> 01:09:13,979
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">So,</font>

654
01:09:17,719 --> 01:09:22,884
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">the woman lies with her gaze
towards the skies.</font>

655
01:09:26,528 --> 01:09:33,900
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">She raises her legs over her head.</font>

656
01:09:34,036 --> 01:09:35,196
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Completely!</font>

657
01:09:39,041 --> 01:09:42,772
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What's wrong?
Do you not understand?</font>

658
01:09:44,112 --> 01:09:45,374
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">No.</font>

659
01:09:46,915 --> 01:09:49,281
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Just that it is so indecent.</font>

660
01:09:49,418 --> 01:09:54,981
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">How will you visualize my writing
if you're already like this?</font>

661
01:09:55,924 --> 01:09:58,188
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">No, I'm all right. Keep going.</font>

662
01:10:01,129 --> 01:10:02,391
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">At any rate,</font>

663
01:10:04,032 --> 01:10:09,197
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">she raises her legs so high,</font>

664
01:10:10,038 --> 01:10:13,405
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">her feet touches the ground.</font>

665
01:10:15,644 --> 01:10:20,377
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Are the knees touching each other?
Or are they parted?</font>

666
01:10:22,517 --> 01:10:24,985
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">That's up to you.</font>

667
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:27,782
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It doesn't matter.</font>

668
01:10:27,923 --> 01:10:31,689
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">- Knees together.
- Now, it's the man's turn.</font>

669
01:10:33,428 --> 01:10:38,798
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">His legs are about two feet apart.</font>

670
01:10:39,234 --> 01:10:43,398
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">He places her in between and enters.</font>

671
01:10:46,842 --> 01:10:49,868
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">No, wait now.</font>

672
01:10:50,712 --> 01:10:54,273
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">He'll be looking in the opposite
direction than the woman.</font>

673
01:10:56,818 --> 01:10:58,877
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I don't understand.</font>

674
01:11:00,422 --> 01:11:03,482
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">He stands with his back to her?</font>

675
01:11:04,126 --> 01:11:05,286
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Yes.</font>

676
01:11:07,129 --> 01:11:14,092
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">And then he assumes the 'bend forward'
position, bending the knees.</font>

677
01:11:14,736 --> 01:11:16,897
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You can call this
the 'horseback' position.</font>

678
01:11:19,141 --> 01:11:22,201
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Why would one stand like that?</font>

679
01:11:27,916 --> 01:11:30,885
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">The purpose is always the same, no?</font>

680
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:35,881
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">He raises her buttocks,</font>

681
01:11:38,627 --> 01:11:41,596
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">and enters her.</font>

682
01:11:45,333 --> 01:11:46,800
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">That's impossible!</font>

683
01:11:48,537 --> 01:11:49,902
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Look, Inspector Kim!</font>

684
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:53,007
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Authors should
have some responsibility!</font>

685
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:56,475
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">A reader may try to imitate
what's described in this book.</font>

686
01:11:56,611 --> 01:12:01,378
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What will you do if the penis slips,</font>

687
01:12:01,516 --> 01:12:03,177
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">and he gets injured?</font>

688
01:12:12,728 --> 01:12:14,286
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I will warn people</font>

689
01:12:15,630 --> 01:12:17,894
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">against imitating things in the book.</font>

690
01:12:19,434 --> 01:12:20,594
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You satisfied?</font>

691
01:12:28,243 --> 01:12:31,872
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It's anatomically impossible,</font>

692
01:12:32,914 --> 01:12:39,581
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">and even if it were,
it would be a true miracle.</font>

693
01:12:42,924 --> 01:12:48,590
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">So, have you tried
this position yourself?</font>

694
01:12:51,032 --> 01:12:54,695
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">How can you think that would be
allowed in our household?</font>

695
01:13:06,915 --> 01:13:11,784
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">From the look on your face,
you lack confidence.</font>

696
01:13:15,724 --> 01:13:20,388
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Is it because you haven't finished
the illustrations?</font>

697
01:13:21,229 --> 01:13:24,096
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">This will cause a significant delay
in our schedule.</font>

698
01:13:26,234 --> 01:13:28,395
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I know that.</font>

699
01:13:29,037 --> 01:13:31,801
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It will be very complicated
and difficult.</font>

700
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:34,909
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">The merchants will become nasty.</font>

701
01:13:39,514 --> 01:13:41,175
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Wait a minute.</font>

702
01:13:41,516 --> 01:13:44,280
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Is it because
you couldn't understand me?</font>

703
01:13:54,729 --> 01:13:58,495
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">This woman's face.</font>

704
01:14:00,035 --> 01:14:01,798
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Isn't this your wife?</font>

705
01:14:02,537 --> 01:14:04,300
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Yes, it is.</font>

706
01:14:05,540 --> 01:14:09,977
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I know very well
that her face isn't suitable.</font>

707
01:14:10,512 --> 01:14:13,879
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Why are you so angry?
I was just asking.</font>

708
01:14:15,217 --> 01:14:18,584
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Do you know how much she suffered
for this picture?</font>

709
01:14:21,022 --> 01:14:22,785
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Conjuring up an impossible position.</font>

710
01:14:27,829 --> 01:14:29,296
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It's driving me crazy, too!</font>

711
01:14:30,332 --> 01:14:32,391
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">As you know from my work,</font>

712
01:14:32,834 --> 01:14:34,995
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I have to see it with my own eyes.</font>

713
01:14:43,712 --> 01:14:48,672
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What a lack of imagination.</font>

714
01:14:57,225 --> 01:15:02,492
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">So if you see it with your own eyes,
can you draw it?</font>

715
01:15:03,531 --> 01:15:06,989
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You mean, it can be re-enacted?</font>

716
01:15:12,641 --> 01:15:17,078
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Of course not.
I was just supposing.</font>

717
01:15:23,919 --> 01:15:28,083
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You're overreacting.</font>

718
01:15:52,414 --> 01:15:54,279
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">When the weather is like this,</font>

719
01:15:55,417 --> 01:15:57,783
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">her Highness gets a craving for this.</font>

720
01:16:02,223 --> 01:16:07,593
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">She loved the way I made them
since the she lived at home.</font>

721
01:16:12,133 --> 01:16:14,294
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Why does she need to see me?</font>

722
01:16:17,539 --> 01:16:19,700
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Ever since she returned
from the temple,</font>

723
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:25,175
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">she's been in a bad mood.</font>

724
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:33,783
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">She wants to see you again.</font>

725
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:38,085
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I trust nothing will happen again.</font>

726
01:16:40,428 --> 01:16:43,886
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You're a man and it's natural
for her to want to see you.</font>

727
01:16:44,032 --> 01:16:45,397
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">But...</font>

728
01:16:47,936 --> 01:16:49,494
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">you can hold out, right?</font>

729
01:17:08,323 --> 01:17:09,790
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Where's the meeting place?</font>

730
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:28,198
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Follow what's been ordered from here.</font>

731
01:17:31,813 --> 01:17:33,474
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Follow an order from there,</font>

732
01:17:38,019 --> 01:17:40,283
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">then everything will be ruined.</font>

733
01:17:49,831 --> 01:17:54,291
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">She said for you
to decide the place.</font>

734
01:18:05,713 --> 01:18:07,874
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">So I can choose the location?</font>

735
01:18:21,229 --> 01:18:23,197
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">How could you do that?</font>

736
01:18:26,334 --> 01:18:27,699
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Do what?</font>

737
01:18:30,738 --> 01:18:34,401
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Just leave me there alone.</font>

738
01:18:39,013 --> 01:18:41,675
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What was I to do?</font>

739
01:18:44,119 --> 01:18:46,383
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I know you are a man of honor.</font>

740
01:18:46,521 --> 01:18:47,681
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">But...</font>

741
01:18:54,028 --> 01:18:56,792
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I am not who you think I am.</font>

742
01:19:00,235 --> 01:19:04,604
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I'm filled with these dirty thoughts
that squirm inside of me.</font>

743
01:19:07,041 --> 01:19:08,702
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">That's the person I am.</font>

744
01:19:15,717 --> 01:19:18,277
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Dirty thoughts?</font>

745
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:20,383
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What kind of dirty thoughts?</font>

746
01:19:29,531 --> 01:19:32,398
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Tell me how dirty they are.</font>

747
01:19:40,441 --> 01:19:43,467
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">How could I possibly tell you?</font>

748
01:19:51,319 --> 01:19:52,877
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Go on.</font>

749
01:23:44,218 --> 01:23:45,685
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Look here.</font>

750
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:50,188
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Why do you keep looking at me
and then that mutt over there?</font>

751
01:23:51,225 --> 01:23:52,988
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What are you talking about?</font>

752
01:23:54,128 --> 01:23:55,993
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I didn't mean to.</font>

753
01:23:57,632 --> 01:23:59,190
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Why get on my case?</font>

754
01:24:09,811 --> 01:24:14,578
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Oh yeah, about me doubting
the possibility of that position.</font>

755
01:24:14,715 --> 01:24:17,183
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I'm sorry about that.</font>

756
01:24:19,821 --> 01:24:22,381
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Please show me the rough sketch.</font>

757
01:24:22,523 --> 01:24:25,981
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What time do I have
for a rough sketch?</font>

758
01:24:26,627 --> 01:24:28,390
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It's all in my head.</font>

759
01:24:32,433 --> 01:24:34,901
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">From the time our country was born,</font>

760
01:24:36,637 --> 01:24:38,901
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">we are probably
the most lecherous fellows.</font>

761
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:40,800
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Don't you agree?</font>

762
01:24:42,743 --> 01:24:46,975
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">There will be none like us
even after we are gone.</font>

763
01:24:48,015 --> 01:24:52,679
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Who knows what the future holds.</font>

764
01:24:54,021 --> 01:24:57,388
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Please stop looking at that dog!</font>

765
01:25:08,035 --> 01:25:12,597
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Take a deep breath.</font>

766
01:25:14,041 --> 01:25:17,374
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Do you remember
this sweet fragrance?</font>

767
01:25:19,013 --> 01:25:20,776
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What do you mean, your Highness?</font>

768
01:25:22,917 --> 01:25:24,680
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">When I was back living at home,</font>

769
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:29,989
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">you snuck me out
during the Dano Festival.</font>

770
01:25:34,829 --> 01:25:37,093
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It reminds me of the fragrance then.</font>

771
01:25:38,032 --> 01:25:40,193
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You still remember, your Highness?</font>

772
01:25:40,635 --> 01:25:42,102
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Of course I do.</font>

773
01:25:44,939 --> 01:25:47,305
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It was a wonderful day.</font>

774
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:01,585
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It's so strange.</font>

775
01:26:04,825 --> 01:26:09,694
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">That I never came
across this fragrance before.</font>

776
01:26:14,035 --> 01:26:16,299
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Can I</font>

777
01:26:17,939 --> 01:26:19,304
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">ask you</font>

778
01:26:22,643 --> 01:26:24,076
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">a personal question?</font>

779
01:26:29,717 --> 01:26:31,685
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Personal?</font>

780
01:26:34,322 --> 01:26:35,584
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Look closely.</font>

781
01:26:37,325 --> 01:26:40,988
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Which one of these is the best,
I mean...</font>

782
01:26:42,930 --> 01:26:46,195
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Which one shows a woman
in complete ecstasy?</font>

783
01:26:48,636 --> 01:26:49,796
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Here, look.</font>

784
01:26:58,112 --> 01:26:59,773
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">And this one.</font>

785
01:27:06,220 --> 01:27:07,482
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Are you acting like a lunatic?</font>

786
01:27:07,622 --> 01:27:10,182
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">That one was a bit pretentious, no?</font>

787
01:27:10,725 --> 01:27:12,090
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">How about this one?</font>

788
01:27:23,037 --> 01:27:25,403
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">She looks like she's in pain, huh?
A bit different, no?</font>

789
01:27:30,711 --> 01:27:33,271
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Tell me, which one do you like best?</font>

790
01:27:35,916 --> 01:27:38,578
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Why are you doing this?</font>

791
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:40,885
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I asked what's the best one?</font>

792
01:27:41,722 --> 01:27:43,189
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">This is important to me.</font>

793
01:27:47,828 --> 01:27:48,988
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">The last one.</font>

794
01:27:51,532 --> 01:27:53,090
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">The last one?</font>

795
01:27:55,436 --> 01:27:57,904
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What's going on?</font>

796
01:27:58,039 --> 01:28:00,007
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It's just crazy.</font>

797
01:28:00,841 --> 01:28:03,867
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Over a hundred maidservants
barged in.</font>

798
01:28:04,011 --> 01:28:05,376
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">For what?</font>

799
01:28:05,813 --> 01:28:07,576
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Demanding 'Tale of Dark Valley.'</font>

800
01:28:09,517 --> 01:28:10,677
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Bitches...</font>

801
01:28:14,021 --> 01:28:15,784
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You mean, our book?</font>

802
01:28:16,323 --> 01:28:18,382
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">They read it again and again.</font>

803
01:28:18,526 --> 01:28:20,585
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">And never return it.</font>

804
01:28:21,228 --> 01:28:24,197
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">They've become complete addicts
after reading that book.</font>

805
01:28:28,135 --> 01:28:30,399
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Oh, goodness.</font>

806
01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:33,802
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">And who is this?</font>

807
01:28:35,142 --> 01:28:37,872
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Right, this is the artist!</font>

808
01:28:43,317 --> 01:28:44,978
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">But why the disguise?</font>

809
01:28:49,924 --> 01:28:52,392
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">No matter how difficult
your predicament is,</font>

810
01:28:52,827 --> 01:28:54,886
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">you should still have a drink.</font>

811
01:28:55,529 --> 01:28:57,895
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Since you're our key contributor.</font>

812
01:29:01,435 --> 01:29:03,801
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I'm sorry to decline.</font>

813
01:29:08,042 --> 01:29:10,977
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">The expression of pure ecstasy.</font>

814
01:29:11,812 --> 01:29:13,780
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It was the best.</font>

815
01:29:14,515 --> 01:29:17,575
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">A mixture of pain and pleasure
to the brink of death.</font>

816
01:29:19,220 --> 01:29:20,380
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You think so?</font>

817
01:29:20,821 --> 01:29:23,688
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I wasn't too convinced.</font>

818
01:29:26,127 --> 01:29:27,287
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">So then,</font>

819
01:29:28,829 --> 01:29:31,992
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">you're saying
there's something better?</font>

820
01:29:32,733 --> 01:29:37,102
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Well, it should look
like a woman's about to sneeze.</font>

821
01:29:38,539 --> 01:29:40,200
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Sneeze?</font>

822
01:29:41,642 --> 01:29:43,473
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Yes, like this.</font>

823
01:29:50,117 --> 01:29:51,982
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">That's ridiculous!</font>

824
01:29:52,119 --> 01:29:53,381
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You mean, women...</font>

825
01:29:56,824 --> 01:29:58,587
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Make that kind of face?</font>

826
01:30:13,641 --> 01:30:15,700
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What money are you talking about?</font>

827
01:30:15,843 --> 01:30:17,868
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What? 'Maiden Ok Ryung'?</font>

828
01:30:19,213 --> 01:30:20,976
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What's wrong with you?</font>

829
01:30:21,816 --> 01:30:23,181
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I mean 'Tale of the Dark Valley'!</font>

830
01:30:26,620 --> 01:30:27,882
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Hey!</font>

831
01:30:28,022 --> 01:30:30,183
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">So you want it all for yourself?</font>

832
01:30:30,324 --> 01:30:31,586
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What about you?</font>

833
01:30:32,026 --> 01:30:32,993
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Last time, you...</font>

834
01:30:33,127 --> 01:30:36,585
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">That's right,
you took all of 'Boudoir Tales'.</font>

835
01:30:37,031 --> 01:30:39,591
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Hwang, that was then.</font>

836
01:30:39,934 --> 01:30:41,492
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I promise to make it up to you.</font>

837
01:30:42,036 --> 01:30:44,300
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Come on, give me a break.</font>

838
01:30:44,438 --> 01:30:45,598
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Hey!</font>

839
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:48,198
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">A huge hit doesn't come often.</font>

840
01:30:48,542 --> 01:30:50,066
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Share the wealth, okay?</font>

841
01:30:50,711 --> 01:30:52,076
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Forget it.</font>

842
01:31:08,329 --> 01:31:09,694
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Wait.</font>

843
01:31:10,130 --> 01:31:12,997
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">So you really wrote
'Tale of the Dark Valley'?</font>

844
01:31:13,734 --> 01:31:16,396
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I loved that book!</font>

845
01:31:17,338 --> 01:31:19,101
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You were one of my readers?</font>

846
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:21,401
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">- I am, too.
- Hold on.</font>

847
01:31:22,042 --> 01:31:24,476
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">This gentleman
made 'Tale of the Dark Valley'.</font>

848
01:31:25,012 --> 01:31:27,572
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">He may as well have written it.
Treat him well.</font>

849
01:31:27,715 --> 01:31:29,376
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Of course.</font>

850
01:31:29,817 --> 01:31:34,277
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You double booked like the last time
when that eunuch came, huh?</font>

851
01:31:34,822 --> 01:31:36,983
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Not today, okay?</font>

852
01:31:38,525 --> 01:31:41,983
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Hey, give me another girl, will you?</font>

853
01:31:48,435 --> 01:31:53,998
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Your Highness, you wanted to hear
about current events.</font>

854
01:31:55,342 --> 01:31:58,175
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What would you like to know?</font>

855
01:31:59,313 --> 01:32:03,079
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Well, about what's going on
in the world.</font>

856
01:32:03,918 --> 01:32:06,978
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Any subject in particular?</font>

857
01:32:08,923 --> 01:32:15,385
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">We just wanted to know if you have
a special area of interest.</font>

858
01:32:17,131 --> 01:32:20,692
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Do you get to hear</font>

859
01:32:21,235 --> 01:32:24,295
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">a lot of rumors and gossip?</font>

860
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:27,798
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">For instance?</font>

861
01:32:28,442 --> 01:32:29,875
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Well, you see.</font>

862
01:32:30,911 --> 01:32:35,177
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">How about something scandalous?</font>

863
01:32:39,320 --> 01:32:40,981
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Scandalous?</font>

864
01:33:09,817 --> 01:33:12,081
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Yes, that female is surely strange.</font>

865
01:33:12,820 --> 01:33:14,981
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">There's only one male,</font>

866
01:33:15,422 --> 01:33:17,982
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">but she couldn't stand him
and killed him.</font>

867
01:33:21,528 --> 01:33:24,395
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Do you know what decapitation is?</font>

868
01:33:24,732 --> 01:33:27,997
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">My Lady? Decapitation?</font>

869
01:33:28,335 --> 01:33:32,499
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You mean, to cut the head
and limbs of the body?</font>

870
01:33:34,241 --> 01:33:37,074
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Is that what you mean, my Lady?</font>

871
01:33:38,312 --> 01:33:39,210
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Yes</font>

872
01:33:39,613 --> 01:33:41,877
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Yes, I do know about it.</font>

873
01:33:42,416 --> 01:33:45,681
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Don't they tie the body to horses?</font>

874
01:33:48,622 --> 01:33:53,685
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It's not that merciful and quick.</font>

875
01:33:57,631 --> 01:34:03,797
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">This punishment is done
with a rusty and dull blade.</font>

876
01:34:05,639 --> 01:34:08,005
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">A dull blade is used</font>

877
01:34:08,842 --> 01:34:12,972
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">to slowly and painfully</font>

878
01:34:13,614 --> 01:34:16,174
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">slice off the limbs.</font>

879
01:34:18,519 --> 01:34:22,080
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Why are you saying
such horrible things, my Lady?</font>

880
01:34:24,625 --> 01:34:28,288
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">If you do not honestly answer
the questions I'm about to ask you,</font>

881
01:34:29,129 --> 01:34:33,293
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">this punishment will befall on you,
do you understand me?</font>

882
01:34:34,234 --> 01:34:35,496
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">My Lady...</font>

883
01:34:37,337 --> 01:34:42,969
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Why did those wenches today
keep whispering behind my back?</font>

884
01:34:44,511 --> 01:34:46,979
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Well, that's because...</font>

885
01:34:56,523 --> 01:34:59,981
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You must not understand fully
the meaning of decapitation.</font>

886
01:35:00,627 --> 01:35:02,094
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">My Lady.</font>

887
01:35:07,234 --> 01:35:09,702
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Everyone in the northern parts
are against it.</font>

888
01:35:10,437 --> 01:35:13,895
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">But it's where it needs to go.</font>

889
01:35:15,342 --> 01:35:18,470
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">But everyone in the northern parts
dislike the ending.</font>

890
01:35:18,612 --> 01:35:20,375
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Look here man.</font>

891
01:35:20,514 --> 01:35:22,675
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Just because they dislike it</font>

892
01:35:22,816 --> 01:35:26,274
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I can't let them get
in the way of my story.</font>

893
01:35:26,420 --> 01:35:29,685
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Please, what are you saying?</font>

894
01:35:29,823 --> 01:35:32,690
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Our biggest readership
is in the north.</font>

895
01:35:32,826 --> 01:35:37,388
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">If they don't want a sad ending,
we cannot kill the characters.</font>

896
01:35:37,531 --> 01:35:40,796
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">This is an omen of ruin!</font>

897
01:35:41,135 --> 01:35:43,797
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">How can the readers influence
the ending of a story?</font>

898
01:35:43,937 --> 01:35:46,405
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I've never heard of such absurdity.</font>

899
01:35:47,241 --> 01:35:50,267
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I have an idea!</font>

900
01:35:50,410 --> 01:35:53,174
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">They both survive and head north.</font>

901
01:35:53,313 --> 01:35:56,771
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I will not tolerate
such an irresponsible conclusion.</font>

902
01:35:57,718 --> 01:35:59,185
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Anyway!</font>

903
01:35:59,319 --> 01:36:00,581
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">And another thing!</font>

904
01:36:00,721 --> 01:36:04,885
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">How can the artist be this late
to the meeting!</font>

905
01:36:28,215 --> 01:36:30,183
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">We're closed.</font>

906
01:36:39,927 --> 01:36:41,986
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I said we're closed.</font>

907
01:36:48,535 --> 01:36:50,002
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">'Chu Wol Sek'.</font>

908
01:37:30,711 --> 01:37:34,374
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">The artist who drew this,
did he see everything?</font>

909
01:37:43,023 --> 01:37:44,285
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Who is it?</font>

910
01:37:45,225 --> 01:37:47,489
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Judging from his skills,
he's no amateur.</font>

911
01:37:51,331 --> 01:37:53,492
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I cannot</font>

912
01:37:57,638 --> 01:37:59,799
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">divulge his identity.</font>

913
01:38:04,811 --> 01:38:06,676
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You cannot divulge?</font>

914
01:38:10,117 --> 01:38:11,675
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">How could you?</font>

915
01:38:15,422 --> 01:38:22,191
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">He committed himself to this endeavor
on my word alone.</font>

916
01:38:23,630 --> 01:38:26,292
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">So your commitment with him
is important,</font>

917
01:38:27,834 --> 01:38:33,795
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">but the fact that I risked my life
to come here is not?</font>

918
01:38:40,514 --> 01:38:42,175
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">That's not what I meant.</font>

919
01:38:45,018 --> 01:38:47,486
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I can't tell you his name.</font>

920
01:38:59,933 --> 01:39:01,298
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I see.</font>

921
01:39:05,639 --> 01:39:07,106
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I understand now.</font>

922
01:39:23,523 --> 01:39:26,788
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">My Lady!</font>

923
01:39:29,830 --> 01:39:33,197
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">How dare you!
How dare you intervene!</font>

924
01:39:48,715 --> 01:39:52,879
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">My Lady, do not leave like this.</font>

925
01:40:52,412 --> 01:40:53,970
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I'm overwhelmed, your Majesty.</font>

926
01:40:57,717 --> 01:40:59,082
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Don't be.</font>

927
01:41:02,022 --> 01:41:04,081
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Instead, I'm very happy</font>

928
01:41:06,226 --> 01:41:07,989
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">you asked for me.</font>

929
01:41:47,534 --> 01:41:52,597
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What has caused you
so much distress?</font>

930
01:42:00,514 --> 01:42:02,482
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It's just so awful.</font>

931
01:43:28,034 --> 01:43:29,296
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What?</font>

932
01:43:29,636 --> 01:43:31,695
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Don't tell me you're already tired.</font>

933
01:43:32,038 --> 01:43:33,403
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">No, your Highness.</font>

934
01:43:33,940 --> 01:43:37,467
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It's just a general rule
to stop at this point.</font>

935
01:43:39,012 --> 01:43:42,379
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You said you'd go on
until his tongue started to droop!</font>

936
01:43:48,021 --> 01:43:51,787
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">This is it? Is this all?</font>

937
01:43:52,525 --> 01:43:54,993
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">For this convicted felon?</font>

938
01:43:56,029 --> 01:43:57,792
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">My Lady, he's had all he can take.</font>

939
01:43:57,931 --> 01:44:01,697
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">This man is hovering
between life and death.</font>

940
01:44:03,436 --> 01:44:04,596
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">His tongue...</font>

941
01:44:06,539 --> 01:44:10,373
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">His tongue is trapped in his mouth
as his jaws are shut tight.</font>

942
01:44:18,218 --> 01:44:19,685
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It's because</font>

943
01:44:21,221 --> 01:44:24,588
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">he's afraid
of blurting out the truth.</font>

944
01:44:28,728 --> 01:44:30,992
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">There should be more to the torture.</font>

945
01:44:33,133 --> 01:44:35,192
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What's the next level?</font>

946
01:44:36,136 --> 01:44:39,799
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">First, we break his legs,</font>

947
01:44:40,840 --> 01:44:47,370
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">then burn him with a hot iron,
Your Highness.</font>

948
01:44:47,914 --> 01:44:49,472
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">First, we need to set him down.</font>

949
01:44:49,816 --> 01:44:51,374
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">He will die like this.</font>

950
01:45:12,639 --> 01:45:14,402
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Everyone, leave.</font>

951
01:45:34,327 --> 01:45:39,196
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Will it all end
if the artist steps forward?</font>

952
01:45:44,637 --> 01:45:48,095
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What are you saying?</font>

953
01:45:49,509 --> 01:45:51,477
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">He's like this
since he wouldn't reveal the artist.</font>

954
01:45:53,813 --> 01:45:55,075
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">So if he is found,</font>

955
01:45:56,816 --> 01:45:58,283
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">will he be released?</font>

956
01:46:00,920 --> 01:46:04,185
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Do you know who the artist is?</font>

957
01:46:26,613 --> 01:46:28,581
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It doesn't matter.</font>

958
01:46:30,517 --> 01:46:33,486
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I want to hear it from his own lips.</font>

959
01:46:37,423 --> 01:46:39,789
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">His Majesty will intervene now.</font>

960
01:46:41,628 --> 01:46:43,789
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">So get ready.</font>

961
01:47:01,614 --> 01:47:05,380
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Who do you think
is the most pitiful man in the world?</font>

962
01:47:06,820 --> 01:47:09,687
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I don't understand, your Majesty.</font>

963
01:47:11,524 --> 01:47:13,685
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I always thought it was you.</font>

964
01:47:15,528 --> 01:47:21,592
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Giving up your manhood
to be near the woman you love.</font>

965
01:47:23,136 --> 01:47:24,694
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">How pathetic.</font>

966
01:47:31,211 --> 01:47:35,875
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I do not understand what you mean,
your Majesty.</font>

967
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:42,481
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You think I don't know?</font>

968
01:47:44,324 --> 01:47:45,882
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You fool.</font>

969
01:47:48,027 --> 01:47:49,585
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It doesn't matter.</font>

970
01:47:53,333 --> 01:47:54,891
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">But you know what?</font>

971
01:48:02,642 --> 01:48:05,372
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Now that I'm here with you
at this time of the night,</font>

972
01:48:08,014 --> 01:48:10,676
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I don't know who's more pitiful,
you or me?</font>

973
01:48:14,420 --> 01:48:17,184
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I never understood you before.</font>

974
01:48:20,226 --> 01:48:22,285
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">But now I'm beginning to.</font>

975
01:48:25,131 --> 01:48:26,689
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Your Majesty.</font>

976
01:48:29,335 --> 01:48:30,802
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Let's go.</font>

977
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:35,307
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">This fellow.</font>

978
01:48:37,410 --> 01:48:40,072
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Let's see how great he is.</font>

979
01:49:02,535 --> 01:49:04,002
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What an odd fellow.</font>

980
01:49:04,637 --> 01:49:06,901
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Even breaking his legs
doesn't make him talk.</font>

981
01:49:12,512 --> 01:49:15,276
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You should be used to this by now.</font>

982
01:49:18,518 --> 01:49:21,180
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">So, what's next?</font>

983
01:49:21,321 --> 01:49:26,190
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Next, we brand him with a hot iron</font>

984
01:49:26,326 --> 01:49:28,487
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">and burn him, your Majesty.</font>

985
01:49:42,041 --> 01:49:44,066
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What a very strange fellow.</font>

986
01:49:50,316 --> 01:49:51,578
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">How do you feel now?</font>

987
01:49:53,720 --> 01:49:56,086
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Isn't this enough
to soothe your anger?</font>

988
01:49:59,025 --> 01:50:00,492
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Don't you think?</font>

989
01:50:14,140 --> 01:50:16,768
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">We will start again after meal time.</font>

990
01:50:18,011 --> 01:50:20,275
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">So prepare for the next round.</font>

991
01:50:52,111 --> 01:50:55,478
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Careful, careful.</font>

992
01:51:16,235 --> 01:51:18,795
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">The Inspections bastard writes it.</font>

993
01:51:19,739 --> 01:51:22,105
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">And the Justice bastard draws it.</font>

994
01:51:29,215 --> 01:51:30,876
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Inspector Kim.</font>

995
01:51:32,018 --> 01:51:33,781
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Let's see your face.</font>

996
01:51:34,420 --> 01:51:36,081
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Eunuchs.</font>

997
01:51:37,023 --> 01:51:38,581
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">The Secret Police.</font>

998
01:51:39,826 --> 01:51:41,794
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">If they're eunuchs, then...</font>

999
01:51:42,728 --> 01:51:44,389
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">The jerks with no testicles?</font>

1000
01:51:46,532 --> 01:51:47,897
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You bastards.</font>

1001
01:51:49,035 --> 01:51:51,401
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Why don't you go home
and clean your behinds,</font>

1002
01:51:51,537 --> 01:51:53,198
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">and stop following people.</font>

1003
01:51:54,740 --> 01:52:01,475
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You fools, you really are clueless.</font>

1004
01:52:03,716 --> 01:52:06,184
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">We let you get away.</font>

1005
01:52:09,522 --> 01:52:14,084
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Always listen
to the order from here.</font>

1006
01:52:14,427 --> 01:52:20,991
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">That's because you have nothing
down there to issue an order.</font>

1007
01:52:25,938 --> 01:52:29,305
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Wonder if you'll still talk like that
after you're dragged back.</font>

1008
01:52:31,511 --> 01:52:36,471
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Aren't you worried
about what awaits you there?</font>

1009
01:52:36,616 --> 01:52:39,483
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Have you no regard for the law?</font>

1010
01:52:39,619 --> 01:52:43,180
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Let us handle them.</font>

1011
01:52:43,523 --> 01:52:47,084
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It's been a long time
since I've had to use these.</font>

1012
01:52:48,127 --> 01:52:52,587
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I'll go first.
You little bastards.</font>

1013
01:52:52,732 --> 01:52:53,892
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Oh my...</font>

1014
01:52:58,538 --> 01:52:59,800
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Are you okay?</font>

1015
01:53:00,740 --> 01:53:02,207
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I'm going.</font>

1016
01:53:10,016 --> 01:53:11,779
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Hey, Justice guy.</font>

1017
01:53:14,220 --> 01:53:15,983
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Don't you know these friends?</font>

1018
01:53:22,228 --> 01:53:23,490
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I have to play with them first.</font>

1019
01:55:41,734 --> 01:55:43,099
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Look here, Eunuch Cho!</font>

1020
01:55:50,409 --> 01:55:51,967
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">If you kill him,</font>

1021
01:55:55,414 --> 01:56:01,182
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I might become disheartened
and be inclined to say anything.</font>

1022
01:56:05,024 --> 01:56:09,484
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You don't have the guts.</font>

1023
01:56:14,633 --> 01:56:16,396
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It's not in you.</font>

1024
01:56:17,737 --> 01:56:20,706
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I myself don't know
what's inside me.</font>

1025
01:56:23,409 --> 01:56:25,468
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">So how can you be so sure?</font>

1026
01:56:32,017 --> 01:56:33,484
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Let him go.</font>

1027
01:56:38,724 --> 01:56:41,386
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Get him out of here
before I change my mind.</font>

1028
01:57:10,423 --> 01:57:13,483
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Carry him.</font>

1029
01:57:36,015 --> 01:57:37,175
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Wait.</font>

1030
01:57:44,123 --> 01:57:45,283
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Inspector Kim.</font>

1031
01:57:48,527 --> 01:57:49,994
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Am I not right?</font>

1032
01:57:52,731 --> 01:57:54,289
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What are you talking about?</font>

1033
01:57:58,737 --> 01:58:03,174
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">A person who can't speak
is a dead person.</font>

1034
01:58:06,212 --> 01:58:07,474
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Right?</font>

1035
01:58:48,721 --> 01:58:50,382
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">So, you've caught on.</font>

1036
01:58:53,325 --> 01:58:55,384
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">They said you were going
to block his mouth,</font>

1037
01:58:56,629 --> 01:58:58,290
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">and to watch over you.</font>

1038
01:59:01,033 --> 01:59:02,500
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I knew it.</font>

1039
01:59:17,016 --> 01:59:18,381
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Why did you do it?</font>

1040
01:59:20,319 --> 01:59:24,881
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It's you who said to always listen
to the order from the head.</font>

1041
01:59:32,531 --> 01:59:33,691
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You see.</font>

1042
01:59:40,139 --> 01:59:42,972
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">There was an order from here, too.</font>

1043
02:00:06,832 --> 02:00:09,494
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I can trust you, right?</font>

1044
02:01:04,423 --> 02:01:05,981
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What happened?</font>

1045
02:01:07,926 --> 02:01:10,292
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">We caught him and brought him back.</font>

1046
02:01:11,530 --> 02:01:12,997
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What do you want to do?</font>

1047
02:01:27,513 --> 02:01:30,277
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Of course, I was angry at first,</font>

1048
02:01:31,817 --> 02:01:33,682
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">but I feel better now.</font>

1049
02:01:41,427 --> 02:01:43,691
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">That was quick.</font>

1050
02:01:55,240 --> 02:01:57,174
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I knew from the start.</font>

1051
02:02:00,813 --> 02:02:06,877
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You wanted to hear
something else from him.</font>

1052
02:02:11,023 --> 02:02:13,389
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I don't know what you mean.</font>

1053
02:02:16,128 --> 02:02:20,087
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I see fearlessness in his eyes
when he looks at you.</font>

1054
02:02:22,634 --> 02:02:23,999
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Looks like...</font>

1055
02:02:27,039 --> 02:02:28,597
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Looks like...</font>

1056
02:02:32,411 --> 02:02:35,380
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Looks like you've slept
together many times.</font>

1057
02:02:35,814 --> 02:02:40,080
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What are you saying, your Majesty?</font>

1058
02:02:43,222 --> 02:02:46,282
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It's the male foolishness that puts
the fearlessness in his eyes</font>

1059
02:02:48,327 --> 02:02:50,693
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">after the first few times.</font>

1060
02:02:51,730 --> 02:02:57,498
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">But it's the truth.</font>

1061
02:02:59,138 --> 02:03:01,197
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Your words are too rash.</font>

1062
02:03:14,419 --> 02:03:16,080
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Not even once.</font>

1063
02:03:19,625 --> 02:03:24,289
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You've seduced a woman
who's not even once loved a man.</font>

1064
02:03:29,334 --> 02:03:31,393
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">And you used her as a muse</font>

1065
02:03:33,939 --> 02:03:35,600
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">for your writing.</font>

1066
02:03:42,014 --> 02:03:45,575
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">But this woman
did not want to believe that.</font>

1067
02:03:48,921 --> 02:03:52,379
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">She would have forgiven you
had you said</font>

1068
02:03:53,826 --> 02:03:55,987
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">it was out of love.</font>

1069
02:03:57,429 --> 02:03:59,795
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">But you refused to bend your pride.</font>

1070
02:04:01,633 --> 02:04:04,295
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It didn't even matter
that you didn't love her.</font>

1071
02:04:04,436 --> 02:04:06,301
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I can't stand this anymore!</font>

1072
02:04:06,939 --> 02:04:08,804
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Where's Eunuch Cho?</font>

1073
02:04:09,608 --> 02:04:11,075
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Your servant?</font>

1074
02:04:31,430 --> 02:04:33,091
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Why couldn't you just lie</font>

1075
02:04:34,433 --> 02:04:37,493
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">and tell her you loved her?</font>

1076
02:04:43,809 --> 02:04:45,572
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Why do you</font>

1077
02:04:50,215 --> 02:04:52,877
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">make such a miserable fool of her?</font>

1078
02:05:07,532 --> 02:05:10,990
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I will turn you into a eunuch
and you will be by her side for life.</font>

1079
02:05:13,238 --> 02:05:14,603
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Operate on him.</font>

1080
02:05:21,413 --> 02:05:23,574
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Your Majesty, he is too aged,</font>

1081

- It's not a concern.</font>

1082
02:05:29,121 --> 02:05:31,783
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">And since he's a very indecent man,</font>

1083
02:05:33,225 --> 02:05:35,887
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">cut as deep as you can.</font>

1084
02:05:47,139 --> 02:05:49,972
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Your Majesty! I seduced him!</font>

1085
02:05:50,709 --> 02:05:53,177
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I used my power and my influence</font>

1086
02:05:53,612 --> 02:05:55,273
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">to force him into it.</font>

1087
02:05:55,414 --> 02:05:57,075
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Can't you see?</font>

1088
02:05:58,717 --> 02:06:02,084
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It was me
who brought this onto myself.</font>

1089
02:06:03,622 --> 02:06:07,991
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Please excuse him and spare his life.</font>

1090
02:06:12,631 --> 02:06:14,599
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Have you no shame?</font>

1091
02:06:16,034 --> 02:06:17,501
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It's the truth.</font>

1092
02:06:19,938 --> 02:06:22,964
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I was the one who wanted him.</font>

1093
02:06:24,409 --> 02:06:25,876
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">So please...</font>

1094
02:06:31,316 --> 02:06:32,783
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">My Lady.</font>

1095
02:06:44,129 --> 02:06:45,494
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Outside,</font>

1096
02:06:47,733 --> 02:06:49,792
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">flowers were in bloom everywhere.</font>

1097
02:06:52,838 --> 02:06:56,865
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You teased me that day.</font>

1098
02:07:04,316 --> 02:07:06,477
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">But you also enjoyed it.</font>

1099
02:07:10,322 --> 02:07:12,882
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Suddenly a bee flew over to you,</font>

1100
02:07:15,527 --> 02:07:17,586
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">and I chased it away.</font>

1101
02:07:23,735 --> 02:07:29,105
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It was such a beautiful day.</font>

1102
02:07:36,515 --> 02:07:37,982
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Since then,</font>

1103
02:07:39,618 --> 02:07:45,784
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">there hasn't been a day
that I did not think of you.</font>

1104
02:07:49,728 --> 02:07:50,888
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">But,</font>

1105
02:07:52,230 --> 02:07:55,097
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">an indecent imagination
had taken me over.</font>

1106
02:07:57,235 --> 02:07:59,100
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">But I could not differentiate</font>

1107
02:08:00,138 --> 02:08:06,168
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">whether it was love
or an indecent desire.</font>

1108
02:08:10,515 --> 02:08:18,388
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">That is why I had such a hard time
professing my true feelings.</font>

1109
02:08:22,627 --> 02:08:29,999
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">If my life hangs on the word love,
how can I say it?</font>

1110
02:08:34,639 --> 02:08:35,901
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Simply,</font>

1111
02:08:37,709 --> 02:08:39,677
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I will keep it in my heart</font>

1112
02:08:43,415 --> 02:08:46,077
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">until I see you in the afterworld.</font>

1113
02:09:01,433 --> 02:09:03,094
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I will.</font>

1114
02:09:07,339 --> 02:09:09,671
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I will wait.</font>

1115
02:09:20,719 --> 02:09:22,084
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">In front of me</font>

1116
02:09:28,026 --> 02:09:29,391
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">you say, 'I will'?</font>

1117
02:09:32,030 --> 02:09:33,793
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">And, 'I will wait'?</font>

1118
02:09:41,439 --> 02:09:43,464
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You dare say that</font>

1119
02:09:47,212 --> 02:09:48,770
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">in front of me?</font>

1120
02:10:38,230 --> 02:10:43,896
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Anyway, what does it matter?</font>

1121
02:10:47,439 --> 02:10:49,669
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You two will meet
in the afterworld anyway.</font>

1122
02:10:52,911 --> 02:10:54,776
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">This would be all useless.</font>

1123
02:11:04,322 --> 02:11:06,085
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I am the loser.</font>

1124
02:11:12,831 --> 02:11:18,394
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">The one who loves the most
is the loser.</font>

1125

<font face="sans-serif" size="53">The top is made of china,
and the bottom is...</font>

1126
02:12:44,622 --> 02:12:46,988
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">That's enough. What is it?</font>

1127
02:12:47,525 --> 02:12:50,688
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">'Chu Wol Sek'.
The last chapter of his memoirs.</font>

1128
02:12:51,029 --> 02:12:53,998
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">- Do you have it?
- You should have come earlier!</font>

1129
02:12:54,132 --> 02:12:55,394
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You're too late.</font>

1130
02:12:57,335 --> 02:12:59,303
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What a pain.</font>

1131
02:13:00,338 --> 02:13:01,999
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Wait! Wait!</font>

1132
02:13:04,008 --> 02:13:08,172
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I'm too curious,
What happened to the Queen?</font>

1133
02:13:09,114 --> 02:13:11,082
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Probably rotting in the palace,</font>

1134
02:13:11,416 --> 02:13:13,281
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">She's just cooped up there,</font>

1135
02:13:15,720 --> 02:13:17,381
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">And what about Inspector Kim?</font>

1136
02:13:42,113 --> 02:13:44,274
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Easy, easy...</font>

1137
02:14:13,411 --> 02:14:14,673
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Inspector Kim!</font>

1138
02:14:21,419 --> 02:14:22,579
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Wait.</font>

1139
02:14:23,221 --> 02:14:25,382
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Why do you turn your back on us?</font>

1140
02:14:32,430 --> 02:14:33,795
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Come on.</font>

1141
02:14:35,133 --> 02:14:39,001
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Aren't you glad to see us?</font>

1142
02:14:45,910 --> 02:14:48,777
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Indecent</font>

1143
02:15:00,825 --> 02:15:03,487
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It just, happened.</font>

1144
02:15:10,134 --> 02:15:14,400
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What brings you two this far?</font>

1145
02:15:30,922 --> 02:15:34,881
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Did you write another novel?</font>

1146
02:15:38,229 --> 02:15:40,993
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">A high official falls in love</font>

1147
02:15:41,733 --> 02:15:44,395
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">with a prisoner
while interrogating him,</font>

1148
02:15:45,336 --> 02:15:49,966
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">He falls in love at first sight,</font>

1149
02:15:52,010 --> 02:15:53,568
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">This prisoner</font>

1150
02:15:55,813 --> 02:16:01,979
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">is surprisingly handsome
and has a prim air,</font>

1151
02:16:02,720 --> 02:16:06,281
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">But what's odd about this prisoner</font>

1152
02:16:07,325 --> 02:16:12,285
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">is that the more he gets tortured,
the more he enjoys it,</font>

1153
02:16:13,531 --> 02:16:17,490
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">The more I tortured,</font>

1154
02:16:17,635 --> 02:16:19,102
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I don 't get it at all!</font>

1155
02:16:19,237 --> 02:16:21,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">- He enjoys being tortured?
- Yes.</font>

1156
02:16:22,440 --> 02:16:25,068
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Hwang, what do you think?</font>

1157
02:16:25,910 --> 02:16:29,175
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It's absolutely shocking.</font>

1158
02:16:29,614 --> 02:16:32,378
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">But I have a question.</font>

1159
02:16:32,517 --> 02:16:34,075
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Yes, go ahead.</font>

1160
02:16:34,218 --> 02:16:37,483
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Wouldn't there be only one position?</font>

1161
02:16:37,622 --> 02:16:40,182
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">If it's between guys,
this would be the only position.</font>

1162
02:16:40,325 --> 02:16:44,591
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Then wouldn't the illustrations
be too dull?</font>

1163
02:16:48,333 --> 02:16:49,891
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You fool.</font>

1164
02:16:52,036 --> 02:16:55,199
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">I thought of a title already.</font>

1165
02:16:55,340 --> 02:16:58,173
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It's probably going to be
too explicit as usual.</font>

1166
02:16:58,309 --> 02:17:01,073
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Since there are two sticks,
'The Secret Tale of the Twin Rods'?</font>

1167
02:17:01,512 --> 02:17:06,575
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You haven't changed a bit!
No, no.</font>

1168
02:17:07,418 --> 02:17:11,980
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It's about two old friends.</font>

1169
02:17:12,824 --> 02:17:16,089
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">'Mates'. How about 'Mates'?</font>

1170
02:17:18,129 --> 02:17:19,494
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">'Mates'?</font>

1171
02:17:23,134 --> 02:17:26,399
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You've been away too long.</font>

1172
02:17:26,537 --> 02:17:29,005
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">You've lost your touch.</font>

1173
02:17:29,140 --> 02:17:32,871
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">That's strange. I quite like it.</font>

1174
02:17:33,011 --> 02:17:34,376
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Come on.</font>

1175
02:17:36,514 --> 02:17:38,675
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Anyway, who knows?</font>

1176
02:17:39,517 --> 02:17:42,975
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Who knows how it might be
centuries from now?</font>

1177
02:17:43,621 --> 02:17:46,089
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">The world will be dirtier than ever.</font>

1178
02:17:46,524 --> 02:17:48,685
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Titles will have to be more erotic.</font>

1179
02:18:02,040 --> 02:18:03,166
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Hold on.</font>

1180
02:18:04,208 --> 02:18:06,267
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Don't be surprised.</font>

1181
02:18:20,525 --> 02:18:22,083
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">It's moving.</font>

1182
02:18:23,127 --> 02:18:24,492
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Wow.</font>

1183
02:18:24,929 --> 02:18:26,988
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">This...</font>

1184
02:18:27,532 --> 02:18:29,295
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">What do you call this?</font>

1185
02:18:30,134 --> 02:18:33,001
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">- Since it moves...
- Yes, since it moves...</font>

1186
02:18:33,137 --> 02:18:35,002
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Yeah, with pictures.</font>

1187
02:18:38,209 --> 02:18:39,574
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">Moving pictures!</font>

1188
02:18:41,012 --> 02:18:42,172
<font face="sans-serif" size="53">How about that?</font>
