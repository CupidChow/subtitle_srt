00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,020

2
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,090
Long time no see.

3
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,210
Yeah, likewise.

4
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:29,500
Can anyone really forget... their first love?

5
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:34,210
Say, Haneda. I'll watch over you as you study every day after school.

6
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:35,620
Well...

7
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,590
Sensei? Can I start cleaning?

8
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,600
You're on cleaning duty too, right, Haneda?

9
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,000
That's right.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,660
I see. Then I'll leave you to it.

11
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,600
Thanks, Kamiyama-kun.

12
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,280
How... do you know my name?

13
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,110
Of course, I know. We're in the same class.

14
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,730
Oh? What's this?

15
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:20,070
It's something I'm still working on, so it's a bit clunky.

16
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,570
This is incredible!

17
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,890
Oh! Be careful!

18
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,610
Gosh, it's so cold!

19
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,620
I'm sorry. Use this one.

20
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:41,090
It's just water with dye in it. Sorry about that.

21
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:46,360
It's so blue! Seriously?

22
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:51,960
You're... kind of different from how I imagined.

23
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,740
What?

24
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,960
No, I'm talking about you.

25
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,750
In a good way, that is!

26
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,850
Thanks.

27
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,180
You're smart aren't you, Kamiyama-kun?

28
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,230
No, that's not true.

29
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:12,550
I heard you're trying to get a scholarship to study science and technology at Keio University.

30
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:16,210
And I thought your contraption was a pile of junk, but it was actually impressive.

31
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,780
"Junk"?

32
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,220
Oh, no! I mean—

33
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,150
I meant it was different than I imagined. In a good way, that is.

34
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,100
Thanks.

35
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,450
I'm thinking of displaying it at the school cultural festival.

36
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,110
It's called a "Rube Goldberg Machine."
(T/N: deliberately inefficient mechanism)

37
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:37,550
Physics is considered difficult, so I want people to experience it in a fun way.

38
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:41,820
Like, why is the sky blue?

39
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,940
Sorry. I'm talking too much, aren't I?

40
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,020
You love it that much?

41
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,560
Yes, I do.

42
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,740
I love... physics.

43
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,970
- She's such a "pick-me" girl.
- Annoying.
(T/N: seeks male attention by vilifying other women)

44
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,650
She's been getting carried away lately, right?

45
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,190
I listen to this song whenever something bad happens to me.

46
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,810
It's okay. I'm used to it.

47
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:21,670
No, you shouldn't get used to that.

48
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:24,750
Those things are like lingering body blows.

49
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,780
They don't heal quickly.

50
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,500
Thanks.

51
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,170
I'm sure that no matter how many times someone falls in love...

52
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,400
their first love will always be special...

53
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,500
and cherished.

54
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,230
We are going to be late.

55
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,900
Sorry.

56
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,390
What's this? You usually just throw something on.

57
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:08,490
What do you mean? I'm perfect every day.

58
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,870

- They're cute.
- Aren't they?

64
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,830
They're like a king and queen, no?

65
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,190
Well, I guess?

66
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:12,280
What?

67
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:18,760
Let's bet on whether or not Kamiyama-san has a girlfriend.

68
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,960
- I... don't think he's married.
- Right.

69
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,440
Apparently, he's an acquaintance of Haneda-san's. Why not ask her?

70
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,950
What? They're friends?

71
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,280
I guess Haneda-san knows a lot of people.

72
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,480
She just goes around flirting with every guy she sees.

73
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,480
Do you really think so? I actually see her in a different light now.

74
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,150
I mean, take their honeymoon to Hakone. She was actually working over there.

75
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:45,540
Oh, please. Everyone is expected to work.

76
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,690
To think she's vying for Kamiyama-san when she's married to the King.

77
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:53,110
She's definitely going to cheat on him.

78
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:56,410
So that's how rumors start, is it?

79
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,920
Now, now, Haneda-san.

80
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:03,010
Don't worry. President is the only man for me.

00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,440
Hello.

82
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,800
Hello. Thanks for your hard work.

83
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,590
Can I help you?

84
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:13,800
I'd like to speak to Haneda-san.

85
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,700
Do you have a moment?

86
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:22,690
I'm about to go to a meeting and won't be free until around 3 o'clock.

87
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:26,850
Then could you drop by the reception venue after your meeting?

88
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,350
Okay.

89
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:32,290
Please excuse me.

90
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,240
So much for "President is the only man for me."

91
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,210
That's right. She's such a flirt.

92
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,010
Nobody's being serious.

93
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:50,210
It's okay. I'm used to it.

94
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:53,460
I don't think that's something you should get used to.

95
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:59,390
Let me know if you're ever having a hard time. I'm always around to lend an ear.

96
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,860
Thank you very much.

97
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:05,140
The client was thrilled with your suggestion!

98
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,410
I'll strive even harder.

99
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:08,900
I'm counting on you.

100
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,430
Absolutely. Thank you for today.

101
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,100
Wow!

102
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,080
Great reaction.

103
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,630
You did this?

104
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:38,150
Yeah. I'm still testing it out right now,

105
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:41,430
but I wanted you to see it first.

106
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,920
Shouldn't you show my manager first?

107
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:48,940
I figured I could get an honest opinion from you since you're honest and don't flatter.

108
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,960
It's really beautiful.

109
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,130
Glad to hear it. Thanks.

110
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:59,070
I think clients who want nighttime weddings would love this.

111
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,200
- Really?
- Yeah.

112
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,540

00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,150
Oh, can you arrange for flowers too?

00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,420
I sure can.

115
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:15,170
A rain of petals from above would be amazing!

116
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,940
Careful!

117
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,000
May I?

118
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:32,560
May you... what?

119
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,090
That idea of yours... May I have it?

120
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,540
- Of course.
- Great.

121
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,800
A rain of petals, right?

122
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,320
Come in.

123
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,940
Excuse me.

- Hi.
- Hello.

125
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:58,690
- Are things going well?
- Yes.

00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:02,180
- About the plan I put forward before...
- Yes?

127
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:06,000
May I present it to you again with a few changes?

128
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,410
Sure. I'm looking forward to it.

129
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,740
Thank you very much.

130
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:15,140
I actually received an excellent idea from your wife.

131
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,150
- "My wife"?
- Yes.

132
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:21,880
It's completely different having input from someone who's always involved at the venue.

133
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,300
I'm pleased to hear she's been of help.

134
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:28,590
However, I'm concerned that she may be causing you trouble.

135
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:29,880
What?

136
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:35,790
Oh, it's nothing. It's just that... she's often misunderstood.

137
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:43,190
I believe those who misunderstand her don't know the real Haneda-san.

138
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:52,200
Oh, my apologies. I'm a high school classmate of hers.

139
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,060
From high school?

140
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,570
Yes.

141

Long time no see.

142
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,520
Yeah, likewise.

143
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:11,140
Yes, I heard.

144
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,620
Now then, I will report back if anything happens.

145
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,920
- Please and thank you.
- I'll see myself out.

146
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:32,500
Red snapper sashimi! And this here is red-snapper rice?

147
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,120
- Right.
- How nice!

148
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,150

159
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,210
I will!

160
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,730
Okay, I'll edit and upload it right away. Great job!

161
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:28,570
- Thanks.
- Thank you very much.

162
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,120
And I'll be off, too. Thanks for the food.

163
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,550
Oh, right! Maybe I'll have some wine before I go to bed.

164
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,730
Are you inviting me to join you?

165
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,560
No way!

166
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:52,490
I don't mind joining you. It'd be a waste to leave all of this food as well.

167
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:08,270
Is there something you wanted to talk about?

168
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,770
No.

169
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,470
Here. Have some cheese too.

170

What's with those puppy eyes? Looking at me like that won't get you any cheese!

178
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:50,480
Hey, do something about this dog!

179
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,140
Her name is Negi. Why don't you remember her name already?

180
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,180
I don't need to.

181
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,070
- Thanks for the meal.
- What?

182
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,670
- Negi? Come here.
- Hey!

183
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:05,650
Come on, Negi! Over here!

184
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:09,210
Hey!

185
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,270
That darn dog.

186
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,980
- Okay, I'm going to dig in!
- Oh! Wait a second.

187
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:23,200
Riku, what are you watching?

188
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,490
Today's video.

189
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:29,200
What's so fun about watching Ayaka and her husband acting all lovey-dovey?

190
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,780
- It's tasty!
- That's good.

191
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:35,750
Ayaka... Do you think she's okay?

192
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:40,450
What? She's the only one who's okay.

193
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:43,250
I mean, she's a celebrity now.

194
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,850
Aren't they spending a little too much time together?

195
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:50,850
They've been together practically every day lately.

196
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,670
They're so close!

197
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,370
What are you doing?

198
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:57,240
- Hello!
- Hello!

199
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,730
I just know they'll be moved!

200
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:04,510
Really? Maybe I should add more color to the flowers?

201
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,000
Oh, right.

202
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,530
For a reception hall like this, maybe light blue or pink?

203
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,810
I agree. Something more colorful.

204
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:16,130
- Oh? Like orange or something?
- Yes.

205
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:17,610
Togo?

206
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:20,310
You look like you're having fun.

207
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:23,610
Kamiyama-kun's effects are incredible, President.

208
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:27,340
I think the guests will be just as moved as the bride and groom.

209
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,230
I can't wait to see, then.

210
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:31,170
I'll do my best.

211
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:41,730
I'm having lunch with my wife after this. I'd love for you to join if you're available.

212
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:44,880
I'd be honored. It's been a while since I last saw Haneda-san, so it'd be perfect.

213
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,140
- Right?
- Right.

214
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:50,070
- Don't you have a meeting after this?
- What?

215
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:52,650
You should tell me these things in advance.

216
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:55,310
I'll pack up right away.

217
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:00,990
Are we supposed to have lunch today?

218
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,930
It doesn't hurt to have lunch occasionally.

219
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:09,940
I'm a regular here and come with my wife often.

220
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:13,610
The wine here is delicious. Do you have any preferences?

221
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:15,770
I'm happy with anything.

222
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:24,770
I'd like a wine that's a little lighter than usual.

223
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:28,600
This is gorgeous! Do you always come to places like this?

224
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:32,790
Well, it's only because the President is who he is.

225
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:35,730
I still don't get the taste of wine.

226
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:38,610
Chateaubriand? Durian? I have no clue.

227
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,670
I don't even know the names of the grapes.

228
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,060
I'm a shochu (distilled liquor) drinker.

229
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:45,180
And I'm all about beer.

230
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:53,090
I'm happy to have you here today since I usually only come with my wife.

231
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,740
So you got hooked on physics in high school?

232
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,080
That's right. I was completely obsessed.

233
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,930
You were already making all sorts of things back then, right?

234
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:10,580
That's right. In fact, that came up when we first spoke.

235
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,630
Oh, that pile of junk?

236
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:15,200
"Junk"? You're so mean.

237
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,070
Sorry. I remember laughing really hard, though.

238
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:20,500
Yes, your chest was all covered in blue.

239
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,030
That's right. It was hard to get rid of.

240
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,560
Sorry for talking nonsense.

241
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,100
Not at all.

242
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,150
Please excuse me for a moment.

243
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,610
Do you think President Nitta is angry?

244
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:43,690
What? No, he's fine.

245
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:46,230
You'd know if he was angry.

246
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:48,040
Really?

247
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,070
Hey, Kamiyama-kun.

248
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,690
What?

249
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:55,540
How do the President and I appear to you?

250
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,250
"How"?

251
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,910
I suppose you're the ideal married couple.

252
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,250
I see.

253
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,940
What? Are you boasting?

254
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,320
Of course not!

255
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:16,580
Thank you for the meal today, President.

256
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,830
I'll see you again, Haneda-san.

257
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:24,400
The meal sure was nice, wasn't it?

258
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:28,990
What?

259
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:35,400
President?

260
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,780
Well... are you angry?

261
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,080
President?

262
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:49,730
No, I'm not angry. I have a meeting now; please be quiet.

263
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:07,680
You could at least knock.

264
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,160
Mine matches yours?

265
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,790
This is great! It fits perfectly. Look.

266
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,860
But don't they all fit?

267
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,000
Let me see yours, Fuka.

268
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,590
- It doesn't fit at all.
- True, it's all loose.

269
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,590
Because mine matches our little sister.

270
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:52,260
Oh? It might be a little brother that pops out.

271
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:56,480
I want a little sister so we can reuse my clothes for her.

272
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,850
These are really well made.

273
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,300
I wonder what he's angry about.

274
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:46,360
[I would've liked to have been told if you were leaving before me.]

275
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,020
Go ahead.

276
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:56,770
[The contract is for us to act like the perfect couple, so we should do things together.]

277
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:06,870
Mori-san, you know you shouldn't have double-booked meetings.

278
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:09,000
My apologies.

279
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:13,110
The client has finished the dress fitting and gone home.

280
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,920
I see. Thank you.

281
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,770
Mori-san!

282
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:22,920
Thank you for taking my place, Haneda-san.

283
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,270
- Not at all.
- That was a big help!

284
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:28,790
It's just your first year here, yet you're so reliable.

285
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:33,570
Haneda-san! You have a visitor.

286
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:36,150
- Big sis!
- "Big sis"?

287
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:37,930
Riku?

288
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:47,020
What's brought you here unexpectedly? Do you need something from me?

289
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:50,050
Not so much of a need, but I wanted to ask you something.

290
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:52,040
- Sure.
- What is it?

291
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,290
Your marriage is fake, isn't it?

292
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:56,870
Why you little...

293
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,340
What makes you think that?

294
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:02,600
Your videos are so perfectly timed. It seems so fake.

295
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,000
That's not true. We're just really in tune with each other.

296
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,520
You grated that wasabi so nicely for her.

297
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,350
- Of course, I would.
- Even though she hates wasabi.

298
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,750
What?

299
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,960
Also...

300
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,340
the decisive blow might be this.

301
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,750
[Ayaka]

302
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,600
[The contract is for us to act like the perfect couple, so we should do things together.]

303
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:30,200
What's this?

304
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,100
You were supposed to send that to Togo-san, weren't you?

305
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:37,330
Big Sis, you shot at the wrong target.

306
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:42,940
Why did you marry him?

307
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,270
For money, obviously.

308
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:50,180
It was my choice to marry him; you don't have to worry about me.

309
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:53,480
You say that, but what if your fake marriage is exposed?

310
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,530
It's not fake. It's a contract marriage.

311
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:57,950
What's the difference?

312
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:01,320
It's my sister who'll get all the hate for being a gold-digger or whatever.

313
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,510
So you're here because you want us to get divorced before word gets out?

314
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:08,130
No. I'd rather have...

315
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,400
money instead.

316
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,140
Riku!

317
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:17,030
Actually, I'm not that much of a jerk.

318
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:19,940
I just figured you could hire me as a parttime worker.

319
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,120
I'll help you guys film your videos.

320
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,840
What?

321
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,220
We don't need you. I can just pay you to keep your mouth shut, right?

322
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:30,390
Well, there's no point in that.

323
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,410
- Didn't you just say you wanted money?
- What's wrong with calling it a parttime job?

324
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:33,770
- Didn't you just say you wanted money?
- What's wrong with calling it a parttime job?

325
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:36,660
Your videos will be more interesting, I get to earn some money,

326
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,030
and it helps Ayaka out too.

327
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:41,410
Let's all work together!

328
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:59,420
Don't tell Mom or Dad, okay? They'll get all worried.

329
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,680
I know.

330
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,120
I know you got married to help the family out.

331
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,560
No, I didn't. It's "The Battler" we're talking about here.

332
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,500
It's only a one-year contract,

333
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:13,180
and I wanted to experience what it's like to be rich at least once in my life.

334
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:16,720
Liar. "A year"?

335
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,730
Yes.

336
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:21,900
So divorce was in the plan from the very beginning?

337
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,820
Well, yeah.

338
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:27,650
That's why we should earn a bunch while we can!

339
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:30,000
"A bunch"?

340
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,410
Big Sis, is it really okay to marry someone even though you don't love them?

341
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:37,210
Big Sis, is it really okay to marry someone even though you don't love them?

342
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:38,840
It's fine.

343
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:42,030
I wouldn't be able to live with him if I hated him.

344
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:43,400
Pardon?

345
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:48,370
It's all her fault.

346
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:51,470
Right. She was careless.

347
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:53,440
- But it worked out for the best, right?
- What?

348
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,020
Our contract marriage got exposed.

349
00:23:55,020 --> 00:24:00,530
That's true, but that boy might be a big help with his keen eye.

He'd never expose you guys.

Really? She works here? Do you want to switch wedding halls?

00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:26,720
I'll cook dinner tonight to thank you for yesterday.

527
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,660
What do you want to eat?

528
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:32,710
I'm fine with anything.

529
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,540
"Anything"?

530
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:37,620
That's the worst thing you could say.

531
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:42,820
Italian? Of course, it would be...

532
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:46,620
What? Are you going to cook for Togo?

533
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,790
Well... yes.

534
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:53,090
Can you really cook? He's super picky!

535
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:56,560
Yes, I know that, but...

536
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,720
do you know what his favorite foods are?

537
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:05,060
Let's see... Maybe baccalà mantecato (creamed cod) and risotto alla Milanese?

538
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:09,450
E-Excuse me? Wh-What did you just say?

539
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:14,130
Good luck serving up your own twist on Italian cuisine!

540
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:16,360
What? W-Wait!

541
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,490
All right!

542
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,270
Oh! Stop!

543
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:07,350
Terrible...

544
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,660
One more time.

545
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,630
Sorry I'm late.

546
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:56,430
[Bond Charm]

547
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:59,360
[Bond charms where matching pairs are completely unique.]

548
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:45,280
♫ Although we are the worst couple ♫

549
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:48,010
Mamma mia!

♫ I will protect only you from now on, by all means ♫

551
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,170
You're home?

552
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:58,370
Yes, it's been a little while.

553
00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:02,570
♫ I'll dedicate my love to you ♫

554
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:06,160
What?

555
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:11,210
Nothing. Sorry for being late.

556
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:14,910
♫ Since I clumsily pretend to be tough ♫

557
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,190
What do you want?

558
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:19,620
You like Italian food, right?

559
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,900
Napolitan is Japanese-Italian food.
(T/N: ketchup spaghetti with meat and vegetables)

560
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,650
What? Really?

561
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:28,620
- I made some minestrone too.
- I already tried it.

562
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:31,490
- You have no knack for cooking whatsoever.
- That's so mean!

563
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:33,740
How many times did you fail to make this one dish?

564
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,710
You... saw?

565
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:38,120
What a waste of ingredients.

566
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:42,440
Well, I'll just bring the leftovers for lunch.

567
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,390
We'll manage if we repurpose the dishes,

568
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:49,290
like turning them into omelets or baked dishes.

569
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:51,560
Then I'll leave that to you!

570
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:54,950
I'll take care of all the cooking from now on. It's more economical that way.

571
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:58,020
I can also cook, as long as it's Japanese food.

572
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,400
Better than me?

573
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:05,420
You take care of taking out the trash and cleaning.

574
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,020
That's all I have to do?

575
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,830
And one more thing...

576
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:11,450
I want you to take care of Negi.

577
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:16,510
♫ I will protect only you from now on, by all means ♫

578
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:20,540
♫ I vow, in sickness and in health ♫

579
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,990
Why are you grinning like an idiot?

580
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:25,750
Well, you actually called her "Negi" for the first time.

581
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:28,050
Because you keep nagging me about it!

582
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:31,430
- That dog's name is Negi, right?
- Right.

583
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:34,650
Negi! Good for you!

584
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:39,040
I'm so happy for you, my little Negi.

585
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,010
I had a few drinks with Kamiyama-san today.

586
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:43,870
Oh, did you?

587
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:47,100
Yes.

588
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:49,800
Sorry for inviting you out.

589
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:53,650
Not at all. I wanted to have a long chat with you, too.

590
00:43:54,730 --> 00:43:57,880
I heard that you and your wife married not long after meeting.

591
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,350
True.

592
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:03,850
I don't blame you. She's very attractive.

593
00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:17,840
Has she always been that way?

594
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,530
"That way"?

595
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:27,070
Yes, I suppose so.

596
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:29,900
She's always been that attractive and charming.

597
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,130
I see you two must've been very close.

598
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,350
- Does it bother you?
- No, not at all.

599
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:40,430
It must be scary...

600
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,640
having her remember the past.

601
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:47,880
I'm sure you already know...

602
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:51,980
but I was her first love.

603
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:54,820
And she was mine.

604
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:05,220
What did you two talk about?

605
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:06,750
Nothing important.

606
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:09,570
It seems you have close friends yourself.

607
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:13,550
Only some people know just how wonderful I am.

608
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:15,570
Yeah, sure.

609
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:19,520
Kamiyama-kun is a good person, right?

610
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:26,650
He is.
♫ I swear my love to you ♫

611
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:30,940
Oh, before I forget!

612
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:34,330
I made dessert too!

613
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:37,540
Here it is! Ta-da!

614
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:39,520
What am I being punished for?

615
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:42,120
It's tiramisu by the scoop!

616
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:44,090
I've never heard of such a thing!

617
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:47,090
♫ Let's swear to eternity together ♫

618
00:45:47,090 --> 00:45:50,700
♫ And live in the blissful here and now ♫

619
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:53,390
My sister's first love.

620
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:56,080
It looks so delicious! Here you go!

621
00:45:56,080 --> 00:46:03,300
His appearance... marks the start of tribulation... for the both of them.

622
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:07,750
[Preview]
She's someone I once fell in love with. There's no way I'll dislike her.

623
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:09,730
They call it "the thread of fate."

624
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:11,570
- Are you jealous?
- Impossible.

625
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:12,990
What are you actually thinking?

626
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:15,600
I only have your happiness at heart.

627
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,890
I don't have a real family.

628
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:20,090
It's okay. I'm here for you.
