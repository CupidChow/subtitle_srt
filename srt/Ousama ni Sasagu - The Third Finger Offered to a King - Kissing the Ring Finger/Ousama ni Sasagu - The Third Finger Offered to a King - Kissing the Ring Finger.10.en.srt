I don't know what you're conspiring,

177
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:43,010
but please don't involve yourself with the Nittas any longer.

178
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:48,350
I cannot become your mother, not anymore.

179
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,650
[Nitta]

180
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,280
How are preparations for the wedding?

181
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,460
Yes, they're proceeding as planned.

182
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:08,460
The contract on the other end also seems to be going smoothly.

183
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,750
I'm looking forward to it.

184
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,910
Mirei-san is a nice lady.

185
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,350
She is.

186
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:25,130
Togo.

187
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:27,970
Do you have a moment?

188
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:33,490
Are you really okay with this?

189
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:34,840
Yes.

190
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:40,480
As the heir, I must make a decision that's best for the family,

191
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,730
just like you did, too.

192
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:51,590
I really loved your birth mother.

193
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:56,390
But I wasn't allowed to marry her.

194
00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:02,260
It's the same thing for Shizuka. She wasn't allowed to marry Arata-kun's father.

195
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:08,020
Therefore, all of us ended up being unhappy.

196
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,190
I'm sorry.

197
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,600
You don't have to apologize.

198
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,700
I shouldn't have had any dreams in the first place.

199
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,830
I should have married someone for the family's sake.

200
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,590
Have a seat.

201
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,850
Sorry you had to come at this hour.

202
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:54,370
Don't be. I also wanted to have a good chat with you.

203
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:02,360
This is the first time we're talking about stuff outside of work, right?

204
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,240
I'm sorry I didn't get to properly greet you until now.

205
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,700
No, don't be.

206
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,740
Has your father spoken to you about it?

207
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,610
Yes, he did.

208
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:20,790
He wanted the two of us to help save my mom.

209
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:25,180
Actually, my late dad, too,

210
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,480
told me to save my mom.

211
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:35,630
But my mom refuses to acknowledge me as her son,

212
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,880
so I don't know what to do.

213
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:47,550
For taking away the time you could have spent with your mom,

214
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:51,280
I deeply apologize.

215
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:54,490
It's not your fault, Nitta-san.

216
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:58,650
But to be honest,

217
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:02,710
I admit that I was envious of you.

218
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:08,520
She had showered you wholeheartedly with her love and cared for you.

219
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:14,050
But in reality,

220
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:21,340
she has hurt you, whom she's supposed to love, and Haneda-san...

221
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,470
Nitta-san,

222
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:32,570
could you please help me?

223
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,790
I'm home.

224
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,980
Oh, Ayaka-san.

225
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:35,360
It's been a long time.

226
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,050
It's been a while. How have you been?

227
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:41,830
I'm fine. Thank you for your concern.

228
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:48,090
This is Mirei-san, Togo's fiancée.

229
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:51,220
Nice to meet you. I'm Kuriyama Mirei.

230
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:56,060
I believe you're already aware that they will be holding their wedding next month.

231
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:59,490
I believe you're already aware that they will be holding their wedding next month.

232
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:03,330
I see.

233
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:05,600
Congratulations.

234
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:10,030
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

235
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,590
Well then, let's go, shall we?

236
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,010
Sure.

237
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,490
Thank you very much.

238
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,490
Please take care.

239
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,300
Are you okay?

240
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,440
Sure. Totally.

241
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:40,090
Oh, no wonder you had me shop for these.

242
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:41,670
Forgive me.

243
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:44,880
Sorry for making you all worry.

244
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,400
I'll go put these down.

245
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,410
Did something happen?

246
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:07,010
I bumped into Togo.

247
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,530
What's more, his beautiful fiancée was with him.

248
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,520
But more importantly,

249
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,910
he refused to look at me and acted unfriendly.

250
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:24,390
That just irks me.

251
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,950
When we broke up,

252
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:31,710
he told me he doesn't need a wife or family.

253
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:33,930
Yet he's now getting married.

254
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,980
He's a liar.

255
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,610
He just obeyed his parents' instructions.

256
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:53,340
It's been only ten months since we broke up.

257
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:57,910
Why has he changed so much?

258
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:04,840
You still...

259
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:08,140
love Nitta-san, right?

260
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,550
What?

261
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:16,650
Around the time you two divorced,

262
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:21,320
Nitta-san called me out, and we had a chat.

263
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:25,750
Wait a minute. What do you mean?

264
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:30,130
He asked me for a favor:

265
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:35,860
to stay by your side and be your pillar of support.

266
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:43,990
I've really enjoyed the time I've spent with you.

267
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:53,280
But the one who should be with you isn't me, after all.

268
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:00,280
Nitta-san...

269
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:03,570
still has feelings for you.

270
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:07,080
That's what I think.

271
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,470
Hey, let's take a photo together.

272
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,030
What is it?

273
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,400
I'm just imprinting this moment in my eyes.

274
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,610
Just delete it already. It's gross!

275
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:53,380
Hey, stop it!

276
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,960
- Give it back to me!
- I don't want to.

277
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,850
- Come on, Riku!
- No way.

278
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,240
Give it back already!

279
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,690
How long will you drag this on?

280
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:02,010
You're so noisy!

281
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:04,330
What time do you think it is?

282
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:07,410
Dad, you're the noisiest.

283
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,590
You've woken them up.

284
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:13,890
Everyone is worried about you.

285
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,170
I'm sorry.

286
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:22,960
Tell us how you really feel.

287
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,070
I still...

288
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,240
love Togo.

289
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,020
I can't forget him.

290
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:42,480
I figured... something must have happened back then.

291
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:49,220
But I bumped into Togo the other day.

292
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,340
He didn't look happy at all.

293
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,970
If I hadn't broken up with him back thenー

294
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:01,080
Ayaka, you're wrong.

295
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,280
It's great that you've divorced him.

296
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,140
What?

297
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:09,570
That was what Togo-san wanted.

298
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:13,060
To tell you the truth,

299
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:17,800
Togo-san and I had a chat before your divorce.

300
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,560
The harassment against your shop

301
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:25,120
and your debt problem this time...

302
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,720
Everything

303
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,030
is related to my mother.

304
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,570
What?

305
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:38,510
That woman won't allow me to have someone I care about.

306
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,420
That's why... she intends to ruin that plan.

307
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:45,000
That's why... she intends to ruin that plan.

308
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:50,820
I will...

309
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,960
break up with Ayaka-san.

310
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,940
- Wait, butー
- That woman...

311
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:02,090
may hurt Ayaka.

312
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,530
And that scares me...

313
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,190
more than anything else.

314
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:15,960
Togo-san broke up with you to protect you.

315
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:19,770
What's all this? Why didn't you tell me earlier?

316
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:23,240
Your dad has your interests at heart.

317
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,840
So what if it's for my sake?

318
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:30,020
I wanted to be with Togo.

319
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,700
Even so, why did youー

320
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,830
I wanted to protect you, too!

321
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,620
I wanted to protect my family!

322
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:40,510
Togo is also family to me!

323
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,550
We were husband and wife.

324
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:52,930
Mom...

325
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:58,680
Mom, if you were in my shoes,

326
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,180
you'd do the same thing, right?

327
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:06,170
As long as you're with the one you love, you'd overcome anything together, right?

328
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:07,600
- It's now too late to say all thisー
- I would.

329
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,280
- It's now too late to say all thisー
- I would.

330
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,820
What?

331
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:16,330
Mom would also do the same thing.

332
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,570
Dad...

333
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:24,640
just let Ayaka do what she wants.

334
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,860
I don't know if Togo...

335
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:40,900
still loves me,

336
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:46,160
but I won't give up.

337
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:59,120
As expected of my daughter!

338
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,210
Go for it and break it down!

339
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,250
Okay.

340
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,240
Sister, go for it!

341
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,880
- Go for it!
- Good luck!

342
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,750
Fight, fight!

343
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,750
You're all still awake?

344
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:14,140
- Good luck!
- You can do it, Sister.

345
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,490
Go for it!

346
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,660
It's been so long since we came here!

347
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:28,930
Come on, Togo. Over here!

348
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:30,640
Hi, Togo.

349
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,140
I've been waiting for you.

350
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,510
Why?

351
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,260
It'll be fun. Right?

352
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,310
Right?

353
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,730
Oh, I'll leave this here, okay?

354
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:42,430
Is everything okay with the barbecue preparations?

355
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,410
Yes, kind of.

356
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:48,000
- All right then, we'll leave the rest to you.
- Okay.

357
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,450
- What?
- See you!

358
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,440
Hachi-san, Sayo-san, thank you!

359
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,830
- Wait!
- Now, now...

360
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:59,040
Hachi! Sayo! Stop messing around!

361
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,060
They won't be coming back.

362
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,710
Excuse me?

363
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:11,030
For today, it'll just be the two of us.

364
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:26,160
Oh, it looks good.

365
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:45,440
Magical! Magical, magical, magical (in Italian)!

366
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,550
It's Italian food for today. Your favorite!

367
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,120
Togo, come and help me!

368
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:05,260
Togo, you'll be in charge of skewering the meat and veggies!

369
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:07,870
I've cut the veggies already.

370
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:10,140
Red peppers...

371
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:23,280
Is the ajillo ready soon?
(T/N: a dish fried in garlic oil)

372
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,880
That hurts!

373
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:31,230
Are you okay? Where's the burn?

374
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,640
I'm okay.

375
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,380
Let's cool it down.

376
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,280
I'll do the cooking.

377
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,410
I don't like food that tastes horrible.

378
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:04,240
Good, good (in Italian)!

379
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,050
I love you.

380
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:16,660
- What?
- You.

381
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,320
- How's the pizza?
- I love it.

382
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,190
I'm talking about the food.

383
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:24,080
I love everything.

384
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:25,990
What are you trying to do?

385
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:27,800
I love you so much.

386
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,950
I'm getting married next month.

387
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:34,450
- It doesn't matter.
- What?

388
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,410
None of it matters.

389
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:43,640
As long as you and I love each other, nothing matters.

390
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,880
Do you know what you're talking about?

391
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,770
I know very well.

392
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,990
My dad told me everything.

393
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:00,980
That you broke up with me to protect me.

394
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:05,930
Then all is well, isn't it?

395
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,410
Idiot!

396
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:10,840
- What?
- You're the king of idiots.

397
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,460
Excuse me?

398
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:21,810
I told you we'd be a family, didn't I?

399
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:28,480
So I'll be fine no matter what your mom does to me.

400
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,220
I'll protect you, Togo,

401
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,190
because we're a family.

402
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:42,230
That person...

403
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:45,950
won't let me go.

404
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,750
That's why I'm scared.

405
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:53,210
If anything does happen to you...

406
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:55,360
Then let her come at me.

407
00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:00,630
I'm even more miserable without you in my life,

408
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:07,310
miserable enough to feel like I'm dying.

409
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:12,100
Isn't it the same...

410
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,730
for you?

411
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,240
Are you okay with that?

412
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,910
Of course not.

413
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:28,690
Since I can't be with you,

414
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:34,930
I don't care whom I marry.

415
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:40,500
As long as I have the memories of our time together,

416
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,200
I felt I could survive even if my heart were dead.

417
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:52,900
♫ I was crying ♫

418
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:57,380
♫ And recalled your face in order not to lose it ♫

419
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,410
Togo...

420
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:01,760
♫ Before it turns into a mental bruise ♫

421
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,890
don't ever leave me again.

422
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:06,140
♫ I want to hug you tightly ♫

423
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,180
I can't live...

424
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,610
♫ Forever and ever ♫

425
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:12,470
without you.

426
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:19,240
Yes...

427
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:24,440
♫ Something like forgetting ♫

428
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,430
it's impossible.

429
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:30,740
♫ Is also important ♫

430
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:37,690
♫ Your spoken lines that don't suit you at all ♫

431
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:45,190
I won't leave you ever again.

432
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:47,900
♫ Nobody gets to see them ♫

433
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,620
♫ I couldn't breathe ♫

434
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:53,250
I won't let you go, no matter what.

435
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:59,820
♫ I just kept looking into these eyes ♫

436
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:08,750
♫ The reason for the falling tears ♫

437
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:13,520
Hey, Ayaka.

438
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,650
I love you, too.

439
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:19,850
♫ I want to protect all of this ♫

440
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:26,270
♫ The glittering bright heart tumbles through the air ♫

441
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:31,420
♫ The flickering, floating heart becomes the wind ♫

442
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:39,170
♫ I was crying ♫

443
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:44,220
♫ And recalled your face in order not to lose it ♫

444
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:50,000
♫ Before it turns into a mental bruise ♫

445
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,980
♫ I want to hug you tightly ♫

446
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,590
♫ I want to keep touching you ♫

447
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,750
♫ Forever and ever ♫

448
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,780
You're awful at that. Hand it over.

449
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:03,770
Wipe it like this, properly and gently.

450
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:06,860
- You're too particular.
- What?

451
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,930
Please go ahead. I'll leave it to you.

452
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:15,090
By the way, you called me the king of idiots yesterday, right?

453
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:17,430
Did I say that?

454
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:19,220
It doesn't sound bad at all.

455
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,240
King of idiots, king of idiots, king of idiots!

456
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,550
Don't go too far!

457
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,360
Togo... we'll always be together.

458
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,550
Togo... we'll always be together.

459
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,080
I want that, too.

460
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:45,140
But... at this rate, the same thing may happen again.

461
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,130
You mean your mom?

462
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:53,890
What that woman did was unforgivable.

463
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:57,870
But... no matter what she did,

464
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:01,270
she is still my mother.

465
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:03,700
True.

466
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:09,010
Your family is also my family.

467
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:13,980
So let's go see your mom together.
[Nitta]

468
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,540
Oh, Togo.

469
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:36,020
It's been a while.

470
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:40,230
Why are you here?

471
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:42,940
There's something we'd like to tell you.

472
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:48,340
I have called off the wedding.

473
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:50,660
What are you talking about?

474
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:53,570
I have spoken to the bride's family.

475
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:59,530
Both our companies have properly settled the contract.

476
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:01,490
- Do you know what you have done?
- I do.

477
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:03,000
- Do you know what you have done?
- I do.

478
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,650
I've decided...

479
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:09,670
I will walk the path that I want.

480
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,360
Together with Ayaka.

481
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,070
Are you abandoning me?

482
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:28,450
Please don't be mistaken.

483
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:33,890
Togo-san has always regarded you as his mother.

484
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:39,910
That's why he divorced me and planned to remarry.

485
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:41,540
There were many times

486
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:45,300
when I wanted to run away from you.

487
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:49,930
But I couldn't bring myself to abandon you.

488
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,730
Even if we're not related by blood,

489
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:57,360
I'm grateful that you've raised me with love and care.

490
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:02,270
No matter how much I wanted to hate you, I couldn't.

491
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:07,550
I threw away everything to marry into this family.

492
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:11,340
That's why I've never cared about anything but you.

493
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:17,280
Togo, you are everything to me.

494
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:27,480
Mother.

495
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,190
Why are you here?

496
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:34,230
Because he is family.

497
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:37,520
I'm sorry, Shizuka.

498
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,910
I should have done this earlier.

499
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:43,980
You have another son.

500
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:46,910
I hope you can regain the time you could've spent with Arata-kun,

501
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:50,790
the time you could've spent as mother and child.

502
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:58,390
- Come back, Togo.
- I won't let him go.

503
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:00,860
Come back here!

504
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,570
I can't.

505
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:13,060
Don't leave me all by myself. Stay by my side!

506
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:15,620
Don't leave me all by myself. Stay by my side!

507
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,560
I have never

508
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:29,160
intended to take Togo-san away from you.

509
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,220
We...

510
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:37,530
won't let you be alone.

511
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:41,470
Neither do we intend to leave you.

512
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,220
You are not alone.

513
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:53,150
You have Arata-san and me.

514
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,520
Both of us...

515
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:03,420
are your sons.

516
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:06,470
Mother.

517
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:02,630
I'm happy...

518
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,110
that you gave birth to me.

519
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,550
Thank you,

520
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,460
Mother.

521
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,810
You've grown so big.

522
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:46,530
I've always wanted to meet you.

523
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:09,390
Negi, slow down! Watch out!

524
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,610
Have you wiped the feet?

525
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:31,590
What? Are they smelly?

526
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:34,510
You idiot. I mean Negi.

527
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:36,580
After a walk, we must wipe his feet.

528
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:40,020
I've wiped them already. Anyway, we can clean the floor if he dirties it.

529
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:42,160
I'm the one cleaning the floor, though.

530
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,610
You were the one who said you'd do the cooking and cleaning.

531
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:47,460
Then what do you actually do?

532
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:50,560
- I... cheer you on.
- What?

533
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,150
Go for it, go for it, Togo!

534
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:59,040
Go, go, Togo! Go, go, Togo! Woof!

535
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,690
What are you doing? You think that will make me happy?

536
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:06,730
Pardon? Then what do you want me to do?

537
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,070
Stay with me.

538
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:10,950
- Excuse me?
- What?

539
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,580
I want you to stay with me.

540
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:24,320
I... want us to be together always.

541
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,900
I said it, okay?

542
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,890
Yeah, sure.

543
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:36,660
What's with that casual reply?

544
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:39,240
- That was a proposal!
- What? It was?

545
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,580
What?

546
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:43,190
Did you even notice now? That was a proposal!

547
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,910
You're an idiot, aren't you?

548
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:47,040
- But there's no ring.
- I've put in a lot of effort, you know?

549
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,910
What a cheapskate. He's a cheapskate, isn't he?

Togo, thank you.

554
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:30,370
I, too, want us to be together always.

555

What "safe"? We have only one minute left!

560
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:54,510
You're totally an idiot. Imagine oversleeping on your wedding day.

561
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:56,790
That's why we should've gone to bed earlier last night.

562
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:59,430
Excuse me? You were the one who started kissing me first.

563
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:02,970
Oh? So you're using that against me now? Then I won't do that ever again.

564
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:04,870
- No way.
- Then apologize.

565
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:06,850
No way.

581
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:19,170

584

They're getting married for real, right?

585
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,380
They're probably already tired of all the contracts.

586
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:37,090
They're no longer a married couple bound only by a piece of paper.

587
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:40,450
Easy to break up and no divorce history.

588
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:44,040
Sounds good, right? I mean, you don't have to enter your partner's grave.

589
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,480
That's right.

All the more reason we should have dreams about marriage!

- Well, guys, let's get to work.
- Okay.

- You kids, go do your homework.

615
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:07,450
As for me, I borrowed materials from my sister

616
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:11,030
