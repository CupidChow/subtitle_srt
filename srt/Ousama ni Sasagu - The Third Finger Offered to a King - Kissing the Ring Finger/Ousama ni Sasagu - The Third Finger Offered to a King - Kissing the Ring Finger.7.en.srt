00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,180
And spread the word about La Blanche while you're at it.

363
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,840
Are you sure?

364
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,440
I trust you.

365
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:55,750
I trust you, so I'll be waiting.

[Togoshi High School Class No. 67 Reunion Ishii Sensei's Farewell]

367
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:13,460
Thank you for taking care of me in high school, Sensei.

368
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,280
My pleasure.

369
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,820
I'm so glad I got to see everyone today.

370
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:21,970
Sensei, Haneda-san is the King's wife now.

371
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:23,420
Is that so?

372
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:26,090
That explains why you look so happy.

373
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:28,580
Perhaps you're right.

374
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:31,500
Look at you, boasting about your happy romance!

375
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,570
You're actually really easy to talk to, Haneda-san.

376
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:37,150
We should've spoken to you more back in high school.

377
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:39,770
No better time than the present!

378
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:41,410
Indeed.

379
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:44,570
Hey, Kamiyama! Over here.

380
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:46,490
It has been a while, Sensei.

381
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:50,170
You're Kamiyama-kun from the Physics Club!

382
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:52,550
We actually work together right now.

383
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:54,080
Really?

384
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,020
- It must be fate!
- Indeed.

385
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:59,310
Sensei, your glass is empty.

386
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,050
Thank you.

387
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,130
- Here you go.
-Thank you.

388
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:05,560
Here's one for you too, Haneda-san.

389
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,660
Thanks.

390
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:09,550
Okay, let's have a toast.

391
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:12,990
Cheers!

392
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,740
Man, we talked so much.

393
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:26,130
Are you okay, Haneda-san?

394
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:28,110
It's okay; I'll take her home.

395
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,670
She's in your hands.

396
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:30,990
Later.

397
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:36,890
You drank too much.

398
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:38,930
Because people kept refilling my glass.

399
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:41,040
Looks like you had fun.

400
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:44,040
But I have to get home. Togo's waiting for me.

401
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:47,500
But I have to get home. Togo's waiting for me.

402
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,710
Sorry.

403
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:54,960
Can you get in?

404
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,410

[Are you okay? Reply when you get this. Where are you?]

409
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:57,680
Togo...

410
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:08,590
Sorry, I'm not him.

411
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,390
What's the meaning of this?

412
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:18,780
I guess we were both drunk, so...

413
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,300
What do you mean?

414
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:27,380
I think you know what I mean.

426
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:37,290
- He's on a business trip.
- What?

427
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:40,260
He got a message this morning. It seems to be a job from the head office.

428
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:43,960
I see.

429
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,850
He said we can release some pre-recorded videos for the time being.

430
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:48,600
Well... could you tell him to contact me?

Well... could you tell him to contact me?

432

About that... I can't get through to him, either.

What kind of business trip is this?

456
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,500
As expected from you, Hachi. You know me too well.

457
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,570
You always escape here whenever something happens.

458
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:45,590
It's a holiday home, so it needs to be aired out every now and then.

During work hours?

Hello, Ayaka-chan? If you're after Togo, he's—

465
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,360
I wasn't on the phone with her.

466

What happened?

00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:20,830
I've come all this way. I'm not leaving until you've talked to me.

469

I've come all this way. I'm not leaving until you've talked to me.

Manager! Wasn't yesterday's client just so wonderful?

472
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:45,050
You're not going home?

473
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,620
It's not like there's anyone to go home to.

474
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:51,050

Wow, I'm stuffed.

477
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:57,710
Just go home already.

00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:03,290
I should be asking you that!

00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:14,480
No way.

You're alone, right? Get somewhere safe right now.

It's okay. I'm with you. I'll be home right away.

What do I do, Togo?

486
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:25,950
Did something happen?

487
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:30,120
It's a cockroach! I have to go and save Sayo-chan right away!

488
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,610
Seriously? That's it? Give me a break!

489
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:34,110
"That's it"? Sayo-chan is terrified!

490
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,280
You're both grown adults.

491
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,940
I don't care what you think. Sayo-chan's important to me.

492

I don't care what you think. Sayo-chan's important to me.

Togo, please drive me.

495
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:58,390
It's completely my fault.

496
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:02,090
Then you should just apologize right away.

00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:04,440
I want to,

498
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,440
but he won't answer my calls and ignores my texts.

499
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:14,280
He's completely avoiding me and won't even give me a chance to apologize.

500
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,640
Oh? I'm sure it'll be fine. It's important to give him time to cool down.

501
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,480
Oh? I'm sure it'll be fine. It's important to give him time to cool down.

00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,330
Another order of short ribs, please!

503
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:23,670
Got it! Thank you very much.

504
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:28,370
It'll be okay.

505
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:32,620
He's always thinking about you.

506
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:37,920
Well, he's always asking me about you in a roundabout way every time I'm in his office.

507
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,590
He really cares for you.

508
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:46,490
Come on, eat!

509
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:50,100
He'll be back in no time.

510
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,240
Manager, I want to apologize to him right away.

511
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:58,240
Manager, I want to apologize to him right away.

512
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,500
I'm going to go see him. Forgive me.

513
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,290
I'm going to go see him. Forgive me.

514
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:09,260
Excuse me!

515
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:13,690
Can I get another three long skirt steaks and...

516
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:32,900
Then let's both get punished together.

517
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,940
I'll overwrite that kiss of his.

518
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:42,140
As expected from my wife.

519
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:44,670
I trust you.

520
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,680
Togo!

521
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,310
I'm sorry.

522
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,310
I...

523
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:21,890
I drank too much at the reunion party.

524
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:25,770
And I found myself at a hotel when I woke up.

525
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:31,240
Kamiyama-kun...

526
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:34,230
was there too.

527
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:40,390
But it's not what you think.

528
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:43,910
Drunk or not,

529
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:47,760
I definitely wouldn't do that.

530
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,400
I know I have no right to ask this of you, but I want you to believe me.

531
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,580
I know I have no right to ask this of you, but I want you to believe me.

532
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:00,980
I'm truly sorry.

533
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:11,330
I'm the one who is wrong here.

534
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,250
For doubting you even though I said I trusted you.

535
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:27,660
Even Hachi made fun of me.

536
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,400
That's not true.

537
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,280
So I won't doubt you anymore.

538
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,970
If you say that nothing happened,

539
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:39,210
then I believe you.

540
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:55,210
We're a married couple, right?

541
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,670
I finally got to overwrite it.

542
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:36,530
♫ Although we are the worst couple ♫

543
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:40,160
♫ Let's have the most beautiful love ♫

544
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:47,960
♫ I will protect only you from now on, by all means ♫

545
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:54,170
♫ I'll dedicate my love to you ♫

546
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:02,300
♫ A 100°C love cools me down ♫

547
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:06,030
♫ Since I clumsily pretend to be tough ♫

548
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:08,280
Yes.

549
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,550
I know not of that person!

550
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:18,680
♫ I rush to you as if by chance ♫

551
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:25,380
♫ Love is blind, everything's (everything's) your fault ♫

552
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:28,530
♫ A more dreamlike story than you can imagine ♫

553
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:29,330
Is it good?

554
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:31,600
♫ We are the strongest couple ♫

555
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:36,460
♫ The happy end is promised ♫

556
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,380
We have nothing to talk about. Please leave.

557
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:52,310
We have nothing to talk about. Please leave.

558
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,100
I'll talk to him.

559
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:03,030
Just leave him be.

560
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,390
I'll talk to him. You sit down.

561
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:15,310
But it's my problem.

562
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:17,420
It's our problem.

563
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,840
Kamiyama-san, I'll come down, so wait there.

564
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,600
Is this something we should talk about outside?

565
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:34,330
I believe it would be an issue for you.

566
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:38,210
I don't mind, though.

567
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,600
Sorry for dropping by in the morning.

568
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:48,540
I just had to come talk to you.

569
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:51,230
I don't think we have anything to talk about.

570
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:55,980
My wife says that nothing happened, and I believe her.

571
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,980
"Nothing"?

572
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:03,110
I remember everything, though.

573
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:09,040
Despite how drunk someone may be, they wouldn't sleep with someone if they didn't want to.

574
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:14,050
Haneda-san appeared to be enjoying herself.

575
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:17,900
Did you know...

576
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:22,660
that Haneda-san has a mole on her inner thigh?

577
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:25,820
that Haneda-san has a mole on her inner thigh?

578
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:29,540
Togo?

579
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:37,210
There's no way you can forget sleeping with someone.

580
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:39,080
Wait!

581
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,630
I think Kamiyama-kun is right.

582
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:47,800
If that really happened, I would definitely remember it.

583
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:51,780
He's definitely lying.

584
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:02,430
Kamiyama-kun, I know something is up.

585
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:04,880
That's why you're lying, right?

586
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:09,400
"Something"?

587
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:13,120
I'm not lying.

588
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:15,650
You were the one who suggested that we go to a hotel.

589
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:17,610
No.

590
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:20,240
I know for a fact that you didn't do anything.

591
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,810
I know for a fact that you didn't do anything.

592
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:25,660
Ayaka?

593
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:27,250
Because...

594
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:31,240
I trust you.

595
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,100
You trust him?

596
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,600
That's worse than sleeping together.

597
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:08,090
Togo?

598
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:10,580
Let go of me.

599
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:20,760
Please leave.

600
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,800
Sorry. But—

601
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,560
Please.

602
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:33,100
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

603
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:36,160
Chairman, Sakuraba-san of La Blanche's Hakone branch is waiting for you.

604
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,590
I see. Got it.

605
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:43,960
The word "trust"

606
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:47,860
was more important to Togo-san than anything else.

607
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:52,620
They had finally become a real married couple

608
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:55,640
and had found true love in each other,

609
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,150
yet my sister stepped on Togo-san's brewing land mind.

610
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:04,580
[Preview]
The name is Sakuraba Arata.

611
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:08,330
With my transfer to headquarters cemented, it's been decided I'll step down as president of La Blanche.

612
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:10,820
We want you to go build your own family.

613
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:13,320
But please spare the people around me.

614
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,730
You know nothing at all.

615
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,640
You're the only one for me, always.

616
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,100
Togo.
