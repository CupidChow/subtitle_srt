you were there for me, without fail.

373
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:10,920
By marrying Motoki, I'll be leaving Tokyo.

374
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,450
I'm sorry I'll be leaving you lonely.

375
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:22,030
But I promise I'll do my best to be filial to you, Grandpa.

376
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:31,680

Ayaka-san, thank you so much.

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,980
When I first heard your offer,

385
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:19,950
I thought holding our ceremony in a hospital would be impossible.

386
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:22,780
But after seeing it come together,

387
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:28,460

00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,700
- It's red.
- That's because it's all tomatoes.

00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:04,720
♫ Hey, together, one, two step ♫

535
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:08,050
Oh, wait! Wait!

536
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:11,120
What?

537
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:14,360
♫ Let's have the most beautiful love ♫

538
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:17,100
Fair point.

539
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:21,270
Excuse me? No, not that!

540
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:22,710
What's wrong?

541
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:25,980
We're going way too fast.

542
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:33,590
♫ I will protect only you from now on, by all means ♫

543
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:38,490
Still a brat, are you?

544
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,680
Good night.

545
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:51,070
♫ The day we met ♫

546
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:54,910
♫ Certainly, I arrogantly pretended to be tough ♫

547
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:58,070
Good morning.

548
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,720
What is it?

549
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,620
Get changed.

550
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,460
I'll teach you what a real sauna is all about.

551
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:08,300
- I never asked.
- Quiet.

552
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:10,120
You don't even know true revitalization.

553
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:14,100
I mean, I at least know the concept.

554
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:16,670
- Well, we're going to heaven.
- That's scary!

555
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:18,320
Okay, count me out.

556
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,820
Sit.

557
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:23,580
We'll have a sauna, an ice bath, and then a break.

558
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:24,820
We'll repeat this three times.

559
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:27,140
- That many?
- Exactly.

560
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:30,920
♫ I'm dedicated to you, dear my lover ♫

561
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:34,060
♫ We both met the love of our lives ♫

562
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:37,860
Saunas are awesome...

563
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,490
Told you so.

564
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:44,360
This is heaven!

565
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:47,250
♫ Even thousands of years from now ♫

566
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:50,690
♫ I'll still want us to be together ♫

567
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:56,370
♫ I won't let you go, no matter what ♫

568
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,190
There she is.

569
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:03,530
Kamiyama-san's calling for you.

570
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:05,750
Oh, okay.

571
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:14,590
Kamiyama-kun.

572
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:20,620
Hey, congrats on returning to the job.

573
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:25,680
Thanks. I'm excited to work with you again.

574
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:29,040
So what did you need?

575
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:34,140
I just wanted to see you.

576
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:36,600
Pardon?

577
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:42,050
Is that so wrong?

578
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:46,650
You seem a little strange today.

579
00:45:54,320 --> 00:46:00,200
♫ The whole world will be jealous ♫

580
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:04,720
♫ I swear my love to you ♫

581
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,910
I've always loved you.

582
00:46:08,270 --> 00:46:11,510
Ever since high school, you've been the only one.

583
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:16,760
[Preview]
She's definitely hiding something.

584
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,640
Does anything come to mind?

585
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:21,190
What about your time with me? We're a married couple, right?

586
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:23,180
What if I insisted on not giving up?

587
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:25,600
Kamiyama-kun, I also liked you.

588
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,410
Did something happen between you and your first love?

589
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:30,060
- Togo!
- I'll overwrite that kiss of his.
