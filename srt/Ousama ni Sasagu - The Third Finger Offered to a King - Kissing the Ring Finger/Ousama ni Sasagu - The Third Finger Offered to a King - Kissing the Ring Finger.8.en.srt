My name is Nitta Togo. It's an honor to be here.

Nitta Holdings currently faces a great challenge.

191
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:46,760
Service industries must be attuned to their changing customers.

Therefore, the amount of information available to customers has changed dramatically.

Marrying for love was beyond unforgivable.

Nevertheless, she fell in love with a man.

206

And the two had a child.

207
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:46,020
However, she could not abandon her family name.

Leaving her child to the father,

209
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,520
she determined to live solely for the Asagiri family.

She'll love that! You'd better keep your word.

Okay.

359
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,320
You should sit.

360

363
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:02,360
was I too harsh on her?

364
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:11,030
I'm terribly sorry I've deceived you, Sir.

365
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:19,590
I want to believe it wasn't all a lie.

366
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:23,590
Don't you feel anything for my daughter?

367
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,970
Nothing at all?

368
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:30,220

Ayaka...

372
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,280
is my one and only.

373
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,650

374

Togo-san will make it work.

375

Togo, I brought us a drink to celebrate.

376
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:39,010
Where is Ayaka-san? Still at work?

377
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:42,390
I bet you came because you knew she wasn't here.

378
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:44,390
Goodness, what makes you say that?

379
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:47,580
You are always good at telling lies.

380
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:50,270
A terrible assumption, indeed.

381
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:56,020
Nevertheless, I'm quite worried that she's out so late.

382
00:31:56,020 --> 00:32:00,220
There's no need. She's currently visiting family.

383
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:04,040

No, thank you.

386
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:18,120
Did you and Ayaka-san have a little argument?

387
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:22,840
You would know that better than anyone.

388
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:28,110
After all, you had Kamiyama-san approach Ayaka in the first place.

389

You're late.

533
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:59,830
Oh, Negi!

534
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:01,300
Hey.

535
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,120
What about me?

536
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:11,910
♫ You see? Here we go again; we are invulnerable ♫

537
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:15,550
♫ Impregnable, even when facing an enemy ♫

538
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:18,520
♫ We'll challenge them head-on ♫

539
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:21,160
- Oh?
- What?

540
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,580
Nothing.

541
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,460
♫ If I'm with you, it will never ever end ♫

542
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:31,320
- What?
- Yeah?

543
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,620
Expecting something else?

544
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:36,770
Excuse me? No.

545
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,760
Welcome home.

546
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:56,790
She could only assume their love was eternal.

547
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:59,970
[Preview]
I think I'm happier than I've ever been.

548
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:01,380
Thanks for marrying me.

549
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:02,680
We are very sorry.

550
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,230
No matter what you might do, we won't give in.

551
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:05,660
Are you sure about that?

552
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:08,280
Weren't you supposed to make my sister happy?

553
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,990
- I'm just tired of everything.
- You said you wanted us to be family.

554
00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:13,110
You're irritating me!
