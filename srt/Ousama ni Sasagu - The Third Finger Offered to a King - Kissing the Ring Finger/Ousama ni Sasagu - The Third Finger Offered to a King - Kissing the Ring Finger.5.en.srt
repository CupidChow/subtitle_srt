My first love was back in junior high.
[The Battler Japan]

00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,760
I went to a game center for the first time in my life, on my first date.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,590
What? Will I fall in love with her if we meet again after so long?

4
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:18,690
Well, I won't say it's impossible.

5
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,240
After all, she's someone I once fell in love with.

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,100
There's no way I'll dislike her.

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,110
Was it that bad?

8
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:29,280
They're not good at all. There's no novelty in there.

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,260
This one sounds good: The Reconciling Couple Support Plan.

This one sounds good: The Reconciling Couple Support Plan.

11
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,210
We'll give a five percent discount to all reconciling couples.

12
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,530
No. Impossible.

13
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,280
But I thought it was a good proposal.

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,930
There are two couples I know who've gotten back together.

15
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:44,110
Don't you get it? Reconciling is like

16
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,550
eating something you've earlier puked out.

17
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,760
What are you talking about?

18
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:53,990
In "The Battler," your first love joined the show, and you almost fell in love with her.

19
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,450
Only for one second, okay? As proof, I didn't choose anyone in that show.

20
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:02,760
Only for one second, okay? As proof, I didn't choose anyone in that show.

21
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,380
No, but there are people who are drawn to each other.

22
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,580
They call it "the thread of fate."

23
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,460
"The thread of fate"?

24
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,570
So, work hard at it.

25
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,760
What do you mean by that?

26
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:22,920
My sister's husband has been feeling edgy lately.

27
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,120
Thread of fate? Stop kidding me.

28
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,820
- Haneda-san.
- What is it?

29
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,380
- They'll adopt the plan...
- The cause was obviously my sister.

30
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,610
As expected of you.

31
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,020
No, it's all thanks to your help.

32
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,480
It was worth it.

33
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,450
- No.
- Pardon?

34
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,980
King's love...

[Kissing the Ring Finger: Episode 5]

37
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,130
A divorce?

38
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:05,020
Yes. We'd like to hold a divorce ceremony.

39
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:09,080
Does that mean you're celebrating... your divorce?

40
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,730
- That's right.
- Yes.

41
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,930
Certainly, there are benefits to being married,

42
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:17,080
such as financial stability.

43
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,740
But we have different values.

44
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,780
Like our parents' places.

45
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:26,190
Currently, one out of three couples gets divorced.

46
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:29,110
Wouldn't it be a good idea to have divorce ceremonies?

47
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:32,180
Nobody would want a divorce ceremony held in a wedding hall.

48
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,240
And I'm sure many in Nitta Holdings will object to it as well.

49
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,410
It also may look like we're resorting to divorce ceremonies because we're suffering losses.

50
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,950
I agree.

51
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,900
It may also be seen as inauspicious.

52
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,870
I also agree.

53
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:50,040
But we have to move with the times.

54
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,610
It can also help boost our revenue.

55
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,870
I think so, too.

56
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,430
We're in an era where people can marry their idols.

57
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:01,670
I also feel it's a good idea.

58
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:05,440
In fact, we've received several such requests before.

59
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,860
There is a demand for it.

60
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:13,730
A divorce ceremony is a way to draw a close on the past and move forward into the future.

61
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:18,780
Please allow us to accept this request.

Wow, I finally remembered.

You're bringing that up again? I've apologized countless times. You keep dwelling on it.

69
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:52,820
You two have lived as a married couple for five years.

70
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,840
I'm sure you don't have only bad memories, right?

71
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,300
A divorce ceremony is for starting over.

72
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,060
Let's do it in a celebratory manner.

73

It's strange, right? They're bitter toward each other, yet they feel lonely.

77

But I think I understand how they feel.

78

Like not wanting to go to the parents' place.

79
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:27,790
The Nitta family are nice people.

There you go, pushing yourself too much again.

81

Don't you find King's mom really scary?

82
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,440
Is that so? I thought she was very kind.

83
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,720
She actually accepted me for who I am.

84
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,370
That's true.

A gift that has no intention of making one happy is just trash, isn't it?

If trash is what you're buying, you may as well not waste the money.

Did we?

00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,680
We went to get materials for my experiment. Don't you remember?

- But Kamiyama-kun is my friendー
- Just don't.

355
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,730
Are you jealous?

356
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:11,070
You... Don't forget that we have 500,000 followers.

357
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:13,750
It'll be bad if you're accused of having an affair.

358
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,350
I won't go out with him anymore.

359
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:18,250
I'm sorry.

360
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:25,290
Next time, I'd like to go out with you.

361
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:34,240
I mean, we're running out of ideas for content, so...

362
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,650
Thank you.

363
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:51,410
Likewise. Thank you, as always.

364
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:54,040
Likewise. Thank you, as always.

365
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,850
Why are you here?

366
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:42,470
Ayaka-san approached me for help making a reservation here.

367
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:46,690
So I thought I'd come here to thank the restaurant owner.

368
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:53,110
Thank you for your help, Mother.

369
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:57,140
But... well...

370
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:00,690
I wanted to celebrate my son's birthday, too.

371
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,290
Allow me to just wish him "happy birthday."

372
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:09,380
Togo.

373
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:13,900
Thank you for coming into this world.

374
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,950
- Let's go home.
- What?

375
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:31,000
Let's just get out of here.

376
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:47,340
President!

377
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:50,300
Wait for me.

378
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,160
What's wrong?

379
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,880
Are you okay?

380
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:09,630
Have you finally calmed down?

381
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:18,130
What actually happened?

382
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:29,870
I'm your wife, after all.

383
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:31,990
Please tell me.

384
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,640
President?

385
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,610
My mom...

386
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,780
is not my birth mother.

387
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,090
I am...

388
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:06,800
the child of my dad's mistress.

389
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:18,580
My birth mother was hospitalized due to an illness,

390
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:22,880
and I was brought to the Nitta household when I was 10.

391
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:25,780
Let's go.

392
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:28,380
All my relatives

393
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:31,510
saw me as an illegitimate child and treated me coldly.

394
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:33,780
I felt ashamed.

395
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,280
But...

396
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:41,250
that woman always protected me.

397
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:45,170
Here you go. Dig in.

398
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:46,860
Thank you for the food.

399
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:50,420
She was like a real mother to me.

400
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,450
It's delicious.

401
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:54,880
It's delicious? Glad to hear that.

402
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,890
I really loved her.

403
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:05,600
Soon, I became estranged from my birth mother.

404
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:09,310
To me, back then,

405
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,510
that woman was my only ally.

406
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:16,660
That's why,

407
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:20,590
as the eldest son of the Nitta family,

408
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:23,620
I decided to work hard as the family business's future heir.

409
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:26,910
I did this for her, as well.

410
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,640
However,

411
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,830
the real her was...

412
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:38,720
Thank you...

413
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,180
for giving birth to Togo.

414
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:48,690
I wished...

415
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:52,850
you could have died sooner.

416
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:08,800
I'll make omelet rice for you when we get home.

417
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:13,100
She was hurting people

418
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:18,530
in a cruel and unconcerned manner.

419
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:25,530
I didn't know that at all.

420
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:27,490
I'm so sorry.

421
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,930
It's not your fault.

422
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,720
I...

423
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:52,000
don't have a real family.

424
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:02,360
♫ I was crying ♫

425
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:08,310
♫ and recalled your face in order not to lose it ♫

426
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,820
It's okay.

427
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,890
I'm here for you.

428
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:19,040
♫ I want to keep touching you ♫

429
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:22,460
♫ Forever and ever ♫

430
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:39,470
♫ Something like forgetting is also important ♫

431
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:47,570
♫ Your spoken lines that don't suit you at all ♫

432
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:54,870
♫ The colorful thoughts overflow ♫

433
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:57,950
♫ Nobody gets to see them ♫

434
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:59,420
Chin!

435
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,250
Perfect.

436
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:05,700
Chin! Chin!

437
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:18,970
Okay, come hold this for me.

438
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:20,880
All right. Negi, Negi.

439
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,650
There you go. Sit, Negi, sit.

440
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:28,620
And now you will do sit-ups.

441
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,710
- Here goes.
- Okay.

442
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,370
Up.

443
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:38,640
Up.

444
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:44,780
- Up.
- Togo, say, "Ah."

445
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,740
You're not letting me eat it?

446
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:49,800
It's delicious!

447
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:53,020
Jeez... Wait, there's sauce on your lips.

448
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:59,570
♫ Before it turns into a mental bruise ♫

449
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:02,090
♫ I want to hug you tightly ♫

450
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:02,880
Cut!

451
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,450
♫ I want to keep touching you ♫

452
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:07,200
♫ Always, always ♫

453
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,000
I'm kind of getting good vibes from them today.

454
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,490
You think so, too?

455
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:12,860
Yes.

456
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:16,090
♫ Surely, I'll be able to say this ♫

457
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:19,640
♫ Surely ♫

458
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:24,220
Those guys are really messy eaters.

459
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:29,170
But they helped us a lot with filming for the online content.

460
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:33,810
President, these too, please.

461
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,220
Say...

462
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:49,890
I-I'll wipe the dishes.

463
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,780
Thanks.

464
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:57,950
Sorry.

465
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,120
My bad.

466
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:34,020
Shall we...

467
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:36,890
turn in for the day?

468
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:40,220
Yes, sure.

469
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:51,390
- Good night.
- Good night.

470
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:53,000
- Good night.
- Good night.

471
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:03,470
Hey.

472
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:04,820
Yes?

473
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:08,420
Well...

474
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:16,290
Stop calling me "President."

475
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,610
Dear heavens...

476
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,010
Togo-san?

477
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,350
Nitta-kun?

478
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,260
Togo?

479
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:59,060
Haneda-san, Takemoto-kun, he...

480
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:01,280
J-Just come with me!

481
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:05,040
The wedding gifts... The wedding gifts!

482
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,590
Where did they go?

483
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:09,110
I-I'm not sure, either.

484
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:10,710
May I know what's going on?

485
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:14,270
I left the wedding gifts to this person when I went to the washroom.

486
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:20,250
But our company leaves the responsibility of the wedding gifts to the client.

487
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:24,920
I'm so sorry! I was entrusted to look after the wedding gifts.

488
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:30,360
I waited a while, thinking she'd return soon, but...

489
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:33,290
- Can I leave this to you? I need the washroom. Sorry!
- No, wait!

490
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:35,210
Wait a minute! What?

491
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:39,780
I'm sorry, but could you wait for a short while?

492
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:43,020
- Excuse me?
- Another coordinator came along...

493
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:46,750
I've been asked to look after this while the coordinator goes to the washroom.

494
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:49,600
I'm also a coordinator, so please leave this to me.

495
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,100
No, it'll be a problem if anything goes wrong.

496
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:55,080
In that case, I'll call the coordinator.

497
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:00,280
You need more time in the washroom?

498
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,730
Then I'll take over, okay?

499
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:07,290
Therefore, I let that coordinator take over.

500
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:09,860
Did you receive any calls from that coordinator?

501
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:11,780
There's no such person.

502
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:14,700
In fact, I didn't receive any calls at all!

503
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:18,620
It's all because of this guy! Why didn't you confirm it properly?

504
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:23,460
I will contact the police. We will also help look for it.

505
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:26,870
- What are you going to do about the money?
- Hey, you!

506
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:28,150
You'd better take responsibility for this!

507
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:30,820
- Yes, you should!
- I'm sorry.

508
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:33,870
- I am so sorry!
- Don't think you can get away with just an apology!

509
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:36,090
Get me the person in charge!

510
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:39,360
I am the person in charge.

511
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,950
I deeply apologize.

512
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:43,150
How are you going to take responsibility for this?

513
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:44,750
What will you do about the money?

514
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:48,620
- We will look for it. We are so sorry.
- I'm very sorry!

515
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:00,950
You'll give us away!

516
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:02,280
Don't struggle.

517
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:06,260
In you go. You'll give the game away, so behave.

518
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,350
Welcome back.

519
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,900
I'm home.

520
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,980
Wait, I thought you were on a business trip today.

521
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:23,220
I came back on an earlier flight.

522
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,630
Wow!

523
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:40,380
Is there a special occasion today? Do we have a shoot?

524
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:43,580
I'm just expressing my infinite gratitude.

525
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,880
What's wrong all of a sudden?

526
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,610
There's no reason for it.

527
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:49,250
Can't I do that?

528
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:51,830
Well, of course, you can.

529
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:56,350
Please sit over here.

530
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:57,870
Thank you.

531
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,090
Shall we drink over there?

532
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,360
Say...

533
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,850
I've been wanting to tell you this.

534
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:11,910
Well...

535
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:14,190
Me, too.

536
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:16,030
There is something I want to tell you, President.

537
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:18,080
Like I said... don't call me "President."

538
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,410
Like I said... don't call me "President."

539
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:26,520
Togo.

540
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,960
What is it?

541
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:39,000
I'd like to submit my resignation.

542
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,840
What? You're resigning?

543
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,710
That's right. I'm resigning.

544
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,270
Why?

545
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:48,840
I will bear the responsibility.

546
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:53,010
Didn't Hachi-san inform you about what happened today?

547
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:57,070
He did.

548
00:41:57,070 --> 00:42:01,210
However... that was obviously Takemoto's mistake.

549
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:03,980
But if I were in the same situation,

550
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:07,170
I'd probably do what he did.

551
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:09,070
Based on security camera footage,

552
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:11,580
Takemoto-kun didn't do anything wrong. It's not his fault.

553
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,670
Even so,

554
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:18,200
Takemoto was the one manning it. He's responsible.

555
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:21,820
Then I, as his manager, am also responsible.

556
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:24,310
You're only a substitute.

557
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:30,620
Even if I'm a substitute, I am the manager.

558
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:36,210
I'm the one overseeing Takemoto-kun. I should take responsibility for this.

559
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:38,390
He still has living expenses to pay for.

560
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:41,740
- If he resigns, he can't pay his rentー
- He can just look for a new job.

561
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:45,350
- It's not as easy as you thinkー
- He can find a job in no time if he's capable enough.

562
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:47,040
No, he can't.

563
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,020
Everyone is desperately trying to make a living.

564
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:56,120
You may not be able to understand since money issues never trouble you.

565
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:09,540
I may not understand,

566
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:11,150
but...

567
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,850
what about your feelings?

568
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:20,870
Don't you find satisfaction in your work?

569
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:24,590
I feel that... this job suits you really well.

570
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:27,570
I feel that... this job suits you really well.

571
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:40,470
I've always wanted to try being a full-time housewife for once.

572
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:43,620
I've always wanted to try being a full-time housewife for once.

573
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:47,550
I'll do my best with house upkeep.

574
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:49,440
I'm now the president's wife,

575
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,440
- so, as president's wives do, I should supportー
- Even if you're the president's wife,

576
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,230
if I don't give you any money, you'll be just like Takemoto.

577
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:05,650
We are not a real married couple.

578
00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:12,540
This is only a one-year contract.

579
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:17,870

I'm sorry.

583
00:44:30,810 --> 00:44:34,500
Hey.

584
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:42,390
My sis and brother-in-law are starting to have feelings for each other.

585
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,230
However... because of a trivial matter, their relationship is crumbling just like that.

586
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:51,710

[Preview]
- What's Ayaka-chan doing now that she quit?
- Who knows.

605
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:18,510
Why did things turn out like this?

606
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:20,990
She doesn't come to me for anything.

607
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:24,580
Like a "fake marriage where both sides become serious" story.

608
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:27,670
Ayaka, let's call off our contract.
