1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:05,990
I think that marriage is a miracle.

2
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:08,790
Among so many people in this world,

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,890
you meet the perfect person, fall in love,

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:15,110
and promise to spend the rest of your life with that one person.

5
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:18,380
It's true happiness, don't you think?

6
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,780
Money can't buy you miracles.

7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:27,260
Yet that miracle has become a reality for the two of you.

8
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:32,010
That's why I'd like to organize a special wedding ceremony for

9
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:36,280
the two of you who have been brought together by such an intense bond.

10
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,350
This is a place where your dreams can come true.

11
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,700
What do you think?

12
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,120
- Show me the contract and I—
- Don't sign it!

13
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,430
She'll steal your boyfriend if you sign a contract with her.

14
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,940
Dear customer, please—

15
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,850
It's all your fault!

16
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:58,130
What's the matter, Watanabe-san?

17
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:01,150
My engagement's been called off.

18
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:04,940
- What?
- I thought it was weird that you wanted me to sign right away.

19
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,210
I heard you invited him to a hotel!

20
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,200
What happened?

21
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,590
That's one of Haneda-san's clients.

22
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:20,490
- It's not what you think.
- Don't act dumb.

23
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,510
You conned him so he'd sign a contract with you, right?

24
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,600
- No!
- When I pressed him further,

25
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,280
he said he couldn't marry me because he's in love with you!

26
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,400
It's all your fault!

27
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:44,070
How is it my fault? He's the one who fell in love with me.

28
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,230
There's no point in blaming me like that.

29
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,880
How dare you talk to me like that!

30
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,520
It's a fact.

31
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,940
Even if you're a bit cuter than others, what's with this?

32
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,610
Sorry for being a bit cu—

33
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:55,740
Oh, that's hot!

34
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,670
- Ma'am, please.
- Let go of me!

35
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,770
- Ma'am.
- Don't get ahead of yourself!

36
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,160
- Ma'am!
- Let's go now.

37
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,620
I won't ever forgive you!

38
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,350
You could've at least chosen water to splash on me.

[President's Office]

40
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,720
- Haneda-san.
- Yes?

41
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,010
Did I say something funny?

42
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,310
No.

43
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:38,480
I took a look at your resume.

44
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,430
You've done a lot of job-hopping, I see.

45
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:43,630
- Due to personal reasons—
- Due to issues with men, correct?

46
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,160
- What?
- Haneda Ayaka, 26 years old.

47
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,210
In April of 2018, you were a sales assistant at Kazu Mart, a convenience store, before losing

48
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:53,020
your job when the owner's wife discovered the owner had been giving you money.

49
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,900
- That's not... true.
- September 2019:

50
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:00,780
You worked at Rama, an izakaya (pub), before losing your job upon relationship issues with a regular customer.

51
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,910
- As I was saying—
- February 2021:

52
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:08,160
You were a receptionist at an employment agency before losing your job upon dating two male staff members at once.

53
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,100
You were nicknamed...

54
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,000
"wicked woman."

55
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,420
Hello, I'm the wicked woman!

56
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,880
Let me just make this clear. I really haven't done anything wrong.

57
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:30,000
It's just a bunch of idiotic guys falling in love with me.

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,920
Maybe my face is just too cute for my own good.

59
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,110
That's some attitude you have.

60
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:37,460
- Should I have been more modest, then?
- No.

61
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,480
I'm glad I got to see you in all your rotten glory.

62
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,720
Hurry up and fire me already, King.

63
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,280
"King"?

64
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,980
Didn't you know that people call you "King"?

65
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,410
Maybe because you're a lofty king who knows nothing of the average person.

66
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,900
- Did I make you angry?
- Excellent!

67
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,760
You're the most unpleasant woman ever.

68
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,330
Marry me.

69
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,450
Pardon me?

70
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,290
Let's get married.

71
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:20,160
Life is unpredictable.

72
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,830
A girl who dreamed of being Cinderella

73
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,900
was born to a family who ran a fishcake shop.

74
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,090
Here you go.

75
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:28,950
- Do your best, Ayaka-chan!
- Mom, I'm hungry!

76
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,350
Wait a second, Riku.

77
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,210
Go on, say it!

78
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,050

79
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,690
- Li—
- "Li"?

81
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:40,470
You're a dummy!

What?

83
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,750
Dummy!

84
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,810
If you're going to stop by, at least buy something, dummies!

85
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,860
Ayaka, you made a move on my boyfriend, didn't you?

86
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,140
Is everything okay?

87
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,480
Don't get carried away just because you're cuter than others.

88
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,310
You're the worst!

89
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:02,590
Can you blame me for being cute?

90
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:06,120
As the saying goes, "Out of the mouth comes misfortune."

91
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,330
But it's her face that brings misfortune in her case.

92
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,470
Hey, Haneda.

93
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:13,580
Which has caused her to lack tact somewhat.

95

See?

96
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,580
- I knew it!
- Wow, that's pretty cool!

97
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:23,760
And she had very few friends.

[Props to the artist. LOL
The once-in-a-century wicked woman is complete.]

99
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,140
She came from a large family with a tight budget.

100
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:36,460
She didn't quite have the brains to receive any scholarships,

101
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:40,000
so she skipped college and got a job instead. However...

102
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,320
Hey, Ayaka-chan? Give me your LINE details (messaging app).

- Give me a break! It's my turn to order from Ayaka!

106
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,610
It's my turn to order from Ayaka-san!

107
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:57,860

- Ayaka is mine!
- No, she's mine!

She's mine!

111
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:09,260
Her face really did bring misfortune, and none of her jobs lasted longer than three months.

00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:20,810
He desperately tried to rebuild it in his own way,

347
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:23,920
but his methods didn't lead to higher company profits.

348
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:28,190
His parents insisted there was a better way.

349
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:31,430
In other words, a marriage of convenience.

350
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,500
She's perfect for you.

351
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,090
In the end, he ended up taking the path his parents forged.

352
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:38,400
In the end, he ended up taking the path his parents forged.

353
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,170
He'd almost resigned himself to that fate until...

354
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:43,680
There's an increase in the number of people with no dreams of marriage.

355
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:47,180
I can say with confidence that the future is bleak.

356
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:50,560
Then what do you believe is the best course of action?

357
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:55,740
To make them realize how wonderful marriages are, even if only for a moment.

358
00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:00,430
It may not sound great put like this, but we find a way to make them see this dream.

359
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:06,940
Even if it's disingenuous, clients will be satisfied as long as that one moment is great.

360
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,680
What is marriage to you?

361
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,880
The mere thought of it is hellish.

362
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,990
You're hired.

363
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,820
What?

364
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:25,050
And who did he lay eyes on? My sister.

365
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:37,270
Haneda-san, do you have a moment?

366
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:41,420
- Okay.
- Can you work together with the new kid who's transferred over?

367
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:44,380
Teach him everything you know until he gets the hang of things.

368
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,970
Will I be paid for overtime?

369
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:48,770
Of course!

370
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:52,940
But are you sure you want me to do this?

371
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:55,980
I've only been here for half a year, so...

372
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:00,990
I'm sure you're garnering the envy of some of the others by getting married to the president.

373
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:05,680
That's why I thought it'd be good for you to show them how you look when hard at work.

374
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:11,250
Come on! You'll be getting paid overtime and all.

375
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:15,210
Well...

376
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,050
Okay, then.

377
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:19,980
- Takemoto-kun!
- Yes!

378
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,760
Coming in!

379
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,760
Pleased to meet you! My name is Takemoto!

380
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,550
I've transferred from Nitta Hotel's sales department. Thank you for having me!

381
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:31,280
I'm Haneda. Nice to meet you.

382
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,640
- She's the president's wife.
- What?

383
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,650
You're the King's wife?

384
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:40,370
You're as cute as I imagined.

385
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,850
Oh, this is great.

386
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:48,880
This is the chapel. There are several others, too.

387
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:56,040
This party space has a 100-person capacity.

388
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,790
It's sometimes used as an event venue as well.

389
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:03,830
This is where the largest number of Yume Maison dresses are stocked.

390
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:07,820
Could you hold this up to you to see how it looks?

391
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,250
- This is—
- Oh, hey!

392
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:16,450
Care to exchange LINE details?

393
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:19,530
Hey, Ayaka-chan? Give me your LINE details.

394
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:26,520
I'd love to have my wife wear that dress from earlier.

395
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,670
You're married?

396
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:32,900
Yeah, I'm planning to.

397
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,460
With my girlfriend.

398
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:39,590
- I see.
- Her name's Ichika-chan!

399
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:42,820
She's an actress and the oldest of five sisters.

400
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:48,360
It was that strength she must have as the eldest sister that shone so bright in my eyes!

401
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,880
Oh?

402
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:06,650
Hey, Haneda-san! Where'd you go?

403
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:08,860
You're still here?

404
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,190
Well, actually...

405
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:14,430
I'm a fan of "The Battler"!

406
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:20,850
I figured that a guy like the King would only settle for a perfect woman.

407
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:24,360
That's why I'd like to call you "Queen"!

408
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,030
Oh, please don't.

409
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,540
Don't be like that.

410
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:30,510
You were chosen by the King.

411
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,610
"I'm not choosing anyone."

412
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,960
It was super popular! It has 1.2 million views!

413
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:43,400
I'll be your follower for the rest of my life!

414
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,470
I'll do anything you want.

415
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,330
"Anything"?

416
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,170
Make sure to mark it as "attention required" if it's a surprise.

417
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:57,640
Got it!

418
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:02,210
I'll leave it with you again today. Call me if you need me.

419
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,730
Okay!

420
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,980
W-Wait!

421
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,610
I got you a gift!

422
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:34,790
From that famous place?

423
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:37,560
The cake from yesterday was delicious too!

424
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,060
Here you go.

425
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,540
Thank you!

426
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:46,000
- Would you like one?
- No, I'm working.

427
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:50,240
- Here you go.
- No, thanks.

428
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,380
Would you like one?

429
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:55,250
Oh, I know these!

430
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:57,240
But no.

431
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,990
- Here you go!
- Oh, thanks.

432
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,750
What is this? It's so good!

433
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:08,090
Haneda-san drops out of work every day.

434
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:10,110
How dare she slack off at a time like this?

435
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:13,460
We're working so hard to get more clients.

436
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:17,930
Just because she's the president's wife doesn't mean she should get special treatment.

437
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:21,530
Understood. I'll ask Haneda-san.

438
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:22,740
Thank you.

439
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,610
She's forcing Takemoto-kun to do all her work.

440
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:25,920
What?

441
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,310
I think she's put him in an awkward situation, too.

442
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:31,440
No, I'm fine.

443
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:37,570
Now let me double-check. Are you really going to marry Ayaka-san?

444
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:38,820
Now, now, Dear.

445
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:41,600
Yes, I will marry her.

446
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,570
Company performance is dropping again.

447
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,520
My apologies.

448
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:53,090
It's tough everywhere right now. Togo's doing his best.

449
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:58,140
He won't make it in this industry if doing his best doesn't produce any results.

450
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,160
He won't survive.

451
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,110
Are you saying I should've accepted the other marriage proposal, then?

452
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:06,860
Their family is the biggest player in the industry.

453
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:09,300
Accepting that offer would've stabilized us.

454
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:18,280
You won't have any complaints if I rebuild the business, right?

455
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,300
I have my own plan.

456
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,720
Another reality TV show?

457
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,290
You can't deny that the show saved La Blanche from the brink of death.

458
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:32,180
Nobody has hopes for marriage in this day and age.

459
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:35,720
The cost of living continues to rise despite wages never budging.

460
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:39,070
Many people see starting a family as a burden.

461
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:44,080
There's been a sharp decrease in people holding extravagant weddings post-COVID.

462
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:50,640
We need to do something new in order to survive.

463
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,060
How long do you suggest?

464
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:03,750
Companies have limited lifespans, much like people do.

465
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:06,620
At this rate, La Blanche won't live much longer.

466
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,030
I will rebuild within a year,

467
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,850
together with my wife.

468
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:17,430
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

469
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,940
How many times will we do this?

470
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:25,820
Togo, the man who refused to choose, is getting married tomorrow! Congrats!

471
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:31,600
You won't be able to party anymore, Togo.

472
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,670
I've partied plenty.

473
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,100
Next up is you, Yuya!

474
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:42,220
I'm going to party my whole life!

475
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,160
Yes!

476
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,350
Won't you get lonely?

477
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:49,630
Are you for real? Who gets lonely when partying?

478
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:51,240
[Please RSVP by March 31]

479
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,220
Wow, you're seriously getting married, Sis.

480
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,460
I bet you're all sad I won't be around!

481
00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:00,620
Yeah, I am. Don't get married.

482
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:03,730
It's okay. I'll still be here.

483
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:07,960
What? Why? Hurry up and get out already!

484
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:11,960
We'll live together once he moves.

485
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,690
When's that?

486
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,420
I don't know yet.

487
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:21,300
But I'll do what I can to help around the house while I'm still here.

488
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:24,160
You're getting married, so don't worry about us.

489
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,720
Right!

490
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,730
Family is still family.

491
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:31,410
But you and Togo-san will become a family, won't you?

492
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,740
You guys don't really fit, but I think you're a good match.

493
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:41,220
Why are you marrying Togo?

494
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:44,000
Because you "dropped into the likes"?

495
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,430
- What?
- "Drop into likes."

496
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:49,910
Because you fell in love!

497
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:53,410
Stop that! You'll make me all embarrassed!

498
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:55,060
Now, since you're marrying into a rich family...

499
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,320
Congrats!

500
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:01,000
Hooray!

501
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,890
- Congrats!
- Congrats!

502
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:06,420
Yay!

503
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:10,720
Excellent timing!

504
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,440
- Can't wait for tomorrow!
- For sure!

505
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:16,020
- Guess what? I borrowed some cute clothes!
- Really?

506
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,740
I'm so jealous.

507
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:33,990
You're still working?

508
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:37,800
We can't prep tomorrow because of your wedding.

509
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:41,820
We have to earn money, right?

510
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:49,760
♫ I was crying ♫

511
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:55,370
♫ and recalled your face in order not to lose it ♫

512
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:58,560
Geez! Don't scare me!

513
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:03,890
Come on, quit running away. You're the star here. Everyone's worried about you.

514
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:06,160
Can't a man have a little break?

515
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,980
What's up? Getting cold feet?

516
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,960
Please.

517
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,930
I'm looking forward to it.

518
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,310
Oh?

519

00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:53,050
It's nothing. See?

694
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:58,320
It happens all the time, so please don't pay too much mind to it.

695
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,120
I'm sorry.

696
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:05,100
There was a part of me that thought that maybe you weren't to blame.

697
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:07,400
There was a part of me that thought that maybe you weren't to blame.

698

Could I talk to you again if anything else is unclear to me?
[MyRoom Hotel]

699
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:12,950
- Yes, of course.
- Thank you very much.

700
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:15,450
There are still some things I'd like to discuss with you, so—

701
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:18,110
- Well, please stop.
- I won't do anything to you.

702
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:21,940
He tried to force you into the hotel with him, didn't he?

703
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:27,310
But...

704
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:30,520
I couldn't accept that.

705
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:36,050
When I heard you were getting married to Nitta-san, I couldn't allow it.

706
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:41,620
I didn't think it was fair that you found happiness while I was left broken.

707
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:46,240
I'm worse than scum.

708
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:50,010
Yet you still defended me.

709
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:55,180
Thank you so very much.

710
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:03,850
You're not the scum here.

711

It's that lowlife guy.

712
00:51:08,810 --> 00:51:15,470
I know you will find someone far more wonderful.

713
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:30,160
I don't know when the time will come,

714
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:34,480
but I want you to be in charge of my wedding ceremony.

715
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,320
I would be honored.

716
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:41,790
I will make it the best ceremony ever.

717
00:51:57,820 --> 00:52:01,570
Thank you for everything.

718
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:06,730
But how did you know?

719
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:10,920
There were complaints of you slipping out of work and slacking off.

720
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:14,250
But when I asked Takemoto, he denied it.

721
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:22,150
You were using that time to meet with Watanabe-san

722
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:23,830
without the company's permission.

723
00:52:23,830 --> 00:52:26,190
- I'm really sorry.
- Go away.

724
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:29,520
I genuinely want you to find happiness.

725
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:33,750
- If there's anything I can do—
- I just thought that your concerted efforts toward your clients

726
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:36,320
would set a good example for the other staff members.

727
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:40,000
Do you get it now?

728
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,960
I didn't choose you as the Employee of the Month because you're my wife.

729
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:47,470
You're putting on that whole "wicked woman" act, aren't you?

730
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,660
You're a fool.

731
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:54,200
Excuse me?

732
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,980
It's been a while since I've come across an idiot as big as you.

733
00:52:56,980 --> 00:53:01,850
Filthy-mouthed and tactless. Why are you trying to place walls around yourself?

734
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:07,150
Absurd, ungraceful, and ugly.

735
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:12,510
Perhaps you wouldn't understand, King...

as someone blessed from birth and someone always in the top echelons.

737
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:25,600
It's because... I'm a weak coward.

738
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,390
I see.

739
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:31,900
You're afraid of getting hurt.

740
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:41,980
Maybe we're more similar than you think.

741
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:00,610
It's quite deep.

742
00:54:21,850 --> 00:54:24,350
I promised, right?

743
00:54:24,350 --> 00:54:26,120
