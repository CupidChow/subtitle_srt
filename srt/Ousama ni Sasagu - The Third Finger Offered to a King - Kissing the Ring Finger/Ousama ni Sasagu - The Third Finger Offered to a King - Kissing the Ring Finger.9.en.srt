1
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,120
I need to get ready for work.

2
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:24,040
Well, thank you for having me last night.

3
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,070
We've still got time.

4
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:35,620
I can't believe this!

5
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36,740
What do you mean?

6
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,400
Well, but—

7
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,360
We have to—

8
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:58,270
We're going to be late!

9
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:00,870
Because you woke me up at a weird time.

10
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,130
Didn't you learn at school that you can't blame others for sleeping in?

11
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:08,730
Just so you know, I hate being late and people who aren't on time.

12
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:13,380
And I despise people who start complaining in the morning.

13
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:18,240
- I'm just joking!
- Hey!

14
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,360
Thanks for marrying me.

15
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,020
Likewise.

16
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,700
- Anyway, I'm off.
- What? I'm coming with you.

17
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,290
No, someone from headquarters is picking me up.

18
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:39,890
Oh! Then I'll ride with you part way—

19
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,580
Don't be spoiled.

20
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,580
What?

21
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,820
The two worst individuals have become the best married couple.

22
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,570
The two worst individuals have become the best married couple.

23
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,660
This love...

24
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:55,530
is invulnerable.

25
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:01,440
[Kissing the Ring Finger: Episode 9]

26
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,770
What do you think?

27
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,820
The design concept focusing around this large bow

28
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,140
is inspired by the strong bond between

29
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,520
the two of you that has overcome many hardships.

30
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,230
Thank you very much. I think it's great!

31
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:38,780
Well, I know this may be late notice, but we'd like to discuss something with you.

32
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,320
We'd like to increase the number of guests.

33
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:46,440
An addition to those already invited?

34
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,970
We know this may be asking for the impossible.

35
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,680
Our families finally accepted our relationship

36
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,010
and said they'd like to attend the ceremony.

37
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:57,240
Please!

38
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,410
We'll do what we can.

39
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,390
Will it really be okay? We can't increase the budget very much.

40
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:07,670
I don't think it's impossible if we cut back somewhere else.

41
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:13,710
I mean, the families so opposed to the marriage have finally agreed to attend.

42
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,770
You're right.

43
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,090
Let's do our best!

44
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,840
- And our best is what we'll do.
- Thank you very much.

45
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,190
I've just had a great idea!

46
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,560
What's wrong?

47
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,250
Say, has Dad gone over to your place?

48
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,270
No, why?

49
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:40,040
Oh, it's nothing.

50
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,680
Sorry for interrupting you during work. Later.

51
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:47,970
I see. Please let me know if he appears there.

52
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,740
Yes. Bye.

53
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,300
Ayaka says she doesn't know, either.

54
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,910
Honestly, where has your dad gone?

55
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:01,340
It'll be fine. I'm sure he's just having a nap somewhere.

56
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,600
What are you doing here, Togo?

57
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,110
You dummy, I'm here to pick you up.

58
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,900
Let's go home.

59
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,400
We've never spent time like this before.

60
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,830
Right.

61
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,640
Not bad.

62
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:36,030
Yeah, not bad at all.

63
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,720
Aren't those hydrangeas?

64
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,870
I wouldn't have expected to find them blooming here.

65
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,970
They're beautiful.

66
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:52,680
Both the hydrangeas and this path seem more beautiful than usual for some reason.

67
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:56,760
Perhaps it's because you're with me?

68
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,280
Maybe.

69
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,620
Hey...

70
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,530
That's unlike you. I'm flustered.

71
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,350
Listen. Do you want to go on vacation somewhere?

72
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:08,750
Listen. Do you want to go on vacation somewhere?

73
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,550
Sure!

74
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,320
But... aren't you busy?

75
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,130
But... aren't you busy?

76
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,000
I'll make time for you.

77
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,760
I promise.

78
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,300
It's a promise.

79
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,330
Where do you want to go?

80
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,090
I don't care, as long as I'm with you.

81
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:36,920
That answer doesn't help me.

82
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,380
Then... I know!

83
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,000
Hawaii's not an option.

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,670
- Then Germany!
- What?

85
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,550
I want to drink beer.

86
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,060
You forfeit your choice. I'll decide.

87
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,400
I don't mind Belgium either.

88
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,110
Is it beer again?

89
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,590
- Come on!
- No.

90
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:52,100
I'll take you somewhere beer-free.

91
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,550
What?

92
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,090
Just kidding.

93
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,490
Dear!

94
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,200
What happened?

95
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,490
- I'm home!
- Welcome back.

96
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,530
Where'd you go?

97
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,250
Here you go, some souvenirs!

98
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,480
Mushrooms?

99
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:16,110
I went mushroom picking.

100
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,820
Let's make hot pot and eat them tomorrow!

101
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:21,160
- All right!
- Yes!

102
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,830
This mushroom looks delicious.

103
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,350
Oh, this is a bad one.

104
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,960
Now, now,

105
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,560
- you two have school tomorrow. It's bedtime.
- Okay.

106
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,490
- Night.
- Good night.

107
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,430
Where did you go?

108
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,990
- I told you. Mushroom piー
- I know that's not true!

109
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,090
Why are you lying?

110
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,670
We've tried our best to get through everything, thick and thin (good and bad).

111
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:52,260
We've tried our best to get through everything, thick and thin (good and bad).

112
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,380
So tell me the truth.

113
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,210
I'm sorry!

114
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,500
So...

115
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:10,990
Yocchan's company went bankrupt.

116
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,100
What?

117
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:16,000
And he went missing.

118
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,980
I had signed as a joint guarantor.

119
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,480
I had signed as a joint guarantor.

120
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,030
That means, now,

121
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,240
the debt is on me.

122
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,820
How much is it?

123
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,830
It's ¥100,000,000 (~$685,000).

124
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:50,590
How is Togo doing back at the head office?

125
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,380
He's working hard.

126
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,130
Oh, by the way.

127
00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:02,790
I've decided against selling La Blanche; I'll let Sakuraba-kun continue running it.

128
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,790
Dear...

129
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,440
what's the meaning of this?

130
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,160
Shizuka,

131
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,770
Sakuraba-kun is your son.

132
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:19,800
- He should be by your—
- Togo is my only son.

133
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,750
- I'll be leaving now.
- Thank you for your time.

134
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:37,070
Are things going well with Ayaka-san?

135
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,600
Yes.

136
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,110
As are the video uploads.

137
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,620
That's good to hear.

138
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,010
I'm looking forward to watching.

139
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,470
Father.

140
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:57,420
I looked into Sakuraba-san.

141
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,370
He's connected to you somehow, isn't he?

142
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,340
What about your family, Nitta-san?

143
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,990
What is your mother like?

144
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:11,460
Sakuraba-kun is Shizuka's son.

145
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,770
Sakuraba-kun is Shizuka's son.

146
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:22,340
Shizuka tearfully gave away her child and married me.

147
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,020
That's why she can be overprotective of you.

148
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,530
That's why she can be overprotective of you.

149
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:30,630
No matter what you say,

150
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,850
I won't forgive her for what she's done.

151
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,010
I understand how you feel.

152
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,760
But I want you to understand your mother, too.

153
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,660
But I want you to understand your mother, too.

154
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,250
I want Shizuka to feel like a real mother.

155
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,310
I want Shizuka to feel like a real mother.

156
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:14,350
Wel... come... home.

157
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,710
Togo! Join her!

158
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:22,920
If the other person can tell you're shaking, then it's game over.

159
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,030
- Got it.
- Here you go.

160
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,660
And power on!

161
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:30,600
Hello?
[La Blanche]

162
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,060
Long time no speak, Takemoto-kun.

163
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,410
It's Nitta.

164
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:38,150
K-K-King?

165
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:40,420
I mean, Pr-President!

166
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,460
You...

167
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:48,360
work...

168
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,520
so hard.

169
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,110
I hope you'll...

170
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,970
keep up the good work.

171
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,340
You're laughing too much, Riku.

172
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:59,120
- Can you blame me?
- I know, I know.

173
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,430
Hey, lazy person. Go shopping.

174
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:03,810
- I don't want to.
- Just go.

175
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:06,050
With how many tens of thousands of yen?

176
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:09,430
Buy as much of whatever you want.

177
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:11,660
No price limit?

178
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,430
- Off I go!
- Go on.

179
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:18,310
Why is she so greedy?

180
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:21,580
That's how it is with the rising cost of living.

181
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,640
You're clearly her younger brother.

00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:57,190
I'm fine. I can take any form of abuse thrown at me.

360
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:59,110
Who did this?

361
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:02,550
We're looking into it, but we were probably hacked.

362
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:05,160
I think I know who it was.

363
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,070
Ayaka.

364
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,560
You haven't done anything wrong.

365
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,120
This is all my responsibility.

366
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:21,110
I dragged you and your family into this.

367
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:24,320
I apologize.

368
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,090
Togo...

369
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:29,000
We had a contract marriage.

370
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,720
But...

371
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,930
I think we're a real married couple now.

372
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,210
Me, too.

373
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:42,050
Therefore, it's wrong to call ourselves a fake couple.

374
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:44,090
But we need to acknowledge the original contract

375
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:48,360
to calm this wildfire and then close the channel.

376
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,140
Okay.

377
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:13,130
We would like to apologize

378
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:17,640
for all the trouble we have caused.

379
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,190
We are very sorry.

380
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,860
I asked her to marry me in order

381
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:32,530
to boost La Blanche's business performance.

382
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,350
That is the truth.

383
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:40,750
As Haneda-san was a staff member,

384
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:44,760
she agreed to this marriage as part of her job

385
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,480
to help with publicity.

386
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:51,540
That was part of the reason.

387
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,590
However,

388
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,410
as commented by many of you,

389
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:00,440
I agreed to this marriage...

390
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:04,060
for money.

391
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,360
I wanted to live a better life.

392
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:14,360
I figured that if I married,

393
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,170
I would not have

394
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:19,090
any money problems in the future.

395
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:24,200
That's how calculating and selfish I was.

396
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:40,080
What's so interesting about that?

397
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,180
Shizuka,

398
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:46,430
you didn't do this, did you?

399
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:55,300
I only do things to help Togo.

400
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,990
We only had

401
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:04,370
our own interests in mind.

402
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:06,610
Our marriage was by contract.

403
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:09,840
But...

404
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,490
that was a mistake.

405
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,000
We have deceived

406
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,790
everyone...

407
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:24,380
and our precious families.

408
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,850
We could not be sorrier.

409
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:34,750
My deepest apologies.

410
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:38,200
As of today,

411
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,010
our channel will no longer be operating.

412
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,600
I watched the live stream.

413
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:59,820
It was your handiwork, wasn't it?

414
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:03,500
That's not a nice way to put it.

415
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:07,000
You were the ones who deceived the public.

416
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,740
I am remorseful for causing trouble.

417
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,720
What's going to happen between you and Ayaka-san?

418
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,560
It would be difficult for you to stay married with all that's happened.

419
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,550
We're not breaking up.

420
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,400
No matter what you might do,

421
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,660
Ayaka and I won't give in.

422
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:48,440
Are you sure about that?

423
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:01,290
I have caused you much strife.

424
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:05,980
Are you really sure, Togo?

425
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,710
Yes.

426
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:23,360
Fix this, then...

427
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,770
Good thing it's all blown over, right?

428
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:30,320
Maybe that apology video worked.

429
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,990
But I'm absolutely sure

430
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:36,760
that the King and Queen are a real married couple.

431
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:40,960
Right?

432
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:44,680
Right. I agree.

433
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:48,580
Well, I really liked their live streams.

434
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,970
True.

435
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:52,240
Baba-san is almost ready.

436
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,360
Your tuxedo today looks great on you.

437
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:59,580
I can't wait to show him.

438
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:07,470
Thank you for organizing such an amazing ceremony

439
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:09,280
after all our difficult requests.

440
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,720
Not at all.

441
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,460
I should be apologizing for all the chaos I caused.

442
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:18,320
Coming in!

443
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,200
It's almost time.

444
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,490
Shall we?

445
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:26,650
Haneda-san.

446
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:32,450
I think married couples and marriages

447
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:35,440
can take on all different shapes and forms.

448
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,790
So I'm praying for your happiness.

449
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,050
Thank you very much.

450
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:49,300
Do you take him as your lawfully wedded husband?

451
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:53,650
I do.

452
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:57,020
Let us now exchange rings.

453
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:17,560
Here you go.

454
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,160
Eat up.

455
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:28,390
Togo.

456
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:32,770
I think it's better this way.

457
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:34,140
What is?

458
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:39,160
We caused lots of trouble after it all got exposed,

459
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,280
but now our consciences are clear.

460
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,960
Right.

461
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,160
I think I'm happier than I've ever been now.

462
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:52,210
Hey, Ayaka?

463
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:55,440
Do you want to go somewhere tomorrow, just the two of us?

464
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:05,430
Okay, here we go.

465
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:08,230
Let's eat heartily.

466
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,520
You're getting good at that.

467
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:13,580
Of course, I am. Your dad was so picky about the angle of my hands.

468
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,090
- He was!
- I was more like this at the beginning.

469
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:16,320
- It's this way, right?
- Yeah, this way.

470
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,610
- To hug the fishcake plank.
- Right.

471
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:20,490
- I've gotten good, right?
- You totally have.

472
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:37,780
Thank you for waiting.

473
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,350
Enjoy the meal (in German).

474
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,190
This isn't exactly Germany.

475
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:47,220
But you can drink as much beer as you want.

476
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:50,350
Now, nothing can beat that!

477
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:53,110
Also,

478
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,950
I've booked this entire place.

479
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:58,410
I just thought the place was unpopular.

480
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,290
Are you an idiot?

481
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:02,260
You booked it, I see.

482
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:09,440
Welcome, welcome (in German).

483
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,130
What a blast!

484
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:14,750
Do you know the duck dance?

485
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:17,330
"The duck dance"?

486
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,700
Togo.

487
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,930
No way.

488
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:28,050
- It won't be embarrassing if we dance together.
- No.

489
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:29,910
No one is watching. Come on!

490
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:31,090
Hey!

491
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:33,630
- Shall I teach you?
- Yes, please!

492
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,720
It's so wide and open!

493
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:04,800
Because it's the sky.

494
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:12,240
Hey, my clothes will get dirty!

495
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:17,320
Then you can wash them.

496
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,270
It feels good, doesn't it?

497
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:27,130
Embarrassingly so.

498
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,560
Nobody's watching right now, so it's okay.

499
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:36,810
We're the only two people in this world.

500
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,870
We can't hear people say horrible things

501
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:45,980
or things to hurt us. Nothing.

502
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:49,390
There is no one here to interrupt us.

503
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,790
It's just us.

504
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,950
Right.

505
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,440
It's so bright out here!

506
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,320
Yes, it sure is.

507
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:17,470
Stop that.

508
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:18,550
Why?

509
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,950
Hey, let's take a photo together.

510
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:32,880
What?

511
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,360
I'm just imprinting this moment in my eyes.

512
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:38,320
What are you talking about?

513
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,380
Togo.

514
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:47,090
I love you.

515
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:27,660
Are you crying?

516
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,220
Don't be silly.

517
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,960
Let's go home.

518
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,690
I'm home!

519
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:01,510
[Notification of Divorce]

520
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,190
What's this?

521
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,860
I want a divorce.

522
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,320
Please.

523
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:17,630
I guess it's just a piece of paper.

524
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:19,540
- Married or not, we're still husband and wife.
- No.

525
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:22,090
- Married or not, we're still husband and wife.
- No.

526
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:24,030
I want to break up.

527
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,870
What?

528
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:30,720
I want to end things between us.

529
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,260
What are you saying?

530
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,380
Why?

531
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:40,220
- But we went on a date today.
- Because I promised you.

532
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:46,160
I'm just tired of everything.

533
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,060
What do you mean by "tired"?

534
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:51,400
- I don't understa—
- This isn't working.

535
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,320
I want to end everything.

536
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,360
I'm seriously tired.

537
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,580
What's gotten into you suddenly?

538
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:03,570
- You're not being serious, are you?
- I am.

539
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:05,930
I don't believe you.

540
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:09,470
We became a real husband and wife.

541
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:10,950
You said you wanted us

542
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:15,020
- to be a family too.
