00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,270
I'm honored.

185
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:36,100
Matsui-san had a wedding with us last year.

186
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,500
Sorry, we didn't see you were busy.

187
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,200
Give this hall a chance. I recommend it!

188
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,560
Thank you.

189
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,320
You're welcome to visit again any time.

190
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,690
All right.

191
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,460
Apologies for that.

192
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,660
What a wonderful atmosphere.

193
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:02,750
That would be thanks to our hall's unique, tall ceilings.

194
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,720
Mr. Manager!

195
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,310
The tour boat captain requests your presence.

196
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,620
Again?

197
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:11,920
This time, it seems he'd like your help with a relative's wedding.

198
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,060
While I'm thankful, now isn't exactly...

199
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,360
We can be left on our own.

200
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,340
Please go assist him.

201
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:23,090
Thank you kindly. Please give me a moment.

202
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,780
- Good day, Sir.
- Sakuraba-san!

203
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,440
The ceremony you organized for me before was a wonder.

204
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,300
Thank you very much.

205
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:36,120
I'm referring you to my sister...

206
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,570
He's right. Their ceiling is high.

207
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:42,000
A choir or organ would work well here.

208
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,890
A choir or organ would work well here.

209
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,350
Agreed.

210
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:59,210
Sakuraba-san was nice, not to mention the hall itself.

211
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:02,710
The issue isn't customer satisfaction, but the profits...

212
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:05,770
What's more important than a satisfying experience?

213
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,690
Listen up...

214
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:13,140
Maybe I have a snack.

215
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,540
Let's see.

216
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,040
Lucky me!

217
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,200
Hey, wait a—

218
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,990
You devil!

219
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:28,960
That was my last piece!

220
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:33,110
You're insane. Apologize now!

221
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,600
Apologize now!

222
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,080
Relax, it's just a strawberry.

223
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,920
You think you're some king?

224
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,490
Stop, you're embarrassing us—

225
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,300
Get mad too, Hachi!

226
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:51,000
- It has strawberries inside.
- The one on top is special!

227
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,800
- This is no laughing matter, thief.
- What?

228
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,540
I'll take another bag of candy as compensation, thief.

229
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:59,850
Taking a piece of candy doesn't make someone a thief, moron.

230
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:02,150
Hey, I want it back!

231
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,410
- Hey, Togo.
- Yeah?

232
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:16,190
You hide yourself under a mask, don't you?

233
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,870
And no one exposes their emotions like you, Sayo.

234
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:23,630
But doesn't that ever get rough?

235
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,250
What?

236
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:29,130
No need to act tough around us, okay?

237
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:39,750
♫ I was crying ♫

238
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,860
♫ and recalled your face ♫

239
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:45,190
I bought your share too.

240
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:48,650
♫ Before it turns into a mental bruise ♫

241
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:50,390
President?

242
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,720
Here.

243
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,140
You can pay me back later.

244
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:59,660
♫ Forever and ever ♫

245
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,590
♫ Something like forgetting ♫

246
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,480
I wonder what's for dinner.

247
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,110
We just ate.

248
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:16,220
- Over here!
- Coming.

249
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,060
Here?

250
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,660
- Yes!
- Ready?

251
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,340
Say "cheese"!

252
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:25,530
♫ Your spoken lines that don't suit you at all ♫

253
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,710
Got it?

254
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:35,870
I predict they'll serve us a sushi boat.

255
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:38,420
Maybe even Hakone specialties like tofu skin.

256
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,090
You'll order wine, won't you?

257
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:47,080
♫ I just kept looking into these eyes ♫

258
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,370
- Thank you.
- I'll now reassign Haneda-san's clients to us all.

259
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,790
- Thank you.
- I'll now reassign Haneda-san's clients to us all.

260
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,420
Yes, Ma'am.

261
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:03,250
Yasuda-sama will be taken care of by Mori-san and Nikaido-san.

262
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,790
Me?

263
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:07,770
I'm already near my limit with three cases as well.

264
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:12,240
She's so special, just because she's the President's wife.

265
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,850
My apologies for their unsightly behavior.

266
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,520
No worries.

267
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:20,410
Is the president's wife as selfish as they make her out to be?

268
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,340
She is the Cinderella of our generation, after all.

269
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,310
She's harboring grudges again.

270
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,610
Not interested in dinner?

271
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:49,990
It's all yours.

272
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:13,260
You know. If it's what you want,

273
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,500
You know. If it's what you want,

274
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,410
I wouldn't mind a divorce.

275
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,490
I'm saying this for Sayo-san.

276
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:25,690
You love her, don't you?

277
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:31,210
Those two aren't married yet.

278
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:36,300
While I don't know if you have a shot at all...

279
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,720
you can't let your feelings end here.

280
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:47,040
This room was a treat itself.

281
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,030
I've had my fill of luxury already—

282
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:52,810
Don't bother worrying.

283
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:58,060
See, that's the reason I do.

284
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:03,340
I don't like seeing you look glum anymore.

285
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,860
It's none of your business.

286
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:09,740
I guess not.

287
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,470
But it is.

288
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:19,780
Your gloominess only makes the alcohol taste worse.

289
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:23,780
So don't mind me, the one who's a contract.

290
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:26,660
Do you want me to request a divorce?

291
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:30,130
Maybe you're after compensation.

292
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:33,190
- Right, I'd get money.
- I'm not paying.

293
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:36,370
Do you realize how many assets we'd lose by quitting?

294
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:40,000
"Assets"?

295
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:44,410
Love isn't about money or assets.

296
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:47,910
- You're a fool.
- No, you're the real fool.

297
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:52,120
You might regret this for life.

298
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,970
Will you really not do anything?

299
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:03,440
Our marriage is a contract.

300
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,910
No matter whom I love,

301
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:08,920
you don't have any right to object.

302
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:13,090
Ultimately, it's none of your business.

303
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,300
You're right.

304
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:42,830
It's none of your business.

305
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:48,310
Ayaka-chan!

306
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:56,080
Did you have a fight with Togo?

307
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,960
It was nothing serious.

308
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:06,130
But enough about me. Isn't your ceremony coming up?

309
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:10,180
It is! We'll send you an invitation.

310
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:15,690
And that's set in stone, right?

311
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:20,560
No extensions or cancelations?

312
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,120
Of course not! Why?

313
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,830
Let me guess. You're wondering if I'm pregnant.

314
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:32,720
Well, not yet!

315
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,020
So, Ayaka-chan, what do you love about Togo?

316
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,570
Pardon?

317
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:44,030
Let's see...

318
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,260
I wonder that myself.

319
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,670
He acts macho.

320
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:54,490
He's arrogant and loves to be clean.

321
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,940
He's a stingy, stoic cheapskate.

322
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,920
He's not kind to Negi either.

323
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,020
That's my dog, by the way.

324
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,870
Ayaka-chan, those were all insults.

325
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,820
Oh, I mean...

326
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:10,180
He has an appeal that surmounts all of those flaws.

327
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,390
I see.

328
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:15,240
What a relief.

329
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:21,930
In other words, you'll stick with him despite your complaints.

330
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:27,150
Now that's love!

331
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:30,710
- Isn't it?
- It is indeed.

332
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:34,600
He's so loved!

333
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,090
Ouch...

334
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,400
Are you okay?

335
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,720
She's hurt. Can you stand?

336
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,610
Want me to carry you on my back?

337
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:05,270
I'm fine, thank you.

338
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:07,620
We'll help you back. Where are you staying?

339
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,600
Please let go of me.

340
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:18,920
Can't you see her wedding ring?

341
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,470
Sorry?

342
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:23,920
Wait, he's from "The Battler."

343
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,700
Seriously! It's the King!

344
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,890
A-Amazing!

345
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:28,370
Let's go.

346
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,810
Bliss...

347
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:49,450
Are you all right?

348
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,700
Is that you, President?

349
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,100
Yes.

350
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:59,710
Are you alone over there?

351
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,370
Yes.

352
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,280
Why did you come and get me?

353
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:21,430
Sayo called and told me to make up with you.

354
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,040
I see.

355
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:29,480
Thank you.

356
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,240
Also...

357
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:36,590
I know I pried into your business.

358
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:39,760
I'm sorry about that.

359
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:41,930
What?

360
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,890
Did you say something?

361
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:47,080
I said...

362
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:50,390
"S-Sorry."

363
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,490
Likewise.

364
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,110
I went too far.

365
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,250
Sorry.

366
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:16,800
Did you just... apologize?

367
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:20,460
You have a terrible personality.

368
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,670
Take the bed; an injured person should use it.

369
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,530
What?

370
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:44,430
Here.

371
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:45,930
Thanks.

372
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:49,450
I'll sleep on the couch.

373
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:51,590
It's fine.

374
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:54,730
But I know you'll complain later.

375
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:57,350
How about we use the bed together?

376
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,340
Well, I mean...

377
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:05,640
i-it's a king size! Nothing would happen between us anyway.

378
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:09,320
Of course not.

379
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,050
Yes?

380
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:14,720
Togo! Do you have a minute?

381
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,850
Where is Ayaka-chan?

382
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:18,930
Still asleep.

383
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:20,470
Why?

384
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:25,460
Ayaka-chan was feeling rather down yesterday.

385
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,250
She's fine now.

386
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,480
It won't affect our work either.

387
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,550
So you two made up?

388
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:32,930
Yeah.

389
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:35,920
So?

390
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:39,310
Is that why you came here bright and early?

391
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,440
What?

392
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:49,720
I came to talk about Sayo-chan and me.

393
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:55,660
I want you to give us your blessing for the wedding.

394
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:01,990
You're planning to avoid our ceremony with work, aren't you?

395
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:06,370
I know you've always loved Sayo-chan.

396
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:09,680
Isn't that why you married Ayaka-chan?

397
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:18,630
I hate how this isn't getting resolved.

398
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:21,120
Even though I know it's selfish, I want you to celebrate us.

399
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,520
Even though I know it's selfish, I want you to celebrate us.

400
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,600
I am.

401
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,600
Please tell me how you feel about all this.

402
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,560
- Otherwise, we—
- There's nothing to say.

403
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:40,150
Am I the only one who thought we were friends?

404
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:51,120
Have it your way.

405
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:59,380
Why did you act like that?

406
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,430
Hachi-san is your friend, isn't he?

407
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:05,750
He only wanted your honesty.

408
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:09,380
- Was it—
- Honesty can destroy relationships.

409
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,660
Sorry.

410
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,410
Give me some time alone today.

411
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:22,130
- No.
- Excuse me?

412
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:24,620
You're coming sightseeing with me.

413
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,990
Go alone.

414
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:28,560
- We need videos—
- Leave me be.

415
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:32,330
They'll get trending, I guarantee!

416
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,260
Great, let's go.

417
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,380
Look.

418
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:42,510
One of these supposedly increases your lifespan by seven years!

419
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:44,120
It's white? I guess black eggs aren't black all the way through.

420
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:47,730
It's white? I guess black eggs aren't black all the way through.

421
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:49,880
Did you know that, President?

422
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,520
What about your vlogs?

423
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,030
Let's just focus on sightseeing today.

424
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:03,590
That's a unique design.

425
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:04,790
Is it a bear?

426
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,740
It's obviously a rabbit.

427
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:11,230
[Venetian Glass Museum]

428
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:15,580
President, look! It sparkles up top too!

429
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,700
I would've loved to show my brothers this.

430
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:31,140
How about we visit Hakone Shrine later?

431
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:34,850
It's apparently a great place for good fortune.

432
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:37,050
We'll have to buy ourselves an amulet!

433
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:41,200
What is it?

434
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:46,680
If you think I'm feeling down, you're wrong.

435
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:51,700
And if you think I'm cheering you up, you're wrong.

436
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:56,340
All I want is to spend your money and go sightseeing.

437
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,440
Besides, aren't you glad you came?

438
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,290
This was pointless!

439
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:11,640
Fate is telling us to divorce, with all these mistakes.

440
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,320
Excuse me? It was only a wedding.

441
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,500
How are you not mad?

442
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,100
What's over is over!

443
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,740
There's no point complaining now.

444
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,230
Of course, there is! My dress wasn't the one I chose.

445
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:24,420
Of course, there is! My dress wasn't the one I chose.

446
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:28,500
And how does our planner change at the last minute?

447
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,060
What a horrible wedding company.

448
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,510
But is a divorce necessary?

449
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:36,750
That's how important a wedding is.

450
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:39,860
It's their memory of a lifetime.

451
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:42,330
If only I was their planner.

452
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:45,220
Impossible, there's no way!

453
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:54,180
What are you doing? You're a planner, aren't you?

454
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:03,920
Would you like to have another ceremony?

455
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:07,420
Our company has a hall here in Hakone.

456
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:10,650
Nothing will change from a do-over.

457
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:12,890
Yes, I agree.

458
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:14,400
What?

459
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:19,180
Conversely, there's no reason not to hold one.

460
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:23,790
Our President Nitta will cover all the costs.

461
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,910
Interested?

462
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,830
Truth be told,

463
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:41,100
I wanted our ceremony to be on a sightseeing boat.

464
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:48,270
It was our first date... a memorable spot for us both.

465
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:56,510
Why didn't you recommend our hall? And why am I paying?

466
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:59,020
One thing led to another.

467
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:03,500
Screw you. Besides, we can't get a same-day booking for a boat.

468
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,920
Leave that to me.

469
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:10,110
They said "no" to this face!

470
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,740
Moron.

471
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:15,180
A ceremony on a sightseeing boat is...

472
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:20,050
Mr. Manager! The tour boat captain requests your presence.

473
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:23,410
President?

474
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:25,430
Did you speak to the captain?

475
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:27,790
Yes. He didn't even consider it.

476
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:30,340
Call Sakuraba-san.

477
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,350
Sorry for the sudden request.

478
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:37,450
Not at all. This is perfect for getting us acquainted.

479
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:38,650
What?

480
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:44,160
After all, it's not every day I get to meet our President and his wife.

481
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,920
If I can help, I'll be glad to.

482
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,840
Will you love one another with all the days of your life?

483
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,300
Yes, I will.

484
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,990
Yes, I will.

485
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:32,890
Please spread the La Blanche love on social media, if you will.

486
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:34,850
Will do!

487
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,370
Schemer.

488
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:44,030
Let's not forget to thank Sakuraba-san.

489
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,700
I'm glad to hear it.

490
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,270
We can't thank you enough.

491
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:51,480
To be honest, I had given up.

492
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,980
Sakuraba-san, we owe this success to you.

493
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:56,800
I wish I could have joined.

494
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,940
I'll hand the phone to the president.

495
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:02,050
Thank you, Sakuraba-san.

496
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:07,970
Truth be told, my visit was in part to survey our Hakone branch.

497
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:13,050
- Is that so?
- Satisfying reviews, yet abysmal sales, or so I heard.

498
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:17,920
My apologies, Sir. That's due to my own inadequacy.

499
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,680
Of course not.

500
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:23,470
You're the very reason our Hakone branch has satisfied clients.

501
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:28,350
If possible, please get the boating company contracted with us for future ceremonies.

502
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:29,860
Yes, Sir.

503
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,190
Thank you very much.

504
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:37,190
The captain admired your wife's enthusiasm. I'm sure he'd love to join hands.

505
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:41,900
I envy you, Sir. She's truly a wonderful wife.

506
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:44,520
She is, indeed.

507
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,190
I'm sure your mother...

508
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:50,030
was delighted as well.

509
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,770
Yes, I suppose.

510
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,210
Then I must be going. Good day.

511
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:19,280
I'm glad Sonoda-san's ceremony didn't end in a disaster.

512
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,530
Hey, let's go celebrate our success!

513
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:25,130
So you're done interrogating me?

514
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:33,810
I'm not interested and "don't have any right to object."

515
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:35,960
You're definitely holding that against me.

516
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:40,670
I'm joking. I just want to get drinks quickly. Come on!

517
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:47,730
President?

518
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:52,140
Back in middle school,

519
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:55,300
I liked the same person as my friend.

520
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:58,430
- Sorry, what?
- Shut up and listen.

521
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:04,450
I saw him talking to our crush

522
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:07,580
and called him "annoying" right in front of the class.

523
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:11,320
But my one word changed everything.

524
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:15,260
That's when the bullying began.

525
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:22,430
My friend ultimately transferred out.

526
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:26,740
That's when I decided... I wouldn't slip up a second time.

527
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,480
That's when I decided... I wouldn't slip up a second time.

528
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:37,270
That's the story. Now let's grab some drinks.

529
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:42,840
Hachi-san will be okay.

530
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:48,070
I know he will be.

531
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:52,260
He's been able to remain your friend, after all.

532
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,950
Come on.

533
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,780
Cheers!

534
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,620
Great work to us both.

535
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:19,650
Work's not over. We're filming first thing tomorrow.

536
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:22,100
I know.

537
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,180
Ayaka-chan.

538
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:28,350
He's early.

539
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:36,240
Over here!

540
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,980
Enjoy your time, you two.

541
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,930
Please have my seat.

542
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:07,140
