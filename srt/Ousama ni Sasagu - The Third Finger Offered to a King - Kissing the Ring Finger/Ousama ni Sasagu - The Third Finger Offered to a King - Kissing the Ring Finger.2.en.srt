What should a couple be like?

00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,540
It changes with time.

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:15,260
But what remains unchanged is that it's complicated and troublesome.

4
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:22,160
And there is this unique couple, bound by a strange contract.

5

- What?

- I've had enough.
- Don't go.

Yes?

Okay, thanks for the hard work.

15
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:01,280
Are we going to continue doing this for the remaining 300 plus days?

16
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,410
It's hell indeed.

Both of you look good together.

18
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:11,010
You don't need to feel awkward in front of me.

19
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,060
I'm not good at showing my affections in front of others.

20

Me, either.

21
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,980
But I've seen Togo being lovey-dovey with many women.

Hachi, are you saying that now?

23
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,010
We are still newlyweds.

Oh no, I'm feeling very jealous now.

It's bad; I feel like crying.

What are you talking about? You are the best.

Nitta Ayaka!

44
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:41,730
Recently, many people do not wish to get married.

45
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:46,730
Since the peak of 1,099,984 marriages in 1972,

46
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,470
it started to fluctuate throughout the years.

47
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,930
Due to Covid-19, there were fewer than 500,000 marriages last year,

48
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:56,050
which is less than half of those during the peak.

Well, I'm the director of a wedding company, after all.

After getting married, can I mention something I feel is a plus in my life?

- It's money.

I heard it was very well received.

I'm happy that Togo is able to have such a wonderful wife.

00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,760
I want to ask about something.

58
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,010
Is it about your mother's 88th birthday celebration?

00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,520
Yes.

60
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,300
My mother was unable to attend the wedding ceremony,

61
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:45,850
so it will be her first time meeting Ayaka-san.

62

I wonder if it will be all right.

63

If something were to go wrong, Togo would lose his standing.

That's right. You should call him "my dear husband"

- She's not free due to work and the video streaming.

195

- You can't even brew tea properly, so it's better not to go.

207

What? Then you should've rejected her.

214
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:24,720

It's a great thing, so you don't need to be embarrassed.

And it's a present from the children.

There are many people who didn't have a ceremony.

Don't I need to be there?

- Both of you are just acting, right?

- What?

- What a miser!

- I couldn't hear it.

- This is a marriage based on merits.

Instead of being forced into marriage by my parents,

295

That's because...

383
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:46,020
President, it's better for you to learn how to apologize.

384
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:49,880
It's basic manners. When you do something wrong, you apologize.

385
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,280
Then you should be the one to apologize first.

- It's fine for me to get a divorce.
