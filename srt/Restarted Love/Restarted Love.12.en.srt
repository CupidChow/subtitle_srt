1
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,159
Xu Xin

2
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:18,400
Come with me for a moment.

3
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:19,960
Okay, Teacher.

4
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:21,960
Xu Xin

5
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:22,960
Do you remember that day

6
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,599
when Teacher Liao came to watch your performance?

7
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:28,240
Out of everyone, he noticed you right away.

8
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,000
It's a rare chance to intern with their dance troupe.

9
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,280
If you do well, you could even study abroad.

10
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:34,439
What do you think?

11
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,120
Teacher Wu

12
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,719
I might need some time to think about it.

13
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:47,360
Can I give you my answer after I’ve made up my mind?

14
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,919
Then let me know as soon as you decide.

15
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:55,960
I heard there’s a great internship opportunity.

16
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,840
But you gave it up.

17
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:00,919
You’ve been dancing for so many years.

18
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,439
Don’t you want to try performing on a bigger stage?

19
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:04,120
Give it a shot?

20
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,919
I don’t want to leave school just yet.

21
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:10,080
Is it that you don’t want to leave school,

22
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,199
or is it because you can’t let go

23
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,680
of your new boyfriend?

24
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:16,919
Xu Xin

25
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:19,039
This is a big decision in your life.

26
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,599
You really need to think it through.

27
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,199
So you won’t regret it later.

28
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:29,159
Why didn’t you study art?

29
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,879
I grew up by the sea.

30
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,639
Normally, I should have been like my parents,

31
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,000
and become a fisherman.

32
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,639
But you know what?

33
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:44,599
From the moment I first picked up a paintbrush,

34
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,319
I felt like I’d found

35
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,520
what I truly love to do.

36
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,000
And I knew I could do it really well.

37
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:51,840
Just like Matisse.

38
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:54,680
I’m not that talented.

39
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,439
It’s just that I was supposed to follow my parents’ path

40
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,159
and live that life.

41
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,680
But I drifted further and further away.

42
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:02,479
What about you?

43
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,080
I don’t know.

44
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,560
My mom chose dancing for me.

45
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:11,639
I was really young back then.

46
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,000
So I didn’t have any opinions.

47
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,720
Training every day was tough,

48
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,199
but I stuck with it.

49
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,920
If you ask me what I like,

50
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,759
or what I want to do,

51
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:27,639
I honestly don’t know.

52
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,680
I know.

53
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:30,759
You’ll write novels.

54
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,519
Not those online stories,

55
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,920
but as a real author.

56
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,360
Like that one...

57
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,279
What’s her name...

58
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,199
Charlotte Brontë.

59
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:38,879
Yeah.

60
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,639
That’s her.

61
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,000
Teacher Zhong

62
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:46,560
I’ve decided to give up the chance to join the dance troupe.

63
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,519
Because I’ve found a new goal now.

64
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,040
I want to be with the most important person in my life

65
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,120
and make a future together.

66
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,680
Finished watching.

67
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,680
All done.

68
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,800
Let me guess.

69
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:50,439
So was the wife the killer?

70
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:51,800
No.

71
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,639
Guess again.

72
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,279
Really? Not her?

73
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:56,480
Then who else could it be?

74
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,040
Just kidding.

75
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,600
You got it right, it was the wife.

76
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,680
You tricked me!

77
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,839
Getting clever, huh?

78
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,040
It's getting late.

79
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,839
I should head home.

80
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:10,920
Yeah, it is late.

81
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,720
Why not stay here tonight?

82
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:16,000
You know how my mom is.

83
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,439
She's really strict with me.

84
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,240
If I don't go back on time,

85
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,199
she'll call and nag me nonstop.

86
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,160
We've been together for so long.

87
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:28,720
Should we go visit your mom?

88
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,240
But my mom,

89
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,680
she's way too strict.

90
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,439
I'm afraid she might not like you.

91
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:41,639
Don't worry.

92
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,040
I'll make sure to behave well.

93
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,319
I'll make her like me.

94
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:47,879
Mom.

95
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:48,480
Auntie.

96
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,519
Come in, quick.

97
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,519
You young people...

98
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:55,759
Always eating out.

99
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,920
Honestly,

100
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,000
the food out there isn't clean.

101
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,600
You know that, right?

102
00:06:58,839 --> 00:06:59,399
So,

103
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:00,759
it's rare to have a home-cooked meal.

104
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:01,439
Eat more.

105
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,120
This is delicious.

106
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,199
Auntie, you're a great cook.

107
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,199
Lu, what do you do for work?

108
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,240
Mom.

109
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,160
Lu Ming is an artist.

110
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,759
So,

111
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,920
my daughter found herself

112
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,279
an artist as a boyfriend?

113
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:23,199
You're too kind, Auntie.

114
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:24,319
I just graduated.

115
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,600
I'm not well-known yet.

116
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,800
But I'll work hard.

117
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,800
I'll do my best to give Xu Xin a better life.

118
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:37,800
Auntie.

119
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:39,920
Xu Xin insisted on washing the dishes herself.

120
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,839
She asked me to come keep you company.

121
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,800
That's nice.

122
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:43,480
Have a seat.

123
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:44,759
Let's have a chat.

124
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,560
Our Xu Xin,

125
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,279
she's studied dance since she was little.

126
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,480
She's won many awards.

127
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,680
So,

128
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:01,560
I really hope her future

129
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:04,959
will be truly happy,

130
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,480
carefree.

131
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:08,319
Auntie, don't worry.

132
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,800
I'll make sure she's happy.

133
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,040
I know.

134
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,360
You already said so just now.

135
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:18,560
Actually, as a mother,

136
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:22,600
I want Xu Xin to be happy now,

137
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,160
not just in the future.

138
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,240
Do you understand what I mean?

139
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,720
Of course.

140
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:33,279
I know you two truly care about each other.

141
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,840
I shouldn't interfere with your relationship.

142
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,759
After all, I was young once too.

143
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:38,360
Right?

144
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,480
It's just...

145
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,240
I hope you don't get too deeply involved.

146
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,840
Because when you're together,

147
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,960
Xu Xin might not get the happiness she deserves.

148
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:54,919
Do you get what I'm saying?

149
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,919
What are you thinking about?

150
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:16,879
Nothing.

151
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,240
Ever since we left my place,

152
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,600
you've seemed down.

153
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,600
Did my mom say something to you?

154
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:25,320
No.

155
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:27,559
We just chatted about everyday things.

156
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,080
Xu Xin

157
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,960
Have you ever regretted being with me?

158
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,000
How could I regret it, silly?

159
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,200
You treat me so well.

160
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,440
But right now, I can't

161
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,559
give you a wealthy life.

162
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,559
Why worry about that?

163
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,159
As long as we're together, that's enough.

164
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:53,200
And I don't need you to support me.

165
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:55,320
We can work hard together.

166
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,080
Starting tomorrow,

167
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:01,759
I'm going to work at a dance studio.

168
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:04,519
Even though I can't perform on stage yet,

169
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:05,879
I believe

170
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:08,120
as long as I keep dancing,

171
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,840
one day I'll be back on stage.

172
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,879
You definitely will.

173
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,799
Your dancing is the most beautiful I've ever seen.

174
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,679
That's more like you.

175
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,000
Come on, let's go back.

176
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:32,879
Mom.

177
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,279
Mom, what's wrong?

178
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:35,960
Xu Xin.

179
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,279
Xu Xin, come here!

180
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:39,759
Come here, come here!

181
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:41,960
Come here.

182
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,799
Didn't you say you weren't feeling well?

183
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:51,000
Let me introduce you.

184
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,039
This is Yu Qiao.

185
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,840
This is Yu Qiao's mother, Auntie Wu.

186
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And this is our Xin Xin.

187
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,519
Xin Xin,

188
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,879
I saw you when you were little.

189
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:59,200
Now you've grown up.

190
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,600
You're getting prettier and prettier.

191
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,200
You called me back just for a blind date?

192
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,519
What else did you think?

193
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:10,240
I just talked with Yu Qiao.

194
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,840
He studied finance.

195
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,240
He has a high income.

196
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,960
And he's really kind.

197
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,879
He's got great qualities.

198
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:16,639
Isn't that right?

199
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:19,159
Sorry, Auntie Wu, Yu Qiao.

200
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,960
Sorry to make you come all this way for nothing.

201
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:23,639
If there's nothing else, I'll be going.

202
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:25,879
Xu Xin.

203
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:26,799
Xu Xin.

204
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:29,879
Sorry.

205
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,240
Auntie Wu, Yu Qiao.

206
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,639
I already have a boyfriend.

207
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,679
I'm really sorry.

208
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:37,279
Xu Xin.

209
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:40,559
What are you doing?

210
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,440
If you dare walk out today,

211
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:43,960
don't bother coming back.

212
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,000
Mom.

213
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:47,480
I want to decide my own relationship.

214
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,440
You're not a kid anymore.

215
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:50,000
Can love put food on the table?

216
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,159
Please don't pretend to be sick

217
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:52,919
to scare me anymore.

218
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,200
I'm leaving.

219
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,559
You...

220
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:02,840
Lu Ming.

221
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,759
In the future, I really want to

222
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:05,919
go wherever I want.

223
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,960
It'd be best if I could travel around the world.

224
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:09,559
When we have money in the future,

225
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,600
I'll definitely take you to travel the world.

226
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,799
Really?

227
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:13,799
Of course.

228
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,039
I'll help you achieve all your dreams.

229
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,000
Well, I have a lot of dreams.

230
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,320
I hope

231
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,039
I can become a star dancer someday.

232
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,080
I want to be under the spotlight on a big stage.

233
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:30,440
I also want to be a mystery novelist.

234
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,039
I want to write down all the stories I see.

235
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,440
Then in the future,

236
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,320
how about we build a big traditional house?

237
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:42,720
What?

238
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,759
And we can get a dog then.

239
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,000
Raise our kids together with lots of love.

240
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:51,799
I think we'll definitely have

241
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:52,960
lots and lots of kids.

242
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:54,720
Just imagine,

243
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,120
the house will be full of flowers and plants.

244
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,480
It might be a hassle to take care of,

245
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:01,759
but I know you'll love it.

246
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:03,840
You love kids so much,

247
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:07,000
you'll definitely be a wonderful mother.

248
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:14,799
Xu Xin

249
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,399
You really are a gift from above.

250
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,960
The best, best, best gift ever.

251
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,360
I’m truly lucky.

252
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:28,919
To be with you.

253
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:32,720
After meeting you,

254
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,759
I truly believe in destiny’s plan.

255
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,039
I think you must feel the same.

256
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:44,440
Before,

257
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,000
I felt like I was

258
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,279
the most different person in the world.

259
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:53,480
But when I’m with you,

260
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:57,799
I feel like this world

261
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:59,519
is so pure, it’s just the two of us.

262
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,200
Miss Xu Xin,

263
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,519
will you marry me?

264
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,960
Are you serious?

265
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,679
Absolutely sure.

266
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,519
So, will you marry me?

267
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,919
I think your plan is great.

268
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,879
So, does that mean you’ll marry me?

269
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:53,639
Auntie

270
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:12,480
Auntie

271
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:14,639
Are you here to see Xu Xin?

272
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,039
She’s not here.

273
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:20,120
I’m here to see you.

274
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:23,960
Have a seat.

275
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,840
I’ll get some water.

276
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,320
Please leave Xu Xin.

277
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,399
I’ve told you all along,

278
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,559
I don’t want you two to be together.

279
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,159
I’ve told you many times too.

280
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:39,360
Look at you two.

281
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,720
What kind of place are you living in now?

282
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:44,679
Auntie,

283
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:46,519
This is only temporary.

284
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,120
I’ll rely on my own abilities.

285
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,600
We’ll move to a better place soon.

286
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,879
How long will that take?

287
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:53,399
Can you wait? Can she wait?

288
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:55,200
Auntie,

289
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:57,240
Xu Xin and I truly love each other.

290
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:59,080
I’ll love her for my whole life.

291
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,120
Yes.

292
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,759
I believe what you say.

293
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:06,200
I’ve seen plenty of kids like you.

294
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,720
Here’s a card.

295
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:17,000
Consider it support for your career.

296
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,960
I can’t accept it.

297
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:21,960
Aren’t you going to ask how much is on it?

298
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,599
It’s not about the money.

299
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,000
I’ll rely on myself.

300
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
And what do you have?

301
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,279
She gave up her career for you.

302
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:29,920
She gave up the chance to go abroad.

303
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:31,119
She’s given up so much.

304
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:32,160
And what did she get in return?

305
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:34,559
Auntie,

306
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,400
Please give me a chance.

307
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:37,160
Please.

308
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:38,480
Auntie,

309
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,160
Don’t touch me.

310
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,799
I’m begging you, please leave Xu Xin.

311
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:43,720
I’m begging you.

312
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:44,680
Please, I’m begging you.

313
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:46,960
Please, just leave our family alone.

314
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,759
Please.

315
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:57,000
I’m begging you.

316
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,640
I will never leave Xu Xin.

317
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,720
I’ll never let you two be together, not even if it kills me.

318
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:05,799
Lu Ming.

319
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,799
Xu Ran.

320
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,720
It really is you.

321
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:12,519
Long time no see.

322
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,480
How many years has it been?

323
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:14,960
Yeah, no wonder you looked so familiar.

324
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,480
It’s been a long time.

325
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:16,160
Come, have a seat.

326
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,480
How have you been lately?

327
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:19,759
Just busy with work stuff.

328
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,440
I remember after you graduated high school,

329
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:23,519
you applied to an art school.

330
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,079
You must be an artist now, right?

331
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,480
Not really.

332
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,920
I just do some creative work.

333
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,400
You’re being modest.

334
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,039
You were so talented in art back in school.

335
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:33,640
And I remember you won a lot of awards.

336
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,279
I remember the teachers all said

337
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:37,000
you’d definitely become a great artist one day.

338
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,279
Do you remember that?

339
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,400
So many girls at school admired you.

340
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,839
Even I was jealous of you.

341
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,359
So what’s your big project now?

342
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,720
Just some installation art pieces.

343
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:50,599
Lu Ming.

344
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:51,400
As for me,

345
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,400
I’ve been working on some business lately.

346
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,160
If you ever need anything,

347
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,119
you can always come to me.

348
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,599
Come on,

349
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:57,319
let’s add each other as friends.

350
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:58,359
Sure.

351
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,359
Here.

352
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:00,960
You scan my code.

353
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,920
What did Auntie say?

354
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:17,160
My mom said she never wants to talk to me again.

355
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,839
But I believe

356
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:24,640
she’ll accept us in the end.

357
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,759
Let’s take care of each other from now on, Mr. Lu.

358
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:41,759
Let’s look after each other from now on.

359
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,119
Mrs. Lu.

360
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:09,319
Boss,

361
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:12,160
we only sold one painting this month.

362
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:13,759
Mr. Lu,

363
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,400
let me put it this way.

364
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,240
Your works are too refined for the general public.

365
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:21,480
Could you maybe create

366
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,640
some pieces that are more popular with the public?

367
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:25,519
Like realistic portraits of beautiful women,

368
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,920
or maybe some landscapes.

369
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:30,519
Thanks for your suggestion,

370
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:32,720
but I’d like to stick to my own style.

371
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,160
What do you mean?

372
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,920
Why cancel the art exhibition after promising it?

373
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,000
It hasn’t even started yet.

374
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,279
How do you know it’ll lose money?

375
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,559
Do you know how much I put into this piece?

376
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:45,880
I haven’t slept or eaten properly every day.

377
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:47,680
I’ve worked so hard on this piece for so long.

378
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:48,920
Almost a whole year.

379
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,720
Do you know that?

380
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,279
Goodbye, everyone.

381
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,920
Goodbye, teacher.

382
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:25,839
Let's go.

383
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,960
Goodbye, teacher. Bye!

384
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,400
Come on, say goodbye to the teacher.

385
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:42,839
Lu Ming.

386
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,839
We’re old classmates.

387
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:46,640
I’ll get straight to the point.

388
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,279
I’ve seen some of your work.

389
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,960
I really like it.

390
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:54,400
So I suddenly had a great idea.

391
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:56,839
I know some business owners.

392
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,039
They want to invest in

393
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:01,240
things related to the cultural and art industry.

394
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,039
So I thought,

395
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,720
You’re a great artist.

396
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,240
As your agent,

397
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,720
I’ll take you to meet them.

398
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:09,319
Let them invest in you.

399
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,519
No, thanks.

400
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,759
I don’t want my work to be too commercialized.

401
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:13,720
Why not?

402
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,359
My work is my self-expression.

403
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:18,559
What matters to me is the creative process.

404
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,440
If my work becomes commercialized,

405
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,279
I’ll feel uneasy.

406
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,119
And not free.

407
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:23,759
I hope my work

408
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:26,400
can be appreciated by those who truly understand it.

409
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:44,319
Xu Xin.

410
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,680
What happened?

411
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,839
Here’s what happened.

412
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,039
Teacher Xu Xin

413
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,680
fell while practicing dance today.

414
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,119
We took her to the hospital.

415
00:23:58,359 --> 00:24:00,440
The doctor said she injured her bone.

416
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,680
She needs a long period of rest.

417
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,559
Didn’t I tell you before?

418
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,279
You don’t have to work so hard.

419
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,359
I’m fine.

420
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:10,440
It’s just that

421
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,720
for a long time,

422
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,000
I might not be able to dance.

423
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,960
The doctor said I need to rest well.

424
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,400
I can’t get too tired.

425
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,759
Otherwise, it could leave lasting problems.

426
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,079
If there’s nothing else, I’ll go now.

427
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:25,759
Thank you.

428
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:35,640
It’s all my fault.

429
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,279
I made you work so hard.

430
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,079
It’s not your fault.

431
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,400
I was just careless myself.

432
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:44,279
But lately, I might

433
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:45,799
not be able to go to work.

434
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:47,519
Now’s not the time to talk about that.

435
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,200
Just focus on resting.

436
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:50,200
Let me take care of you.

437
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:54,920
We’re husband and wife.

438
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,599
I should take good care of you.

439
00:24:56,759 --> 00:24:58,039
Come on, lift it gently.

440
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:58,839
Careful.

441
00:24:59,079 --> 00:24:59,759
Careful.

442
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,720
You seem to be recovering well lately.

443
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:19,200
Lu Ming.

444
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:21,000
Thank you for taking care of me.

445
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,680
And delaying your work.

446
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,960
What are you talking about?

447
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,640
We’re husband and wife.

448
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,160
We should support each other.

449
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:30,880
And take care of each other.

450
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:35,279
Once I recover from this injury,

451
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,559
I’ll go back to the dance studio.

452
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,720
Then you can focus on your art.

453
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:41,880
Just get better first.

454
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:46,960
By the way,

455
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,880
Is our financial situation

456
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,000
a bit tight lately?

457
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:52,759
Not at all.

458
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:55,279
I just sold a painting today.

459
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,440
It sold for quite a lot.

460
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,400
Don’t worry.

461
00:25:58,039 --> 00:25:58,759
Really?

462
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,000
That’s great!

463
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,039
I believe things will keep getting better for us.

464
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,920
They’ll definitely get better.

465
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,319
For sure.

466
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,720
I’ll take this call.

467
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:25,480
Sorry to keep you waiting.

468
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:28,240
Mr. Ma, you’re here.

469
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:29,319
Mr. Ma.

470
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:33,440
This must be Teacher Lu, right?

471
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:34,720
Let me introduce you.

472
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,640
This is Lu Ming.

473
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:38,599
A renowned installation artist.

474
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:40,680
He’s also a future world-class master.

475
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:41,759
And he’s my classmate.

476
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:45,079
And this is the famous Mr. Ma.

477
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:47,440
The Warren Buffett of art investment.

478
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:49,480
He’s also the most insightful investor.

479
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,720
That’s all just reputation.

480
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,559
I simply love art.

481
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:55,200
Hello, Mr. Ma.

482
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,559
Teacher Lu.

483
00:26:58,039 --> 00:26:59,400
I’m glad to meet you.

484
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,519
Teacher Lu.

485
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:06,680
Come, have a seat.

486
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,720
What have you been working on lately?

487
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:11,519
Recently, I’ve been creating

488
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:12,519
pieces inspired by personal reflections.

489
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:14,319
And exploring the value of emotional details.

490
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,559
Installation art, right?

491
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,559
Like putting a urinal in a public space?

492
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,000
That kind of thing?

493
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:21,279
I get it.

494
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:22,119
Teacher Lu.

495
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:23,359
Your work,

496
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:24,759
it’s interesting,

497
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:27,160
but personally,

498
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,119
I have some thoughts.

499
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,240
Just take it as feedback.

500
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,559
Go ahead, Mr. Ma.

501
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,480
His work

502
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:36,279
lacks a bit of topicality.

503
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,839
Contemporary art,

504
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,680
you have to connect it to current social issues.

505
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,079
That’s how you get people talking.

506
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,279
Hot topics mean

507
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,440
controversy.

508
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:51,960
Whatever’s trending in society,

509
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:53,839
that’s what we create.

510
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,400
Whatever people are anxious about,

511
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:57,599
we amplify that anxiety.

512
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,440
That’s how you get attention.

513
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:02,200
Isn’t that just exploiting public emotion?

514
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,480
Mr. Ma.

515
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:14,279
Eat something, come on.

516
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,440
No one’s touched it yet.

517
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,920
Still too young.

518
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,359
Teacher Lu.

519
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:22,000
Art comes in many different forms.

520
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:24,720
You can’t always do that high art that appeals to few.

521
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:26,279
What’s the value in that?

522
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:28,160
Alright.

523
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,359
If you didn’t like that idea,

524
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,440
we’ll try something else.

525
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,119
You need something with a hook.

526
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,799
For example, in the world,

527
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,599
the biggest installation art piece.

528
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,119
Or an installation combining East and West.

529
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:40,880
That way,

530
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,599
you can create your installation in front of everyone.

531
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:45,000
Finish your artwork,

532
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:46,799
then blow it up.

533
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,319
With one explosion,

534
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,319
it’s all money.

535
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:52,960
Mr. Ma.

536
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:55,039
Didn’t you say you don’t care about money?

537
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,599
It’s good for young people to have pride.

538
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,000
But if we really can’t agree,

539
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:03,160
the door’s right there.

540
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:06,599
Mr. Ma.

541
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,279
Lu Ming didn’t mean that.

542
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,119
Come on.

543
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:10,480
Lu Ming and I will toast to you.

544
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,400
Lu Ming.

545
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,160
Come on, together.

546
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,440
I’ve always regretted

547
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,839
not being able to travel back to Van Gogh’s era

548
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:28,319
and give him some funding.

549
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,519
So he could freely express his talent.

550
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,079
So he wouldn’t have died poor.

551
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:38,680
Come on.

552
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,920
Good thing Van Gogh never met you.

553
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,960
If he had met you,

554
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:48,160
his sunflowers might've turned into money trees.

555
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,920
and his ear might've been covered in gold.

556
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:53,079
Get as far away as you can.

557
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:55,920
Mr. Ma.

558
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,720
Please don't mind him.

559
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:59,279
I don't know what's up with him today.

560
00:29:59,279 --> 00:29:59,960
I'll go check on him.

561
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,720
I'll be right back.

562
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:03,079
Lu.

563
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:04,119
Lu.

564
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,039
What are you doing?

565
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:08,759
Let's go.

566
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:09,519
Come back with me.

567
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,799
Apologize to Mr. Ma.

568
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:11,880
Why should I apologize to him?

569
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,440
He's just a businessman pretending to be artistic.

570
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,640
He'll ruin art. Shut up.

571
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:15,920
Let me ask you.

572
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,519
Do you want a normal life,

573
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,079
or do you want the art you pursue?

574
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,480
If you want a normal life,

575
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:22,599
your work isn't art at all.

576
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,640
It's just another product in the market.

577
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,000
And you're just a worker.

578
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:27,240
If you want art,

579
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,680
can your living conditions

580
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,400
really support your art?

581
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,960
If an artist sadly passes away,

582
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:36,599
their art still lives on.

583
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:38,240
I won't compromise.

584
00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:40,119
Lu.

585
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:48,640
Lu Ming.

586
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,680
Wait a second.

587
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:55,079
I'm pregnant.

588
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,559
Xu Xin.

589
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,160
The baby's name—

590
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,680
We can decide after they're born.

591
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:21,759
Do you have a nickname in mind now?

592
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:45,000
Let's call

593
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:46,440
them Xiao Tangyuan.
