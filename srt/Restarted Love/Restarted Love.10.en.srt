1
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,159
Some books,

2
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:17,040
when I read them,

3
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,120
can fill me with many dreams.

4
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:23,519
Everyone here has read many classics.

5
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:25,799
Many of you have your own thoughts.

6
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,879
Who would like to share their insights?

7
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:33,959
Xu Xin,

8
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,120
I think we've all heard your opinions enough.

9
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:38,680
Let's have someone else speak.

10
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,640
You, over there.

11
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,959
Your name is Lu Ming, right?

12
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:47,680
Yes.

13
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:48,560
Pay attention in class.

14
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:59,120
People often chase power, wealth, and fame.

15
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,200
But the main character

16
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:03,519
taught me a different set of values.

17
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,480
Come, take a look at this.

18
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,439
I get it now.

19
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:07,920
Butterflies in my stomach.

20
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,919
Better not let them flutter at the wrong time.

21
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,120
What are you talking about?

22
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,240
I bet you're thinking right now,

23
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,840
what Teacher Zhong's zodiac sign is.

24
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,719
Scorpio or Aquarius?

25
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:21,719
I'm not!

26
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,840
That guy is really nice.

27
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,719
He comes here every day.

28
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:30,120
What's his name?

29
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,639
I've seen his signature.

30
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:32,599
His name is Lu Ming.

31
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,240
Lu Ming.

32
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:50,280
After art history class today,

33
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,879
Chen Fei confessed to me.

34
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:56,120
Xiao Yi,

35
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:58,080
I remember you told me

36
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,199
you hadn't dated before college.

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,560
So you should be careful with relationships.

38
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,800
You're our best friend.

39
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:08,960
We can't just watch you walk into danger.

40
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,759
I'll think about it carefully.

41
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:36,520
Sorry,

42
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,400
for taking up a few minutes of your time.

43
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,080
Xiao Yi,

44
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,039
be my girlfriend.

45
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,919
Together! Together! Together!

46
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,319
Why does this girl look so much like you?

47
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,280
It's not just similar, it's me.

48
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,800
Lu Ming.

49
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:10,240
Student,

50
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,639
your name is Lu Ming, right?

51
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:13,680
Yes.

52
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,360
Do you know what you did is illegal?

53
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:16,639
Sorry,

54
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,040
I sincerely apologize to you here.

55
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:19,959
I'm sorry.

56
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,360
Is an apology all there is?

57
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:22,560
Xu Xin,

58
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,759
do you have a moment?

59
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,439
I'd like to talk with you.

60
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:28,279
About the work you submitted last time.

61
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:29,920
Sure.

62
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:31,759
Let's talk when we have time.

63
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:48,040
Xu Xin

64
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,519
Do you know why I asked you to come here?

65
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,160
Why?

66
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,240
The novella you gave me last time—

67
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,319
I’ve read it.

68
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:00,279
So, what did you think?

69
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,240
I think it’s excellent.

70
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,680
I really liked it.

71
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,040
In all these years,

72
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,040
it’s the best student work I’ve ever read.

73
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:13,360
No,

74
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:15,360
I shouldn’t even call it a student work.

75
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,319
I think it can already compare

76
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,759
with the works of many top writers out there.

77
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:22,439
Do you really think so?

78
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:24,160
I truly do.

79
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,319
You know,

80
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:28,360
I especially loved the part about the mother-daughter relationship.

81
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,839
The daughter keeps trying to break free from her mother’s control.

82
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,399
But the mother,

83
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,399
she’s not

84
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,160
a complete villain.

85
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,439
She struggles inside.

86
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:38,959
She’s conflicted and in pain.

87
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,600
That’s human nature.

88
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,160
A good literary work must explore human nature.

89
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,680
That’s what makes it real and vivid.

90
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:47,240
And also,

91
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,839
the open ending at the end—

92
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,639
It’s like we were thinking the same thing.

93
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,279
Xu Xin

94
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,839
I think

95
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:58,639
you already have

96
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,519
the potential to be a professional writer.

97
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:06,040
What’s wrong?

98
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,240
But I’m a dance major.

99
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,240
I’ve been learning dance since I was little.

100
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,959
My mom also hopes I’ll make a living from dance.

101
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,519
Xu Xin

102
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,839
Don’t live your life for other people’s expectations.

103
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,720
You have your own path to follow.

104
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:24,240
Be brave.

105
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:33,120
I’m sorry.

106
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,279
Xu Xin

107
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:26,839
Xiao Yi

108
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,639
I really didn't mean to.

109
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,199
I just love you too much.

110
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,079
That's why I thought

111
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:32,600
you might be involved with that jerk.

112
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:34,199
So I wanted to check your phone.

113
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:34,959
You wouldn't let me see it.

114
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:35,879
That's why I lost control.

115
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:38,279
I'm worse than an animal.

116
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,800
Jerk.

117
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:41,319
From now on,

118
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,519
stay away from me.

119
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,560
Xiao Yi

120
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:45,439
Ignore this loser. Let's go.

121
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,199
Xiao Yi, Xiao Yi!

122
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,399
I'm sorry.

123
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:51,879
I promise.

124
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,639
I promise I won't hurt you again.

125
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:57,120
Hurting you hurts me ten thousand times more.

126
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,240
Chen Fei

127
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,879
Xiao Yi, Chen Fei, what are you doing?

128
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:01,639
Let go of me.

129
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:03,759
Let go! What are you doing?

130
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,319
Chen Fei, I've really had enough.

131
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:10,079
Please stay away from my friends.

132
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,040
It's completely over between us.

133
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:14,800
Xiao Yi, don't blame me. I'm telling you,

134
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,720
if you come near me or my life again,

135
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,879
don't blame me for calling the police.

136
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,600
I didn't mean it, Xiao Yi.

137
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,959
Xiao Yi, I didn't mean it.

138
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,800
Xiao Yi

139
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:23,319
Xiao Yi

140
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:33,879
Xu Xin

141
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,440
What's wrong?

142
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:48,000
Why didn't you answer my call?

143
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:58,120
I really lost control that time.

144
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,039
It was against professional ethics as a teacher.

145
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,399
I sincerely apologize to you.

146
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,720
Teacher Zhong

147
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,080
I've always respected you deeply.

148
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,159
I've admired you.

149
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,559
Of all the elective courses,

150
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:12,159
yours is the only one I never miss.

151
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:14,200
Every book you recommend,

152
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,159
I read carefully.

153
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:19,320
Xu Xin

154
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:20,480
Really.

155
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:22,480
Of all the students I've taught,

156
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,600
you're the most gifted.

157
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,519
That's why I lost my head that day.

158
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,080
If you can't get over it,

159
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,840
you can report me to the school.

160
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,639
File a complaint against me.

161
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:33,960
I'll accept whatever comes.

162
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:37,279
Teacher Zhong

163
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,720
I won't report you.

164
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,480
About this matter,

165
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,039
let's keep it a secret between us.

166
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:04,919
Xu Xin

167
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,720
Did you have a good day today?

168
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:38,759
Xu Xin

169
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,200
Now that you've graduated,

170
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,519
we're no longer teacher and student.

171
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:47,440
I hope you can accept my love.

172
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:53,759
Xu Xin

173
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,879
I don't want you to have to work in public after we're together.

174
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,360
You won't need to show yourself at work anymore.

175
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,600
I will make you

176
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,320
the happiest woman in the world.

177
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:35,720
Miss,

178
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,120
Are you looking for a book?

179
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,159
I can help you.

180
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:39,200
Xu Xin.

181
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,240
I found it.

182
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:50,360
How are you?

183
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:51,600
Did you find anything you like?

184
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:53,759
No.

185
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,519
Then let's go.

186
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:24,600
Lu Ming.

187
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,000
Long time no see.

188
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:29,840
Are you here to buy books too?

189
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:35,279
We live nearby.

190
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:36,879
Xu Xin.

191
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:38,240
I remember back in college,

192
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,840
you and Lu Ming were good friends.

193
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,600
Right?

194
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,720
It's been a long time now

195
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,559
since you last talked, hasn't it?

196
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,120
As far as I remember,

197
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,600
Lu Ming didn't come to our wedding.

198
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,320
Yeah.

199
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:02,440
You didn't invite me either.

200
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,120
My fault, my fault.

201
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:07,960
I was too busy as a teacher.

202
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,559
I overlooked it.

203
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,399
Don't take it personally.

204
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,000
Lu Ming.

205
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,879
I remember in college,

206
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,240
you majored in art.

207
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:15,840
So is your current job

208
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:17,600
still related to your major?

209
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:19,559
Teacher Zhong still remembers me.

210
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,080
Of course I do.

211
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,399
You were a good student in my eyes.

212
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,879
How's your job now?

213
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,759
Is it going well?

214
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:29,399
No need for you to worry, Teacher Zhong.

215
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,279
Are you married?

216
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:32,840
Teacher Zhong.

217
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,240
Lu Ming must be busy.

218
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,559
Let's not bother him.

219
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:37,960
Alright.

220
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,159
We'll get going then.

221
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:43,120
Let's have tea together sometime.

222
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,919
You still call him Teacher Zhong?

223
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,000
After all these years?

224
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,440
Xu Xin is used to calling me that.

225
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,720
After all, I was your teacher.

226
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,559
Since you knew you were her teacher,

227
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,240
why did you get involved with her back then?

228
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,080
Lu Ming.

229
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:07,000
Lu Ming.

230
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:11,080
Xu Xin and I truly loved each other back then.

231
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,679
Even though we were teacher and student at school,

232
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,600
we're still just ordinary people.

233
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:17,799
I don't want our love

234
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,440
to be defined by a label.

235
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:20,600
Shut up, Zhong.

236
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:22,279
You might fool Xu Xin,

237
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:23,240
but you can't fool everyone.

238
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,600
You've always abused your position

239
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,480
to take advantage of students.

240
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,399
You're not worthy of being a teacher.

241
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,840
Lu Ming, stop it.

242
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,840
You're still defending him?

243
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:32,080
What he did to you back then was harassment.

244
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,720
I'm telling you, he's a hypocrite.

245
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:37,480
Don't talk about my husband like that.

246
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,360
We're very happy together.

247
00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:58,600
Let's go, Teacher Zhong.

248
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,240
Even if you don't understand our love,

249
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,080
I hope you can be more rational.

250
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,840
We truly love each other.

251
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:11,919
Let's go.

252
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:20,840
Xu Xin

253
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:22,879
My two students have arrived.

254
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:12,880
Miss Xu

255
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,160
What about you?

256
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,079
The most important thing now is to relax your mind.

257
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,160
Let go of your guard against everyone.

258
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,720
Then, follow my treatment plan.

259
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:24,240
We'll take it step by step.

260
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,160
I believe you'll get better.

261
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,359
Thank you, Dr. Xu.

262
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:34,039
You're welcome.

263
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:36,880
Miss Xu, I am a doctor.

264
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:39,519
But Dr. Xu,

265
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,319
When did you become a doctor?

266
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,160
Miss Xu

267
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,440
I don't know what you're talking about.

268
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,440
Aren't you Lu Ming's partner?

269
00:17:57,319 --> 00:17:59,079
Haven't you been helping him sell art?

270
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,559
Would any student like to share

271
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:26,759
a classic they've read?

272
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:28,680
I suppose

273
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,000
everyone has different opinions.

274
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:33,880
Xu Xin

275
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,319
Everyone's tired of hearing your sharing.

276
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:37,759
Let's have someone else.

277
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:39,960
This student here,

278
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,599
I remember your name is Lu Ming, right?

279
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:44,599
Yes.

280
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,440
This marriage brought the male lead

281
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,759
both physical and emotional torment.

282
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,519
It's a personal tragedy and a tragedy of the era.

283
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:57,000
I actually agree with you on that.

284
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,440
I really agree with your idea.

285
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,680
I agree with your view.

286
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
But regarding this

287
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:10,519
marriage doomed to destruction,

288
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,680
both of them are victims.

289
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,480
Xu Xin made a good point just now.

290
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,400
So how can we avoid

291
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,839
such tragedies?

292
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:19,519
The simplest way

293
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:22,680
is to learn from the classics.

294
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,000
So how do we learn from them?

295
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,599
First, what we need to do

296
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:30,160
is pay attention in class.

297
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,799
What are you doing?

298
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,599
Stop filming.

299
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,279
Sorry, sorry.

300
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,640
Sorry to take up a few minutes of your time.

301
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,200
Xiao Yi

302
00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:19,119
Please give me a chance.

303
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:21,519
Let me love you.

304
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:25,960
Nonsense.

305
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,119
Secretly filming is bad enough,

306
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,799
but now you're making a scene

307
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:31,839
coming here to confess your love.

308
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,319
I sent my child here to study

309
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,079
because of your school's faculty and reputation.

310
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,640
I didn't expect

311
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:39,880
you'd produce

312
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,319
so many unruly students.

313
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,160
And you even fell in love with her.

314
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:44,799
Do you know what love is?

315
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,799
Do you understand what love means?

316
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,319
Can you take responsibility for her?

317
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:50,079
Does this have anything to do with you?

318
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,079
Of course it does.

319
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:52,799
I'm the parent.

320
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:54,519
Her parents aren't here.

321
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,960
I'm her guardian.

322
00:20:58,519 --> 00:20:59,160
Come home with me.

323
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,440
I won't let my child stay in a school like this.

324
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,839
What kind of school is this?

325
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:11,880
That kid looks polite enough,

326
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,720
but he's always filming you.

327
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:14,680
What is he up to?

328
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:16,039
Mom,

329
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:18,519
It's normal for people to take photos at an art performance.

330
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:19,640
Aren't you overthinking this?

331
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:22,119
Has he ever been to the National Centre for the Performing Arts?

332
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,839
Has he ever been to the People's Theatre?

333
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:25,200
Can you just film anywhere you want?

334
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,119
And that public confession,

335
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,799
none of the teachers present

336
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:31,400
even tried to stop it.

337
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,839
We're all college students now.

338
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,279
College students are still students.

339
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,960
If teachers don't stop it, they're encouraging it.

340
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,759
No, I have to withdraw you from school.

341
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:45,839
I'll handle the paperwork next week.

342
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,920
Mom, I've already studied here for three years.

343
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,759
I only have one year left before graduation.

344
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:52,519
If I drop out now,

345
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,799
where can I go?

346
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,960
Fine, you don't have to drop out.

347
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:00,079
Then come back home to live.

348
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:01,519
I'll have someone pick you up and drop you off every day.

349
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:03,680
Do we really have to do this?

350
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,599
I'm not discussing this with you.

351
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,119
Either come home,

352
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,279
or drop out.

353
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,160
You choose.

354
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,079
Xiao Yi, I'm sorry.

355
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:58,200
I really didn't mean it.

356
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,039
It's just that I love you so much.

357
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:00,920
That's why I thought

358
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,559
you might be involved with that jerk.

359
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:45,079
Xin Xin, get up!

360
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,720
Today is your graduation day.

361
00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:48,680
Hurry up!

362
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:56,279
I graduated.

363
00:23:57,599 --> 00:23:58,200
That's right.

364
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:04,599
Mom.

365
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,839
I want to continue studying dance.

366
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,920
Now that you've graduated, my job is done.

367
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,160
The rest of my job

368
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,079
is to find you a good family to marry into.

369
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,240
Get married?

370
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:17,960
Exactly.

371
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:20,440
While you're young, you have more choices.

372
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,279
Plus, your mom knows a lot of people.

373
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,960
I'll definitely find you a good match.

374
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,359
Don't worry.

375
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:26,680
I've been looking out for you.

376
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:39,920
Today's blind date is someone important.

377
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,039
He's the eldest son of the Zheng family.

378
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,480
His father owns a factory.

379
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:44,880
They're worth billions.

380
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:46,839
Because you're beautiful,

381
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:48,839
he really liked you after seeing your photo.

382
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,519
So the meeting was arranged right away.

383
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,839
Even though our family is decent,

384
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,200
compared to them,

385
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:55,759
we really pale in comparison.

386
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,160
So make sure you do well later.

387
00:24:58,799 --> 00:24:59,920
If this works out,

388
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:01,759
you'll never have to worry for generations.

389
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,599
Understand?

390
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:05,720
Would you like something to drink?

391
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,880
Two lattes to start.

392
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,440
We'll order the rest later.

393
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,440
Okay.

394
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,519
Stop talking about useless things.

395
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:14,519
Touch up your makeup quickly.

396
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,599
He's coming soon.

397
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,119
Alright, I know. I'll stop talking.

398
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,000
Aunt Zhang.

399
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,319
I'm really sorry.

400
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,160
I was late because of work.

401
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,359
You must be Miss Xu Xin.

402
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:35,640
You're even more beautiful in person.

403
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,799
Let me introduce myself.

404
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:37,720
My name is Zheng Zhi.

405
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,519
Hello, nice to meet you.

406
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,039
I was just talking with Mr. Zhang from Tianyuan Tech.

407
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:43,000
We were discussing a project.

408
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,640
He insisted I invest.

409
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,720
That's why I was delayed.

410
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:49,559
Let's sit and talk.

411
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,400
Please, sit.

412
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:53,960
Zheng,

413
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:55,759
what project did you discuss today?

414
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:57,279
Artificial intelligence.

415
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,200
It's the most cutting-edge technology now.

416
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,920
That's impressive.

417
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,680
It's nothing, really.

418
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,279
I can't be Elon Musk,

419
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,160
but I aim

420
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,160
to have someone from my company

421
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,200
become the next Elon Musk.

422
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:10,359
The future looks bright.

423
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:12,160
Whoever marries you

424
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,680
will be truly blessed.

425
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,680
Auntie, you're too kind.

426
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:16,359
With such a beautiful daughter,

427
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,839
if I could marry Miss Xu,

428
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:21,119
that would be a blessing of a lifetime.

429
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,000
Mr. Zheng, I heard you love reading.

430
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,960
Xin Xin loves reading too.

431
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:28,880
Looks like you have something in common.

432
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,559
What do you usually read, Mr. Zheng?

433
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,920
Biographies of Buffett.

434
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:35,680
Because Buffett is my idol.

435
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:36,880
Is that so?

436
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Right, Xin?

437
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:05,759
Xin?

438
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,359
Yes, that's right.

439
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,240
Yes.

440
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:11,720
Miss Xu, have you studied dance before?

441
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:15,880
No wonder you have such great poise and presence.

442
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:16,680
How about this—

443
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,559
I'm hosting a party at my house tonight.

444
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,119
Miss Xu, would you dance for us?

445
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:23,039
I'm sure you'll amaze everyone.

446
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:23,799
Thank you.

447
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,039
I don't think that's necessary.

448
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,119
That's great!

449
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,160
Don't worry.

450
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,960
Xin Xin will definitely do her best.

451
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,640
Right?

452
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,759
Where's Xu Xin?

453
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,519
I just called.

454
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:56,640
She said something came up.

455
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,559
She'll be here soon.

456
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,599
Let's not wait any longer.

457
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,480
Mr. Zheng,

458
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:04,519
Your wife has to be here.

459
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:05,920
Let's wait a bit more.

460
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:10,359
Since Mr. Wang said so,

461
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:11,960
let's wait a little longer.

462
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,559
Sorry I'm late.

463
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,759
What could be more important than dinner?

464
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:22,559
I had something urgent.

465
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,039
Sorry about that.

466
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,759
Mr. Zheng, we've all had a round.

467
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:30,240
Should your wife have a penalty drink?

468
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:33,319
A penalty drink.

469
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,079
That's no fun.

470
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:37,359
Xu Xin is my wife.

471
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:39,400
She's a great dancer.

472
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,680
How about this?

473
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:44,000
I'll have her dance for everyone.

474
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:45,480
To liven things up.

475
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,319
Sounds good.

476
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:54,079
But my outfit isn't suitable today.

477
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,279
Xin Xin, you were already late.

478
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,920
Don't spoil the mood.

479
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,920
Alright.

480
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,079
Xu Xin

481
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:15,960
Xu Xin

482
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:18,759
Xu Xin

483
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:22,759
Xu Xin, what are you thinking about?

484
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:35,119
Mom

485
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,559
There's something I want to tell you.

486
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,319
Go ahead.

487
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,160
Zheng Zhi talked to me a few days ago.

488
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:46,079
He said

489
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,880
he wants to have a child.

490
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:51,160
Isn't that a good thing?

491
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,960
But what if I don't want one?

492
00:30:56,519 --> 00:30:57,359
Let me tell you,

493
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,559
as a woman,

494
00:30:58,559 --> 00:30:59,519
if you don't have a child,

495
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:00,960
you're not a complete woman.

496
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,200
I think Zheng Zhi's idea is pretty good.

497
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:04,759
You should hurry up and get ready.

498
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:07,160
That's for later.

499
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,640
Let's talk about tomorrow first.

500
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,200
Tomorrow, you must

501
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,519
dress up nicely for me.

502
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,079
Your sister is coming to see us.

503
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:17,000
Sister?

504
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,440
Since when do I have a sister?

505
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,200
I'm mad at her.

506
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,359
You're still mad at her?

507
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:27,400
I think she won't come alone.

508
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,680
She'll definitely bring that annoying Lu Ming with her.

509
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:31,000
Seriously...

510
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,079
Lu Ming

511
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,440
Who is my sister?

512
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,960
Your sister is Xu Xin.

513
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,599
Then who am I?

514
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,160
Silly girl.

515
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,200
You're Xu Xin.

516
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,319
I don't have a sister.

517
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,720
I...

518
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,039
I don't want to see Xu Xin.

519
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:20,759
I don't want to see Xu Xin.

520
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,039
I don't want to see Xu Xin.

521
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:26,799
I don't want to see Xu Xin.

522
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:28,920
I don't want to see, I don't want to see Xu Xin.

523
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:29,720
Xu Xin

524
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:31,440
Xu Xin, what's wrong?

525
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,200
Xu Xin

526
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,279
Can you hear us talking?

527
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:10,359
Can you hear us talking?

528
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:11,160
Xu Xin

529
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,400
Hold on a little longer.

530
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,359
Don't leave us.

531
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,279
Don't come over here.

532
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,000
Xu Xin

533
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,759
Don't come over here.

534
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:17,799
Xu Xin

535
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:18,440
Don't come over here.
