1
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,519
What's wrong?

2
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,519
Did you have a nightmare?

3
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:25,799
Xixi.

4
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,599
I had a terrible nightmare.

5
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:31,079
Don't worry.

6
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:32,040
It was just a dream.

7
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,079
It's all over now.

8
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,400
I'm here.

9
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,439
You're safe.

10
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,599
I remember who you are.

11
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,840
You're the wife of that famous artist.

12
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,439
Right?

13
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,479
You've got the wrong person.

14
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:14,319
No, that's not right.

15
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,240
I'm sure I'm not mistaken.

16
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:16,719
Your husband is Lu Ming.

17
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:18,199
He's a handsome artist.

18
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,520
I've seen news about you two.

19
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,000
They said you divorced because of relationship issues.

20
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,560
So it's all just marketing.

21
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,639
The perfect power couple image.

22
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,719
So did you actually get divorced?

23
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,560
I saw online that it was your fault.

24
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:33,840
So was it you or him who cheated?

25
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:35,560
Tell me about it.

26
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:36,719
What are you doing?

27
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,759
I'm just chatting normally.

28
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:42,759
Does she look like she wants to talk to you?

29
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:49,400
Don't pay attention to her.

30
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:50,360
Are you okay?

31
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:51,360
I'm fine.

32
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:54,240
What happened to your hand?

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,039
She startled me just now.

34
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:57,080
I accidentally scratched it.

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,319
Heavy rain pours down.

36
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:10,800
The street nearby is lit up.

37
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:13,599
She curiously looks at everything in front of her.

38
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:17,879
Suddenly, she spots a girl in a red dress.

39
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,560
Curled up not far away.

40
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:21,080
Her hair is soaking wet.

41
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,800
I remember you love watching the sunset.

42
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:36,319
Back when we weren't married yet,

43
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,280
we often waited quietly for the sunset together.

44
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:45,520
But I've forgotten

45
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:48,960
the last time

46
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:51,120
we waited like this until evening.

47
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:05,199
You seem distracted today.

48
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:08,879
Not really.

49
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,879
Xixi,

50
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,000
do you think

51
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,040
believing you have a mission in this world

52
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,959
is a silly thing?

53
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,360
Is it foolish?

54
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,759
What do you mean?

55
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:28,639
Lately, I keep feeling

56
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:31,360
like I've forgotten

57
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,319
to do something really important.

58
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:36,680
You do have something important to do.

59
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,079
You know,

60
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:39,600
your novel—

61
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,480
haven't you stopped writing lately?

62
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,279
When will you finish it and let me read?

63
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,639
I'm really looking forward to it.

64
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,399
That might be true.

65
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:48,519
You're just too absorbed

66
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:49,959
in your own novel world.

67
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:51,160
Thinking about all sorts of things.

68
00:04:58,759 --> 00:04:59,879
Actually, today

69
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,360
that girl Sasha said some

70
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,279
really strange things to me.

71
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:04,959
Just ignore that girl, okay?

72
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,399
But it's fine,

73
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,600
she already left today.

74
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:09,560
She left?

75
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,240
When did that happen?

76
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:12,959
She just left.

77
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:17,319
But she was still here earlier today.

78
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,639
Now it's finally peaceful.

79
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,199
Who are you?

80
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:45,360
I'm Lu Ming.

81
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,040
No, you're not.

82
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,519
But sometimes,

83
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,399
I am.

84
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,920
Why are you here?

85
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:59,199
I was wrong before.

86
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,000
Can we start over?

87
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,839
Go back.

88
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,879
I don't want to.

89
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,480
Everything I do

90
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,079
is for you.

91
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,800
You can't leave me like this.

92
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,079
Why won't you let me go?

93
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:20,959
I've already told you.

94
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,680
I don't want to live with you.

95
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:23,879
Xu Xin.

96
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,560
I'm your husband.

97
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,639
I'm the one who loves you most.

98
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,800
You can't treat me like this.

99
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,600
But I'm not your possession.

100
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:34,959
I have the right to choose my own life.

101
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:35,920
You can't control me.

102
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,959
I'm not trying to control you.

103
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,480
I'm doing this for a better life for us.

104
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,439
But this isn't the life I want.

105
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,160
I want freedom.

106
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,160
I want space.

107
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,560
I don't want to be tied down by you.

108
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,439
I'm tying you down?

109
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:48,360
Did you forget?

110
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:51,839
Who provides for this family?

111
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:54,480
And did you forget?

112
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,920
Who takes care of you?

113
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,120
I haven't forgotten.

114
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,600
But that doesn't mean I should lose myself.

115
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,680
Xu Xin.

116
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,439
You're too selfish.

117
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:09,160
You don't care about my feelings at all.

118
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:11,199
Have you ever considered my feelings?

119
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,199
You're always self-centered.

120
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,399
You never listen to what I think.

121
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,560
I don't need to fight for your suggestions.

122
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:20,519
Because everything I've done for you

123
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:22,839
is for your own good.

124
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:23,680
No.

125
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,560
You don't know.

126
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:30,279
You only care about yourself.

127
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,839
All I know is that I love you.

128
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:35,439
Xu Xin.

129
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,680
Let's go home.

130
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,279
I'm willing to change.

131
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,000
I'll do anything for you.

132
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,399
Let's go home.

133
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:47,199
Okay?

134
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:50,759
Lu Ming.

135
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,279
Stop using love to manipulate Xu Xin.

136
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,000
That's not love at all.

137
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:56,879
You just can't let go of your own sacrifices.

138
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,160
The only person you love is yourself.

139
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:00,120
With me here,

140
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:03,160
I won't let you hurt Xu Xin again.

141
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,600
Mr. Lu.

142
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:29,199
Mr. Lu.

143
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,959
Xu Xin's vital signs

144
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:32,519
are getting more stable.

145
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:35,919
I think soon

146
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,080
she'll wake up.

147
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,120
You can spend more time with her.

148
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,200
I read novels to her every day now.

149
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,440
I hope she'll wake up soon.

150
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,360
Talk to her more.

151
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,279
It helps patients regain consciousness sooner.

152
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:52,279
Thank you.

153
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:04,919
Brother-in-law.

154
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,360
Mom.

155
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:10,879
Brother-in-law is here.

156
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,919
Please leave.

157
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,320
I don't want to see you.

158
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:21,279
Aunt.

159
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,399
I have something to tell you.

160
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,039
It's about Xu Xin.

161
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,600
The doctor said while Xu Xin is in a coma,

162
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:31,279
she can still hear outside voices.

163
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,000
If familiar people visit her,

164
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:35,159
and talk with her,

165
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,000
maybe a miracle will happen.

166
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,279
Aunt

167
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:47,840
I apologize to you.

168
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:49,840
I'm sorry.

169
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,279
Back then, I was young and impulsive.

170
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:55,559
I acted stubbornly.

171
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:57,240
I made a lot of mistakes.

172
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,799
Including not listening to your advice.

173
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:02,279
But Xu Xin is innocent.

174
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,320
Does saying this to me now change anything?

175
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,919
Isn't her situation now all because of you?

176
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:11,440
Mom

177
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,360
I came here this time

178
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,080
hoping you would visit Xu Xin.

179
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,200
I'm willing to do anything you ask.

180
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,200
Fine.

181
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:25,759
Isn't this why you came here?

182
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:27,320
Now I understand.

183
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,279
You can leave now.

184
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,559
Every step Xu Xin took

185
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,799
was her own choice.

186
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,919
Including marrying you.

187
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,159
So the way she is now

188
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,120
is also her own doing.

189
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,919
I won't go see her.

190
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,559
Mom

191
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,000
Don't say that.

192
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,200
Brother-in-law, you should go back first.

193
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,399
I'll try to talk to Mom.

194
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:10,559
Thank you.

195
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:22,600
Mom

196
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:52,440
I accidentally got scratched.

197
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:02,159
Xu Xin

198
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:03,879
I'm planning to go to town.

199
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,120
Let me go with you.

200
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,120
You just got out of the hospital.

201
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,200
Stay here and rest a bit longer.

202
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:14,360
Xu Xin, you have to trust me.

203
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,799
I just don't want you to be in danger.

204
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,559
Please wait here for me.

205
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,480
Okay?

206
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,639
Sir

207
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,360
Excuse me, how much longer until we reach town?

208
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:49,559
Not far.

209
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:50,559
It's just ahead.

210
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:57,799
Sir, why has it taken so long?

211
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:58,720
We're still in the mountains.

212
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,679
When will we get to town?

213
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:01,679
We're almost there.

214
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,000
Sir

215
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,279
I don't need to go to town anymore.

216
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:11,080
Please stop the car.

217
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,320
I want to get out.

218
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:53,799
Have you ever thought about leaving here?

219
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,960
Do you remember how you got here?

220
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,960
Reality is a sickness.

221
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,320
Illusion is the cure.

222
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,399
Xin Xin,

223
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,320
Mom is here to see you.

224
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:31,159
Can you hear me?

225
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,279
Mom, don't cry.

226
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:50,080
She'll be okay.

227
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,559
She's awake.

228
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,720
Xixi.

229
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:22,039
What happened to me?

230
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,000
Maybe you were just too tired.

231
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,039
When I came back, you were already asleep.

232
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:27,759
No.

233
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,159
That's not right.

234
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:34,360
I remember I wanted to go to the market.

235
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:36,799
Why do you want to leave here?

236
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,879
I told you it's not safe outside.

237
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:44,960
But I realized I can't leave this place at all.

238
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,120
Where is the market, really?

239
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,200
Does this place even exist?

240
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,639
Maybe you just got lost.

241
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,120
No, that's not it.

242
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:57,519
Xixi.

243
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:00,039
Where am I, really?

244
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,200
Why are you lying to me?

245
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,720
What is this place, really?

246
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,080
What are you talking about?

247
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,399
Have you written so many novels that you've lost your mind?

248
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,919
I thought about it carefully.

249
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,960
Everything I've experienced since I got here

250
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:18,200
feels so unreal.

251
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,240
Everyone I've met here

252
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:23,240
doesn't seem real.

253
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,879
And everything that happens here

254
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:28,320
Let's go back.

255
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,120
all seem to be reminding me of something.

256
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,799
You're overthinking it.

257
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,840
How much business do we actually do?

258
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,360
I've never seen you take any money.

259
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,159
A lot.

260
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,440
Why is there a guesthouse here

261
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,600
in a place like this?

262
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,919
This isn't a tourist spot.

263
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,720
Xu Xin, you're just too tired.

264
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,879
What are you really hiding from me?

265
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,320
I'm not hiding anything.

266
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:58,039
How long have you been hiding here?

267
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:01,480
Haven't you ever thought about leaving?

268
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,680
Xu Xin, are you okay?

269
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,559
Is there anything else you can't tell me?

270
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:09,559
Xu Xin.

271
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:11,079
Stop overthinking things.

272
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:11,880
Don't worry.

273
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,400
I'm not hiding anything.

274
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,000
Xixi, please tell me.

275
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:16,480
Tell you what?

276
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,759
All of this.

277
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:20,599
Why is all this happening?

278
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,279
You're my best friend.

279
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:25,119
I would never hurt you.

280
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,799
It's wonderful here.

281
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:30,799
But here,

282
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,920
it's so perfect, it doesn't feel real.

283
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:35,240
I can't get hurt here.

284
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:37,720
I don't feel any pain.

285
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,839
There's no sadness or suffering here.

286
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,160
Only happiness and joy.

287
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,000
But this isn't real.

288
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:56,759
Is it?

289
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,400
Xu Xin, stop talking.

290
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,039
Is this my dream?

291
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:04,000
The real me

292
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,480
is still lying in a hospital bed, isn't she?

293
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,000
I want to leave.

294
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,799
Don't you want to

295
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,160
keep living here?

296
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,279
Xu Xin.

297
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,599
If you've really decided to leave,

298
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:39,759
I respect your choice.

299
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,359
And we

300
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,960
will always have your back.

301
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:48,160
Xixi.

302
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,519
Thank you.

303
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,559
No matter what's outside that door,

304
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:59,079
I have to face it.

305
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,160
All her vital signs are stable.

306
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,240
Did Dr. Lou give any other instructions?

307
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:42,640
Xu Xin.

308
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,720
Go get the doctor, quick.

309
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,799
Xu Xin

310
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:34,839
As I write this letter,

311
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,079
while I'm writing to you,

312
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,279
the doctor told me

313
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:42,119
your brain activity is becoming more active

314
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,319
and you could wake up at any moment.

315
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,680
I used to think that when you woke up,

316
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:51,000
seeing me by your bedside

317
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,079
would be a good thing.

318
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,319
But after reading your novel,

319
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,400
I no longer feel that way.

320
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,480
Now, I hope even more

321
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:03,200
that your return this time

322
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,920
will be a true new beginning.

323
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,880
So I left this letter and the divorce papers

324
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,200
by your bedside.

325
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:16,480
In your novel,

326
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:18,160
the heroine faces

327
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,759
her husband bound inside a glass tank

328
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,559
and the killer standing before her,

329
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:24,119
not knowing what to do.

330
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:27,160
Yuan You, the root of all this tragedy,

331
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:29,400
is also lost in confusion.

332
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:32,640
Xu Xin,

333
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,279
when I read to this point in your novel,

334
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:37,119
I wanted to write

335
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:39,039
the ending I believe this story deserves.

336
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,440
It may not be what you imagined,

337
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,160
but maybe it can be a reference.

338
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:49,640
Yuan You looks at Xu Xin,

339
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:51,839
seeing in her eyes

340
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:53,319
the reflection of his own monstrous self.

341
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:55,160
He suddenly understands something.

342
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,720
His so-called love for Xu Xin

343
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:01,079
was a shackle trapping them both.

344
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:02,000
A heavy chain.

345
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,680
Within this chain,

346
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,759
Yuan You gradually became

347
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:08,519
a monster he no longer recognized.

348
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,839
Both he and Lu Ming

349
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,480
used the excuse of sacrifice

350
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,000
to control the woman they claimed to love.

351
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,519
Yuan You realizes

352
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:25,200
he has destroyed with his own hands

353
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:28,400
everything he once longed and hoped for.

354
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:31,559
Since nothing can be undone,

355
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:34,799
at least for the one he loved all his life,

356
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:36,839
there is still one thing he can do.

357
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,720
The only thing left he can do.

358
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,599
Inside the glass tank,

359
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:07,119
Yuan You takes one last look at Xu Xin,

360
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:28,079
then disappears without a trace,

361
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:30,599
as if

362
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:34,200
he had never existed in this world at all.

363
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:57,359
Lu Ming,

364
00:25:58,559 --> 00:25:59,960
Since I woke up,

365
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,519
it's been over a year.

366
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,160
City of Lies has been published.

367
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:09,359
It uses the ending you wrote for me.

368
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,480
A lot has happened during this time.

369
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:17,640
I went to see my mother.

370
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,599
She's changed a lot.

371
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:31,559
I also met

372
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,240
an old friend I hadn't seen in years.

373
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,200
After graduation, she went abroad for a few years.

374
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,319
Now she's back too.

375
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,279
It's like we're back in our college days.

376
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:48,119
Xiao Yi finally left Chen Fei.

377
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,880
I don't know where to send this letter

378
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,920
or where it should go.

379
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,599
I also don't know

380
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,079
if you'll ever receive it.

381
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:13,400
But I still want to write down

382
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,400
what I wish I could say to you.

383
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:18,160
Lu Ming,

384
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,440
I think you misunderstood one thing.

385
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,359
In the novel, Xu Xin's life

386
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:33,799
doesn't become better just because Lu Ming disappears.

387
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,559
It doesn't magically turn out well.

388
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:30,039
No matter what path her life takes,

389
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,119
if she can't live as her true self,

390
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:37,400
and break free from dependence on others,

391
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,799
then she will never

392
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:42,160
be able to find

393
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,920
her own inner peace.

394
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:11,720
Love is only one part of life,

395
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,359
but it's also irreplaceable.

396
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,920
Maybe someday, somewhere,

397
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,160
those meant to meet

398
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,119
will cross paths again.

399
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,559
Renowned artist Lu Ming

400
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:49,359
ended his marriage

401
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:52,240
and ended his partnership with Xu Ran.

402
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,799
Sources say

403
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:55,480
he has closed his studio

404
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,279
and is working on a new series

405
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:58,880
of installation artworks.

406
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,160
The tentative theme is "Back to Zero."

407
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,200
Recently, the emotional suspense novel

408
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,599
City of Lies was released.

409
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:31,839
Young novelist Xu Xin has entered the public eye.
