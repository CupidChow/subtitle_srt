1
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,760
Xu Xin

2
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:52,319
Xu Xin

3
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:18,319
Lu Ming

4
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,000
What's wrong?

5
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,639
There's a child downstairs at our place.

6
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:22,520
A child?

7
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:34,039
Where did you see him?

8
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,520
He was just here.

9
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,199
The door opened.

10
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,400
The door was locked.

11
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,000
What did you see?

12
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,319
A butterfly.

13
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,639
Miss Xu.

14
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,319
Based on your current condition,

15
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,160
I have enough reason to believe

16
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:50,879
you are experiencing memory distortion.

17
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,079
The car accident caused your brain

18
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:54,279
to suffer serious damage.

19
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,120
It has already affected your daily life.

20
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,319
Like the little boy you just mentioned,

21
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:04,720
he may not actually exist.

22
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,439
But my feelings are very real.

23
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,839
I really did see a little boy.

24
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,079
Did you find any signs of someone breaking into your home?

25
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,959
Dr. Xu,

26
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,560
is there a way for my memory to recover quickly?

27
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:28,040
Everyone hopes for that.

28
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:29,199
But the brain

29
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:31,480
is an extremely complex organ.

30
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,759
It can't simply rely on medication

31
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,480
to recover immediately.

32
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,199
And you don't need to worry.

33
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,480
Your condition is not rare.

34
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,560
There are many cases of recovery.

35
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,839
So, have confidence in my expertise.

36
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,120
And have confidence in yourself.

37
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,480
Let's work together.

38
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,439
Alright?

39
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,000
Dr. Xu, your next patient is here.

40
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,639
Okay.

41
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:58,600
Miss Xu,

42
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,800
if you have any new developments,

43
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,600
you can come to me anytime.

44
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,199
Thank you, Dr. Xu.

45
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:17,279
How have you been lately?

46
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:18,959
Come on, let's sit over here.

47
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,199
I'll take you home first in a bit.

48
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,560
I have an interview afterwards.

49
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:45,279
Unfortunately,

50
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,079
at the opening ceremony,

51
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,120
my wife was by my side.

52
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,759
But there was an accident.

53
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:52,360
She was injured.

54
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,639
She is still recovering.

55
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,639
I will put aside all my work for now

56
00:06:58,639 --> 00:06:59,959
to spend time with her.

57
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,040
Has the investigation into the accident concluded?

58
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:05,480
The driver was fatigued.

59
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:08,040
He paid for it with his life.

60
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:10,519
I hope tragedies like this

61
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:12,480
never happen again.

62
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,480
Let's talk about your new work.

63
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,639
This one is called City of Lies.

64
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,839
Are you trying to say that in your life

65
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,439
there are many lies?

66
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,720
People say marriage is like a fortress.

67
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:36,680
But I think it's like a visual music box.

68
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:39,199
Only those inside

69
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,360
can truly feel it.

70
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:44,360
A music box is a child's toy.

71
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:47,160
Using it as a metaphor for marriage

72
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,680
isn't it too childish?

73
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,759
No matter how you interpret it,

74
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:56,920
at least for me,

75
00:07:58,439 --> 00:07:59,839
marriage is not a game.

76
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:10,680
My wife loves me very much.

77
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:14,759
And I love my wife very much.

78
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:27,519
Ms. Xu, your flowers.

79
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,320
Are you feeling any better?

80
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:44,720
Pretty good.

81
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:47,799
Have you remembered anything?

82
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,039
Just bits and pieces.

83
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,120
Dr. Xu said

84
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:00,960
not to rush.

85
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:04,240
This illness needs time to heal.

86
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,639
By the way, thanks for the flowers.

87
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,679
What?

88
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,279
They're beautiful.

89
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,600
I didn't send you any flowers.

90
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,639
Maybe a friend sent them.

91
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:08,039
You want to buy this novel too?

92
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:10,159
This seems to be the last copy.

93
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:11,960
If you want it, you can have it.

94
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,240
No need, you take it.

95
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,919
If I’m not mistaken,

96
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,360
you were just a bit faster than me.

97
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,120
You touched the book first.

98
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:20,039
Really?

99
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:23,320
Actually, I already have a copy at home.

100
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:25,720
I just wanted another one for my collection.

101
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:29,399
Then I won’t be polite.

102
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:32,759
By the way, could you do me a favor?

103
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,759
Three, two, one.

104
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,000
I think this one looks good. Take a look.

105
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,440
I think it’s great.

106
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:44,399
Thank you.

107
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:45,399
You’re welcome.

108
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:53,840
Hold on to it.

109
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:54,759
Thanks.

110
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,840
Hope to see you here again next time.

111
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,039
Me too.

112
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,240
Bye.

113
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,000
Boss.

114
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:07,600
Was that really

115
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,159
the last copy of The Klein Bottle just now?

116
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:10,759
That was the only one.

117
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:13,200
Alright.

118
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:15,399
Miss,

119
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,279
could you come by again tomorrow?

120
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,360
I’ll get one from the warehouse for you.

121
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,639
Is that too much trouble?

122
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:23,759
Not at all.

123
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:26,320
Not many people buy physical books these days.

124
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:31,279
You have to be accommodating if you want good business.

125
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:33,879
Thank you, boss.

126
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,799
Xu Xin, what's wrong?

127
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:15,480
There's something in the washing machine.

128
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,680
Get some rest early.

129
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:12,480
Hello.

130
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:15,240
Excuse me, the book I ordered yesterday—

131
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,440
Has The Klein Bottle arrived?

132
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,119
What are you talking about?

133
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:21,599
I ordered a book here yesterday.

134
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:22,519
It's called The Klein Bottle.

135
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:24,640
Hold on a moment.

136
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,559
Which book?

137
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,400
The Klein Bottle.

138
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,200
The Klein Bottle.

139
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:35,880
No.

140
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:37,599
Our store has never stocked that book.

141
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,680
Please come back tomorrow.

142
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:41,680
I'll get a copy from the warehouse for you.

143
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,400
But yesterday your manager said—

144
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:47,440
He would get one for me.

145
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,279
The manager doesn't work regular shifts.

146
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,880
I've been the only one on duty since the day before yesterday.

147
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,559
Last night at eight o'clock—

148
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,279
When I came in—

149
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:02,359
There was only one copy left in your store—

150
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:03,559
Just one copy of The Klein Bottle.

151
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,440
But then another girl bought it.

152
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,799
At that time, your manager promised—

153
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:11,359
To get another copy for me.

154
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:12,799
And told me to pick it up today.

155
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,119
You must be mistaken.

156
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,160
From yesterday until now—

157
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,000
I've definitely been the only one working.

158
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:19,319
Besides—

159
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:21,039
You're so pretty—

160
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,400
If you'd been here—

161
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,519
I would definitely remember you.

162
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:27,880
Come, take a look yourself.

163
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,279
We have cameras in every corner of the store.

164
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,079
Look here.

165
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:35,720
Eight o'clock, right?

166
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,160
Here, that's me at the counter.

167
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:37,920
Where are you?

168
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,160
From eight to ten—

169
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:43,799
I'll fast-forward, you can see for yourself.

170
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,480
Can I guess the ending faster than the characters in the book?

171
00:21:56,599 --> 00:21:57,839
Can I figure out the ending sooner?

172
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:00,599
Hope to see you here again next time.

173
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:28,960
Miss Xu.

174
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:30,960
I'm a psychiatrist.

175
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,680
And also a materialist.

176
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:34,839
I don't believe that in this world—

177
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,599
Such things could exist.

178
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,759
Dr. Xu.

179
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:41,519
You still don't believe what I say, do you?

180
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:43,200
Based on your description—

181
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:47,559
I think your memory distortion is getting worse.

182
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,920
Clothes in the washing machine can't just disappear.

183
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:54,160
And the leaked water wouldn't dry up instantly.

184
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,960
If everything you see, hear, and remember—

185
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:00,160
Can't be explained by common sense—

186
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:01,480
Then the only possibility—

187
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:03,720
Is that your brain is deceiving you.

188
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:05,440
So, Miss Xu—

189
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,839
Don't trust what you see.

190
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:43,559
