1
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,560
Where did you go?

2
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,800
It wasn't me who left you.

3
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,280
It was you who left me.

4
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,800
Us.

5
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:19,680
You and Xiao Yi.

6
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:23,280
How do you know Xiao Yi?

7
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,639
Because we've always been together.

8
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,879
Always together.

9
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:34,280
Yes.

10
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,120
Always together.

11
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,120
Always.

12
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:45,000
Together.

13
00:02:59,240 --> 00:02:59,919
What's wrong?

14
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:01,039
Xu Xin.

15
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,080
Look at me.

16
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,240
Xu Xin.

17
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,800
You don't need to be afraid.

18
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,560
No one will hurt you here.

19
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:20,919
I had a nightmare.

20
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:35,159
That's a manifestation of your anxiety.

21
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:36,919
Don't worry about it.

22
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:47,680
I'm sorry.

23
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,719
None of this was supposed to involve you.

24
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,800
Let me handle the rest myself.

25
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:02,919
I told you I'd help you.

26
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,960
I won't leave you.

27
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,279
But I don't want to drag you into this anymore.

28
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,079
Do you still think you're dragging me down?

29
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,600
Get some more sleep.

30
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,399
I'll stay with you.

31
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:02,480
You're awake.

32
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:03,560
Have a seat first.

33
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:08,600
I made breakfast.

34
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:09,560
The conditions are limited.

35
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,160
Thank you.

36
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,240
The eggs are a bit overcooked.

37
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:17,600
It's the way you like them.

38
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,160
How did you know?

39
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,160
I like my eggs a little burnt.

40
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:26,160
You mentioned it casually during therapy.

41
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:41,920
What are your plans next?

42
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,319
I want to go somewhere later.

43
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,639
Yuan You.

44
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,399
I'm scared.

45
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,439
I'm afraid Xixi is like them.

46
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:26,560
Don't worry.

47
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:28,360
I'm here.

48
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:45,160
Is anyone here?

49
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:47,839
Hello.

50
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:49,160
We're not open yet.

51
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:52,839
Do you know Xixi?

52
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:54,680
Yes.

53
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,160
Do you know where she went?

54
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:00,959
Are you her friend?

55
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,639
You probably haven't been in touch for a while, right?

56
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:06,680
Why do you ask?

57
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,439
This bar was opened by me and Xixi's friends

58
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:10,160
together.

59
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,879
But...

60
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:14,639
She passed away two years ago.

61
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,680
Two years ago, we all started this business together.

62
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,480
We opened this bar.

63
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,399
There was a wine tasting event back then.

64
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,199
We all decided to go together.

65
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,600
But Xixi said she wanted to go alone.

66
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,839
I don't know what happened in between.

67
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,480
I only know her car

68
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,080
was rear-ended by a truck.

69
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:36,679
Xixi.

70
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,039
But I couldn't reach you at all.

71
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,519
I changed my phone number.

72
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,440
I'm the person who knows you best in this world.

73
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,360
If you need me,

74
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,960
I'll be by your side right away.

75
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,039
She died two years ago.

76
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,679
We attended the memorial together.

77
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:48,720
All of us went to her funeral.

78
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,360
Everyone was heartbroken.

79
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:52,120
It's been two years.

80
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:03,840
What did you just say?

81
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:08,720
I said I refuse.

82
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,639
Dr. Xu.

83
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:14,320
Say that again.

84
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,919
Everything that's happened to you today

85
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,440
is all your own doing.

86
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,200
What about Xu Xin?

87
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,519
Who will take responsibility for Xu Xin's life?

88
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,000
I really regret doing so many bad things for you.

89
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,399
I won't do it again.

90
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,559
Are you kidding?

91
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:52,279
Don't forget you took the money.

92
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,679
And I have leverage over you.

93
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:55,559
Do as you please.

94
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:00,799
I'll take responsibility for what I should.

95
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I won't run away from it.

96
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,279
Are you sure you want to risk your career?

97
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:12,799
If that day really comes,

98
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:18,000
I'll accept whatever punishment I deserve.

99
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,879
Is there anything else?

100
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,000
If not,

101
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,399
you can leave now.

102
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,039
Dr. Xu.

103
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,360
You'll regret this.

104
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:55,200
Are you sure you want to do this?

105
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,960
I'm wondering if Xixi is just my hallucination.

106
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,159
Those three people who disappeared before,

107
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,440
although I don't know what method Lu Ming used,

108
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:11,440
but after they disappeared,

109
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,399
it's like they never existed in this world.

110
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:16,320
The bar owner also said he saw Xixi.

111
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,240
That proves she really existed.

112
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:21,399
Xixi really is different from them.

113
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:24,399
And Lu Ming said the same thing as the bar owner.

114
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:28,320
But I really saw her.

115
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,879
Even though I don't want to admit it,

116
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:36,679
what happened with Xixi

117
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,120
has made me start to doubt myself.

118
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,120
Am I really sick?

119
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,279
Is everything I'm seeing just an illusion?

120
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,399
Do you really trust me?

121
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,320
Okay.

122
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,080
Let's begin.

123
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:04,759
Close your eyes first.

124
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,159
Relax your body.

125
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:11,000
Follow my rhythm.

126
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,399
Inhale.

127
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:16,960
Exhale.

128
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,039
What do you hear?

129
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,360
Sound of waves

130
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,679
So, what did you remember?

131
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,840
Lu Ming said

132
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,440
his father used to be a fisherman.

133
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,879
For a long time in his childhood,

134
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,080
he lived by the sea.

135
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:49,879
Xu Xin

136
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,840
Now there's a door in front of you.

137
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,360
You approach it.

138
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,799
Open it.

139
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,600
Lu Ming

140
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,559
I can't live like this anymore.

141
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:31,200
Let's separate.

142
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,879
I won't leave you.

143
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,240
Ms. Xu

144
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:54,960
Ms. Xu

145
00:13:57,399 --> 00:13:58,000
Ms. Xu

146
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,440
This is as you requested,

147
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:02,279
the drafted divorce agreement.

148
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,559
Thank you.

149
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,600
Allow me to confirm with you.

150
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,559
Are you sure you want to give up all assets?

151
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,759
According to the law,

152
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,320
you are entitled to half

153
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,519
of the marital property.

154
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:19,360
I'm sure.

155
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:21,879
Ms. Xu

156
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,600
That's a substantial amount.

157
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,639
Your husband is now a well-known artist.

158
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,480
He owns a lot of assets.

159
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,519
Are you really sure you want to give it up?

160
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,000
This is enough.

161
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,440
He earned the money.

162
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:38,320
Let him keep it.

163
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:40,600
Alright, Ms. Xu.

164
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,200
This agreement

165
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,200
will take effect after you and your husband sign it.

166
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,200
It will then be valid.

167
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,399
Fortunately, you two have no children.

168
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:48,960
That makes things much simpler.

169
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:51,399
Yes.

170
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:05,759
Xu Xin

171
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:07,080
Xu Xin

172
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:08,559
Xu Xin

173
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:12,399
Xu Xin

174
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:14,360
Xu Xin

175
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,399
Xu Xin

176
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,440
I divorced Lu Ming.

177
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,960
He used the car accident

178
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,120
to try to make me forget everything.

179
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,080
What happened to your face?

180
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,759
Why are you so late?

181
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,879
This is my new piece that will be exhibited soon.

182
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,080
It's called "Homecoming."

183
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:53,600
It's also related to my wife.

184
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,240
But she's not feeling well today.

185
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:57,799
She couldn't make it.

186
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,639
The inspiration this time is similar to my last work.

187
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,799
Should we take it as a creative block?

188
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:05,120
Are you facing a bottleneck in your work?

189
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,600
I saw your wife not long ago.

190
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:11,759
She was quick-witted.

191
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:12,639
Very sharp-minded.

192
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:14,519
She didn't seem unwell at all.

193
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,000
But the wound on your face looks recent.

194
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,679
Can you tell us what happened?

195
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,840
I just accidentally fell.

196
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:25,399
It's nothing serious.

197
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,919
Time and again,

198
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:31,960
you market yourselves as a loving couple.

199
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,360
But on the other hand,

200
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,240
you keep your wife hidden.

201
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,320
You don't let the public see her.

202
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,320
You really know how to work the market.

203
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,679
And the theme this time is "Homecoming."

204
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:45,759
Does that mean your marriage is in trouble?

205
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,799
Do you need a fresh start?

206
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,600
We've heard a saying,

207
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:53,799
"Marriage is the grave of love."

208
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,240
My wife and I went from passionate love to marriage.

209
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:00,200
To outsiders, it may seem like we've reached the end.

210
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,440
The name of this piece

211
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,680
is about finding, within marriage,

212
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,000
a sense of belonging for my wife and me.

213
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:12,880
That's completely different from what your wife said.

214
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,519
Before your car accident,

215
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,599
your wife had already filed

216
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,960
for divorce in court.

217
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,680
But you took advantage of her amnesia

218
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,839
and tried to keep her living with you

219
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,319
under false pretenses.

220
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,960
That's extremely despicable and shameless.

221
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:31,359
Your marriage is completely broken.

222
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:32,720
Do you have any response?

223
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,200
Ms. Lin,

224
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:38,839
this isn't what we agreed on before.

225
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:39,480
It's different now.

226
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,160
We have to end this interview.

227
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,720
Mr. Lu,

228
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:44,599
have you come up with any ideas?

229
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,440
I'm still thinking.

230
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:51,359
Still thinking.

231
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,160
We're running out of time.

232
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:57,240
If investors don't see results soon,

233
00:17:57,599 --> 00:17:58,720
they'll pull their funding.

234
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:03,599
Will you take the loss or will I?

235
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,039
I have a wife and kids.

236
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,240
I have a family to support.

237
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,240
Have a drink.

238
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,599
It might make you feel better.

239
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:49,759
Thank you.

240
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:58,640
Not many people know about this place.

241
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,240
It's very safe.

242
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,640
Did you build this cabin?

243
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:08,960
Why are you in this forest?

244
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,960
With a place like this?

245
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,519
My father left it to me.

246
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,160
So did your family use to live nearby?

247
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,480
In a small town not far from here.

248
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:22,079
So this is your hometown.

249
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,359
I'm very familiar with it.

250
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:28,799
I really like the forest here.

251
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:31,279
I used to play in the forest a lot as a child.

252
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,160
I always felt calm in the woods.

253
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,759
Some people say

254
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:38,759
time passes very slowly in the forest.

255
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:41,119
So I always enjoyed that time.

256
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:43,640
It felt like time would actually stop.

257
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,039
But that's just an illusion during the day.

258
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,400
At night,

259
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:52,519
the forest shows its true nature.

260
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:56,920
Once, I went to play in the forest

261
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:59,640
and ended up staying until late at night.

262
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,279
It got completely dark.

263
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:02,799
I got lost.

264
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,599
The forest at night is really scary.

265
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:11,160
The darkness feels like it can swallow everything.

266
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:15,440
I still can't forget

267
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,599
the fear I felt back then.

268
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,000
I was really, really scared.

269
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:21,160
But gradually,

270
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,000
I started to enjoy that feeling.

271
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:27,079
It's hard to describe.

272
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,880
Maybe

273
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,880
I was just convincing myself.

274
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,039
To overcome the darkness,

275
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:37,319
you have to become the darkness.

276
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:44,279
Later, my father found me

277
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:46,519
and brought me to this cabin.

278
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,440
He built this cabin in secret.

279
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,720
Even my mother didn't know.

280
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:52,720
He asked me to keep it a secret.

281
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,359
He said every man

282
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:58,160
should have a place of his own.

283
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,559
So after that,

284
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:02,799
this became our secret base.

285
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:04,640
We used to come here often.

286
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,720
Fishing, exploring, hunting.

287
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,839
Your childhood sounds pretty interesting.

288
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:16,279
What about you?

289
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,559
How was your childhood?

290
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:26,119
My parents met through a matchmaker.

291
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,839
They didn't have much back then.

292
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,000
Our family wasn't well-off.

293
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,599
But my mother was very smart.

294
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,720
With her help,

295
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,880
my father started a business.

296
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,359
After that, our situation

297
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,680
kept getting better.

298
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,000
But just when everything

299
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,400
was going well,

300
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:54,240
my father started neglecting his work.

301
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,839
Then they got divorced.

302
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,599
My mother insisted on raising me herself.

303
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,839
My father abandoned us.

304
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:11,039
After that,

305
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,559
he disappeared completely.

306
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,880
My father's leaving was a huge blow to my mother.

307
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:21,759
Raising me alone,

308
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:24,160
she became more and more irritable.

309
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:25,920
Since I was little,

310
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,400
I had to obey my mother's strict rules.

311
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,880
Under her supervision,

312
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,200
I had to do everything perfectly.

313
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:38,400
Everything I did

314
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:42,119
needed her approval.

315
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,599
But I still ended up with Lu Ming.

316
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:48,240
After I told my mother,

317
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,079
she was furious.

318
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,559
She even locked me in my room.

319
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:56,960
She even yelled at me,

320
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,880
saying I was unworthy to be her daughter.

321
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:08,799
But in the end,

322
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,319
I still chose to marry Lu Ming.

323
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:13,359
After that,

324
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:15,680
my mother never contacted me again.

325
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,319
Sometimes I wonder

326
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,799
maybe my mother was right.

327
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,440
If I had listened to her back then,

328
00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:29,599
would things be different now?

329
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,640
What kind of life would I be living?

330
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,920
Maybe all along,

331
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,759
I never really understood Lu Ming.

332
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:42,680
Everyone has secrets in their heart.

333
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,119
Just like my father said,

334
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:47,759
everyone should have

335
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:49,880
a little cabin in their heart.

336
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:50,880
Don't you think?

337
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:02,359
Then your father

338
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:04,079
why did he build this cabin?

339
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,359
Did he have secrets too?

340
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:09,519
My dad loved hunting.

341
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,720
He often took me with him when I was little.

342
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,759
But mostly,

343
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,279
it was just pheasants and rabbits.

344
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:17,960
But once,

345
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:19,400
we caught

346
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,920
a really huge wild boar.

347
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,640
We brought it here to butcher.

348
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,480
He was just an ordinary man.

349
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,559
He had a happy family.

350
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,240
Living in a pleasant countryside.

351
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,400
But he needed a place to let off steam too.

352
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,480
I think Lu Ming is the same.

353
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:49,759
So in your cabin,

354
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:51,160
what do you have?

355
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,880
It's just a regular cabin.

356
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:15,839
You still have the mood to drink?

357
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:16,960
Do you know

358
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:19,200
our investors are about to pull out?

359
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:21,880
Several investors have already drafted contracts

360
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:23,359
to sue you for breach of contract.

361
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,160
That article is fake.

362
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:27,400
Who cares if it's real or not?

363
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:28,559
Netizens think it's true.

364
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:29,559
So it's true.

365
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,559
Give me a little more time.

366
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:33,480
I know who wrote it.

367
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:36,000
I'll get her to take it down.

368
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,480
Even if you take the article down now,

369
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,400
public opinion can't be reversed.

370
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,079
Go talk to them again.

371
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,920
I've made them so much money.

372
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:47,880
The investors said

373
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,680
they can accept an artist's work

374
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,039
even if the market response is poor,

375
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,440
right? Even losing money.

376
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,440
But they absolutely won't accept

377
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:56,559
an artist accused of misconduct.

378
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,400
Mr. Lu,

379
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,279
I can't work with you anymore.

380
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:02,079
If I keep working with you,

381
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:04,839
all my resources will be swallowed by this incident.

382
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,440
Is there no other way?

383
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,599
There is.

384
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:10,640
What about Xu Xin?

385
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:11,839
I've already arranged the reporters.

386
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,160
Even if she's dead,

387
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,720
you have to cry over her body for me.

388
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:16,440
You...

389
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,640
Say that about Xu Xin again,

390
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,440
and you'll be the first to go.

391
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,200
Get out.

392
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,200
Your wife has already filed

393
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,599
for divorce in court.

394
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:40,000
Your marriage is completely broken.

395
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,720
Is this what you call effort?

396
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,880
Effort to weave a perfect lie.

397
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:54,400
Xu Xin.

398
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:56,519
Xu Xin.

399
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,200
I brought you some water.

400
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,240
Yuan You.

401
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:34,000
If it weren't for you,

402
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,559
I might still be doubting myself.

403
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:39,559
Maybe I wouldn't even know who I am anymore.

404
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:35,880
Yuan You

405
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:41,480
Yuan You

406
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,440
Why are you still awake?

407
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,799
Are you heading out?

408
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:48,519
The welfare home called.

409
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,720
A child has a fever.

410
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,680
I need to go back.

411
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,599
Then get some rest early.

412
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:55,720
Okay
