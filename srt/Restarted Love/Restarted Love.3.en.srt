1
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,359
I believe everyone here

2
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:17,760
has, since childhood, whether from books

3
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:19,599
the stage, or the big screen,

4
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,799
been exposed to many classic masterpieces.

5
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,959
And you all have different perspectives.

6
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:26,400
Who would like to share their thoughts?

7
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,640
I’m sure everyone

8
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,400
is tired of hearing Xu Xin’s opinions.

9
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:34,840
This student here,

10
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,680
I remember your name is Lu Ming, right?

11
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:39,799
Yes.

12
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:41,200
Please share your view.

13
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,120
I really like the female protagonist

14
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:46,159
as portrayed in this story.

15
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,239
I also appreciate the core of the story.

16
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,680
Only two independent souls

17
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,359
are worthy of love.

18
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:58,799
But I have a different perspective.

19
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,560
From the story’s point of view,

20
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,200
it is indeed a romance novel.

21
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,040
But from the female protagonist’s perspective,

22
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:07,959
it’s actually a horror story.

23
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,280
From the author’s perspective,

24
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,000
we can see the male protagonist

25
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,520
struggling within the marriage.

26
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:15,639
In this marriage,

27
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,759
both his body and soul are hurt.

28
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,240
This is a personal tragedy.

29
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:23,240
It’s also a tragedy of the times.

30
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:26,199
I do agree with that.

31
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:28,000
However,

32
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,560
in this marriage doomed to tragedy,

33
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:32,000
both are victims.

34
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:34,479
The male protagonist has forever lost

35
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:36,120
the chance to see the world again.

36
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:38,879
And his wife has lost even more—everything.

37
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:41,960
I hope such tragedies never happen again.

38
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,719
Why does this girl look so much like you?

39
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,159
It's not just similar. That's actually me.

40
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,479
Lu Ming.

41
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:40,400
I remember now.

42
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,240
He's the guy from Professor Zhong's class

43
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,840
who discussed novels with you.

44
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,000
You know him?

45
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:47,400
He's a top student at the art academy.

46
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,879
He hasn't even graduated and he's already won many awards.

47
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,080
You're probably the only one who doesn't know him.

48
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,520
Did you know he used your image for this?

49
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,479
Isn't that going too far?

50
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:04,680
Hey, classmate.

51
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,560
You're Lu Ming, right?

52
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,479
Yes.

53
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,120
Do you realize what you did is illegal?

54
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,439
Sorry, I sent you an email.

55
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:16,879
But you didn't reply.

56
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,240
What email?

57
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,360
Even if you sent me an email,

58
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,000
without my permission,

59
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,560
using my image without consent

60
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,480
is still not okay.

61
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,279
This is my fault.

62
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:37,560
I'm sorry.

63
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,279
Is just apologizing enough?

64
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:43,759
You should at least treat me to a meal.

65
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,480
Wouldn't that show you're sincere?

66
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,439
So,

67
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,560
why did you

68
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,800
put me in your work?

69
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,680
My teacher told me

70
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,759
inspiration comes in a flash.

71
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,600
At the time, I didn't know why

72
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:05,040
I wanted to capture you.

73
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,920
Next time, let me know in advance.

74
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:14,439
Dinner?

75
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:16,000
Sure.

76
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:06,519
You're up.

77
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:10,240
I made you breakfast.

78
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:15,000
Did you have a nightmare last night?

79
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,839
It's nothing.

80
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,600
Okay.

81
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,920
Lu Ming.

82
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,839
I want to find time to visit Professor Zhong again.

83
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,519
Professor Zhong.

84
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,920
The one who taught us in college.

85
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:40,399
Why do you want to see him?

86
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:43,360
We're meeting Professor Zhong today.

87
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,040
We haven't seen him much since graduation.

88
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,360
We set this up a few days ago.

89
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,839
I know this sounds strange.

90
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:59,399
But I want to see him again.

91
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,360
Let's wait until I have time.

92
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:15,480
You came alone? Where's your wife?

93
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,959
Dr. Xu, let's get straight to the point.

94
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,959
Xu Xin has started to remember

95
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:23,279
some things from before.

96
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,560
Didn't you promise me

97
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,079
you could stop all this from happening?

98
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,680
I told you

99
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,879
this takes time.

100
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:46,720
Why are you doing this?

101
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:48,240
What's your reason?

102
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:56,920
Do you think you love her?

103
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:00,240
In this world,

104
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,800
no one could love her more than I do.

105
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,240
We're meeting Professor Zhong today.

106
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,759
We haven't seen him much since graduation.

107
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:16,160
Xiao Lu.

108
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,800
We arranged this a few days ago.

109
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,240
The one who taught us in college.

110
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,279
Why do you want to see him?

111
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,200
Who are you looking for?

112
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,720
Excuse me, is Professor Zhong home?

113
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,000
You have the wrong place.

114
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:08,120
Wait.

115
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:10,279
But I was just here yesterday.

116
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,679
I've lived here for five years.

117
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:29,919
Hello.

118
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,720
Do you know where Yuan You is?

119
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:36,600
He's over there.

120
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,320
Xiao Tangyuan.

121
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,320
Are you drawing?

122
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,759
Looks like you really do come here often.

123
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:10,080
So should we...

124
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:13,159
talk about what happened that night?

125
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,519
So who was that man that night?

126
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:20,679
Why did he do that to you?

127
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,919
It's none of your business.

128
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,840
Then what do you want to talk to me about?

129
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:02,799
Xiao Tangyuan

130
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,279
Why did you draw this?

131
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:07,759
Did you see something?

132
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:48,960
Xu Xin

133
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,519
Why are you here?

134
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,320
I came to take you home.

135
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:02,720
How did you know I was here?

136
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,840
Did you forget?

137
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,240
I have your location on my phone.

138
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,720
If I can't find you,

139
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,480
it tells me where you are.

140
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,039
When did you install this for me?

141
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,519
You asked me to install it.

142
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,240
You told me

143
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,639
it would make you safer when you're out.

144
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:25,600
This was before the accident.

145
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,240
You might not remember.

146
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,039
I don't remember.

147
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,919
But I think

148
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,639
I wouldn't have let you install something like that.

149
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:43,840
I don't want this.

150
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,159
Please uninstall it for me.

151
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:45,799
Xu Xin

152
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:47,039
Please uninstall it right now.

153
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:47,840
What's wrong?

154
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:55,639
I remember you.

155
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,440
We met at the psychology clinic, right?

156
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,240
Xu Xin

157
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,600
Is this your friend?

158
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,519
My name is Yuan You.

159
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,480
She often comes here to see the kids.

160
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,919
That's why I recognize her.

161
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,440
Xu Xin

162
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,919
Let's go home.

163
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,679
Don't go to that welfare home anymore.

164
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,000
Lu Ming, you just don't understand.

165
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,120
I can't explain it to you.

166
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,799
I really saw someone get killed.

167
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:31,919
It's all in your imagination.

168
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:34,320
No, this isn't a hallucination.

169
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,039
Xiao Tangyuan's drawing.

170
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:36,759
Xu Xin.

171
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Stop using your fantasies as an excuse.

172
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,080
Don't think I don't know you went to the welfare home.

173
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:52,840
I know what you're really doing there.

174
00:14:58,759 --> 00:14:59,799
What are you talking about?

175
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:08,840
That male caregiver.

176
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,559
When he stands next to you,

177
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:15,080
I feel like an outsider.

178
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:26,279
Lu Ming.

179
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:30,159
Why would you think that?

180
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:34,679
Let's eat.

181
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,679
I can't eat anymore.

182
00:15:58,559 --> 00:15:59,519
Then don't eat.

183
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:02,360
From now on,

184
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:04,639
don't go to the welfare home anymore.

185
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,200
Hello.

186
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:51,440
I'm Lin Qing, a reporter from Art Digest.

187
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:52,880
You're Lu Ming's wife.

188
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:56,440
My husband isn't home today.

189
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:58,279
Maybe you could come another day.

190
00:17:58,799 --> 00:17:59,759
I'm not here for him.

191
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,160
I'm here specifically to see you.

192
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:03,599
Reporter Lin.

193
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,119
Please have some tea.

194
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:07,680
Thank you. Just call me Lin Qing.

195
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,319
I'll start recording now.

196
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:15,799
My husband isn't home.

197
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,279
I'm not sure what I can say.

198
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,160
Actually, this is my first time talking to a reporter.

199
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,000
It's okay, don't be so nervous.

200
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:27,359
Let's just have a casual chat.

201
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:31,000
At your husband's recent exhibition closing,

202
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,480
I heard you were supposed to attend.

203
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:34,079
But you weren't feeling well,

204
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,480
so you couldn't make it, right?

205
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,000
I was in a car accident not long ago.

206
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:46,079
So my memory is still a bit confused.

207
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:50,279
And I'm afraid going out would trouble him.

208
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:52,720
You mentioned confusion.

209
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,079
Does that mean between you two,

210
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:56,960
some unpleasant things from before,

211
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,240
you've forgotten them all?

212
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:00,400
Unpleasant?

213
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,319
Sorry.

214
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,680
I really have forgotten a lot.

215
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:15,720
It's actually not so bad.

216
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,200
Many people try hard to forget things,

217
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,480
but you forgot because of the accident.

218
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,279
I guess it's a blessing in disguise.

219
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,000
So, the unpleasantness you mentioned,

220
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,119
were you referring to something specific?

221
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,440
No, I just meant unpleasantness in general.

222
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,680
In married life, between husband and wife,

223
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:38,359
it's normal to have some friction.

224
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,279
Come on.

225
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:00,279
Keep drawing.

226
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,599
Xiao Tangyuan's condition has greatly improved.

227
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,440
Thank you.

228
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,039
You give the children free sessions every week.

229
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:15,880
You provide psychological therapy.

230
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,799
They really like you.

231
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:17,759
You're welcome.

232
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:20,279
Being able to use what I've learned

233
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,519
to help these children

234
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:22,799
feels very meaningful to me.

235
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:25,880
Mr. Yuan is very caring.

236
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,640
He looks after so many children every day.

237
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:28,759
It's really hard work.

238
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,200
It's just physical labor.

239
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,720
Mr. Yuan seems to know a lot about psychology.

240
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,079
He has deep expertise as well.

241
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:41,880
You're not an ordinary caregiver.

242
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:44,440
Taking care of so many children at the welfare center

243
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,359
and doing it so well

244
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:47,200
is no easy task.

245
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,160
So I started looking into Mr. Yuan.

246
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:53,519
I did some research.

247
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,079
I found out that Mr. Yuan

248
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:57,559
was once half a colleague of mine.

249
00:20:58,279 --> 00:20:59,440
But why is he now

250
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,559
just a regular caregiver?

251
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,839
Mr. Yuan, please don't misunderstand.

252
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,519
I'm just curious.

253
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,240
Maybe Mr. Yuan

254
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,440
has secrets he can't talk about.

255
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:20,920
Xiao Tangyuan.

256
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,279
Let's go.

257
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,160
Come on.

258
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:24,400
So after the accident,

259
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,279
you really forgot a lot of things.

260
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:30,039
My recent memories are a bit blurry.

261
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,359
But I remember earlier memories more clearly.

262
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,680
Sometimes I wonder,

263
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,519
if I hadn't met him back then,

264
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,240
what would things be like now?

265
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,880
Who knows?

266
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:48,000
Maybe we’d still be pursuing dance together.

267
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:50,680
Maybe working at some training center,

268
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,960
teaching kids.

269
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:03,200
Hey, Lu Ming.

270
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:17,440
Where is this?

271
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,400
Weren’t you coming to see Professor Zhong?

272
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,640
I asked classmates who still keep in touch with him.

273
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,799
He lives here.

274
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:32,440
Isn’t Professor Zhong’s home in Building Four?

275
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:33,799
What are you talking about?

276
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,559
Let’s go.

277
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:06,559
Lu Ming

278
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,359
Come in

279
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:40,960
Have a seat.

280
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,000
Okay.

281
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:47,920
Lu Ming, even though I'm just an adjunct teacher,

282
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:49,240
I didn't teach you many classes.

283
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:52,440
But you've always left a deep impression on me.

284
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:54,519
I've always thought

285
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:56,759
you would achieve great things in the future.

286
00:24:57,359 --> 00:24:58,680
And I was right.

287
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,960
Now you're already a renowned artist.

288
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,480
And you still respect your teachers so much.

289
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:05,640
You even came to visit me.

290
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:07,839
Thank you both.

291
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,799
You're too kind, Professor Zhong.

292
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:13,920
Professor Zhong,

293
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:18,799
I didn't expect you'd changed so much.

294
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:21,200
Well, I've gotten old.

295
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,440
No one can escape the passage of time.

296
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,119
But I'm doing fine.

297
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,400
I still have these old friends to keep me company.

298
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:33,519
Xu Xin, I remember you as well.

299
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:35,119
You attended quite a few of my classes too.

300
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,799
Professor Zhong, may I ask you something?

301
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,000
Where is your wife?

302
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,680
I'm all alone.

303
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:56,640
In the end, I chose not to get married.

304
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,279
I think being alone is just fine.

305
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:02,160
But...

306
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:08,799
I heard you married a much younger woman.

307
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:13,359
Her name is...

308
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,799
Xiao Ya.

309
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,519
You must have heard wrong.

310
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:23,920
Lu Ming,

311
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,880
Seeing you and Xu Xin so happy now,

312
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,240
I'm truly happy for you.

313
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:31,920
I think your relationship is as solid as a rock,

314
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:33,440
and will last a thousand years.

315
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:37,720
Thank you, Professor Zhong.

316
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,160
Seeing how carefree you are now,

317
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,200
I'm happy for you too.

318
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,400
It seems those things from back then

319
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,400
no longer affect you.

320
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:52,640
What things?

321
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:55,759
The past is best left unspoken.

322
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:56,599
Professor Zhong,

323
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,960
I actually think that incident

324
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:00,640
must have had more to it.

325
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:03,880
A teacher as principled as you,

326
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:05,519
how could you possibly have

327
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:06,960
an improper relationship with a female student?

328
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,839
Back then, a female student pursued me.

329
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:14,160
I refused her.

330
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,599
But then she turned it around on me.

331
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,519
She told the school I was the one pursuing her.

332
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:21,279
Just that trivial matter.

333
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:24,240
The school really didn't get the facts straight.

334
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:26,079
It was clearly the girl's fault.

335
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,119
Why were you the one punished?

336
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,119
Can we not talk about this anymore?

337
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,920
Sorry, Professor Zhong.

338
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,319
It's just so nice to see you.

339
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:39,759
I spoke too much.

340
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,200
Please forgive me.

341
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,960
Yes, I should be more forgiving.

342
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:50,440
Young people today really do respect their teachers.

343
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:52,839
You came to see me, but brought nothing.

344
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,839
We actually wanted to bring a gift.

345
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,200
But we were in a rush.

346
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,480
Professor Zhong, how about this—

347
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:05,160
Let me transfer you some money as a token of thanks.

348
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:06,839
What are you saying?

349
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:07,799
Lu Ming,

350
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:11,279
Do you want to...

351
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,079
I really don't understand

352
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:43,279
why you want to find this person.

353
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:45,880
And about Xiaoya you just mentioned,

354
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,319
what exactly happened with that?

355
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:51,599
How about we go see Dr. Xu?

356
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:53,079
You don't understand anything at all.

357
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:55,440
What's wrong?

358
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,200
You should go home first.

359
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,599
I want to walk alone for a while.

360
00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:06,839
I can go with you.

361
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:07,759
No need.

362
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,359
I just need some time alone.

363
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:15,599
Okay.

364
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:45,880
Do you still remember Professor Zhong?

365
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,160
Why bring him up?

366
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:50,720
Today,

367
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:53,400
I met him.

368
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,119
How is he doing?

369
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:58,559
Not well.

370
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:01,200
Because of misconduct.

371
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,319
How do you know?

372
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:07,759
I've known for a long time that he's not a good person.

373
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:10,559
I heard about it when I first started college.

374
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:11,799
He pursued one of our senior classmates.

375
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,720
It's said that he even harassed someone.

376
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:17,400
It just wasn't exposed.

377
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,200
Back then, I really couldn't tell.

378
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,319
Xu Xin, you're too kind.

379
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,000
The world is dangerous.

380
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,039
You must be cautious of everyone around you.

381
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,880
I might really be sick.
