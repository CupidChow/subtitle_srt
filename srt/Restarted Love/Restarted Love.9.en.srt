1
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:11,879
I once read a

2
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:13,159
classic feminist novel.

3
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:15,359
I really liked the way the heroine was portrayed.

4
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,040
I also liked the core of the story.

5
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,959
Only two independent souls

6
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:21,640
are truly worthy of love.

7
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:24,439
I've read the novel you mentioned.

8
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:26,560
But I have a completely different perspective.

9
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:28,760
From the story's point of view,

10
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,719
it is indeed a romance novel.

11
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,959
But from the heroine's perspective,

12
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,040
it's actually a horror story.

13
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,959
From the author's viewpoint,

14
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:39,920
we can see

15
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,400
the male lead's struggle in marriage.

16
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:42,760
This marriage

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
brought both physical and emotional

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,719
pain to the male lead.

19
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,719
It's a personal

20
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,239
and a tragedy of our times.

21
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,079
I agree with your view.

22
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:52,439
However,

23
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:53,599
when it comes to this

24
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:55,480
marriage doomed to fail,

25
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,439
both of them are victims.

26
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,359
The male lead has forever lost

27
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:02,120
the chance to see the world again.

28
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,920
And his wife has lost even more—everything.

29
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,879
I hope such tragedies never happen again.

30
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,439
You two,

31
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,080
why don't you come up and share?

32
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,360
I'll take a break.

33
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,039
Xu Xin's presentation was quite good.

34
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,599
So how can we

35
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,240
avoid such tragedies?

36
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,520
The simplest way

37
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,479
is to learn from the classics.

38
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:32,840
So how do we learn those lessons?

39
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,759
First, we need to pay attention in class.

40
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,400
People often chase power, wealth, and fame.

41
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,639
But the heroine

42
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,960
taught me a different set of values.

43
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,840
Come, take a look here.

44
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,159
Don't fall for someone casually.

45
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:56,560
What are you talking about?

46
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:59,120
I bet you're thinking right now,

47
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,960
what zodiac sign is Teacher Zhong?

48
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:04,439
Is he a Scorpio or an Aquarius?

49
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:05,879
That's not what I'm thinking.

50
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,599
Go back and read the book carefully.

51
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:11,319
Hi there.

52
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:14,360
Can I talk to you for a moment?

53
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,879
Thank you, Teacher Zhong. I'll leave now.

54
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:24,919
Xu Xin.

55
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:25,879
Good morning.

56
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,479
Do you know me?

57
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:29,919
See you later, Xu Xin.

58
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,120
What's wrong?

59
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:50,680
Xixi.

60
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,879
Xinxin.

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,520
I have something to tell you.

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,560
What's up?

63
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:58,840
After art history class just now,

64
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,000
Chen Fei confessed to me.

65
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,439
Chen Fei?

66
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:06,719
The one who dated the journalism department's beauty?

67
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:07,960
That Chen Fei who was in a relationship?

68
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,159
I remember she got depressed

69
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,159
and then dropped out, right?

70
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,840
He explained it to me.

71
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,039
He said

72
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:17,160
that girl's mental state

73
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,519
wasn't good to begin with.

74
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,240
Of course he'd say that.

75
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,399
Xiao Yi,

76
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,279
the main thing is whether you like him.

77
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:29,879
I'm not sure.

78
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,360
Then wait until you're sure.

79
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,839
I remember you told me

80
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,360
you hadn't really dated before college.

81
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,399
So you should be careful when it comes to relationships.

82
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,959
You're our best friend.

83
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,959
We can't just watch you walk into danger.

84
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,120
I'll think it over carefully.

85
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,920
Sorry,

86
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,199
for taking a few minutes of your time.

87
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,560
I'm a student from the architecture department.

88
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,560
My name is Chen Fei.

89
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:35,480
Today, I want to confess my feelings to the girl I love.

90
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,240
I hope everyone here

91
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:38,759
can be my witness.

92
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,279
Xiao Yi,

93
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,319
from the moment I first saw you,

94
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,519
I fell deeply in love with you.

95
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,160
Please give me a chance

96
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:50,000
to love you wholeheartedly.

97
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,120
Be my girlfriend.

98
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:03,399
Be together! Be together! Be together!

99
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:10,639
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

100
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,920
Xixi, let's go check that out.

101
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,879
Sure!

102
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:00,839
Why does this girl look so much like you?

103
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:02,160
It's not just similar.

104
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:03,759
That's actually me.

105
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,360
Lu Ming.

106
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:09,240
I remember now.

107
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,879
He's the guy from Professor Zhong's class

108
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:13,480
who discussed novels with you.

109
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,879
Do you both know him?

110
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,920
He's a top student at the art academy.

111
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:18,240
He won several design awards

112
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,519
even before graduating.

113
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:20,759
You're the only one who didn't know.

114
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,759
Hey, classmate.

115
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,800
Your name is Lu Ming, right?

116
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,360
Yes.

117
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,720
Do you realize what you did is illegal?

118
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:30,319
Sorry about that.

119
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,279
I emailed you before.

120
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,720
But you never replied.

121
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,319
This assignment was urgent.

122
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:36,199
So I...

123
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:37,480
What email?

124
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,399
Even if you sent an email,

125
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:47,519
without my permission,

126
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:49,519
it's still a violation of my portrait rights.

127
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:52,079
Sorry.

128
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:55,079
I sincerely apologize to you here.

129
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,680
I'm sorry.

130
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,120
Is an apology all?

131
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,720
Shouldn't you at least treat me to a meal?

132
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,160
I don't know what you like to eat,

133
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,000
so I ordered three signature dishes from this place.

134
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:09,399
So why did you put me

135
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:10,639
in your artwork?

136
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:12,439
My teacher told me

137
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:15,639
art should follow your heart.

138
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,720
The first time I saw you,

139
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,399
I was drawn to you without even realizing it.

140
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,319
Excuse me.

141
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:26,120
Let me take this call.

142
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,720
Hello?

143
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,680
Xu Xin.

144
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:31,319
Where are you?

145
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:31,959
Something happened.

146
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,240
What happened?

147
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,200
Don't ask.

148
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:34,720
Come back quickly.

149
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,879
Someone got hurt.

150
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,879
Sorry, I have an emergency.

151
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:40,559
I have to go.

152
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:41,759
Let's talk next time.

153
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
What exactly happened?

154
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:51,960
That bastard hit Xiao Yi.

155
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:52,879
It's not like that.

156
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:53,960
Let me explain.

157
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,519
Xiao Yi.

158
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,200
I'm sorry.

159
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,639
I really didn't mean to.

160
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:01,639
I just love you too much.

161
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,679
That's why I thought

162
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:04,320
you had something going on with that jerk.

163
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,799
I just wanted to check your phone.

164
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:06,799
But you wouldn't let me.

165
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:08,159
That's why I didn't trust you.

166
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,559
I'm worse than an animal.

167
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,120
Bastard.

168
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,440
Stay away from me from now on.

169
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:15,519
Xiao Yi.

170
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:17,000
Ignore this jerk, let's go.

171
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,399
Xiao Yi, Xiao Yi!

172
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,360
I promise I won't hurt you again.

173
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:30,360
Hurting you hurts me ten thousand times more.

174
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,639
Chen Fei, what are you doing?

175
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,399
Don't be impulsive.

176
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,039
Don't do this, let me go.

177
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:36,600
Chen Fei.

178
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,600
Let me go.

179
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,200
Xu Xin.

180
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,600
Come with me for a moment.

181
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:10,039
Okay, teacher.

182
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:12,000
Xu Xin.

183
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,320
Do you remember the day

184
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,559
when Teacher Liao came to see your performance?

185
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:17,159
Out of so many people, he noticed you right away.

186
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,879
It's a rare chance to intern with their dance troupe.

187
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,240
If you do well, you might even study abroad.

188
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:23,519
What do you think?

189
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:24,919
Am I dreaming?

190
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,879
Of course I want to go for this opportunity.

191
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,320
Xu Xin.

192
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,200
Are you sure you still want to teach kids part-time?

193
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:48,159
Don't worry, Teacher Zhou.

194
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,240
I won't let it affect my work with the troupe.

195
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,720
Besides, I like kids.

196
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:00,879
Teacher Xu.

197
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:02,279
Do you know this person?

198
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,440
We went to the same university.

199
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,639
But we're not close.

200
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:31,240
Hello.

201
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:32,360
Do you need any help?

202
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:44,440
This book isn't actually that great.

203
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,679
If you just skim through it,

204
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:47,799
and decide to buy it,

205
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:49,919
it would be a waste of your money.

206
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,840
Do you have any mystery novels here?

207
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,840
I do have one to recommend.

208
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,840
Klein's Kettle.

209
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,759
What's the book about?

210
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:09,240
Have you

211
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:11,720
ever doubted if this world

212
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:12,759
might actually be fake?

213
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,639
What do you mean?

214
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,320
I mean the plot of the novel.

215
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:23,639
In mathematics,

216
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:26,000
a Klein's Kettle is a non-orientable surface.

217
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,120
It can only truly exist

218
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,600
in four-dimensional space.

219
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:32,360
At first, the story seems

220
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,639
to take place in the real world.

221
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,960
But as the plot deepens and splits,

222
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,320
it ends up creating several similar

223
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,399
but different twin realities.

224
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:44,519
People can't tell where the beginning is

225
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:45,440
or where the end is.

226
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,360
Those trapped inside

227
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,080
can only judge by death

228
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,919
whether the end is the beginning

229
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,559
or the real end.

230
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,960
But even so,

231
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,840
can you really start at the beginning

232
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,919
and end at the end?

233
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,240
Hope you like it.

234
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:14,519
Thank you.

235
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,200
Are you a dancer?

236
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,399
How did you know I study dance?

237
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,440
Sorry,

238
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,279
I saw it by accident.

239
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:23,799
Yeah.

240
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,200
But I'm not a dancer yet.

241
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:27,639
I'm just a performer.

242
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:29,879
I'm still working towards becoming a dancer.

243
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,279
That's impressive.

244
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:33,240
To become a professional dancer,

245
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:35,200
you must have sacrificed a lot.

246
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,559
I really have given up quite a bit.

247
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:41,799
But the outcome isn't as great as I hoped.

248
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,399
Actually, the result doesn't matter.

249
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,919
Start at the beginning,

250
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,600
end at the end.

251
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:53,080
That's enough.

252
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,759
That's what the book says.

253
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:00,919
I'll read it carefully.

254
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,360
By the way,

255
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,200
I'm Xu Xin.

256
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,279
I'm Song Jianping.

257
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:06,919
You can call me Aping.

258
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:07,960
Nice to meet you too.

259
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:09,600
I think

260
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:10,720
I should head back.

261
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,720
Xu Xin,

262
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,840
reality isn't always disappointing.

263
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,919
Sometimes, surprises come too.

264
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,320
Hey, Xu Xin,

265
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:06,360
I've heard you talk about your boyfriend for so long,

266
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:07,679
but this is my first time meeting him.

267
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,919
Xu Xin has mentioned you to me several times too.

268
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:12,279
I heard you two were really close in college.

269
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,279
Isn't there someone else?

270
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,080
Oh right, where's Xixi?

271
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,159
I don't know.

272
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:18,720
I just called her.

273
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,519
She should be here soon.

274
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:23,519
By the way, Chen Fei,

275
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,120
how's work going lately?

276
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,799
What can I say?

277
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:27,720
It's just the usual.

278
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,120
Drawing every day.

279
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:29,960
Just a regular worker.

280
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:31,639
Oh yeah,

281
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,200
another friend is coming soon.

282
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,320
He was in my department in college.

283
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,159
His name is Lu Ming.

284
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:37,440
I’m not sure if you know him.

285
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,200
Yeah,

286
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:39,320
back in our college days,

287
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,440
he was that really famous senior.

288
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:41,399
Do you remember?

289
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,000
I kind of remember.

290
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,799
Sorry,

291
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:45,519
I'm late.

292
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,200
Busy person, huh?

293
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:48,799
Have a seat.

294
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:51,159
Let me introduce you.

295
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:53,639
This is my wife, Xiao Yi.

296
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:54,519
You've met her before.

297
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:55,080
Hello.

298
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,399
This is her college friend,

299
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:56,960
Xu Xin,

300
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,480
and her boyfriend, Song Jianping.

301
00:15:58,679 --> 00:15:59,480
Hello.

302
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,600
I remember you.

303
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:03,080
I remember back in college,

304
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,519
we took Western Literature History together.

305
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,279
Was it Professor Zhong's class?

306
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:08,679
Professor Zhong's class was really interesting.

307
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:10,879
Are you still in touch with him?

308
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,399
How's he doing lately?

309
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,559
You don't know?

310
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,519
A few years after we graduated,

311
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:17,559
he was reported for sexual harassment by a junior.

312
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:18,679
He was expelled from the university.

313
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:20,720
I haven't heard anything about him in ages.

314
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,600
Sorry I'm late.

315
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:26,879
Everyone's here.

316
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:28,080
You finally made it.

317
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:29,799
Alright.

318
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,519
Everyone's here now.

319
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,120
Let's raise a glass.

320
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:32,919
Come on.

321
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,679
Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!

322
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,600
So, what does your boyfriend do?

323
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:43,600
Jianping owns a small book café.

324
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,480
We met at his shop.

325
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:46,799
Yeah.

326
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:49,360
Back then, I recommended a mystery novel to Xu Xin.

327
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:50,399
Klein's Kettle.

328
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:54,159
I remember in college,

329
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:55,159
you really liked literary history.

330
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,360
You even said you wanted to write novels someday.

331
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:00,320
Xu Xin is writing one now.

332
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:02,480
Really?

333
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:03,840
What kind of novel is it?

334
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:05,880
A suspense novel.

335
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,480
But it's just for fun.

336
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,319
I think you write really well.

337
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:12,240
They say history is fake,

338
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,599
but novels are the real thing.

339
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,119
Did you put us in your story?

340
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:17,920
I'll tell you when it's finished.

341
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,240
Then I have a suggestion for you.

342
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,839
Let Lu Ming design the cover.

343
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,279
His hands turn everything into gold these days.

344
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,480
Any collaboration with him

345
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,680
sells like crazy.

346
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:31,359
By the way, Lu Ming,

347
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:33,960
now that you're so successful,

348
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,319
haven't you thought about your personal life?

349
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,079
I haven't considered it yet.

350
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:40,480
What's there to consider?

351
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:41,720
When it comes to men and women,

352
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,599
it's just a matter of attraction.

353
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:45,640
Isn't there another single person right next to you?

354
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,240
If you're both single, you should get together.

355
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:53,000
I think you two are a good match.

356
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:54,720
Xixi,

357
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,039
no offense,

358
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,559
but you're not that young anymore.

359
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,359
Look at your two friends here,

360
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:01,400
they're both in relationships.

361
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,000
If you don't find a boyfriend soon,

362
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:03,920
in a few years,

363
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,480
you might end up as an unmarried woman.

364
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,079
No need, really.

365
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:08,720
I'm happy being single.

366
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:12,240
What if I end up with another unreliable guy?

367
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,440
Maybe he doesn't even make much money.

368
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,599
I'd have to support him.

369
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:19,839
Maybe he talks nonsense all the time.

370
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:22,720
What if he hits women when he's upset?

371
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:33,559
Xixi,

372
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,839
what do you mean by that?

373
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:39,960
Fair point.

374
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,319
Lu Ming, let me give you some advice.

375
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,559
Be careful when choosing a woman.

376
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,640
Don't pick someone who's always frowning.

377
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,000
Or someone who gossips nonstop.

378
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,640
And always exaggerates everything.

379
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:55,319
Sorry.

380
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,079
Looks like I killed the mood.

381
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:00,839
I'll finish this bottle.

382
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:01,880
I'm leaving.

383
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:15,039
So I'm drinking alone?

384
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:16,480
You're not joining me?

385
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,640
Come on, be a sport.

386
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,599
I'll get you for this!

387
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:36,599
Chen Fei, Chen Fei, are you crazy?

388
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,200
Just wait, I'm not done with you!

389
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,559
Calm down, don't pull me.

390
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:40,880
I'm fine.

391
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,079
Xiaoyi,

392
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,079
I didn't ask you to do all this.

393
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:00,279
If I don't, who will?

394
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:01,440
Xu Xin?

395
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:04,400
Xiaoyi,

396
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:06,319
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

397
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:12,480
Sorry.

398
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,920
It's all my fault.

399
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,000
I ruined our reunion.

400
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:21,640
But Xiaoyi,

401
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:26,559
I've been advising you since college.

402
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,119
But I know you won't listen.

403
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,240
Let's leave it at that.

404
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:41,799
Xu Xin,

405
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,640
when your book is done, send me a copy.

406
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:47,960
I'll be your first reader.

407
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:50,880
I'm off.

408
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:10,880
I really miss the three of us.

409
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:13,359
Doing nothing,

410
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:15,079
just chatting like this.

411
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,039
After we graduated from college,

412
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,759
these chances became rare.

413
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:19,720
Yeah.

414
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,039
After Xiao Yi got married,

415
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:23,920
she barely kept in touch with us.

416
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,680
What are you talking about?

417
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,039
Xiao Yi got married?

418
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:30,480
Yeah.

419
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,960
She married Chen Fei right after graduation.

420
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,440
Chen Fei?

421
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,759
You weren't there that day.

422
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,279
Chen Fei scratched me.

423
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:41,039
Xiao Yi broke up with him on the spot.

424
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,160
Xi Xi.

425
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:45,119
It's completely over between us.

426
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,240
Xiao Yi.

427
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,599
I wasn't there?

428
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,759
Didn't we just have dinner together a few days ago?

429
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,119
You even had a conflict with Chen Fei then.

430
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,160
I haven't seen him since graduation.

431
00:21:58,799 --> 00:21:59,519
Xu Xin.

432
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:01,480
What's wrong?

433
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,960
So where is Xiao Yi now?

434
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,119
We...

435
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,319
Why are we even here?

436
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:34,160
Hello, Jianping.

437
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:36,359
I'll be back later.

438
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:39,039
I'm buying you a gift.

439
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,160
You'll know when I get back.

440
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:43,960
Bye.
