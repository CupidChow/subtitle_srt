1
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,200
Stop running.

2
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:14,640
Come here, come here, this way.

3
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,239
Give it to me.

4
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:16,959
Stop running.

5
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:17,959
Come here.

6
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,239
Stop running, you'll fall!

7
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,760
Stop messing around.

8
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,280
Come on, sit down nicely.

9
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,920
Why are you dressed like that?

10
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,920
It still fits, right?

11
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:46,840
Thank you.

12
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:49,239
Sorry for the trouble.

13
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:49,920
It's fine.

14
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:01,159
Is this the right address?

15
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:11,080
Sorry, I really troubled you.

16
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,599
But I really don't know who else to ask.

17
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,759
So what are we going to do?

18
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:23,639
I don't know how to explain it to you.

19
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,680
Hello, are you here to see the apartment?

20
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,680
I've heard about it before.

21
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,039
I heard you're preparing a new exhibition.

22
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,639
What's the theme?

23
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,400
When will it open?

24
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,199
If you don't like it, you don't have to come back.

25
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,599
Weren't you pretty determined when you left?

26
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:37,439
Happy anniversary.

27
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,360
Your mom is in Meiling, right?

28
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,680
Can you take me somewhere else?

29
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:22,959
Over there.

30
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,600
Mom

31
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,639
Xin Xin

32
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,040
Xin Xin, is that you?

33
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,240
You... you came to see me.

34
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:31,439
You came to see me, didn't you?

35
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,800
Why didn't you let me know?

36
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,879
At least you could have called me.

37
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:37,439
Sit down, quick.

38
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:40,079
Let me get you some water.

39
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,639
Water, water.

40
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:42,199
Let me do it.

41
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:42,920
Water.

42
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:49,720
The hot water is outside.

43
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:04,399
You haven't changed a bit.

44
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:07,720
Why are you living here all alone?

45
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:13,839
Your aunt brought me here.

46
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,560
What about Xu Yuan? Why isn't she taking care of you?

47
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,879
Xu Yuan

48
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,199
Xu

49
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,279
Xu Yuan, my sister.

50
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,079
I only have you as my daughter.

51
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:34,959
Do you still remember when we were kids,

52
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:36,360
how we used to dance together?

53
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,079
What if I told you you never had a sister, you're an only child?

54
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:41,079
Would you believe me?

55
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:45,399
I'm telling you, I don't want to stay here.

56
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,079
People here aren't nice to me at all.

57
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:50,040
I suspect one of the caregivers

58
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,879
she stole my money, you know?

59
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,600
Can you take me away?

60
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:56,040
Please, I'm begging you, take me away, okay?

61
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:06,040
Aren't you here to take me out?

62
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,160
Where's Lu Ming?

63
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,759
Where is Lu Ming? Lu Ming?

64
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:15,360
Here's the water.

65
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:30,399
Who is he? Is he your husband?

66
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,560
You and Lu Ming broke up.

67
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,399
I told you a long time ago,

68
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:40,480
Lu Ming isn't right for you.

69
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:42,600
If you stay with him,

70
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,040
he'll ruin everything for you, you know?

71
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,759
He's a bad person.

72
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,920
He's always tried to take you away from me.

73
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,560
He's always done that.

74
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:54,079
I've always told him to give you back to me.

75
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,040
But he never listens.

76
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,120
So I went to beg him.

77
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,160
I even got on my knees.

78
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,000
I begged him, please leave Xu Xin, please.

79
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,160
I got on my knees, you know?

80
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,839
What did you say to Lu Ming?

81
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:22,360
I'm still with Lu Ming.

82
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,319
Then why did you come here?

83
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:34,480
To laugh at me?

84
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,840
Are you here to make fun of me?

85
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,840
Let me tell you, I'm doing great.

86
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,919
I'm really happy here.

87
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,799
Everyone treats me so well.

88
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:49,519
Look, they're all smiling.

89
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,200
Everyone is so nice to me.

90
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,679
The environment is so nice, everything's green.

91
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,519
Isn't it?

92
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,120
I'm really happy here.

93
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:58,240
I'm not lonely, not at all.

94
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:00,279
I'm very happy, you know?

95
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,200
Since you're not here to take me home,

96
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:03,919
then leave.

97
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:05,360
Hurry up and go.

98
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:06,519
Go!

99
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,480
Don't let me see you here again.

100
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,320
Nurse, tell them to leave, nurse!

101
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,799
I don't want to see them again.

102
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,639
Go, I don't want to see them.

103
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,039
Nurse! Nurse!

104
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:32,960
Can you tell me the reason?

105
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,519
Just take the money, that's all.

106
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,120
Ask what you should ask.

107
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:38,960
Don't ask what you shouldn't.

108
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,919
Otherwise, I'll expose your past.

109
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,840
When that happens,

110
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,360
it won't just ruin your reputation.

111
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:50,200
Don't bring this up again.

112
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,240
I used to do that, but I've changed.

113
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:54,879
No need to explain. I don't care.

114
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:58,320
Just do as I say.

115
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,919
Where should I take you later?

116
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:25,600
I don't know where I can go.

117
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,320
Let me find a place for you.

118
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:37,919
I don't know what happened to you,

119
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,320
but I got you a volunteer spot.

120
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:42,279
You can stay here tonight.

121
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:45,200
Thank you.

122
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:50,559
So what exactly happened today?

123
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:56,720
If you don't want to talk, that's fine.

124
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,480
Yuan You.

125
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,759
Do you really want to know?

126
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,639
Did you understand what I said?

127
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:26,600
The people you've met

128
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,600
all suddenly disappeared without reason.

129
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:30,039
Including your sister.

130
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,720
No one in this world except you

131
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:36,960
remembers them.

132
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,480
You even suspect it's related to your husband.

133
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,279
Doesn't this sound made up?

134
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,960
It does sound like it.

135
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:00,720
But it's not impossible.

136
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:02,639
I've read novels online

137
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:03,960
where people travel back in time.

138
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,559
Nothing strange about it.

139
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,879
Do you really believe what I'm saying?

140
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,559
I have no reason not to believe you.

141
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,919
At least you don't seem crazy right now.

142
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,919
Wait, what are you doing?

143
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:39,960
Here they come.

144
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,639
Why did you ask me to come here?

145
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,200
I want to talk to you.

146
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:53,720
How should I continue your interview?

147
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,639
Should I interview your wife?

148
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:02,159
To see if she truly remembers nothing.

149
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,960
I'm warning you, stay away from Xu Xin.

150
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:10,360
Are you threatening me?

151
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:14,960
I wonder if your wife

152
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,600
has ever seen you like this.

153
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,919
Would she be scared?

154
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,639
But I told you,

155
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:24,519
I can accept what she can't.

156
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,440
Since she remembers nothing,

157
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:31,759
why not give yourself a chance?

158
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,480
If you choose to leave her now,

159
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:36,320
she won't be sad.

160
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:41,120
Admitting your relationship is over

161
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,799
is it really that hard?

162
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:43,679
Lin Qing.

163
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,799
I don't know why you're so obsessed with me.

164
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,120
But I advise you to stop.

165
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,679
Otherwise,

166
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,279
I really don't know

167
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,759
what I might do.

168
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:06,000
Since you're so clear, Lu Ming,

169
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,240
I have nothing more to say.

170
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,799
But let me remind you, as an adult,

171
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,480
you're responsible for all your actions.

172
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,240
I hope you won't regret your choice today.

173
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:14,840
Xiao Tangyuan

174
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,679
Xiao Tangyuan

175
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,519
Kids,

176
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,360
The brain is a truly amazing thing.

177
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:55,679
It's fascinating.

178
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:57,919
Just by imagining,

179
00:16:57,919 --> 00:16:58,840
we can do so many

180
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,840
incredible things.

181
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,080
Okay, listen to my instructions now.

182
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,120
Close your eyes.

183
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,000
Breathe in with my rhythm.

184
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,440
Breathe out.

185
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:13,599
Imagine in your life

186
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,079
the spiciest thing you've ever eaten.

187
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,920
Picture what it looks like.

188
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,000
Its shape.

189
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:23,000
Its color.

190
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:24,839
How is it?

191
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,839
Isn't it super spicy?

192
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,559
Spicy! So spicy! It's killing me!

193
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:29,920
I've never eaten anything spicy.

194
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,519
Really?

195
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:31,839
So spicy!

196
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:34,759
It's so spicy! Tasty things are always spicy.

197
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,240
I never eat spicy food.

198
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:36,720
Really?

199
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:37,759
Yesterday's wasn't spicy either.

200
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:39,279
I've never had anything spicy.

201
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,640
Let's play again, okay?

202
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,039
Close your eyes.

203
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:45,359
Okay, okay, okay.

204
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:47,960
Imagine

205
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,359
in your life

206
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:52,440
the most wonderful smell you've ever smelled.

207
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,839
Picture what it looks like.

208
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,799
Its shape.

209
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:03,319
When did you smell it?

210
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,119
How did you feel when you smelled it?

211
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,680
Now breathe in.

212
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:14,079
Breathe out.

213
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:19,440
Then slowly open your eyes.

214
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:26,079
Smell your own hand.

215
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:28,799
Does it smell nice?

216
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,440
How is it?

217
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,920
Isn't there a really nice smell?

218
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:36,759
So fragrant! So fragrant!

219
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:40,240
I like it. It's like Teacher He's perfume.

220
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:48,720
I didn't expect to really smell something.

221
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,200
So what did you smell?

222
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,400
Incense stick.

223
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,640
There was a temple next to my house when I was little.

224
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:00,400
My mom took me there to pray for blessings.

225
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:04,079
I loved that smell back then.

226
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:08,920
I had forgotten about it before.

227
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:11,799
You made me remember it again.

228
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,160
This is actually a kind of self-suggestion.

229
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,839
Some deep memories

230
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,359
are always hidden in our minds.

231
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:20,680
It's no big deal.

232
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,559
So how do you know all this?

233
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,039
Where are you going?

234
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:32,279
There have been a lot of problems between us.

235
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:35,279
I want to move out for a while.

236
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,200
If you think we really have a problem,

237
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:45,079
we can sit down and talk about it.

238
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,720
What do you think?

239
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:56,559
Are you going to see that man again?

240
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:58,799
This has nothing to do with anyone else.

241
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:02,720
I just need some space and time for myself.

242
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,279
To figure things out.

243
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:08,160
We've been stuck in this situation

244
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,559
for a long time now.

245
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,559
Right now,

246
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,319
I just know I can't stay here anymore.

247
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:18,400
You can't leave here.

248
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,880
How are you going to stop me?
