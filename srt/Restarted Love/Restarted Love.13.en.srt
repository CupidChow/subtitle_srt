1
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,640
Xu Ran

2
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:49,879
It's me.

3
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,959
I’d like to meet with the investor.

4
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,200
Mr. Ma

5
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,680
About last time—

6
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,000
Lu Ming said something inappropriate in the heat of the moment.

7
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:12,159
And then,

8
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,159
You know how artists can be.

9
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,080
Sometimes they speak without thinking.

10
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:17,639
He really regretted it afterward.

11
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:18,840
He kept calling me.

12
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,919
He insisted I bring him here.

13
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:22,039
So he could apologize to you in person.

14
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:23,719
So, you see—

15
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:35,360
I’m sorry, Mr. Ma.

16
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,280
I was too narrow-minded.

17
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:43,159
I couldn’t accept criticism.

18
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,000
I offended you.

19
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:46,479
I’m sorry.

20
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:50,759
Actually,

21
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,039
It’s not really the artist’s fault.

22
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,639
Maybe I talked too much last time.

23
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:03,319
So this time,

24
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,319
I’ll keep quiet.

25
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,759
Let me—

26
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:19,560
Let me.

27
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,040
Xu Xin

28
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:37,439
Come here for a moment.

29
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:43,959
What do you think of this painting?

30
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,160
I spent a month working on it.

31
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:51,199
I think it’s pretty good.

32
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,199
Let me tell you a secret.

33
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:00,199
It’s actually just a pile of trash.

34
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:04,600
Out of everything I’ve ever painted,

35
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,480
this is the most vulgar and the worst.

36
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,639
But here’s the funny part.

37
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:10,319
You know what?

38
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,560
Xu Ran already sold it.

39
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,560
And for a really high price.

40
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:27,240
If you’re not happy with it,

41
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:29,720
why are you asking me?

42
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,680
Yeah.

43
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,480
If you think it’s good,

44
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,720
then maybe it is good.

45
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,439
Do you think I don’t understand any of this?

46
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,160
Or that I can’t understand you?

47
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,040
You think all I ever do

48
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:57,600
is dance around

49
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:59,040
and read books, right?

50
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,680
I don’t know.

51
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,360
I can’t tell what’s good

52
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:15,600
or what’s bad anymore.

53
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,519
Do you remember?

54
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,680
I used to love going to exhibitions.

55
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,800
Because that was something I truly enjoyed.

56
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,800
But now I don’t go anymore.

57
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,040
Do you know why?

58
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:38,160
When I see others paint better than me,

59
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:40,920
I feel really down.

60
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,240
Why can he paint so well?

61
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,439
Is it because I’m not good enough?

62
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:54,360
But when I see others paint worse than me,

63
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:57,680
I feel even worse.

64
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,959
How can a piece of trash still be above me?

65
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:14,800
Lu Ming

66
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:16,800
Are you under too much pressure?

67
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,639
I’m perfectly fine.

68
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,480
I’m perfectly fine.

69
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:48,679
Doctor

70
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:49,480
My wife

71
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,399
Why did I lose my child?

72
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,279
Miscarriage in the early months of pregnancy is common.

73
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,879
Because this is considered the early pregnancy stage.

74
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,080
The embryo is still unstable.

75
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,159
It’s very easy for a miscarriage to happen.

76
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:00,759
I just want to know

77
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:02,440
why I lost my child.

78
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,879
Hormonal factors

79
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,360
Environmental factors

80
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,159
Genetic factors

81
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:09,720
Or issues with the immune system

82
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,519
And at the time it happened,

83
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,120
you didn’t get medical help right away.

84
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:16,799
Otherwise, the pregnancy might have been saved.

85
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:41,320
I'm back.

86
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:46,080
Xu Xin, do you know what happened?

87
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,919
I closed a huge deal today.

88
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,399
We’ll be able to move out of here soon.

89
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:01,320
What did you do at home today?

90
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,440
Nothing much.

91
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,200
I know what you're thinking.

92
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:16,200
I was just looking at the window.

93
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,320
Is the window nice?

94
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:26,919
It’s still the same as always.

95
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:42,440
You know,

96
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,120
I think

97
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,120
we could take a road trip to the seaside.

98
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,919
A change of scenery.

99
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,559
Maybe it would be good for us.

100
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,080
For this exhibition to go smoothly,

101
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,519
I must first thank Mr. Ma from Tianzhong Group

102
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:28,679
for his strong support.

103
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,120
Without him,

104
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,519
I wouldn’t be where I am today.

105
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:34,320
I also want to thank my partner

106
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,200
and agent, Xu Ran.

107
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:38,200
He organized this exhibition.

108
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:40,200
It’s all part of my job.

109
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:42,960
Thank you to all the journalists for coming today.

110
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,799
And the person I’m most grateful to,

111
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,320
who couldn’t be here today due to health reasons,

112
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,279
is absent from the event.

113
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,559
She is my beloved wife,

114
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:51,600
Xu Xin.

115
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,759
May I ask, Mr. Lu Ming,

116
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,559
what do you wish to express with this exhibition?

117
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,639
I want to express that in this digital age,

118
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:02,440
creators are fighting against the phenomenon of appreciating the ugly.

119
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:03,879
Can I interpret this as

120
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,879
another instance of you leveraging public sentiment

121
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,759
for a successful commercial strategy?

122
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:08,879
As far as I know,

123
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:10,600
the themes of your works in recent years

124
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:12,320
have consistently tapped into

125
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,480
hot social topics.

126
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,600
Combined with short video marketing,

127
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:16,679
they have sparked

128
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:18,360
quite a bit of debate and reaction.

129
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:19,480
Some say your works

130
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,360
are prime examples of successful commodification.

131
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:22,679
Others say

132
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,440
you are exploiting public emotions

133
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,840
to stir up social division,

134
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,399
losing the essence of art.

135
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,039
What’s your view on this?

136
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:29,960
Whose comments?

137
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:30,960
Some critics.

138
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:35,000
My response to that

139
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,919
is to suggest they take a piece of paper,

140
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,679
write down all their opinions about my work,

141
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:39,559
put it all down,

142
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,720
then shove it in their mouths and swallow it.

143
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,559
And then go on living their miserable lives.

144
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,240
Because no one

145
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,320
cares about their comments.

146
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:49,759
So you mean

147
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:51,559
you don’t accept any outside criticism?

148
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:53,879
My work is simply my personal expression.

149
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:55,120
It has nothing to do with anyone else.

150
00:13:57,639 --> 00:13:58,399
Even so,

151
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:00,120
it’s the recognition from the industry

152
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:01,799
that brought you to where you are today.

153
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:04,200
But I don’t need their approval.

154
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,720
Even so,

155
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,519
you still benefit from public opinion.

156
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,919
Positive comments from the public

157
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:11,080
have brought you fame and fortune.

158
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,000
But at the same time, you can’t accept

159
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,519
the negative impact of public opinion.

160
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:16,639
Isn’t that a bit of a double standard?

161
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,200
This reporter’s question

162
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,559
is a bit too one-sided.

163
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:21,639
Mr. Lu’s works and creative process

164
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:23,279
have always stayed true to their original intent.

165
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,399
Consistent from start to finish.

166
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:25,600
He never considers

167
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,879
the factors you mentioned.

168
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:29,039
Let me tell everyone something.

169
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:30,240
Just now,

170
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,320
Mr. Lu’s "归处"

171
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,960
was sold for a sky-high price at auction.

172
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,080
This is a major event for our art world,

173
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,000
bringing honor and recognition to us all.

174
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:40,759
Wouldn’t you all agree?

175
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:45,279
Congratulations.

176
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,840
Your work sold really well this time.

177
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,120
We’re going to make a good profit again.

178
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:52,639
What’s wrong?

179
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:53,600
You don’t seem happy.

180
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,000
Is it because of that reporter just now?

181
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,480
Don’t take it to heart.

182
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:00,480
You know,

183
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:03,159
you need to start working on your next piece soon.

184
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:04,720
I’ve got a long list of orders waiting.

185
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,759
Everyone’s waiting for you.

186
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,240
Xu Ran.

187
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:09,399
I want to take a break for a while.

188
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:11,240
Take a break? Now?

189
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,039
Lu Ming.

190
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,639
Time is money right now.

191
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:15,879
It’s because of Xu Xin.

192
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,679
She hasn’t been doing well lately.

193
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:19,720
I want to spend some time with her.

194
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:21,879
She still hasn’t recovered.

195
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,679
That’s true.

196
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,080
Lu Ming.

197
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,639
About what happened...

198
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:29,559
It really was an accident.

199
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,840
Try to comfort her.

200
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:34,919
Mr. Xu.

201
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:38,120
Mr. Lu.

202
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:40,759
Ms. Lin Qing.

203
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:42,720
Let me introduce you.

204
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:45,919
This is a well-known writer in our field,

205
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,080
Ms. Lin Qing.

206
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:47,960
Hello.

207
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:49,399
Hello.

208
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:50,080
Mr. Lu.

209
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,559
Mr. Lu is the rising star of our art world.

210
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:53,600
I’ve heard so much about you.

211
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,000
The way you express love in your work

212
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,759
—I really admire it.

213
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,799
All my inspiration comes from my wife.

214
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,279
I’ve heard that before.

215
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:03,559
People say you and your wife have a wonderful relationship.

216
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,080
You’re considered the perfect couple in our circle.

217
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,600
Everyone envies you two.

218
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,320
Ms. Lin, you’re also very famous.

219
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,159
I’ve heard about you as well.

220
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:12,799
And what have you heard about me?

221
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,240
I’ve long heard that your art criticism

222
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,600
is highly respected.

223
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:16,919
Those you’ve interviewed

224
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:18,600
have all gained much more recognition.

225
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,480
You flatter me.

226
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,159
It’s only because they’re talented.

227
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:23,919
But,

228
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,080
Ms. Lin is known for her sharp words.

229
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,200
She never holds back.

230
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:31,320
Some people’s reputations have suffered because of it.

231
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,720
I just report what I see and hear,

232
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,039
and express it honestly.

233
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:39,639
So, Mr. Lu, do you have the courage

234
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:41,039
to accept an exclusive interview with us?

235
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,000
That’s a great opportunity.

236
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,039
Lu Ming.

237
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,000
You have no idea

238
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,279
how many artists

239
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:47,879
are eager for an interview with Ms. Lin Qing.

240
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,799
Well, Ms. Lin,

241
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,519
let me discuss it with my agent.

242
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,399
I’ll be waiting for your reply.

243
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:54,799
Alright.

244
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:55,440
No problem.

245
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:11,799
I’m back.

246
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,000
How was your day?

247
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,559
It was fine.

248
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:23,400
Just like usual.

249
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,359
How about you?

250
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:27,880
Pretty good.

251
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,559
By the way,

252
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:33,240
why didn’t you come to my solo exhibition’s closing?

253
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,480
I was a bit tired.

254
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:40,640
That’s okay too.

255
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,920
Congratulations.

256
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:50,519
Let’s go have dinner.

257
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,279
Let’s celebrate.

258
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,400
Why are we eating at a place like this?

259
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,119
Do you remember?

260
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:02,519
This was the place

261
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:04,000
we used to love coming to.

262
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:06,160
Even the owner has changed now.

263
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,200
Looks like it’s been renovated.

264
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,519
Back then, we didn’t have any money.

265
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:15,480
The portions here were big and cheap.

266
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,519
Should we try

267
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:17,559
if it still tastes the same?

268
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,519
Sure.

269
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:26,799
Xu Xin

270
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,720
How about we go somewhere else?

271
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:32,480
What's wrong?

272
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,160
Let's pick a nicer restaurant.

273
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,720
No need.

274
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,640
I think this place is fine.

275
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,319
We used to eat at places like this because we were broke.

276
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,160
But now we can afford better.

277
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:52,640
But I still think this place is good.

278
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,119
Let me take this call.

279
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,839
Hello, Xu Ran.

280
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:05,960
Okay.

281
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,559
I'll head over now.

282
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:11,319
Xu Xin

283
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,640
Let's go eat somewhere else.

284
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,359
Xu Ran and some friends are eating nearby.

285
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,440
Let's join them.

286
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,160
Why don't you go ahead?

287
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,599
I'll eat here by myself.

288
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:29,480
Suit yourself.

289
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,960
Why did you suddenly ask me to come here?

290
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,200
Lu Ming.

291
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,200
I want to have a proper talk with you.

292
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:49,440
Is there anything you want to say to each other?

293
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,640
I just feel like I’m wasting my time.

294
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,799
Did you really bring me here just to talk?

295
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:56,960
Is that the real reason you asked me to come?

296
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,480
But every time I try to talk to you,

297
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,319
you push me away.

298
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,720
Because I feel

299
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,680
you don’t truly want to open up to me.

300
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:09,440
I want to help you.

301
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:11,839
But I don’t know what I should do.

302
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:18,319
So all I can do is work hard.

303
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:19,319
To give you a better life.

304
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,440
I really tried my best.

305
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,240
But this isn’t what I want.

306
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:24,200
Then what do you really want?

307
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:28,000
I want you to come back.

308
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:42,839
I don’t know what you mean.

309
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,200
I’m right here with you.

310
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:47,720
Right in front of you.

311
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:52,720
No.

312
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,079
You’re not here.

313
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,839
You’re in your gallery.

314
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:00,599
In your studio.

315
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:03,559
On the TV screen.

316
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,000
And me,

317
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,599
I’m left alone in this harsh reality.

318
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:14,079
Ms. Xu.

319
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:15,799
I know that two years ago,

320
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:17,440
you had a miscarriage due to an accident.

321
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:27,799
I’m very sorry.

322
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:31,119
Is the distance between you

323
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,200
related to that miscarriage?

324
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,720
Have you talked about this issue?

325
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,200
It’s a past we don’t want to mention.

326
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:09,240
Why are you here?

327
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,319
I have something important to tell you.

328
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:16,400
How important must it be

329
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,400
for you to come in person?

330
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:26,079
It’s about me and Lu Ming.

331
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:29,720
I knew it was because of him.

332
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,480
I’ve heard about it.

333
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:33,799
He’s doing quite well.

334
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,759
You two are living well.

335
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:38,319
Your house must be several times bigger than this one.

336
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,039
Mom, I’m home.

337
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,759
Sis.

338
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:46,519
Long time no see.

339
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,359
Mom.

340
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,160
You didn’t tell me Sis was coming.

341
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,400
I could’ve come back earlier.

342
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,039
Hello, Xiao Geng.

343
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:03,119
Since Sis is here,

344
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:04,319
I just bought groceries.

345
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:05,519
Let’s have a meal together.

346
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:09,839
Let’s eat.

347
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:10,720
Come on.

348
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,680
Let’s raise a glass together.

349
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,559
Welcome home, Sis.

350
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,720
Sis, you should come back often.

351
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,440
We all miss you.

352
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,319
Where’s Uncle Geng?

353
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,440
Dad’s on a business trip.

354
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,680
He’ll be back in two weeks.

355
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,720
How have you been lately?

356
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,480
I’m doing well.

357
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,880
And I’m going on blind dates.

358
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:36,920
Yeah.

359
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,920
During these dates,

360
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,599
everyone who’s met Mingran

361
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,680
is very satisfied.

362
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,279
Mom.

363
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,279
Don’t say that.

364
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:44,759
What’s there to be embarrassed about?

365
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,200
Mom’s going to pick carefully for you.

366
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:48,759
See who’s worthy of you.

367
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,319
Remember this,

368
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,039
I’m doing all this for your own good.

369
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,720
What would you like to ask?

370
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,920
I’ll answer everything I know.

371
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:03,880
Then how about

372
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,440
we start by talking about your new work?

373
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:07,279
Sure.

374
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,440
I recently released a new piece.

375
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,680
It’s called 《谎言之城》.

376
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:13,079
It’s about intentional

377
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,160
and unintentional betrayal between people.

378
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,119
The title is unique.

379
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:18,279
The perspective is unique too.

380
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,519
I poured all my effort into this work.

381
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,200
I’d say it’s the piece I’m most proud of.

382
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:29,880
When you talk about relationships between people,

383
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,960
does that include you and your wife?

384
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:32,960
Yes.

385
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,599
How would you describe

386
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:36,079
your relationship with your wife?

387
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:41,279
I really like a line of poetry.

388
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,960
It goes, “Bound by hair as man and wife,”

389
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,200
“in love and trust we abide.”

390
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:48,359
I think it describes my wife and me

391
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:49,200
better than anything else.

392
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:57,119
Alright.

393
00:25:57,759 --> 00:25:58,759
Let’s settle on that.

394
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,279
Let’s keep in touch.

395
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:05,759
Xiao Sun,

396
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:07,960
help me deliver something to Mr. Wang later.

397
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:09,960
I’ll call you when I need you to pick it up.

398
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,720
It’ll be about three hours.

399
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,200
Okay.

400
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:18,400
Are you feeling better?

401
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,119
Much better.

402
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:23,960
I prepared some gifts for them.

403
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,839
They’re in the trunk.

404
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,559
Don’t forget to take them.

405
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:27,839
Everyone said you didn’t need to buy such expensive gifts.

406
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,240
Don’t make people feel pressured.

407
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:30,680
It’s just a few small things.

408
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:31,680
They’re not worth much.

409
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:35,920
Xu Xin!

410
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,920
Long time no see.

411
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,680
It’s been ages, really!

412
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:40,799
You’ve lost weight again—come here.

413
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:42,920
Thank you.

414
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,640
Fruit.

415
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,039
It’s really fresh.

416
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:46,759
You all should try some.

417
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,680
You shouldn’t have.

418
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,720
Xu Xin brought gifts for you too.

419
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,519
It’s always so heartwarming when we meet.

420
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:53,519
And you even bought me something.

421
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,599
You’re too kind.

422
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,000
It’s beautiful.

423
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,160
Thank you.

424
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:01,519
It’s settled then.

425
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,319
I’m treating everyone today.

426
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:10,960
Lu Ming,

427
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,359
didn’t I say back in college

428
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:14,880
you’d definitely make it?

429
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:17,400
You’ve had too much to drink.

430
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:23,279
I heard your art trading business

431
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,200
is booming.

432
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:27,160
Like that steel wool ball you made,

433
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:29,640
the clay doll,

434
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:30,839
and the wooden cabin.

435
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:32,200
Hey,

436
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,400
can you give your buddies a few?

437
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,960
I heard just one of those goes for five figures.

438
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:39,920
Really? Come on, stop it.

439
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,720
Come on, let’s drink.

440
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:46,559
Cheers.

441
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,319
Bottoms up!

442
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:47,839
Cheers!

443
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:00,119
Are you guys alright?

444
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:01,799
We’re fine.

445
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,000
That’s just how Chen Fei is.

446
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,880
He talks nonsense when he’s drunk.

447
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:09,359
By the way,

448
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:11,200
are you still in touch with Xixi?

449
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,559
You didn’t know?

450
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,119
Xixi has gone abroad.

451
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,640
We’re not in contact anymore.

452
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:23,759
Sir, your balance is insufficient.

453
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,640
Not enough balance.

454
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:28,240
Let me check.

455
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,759
I’ll take care of it.

456
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:33,839
Who are you looking down on?

457
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:36,079
I said I’m paying today.

458
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:37,920
Xiao Yi,

459
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:38,960
your credit card.

460
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:41,200
Credit card.

461
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:42,039
Hurry up.

462
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:43,680
Alright.

463
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:44,720
Swipe the card.

464
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:47,039
Let’s go.

465
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,640
Xiao Yi,

466
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:05,559
take care of yourself.

467
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,160
What do you think?

468
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,680
Does Xiao Yi need our help?

469
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:20,480
That’s their family matter.

470
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:21,680
Let’s go home.
