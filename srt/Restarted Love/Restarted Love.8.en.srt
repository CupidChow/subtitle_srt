1
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:23,159
Xu Xin

2
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,319
I was just about to talk to you.

3
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,719
Xu Xin

4
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,760
Xu Xin, listen to me.

5
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:31,840
Xu Xin

6
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:32,840
Listen to me.

7
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:35,680
Xu Xin

8
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:36,760
Listen to me.

9
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:54,000
Lu Ming

10
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:58,159
Let him go.

11
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:10,560
Xu Xin

12
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,759
Xu Xin, wake up.

13
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:12,840
Xu Xin

14
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:13,840
Xu Xin

15
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,080
Wake up.

16
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:15,919
Xu Xin

17
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,120
Yuan You

18
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,400
Where are we?

19
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,120
I don't know either.

20
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,039
When I woke up just now,

21
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:30,439
I saw Lu Ming tying you up.

22
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,800
I knocked him out while he wasn't looking.

23
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,040
Is this the glass box you mentioned?

24
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,600
Yes.

25
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,399
That's the one.

26
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,399
Xu Yuan was locked in here by Lu Ming.

27
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,240
And this control lever.

28
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:46,879
Lu Ming used this control lever

29
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:47,920
to make Xu Yuan disappear.

30
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,160
Let's call the police right away.

31
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,160
It's useless, Xu Xin.

32
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:51,720
You have to understand,

33
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,639
whether it's Xiao Ya or Xu Yuan,

34
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,439
no one in this world except you

35
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,319
remembers them anymore.

36
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,560
So what should we do now?

37
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,000
Calm down.

38
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:06,199
Let me think.

39
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,800
Let me think.

40
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:15,839
Let me think.

41
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,600
Let me do it.

42
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,000
Yuan You.

43
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,439
Xu Xin.

44
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,879
Now it's time for him to face the consequences.

45
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,399
We just need to push this control lever down,

46
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,839
and you'll be free from him forever.

47
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:36,800
Yuan You.

48
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,000
This isn't something you should do.

49
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,000
You've already done enough for me.

50
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,439
No.

51
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:16,680
Xu Xin.

52
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,120
No.

53
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:28,199
Xu Xin, don't.

54
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:29,040
Xu Xin.

55
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:35,439
Xu Xin, don't.

56
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:42,240
Xu Xin.

57
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:43,920
Xu Xin, don't.

58
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:46,560
No.

59
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,480
No, Xu Xin.

60
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,240
No.

61
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,879
Please, no, Xu Xin.

62
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:36,679
Please, no, Xu Xin.

63
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,519
Hello?

64
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,159
I'm not feeling well today, I can't come.

65
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:52,879
Can you cover for me today?

66
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:56,360
What do you mean by slacking off, bro?

67
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,759
Last time you weren't feeling well,

68
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,960
I covered for you the whole day.

69
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,000
It's settled then.

70
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:00,720
I'm hanging up.

71
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,840
Please, I'm begging you.

72
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:46,399
I don't want to die.

73
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:47,639
I don't want to die.

74
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:49,480
Don't be afraid.

75
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,399
You'll soon go to a new place.

76
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,120
A very, very good place.

77
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:55,600
I don't want to die.

78
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:56,600
I don't want to die.

79
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,480
Don't worry.

80
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:02,159
You won't die.

81
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,000
You're just going somewhere else.

82
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,679
It's a rebirth of the soul.

83
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,240
No one will suffer because of this.

84
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,200
And no one will remember you.

85
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,279
Don't be scared.

86
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:19,960
All of this is

87
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:22,559
a gift from above to me.

88
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:30,840
You're about to go to a better place.

89
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,720
And I'll keep all my memories of you

90
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,519
here with me.

91
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,639
I once thought

92
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,799
my life would always be like this.

93
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:13,080
Whether it was the old me or who I am now,

94
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:17,159
except for this secret only I know,

95
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,879
I was just wasting my days away.

96
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,120
Until

97
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:36,320
the day you appeared.

98
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,080
Your smile was as warm as sunshine.

99
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,120
I wanted to know you.

100
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:54,279
I wanted to know everything about you.

101
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,720
I learned your name.

102
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:14,240
Xu Xin.

103
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:16,879
It's such a beautiful name.

104
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,879
You like reading.

105
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:24,080
You love literature.

106
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,279
Do you like flowers?

107
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,399
I think you would.

108
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,360
Little Tangyuan.

109
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,120
Look.

110
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:38,759
This is the sea.

111
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,320
This is the beach.

112
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:42,039
This is the sun.

113
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,720
Let's go to the beach together someday, okay?

114
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,039
You must be tired.

115
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:54,399
Have some water.

116
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,159
Thank you.

117
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,159
I didn't realize taking care of kids every day was so exhausting.

118
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,720
You all really work hard.

119
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,320
It's okay.

120
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,360
We're used to it.

121
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:14,360
Since Little Tangyuan came here,

122
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,279
you're the one he's closest to.

123
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,480
I don't know why,

124
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,039
but I also feel close to him when I see him.

125
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:30,440
Even though he can't express his feelings,

126
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,639
I can still feel a lot from him.

127
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:36,600
He really likes you.

128
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,480
I wonder

129
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:40,679
if he thinks of you as his mom.

130
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,639
I wish I could have a child like him.

131
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,679
Miss Xu.

132
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,480
You...

133
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,200
I have to go back.

134
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,720
My husband is here to pick me up.

135
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:07,440
Okay.

136
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:09,480
Little Tangyuan.

137
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,120
I'll give this back to you for now.

138
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,399
Bye-bye.

139
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:16,120
Bye-bye.

140
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,279
But we can't be together.

141
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,600
Because you have a husband.

142
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:33,120
That troublesome Lu Ming.

143
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,279
I could tell right away

144
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,200
you two aren't happy together.

145
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,000
What happened

146
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:11,399
was a chance given to me by fate.

147
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:21,360
Xu Xin.

148
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,720
Xu Xin.

149
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,599
Luckily, you weren't seriously hurt in the accident.

150
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,759
But you lost all your memories of me.

151
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,640
Yet fate still tied us together.

152
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,599
That night,

153
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:29,440
I intended to get rid of Chen Fei.

154
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,279
But your arrival stopped me.

155
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:52,000
I know

156
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:54,160
that night, you didn't want to

157
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,359
leave with that man.

158
00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:00,119
Because we are the ones meant to be together.

159
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,400
Xu Xin

160
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,720
For you,

161
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,319
I can do anything.

162
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:18,680
That's great.

163
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:20,240
Thank you.

164
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:28,799
I'm sorry.

165
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:48,000
I need to plant a seed in your heart.

166
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:51,240
A seed that can help you

167
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:54,640
awaken in this terrible marriage.

168
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,640
Be patient.

169
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,559
Xu Xin,

170
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,240
I will save you.

171
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,079
I'll make use of everything I have.

172
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:28,880
Sorry about that.

173
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,319
Children are a good cover.

174
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:31,920
But

175
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,079
they can also cause unexpected trouble.

176
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,440
The door is locked.

177
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:00,200
I guided Little Tangyuan

178
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,680
to draw a picture of the crime scene.

179
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:06,119
It will bring us together again.

180
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:03,039
One day, I'll share my secrets with you.

181
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,319
About this machine.

182
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,680
About everything about me.

183
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,720
But not now.

184
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,799
The rift between you is growing wider.

185
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:19,400
And that's exactly what I need.

186
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:23,160
If you want to be reborn,

187
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,920
you must go through rebirth through nirvana.

188
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,400
Xu Yuan, sis.

189
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:12,640
Xu Yuan, sis, save me.

190
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,279
Sis.

191
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,720
Sis.

192
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:18,640
Sis, help me.

193
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,680
Xu Yuan.

194
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,839
Xu Yuan.

195
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:29,319
You can only rely on me now.

196
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:34,240
Don't let me see you here again.

197
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:35,039
Go.

198
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:39,960
You really did come to me.

199
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,000
Everything went so smoothly.

200
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,720
Even Chen Fei, the unpredictable one,

201
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,279
became our catalyst.

202
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:15,200
She's mentally and intellectually healthy.

203
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,519
Give me some time.

204
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:18,720
I believe she'll regain her mental health.

205
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,039
Thank you.

206
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,119
You're welcome.

207
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,880
I can use my knowledge to help them.

208
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:25,480
I find it very meaningful.

209
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,640
It's also why I studied psychology.

210
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,599
What's wrong?

211
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,359
Want some candy?

212
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,359
You want candy, huh?

213
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:39,119
Let uncle take you to get some, okay?

214
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:42,319
Wait for me a moment.

215
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,119
The candy's outside.

216
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:44,400
Let's go.

217
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,359
Divorce.

218
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:01,039
Just as I suspected.

219
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:03,839
That man has been lying to you all along.

220
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:08,519
I'll get you

221
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,119
out of this toxic marriage.

222
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,440
This is the happiest time of my life.

223
00:25:57,559 --> 00:26:00,839
Our hearts have never been this close.

224
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,000
Xu Xin,

225
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:06,119
I love you.

226
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,759
I'm the only one you can rely on now.

227
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,160
Just a little more.

228
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:17,960
I want to expose that person's ugliness

229
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,160
completely in front of you.

230
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:57,279
Xu Xin

231
00:27:58,039 --> 00:27:58,880
Xu Xin, listen to me.

232
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,920
Let him go.

233
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:09,839
Xu Xin

234
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,440
Xu Xin

235
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:56,160
Xu Xin

236
00:28:57,759 --> 00:28:58,519
Don't.

237
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,519
Xu Xin

238
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:04,440
If you don't push it down,

239
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,319
Lu Ming won't let you go.

240
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:12,599
Think about Xiao Ya.

241
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:21,160
And your sister.

242
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:29,359
And the girl in red.

243
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,440
Little Tangyuan drew a girl.

244
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,720
They can't die in vain.

245
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,799
Someone has to stand up for them.

246
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:42,680
Xu Xin

247
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,920
Don't, Xu Xin.

248
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:48,920
Don't.

249
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:00,720
I don't think I've ever told you.

250
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,400
That girl was wearing red, right?

251
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,920
You told me.

252
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:16,400
No.

253
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,680
I never told you.

254
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,160
You definitely told me.

255
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,160
You forgot, Xu Xin.

256
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,559
I'm sure I never told you.

257
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:31,480
And also,

258
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,559
Lu Ming

259
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,480
Why is his mouth gagged?

260
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:41,440
He's been lying to you all along.

261
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,839
Do you still want to listen to his nonsense?

262
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:44,079
Wait, Yuan You.

263
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,279
We all need to calm down right now.

264
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:51,839
Lu Ming can't fight back anymore.

265
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,000
What we need to do now

266
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,000
is find someone to help us.

267
00:30:57,559 --> 00:30:58,960
Someone will definitely help us.

268
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,640
Xu Xin

269
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,240
No one will believe us anymore.

270
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,519
If you don't do it,

271
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:09,599
I'll decide for you.

272
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:11,000
Yuan You

273
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,240
If...

274
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,880
If Lu Ming really killed them,

275
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,359
I don't want you to become like him.

276
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:43,279
Calm down.

277
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,839
Calm down.

278
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:50,720
Calm down.

279
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:55,680
Don't do this.

280
00:31:57,839 --> 00:31:58,680
Don't do this.

281
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,559
Xu Xin

282
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:03,640
One day you'll thank me.

283
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:04,400
Yuan You

284
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:04,960
Let go.

285
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:05,759
Yuan You

286
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,880
Let go.

287
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:16,839
Why are you treating me like this?

288
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:18,480
I've done so much for you.

289
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,880
Why don't you trust me?

290
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,240
Why?

291
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,039
Let go.

292
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:33,279
Let her go.

293
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,960
Xu Xin

294
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,759
Xu Xin

295
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,880
Xu Xin

296
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,759
I believe everyone here

297
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:08,720
from childhood to now,

298
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,480
whether from books,

299
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:12,359
the stage, or the big screen,

300
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,359
have all encountered

301
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:14,519
many classic masterpieces.

302
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,680
And there are many different opinions.

303
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,079
So, who would like to share?

304
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:25,680
I'm sure everyone's tired of hearing

305
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,960
Xu Xin's opinions.

306
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,079
Let's hear from someone else.

307
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:31,960
This student.

308
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,680
I remember your name is Lu Ming, right?

309
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,119
Yes.
