20
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,330
Mr. Ji.

21
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,600
The phone in the front

22
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,400
has been ringing since morning.

23
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,920
A man whose surname is Pei

24
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,610
called to complain the company’s boss.

25
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,490
Pei?

26
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,400
Did you record it?

27
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,290
Yes, I did.

28
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,900
(Recording)

29
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:00,720
Hey, hey, hello?

30
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:01,980
Anyone listening?

31
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,730
I’m Qi Nian’s friend.

32
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,880
Due to your ruthless exploitation

33
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,800
and oppression.

34
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,970
She hasn’t been home for 24 hours.

35
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,010
I don’t care about your

36
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,670
working schedule.

37
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,690
Compulsory working in non-working

38
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,250
time is against the labor laws.

39
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,440
To be honest,

40
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,370
a company counting on staffs working

41
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,630
extra hours has no future.

42
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,480
A boss counting
on assistant working late

43
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,730
may as well shut down business.

44
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,560
Scientists’ biggest mistake

45
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,640
would be helping you lazy

46
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,040
and stupid bosses live

47
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,930
a wealthy life.

48
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,170
Put it here and go.

49
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,310
You brat.

50
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,790
Your scolding skills have improved
a lot these years.

51
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,780
Hello?

52
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,590
Is this Ms. Wu?

53
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,070
Li Yue, Li Yue.

54
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,300
Come, come here.

55
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,180
What’s wrong?

56
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:13,860
I’ve been looking around,

57
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,610
where’s the tea room

58
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,110
to make some coffee?

59
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:17,740
Over there.

60
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,580
Thank you.

61
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,300
Wait a second.

62
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:19,940
What?

63
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:20,710
Come here.

64
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:21,790
Qi Nian.

65
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,070
What’s wrong with Mr. Ji today?

66
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,590
Nothing.

67
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,750
Something’s up.

68
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,140
Maybe the boss likes

69
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,510
to be scolded at?

70
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:32,860
Let me ask you,

71
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,020
how does your boss

72
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,110
normally deal with pressure?

73
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,390
Deal with pressure?

74
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,270
Does he have pressure?

75
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,180
I think he

76
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,950
handles everything so easily.

77
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,940
Nothing can trouble him.

78
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:45,780
People, events, things.

79
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,540
That’s because you all think so.

80
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,150
It pushes him to be strong.

81
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,620
Has any trouble come

82
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,030
to the office lately?

83
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,020
If it counts,

84
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,470
then it’s the repairing project
of Quancheng’s ancient buildings.

85
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,540
Because local citizens are protesting.

86
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,470
The whole project is on hold now.

87
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,670
Even it’s for one day, we are damaging.

88
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:04,860
But,

89
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,380
you can’t help anyway.

90
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,190
Making a cup of coffee may do.

91
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,500
Got it.

92
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,740
I’ll be making coffee then.

93
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,220
Go ahead.

94
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:11,990
Bye-bye.

95
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,310
I’m coming.

96
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,110
Ms. Wu, why are you here?

97
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,500
I, I’ve paid the rent

98
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,590
for this month.

99
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,140
I

100
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,830
peeled some apples for you.

101
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,190
Very tasty.

102
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,590
Ma’am, wait.

103
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,830
I’ll not agree if you want
to raise the rent.

104
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,820
No, I won’t.

105
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,260
Nor the property fee.

106
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,850
It’s not about it, either.

107
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,820
Then what is it about?

108
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,710
I’m here to ask for a favor.

109
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:48,780
Next month,

110
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,100
my son is getting married.

111
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,030
We’ll take here
as the matrimonial home.

112
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,590
You are taking the apartment back?

113
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:56,190
Don’t worry.

114
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,300
I won’t leave you homeless.

115
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,300
I’ve found one for you.

116
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,660
A nicely decorated one-bedroom apartment
in the next-door plot.

117
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,580
Same rent.

118
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,260
It’s suitable for you to live alone.

119
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,990
What, what about Qi Nian?

120
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,580
No need to worry, too.

121
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,870
I’ve found her another apartment.

122
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,180
You used to share one,

123
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,900
it’s not convenient for a boy
and a girl to live together.

124
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,900
Now you’re separated,

125
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,420
nothing would come up, right?

126
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,470
What can happen between me and her?

127
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,620
It’s normal for the elders to worry.

128
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,260
I understand.

129
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,900
Who is worrying?

130
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,790
Worrying about whom?

131
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,900
It’s a deal then.

132
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,540
Move out in a week.

133
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:36,190
I’ve appointed a moving company for you.

134
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,780
Do it as a favor.

135
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:38,830
Please. Please.

136
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,030
I haven’t agreed yet, Ms. Wu.

137
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,110
Mr. Ji, don’t worry.

138
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,100
I’ve settled the things

139
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,550
you’ve asked me to do.

140
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,740
Why would you buy
an old and shabby apartment

141
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,190
with such a high offer?

142
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,790
You really care for
your younger brother.

143
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,100
Thank you, Ms. Wu.

144
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,390
I’ll transfer the money soon.

145
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,940
Mr. Ji.

146
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,310
Do you have a girlfriend?

147
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,710
My daughter just reached 22.

148
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,630
Yanxin.

149
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,350
Yanxin.

150
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,100
Yanxin.

151
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,950
What’s your plan for the holiday?

152
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,710
Is Shao Zui busy today?

153
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,150
How do you know?

154
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,820
You only come to me

155
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,950
when he’s busy working.

156
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,390
Yanxin.

157
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,260
Ever since you don’t go to school,

158
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,750
It’s been so long since my last update.

159
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,100
I’m dying to see my idol.

160
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,110
Can’t you make time to accompany me?

161
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,990
How do you want me to accompany you?

162
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,830
Teach me how to paint.

163
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,420
Make me a master

164
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,780
within a month,

165
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,910
so I can draw comics
as good as my idol’s.

166
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,190
Who are you obsessed with?

167
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,630
This one.

168
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,470
The latest

169
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,980
(Boyfriend Who Lives In My Head)
super funny girl manga.

170
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,230
Very relaxing.

171
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,740
I’ve never read a girl manga

172
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,590
with such a unique perspective.

173
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,470
It’s called the debris flow
among the comics.

174
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,300
The author’s name is Baby Seven,

175
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,220
what a genius.

176
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,310
I’ll keep reading it for sure.

177
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,550
Here, here.

178
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:29,190
It’s my facsimile of his drawing.

179
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,190
What do you think?

180
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,070
I’ve improved a lot, right?

181
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,150
My painting.

182
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,980
You’ve been saying it
since primary school.

183
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,990
You say it every year,
what’s the point?

184
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,150
Give up.

185
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,870
Why would you pick this one
to facsimile?

186
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,790
You just don’t want to teach me.

187
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,270
Why are you looking at me like this?

188
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,390
Are you underestimating me?

189
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,110
Ji Qiu.

190
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:05,870
Careful with your words.

191
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,100
Ji Qiu, do you admire Baby Seven too?

192
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,500
Why, you too?

193
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,700
I, I am...

194
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,660
Save it.

195
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,900
Pretending to have same interests
to be closer with me.

196
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,150
It’s too cliche to believe,
even for primary students.

197
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,750
MC’s monthly regular meeting?

198
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,110
Is Baby Seven going?

199
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,910
Alright, I’m coming.

200
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,740
I’m going to meet Baby Seven.

201
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,590
Jealous?

202
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:44,950
See you later.

203
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:46,700
No, wait.

204
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,910
I’m not seeing you later.

205
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,860
You met a fan in real life?

206
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,180
A devoted fan.

207
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,310
Loved my work.

208
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,390
She’s loyal to Baby Seven.

209
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,470
And she’s the cousin of Ji Yanxin.

210
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:03,660
Congratulations.

211
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,310
The troublemaker has become your fan.

212
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,860
Maybe she can be your wingman, too.

213
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,380
You can never trust the words

214
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,750
of a passionate fan.

215
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,310
Long time no see,
distinguished Baby Seven.

216
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,790
Distinguished?

217
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,420
After the meeting,

218
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,180
do you want to join us

219
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:18,950
for dinner?

220
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,740
Well, dinner?

221
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,020
It’s settled then.

222
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,190
We’ll come for you later when
it’s finished.

223
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,430
Embarrassing.

224
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,700
You heard that?
They called me distinguished.

225
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,110
They invited me to dinner, too.

226
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,950
Is it right for them to support me?

227
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,470
Do you really not know
that you’re very popular now?

228
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,590
Don’t you check the ranking now?

229
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,060
Now, Dress for the Beauty is

230
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,350
the first.

231
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,140
If it goes well,

232
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,700
you’ll soon beat Lu Qingwu

233
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,390
on the Monthly and Yearly Works.

234
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,820
Let alone you’re the most expected

235
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,620
rising star of MC.

236
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,590
Let alone they want to know you.

237
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,220
Other comics companies

238
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,470
are paying attentions on you, too.

239
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,070
The boss has said

240
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,540
that when it’s necessary,

241
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,790
he’d make you a pair of golden
leg cuffs with diamonds,

242
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,390
so that you don’t run.

243
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,510
The boss has a weird taste.

244
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:11,950
That’s his exact words.

245
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,180
Have you never

246
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,580
met with our boss?

247
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,420
Never.

248
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,970
He’s very interested in you now.

249
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,270
Hello, Mr. Shao.

250
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,030
Hello, Mr. Shao.

251
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,030
Hello, Mr. Shao.

252
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,910
Hello, Mr. Shao.

253
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,830
That’s the boss.

254
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,150
He looks pretty earnest
and serious, right?

255
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,700
But privately he’s

256
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,030
a bit childish and friendly.

257
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,110
Mr. Shao, she’s already here.

258
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:49,870
Thank you.

259
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,070
Sorry for keep you waiting, Miss Lu.

260
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,590
That’s okay.

261
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,190
Let’s be frank and clear then.

262
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,390
Have you taken our offer?

263
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,580
I’m wondering,

264
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,940
if in the guise of cooperating

265
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,580
with Rongpin

266
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,230
to hire the hottest new star
of your company,

267
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,670
do you think that Xiao Li would agree?

268
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,620
But Baby Seven

269
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,550
has just started her career,

270
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,350
she got lucky that she
caught up with the trend.

271
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,070
How can you be sure
that she’ll always be famous?

272
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,780
Why don’t you sell her contract
while she’s hot.

273
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,940
It’d also be a benefit maximization
for MC.

274
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:34,710
Isn’t it?

275
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,380
Miss Lu,

276
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,740
no wonder you are specialized
in fantasy comics.

277
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,670
None of your words was realistic.

278
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,700
I’m wondering,

279
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,420
if Baby Seven is as worthless

280
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,150
as you said,

281
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,830
would you come all the way here for her?

282
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,700
You’re very smart.

283
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,910
Frankly speaking,

284
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,350
as for Rongpin’s reputation
in the field of girl manga.

285
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,700
It can possibly attract

286
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,950
the rookie authors.

287
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,460
I came to notice you

288
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,910
due to respect.

289
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,820
Normally I would...

290
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,590
Steal authors from others, right?

291
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,950
You’ve done

292
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,150
plenty of things like this.

293
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,980
But don’t forget,

294
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,310
now you’ve met me,

295
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,710
it won’t be that easy.

296
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,140
Maybe there will be authors

297
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,270
who can resist benefits.

298
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,980
But when it’s about
a better creating environment

299
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,460
and a better platform.

300
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,190
As long as he is an author,

301
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,910
he’ll surely be tempted.

302
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,510
People’s opinions differ.

303
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,830
It’s hard to say.

304
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,270
Come in.

305
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,070
Mr. Shao, Baby Seven is here.

306
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,310
Qi Nian.

307
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:57,990
Miss Lu.

308
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,030
I’ve invited her here for you.

309
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,230
Give it a try.

310
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,990
Meet me in the conference room
when it’s done.

311
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,220
You finally came out.

312
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,510
Is Baby Seven in there?

313
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:26,740
Why are you going in?

314
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,870
There’s a battle going on.

315
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:29,950
Have a seat.

316
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,270
So you are the author
of Dress for the Beauty.

317
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,390
No wonder Shao Zui was confident
that you won’t go with me.

318
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,710
Sorry for disappointing you.

319
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,510
It’s fine.

320
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,990
I don’t mind trying again.

321
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,670
It’s impossible.

322
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,630
What?

323
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,110
Lu Qingwu came to steal Baby Seven?

324
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,790
Why didn’t you stop it?

325
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,830
You even let them meet.

326
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:04,150
Have you lost your mind?

327
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,470
Don’t worry.

328
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,460
Baby Seven won’t go with her

329
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,870
no matter what she offers.

330
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,350
But...

331
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,750
But she can seduce him.

332
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:19,030
Lu Qingwu is famous for it.

333
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,660
She has successfully seduced

334
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,350
all the authors
that she’s interested in.

335
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,060
Let alone Baby Seven is a boy.

336
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,980
He’s a straight guy who can’t resist

337
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,390
girls like her at all.

338
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,790
Have you met Baby Seven?

339
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,430
Sounds like you know it well.

340
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,070
No.

341
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,230
You can judge by his paintings.

342
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,550
You see,

343
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,950
an author

344
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,860
who creates funny comics like

345
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,710
Boyfriend Who Lives In My Head.

346
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,590
If the author is a girl,

347
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,420
how strong her boyfriend should be

348
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,990
for these two to connect?

349
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:57,030
I think you’re totally right.

350
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,860
Baby Seven has created
a new girl manga,

351
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,710
do you know?

352
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,390
What?

353
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:19,030
Why does the male character
look like...?

354
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,950
Come on, say it out loud.

355
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,190
Looks like whom?

356
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,140
I’m afraid that

357
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,950
this straight author

358
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,390
is having a crush on my cousin.

359
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,820
I’m shocked by

360
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,630
how you understand it.

361
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,750
So,

362
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,670
a new character came in

363
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,470
between you two

364
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,860
which creates a love triangle based

365
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:47,710
on my cousin?

366
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,340
So what does Baby Seven look like?

367
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,190
Handsome?

368
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,180
Not as handsome as me.

369
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,350
But, I’d say he’s a pretty boy.

370
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,870
Really?

371
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,550
Then I want to see him.

372
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,310
Listen to see who this is.

373
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,590
Don’t you want to hear
about my offer first?

374
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,790
Not everyone can be as
supportive as Rongpin.

375
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,390
If you miss it,

376
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,270
you may regret it for life.

377
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,950
My biggest regret would be knowing you.

378
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,790
You chose to quit this field,

379
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,590
no one forced you.

380
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:22,710
Yes.

381
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,140
So, let’s be strangers since now.

382
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,340
I don’t really need your help.

383
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,260
Rongpin

384
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,150
doesn’t need an author
with a bad history, either.

385
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:38,220
Isn’t she...?

386
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,110
Yes, she’s Qi Nian.

387
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,430
But I just...

388
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,470
Mr. Shao.

389
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,270
You’re done?

390
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,470
Seems like she didn’t get
what she wants.

391
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,860
As long as MC doesn’t kick me out,

392
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:05,830
I won’t leave.

393
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,150
Take a seat.

394
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,310
Actually,
I’d like to ask about Prof. Ji.

395
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,630
I think you know what’s bothering him.

396
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,630
Well,

397
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,510
there’s something.

398
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,910
You know Ji Yanxin.

399
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,100
His personality

400
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,430
is not so charming.

401
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,110
So even people who are close to him

402
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,230
can’t stand him sometimes.

403
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,100
There was

404
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,070
a person who he cared about so much

405
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,430
left him.

406
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,230
He condemned

407
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,310
himself for it for long.

408
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:50,700
So, every time he thinks

409
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,870
of this relationship,

410
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,150
he’d be deeply anxious.

411
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,470
I think,

412
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,390
that’s his only problem.

413
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,230
I see.

414
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,790
Shao Zui, what are you talking about?

415
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,790
As if my cousin has got
an ex-girlfriend.

416
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,260
So, after hearing this,

417
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,580
do you still want to help?

418
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,030
Of course, I do.

419
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,780
No matter who she is,

420
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,990
it doesn’t matter.

421
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,180
My only wish is for him to cheer up

422
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,150
and relax a little bit.

423
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,390
Sure.

424
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,670
Good luck.

425
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,550
I’ll be back to work, Mr. Shao.

426
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:41,030
You lied again, that’s not a pretty boy.

427
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,630
Is this the point?

428
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,380
So,

429
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,300
the couple thing and all that were fake.

430
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,180
Stop making up stories

431
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,270
in your head, okay?

432
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,300
What?

433
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,150
If it’s a girl, it’s better.

434
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:57,710
Think about it,

435
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,540
my future sister-in-law

436
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,630
is a comics artist.

437
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,420
Her works

438
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,030
portray daily life with my cousin.

439
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,580
What a sweet way to show their love.

440
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,780
Why would I miss it?

441
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,620
It’s much better than

442
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,830
the made-up love stories
between you and him.

443
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:13,910
Fine.

444
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,350
Whatever you say.

445
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:18,900
But what did you mean

446
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,710
by that?

447
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,660
Qi Nian may misunderstand.

448
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,900
That’s the point.

449
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,790
Don’t forget

450
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,060
the best part

451
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,430
of being a fan of a couple.

452
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:32,420
Misunderstanding, obstacle and drama.

453
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,190
That’s right.

454
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,100
You’re an evil.

455
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:35,990
I’m not that good.

456
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,100
I think,

457
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,950
I’m just a meddler in between.

458
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:51,860
There was

459
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,830
a person who he cared about so much

460
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,190
left him.

461
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,990
He condemned

462
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,910
himself for it for long.

463
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,820
So, every time he thinks

464
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,990
of this relationship,

465
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,070
he’d be deeply anxious.

466
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,030
I think,

467
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,270
that’s his only problem.

468
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,710
Where can I find his ex back?

469
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,430
Even if I can,

470
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,990
can I ask her to leave
after he gets better?

471
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,750
There are clothes in the closet,

472
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,030
go and get it yourself.

473
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:07,220
Qi...

474
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:07,940
Siqi.

475
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,620
How’s the packing going?

476
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,000
Ma’am, I’m busy with other things.

477
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,020
If you have too many stuffs,

478
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,470
I can help organize.

479
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,060
Qi Nian

480
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,700
never answered my call yesterday.

481
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,700
Have you told her or not?

482
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,660
Is she in there?

483
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:20,990
She’s there.

484
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,020
Don’t run.

485
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:25,540
Your luggage.

486
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,150
Do you need me to pack for you?

487
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,370
You made me do it.

488
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,890
I’ll go to the office to find her.

489
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:42,300
I’ll apply the labor laws
for labor arbitration.

490
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,150
I won’t stop complaining.

491
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,740
I knew it,

492
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:05,230
there would be DVDs if there
are souvenir T-shirts.

493
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,870
Your clothes...

494
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,300
Sir,

495
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,270
I found this in your closet.

496
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,910
I didn’t know that you like
Spirited Away, too.

497
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,990
You don’t say.

498
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,750
I don’t like childish things.

499
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:56,910
Childish?

500
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,460
This movie is a classic.

501
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,230
It conveys many people’s memories.

502
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,220
When Chihiro and Kohakunushi flied
to the sky hand in hand

503
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,190
with tears dripping down in the sky.

504
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,820
Sir, don’t you feel anything?

505
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:08,550
No.

506
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,070
I don’t like animation.

507
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,470
Let alone it’s a made-up universe.

508
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,620
Don’t you have a childhood?

509
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,950
What’s wrong with made-up stuffs?

510
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,300
You’re not young anymore.

511
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,310
Why do you still like this
kind of things?

512
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,810
Do you want to stay a child forever?

513
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:24,980
I love animations!

514
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:25,750
Go away!

515
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,670
You are not liking them.
You’re obsessed.

516
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,830
All of these are just spiritual opium.

517
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,430
Don’t try to take them back.

518
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:34,750
Give them back!

519
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,620
Living in this world,

520
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,940
there gotta be a few Utopias
to believe in

521
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:39,910
when we need comfort.

522
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,570
In my eyes, no matter how long
you try to escape from reality,

523
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:45,110
you’ll have to come back eventually.

524
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,820
That’s your way to live.

525
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,100
People need dreams.

526
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,260
Maybe miracles will happen.

527
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,420
For example,

528
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,780
trying to make you my boyfriend

529
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,420
seems impossible,

530
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,590
but what if it comes true some day?

531
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:58,630
Yeah.

532
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:00,950
Some day.

533
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,540
Are you mocking me for daydreaming?

534
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,260
Thinking that I’m too childish
and hilarious?

535
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,230
But you read Grimm’s Fairy Tales, too.

536
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,580
No, there’s danger, I can’t go in.

537
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,670
You won’t admit it when you’re awake.

538
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,230
Don’t look, don’t look, don’t look.

539
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,940
So, the reason why it’s empty outside

540
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,500
is that he kept the things he likes

541
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,910
in here.

542
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:27,790
All versions of Grimm’s Fairy Tales.

543
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:38,860
(Blue Beard)

544
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:49,230
Are you asleep or awake?

545
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,340
Please go back to normal
when you’re back to your room.

546
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,020
How can I drag you

547
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,950
up to the second floor by myself?

548
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:01,300
Sir,

549
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,020
I have things to pack at home.

550
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,150
I’ll go now, see you.

551
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,110
When did you see it?

552
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,590
No, I didn’t.

553
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,390
Tell me or I’ll throw you
into the water.

554
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,420
Okay, okay, okay.

555
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,750
You brought me in last time
you sleepwalked.

556
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,030
You saw them all?

557
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:32,900
Sir,

558
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,580
I didn’t mean to break the rules.

559
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,350
I don’t blame you.

560
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,620
Nothing special in there,

561
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,500
just come books and decorations.

562
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,900
But you’d go in whenever

563
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,990
you’re stressed.

564
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,270
Are they very important to you?

565
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,230
Hello?

566
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,340
Boss,

567
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,020
Mr. Pei has called again.

568
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,100
He said he lost contact with his friend

569
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,140
for over 24 hours.

570
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,550
He’s suing us for illegal employment.

571
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,470
Got it.

572
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,620
I need you to go on a business trip,

573
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,620
no need to bring anything.

574
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,750
Set off immediately tomorrow.

575
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,430
A temporary business trip?

576
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,110
Do you not want to?

577
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,540
I do, I do.

578
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,590
I’m totally fine.

579
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,820
I’d be thrilled to work with you

580
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:25,790
for 24 hours.

581
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,020
(My Crush)

582
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,860
(My Crush)

583
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,190
Hi, Qi Nian. You finally call back.

584
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,300
Siqi, I’m sorry.

585
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,110
I’m temporarily going to
the south of city with boss.

586
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,030
He did it on purpose!

587
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,420
No.

588
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,700
I’m setting off now.

589
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,420
We’ll talk about the comics’ outline

590
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,790
when I get back, okay?

591
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,430
Talk later, bye-bye.

592
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,140
You asked me to dig into Key,

593
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,700
I’ve sent the file to you.

594
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,950
This guy is pretty famous
in the fan circle.

595
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:20,070
But he’s never been a professional.

596
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,350
These are his works.

597
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,430
It doesn’t look like he paid others
to paint for him.

598
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,190
Sign him.

599
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,190
It’ll probably take some days.

600
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,430
Key doesn’t show up a lot.

601
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,830
It’s not easy to get in touch with him.

602
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,660
Xiao Li, you’re a successful agent.

603
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,780
There are hundreds of ways

604
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,460
for you to get his contact.

605
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:39,540
I need the result.

606
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,630
Cut out the nonsense.

607
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,750
Hi, little fan.

608
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,350
What a coincidence.

609
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,390
How come it’s you again?

610
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,780
Where are you going?

611
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,630
Let me give you a ride.

612
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,100
No, thanks.

613
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,390
I don’t think you’re that kind.

614
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,070
Why can’t I get a taxi...

615
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,190
Why haven’t you worked
in the coffee shop lately?

616
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,380
Leave me alone.

617
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,820
I’m going to City South.
Are we going in the same direction?

618
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:13,950
Go away if not.

619
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,510
City South?

620
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,310
What for?

621
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,150
Why do you care?

622
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,140
I was going to say

623
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,150
that I can drive you to
the South Station.

624
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,270
Never mind.

625
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,110
City South, let’s go.

626
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,190
I don’t want to give you a ride now.

627
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,230
Are you messing with me?

628
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,550
I think you’re very funny.

629
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,150
Stop it.

630
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,780
Even if you stuck here all day,

631
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:00,790
I won’t drive you there.

632
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,510
Be nice when talking to a pretty lady.

633
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,230
You want things from me now.

634
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,710
What’s your attitude
when you need a favor?

635
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,620
Do you think that I want to?

636
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,420
I’m stuck.

637
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,630
What’s with the car?

638
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,700
(Call me if anything)

639
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:28,460
(Basic Information Pseudonym: Key)

640
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,110
Are you investigating me?

641
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,230
Give it back.

642
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,300
Don’t think that you can threaten me

643
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,310
after you know who I am.

644
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,150
So you’re Key.

645
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:40,910
Stop it.

646
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,260
No matter what you want from me,

647
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,390
I won’t agree.

648
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,910
I’ve changed my mind.

649
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,190
I can give you a ride to City South.

650
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,140
Playing phone in a car.

651
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,430
How good your eyesight is?

652
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,220
Sir,

653
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,460
I just saw something very funny.

654
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:23,140
Someone said

655
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,590
that the best way to cure sleepwalking

656
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,750
is to relax oneself.

657
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,300
I found some jokes.

658
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,550
Let me read them to you.

659
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,460
One day,

660
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:40,030
Zhang Fei and Guan Yu
went out riding horses.

661
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,850
Suddenly they saw a cliff,

662
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:43,860
Guan Yu was having too much fun

663
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,020
that he didn’t see it.

664
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,740
So Zhang Fei shouted in the behind,

665
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,660
Guan Yu, stop the horse!
[*Similar to “Are you happy” in Chinese]

666
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:51,670
Guan Yu said: “Yes, I am!”

667
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,350
And?

668
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,470
That’s it.

669
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,260
So this is not funny to you.

670
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,740
Move on to next one.

671
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,620
This is a brain twister.

672
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,580
Who knows its mind the most

673
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,910
in Harry Potter?

674
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,030
Sir,

675
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,510
don’t tell me that you never read it.

676
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,500
Your childhood is so...

677
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,460
Hermione, she’s got the best grade.

678
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,670
No, it’s Voldemort.

679
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,620
Because

680
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:25,180
he won’t be led by the nose

681
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,070
since he doesn’t have one.

682
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,830
Not funny, either?

683
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,940
If you’re trying to make me relax.

684
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,670
The best way would be shutting up.

685
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,470
Prof. Ji, was it funny?

686
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,070
Qi Nian.

687
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,110
Go and sit in the back.

688
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:16,230
Stop talking until we arrive.

689
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,300
I thought we’re going to City South.

690
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,870
Why are we in the field?

691
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,710
Is it the right way?

692
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,070
Why did you stop, did we go wrong?

693
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,350
To officially introduce myself,

694
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,900
I’m Rongpin’s chief comics artist

695
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,150
as well as comics producer, Lu Qingwu.

696
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,460
I’ve already known it.

697
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,870
So we did go wrong?

698
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,670
I’ve seen your work.

699
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:13,980
I admire

700
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,750
your talent in girl manga.

701
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,030
I’m looking forward to cooperating
with you.

702
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,310
If possible,

703
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,510
I’d like you to join my team.

704
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,620
Admiring my talent?

705
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,270
That’s not what I heard
at last interview.

706
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,310
Well,

707
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,340
see it as

708
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,430
a small accident before we met.

709
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,750
How about letting it go?

710
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:36,820
You disapproved me a lot
in the signing session, too.

711
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,620
I didn’t hold grudges.

712
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,590
I wasn’t wrong.

713
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:41,460
It was purely my direct expression

714
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,220
that I hate you.

715
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,470
I can let it go,

716
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,190
just finish Thither Cloud.

717
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:52,340
Come on,

718
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,190
why are we talking about that book?

719
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,190
I’m a fan of it, okay?

720
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,900
Do you know what it’s like

721
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:58,870
to wait for a book?

722
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,590
Five years.

723
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,820
The ants would’ve finished half
of a marathon.

724
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,460
And you didn’t continue it.

725
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,030
How dare you to call yourself an author?

726
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:07,230
Get off.

727
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,180
Fine.

728
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,910
Who’d want to sit in your stupid car?

729
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,470
Nice shoes, are they water-proof?

730
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,230
Go away.

731
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,620
Go away?

732
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,220
I will, I’ve got wheels.

733
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,380
In this middle of nowhere,

734
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,820
you can crawl back

735
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:29,830
using both hands and feet.

736
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,030
Bye.

737
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:39,870
You...!

738
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,420
I wish you a flat tire,

739
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,670
a leaking tank and a blackmailer!

740
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,420
How lucky you are.

741
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,900
Your car is smoking.

742
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:04,230
It’s very impressive.

743
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,220
I did it on purpose.

744
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,710
Its underpan is too low,
I’ve always wanted to get rid of it.

745
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,660
I’ve got thousands of ways
to leave here.

746
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,780
Don’t think I’m naive

747
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,870
as you are.

748
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,430
Where are the thousands of ways?

749
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,230
You actually made me

750
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:36,790
believe that you’d turn to
a butterfly and fly away.

751
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:39,380
Who knows you’d stand still

752
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,630
to cosplay a telegraph pole.

753
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,300
Give it up.

754
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,420
A place of nowhere.

755
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:49,070
Having signals or not depends on luck.

756
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,910
Do you have signals?

757
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,140
With you here,

758
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,580
the signals within a kilometer

759
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,220
got much weaker.

760
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,350
Is it even possible?

761
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,180
So what if I don’t have signals?

762
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,740
As long as people pass by,

763
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,780
there’s no doubt
I can get on their cars.

764
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,950
You’re welcome to try.

765
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,710
Seems like you’ve forgotten
that we’re here for work.

766
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:21,550
Sir,

767
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,580
can we walk around here

768
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,180
when work is finished?

769
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,500
Five meetings within three days.

770
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,300
Do you think we’d have a chance

771
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,270
to walk out of the conference room?

772
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,380
Unless work is done in advance.

773
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,230
Really?

774
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,870
It’s very unlikely.

775
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,470
It’s okay.

776
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,060
I’m here, too.

777
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,940
Together we can make a good team.

778
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,180
Just go and do your job,

779
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,710
I’ll take care of having fun.

780
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,150
I’ll be in charge of meetings
and you’ll deal with the fun part?

781
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,100
(Sky Wheel Summer Cultural Festival
Fireworks Display)

782
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,220
Prof. Ji, Prof. Ji.

783
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,510
Hurry.

784
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,940
Oh my god, fireworks display!

785
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,380
It’s tonight.

786
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,500
Let’s do it today.

787
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,700
Let’s go tonight and see it.

788
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,380
We don’t have

789
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,620
meetings arranged anyway.

790
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,420
Okay?

791
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,150
No meetings, but we need to work late.

792
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:07,300
If I’m not finished at work,

793
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,500
no chance for you to play.

794
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,540
Plus, I don’t like fireworks.

795
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,260
Why not?

796
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:13,420
Because they disappear quickly
after its shining moments?

797
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,830
Because it’s not safe.
