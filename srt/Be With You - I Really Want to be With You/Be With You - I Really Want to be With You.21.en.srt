Flower and Romance

is undoubtedly the best girl manga IP.

22
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,480
The investment risk

23
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,480
is much lower than other works.

24
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:51,990
So please

25
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,610
reconsider it.

26
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,840
What’s more there to say?

27
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,320
Don’t you see it?

28
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,440
She has an ideal choice.

29
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,600
Since her taste is poor,

30
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,400
there’s no need to say more.

31
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,560
Let’s go.

32
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,800
Ms. Pei, I’m sorry.

33
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,240
Ms. Pei, are you OK?

34
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:13,760
Yes, I’m fine.

35
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,610
Sorry for your clothes.

36
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,120
Let me pay for it.

37
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,160
I said I’m fine.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,600
Excuse me, I have an appointment.

39
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:25,680
See you.

40
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,640
Bring me some clothes.

41
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,920
Postpone the meeting for an hour

42
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,760
or until tomorrow.

43
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,680
Did I just make a terrible mistake?

44
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:41,780
I don’t think so.

45
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,840
Given enough time,

46
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,480
we’ll have a shot to bring a turnabout.

47
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,040
What’s your plan?

48
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,320
Not my plan, but yours.

49
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,200
Qi Nian is no longer

50
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,080
an innocent girl as she was.

51
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,240
She’s a rival we have to defeat, got it?

52
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,000
Postponed?

53
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,880
I’m so sorry.

54
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,560
Ms. Pei had an accident.

55
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,720
Maybe at another time?

56
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:13,840
It’s OK.

57
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,800
We’ll be there.

58
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,800
Tell her we’ll be there.

59
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,240
OK.

60
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,420
Come on.

61
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,920
Excuse me, sir.

62
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,840
Where are you taking our hotshot?

63
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,680
Private contact is not allowed.

64
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,200
Enough.

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You love hosting, don’t you?

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,760
How was it?

67
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,370
I did a great job, didn’t I?

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,960
The once hostile little girl

69
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,090
has learnt her tricks.

70
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,240
If Shao Zui were here,

71
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,680
he’d become emotional.

72
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,400
Oh, did he contact you?

73
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,000
Yeah, he asked me out.

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,560
I almost forgot.

75
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,700
(Dress for the Beauty
Baby Seven’s Autograph Session)

76
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,360
You know Ms. Pei?

77
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,120
You know her too.

78
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,920
Don’t worry. You’ll see.

79
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,400
Let’s go.

80

81
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,050
Hello?

82
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,080
I’m here.

83
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,000
Where are you?

84
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,280
You’re here?

85
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,800
Yeah.

86
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,400
I dash out for the appointment

87
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,680
once the session was over.

88
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,640
How could you stand me up?

89
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,120
You got stood up?

90
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,080
Why didn’t I know?

91
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,080
You refuse to admit it?

92
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,240
I’ll make a video for you.

93
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,560
Sweetie,

94
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,840
do you remember what day it is?

95
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,960
You’re so nagging.

96
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,840
It’s Monday, isn’t it?

97
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:57,060
(Happy Birthday)

98
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,760
You remember now?

99
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,520
My birthday.

100
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,680
Unbelievable,

101
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,560
how could you forget that?

102
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,560
That’s heartless of you.

103
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,320
I was too committed to work.

104
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,280
It’s a compliment.

105
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,600
My boss is finally

106
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,440
independent.

107
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,760
Do I get a reward for that?

108
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,000
Happy birthday.

109
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,040
Happy birthday.

110
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,520
Thank you.

111
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,800
Why don’t you eat?

112
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,600
Am I so ugly

113
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,640
that I spoil your appetite?

114
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,240
On the contrary,

115
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,400
I think my boss

116
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,800
has become a feast for the eyes.

117
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,080
Gross.

118
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,080
I made the fried rice.

119
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,000
It’s a plot.

120
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,680
Goodness.

121
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,280
Still tastes so unpleasant.

122
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:31,680
I’m serious.

123
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,760
I had a doubt

124
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,520
that you lost your taste. Right?

125
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,280
I did. You’re right.

126
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:39,920
Really?

127
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,760
You really have ageusia?

128
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,920
What happened?

129
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,600
Is it congenital

130
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,320
or caused by illness?

131
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,800
It’s an accident.

132
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,400
But that was a decade ago.

133
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,840
Tell me. I’m curious.

134
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,200
You wanna know?

135
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,440
It’s not a big deal,

136
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,080
nothing but

137
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,240
an accident

138
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,200
at about your age.

139
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,080
Anyway, it’s gone.

140
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,400
Though I still suffer from sequelae,

141
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,200
it’s recovering slowly.

142
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,720
It’s unacceptable.

143
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,800
I have no appetite

144
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,840
for this dog food.

145
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,720
Isn’t it a huge progress compared

146
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,880
with what you called garbage?

147
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,480
Really?

148
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,600
Now that you’re full,

149
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,800
would it be better to do some exercise?

150
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,880
Look,

151
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,040
everything in this building

152
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,680
that you can see or touch,

153
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,240
anything that you like,

154
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,520
I’ll buy it for you.

155
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,800
So the exercise is...

156
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,600
Don’t save money for me.

157
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,240
Anything that you like.

158
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,760
Really?

159
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,800
I’ll be waiting by the cashier.

160
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:08,960
Bye-bye.

161
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,760

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,280
This isn’t the only birthday I’ll have.

176
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,800
I’ll have another next year.

177
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,440
Why would I poop myself out?

178
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:09,880
Next year...

179
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,000
Next year, it’ll be another man

180
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,800
who pays the bills for you.

181
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,960
It’s soon to midnight.

182
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,720
What else do you want to do?

183
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,480
Well,

184
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,240
there’s one last thing to do

185
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,800
to celebrate my coming of age.

186
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,020
Are you referring to...?

187
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,160
Come on. The clock is ticking.

188
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,200
We need to find a place.

189
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,800
Do I have to go with you?

190
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,760
Of course.

191
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,920
It’s a game for two.

192
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,280
Ji Qiu, calm down. Calm down.

193
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,680
You’re not an adult in two hours.

194
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,440
Don’t play with fire.

195
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,200
The goods. You forgot the goods.

196
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,280
Yes. Right.

197
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,440
Come on. Let’s go.

198
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,270
It’s getting late.

199
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,080
Making cakes is not playing with fire.

200
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,720
I wonder what you’re thinking.

201
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,480
Right.

202
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,560
I overestimated your cognitive ability.

203
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:02,270
My god.

204
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:02,880
(Ji Qiu)

205
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,760
(Ji Qiu)
What did you write down?

206
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,600
Don’t tell anyone else

207
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,320
that I taught you to write.

208
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,600
How dare you bring it up?

209
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,120
How long haven’t you taught me?

210
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,360
Hand.

211
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,120
What?

212
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,240
Tutoring.

213
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,480
Dot before you draw left.

214
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,760
Right before left.

215
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,860
(Shao Zui)

216
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,120
Vice versa.

217
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:51,940
(Shao Zui)

218
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,800
This is my name.

219
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,320
Got it?

220
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:03,920
Alright.

221
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,640
(Ji Qiu)
Wish you a happy and smooth life.

222
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,640
Lame.

223
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,360
As long as it comes true.

224
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,440
In plain language.

225
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,120
In your vocabulary, it should be,

226
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,040
“May you take a journey full of blooms

227
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,840
so you won’t see the harsh life.”

228
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,760
Power outage?

229
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,040
Tripping maybe?

230
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:37,800
Perfect timing.

231
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,560
It’s OK. Come.

232
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:40,760
Make a wish.

233
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,440
Why bother?

234
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,440
All I need to do

235
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,520
is to tell you what I want.

236
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,120
Sometimes, you need a little luck.

237
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,240
I won’t be your Aladdin

238
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,160
for all my life.

239
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:52,960
Why?

240
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,760
I have my life.

241
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,000
I’ll get married.

242
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,280
I...

243
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,560
I never forbade you from marrying.

244
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,640
But...

245
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,680
But you can’t before 60 years old.

246
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,580
I’m not your idol.

247
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,740
You can’t be serious.

248
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,720
Your boss hasn’t had a relationship.

249
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,800
How could you jump start?

250
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,320
You can have one.

251
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,000
Starting tomorrow,

252
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,640
you can have a romantic relationship.

253
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,480
I won’t be in your way.

254
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,080
What’s wrong?

255
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,840
Too happy to say a word?

256
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,600
Why isn’t the power back on?

257
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,240
I’ll take a look.

258
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:33,760
Don’t go.

259
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,720
I haven’t blown out the candle.

260
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,400
My sweater is expensive.

261
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,760
You’re so weird. Why are you angry?

262
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,600
Cut it out.

263
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,320
What are you doing?

264
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,000
That was an accident.

265
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,920
The hell it was.

266
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,720
Boss, just take it

267
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,880
as a courtesy.

268
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,440
Don’t let it be a bother.

269
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,840
The hell courtesy.

270
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:08,920
Be responsible for this.

271
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,600
Be responsible for this.

272
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,280
Still angry?

273
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,040
What do you want?

274
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,080
Whatever you wanna say, get it out.

275
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,760
You have 30 seconds.

276
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,280
Happy birthday.

277
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,640
You’re 20. It’s not easy.

278
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,160
You can do whatever you want now.

279
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,240
If you meet a nice man,

280
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,840
don’t let him go.

281
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,600
I believe

282
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,320
you’ll be great.

283
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,280
Why do you make it sentimental?

284
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,480
Are you gonna die?

285
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,600
If you think I’ll forgive you for that,

286
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,520
you’re wrong.

287
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,320
I demand you

288
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,120
to forget about what happened today.

289
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,320
I will.

290
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:28,520
OK.

291
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,400
Time is up.

292
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:31,720
I’ve finished.

293
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,320
Good night.

294
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,080
Shao Zui,

295
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,560
thank you for accompanying me
on my birthday.

296
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,480
But, in the meantime,

297
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,520
you’ll pay

298
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,840
for upsetting me.

299
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,080
Got it.

300
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,040
See you tomorrow.

301
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,320
OK.

302
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,560
See you...

303
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,520
tomorrow.

304
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,120
What brings you here?

305
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,040
Don’t you want to see me?

306
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,160
It’s been days.

307
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,920
They mistreated me.

308
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,360
I want it back.

309
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,040
What trouble have you run into?

310
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:37,720
It’s a disaster.

311
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,720
I offended a hidden boss yesterday

312
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,640
and screwed a huge deal.

313
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,240
Xiao Li gave me tons

314
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,360
of craps for it.

315
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,560
I’m so tired.

316
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,050
Hidden boss? Who?

317
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,720
It’s a long story.

318
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,120
A middle-aged witch.

319
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,680
Baby,

320
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,760
isn’t the shirt

321
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,880
oversized for you?

322
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,760
Look, the sleeves are long.

323
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,280
Look...

324
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:05,920
Well...

325
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,120
How could you cheat on me

326
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,180
with another woman?

327
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,860
What does she mean?

328
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,990
Who is this woman?

329
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,080
No, no. Listen to me. She...

330
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,880
Shut up.

331
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,950
Men are all liars.

332
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,270
Ji Siqi,

333
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,440
how could you do that?

334
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,880
If you want a lover, I’m all yours.

335
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,920
She’s as old

336
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,280
as your mom.

337
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,290
She is my mom.

338
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,140
Mom,

339
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,600
what are you doing here?

340
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,000
Mom?

341
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:58,900
Sons,

342
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,920
swap your places.

343
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,440
Swap your places.

344
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,240
Much better now.

345
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,440
Wait. Um... Mom...

346
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,560
Don’t interrupt me.

347
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,720
How does it feel to speak out your love?

348
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,120
Well, good.

349
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,400
So you’re at the autograph session.

350
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,960
What a show! I have to be there.

351
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:40,600
Your girlfriend?

352
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,080
Yeah.

353
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,480
Don’t you think your age gap is too big?

354
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,200
Miss,

355
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,280
you must be the beautiful girl

356
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,160
with a gentle voice, right?

357
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,800
That’s sweet.

358
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,840
While you’re taciturn.

359
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,960
What a waste!

360
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,780
And you!

361
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,960
Didn’t I tell you

362
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,400
to stay away from weird women?

363
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:05,040
See?

364
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,120
She’s come to take advantage of you.

365
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,920
Why didn’t you push her away?

366
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,840
Who took advantage of him?

367
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,440
She’s my girlfriend.

368
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,480
-What?
-What?

369
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:25,880
Come here.

370
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,200
Sit.

371
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,880
You like Siqi, don’t you?

372
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,360
Or maybe Siqi likes you, doesn’t he?

373
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,240
Mom, what are you talking about?

374
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,400
Or maybe your love is unrequited,

375
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,800
so you turn to someone else.

376
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,160
As to your brother,

377
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,200
either he steps in and takes her

378
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,480
or meets her by sheer blind chance.

379
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,280
Otherwise who would fall in love

380
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,000
with a man of his temperament?

381
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,560
Siqi, come here.

382
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:03,720
Come on.

383
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,520
Come here.

384
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,400
Come on.

385
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,680
Sit down.

386
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,760
I think

387
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,640
you two are perfect for each other.

388
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,640
Are you done?

389
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:21,960
Mom,

390
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,160
have you had enough
with your match-making?

391
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,520
Yeah, enough of it.

392
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,280
Look at you two.

393
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,720
You’re perfect for a duet.

394
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,880
Wouldn’t you consider each other?

395
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,000
What about you two?

396
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,320
No, thanks.

397
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,160
It’s true an outsider sees it clearer

398
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,880
if a man and a woman are suitable.

399
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,560
They’re not in the least suitable.

400
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,480
As for you,

401
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,040
do you really know

402
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,120
the girl by your side?

403
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,600
Or she’s just a substitute?

404
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:57,760
Ms. Pei,

405
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,800
I know you have a bad impression of me.

406
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,680
But my love to Siqi

407
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:03,760
is serious.

408
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,680
How can you prove it?

409
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:11,960
What do you suggest?

410
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,120
Lovers vlog.

411
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,440
What for?

412
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,640
I want to see how you

413
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,560
get along in private.

414
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,640
Well, I don’t

415
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,600
have any other skills.

416
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,960
But as to if two are playing lovers

417
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,680
on camera or truly in love,

418
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,760
I can see it.

419
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,720
Alright. Go make the vlog.

420
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,040
A dating video for at least ten hours.

421
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,680
What?

422
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,040
The winning couple

423
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:43,800
will have my blessings.

424
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,480
OK?

425
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,200
Morning, Ji Qiu.

426
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,040
Morning.

427
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:53,760
Morning, Ji Qiu.

428
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,440
Morning.

429
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:06,760
Morning, Ji Qiu.

430
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,240
Morning.

431
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,440
Are you awake?

432
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,520
If you’re not,

433
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,520
I’ll show you how I look

434
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,800
on the first day of my twentieth.

435
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,760
Waiting for the first praise from you.

436
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,940
(Waiting for the first praise from you.)

437
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,560
That’s odd.

438
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,880
He usually replies fast.

439
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,000
What took him so long today?

440
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,120
Ji Qiu,

441
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,560
you’re early today.

442
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:01,800
Morning, editor,

443
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,120
You finally gain

444
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,960
a taste for clothes.

445
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,440
Thanks, editor.

446
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,760
Oh, Mr. Shao’s office called.

447
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,120
They need you there now.

448
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,280
OK, I’ll be on my way.

449
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,280
Go on.

450
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,830
I know

451
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,440
he wouldn’t ignore my text.

452
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,840
He must want to praise me face to face.

453
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,440
Hello!

454
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,040
You must be Miss Ji Qiu.

455
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,120
It’s Shao Zui’s office.

456
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,480
I’m not in the wrong place.

457
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,520
No, you’re not.

458
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,920
I’m Mr. Shao’s attorney.

459
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,080
I’m here

460
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,360
to announce an agreement
on the transfer of shares.

461
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,080
Here you are.

462
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:43,920
Shares?

463
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:45,920
What does that mean?

464
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,040
(MC Comics Company)
In short,

465
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,000
(Agreement on the Transfer of Shares)
Mr. Shao Zui would like to give

466
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,520
all his shares to you, Miss Ji Qiu.

467
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,560
In another word,

468
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,520
when you sign this agreement,

469
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,640
you’ll become MC’s largest shareholder,

470
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,480
and Chairman of the Board.

471
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,600
Gosh, so cute.

472
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,480
I think you’re cute.

473
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,160
Why are we doing it in a pet store?

474
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,360
Because I want to cuddle a cat.

475
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,000
This one?

476
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:28,600
The bigger one.

477
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,800
You’re so cute.

478
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,360
Get your hands off me. It’s in public.

479
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:48,960
I’ll use my lips then.

480
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,080
Knock it off. I’m recording.

481
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:51,920
Turn it off.

482
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,040
Just record the sound.

483
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,800
You have a recorder with you?

484
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,280
Shut up.

485
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,480
Hey!

486
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,280
What are you doing in public?

487
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,760
Do you have the right to accuse us?

488
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,480
Running into you guys.

489
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,280
So unlucky.

490
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:32,800
Well...

491
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,440
Since we’re here for the same purpose,

492
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,320
let’s finish it and hand it in.

493
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,240
Siqi,

494
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,440
do you really want your mom’s blessing?

495
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:47,880
Yes.

496
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:51,820
What does that mean?

497
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,600
Don’t we look like a couple?

498
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,720
Not at all.

499
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,400
You think you’re perfect for each other?

500
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,200
Either you like it or not,

501
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,040
Qi Nian will be your sister-in-law.

502
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,000
Yanxin.

503
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,160
Siqi, come with me.

504
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:08,640
OK.

505
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,360
Are you serious with Siqi?

506
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,080
No.

507
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,120
I just want to take him,

508
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,000
his body and his heart.

509
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,760
When I’m tired of him, I’ll dump him.

510
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,480
Happy?

511
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:25,800
You won’t.

512
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:28,800
You trust me?

513
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,880
I trust Siqi.

514
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,280
He isn’t an idiot.

515
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,160
He can tell if it’s true love.

516
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,110
Can he?

517
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,000
Do you think he likes me?

518
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,000
Yes, he does.

519
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,080
But you don’t deserve him.

520
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,040
Do you have to be so mean?

521
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,000
Do you expect me

522
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,440
to be nice after what you did to me?

523
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:52,960
OK.

524
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,760
Let’s make it clear this time.

525
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,960
You betrayed me first.

526
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,240
Now you come to accuse me?

527
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,000
Are you talking about yourself?

528
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,600
Or are you confused with your memory?

529
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,560
If you care to listen,

530
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,720
I can tell you

531
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,000
what exactly happened.

532
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,600
Lu Qingwu stole Qi Nian’s authorship?

533
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,120
When?

534
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:21,640
Of which work?

535
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,640
You don’t know who Qi Nian is,

536
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,320
do you?

537
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:33,600
I’ve finished.

538
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,680
If I told you it wasn’t me,

539
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:43,800
would you believe it?

540
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,440
No more justification for yourself.

541
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,840
Since the day you decided to have

542
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,480
Thither Cloud to yourself,

543
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,560
it’s been needless to explain.

544
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,200
No.

545
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,480
You have to let me explain.

546
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,200
But I’m a little confused.

547
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,800
I need time to get it straight.

548
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,560
But before that,

549
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,000
can you keep it from Siqi?

550
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,640
I wasn’t going to tell him.

551
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,960
You sure you want to keep it forever?

552
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,520
As long as he doesn’t leave me,

553
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,320
I will.

554
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:27,800
Regardless,

555
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,480
I’ll give you an answer.

556
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,040
You come right on time.

557
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,080
I have good news for you.

558
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,400
I got a call from the organizers

559
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,360
of the Silver Kylin Award.

560
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,080
We’re nominated for the best comic

561
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:55,680
of the year.

562
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,400
Are we?

563
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,240
What’s wrong with you?

564
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,520
Though you claimed lots of rewards,

565
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,280
you’re not nominated

566
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,640
for this one every year.

567
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,320
Besides,

568
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,560
we got a strong rival, Qi Nian.

569
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,640
But don’t worry.

570
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,840
No one can snatch your spotlight.

571
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,840
She’s an emerging star,

572
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:30,120
but I know how to drag her down.

573
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,240
Like what you did before?

574
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,840
How many secrets do you keep from me?

575
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:45,880
Lu Qingwu,

576
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,760
think about who you’re talking to.

577
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,280
Your boss, your partner.

578
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,320
An ally who makes you

579
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,040
what you are from a nobody.

580
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,160
Who is it about

581
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,120
that makes you yell at me?

582
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,600
Did you set Qi Nian up?

583
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,320
She didn’t sign off with us

584
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,480
or apply for the reward,

585
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,840
or pay people to defame me.

586
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,600
You’re the reason

587
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,080
we turned against each other.

588
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,680
You made me a despicable liar.

589
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,920
Would I call the man who trapped me

590
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,480
an ally?

591
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,280
I made you?

592
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,360
Didn’t you

593
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,000
envy Qi Nian back then?

594
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,440
You would rather

595
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,000
see her as a rival than a friend, right?

596
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I gave you a reason to hate her.

597
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,480
I didn’t.

598
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,880
If you regard her as a friend,

599
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,840
you should support her

600
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,560
when she was condemned online,

601
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,880
instead of hiding abroad.

602
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,360
After years
of burying your head in sand,

603
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,160
now you’re talking about friendship
and conscience.

604
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,200
Are you kidding me?

605
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,320
You don’t get it.

606
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,680
Qi Nian is only a stepping stone.

607
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,240
It doesn’t matter

608
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,720
if you owe her.

609
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,480
Besides, except for us,

610
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,000
no one knows about it.

611
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,440
I did it for your sake.

612
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,040
For my sake?

613
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,320
I’m nothing but a stepping stone,

614
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,720
a cash cow to you.

615
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,360
I don’t need conscience.

616
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,480
I can’t show sympathy for her, right?

617
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,320
Glad that you got it.

618
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,320
Well,

619
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,120
I’ll forget about

620
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:42,720
what you said today.

621
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,760
As long as you let it go,

622
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,400
you’ll still be
the only star of Rongpin,

623
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,800
the champion of girl manga.

624
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,160
Forget it.

625
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,600
From now on,

626
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,200
we’re not allies.

627
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,330
You’re back.

628
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,440
What are you doing here?

629
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,040
I’m recording.

630
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,040
We need a few more hours.

631
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,040
Right.

632
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,680
But why in the office?

633
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,920
There are many interesting alternatives.

634
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,200
I think I’d better

635
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,120
ask the questions here.

636
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,360
OK.

637
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,560
Let’s talk on the camera.

638
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,160
Fire away.

639
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:43,920
First question,

640
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,600
was Qi Nian a member

641
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:47,920
of Qiyue Qingwu?

642
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,440
The termination is just your coverup.

643
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:57,800
The truth is

644
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,080
Qi Nian lost the authorship

645
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,280
and almost quit due to cyberbullying.

646
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,320
Were you behind it?

647
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,000
Did Qi Nian tell you so?

648
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,000
Answer my question.

649
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,680
Knowing that Qi Nian

650
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,120
is your favorite cartoonist,

651
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,520
you must be delighted.

652
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:17,960
Don’t change the subject.

653
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,120
She’s always your idol.

654
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,440
Now you like her more than ever.

655
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,560
Lu Qingwu!

656
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:25,960
What?

657
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,240
Would you believe me if I deny it?

658
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,400
You’re just like Qi Nian,

659
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,520
who has got a conviction for me.

660
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,680
Why bother questioning me?

661
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,480
Pack up your things

662
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:46,840
and get out!

663
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,480
Are you going back to Qi Nian?

664
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,000
Why do you care?

665
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,160
Sorry for meddling.

666
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,320
As a gift,

667
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,400
it was I who forced Qi Nian

668
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,080
to fire you.

669
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,800
She didn’t want to.

670
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,440
You!

671
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,720
Surprise!

672
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,640
Go to your goddess!

673
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,760
If I told you it wasn’t me,

674
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,040
would you believe it?

675
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,980
(Mother-in-law-to-be)

676
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:06,680
Hello,

677
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,760
Ms. Pei.

678
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,720
Forget the formalities.

679
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:10,840
Call me auntie.

680
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,120
How could I call you auntie?

681
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,640
You’re too young to be an aunt for me.

682
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,480
Yanxin is a lucky man.

683
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,440
Oh, he has a girlfriend

684
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,640
who is so sweet.

685
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,520
He often gives you a dig

686
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,000
when you’re with him, right?

687
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:27,640
No.

688
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,400
Prof. Ji only mocks at me

689
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,480
when he’s in a good mood.

690
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,440
It’s an honor to be mocked by him.

691
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,760
You’re modest.

692
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:36,680
Listen to me.

693
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,800
To deal with a man like him,

694
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,800
you should be meaner.

695
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,480
He’s just like his dad.

696
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,360
It’s hard for them

697
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,680
to speak out their hearts.

698
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:49,300
Hello?

699
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,600
You’re not compatible.

700
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,000
Moreover, he’s a workaholic.

701
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,720
Tell me.

702
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,480
Is it difficult

703
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,480
to be with him?

704
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,760
Don’t chat for too long. Have some rest.

705
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,720
Alright. Alright. Listen to him.

706
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,600
Bye, Ms. Pei.

707
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,080
OK, good bye.

708
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,080
My silly son finally has an improvement.

709
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,960
He’s like a monk when he starts to work.

710
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,200
Would you care for a word with me?

711
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,120
Now it’s time

712
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:57,000
for my desperate try
to seek my boyfriend’s attention.

713
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,520
First step, apple.

714
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,400
Mission failed.

715
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,080
Next is the third step,

716
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,560
the devil.

717
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,200
No one would survive it.

718
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,160
Celery.

719
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,640
Do you want my attention?
