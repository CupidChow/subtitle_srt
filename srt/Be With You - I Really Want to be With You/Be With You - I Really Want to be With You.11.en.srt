What a perfect timing.

Let’s go to see it tonight.

Anyway, we have

33

no other meeting tonight.

34
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,360
OK?

35
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,440
But I have other work to do.

36
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,170
You also cannot leave
if I haven’t finished it.

37
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,520
What’s more, I don’t like fireworks.

38
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,160
Why?

39
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,170
Because it withers so soon?

40
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,730
Because it’s unsafe.

41
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,250
This is really your style.

We can find a safe thing to do!

45
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,770
It really gives us enough respect.

46
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,480
Maybe it will shift shape to a prince

47
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,770
if you flirt with him.

48
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,410
I got signal!

49
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,090
Call a cab now!

50
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,730
Are you serious?

51
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,170
How could you get a cab here?

52
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,770

I can finally leave this terrible place.

66
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,250
You should be grateful for my good luck.

67
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,970
Is this… A taxi?

68
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,730
You called an ox cart here.

69

Are you Princess Iron Fan?

70
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,410
Shut up.

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,690
It’s good enough to have a cart.

72
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,120
Ordinary cars

73
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,960
can’t pass through this place.

74
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,440
You can only be carried

75
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,250
by cart to the road over there.

76
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,050
The car is waiting for you there.

77
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,600
If it’s still at this speed,

78
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,850
when can I go back to downtown?

79
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,130

only for this?

82
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,850
How could you peep?
None of your business.

83
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,610
I didn’t want to peep either.

84
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,130
The car broke down.

85
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,690
Send a tow truck here.

86

87
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,410
don’t make video call when I’m outside.

88
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,410
Wait.

You look like a mess.

99

You do have affairs everywhere.

100

By the way,

101
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,080
have you done with
the assistant of Baby Seven?

Well. I gotta go. Talk to you later.

105
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,920
No wonder why you invited me

106
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,170
and talked about cooperation.

107
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,410
Turns out you just wanted to
poach talents.

108
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,520
This… Is normal in the industry, OK?

109
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,850
People struggles upwards.

110
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,440
As for the remuneration,

111
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,570
Rongpin is many times better than MC.

112
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,240
In your dreams!

113
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,200
Even if you offer me tons of
silver and gold,

114
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,410
I will never go to Rongpin.

115
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,410
What if I say I want you to come

116

to finish the Thither Cloud?

117
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,890
Really?

118
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,130
Just kidding.

119
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,890
See,

120
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,290
you can be tempted.

121
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,490
I just need to give you what you want.

After this meeting,

128
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,690
will all the work for today be over?

129
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,040
Go back to the room afterwards.

130
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,240
Still many e-mails to be replied to.

131

You can reply to them on your phone.

132
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,080
I heard there are many scenic spots
in the south of the city.

133
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,400
How about we go to have a look?

134
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,840
We can collect the folk specialties.

135
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,920
Work is not like traveling.

136

Have you forgotten what we’re here for?

137
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,600
But apart from work,

138
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,490
filial piety is also important, OK?

I haven’t seen any photos

of you and Yanxin recently.

142

Grandpa is suspicious of us.

143
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,640
You know.

144
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,120
We pretend to be a couple.

145
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,280
But we never go on a date or shopping.

146
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,960
Grandpa is not that easy to be deceived.

147
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,680
We have to take some photos

148
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,680
to make him believe, right?

149
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,040
Why do you have his contact?

150
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,490
The chat record tells me

151
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,530
you just added him.

Yanxin,

156
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,360
the will of the elders still matters.

Since we are out here,

160
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,440
we can just find some landmarks

161
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,680
and take some photos.

162
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,400
Or you want me to take photos of

163

yourself in the meetings?

Sir, let’s go now.

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,560
The Princess Building

167
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,440
was built in the mid-1930s.

168
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,480
It’s said that this building

169
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,440
was a villa built by the Danish

170
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,850
consul-general for the Danish princess.

171

But the princess never came,

172
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,170
just left a legend for this building.

173
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,130
More than that,

174
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,810
this building is in Danish style,

175
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,610
but the owner is German,

176
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,730
and the designer is Ukrainian.

177
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,610
It’s masonry structure,

178
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,280
featuring with minarets

179
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,490
and irregular roofs.

180
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,010
Anyway,

181
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,560
this building retains the

182
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,010
fairytale style of Danish architecture,

183
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,240
even in Qingdao,

184
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,600
which is known as the
Museum of the World,

185
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,770
it’s still an outstanding one.

186
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,690
Why are you looking at me like this?

187
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,410
You really like architecture a lot.

188
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,730
Architecture is the art which
condenses time.

189
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,040
Think about it.

190
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,680
We’re talking to

191
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,400
the artists from 1940.

192
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,570
Isn’t it amazing?

193
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,520
Mr. Ji, look over here.

♪Can’t stop giggling when missing you♪

196
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,480
I took a photo of the beautiful

197
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,040
glance back of you.

198
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,330
I didn’t expect you and the
Princess Building look well together.

199
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,800
Mr. Ji! Don’t go!

200
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,610
Let’s change some other styles!

201

♪Joys and sorrows of life

204

205
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,270
♪Sometimes lose my temper with you♪

Mr. Ji! Wait for me!

209
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:14,020
♪You win this game again♪

00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,720
Don’t come over.

213
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,280
You look perfect standing there.

214
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,370
Enough.

215
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,560
But every photo is great.

216
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,840
Since it’s for Grandpa,

217
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,370
only me in the frame is not qualified.

218
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,520
Don’t forget your identity
to my grandpa,

219
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,330
my girlfriend.

220
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,480
That’s right.

221
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,210
Then please take some photos of me.

222
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:44,330
♪I love no one else but you♪

223
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,290
Alright. I will send them to you.

224
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,400
Looking forward to it.

225
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,650
The photos you took must be… Great.

226
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,660
I don’t know what style you like.

227
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,590
So I added some filters.

228
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,910
Is this a problem with filters?

229
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,350
Then maybe the problem of you.

230
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,790
This is how I look like in your eyes?

231
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,020
Good enough.

232
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,070
How pretty do you want?

233
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,430
Tired?

234
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,750
No.

235
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,580
Just a piece of cake.

236
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,550
It’s much easier than I always walk.

237
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,980
But, Mr. Ji,

238
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,500
we went to these places today.

239
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,710
Do you think it’s worth it?

240
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,190
Even if just a little.

241
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,340
Does it matter?

242
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,020
Of course.

243
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,390
Or why should I make so many efforts…

244
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,950
I just want you to be happy.

245
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,390
Come on. To the next stop.

246
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,630
(Summer Firework Display)
Isn’t this the Summer Firework Display?

247
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:25,910
Yes.

248
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,270
Didn’t you say it’s unsafe?

249
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,870
We can just watch it from a distance.

250
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,470
I will go buy the tickets.

251
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:45,820

254
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,420

The tickets today are sold out?

255
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,350
Yes.

256
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,350
Mr. Ji, it’s sold out.

257
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,110
Two reserved tickets.

258
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,750
Where do you get the tickets?

259
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,500
On the road. Lucky draw.

260
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,470
Does that matter?

261
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:07,790
Hurry up.

262
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,740
(Qi Nian: I really want to go to
the Summer Firework Display.)

263
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,510
I think she will be here.

264
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,670
Or did I guess it wrong?

265
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:35,830
Help me to take photos.

266
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,070
Hurry up.

267
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,430
I… Why?

268
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,230
Anyway, I can do it myself.

269
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,700
What are you doing?

270
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,590
Shut up.

271
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,590
Just be the phone holder.

272
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,660
What’s wrong with you?

273
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,550
Why should I be your phone holder?

274
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,340
And, you’re out of my way.

275
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,270
Why do you follow me?

276
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,900
Who follows you?

277
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,420
I’m out of photos for Weibo.

278
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,620
So I just want to

279
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,830
take more photos here.

280
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:13,390
Qi Nian? Seriously?

281
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,820
You came such a long way here

282
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,230
just to see her?

283
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,790
Do you… Like her?

284
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,950
I don’t!

285
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,830
It’s… It’s not like that.

286
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,030
Well, I like her.

287
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,140
And let me make it clear to you.

288
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,100
Don’t try to poach talents from her.

289
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,190
It’s impossible for you to succeed.

290
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,580
She must come here with

291
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,510
her handsome boss.

292
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,300
Maybe the two of them are walking

293
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,830
hand in hand to watch the sunset.

294
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,980
What’s the meaning for you

295
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:44,830
to look for her?

296
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,450
Anyway, it’s more interesting than
being with you.

297
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:47,950
You…!

298
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,110
OK.

299
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,940
Then let’s…

300
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,100
Let’s just part here.

301
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,140
Go and mind your own business.

302
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,150
That’s what I want!

303
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,750
Brat. Who do you think you are?

304
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,020
If I know the way back,

305
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,110
why should I follow you?

306
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,460
Please have a look at our activities.

307
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,430
No, thanks.

308
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:12,980
Look! Look!

309
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,340
Mr. Ji! Mr. Ji!

310
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,750
Let’s play this Great Windmill!

311
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,790
Bad for the neck. Pass.

312
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,510
Then, the Big Pendulum?

313
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,310
Or how about the Haunted House?

314
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,380
Are you a girl?

315
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,270
Why can’t you choose something mild?

316
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,750
Then only the merry-go-round.

317

(Fantawild)

318
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:52,820
Mr. Ji.

319
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,070
The entrance is here.

320
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,190
Hurry up.

321
00:16:55,220 --> 00:17:00,100
(Fantawild)

322
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:17,300
(Dream Theater)

323
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,070
What’s wrong with this place?

324
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,030
The road signs are in a mess.

325
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,310
Where is the exit?

326
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,340
What are you doing?

327
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,740
Aren’t you always so arrogant?

328
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,030
Why did you get lost like this?

329
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,380
Didn’t you just leave?

330
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,110
I want to follow you to mock you.

331
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,140
But you just went further and further.

332
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,380
I couldn’t even stop you.

333
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,750
You’re really a typical direction blind.

334
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,220
It’s none of your business.

335
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,180
Alright. You can keep pretending.

336
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,510
See if you can get out by yourself.

337
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,270
Can’t you just be honest
about needing help?

338
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,630
Your feet are aching, right?

339
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,670
My feet hurt. Help me get there.

340
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,310
Look, I’m bleeding.

341
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,630
Do you have a Band-Aid?

342
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,140
I didn’t know I would

343
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,060
walk this long before leaving home.

344
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:29,830
I don’t have any.

345
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:31,990
I’ll go buy you some.

346
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,710
Almost there.

347
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,700
Give it up if you can’t.

348
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,180
I can just buy you one.

349
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,700
But I just want to get this pig

350
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,150
from this machine.

351
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,750
I failed again.

352
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,100
No way to get you.

353
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,070
Let me do this. Just watch.

354
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,590
Here you are.

355
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,390
Let’s go.

356
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,510
Don’t even try.

357
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,380
Just help me for once.

358
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,910
I’m going broken.

359
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,820
You can buy this kind of dolls as many

360
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,860
as you want in Yiwu.

361
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,060
Time is priceless.

362
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:30,790
Let’s go.

363
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,300
Mr. Ji! Prof. Ji!

364
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,870
Just help me for once, OK? Ji Yanxin.

365
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,500
It’s close!

366
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,780
Let’s try again.

367
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,950
You’re not a kid.

368
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,030
What’s the meaning of playing the
claw machine well?

369
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,630
Let’s go.

370
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,870
Why do you wear high heels to go out?

371
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,540
You’re lucky this time

372
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,700
to get the thing you want.

373
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,350
Let me get you a pair of slippers.

374
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,300
I don’t want it!

375
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,510
So ugly!

376
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,580
I do this for you in person.

377
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,740
You’re not grateful

378
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,070
and think it’s ugly?

379
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,270
Can you?

380
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,750
Of course I can. Just wait and see.

381
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,230
You really made it!

382
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,430
Cut the crap. Put them on.

383
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,180
I have conquered

384
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,700
all kinds of claw machines.

385
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,990
This one is a piece of cake.

386
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,150
Don’t even try. Do it yourself.

387
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,350
Then forget it. They are ugly.

388
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,830
Then just let them disgust you.

389
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,910
Look how ugly you are!

390
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,380
What?

391
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,860
You’re happy when I’m not happy?

392
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,820
Am I your enemy?

393
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,630
Yes! A great enemy!

394
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:54,950
Mr. Ji.

395
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,490
(Claw Machine Crab Battle)
Here, the meaning of claw machines.

396
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:58,420
(Get the doll for crabs 30 yuan/ time
Eat as much as you get)

397
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,900
Let’s try something else.

398
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,670
Or we won’t have nothing to eat
even if we lose our shirts.

399
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:09,420
(World Heroes)

400
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,020
Excuse me! Ten coins, please.

401
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:18,790
OK.

402
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,300
Here you are.

403
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,030
OK. Thanks.

404
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,500
(Get the doll for crabs)

405
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,870
(30 yuan/ time Eat as much as you get)
Claw Machine Crab Battle?

406
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,990
It’s totally your game.

407
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,540
Mr. Ji, it’s fine if you can’t make it.

408
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,820
There is a saying,

409
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,350
“Claw Machine is just a
public piggy bank”.

410
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:07,380
(2 coins/time)

411
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,710
You’re so weak.

412
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,020
No… Wait.

413
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,790
It’s different from

414
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,430
that machine.

415
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:23,990
Shut up.

416
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:32,890
Oh, my god.

417
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:34,190
Penta kill.

418
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:36,990
Normal.

419
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,310
Grandpa, this photo is great.

420
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,580
But it doesn’t look like Ji’s style.

421
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,710
Of course it’s not.

422
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,430
It’s taken by Qi Nian.

423
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,470
I forced him to upload these.

424
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,510
He won’t

425
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,140
show up in His Moments

426
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,590
even when I die.

427
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,990
Why is the background changed?

428
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,790
What’s the difference?

429
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,900
Still the architecture.

430
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,310
It’s the same.

431
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,910
You know how pretty Qi Nian is.

432
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,590
Why can’t he add some pictures
of her?

433
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,230
He really makes me mad.

434
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,410
Wait.

435
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,110
Here she is, Grandpa.

436
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,750
You want some marshmallow?

437
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,510
I can buy it for you.

438
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,260
What’s that attitude?

439
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,430
I’m not a kid.

440
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,020
Aren’t you being upset because

441
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,510
you failed just then, right?

442
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,660
Let’s forget about the claw machine

443
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,950
and have another challenge.

444
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,070
What challenge?

445
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,820
I have had a question
since I was a child.

446
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,670
How big can the biggest marshmallow be?

447
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,150
Who knows? I never tried.

448
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,430
Wait a moment.

449
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,230
Now this machine is yours.

450
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,260
Use anything you want

451
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,430
and make me a biggest marshmallow.

452
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,710
Are you serious?

453
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,230
You’re going to… Bite it directly?

454
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,710
I don’t know how to eat this.

455
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,230
You don’t want to have some?

456
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,870
I’m not a crab person.

457
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:33,670
It’s delicious!

458
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,900
But you can’t eat too much.

459
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,710
Crabs are cold. Too much of them will
hurt your stomach.

460
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,830
So, five crabs at most.

461
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,260
This is…?

462
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:44,990
Ginger tea.

463
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,950
It can dispel the coldness of crabs.

464
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,310
But in theory, it’s better with alcohol.

465
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,420
Then, I can drink it.

466
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,070
I’m happy today anyway.

467
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:55,780
You’re a girl.

468
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,270
What if you get drunk?

469
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,340
It’s OK. I can drink.

470
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,070
Also, I have you here.

471
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,310
It’s OK with you, not me.

472
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:11,350
This wine tastes good! Like juice.

473
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,380
It’s homemade plum wine.

474
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,430
It’s strong. Don’t drink too much.

475
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,900
I didn’t expect that

476
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,550
you would care about others.

477
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,100
I always thought that you

478
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,510
are cold-blooded and careless.

479
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,820
I didn’t expect

480
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,110
you to be so considerate.

481
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,380
I really envy

482
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,870
those who were by your side.

483
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,430
Envy them?

484
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,140
Being treated by you like this today,

485
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,550
I feel like being the luckiest person
in the world

486
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,020
If I can be treated

487
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,710
so carefully by you every day,

488
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,070
that would be so wonderful.

489
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,230
Qi Nian,

490
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,790
just come to the point..

491
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,310
You still caught me.

492
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,260
You’ve been trying to please me

493
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,830
from morning till night.

494
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,270
What do you want from me?

495
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,740
In fact, I just saw some
architectural photos

496
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:19,820
in the city and thought about

497
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,850
taking you out for a rest,

498
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:23,030
then it may relieve your pressure.

499
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,660
Then, the mission from Grandpa…

500
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,990
I made it up myself.

501
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,220
But,

502
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,140
your grandpa really wants to
see your photos.

503
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,270
But the chat history is fake.

504
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,230
You’re pretty handy.

505
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:37,950
In addition to this,

506
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:38,980
is there anything else

507
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,310
you’d like to ask me?

508
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:48,830
Go ahead.

509
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:53,190
I always want to ask you a question.

510
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:58,340
Mr. Ji, in your mind,

511
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,870
who is the one you can’t let go?

512
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,750
It’s time to go.

513
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:26,950
Shall we?

514
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,710
To where?

515
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,070
Of course, the fireworks.

516
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,390
Mine is bigger.

517
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,580
Yours is just wider.

518
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,420
As for the volume,

519
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,500
your marshmallow

520
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,150
should call mine father.

521
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,820
Are you thirsty?

522
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,900
Your daddy can buy you some oranges.

523
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,510
Yes! Where are the oranges?

524
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,380
Are you take advantage of me?

525
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,780
Is it?

526
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,540
You have never seen

527
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,270
how I really take advantage of people.

528
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,580
You… How dare you!

529
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,350
I dare. You deserve this.

530
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,830
Now you know me.

531
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,180
Give it back to me!

532
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,390
Now you know me.

533
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,270
Look, this is what you get for it.

534
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,460
The Firework Display is beginning.

535
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,740
Do you want to watch it?

536
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,100
Of course.

537
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,550
I failed to poach the talent.

538
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,470
At least I have to watch the fireworks.

539
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,420
You… What are you doing?

540
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,420
Cut the crap.

541
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,660
Hurry up if you want to watch it.

542
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,150
I’m not always so kind.

543
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,020
Let me warn you.

544
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,140
Get me down when we arrive.

545
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,060
Don’t take advantage of me.

546
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,590
I know. I don’t want this, either.

547
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,020
Let’s head to the Sky Wheel.

548
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,190
There is an observation deck.

549
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,830
Is this the Sky Wheel on the poster?

550
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,630
So beautiful.

551
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:08,060
Are we going to watch the fireworks
up there later?

552
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:08,830
Yeah.

553
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,510
We can wait for the next round.

554
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,390
Let’s go have a seat first.

555
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,430
Can I buy an ice-cream?

556
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,430
No.

557
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,070
Why?

558
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,970
You just had crabs.

559
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:23,060
You will get diarrhea if you eat
something cold again.

560
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:23,950
But...

561
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,910
No but. Let’s go.

562
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:39,870
Enough.

563
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:56,820
Mr. Ji.

564
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,950
How did you find such a good spot?

565
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,830
Can you remember it if I tell you now?

566
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,630
I just hope you won’t…

567
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,550
Pretend to go wild.

568
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,390
It’s too late.

569
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,830
Mr. Ji,

570
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,910
why do I feel so dizzy now?

571
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,950
Will juice make people dizzy?

572
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,150
I told you it was wine.

573
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,500
But you didn’t tell me beforehand.

574
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,740
If I didn’t drink wine,

575
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,430
how could I be brave?

576
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:37,790
So,

577
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,510
who is the one in your heart?

578
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,070
Ex-girlfriend?

579
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,300
Do you like her?

580
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,470
Does she look pretty?

581
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:49,750
Yes.

582
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,270
Then, do you miss her?

583
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,830
She is by my side.

584
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,230
Why should I miss her?

585
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,510
By your side?

586
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,590
You are still keeping in touch?

587
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:02,900
Mr. Ji,

588
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,830
can you not be so frank?

589
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,150
Why do you ask me this?

590
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:11,150
Shao Zui said you
if had someone in heart,

591
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,910
when you think about her

592
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,100
you will get

593
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,590
really heavy pressure.

594
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,790
Yes. Full of pressure.

595
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,070
Also a problem.

596
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,590
Who told you it’s a woman?

597
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,070
A man?

598
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,590
That’s scarier.

599
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,310
But, you two men…

600
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,510
What did you do behind me?

601
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,870
What are you thinking about?

602
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,350
It’s my younger brother.

603
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,270
Brother?

604
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,710
He left without saying goodbye years ago

605
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,230
and showed up recently.

606
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,860
So I want to take this opportunity

607
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,550
to fix our relationship.

608
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,590
But I didn’t realize that

609
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,590
his hostility towards me even increased.

610
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,190
So every time I saw him,

611
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,390
I would think of my past.

612
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,030
Then, what’s your past?

613
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,270
Nothing special.

614
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:09,070
Just a painful memory of home education.

615
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:10,670
It’s boring.

616
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:11,500
You won’t want to hear.

617
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,350
I do.

618
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,950
It will be a wet blanket.

619
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,190
I’ll tell you later.

620
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:19,790
Alright.

621
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,500
We’re here. Get down now.

622
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,230
No.

623
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,990
It’s a good view here
to see the fireworks.

624
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,030
Let’s go.

625
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,990
The fireworks look so beautiful.

626
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,470
Just flame reaction.

627
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,740
What reaction?

628
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,820
For example, when objects are burning,

629
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:49,780
molecules and atoms

630
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,220
exhibit bands, or lines,

631
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,740
of certain wavelengths

632
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:53,750
in the visible spectrum,

633
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,580
coloring the flame.

634
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,030
This is called a flame reaction.

635
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,580
I don’t want to hear it.

636
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,380
Just stop the chemistry class.

637
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:02,540
I don’t want it. I don’t want it.

638
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,220
Don’t want to hear it.

639
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,270
No. No. No.

640
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,070
Then, what do you want to hear?

641
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:12,940
Forget about it.

642
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,620
You won’t say what I want to hear

643
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:15,030
now.

644
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,350
I like you.

645
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:23,030
What? Just now,

646
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,230
it was…

647
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,370

Why am I here?

659
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,630
So, what happened next?

660
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,030
Mr. Ji?

661
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,590
Mr. Ji…

would you ask why?

00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,950
How ungrateful you are!

666
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:46,300
I shouldn’t have promised the two
brothers

667

Ji Yanxin and Pei Siqi.

671
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,220
He didn’t even change his name.

672
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,390
So, his name should be Ji Siqi.

673
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,070
No way.

674
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,350
You have got tangled up with them.

675
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,030
