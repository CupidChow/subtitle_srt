00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:28,450
Hello?

22
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,120
Hello?

23
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,630
May I speak to Qi Nian?

24
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:36,990
She?

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,880
She’s on the floor and can’t get up.

26
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,550
What?

27
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,720
She suffered a dislocation yesterday.

28
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,960
Possibly because
she had a sprain in her waist

29
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,590
because of big move.

30
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,430
Move?

31
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,360
What move?

32
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,230
I’ll put her on the phone.

33
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,260
Hello?

34
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:52,910
Hello? Hello?

35
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:53,390
Qi Nian.

36
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,950
Was that Ji Yanxin?

37
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,670
Did you make up with him?

38
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,320
He’s with you so early.

39
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,800
Did you sleep with him?

40
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,670
That’s awesome, girl!

41
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,880
But what did you do?

42
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,200
Dislocation and sprain?

43
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:05,990
So violent?

44
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,390
Couldn’t you restrain yourselves?

45
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,360
Don’t have such complicated thoughts.

46
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,630
We’re pure, all right?

47
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,150
I had a dislocation

48
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,470
because Ji Yanxin...

49
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,480
Well, forget it.

50
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,640
Let’s get to the point.

51
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,710
Fine. I’ll get to the point, then.

52
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,760
On the momentum

53
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,440
of Dress for the Beauty,

54
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,070
our company will hold
an Autograph Session for you.

55
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,680
The promotion theme

56
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,840
will be love across three-D.

57
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,830
Next week.

58
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:32,910
Autograph Session?

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,560
But Mr. Ji...

60
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,750
He’s the prototype...

61
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,600
That’s just the package.

62
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,910
Who will try to figure it out?

63
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,030
What should I prepare for that?

64
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,310
Get yourself prepared.

65
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,320
Tell Ji Yanxin

66
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,030
I need an energetic you.

67
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,840
If he dares to make you like this again,

68
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,990
I’ll go and tear down his office.

69
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,800
I see.

70
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,270
I’ll take good care of her for you.

71
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,990
Let me have a look.

72
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,720
It hurts!

73
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,680
It hurts! It hurts!

74
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,790
It hurts! It hurts!

75
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,000
Seems like you can’t walk now.

76
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,190
Why don’t you stay in bed today?

77
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,810
I’ll take good care of you.

78
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,920
But... But I need to paint.

79
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,070
You can do it here.

80
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,360
Isn’t it a hotel room?

81
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,120
We need to extend our stay.

82
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,950
It bothers.

83
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,430
Who told you it was a hotel room?

84
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,990
From now on,

85
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,830
it is your exclusive room.

86
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:32,870
Mine?

87
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,310
There are more rooms.

88
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,710
Would you like to have a look?

89
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,680
This is…

90
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,680
Your studio.

91
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,990
You can paint here,

92
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,230
instead of working in the company
just for AC.

93
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,200
When you have an assistant,

94
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,310
ask her to work here.

95
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,200
Here are prepared tools.

96
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,110
It’s better than sharing
the small apartment with Siqi.

97
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,830
You feel too painful to stand?

98
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,680
Thank you

99
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,950
for considering so much for me.

100
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,550
You’re welcome.

101
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,240
I think I’m an idiot.

102
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,360
I shouldn’t have suspected you.

103
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,480
I should have a time travel

104
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,590
and slap myself.

105
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,070
That’s not necessary.

106
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,840
But I should really deal with

107
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,070
your messy imaginations.

108
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,390
Deal with?

109
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,580
How?

110
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,180
(Jin Xianyu)

111
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,860
(Follow)

112
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,900
(Unfollow)

113
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,020
(Confirm to unfollow? Confirm)

114
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,470
Fine.

115
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,590
He has nothing to do with me now.

116
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,390
Let me post a toast online.

117
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,040
I have just closed a big fan club

118
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,710
of hundreds of thousands of fans
for my previous idol.

119
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,360
I’m feeling blue.

120
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,230
Please comfort me.

121
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,390
My boyfriend said he would deal with me

122
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,030
and I’m not allowed to get off bed.

123
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,480
What should I do?

124
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,670
Anxious for the answer.

125
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,390
Wow, sounds exciting.

126
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,550
Let me care for the poster first.

127
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,550
Are you alright?

128
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,800
Is your boyfriend a snake?

129
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,590
He’s pestering.

130
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,190
It’s a long story.

131
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,320
Over the morning,

132
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,720
I’m forced to remain useless.

133
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,750
I believe

134
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,350
this is what he wants.

135
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,590
Morning.

136
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,630
Morning.

137
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,030
Well,

138
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,110
this is my self-criticism.

139
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,070
(Prof. Ji, my love.)

140
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,660
(This is my ever first self-criticism.)

141
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,910
May I go have breakfast now?

142
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,630
Stop.

143
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,150
I can’t go?

144
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,070
I warned you

145
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,790
that I would control
the rest of your life.

146
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,390
This is your own choice.

147
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,670
But I have work to do.

148
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,710
My informer told me

149
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,480
you fulfilled your last two weeks

150
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,510
with work.

151
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,710
You have days off from today on.

152
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,400
You wasted time imagining things.

153
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,550
Now, you’ll make up for that.

154
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,270
I told you

155
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,390
I wouldn’t let you go.

156
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:46,990
Be prepared, then.

157
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,190
Let’s go have breakfast.

158
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,500
(MC)

159
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,070
Negotiation failed.

160
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,640
I feel I’ll be totally controlled
in the next three days

161
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,110
and I’ve given up.

162
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,200
Don’t give up, girl.

163
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,600
If you do,

164
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,510
you’ll always be controlled.

165
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,350
Fine, then.

166
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,720
This is romance, understand?

167
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,800
You must be a young girl.

168
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,200
If I can have such romance,

169
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,750
I’ll even wake up laughing.

170
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,480
Who is she?

171
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,670
Why is she talking like an adult?

172
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,230
Help!

173
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,960
My young boyfriend

174
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,480
is more conservative than me.

175
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,680
How can I

176
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,670
finally get him?

177
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,750
Looks really like an adult thing.

178
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,400
How conservative?

179
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,350
Be specific.

180
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,000
A day with him

181
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,350
starts like this.

182
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:26,970
Hello?

183
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,030
Why are you calling so early?

184
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,670
Miss me?

185
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:31,990
Early?

186
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,120
Employees usually arrive at company
at this time,

187
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,750
all right?

188
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,750
You have half an hour.

189
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:37,840
I’m waiting for you downstairs.

190
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,510
Hurry up.

191
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,260
Hello?

192
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,760
You’re so slow.

193
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,600
Bad boy.

194
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,640
Do you know how much time a girl needs

195
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,910
before she leaves home?

196
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,470
Half an hour is only enough
for my foundation make-up.

197
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,510
Look.

198
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,800
I haven’t combed my hair.

199
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,070
I’m too ugly to go out.

200
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,190
No.

201
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,790
You look good to me.

202
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:15,870
Really?

203
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,750
You look simpler.

204
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,000
Why are you wearing so little?

205
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,790
Don’t you have a common sense?

206
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,590
It’s for me?

207
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,400
The diurnal temperature is huge lately.

208
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,070
Don’t you know?

209
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,670
I guess you only wear beautiful dresses.

210
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,920
Take the shawl to work,

211
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,550
just in case.

212
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,750
Why are you staring at me?

213
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,870
You waited for me in the early morning,

214
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,990
just to give me this?

215
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,190
What?

216
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,640
You don’t like that?

217
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,310
Not really.

218
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,360
But you look like

219
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,320
you would take out a thermos cup

220
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,870
from your bag.

221
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,110
Fine, forget the thermos cup.

222
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:11,950
I have them.

223
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,430
What are they?

224
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,910
Kneepads. They’re for you.

225
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,390
What do I need such ugly things for?

226
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,920
To protect your knees.

227
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,960
You’re no longer young, anyway.

228
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,790
What, bad boy?

229
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:22,910
Say it again!

230
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,800
You don’t like them?

231
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,120
I have the thermal underwear.

232
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:26,640
Would you like it?

233
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,270
Get away.

234
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,640
Would you like cotton-padded trousers?

235
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,270
Get away.

236
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,440
Am I really in a relationship

237
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,710
with a young boyfriend?

238
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,790
Anyway,

239
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,270
he’s a vulgarian.

240
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,110
But I just want him to stay around.

241
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,470
Unfortunately,

242
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,240
he doesn’t accept that

243
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,710
at all.

244
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,390
Live in your home?

245
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,710
No.

246
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,550
Why?

247
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,080
You don’t need to wait for me, then.

248
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,600
We can also go to work
and come back together.

249
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,270
Isn’t it great?

250
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,680
No.

251
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,560
We have family rules.

252
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,600
We can’t live together
before getting married.

253
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,590
But we have...

254
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,870
Shut up.

255
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,110
Didn’t we agree
to follow the prescribed rule?

256
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,190
What about agreed happy life?

257
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,990
When can we have it next time?

258
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,390
Seriously?

259
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,990
Must we wait until we get married?

260
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,750
What’s the family rule?

261
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,710
Why do you consider so much?

262
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,710

I’m not that unrestrained.

By the way,

281
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,920
where did you go
after the welcome meeting?

282
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,110
I called you, but you didn’t answer.

283
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,270
What happened?

284
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,360
The new cartoonist you recruited...

285
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,470
He’s Ji Siqi, right?

286
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,390
He’s arrogant.

287
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,280
When he first came,

288
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,510
he beat a colleague.

289
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,670
He did?

290
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,590
Several group leaders
complained about him.

291
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,550
Do you want more enemies in the company?

292
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,110
Enemies?

293
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,550
They can do nothing,

294
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,150
but sing dis rap in the distance.

295
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,000
See if they dare to complain

296
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,990
in front of me?

297
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,880
Why didn’t they ask

298
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,230
the reason that Ji Siqi beat them?

299
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,030
Before interfering with someone else,

300
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,200
they should ask their subordinates

301
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,630
to behave themselves.

302
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,350
Well,

303
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,190
sounds like you think highly of Ji Siqi.

304
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,270
I think highly of my respect.

305
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,110
I’m his boss, anyway.

Can she finish it alone?

312
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,640
Miss Lu never does such rough work,

313
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,430
as painting.

314
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:26,960
What do you mean?

This is Lu Qingwu’s Studio.

316

All comic books

317
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,680
are her works,

318
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,030
no matter if she draws any.

319
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,110
We just

320
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,910
work for her.

321

We can be replaced at any time.

322
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,710
Unlike you who can represent her.

323
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,920
I’m also a cartoonist,

324
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,640
like you.

325
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,310
What?

326
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,830

00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,830
They enjoy suppressing cartoonists.

330
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,110
Jia?

338
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,280
as an explanation for others.

When they’re no longer angry,

340
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,360
I’ll get him back.

341
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,430
Are you kidding?

342
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,550
I hired Ji Siqi!

343
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,120
I promised to offer him
the best working condition.

344
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,680
But you want to get him to logistics?

345
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,750
Aren’t you embarrassing me?

346
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,750
Why are you so angry?

347
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,190
He’s just an assistant of Baby Seven.

draw better than him.

349
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:50,950
He’s different.

350
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,150
I owe him a future.

351
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,190
And I owe someone else a promise.

352
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,430
Don’t bother about Ji Siqi.

353
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,470
Fine.

354
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,760
I’ll see

355
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,640
how much he can do

356
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,670
under your leadership.

357
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,350
Did I see you somewhere before?

358
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,520
Mr. Xiao.

359
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,470
He’s Ji Siqi.

360
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,270
Oh, I see.

361
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,430
That explains.

362
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,310
You have a loose tongue. Huh?

363
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,440
Come on and have a word with me.

364
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:43,980
Come on.

365
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:44,450
You...

366
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,870
Where are you taking me?

367
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,630
I didn’t mean that.

368
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,160
Without consideration,

369
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,600
it just slipped it out.

370
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,640
I didn’t mean to hurt you.

371
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,510
What are you nervous for?

372
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,270
I didn’t say I would beat you.

373
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,950
You deserve that, though.

374
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,670
What do you want, then?

375
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,400
Whatever,

376
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,030
I’m the chief assistant of Miss Lu.

377
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,800
If you beat me,

378
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,360
you’ll be...

379
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,230
Disrespecting her, right?

380
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,680
I know.

381
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,160
You’re one of Lu Qingwu’s assistants,

382
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,830
aren’t you?

383
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,320
You should be aware

384
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,320
of her things.

385
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,030
Sure.

386
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,480
I know everything

387
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,510
about Miss Lu.

388
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,550
Does she have substitutes?

389
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,880
Others even draw storyboards

390
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,280
for her.

391
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,400
In the name of chief painter,

392
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,350
what did she draw?

393
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,710
She drew something.

394
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,280
Something like covers, color pages

395
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,150
and frontispieces.

396
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,550
But the content...

397
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,710
Then she has substitutes!

398
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,590
She’s awesome!

399
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,590
What’s the problem with that?

400
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,510
It’s weird

401
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,960
if a famous cartoonist like her
draws personally.

402
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,270
But she’s a cartoonist.

403
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,390
You just watch when she sinks?

404
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,670
You sound too serious.

405
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,440
Miss Lu can draw.

406
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,670
She just likes to delay.

407
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:00,790
Delay?

408
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,510
You don’t know?

409
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,600
Whoever experienced that

410
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,430
got crazy or exhausted.

411
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,310
That’s why Mr. Xiao uses substitutes.

412
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,190
If you don’t want her to sink,

413
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,910
ask her to submit her works in time.

414
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,310
This is the color page and frontispiece
for next volume.

415
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,070
Get these from her first.

416
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,160
Are you flooding this pot of flowers?

417
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,920
You keep watering them at the same spot.

418
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,790
What brings you here?

419
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,430
To urge you to paint.

420
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,630
Urge me?

421
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,320
You’re a cartoonist,

422
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,430
not an editor.

423
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,710
Listen.

424
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,280
You’re an ordinary cartoonist now.

425
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,720
But I’ll apply
for your independent creation

426
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,840
as early as possible.

427
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,510
Don’t bother.

428
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,150
I’m not experienced enough.

429
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,310
I’ll first learn from you.

430
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,630
Me?

431
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,920
You don’t like the way I draw
and my stories,

432
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,710
do you?

433
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,910
Do you know

434
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,950
people always change?

435
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,630
I began to love your comics.

436
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,190
Accurately speaking,

437
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,990
I’m now a fan of yours.

438
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,670
I’m crazy about your comics now

439
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,560
and I want to observe
your painting skills

440
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,030
at close quarters.

441
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,470
Close?

442
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,750
How close do you want?

443
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,470
It depends on you.

444
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,480
I’ll follow your work for this week.

445
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,800
I’ll stay

446
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,550
wherever you paint.

447
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,670
Really?

448
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,150
Well,

449
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,920
what about my home?

450
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,990
No problem,
as long as you finish the work in time.

451
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,280
I will, I will.

452
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,400
I will do that.

453
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,840
Why don’t we do it now?

454
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,990
Move to my home today.

455
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:58,910
Fine.

456
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,110
Enjoy them.

457
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,600
You’ve ordered all the cakes,

458
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,830
haven’t you?

459
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,950
You want the sense of ceremony, huh?

460
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,470
Getting full

461
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,950
can be better than getting bald.

462
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,790
Who’s bald?

463
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,470
Fine, then.

464
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,750
You’ll pay the bill, anyway.

465
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,240
It’s considerate of you.

466
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,710
You still remember my favorite.

467
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,100
(Maths final of Grade 3)

468
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,380
(Class 3, Grade 3, Ji Qiu, Mark, 30)

469
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,120
Stop crying.

470
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,920
You just failed a math exam.

471
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,830
What do you know?

472
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,270
My parents should sign it.

473
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,190
My cousin will scold me to death.

474
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,310
Sign?

475
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,470
Easy job.

476
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:57,710
Let me help you.

477
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,510
Who are you?

478
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,470
You’re only a friend of my cousin’s.

479
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,390
Why do you want to sign for me?

480
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,550
Because I don’t have parents?

481
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,310
I’m your follower.

482
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,230
I should certainly share your burden.

483
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,950
Whatever you want,

484
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,390
come to me as you wish.

485
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,640
As long as you want something,

486
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,950
I’ll make it for you.

487
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,190
But why?

488
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,390
There’s no reason.

489
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,750
This is my duty as your follower.

490
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,310
You don’t believe that?

491
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,360
My boss Ji Qiu.

492
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,680
I’m Shao Zui,

493
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,480
and I’ll always be here

494
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,390
to help you.

495
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,550
Now you believe me?

496
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,710
Weirdo.

497
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,230
Boss.

498
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:01,950
Your mouth.

499
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,110
Come on.

500
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,430
We’re not making a sesame paste ad.

501
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,190
Disgusting.

502
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,750
Well,

503
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,670
leave such a small thing to me.

504
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,870
Just stay and sit.

505
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,310
Before I realize it,

506
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,670
I’ve known him for nearly ten years.

507
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,870
Look at you.

508
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,040
You’re no longer young.

509
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,350
But you still get something
around your mouth.

510
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:09,830
Ji Qiu?

511
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,240
You don’t have a fever.

512
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,080
What’s wrong?

513
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,160
Why are you so obedient today?

514
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,950
Do I have something on you?

515
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,310
I just don’t bother to argue with you.

516
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,240
That’s fine.

517
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,390
As long as

518
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,310
my boss can be happy.

519
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,830
You finally remember I’m your boss?

520
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,670
You respected me in the first few years.

521
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,030
Lately,

522
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,710
you’ve become more arrogant.

523
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,720
Because you’ve also grown up.

524
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,190
I can’t always treat you

525
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,630
like a little girl.

526
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,310
You no longer treat me
like a little girl?

527
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,510
You’re turning 20 in a few days.

528
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:53,880
You’re an adult

529
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,670
who can take responsibilities alone.

530
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,200
Sure.

531
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,630
From today on,

532
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,910
I’ll focus on my career.

533
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,870
Idol is fake.

534
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,750
So is love.

535
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,960
You finally begin to understand,

536
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,910
after all the time.

537
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,920
Here is a chance for you to work hard.

538
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,550
Would you like a try?

539
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,070
What is it?

540
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,960
Dress for the Beauty
will be made into a TV series.

541
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,270
Do you want to be a part?

542
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,550
Really?

543
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,150
Dress for the Beauty
will be made into a TV series?

544
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,830
Are you sure?

545
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,160
It’s only under a small discussion

546
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,430
on the forum.

547
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,360
According to inside information of MC,

548
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,350
it’s very likely to be true.

549
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,390
Mr. Xiao.

550
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,590
It hits our film plan, doesn’t it?

551
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,750
Flower & Romance has just...

552
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,430
Lately,

553
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,030
MC has been the limelight.

554
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,510
Yes.

555
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:52,720
Next week,

556
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,950
Baby Seven will have
an Autograph Session.

557
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,640
An unknown cartoonist

558
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,040
got famous for a comic book,

559
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,430
after working ineffectively
for three to five years.

560
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,670
What good luck she has!

561
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:01,990
Baby Seven?

562
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,990
She’s really

563
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,870
a stubborn girl.

564
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,950
Mr. Xiao, you know her?

565
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,630
Kind of.

566
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,390
She’s someone I should let go of.

567
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,350
It’s not too late

568
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,590
to do it now.

569
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,630
Go prepare a press release
about Baby Seven.

570
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,440
You know

571
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,430
what I mean.

572
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,430
Don’t worry, Mr. Xiao.

573
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,310
Wait.

574
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,480
Where’s Miss Lu?

575
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,350
Why didn’t I see her today?

576
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,310
She said she would paint at home
in the next three days.

577
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:38,750
She...

578
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:40,750
Paint?

579
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,240
Is this how a boyfriend should behave?

580
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,280
I’m sorry,

581
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,400
but your boyfriend Ji Siqi

582
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,920
has been locked in the cupboard.

583
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,920
Today, I’m your editor and assistant,

584
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,760
Key.

585
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,510
Let’s work hard for the day.

586
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,350
Key, huh?

587
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:05,830
Where’s your luggage?

588
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,350
Are you sure you come empty-handed?

589
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,200
I believe you will complete today’s work

590
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,920
before dawn,

591
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,000
for the sake of your efficiency.

592
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,110
So, I’m not going to stay for tonight.

593
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,990
Do you still remember this place?

594
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,630
Would you like to do it one more time?

595
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:33,710
Fine.

596
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,360
But not before you complete

597
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,350
the frontispiece and color pages
for next week.

598
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,350
Seriously?

599
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,240
And twenty pages of rough sketch.

600
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,630
All of them.

601
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,480
Twenty pages?

602
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,800
Are you kidding me?

603
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,910
How can I finish them within one day?

604
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,120
You can also continue them tomorrow.

605
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,640
If you want a reward,

606
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,560
pay the price.

607
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,190
Sit down.

608
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,320
You think you have one day.

609
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,800
But only six hours left.

610
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,760
Miss Lu.

611
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,760
Are you still wasting time

612
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,870
in our conversation?

613
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,870
Ji Siqi, you...

614
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,070
You have five hours, fifty-nine minutes,
and fifty-four seconds.

615
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,880
You’re determined

616
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,510
to be a cruel urging machine, huh?

617
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,390
You want paintings, right?

618
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,950
I’ll give them to you in no time.

619
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,270
Wait.

620
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:35,950
Bad boy.

621
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,750
I know you can’t restrain yourself.

622
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,400
Are you kidding me?

623
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,520
With so many burdens on your nails,

624
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,480
how can you draw perfectly?

625
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,190
Cut them.

626
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,720
Fine. Fine.

627
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,200
I’ll cut them in the shop tomorrow.

628
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,360
But let me go today.

629
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,040
No, cut them now!

630
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,030
But I...

631
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,600
These are files for your paintings.

632
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,190
Call me if you need anything else.

633
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,230
I want to go out and be happy.

634
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
That’s simple.

635
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,830
After you complete your work.

636
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,030
You’re serious?

637
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,910
Do I look like I’m kidding?

638
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,150
Ji Siqi.

639
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,870
I understand your intention.

640
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,040
But such ways don’t work for me.

641
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:29,990
Others tried them before.

642
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,590
Continue?

643
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,790
Not until you complete the frontispiece.

644
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,120
You can’t do this to me.

645
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,190
I’m going to buy some water.

646
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,310
Why?

647
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,790
Leave after you flirted with me?

648
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:48,840
Solve the problem yourself.

649
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,960
When I’m back,

650
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,910
I’ll see the drafts, anyway.

651
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,190
I nearly trapped myself.

652
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,830
I’d better not play this trick again.

653
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,240
I gotta go.

654
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:07,800
Bye-bye.

655
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,120
See you.

656
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,310
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

Sure.

I used to make all promotion materials

for my idol.

664
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,760
Isn’t he the most popular actor?

665
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,680
What’s his name?

666

He’s the new best actor.

669

670

You pick someone you like again?

673

No.

674
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,390
He’s suitable.

675
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,670
Mr. Shao?

676
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,120
Why are you still here?

677
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,990
I was held up.

678
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,440
What about you?

679
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,350
Left something?

680
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,790
Oh, Mr. Shao,

681
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,720
I’ve decided the place

682
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,120
for Baby Seven’s Autograph Session.

683
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,840
I mailed you

684
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,870

685
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,800
I received that.

Oh,

687
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,000

Come on.

690
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,670
What do you think of it?

691
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,320
You want me to be frank?

692
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:42,990
Sure.

693
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,510
The pattern looks better
than the content.

694
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,440
Seems like

695
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,110
the author only knows about films,

696
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,430
but doesn’t have a specific plan.

697
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,200
She also hasn’t further studied

698
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,440
the IP value of Dress for the Beauty.

699
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,600
If I were you,

700
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,790
I would let her do it again.

701
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,600
If it can be done again,

702
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,150
does it mean the proposal can be used?

703
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,350
Sure.

704
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,920
Obviously,

705
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,510
the author worked hard on this project

706
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,160
and has deep feelings

707
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,230
for Dress for the Beauty.

708
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,270
I think this matters a lot.

709
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,110
But, Mr. Shao,

710
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,840
why are you suddenly interested

711
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,110
in this project?

712
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,720
Look.

713
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,150
I want you to take care of this project.

714
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,350
What do you think?

715
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,800
Do you want me
to take care of this project

716
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,750
or the author of this project?

717
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,670
You’re good at guessing.

718
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:33,950
How about a promotion for you?

719
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,630
You heard it, didn’t you?

720
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,950
Modify it, then.

721
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,280
She’s really experienced.

722
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,800
She saw the problem at a single glance.

723
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,720
Sure.

724
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,400
Or,

725
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,550
I wouldn’t have her take care of you.

726
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,400
You should

727
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,200
learn carefully from her.

728
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,120
When I’m away...

729
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:13,750
Away?

730
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,430
Where are you going?

731
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,040
Nowhere. Nothing.

732
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,000
Forget it.

733
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,670
You must be hungry.

734
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,030
I’m going to modify my proposal.

735
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,710
You suddenly work hard?

736
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:28,830
Wait and see.

737
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:29,840
I’ll make a perfect proposal

738
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,510
that everyone is satisfied with.

739
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,920
I’ve been out for one hour, huh?

740
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,110
But you drew nothing?

741
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,470
I have no inspiration.

742
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,390
Why don’t you continue it

743
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,070
to inspire me?

744
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,750
How would you like me to inspire you?

745
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,350
Hold my hand, at least.

746
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,870
It works.

747
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,750
Hurry up.

748
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,440
You can hold my hand
for five more minutes, at most.

749
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,310
How mean you are!

750
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,960
Miss Lu, you’re old but still vigorous.

751
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,520
Bad boy.

752
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,310
Take back that word!

753
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,400
I’ll take back my hand, too.

754
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,520
Wait a second.

755
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,750
Let me have more inspiration.

756
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,790
Time is up soon.

757
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,160
Why... Why?

758
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:57,910
Charging up.

759
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,950
Done.

760
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,670
Thank you, my little battery.

761
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,230
I’ll go have a nap.

762
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,860
(To Jia)

763
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,880
Oh, my God.

764
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,590
Miss Lu completed her paintings in time!

765
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,880
How did you make it?

766
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,870
Instruct me.

767
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,960
I can’t and I won’t!

768
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,670
Never think of it!

769
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,030
How mean!

770
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,030
But it’s not time to celebrate yet.

771
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,350
You just sent me the frontispiece.

772
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,510
Inside pages can be the hell.

773
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,030
Be specific.

774
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,400
Look at the eyes

775
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,270
and just feel it.

776
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,750
You went for a nap, didn’t you?

777
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:24,990
I couldn’t fall asleep.

778
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,750
I’ve completed my work.

779
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,670
Can’t I have a little reward?

780
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,400
You’ve pretended to be cool for long.

781
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,230
You must be tired.

782
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,880
Who pretended?

783
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,870
I was doing my duty as an editor.

784
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,870
Fine, Mr. Editor.

785
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,800
Do you dare

786
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,190
to stare at me for fifteen seconds?

787
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,360
What’s the trick?

788
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,630
You think you’re Cheon Song-Yi?

789
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,190
Let’s get started.

790
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:08,950
My eyes are dry.

791
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,750
It’s so hard when I can’t blink.

792
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,350
Don’t go.

793
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:18,830
Try it again.

794
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,270
Enjoy yourself alone!

795
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,870
I failed to kiss him.

796
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,350
