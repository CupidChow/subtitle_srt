00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,810
Qi Nian has it, I guess.

173
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,760
The second chapter has been done?

174
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,530
Awesome.

175
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,760
I can finish it before the deadline.

176
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,890
Thank you, Key.

177
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:25,390
Now you know how capable I am, huh?

178
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,670
Don’t fall in love with me.

179
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,910
Or I’ll be embarrassed.

180
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,420
Reply, could you?

181
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,590
You’re embarrassing me.

182
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,180
Yes, sir.

183
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,750
Okay, sir.

184
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,470
You have no sense of humor.

185
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,620
Have you finished storyboards
of the third chapter?

186
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,310
Soon, sir.

187
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,990
Forget that. Thank you.

188
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,700
(Missed Calls)

189
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:19,900
Hello?

190
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,300
Great.

191
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,430
You finally call me back!

192
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,750
What happened?

193
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,380
I don’t know why,

194
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,460
but I can’t open the PPT

195
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,270
in the USB.

196
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,350
Do you have a copy?

197
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,230
Only a half-done one in my computer.

198
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,860
What should I do?

199
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,150
The presentation is starting.

200
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,950
It’s all my fault.

201
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,350
Listen.

202
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:41,620
Postpone Prof. Ji’s presentation.

203
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,500
Before that,

204
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,740
I’ll complete it.

205
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,630
Understand?

206
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,110
Okay. Bye-bye.

207
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,740
Uh, Qi Nian,

208
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,060
I should go to work this afternoon.

209
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,820
I’ll go after finishing this one.

210
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,820
Is it okay for you to stay alone?

211
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,580
Yes.

212
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,420
Don’t worry.

213
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,750
I will finish it.

214
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,750
What are you up to?

215
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:12,780

I’m drawing for you,

216
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,750

but you’re doing something else.

217
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,340
This is the anti-fever medicine.

218
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,230
Take it on time.

219
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,510
I gotta go.

220
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,580
Deviation is 1.8.

221
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,670
Proportion of opening, right.

222
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,580
Load-bearing of columns and beams.

223
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,220
Right. All numbers are right.

224
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:42,860
Okay.

225
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:48,940
(Upload a new file)

226
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,590
I must upload it even if it’s too big.

227
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,470
One o’clock?

228
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,630
I’m going right away.

229
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,270
I will give it to you in time.

230
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,380
Qi Nian, try hard!

231
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,150
Big shots of the industry have come.

232
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,580
I assure you with my life

233
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,430
that I will arrive on time.

234
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:16,940
Prof. Ji.

235
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,140
Qi Nian has finished the PPT.

236
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:18,870
She’s coming.

237
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,310
Oh,

238
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,670
and this notebook.

239
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,270
She asked me to give this to you.

She told me

242
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,830
(Dongguan, Guangdong)
she wanted it to help you.

243
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,540
Well, I think

244
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,790
Qi Nian worked very hard.

Prof. Ji?

250
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:19,830
Here it is.

251
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,990
Why do you look so bad?

252
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,150
I’m fine.

253
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:34,940
Two minutes to go.

254
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:35,910
Get in.

255
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,870
I’m fine. Just get in.

256
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,950
I have three hours.

257
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,430
I must finish the comics.

258
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,390
Prof. Ji?

259
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,550
You can leave after the drip.

260
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,460
Prof. Ji, why are you here?

261
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,390
What about the symposium?

262
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,110
It’s been cancelled.

263
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,860
Cancelled? How is it possible?

264
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,510
The presentation started, didn’t it?

265
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,670
There was a power failure.

266
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,510
Even so, it can’t be cancelled.

267
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,420
It’s put off to tomorrow.

268
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,950
Kind of cancelled.

269
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,220
Heavens!

270
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,070
I thought...

271
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,870
I’ll go pay for the drip. Lay still.

272
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,860
I thought you missed
such an important event

273
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,510
just because of me.

274
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,410
Hello?

275
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,980
Qi Nian, you’re finally awake!

276
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,300
I was so anxious!

277
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,510
Why did you suddenly pass out?

278
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,620
Luckily, Prof. Ji rushed to you in time

279
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,830
and took you to hospital.

280
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:43,900
Honestly,

281
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,470
I’ve never seen him so anxious before.

282
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:47,990
Qi Nian.

283
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,060
Qi Nian, is that you?

284
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:50,830
Answer me!

285
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:51,870
Yes.

286
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,070
I’m glad you’re fine.

287
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,390
But,

288
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,100
Prof. Ji totally

289
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,510
missed the symposium.

290
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,710
What a pity!

291
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,790
It’s put off, isn’t it?

292
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,380
How is that possible?

293
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,300
Think about that.

294
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,180
How can those big shots’ schedule

295
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,590
be casually changed?

296
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,420
In a hurry,

297
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,060
Prof. Ji gave his PPT

298
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,750
to a new lecturer of our department.

299
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,180
Well,

300
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,990

301

302
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,260
I’ll say no more.

303
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,110
Take a good rest.

304
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:24,940
I’ll go visit you later.

305
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:25,670
Bye-bye.

306
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,190

Qi Nian!

309
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,070
What happened?

310
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,070
Why are you silent?

311
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,150

312
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,380
I’m sorry.

313
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,750
It was my fault.

314
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,580
If I had prepared

315
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,670
one more copy...

316
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,070
Well, it’s fine that you know.

317
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,110
But you don’t need to apologize.

318
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,110
But the symposium...

319
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,310
You brought me the USB
when you had a fever.

320
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,310
What were you thinking of?

321
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,540
I just didn’t want you

322
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,260
to miss such an important symposium.

323
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:41,750
Yes.

324
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,110
You made a choice.

325
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:45,860
To stay at home and get recovered

326
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,110
or to help me desperately...

327
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:48,990
You did the latter.

328
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,390
So did I.

329
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,830
I just made a choice.

330
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,190
So, you don’t need to apologize.

331
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,510

with true heart

345
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,150
can you make up good plots.

(Bus No.520
Starry Island to Huanghai Rd.)

347
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,860
Close your eyes.

348
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,350
Think of your favorite things.

349
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:07,830
What is it?

350
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,020
Ji Yanxin, I want to chase...

351
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:21,750
Are you getting on?

352
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,430
I’ll close the door.

00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,140
She’s confessing her love?

368
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,190
She is.

369
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,220
It’s okay. It’s okay.

370
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,300
Stop looking. Stop.

371
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:25,910
Stop.

372
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,190
I’ve never seen this before.

373
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,060
On my way back home,

374
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,020
I saw my boss being confessed to.

375
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,150
What do I do?

376
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,220
Boss?

377
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:38,660
Mr. Ji?

378
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,990
Ji Yanxin?

379
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,220
Who confessed to him?

380
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:41,740
How brave!

381
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,670
What’s happening?

382
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,230
My good friend.

383
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,150
Qi Nian.

384
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,220
Do you think we should talk about love

385
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,990
in public?

386
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,750
Well, let me ask more objectively.

387
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,390
Prof. Ji.

388
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,150
Can I pursue you?

389
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,210
Be serious.

390
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:06,990
Do I not look serious enough?

391
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,870
Is it because I’ve said that
for so many times?

392
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,260
Forget it, then.

393
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,300
If you want the sense of ritual,

394
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:13,780
I will...

395
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,550
Don’t bother.

396
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,950
I’m not good at dealing with this.

397
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,110
And I’ll get off at the next stop.

398
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,310
I don’t have time to discuss about that.

399
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,790
Sorry to tell you

400
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,100
our bus will not stop

401
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,790
on the cross-sea bridge.

402
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,910
It will go on the bridge and pass it.

403
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,780
There are twenty minutes
for love confession,

404
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,460
oh, no,

405
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,430
for driving.

406
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,630
What’s happening?

407
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,190
Even the driver helps them.

408
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,340
The man looks so handsome.

409
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,150
Prof. Ji.

410
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,390
Do you have enough time now?

411
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:49,870
Come with me.

412
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,470
There they come.

413
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:54,780
Hurry.

414
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,510
Go. Go. Go.

415
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,950
Let’s go have a look.

416
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:58,830
What?

417
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,590
When did you start it?

418
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,230
Your serious love.

419
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:09,550
Just now.

420
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,630
For less than five minutes.

421
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,140
Why do you think I should respond

422
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,310
to your impulsive love.

423
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,820
If you think it’s short,

424
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,990
I can like you for a longer time.

425
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:27,900
Or you can tell me

426
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,470
when you think I’m qualified.

427
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,630
I can tell you now.

428
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,150
They’ll kiss.

429
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,270
I’m not interested in love.

430
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:41,670
Do you hear me?

431
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:44,470
Yes.

432
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,610
Anyway, I know
I can’t get you right now.

433
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,900
Maybe I can start to chase you again.

434
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,080
I won’t disturb your daily life.

435
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,300
I swear.

436
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,580
What... What’s happening?

437
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,420
Did he agree

438
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,510
or disagree?

439
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,510
Please confirm it.

440
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:03,980
I should have got off,

441
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,340
but they haven’t
confirmed their relationship yet.

442
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,380
We should have, too.

443
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,180
Right?

444
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:07,660
Yes.

445
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,540
Yes.

446
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,310
Yes.

447
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,230
Be quiet and just listen!

448
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:25,870
Thank you.

449
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:36,550
Professor.

450
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,110
Does this mean yes?

451
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,310
Whatever.

452
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:57,940
Hello?

453
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,190
Baby Seven.

454
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:02,510
Are you still alive?

455
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,420
Come to me if you are!

456
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,910
Or I’ll go see you with a broadsword!

457
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:06,950
I am.

458
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,350
I see.

459
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,510
Bye-bye.

460
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,500
(MC)

461
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,270
I’m sorry.

462
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,020
Tell me.

463
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:25,830
Why are you sorry?

464
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,100
I missed the deadline

465
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,390
and held up my work.

466
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,510
I can hardly absolve myself
from the blame.

467
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,710
Please punish me.

468
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,670
But you handed in your comics.

469
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,060
An hour before the deadline.

470
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,030
You sent me, didn’t you?

471
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,390
He did that?

472
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,830
Then what wrong have I done?

473
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,430
I failed to contact you
the whole afternoon!

474
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,230
You hurt my enthusiasm

475
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,190
so that I couldn’t tell you
the good news immediately.

476
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,950
The Fresh Work Competition next month,

477
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,510
you’re in the selection.

478
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:13,510
Really?

479
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:14,980
Look from the bottom.

480
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,190
(Baby Seven)
The second. Look.

481
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:18,380
(Love Story of Comic Master)

482
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,340
Love Story...?

483
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,660
I named it temporarily.

484
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,550
Don’t complain.

485
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,350
What a naive name!

486
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,750
I just want you to change it!

487
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,020
Full-color pages.

488
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,630
You can complete them
before the selection, right?

489
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:31,940
Full-color pages?

490
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,660
Do you think I’m a spider with claws?

491
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,460
I have only two hands.

492
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,540
I can’t do it
even if I work around the clock.

493
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,630
Find yourself an assistant.

494
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:38,910
Like you did last time.

495
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,270
You realized that?

496
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:48,070
It’s not my first time
to read your comics!

497
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,700
Figures of this time

498
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,540
look much gentler.

499
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,110
Obviously, someone polished your comics.

500
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:57,510
He must know girl manga very well.

501
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,660
With his help,

502
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,910
you will pass the selection.

503
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,020
I don’t care.

504
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,660
You must ask him to help you.

505
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,180
But...

506
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,070
No buts.

507
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:06,790
This is an order!

508
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,670
I wonder if Key will help me.

509
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:22,660
(Listen to My Heart)

510
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,180
Look.

511
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:24,460
Look at this.

512
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,190
Come and look at this.

513
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,550
One more.

514
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:27,860
May I take a photo with you?

515
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:28,300
Three, two, one.

516
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,060

You know this?

539
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,310
It’s an old comic book.

540

It exposes my age.

What do you mean out-of-fashion?

When Chapter 22 was published,

I wrote a fan comic book.

00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,150
Sure. Sure. Sure.

599

Please have a look.

600
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,310
Look, look, look.

(Flower & Romance)
The beautiful cartoonist,

602

who has many popular comic books

603
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,380
and is always No.1
on the business value list,

604

Lu Qingwu.

605
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,260
Shut up.

606
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,860
I don’t want to hear this name.

607
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,340
But she looks good.

608
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,390
She’s talented and pretty.

609
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,500
Why don’t you like her?

610
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,470
Look at her first comic book.

611
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,030
Thither Cloud?

612
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,900
Qiyue Qingwu was her pseudonym.

613
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,340
It’s your favorite comic book, isn’t it?

614
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,190
She drew that?

615
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,740
Yes, as written in public information.

616
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:03,590
But I don’t admit that.

617
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,070
Why?

618
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,390
It was her first comic book.

619
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,700
But after she got famous,

620
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,150
she denied it and depreciated it.

621
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:12,820
An ungrateful author like her

622
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,510
will never be a guru in my heart.

623
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,940
Come on.

624
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,980
You just set a high demand on her.

625
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,540
You’re no longer a fan
and just speak ill of her.

626
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,950
If I’m her fan, I’ll be a coward!

627
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,510
What do you think?

628
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,550
You really drew it?

629
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,260
When being first published,

630
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,390
hundreds of books were sold.

631
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,990
People around me said I was talented.

632
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,460
I have a plan

633
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,550
to be a cartoonist.

634
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,180
(Under the Sakura Tree)

635
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:54,870
Are you kidding me?

636
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,100
Before you say you’re talented,

637
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,550
try to know your limitations!

638
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,430
Keep your dream within bounds.

639
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,030
Stop.

640
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,430
Why do you think you can comment on her?

641
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,470
Apologize to her.

642
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,150
I can.

643
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,620
Do you know who I am?

644
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:15,700
You don’t even dare to show your face.

645
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,710
Who knows?

646
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:28,860
Lu...

647
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:29,630
Shut up.

648
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,990
Rookies!

649
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,390
You mustn’t draw my characters anymore.

650
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,070
Who wants to draw your characters?

651
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,750
How self-sentimental you are!

652
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,220
All right. All right.

653
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,660
She doesn’t draw very well, either.

654
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,630
Don’t be depressed.

655
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,070
It’s always rude of her.

656
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:13,740
Uh... Uh...

657
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:15,540
You said hundreds of books were sold.

658
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,270
Really?

659
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,870
I don’t draw very poorly, do I?

660
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,630
You don’t. You don’t.

661
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,660
The assistant we said just now.

662
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,270
I think it’s not so possible.

663
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,110
Why?

664
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,500
You know, how many of we cartoonists

665
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,540
can stand loneliness?

666
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,620
If I were him,

667
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,620
I would participate in 101 directly.

668
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,750
That can help me become popular faster.

669
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,300
My hands are greasy.
Do you have tissues?

670
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,690
So are my hands.

671
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:41,030
In my pocket. Get them yourself.
