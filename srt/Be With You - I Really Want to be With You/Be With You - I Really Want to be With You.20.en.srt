Miss Lu,

21
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,000
you’ve been sleeping for 2 hours.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,870
Time to work.

23
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,910
You have over 20 pages’ content to draw.

Just a little longer. A few minutes.

25
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,160
Either you get out now,
or I carry you out in my arms.

26
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,790
In your arms?

27
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,880
Am I the kind of girl

28
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,110
who gives in to a hug?

29
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,470
Yes, I am.

30
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,110
Hug me.

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,070

Qi Nian is with you, right?

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,030
Yes, what’s up?

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,710
OK, listen.

41
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:09,840
Watch her.

But I never expected that

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,670
you’re their target.

51
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,950
According to some insider,

52
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,560
Dress for the Beauty

53
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,270
is a plagiarism by Baby Seven.

54
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,680
It’s said to seek attention,

55
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,150
Baby Seven describes it
as a record of her experience.

56
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,430
They say she’s a liar.

Qi Nian.

Leave it.

60
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,910
I didn’t lie.

61
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,590
I know you didn’t.

62
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,960
OK, I’ll leave it to you.

63
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,590
Gotta go.

64
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,910
I want to go to work tomorrow.

66
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,670
Almost.

67
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,880
Even if it’s not,

68
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,830
I have no holidays left.

69
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,990
I’ve got work to do
for the Autograph Session.

70
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,030
It can be postponed.

71
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,480

to those rumormongers.

78
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,350
No need.

79
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,240
To them,

80
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,630
my justification means nothing.

81
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,430
They only believe what they believe.

82
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,310
It’s always been like this.

83
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,140
What do you mean always?

84
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,030
Did it happen to you before?

85
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,070
Can we drop it?

86
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,190
I want to take a shower.

87
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,950
Are you talking to your breath?

88
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,150
Move. Use your fingers.

89
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,790
No inspiration.

90
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,110
How can we give you inspiration?

91
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,350
I want to see the sea.

92
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,030
Come with me to see the sea, OK?

93
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,680
It takes too much time.

94
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,510
Are there simpler ways?

95
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,300
Simpler?

96
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,750
Take me to my bedroom.

97
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:57,170
Stop.

98
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,440
I’m not catnip.

99
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,520
You’re like a cat addicted to catnip.

100
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,350
Do you wanna do that
each time before work?

101
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,480
Do you demand all your ex-assistants

102
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,800
to do that?

103
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,430
No, no.

104
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,190
I’m just addicted to you.

105
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,040
So,

106
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,360
you slacked on your job in these years

107
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,510
because I wasn’t with you.

108
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,150
Yes, smarty pants.

109
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,870
You’re my sweetie indeed.

110
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,230
Cut it.

111
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,870
Are you gonna draw or not?

112
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,160
I don’t mind Thither Cloud is doomed.

113
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,840
Now you want to hire a ghost-drawer?

114
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,600
Where is your dignity

115
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,910
as a cartoonist?

116
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:32,800
Yeah.

117
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,260
I have no dignity,

118
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,630
nor professional morality.

119
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,430
I don’t care about the 20-page story.

120
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,030
Find someone to do it.

121
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,350
Stay right there.

122
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,710
Do you think

123
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,000
you have nothing to do

124
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,880
with the poor quality

125
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,790
if you don’t draw it?

126
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,720
You draw the covers but not the story.

127
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,790
What are you hiding from?

128
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,670
Who is your identity to ask that?

129
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,470
My editor?

130
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,430
An anti-fan?

131
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,870
Or my boyfriend?

132
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,440
I...

133
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,320
Never mind. I don’t want to listen.

134
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:09,990
Leave me alone.

135
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,150
Mr. Ji, you’re still up?

136
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,950
I can walk.

137
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,630
I can’t allow it.

138
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,310
I told you not to force yourself.

139
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,840
Mr. Ji, I can...

140
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,510
What? You want to dry your hair?

141
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,760
I don’t want to be a bother.

142
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,520
I don’t mind.

143
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,160
And today

144
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,680
is the last day of your holiday.

145
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,520
It’s OK.

146
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,910
I can drop by occasionally.

147
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,470
Not OK to me.

148
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,510
Do you know withdrawal syndrome?

149
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,680
When one’s deeply in love with someone,

150
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,030
he can’t stand a second without her.

151
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,270
Do you know who I’m referring to?

152
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,150
Me.

153
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,270
How are you gonna make it up to me?

154
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,710
What do you want?

155
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,750
Raise your hands.

156
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,640
You lay on my legs for long.

157
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,830
I want it back.

158
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,120
Mr. Ji, you’re so...

159
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,470
So what? Shameless?

160
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,790
No, no, no.

161
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,000
You’re so sociable today.

162
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,880
Did I press the wrong button

163
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,270
on you?

164
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,110
I can’t sleep. Tell me a story.

165
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,840
Do you like the Grimm’s

166
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,430
or Andersen’s Fairy Tales?

167
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,680
The Little Red Riding Hood.

168
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,310
OK.

169
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:41,590
Little Red Riding Hood’s grandma
is a wolf.

170
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,710
The wolf is actually...

171
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,110
I don’t remember.

172
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,590
Then tell me about you,

173
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:52,950
Baby Seven.

174
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,310
Wait.

175
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,710
I should call you,

176
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,150
Qiyue Qingwu.

177
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,960
Now that you’re asleep,

178
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,070
let me tell you a secret.

179
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:11,990
I’m

180
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,830
actually a cartoonist.

181
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,190
Now I’m Baby Seven.

182
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,250
In the past, my pen name

183
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,030
is Qiyue Qingwu.

184
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,950
You were not asleep?

185
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,710
You knew I was a cartoonist.

186
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,670
So you can search Qiyue Qingwu

187
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,310
and find all my stories.

188
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,070
I want to hear it from you.

189
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,030
In high school,

190
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,920
I met my first partner

191
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,310
of my life in comic.

192
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,150
She’s also my mentor.

193
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,800
She told me

194
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,630
drawing can be more than a hobby.

195
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,160
It can be a career

196
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,830
which I can devote my life on.

197
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,070
Be a cartoonist.

198
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,880
Let’s make ourselves

199
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,670
famous together.

200
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,830
I’m Lu Qingwu.

201
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,750
Qi Nian.

202
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,830
What?

203
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,710
You’re so noisy.

204
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,190
You quit your job

205
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,280
to get drunk?

206
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,160
Come out.

207
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:51,830
What?

208
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,470
You were also drunk in this tub.

209
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,070
And I bought it.

210
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,470
I can do whatever I want with it.

211
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,230
OK.

212
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,640
You can take it out on me.

213
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,550
I don’t mind.

214
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,880
Before you make it clear,

215
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,990
no one gets out of here.

216
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,350
Tell me.

217
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,430
What’s the reason you quit?

218
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,030
Ji Siqi.

219
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,310
Are you still Qiyue Qingwu’s fan?

220
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,870
Always. Why?

221
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,790
Congratulations!

222
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,160
You’re about to be the fourth person

223
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,630
to know the truth about her.

224
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,070
Qiyue Qingwu

225
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,670
is actually a group of two.

226
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,830
The person you admire

227
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,790
isn’t me,

228
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,470
but someone else.

229
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,590
I led her in the comic circle.

230
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,710
I introduced her to an agent,

231
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,750
my editor then,

232
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,870
Xiao Li.

233
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,280
To work with Miss Lu?

234
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,080
Yeah.

235
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,630
You both have your pros and cons.

236
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,830
Your drawings are grand and exquisite.

237
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,840
You’re good

238
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,230
in both the values and the storyline.

239
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,750
But you’re terrible with figures.

240
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,110
This is your hero.

241
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,230
Your heroine

242
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,310
and other roles.

243
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,390
Did you see the problem?

244
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,430
They all have similar looks.

245
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,790
Right.

246
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,680
Are you obsessed with your hero?

247
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,990
Everybody you draw looks like him.

248
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,790
I’m poor at figures.

249
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,080
That’s why your drawings

250
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,400
and stories are both excellent,

251
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,910
but you haven’t won fame.

252
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,870
However,

253
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,070
Lu’s good at figures.

254
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,790
So you’re a good team.

255
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,870
You write stories and draw.

256
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,510
Lu takes care of the figures.

257
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,350
I can say

258
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,430
the work will become a hit.

259
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,350
Xiao Li’s really got an eye.

260
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,200
Our work,

261
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,600
Thither Cloud became

262
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,790
the bestseller of the year.

263
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,150
And Qiyue Qingwu

264
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,390
became a rising star

265
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,470
and won the highest glory in comics

266
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,350
to be engraved on the Silver Quill Cup.

267
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,230
And only one person

268
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,310
went to receive the award.

269
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,150
Lu Qingwu, right?

270
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,680
That’s also the only official record

271
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,910
of Qiyue Qingwu.

272
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,990
So what is the other person

273
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,670
in Qiyue Qingwu like?

274
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,830
She’s a genius.

275
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,830
In contrast,

276
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,270
I’m just an eye candy.

277
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,030
Without her,

278
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,150
I wouldn’t have completed Thither Cloud.

279
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,710
So I chose to make a fresh start.

280
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,750
I’d rather draw

281
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,390
some boring stories

282
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,910
than live in her shadow.

283
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,670
But I found

284
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,350
talent cannot be learnt.

285
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,870
However hard I try,

286
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,680
I cannot make another comic

287
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,030
equal to Thither Cloud.

288
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,990
So what’s the point of trying?

289
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,600
She took the glory

290
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,760
that belongs to you both.

291
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,550
But you didn’t expose it.

292
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,080
It crossed my mind.

293
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,160
But when we came around,

294
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,310
I had dropped in the trap she set up.

295
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,320
Before I handed in

296
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,830
the drafts of Thither Cloud,

297
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,230
I met Xiao Li.

298
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,800
Are these the last drafts?

299
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,080
Yeah, I’ll have the ECC exam soon

300
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,400
and can’t use Internet for a month.

301
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,840
So I won’t be able to log in

302
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,430
Qiyue Qingwu’s account.

303
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,750
It’s OK.

304
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,960
Leave it to me and Lu.

305
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,840
Prepare yourself for the exam.

306
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,470
OK.

307
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,510
I’m sorry. Sorry. My fault.

308
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,070
It crashed. What now?

309
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,910
Got water in the motherboard maybe.

310
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,110
It’s my fault.

311
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,230
Look,

312
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,400
I’ll take it for repair.

313
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,070
I’ll give you a new laptop.

314
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,030
Thanks then.

315
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,080
I never thought

316
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,720
behind his seemingly sincere apology

317
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,750
was an evil plot.

318
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,960
Due to network outage,

319
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,880
I didn’t know my signature was removed

320
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,710
at the first time.

321
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,520
The laptop with my drafts

322
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,630
were in their possession.

323
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,080
And they changed the password

324
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,310
to Qiyue Qingwu’s account.

325
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,710
I had no proof to justify myself.

326
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,800
Even when

327
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,670
I was defamed,

328
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,190
I couldn’t explain.

329
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,110
How did they defame you?

330
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,880
I had a few drawings of Thither Cloud

331
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,230
posted on my other account.

332
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,160
Somehow,

333
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,950
they were posted on the blog.

334
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,600
Back then, the fans were

335
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,190
convinced I copied Lu Qingwu’s drawings.

336
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,270
The abuses didn’t stop
until I cancelled my account.

337
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,520
I was notorious.

338
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,150
If MC didn’t take me in,

339
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,470
I’d quit comics.

340
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,230
So I change my style and pen name

341
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,680
and convert to my downside area,

342
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,430
girl manga.

343
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,920
I don’t want to be involved

344
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,030
in the painful past.

345
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:04,990
That’s all.

346
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,110
Am I like an ostrich

347
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,710
who escapes from troubles?

348
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,120
But I don’t want to live through

349
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,310
another nightmare.

350
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,470
And I don’t want Xin to worry.

351
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:19,750
Stop.

352
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,870
I respect your decision.

353
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,030
But I’m protective.

354
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,470
Can you take care of it

355
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,030
before I step in?

356
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:30,990
Yes.

357
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:34,750
But,

358
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,270
don’t jump to conclusions.

359
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,470
Maybe there’s another story behind it.

360
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,990
So who is it that stole

361
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,870
your partner’s authorship?

362
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,310
You also think it’s me?

363
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,350
You think I took her authorship?

364
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,910
If I told you

365
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,550
she betrayed me first,

366
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,870
would you believe it?

367
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,960
(Termination Contract)

368
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,030
Termination?

369
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,230
Quit my authorship?

370
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,740
(Party A: Qi Nian)

371
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,710
Why did she do that?

372
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,910
It was her decision.

373
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,190
Perhaps she had another plan,

374
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,350
reluctant to be bonded with you.

375
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,390
Maybe she didn’t want you as a partner.

376
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,500
(Party A: Qi Nian)

377
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,270
Qi Nian, call me.

378
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,440
Qi Nian, I need to talk to you.

379
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,630
Call me immediately.

380
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,270
Stop texting me.

381
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,670
Then I was blacklisted.

382
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,230
And she disappeared from my world.

383
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,950
We broke off contact.

384
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,870
When we met again,

385
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,590
she pretended to be a victim.

386
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,150
An award doesn’t necessarily mean good.

387
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:25,910
In these years,

388
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,630
I’ve been restrained by Thither Cloud.

389
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,830
However hard I try,

390
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,830
they compare my works with it.

391
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,870
I’ve been living in her shadow.

392
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,830
Even you the layman

393
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,870
dare to point fingers at me.

394
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,950
I wish I didn’t take the award.

395
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,110
I wish

396
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,630
I were still a third-rate cartoonist.

397
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,590
What’s going on?

398
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,470
If it isn’t your fault,

399
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,910
then who is behind all these?

400
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,470
Lu Qingwu?

401
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,590
Lu Qingwu?

402
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,710
What is she thinking?

403
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,800
Sleeping here

404
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,840
as an intern?

405
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,670
Let her sleep.

406
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,760
Sometimes, we need to show our care

407
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,430
to those who work overtime.

408
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,240
But we...

409
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:39,840
It’s OK.

410
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,870
Let’s have the meeting over there.

411
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,070
Come on.

412
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,670
Give me a break, sweetie.

413
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,190
You said no sleeping over.

414
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,630
Why are you in my bed now?

415
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,480
You were hopelessly drunk last night.

416
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,710
How could I leave you alone?

417
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,990
Are you gonna hasten me today,

418
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,150
my dear editor?

419
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,870
I’ve done the job for you.

420
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,350
Really?

421
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,700
(Me)

422
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,680
If a paid drawer is needed,

423
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,080
it’d better be me.

424
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,400
At least no one knows better than I do

425
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,480
how to make up for your weaknesses.

426
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,590
I’m an anti-fan, remember?

427
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,150
But why?

428
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,280
I know you have a problem.

429
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,270
So I’m not gonna press you.

430
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,280
When you let it go someday,

431
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,110
we’ll talk about it.

432
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,680
Alright.

433
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,160
I’ve been here for all night.

434
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,000
Time to go home.

435
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,910
No, no.

436
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,350
I’d be an idiot to let you go.

437
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,350
Move over to me, OK?

438
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:16,920
I need to go home.

439
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,550
What’s wrong?

440
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,800
It’s a long story.

441
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,080
Anyway, don’t come to me lately.

442
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:23,600
See you later.

443
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,270
Why?

444
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,430
What...?

445
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,990
What’s wrong with him?

446
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,550
What a good time you choose to call me.

447
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,270
Come. I’ll introduce someone to you.

448
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,600
You slept for over an hour,

449
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,230
you know?

450
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,790
Over an hour?

451
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,680
From now on,

452
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,430
you’ll be famous for overtime work

453
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,910
and sleeping at work. How nice!

454
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,230
Any premium?

455
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,710
Maybe a raise?

456
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,200
Can you please say something realistic?

457
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,870
You expect a premium for sleeping?

458
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,190
How about a fancy dinner?

459
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,510
The capitalist’s sugarcoated bullet.

460
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,270
Did you forget what day it is?

461
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,870
What day is it?

462
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,560
Yeah, Baby Seven’s Autograph Session.

463
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,880
I wasted all night.

464
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,990
How could I forget it?

465
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,920
Aren’t you gonna wash up?

466
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,350
I... I’ll do it in the bathroom.

467
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,710
Don’t forget our dinner.

468
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:43,790
OK.

469
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,710
Last 14 hours.

473
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,510
Has the Autograph Session started?

474
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,990
Not yet, but soon.

475
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,710
Is it too late to run away?

476
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,030
Why would you want to run away?

477
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,310
You know the comments online.

478
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,630
What if no one comes today?

479
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,030
Why don’t you check it out later?

480
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,840
You should meet the fans who come

481
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,030
at a time like this, shouldn’t you?

482
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,430
It’s time. Let’s go to the venue.

483
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:39,950
OK.

Nervous?

486
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:51,800
Is my look

487
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,470
weird?

488
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,950
I think my face is stiff.

489
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:00,550
Not at all. You’re charming.

490
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,720
Oh, hey, are you here?

491
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,310
Where are you?

492

Don’t worry. I’m with you.

Yeah.

Hurry.

Come on. Let’s sit here.

I’ll sit here.

505

I’m so happy.

506
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,320
Come on. Over there.

507

Hurry. Move.

508

Keep going. Keep going.

509
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,280
How about here?

510
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,080
I’ve waited for long.

511
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,000
Finally a new book.

512
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,790
Yeah.

513

Why do you want to meet here?

514

Good.

516
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,960
You know you have business to do.

517
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,630
It seems you’re not blinded by love.

518
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,150
Stop mocking at me.

519
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,550
Tell me. Who is this big shot

520
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,630
I have to meet in person?

521
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,110
Do you know Galaxy Productions?

522
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,680
Is it

523
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,630
the company good at IP adaptations?

524
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,350
What?
You wanna work with them on a film?

525
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,150
It’s one of the top film productions.

526
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,670
Flower & Romance

527
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,550
is also a top IP.

528
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,030
It surely deserves top resources.

529
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,720
We can’t allow some third-rater

530
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,120
to steal our spotlight.

531
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,030
Third-rater?

532
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,190
Who are you referring to?

533
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,430
You have no sense of crisis.

534
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,400
Anyway, the company’s boss

535
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,310
is on a domestic research on cartoon IP.

536
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,630
If we get the deal,

537
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,710
we’ll get the top resources.

538
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,560
So whatever it takes,

539
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,870
we must get it.

540
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,040
(Dress for the Beauty by Baby Seven)
And now, we’re ready

541
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,150
(Dress for the Beauty by Baby Seven)
for your questions.

542
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,640
In my hand

543
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,080
are questions collected from the fans.

544
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,600
Miss Baby Seven,

545
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,880
are you ready?

546
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,790
Ready.

547
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,080
OK.

548
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,800
First question.

549
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,520
If you’re Xiaoqi,

550
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,430
how would you describe Mr. J?

551
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,630
Quiet, charming and mine.

552
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,510
What does Mr. J often say to Xiaoqi?

553
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,790
Quiet. Shut up. Wait.

554
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,230
OK.

555
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,070
What does Xiaoqi want to say to Mr. J?

556
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,950
Marry me or leave me.

557
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,830
Marry me or leave me.

558
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,480
If you’re getting married,

559
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,630
who will propose?

560
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,200
Excuse me, wait a moment.

561
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,110
Come here.

562
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:52,910
Excuse us.

563
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,470
What’s wrong?

564
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,800
Is it a question from the fans?

565
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,070
Or you’re doing someone a favor?

566
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,870
No, definitely not.

567
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:06,320
A fan wants Xiaoqi to woo Mr. J.

568
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,190
Can you do that?

569
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,230
Who wrote down the question?

570
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,480
I can’t.

571
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,110
The “Give Me Your Heart” gestures.

572
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,510
Pass on all gestures and moves.

573
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,200
OK, OK.

574
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,320
Last question.

575
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,240
Is Mr. J’s story based on someone

576
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,790
in your life?

577
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,720
The comic, Dress for the Beauty,

578
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,190
records how I pursue him.

579
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,680
So romantic.

580
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,320
-That’s swag.
-Yeah!

581
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,040
There are a lot of rumors

582
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,760
on the Internet about this work.

583
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,230
I want to tell you

584
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,400
that they’re not true.

585
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,800
Though imagination

586
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,510
is part of the creation.

587
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,120
But you like it.

588
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,590
And it’s real.

589
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,230
I promise.

590
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,240
Baby Seven, we do trust you.

591
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,280
But isn’t Mr. J’s presence

592
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,430
the only way to dispel rumors?

593
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,680
Yes. Right.

594
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,960
If he’s as perfect as the man is

595
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,480
in your story,

596
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,840
you should introduce him to us.

597
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,480
Right?

598
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,040
-Yes.
-Right.

599
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:11,920
Introduce him to us.

600
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,640
I know what you mean.

601
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,040
But compared to my innocence,

602
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,750
I prefer

603
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,920
to leave his life undisturbed.

604
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,880
So I hope you all

605
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,240
can give us some privacy.

606
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:22,950
Thank you.

607
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:24,920
OK.

608
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,830
So much for the Q & A.

609
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:29,560
Now let’s move on

610
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,080
to the benefits Baby Seven

611
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,960
prepares for you.

612
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,880
We’ll make a drawing for a fan

613
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,960
who has been

614
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,960
chosen by our platform.

615
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,640
He’s also a big fan

616
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,870
of Dress for the Beauty.

617
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,700
Mr. J!

618
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,190
The man in the fairy tale is here.

619
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,080
It’s really Mr. J.

620
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:47,710
It’s him!

621
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,150
Really.

622
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,190
Please remain calm. Be seated.

623
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,320
OK, let’s welcome this fan

624
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,310
to introduce himself.

625
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,760
Hello, everyone.

626
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,960
My name is Ji,

627
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,550
a big fan of Baby Seven.

628
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:04,950
Also,

629
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,270
I’m her boyfriend.

630
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,400
Boyfriend?

631
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:09,760
So romantic.

632
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,390
I’m so jealous.

633
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,710
He said that?

634
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,960
What now? It’s the hot search.

635
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,590
Is it?

636
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,800
Mr. Ji, doesn’t it bother you?

637
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,870
Why would it?

638
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,600
Look at this picture.

639
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,280
(Mr. J together with Xiaoqi)
The picture has been posted online.

640
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,000
Your personal info will be disclosed.

641
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,110
Aren’t you worried about the impact?

642
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,600
So?

643
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,270
Will you be my girlfriend?

644
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,640
Explain compared to your innocence,

645
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,670
you prefer to leave my life undisturbed.

646
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,390
When did I ever need your protection?

647
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,120
But...

648
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,480
Those who need your protection

649
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,560
at the price of your innocence

650
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,990
don’t deserve you.

651
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,470
Love does not live on sacrifice.

652
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,750
But you’ve made sacrifices for me.

653
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,950
The rumors online would do me no harm.

654
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,270
Am I a weak man in your eyes?

655
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,000
All right. Stop thinking about it.

656
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,910
In fact,

657
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,110
I’m here to claim the benefits.

658
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,590
What benefits?

659
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,190
(The “Give Me Your Heart” gestures)
You promise to woo and propose.

660
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,030
It’s you.

661
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,990
Time to honor your promise, Baby Seven.

662
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,680
Excuse me, are you Miss Qi?

663
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,790
You are...?

664
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,070
I’m the assistant
to Galaxy Productions’ producer.

665
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,990
This is my boss’s card.

666
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,870
(Pei Yan Producer)
Pei Yan?

667
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,480
My boss has great interest

668
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,600
in your works.

669
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,360
When it’s convenient for you,

670
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,440
could we set up a meeting?

671
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,320
We’ll go when the session is over.

672
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,240
OK.

673
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,560
We’ll come and pick you up.

674
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:58,230
OK.

675
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,270
You know his boss?

676
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,910
Qi Nian, what are you doing here?

677
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,560
The fans are waiting
for a photo with you.

678
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,230
Coming.

679
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,030
Hey, Ji Yanxin.

680
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,760
We’ve had a few pots of tea.

681
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,990
When are they coming?

682
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,030
Did I say I have an appointment?

683
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,710
No? Then what are we doing here?

684
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:41,910
Goodbye.

685
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,390
Be patient.

686
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:47,950
She’s here.

687
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,630
It’s very nice to meet you, Ms. Pei.

688
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,880
Excuse me, do I know you?

689
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,280
Xiao Li from Rongpin Culture.

690
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,480
In the conference last week,

691
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,430
we talked about
the adaptation of cartoons.

692
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,150
Mr. Xiao, right?

693
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,390
What a coincidence!

694
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,830
Allow me to introduce her.

695
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,390
This is the star of our company

696
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,470
I talked about.

697
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,360
The author

698
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,960
of the most popular comic,
Flower & Romance,

699
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,590
Lu Qingwu.

700
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:27,790
Miss Lu.

701
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,390
The Queen of girl manga.

702
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,710
What an honor!

703
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:32,920
The honor is mine, Ms. Pei.

704
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,480
You flattered me.

705
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,150
Nice to meet you.

706
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,270
Please, be seated.

707
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:43,560
Have some tea, Miss Lu.

708
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,230
Thank you.

709
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,030
Mr. Xiao.

710
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,550
Right,

711
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,320
isn’t the most popular comic now

712
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,190
Dress for the Beauty?

713
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,990
Ms. Pei, that’s the rank of last month.

714
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,430
We’re way ahead on top

715
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,230
of the annual rank.

716
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,560
Yes, you are on top.

717
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,430
But,

718
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,030
not way ahead, I think.

719
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,280
As far as I can see,

720
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,120
given Dress for the Beauty’s popularity,

721
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,400
in no less than three months,

722
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,350
it’ll become equally popular.

723
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,470
Sorry.

724
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:16,760
I prefer to

725
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,680
let the figure speak itself.

726
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,230
I mean no contempt

727
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,910
for Flower & Romance.

728
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,310
That comic is indeed popular.

729
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,030
But for adaptation,

730
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,390
temporary popularity isn’t enough.

731
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,270
It depends on the fans base.

732
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,630
Baby Seven’s fans on Weibo

733
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,910
are far less than ours.

734
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,430
Right.

735
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,640
But you may have forgotten, Mr. Xiao,

736
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,000
for adaptation,

737
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,480
the most important thing

738
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,590
is the comic itself.

739
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,400
In the comic,

740
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,360
Dress for the Beauty,

741
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,670
I saw the author’s sincerity.

742
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,350
Most top IPs don’t have it.

743
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,430
I wonder if the IPs that lack sincerity

744
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,310
include my work.

745
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,070
Works do not aim for the money

746
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,280
and that aren’t cookie-cutter comics

747
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,790
have to be excluded.

748
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,270
Ms. Pei,

749
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,590
we sincerely wish to work with you.

750
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,110
You have your standards.

751
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,470
But in terms of comics,

752
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,310
Flower & Romance

753
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,990
is undoubtedly the best girl manga IP.

754
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,550
The investment risk is much lower

755
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,790
than other works.

756
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,710
So please reconsider it.

757
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,840
What’s more there to say?

758
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,480
Don’t you see it?

759
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,790
She has an ideal choice.

760
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,800
Since her taste is poor,

761
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,710
there’s no need to say more.

762
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,000
Ms. Pei, I’m sorry.

763
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,520
Ms. Pei, are you OK?

764
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,150
Yes, I’m fine.

765
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,910
Sorry for your clothes.

766
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,360
Let me pay for it.

767
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,470
I said I’m fine.
