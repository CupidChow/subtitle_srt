=Episode 6=

20
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,770
The affection that can become habit

21
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,170
already exceeded the affection itself.

22
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,410
Are they the keys to my place?

23
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,040
What is the extra one?

24
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,170
The key of my house.

25
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,400
I’m busy this afternoon.

26
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,690
Can you watch the house for me?

27
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,120
OK.

28
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,280
Thanks for your breakfast.

29
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,330
And, well done.

30
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,160
Qi Bao,

31
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,280
did you hear what your master

32
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,290
told me just now?

33
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,770
Not “well done”.

34
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,960
Not “watch the house for me”.

35
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,160
The words before that.

36
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,130
He said “affection”! To me!

37
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,570
I heard that word clearly!

38
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,610
Did I misunderstand it

39
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,050
and think too much?

40
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,170
Stop barking.

41
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,120
Anyway, you just can’t understand.

42
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,090
You can ask him after he comes back.

43
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,240
Where are you going?

44
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,290
Where are you going again?

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,760
Ma’am.

46
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,720
How can I help you?

47
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,650
Ice shake lemon tea. Normal ice.

48
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,450
Change plain syrup to raspberry.

49
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,250
Lemon tea to hibiscus tea.

50
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,290
No shake. Thanks.

51
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,930
This…

52
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,330
What? You don’t even know
the hidden menu?

53
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,360
Your drink will be here in a minute.

54
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,130
Please wait a moment.

55
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,290
Where is the boy good at Latte Art?

56
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,730
He is not on duty today?

57
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,530
He resigned.

58
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,530
Coming!

59
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,490
Wait… You…

60
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,080
Don’t bother to check.

61
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,160
This is Ji Yanxin’s house.

62
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,120
You have three choices.

63
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,520
A. I live with him.

64
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,600
B. He can’t live without me

65
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,720
and we are inseparable.

66
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,650
C. Because of some indescribable reason.

67
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,970
Wait. Wait.

68
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,210
Why are these three
choices progressive?

69
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,050
I see.

70
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,560
You must be dumped by him

71
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,280
and you can’t give up.

72
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,650
So you became a stalking fan. Right?

73
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,410
That’s the normal fan’s routine.

74
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,450
But, people should have bottom lines.

75
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,140
I will give you three seconds.

76
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,680
If you don’t go,

77
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,810
I will call the police.

78
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,140
(Ji Yanxin)

79
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,450
What?

80
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,330
Qiu?

81
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,570
Yanxin… Yanxin…

82
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,850
I allowed her. Don’t think too much.

83
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:47,920
Qi Nian.

84
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,690
Yes, professor?

85
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,400
Before I go back home,

86
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:51,490
treat my guest well.

87
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:53,650
OK.

88
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:56,880
Look.

89
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,970
I think this one is not bad.

90
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,640
Let’s finish the meeting

91
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,520
within ten minutes.

92
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,080
Can you do this?

93
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,920
I know

94
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,690
Alright.

95
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,760
Let’s talk about

96
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,970
the renovation project of ancient
buildings throughout the city.

97
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,010
Your coke.

98
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,130
Thank you.

99
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,250
What’s wrong?

100
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,330
I failed to see him.

101
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,570
That boy left?

102
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,040
He said he finally found his dream job.

103
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,730
So he made the call and resigned.

104
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,690
The kids now are really passionate.

105
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,760
Don’t worry.

106
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,490
Rongpin never lacks handsome boys.

107
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,160
That’s not the problem.

108
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,560
He just argued against me last time.

109
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,730
I haven’t fought him back yet.

110
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,210
It’s OK.

111
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,400
There are many pretty kids
among the Post-95s.

112
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,120
I will ask the Personnel Manager

113
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,360
to hire some more handsome boys.

114
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,330
Stop.

115
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,210
I have got so many handsome losers.

116
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,410
They have nothing except pretty faces.

117
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,690
I don’t even remember their names.

118
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,840
How many times have I told them

119
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,130
not to give me a video call
when I’m outside?

120
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,080
Jia, what’s up?

121
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,650
Have you finished the work I gave you?

122
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,680
Hello, Miss Lu!

123
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,840
When will you come back?

124
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,000
I miss you.

125
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I miss you too, Miss Lu.

126
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,640
Today’s voting, hitting and signing in

127
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,480
have all been finished!

128
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,360
And the black posts

129
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,720
on the square have also been purified.

130
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,320
Later

131
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,520
I will organize people to comment
the marketing accounts.

132
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,600
Don’t worry!

133
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,680
Your data this month

134
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,800
will still be the top!

135
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,640
-Don’t worry.
-Top!

136
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,680
We’ll do our best!

137
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,720
Great!

138
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,800
Thank you guys!

139
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,570
I will take souvenirs for you!

140
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:37,880
Thank you!

141
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,080
Thank you!

142
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,170
Go!

143
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,610
They are so old but still acting cutely.

144
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,490
Why is there no one
who scold them to wake them up?

145
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,810
You’re the boss. You can do it.

146
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,090
I can’t say anything severe
to handsome boys.

147
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,480
That’s it.

148
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,850
You spoiled them yourself.

149
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,930
I just regard it as raising heelers

150
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,690
to kill my time.

151
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,090
The talented are not handsome.

152
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,370
The handsome guys are all losers.

153
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,690
What a fair world.

154
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,530
There will be a batch of new comers.

155
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,250
Maybe there will be someone good.

156
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,450
Let’s wait for the interview.

157
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,610
I will judge them by ability this time.

158
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,890
I won’t be cheated
by appearance again!

159
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,170
Is it Rongpin?

160
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,170
Well, I got a finalist notice.

161
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,120
But I lost my ID card.

162
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,210
Can I have the interview?

163
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,970
I have to reapply for one?

164
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,360
OK, I see.

165
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,290
Thank you.

166
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,250
I need my residence booklet to do that.

167
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,370
But it’s in his hand…

168
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,940
(Public Telephone)

169
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,730
Miss Ji.

170
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,450
Have some tea.

171
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,490
Miss Ji.

172
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,040
I have a question

173
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,490
that I want to ask you.

174
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,730
Don’t say that.

175
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,280
You have already been in the house.

176
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,560
What else do you not know?

177
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,280
No, no, no!

178
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,130
That’s not so sure.

179
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,250
After all the lovers start with privacy.

180
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,120
I can only say

181
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,290
these words to you.

182
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,760
Shut up!

183
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,160
Then, just exchange the information.

184
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,490
There must be something you
don’t know about your cousin.

185
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,730
All right then.

186
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,010
But, I will only answer one question.

187
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,720
I want to know

188
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,850
what’s inside the
unlocked room downstairs.

189
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,960
Seems like he doesn’t
take you seriously.

190
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,770
Then I can rest assured.

191
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,600
It’s said that the room

192
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,290
is my cousin’s secret base.

193
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,890
I don’t know about what’s inside.

194
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,600
But I know

195
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,140
that there is a

196
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,660
telephone.

197
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,560
Telephone?

198
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,120
Yeah.

199
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,160
The old landline phone

200
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,450
that everybody used to have.

201
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,090
My cousin took it here
from the old house.

202
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,280
I guess he is waiting for someone.

203
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,210
For whom?

204
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,890
A person who had left years ago.

205
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,730
Everything has changed.

206
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,200
Now the telephone

207
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,130
is the only thing connects them.

208
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,320
Yanxin would always

209
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,930
go to that room and stare at nothing.

210
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,330
I guess...

211
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,170
He must be waiting for it to ring.

212
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,560
I see.

213
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,090
It’s like what he would do.

214
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,530
Don’t speak like you know him well.

215
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,680
I have known him for years.

216
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,090
I can’t even say I know him well.

217
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,450
Yes.

218
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,160
The more familiar you are with him,

219
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,930
the more confusing you will feel.

220
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,040
You don’t know

221
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,650
how many sides he has.

222
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,530
You think so?

223
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,840
You know what?

224
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,000
I almost became a stalking fan once!

225
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,290
It’s all because of him!

226
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,010
I took many HD photos of him.

227
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,250
None of them looks bad!

228
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,730
He manages his facial expression
more professionally than idols!

229
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,770
Does he have to be that serious?

230
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,810
I understand you.

231
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,560
He is always so indifferent.

232
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,450
Isn’t he tired?

233
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,410
He might be.

234
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,810
Weird.

235
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,330
Why should I tell you this?

236
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,250
Suddenly I feel I got a fellow.

237
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,730
The phone is ringing.

238
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,450
Not mine.

239
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,010
It can’t be…

240
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,770
It’s really from the room!

241
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:29,930
Go inside now!

242
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,320
No! No! I can’t!

243
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,890
Didn’t you say you went there once?

244
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,040
I went inside by accident!

245
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,840
Then he ignored me for half a year!

246
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,410
I don’t want to experience it again.

247
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,690
Look at you.

248
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,200
What if it’s really from

249
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,120
that guy?

250
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,250
It will be late if we don’t answer now.

251
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,610
I will go.

252
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:00,530
Hello?

253
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:02,830
Hello?

254
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,660
Anyone there? Hello?

255
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:24,720
No matter who you are,

256
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,520
you have to pick up the phone now!

257
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,640
Or I can’t explain this

258
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,850
to Ji Yanxin!

259
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,450
What do you want to explain?

260
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,850
Mr. Ji.

261
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,200
I’m sorry.

262
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,760
I didn’t come in on purpose.

263
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,320
I just heard the phone ringing.

264
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,960
Ji Qiu said it’s someone important.

265
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,480
So I picked it up…

266
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,250
Enough!

267
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,610
Go back.

268
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,280
Don’t look at me.

269
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,890
I wanted to inform you.

270
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,480
But it’s too late.

271
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,330
I didn’t know he would come back now.

272
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,370
He doesn’t even give me a chance
to apologize.

(Yangcheng Lake)

277
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,170
You caused trouble again?

278
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:21,340
Why are you always like a prophet?

279
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,050
You made your cousin mad again?

280
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,330
It wasn’t me.

281
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,370
It was Qi Nian.

282
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,050
She went into that room because of me.

283
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,930
She is interesting.

284
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,730
What was your cousin’s reaction?

285
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,810
I don’t know.

286
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,450
That’s why it’s so scary.

287
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,530
Mr. Ji.

288
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,970
I’m sorry

289
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,170
to disturb your music time.

290
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,490
Please forgive me for apologizing
in this way.

291
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,050
You may not believe this,

292
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,970
but I really didn’t mean it this time.

293
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,650
But no matter how I explain it,

294
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,930
it’s true that I broke the rule.

295
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,850
Maybe I was too proud to think

296
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,610
that I was closer to you,

297
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,200
wanted to know more about you

298
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,290
and do something for you.

299
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,170
I was being so arrogant.

300
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,530
I’m sorry.

301
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,090
He still doesn’t forgive me.

302
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,650
When are there lights?

303
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,490

What?

305
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,170
You forgot the keys?

306
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,120
Go ahead. What trouble

307
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,530
did your friend meet?

308
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,440
Nothing.

309
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,530
She was just blocked
by the one she loves.

310
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:54,930
Why?

311
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,600
She broke the rule

312
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,050
and poked the boy’s sore.

313
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,090
You were right.

314
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,330
Some secrets can’t be touched,

315

even if there are so many reasons.

316
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,130
This time,

317
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,290
she deserves it.

318
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,280
Do you know there is another version

319
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,850
of the story Blue Beard?

320
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,360
He knew that she would give up
to the curiosity,

321
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,850
but still gave her the key.

322
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,370
Instead of testing her trust,

323
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,680
actually he wanted his bride

324
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,730
to go into the room at the beginning.

325
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,680
He hoped that

326
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,330
even if she knew the truth,

327
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,450
she could still accept the real him.

328
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,720
Obviously,

329
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,210
none of his wives ever did.

330
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,010
Could it be that Ji Yanxin gave me
the chance on purpose

331
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,300
to get to know the real him?

332
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,370
Hello, my take-out.

Here you are.

334
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,120
What did you order?

335
00:17:59,120 --> 00:17:59,800
Hot pot?

336
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,530
Can’t I?

337
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,280
Come on. Go back to eat.

338
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,490
Let me help you.

339
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,370
Let’s start!

340
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,440
What’s wrong with you today?

341
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,360
This is spicy!

342
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,040
And the most spicy one!

343
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,050
Can you eat it?

344
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,120
I can get used to it gradually.

345
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,610
I have to make the first step anyway.

346
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,170
Strong taste is not done in a day.

347
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,680
If you despise the pepper today,

348
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,810
you will be in great pain
tomorrow in toilet.

349
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,120
I don’t care.

350
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,320
I’d try it no matter what.

351
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,690
Why so hard for yourself?

352
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,440
You had light soup with me last time.

353
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,410
This time it’s your lead.

354
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,960
Didn’t you say that?

355
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,080
There is nothing
that can’t be dealt with

356
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:38,970
after having hot pot.

357
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,730
Here, take it.

358
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,000
You’re handsome,

359
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,240
but a fool.

360
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,640
Shut up and eat!

361
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,800
Alright. Here we go!

362
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,730
Eat.

363
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,850
Let’s me enjoy.

364
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,980
(KEY is princess of soup,
no spicy food please)

365
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:57,780
(But I want it!)

366
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,200
Boy, give up.

367
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,600
You still have a long way

368
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,810
to have spicy food.

369
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,200
Cut the crap.

370
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,400
There is no “give up”

371
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,440
in my dictionary.

372
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,490
Alright. Go on!

373
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,120
Too hot!

374
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,290
That’s antihuman!

375
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,250
I admit. I give up!

376
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,930
Thank you, Siqi.

377
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:37,880
Thanks to you,

378
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,090
now I feel better.

379
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,370
There is nothing to be angry with.

380
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,040
What is the guy

381
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,160
called in reality?

382
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:51,930
I can help you.

383
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,080
It’s not his fault.

384
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,410
It’s all my fault actually.

385
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,850
I used to think only my brother
is that hateful.

386
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,250
The Creator really likes to joke.

387
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,490
Is your brother really that hateful?

388
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,880
Of course!

389
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,880
I ran away from home

390
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,530
because of him mainly!

391
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,360
Now I have to see him again

392
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,560
just to reapply an ID card.

393
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,640
So annoying.

394
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:14,450
Did he agree to see you?

395
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,930
How could he?

396
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,600
I have called him the whole afternoon.

397
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,650
But he just didn’t answer it.

398
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,320
I thought

399
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,770
he could have changed among the years.

400
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,530
Turns out I thought too much.

401
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,720
That pepper is really strong!

402
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,680
Alright, here.

403
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,840
Have some coke.

404
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,690
Take it easy.

405
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,400
It’s OK.

406
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,120
From today on,

407
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,400
let’s stop being flatterer

408
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,760
and learn to be independent.

409
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,240
Never let others decide

410
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,880
your joy or sorrow.

411
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,600
So, boy,

412
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,370
make your indifferent brother regret!

413
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,490
Yanxin,

414
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,890
please let Qi Nian stay.

415
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,050
Don’t you dislike her before?

416
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,650
She is just an assistant.

417
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,080
I just feel

418
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,280
that she was so unlucky.

419
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,330
Have you finished your paper?

420
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,890
Now you have time to care about others?

421
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,170
Get out.

422
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,800
How do you feel?

423
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,690
Are you all right?

424
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,090
I’m fine.

425
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:47,970
Just diarrhea.

426
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,890
I will be fine after having medicine.

427
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,320
How about a day off?

428
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,240
You are already like this.

429
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,760
I’m in no hurry today.

430
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,000
I can help you with your script.

431
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,090
No way.

432
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,240
I’m a man!

433
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,130
What can a diarrhea do to me?

434
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,730
Help me out.

435
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:03,930
I can continue to work.

436
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:05,910
Yes.

437
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,240
I asked you to listen to me.

438
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,650
Why are you so stubborn?

439
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,400
A hot pot can take me down?

440
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,720
How could it be?

441
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,760
I won’t accept it!

442
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,200
You have to admit it.

443
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,280
You’re more delicate than you think.

444
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,240
Your family has raised you so well.

445
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,040
You’re not allowed to have hot pot

446
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,010
from now on.

447
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,720
It’s all my brother’s blame.

448
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,930
He didn’t allow me to do anything

449
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,690
and made me a loser now.

450
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,160
Looks like your brother treats you well.

451
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,730
Why do you dislike him?

452
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,480
Treat me well?

453
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,330
He is just a control freak!

454
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,730
No one will like him.

455
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,170
He can only create a lover himself.

456
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,170
Wait a moment.

457
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,840
Qi Nian.

458
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,650
Close the door…

459
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,740
(“Love Story of Seven”)

460
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,940
(“Prince Charming Chases Love”)

461
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,500
(“Comic Master’s Love Tea Set”)

462
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,250
I know I’m bad at entitling.

463
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,850
How about you do it?

464
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,200
The names of me and my brother

465
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,370
all come from
The Analects of Confucius.

466
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,170
How about

467
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,050
you find some inspiration from it?

468
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,010
“Xiangjun, you hesitate to go.”

469
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,010
“For whom you stay
on the bar in the water?”

470
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,690
“Make up my face for you…”

471
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,770
“Dress for the Beauty”.

472
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,360
Is that from

473
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,730
Nine Songs: Xiangjun?

474
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,890
How do you know?

475
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,210
My brother forced me to recite it.

476
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,530
You’re interested in this?

477
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,320
That’s it.

478
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,980
(Make up my face for you)
Is that alright?

479
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,520
You’re the author.

480
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,610
Of course your preference comes first.

481
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,050
But I’m not an interesting author.

482
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,490
Let me tell you.

483
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,840
Not every pattern

484
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,240
comes from reality.

485
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,810
Virtual creation is also important.

486
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,800
Wait. Please say again.

487
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,480
Say it again.

488
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,250
One more time.

489
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,610
Look.

490
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,850
Not every pattern comes from reality.

491
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,490
Virtual creation is also important.

492
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,330
And,

493
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,360
love stories have patterns.

494
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,240
You have to read more other works

495
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,250
and find the method.

496
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,490
Then you can draw inferences.

497
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,610
What?

498
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,130
So?

499
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,520
Looks like you need to practice.

500
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,250
Come with me.

501
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,800
No matter how many times I come,

502
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,080
your room

503
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,120
is really weird

504
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,960
in a way.

505
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,080
Cut the crap.

506
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,480
If not for my health,

507
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,690
I won’t let you in.

508
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,410
Cherish your chance to learn.

509
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,080
Let’s do it.

510
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,250
Which one do you want to
hook up with first?

511
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,450
How do you do this?

512
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,320
I have my own way to play games.

513
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,520
If you think it’s too slow,

514
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,810
we can hook up with
some of them together.

515
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,400
Is it OK to cheat on them?

516
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,120
You can’t do this in reality.

517
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,090
But in game, do whatever you want.

518
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:18,690
You must not know which one to choose.

519
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,330
Then… This one.

520
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:22,700
(Enter the name.)

521
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,600
(Mr. J: Your name)

522
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,200
(Mr. J: Your name)
He is so domineering.

523
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,200
Cold-blooded.

524
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,250
Isn’t him like our hero?

525
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,320
(I’m Xiaoqi)
Xiaoqi…

526
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,800
(I’m Xiaoqi)
They are?

527
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,240
Hero and heroine in your comic.

528
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:35,960
How is it?

529
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,050
I just made up their names.

530
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,760
That’s great of you!

531
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,840
You got good sense.

532
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,480
Is it

533
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,840
that as long as I can

534
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,650
(Mr. J: Come with me.)
take the hero down,

535
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:44,280
(Have a check on this document.)
then I can make up all

536
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,320
the interactions with the hero?

537
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,520
This is why you let me play this game,

538
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,480
right?

539
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,520
It was at first.

540
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,200
But I checked the walkthrough.

541
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,520
This role is of S level.

542
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,760
No one has collected all
the hidden scenes so far.

543
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,040
It’s said to be really difficult.

544
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,890
Do you really want to challenge?

545
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,040
Of course!

546
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,360
I managed to meet

547
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,000
such a character who is so much
like the real one.

548
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,890
Come on, let me try.

549
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,450
Who is the real one?

550
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,730
Nothing.

551
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,840
It doesn’t matter if I get mad.

552
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,770
This time I must get him.

553
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:20,850
♪I collect everything about you♪

554
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:24,430
♪Play scenes of you again and again♪

555
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:29,170
♪Pass by you carefully♪

556
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:33,120
♪Hope you’ll look back at me♪

557
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:37,490
♪Even if I mistake your eyes♪

558
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:41,250
♪I’d indulge myself in the excitement♪

559
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:45,620
♪Try to leave a deeper impression♪

560
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:49,760
♪Calling my name is enough♪

561
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:54,990
♪In this world only I understand you♪

562
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:58,030
♪I care the most about you♪

563
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:59,420
♪In this world♪

564
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,330
Finally I got one heart.

565
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,490
It took me so long.

566
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,330
I could even clear
all the other characters.

567
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,480
Why does

568
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,760
this designer make

569
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,250
such a hateful hero?

570
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:24,260
(Mr. J: Why did you approach me?
What’s your goal?)

571
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,260
(Mr. J: I’m not interested in love.)

572
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,170
Let alone the character,

573
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,560
just this state of speaking,

574
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,170
he and Ji Yanxin are totally the same.

575
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,120
Where does this designer peep

576
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,170
into his daily life?

577
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,660
(Mr. J: I’m not interested in love.)

578
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,460
(Task from Mr. J.)

579
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,620
(Task from Mr. J.)

580
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,380
(1. Don’t leave me when I’m working.)

581
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:56,060
(2. Answer me as soon as I call you.)

582
00:28:56,180 --> 00:29:00,020
(3. Stay where you are and wait for me
while I’m away…)

583
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,880
Are you done?

584
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,360
The relationship is so tiresome.

585
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,250
That will be scary if it’s reality.

586
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,210
(The last one. If I ask you to leave,)

587
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,840
(don’t be so obedient.)

588
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,980
(Remember to come back if you leave.)

589
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,890
Did I find the bonus chapter?

590
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:22,300
(Congratulations!
You become friends with Mr. J.)

591
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,690
It’s been three days!

592
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,450
Finally I became his friend!

593
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,290
He is really an S-level role.

594
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,850
He deserves it.

595
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,810
Congratulations. Now you can
add Mr. J on WeChat.

596
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,770
I didn’t have his contact until now.

597
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,800
I still don’t have

598
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,370
Ji Yanxin’s contact now.

599
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,690
I wonder what he is doing now.

600
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,130
Mr. Ji?

601
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,570
He added me on WeChat!

602
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,370
Now you know to reply me?

603
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,480
Do you know how long I have waited?

604
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,890
Are you really an assistant?

605
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,520
How could you be mad?

606
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,320
Don’t you know how many
troubles you caused?

607
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,750
Do you want a silent treatment?

608
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,120
This is my cousin’s specialty.

609
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,250
You can’t win him.

610
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,090
Ji Qiu, why do you pretend to be Mr. Ji?

611
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,960
Yes, it’s me.

612
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,640
Or you think

613
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,370
my cousin would add you first?

614
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,120
You’re dreaming.

615
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:36,810
Bye!

616
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:37,930
Wait! Wait!

617
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,410
I have something to tell you.

618
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,840
Not interested.

619
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,560
You have to pay
if you want a fight with me.

620
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,680
It’s about my cousin.

621
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,570
Still not interested?

622
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,370
What’s wrong with him?

623
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,080
He keeps staying in his room

624
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,130
without coming out.

625
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,090
Don’t you care about him now?

626
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,040
Aren’t you taking care of him?

627
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,530
What’s more, he doesn’t want to see me.

628
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,410
I can’t even take care of Qi Bao now.

629
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,250
Look.

630
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,280
Qi Bao.

631
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,090
Qi Bao.

632
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,850
Why do you lose so much weight?

633
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,530
The doctor said it lost its appetite.

634
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,250
Guess it’s influenced by his master.

635
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,840
Wait, I have said so many things.

636
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,410
Why don’t you have any reaction?

637
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:29,770
I…

638
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:30,680
But…

639
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,200
Why are you hesitating?

640
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,930
Now, come over right away!

641
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,650
Mr. Ji.

642
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,690
Mr. Ji, are you OK?

643
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,130
Why are you here?

644
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,200
I rang the bell many times

645
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,400
but no one answered it.

646
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,690
I’m afraid you’re in trouble.

647
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,440
If you don’t want me to come in,

648
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,570
I will get out now.

649
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,010
I’m fine.

650
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,360
I’m not.

651
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,400
Why pinch my face? It hurts.

652
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,610
Let me help you up first.

653
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,360
You’re having a fever.

654
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,290
Let me take you to the hospital.

655
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,330
Don’t bother.

656
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,400
Just a low grade fever
caused by staying up late.

657
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,610
I just need a rest.

658
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,580
(Menu Prince Charming passed out!
What should I do?)

659
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:17,020
(Stroke his head Give him a hug
Kiss him Splash water to him)

660
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,540
(Splash water to him)

661
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,800
How can I make mistake

662
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,290
in such an easy question?

663
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,170
What are you doing?

664
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,400
You look uncomfortable.

665
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,680
I want to help you to feel cool.

666
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,610
Physical cooling.

667
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,720
Isn’t there any other ways?

668
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,560
Yes.

669
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,840
But the first step to cool down

670
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,360
is to dissipate the heat.

671
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,050
So you have to undress.

672
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,400
Don’t look at me like that.

673
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,640
I’m not interested in

674
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,970
your body at all.

675
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,530
Really?

676
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,170
I took them off.

677
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,330
What’s next?

678
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:16,690
Then wipe the body
with alcohol cotton wool.

679
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:18,850
Who should do this?

680
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,920
I can’t do this. I can’t.

681
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,010
It’s too much for me.

682
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,840
Think of the consequences

683
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,210
before you brag next time.

684
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,250
So, why are you here?

685
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,120
Ji Qiu said you’re not doing well.

686
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,690
So I want to come to see you.

687
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,250
You have seen me.

688
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,640
You can go now.

689
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:54,410
I won’t.

690
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:57,920
I made mistake before.

691
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,440
You can punish me at will.

692
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,210
But I won’t leave today.

693
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,450
Why?

694
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,360
Because you are unique to me.

695
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,240
Different from anyone else.

696
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,330
Even the roles in comics.

697
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,240
I figured out one thing

698
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,690
when I was at home.

699
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,880
Rather than the role in game,

700
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,160
I like the real you more.

701
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,050
Only you.

702
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,680
Others are all losers in my eyes.

703
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,450
I have done.

704
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,490
Honestly,

705
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,090
I don’t understand.

706
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,730
But I got your

707
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,210
general idea.

708
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,610
Not to be repeated.

709
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:54,800
Mr. Ji,

710
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,000
you’re really not angry now?

711
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,120
Do you need me to go to the drugstore

712
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,250
to buy alcohol cotton and antipyretic?

713
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,600
And, are you hungry now?

714
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,250
Shall I go out to buy you some food?

715
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:05,930
Shut up.

716
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,490
Just be quiet.

717
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,730
Luckily, your fever is gone.

718
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:39,720
Hello?

719
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,210
What’s up?

720
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:43,640
Where are you?

721
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,210
Why don’t you reply my message?

722
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,330
I’m in my boss’s studio.

723
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,450
What?

724
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,600
It’s already dark! Why are you…

725
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,240
Work overtime. I have no choice.

726
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,130
My boss is…

727
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,960
I’m safe now anyway.

728
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,930
I will be back after I finish my work.

729
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,840
What’s the matter?

730
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,010
Nothing special.

731
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,520
I got two tickets of a

732
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,000
signing session of a cartoonist.

733
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,130
I wonder if you want to go tomorrow.

734
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,210
OK. But who is that cartoonist?

735
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,650
It’s Lu…

736
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:15,970
She’s busy.

737
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:18,890
