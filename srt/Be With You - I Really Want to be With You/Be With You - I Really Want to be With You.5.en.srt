20

The assistant we said just now.

21
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,490
I think it’s not so possible.

22
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,490
Why?

23
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,250
You know, how many of we cartoonists

24
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,330
can stand loneliness?

25
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,450
If I were him,

26
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,840
I would participate in 101 directly.

27
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,090
That can help me become popular faster.

28
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,970
That makes sense.

29
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,130
No wonder they say there is
no handsome guy in this field.

30
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,010
Or how could we still be single?

31
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,720
How about your Prince Charming?

32
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,930
Why didn’t you mention him?

33
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,850
Sensitive?

34
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,210
I’m sorry.

35
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,800
It’s OK.

36
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,490
It’s just I got refused.

37
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,250
You told him your love?

38
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,490
Seriously?

39
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,600
I don’t just want his body to create.

40
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,210
I think I’m really in love.

41
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,520
After his job is finished,

42
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,240
he won’t come to the school again.

43
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,440
I also resigned.

44
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,280
Now I really have

45
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,970
no connection with him.

46
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,200
It’s true. You will get punished

47
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,810
if you get the feelings.

48
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,800
Are you listening to me carefully?

49
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,930
Yes.

50
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,250
My hands are greasy.

51
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,480
Do you have tissues?

52
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,520
So are my hands.

53
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,810
In my pocket. Get them yourself.

(CEO Ji Yanxin)

55
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,920
I wonder what he is doing now

56
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,130
and where he is.

57
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,530

58
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,650
What?

59
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,530
It’s in your pocket.

60
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,320
He said yes!

61
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,450
He allowed me to woo him!

62
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,520
He just gave you his name card.

63
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,000
Come on. He told me the address,

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,360
so he wants me to go to him.

65
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,440
That means he shows me the next chapter.

66
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,600
That can’t be more obvious!

67
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,910
Why do I think he just needs

68
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,050
an assistant?

69
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,040
Then just watch me

70
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,640
start the next chapter.

71
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,730
This time I will definitely get him.

72
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,730
Well… You got it.

73

But maybe that’s the beginning
of you blocking him.

100
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,730
What do you mean?

101
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,800

is his real side,

103
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,050
then you’re totally wrong.

104
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,320
First of all, he is an architect,

105

to serve a master designer

00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,090
when he is chasing the deadlines?

109
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,570
You will know it soon.

110
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:36,970
Here.

111
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,120

112
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,210

I…

120
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,410
Maybe not like that either.

What took you so long?

122
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:53,800
Wait.

123
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,610
He couldn’t be like that.

124
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,770
Who are you looking for?

125
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,480
I may knock the wrong door.

126
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,490
Sorry.

127
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,000
Who is it?

128
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,130
I don’t know.

129
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,010

Do you want to eat, darling?

130

It’s of no use to escape.

131
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,920
Time to face the truth.

132
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,880
I don’t want to face it.

133
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,520
And I don’t want to know

134
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,520
why there is a man

135
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,160
in this house dressing like this.

136
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,120
I don’t want to know at all.

137
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,880
I don’t.

138
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,640
Don’t push me.

139
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,190
I don’t want to open the door
of a new world.

140
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,400
Actually, we are…

141
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,650
I know!

142
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,740
Let go! It’s me.

143
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,130
Professor.

144
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,770
You… You and him…

145
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,880
He is Shao Zui, my partner,

146
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,050
and, the garbage man.

147
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,130
Professor, I’m here to deliver this.

148
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,640
This is not the school.

149
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,650
Don’t need to call me that.

150
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,050
Mr. Ji.

151
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,490
Terrible.

152
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,000
Yanxin.

153
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,280
Behave well.

154
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,690
Mr. Ji.

155
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,170
Come in.

156
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,240
I have acted so many times.

157
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,650
Only this time is the best.

158
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,010
Is this called “care causes trouble”?

159
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,440
Ji! What are you doing?

160
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,320
Open the door! Let me in!

161
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,870
I’m wrong! OK?

162
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,130
Come on! Open the door!

163
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,720
So, you just bought too much food

164
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,160
and passed by his house by accident.

165
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,060
That’s why you cooked for him?

166
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,530
What? I don’t look like it?

167
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,810
I got the certificate of cook abroad.

168
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,850
You can see

169
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,730
how he is like when he is busy.

170
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,450
If no one takes care of him,

171
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,810
he will forget to eat at all.

172
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,250
That’s true.

173
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:02,990
What about you?

174
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,640
You don’t just come here to

175
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,010
deliver documents, do you?

176
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,010
I’m here to woo him.

177
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:16,010
In short, jobbery.

178
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,210
Are you the tutress who

179
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,440
likes him?

180
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,490
You know me?

181
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,570
This is really once in a thousand years.

182
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,890
Finally the stiff and conservative Ji

183
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,320
got a…

184
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,560
Girl, here is it.

185
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,720
Let’s become friends on WeChat.

186
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,250
Maybe I can witness history.

187
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:33,760
OK.

188
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,760
Here. Scan my code.

189
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,570
-OK.
-Here.

190
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,450
I’m hungry.

191
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,570
Here.

192
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:52,930
Thank you.

193
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,130
What’s this?
It’s totally a cheating terrible dish!

194
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,640
Nonsense!

195
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,130
Look, he is eating well.

196
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,570
Professor, try this.

197
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,170
Is that amazing?

198
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,760
Let me tell you.

199
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,130
When he is reading.

200
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,010
he won’t refuse no matter

201
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,450
what you feed him.

202
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,370
Of course,

203
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,720
he can’t even hear you

204
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,120
when you talk beside him.

205
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,160
So you made him dog food?

206
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:56,930
You went too far.

207
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,160
Wait! Stop!

208
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,880
Qi Bao. Qi Bao.

209
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,880
No! You can’t eat!

210
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,970
You will get sick!

211
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,120
Let me tell you.

212
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,000
From now on,

213
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,680
you’re fired.

214
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,670
I’ll be in charge of his food.

215
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,410
OK.

216
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,330
Bravo.

217
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,760
Since you said that,

218
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,930
during this time,

219
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,010
all his food, drink, and living
are in your hands.

220
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,320
Don’t decide all by yourself.

221
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,890
Professor, you’re back to normal?

222
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,950
She just came to deliver the documents.

223
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,410
She has nothing to do with my life.

224
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,620
No.

225
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,820
For your safety,

226
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,900
I have to stay with you.

227
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,260
What if one day you eat something

228
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:35,980
that will kill you?

229
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,190
And Qi Bao. Right?

230
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,510
Ji,

231
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,970
I beg you.

232
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,130
Just let me go. OK?

233
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,570
If we keep doing like this,

234
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,250
you can’t imagine what Ji Qiu will do.

235
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,290
Whatever.

236
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,130
OK.

237
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,330
He doesn’t look like hard to serve.

238
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:08,930
Naive.

239
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,210
You will know it later.

240
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,200
It’s just the easiest

241
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,410
job to feed him.

242
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:17,930
Want some coffee?

243
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,410
OK.

244
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,690
Well, what do you mean just now?

245
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,450
Do you really want to woo him?

246
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,890
Am I not acting obviously?

247
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,970
Although I can’t say I know him well,

248
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,120
the time I have got along with him

249
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,170
is longer than you.

250
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,000
I have an invaluable advise

251
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,560
for you as the gift.

252
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:49,490
What?

253
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,840
Before he opens his heart to you,

254
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,690
keep distance,

255
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,370
don’t poke on his sores.

256
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,090
Especially in this house.

257
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,510
But,

258
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,410
when he’s willing to come closer to you,

259
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:06,950
you should take what he says in reverse.

260
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:08,980
Wait,

261
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,830
can you make it clearer?

262
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,950
Think about it yourself.

263
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,560
So should I be close to him

264
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,970
or away from him?

265
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,240
Why is what people around Ji Yanxin

266
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,650
said so confusing?

267
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,850
Who allows you to be here?

268
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,570
Sorry, I’m just familiarizing myself
with the environment.

269
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,970
Looks like I have to make some rules.

270
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,720
(Three-point Rules)
Do not interfere with the owner’s work.

271
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,440
(Three-point Rules)
Do not enter the restricted area.

272
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,210
(Three-point Rules)
Do not stay overnight.

273
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,840
If it’s a case of
staying here overnight,

274
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,690
you have to stay in your room all night.

275
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,730
If you violate any of the above,

276
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,490
you will be fired right away.

277
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,690
Any problem?

278
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,250
The second one…

279
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,240
The restricted areas in this house…

280
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,490
Where are they?

281
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,850
Only one place.

282
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,530
The room you almost entered just now.

283
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,440
You can go anywhere

284
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,250
in my house

285
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,810
except that room.

286
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:18,920
That’s easy.

287
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,090
We can just lock that room up.

288
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,170
It can’t be locked.

289
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,530
Why?

290
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,290
Curious?

291
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,170
I will go there often.

292
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,410
Whatever sound comes from there,

293
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,010
you must not step into it.

294
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,370
This is the basic rule of working here.

295
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,930
Keep that in mind.

296
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,680
See you tomorrow.

297
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,010
Good… Night.

298
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,160
He doesn’t allow entrance
or lock it up.

299
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,160
Can’t he even say anything more?

300
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,760
Can’t he just say goodnight?

301
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,960
If one day I really block you,

302
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,250
you should take the blame yourself.

303
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,520
Is your friend seeking for torture?

304
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,760
She likes a cold-blooded man like this?

305
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,250
Is there no man on earth?

306
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,210
Key.

307
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,770
What’s wrong with you today?

308
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,210
You’re so bad-tempered.

309
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,370
Forget it.

310
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,490
I wanted to ask about being assistant.

311
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,930
Looks like it’s not the right time.

312
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,250
Did anything happen to you recently?

313
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:16,810
No.

314
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,280
Don’t care about me.

315
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,670
You should feel sorry for yourself.

316
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:20,720
You found a man like this as

317
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,800
What’s on your mind?

318
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:22,930
He is handsome.

319
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,160
Alright.

320
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,130
What’s about his characteristic?

321
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,080
Isn’t there anything

322
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,520
more adorable than the widely available

323
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,760
characteristic like that?

324
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,160
Yes. He has two styles in private

325
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,330
when he is designing or not.

326
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,300
When he is designing,

327
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:41,720
it feels like there are walls around him

328
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,350
and he is in another space.

329
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,120
What about when he is not designing?

330
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,090
Will he be normal?

331
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,930
It’s worse when not designing.

332
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,430
He has no inspiration

333
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,840
when he is not designing.

334
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,650
He will become a cleaner

335
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,880
and start to clean

336
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,960
the house like crazy

337
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,560
until he finds his inspiration back.

338
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,880
And then he will keep designing.

339
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,530
It goes round and round.

340
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,500
Then, isn’t there any time

341
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,480
when he doesn’t work?

342
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,880
There is. Except these two modes,

343
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,650
he will go to a room sometimes.

344
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,710
After he comes out from there,

345
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:18,870
his whole surly feeling is gone,

346
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,450
like he is purified.

347
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,450
What is that?

348
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,040
A wonder gate?

349
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,240
He time travels?

350
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,850
Becomes another on after coming back?

351
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,120
Then isn’t your friend curious

352
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,240
about what inside is?

353
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,200
Of course she is.

354
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,090
But…

355
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,400
Whatever sound comes from there,

356
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,930
you must not step into it.

357
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,130
This is the basic rule of working here.

358
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,770
Keep that in mind.

359
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:44,680
But…

360
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,800
But I don’t understand

361
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,000
that since he doesn’t allow,

362
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,280
why doesn’t he lock it up?

363
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,330
He still said that out
and made people curious.

364
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,880
Have you ever heard a story

365
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,010
called “Blue Beard”?

366
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:01,810
What’s that?

367
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,210
A beautiful fairy tale.

368
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,120
Once upon a time
there was a beautiful bride

369
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,080
who married a local king

370
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,930
with a blue beard.

371
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,440
The king was so nice to the bride

372
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,680
and let her be in charge of the castle.

373
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,850
He gave her a set of keys

374
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,000
and told her that

375
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,920
the treasures in all the rooms

376
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,880
belong to her

377
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,600
except the one with the golden key

378
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,530
which should not be opened.

379
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,840
The bride kept her promise at first.

380
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,400
But with the developing curiosity,

381
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,480
she opened that door.

382
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,170
And what’s hidden inside
wasn’t treasure at all,

383
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,570
but…

384
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,490
Bodies!

385
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,810
The bodies of all the king’s wives!

386
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,450
What?

387
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,050
The key got the blood on it.

388
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,720
The king with blue beard found

389
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,970
the bride’s betrayal

390
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,330
and wanted to kill her like other wives.

391
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,680
Luckily the bride’s brothers
arrived in time

392
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,890
and killed the blue-beard king.

393
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,810
That’s the end of the story.

394
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,200
That’s not fairy tale at all.

395
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,610
That’s a horror story.

396
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,610
Don’t you think the king with

397
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,810
blue beard is like someone?

398
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:28,850
Stop thinking about it!

399
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,440
It’s all Key’s blame.

400
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,640
Now my brain is full of

401
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,210
the story of blue beard.

402
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,040
To some people,

403
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,370
secret is the switch of getting evil.

404
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,570
Tell your friend to stay away from him.

405
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,250
Or she won’t know

406
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,650
how she would die.

407
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:00,920
Key,

408
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,240
since the king

409
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,920
doesn’t want the bride

410
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,400
to know what’s inside the room,

411
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,240
why did he give her the golden key?

412
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,810
Why didn’t he just lock the room up?

413
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,000
Maybe he wanted to test

414
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,090
the bride’s loyalty to see

415
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,890
if she could defeat the curiosity.

416
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,050
No. No. No.

417
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,280
I should believe him

418
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,760
and myself.

419
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,360
I can’t be defeated by curiosity.

420
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,090
Right.

421
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,360
Qi Bao! Don’t come over!

422
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,320
We’re still friends if you don’t!

423
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,410
Don’t! No!

424
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,610
Say it.

425
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,770
Who is the principal criminal?

426
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,050
I witnessed the scene of the crime

427
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,290
and became an accomplice
because of force majeure.

428
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,410
Can you let me go?

429
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,130
No.

430
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,280
Then, since I’m the first offender,

431
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,120
can you go easy on me?

432
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,090
Impossible.

433
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,370
Alright. Just do what you like.

434
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,810
But please don’t be so angry.

435
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:32,210
That depends on your answer next.

436
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,170
Qi Bao will always seek approval.

437
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,450
He won’t cause trouble
if someone is there.

438
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,120
So when he jumped into the pool,

439
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,130
where were you?

440
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,730
I…

441
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,970
Did you go to somewhere
you shouldn’t go?

442
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:57,850
That’s good.

443
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,040
I can let go all the other things

444
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,250
as long as you kept your words.

445
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,330
Next, you and Qi Bao,

446
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,770
which should be cleaned first?

447
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,840
I can do this myself.

448
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,610
I understand.

449
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,010
Qi Bao, come here.

450
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:17,850
Raise your hand.

451
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:22,450
This one.

452
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:30,490
Come here.

453
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,920
I promise I won’t do this next time.

454
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,040
And he won’t either.

455
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,170
We won’t cause trouble next time.

456
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,570
Next time?

457
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,330
Qi Bao, let’s go.

458
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,810
Key?

459
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,880
Why are you sitting here?

460
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,090
Being ant?

461
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,010
I lost my keys

462
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,770
together with my phone and wallet.

463
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,010
I have to have some sugar to
get rid of bad luck.

464
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,330
But shouldn’t it be salt?

465
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,280
I just like sweets!

466
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,720
I can’t live without sweets! So what?

467
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,480
I’m miserable enough already.

468
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,360
Can you stop picking a hole?

469
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,600
Alright. Alright.

470
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,320
I got keys.

471
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,240
Come on. Let’s go inside.

472
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:26,970
Are you sure?

473
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,730
What do you mean?

474
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:30,930
Nothing.

475
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,170
There are evil days lately.

476
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:43,850
Alright.

477
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,000
Thank you, sir.

478
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,530
Home is the best place!

479
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,680
Your phone still has power!

480
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,520
Why didn’t you call your boss

481
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,520
to send you the keys?

482
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,000
Childe, you’re really living in dream.

483
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,440
Which boss will deliver keys
to his employee?

484
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:13,000
I’ve been ransacked by reality, OK?

485
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,520
Can’t you say something encouraging

486
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,390
to a handsome boy who can’t even

487
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,690
afford instant noodles now?

488
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,600
There is still food in the refrigerator.

489
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,490
We can have hot pot tonight.

490
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,090
I come back to life.

491
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,320
I want sauced beef with soup.

492
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:23,840
Reject.

493
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,080
Hot pot must be spicy.

494
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,370
Pure soup can only be used to
disinfect the chopsticks.

495
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,220
(KEY is princess of soup,
no spicy food please)

496
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,560
Didn’t you say two-flavor hot pot
is your baseline?

497
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,370
You can’t have spicy food.

498
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,240
Don’t look at me like that.

499
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,960
You worked through the night.

500
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,690
I can make the compromise like this.

501
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,890
You’re begging me for something?

502
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,650
Key, you’re really so smart!

503
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,090
Save it.

504
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,520
I knew that you spicy food fancier

505
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,610
won’t compromise so easily.

506
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,770
Go ahead. What can I do?

507
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,270
Nothing special.

508
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,320
You’re good at drawing comics

509
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,050
and have been in this field for years.

510
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,090
Why don’t you become
a professional one?

511
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,560
It’s easier to be said than done.

512
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,850
People like me

513
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,410
who have no talents

514
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,970
can’t carry that ambition.

515
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,000
How could you not have talents?

516
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,370
Who brainwashed you?

517
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,080
Don’t flatter me.

518
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,130
I know it myself.

519
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,240
I just have skills

520
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,570
and experience.

521
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,570
I just have the skills from the years

522
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,210
I spent longer than others on comics.

523
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,490
If I have talents,

524
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,850
I would have already
submitted successfully.

525
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,560
When I ran away from my home,

526
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,650
my brother said I couldn’t succeed.

527
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,330
In the past years,

528
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,450
I have been still against him,

529
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,570
but gradually I figure out the truth.

530
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,850
I’m, after all, just a half-wit.

531
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,490
So, it’s good for me
to just draw fan comics.

532
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,050
I’m full.

533
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:06,650
What?

534
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,280
Follow me.

535
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,000
Let me help you to see yourself.

536
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:10,770
Come on.

537
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,040
They are the scripts reviewed.

538
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,730
Do you know which one got
the highest praise?

539
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,480
This one.

540
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,320
It shows the strong basic skills.

541
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,480
And the movement line is smooth.

542
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,570
Nothing is wrong with it.

543
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,490
No. It’s this one.

544
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,330
Are you kidding me?

545
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,760
This was all drawn

546
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,320
when I was in a hurry.

547
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,160
Some places were not even shaded.

548
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,320
Are your editors blinded?

549
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,600
Why can’t you see the good

550
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,640
in you every time?

551
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,480
Among the three scripts,

552
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,000
you drew the best one smoothly.

553
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,360
Even if the painting style
is not very stable,

554
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,720
it looks freely and smooth.

555
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,880
People would like to finish it.

556
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,690
This is where you shine.

557
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,720
Really?

558
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,810
But I think it sucks.

559
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,370
Give me some place.

560
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,240
How did you do the story board

561
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,450
every time you drew?

562
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,290
Story board?

563
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,160
I just drew the thing

564
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:18,960
showed up in my mind.

565
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,810
Follow my feeling.

566
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,120
Do you know how painful I felt

567
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,360
every time I do that?

568
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,840
But you just got that already in mind!

569
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,290
Isn’t that talent?

570
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,890
If you want to know
if you are right for it,

571
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,120
you can’t figure out just by thinking.

572
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,440
Do you want to

573
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,440
participate in
the Fresh Work Competition

574
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,210
together with me?

575
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,440
I… I’ll consider that.

576
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,070
Because I just signed up

577
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:47,650
for the new candidates for Rongpin.

578
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,120
I need more time.

579
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:49,970
How long do you need?

580
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:51,970
Three days.

581
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,080
Too long!

582
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,640
You just need to nod!

583
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,440
When I decided to become a cartoonist,

584
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,370
it just took the time
of eating a popsicle.

585
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,760
You think everyone is careless like you?

586
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:02,520
What I need to do is the last stand.

587
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,720
I will cut all the back ways

588
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,520
and quit all the part-time jobs

589
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,570
to follow you wholeheartedly.

590
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:07,900
OK.

591
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,490
But dream is a heavy thing.

592
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,930
Can you really carry it?

593
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,130
Key.

594
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,000
No.

595
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,600
You are my partner from now on.

596
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,240
So I need to know your real name.

597
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,010
What’s your name again?

598
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,800
Now I follow my mother’s family name.

599
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,240
You can call me Pei Siqi

600
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,250
or Siqi.

601
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,010
Qi.

602
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,360
How could you call me that right away?

603
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,760
Don’t care about the details.

604
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,160
I’m not good at saying something

605
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,120
warm.

606
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,200
Anyway.

607
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,320
Your dream

608
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,800
will be my dream from now on.

609
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,960
No matter what I should do,

610
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,370
I will help you to fulfill it!

611
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,450
Why do I feel like being proposed to?

612
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,000
She hasn’t read any girly comics.

613
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,730
Why does she speak like the hero now?

614
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,520
Did I just say something

615
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,520
really manly?

616
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,280
I think I’m getting more and more

617
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,410
like an author of girly comics now.

618
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,850
Ouch! It hurts!

619
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,680
Stop being too proud.

620
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,840
When it comes to girly power,

621
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,730
you still have a long way to go.

622
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,440
How is your prototype of character now?

623
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,360
Is his personality still weird?

624
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,240
No, no.

625
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,200
My friends said

626
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,970
her boss is not that bad.

627
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:11,370
It’s real!

628
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:12,360
He also has a gentleman side.

629
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,120
So I think she should be active

630
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,290
on improving their relations.

631
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:16,970
Qi.

632
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,280
I see. I see.

633
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,640
Just some sweet pattern, right?

634
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,400
I will give you.

635
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:22,280
And, next when you play the coquette,

636
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,410
stay away from me.

637
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,290
Mr. Ji, you’re awake?

638
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,330
Come for breakfast when you’re ready.

639
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,530
How did you get in?

640
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,690
The door is not locked.

641
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,130
Nice design.

642
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,410
I’m glad you like it.

643
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,610
Mr. Ji.

644
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,520
You don’t like sweet food?

645
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,290
No.

646
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,240
But sugar is a good thing.

647
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,520
Or why do people use “sweet”

648
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,040
to describe good life?

649
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:30,890
Don’t be sure.

650
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,160
“Sweet” in Japanese

651
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,520
means naïve.

652
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,360
So it can be said

653
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,170
to be stupid.

654
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,370
So?

655
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,690
You look sweet.

656
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,290
Sir, how did you get hurt?

657
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,840
When I made the model.

658
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,850
Just a small wound.

659
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,600
The temperature difference
is large lately.

660
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,650
Watch out for colds.

661
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,730
I don’t know how.

662
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,400
People will all get it!

663
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,320
You always work over night.

664
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,280
You will get sick.

665
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,610
I can’t take care of you here at night.

666
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,640
How will you take care of me

667
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,690
if you stay for nights?

668
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,080
As a girl,

669
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,770
you should consider more for yourself.

670
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:44,960
If I would get sick like this,

671
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,390
I would have died ten years ago
for overwork.

672
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,010
I will finish this soon.

673
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,810
Water the lawn after that.

674
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,800
Now I know why Li Yue

675
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,170
said it hard to serve him.

676
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,880
I have already done this.

677
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,250
What else can I do to please him?

678
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,090

Mr. Ji.

Don’t call me.

701
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,140
Sorry.

702
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,350
I just think the view of your back

703

is full of sense of security.

You must like dogs, right?

710
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,130
Not really.

711
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,810
But you’re nice to Qi Bao.

712

It’s kind of a habit.

716
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:17,930

I do.

722
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,450
The affection that can become habit

723
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,790
already exceeded the affection itself.
