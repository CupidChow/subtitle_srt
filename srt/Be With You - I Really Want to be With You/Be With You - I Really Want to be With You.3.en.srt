20
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,540
Professor,

21
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,680
have you already remembered my name

22
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,000
but refused to admit it?

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,480
You don’t like me?

24
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,680
Or even if

25
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,840
I made it,

26
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,120
you still wouldn’t acknowledge it?

27
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,800
The result doesn’t matter.

28
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,360
I care more...

29
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:58,980
About your motive.

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,520
Say it.

31
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,720
What are you up to?

32
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,120
What kind of reason would you like,
simple or complicated?

33
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:15,960
Whatever.

34
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,440
For the complicated reason,

35
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,000
I fell in love with you at first sight.

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,440
I want to stay around you

37
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,480
and observe you at close quarters.

38
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,240
What about the simple one?

39
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,320
For the simple reason,

40
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,880
because of some reasons,

41
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,680
I need you now.

42
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,400
Do you always confess your love

43
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,240
as casually as this?

44
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,800
You’d better tell the truth.

45
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,280
This is the truth!

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,960
Fine. You’re going to be fired.

47
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,000
It doesn’t matter if this is the truth.

48
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,120
Why?

49
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,520
Didn’t you say I could stay around

50
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,040
after I passed the test?

51
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,360
Pretend I’m regretting.

52
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,000
I never make a deal

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,320
with anyone with evil intents.

54
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,720
What evil intents do I have?

55
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,560
I first met you in the park.

56
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,080
Then you came to my class,

57
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,040
became my TA

58
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,280
and brainwashed our staff.

59
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,360
Then you got me splashed.

60
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,120
Now you say you want to observe me.

61
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,680
Aren’t they evil intents?

62
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,000
You forced me to brainwash them.

63
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,120
I didn’t mean to splash you.

64
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,640
In the park,

65
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,920
Golden Retriever took the initiative.

66
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,720
I didn’t.

67
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,000
How do I know it would...

68
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,640
What are you doing?

69
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:23,840
Grandpa.

70
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:25,840
Grandpa?

71
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,440
Hi, Grandpa.

72
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,400
Grandpa, have some water.

73
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,720
She calls me Grandpa?

74
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,920
Didn’t I tell you not
to come to school for me?

75
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,400
You’re having a relationship
with your student.

76
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,480
How can I not come?

77
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,520
Grandpa, I’m not his student.

78
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,440
Shut up.

79
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,120
You shut up!

80
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,600
Girl.

81
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,000
I understand.

82
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,120
But a student like you
should focus on study,

83
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,400
instead of being held up
by a working guy.

84
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:05,920
Understand?

85
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,600
Grandpa.

86
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,160
Wait for me.

87
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:08,960
Let me show you something.

88
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,480
This is my ID card.

89
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,600
I’m a serious working guy.

90
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,520
Grandpa, please have a look.

91
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,320
(Qi Nian)
(May 6th, 1996)

92
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,560
You’re 24 years old?

93
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,520
You must have been graduated.

94
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,200
Oh, you’re a Taurus.

95
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,040
You and my grandson
can be a good couple.

96
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,240
He is...

97
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:33,960
Capricorn.

98
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,400
Yes. Yes.

99
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,560
Capricorn. Capricorn.

100
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,120
Come on.

101
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,400
Let me check your constellation

102
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,480
and if you make a perfect match.

103
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,040
Grandpa.

104
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,400
What exactly do you come for?

105
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,680
I’ve got a blind date for you.

106
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,080
I’m not going.

107
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,440
If you have a girlfriend,

108
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,440
I allow you not to go.

109
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,800
Fine, pretend I have a girlfriend.

110
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,080
Who?

111
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,320
Her?

112
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,040
She’s your girlfriend?

113
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,040
What’s her name, then?

114
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,280
Yeah.

115
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,200
What’s my name, honey?

116
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,160
You must know your girlfriend’s name,

117
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,150
don’t you?

118
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,560
Tell me!

119
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:23,840
Qi Nian.

120
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,800
Qi for relation.

121
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,360
And Nian for year.

122
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,520
Gosh!

123
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,560
You finally call my name!

124
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,160
Grandpa.

125
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,160
As you see,

126
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,200
she doesn’t look reliable.

127
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,840
But she’s indeed my girlfriend.

128
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,920
Grandpa, don’t worry.

129
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,240
Whatever happens,

130
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,680
I won’t give him to anyone else.

131
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,520
I’ll always take responsibility for him.

132
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,120
Always?

133
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,840
How enterprising you sound!

134
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,440
Good. Good.

135
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,640
Forget about the blind date.

136
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,800
As long as you’re in a relationship,

137
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,840
I won’t disturb you.

138
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,680
When you break up,

139
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,640
I’ll come to trouble you again.

140
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:10,840
-Come on!
-Come on!

141
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,160
As Li Yue’s girlfriend,

142
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,770
what do you usually do with him?

143
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,880
Ordinary things.

144
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,090
(Love Guidance)
Meals, shopping, films, and rides.

145
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,000
Wait.

146
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,280
Neither of you has the driving license.

147
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,700
How can you take a ride?

148
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,520
On a bus.

149
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,600
(Sweet Love Confession on Bus No. 520)

150
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,960
(Sweet Love Confession on Bus No. 520)
I hear you’ll manage to confess love

151
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,760
if you take Bus No. 520

152
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,560
at twenty past five in the afternoon.

153
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,320
You’ve been in a relationship for long,

154
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,240
but you want to confess your love now?

155
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,720
Why do you ask so many questions?

156
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,080
Anyway, what we do

157
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,240
doesn’t suit beginners like you.

158
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,760
In love,

159
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,440
there are no beginners or veterans.

160
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,600
(Cherish the feeling
when you can’t help smiling.)

161
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,080
(You’re also a top scorer of math?)
It depends on what type your boyfriend is.

162
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,660
(You’re good.)

163
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,120
Type?

164
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,840
For example,

165
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,400
cat boyfriends and dog boyfriends.

166
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,680
Specifically, proud, scheming,

167
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,280
domineering or gentle boyfriends.

168
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,320
(What’s your name?)

169
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,200
For different types,

170
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:18,900
(What’s your name?)
there’re different ways

171
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:19,660
(What’s your name?)
there’re different ways

172
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,900
and tools.

173
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,560
Wait.

174
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,280
You had all these types of boyfriends?

175
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,560
Of course.

176
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,040
They’re all on my computer.

177
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,400
Say something realistic, could you?

178
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,480
Speaking of being realistic,

179
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,040
I have the most experience.

180
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,320
Well, men usually have some requests

181
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,880
for their girlfriends.

182
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,160
First, feed him.

183
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,960
Second, don’t check his WeChat.

184
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,680
Third, don’t disturb
when he plays computers.

185
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,680
Most important of all...

186
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,280
What is it?

187
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,540
Do...

188
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,340
(4. Do...)

189
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,600
Mr. Ji.

190
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,360
Li Yue!

191
00:07:59,200 --> 00:07:59,960
Do what?

192
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,160
Do the design of the garage again.

193
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,080
Okay.

194
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,680
Why did he stop halfway?

195
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,000
I’m not sure, then.

196
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,960
Forget it. I’ll practice it.

197
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,500
(MC)

198
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,560
What’s this?

199
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,360
A diary of a stalker

200
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,600
or a collection of masochism?

201
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,920
Is that so exaggerated?

202
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,680
Look!

203
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,520
In your comics, I can only see

204
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,240
the back of Ji Yanxin’s head
or his side face.

205
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,360
Every day,

206
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,360
he only glances at you.

207
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,560
Don’t you feel upset?

208
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,920
Without sweetness,

209
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,520
how can readers feel involved?

210
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,160
Not to mention critical judges
of the Fresh Work Competition.

211
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,880
It’s so cold around Ji Yanxin.

212
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,880
It’s already my luck
when I’m not frozen.

213
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,960
How can I give sweetness?

214
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,920
We ask for sweetness by ourselves!

215
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,880
You’re his girlfriend, aren’t you?

216
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,440
When you play the role of the heroine,

217
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,960
make good use of it.

218
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,280
What’s the mission of a heroine?

219
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,240
Be in love with the leading man.

220
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,760
Except that,

221
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,120
is there no other mission?

222
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,880
So, you’re treating Ji Yanxin
as a boss in the game?

223
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,640
You win.

224
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,120
I don’t care.

225
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,200
You...

226
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,240
You must learn from the basics.

227
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,640
(Girls’ Dream Garden)

228
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,640
(Invitation)
There’s a fans’ meeting tomorrow afternoon.

229
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,200
(Invitation)
Go join them.

230
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,480
I always go to such meetings.

231
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,600
But you only go to meetings

232
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,280
about ratiocination, science fiction
or military forums.

233
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,200
You can never learn girls’ romance.

234
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,960
I’ll arrange some hotshots
for your interview.

235
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,840
Go and learn

236
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,600
what a leading lady should do.

237
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,760
Why do I like girl manga?

238
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,840
Because I’m still a girl.

239
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,400
You are?

240
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,480
(Xiaochong, in her thirties)
No matter how old a woman is,

241
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,680
(A huge fan of girl manga)
with the girls’ romance,

242
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,800
(Hotshot of fan circle)
she’s always in her puberty.

243
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,960
Well put!

244
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,480
(An, Painter)
You really are a hotshot of girl manga.

245
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,920
(Mainstay of College Girl Manga Club)
You get to the point directly.

246
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,340
(Lily, Experienced Lolita fan)
She has read girl manga for twenty years.

247
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,020
(Professional Coser)

248
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,120
Twenty years?

249
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,600
That means...

250
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,600
I’ve spent two thirds of my life

251
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,120
on girl manga.

252
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,680
I’ll give birth to a baby fan.

253
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,040
Come on. Do you have enough material
for prenatal education?

254
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,040
These are comics of beautiful style.

255
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Start the prenatal education

256
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,400
so that we can expand our comic club.

257
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,160
Which do you prefer,
sexy characters or cute ones?

258
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:44,560
Well,

259
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,400
I want to ask.

260
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,360
Love is the only theme
of girl comics, isn’t it?

261
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,840
Why can it attract you

262
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,560
so greatly?

263
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,600
Well...

264
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,360
We need dreams in our lives.

265
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,360
Even if we don’t have perfect love
in real life,

266
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,920
such love exists

267
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,440
in another space.

268
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,320
Isn’t that great?

269
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
But...

270
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Don’t let Key hear you.

271
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,760
Yes. Yes.

272
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,920
Or he’ll explode.

273
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,880
He takes girl manga

274
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,000
as his life guide?

275
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,720
Key?

276
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,800
He’s the fan painter working with you?

277
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,400
Is he famous?

278
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,120
He’s more than famous.

279
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,720
Speaking of drawing speed and quality,

280
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,240
he’s the one and only in the fan circle.

281
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,040
He’s a genuine guru.

282
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,560
Guru?

283
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:27,840
Guru means

284
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,190
(Hotshot)
hotter than a hotshot.

285
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,400
(Guru)

286
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,320
Speaking of girl manga,

287
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,440
he knows everything.

288
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,160
He just keeps a low profile.

289
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,800
If he showed up in public once,

290
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,680
he would have become more widely known.

291
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,600
He could have used his face.

292
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,800
But he insisted on using his talents.

293
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,960
He just asks for trouble.

294
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,400
Well, is he here today?

295
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,280
He’s just behind you.

296
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,040
Here is your dessert.

297
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,120
When would you like to enjoy it?

298
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,310
Key, that was a perfect dialogue.

299
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,600
Key? The guru?

300
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:20,800
You want me?

301
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,160
How can you just ask that?

302
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,040
She’s your guest.

303
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,880
My Lady, what do you want?

304
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,560
It’s his job.

305
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,120
When we’re consumers here,

306
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,280
he’s our butler.

307
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,200
Just give him your orders.

308
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,010
Seriously?

309
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,480
I’ll do it first.

310
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,920
Butler.

311
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,320
Which do you prefer, mountain or sea?

312
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:41,920
Sea.

313
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,000
Cat or dog?

314
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,680
Dog.

315
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,760
Dad or Mom?

316
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,240
Mom.

317
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,200
Another success in flirting.

318
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,200
You fell into such a trap.

319
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,280
You really deserve your reputation, Key.

320
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,000
I can’t stop laughing.

321
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:57,880
You...

322
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,560
I’ll skip work. I quit.

323
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,520
Let me introduce you.

324
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,200
He’s Key.

325
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,760
Main painter of our fan club.

326
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,520
If you have any confusion
about girl manga,

327
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,320
you can ask him.

328
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,560
Key.

329
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,120
Are you really a man?

330
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,000
Or what?

331
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,840
He’s so lovely.

332
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,160
He’s certainly a man.

333
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,440
Then why do you draw girl manga?

334
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,360
What do you mean?

335
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,040
Can’t men like girl manga?

336
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,880
Are you having sexual discrimination?

337
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,160
No. I don’t mean that.

338
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:28,880
Honestly,

339
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,640
I’m also drawing girl manga.

340
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,120
But I don’t understand

341
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,680
why girl manga

342
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,320
attract readers?

343
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:37,800
Since you don’t understand,

344
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,560
why do you force yourself to like it?

345
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,200
Key, don’t be so straightforward.

346
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,120
Because I must draw comics.

347
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,760
For money?

348
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,800
To make a living, right?

349
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,600
Then you have chosen

350
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,680
a terrible job.

351
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,200
Key, you’re going too far.

352
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:06,920
I’m serious.

353
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,800
There are many ways to make money.

354
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:10,660
Why must she draw girl manga?

355
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,840
Can’t she love it with a true heart?

356
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,620
If she did, she wouldn’t have asked.

357
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,580
There’s no such thing
as a sympathetic chord in comics.

358
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,280
I’m telling you.

359
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,840
Since I was in primary school,

360
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,840
I’ve loved girl manga.

361
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,760
My families objected.

362
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,680
I even ran away from home.

363
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,400
Yet I’ve never given up

364
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,280
being a cartoonist.

365
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,840
But you see.

366
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,360
Even if I tried so hard,

367
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,640
I still couldn’t work as a cartoonist.

368
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,080
But you’re already one,

369
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,040
why can’t you be free

370
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,120
and draw whatever you want?

371
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,680
I...

372
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,360
Have you ever been moved by girl manga?

373
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,480
If no,

374
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,480
you’d better give up.

375
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,560
Because a cartoonist
without girls’ romance

376
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,330
can be a disaster to readers.

377
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,200
Don’t force yourself
if you have no talent.

378
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,240
-Key.
-Key.

379
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,000
You are right.

380
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,680
Sorry to have bothered you.

381
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:09,040
Did I go too far?

382
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,880
Yes, without doubts.

383
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,640
If only the girl were strong enough!

384
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,240
If she quits because of you,

385
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,360
you will feel guilty.

386
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,360
I’m too excited when speaking of comics.

387
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:19,880
Uh...

388
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,780
Do you have

389
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,020
her contact?

390
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,240
This bathroom is even bigger
than a bedroom.

391
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,240
Making it a bathhouse?

392
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,400
Are the stairs

393
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:37,680
going up to the sky?

394
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,280
You think you can attract people

395
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,280
with novelty?

396
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,360
Without talents or efforts,

397
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,200
you still want novelty?

398
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,120
Go and make a new one.

399
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:26,880
What are you staring at?

400
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,160
Come and tidy it up.

401
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,120
Have you ever been moved by girl manga?

402
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,520
If no,

403
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,360
you’d better give up.

404
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,800
Because a cartoonist
without girls’ romance

405
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,240
can be a disaster to readers.

406
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,960
Don’t force yourself
if you have no talent.

407
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,200
Does talent really matter so much?

408
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:50,560
What did you say?

409
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,440
Are efforts without talent

410
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,600
really meaningless?

411
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,280
Are gifts in this world

412
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,560
only for talents?

413
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,080
Just because one is not talented,

414
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,680
he should make more efforts.

415
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,950
But you just said...

416
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,120
Because they skipped basic steps,

417
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,000
trying to have a sudden rise.

418
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,290
There may be real talents.

419
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,480
But only people with efforts

420
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,440
could have the last laugh.

421
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,240
Many people start innovation

422
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,360
from imitation.

423
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,200
If you’re not talented, just learn.

424
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,320
Luckily, there’s the last one.

425
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,680
What a coincidence!

426
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,200
Yes.

427
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,360
Could you give it to me?

428
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,560
It’s the fermented bean curd flavor.

429
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,440
If you want instant noodles,

430
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,400
you’ll have all the others.

431
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,360
I love the fermented bean curd flavor.

432
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,920
No one wants the strange flavor.

433
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,680
Except me,

434
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,600
no one else in the neighborhood comes.

435
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,880
I have just moved here.

436
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,040
I’ve tried

437
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,600
every strange flavor.

438
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,720
I just want this today!

439
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,520
Well, I just want this, too.

440
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,080
Let go!

441
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:23,640
Let go!

442
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,000
Hands off!

443
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,960
You first!

444
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,520
Could you just show some mercy

445
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,480
once in a while

446
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,320
and give me this one?

447
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,120
Did you let me go in that interview?

448
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,160
After you left,

449
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,440
they criticized me.

450
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:48,600
They did?

451
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,040
It’s too late.

452
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,560
But I still want to apologize to you.

453
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,160
Don’t bother.

454
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,160
Your apology isn’t more expensive
than the instant noodles.

455
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:55,920
We’re cleared, then.

456
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:01,920
See you!

457
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,280
No. I’ll never see you again!

458
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,840
Nor will I.

459
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,560
I’m going this way home.

460
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:19,720
Don’t stare at me.

461
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,040
I’m going this way, too.

462
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,640
I’m going this way, then.

463
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,760
Me, too.

464
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,720
Why do you have the key to my home?

465
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,920
Sure, I do. This is my home!

466
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,800
This is my home!

467
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,840
As a gentleman,

468
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,400
why do you have so many dolls?

469
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,560
It’s a man’s sock, isn’t it?

470
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,480
I... I bought some.

471
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,160
They look good.

472
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,080
The seller didn’t allow me
to exchange them.

473
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,160
Then I keep them.

474
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,640
I like dolls, so what?

475
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,800
Can’t men love dolls?

476
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,360
I had thought

477
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,400
my roommate could be

478
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,800
a lovely girl.

479
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,920
I had thought

480
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,720
my roommate could be a capable IT man.

481
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:28,920
I’ll go cook the noodles.

482
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,900
If you find it inconvenient,

483
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,000
I can move out.

484
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,860
But not until

485
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:48,460
I get paid next month.

486
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,880
Because after I paid the rent deposit,

487
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,000
I didn’t have

488
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,680
too much money.

489
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,600
I might not even afford my meals.

490
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,440
I wondered
why you bought instant noodles.

491
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,900
So, we have the same trouble.

492
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,700
After this month,

493
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,940
I’ll have trouble living

494
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,700
next month.

495
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,260
Which do you prefer,
stewed noodles or dry noodles?

496
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:15,820
Stewed noodles.

497
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,060
All the seasoning or half?

498
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:17,980
All, of course.

499
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,120
Why does it sound so familiar?

500
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,500
Butler.

501
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,940
Which do you prefer, mountain or sea?

502
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:29,530
Sea.

503
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,580
Cat or dog?

504
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,300
Dog.

505
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,300
Dad or Mom?

506
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:33,820
Mom.

507
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,420
Oh, I remember.

508
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,940
If you want to get rid of the trap,

509
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,780
you won’t succeed anyhow.

510
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,060
Are you sure?

511
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,340
But I’ve figured out the solution.

512
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,220
How?

513
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:51,900
Ask me again.

514
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,740
Who do you like more, Dad or Mom?

515
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,060
I like you.

516
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,380
See, you can’t answer, can you?

517
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,340
Perfect solution.

518
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,300
So... Sorry.

519
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,260
So... Sorry.

520
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,140
What did I say?

521
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,020
Stop... Stop...

522
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,980
Stop saying anything.

523
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,060
Or we’ll be embarrassed.

524
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:21,460
Let’s go.

525
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,180
Delicious!

526
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,940
Oh,

527
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:40,740
I don’t know your name yet.

528
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,380
I’m Qi Nian.

529
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,020
Qi Nian?

530
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:45,820
Nice to meet you.

531
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,100
Oh,

532
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:51,380
I’ve got a good idea, Key.

533
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,860
You don’t need to move out.

534
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,060
What?

535
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,060
Wait for us to eat up the noodles.

536
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,540
Your... Your good idea...

537
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,260
You want me to comment on your comics?

538
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,060
Yes.

539
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,500
You’re the famous Key.

540
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,300
Among readers of girl manga,

541
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,820
you’re the most experienced.

542
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,780
So, I want you to give me
a little bit of advice

543
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,900
as a reader.

544
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:20,420
Please!

545
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,580
No. Sounds like a trap.

546
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,900
And there’s too much trouble.

547
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,820
I’d rather move out.

548
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,220
Don’t. I’m begging you!

549
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,020
Just this once.

550
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:28,660
Just this once.

551
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,620
Could you?

552
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,380
For the sake
that I shared my noodles with you.

553
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,500
-I beg you. I beg you.
-I won’t. I won’t.

554
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,190
I won’t read it.

555
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:35,110
Please read it.

556
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:35,900
I beg you!

557
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,700
I’ll just read it for once.

558
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:58,060
It doesn’t look like girl manga.

559
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,140
It’s more like observation.

560
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,460
The details are too realistic,

561
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,220
without any fun.

562
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,660
You realized that?

563
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:04,980
There is a real prototype?

564
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:05,780
This is a story about me...

565
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,700
My friend.

566
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:11,860
Seems like you don’t have imagination

567
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,020
about love.

568
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:15,460
All right, then.

569
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:18,940
The leading man you draw

570
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,300
is a cold man.

571
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,380
In girl manga,

572
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,420
men pretend to be cold.

573
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,660
They turn out to be flamboyant.

574
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,220
All heart-tormenting moments

575
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,460
lead to final sweetness.

576
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:31,220
When the man doesn’t
take the initiative,

577
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,660
the girl should chase him
and flirt with him.

578
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:33,820
I’ve said so much.

579
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:34,720
Do you understand?

580
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,260
What exactly should I do?

581
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,980
There are two ways to draw girl manga.

582
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:44,560
First, with experience.

583
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,060
Obviously, you don’t have enough.

584
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,580
So, you must choose the second way.

585
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:48,900
Getting involved.

586
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:50,780
How?

587
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,540
Why did you ask?

588
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,740
Just get involved in the story,

589
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,820
and chase the man with true love.

590
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,660
Get involved in the story?

591
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:03,020
Yes. The story is made up.

592
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,220
But the feelings are true.

593
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,140
Only when you love the leading man
with true heart

594
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,900
can you make up good plots.

595
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,180
Or characters will be frothy,

596
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,900
no matter how good
they’re supposed to be.

597
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,400
No readers will put in their feelings.

598
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,220
Be more specific.

599
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,420
Suppose you’re the leading girl

600
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,340
who fell in love with a cool prince.

601
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,060
To show him your charm,

602
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,740
you started to dress yourself up.

603
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,060
In the most beautiful dresses

604
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,580
and best makeups,

605
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,520
you appeared in front of him frequently.

606
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,460
Because of the unaccustomed shoes,

607
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,220
you accidentally fell.

608
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,220
Finally, the prince noticed you.

609
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,060
If he still ignored you,

610
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,460
you should take another step.

611
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,660
Confess to him warmly

612
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,220
(Recruitment for Comic Club)
and observe how he reacts.

613
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:11,780
I like you.

614
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,060
You said that before.

615
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,540
I want to be your girlfriend.

616
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,660
You already are.

617
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,660
I want your true heart

618
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,360
where I can feel true love.

619
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,220
Sticky eyes.

620
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,050
Stay away from me.

621
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,780
Go get changed.

622
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,340
Why?

623
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,420
A dress is the romance of men, isn’t it?

624
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,260
Also, I can show absolute charm

625
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,900
with such a long dress.

626
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,660
I’ll certainly look lovely.

627
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,700
If you don’t believe me,
let me show you.

628
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:39,660
Stand still.

629
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,380
You don’t like that?

630
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,300
No.

631
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,020
But I like you.

632
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:43,980
More than anything else.

633
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,300
Enough is enough.

634
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,660
Why?

635
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,060
Close your eyes.

636
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,980
Think of your favorite thing.

637
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:52,770
What is it?

638
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:54,660
Fried chicken.

639
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,660
I’m going to the library.

640
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,500
Are you going there with me

641
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,540
or are you going to buy fried chicken?

642
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,340
Seems like you like fried chicken

643
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,140
more than me.

644
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,060
I can swear to God

645
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:06,940
that I love fried chicken.

646
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:07,500
So, I...

647
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,120
Since you don’t like me most,

648
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,420
don’t say it casually.

649
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:16,140
Key’s method doesn’t work.

650
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,260
Am I not doing enough?

651
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,380
I should use a bigger trick.

652
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,860
(CEO Code)

653
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,300
Romantic tricks of girl manga

654
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,580
that Key taught me personally.

655
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,740
Using three or more tricks,

656
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,940
a girl can have all men.

657
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,280
First, get close to him.

658
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:43,250
It means a man pushes a girl
to the corner

659
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:44,540
and reaches out one arm against the wall

660
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,230
with a bang.

661
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,240
The girl then has nowhere to go

662
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,450
and she’ll be shy.

663
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:52,090
The success rate will go up largely.

664
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,040
It hurts. It hurts.

665
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,460
I have a cramp.

666
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,550
It hurts. It hurts.

667
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,520
It hurts!

668
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,130
It hurts so much!

669
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,220
Professor.

670
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,700
I want to get the book up there.

671
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,140
But I can’t reach it.

672
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,420
Could you help me out?

673
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,580
Second, reach for a book from behind.

674
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:24,660
The girl stands on tiptoe,

675
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,220
but fails to reach something up there,

676
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:26,980
however hard she tries.

677
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,620
The man then turns up behind her

678
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,620
and raises his arm.

679
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,100
When their fingers meet,

680
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:35,010
the romance flows.

681
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,900
Third, get carried in arms.

682
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,500
No way!

683
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,300
Ji Yanxin isn’t treating me

684
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,980
as his girlfriend at all.

685
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,380
If he doesn’t reply at all,

686
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,980
this way won’t work.

687
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,820
Give these books to Prof. Shen.

688
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,140
I see, Professor.

689
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:02,240
Wait.

690
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:05,060
What, Prof. Ji?

691
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,130
Open your mouth.

692
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,580
On your way back,

693
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,660
buy some fried chicken in the canteen.

694
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,060
He must be treating me
as Golden Retriever.

695
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,580
You’re Qi Nian?

696
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,180
What do you want me for?

697
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,020
I am

698
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,300
Prof. Ji’s last TA.

699
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,740
I’m the one before her.

700
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,340
I’m the one before her.

701
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,180
We all used to be his assistants.

702
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,460
I see.

703
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,580
Party of assistants

704
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,420
to share the experience
of getting fired, right?

705
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,500
No party!

706
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,540
We come to get even with you!

707
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,180
How long have you been here?

708
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,100
Why can you be his TA?

709
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,260
I was fired after two days.

710
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,340
I was fired after the first day of work.

711
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,580
Yes. Prof. Ji has bad temper.

712
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,100
Be more patient with him.

713
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:11,620
And don’t get angry.

714
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,860
Why would we be angry with him?

715
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,100
We’re angry with you!

716
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:18,220
Me?

717
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:20,990
We’re warning you!

718
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,500
Leave Prof. Ji right away.

719
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:25,820
Or you’ll be sorry.

720
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,400
Be sorry?

721
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:29,860
Come on. Come on.

722
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,300
Did you see that?

723
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,340
A girl is besieged.

724
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,100
Right behind the canteen.

725
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,780
By other jealous girls, right?

726
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,300
The one who leads them

727
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,780
used to be Prof. Ji’s TA.

728
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,300
Let’s fight, then.

729
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,180
What? You...

730
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,420
I didn’t mean

731
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,380
we would fight you.

732
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,100
What do you mean, then?

733
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,300
We won’t fight?

734
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,870
How boring!

735
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,420
Get to the point.

736
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,500
Otherwise,

737
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,060
I must enjoy my fried chicken.

738
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,020
Why can you be so arrogant?

739
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,940
You... You know what?

740
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,740
What’s your advantage?

741
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,460
Did Prof. Ji ask you

742
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,780
to do PPT for over thirty times

743
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,100
and nothing can be repeated?

744
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,540
He smashed the models his students made

745
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,020
and had his TA clean it up.

746
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,620
He only left a simple message

747
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,660
without a name.

748
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,380
He also gave us a lot of homework

749
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,180
and tortured us.

750
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:20,580
Enjoy the chicken.

751
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,260
Yeah.

752
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,540
He always criticizes people.

753
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,180
-He’s got countless bad habits.
-Thank you.

754
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,340
Then why do you like him?

755
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:32,060
He has bad temper.

756
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,220
But as a Prince Charming,

757
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,340
he’s handsome enough.

758
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,610
It means

759
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,460
he’s charming with advantages?

760
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,300
I hear he’s asked to go to blind dates,

761
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,540
but he never goes.

762
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,660
So, he’s still single.

763
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:49,180
I don’t think so.

764
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,140
I hear he had an ex-girlfriend

765
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,540
who was gorgeous.

766
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,420
Are you sure?

767
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:55,740
I heard about it from a senior student.

768
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:56,540
It must be true.

769
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,800
His ex-girlfriend is gorgeous?

770
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,560
Of course.

771
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,420
His grandfather forces him
to get married

772
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,920
and arranges a lot of blind dates,

773
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,860
just to make him
forget his ex-girlfriend.

774
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,780
How much does he like his ex-girlfriend

775
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,020
so that he keeps his integrity for her?

776
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,700
I can no longer expect

777
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,940
to be his girlfriend.

778
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,300
You’re right.

779
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,220
But what’s this?

780
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,420
(FAN CLUB JYX)

781
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:24,020
Exclusive badge
for Ji Yanxin’s supporters.

782
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,020
Only official members have one.

783
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,260
You all have one?

784
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,340
Of course.

785
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,140
We also made souvenirs of him.

786
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:31,620
Look. Look.

787
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,420
Look.

788
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:35,940
Wait.

789
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,500
Come on. Hold it for me.

790
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:39,580
What are you doing?

791
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,180
Let me show you something.

792
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:45,300
How lovely!

793
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,580
-Let me take a photo.
-Looks so cute.

794
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:46,810
I want it, too.

795
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:47,200
Let me take a photo.

796
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,940
If it can be made into souvenirs,

797
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,220
many students will want them

798
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,260
after they know.

799
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:55,500
Seriously?

800
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,380
I can make a lot of money, then.

801
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,620
Sure.

802
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:58,820
First,

803
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,220
you paint very well.

804
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:02,860
Even if you’re no longer a fan,

805
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,540
you can make a big fortune
with his souvenirs.

806
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,650
Shall we befriend each other on WeChat?

807
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:08,860
Come on. Let me scan your QR code.

808
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:09,820
I’ll do it.

809
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:10,300
Come on.

810
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,140
Wait.

811
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,140
Qi Nian?

812
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:14,820
-Qi Nian?
-Yes.

813
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,340
Sell souvenirs
after you’re no longer a fan?

814
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,140
Prof. Ji.

815
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:21,860
Hello, Prof. Ji.

816
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,380
He... Hello, Prof. Ji.

817
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,980
You get braver, huh?

818
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:27,860
No, no.

819
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:30,030
Wait a second.

820
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:32,460
(Come on, Dream Chaser!)

821
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:37,820
Where are you going?

822
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:39,740
Professor.

823
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:42,500
Could you pretend I died now?

824
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:43,460
No.

825
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,060
Bye-bye.

826
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:52,820
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

827
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,620
Professor, you’re angry?

828
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:00,100
I’m not a fan.

829
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,260
I just had a loose tongue

830
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,600
about souvenirs.

831
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,320
I don’t care.

832
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,240
So much for today’s work.

833
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:09,720
You can leave.

834
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,100
Have you finished the fried chicken?

835
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,620
I shared it with them.

836
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,300
I don’t like it.

837
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,260
And I don’t have an appetite.

838
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:21,720
Why?

839
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,240
You love it most, don’t you?

840
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,840
I no longer like fried chicken.

841
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,560
Hearing about his ex-girlfriend

842
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,760
made me lose my appetite.

843
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,280
I knew a little girl’s love

844
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,000
couldn’t be reliable.

845
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,120
I’m not a little girl!

846
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,840
Yanxin, you’re back?

847
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,560
You’re here, too.

848
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,460
Yanxin, you know what?

849
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,740
She is a fake TA.

850
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,980
She isn’t a student
of Chunming University.

851
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:54,660
She’s a liar!
