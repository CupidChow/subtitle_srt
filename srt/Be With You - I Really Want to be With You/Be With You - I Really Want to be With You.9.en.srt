Ji, I’ve asked people

25
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,010
to look into Rongpin’s recruiting list.

26
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,730
Siqi’s name wasn’t in it.

27
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,770
Thought so.

28
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:55,970
I got it.

29
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,200
Why would I listen to him?

30
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,040
Wearing this doesn’t

31
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,190
suit me at all.

32
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:17,930
So uncomfortable.

33
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,520
I shouldn’t copy him.

34
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,520
Why would I drink Americano?

35
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,330
It’s too bitter to drink at all.

36
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,410
Please come in.

37
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,130
Now we meet again.

38
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,130
Don’t you have anything to say?

39
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,130
About

40
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,050
the reason why I’m here.

41
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,090
You’re Rongpin’s chief content designer,

42
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,210
you’re here to do orientation, right?

43
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,050
You learn fast.

44
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,690
With your ability,

45
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,760
it’s not so bizarre

46
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,710
for you to reach the position.

47
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,370
Watch your mouth.

48
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,920
Are you clear of

49
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,930
your job here?

50
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,690
To serve.

51
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,400
Rongpin’s got the most professional

52
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,570
girl manga creating team.

53
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,120
I’ve been looking forward

54
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,330
to becoming one of you.

55
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,710
But,

56
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,890
not you.

57
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,640
Do you know what’s going on here?

58
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,130
Who’s making decisions?

59
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,640
Your comics are okay,

60
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,370
or I’d just...

61
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,090
Never mind.

62
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,010
Forget about the past.

63
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,850
As long as you apologize,

64
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,360
I’ll make an exception to hire you.

65
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,130
Impossible.

66
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,240
Are you aware of your

67
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,250
circumstance at all?

68
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,090
Now, I am your boss.

69
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,690
Maybe not.

70
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,930
So,

71
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,760
you don’t want this job.

72
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,570
I want it.

73
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,640
Then apologize.

74
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,410
No.

75
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,370
Save it.

76
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,920
If you want dignity, then no job.

77
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,570
The world is not all about you.

78
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,080
Then just don’t hire me.

79
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,210
Why would you come here?

80
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,840
You just want a chance

81
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,810
to humiliate me.

82
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,730
We should call it even.

83
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,530
I’m trying to help.

84
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,090
I don’t need it.

85
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,720
I’m used to be a man with dignity

86
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,050
but not cave to be others’ dog.

87
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,490
Thank you for your lame coffee,
good-bye.

88
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,510
Nice. You’ve got balls.

89
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,570
Don’t let me meet with you again.

90
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,410
Enjoying being a hero?

91
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,930
Is it so hard to cave?

92
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:11,890
No.

93
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,490
I’ve got to run

94
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,330
before he comes to me.

95
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,960
I almost forgot.

96
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,970
Isn’t it a bit too late?

97
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,210
Why?

98
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,250
You lost a bet, and you want to run?

99
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,760
Wait.

100
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,730
How did you know that?

101
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,040
The stamp on your entry form

102
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,050
is so fake.

103
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,290
What?

104
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,930
It’s a fake all the time then.

105
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,810
I can’t believe them.

106
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,000
Starting from today, Rongpin

107
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,200
and Lu Qingwu

108
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,170
are dead to me.

109
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,610
Wait.

110
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:49,800
So you’ve known from the beginning.

111
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,960
Why wouldn't you tell me?

112
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,810
What a set up.

113
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,730
No one forces you to bet.

114
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,930
Do you regret it now?

115
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,090
I’m a man who will stick to my words.

116
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,000
I can work at your company.

117
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,640
Also learn to drink Americano.

118
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,600
Don’t think that you’ve won.

119
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,730
I’ll continue protesting.

120
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,770
It’s still bad.

121
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,410
It’s fine.

122
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,840
When you come to my company,

123
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,850
you can slowly adapt to it.

124
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,330
But as for you now,

125
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,890
sugar is necessary.

126
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,050
Call me brother.

127
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,410
No, no, no. Don’t shake it.

128
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,890
It’ll taste bad.

129
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,520
Miss Lu.

130
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,250
Yes?

131
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,160
Data of the new comics have updated.

132
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,480
Do you want to check?

133
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,280
It got first again.

134
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,290
What’s the point of checking?

135
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,810
Well.

136
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,210
What’s wrong?

137
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,770
You better see for yourself.

138

Dress for the Beauty’s views

139

(Best Works Hot Sales Fastest Rising)
have reached the top on the first day.

140
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,290
It broke the record of Flower & Romance.

141
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,290
Miss He,

142
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,290
I didn’t buy marketing data

143
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,920
neither pay for fake accounts.

144
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,170
How is it possible?

145
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,410
Baby Seven wasn’t even famous before.

146
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,920
But, right now.

147
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,360
We need to work on commercials.

148
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,840
Call a meeting now.

149
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:45,680
Editor,

150
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,650
let me call my assistant now.

Let’s start the meeting first.

152

Come.

153
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,970
I can’t draw comics anymore, right?

154
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,130
Is there any place for you now?

155
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,330
Get real, will you?

156
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:25,590
Hello?

157
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,440

About what?

160
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,120
First day of Dress for the Beauty,

161
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,680
its views have reached the top

and broke the record
of Flower & Romance.

163
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:37,640
Congratulations.

164
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,640
You can be a professional
comics artist now.

165
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,840
You can realize your dream now.

I’m not going back.

169
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,890
I want to continue drawing.

170
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,570
Get in there.

171
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:51,480
No.

172
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:51,880
Get in!

173
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,730
I’m not going back.

174
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,530
Get in now.

175
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,850
I’m not going back.

176
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,490
Who are you?

177
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,160
I’m sorry.

178
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,890
I didn’t hear you clearly,
please repeat again.

179
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,050
Let me ask you.

180
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,160
What’s your relationship with Ji Siqi?

181
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,520
I’m his partner.

182
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,570
May I ask who you are?

183
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,330
I’m his older brother.

184
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,610
Hi, brother.

185
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,090
I’m not your brother.

186
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,570
What did you say to him exactly?

187
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
If he can’t succeed,

188
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,090
don’t give him hope.

189
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,650
-You are ruining him.
-Hello?

190
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:33,310
Hello?

191
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,200
Sorry, my signal was bad.

192
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,320
I didn’t hear you clearly.

193
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,680
Don’t worry, anyway.

194
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,800
I’ll be responsible for Siqi.

195
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,520
Please leave him to me.

196
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,690
I’ll make him happy.

197
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,850
What?

(Recent Calls My Crush)

199
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,370
Where’s Qi Nian?

200
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,090
So, you’re Key.

201
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,450
Baby Seven found a treasure.

202
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,530
Wait, where’s she?

203
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,040
What’s the rush?

204
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,760
Look at this first, it’s from her.

205
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,570
What’s this?

206
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,220
The contract of Dress for the Beauty.

207
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,080
(Dress for the Beauty
Comics Signing Contract)

208
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,440
(MC Culture Limited)
It’s got your name on the writer’s list.

209
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,330
(Party B: Qi Nian Pseudonym: Baby Seven)
You need to sign.

210

(Party B: Pei Siqi Pseudonym: Key)

211

Don’t you understand?

212
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,360
Qi Nian has decided that you two

213
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,240
would be coworkers

214
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,010
when she signed the contract.

215
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,840
So you’re more than just an assistant.

216
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,890
You’re the coworker of the comic.

217
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,290
Why would she do this?

218
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,850
She also wanted me to ask you

219
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,040
if it’s worth it for you

220
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,650
to be against Lu Qingwu

221
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,210
for Thither Cloud.

222
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,450
Yes.

223
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,320
Even if the real Qiyue Qingwu

224
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,410
never shows up.

225
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,210
I’d fight for his interests.

226
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,850
Does it have anything
to do with the contract?

227
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,010
This is enough.

228
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,170
Just sign it.

229
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,210
Wait, wait, wait a second.

230
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,330
Where has Qi Nian gone?

231
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,850
She went to find her hero.

232
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,650
Her hero?

233
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,170
Don’t you know that?

234
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,050
The prototype of Mr. J.

235
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,890
Now her boss, too.

236
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,130
What?

237
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,210
I thought it’s her friend’s story.

238
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,570
It’s her own story.

239
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,720
You haven’t come down
since you went back home.

240
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,090
Did you fall asleep?

241
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:04,930
Where are you?

242
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,360
I’m at my boss’s to sort the files,

243
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,970
I’ve lost track of time.

244
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,130
I’ll go and pick you.

245
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,720
It’s dark outside.

246
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,290
Maybe another day?

247
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,440
No, no matter how late it gets.

248
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,560
You have to come back.

249
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,360
You haven’t been home for a week.

250
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,730
Don’t fool around out there.

251
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,360
Why has he become

252
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,250
so whiny recently?

253
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,370
Prof. Ji.

254
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,690

about his sleepwalking.

00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,770
He’s probably sleepwalking now.

Let me help you up.

263
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,410
Did I...?

264
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,640
No, nothing happened.

265
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,370
I felt over near your bed.

266
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,120
So you know about my sleepwalking.

267
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,010
Right?

268
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,290
I...

269
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,250
Well, I have something to do.

270
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,500
Oh no, oh no.

271

It’s the second time, the second time.

272
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,140
What second time?

273
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,060
Nothing, nothing.

274
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,390
Siqi, don’t wait for me.

275
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,980
It’s alright,
as long as you’re off duty.

276
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,590
How did you know that?

277
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,020
Why are you here?

278
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,270
I asked for your address
from the editor.

279
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,260
This is your boss’s home.

280
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,340
Nice apartment.

281
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,630

289
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,430
Sit tight.

290
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,110

291
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,340
No, I’m not.

Thank you for saving my work.

301
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,070
Though it’s my future work.

302
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,260
If it weren’t for you,

303
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,740
I may have stopped writing

304
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,460
and taken over my family business.

305
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,070
Wouldn’t it be great?

306
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,530
No.

307
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,030
Then I wouldn’t be able to be with you.

308
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,580
Anyway,

309
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,510
thanks to you, my career got

310

to continue.

311
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,020
So...

312
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,140
So, are you going to tell me or what?

313
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,180
Yes, I am, I’ll tell you.

314
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,060
Don’t take it seriously.

315
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,990
Handle it as trash information.

316

It’s just things between you

317
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,830
and your boss, right?

318
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,540
So easy to guess.

319
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,780
Among all the people in your life,

320
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,230
he’s the only one that’s mean.

321
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,880
Well, you are a very smart

322
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,270
trash bin.

323
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:49,780
Actually,

324
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,420
people like me who swoop into things

325
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,270
don’t deserve to get benefits.

326
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,940
I knew that there’s something wrong

327
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,060
with him, and I took advantage of him

328
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:56,860
when he wasn’t clear-minded.

329
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,900
Arrogant people

330
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,860
like him,

331
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,940
how mad would he get

332
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:00,820
when I saw the worst

333
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,620
of him.

334
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,500
How should I

335
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,420
face him tomorrow?

336
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,190
I, I’ll definitely...

337
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:07,830
Where is he?

338
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,260
The man who sells these
needed to go home.

339
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,910
So I bought them all, here.

340
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,360
Thank you.

341
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,750
That’s pretty.

342
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,070
Do you know why?

343
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,780
Because it’s not daytime now.

344
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,390
So everything is in shadow.

345
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,910
Just like your thoughts

346
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,750
hidden deeply in your heart.

347
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:32,860
But people who understand you

348
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:33,910
find it cute.

349
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,410
Really?

350
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,260
But why does he have

351
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,540
to be your boss who’s a jerk?

352
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,150
He even was the comic’s prototype.

353
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,700
It’s such a Stockholm Syndrome.

354
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,070
How did you know?

355
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,030
How much of the comics

356
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,830
was true by proportion?

357
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,660
Half, half.

358
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,230
Why did you ask?

359
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,140
I’ll punch him to death

360
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,460
according to the proportion.

361
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,700
Calm down, calm down.

362
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,780
It was all my fault.

363
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,420
It has nothing to do with him.

364
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,190
I don’t care.

365
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,340
You’re upset.

366
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,510
So he’s in trouble.

367
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,790
But I’m getting a lot better.

368
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:09,790
Really?

369
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:11,230
Thanks to you.

370
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,990
Come on, let’s go home.

371
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,310
Come on.

372
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,220
Thank you, Siqi.

373
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,020
No worries.

374
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,110
We’re the best partners.

375
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:39,990
Come.

376
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:41,860
Yeah.

377
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,780
Our comic has beaten Lu Qingwu.

378
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,620
Go.

379
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,310
Let’s have fun! Baby Seven,
hold on tight.

380
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,790
Electric motorcycle is so fun.

381
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,390
Are we getting home soon?

382
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,110
We’ve passed it.

383
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,220
Pei Siqi.

384
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:07,790
Passed it.

385
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,740
Qi Nian, I want to tell you something.

386
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,230
Don’t tell me the brake isn’t working.

387
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,630
They seemed so.

388
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,020
But it’s OK.

389
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,140
Once the battery runs out,

390
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,450
it will stop itself.

391
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,430
That means

392
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,860
let’s ride until the dawn.

393
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,350
Maybe we can see sunrise.

394
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,150
Pei Siqi, can I punch you?

395
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,070
What, what should we do?

396
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,070
Don’t look, look straight.

397
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,420
I don’t want to ride on it anymore.

398
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,860
The wind is hurting my face.

399
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,110
Same.

400
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,110
Excuse me, who are you looking for?

401
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,900
Two kids who just got in.

402
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,670
They live

403
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,380
on the same floor.

404
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,710
The couple is really sweet.

405
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:45,870
Couple?

406
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,820
They come and go together every day.

407
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,420
Both good-looking.

408
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,550
Of course they are a couple.

409
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,470
See,

410
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,430
the lights are off at the same time.

411
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,990
Kids nowadays get mature too soon.

412
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,950
Why do you care so much?

413
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,050
Are you their teacher?

414
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,290
It’s common for the young to be in love.

415
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:19,850
No.

416
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,330
Are you the girl’s relative?

417
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,970
Coming to separate them?

418
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,580
(Siqi)

419
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,420
(Assistant)

420
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,370
What to do when you see your

421
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,760
younger brother in a hotel

422
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:57,730
with his girlfriend?

423
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,770
What are you talking about?

424
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,250
I, I’m talking about the posts on Zhihu.

425
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,650
Why…
Why are you looking at me like that?

426
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,730
Why are you still here?

427
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,240
Standing here,

428
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,410
waiting to see them in love?

429
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,770
Prof. Ji?

430
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:30,960
Hello, Prof. Ji.

431
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,170
Check your work e-mail.

432
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:35,930
Okay.

433
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,290
Please wait a minute.

434
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:44,380
(Ji Yanxin Work Relevant)

435
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,800
I’m sorry, Prof. Ji.

436
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,720
I got home late,

437
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,210
I didn’t see your e-mail.

438
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,600
No.

439
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,850
Didn’t you just send them to me?

440
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,200
Come back to work immediately.

441
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:55,980
You have 30 minutes.

442
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,120
Well.

443
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,210
It’d take me an hour by subway.

444
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,330
You have 29 minutes now.

445
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,690
Prof. Ji.

446
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,530
Seriously?

447
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,160
(Planning your route.)

448
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,930
(It may take 28 minutes in total.)

449
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,960
Sir, are you here?

450
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,320
I’m coming down.

451
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,410
Please wait for me.

452
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,120
25 minutes left.

453
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:50,930
Sir, hurry.

454
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,640
Sir, please drive faster.

455
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,200
Or I’d be in trouble again.

456
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:01,930
Okay.

457
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:06,660
(Remain true to the original inspiration,
keep the mission in mind.)

458
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,010
(Taxi)
Sir, it’s green light now. Let’s go!

459
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,360
Does he know how to drive at all?

460
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,840
He changed to our lane and braked.

461
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,850
Sir, let’s switch the lane.

462
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,040
Little girl.

463
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,530
Full lines on the road, we can’t switch.

464
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,160
How could he drive like that?

465
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,450
So rude.

466
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:17,250
Too slow.

467
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,570
30 minutes, just in time.

468
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:23,050
Come in.

469
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,610
Why don’t you come closer?

470
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,850
Worrying that I may eat you?

471
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,010
Sir.

472
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,650
Are you sober right now?

473
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:00,930
What do you say?

474
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,730
I can tell by this cold looking.

475
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,360
You only look at me tenderly

476
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,650
when you’re sleepwalking.

477
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,570
Sorry.

478
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,480
Have I done anything

479
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,130
inappropriate when I’m not awake?

480
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,250
I mean, more than kissing.

481
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:23,920
No, not that.

482
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,480
Please trust yourself.

483
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,840
Even when you lose consciousness,

484
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,320
you’re still a gentleman.

485
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,400
Things like taking advantages

486
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,280
when someone is in trouble

487
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,560
can just leave to me.

488
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,570
I’m very capable of...

489
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:35,960
Sorry.

490
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,010
I, I don’t know what I’m talking about.

491
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,450
I don’t think so.

492
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,440
Do, do I need to excuse myself

493
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,450
next time when it happens?

494
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,930
Do you want to?

495
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,680
I’m fine either way.

496
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,120
But your condition

497
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,400
is not a regular thing.

498
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,570
Do you need me
to take you to the doctor?

499
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,610
It’s an old illness.

500
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,170
It happens whenever I’m stressed.

501
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,280
Plus, I’ve met a lot of

502
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,450
knotty problems lately.

503
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,530
Your clothes...

504
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,230
Mom.

505
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:31,850
I bought it online, it’s too big.

506
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,520
Though I know lying is wrong,

507
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,160
telling the truth

508
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,090
would be worse.

509
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,680
Sir.

510
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,690
Do you need me to do anything?

511
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,770
I’ve sent you an e-mail.

512
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,730
Which should I deal with first?

513
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,050
The latest one.

514
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,490
My pencil broke.

515
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,250
Peel 30 pencils for me now.

516
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,440
He is so unstable.

517
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,840
Why wouldn’t he just buy
a pencil sharpener?

518
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,850
Why called me all the way here?

519
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,250
Come back to work immediately.

520
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,090
You have 30 minutes.

521
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,410
29 minutes left now.

522
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,530
That’s what you have.

523
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,090
Prof. Ji.

524
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,730
When did you come?

525
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,560
I’ve called 21 times yesterday,

526
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,290
but you didn’t pick up your phone.

527
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,250
Sorry, I...

528
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:54,850
Where did you go?

529
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,210
Who was with you?

530
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,320
My roommate.

531
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,180
My work has been great recently,

532
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:01,370
so I went out with him

533
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,450
to celebrate.

534
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,690
Roommate?

535
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:06,530
Roommate who rents a room together.

536
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:08,850
I see.

537
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:12,930
How did you celebrate?

538
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,380
He rented an electric motorcycle

539
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:16,810
and took me for a ride.

540
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,910
But in the middle of the ride,

541
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,310
the brake was broken.

542
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,160
Our faces were

543
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,690
hurt by the wind.

544
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,410
Was it fun?

545
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,570
Yes.

546
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,970
Riding an electric motorcycle
makes people happy?

547
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,200
Yes, it does.

548
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,690
Going on a ride is already pleasant.

549
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,070
Come to the entrance when you wake up.

550
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,510
Prof. Ji.

551
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:15,220
Why are you riding a motorcycle?

552
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,710
It’s not really your style.

553
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,190
I’m not riding it.

554
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,270
You ride it.

555
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:25,750
I...

556
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,990
Taking Ji Yanxin to work.

557
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,150
That means...

558
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,740
Don’t be nervous.

559
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:56,790
What I’m holding is the pillow.

560
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:59,340
You can hold in whichever way you want.

561
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,590
I’m okay with it.

562
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,150
Let’s go.

563
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:03,870
Along yesterday’s route.

564
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,540
But it’s not leading to the office.

565
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,750
Just ride a few more rounds.

566
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,750
Like last night.

567
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,860
Prof, why do you keep talking
about last night?

568
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,220
Weren’t you at home the entire night?

569
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:14,950
Shut up.

570
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:16,630
Just drive.

571
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,540
He’s upset during the whole time.

572
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:40,430
Am I riding or locked in a prison van?

573
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:03,710
Prof. Ji.

574
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:06,820
Didn’t you charge it last night?

575
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:07,550
I don’t know.

576
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,150
What now?

577
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,230
It’s got pedals.

578
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,110
You can ride it yourself.

579
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:17,350
I...

580
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:27,430
Wait.

581
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:32,000
Go.

582
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,630
Why are you so heavy?

583
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,460
(ID Card)

584
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:13,700
(Yiyan Office)

585
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,430
Mr. Ji.

586
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,750
Hello, Mr. Ji.

587
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:16,940
Hello, Mr. Ji.

588
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:17,790
Hello, Mr. Ji.

589
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,830
Qi Nian, what are you doing here?

590
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:26,580
Who’s that?

591
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,540
Who’s that?

592
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,310
Hurry, hurry.

593
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,070
Go, go, go.

594
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:34,510
Hello, Mr. Ji.

595
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:36,950
Hello, Mr. Ji.

596
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:38,590
Hello, Mr. Ji.

597
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,390
Who is that?

598
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:46,150
How come they froze
when they saw you?

599
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,990
It’s because they saw you.

600
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,470
Me?

601
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:52,910
You see.

602
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,790
What am I seeing?

603
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,590
Look, look.

604
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,750
Interesting, very interesting.

605
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:17,070
It’s exactly like the home study.

606
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,660
You couldn’t tell any

607
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,790
personal preferences except
for job-related stuff.

608
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,180
Such a big workload.

609
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,750
No wonder he’s under stress.

610
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,580
Prof. Ji.

611
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,780
Don’t you have any

612
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,460
other ways to relax?

613
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,230
Yes.

614
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,190
You.

615
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,220
I’m flattered.

616
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,630
But I’ve done nothing.

617
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,180
Just standing there,

618
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,750
you’ve cleared the air.

619
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,590
Let me pour some coffee for you.

620
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,260
Qi Nian, Qi Nian.

621
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,940
You didn’t come home again due to work.

622
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,260
Does your boss have any humanity?

623
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,790
It’s already two and still not over.

624
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:02,700
Tell me.

625
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,100
What’s your office’s name?

626
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,470
I’ll call them and protest.

627
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,030
I’ve found your company’s number, wait.

628
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:10,860
Calm down, Siqi.

629
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,670
You didn’t call, right?

630
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,470
Mr. Ji.

631
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:21,780
The phone in the front

632
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,580
has been ringing since morning.

633
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,100
A man whose surname is Pei

634
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,790
called to complain the company’s boss.

635
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,510
Pei?

636
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,110
