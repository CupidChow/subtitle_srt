20
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,320
Why does everyone always like

21
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,310
such self-deceiving things?

22
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,760
It’s been eight years

23
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,880
and you just ask me now.

24
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,160
No matter how sweet the love is
in the comics,

25
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,840
it’s just medicine wrapped in sugar
in reality.

26
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,830
It’s sweet at first,

27
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,910
but it will get bitter in your mouth.

28
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,150
Unrequited love is even more.

29
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,910
Unrequited love?

30
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,030
You?

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,880
Are you kidding me?

32
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,520
I’m Lu Qingwu.

33
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,150
I always have so many choices.

34
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,510
Unrequited love?

35
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,600
Then, what is bothering you?

36
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,150
You can just grab the thing you want.

37
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,430
Grab?

38
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,190
That’s so nice to him.

39
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,070
Lickspittle can get nothing in the end.

40
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,510
I won’t give him any chance.

41
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:56,600
Comic Cafe?

42
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,390
He went back to do part-time job again?

43
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,360
Look at you.

44
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,430
You even set up the positioning system.

45
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,590
A piece of cake.

46
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,160
Last time he got drunk,

47
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,070
so I…

48
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,680
Watch your identity,

49
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,560
Miss Lu.

50
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,720
Now you’re even supervising him.

51
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,520
Didn’t you say you wouldn’t give him
any chance?

52
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,040
I’m afraid it will scare him if I

53
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,830
act so directly.

54
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,870
I have to take steps.

55
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,320
If he wants to run,

56
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,870
you can just take him down in one gulp.

57
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,240
You really got bullied?

58
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,120
You, a small lamb,

59
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,230
ran to the place of a wolf yourself.

60
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,470
Why are you so careless?

61
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,630
My bad.

62
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,720
I’m such an idiot.

63
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,630
How could I believe that she wouldn’t
do anything?

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,880
But our Key

65
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,870
is at the age to the next stage.

66
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,360
Congratulations!

67
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,190
You don’t need to become a Wizard!

68
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,680
What Wizard?

69
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,520
Don’t you know it?

70
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,440
It’s a legend.

71
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,790
If a man more than 25 hasn’t had…

72
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,390
He will become a wizard.

73
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,760
And the longer he hasn’t had that,
the more powerful he is.

74
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,240
A Grand Wizard when he is 30.

75
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,640
Professor Wizard when he is 40.

76
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,600
When he is 50…

77
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,720
Grand Master Wizard.

78
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,280
Enough. Enough.

79
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,390
Stop talking about that.

80
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,920
How could there be friends like you?

81
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,440
You’re not the one who got bullied.

82
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,390
It’s bothering me.

83
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,280
I won’t stand on any side.

84
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,880
If you really think
she is bothering you,

85
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,230
I suggest you to call the police.

86
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,950
It’s not that serious.

87
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,430
Key,

88
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,150
do you really have feelings for her?

89
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,910
Is it the so-called “forgive and forget”

90
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,600
after bedding?

91
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,270
Don’t ask him.

92
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,910
He will never admit it.

93
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,760
Since, you got the “license”,

94
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,960
remember to obey the rules.

95
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,280
Or, you will become like me.

96
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:50,880
Chong,

97
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,040
you’re pregnant now.

98
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,520
Is it OK to let your baby hear this?

99
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,760
It’s OK.

100
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,720
Doctor said the due date is next week.

101
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,630
It won’t come out…

102
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,630
What’s wrong?

103
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,030
The water broke!

104
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:07,720
(Comic Cafe)

105
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,030
(Comic Cafe)
He has been in there the whole morning.

106
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,350
Is there any beauty inside?

107
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,710
Wait.

108
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,150
Why am I so angry?

109
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,030
I’m like a stalker now.

110
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,750
No way.

111
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,960
He is so adorable.

112
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,230
Wait. Wait. Wait.

113
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,350
Those photos should be used
to threaten him.

114
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,120
Not to let you miss him!

115
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,280
Look at you.

116
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,840
If you really want to get him,

117
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,000
you should give up the hard
and soft tactics.

118
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,190
Just proclaim your sovereignty directly.

119
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,270
That’s so fierce.

120
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,080
Don’t you have his awful photos?

121
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,320
Spread them on the Internet.

122
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,750
Let’s see if he dare resist.

123
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,190
Xiao, you’re such a jerk.

124
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,190
He is just a boy.

125
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,520
Just tell me

126
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,790
whether you want to get him or not.

127
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,510
I want.

128
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,320
Hello?

129
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,960
I’m busy.

130
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,910
Just be quick.

131
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:29,920
Help!

132
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,670
Are you near?

133
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,280
I am.

134
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,190
Ji Siqi, what happened?

135
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,910
Come here! It’s so dangerous now!

136
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:36,660
Most urgent!

137
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,120
Hello?

138
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,010
Ji Siqi?

139
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:39,490
Hello?

140
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,270
Calm down. It’s OK.

141
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:52,360
-Hang in there.
-Your face is alright.

142
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,510
And you’re in your sense.

143
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,440
What are you doing?

144
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,880
You scared me!

145
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,960
Who is in danger?

146
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,920
What are you doing?

147
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,680
It’s not me.

148
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,670
My friend is giving birth.

149
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,400
Baby, don’t come out now.

150
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,120
I don’t want you to come out and see…

151
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,350
An anthomaniac.

152
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:10,870
Sis…

153
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,550
Well…

154
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,470
Thank you for it today.

155
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,800
Luckily, you arrived in time

156
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,360
and took my friend to the hospital.

157
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,480
Otherwise,

158
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,190
she might’ve given birth at the cafe

159
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,720
and named her baby

160
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,520
Mansheng, or Kasheng.

161
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,480
Really. Trust me,

162
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,760
she would definitely do that.

163
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,310
I left my job

164
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,950
to accompany you for a few hours
outside the delivery room,

165
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:45,340
witnessing the most

166
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,440
devastating moment in a woman’s life.

167
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,190
Now I’m still in fear.

168
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,230
But you only say thank you to me?

169
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,950
Or…

170
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,350
I can say it for ten times.

171
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,120
Or you want to hear multilingual
versions of it?

172
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,110
Multilingual versions?

173
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,990
You got a good brain.

174
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,190
Then why do you

175
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,790
suddenly lose your memory?

176
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,430
You want to forget
what happened that night?

177
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,200
Or you just want to discard me,

178
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:14,870
boy?

179
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,840
I… I was about to say it.

180
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,520
You were the one who tried to

181
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,200
get me drunk.

182
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,230
How could I take the initiative?

183
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,030
Alright.

184
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,310
What are you doing?

185
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,750
Are you happy tonight?

186
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,430
Yes.

187
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,240
Let me die!

188
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,020
Stop playing it!

189
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,160
Die?

190
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,340
No way.

191
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,940
If I got pregnant,

192
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,120
my baby would lose his dad.

193
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,080
It was not my safe period that night.

194
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,070
Stop!

195
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:49,630
You… Stop talking about it.

196
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,130
You’re a girl!

197
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:52,600
What do you want?

198
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,070
Can’t you tell?

199
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:55,360
I’m wooing you.

200
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,640
Wooing me?

201
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,570
Aren’t you trying to poach me?

202
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,310
I’m both wooing you

203
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,010
and poaching you.

204
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,350
In your dream.

205
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,510
You can’t succeed in any of it.

206
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,150
Then let me focus on one of it first.

207
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,070
Let’s date.

208
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,520
What a crazy woman.

209
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,280
If you dare to say that again,

210
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,150
I will send the video
to Qi Nian right away.

211
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:16,960
Shame…

212
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,110
Shame on me, right?

213
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,120
Sorry,

214
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,200
this is just how I am.

215
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,120
And I am also unfaithful in love

216
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,070
with so many other pursuers.

217
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,550
You think I will be loyal to you?

218
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:27,790
So,

219
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,360
if I were you,

220
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,520
I would just follow the order.

221
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,520
I’ll be tired of you soon anyway

222
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,950
and we’ll become strangers again.

223
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,400
Just take this

224
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,520
as a branch in a game,

225
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,030
which can give you more experience.

226
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:39,990
Forget it.

227
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,920
You’re the type

228
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,040
of the girl I’d never

229
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,950
flirt with even in the game.

230
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,350
From tomorrow on,

231
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,680
keep your phone on call

232
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,910
for 24 hours a day.

233
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,440
What?

234
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,230
And…

235
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,120
Clock in.

236
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,310
For today.

237
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,920
Don’t worry.

238
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,150
You just need to kiss on my face today.

239
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,090
Let’s make it step by step.

240
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,350
Go away as far as you can.

241
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,750
Does that look good?

242
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,790
I’ll use it as my wallpaper.

243
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,390
Clock in, right?

244
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:31,960
OK.

245
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,830
Finally, you figure it out…

246
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,350
What is this?

247
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,040
Clock in.

248
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,000
For a whole week.

249
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,710
Get lost now!

250
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,670
You brat.

251
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,310
Let’s wait and see.

252
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,270
This is thoughtful.

253
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,070
Looks like you’re
really Baby Seven’s fan.

254
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,990
I’m a fan of her works.

255
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,720
And in the same kind of authors,

256
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,880
no matter it’s for the style,

257
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,200
or the imagination,

258
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,550
no one can surpass her.

259
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,390
But she doesn’t catch
the ordinary style.

260
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,390
And I found

261
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,000
her early style in juvenile comics

262
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,320
was pretty like the
legendary Thither Cloud.

263
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,870
I don’t know if she was imitating
or just showing respect.

264
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,560
Or maybe just the appreciation
between the geniuses.

265
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,430
Alright. Alright.

266
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,070
There are enough praises for today.

267
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,430
You’re really a former idolater.

268
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,320
But,

269
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,560
you have paid enough attention to her.

270
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,430
How could you be so perfunctory
with other authors?

271
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,750
Look at your article.

272
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,000
There are five authors,

273
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,870
three of which are wrong.

274
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,720
And you mixed their works up.

275
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,550
How could we publish this?

276
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,280
Ma’am,

277
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,040
I didn’t mean it.

278
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,640
Of course, I know you didn’t.

279
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,390
If you did…

280
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,000
Luckily, we found it

281
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,270
and one of our colleagues withdrew it.

282
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,990
If it had been delivered
to the director,

283
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,190
you’d be fired today.

284
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,670
Who is that colleague?

285
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,870
I think I should treat him dinner.

286
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,070
Why is it you?

287
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,390
So, you’re the one who
withdrew my article?

288
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,960
Who else do you think

289
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,030
can help you

290
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,510
all the time except me in the company?

291
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,110
The summer vacation is a good time
to focus on your idol.

292
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,910
Why do you come to be an intern?

293
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,040
Am I just an ignorant girl

294
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,280
who knows nothing

295
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,110
but only her idols in your mind?

296
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,310
Of course not.

297
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,750
Here,

298
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,080
you can also take photos,
retouch photos,

299
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,360
draw pictures, write articles,
cut videos,

300
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,640
do promotions, and fight

301
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,200
for your idols online.

302
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,510
So great of you.

303
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,950
The key point is, you don’t lack money.

304
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,390
Is this a praise?

305
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,910
And you look pretty.

306
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,270
Really?

307
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,590
Of course I’m lying.

308
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,430
Mr. Shao,

309
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,190
the internal selection meeting is ready.

310
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,110
I’m going now.

311
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,310
Ji Qiu,

312
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,350
this is Mr. Shao’s office.

313
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,790
Why are you, an intern, here?

314
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,390
Get out now.

315
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:53,830
OK.

316
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:03,560
Hello?

317
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,350
Miss Baby Seven,

318
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,350
is it convenient for us to discuss
our work today?

319
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,820
(You’re now at stage of friend with K.)

320
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,420
(K: Go away.)

321
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,780
(K: For one week. Get lost now!)

322
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,740
(K: Are you insane?)

323
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,350
Miss Lu.

324
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,700
(K: Don’t touch me.)

325
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:29,500
(K: What the heck?)

326
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:32,700
(K: Shut up.)

327
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,550
Xiao, what are you doing?

328
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,310
Can’t you see that I’m busy?

329
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,550
Busy with taking him down?

330
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,160
But he really

331
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,350
speaks so harshly.

332
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,480
Where do you like about him?

333
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,150
None of your business.

334
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,350
I just like it.

335
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,910
Turns out you like the style like this.

336
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,360
It’s so bitter.

337
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,990
Jia, add some sugar for me.

338
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,230
Don’t you have hands? Do it yourself.

339
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,960
Sorry… Sorry, Miss Lu.

340
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,230
I… I just acted wildly.

341
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,230
Your tone is like him.

342
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,550
But

343
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,390
you need to be more powerful.

344
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,110
Jia, follow me.

345
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,760
“It’s for a whole week.”

346
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,550
“Get lost now!”

347
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,240
It’s for a whole week.

348
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:16,990
Get lost now!

349
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,910
Still too light.

350
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,680
Make it harsher.

351
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,710
Just like… You know,

352
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,550
cute but angry.

353
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,240
It’s for a whole week.

354
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:26,990
Get lost now!

355
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,750
Too harsh.

356
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,840
It’s for a whole week.

357
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,870
Get lost now!

358
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,710
Too girly!

359
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,160
It’s for a whole week.

360
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,150
Get lost now!

361
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,350
Too greasy!

362
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,700
(PANG)

363
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,350
Are your comics

364
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,950
always polished by Ji Siqi?

365
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,390
That’s weird.

366
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,510
Why has his style taken such a turn
for the worse recently?

367
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,350
What’s wrong?

368
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,400
Don’t you think Key’s style

369
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,310
is weird lately?

370
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,510
There is nothing wrong with his skills.

371
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,270
But

372
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,840
it looks miserable.

373
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,030
Just like someone forced him to do it.

374
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,960
Did he know that

375
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,710
you and his brother are dating?

376
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:18,830
Wait.

377
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,280
What does the relationship of me and

378
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,830
Ji Yanxin have to do with his comics?

379
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,080
Don’t you know that

380
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,590
Ji Siqi likes you?

381
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,280
(Lu Qingwu)
My little boyfriend.

382
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,150
(Lu Qingwu)
Where are you?

383
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,430
Thanks.

384
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,560
Sugar is good.

385
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,670
But don’t have too much.

386
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,110
Don’t worry.

387
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,590
I know it.

388
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,640
I never ask more about

389
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,750
your personal life.

390
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,000
But didn’t you

391
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,320
go too far recently?

392
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:05,950
Did I?

393
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,630
Why don’t I think so?

394
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,000
When you realize it,

395
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,350
it will be too late.

396
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,430
You’re exaggerating.

397
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,630
Do you remember what you said?

398
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,990
Love is the fertilizer of works.

399
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,430
Don’t take it serious in mind.

400
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,840
Let alone the works,

401
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,590
I think you’re losing your mind now.

402
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,310
Xiao, stop setting labels for me.

403
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,950
How could I, Lu Qingwu, be obsessed
with only a man?

404
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,590
Well,

405
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,870
do you want to take my advice?

406
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,600
You can admire a man.

407
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,230
But,

408
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,590
never feel sorry for him.

409
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:49,790
Why?

410
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,910
Because you can change another one
to admire.

411
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,870
But to women,

412
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,550
once you feel sorry for a man,

413
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,550
it will be close to when you fall
in love with him.

414
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,360
And then you will sacrifice yourself.

415
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,350
Then you will lose all your life to him.

416
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,110
What a nonsense.

417
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,990
What does the saying go?

418
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,710
As strong as a mother.

419
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,270
Go away.

420
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,350
How could I fall in love with a kid?

421
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,140
(Cookie shared a location with you)

422
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,470
Well,

423
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,240
I still have something to do.

424
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,030
Guess who am…

425
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,280
Sorry. My bad.

426
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,390
I didn’t mean to do this.

427
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,390
Well,

428
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,830
I got this habit in high school.

429
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,030
Once someone approaches me
from behind, I will…

430
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,350
Are you alright?

431
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,630
I got hurt.

432
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,790
Only kisses and hugs can get me up.

433
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,830
Is this enough?

434
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,070
Time to clock in.

435
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,190
Didn’t I give you the one for a week?

436
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,070
With your poor kissing skill,

437
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,470
that only equals to one day.

438
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:35,800
I mean it.

439
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,750
If you were not a girl…

440
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,990
Didn’t you say you’re unfaithful?

441
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,400
Why don’t you turn to another one?

442
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,230
How could it be this soon?

443
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,240
What’s more,

444
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,600
if you want to get this over,

445
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,830
I have a better idea.

446
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,670
One kiss

447
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,070
can delete one photo.

448
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,390
When they are all deleted,

449
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,030
you can leave.

450
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,390
We should do it… Here?

451
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,670
Of course.

452
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,310
Come on.

453
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,080
I won’t embarrass you.

454
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,230
You just need to kiss on my lips.

455
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:22,800
Wait.

456
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,080
How many gigabytes do you have
on your phone?

457
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,560
512.

458
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,150
Go away!

459
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,680
Don’t you know that

460
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,310
Ji Siqi likes you?

461
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,000
After talking about the finished part,

462
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,440
should we make the plan

463
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,790
for the next chapter now?

464
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,150
Qi Nian,

465
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,880
don’t you think

466
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,760
it should enter the next chapter

467
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,710
after the hero and heroine are together?

468
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,550
What chapter?

469
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,550
Like, adult chapter.

470
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,840
The life after they are together

471
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,670
must be different from before.

472
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,120
Or, it may be…

473
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,080
Let’s ask Siqi.

474
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,350
I think he must know a lot.

475
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,230
Why do you suddenly ask about
the story after being together?

476
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,440
It’s about the subsequent

477
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,200
stories about Dress for the Beauty.

478
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,720
Mr. J has confessed to Xiaoqi.

479
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,630
What should the next story be?

480
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,750
Sweet story of course.

481
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,240
See?

482
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,550
What I said is true.

483
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,230
Do I have to write that?

484
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,640
(Key)
Many comics

485
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,040
(Key)
became popular

486
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,360
(Key)
after they added intimate scenes.

487
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,640
Compared to those comics,

488
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,160
I think Dress for the Beauty

489
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,190
is kind of pure and simple.

490
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,200
I suggest you to read

491
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,750
Lu Qingwu’s later comic.

492
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,360
It has intimate scenes regularly,

493
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,230
with no delay.

494
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,110
Although it’s shameless,

495
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,160
the readers all love it.

496
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,240
Brat!

497
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,350
Who do you mean shameless?

498
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,830
Intimate scenes?

499
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,430
Here is the thing.

500
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,200
You give me the storyboard,

501
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,670
I’ll be in charge of the first draft.

502
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,670
OK, deal.

503
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,990
He is really acting weird.

504
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,520
Of course he is.

505
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,640
He has to draw the girl he likes

506
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,030
with another man.

507
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,150
Have you done your work?

508
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,280
Can you leave

509
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,350
if you have nothing else to do?

510
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,920
Wait. Wait. Wait.

511
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,870
I still have something important to do.

512
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,750
You can speak now.

513
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,230
Speak what?

514
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,670
Didn’t… Didn’t you see my lipstick
is rubbed off?

515
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,310
Then just touch it up.

516
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:48,790
I didn’t take it with me.

517
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,190
I have.

518
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,670
I said I would pay for it.

519
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,240
I know your lipstick color now.

520
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,150
I will repay you later.

521
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,270
And,

522
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,150
it’s out of your lips.

523
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,710
You really bought it.

524
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,430
I promised you.

525
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,830
Can’t you draw now?

526
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:34,830
Kind of.

527
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,270
I’m not in a right state recently.

528
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,750
Not satisfied with everything.

529
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,910
And the colors all messed up.

530
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:43,910
Then do you want

531
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,310
to draw on another place?

532
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,800
Brat.

533
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,070
Is your hand shaking?

534
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,950
You’re shocked by my beauty?

535
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,800
I’m not.

536
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,920
It’s my first time to do this.

537
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,030
I have no experience.

538
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,280
Ji Siqi.

539
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:25,910
What?

540
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,430
You look smart,

541
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,470
but why do you always do things
that will make you feel bad?

542
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,750
What are you talking about?

543
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,270
You don’t want to know anything
about them.

544
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,910
Why do you have to draw their
intimate scenes?

545
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,150
Why are you so silly?

546
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,350
It’s my job.

547
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,030
You know it clearly whether

548
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,190
it is your job, or unrequited love.

549
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,430
I will go get some water.

550
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,670
Why are you escaping?

551
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,310
Get water?

552
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,590
You should find a better excuse.

553
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,510
I can do it myself.

554
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,590
Will you go to MC tomorrow?

555
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,200
There will be a book ordering fair.

556
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,270
The whole day will be busy.

557
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,590
Then, I can’t see you for a whole day?

558
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,230
It’s just one day.

559
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,670
24 hours.

560
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,230
1,440 minutes.

561
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,990
86,400 seconds.

562
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,910
Even one second…

563
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,510
How will you repay me?

564
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,110
What do you want?

565
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:38,710
Come here.

566
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,550
OK.

567
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:41,830
Give me a hug.

568
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,510
We should film this for Ji Qiu.

569
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,230
Why?

570
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,990
It’s for our comics.

571
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,670
I don’t know about the comics.

572
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,470
I’m doing this for myself.

573
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,150
And you

574
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,110
should also care more for yourself.

575
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,230
Don’t worry.

576
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,030
Siqi is not that weak.

577
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,590
Nothing will happen to him.

578
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,230
The key point is,

579
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,390
you should know what you should do.

580
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,070
Actually,

581
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,830
before I know Siqi…

582
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,830
Before I know this matter,

583
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,520
I think his talents

584
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,880
may be more shining

585
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,070
in some other places.

586
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,310
It’s a pity for him to work for me.

587
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,590
But now…

588
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,560
But now you know he likes you,

589
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,790
so it becomes complicated.

590
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,030
I think my reaction is so slow.

591
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,390
If Ji Qiu didn’t tell me today…

592
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,350
It’s okay to be slow to others.

593
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,230
You just need to be sensitive to me.

594
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,390
By the way,

595
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,590
about Ji Qiu,

596
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,390
I won’t let her come over again.

597
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,750
Why?

598
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,070
Because I have a girlfriend now.

599
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,350
When she is there,

600
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,710
it’s inconvenient for us to be close.

601
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,550
Wait for me.

602
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,950
I… I can do it myself.

603
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,230
Then, I’ll go now.

604
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:47,110
Do you forget something?

605
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,360
Just this?

606
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,310
Are you still a kid?

607
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,710
We will continue next time.

608
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:09,720
She… She…

609
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,710
She is your…

610
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,270
Fiancée.

611
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,400
Don’t you think Key’s style

612
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,950
is weird lately?

613
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,350
There is nothing wrong with his skills.

614
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,030
But it looks miserable.

615
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,440
Just like someone

616
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,710
forced him to do it.

617
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,510
The scald is also a big deal.

618
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,230
You’d better not draw lately.

619
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,270
I know if I can keep drawing.

620
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,630
Wait!

621
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,950
Are you kidding?

622
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,520
Now Qi Nian

623
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,600
can afford other drawers.

624
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,070
You don’t need to hold on to it.

625
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,030
What if you get sequela?

626
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:36,840
That’s between Qi Nian and me.

627
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:37,790
None of your business.

628
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,990
I think you get it wrong.

629
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,560
If you keep on drawing in this state,

630
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,280
you are just holding her back,

631
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,670
not helping her.

632
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,630
Can’t you realize it?

633
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,160
The story of Dress for the Beauty

634
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,750
is already a burden to you.

635
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,590
If you draw it in misery,

636
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,550
how could you make good comics?

637
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,430
Listen to me.

638
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,110
Go to submit your resignation.

639
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,960
If you keep doing this,

640
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,990
your hands will be ruined.

641
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,430
Have you done?

642
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,750
You’re not qualified to tell me these.

643
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,600
I’m doing this for you.

644
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,470
Don’t bother.

645
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,910
I’m just a toy for fun to you.

646
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,630
Don’t be so serious.

647
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,190
Ji Siqi!

648
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,110
Speak with your conscience!

649
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,720
I can go to others if I just want fun.

650
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,200
Why should I hang on to you?

651
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,200
Yeah.

652
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,360
I also want to ask you that.

653
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,200
Come on!

654
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,230
It’s because I like you!

655
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:33,670
Forget it.

656
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,310
Just take it as I said nothing.

657
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,510
You can do anything you want now.

658
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:47,830
Make it clear.

659
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,110
Is what you said true?

660
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,350
No.

661
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,670
And I said we slept together.

662
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,150
It’s also fake.

663
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,430
Congratulations.

664
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,270
From now on,

665
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,310
you’re free.

666
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,880
Both the girl

667
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,670
and the car are pretty.

668
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:24,450
Your girlfriend?

669
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,640
One couple is sweet

670
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,590
while another broke up.

671
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,230
The world is fair.

672
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,110
You’re back.

673
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,470
Why don’t you talk?

674
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:03,750
Nothing.

675
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,590
I just feel like

676
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:06,960
it’s been a long time

677
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,110
since I saw you last time.

678
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,430
Yeah.

679
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,990
We haven’t had dinner
together for a long time.

680
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,310
Do you want hot pot?

681
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,030
OK.

682
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,960
Why is it two-flavor?

683
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,800
You can have the spicy hot pot.

684
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,640
I’m okay with it.

685
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,790
How could you be okay?

686
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,640
Don’t you remember last time?

687
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,480
You spent the whole night in toilet.

688
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,550
Did you forget it?

689
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,000
It’s OK.

690
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,440
Now my stomach is trained.

691
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,520
Come on.

692
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,840
Last time when we ate in Ji’s house,

693
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,350
you couldn’t have any spicy food.

694
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,510
Siqi,

695
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,360
sometimes you don’t need to

696
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,510
force yourself.

697
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,160
What’s wrong?

698
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,160
It’s just a hot pot.

699
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,160
Don’t be so serious.

700
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,160
Two-flavor hot pot is OK.

701
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:48,960
I just don’t want things to be

702
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,950
so clear between us.

703
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,670
Sometimes it’s good to make it clear.

704
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,430
At least, no one will feel hard.

705
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,480
Siqi.

706
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,040
You always compromised to me

707
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,750
and considered for me.

708
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,080
Now it’s my time

709
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,430
to plan for you.

710
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,040
What happened to you today?

711
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,040
It’s just a hot pot.

712
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,230
Why are you talking about that?

713
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,560
Don’t forget that

714
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,560
you’re the chief author

715
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,440
and I’m your assistant.

716
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,520
I’m willing to compromise.

717
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,390
Why bother to make the plan?

718
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,670
What if I say I don’t want that?

719
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,200
You can stop working for

720
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,190
Dress for the Beauty now.

721
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,790
What…? Stop?

722
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,310
Is… Is there a new comic?

723
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,150
No.

724
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,830
I mean…

725
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,070
From tomorrow on,

726
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,110
we are not partners any more.

727
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,470
Our cooperation

728
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,590
will be over.

729
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:10,300
(Save it. We should never eat together.)

730
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,470
(Key is princess of light soup.
No spicy food.)

731
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,320
(I want to eat now.)

732
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:13,460
(Can you fry eggs without scallions?)

733
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,640
(No scallions, less salts, half sweet,
is that OK?)

734
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:15,780
(Save it. We should never eat together.)

735
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:22,100
(Yiyan Office)

736
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,600
The trading date of the whole project
has been advanced.

737
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,230
Relevant ones stay to work overtime.

738
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,030
Accompany wife?

739
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,430
What kind of reason is this?

740
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:31,750
I don’t allow.

741
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,190
Mr. Ji.

742
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:36,910
You’re back?

743
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,550
It’s all done, right?

744
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,510
It’s OK.

745
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,830
We can talk about it slowly.

746
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,640
Tell everyone

747
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,470
to cancel the overtime work.

748
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,310
Reason?

749
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:57,910
