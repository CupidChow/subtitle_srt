00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,010
Mr. Ji…

21
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,720
Why don’t you ask

22
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,170
why I am here?

23
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,360
If you had

24
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,440
a nightmare,

25
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,810
would you ask why?

26
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,570
How ungrateful you are!

27
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,760
I shouldn’t have promised the two

28
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,650
brothers.

29
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:01,640
Wait.

30
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,550
Brothers?

31
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,010
Who do you mean?

32
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,970
Ji Yanxin and Pei Siqi.

33
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,760
He didn’t even change his name.

34
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,970
So, he is Ji Siqi.

35
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,530
No way.

36
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,890
You have got tangled up with them.

37
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,410
But you don’t even know
their relationship?

38
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,290
What a fool.

39
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,890
What happened last night?

40
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,450
Why do you let go suddenly?

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,680
What are you

42
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,930
staring at…?

43
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,210
Qi Nian?

44
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,890
Why is she with you?

45
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,760
Let go.

46
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,840
Answer my question!

47
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,840
Why does he have to?

48
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,840
He is Qi Nian’s boss.

49
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,220
It’s normal for them to be together.

50
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,730
You know Qi Nian?

51
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,280
Of course.

52
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,040
We met last time.

53
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,850
You took her away in front of me.

54
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,770
Take her back to hotel.

55
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,770
I have some family affairs to deal with.

56
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,530
Family affairs?

57
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,930
He is my brother.

58
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,850
Let’s go.

59
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,160
What do you want to say?

60
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,330
We can settle them together.

61
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,650
What’s next?

62
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,310
Who knows?

63
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,720
Maybe they found a place

64
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,680
and had a fight.

65
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,720
I saw them come back with

66
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,730
many wounds.

67
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,680
Wait.

68
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,810
Are we close?

69
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,290
Why should I tell you that?

70
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,570
Why did they have a fight?

71
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,210
Me?

72
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,010
Stop pretending.

73
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,650
Who else could it be?

74
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,050
Can’t you tell that Ji Siqi likes…

75
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,830
What happened to your lips?

76
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:58,560
You got hurt?

77
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,610
Does it hurt?

78
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,330
Put your hand away.

79
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,720
It’s in the public.

80
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,570
What are you doing?

81
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,010
Mr. Ji, what happened to your hand?

82
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,850
It’s OK.

83
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,920
How could it be?

84
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,370
You got hurt!

85
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,800
Did you really

86
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,090
have a fight for me?

87
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,450
-Stop kidding!
-You think too much.

88
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,160
Bro. Bro.

89
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,520
New shop. It’s delicious.

90
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,450
Go to have a try if you get time.

91
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,050
Bye-bye.

92
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,250
Why did you stop?

93
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,650
Want a fight?

94
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,170
You came here for Qi Nian?

95
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,290
Yes. So what?

96
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,810
Why are you so obsessed with her?

97
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,930
You like her?

98
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,250
I… I want to ask you as well.

99
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,850
Why did you do that just now?

100
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,730
Don’t tell me it’s employee benefit.

101
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,570
You don’t need to know.

102
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,970
Alright.

103
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,010
Then keep a distance with her.

104
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,680
Don’t boss her in the name of work.

105
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,770
I’d love to.

106
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,490
You…!

107
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,650
What?

108
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,530
You want to beat your brother?

109
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,650
Have you ever won since childhood?

110
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,330
That was before.

111
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,770
You can have a try now.

112
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,050
What are you doing?

113
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,610
Look what time it is.

114
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,130
And you just threw these.

115
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,880
You can’t throw the recyclable things
everywhere.

116
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,010
Don’t you know garbage classification?

117
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,170
What are you waiting for?

118
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,330
Pick them up!

119
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,010
I… I…

120
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,640
Why am I always so unlucky?

121
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,970
What are all these?

122
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,120
Cut the crap.

123
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,530
Just finish this and go back.

124
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,360
It’s OK that you didn’t have a fight.

125
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,360
But, you are brothers.

126
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,290
Why haven’t you ever told me?

127
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,570
Is it an honored thing to have

128
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,210
a brother who ran away from home?

129
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,360
If I can,

130
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,240
I don’t want to have any relationship
with you either.

131
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,880
Alright. Move out from your place.

132
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,040
Is that your house?

133
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,240
Not only your house is mine,

134
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,450
but also your roommate is mine...

135
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,150
My assistant.

136
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,140
You always call her.

137
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,070
It will influence her work.

138
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,660
I don’t care.

139
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,860
Qi Nian is my partner.

140
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,630
We are together…

141
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,660
You’re also a cartoonist?

142
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,500
No. No. I am not.

143
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,540
I just have basic skills

144
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,870
and help Siqi as an assistant.

145
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,790
What’s wrong?

146
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,030
Nothing.

147
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,550
I just think this melon is sweet.

148
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,180
That’s to say, you two are not
in a relationship?

149
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,030
Of course not.

150
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,030
So when you said on the phone

151
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:25,900
that you would be responsible for him,

152
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,110
that’s just a slip of tongue?

153
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,260
That’s serious.

154
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,020
I meant to ask you

155
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,220
to give him to me.

156
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,020
So is it now.

157
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:32,790
No way.

158
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,060
Wait.

159
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:34,820
What rights do you have…

160
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,590
Shut up.

161
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,860
If it’s just a working relationship,

162
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:37,500
you can only choose one.

163
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,390
Who will you choose?

164
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,510
I will choose…

165
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,470
Wait.

166
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,340
Hello? Ji Qiu.

167
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,070
What’s up?

168
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:01,830
Grandpa…

169
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,270
Grandpa is…

170
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,310
Let me speak.

171
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,150
Ji.

172
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,470
You’d better come back now.

173
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,750
Something’s wrong with your grandpa.

174
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,700
(Outpatient)

175
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:28,990
Ji Qiu.

176
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,550
Yanxin, finally you are here.

177
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:34,950
What happened?

178
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,070
Is it serious?

179
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,350
Grandpa.

180
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,110
Grandpa.

181
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,150
It’s Siqi.

182
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,150
I’m back.

183
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,060
Grandpa, look at me.

184
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:06,790
Grandpa.

185
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,190
Grandpa.

186
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,140
Grandpa, it’s my fault.

187
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,350
Grandpa.

188
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,510
Grandpa.

189
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,790
Can you just be quiet?

190
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,910
You brat!

191
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,030
I…

192
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,290
You…

193
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,460
Grandpa, why don’t you say something
since you’re awake?

194
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,710
You scared me!

195
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,510
You heartless kid.

196
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,220
You haven’t come back for long.

197
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,830
What’s wrong with me bluffing you?

198
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,420
If you kept on wandering outside,

199
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,300
there would

200
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,110
only be a photo of me for you.

201
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,430
-Brat.
-Then…

202
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,060
Grandpa, how do you feel now?

203
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,030
Are you alright?

204
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,830
I’m OK.

205
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,590
You have grown so tall.

206
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,910
How long have you been back
from America?

207
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,390
Less than half a year.

208
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,310
You didn’t even inform me.

209
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,350
Do you have a place to live?

210
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,540
Yes.

211
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,180
Now I’m living…

212
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,070
Together with me.

213
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,190
Grandpa.

214
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,830
Don’t you two…

215
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,150
We made up.

216
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,110
There is no feud between brothers.

217
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,870
Siqi, right?

218
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,630
That’s good.

219
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,420
Without this troubling me,

220
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,870
it’s worth it for me

221
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,310
to do this surgery.

222
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,420
What surgery?

223
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,790
Grandpa, didn’t you say you’re fine?

224
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,150
Just cholecystitis.

225
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,620
It will be only a minor surgery.

226
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,470
It’s OK.

227
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,870
It’s not only cholecystitis.

228
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,710
No?

229
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,710
Then why did Grandpa lie to us?

230
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,230
I found

231
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,350
this in Grandpa’s drawer.

232
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,140
(Testament Ji Wenshan)

233
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,110
Test… Testament?

234
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,750
The sign-off date was last week.

235
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,110
If it’s just cholecystitis,

236
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,430
why should he make a will?

237
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,910
And,

238
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,790
shortly after he was diagnosed,

239
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,020
he spent a week calling his

240
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,790
old comrades one by one

241
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,150
and even arranging blind dates for me.

242
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,110
None of them works out.

243
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,940
Shut up.

244
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,830
Of course,

245
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,190
he cares more about Yanxin’s marriage.

246
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,460
But he has got Qi Nian.

247
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,820
Qi Nian doesn’t belong to him.

248
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,110
Don’t cut in.

249
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,380
Don’t you think it’s unusual

250
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,830
for Grandpa to do all this?

251
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,550
If it’s just a minor illness,

252
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,470
why is he making such a fuss about it?

253
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,110
You… You mean…

254
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,170
It’s cancer.

255
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:08,030
Ji Qiu.

256
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,740
You can’t talk nonsense about this.

257
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,350
It’s true.

258
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,350
I heard it by my own ears.

259
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,340
I want to ask

260
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,820
if I’m diagnosed with

261
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,670
malignant tumor during
the insurance period,

262
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,430
is it covered by the insurance?

263
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,470
The beneficiaries are my grandchildren.

264
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:32,980
OK. OK.

265
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,510
Thanks. Thank you.

266
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:40,820
Grandpa must have been worried about us.

267
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,790
So he came to do the surgery
after he arranged everything well.

268
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,550
But he still lied to us

269
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,990
that it’s a minor illness.

270
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,430
Don’t be so sure.

271
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,790
Wait till your cousin talks
to the doctor.

272
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,590
How is it?

273
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,390
Is it cholecystitis or not?

274
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,270
It’s really cancer?

275
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,740
That’s why you lied to Grandpa

276
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,910
that we made up?

277
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,580
I hope he can go to

278
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,990
take the surgery without worries.

279
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,110
Even if it’s fake,

280
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,030
you have to pretend with me.

281
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,790
Understand?

282
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,630
So,

283
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,150
what should I do?

284
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:55,990
Qi Nian,

285
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,310
my proposal to you

286
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,550
is serious.

287
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,510
Consider about it.

288
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,350
Siqi,

289
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:24,860
this is Mr. Ji’s house.

290
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,700
Why are you here?

291
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,780
Don’t ask me.

292
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,870
Or kill me.

293
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:29,620
If you want me to be alive,

294
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,590
then follow me.

295
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,790
I have only one requirement.

296
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,030
In case that I will commit murder here,

297
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,230
Qi Nian has to live together with us.

298
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:52,950
I agree, reluctantly.

299
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,230
But it depends on your performance next.

300
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,700
It’s just living in one house together.

301
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,270
It’s not like we haven’t lived together.

302
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,830
It’s the best if we can be like before.

303
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,630
You think we can be like before?

304
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,470
There are some things
that can’t be forced.

305
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,750
How will you know if you don’t try?

306
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,610
It hurts!

307
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,350
Ji Yanxin! You did this on purpose!

308
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,040
(You have to behave
since you are in my place)

309
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:35,830
(Younger brother obeys elder brother
Eat and sleep together)

310
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,720
(Come and go together
One heart and one mind)

311
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:37,240
(What does this mean?)

312
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,060
(Absolute obedience to your brother)

313
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,180
Is it necessary for you two
to make the distance so clear?

314
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,110
Of course.

315
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,020
It matters to see if two people

316
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,150
can get along well.

317
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,590
The sweet guy is easygoing.

318
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,990
The salty guy is just
a false proposition.

319
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,190
Where do you get the conclusion from?

320
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,430
Isn’t it?

321
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,820
People who like sweets

322
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,500
can have hundreds of grams of sugar
at a time.

323
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,780
But if you like salty food,

324
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,270
can you eat that much salt at a time?

325
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,380
People who turn to sugar

326
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,380
simply have poor self-control

327
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,490
and weak will.

328
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:15,550
There is nothing to be proud of.

329
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,500
Alright. Alright.

330
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,020
Here.

331
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,310
Have the rice first.

332
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,580
I don’t eat green onion.

333
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,950
Then let me pick them out.

334
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,820
He doesn’t eat egg or rice, either.

335
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,030
Pick them all out for him.

336
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,190
You…!

337
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,230
What?

338
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,190
Have a walk.

339
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,550
Time to promote our relationship.

340
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,860
Sorry,

341
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,460
I’ll never want to be close to you.

342
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,380
Then, Grandpa…

343
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:42,980
Alright, alright.

344
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,230
I see. I got it.

345
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,710
Just walk the dog, right?

346
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,190
Wait.

347
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,150
Your job is to pick up its poops.

348
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,950
Qi Bao, let’s go.

349
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:19,950
So tired.

350
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,510
I just moved in a few days ago.

351
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,430
It feels like hundreds of years.

352
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,620
What are you waiting for?

353
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,910
Keep on stamping.

354
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,860
I’m so tired!

355
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,260
You can only bear it.

356
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,580
The washing machine is being repaired.

357
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,390
We got a lot of clothes to wash now.

358
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,940
I mean I feel tired inside.

359
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,610
It’s only been a few years,

360
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:44,540
and my brother’s troubles

361
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,430
have multiplied exponentially.

362
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,190
How did you get along with him?

363
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,540
Look at his face when you are angry.

364
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,940
Look at his eyes when you are confused.

365
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,460
Look at his body when you are upset.

366
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,470
Look at his ears when you feel annoyed.

367
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,180
Superficial woman.

368
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,260
He looks great, so what?

369
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,750
I do the same for you.

370
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,270
Siqi,

371
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,700
I have a question.

372
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,550
Don’t ask.

373
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,150
Keep it in your mind forever.

374
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,270
Alright.

375
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,310
We were not like this before.

376
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,110
He used

377
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,630
to be the one who loved me the most.

378
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:38,020
A Happy Excursion. Chuang Tzu.

379
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,550
My parents have been very strict

380
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,750
with my brother since I can remember.

381
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,700
The most impressions he left me

382
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,110
are the view of his back when he was
studying hard in the study room.

383
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,180
He had endless classes every day,

384
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,860
could not have his own hobbies.

385
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,270
And he should listen to Father
in every matter.

386
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,470
But these didn’t affect our relationship

387
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,150
and he was always nice to me.

388
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,710
But everything changed in the year

389
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,470
when I was 12.

390
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,950
What happened?

391
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,830
Our parents divorced when I was young,

392
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,090
my mother went to America alone

393
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:12,770
and my father disappeared.

394
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:13,830
That year,

395
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,750
I moved to Grandpa’s house.

396
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,020
When I saw my brother again,

397
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:18,940
he did a complete

398
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,470
change on his attitude towards me

399
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,780
and began to control me the way Dad did.

400
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,500
He was just extremely

401
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,510
strict with me.

402
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,140
And he even wanted me to
follow in his footsteps.

403
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,630
Of course I wouldn’t say yes.

404
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,150
So we often had fights.

405
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,670
And then…

406
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,270
Then what?

407
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,590
Later, some things happened,

408
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,310
I had a big fight with him

409
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,150
and I went to America to my mom.

410
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,270
Alas.

411
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,470
What’s wrong?

412
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,380
I know what you are thinking about.

413
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,710
You’d better not do that.

414
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,620
You can’t help with the problem

415
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,910
between my brother and me.

416
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,550
But maybe

417
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,430
your brother also regrets it.

418
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,790
Save it.

419
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,500
My brother has been a loner
since he was a child,

420
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,590
and he never opens his heart to anyone.

421
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,550
The best way to know his feeling

422
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,390
is to leave him.

423
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,180
Where are you going?

424
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,950
A place where I can’t see Ji Yanxin.

425
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,710
Why is he so angry today?

426
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,790
I wonder what day it is today.

427
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,910
His birthday.

428
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,390
It’s Siqi’s birthday?

429
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,270
Then let’s make a party for him.

430
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,390
You better not.

431
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:38,940
Why?

432
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,700
Isn’t this

433
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,550
a good chance to draw you close?

434
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,550
He may not want to spend it with me.

435
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,830
But maybe it’s different

436
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,470
if it’s you.

437
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:56,020
(Birthday)

438
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,590
It’s you.

439
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,940
Excuse me, I want this one.

440
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:00,820
Thank you.

441
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:01,180
OK.

442
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,110
I’ll pack it up now.

443
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,420
This cake is so cute!

444
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,710
Buy me this, OK?

445
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:05,910
Alright. Alright.

446
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:06,740
You heard her?

447
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,510
We want this.

448
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,500
But,

449
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,750
this gentleman…

450
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,470
Ji…

451
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,830
Ji Siqi?

452
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:15,980
Sorry,

453
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:16,950
I don’t want it now.

454
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,470
Ji Siqi!

455
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,870
Don’t go!

456
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,260
I’m not here to get even with you.

457
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,110
Why so scared?

458
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,670
After all these years,

459
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,430
you haven’t changed a little.

460
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,340
How do you think about that game?

461
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,230
Just so-so.

462
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,750
It’s great!

463
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,020
-Isn’t this the top scholar in our class?
-Top scholar!

464
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:39,540
Right?

465
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,220
Yeah.

466
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:40,950
Sorry

467
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,350
to disturb you while studying.

468
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,390
I’m talking to you.

469
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:53,980
Let me see

470
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,820
what book you are learning.

471
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:56,750
This is…

472
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:03,910
You’ve got some strength.

473
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,510
Go back and peck for a few more years.

474
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:18,870
Are you alright?

475
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,150
The orphan is really arrogant.

476
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,310
It seems that not only your father

477
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,550
but also your brother hasn’t come
to see you for half a year.

478
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,350
Did he run away like your father?

479
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,870
Yeah. Did he?

480
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,230
Do you think you’re really handsome?

481
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,830
I was so beaten up by you.

482
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,470
Even if you were kicked out
of school later,

483
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,150
I still haven’t got over it yet.

484
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,150
Alright.

485
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,750
You want a fight again?

486
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:52,860
This time I promise

487
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,310
I will make you satisfied.

488
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,470
Ji Siqi,

489
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,110
do you have any manners?

490
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,030
Look how you are like a loser.

491
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,750
You’re not living well now, right?

492
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,180
Your… Your… Where is your brother?

493
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,790
Why didn’t he help you?

494
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,940
I wonder what takes you so long

495
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:13,790
to buy a cake.

496
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,590
Turns out you met a friend.

497
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,190
Hello.

498
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,270
Did I interrupt your chat?

499
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,270
No. No.

500
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,260
But… Wait.

501
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,350
You… You two…

502
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:24,830
Can’t you tell?

503
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,810
Sorry, I didn’t make it obvious.

504
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:29,310
It’s all because

505
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,510
my Siqi is too shy.

506
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,220
You…

507
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,750
He is spoiled by me.

508
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,820
He always forgets to wear suit.

509
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,190
What are you doing?

510
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,070
We still have other things to do.

511
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,910
So, please…

512
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,070
Let’s go.

513
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,070
Go!

514
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,870
You… What is all this?

515
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,430
Don’t you understand?

516
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,510
It’s really a waste of my kindness.

517
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,620
What’s wrong with you?

518
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,580
Why do you slap me?

519
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,710
You’re so stupid!

520
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,950
I should have slapped you
to wake you up.

521
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,380
You just looked at him

522
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,550
like boy crazy as well!

523
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,300
He is more handsome than you!

524
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,350
He looks a hundred times better
in anything than you do.

525
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:12,950
Wait!

526
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,870
For superficial people,

527
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,340
it’s faster to win them

528
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,910
with pretty faces than to use fists.

529
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,420
Your face

530
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,980
is your weapon, boy.

531
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:23,710
Hands off.

532
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,590
Sir, your cake is ready.

533
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,270
Thank you.

534
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,210
Here you are.

535
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:35,230
Happy birthday.

536
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,470
How do you know it?

537
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,860
You almost became my employee.

538
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,150
All your information is here.

539
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,910
Don’t you really want to join Rongpin?

540
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,700
With your talents,

541
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,310
it’s a waste of you to be in MC.

542
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,750
You should forget it.

543
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,030
What’s more,

544
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,110
I have never celebrated my birthday
since I was 16.

545
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,030
But, thanks for helping me just now.

546
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,530
I will finish the cake.

547
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:58,830
But I won’t leave MC.

548
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,350
Brat.

549
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,830
So stubborn.

550
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,460
Ji… Mr. Ji.

551
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:31,980
I’m sorry.

552
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,670
I… I didn’t want to…

553
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,750
What’s wrong?

554
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,220
Do you know

555
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,820
that Qi Bao’s favorite activity is to

556
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:39,790
step on the sheet?

557
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,750
If you don’t want to wash it again,

558
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,030
then just keep quiet.

559
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,060
If you move,

560
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,750
its dirty feet will step on.

561
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:00,260
Then we should

562
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,390
keep on being like this?

563
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,390
What else?

564
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,430
I have no other choices.

565
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,950
Mr. Ji,

566
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:17,550
did you have coffee this morning?

567
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,470
Your heart is beating…

568
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,150
Fast.

569
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:22,750
Yes.

570
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,350
Qi Bao!

571
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,510
Qi Bao, you’re so heavy!

572
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,190
Anyone at home?

573
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,710
Birthday cake delivery.

574
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:52,460
(Delicious Bread Without Additive)

575
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,990
Didn’t you say you won’t celebrate
his birthday?

576
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,780
Here is the cake.

577
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,420
Now we need birthday noodles.

578
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,590
Don’t even try.

579
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,540
I don’t know how to make it.

580
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,430
Search it on Internet yourself.

I thought kneading dough was

588
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,750
a self-taught thing.

589
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,580
The only self-taught thing to me

590
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,740
is to love you.

591
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,830
I need guidance on other things.

592
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:12,710
Where is the apron?

593
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,110

It’s sticky.

609
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,990
Is this a dough or paste?

610
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,980
I don’t know.

611
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:10,900
What to do now?

612
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,350
Can the noodles made by this be eaten?

613
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,900
If it’s made by you,

614
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,270
Siqi might be happy.

615
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,150
Mr. Ji,

616
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,990
I think sometimes you should let him

617
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,900
know how you love him.

618
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,060
Actually we all think

619
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,630
that we know our relatives most,

620
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,150
but there are many things
we can’t speak out.

621
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,660
We are just waiting for the other

622
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,910
to make the first step.

623
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,420
One small step forward,

624
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:52,190
one giant leap for civilization.

625
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,300
Wipe your face

626
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,500
and wait by the side.

627
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:57,900
I’ll make it.

628
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,670
You can just help me.

629
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:37,270
Hope Yanxin could know
what happened at school later.

630
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,670
Yanxin, you’re back.

631
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,470
Of course I have to come back.

632
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,430
The school even called my office.

633
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,830
Yes. I beat him first.

634
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,030
But

635
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,060
he provoked me first. It’s not my fault.

636
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,110
The school won’t care about that.

637
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,550
The problem is that you had a fight

638
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,030
with four people.

639
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:05,540
Do you really think that you won’t get

640
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:06,180
kicked out as long as you
get good grades?

641
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,670
Then I can just quit.

642
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,380
I only want to be a cartoonist.

643
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,940
I can’t learn anything there.

644
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:11,700
What did you promise me

645
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,470
when Mom and Dad divorced?

646
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,230
Yes,

647
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,670
I promised you that I would behave.

648
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,670
But it doesn’t mean I should obey
all your orders.

649
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:20,940
I don’t want to learn management

650
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,340
or architecture.

651
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,980
How could you arrange everything for me?

652
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,590
Then you think
it’s right to stay at home?

653
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,540
There won’t be any pressure

654
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,900
if you run away from school?

655
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:28,980
You take the excuse of being cartoonist

656
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,830
just because you’re not happy at school?

657
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:31,820
I’m not happy

658
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:32,710
because of our family!

659
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,100
Dad has left the two of us alone.

660
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,900
Why do you bother to care about me?

661
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,070
Ji Siqi, listen carefully.

662
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,790
Whether Mom and Dad left us or not

663
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,390
and whatever people say,

664
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,350
you just need to do what I ask you to

665
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,620
and don’t care about other things.

666
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,270
I won’t!

667
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,020
This is how Father did to you!

668
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:49,990
What’s the result?

669
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,140
You repeated Dad’s way of education

670
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,420
just to use me to find yourself back

671
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,660
the sense of security!

672
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,390
Shut up!

673
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:01,870
Let me ask you one last time.

674
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:03,950
Will you go back to the school?

675
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,190
I won’t!

676
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,510
Looks like you’ve been in the
greenhouse for too long.

677
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,030
What are you going to do?

678
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,710
Ji Yanxin!

679
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,860
(Thanks for buying our birthday cake.
Wish you a happy birthday!)

680
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,390
So annoying.

681
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:05,580
I will be angry at whoever

682
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:06,510
mentions my birthday again.

683
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,750
Happy birthday! Key!

684
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:20,780
Come on.

685
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:21,940
Come on in.

686
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:22,900
Let me show you around.

687
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,110
Here we go.

688
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:29,860
(Happy Birthday)

689
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,270
Siqi, what’s wrong?

690
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,390
These…

691
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,670
You prepared all these?

692
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,660
I also made you birthday noodles.

693
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:41,630
I will cook it later.

694
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:42,990
Wait a moment.

695
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,470
Put this one first. Come on.

696
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,590
You look pretty!

697
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:52,750
Qi Nian.

698
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:56,670
Actually, I don’t like to
celebrate birthday.

699
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,270
Why?

700
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:03,390
Because there are some bad memories.

701
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,220
But it I can celebrate it with you,

702
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,310
maybe it will be different.

703
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:09,630
It’s the same.

704
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,310
What?

705
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,140
Nothing.

706
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,110
I just want you to be happy.

707
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,420
You don’t know

708
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,380
that it spent my whole afternoon

709
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,900
to prepare all these.

710
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,140
It’s to tiring to make birthday noodles.

711
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,500
Come on. Have a seat first.

712
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,710
Luckily, I got your brother to help me.

713
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:26,990
My brother?

714
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:32,550
These are also made by him?

715
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,350
He didn’t want me to tell you.

716
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,500
But he helped me with the

717
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:40,260
decoration, cake and noodles.

718
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,030
And…

719
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:42,230
This.

720
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,950
This is his present for you.

721
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,230
What’s this?

722
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,750
I mean, what does he mean?

723
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,270
He wants to piss me off on my birthday
again, right?

724
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:08,390
On my sixteenth birthday,

725
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,820
he messed up

726
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,870
all my stuff.

727
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,630
And now he wants to wipe out

728
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,150
the memory with only one present?

729
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,700
But your brother really worked hard

730
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,500
to try to make it up to you.

731
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,590
Make it up?

732
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,950
Where is the apology?

733
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:25,420
I think he never

734
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,110
feels guilty in his mind.

735
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,830
Sorry, Qi Nian.

736
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,830
I know you mean well.

737
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,630
But I’m not in that mood now.

738
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,350
Please tell him

739
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,620
that after Grandpa’s surgery tomorrow,

740
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,710
I will move out.

741
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,590
I have had enough of
the drama of brothers.

742
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:50,670
