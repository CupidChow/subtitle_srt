Where are the guys I asked for?

21
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,720
Coming.

22
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,960
A truck of male models

23
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,990
are coming to us.

24
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,110
Who told you to get male models?

25
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,000
What if Qi Nian really has a crush

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,710
on someone?

27
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,120
Can’t you just find some ugly guys

28
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,990
from the street?

29
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,310
Come on.

30
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,230
Are you expecting a party
or helping poor guys?

31
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,840
Who helps a couple like this?

32
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,790
You don’t understand!

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You know what?

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,280
I never believe

35
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,270
my cousin has turned into a jerk.

36
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,920
He’s possessive about Qi Nian.

37
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,880
Believe it or not?

38
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,040
When I post some photos

39
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,880
of Qi Nian and other men,

40
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,110
he will fly back in no time!

41
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,480
Turns out

42
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,550
you have some good ideas.

43
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,560
Don’t you think

44
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,710
male models work better for this plan?

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,030
Well, what did I say?

46
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,000
You’re old, pure

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,510
and simple-minded.

48
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,360
This is a double-sided plan.

49
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,760
For my cousin,

50
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,510
and also for Qi Nian.

51
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,150
I want her to realize
how cruel the reality is.

52
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,960
She will not meet

53
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,840
another precious Burberry man

54
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,430
like my cousin.

55
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,150
She’ll always regret if she loses him!

56
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,590
Come on.

57
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,440
Maybe she meets a Gucci man

58
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,470
somewhere in the corner.

59
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,510
Right?

60
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,400
Are you alright?

61
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,070
Yes.

62
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:24,950
Qi Nian?

63
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,710
You are?

64
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,150
Oh, it’s really you, Qi Nian.

65
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,630
It’s me, Jin Xianyu.

66
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,190
You’re Qi Nian
from Class 4, Grade 1, right?

67
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,320
Hello, senior.

68
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,310
What do you want me for?

69
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,280
In the school art show,

70
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,520
a portrait won the first prize.

71
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,270
You drew that?

72
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,510
I understand what you mean.

73
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,110
We can have a try.

74
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,840
Theoretically,

75
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,320
I don’t consider ordinary girls

76
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,590
like you.

77
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,360
But for the sake

78
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,630
of your love for me,

79
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,560
you’ll have a fair chance to woo me.

80
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,600
But wait... wait.

81
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,830
What do you mean by my love for you?

82
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,040
You drew me secretly.

83
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,430
And you even showed it in the art show.

84
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,190
That was showing off.

85
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,550
It’s okay for you to love me.

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,070
But you should keep a low profile.

87
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,830
This is my father.

88
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,720
I drew my father

89
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,190
when he was young.

90
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,520
Senior, do you think

91
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,670
you look like the young him?

92
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,270
It doesn’t matter.

93
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,880
Girls don’t dare to admit their feelings

94
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,230
because they’re shy.

95
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,670
Well, I’ll do it, then.

96
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,350
Qi Nian.

97
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,870
I like you.

98
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,310
Be my girlfriend.

99
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,190
Don’t you remember?

100
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,000
You confessed your love to me.

101
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,830
When we were in high school.

102
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,080
I didn’t confess to you.

103
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,510
You confessed your love to me.

104
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But the next day,

105
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,590
you were in a relationship
with the school babe.

106
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,350
You didn’t agree
to be my girlfriend back then.

107
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,590
I wouldn’t put all my eggs
in one basket.

108
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,600
Okay. I see.

109
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,160
Well, nice to meet you again,

110
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,790
senior.

111
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,430
I think he’s over there.

112
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:13,910
He’s here.

113
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,790
Don’t run!

114
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,120
Yu!

115
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,310
Yu!

116
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,080
Is anyone around Mangrove KTV?

117
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,430
Someone saw Yu nearby.

118
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,320
Really?

119
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,030
(Go have a look.)
Go have a look.

120
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,830
Mangrove KTV?

121
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,670
Here, isn’t it?

122
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,840
Don’t ask me why.

123
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,230
I don’t know, either.

124
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,270
All right.

125
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,160
This is a VIP room.

126
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,160
They can’t follow us.

127
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,830
They are...?

128
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,150
My fans.

129
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,950
You have no idea, huh?

130
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,470
Now, I am...

131
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,950
Yu?

132
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,070
You’re... You’re Jin Xianyu of XZONE?

133
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,510
Gosh!

134
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,830
I saw you alive, at last.

135
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,870
He wasn’t dead before.

136
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,360
Yu.

137
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,870
I really adore you.

138
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,720
Since your debut,

139
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,160
I’ve been your fan.

140
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,000
I like no other member of your band,

141
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,190
but you.

142
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,390
I even went to your debut.

143
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,030
Thank you for your support.

144
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:38,790
She’s your friend?

145
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,430
Good, then.

146
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,680
My friend and I have a VIP room here.

147
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,120
Join us if you’d love to.

148
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,070
We don’t...

149
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,560
We’d love to.

150
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,310
We’re happy to join you.

151
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,070
Come on, then.

152
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,910
Didn’t you say we needed a party
with ordinary guys?

153
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,680
Forget about those ordinary guys

154
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,870
in your mind.

155
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,280
We’re having a party

156
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,430
with my idol.

157
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,480
Stay with me

158
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,950
and let the fans envy us.

159
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,510
Come on. Let’s go.

160
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:17,100
(RP Welcome meeting)

161
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,550
Cheers.

162
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,080
Long time no see.

163
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,600
This one tastes delicious.

164
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,360
Yummy.

165
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,110
Long time no see.

166
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:32,920
Yeah.

167
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,160
This one tastes delicious, too.

168
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,030
Yeah.

169
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,200
I’m busy, anyway.

170
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:36,870
Go. Come and have a look.

171
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,160
Do you like the dishes?

172
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,720
Miss Lu, cheers.

173
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:41,660
Cheers.

174
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:42,190
Okay.

175
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,520
Work hard

176
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,160
and help the newcomers.

177
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,720
You look gorgeous.

178
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,710
Thank you.

179
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,120
Enjoy yourselves.

180
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,830
Okay.

181
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:48,910
Thank you, Miss Lu.

182
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,960
Why didn’t Lu Qingwu

183
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,110
come to us?

184
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,080
We’re new employees.

185
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,990
I’m new here. I’m Ji Siqi.

186
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,990
Lu Qingwu will not care for us.

187
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,270
She’s always a social climber.

188
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,320
I don’t think so.

189
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,680
I heard Lu Qingwu likes

190
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,670
young men.

191
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,070
All good-looking young men

192
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,280
feel just like a fish in water

193
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,800
in front of her.

194
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,950
She spoils them as far as she can.

195
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,920
No wonder it’s said

196
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,480
that Lu Qingwu is the best springboard
for male cartoonists.

197
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,040
If only I could be her assistant!

198
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,880
Come on. Look at you.

199
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,160
I’m skilled, okay?

200
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,670
Fine. Fine. You’re skilled.

201
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,280
Are you done yet?

202
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,040
What?

203
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,240
You foul mouth!

204
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,510
How dared you slander her!

205
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,760
Why did you beat him?

206
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,400
Why did you?

207
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,310
So what?

208
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,200
-What’s wrong?
-Stop fighting!

209
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,000
Stop fighting! Stop fighting!

210
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,640
Let go!

211
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,400
Take it easy!

212
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:35,600
You...

213
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,000
Are you nuts?

214
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,560
Take it easy!

215
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,160
You... you...

216
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:37,950
Let go!

217
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,230
What are you doing
on the first day to work?

218
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,030
None of your business.

219
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,550
You said we were strangers, didn’t you?

220
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,240
Don’t bother when they gossip.

221
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,320
I don’t care.

222
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,190
I do! OK?

223
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,510
What’s wrong with him?

224
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,720
♪I wish to be with you♪

225
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,600
Come on. Cheers.

226
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,030
Come on.

227
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,070
I can’t drink more.

228
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,840
One more song!

229
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,830
Sounds great!

230
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,990
Shao Zui. Shao Zui. Shao Zui.

231
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,480
I’m singing with my idol!

232
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,350
I’ll die without any regrets!

233
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,590
Don’t get too close.

234
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,030
Or when you see him through,

235
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,670
no one will help you.

236
00:09:59,520 --> 00:09:59,950
Get away!

237
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,400
He sings so beautifully!

238
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,030
What good luck!

239
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,130
Dress for the Beauty?

240
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,950
Why are you reading this now?

241
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,030
Reviewing.

242
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,240
Reviewing...

243
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,880
what?

244
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,400
Love.

245
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,710
I’m looking for evidence
that he loves me.

246
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,520
Seriously?

247
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,270
You’re still thinking about that?

248
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,520
Sounds great!

249
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,310
Thank you.

250
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,920
Awesome!

251
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,440
Yu.

252
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,670
You’re a walking jukebox.

253
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,880
Do all idols like you

254
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,350
sing so beautifully?

255
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,830
Sounds wonderful!

256
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,230
Cheers. Cheers.

257
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,150
I wanted to ask.

258
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,270
What happened to her?

259
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,440
What else could happen?

260
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,430
She’s just crossed in love.

261
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,750
You mean I’ve got a chance?

262
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,360
You have no idea.

263
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,040
When Qi Nian and I were in senior high,

264
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,760
we were nearly in a relationship.

265
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,600
Not nearly.

266
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,990
But barely.

267
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,360
From now on,

268
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,920
I’ll make it up for you.

269
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,590
What do you think?

270
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Don’t joke with me.

271
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,070
Just sit down.

272
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,070
I joked.

273
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,870
But I only joke with you.

274
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,240
It’s been years.

275
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,670
But you’ve never changed.

276
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,480
Senior,

277
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,520
when I was in senior high,

278
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,990
did I have long hair or short hair?

279
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,760
See?

280
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,990
You don’t remember clearly.

281
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,390
Qi Nian.

282
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,960
I think

283
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,400
you misunderstood me.

284
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,560
Yes, I did.

285
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,070
I thought you were loyal.

286
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,270
I...

287
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,990
You’re Yu’s fan?

288
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,800
But seems like

289
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,390
he likes your friend better.

290
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,880
So, he likes girls

291
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,990
of Qi Nian’s type?

292
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,470
Not really.

293
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,150
It’s just a necessary procedure.

294
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,430
You don’t need to wait for your friend.

295
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,430
What do you mean?

296
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,750
What’s wrong?

297
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,550
I can’t find it.

298
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,070
What is it?

299
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,640
A reason why he likes me.

300
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,760
From the very beginning,

301
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,830
I can’t find any.

302
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,630
Instead, he’s more likely to use me.

303
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,520
If you think this way,

304
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,470
you’re cheated, then.

305
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,160
But up to now,

306
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,910
I still want to believe he likes me.

307
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,070
Do you think I’m hopeless?

308
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,200
Do you know what I usually do

309
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,200
at this kind of moment?

310
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:02,830
What?

311
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,150
Leave it to destiny.

312
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,240
Get back to him if it’s the head.

313
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,430
Give up if it’s the tail.

314
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,390
Head or tail?

315
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,030
Want to know?

316
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,270
Come with me.

317
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,200
Lu Qingwu is a bad girl.

318
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,590
Ungrateful idiot!

319
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,470
Bad girl! Idiot!

320
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,830
There you are.

321
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,790
I was looking for you.

322
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,430
Let me have a look.

323
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,910
Luckily, your face isn’t hurt.

324
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,670
Or I’ll teach them a lesson!

325
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,470
Thank you for helping me.

326
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,080
I know

327
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,110
I don’t look like a loyal girl.

328
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,830
I never want to show how loyal I am.

329
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,510
But I lied

330
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:12,990
when I said I didn’t care.

331
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,110
When you’re on my side,

332
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,870
I’m really moved.

333
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:20,830
So,

334
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,070
I would like to take back my words.

335
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,430
Does your confession still work?

336
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,190
It doesn’t, right?

337
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,110
Fine, I see.

338
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,000
Don’t go. It still works.

339
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,190
What’s wrong with your voice?

340
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,230
Stop laughing!

341
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,600
Stop laughing!

342
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,830
Sounds silly.

343
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,470
What are you doing?

344
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,240
Bastard!

345
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,350
I’ll beat you up!

346
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,470
Idiot! Idiot!

347
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,760
Can you tell me the answer now?

348
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,390
Fine.

349
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,390
Let me tell you

350
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,670
what the destiny has chosen for you.

351
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,230
You will

352
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,310
choose me.

353
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,230
Stop struggling.

354
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,120
Fate has chosen the best choice

355
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,350
for you.

356
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,400
You’ll be in a relationship

357
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,070
with an idol like me.

358
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,230
Isn’t it your destiny?

359
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,040
I don’t know about destiny.

360
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,920
I just know

361
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,680
if you keep holding my hand,

362
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,910
you’ll be sorry.

363
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,160
How could I trust you?

364
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,830
I was clutching at straws.

365
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,110
Wait!

366
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,080
The coin is gone.

367
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,350
But I know the result.

368
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,430
Do you want me to tell you?

369
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,830
No.

370
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,800
The coin in my heart

371
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,910
has told me the result.

372
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,240
Tossing up the coin

373
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,600
can be naive.

374
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,560
It only helps us

375
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,710
to know what we really want.

376
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,710
Thank you, anyway,

377
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,600
for making me know

378
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,190
what I really want.

379
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,030
I’ll leave you alone.

380
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,070
Don’t go.

381
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,600
I’m a popular idol.

382
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,830
But I talk humbly to you.

383
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,510
Aren’t you moved?

384
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,600
A lot of fans downstairs
want to be my girlfriend,

385
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,710
including your friend.

386
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,190
Don’t you cherish me?

387
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,950
The subscriber you dialed is busy.

388
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,110
Please redial later.

389
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,640
What’s wrong with her?

390
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,630
She’s lost when chasing her idol?

391
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,230
Can she be forced to drink?

392
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,630
How much did you drink?

393
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,270
Half as much as the wine here.

394
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,030
I didn’t know

395
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,910
you could drink so much.

396
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,510
I didn’t know
wine would taste so terrible

397
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,310
until today.

398
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,670
And it didn’t work at all.

399
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,670
What happened?

400
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,710
If only I could lose my memory!

401
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,790
Why did I ask for his skeletons
in the closet?

402
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:46,750
You know what?

403
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,520
Jin Xianyu is a narcissist.

404
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,040
He’s a cheap guy collecting girlfriends.

405
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,640
He treats fans differently.

406
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,040
He only accepts luxurious gifts.

407
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,920
He loves to instigate his fans
to slander his opponents.

408
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,320
He pretends to be friendly,

409
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,230
but grabs resources behind his friends.

410
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,430
Are you no longer his fan?

411
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,110
Sure.

412
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,350
Or what do I need him for?

413
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,070
Your time and feelings for him

414
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,950
can be wasted.

415
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,110
From today on,

416
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,000
I’ll focus on my career.

417
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,670
Good. You’re a potential girl.

418
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,350
After you come to work,

419
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,670
I’ll promote you.

420
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:24,910
How?

421
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,030
Make you my private drinking partner

422
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,910
who can drink for me.

423
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,480
You have my phone number

424
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,440
and you’ve friended me on WeChat.

425
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,560
Is it enough?

426
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,390
One more thing.

427
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,960
You said

428
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,080
I helped you

429
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,240
to know

430
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,190
what you really wanted.

431
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,830
I want a reward.

432
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,470
It’s reasonable, isn’t it?

433
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,510
What do you want?

434
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,350
Tell me you like me.

435
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,080
No way.

436
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:56,510
Well.

437
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,320
Let me tell you a way

438
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,320
to test a man’s true heart,

439
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,110
in exchange.

440
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,550
Is it true?

441
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,110
Try and you’ll know.

442
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,510
Fine. Your turn.

443
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,670
I’m not...

444
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,030
a good man.

445
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:25,600
But at least,

446
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,030
I did one right thing,

447
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,590
to confess my love to you.

448
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,870
Jin Xianyu, I...

449
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,030
Qi Nian?

450
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,790
Qi Nian?

451
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,160
Doomed. Qi Nian!

452
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,400
She was taken away

453
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,110
by Jin Xianyu!

454
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:54,910
Sit down.

455
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,070
What are you worried about?

456
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,030
Someone will stop him.

457
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,190
After all,

458
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:04,600
she is the girl

459
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,750
he cares most for.

460
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:18,780
(Shao Zui)

461
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:29,370
Hello?

462
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,710
How are you doing lately?

463
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,080
Abstinent boy

464
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:33,990
who travels far because of love.

465
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,030
The confinement works, doesn’t it?

466
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,150
Don’t hang up.

467
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,040
Don’t you want to know

468
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,150
how Qi Nian is doing?

469
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,590
No.

470
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,430
You said no, but you meant yes.

471
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:59,620
(Newest photos of Qi Nian.
Clue: the 7th rule of the Ji family)

472
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:06,420
(No sex before getting married)

473
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,220
(Photo of Qi Nian)

474
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,900
(Haw-haw, I knew you would open it.
If you want to see her, come back.)

475
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:14,910
Wait.

476
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,400
Isn’t my cousin in America?

477
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,200
He went there.

478
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,670
But he can come back.

479
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,800
Also, the reason why he left

480
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,630
is no longer reasonable.

481
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,960
I didn’t expect

482
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,790
to see wine in your place.

483
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,350
It’s not for me.

484
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,720
I don’t know

485
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,070
when she’ll get upset.

486
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,440
Be prepared and we won’t be sorry.

487
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,750
What if she drinks in some other place?

488
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:44,640
How dare she!

489
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,560
Before you marry her,

490
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,310
you’re already jealous.

491
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,310
Don’t you fear you’ll scare her?

492
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,390
That’s what makes me worry.

493
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,750
When I stay with her

494
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,080
every time,

495
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,230
things get out of control.

496
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,630
I’m worried I will...

497
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,030
You know my family rules.

498
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,910
I surely know.

499
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,510
They’re so cruel.

500
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,350
We’re in the new age.

501
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,440
So, sensibly and reasonably,

502
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,000
this is the best choice

503
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,390
for Qi Nian.

504
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,640
That’s why I want to calm down

505
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,710
when I go to America.

506
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,070
If I keep staying close to her,

507
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,110
there’ll be danger.

508
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,230
Go without concern.

509
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,110
Maybe when you come back,

510
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,880
you’ll be the cold man again

511
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,750
like you were.

512
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,910
I bet you won’t.

513
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,350
Don’t you know
absence makes the heart grow fonder?

514
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,030
When he comes back, he’ll be more eager.

515
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,190
Girl like you without love experience
can be so naive.

516
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,310
We’d better leave. Let’s go.

517
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,150
Go.

518
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,350
Weird.

519
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,430
Why is she suddenly gone?

520
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,470
You’re back?

521
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:42,720
Yes.

522
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:46,600
Why did you come back?

523
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,160
With a beautiful girl in America around,

524
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:48,920
you were too happy to come back, huh?

525
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,630
Why did you come back, then?

526
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,790
What did you say?

527
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:51,910
What girl?

528
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,760
Don’t play dumb.

529
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,560
I heard her.

530
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,480
She called you baby.

531
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,040
When you were in America for business,

532
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,310
you had good fortune in love affairs.

533
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,510
What about you?

534
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,560
If I hadn’t took you here,

535
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,920
would you confess to someone else?

536
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,640
It’s none of your business.

537
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,000
It’s my own stuff.

538
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,560
Also, you don’t love me with true heart.

539
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,070
Why bother to care who I confess to?

540
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,090
Hello?

541
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:15,070
Hello?

542
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:15,970
Qi Nian.

543
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,520
Where did you go?

544
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,510
Why were you suddenly gone?

545
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,270
I’m...

546
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:22,600
Hello?

547
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,110
Are you listening?

548
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,920
(Jin Xianyu)
What you owe me,

549
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,490
(Jin Xianyu)
I’ll get it back next time.

550
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:28,890
Hello?

551
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,240
Next time?

552
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,030
So what?

553
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,640
You called another girl.

554
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,630
Can’t I call a friend, too?

555
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,230
Another girl?

556
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,430
You can also call her.

557
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,790
Hello, honey, you’re home?

558
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,310
Listen. She still called you honey.

559
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,470
Why is there a girl’s voice?

560
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,030
Baby, you’re with a girl?

561
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,670
Baby?

562
00:24:59,120 --> 00:24:59,680
Madam,

563
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,040
who are you?

564
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,560
Can you just call him baby or honey

565
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:04,200
as you wish?

566
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,150
But I always call him baby
since he was little.

567
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,390
Little?

568
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,280
She’s a beautiful rich lady.

569
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,430
And she also grew up with you?

570
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,760
Son, she’s your girlfriend?

571
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,110
Son? Who is your son?

572
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,790
She’s young and naive.

573
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,150
Mom, don’t be angry.

574
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,070
Mom?

575
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,270
I’ll introduce her to you
when you come back to China.

576
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,270
See you.

577
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,070
So, when you were in America,

578
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,760
your mother stayed

579
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,790
with you?

580
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:35,790
Yes.

581
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,150
But Shao Zui didn’t tell me.

582
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,510
Shao Zui?

583
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,240
Is that man just now your ex-boyfriend?

584
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:48,910
He’s just senior to me.

585
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:00,780
(Qi Nian’s ex-boyfriend came
to get back with her.)

586
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,470
Damn Shao Zui!

587
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,440
Go.

588
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,830
Where are we going?

589
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,440
Hey, you.

590
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,310
Did you trap my cousin again?

591
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,880
I didn’t trap him.

592
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,870
That’s a trap of love, at most.

593
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:27,480
When it’s over,

594
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,560
Grandpa Ji will be grateful to me.

595
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,190
Why?

596
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,290
I helped them with their future family.

597
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:48,950
Hello, Mr. Ji.

598
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,840
Who told you to drive the car here?

599
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,560
Mr. Shao said you were reunited
after a long absence

600
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,670
and you would need a car.

601
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,070
It’s sensible of him.

602
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,510
Tell him

603
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,110
I’ll deal with him later.

604
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:01,990
Get in the car.

605
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,720
Uh... Is this the place?

606
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,710
You know where we are?

607
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,680
No.

608
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,640
Then why did you come?

609
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,070
You took me here!

610
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,110
Fine, I’m sorry.

611
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,070
You know why you’re sorry?

612
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,990
Don’t imagine things too far, all right?

613
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,350
Do I look like I’ll cheat on you?

614
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,440
No.

615
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,880
But if you’re determined to cheat on me,

616
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,200
I’ll have nothing to do.

617
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:54,870
Qi Nian.

618
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,470
Shut up if you don’t want to be doomed.

619
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,150
On the day I left for business trip,
you went to my office

620
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,670
and saw something, right?

621
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,430
Yes.

622
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:08,800
I knew

623
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,880
how much you could imagine,

624
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,110
considering how imaginative you were.

625
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,080
But when I came back,

626
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,310
I realized I was totally wrong.

627
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,480
Do you think

628
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,800
I’m in love with you

629
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,830
because I want to draw over your father?

630
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,640
Then shouldn’t I get a girlfriend

631
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,880
for every project?

632
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,520
I believe you can do that!

633
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,920
You’re charming, after all.

634
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,800
Qi Nian!

635
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,760
Yelling at me doesn’t work.

636
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,120
Also,

637
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,280
you knew me before.

638
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,280
Why didn’t you tell me?

639
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,240
Because that’s not necessary.

640
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,520
For the project,

641
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,560
I asked your father for help.

642
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,480
But it has nothing to do

643
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,390
with our relationship.

644
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,320
If you don’t believe me,

645
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,360
you can ask your father.

646
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:37,970
I’m...

647
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:39,120
Why must I ask my father?

648
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:39,820
Also,

649
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,060
you made me your TA

650
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,100
so that I got close to you.

651
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,450
Later, I became your assistant.

652
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,690
Don’t you think it’s only
because of your own charm?

653
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:46,890
Really?

654
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:47,890
No.

655
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,690
But it may be related with your name.

656
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:54,820
When I heard your name

657
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:55,930
for the first time,

658
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,050
I felt you were the one for me.

659
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,650
I didn’t know why, though.

660
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:01,730
Are you serious?

661
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:02,730
Yes.

662
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,460
Anything else to ask?

663
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,010
Yes.

664
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,050
Even if I misunderstood you,

665
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,140
why didn’t you answer my calls

666
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,090
over so many days?

667
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,290
It’s the problem of next stage.

668
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,210
Let’s get upstairs, first.

669
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,290
This room...

670
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,130
Do you like it?

671
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,180
Is it a love hotel

672
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,850
you found in some guidance?

673
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:39,410
Well, the view looks great.

674
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,890
How did you find such a wonderful place?

675
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,940
When I wanted, I found it.

676
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,330
Or I could even build one.

677
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,730
This bed...

678
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,610
It’s romantic.

679
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:52,730
Yes.

680
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,130
It’s a love hotel.

681
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,130
Love hotel?

682
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,060
So,

683
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,010
why must we come to this place?

684
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,650
To talk about something
between a couple.

685
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:06,740
You remember you’re my girlfriend,

686
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,900
don’t you?

687
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,530
Yes.

688
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,170
But I...

689
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:12,890
I’m not sure.

690
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,650
Because I didn’t answer your calls?

691
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,290
Because I didn’t know our start.

692
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,290
If...

693
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:23,980
If you’re in a relationship with me

694
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,130
because you like me,

695
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,370
there should be traces.

696
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,650
I’ve recalled it many times.

697
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,500
But I still didn’t know

698
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,290
when you fell in love with me.

699
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,690
You didn’t know.

700
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,250
Even I couldn’t answer this question

701
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,250
by myself.

702
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,330
Then you don’t love me?

703
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:42,890
Just the opposite.

704
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,570
Do you remember

705
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,690
I told you that

706
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,380
the love we were accustomed to

707
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,050
had got beyond itself?

708
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:00,970
I do.

709
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,370
That’s how I feel for you.

710

00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,560
when I fell in love with you,

00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,250

00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,490
(Qi Nian)
I could no longer leave you.

717
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,500
I could only let my love for you

718
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,050
grow day by day.

719

Except that,

720
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,210
I couldn’t do anything else.

721

Siqi said I was a controlling freak.

I didn’t think so.

I really came up with a weird idea.

I want to control the rest of your life,
