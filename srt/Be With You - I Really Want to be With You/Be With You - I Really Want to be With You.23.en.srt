of girl manga is...

22
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:53,910
Miss Lu,

23
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,430
we are in a meeting.

24
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,790
Dismissed!

25
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,790
Dismissed!

26
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,920
Go, go, go.

27
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,310
Hurry up. Come on.

28
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,600
Chop. Chop. Let’s go.

29
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,430
Got it.

30
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,600
Burst in like that?

31
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,070
Seems you don’t care about your dignity.

32
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,390
Dignity is for humans,

33
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,230
not for you.

34
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,350
I don’t want to say any more.

35
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,270
Just terminate the contract.

36
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,910
You want to do it openly now?

37
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,470
I don’t care what you think.

38
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,230
My lawyer will follow up the details.

39
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,030
From now on,

40
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,790
I have nothing to do with you.

41
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,270
Just because I cheated that boy,

42
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,190
so you’re risking your future
to be against me?

43
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,230
Let me tell you,

44
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,800
as long as you leave Rongpin,

45
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,870
I’ll ruin your reputation right away,

46
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,870
including Qi Nian.

47
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,920
I heard you’d restart Thither Cloud

48
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,470
and co-sign with her publicly?

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
How can you be so sure

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,230
this is for her good?

51
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,270
I know what you are thinking.

52
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,270
We can end up together at worst.

53
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,310
If we really have to fight,

54
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,270
I may not lose to you.

55
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,030
Miss Lu came in full fury. So scary.

56
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,120
Miss Lu.

57
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,750
Miss Lu.

58
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,230
Are you really leaving Rongpin?

59
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,630
Don’t worry.

60
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,430
I can support you guys

61
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,870
even without Rongpin.

62
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,030
Let’s go.

63
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,070
You…?

64
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,950
They won’t leave with you.

65
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,910
You really think you are the Queen
of girl’s manga?

66
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,350
Let me just tell you.

67
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,350
You’re nothing without Rongpin.

68
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,190
Don’t care about those minions.

69
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,230
Let’s go,

70
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,350
My Queen.

71
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,660
Baby, where are you?

72
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,720
Come back home to take the
residence booklet.

73
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,240
My mom sent it to me.

74
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,310
She really did?

75
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,120
Didn’t you say you need it

76
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,720
for the visa or something?

77
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,910
Yes, it’s the thing.

78
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,120
I heard Lu Qingwu fell out with Rongpin.

79
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,640
Is that true?

80
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,270
Yes.

81
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,560
Whose voice is that?

82
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,470
So loud.

83
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,270
Xinxin, take good care of yourself.

84
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,600
Well, don’t bother.

85
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,030
I’m just here to get my package.

86
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:54,760
No.

87
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,280
Ji Siqi is coming back.

88
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,520
If I don’t clean it up,

89
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,630
he will scold me.

90
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,160
That’s right.

91
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,160
With his temper,

92
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,990
he will scold you while helping you
clean it up.

93
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,200
Yes, totally right.

94
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,680
You don’t know how long-winded he is.

95
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,560
Especially when he worries about you,

96
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,600
he gets so chatty and logical.

97
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,000
Just like a housewife.

98
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,800
I know.

99
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,190
The Jis are all like this.

100
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,710
Thank you.

101
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,750
Not at all.

102
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,590
I’ve never seen you like this before.

103
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,280
If it’s before,

104
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,960
you would never allow

105
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,430
even one single hair to be in a mess.

106
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,470
I haven’t seen you like this
for long either.

107
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,270
Are we ready

108
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,950
for a better relationship now?

109
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:48,910
Of course.

110
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,080
Well, I want to ask you

111
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,110
if you regret it now.

112
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,230
Yes, I regret it.

113
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,120
If I terminated the contract
a little earlier,

114
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,320
maybe Ji Siqi would have become
mine earlier.

115
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,990
And he could be more open.

116
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,270
It’s in broad daylight,
restrain yourself.

117
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,990
What stage are you and Ji Yanxin
at now?

118
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,430
Did you have a kiss?

119
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,240
No way!

120
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,150
Why is he still obeying that
stupid family rule?

121
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,990
At the very beginning, he was really…

122
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,910
But now…

123
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,480
We can’t see each other now anyway.

124
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,950
It’s meaningless to say that now.

125
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,950
How about

126
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,830
you change a boyfriend?

127
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,080
There are so many men in the world,

128
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,280
we can change as we want.

129
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,040
We don’t have to

130
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,590
put all the eggs in one basket, right?

131
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,910
You got the vinegar back?

132
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,720
Wash your hands.

133
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,110
Let’s get ready for dinner.

134
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,470
I don’t have appetite.

135
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,600
It’s OK.

136
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,240
Then, go change clothes.

137
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,000
We can go have a walk.

138
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,990
Change?

139
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,440
I think you just want to

140
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,880
change me to other baskets.

141
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,190
You can go to all your other boys now.

142
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,960
Goodness.

143
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,840
I’ve never seen Siqi be so jealous.

144
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,640
Totally a King of Jealousy.

145
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,920
Now you know that?

146
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,790
He is the younger one.

147
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,070
I wonder how his elder brother will be

148
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,670
when he gets jealous.

149
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,270
Be careful.

150
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,480
Qi Bao.

151
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,230
Exam time now.

152
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,080
Tell me loudly,

153
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,070
what’s the important thing in your
daddy’s heart?

154
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,160
Building.

155
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,030
That’s pretty correct.

156
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:43,840
Alright.

157
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,190
Here comes the formal question.

158
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,280
Who is the No.1 angel

159
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,590
in his heart?

160
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,260
(Me)

161
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,390
You?

162
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,160
I didn’t know you were like this.

163
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,720
But I’m asking about human.

164
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,760
Let’s do it one last time.

165
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,630
I’ll give up if it’s still not correct.

166
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,300
(His brother)

167
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,790
His brother?

168
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,800
What’s wrong with this App?

169
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,670
I won’t believe it.

170
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,640
Am I nothing in

171
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,510
Ji Yanxin’s heart?

172
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,040
Don’t move!

173
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,870
I don’t want to play with you now.

174
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:26,620
(Wife)

175
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,940
(Mr. J: Come to the study room with me.)

176
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,220
(He gives you a document.)

177
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:35,740
(What’s this?)

178
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,700
(The document loses you
deep in thought.)

179
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,700
(Game Over)

180
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,680
What?

181
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,260
Why is the game over?

182
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,260
(Game Over)

183
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,940
(Mr. J: Goodbye. We are over now.)

184
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,640
No way!

185
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,830
It’s over between Mr. J and me?

186
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:55,870
Xiaoqi?

187
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,670
Did you call me just now?

188
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,550
I…

189
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:05,830
How do I look?

190
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:06,870
Do you like it?

191
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,240
Great!

192
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,440
You’re an actor indeed.

193
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,270
You’re 100 percent like him.

194
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,150
But to me,

195
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,310
there is still one step left…

196
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,640
Mr. J is himself only when he is

197
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,670
together with Xiaoqi.

198
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,320
So, do you want to…?

199
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:27,990
No.

200
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,840
I haven’t finished yet.

201
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,760
You don’t need to finish your words.

202
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,830
I have only one answer.

203
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,720
Mr. Su,

204
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,950
are you too much into the play?

205
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,590
Shouldn’t I be into the play?

206
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,110
Since Mr. J is your type,

207
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,680
as Xiaoqi,

208
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,040
shouldn’t you choose me?

209
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,520
But I’m not Xiaoqi.

210
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,840
And I have only one Mr. Right.

211
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,070
It’s my boyfriend.

212
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,000
No matter how much you are
like Mr. J,

213
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,470
he is still the only one in my heart.

214
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,990
Then why don’t you refuse me?

215
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,000
Aren’t you attracted by me?

216
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,960
You’re asking while
you know the answer.

217
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,070
Of course it’s because of Qi Bao.

218
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,800
Now, I have to make it clear with you.

219
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,760
Mr. Su,

220
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,310
thank you for bringing Qi Bao up.

221
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,310
But I won’t let you take it away.

222
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,870
What if I have to?

223
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,150
You went too far.

224
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,750
Mr. Ji?

225
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,310
Don’t be cheated by him.

226
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,200
He is not Qi Bao’s owner.

227
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,110
How do you know that I’m not?

228
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,480
Qi Bao is five years old now.

229
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,600
And you went abroad ten years ago.

230
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,870
So you brought him up in your dream?

231
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,560
But he is really close to Qi Bao.

232
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,040
If you go to the pet clinic for
a whole week to be with it,

233
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,150
you can also be close.

234
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,070
That’s to say…

235
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,480
He used Qi Bao to approach you

236
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,670
just to act the play well.

237
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,120
I have to say

238
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,150
you really are a dedicated actor.

239
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,630
But I hope you can shrink back
from difficulties,

240
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,230
Mr. Su Xuran.

241
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:43,990
Oh, no.

242
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,030
I should call you Fatty Su.

243
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,150
How do you know my nickname?

244
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,350
Of course I got it from one of
your old friends.

245
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,880
What’s wrong with him?

246
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,000
Is he going to look for trouble?

247
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,110
How come you still worry about others?

248
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,230
Welcome back.

249
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,040
Yeah.

250
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,360
If I don’t come back,

251
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,510
I’ll have to pay a double penalty.

252
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,480
Ji Yanxin! You idiot!

253
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,990
I’ll cheat on you if you
don’t come back.

254
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,920
Ji Yanxin, look at me.

255
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,840
Your puppy is leaving with others.

256
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,400
I played this App a long time ago.

257
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,230
What?

258
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,630
You want to scold me?

259
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,830
Aren’t you my puppy?

260
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,550
Why don’t you bark?

261
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,480
I’m sorry.

262
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,190
Sorry?

263
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,390
Looks like you’re getting bolder.

264
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,880
Are you challenging me?

265
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,760
I apologize.

266
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,070
Just give me one more chance.

267
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,230
OK.

268
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,870
It’ll be easy.

269
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,030
Make me happy.

270
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,310
How to?

271
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,670
Did you bring your residence booklet?

272
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,270
Let’s go.

273
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,800
Go where?

274
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,160
To take photos.

275
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,750
Take photos?

276
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,190
Come on.

277
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,200
It’s not like a shopping mall.

278
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,030
Is there a photo studio inside?

279
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,310
Qi Nian.

280
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,880
Do you know how I will discipline

281
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,910
Qi Bao when he made mistakes?

282
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,880
First rule of Ji’s Family Rules.

283
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,760
Only nod your head when you
made a mistake.

284
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,510
Not allowed to speak.

285
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,710
Understand?

286
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,720
After we get in there,

287
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,120
just take the photo.

288
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,760
You can tell them your name
if they ask you.

289
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,240
And just nod your head
about everything else.

290
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:43,870
Got it.

291
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,430
Let’s go.

292
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,200
You’re so heartless.

293
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,480
I thought you got a terminal illness

294
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,150
and were sold to Thailand to become
a transgender.

295
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,350
What an imagination.

296
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,840
How could I know

297
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,960
that you are just less than

298
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,150
ten minutes’ walk from my home?

299
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,360
Why are you dressing like this?

300
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,280
Are you in the show “X-Change”?

301
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,590
How dare you mock at me?

302
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:41,950
Miss Ji.

303
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,840
You should take the blame!

304
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,600
Just speak!

305
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,750
Why did you kick me?

306
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:55,100
(Closed)

307
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,590
It’s the restaurant where I celebrated
my last birthday.

308
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,430
You have found yourself a back way.

309
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,630
It was really premeditated.

310
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,390
I didn’t find any back way.

311
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,400
Here I am now

312
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,320
just because I think

313
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,470
the food here is great.

314
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,680
Stop pretending.

315
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,590
Then what is this?

316
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,550
You have already known my dad

317
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,190
before you got to know me.

318
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,950
What on earth is your relationship?

319
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,190
Why have you never

320
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,870
mentioned this during the ten years?

321
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,680
Do you remember the accident

322
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,550
I told you?

323
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,590
Actually it’s a disaster.

324
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,080
(Taken with team leader before
the climbing in 2009)

325
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,790
It wasn’t for your father,

326
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,590
the one buried under the avalanche

327
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,350
should be me.

328
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,360
The night before
we climbed the mountain,

329
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,750
he told me all about you.

330
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,560
He said he regretted it

331
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,590
because he had been busy with
his business abroad

332
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,470
and missed your childhood.

333
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,390
He said he would love to see

334
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,080
his daughter grow up if he

335
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,830
had the chance.

336
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,110
But he’s gone.

337
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,630
Then let me, who survived, fulfill

338
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,070
this wish for him.

339
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:38,990
That’s to say,

340
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,230
all you’ve done for me these years

341
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,670
is just to repay him?

342
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,150
You changed a lot after you became
the president.

343
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,430
Now you can catch the point.

344
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,150
Turns out

345
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,150
there is a time limit

346
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,030
for being nice to someone.

347
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,710
Thanks for your promise and

348
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,310
having put up with me for so long.

349
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,870
From now on,

350
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,750
you don’t need to worry about me.

351
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,470
Zhou Xinxin!

352
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,710
Finally you dare to recognize me.

353
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,160
If it weren’t for your
surplus actor personality,

354
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,840
I would be ashamed to call you,

355
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,800
Fatty Su.

356
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,630
Stop calling me by that!

357
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,830
Keep your eyes wide open and see

358
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,760
if there is anything on me

359
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,560
related to the word “fatty”!

360
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,560
Yes. Your gut.

361
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,190
You…!

362
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,360
Well, buddy,

363
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,750
how dare you offend Ji Yanxin?

364
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,440
But thanks to your intervention,

365
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,990
his plan is completed in advance.

366
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:30,750
What do you mean?

367
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,630
Mr. Ji,

368
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,880
I feel something wrong.

369
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,590
What’s wrong?

370
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,720
The staffs in there

371
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,030
all said “Congratulations” to me.

372
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,710
You heard it wrong.

373
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,080
But they also gave me the

374
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,400
marriage registration form

375
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,710
and the pre-marital check-up form.

376
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,230
They were just setting the mood.

377
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,670
Now the shops really work hard
to serve the lovers.

378
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:02,320
But why is it in Marriage Registry,
Civil Affairs Bureau?

379
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,350
Yeah, why?

380
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,880
And these.

Is this the latest photo template?

382
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,760
(Marriage Registry)
so, after the whole process,

383
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,150
don’t tell me that you don’t know
what we are doing.

384
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,040
Of course I’m not an idiot.

385
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,310
I can tell that.

386
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,230
But this all happened so fast.

387
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,870
I want you to tell me in person.

388
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,080
Then you tell me first

389
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,080
what the sentence

390
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,680
was that you didn’t get to say

391
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,510
on the plane.

392
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,430
I miss you.

393
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:36,830
In the future,

394
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,710
remember to finish
all the important sentences.

395
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,110
Like, I miss you.

396
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,550
I do.

397
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,750
I love you.

398
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,750
And, let’s get married.

It’s over now.

402

After all these years,

403

finally all my worries

404

have gone.

If you want me to praise you,

406

work out your abs quickly.

00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,310
How dare you nitpick…

408
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,790
I don’t dare.

00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,320
My Siqi is so cute.

410
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,280
I’m even used to your love handles.

411
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,280
What love handles?

412
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,640
That’s called muffin-top.

413
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,070
It’ll be gone
as long as I don’t eat sweets.

414

What’s wrong?

415
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,750
Nothing.

416
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,310
You’re so sweet.

417
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,030
What if I can’t get rid of you?

418
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,110
Who asked you to get rid of me?

419
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,390
If one day

420
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,030
I lose everything,

421
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,430
and even become your burden.

422
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,480
Will you…

423
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,630
Of course I will stick to you.

424
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,670
Dare you dump me?

425
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,350
Then it won’t be as easy
as losing a fan.

426
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,110
Ji Siqi,

427
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,880
I’m serious.

428
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,910
I’m serious, too.

429
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:40,920
Although I don’t know

430
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,190
what you did with my phone,

431
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,430
no matter what will happen,

432
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,910
I’m always by your side.

433
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,590
At worst, we can start over again.

434
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,670
I wonder

435
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,910
where we will be

436
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,910
if we keep riding

437
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,150
along this road.

438
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,270
I don’t know.

439
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,880
But you’re direction blind.

440
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,950
You can go nowhere.

441
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,270
Do you want to try?

442
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,590
OK.

443
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,280
Marriage,

444
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,280
legally called the establishment
of marriage,

445
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,840
is also a civil legal act
which determines

446
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,830
the relationship between spouses.

447
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,270
Spouses?

448
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,560
In short, from this moment on,

449
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,400
we are a couple

450
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,790
with legal rights.

451
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:53,950
Couple?

452
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,120
Couple, means husband and wife.

453
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,480
Do you need me to explain that?

454
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,160
My parents don’t even know

455
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,560
that I got a boyfriend.

456
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,920
But now I’m already married?

457
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,030
This is… So out of a sudden.

458
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,390
Who says they don’t know?

459
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,360
What you fear always comes to you.

460
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,110
It’s my mom!

461
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,750
Hello, Mrs. Qi.

462
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:13,830
Everything went well.

463
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,630
Don’t call me Mrs. Qi.

464
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,630
I’m your mother-in-law now.

465
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,630
You’re right.

466
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,000
What? Wait!

467
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,800
Mom! What’s going on?

468
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,190
How do you know Mr. Ji?

469
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,590
Kid, you are already married.

470
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,470
Why do you still call him Mr. Ji?

471
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,830
How do you know that?

472
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,480
I didn’t know it until your husband

473
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,400
came to propose.

474
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,910
When did he go?

475
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,520
Last week.

476
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,800
Ji is a man

477
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,960
who has both pretty face

478
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,640
and good personality.

479
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,680
Why don’t I agree?

480
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,560
What about my dad?

481
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,200
He also agreed that easily?

482
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,760
He was repairing a tower outside.

483
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,680
He just texted me and said he got it.

484
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,550
Am I really your daughter?

485
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,240
Baby,

486
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,400
trust me. I have good eyes.

487
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,920
That’s your best luck of love affair
for all this life.

-You can make it!

490
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,310
Mom!

491
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,640
So your last business trip was to

492
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,270
go to my hometown?

493
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,320
Do you still feel it out of a sudden?

494
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:17,990
Mrs. Ji?

495
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,390
Why do you suddenly call me Mrs. Ji?

496
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,080
What else?

497
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,430
Who else do you want to marry
except Ji Yanxin?

500

that man is still called Ji Yanxin.

Hello?

503
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:38,760
Where are you now?

504
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,630
Did you read Weibo?

505
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,070
No. What’s wrong?

00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,150
Bye!

514
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,680
Qi Nian,

515
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,150
do you know that you can rely on me?

516
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,470
I know

517
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,950
you will protect me.

518
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,550
So, don’t worry.

519
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,950
I will settle it down.

520
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,380
(MC)

521
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,990
Don’t do stupid things.

522
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:27,920
Come on.

523
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,030
What stupid things can I do?

524
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,400
You kept logging in and out Weibo.

525
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,960
Aren’t you trying to clarify it for her?

526
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,600
Can I?

527
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,550
You can’t!

528
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,720
Now everyone is aiming at Lu Qingwu.

529
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,070
Why do you have to take the bullets
for her?

530
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,480
Can’t you keep yourself safe first?

531
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,710
Do I have to stick it on your head?

532
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,110
What’s more,

533
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,440
Rongpin has so many paid posters.

534
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,600
What can you do alone?

535
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,240
Yes, I can’t win. So what?

536
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,800
Can all the truths

537
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,510
in the world be concealed
just by loud voices?

538
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,480
But, sis,

539
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,000
you just got popular,

540
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,920
why do you have to help her?

541
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,030
Well, Xinxin,

542
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,640
Xiao Li must have also said

543
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,910
what you said just now to Lu Qingwu.

544
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,350
But she chose to shrink back.

545
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,670
I don’t want to do this.

546
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,150
Alright. I know I can’t stop you.

547
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,870
Let’s listen to the leaders’ opinion.

548
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,310
Public opinion warfare?

549
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,750
I’m never afraid of it.

550
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,310
Of course we should fight back.

551
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,230
I disagree.

552
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,320
Qi Nian is still a newbie.

553
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,560
She shouldn’t get involved in
negative news.

554
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,910
Are you the leader now?

555
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,870
Why are you telling your opinion?

556
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,520
Didn’t you say you wouldn’t
bother me again?

557
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,430
They why are you here now?

558
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,950
Are you the boss here?

559
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,910
Doesn’t your restaurant need customers?

560
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,840
I think

561
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,190
the two of us should leave.

562
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,880
They can’t even handle the matter

563
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,790
between themselves.

564
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,350
I agree.

565
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,520
Boss!

566
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,590
Bring me the most expensive wine
you have!

567
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,360
He is in the kitchen.

568
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,310
He has no time to talk to you.

569
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,310
You don’t want me to drink?

570
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,390
Then I’ll drink in another place.

571
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,160
What’s wrong with you?

572
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:11,910
Sit down.

573
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,030
Didn’t you say you wouldn’t
care about me again?

574
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,350
Does it have anything to do with you
that I drank myself to death?

575
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,790
You want to drink?

576
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,310
Drink this.

577
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,720
The boss made it himself.

578
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,830
You can have as much as you want.

579
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:30,150
I will go back to deal with
the follow-up of Rongpin.

580
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,870
Think about it for yourself.

581
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,980
(Cartoonist Lu Qingwu:
An open letter from me…)

582
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,790
Do you know that you can rely on me?

583
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,030
I know

584
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,630
you will protect me.

585
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,110
So, don’t worry.

586
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,550
I will settle it down.

587
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,430
Miss.

588
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,200
This is our new cake.

589
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,040
Have a try

590
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:23,840
and give me your opinion.

591
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,470
OK.

592
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,390
How is it?

593
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,240
It’s just right sweet.

594
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:31,800
Delicious.

595
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,430
Really?

596
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:33,760
Sir,

597
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,240
can I have a take-out of it?

598
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,070
Of course.

599
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,230
For your boyfriend?

600
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,070
Now I should call him my husband.

601
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,680
You’re married?

602
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,550
Congratulations!

603
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,710
I wonder who the lucky boy is.

604
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,590
Actually, I’m the lucky one.

605
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,440
I have dreamed of getting married

606
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,520
with him.

607
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,480
But when we really get married,

608
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,430
I’m still kind of afraid.

609
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,230
Girl, you’re still young.

610
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,710
Maybe you think

611
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,240
marriage is complicated and serious.

612
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,390
But I have to tell you that

613
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,200
marriage is just

614
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,150
two people living together.

615
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,120
No matter it will be happy

616
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:13,950
or sad,

617
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,040
everything will be fine as long as

618
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,030
the two of you face it together.

619
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,070
What do you think?

620
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,360
Please enjoy this.

621
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,160
I will go pack up one for you.

622
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:22,910
Thank you, sir.

623
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,190
Here is the whole thing.

624
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,390
What do you think I should do?

625
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,430
You want to hear the truth?

626
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,870
I agree with Shao Zui.

627
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,830
The farther away you can get from

628
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,310
such a public muddle, the better.

629
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,030
But, your own feelings are more

630
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,030
important than the others’ opinions.

631
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,550
Many things can only be done now.

632
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,510
You will regret for a lifetime
if you miss it.

633
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,870
So, just follow your heart

634
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,430
and do what you want.

635
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,550
What if I fall into the trap?

636
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,910
You still have me.

637
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:14,990
I will catch you.

638
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,510
Go for it.

639
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,550
I will.

640
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,600
I have reviewed the long Weibo content

641
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,120
several times

642
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,710
and will follow up with the
lawyer’s statement.

643
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,000
Don’t worry.

644
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,080
Now you got the whole
Publicity Department behind.

645
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,240
Just rush forward.

646
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,110
We have enough forces for you.

647
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,440

648
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,270
and also your strongest support.

649
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,280
Don’t get too emotional.

650
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:43,950

And all the other silent accounts,

654

repost it now.

00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:54,990
Nothing.

683
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,040
I’m bored after work.

684
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:57,910
So I bought some paid trolls.

685
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,590
Some?

686
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,590
I can add some more if it’s not enough.

687
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,320
I didn’t realize until today that

688
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,870
you had so many hidden relationships.

689
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,440
How big is your hiding room?

690
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,030
How many more secrets do I not know?

691
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,150
Maybe I had a lot of it before.

692
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,070
But now you’re the only one left.

693
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:20,790
Why are you silent?

694
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,110
Thank you.

695
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,670
Anything else?

696
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,270
And, I miss you.

697
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,760
I want to see you now.

698
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,390
Right away.

699
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,430
So do I.

700
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,150
I’ll wait for you.

701
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,560
I lied when I left you

702
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,550
last time.

703
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,910
Actually, I’m afraid to be alone.

704
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,600
But I didn’t dare to tell you.

705
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:11,750
So I escaped.

706
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:13,990
Well,

707
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,110
you always want to escape
when you meet some troubles.

708
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,990
How did you get the courage
to woo me at the beginning?

709
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,830
If I tell you that

710
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,510
I’m still scared of getting married,

711
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,950
will you blame me?

712
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,150
No.

713
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,790
I’m not a man who is good at waiting,

714
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,110
but I have made progress on it
because of you.

715
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,150
Take it easy.

716
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:44,990
We’re not in a hurry.

717
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,230
You are here.

718
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,670
I don’t want you to wait anymore.

719
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,150
Let’s go home.

720
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,630
Qi Bao.

721
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,710
This girl is really a good drinker.

722
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,590
Yeah.

723
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,920
She never got drunk before.

724
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,070
I don’t know what’s wrong today.

725
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,710
She fell asleep.

726
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,630
She has grown up so quickly.

727
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,590
You knew her before?

728
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,400
It’s late now.

729
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,910
Just let her sleep here tonight.

730
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,750
What will you do tomorrow?

731
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,310
Maybe I’ll go somewhere far away.

732
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,630
I think if she can’t find me,

733
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,190
she may give up.

734
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,150
If escaping can solve problems,

735
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,630
I wouldn’t have lost my whole family.

736
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,190
She drank a lot.

737
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,470
Have you thought about the reason?

738
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,390
Why do you think it is?

739
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,600
Young boy,

740
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,120
figure it out yourself.

741
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,630
It makes no sense if I tell you.

742
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,520
Come on.

743
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,240
We are both single.

744
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,840
Be nice to me.

745
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,950
Who do you mean?

746
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,560
I have my wife.

747
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,390
You have wife?

748
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,430
See?

749
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,830
We are of different identities.

750
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,270
You said you lost your family.

751
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,030
What a man.

752
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,430
You are all freakish jerks.

753
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,190
You’re awake?

754
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,070
Do you feel better?

755
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,590
Shao Zui, you bastard.

756
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,320
Watch your language.

757
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,510
I won’t!

758
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,750
Who do you think you are?

759
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,320
Why can you suddenly

760
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,280
appear inexplicably

761
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,040
and disappear with no reason?

762
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:28,760
If you want to take care of me,

763
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,440
you should do it for your whole life.

764
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,070
How could you suddenly disappear?

765
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,030
Miss,

766
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,680
you should be liable for

767
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,230
doing this while you’re drunk.

768
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,590
I don’t need you to repay!

769
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,590
Why did you come to disturb my life?

770
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:47,990
Why…

771
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:53,070
Why can’t you like me?

772
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:56,990
Am I…

773
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,750
Am I only your burden?
