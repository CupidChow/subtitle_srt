20
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,440
You mean,

21
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,480
they are still at odds?

22
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,040
The ice was about to be broken

23
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,010
when I intervened and screwed it.

24
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,640
It was not your fault.

25
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,320
There’s a deep misunderstanding
between them.

26
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,170
Misunderstanding?

27
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,480
You mean years ago

28
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,150
when Prof. Ji swept out Siqi’s room…

29
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,950
That was too terrible a thing
to be justified.

30
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,000
If it was me

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,250
whose spiritual pillar was ruined,

32
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,610
I’d definitely kill him.

33
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,080
That’s how you judge a friend?

34
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,080
My cousin did so

35
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,690
for Siqi’s own good.

36
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,080
Then let me ask you.

37
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,120
If someone cancels
all your website accounts

38
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,570
and stops you from worshiping
your idols,

39
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,450
will you still think that he does so
for your own good?

40
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,190
I’ll kill him.

41
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,310
Case closed.

42
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,370
If you ask me,

43
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,680
Ji might know

44
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,570
that he has gone too far.

45
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,690
But you know him, right?

46
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,400
It’s not easy for him to find an out

47
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,410
to apologize.

48
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,720
And Siqi loves to embarrass people.

49
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,190
So...

50
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,730
It is hard for him to apologize.

51
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,430
Grandpa,

52
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,550
do you need some water or food?

53
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,110
No.

54
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,950
Food and water is forbidden
for 12 hours before the operation.

55
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,740
Can I help you go to the toilet?

56
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,630
It’s not time yet.

57
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,470
We have to wait until they come
to take him to the operation room.

58
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,230
But I just need to do something.

59
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,550
You need to do nothing.

60
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:09,790
Sit down.

61
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,550
I…

62
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,590
You two…

63
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,100
Grandpa,

64
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,340
we are getting along with each other.

65
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,590
We are just bickering for fun.

66
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,270
Do I look stupid to you?

67
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,030
You are still at loggerheads.

68
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,950
And you are both bad actors.

69
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,430
Oh my.

70
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,580
I…

71
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,510
I’ll go get the nurse.

72
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,870
That coward just ran away.

73
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:39,910
Your brother

74
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,240
is perfect.

75
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,330
Except that he’s not straightforward.

76
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,380
Before I die, I just want…

77
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,270
Don’t worry.

78
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,870
If that’s your will,

79
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,590
I’ll forgive him anyway.

80
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,650
My will?

81
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,740
(Outpatient)

82
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,390
You little brat! “My will”?

83
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,310
Who told you that I’ve got cancer?

84
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,830
But you made a will, didn’t you?

85
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,670
As our assets are changing constantly,

86
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,950
don’t you think I should update my will
from time to time?

87
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,410
But,

88
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:16,350
you mentioned malignant tumor
on the phone.

89
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,990
That’s a routine question when you are
buying the critical illness insurance.

90
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,540
But you begged all your old friends
to take care of your grandson…

91
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,140
What are you talking about?

92
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,820
My grandson finally got a girlfriend.

93
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,790
Shouldn’t I tell everyone about this?

94
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:31,860
My goodness.

95
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,540
But…

96
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,860
But Yanxin talked to the doctor

97
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,230
and the doctor said you were not
having cholecystitis.

98
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:38,870
I told you so on purpose.

99
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,230
Mr. Ji,

100
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,210
time for the operation.

101
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:47,710
Careful.

102
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,510
I knew it.

103
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,620
Get them on the same page

104
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,110
before my operation is done.

105
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,590
You lied to me?

106
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,150
Sorry.

107
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,590
What did you say?

108
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,910
I was anxious to make peace with you.

109
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,790
That’s why I made use of Ji Qiu’s
wild imagination.

110
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:27,870
My apologies.

111
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,550
You are doing this again, aren’t you?

112
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,950
If you want to make peace with me,

113
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,910
why don’t you just speak it out?

114
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,390
What’s the point of playing tricks?

115
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:38,320
Also,

116
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,190
speaking of apologies,

117
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,310
you think you only have one thing
to apologize for?

118
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:44,630
I…

119
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,870
I apologize for all the harm I’ve done
to you in the past.

120
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,030
I’m sorry.

121
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:02,710
It’s enough.

122
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,940
Grandpa is in the operation room now.

123
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,100
Don’t just stay here.

124
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,350
Let’s go out for some fresh air. Go.

125
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,310
Let’s go.

126
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,790
Prof. Ji.

127
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,110
It will be fine.

128
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:35,800
What do you bring me here for?

129
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:36,990
You tell me.

130
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,630
You wanted to go against your brother
till the last moment?

131
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,740
A man like himself just

132
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,940
swallowed his pride to apologize to you.

133
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,350
This doesn’t happen every day.

134
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,150
Can’t you see how nervous he was?

135
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,510
So?

136
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,470
I should be moved to tears?

137
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:54,820
Shouldn’t people

138
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,780
bear the consequence
for their mistakes?

139
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,270
Well, he did make some mistakes.

140
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,630
But what about you?

141
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,530
How close have you been

142
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:04,910
to the truth all these years?

143
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,920
What are you supposed to mean?

144
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,230
Answer me.

145
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,310
Why is the company still running

146
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,030
after your dad left?

147
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,870
Because someone is carrying it forward.

148
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,350
And that “someone” is your brother.

149
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,030
But…

150
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,830
Isn’t that my grandpa…

151
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,990
Your grandpa first paid off the debt
with the family’s legacy.

152
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,750
But then your brother was too proud

153
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,860
to become the debtor of the family,

154
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,840
so he insisted
on paying your grandpa back.

155
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,470
Can you believe that?

156
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,630
A well-educated man like him

157
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,110
was reduced to a labor contractor,

158
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,300
toiling away for a penny or two,

159
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,230
and ending up with an unsound body.

160
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,750
He’s been taking pills till now.

161
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,140
He doesn’t want to worry you

162
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,700
so he asked us to keep this from you.

163
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,630
Stop it.

164
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,470
I’ll stop here.

165
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,310
It’s up to you whether you want to

166
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,590
know about the rest of the truth.

167
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,700
Don’t you really want to know

168
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,030
what he has got you for your birthday?

169
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,180
(Happy Birthday)

170
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,670
Prof. Ji.

00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,590
Prof. Ji.

172
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:57,540
Prof. Ji.

173
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:58,070
Grandpa.

174
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,700
He’s fine.

175
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,460
It was just
a minimally-invasive surgery.

176
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,550
The doctor says
he can be discharged tomorrow.

177
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,510
Besides, he’s got a nursing worker
with him now.

178
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,990
Don’t you worry about him.

179
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,590
Where’s Siqi?

180
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:13,500
Siqi.

181
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,060
Shao Zui told me

182
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,220
that he came by during the day.

183
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,150
But now I don’t know where he is.

184
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,150
Prof. Ji,

185
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,310
are you OK?

186
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,030
I don’t think he’ll come back again.

187
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:55,820
(Shop Assistant Wanted)

188
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,430
Boy,

189
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,020
you should go to a bar for alcohol,

190
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,550
not a convenience store.

191
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:08,830
Besides,

192
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,310
you call this alcohol?

193
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,630
Leave me alone.

194
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,550
Don’t tell me

195
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,670
that you’ve never been to a bar.

196
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,910
My brother never allows me to.

197
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:23,870
What a good boy.

198
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,470
But you often fight back against him,
don’t you?

199
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,790
You know what?

200
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,420
If you have talked to me that way,

201
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,190
I would have skinned you.

202
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,870
You are lucky that Ji Yanxin is
your biological brother.

203
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:35,790
Right.

204
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,510
It’s my fault.

205
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,150
I’m a prick.

206
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,950
He’s too good to be my brother.

207
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,270
Don’t say that.

208
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,320
No.

209
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,670
I’m just an ungrateful bastard.

210
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,750
I care nothing but my own feelings.

211
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,990
I never bother to know the sacrifice
made by others.

212
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,710
I even asked him to apologize,

213
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,390
when I should be the one to apologize!

214
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,950
I went so far that I scolded him

215
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,830
just for…

216
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,710
just for my whole closet
of ACG collection.

217
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,350
A whole closet of them?

218
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,750
Then you are entitled to be angry.

219
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,990
Many of them are no longer available
however rich you are.

220
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,230
Let alone the collector’s editions.

221
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:27,760
Exactly.

222
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:31,710
But he managed
to complete the collection.

223
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,270
The same collection as the one he broke.

224
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,470
Every single piece

225
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,350
was in its original place

226
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,510
like they’ve never left.

227
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,430
God knows how much effort he’s made.

228
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,780
How dare I…

229
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,150
How dare I say that he didn’t mean it
when he apologized?

230
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,830
What a prick I am.

231
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,970
What did I say?

232
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,230
Alcohol is not for kids.

233
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:24,910
Look.

234
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,670
This suits you better.

235
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,790
Boy,

236
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,270
don’t think too much.

237
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:33,380
You made a mistake, then go apologize.

238
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,310
You feel guilty,
then you go make it up to him.

239
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,300
Save alcohol for the time

240
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,630
when you are in true sorrow.

241
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,990
It’s still too early for you.

242
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,910
You speak like you’re
much older than me.

243
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,750
You are a dead man, kid!

244
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:50,220
Two words are forbidden here.

245
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,060
One starts with J (‘Jie’, older sister),

246
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,110
the other with L (‘Lao’, old).

247
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,310
I dare you try similar words again.

248
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,270
Don’t worry.

249
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,190
I won’t call you older sister.

250
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,430
Lu Qingwu.

251
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,070
What?

252
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,980
Yours looks more delicious.

253
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:10,710
Let’s switch.

254
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:11,830
Piss off.

255
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,710
What a boy.

256
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,270
Prof. Ji.

257
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:45,420
Siqi’s room is not tidied up yet,

258
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,830
so I don’t think he’s left for good.

259
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,350
You never drink, don’t you?

260
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,350
I just want to all of a sudden.

261
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,590
You should wait until I leave.

262
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,350
Are you leaving?

263
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,780
I don’t live here.

264
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,270
I’m still paying the rent
for my apartment.

265
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,710
The rent is never the problem.

266
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,820
You just want to go back home soon

267
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,310
to be Siqi’s roommate, don’t you?

268
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,390
That’s not true.

269
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,190
Didn’t you want to choose him
back at the hotel?

270
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,540
That’s because you asked me to.

271
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,500
And I promised him

272
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,100
to help him realize his dream
of becoming a cartoonist.

273
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,300
You’ve promised me too.

00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,870
why don’t you get into
a healthy relationship on campus?

340
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,790
You tell me.

341
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:58,780
Who’s to blame

342
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,860
for my failure in getting
into a relationship?

343
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,070
Your idol?

344
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,910
Fanatical fans like you don’t need
a relationship, do you?

345
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,470
Cut your crap.

346
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,330
You’ve ruined every single relationship

347
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,010
I’ve had in the past.

348
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,380
Why can you get easy matches

349
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,610
like the Bluetooth

350
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:15,040
when I can only live on my imagination?

351
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,350
I want my romance back!

352
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,350
Fine.

353
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,270
Wait until you turn 20.

354
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,300
And look at our relationship.

355
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,110
Can we leave more privacy to each other?

356
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,820
You can’t just stay with me all the time

357
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,190
and not go home, can you?

358
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,990
It’s all because

359
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,270
I overestimated my imagination.

360
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,100
So now I find it really awkward

361
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,100
to see my grandpa at home.

362
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,060
He and my cousin
will definitely criticize me.

363
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:48,980
That’s not true.

364
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,540
You are the apple of your grandpa’s eye.

365
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,710
How could he be possible
to criticize you?

366
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,710
As for your cousin,

367
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,230
he’s even less possible to do so.

368
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,870
How do you know?

369
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,750
You can ask him yourself.

370
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,550
Follow me.

371
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:18,170
Hello?

372
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:20,550
Dinner?

373
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,590
No problem.

374
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,540
Don’t worry. That naughty girl.

375
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,870
I’ve sent her back home.

376
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,070
OK. See you later.

377
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,100
Men.

378
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,100
They coax you at this moment, and

379
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,830
turn to other women the next second.

380
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,280
However big a cage is,

381
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,220
it can never contain a rooster
made of water.

382
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,380
The wind is a bit noisy today.

383
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,230
I can’t hear you.

384
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:50,630
Ji Qiu,

385
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,020
we are about to be home.

386
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:52,910
Behave yourself.

387
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,550
Excuse me.

388
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:57,390
By “home”,

389
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,190
you mean…?

390
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,500
The old mansion of the Ji family.

391
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,550
It’s your first time to be there, right?

392
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,070
Are you nervous?

393
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,680
I’m OK.

394
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:30,910
Well, I’ve met

395
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:31,700
your grandpa.

396
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,140
As for your father and mother…

397
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,690
They don’t live here.

398
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,350
My parents got divorced
when I was very young.

399
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,550
Mom went to the US.

400
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,950
And then Dad went missing.

401
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,910
Why are you looking at me like this?

402
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:56,740
Nothing.

403
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,500
It’s just that your house is so spacious

404
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,790
that I’m not used to it.

405
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,510
You will get used to it.

406
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,150
Let me take over the company.

407
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,820
Siqi’s home.

408
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,790
I’ll go and say hi.

409
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:26,830
Don’t.

410
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,110
Have you had any idea
what you are talking about?

411
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,390
I do.

412
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,470
Grandpa, you’re not getting younger.

413
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,430
The family’s business needs
to be passed on.

414
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,430
Instead of bothering Yanxin,

415
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,670
I think I should
shoulder the responsibility.

416
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:44,790
He’s sacrificed enough for us after all.

417
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,710
Don’t you want to be a cartoonist?

418
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,470
I do.

419
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,950
But I also want to be like Yanxin

420
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,150
and handle the family’s affairs first

421
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,430
before chasing after my dream.

422
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:57,780
If he can contribute to the family,

423
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,790
then I can, too.

424
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,070
Siqi.

425
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,590
You finally act like a grown-up.

426
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,860
But are you stupid or something?

427
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,670
It hurts, Grandpa.

428
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:09,900
What?

429
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,390
You think you are in a soap opera?

430
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,990
We don’t have a huge amount of legacy
for you to inherit.

431
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:15,710
Besides,

432
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,830
how much do you know
about management?

433
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,260
Can you read the financial statement?

434
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:24,870
How many steps are there for IPO?

435
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,550
I’ve tried the Monopoly

436
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:29,630
and the Sims.

437
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,420
You little brat.

438
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,150
Grandpa,

439
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,950
Siqi’s just trying
to show his care for you.

440
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,510
Yanxin.

441
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,940
I’d be happy to hear this

442
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,660
if it was two years ago.

443
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,470
But it’s too late now.

444
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:44,950
Why?

445
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,750
One grandson of mine has toiled enough

446
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,030
and now you ask me to toil another one?

447
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,060
Nothing about the company

448
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,300
is more important
than my grandson’s freedom.

449
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,300
I have

450
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,990
hired a professional manager
to run the company.

451
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,870
From now on,

452
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:02,950
you can just go chase after your dreams.

453
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:04,540
But…

454
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,470
Stop.

455
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:11,030
I got no severe disease this time,

456
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,350
but I’ve realized

457
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,750
that life is very short.

458
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,820
All these years,

459
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,910
have you not been occupied
with the business,

460
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,830
we might have had the 4th generation.

461
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:25,350
To get married by 30,

462
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,540
and to have a son and a daughter

463
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,700
by 35.

464
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,030
Aren’t these your dreams
when you were in primary school?

465
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,100
Excuse me.

466
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,430
Primary school?

467
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:41,060
Second child was still forbidden
at that time, right?

468
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:41,900
Man,

469
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,350
you were really foresighted.

470
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,190
Hey, you,

471
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,550
stop laughing.

472
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,060
Fine, I’ll stop.

473
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:01,350
Seriously, it makes sense
to have two kids within 5 years.

474
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,180
My bad.

475
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:03,740
I won’t do it again.

476
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,420
I’ll stop.

477
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,310
Good day, Grandpa.

478
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,470
It’s full of joy here.

479
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:11,870
Hi, there.

480
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,470
Mr. Ji.

481
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,950
Have I arrived at a wrong time?

482
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,940
On the contrary.

483
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,230
Come here. Let me present to you

484
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,700
the newly recruited

485
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,060
professional manager,

486
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:24,950
Lin Yi.

487
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,260
Yanxin, you’ve known each other well,

488
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,390
so you need no more introduction.

489
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:32,950
It’s been a long time.

490
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,150
Long time no see, Lin.

491
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,630
Who’s she?

492
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,340
Yanxin’s senior,

493
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,630
and your potential rival in love.

494
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,350
That’s strange.

495
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,860
Didn’t that woman

496
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,020
leave for the US alone?

497
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,430
Why does she come back now?

498
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,430
If you ask me,

499
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,590
Grandpa quite likes her.

500
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,790
He even asked her to stay for dinner.

501
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,670
Grandpa has gone too far, hasn’t he?

502
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,710
He should control himself even though
he’s desperate for a great grandchild.

503
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,020
Miss Current Girlfriend,

504
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,990
do you have any comment?

505
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,820
What’s your preference for food here?

506
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,710
Sweet or salty?

507
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,660
Your rival is laughing
in front of your face

508
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,540
and you’re thinking about the food?

509
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,300
Yeah.

510
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,860
If we have different preference
for food,

511
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,860
there will be arguments
when having meals.

512
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,770
Besides,

513
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,630
I’m not Ji Yanxin’s girlfriend.

514
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:43,990
He doesn’t like ginger and scallion?

515
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,780
But I’ve put them
in several main courses.

516
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,700
What should I do?

517
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,580
What about asking Siqi to come
and sort them out together?

518
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,500
No.

519
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,990
The family rules forbid us
to be picky eaters.

520
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,540
You need to abide by the rules

521
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,990
while you also dote on your brother.

522
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:58,990
Look at you.

523
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,740
Please put the lemon aside.

524
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,870
Siqi doesn’t like it.

525
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,070
OK, fine.

526
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,380
How do you like me to cook the ribs?

527
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,550
To braise them or make them
sweet and sour?

528
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,310
I remember that you prefer
salty food, right?

529
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,430
Make them sweet.

530
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,430
He doesn’t stay for dinner every day.

531
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,630
Make them salty.

532
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,910
I’m going to the dining room.

533
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,190
I’ll leave you alone.

534
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,190
Why are you here?

535
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,230
If you can be here, why can’t I?

536
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,260
I’m not here to fight.

537
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,110
I know.

538
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,630
Well, I haven’t remained unchanged

539
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,390
in the past few years.

540
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,990
I’ve tried all things

541
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,510
that you said to be useful

542
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,470
even though I might not like them.

543
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,430
Well.

544
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,510
Then eat this.

545
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:15,460
If you don’t like it,

546
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,500
why do you push yourself?

547
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,470
As you said,

548
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,990
you never know
if you don’t push yourself.

549
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,660
God. Why don’t you learn
something good from me?

550
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,430
I want to.

551
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,700
You are not the only one that can
make sacrifices for the family.

552
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,780
I can, too.

553
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:28,830
But I don’t want you to.

554
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,470
You know why I stopped you
from being a cartoonist?

555
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,140
Unlike me,

556
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,110
you are too emotional.

557
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,390
You’ll be blind when you are keen.

558
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,110
You act to be 100% into something

559
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,670
when you only have 50%.

560
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:45,750
You think
I’m just pretending to like it?

561
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,030
The reality is usually
the best test stone.

562
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,260
You would have given up a long time ago

563
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,150
have you been pretending to like it.

564
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,830
But you keep it till now.

565
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,950
So I know you mean it.

566
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,020
Don’t you worry that I’m not gifted

567
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,100
and that I’m just wasting my time?

568
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,470
Your life is in your own hand.

569
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,110
You can do anything to it.

570
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,430
Most importantly,

571
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,590
you need to persuade yourself.

572
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,190
That still doesn’t sound
to be an approval to me.

573
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,110
You want my approval,

574
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,830
but all I want is you to be happy.

575
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,630
I don’t want you to be regretful

576
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,750
so I’ve been very tough with you.

577
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,110
You’ve suffered a lot in the past.

578
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,030
Sorry.

579
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,270
As for the toy models,

580
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,670
I’ll try to find them

581
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,950
though it might be hard
to find them all.

582
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,790
I promise that before I die,

583
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,030
I’ll…

584
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:40,990
You don’t need to.

585
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,830
I’ve got all that I want.

586
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,310
All these years,

587
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,910
I have been acting at will.

588
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,790
Sorry, Yanxin.

589
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,150
Welcome home.

590
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:13,630
I’ve never seen such a lively picture
at home for a long time.

591
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,350
What’s going on between you two?

592
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,500
Don’t look at me.

593
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,380
This is always my seat.

594
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,500
So is mine.

595
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,070
I always sit next to Qi Nian.

596
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:31,460
Grandpa,
I find this place a bit crowded.

597
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,420
I’ll move to

598
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,380
the empty seat over there.

599
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,300
Just sit here.

600
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,030
That’s right.

601
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,070
Here.

602
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,910
Have a piece of sweet and sour rib.

603
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,420
The braised pork is too greasy.

604
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,980
You want Qi Nian to gain weight?

605
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,230
Your offer is no better than mine.

606
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:47,780
Who in the kitchen just now

607
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,190
promised to care for his brother more?

608
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:50,660
And who apologize in tears

609
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,020
but is now contradicting himself?

610
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:52,620
You…

611
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,260
Are you a little boy who still

612
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,260
badgers his senior family member?

613
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,510
Qi Nian is not my family member, is she?

614
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,140
Of course she is.

615
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,710
She’s your elder brother’s girlfriend.

616
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,820
When did you have this responsibility?

617
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:02,670
I’ve never heard of it.

618
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:05,270
Isn’t she a fake girlfriend?

619
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:10,750
Have some shrimps.

620
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,230
Sorry,

621
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,550
I overheard this
when I passed by the balcony.

622
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,390
You,

623
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,750
come with me.

624
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,030
Grandpa, the truth is…

625
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,270
It’s not your business.

626
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,210
Miss Lin,

627
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:35,510
what’s this about?

628
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,550
Qiu,

629
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,020
after a long time,

630
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:40,990
you’ve become even more beautiful.

631
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:43,020
I’m a born beauty.

632
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,270
And don’t try to change the subject.

633
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,140
I read your

634
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,140
latest blog.

635
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,390
And I liked

636
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:49,830
Xianyu’s solo video.

637
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,820
You did?

638
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,420
You like Xianyu too?

639
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,030
A friend of mine is running his concert.

640
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,980
Do you want a VIP ticket?

641
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,910
Small-number seat at the font,
the standing zone.

642
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,190
With clappers.

643
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,310
Seriously?

644
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:05,980
You are an angel!

645
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,140
A beauty with a beautiful heart.

646
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,500
Generous as well.

647
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,510
Please let me have fun.

648
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,350
Explain to me.

649
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:18,870
Explain what?

650
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,100
What happened to

651
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,070
my granddaughter-in-law?

652
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,430
Is she not good enough?

653
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,470
You even use her as a shield.

654
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:28,790
She’s perfect.

655
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:30,950
Grandpa,

656
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:34,310
you really want her to be your
granddaughter-in-law?

657
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,260
You little brat!

658
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,590
What’s on your mind?

659
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:40,510
Grandpa, please go and bring Miss Lin.

660
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:41,830
What for?

661
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,190
To ignite jealousy.

662
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,030
You brat!

663
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:52,380
(Jin Xianyu’s
National Concert Tour 2019)

664
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,590
Miss Lin is really something.

665
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:57,270
How did she manage
to get such a nice seat for me?

666
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,900
She gave you a concert ticket

667
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,310
and you start to see her as a sis.

668
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,750
If she manages to help you
meet your idol,

669
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,990
will you see her as your sister-in-law?

670
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,070
If she manages to help me meet my idol,

671
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,630
I’ll call her Mom.

672
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,190
Listen to yourself!

673
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:17,820
But,

674
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,540
though I’m fanatic about my idol,

675
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:21,990
I only accept Qi Nian
as my sister-in-law.

676
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,940
After all, they are the first
dream-come-true couple

677
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:26,100
I’ve followed.

678
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,710
I can’t let them break up!

679
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,670
Your face tells me

680
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,070
that you’re gonna make a big move.

681
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,260
A fierce rival.

682
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,500
You agree, right?

683
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,460
Her shape, appearance,
air, and behaviors

684
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,820
are all of the upper class.

685
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,630
She possesses everything a heroin
of a soap opera needs.

686
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,460
If I’m a man,

687
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,780
she’ll definitely be my choice.

688
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,060
Compared to her,

689
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:55,020
I’m more like a crazy

690
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,910
easy little assistant.

691
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,260
You don’t stand any chance.

692
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,420
Just give up.

693
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:01,980
Give up?

694
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:02,460
I can give up anything

695
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,710
but Ji Yanxin.

696
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:05,980
What are you talking about?

697
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,510
I was talking about Dress
for the Beauty.

698
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,340
The Best Girls Manga prize
at the Silver Scale Awards.

699
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,270
I signed up for the event in your name.

700
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,700
I don’t care about the awards.

701
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,150
And I don’t care if I can win or not.

702
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:20,100
But my Baby Seven,

703
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,230
could you please care more
about your publicity?

704
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,980
Your print album is about
to be released.

705
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,710
It’s now the key time
to boost the sales.

706
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,820
If things end in reality,

707
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,710
life in manga will also
come to an end, right?

708
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,350
You’re right.

709
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:35,470
Your story is progressing slowly

710
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,220
because your relationship with

711
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:39,230
Ji Yanxin is not developing fast enough.

712
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,980
I gotta find you a way out

713
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:44,380
to help your relationship advance
by leaps.

714
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,510
What way out?

715
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,070
Hugging.

716
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,660
Holding hands.

717
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,470
Kissing.

718
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,140
Try every possible means to kindle his

719
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,540
romance over you.

720
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,540
Turn yourself into a bulldozer

721
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,470
to tear down his last firewall.

722
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,110
When you become his wife,

723
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:59,060
you’ll have no fear
for any rival in love.

724
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,460
It’s easy for you to say.

725
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,110
How can I find a chance to do this?

726
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,220
(Ji Qiu)
Let’s go camping this weekend.

727
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,380
(Ji Qiu)
My cousin will come too.

728
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:09,590
Camping?

729
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,180
See?

730
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,140
Here comes your chance.

731
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:12,860
Let’s go.

732
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:13,750
Where are we going?

733
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,550
The swimsuit shop.

734
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,420
I’ll find you

735
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:18,900
the hottest swimsuit.

736
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,550
Swimsuit?

737
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:38,980
This is your idea?

738
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:39,820
Yep.

739
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,220
As I haven’t checkmated yet,

740
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,910
I certainly need to keep on my efforts.

741
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,780
How will you make your efforts

742
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,670
when you bring me to a place like this?

743
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:48,620

00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,910
