No.

Isn’t it good as the appetizer?

you still owe me

Here is your face.

36
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,750
Why can’t you face me?

Well, I…

38
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,110
Good morning.

39
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,390
Morning.

40
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,880
Your clothes…

41
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,080
I can get them myself.

42
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,030
I can do it.

43
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,590
OK. I’ll go prepare the breakfast.

Stand up and cheer, baby.

47
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,400
Rongpin made a statement

48
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,840
to terminate the contract with Xiao Li.

49
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,630
We won!

50
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,880
(Rongpin Animation Culture Co., Ltd.)
The signature of Thither Cloud and

51
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,910
(Notice on the signature and copyright)
a series of disputes caused by copyright

52
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,160
(of Thither Cloud)
are indeed verified after investigation.

53
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,120
After the internal discussion
of the company,

54
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,560
we decided to remove all positions
of Xiao Li in the company

55
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,480
and reserve the right to

56
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,990
pursue legal responsibility against him.

57
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,880
Can you believe it?

58
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,630
Rongpin surrendered voluntarily!

59
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,550
Xiao Li is doomed this time.

60
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,440
Not only did he terminate his contract
with Rongpin,

61
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,560
but all the artists he had worked with

62
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,910
sued him for copyright infringement.

63
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,670
Now the platforms have blocked him.

64
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,430
The retribution comes so soon!

00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,030
What about Lu Qingwu?

66
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,860
Thanks to you,

67
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,360
people who insulted her all
felt ashamed.

68
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,830
And her lost fans have all returned.

69
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,800
I see.

70
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,550
I gotta go.

71

Bye-bye.

72
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,350
It’s all over now?

73
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,680
Next, should we discuss

74
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,430
our problem now?

75
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,470
What problem?

76
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,680
Honeymoon, and wedding.

77
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,030
Which one do you want to discuss first?

78
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,630
What?

79
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,150
You don’t want to be responsible
for last night?

80
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,040
No. Not like that.

81
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,480
I will be fully responsible.

82
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,670
I swear.

83
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:02,920
Hello.

84
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,550
Grandpa.

85
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,710
Since you were not drunk,

86
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,230
I didn’t prepare you sober-up tea.

87
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,870
Shao Zui is such a jerk.

88
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,910
He knew that I was confessing my love
while being drunk.

89
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:43,950
It tastes good.

90
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,180
(Go back home after you finish it)

91
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,870
“Go back home after you finish it”?

92
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,040
Who will say it first?

93
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,670
About what?

94
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,550
About we got married.

95
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,210
We did that before telling him.
Will he be angry?

96
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,440
I’m afraid he will pass out only because

97
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,230
of great joy.

98
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,790
Hello, Ms. Pei.

99
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,510
Mom?

100
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,790
Qi Nian,

101
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,030
you’re also here?

102
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,710
Why do you look like that?

103
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,710
I see.

104
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,880
Ever since I divorced

105
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,710
your father,

106
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,310
it’s been more than ten years,

107
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,270
I never came back here.

108
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,470
It’s still like before.

109
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,150
By the way,

110
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,360
you’re both here,

111
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,720
then I can tell you that together.

112
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,550
What are you going to say?

113
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,430
Let’s talk about it
when everyone is here.

114
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,520
You’re here.

115
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,000
Elder.

116
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,400
Grandpa.

117
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,000
Grandpa.

118
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,990
This is…

119
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,470
I called your mom here.

120
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,470
Something needs to be settled down now.

121
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,270
Where is Ji Qiu?

122
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,550
And Siqi?

123
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,800
I have been calling him

124
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,520
the whole day, but it’s powered off.

125
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,670
Have you seen him?

126
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,510
What a boy.

127
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,480
Ms. Pei, Grandpa,

128
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,630
I’ll go have a check.

129
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,750
I’ll go with her.

130
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:26,990
Have a seat.

131
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,430
You two…

132
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,230
You two…

133
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,320
You…

134
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,110
He…

135
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,430
What happened to you two?

136
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,030
Qi Nian.

137
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,750
Water.

138
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,070
I’ll go get you some.

139
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,270
What a stupid trip without plan?

140
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,600
What seeking for individuality?

141
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,920
Screw all of them!

142
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,280
I don’t want to see the world outside.

143
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,200
I just want to be at home.

144
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:15,880
That stupid chicken soup…

145
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,950
Take it to Qi Bao!

146
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,270
Siqi,

147
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,830
did you go to the Dead Sea?

148
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,340
No!

149
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,150
I just rounded the city by bike.

150
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,790
But we fell into the sea.

151
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,310
Traveling on a budget in the real world
is totally a disaster!

152
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,270
Especially when you are with
a direction blind!

153
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,910
It’s not a big deal.

154
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,550
We just went the wrong direction

155
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,830
and rode tens of kilometers more.

156
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,750
Other than the wrong direction,

157
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,070
she also got an amazing quality.

158
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,160
Whatever she said, turnover

159
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,080
or hitting the wall,
we’d definitely meet that.

160
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,640
Plus, we lost the money,

161
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,200
lost cellphone,

162
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:51,830
got flat tire,

163
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,960
and got chased
by a dog for five kilometers…

164
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,680
But, you chose

165
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,710
her yourself.

166
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,190
I know.

167
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,150
But I just want a natural death.

168
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,310
With her, I will only die young.

169
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,550
Then break up with her.

170
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,710
No.

171
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,550
Mom.

172
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,550
Look how dirty your face is.

173
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,150
Are you still going?

174
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,790
Sure.

175
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,000
Traveling with someone you love,

176
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,310
the scenery is totally different.

177
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,590
And, you know what?

178
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,630
Two people outside alone…

179
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,390
Shut up!

180
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,910
Why didn’t you take a shower?

181
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,310
Miss Lu,

182
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,230
do you have time for a talk?

183
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,230
She does.

184
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,510
Why did you push her?

185
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,280
About you and Rongpin…

186
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,390
I will never give up Siqi!

187
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,960
Alright, now put aside the matter

188
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,750
about Siqi.

189
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,830
You have an assistant called Jia, right?

190
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,590
Yeah.

191
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,390
He gave me this.

192
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,110
Evidence of Xiao Li’s dealings
with third parties.

193
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,960
You don’t even know

194
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,550
how many times he’s lied to you, do you?

195
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,440
He engraves the seal privately,

196
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,440
carries on the copyright trade

197
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,470
in your name.

198
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,750
That’s why Rongpin turned against him.

199
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,960
So, Rongpin terminated
his contract because…

200
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,400
I have done a resource replacement

201
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,550
with their senior management,

202
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,760
trying to invest more in your IP.

203
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,910
Of course they have to protect you.

204
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,000
That’s why Xiao Li held back

205
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,030
from taking actions.

206
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,480
Ms. Pei, you did this just for me…

207
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,830
I did that for my son.

208
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:06,430
Alright.

209
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,320
I have finished

210
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,150
what I want to say.

211
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,880
You just said that

212
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,430
you would never give up Siqi.

213
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,310
Is it sincere?

214
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,640
Yes.

215
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,800
Then how can I believe that

216
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,910
you’re not on a whim?

217
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,910
Please entrust your son to me.

218
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,280
You are…?

219
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:24,910
Proposing.

220
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,760
Although he is still two years away
from legal marriage age,

221
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,000
I can wait for him.

222
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,960
No matter whether you

223
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,710
will agree or not,

224
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,750
anyway,

225
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,430
he will be mine.

226
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:34,300
Well,

227
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,400
I think you’re not making a proposal.

228
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,830
You’re like robbing me of my son.

229
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,950
Thank you for raising him.

230
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,950
But from now on, he is mine.

231
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,470
That’s really straightforward.

232
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,430
Lu Qingwu!

233
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,950
You… What did you say?

234
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,430
I didn’t say it wrong.

235
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,910
You are mine anyway.

236
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,680
That’s what I should say.

237
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,640
That’s what I should say.

238
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,240
No.

239
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,590
It’s what the two of us should say.

240
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,150
Alright. Alright.

241
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,200
Since everyone is here,

242
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,270
I have one thing to tell you guys.

243
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,270
The marriages also have order.

244
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,110
No matter what,

245
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,470
you should wait until I have my wedding.

246
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,990
What?

247
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,630
Wait, Mom.

248
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,110
Whose wedding?

249
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,270
Mine.

250
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,390
With whom?

251
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,790
With your step father in the future.

252
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,400
Mom,

253
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,320
there isn’t any diamonds on your ring.

254
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,720
It’s even worse than the one
my father gave you.

255
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,470
You brat.

256
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,310
Nonsense!

257
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,560
Wait…

258
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:52,920
Grandpa,

259
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,880
you are here?

260
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,000
Your daughter-in-law is remarrying!

261
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,950
Why are you still…?

262
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,430
Mom, are you serious?

263
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,150
Yanxin,

264
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,110
you have to accept it.

265
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,390
Mr. Ji,

266
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,230
will you bless me?

267
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,550
Congratulations.

268
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,560
Go and keep him company.

269
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,190
I’m going.

270
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,600
Don’t just stand there and look.

271
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,230
Do you want to learn?

272
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,670
Come here.

273
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,790
You really like making tea.

274
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,310
My dad likes it.

275
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,150
Then you must have a good relationship
with him.

276
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,830
Just the opposite.

277
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,960
To him,

278
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,310
I don’t need too many emotions.

279
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,870
I just need to be obedient.

280
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,680
Emotion is something

281
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,680
without power.

282
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,830
It will only become the stumbling block
to my progress.

283
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,750
This is what he always said.

284
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,600
It sounds ridiculous.

285
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,190
But before I was 20,

286
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,390
I really believed it.

287
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,670
When you were 20…

288
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,360
Is that the year when

289
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,870
that accident happened in your family?

290
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,200
Rather than an accident,

291
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,550
it’s more like a collapse of faith.

292
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,390
I never expected that

293
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,070
the man I held up as a benchmark

294
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,310
would suddenly disappear one day.

295
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,150
Since then, I lost my goal in my life,

296
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,600
and I could only live my life

297
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,200
in my own way

298
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,070
as abnormal as I am now.

299
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,630
You’re not abnormal.

300
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,000
You’re just a little weird,

301
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,110
untruthful,

302
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,390
a little scheming,

303
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,190
and a little possessive.

304
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,790
Are you praising me?

305
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,390
Of course.

306
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,000
I’ll say what your father

307
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,030
didn’t say for him.

308
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,720
You are the most wonderful person

309
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,910
I have ever met in the world.

310
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,840
Marrying you

311
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,710
is a blessing in my eight lifetimes,

312
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,150
and the most successful thing
I’ve ever done.

313
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,310
You’re pretty good at praising.

314
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:30,950
I like it.

315
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,270
Thanks to you,

316
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,830
I feel better now.

317
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,680
So you’re not happy today because

318
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,830
Ms. Pei said she’s getting married?

319
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,390
Yes.

320
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,710
But now I let it go.

321
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,960
We don’t have to be together

322
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,750
to be a family.

323
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,670
Now I only wish my father

324
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,150
can be in peace and good health.

325
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,070
One day,

326
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,640
I will take you to see him

327
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,590
and tell him…

328
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,270
Tell him what?

329
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,670
You will know when we meet him.

330
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,790
Where are you going?

331
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,750
It depends on where you will go.

332
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,480
Do you want to know where I’m going

333
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,870
and stay away from me?

334
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,710
Why bother to ask since you know it?

335
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,030
Have you regained your sense of taste?

336
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,880
Are you going to go away

337
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,280
and leave me alone here

338
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,150
after you get well?

339
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,070
Girl,

340
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,760
why are you sitting

341
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,520
on my trunk?

342
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,470
What do you want to do?

343
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,030
To be your impedimenta.

344
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,270
You have carried me for more than
ten years anyway.

345
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:46,790
How childish.

346
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,920
Shao Zui! What are you doing?

347
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,680
I even gave up being a human being.

348
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,390
How could you…?

349
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,630
What are you doing?

350
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,790
Pack up my impedimenta.

351
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,310
Didn’t you say it?

352
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,470
I have carried you for years.

353
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,070
I’m not used to leaving you behind.

354
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:16,870
Let’s go.

355
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,390
Hold on tight.

356
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,520
Let’s have deal first.

357
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,630
I won’t travel on a budget.

358
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,120
Of course.

359
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,350
Isn’t traveling just for spending money?

360
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:33,980
(Igloo Western Restaurant)

361
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,550
This is the restaurant you said?

362
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,440
The boss here is really nice

363
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,960
and the food is delicious.

364
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,400
I want him to make

365
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,630
our wedding cake.

366
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,230
Let’s get in and see.

367
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,430
Gosh, it’s so cute!

368
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,150
Isn’t that my voice?

369
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,550
I think this one is cuter.

370
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,270
Why do you come to the pet store
to get the material?

371
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,030
Because I love one of the cats.

372
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:58,990
This one?

373
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,190
This one.

374
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:06,950
I don’t believe it.

375
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,230
You must find a stand-in.

376
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,830
He will never say something like that.

377
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,520
He wouldn’t before.

378
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,070
But he got the hang of it after he met
the one he loves.

379
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,790
Everyone is like this.

380
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,150
Just like someone

381
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,360
who pestered me,

382
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,600
making overseas calls

383
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,590
and crying to make up with me.

384
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,470
Are you hungry?

385
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,990
Let me make a bowl of noodles for you.

386
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,470
That’s really a blunt turn.

387
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,320
Boss,

388
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,470
you and Ms. Pei…

389
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,950
You are getting married?

390
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,120
He is a very kind person.

391
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,190
He will definitely treat Ms. Pei well.

392
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,190
Don’t you want to say anything,

393
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:05,830
Dad?

394
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,470
Dad?

395
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:16,950
So you’ve been

396
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,920
at home all these years except for

397
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,030
the first two years abroad?

398
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,600
Even less than ten minutes

399
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,680
from our house,

400
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,030
I didn’t even know it!

401
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,040
You hated men cooking, didn’t you?

402
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,030
Why are you a chef now?

403
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,550
It’s because your mom loves it.

404
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,190
It was you who initiated the divorce.

405
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,950
Can’t I regret it?

406
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,070
Men’s perception

407
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,590
of breakups comes later.

408
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,390
So that year you suddenly

409
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,680
disappeared because

410
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,590
you went to find your ex-wife back?

411
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,590
That’s true.

412
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,800
Why are there people like you?

413
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,080
You said emotions were useless.

414
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,470
But then you were carried away by them.

415
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,030
I’m not carried away by emotions.

416
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,830
I just found out that

417
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,390
I had been living like a lie,

418
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,950
which looks like has no flaw,

419
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,510
but is full of holes actually.

420
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,390
Now your weird characteristic like this

421
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,710
might be misled by me back then.

422
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,030
It may be a little late to say this,

423
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,310
but actually,

424
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,270
you’ve always been the son
I’m proud of.

425
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,750
You don’t need a benchmark.

426
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,310
You don’t need anyone to set you rules.

427
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,670
You can become a successful man

428
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,270
even if you just live the life you like.

429
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,230
I used to be too harsh on you

430
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,510
and did many things that hurt you.

431
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,470
I’m sorry.

432
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,310
Don’t bother.

433
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,630
Because I also did the same thing

434
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:11,950
to Siqi.

435
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:19,910
That is to say,

436
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,230
we are two of a kind.

437
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,910
I can’t believe you’re getting married

438
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,160
when we meet again.

439
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,230
That’s also what I want to say.

440
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,110
Your fiancée is very cute.

441
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,750
Being with you

442
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,510
is a pity.

443
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,110
This is exactly what I want to say.

444
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,030
Why are you staring at me?

445
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,470
You don’t want to marry me?

446
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,350
That’s enough.

447
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,880
That’s right.

448
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,720
You’re not marriageable yet.

449
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,470
Don’t be out of line.

450
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,430
You have the certificate, so what?

451
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,110
It’s just two years.

452
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,350
I can wait.

453
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,270
I’ll go to change it.

454
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,030
Wait a moment.

455
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,230
Excuse me!

456
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,920
I want this one, too.

457
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,640
OK.

458
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,150
Why bother to buy so many
wedding dresses?

459
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,830
My baby likes it.

460
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,830
I’ll buy it for cosplay.

461
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,320
Don’t cause trouble to our main couple,

462
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:57,840
you know?

463
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,160
You two are also not the main couple.

464
00:23:59,240 --> 00:23:59,910
Siqi.

465
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:01,750
Yanxin.

466
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:03,910
Boss,

467
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,800
you’re finally here.

468
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,230
Mrs. Ji has been waiting for long.

469
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,630
He hasn’t arrived?

470
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,550
Not yet.

471
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:36,920
Coming!

472
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,670
He is coming!

473
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,430
Yes!

474
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:44,830
How do I look?

475
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,590
This is for you.

476
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,190
Now you know how to be romantic?

477
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,870
So, I want to ask…

478
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,710
What is our real bride doing?

479
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:26,420
(ENDING)

480
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,390
Finally it’s finished.

481
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,520
Happy ending!

482
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,150
Happy ending!

483
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,390
Congratulations!

484
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,960
Congratulations on your success
in drawing Dress for the Beauty.

485
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,630
Good job.

486
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,720
Thank you, Director.

487
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,470
Thank you, guys.

488
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,320
Then work harder

489
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,590
for the next plan.

490
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,560
All our readers are looking forward

491
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,520
to the married life.

492
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,240
Right?

493
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,040
Yes!

494
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:56,680
Right!

495
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,800
I will work hard to produce it.

496
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,720
Alright,

497
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,440
Baby Seven has said it.

498
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,840
Now let’s announce that

499
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,920
the promotion of the side story
starts now!

500
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,480
Alright,

501
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,440
let’s get back to work.

502
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,120
OK.

503
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,120
OK.

504
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,000
-Congratulations.
-Let’s go.

505
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,480
Come on.

506
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,310
Let’s go.

507
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,480
Your hero and heroine

508
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,600
have got married in the comic.

509
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,360
Don’t lose to them.

510
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,950
Put the wedding on the agenda
as soon as possible.

511
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,200
How could I lose to them?

512
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:21,870
I will go right now.

513
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:28,670
♪Yet I’m still confused♪

514
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,190

just for one second at this intersection♪

515
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:34,960
Hello.

516
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,520
Welcome.

517
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,190
Hello.

00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,240
Where are they?

519
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,630
Have they left already?

520
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,680
Hello,

521
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,070
are you Ms. Qi Nian?

522
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,150
Yes, I am.

523
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,960
Your wedding dress is ready.

524
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,630
Please come with me.

525
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,630
It fits you well.

526
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,070
Your husband does have a good taste.

527
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,960
Ji Yanxin chose this?

528
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,600
Where is he?

529
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,640
Is he changing the clothes?

530
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,320
He went outside.

531
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,310
Please wait a moment.

532
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,150
By the way, Ms. Qi,

533
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,550
I think this letter is for you.

534
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:12,840
For me?

535
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:13,510
Yes.

536
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,710
July 9.

537
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,510
It’s from three months ago?

538
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,510
I think it might be a slow mail.

539
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:24,910
Slow mail?

540
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,880
It’s all high-speed information now.

541
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,310
Who would do this…?

542
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,940
(Self-criticism)

543
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,790
Self-criticism?

544
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,270
Here is my written self-criticism.

545
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,270
It was that day.

546
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,150
From that day to now…

547
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,070
Exactly 100 days.

548
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,960
What did Ji Yanxin

549
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,670
want to tell me 100 days ago?

550
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,040
July 9.

551
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,360
I want to get married

552
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,150
with you.

553
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,630
Here you are.

554
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:29,710
Mr. Ji.

555
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,470
You have read the letter?

556
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:39,430
You wanted to get married long ago?

557
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,670
Yes.

558
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,430
It’s so beautiful.

559
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:02,910
Wait.

560
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,120
What about the steps before
wearing the ring?

561
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,390
I think something is missing.

562
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:08,710
What is it?

563
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,470
You have to say something.

564
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,160
I have written it in the letter.

565
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,080
No.

566
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,590
Something else.

567
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,310

568
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:19,710

569
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,520
No!

570
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,880
I mean the sense of ceremony!

571
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,920
You have to ask if I want to marry you.

572
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,320
You never asked about my opinion.

573
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,360
How could you settle this down

574
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,790
without asking me?

575
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,950
Hello, honey,

576
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,600
I got something nice

577
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,910

578

579
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,110
Mr. Ji,

come and have a look.

581
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,150

00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,750

You’re getting married.

588
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,510
Do you have anything to say?

589
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,310
Dad,

590
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,350
I will never divorce her.

591
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,870
What are you talking about?

592
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,950
I’ll definitely be with Qi Nian forever.

593
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,200
What if she makes mistakes?

594
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,150
Forgive her, of course.

595
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,120
She loves someone else?

596
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:35,880
Forgive her.

597
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,840
She cheats on you?

598
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,600
Forgive her.

599
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,230

600
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,470
Shut up.

601

Yanxin,

603
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,790
is she that important?

604
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,150
You can’t live without her?

605
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,750
Not really.

606
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,870
If without her,

607
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,710
I can still have a normal life.

608
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,670
I can still take good care of myself.

609
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,030
But a life like that

610
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,870
is not a real life at all.

611
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,110
She will be my beginning

612
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,830
and also my destination.

613
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,150
