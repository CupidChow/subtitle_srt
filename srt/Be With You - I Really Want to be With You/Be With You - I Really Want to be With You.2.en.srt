I’ll have them put together

21
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,720
profiles of guests at the symposium.

22
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,240
Thanks.

23
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,080
There will be a huge crowd.

24
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,600
You got this?

25
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:48,800
I’ll do my best.

26
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,280
It’s open!

27
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,920
How did she do that?

28
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,800
-She did it!
-What did she do?

29
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,080
I didn’t see it.

30
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,560
Let me check.

31
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,160
Professor.

32
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,120
I...

33
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:16,720
Come with me.

34
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,040
Is that what you drew in class?

35
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,400
What else do you expect, Professor?

36
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,720
Was my lecture too simple,

37
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,120
or useless to you?

38
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,520
Or are you interested in something else?

39
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:34,860
Such as?

40
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:36,840
You tell me.

41
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,240
It’s accurate.

42
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,640
Right? Yeah?

43
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,440
I, uh...

44
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,680
I swear I mean

45
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,760
no disrespect to you.

46
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,920
My mind is pure.

47
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,680
What’s this?

48
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,560
Is it your memory card?

49
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,360
No. It’s... It’s not mine.

50
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,160
I don’t know whose it is.

51
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,400
Nice photos.

52
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,680
That’s my objective view.

53
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,960
I didn’t take them either.

54
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,680
I have no idea who did it.

55
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,120
You’re innocent.

56
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,680
And your mind is pure.

57
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,320
Absolutely. I didn’t take them.

58
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,640
And I’m into abs and collarbones.

59
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,840
Going straight to the face

60
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,080
is so not my style.

61
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,680
Fine. That aside,

62
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,680
tell me

63
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,880
how you opened this box.

64
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,800
I just did it.

65
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,960
There are three ways in general.

66
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,400
Horizontal, vertical and rotary.

67
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,000
Which one did you use?

68
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,080
None of them.

69
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,840
This box is in the style
of the ancients

70
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,720
who were completely different from us.

71
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,880
The opening

72
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,360
was set at a 45-degree angle.

73
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,840
So push it like this,

74
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,600
and voila!

75
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,720
Who taught you that?

76
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,720
My dad is an
ancient architecture restorer.

77
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,840
I had tons of these at home.

78
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,440
I played with them when I was little.

79
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,720
Do you know there’s a prize?

80
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,200
Sort of.

81
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,280
So what do you want?

82
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,320
Can I ask for anything?

83
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,520
As long as it’s not illegal

84
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,600
or against

85
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,160
my will.

86
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,240
All I’m asking for

87
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,640
is to see you

88
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,120
and be close to you every day.

89
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,840
So you want to be my TA?

90
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,800
Are you a student here?

91
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,400
TA?

92
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,360
Yes. That’s what I’m here for.

93
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,640
Put your photo on it.

94
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,880
(Employee Card Chunming University)
Come to my office tomorrow.

95
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,280
Is it that easy?

96
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,600
Is it?

97
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,160
Is it not?

98
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,720
Or are there any special requests?

99
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,600
I hope you can still think the same

100
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,600
next week.

101
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,200
Don’t be late
for your first day at work,

102
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,480
TA.

103
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,320
In this case,

104
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,080
not only have you found him,

105
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,080
but you’ve also become his TA?

106
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,520
Unbelievable, right?

107
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,280
It’s surreal to me, too.

108
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,400
I still don’t believe it.

109
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,320
How did that thumb drive
get into your pocket?

110
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,040
I don’t know.

111
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,480
At least, it’s working.

112
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,240
His charm has already changed you.

113
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,480
See?

114
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,120
Even your stroke is tender.

115
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,040
Don’t forget

116
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,920
to create a romantic background.

117
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,160
I haven’t overcome my old habits.

118
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,600
On the bright side, you can draw

119
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,600
an ideal hero of romantic comics.

120
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,440
Let me get you

121
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:28,960
an assistant

122
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,840
to fix your rough taste.

123
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,680
I need someone

124
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,080
who understands girls

125
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,400
ASAP.

126
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:37,240
Who drew that?

127
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,280
That’s lovely.

128
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,920
A girl next door who just moved in.

129
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,440
Sometimes,

130
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,680
she’d draw in the living room.

131
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,040
These are incredible.

132
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,520
Maybe she’s a pro.

133
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,840
Why don’t you ask her for help?

134
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,920
Since she moved in last month,

135
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,240
I haven’t seen her once.

136
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,200
What could I do?

137
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,840
If so,

138
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,920
how did you know it’s a girl?

139
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,000
Come. Let me show you something.

140
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,480
Follow me.

141
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,920
Come.

142
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,470
Look. See?

143
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,840
That’s a lot!

144
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,240
There’s more in the room.

145
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,280
Would a boy have so many toys

146
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,000
and hang them on the balcony?

147
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,720
There’s more.

148
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,280
Come with me.

149
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:24,880
Be prepared.

150
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,400
Get ready.

151
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,320
(Macaron Mousse Cake)
She has a sweet tooth, too.

152
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,800
Check these out.

153
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,200
Cute figures.

154
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,840
Pink stickers.

155
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,960
And those

156
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,120
glittering stuff.

157
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,800
Most importantly,

158
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,320
she’s a scrapbook aficionado.

159
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,760
So,

160
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,160
basically,

161
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,280
everything that’s cute in this room

162
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,440
is hers.

163
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,560
Were I a man,

164
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,560
I’d surely marry her.

165
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,320
Agreed.

166
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,160
What a shame!

167
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,880
Were you

168
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,400
half as girly

169
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,120
as her,

170
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,120
that’d be bliss!

171
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,000
So,

172
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,280
what to do tomorrow?

173
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,360
Just take whatever may come.

174
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,000
You know the drill.

175
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,240
What is it?

176
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,600
Tears and fists.

177
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,160
Care to elaborate?

178
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:34,880
I mean...

179
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,440
Bring it on.

180
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,640
I dare you.

181
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,560
I got it.

182
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,560
You missed. You missed.

183
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,940
(YIYAN OFFICE)

184
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,720
Say what you have to say.

185
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,640
I heard someone opened your box,

186
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,680
and you have a new TA.

187
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,920
Who told you that?

188
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,680
It’s all over the school chat group.

189
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,280
Don’t give me that look.

190
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,160
Ji Qiu got me in.

191
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,800
It’s gone viral this afternoon.

192
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,040
I’m sick of it, too, OK?

193
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,760
Now, back to business.

194
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,160
This is the first TA you’ve ever hired.

195
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,920
Is she that good?

196
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,400
She’s OK.

197
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,560
But she caught a perfect timing.

198
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,920
How long can she do it

199
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,640
depends on her.

200
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:37,960
Doesn’t that depend on you?

201
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,040
Had you

202
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,200
lowered your bar a little bit,

203
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,760
you wouldn’t have fired a dozen TAs

204
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,760
within a month.

205
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,240
My rule is simple

206
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,320
as long as I can remember her name.

207
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:49,840
Is it that hard?

208
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,600
Do you know

209
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,480
what my name is?

210
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,920
We’ve known each other for a decade.

211
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,440
I’m your partner and best friend.

212
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,880
What’s my name?

213
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:08,840
(C₂H₅OH)
Shao Zui.

214
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,200
Thank you

215
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,720
for going to such
great length to remember it.

216
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,280
Name is a meaningless code.

217
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,160
I care more about one’s nature.

218
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,360
What’s this?

219
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,600
Why am I a molecular formula?

220
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,080
C₂H₅OH,

221
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,000
also known as ethanol,

222
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,920
little water, high alcohol content,
and toxic,

223
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,240
as your name Shao Zui suggests.

224
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,880
Do you have to make it so complicated?

225
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,680
I can recognize you.

226
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,080
I just don’t remember your name.

227
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,520
A formula can be derived,

228
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,520
but not the name based on the person.

229
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,720
Without some kind of association,

230
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,400
I can’t remember it at all.

231
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:44,800
Not to mention

232
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,720
I can’t care less

233
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,560
about others.

234
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,880
Why should I keep them in mind?

235
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,240
In terms of that rule of yours,

236
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,560
to make you remember the name,

237
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,440
can’t you see

238
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,720
it’s a mission...

239
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,200
Impossible?

240
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,600
What about the symposium?

241
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,920
Most guests go way back

242
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,120
with your grandpa.

243
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,240
They’ve been watching you grow up.

244
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,760
What if you forget their names?

245
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,080
That’ll be utterly embarrassing.

246
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,120
Is your new TA smart enough?

247
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,640
Why does she live like a lady

248
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,000
while I an animal?

249
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,040
Who left the lid up?

250
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,340
(Chunming University)

251
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,480
Morning, Prof. Ji.

252
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,480
I’ve checked

253
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,440
the schedule.

254
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,200
All your classes

255
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,360
are marked red.

256
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,320
On Wednesday,

257
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,560
you have an open class
on Introduction to Architecture,

258
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,280
History of Chinese Ancient Architecture
in the afternoon.

259
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,160
And your assessment of students’ design.

260
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:05,960
Prof. Ji.

261
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,640
Professor, I...

262
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,240
I’m...

263
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:12,920
Your ID number?

264
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,480
852617.

265
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,160
OK. 852617.

266
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,240
I’ll only say this once.

267
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:21,760
In this week,

268
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,200
your work includes but not limited to

269
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,760
copying files,

270
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:26,840
Copying files,

271
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,480
scheduling classes,

272
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,360
scheduling classes,

273
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,360
making slides for meetings,

274
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:29,920
making slides for meetings,

275
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,160
searching and borrowing books,

276
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,680
collecting and analyzing data,

277
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,440
updating web pages,

278
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:33,840
updating web pages,

279
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,520
and organizing office files.

280
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,120
Hold on, Professor.

281
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,040
Let me count first.

282
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,800
One, two...

283
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,720
And most importantly,

284
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,160
assisting me in completing the files

285
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,000
for publishing at the symposium.

286
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,880
Any questions?

287
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,280
Yes. Why are you giving me a week?

288
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,480
I can only tolerate others for so long.

289
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,520
Why don’t you call me by my name

290
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,480
but the ID number?

291
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,320
To me,

292
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,040
names and numbers

293
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,440
are equally meaningless.

294
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,560
I can use any of them

295
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,440
because they’re the same.

296
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,240
No, they’re not.

297
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,520
Look, I can call you

298
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,280
Prof. Ji,

299
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,120
or Yanxin, Xinxin, Xiaoyan,

300
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,720
Axin, Xiaoyan, Xiaoxin,

301
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,800
Xinxin, Xiao...

302
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,360
She’s annoying!

303
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,960
Can’t that woman go away?

304
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,040
What do you

305
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,600
want me to call you?

306
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,120
Qi... Qi Nian.

307
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:28,720
Means seven?

308
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,960
You’re a five to me.

309
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,160
Why?

310
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,320
You don’t need to know.

311
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,360
Anyway,

312
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:36,880
if I still

313
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,280
remember your name next week,

314
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:38,920
you can stay.

315
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,200
Does that mean

316
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,080
I can friend you on WeChat then?

317
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,920
No.

318
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,800
No WeChat.

319
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,720
Then Weibo, Zhihu,

320
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,360
Douban, Instagram, Twitter...

321
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:46,920
Still no.

322
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,120
Make 50 copies

323
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,680
of the file I gave you

324
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,240
before my next class.

325
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:54,680
Understand?

326
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,000
Yes.

327
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,920
He looks the best alone.

328
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:19,200
Or I have to remove that woman.

329
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:20,760
Hi.

330
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,200
Are you having fun?

331
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,000
Shao Zui, you rat!

332
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,480
Is this how you use

333
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,200
your 18-year-old birthday gift?

334
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,720
A nice camera

335
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,040
is designed to take nice photos.

336
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,080
I have good taste.

337
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,520
So you started my fan club

338
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,200
on the school forum?

339
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,160
Yeah. You know, all those photos

340
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,200
had been booked

341
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,480
a week ago.

342
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,400
Albums and souvenirs

343
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,720
are so in demand.

344
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,040
I’m taking this away.

345
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:00,680
No. Please don’t.

346
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,800
My whole month of funds

347
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,840
to support my star is in it.

348
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,320

I didn’t mean to do that.

521
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,600
Please forgive me.

522
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,040
No. Go away.

523
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,800
Please.

524
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,120
Can’t you just forgive me?

525
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,640
Only if you say sorry first.

526
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,520
Forget it. Never mind.

527
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,200
Wait.

528
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,560
You can have it back

529
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,440
after explaining the whole thing.

530
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,600
Other than snapping photos secretly,

531
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,440
why did you set me up?

532
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,520
It wasn’t my fault.

533
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,120
You were the one who got caught.

534
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:56,920
Besides,

535
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,600
I was taking photos of a family member.

536
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,520
That was nothing illegal.

537
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,440
A family member?

538
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,280
You probably don’t know

539
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:09,680
that I’m Ji Yanxin’s younger cousin.

540
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,720
That’s even better.

541
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,040
Since you two are related,

542
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,120
I need information about him.

543
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,440
What?

544
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,200
I mean,

545
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,400
how can I quickly leave
an impression on him?

546
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,280
How can I make him remember my name?

547
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,000
In your dreams!

548
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,240
Is that so? Ciao.

549
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,560
What are you doing?

550
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,000
What are you doing?

551
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,600
Are you threatening me?

552
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,200
Listen,

553
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,040
reputation means the most to my cousin.

554
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,520
I’ll hire others to speak ill of you

555
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,800
and spread rumors online.

556
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,400
What did you say?

557
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,200
Spread rumors online.

558
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:45,760
And?

559
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,320
Speak ill of you.

560
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,000
And?

561
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Reputation means the most to my cousin.

562
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,720
Bingo! Thank you.

563
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,760
I know I can count on you,

564
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,560
cousin.

565
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,780
Bye, sweetie!

What’s going on?

567
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,040

574
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,240
Please thank Qi Nian for us.

575
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:12,880
Yes.

576
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,160
She’s great,

577
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,720
the best TA ever.

578
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,960
Do convey our gratitude to her.

579
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,560
Qi Nian is so sweet.

580
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,200
Indeed.

581
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,320
Welcome back, Prof. Ji.

582
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:26,840
Thanks.

583
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,000
Well,

584
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,680
can you take this herbal tea

585
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,840
to Qi Nian?

586
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,440
Honestly,

587
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,320
Qi Nian

588
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,760
is such a wonderful girl.

589
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,640
Prof. Ji,

590
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,320
if you two

591
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,640
are together,

592
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,040
I’ll be so happy for you.

593
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,920
Take this, Professor.

594
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,440
Thank you.

595
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,960
Hello, Prof. Ji.

596
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:57,690
Sir.

597
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,610
Thank you for filling in for me.

Don’t mention it.

00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,320
Your TA Qi Nian

601
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,920
has already

602
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,840
completed everything.

603
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,800
Who?

604
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,360
Qi Nian.

605
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,520
That’s her name, right?

606
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,680
(Teachers’ Office)
She’s a fast learner.

607
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,280
While you were away,

608
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,200
she was quite helpful.

609
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,800
Don’t forget to thank her.

Hello, Prof. Ji.

613
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,000
I’m here to return the sketchbook

614
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,200
I borrowed from Qi Nian.

615
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,680
Please thank her for me.

616
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,040
This is...

617
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,520
A collection of ancient buildings.

618
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,960
It took Qi Nian three days
to finish them all

619
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,760

must be able to draw,

622

but Qi Nian’s sketches

623
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,800
are excellent.

624
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,910
I haven’t seen students better than her.

625
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,120
She doesn’t seem to be
an architecture student,

626
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,320
but an art student.

627

The current one.

638
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,680
Sorry, I suddenly forgot her name.

639
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:49,920
Prof. Ji,

640
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,000
what’s her surname?

641
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,160
I’ll contact her myself.

642
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,520
Welcome back, Prof. Ji.

643
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:30,590
I’ve finished

644
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,510
all your assignments.

645
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,280
I know.

646
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:35,850
How well did I do?

647
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,080
Very well,

648
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:38,880
but

649
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:40,870
you still get an F.

650
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,640
Why?

651
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,320
Your bestie is trying so hard.

652
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,440
Aren’t you worried?

653
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:51,920
I am,

654
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,080
but I’m worried about her target.

655
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,360
Why?

656
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,920
Do you remember
that broken Transformer figure

657
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,520
you had when you were little?

658
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,360
Qi Nian broke it, didn’t she?

659
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:05,800
Back then,

660
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,120
she searched all over the city,

661
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:08,800
and eventually,

662
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,720
found one in a counter.

663
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,240
But it wasn’t for sale.

664
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,640
Then

665
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,600
she went there

666
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,080
and waited outside every single day

667
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,040
regardless of the weather

668
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,760
and just stared at it.

669
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,360
In the end, the owner gave in
and sold it to her.

670
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,800
Since then,

671
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,360
I’ve realized

672
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,880
she’s the most thick-skinned

673
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,920
and tenacious person I’ve ever known.

674
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,560
Now that Qi Nian has eyes on Ji Yanxin,

675
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,360
victory is practically sealed.

676
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,160
Never did he expect

677
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,040
that she’d be so persistent.

678
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,240
Can you put away the umbrella?

679
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,840
Why are you mad, Professor?

680
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,320
I’m not mad.

681
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,560
Then why did you

682
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,640
give me an F?

683
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,080
I literally gave it my all.

684
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,120
That’s the reason.

685
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,320
You’re a TA.

686
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,400
Why did you try so hard?

687
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,040
I didn’t do much.

688
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,840
The minute I entered the building,

689
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,360
people kept bringing up your name,

690
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,640
from the janitor to the Dean.

691
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,520
They almost talked my ear off.

692
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,320
You did so much

693
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,960
just so I could remember your name.

694
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,040
How would I believe

695
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:35,880
you didn’t do much?

696
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,360
Prof. Ji,

697
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,480
are my efforts paid off?

698
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,320
(Locker Room)

699
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,360
(Locker Room)
Everyone has left.

700
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,360
What about me?

701
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,480
All my clean clothes are inside.

702
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,400
There’s no clothing store nearby.

703
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,320
Come with me.

704
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,000
Prof. Ji,

705
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,160
it’s out of the office hour.

706
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,560
Staff members have left.

707
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,600
Is it appropriate for us to be alone?

708
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,600
Can I go inside with you?

709
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,560
You’re already in.

710
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,040
I’m sorry.

711
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,400
I swear that’s definitely

712
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,520
not my intention.

713
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,320
I don’t want us to be alone at all.

714
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,320
Why should we hide?

715
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:13,920
What do you think?

716
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:30,680
Go get changed.

717
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,480
You mean together?

718
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:58,940
(Be brave and go for it)

719
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,640
That’s so you.

720
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,340
(Be brave and go for it)

721
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,160
If only I could see it.

722
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,720
I could draw better.

723
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,880
I... I’m sorry.

724
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,800
This is an accident.

725
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,560
I swear on my reputation.

726
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,720
Not convincing at all.

727
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,320
Professor,

728
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,320
have you already remembered my name

729
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,520
but refused to admit it?

730
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,080
You don’t like me?

731
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,520
Or even if I made it,

732
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,760
you still wouldn’t acknowledge it?

733
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,480
The result doesn’t matter.

734
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,120
I care more...

735
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:11,880
About your motive.

736
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,320
Say it.

737
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,280
