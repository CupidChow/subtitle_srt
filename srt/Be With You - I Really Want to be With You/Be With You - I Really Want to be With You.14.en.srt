20
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,640
Hello, here we are at the sea side.

21
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,200
We’re here to see the sea.

22
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,200
The sky.

23
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,560
The beach.

24
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,880
Unsorted garbage.

25
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,120
Mr. Loser who has nothing to do.

26
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,280
When will Qi Nian come?

27
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,040
Now.

28
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,840
Let’s interview hotshot Loser.

29
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,040
I want to say,

30
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,120
there would have been only two couples.

31
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,960
Why would you come to be the extra one?

32
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,960
How do you like watching them?

33
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,040
I might enjoy it.

34
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,440
I’ll follow wherever Qi Nian goes.

35
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,640
I’ll definitely not let

36
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,440
Qi Nian be out of my sight.

37
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,040
Siqi,

38
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:30,760
do you want to play?

39
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:31,920
A plane?

40
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:39,040
Hey.

41
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,360
Where are you, Qi Nian?

42
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,400
Okay, I’m coming for you.

43
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,560
I knew it when a reserved guy
becomes passionate,

44
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,520
the silly ones won’t have a chance.

45
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,760
Ji smells a sense of crisis.

46
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,480
Yes.

47
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,760
Anybody can tell.

48
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,440
Who does Ji Siqi like?

49
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,480
Only herself isn’t aware of it.

50
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,520
If I like somebody,

51
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,640
I’d make it obvious.

52
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,760
It won’t be like them,

53
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,280
flirting a lot with all the time wasted.

54
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,560
If you like someone, you go for it.

55
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,040
Go for what?

56
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
You’re just a little kid,

57
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,760
don’t copy them to be in love.

58
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,040
Love is a game designed
for adults like us.

59
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,310
Hello.

60
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,800
I’m here.

61
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,760
Where are you?

62
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,880
I’m behind you.

63
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,120
Is it working?

64
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,120
Is it true that all men

65
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,280
like this kind of dresses?

66
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,040
Come here.

67
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,200
Prof. Ji.

68
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,560
Change a pair of shoes

69
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,440
next time you wear something like these.

70
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,160
Got it.

71
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,680
Why’d you wear a dress?

72
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,160
I wanted to catch your attention,

73
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,560
seems like it didn’t work out.

74
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,080
Not entirely.

75
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,080
But,

76
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,640
you still need to work on it.

77
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,880
Who did it?

78
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,360
It’s you.

79
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,120
It’s you.

80
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,640
How come you didn’t stay
at home and paint

81
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,440
but came here to travel?

82
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,960
Are the cartoonists
getting paid too easily?

83
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,480
It’s a difficult world.

84
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,480
I only earn a few hundred times more

85
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,200
than an infamous cartoonist.

86
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,440
What can I do?

87
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,160
Plus,

88
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,800
a big company like Rongpin

89
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,600
has to suffer
from a monthly colleague gathering.

90
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,680
You guys from MC won’t understand.

91
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,880
I’m tired of your rambling.

92
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,400
Give it back.

93
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,160
It’s yours?

94
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,160
How old are you to

95
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,200
be still playing a remote control toy?

96
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,320
What does it have to do with you?

97
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:29,960
Fine.

98
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,240
This thing flew in my tent.

99
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,920
I was doing makeup and

100
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,320
a limited-version powder spread
all over the ground.

101
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,720
My lipstick broke, too.

102
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,360
Don’t you have to compensate?

103
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,120
Don’t touch Miss Lu
with your dirty hands.

104
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,200
Shut up, fella.

105
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,880
Have you done looking?

106
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,400
I’ve got the color number.

107
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,800
I’ll buy one for you.

108
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,280
Plus, your lip is messed up.

109
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,560
Wait.

110
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:11,960
What?

111
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,560
You’re a fan of Thither Cloud, right?

112
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,600
Its update has stopped for five years.

113
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,960
Don’t you want to know
the following storyline?

114
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,600
You’ve really brought the sketches
with you.

115
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,120
Of course.

116
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,880
They’re in my iPad.

117
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,880
I happened to put it on the yacht.

118
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,480
Then go get it.

119
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,240
I’ll wait for you here.

120
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,840
Are you kidding?

121
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,120
It’s so hot out here.

122
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,200
I’m not going there just for you.

123
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:50,920
See it or not?

124
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,440
Okay, okay. I’ll come up with you.

125
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:56,800
I’ll go after seeing the sketches.

126
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:18,860
(Flower & Romance)

127
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,080
Why is the yacht moving?

128
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,680
Stop, stop it.

129
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,200
It won’t stop.

130
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,240
Maybe you can jump
into the sea and swim?

131
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,760
Don’t think that I won’t.

132
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,320
So you’re afraid of water.

133
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,920
Then, you’ve come to the right place.

134
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,000
From now until tomorrow morning,

135
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,320
you are stuck with me here.

136
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,360
You wish.

137
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:31,960
Give it to me.

138
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,080
Shao Zui. Shao Zui.

139
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,640
Help me.

140
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,690
I’m falling off. Shao Zui.

141
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,680
I’m so happy?

142
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,400
Of course.

143
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,640
Of course you are.

144
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,720
That’s Lu Qingwu’s boat.

145
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,360
Have fun!

146
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,720
Behave yourself!

147
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,840
Help me.

148
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,320
Protect yourself!

149
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,440
Are you flirting with someone that far?

150
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,480
Can you take it?

151
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,440
It doesn’t matter if I can.

152
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,160
You should worry about Ji Siqi.

153
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:29,960
Ji Siqi?

154
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,080
What’s he doing on other people’s yacht?

155
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,880
What can he be doing?

156
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,120
Of course he’s building some

157
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,560
healthy social relationships.

158
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,000
He’s nearly 20 years old.

159
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,280
When I was at his age...

160
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,120
You pretended to be my uncle

161
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,360
to attend my parent meeting.

162
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,200
Looking old does have some benefits.

163
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,320
You looked like this at 20 years old.

164
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,760
It didn’t change when you’re 30.

165
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,400
Do you believe

166
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,720
that I will destroy your apple zone now?

167
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,480
Nonsense!

168
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,640
That’s my natural collagen
of a 19-year-old.

169
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,560
Don’t be too jealous.

170
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,240
Qi Nian.

171
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,320
What’s with your look?

172
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,280
It’s a long story.

173
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,680
Did you bring an extra top?

174
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,440
Why would I need a top by the sea?

175
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,240
Did you bring bikinis?

176
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,520
Great.

177
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,440
You should know

178
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,720
that this camping is held for you.

179
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,600
So, just go and flirt with whoever.

180
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,750
Remember, take actions before others do.

181
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,280
No matter how great the guy is,

182
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,160
just go and get him.

183
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,040
When it’s necessary,

184
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,560
bring out the secret weapon.

185
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,400
There’s no straight man who

186
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,680
doesn’t like

187
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,680
three-point bikinis.

188
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,920
Was it your idea?

189
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,840
Yes.

190
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,200
I haven’t got what I want,

191
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,640
so I need to keep on going.

192
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,320
What are you trying to do

193
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:13,560
to me at a place like this?

194
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,120
There are two modes.

195
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,040
Depends on whether you like
the tender way or the hard way.

196
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:18,880
What do you mean?

197
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,040
Prof. Ji.

198
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,160
Do you like bikinis?

199
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,600
I’m wearing them, do you want to see?

200
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,130
What are you talking about?

201
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,250
I’m not interested.

202
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:32,970
Stop it,

203
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,400
put on your clothes.

204
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,690
That’s my clothes.

205
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,320
Didn’t they say

206
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,680
that bikinis are men’s
romantic paradise?

207
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,400
Why did you react this way?

208
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,450
I even chose the one
which brings out my body shape.

209
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,090
Doesn’t it?

210
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,250
Boring.

211
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,730
Get changed.

212
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,530
And then?

213
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,080
Then...

214
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,570
Don’t tell me that’s it.

215
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,730
Which kid? Come here.

216
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,400
Madam,

217
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,200
please throw back the ball.

218
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,000
Who’s your madam? I’m a miss.

219
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,570
Do you know what you’ve interrupted?

220
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,000
I just saw

221
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,330
her lying on that mister’s body.

222
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,250
A picara!

223
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,370
Stop there!

224
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,930
So,

225
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,200
you’ve been playing

226
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,810
with those kids the entire afternoon?

227
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,280
Not playing?

228
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,000
I was teaching them a lesson

229
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,210
of never talking recklessly
though they’re young.

230
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,330
Well, how did the lecture go?

231
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,170
Here. Here. Here.

232
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,490
Seems like we’re winning again.

233
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,280
It doesn’t count.

234
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,240
Again. Again. Again.

235
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,240
One more round. One more.

236
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,120
Madam, you’ve lost so many rounds.

237
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,880
If we continue,

238
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,160
the whole beach wouldn’t be enough.

239
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,720
Haven’t I told you not
to call me Madam?

240
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,760
Call me Miss.

241
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,010
No talking, another round.

242
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:31,800
Here.

243
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,600
Here, here, here.

244
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,000
Here.

245
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,400
And here.

246
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,210
Here.

247
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,890
-Here, here, here.
-Look, here.

248
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,160
Here.

249
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:38,560
Come.

250
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,400
There, there, there.

251
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:39,960
Here, here, here.

252
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,770
Here, here.

253
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:42,930
Here.

254
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,210
Keep going.

255
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,100
I blame you.

256
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,890
Don’t say that you’re my assistant.

257
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,050
Ji Yanxin is better.

258
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,800
But seriously,

259
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,590
can’t you play some games

260
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,680
which can promote your relationship?

261
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,120
Are there games like that?

262
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,050
Of course.

263
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,880
Or else why’d I

264
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,290
bring you here?

265
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,490
What games then?

266
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,240
Mascot Game.

267
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,080
Yes.

268
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,640
This is

269
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,800
a characteristic activity of the camp.

270
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,960
Choose a boy and a girl

271
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,560
to wear the bracelet separately.

272
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,200
As long as they can unlock it

273
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,440
within 24 hours.

274
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,880
Then they win.

275
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,360
The award is that all the camping fees

276
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,920
will be free of charge.

277
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,440
Isn’t it tempting?

278
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,250
Unlock it.

279
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,880
It can’t be unlocked with force.

280
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,210
Try and put your hands together.

281
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,080
The game’s rule

282
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,360
is that the closer you get,

283
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,080
the faster the time will get.

284
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,520
As long as you unlock

285
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,130
within 24 hours,

286
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,610
the mission is completed.

287
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,760
On the contrary,

288
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,480
if the distance between you

289
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,770
is further than a meter.

290
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,560
The bracelet’s alarm will

291
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,960
be on.

292
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,570
The time will increase,
rather than decreasing.

293
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,330
What’s this?

294
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,840
Heart rate.

295
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,080
If heart rate gets faster,

296
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,400
the time will pass

297
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,610
faster, too.

298
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,610
What’s the point of this game?

299
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,960
I’m going to prepare for the barbecue.

300
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,360
It all depends on you
whether we get a free dinner.

301
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,050
Good luck to you.

302
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,930
Trying to hold my hand?

303
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,080
No,

304
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,600
I just want to get closer.

305
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,160
So the time on the clock

306
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,680
can go faster.

307
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,610
Not necessarily.

308
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,480
According to the theory,

309
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,960
as long as we stay within one meter,

310
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,050
and do proper exercises.

311
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,000
The time will decrease
by rising heart rate,

312
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,890
body contact isn’t necessary.

313
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,330
Prof. Ji. You mean...?

314
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,370
Follow me, don’t fall behind.

315
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:06,190
Prof. Ji. Prof. Ji!

316
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,960
You... That’s not how the game works.

317
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,480
Have you misunderstood it?

318
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,030
Here, try one.

319
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,560
It’s been just a while,

320
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,890
it has accelerated so much.

321
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,970
Your hair is messed up.

322
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,120
Prof. Ji, wait a second.

323
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,490
Can we talk?

324
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,930
About what?

325
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,920
You see,

326
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,680
we can exercise in this position, too.

327
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,010
Think about it.

328
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,970
You want me to carry you?

329
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:40,960
Yes.

330
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,040
But, it’s only for the game’s sake.

331
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,160
Not for getting close with you.

332
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,450
Don’t get me wrong.

333
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,770
I won’t.

334
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,680
I didn’t mean this gesture.

335
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,690
Are there other kinds of ways?

336
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,130
By the way, Prof. Ji.

337
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,610
Let’s do sit-ups.

338
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:12,970
Sure.

339
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,560
How come our gestures differ from others

340
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,800
all the time?

341
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,400
How come others are watching sunset
on the beach

342
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,930
but I’m doing sit-ups?

343
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,290
Ji Yanxin, are you serious?

344
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,930
Not bad.

345
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,770
We have less than 20 hours left.

346
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,760
Let’s do more exercises.

347
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,530
-Don’t touch me.
-Let’s...

348
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,050
Where are you going with barefoot?

349
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,360
Not your business.

350
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,400
I’m here for fun.

351
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,890
Not for watching you get mad.

352
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,240
Prof. Ji, stand there and don’t move.

353
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,920
The time passes without contact anyway.

354
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,490
Let’s stay in the basic distance.

355
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:00,800
Are you mad at me?

356
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,610
No.

357
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,120
I just feel that I’m so dumb.

358
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:03,960
Why would I listen to Ji Qiu

359
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,090
to play this game with you?

360
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,080
I expected to get intimate with you.

361
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,880
But it was my own wishful thinking.

362
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,120
I can’t tell if you were intentional

363
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:10,880
or got me wrong.

364
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,920
Can’t you really tell

365
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,330
what I was thinking?

366
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,810
Then, tell me.

367
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,290
What were you thinking?

368
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,010
I’m trying to flirt, okay?

369
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,440
What am I talking about?

370
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,720
Maybe it’s because I’m too mad

371
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,290
so I said things like that.

372
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,000
Leave me alone.

373
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,490
I’ll drown here.

374
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:40,310
Let me see.

375
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,050
Can you walk?

376
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,210
I can.

377
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,970
You can’t.

378
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,970
Now you’re pretty strong.

379
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,970
Come up, I’ll take you to the clinic.

380
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,090
Why aren’t you talking?

381
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,490
Where’s your energy
of yelling at me just now?

382
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,400
Don’t mention it.

383
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,010
I’m so embarrassed.

384
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,040
You said about flirting.

385
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,200
What was your plan exactly?

386
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,400
Can we let this go?

387
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,400
Like nothing has happened.

388
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,210
No.

389
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,850
Okay, then.

390
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,720
I’ve been trying to flirt
with you all day.

391
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,880
Not just by wearing
inappropriate clothes.

392
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,600
I also wanted to walk
with you hand in hand,

393
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,880
make out by the sea.

394
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,650
I also planned
to surprise you at night...

395
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,010
But of course in the name of game.

396
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,610
Laugh at me,

397
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,170
it sounds ridiculous, right?

398
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,130
Right.

399
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,330
This is my happiest time today.

400
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,680
Remember what you said.

401
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,170
There’s no time for you to regret.

402
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:12,980
(Bei Long)

403
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,930
Ji Siqi, are you still alive?

404
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,370
Don’t call me.

405
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,010
My head feels so dizzy now,

406
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,680
I may throw up on your dress.

407
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,970
You should thank me

408
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,850
for taking you here,

409
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,010
otherwise you’d be fighting
with your brother for a girl.

410
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,240
Who’d want to see two guys

411
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,050
pulling each other’s hair?

412
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,050
Leave me alone.

413
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,510
Tell me,

414
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,350
your brother and Qi Nian,

415
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,950
who matters more to you?

416
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,430
My brother.

417
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,500
But I like Qi Nian

418
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,710
and I won’t back down.

419
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,470
Do you really like her?

420
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,590
Are you sure it’s not
because you’re grateful to her?

421
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,030
What do you mean?

422
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,400
Before Qi Nian,

423
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,130
no one has ever admired your talents.

424
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,810
Let alone using their own work
to help you.

425
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,650
So she was helpful
with recognizing your talent.

426
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,730
But if someone who treats
you better shows up,

427
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,050
would you still think it’s love?

428
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,210
Are you kidding?

429
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,560
No one would treat me better

430
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,050
than Qi Nian.

431
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:37,970
I will.

432
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,250
Listen to me.

433
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,450
I’ll cherish your talent

434
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,450
ten times, no,

435
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,010
a hundred times more than she does.

436
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,560
With me,

437
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,490
you can draw whatever you want.

438
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,710
Not what Qi Nian wants.

439
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,310
Stop it.

440
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,430
No matter how great your offer is,

441
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,390
Qi Nian will always be my first choice.

442
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,190
Unless she doesn’t want me,

443
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,630
or else I won’t leave her.

444
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:08,990
Fine.

445
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,470
If you’re so determined to chase her.

446
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,070
I can only help you with it.

447
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,030
No, thanks.

448
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,340
I’m already grateful

449
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,790
as long as you don’t harass me.

450
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,550
Harass you?

451
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,670
Check out the beauty in front of you.

452
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,270
Do you think that someone like her

453
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,870
needs to stick to a kid like you?

454
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,550
Then why did you want me?

455
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,700
I’ve never treated you nicely.

456
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,670
Do you like it that way?

457
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:38,910
I like your paintings.

458
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,670
You’ve painted the scene

459
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,350
that I can’t portray through painting.

460
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,030
So, whenever I see beautiful scenery,

461
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,990
I want you to come with me.

462
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:57,990
That simple?

463
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,350
Yeah, that simple.

464
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,630
So, are you trying to show me

465
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,830
anything bringing me here?

466
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,460
Finally, we get to the point.

467
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,270
Follow me.

468
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,270
Prof. Ji.

469
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,590
Have a seat.

470
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,110
Where is Ji Qiu and others?

471
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,060
There’s a campfire party there.

472
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:45,990
They all went there.

473
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,070
You can create a confined space

474
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,560
without the bracelet, okay?

475
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,340
Prof. Ji...

476
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,230
We don’t have to hold hands.

477
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,710
My tent is right there.

478
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,190
You can give me
a surprise attack anytime.

479
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,220
Can you just forget
about this afternoon?

480
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,220
Though I was plotting something.

481
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,670
Please give me a chance to start over.

482
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:15,820
I swear,

483
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,540
I only want to unlock the bracelet.

484
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,050
Nothing else at all.

485
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,390
What if I want you to want more?

486
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,590
What do you mean?

487
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,190
There’s indeed another way

488
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,670
to make us shrink down the distance
to the closest.

489
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,790
It can also raise our heart rate
to the highest.

490
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:34,290
What?

491
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,590
Haven’t you practiced it in your head?

492
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,990
No, no. You’ll sue me
for sexual harassment.

493
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,510
I’ll give you a chance.

494
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,220
No matter what you do,

495
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,430
I’ll pretend that it didn’t happen.

496
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,310
But I may lose control.

497
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,780
I’m not dead, okay?

498
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:50,910
I’ll stop you if necessary.

499

Are you particularly interested
in the wilderness?

508
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,910
Why are you always lost
in places like this?

509
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,620
What can you see
in a place of nowhere?

510
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,390
Shut up.

511
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:32,870
Wait quietly.

512
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:35,990
Here it comes.

00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,180

Be quiet.

515
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,780
Or they won’t come out.

516
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,630
They?

517
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:44,870
Three, two, one.

518
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,980
They’re called Blue Tears.

519
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,930
A kind of marine microbes.

520
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,140
They appear in a big amount

521
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,470
in every year’s breeding season.

522
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,620
But they require a high quality

523
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,210
of the water.

524
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:03,590
And they can only live
for ten seconds once out of sea.

525
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,230
So, it’s hard to see them.

526
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,150
I’ve been searching for this place.

527
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:09,830
Isn’t it pretty?

528
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,900
Yes, very pretty.

529
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,590
Is it worthy to come?

530
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,390
Of course.

531
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,870
Do you still hate me?

532
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:19,950
Do you like me then?

533
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,470
Silly.

534
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,870
But I like you a tad more

535
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,870
than not hating you.

536
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,180
No.

537
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,020
How much is a tad?

538
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:30,980
Make it clear.

539
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:31,740
Let go.

540
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,580
A tad is a tad.

541
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,300
Nothing more.

542
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,230
Just accept it.

543
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,260
Ji Yanxin,

544
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,540
why are you alone?

545
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,430
Where’s Qi Nian?

546
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,430
You’ve unlocked the bracelet?

547
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,910
I expected it to take longer.

548
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,810
Seems like you’re going better

549
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:06,910
than I imagine.

550
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,580
About this game,

551
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,550
I don’t care if you find it
funny or just being curious.

552
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,540
If I like someone,

553
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,030
I won’t need extra help.

554
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:15,710
What?

555
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,590
Do you not like Qi Nian?

556
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,270
If I accept somebody,

557
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,190
I won’t keep myself from her.

558
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:23,900
At the same time,

559
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,390
I hope she’s the same to me.

560
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:27,710
If she can’t be,

561
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,910
neither of us

562
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,670
will make more efforts.

563
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,940
What if

564
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:40,090
Qi Nian really hides things from you?

565
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,320
Then no matter she likes me or not,

566
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:43,950
I will keep her away from me.

567
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,230
Okay.

568
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,270
I’ll watch here for the night.

569
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:53,630
Go back to sleep.

570
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,110
Standing on the ground is better.

571
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,630
Are you leaving like this?

572
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,030
Come on.

573
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:39,900
I’ve been floating

574
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,260
on the sea with you for a whole night.

575
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,690
Isn’t it enough?

576
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:44,070
What if it’s not?

577
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:47,790
Miss Lu,

578
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,980
there’s a huge difference in the way

579
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:50,900
we behave as well as

580
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,140
in our eyes for beauty.

581
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,580
Maybe we can hang out sometimes,

582
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,100
but we’ll be on our separate ways.

583
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,070
Go to somebody else.

584
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,430
We’ve only spent one night
on the yacht.

585
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,470
You’ve thought that far?

586
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:03,620
You...

587
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,940
Young boy,

588
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,260
in our life,

589
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,750
you unite for mutual interests,
you separate for divergences.

590
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,670
Thinking too much makes you bald.

591
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,460
Look at me,

592
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,340
I don’t care about friend’s thoughts.

593
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,350
I only care about their appearances.

594
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:16,870
Shallow.

595
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,180
Yeah.

596
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,560
You can’t even let
out your feelings for Qi Nian,

597
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:24,580
how deep you are.

598
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:25,490
You...

599
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:29,430
What are you doing?

600
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,190
Don’t come here.

601
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,710
I thought I’d fall on the floor.

602
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,420
Seems like your rejection is...

603
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,390
Shut up.

604
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,870
Say no more.

605
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,240
What’s this?

606
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,390
It’s for you.

607
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:55,670
It helps you with love.

608
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,820
It’s just a sand clock.

609
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,020
You get three for ten yuan

610
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,470
at the vendor near my home.

611
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,390
It’s called Blue Tears.

612
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,790
Whoever sees it can
make their dream come true.

613
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:07,950
You can’t bring the beach with you,

614
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,350
but you can take the sands.

615
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,300
But it’s made by the local.

616
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,270
I’m not sure if it’ll work.

617
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:15,990
Thank you.

618
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,870
Don’t be too moved.

619
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:21,100
Only kids believe
in this kind of things.

620
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,790
I really shouldn’t have bought it.

621
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,620
Stop playing.

622
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,510
I’ll take you home.

623
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,150
Where’s Qi Nian?

624
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,180
She left in the morning

625
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,300
with a note left in the tent.

626
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,430
She said it’s emergency.

627
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,550
Does Mr. Ji know?

628
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,220
What do you think?

629
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,350
He’s been silent

630
00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:59,330
all this morning.

631
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,110
He’s very dangerous now.

632
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:02,990
Mr. Ji.

633
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,750
I heard that the winner
got a special award last night.

634
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,030
Did you get it?

635
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,390
It’s in the boot.

636
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,510
Why didn’t you give it to Qi Nian?

637
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,300
Yeah, right.

638
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,350
It’s said it’s very practical.

639
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:16,740
You can use it until you get married.

640
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:17,350
Ji Qiu.

641
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,950
Have you found an intern job?

642
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,550
Do you want to come to my company?

643
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,560
I’m sorry, Ji Yanxin.

644
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:27,750
I’ll shut up.

645
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,390
Shao Zui.

646
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:32,750
Yes?

647
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:35,090
Siqi is out with a friend.

648
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,830
Do you think it’s girl or a boy?

649
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,110
A boy.

650
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:43,790
Okay.

651
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,230
If it’s a girl,

652
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,970
I’ll punch him.

653
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,670
Relax, Mr. Ji.

654
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,380
If it’s a girl,

655
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,910
it won’t be Qi Nian.

656
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,780
I’m sorry, I’m sorry.

657
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,630
Slow down, I’m having a carsickness.

658
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,110
Where, where did you come from?

659
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,670
Don’t wake me up.

660
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,060
The father was saying the vows just now,

661
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,870
let me continue the dream.

662
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:29,230
(Every Encounter)
Dreaming about taking vows? Exciting.

663
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,150
What did you play by the sea?

664
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,630
I played Ji Yanxin.

665
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,830
On some level, he played me.

666
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,550
We kissed and hugged.

667
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,020
But why’s he still suspicious?

668
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,590
Waiting for me to be completely honest.

669
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,900
I don’t care about it.

670
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,590
Just put it in the comics.

671
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:53,870
The comics?

672
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,740
(Dress for the Beauty)

673
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,940
Your books are printed already.

674
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,500
The signing session is coming.

675
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,270
Why are you reacting like this?

676
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,430
Is this your first time seeing it?

677
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,100
Ji Yanxin hasn’t known

678
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,190
that he’s the prototype of my book.

679
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:10,820
No.

680
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,950
The delivery for you has been signed.

681
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,980
(Received by Yiyan Office’s reception)

682
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,390
It’s sent to Ji Yanxin’s firm.

683
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,630
Bring me the delivery package
on my desk.

684
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:29,820
Hurry, hurry.

685
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,150
Pick up the phone.

686
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:37,420
(Qi Nian)

687
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:44,630
MC?

688
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,660
When has the boss started

689
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,630
to contact with Qi Nian’s company?

690
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,910
Pick it up.

691
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,870
Sorry. I’ve chosen the wrong address.

692
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,750
Hello. Li Yue...

693
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:58,950
What?

694
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,230
He’s sending something? Send what?

695
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:03,910
Where’s his phone?

696
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,310
Not with him?

697
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,100
I can’t call a cab,

698
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,190
there are thirty people in the queue.

699
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:13,980
All the vehicles

700
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:16,030
are probably in traffic jam now.

701
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,300
Got it.

702
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,310
What?

703
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,420
(Flash Delivery)
Hello. What do you want to deliver?

704
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,590
Right in front of you.

705
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,460
Miss Lin, Mr. Ji has arrived.

706
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,310
Please, come in.

707
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:55,750
I’m sorry.

708
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,150
It’s not what you think.

709
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,750
That day at your grandpa’s,

710
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,380
he has agreed us

711
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,670
going out, hasn’t he?

712
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,180
For some reasons,

713
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,390
I had to do it.

714
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,470
You can see it as acting.

715
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,310
Acting?

716
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,020
For who?

717
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,150
You’ll see later.

718
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,630
Hello.

719
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,430
I’m here to deliver things for Mr. Ji.

720
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,420
He’s having a meeting with Miss Lin.

721
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,820
Leaving it here will be fine.

722
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:29,870
I’ll transfer to you.

723
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,020
Wait, wait.

724
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:32,740
-Qi Nian?
-Wait.

725
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:33,620
I sent it.

726
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:33,900
What’s wrong?

727
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:34,790
I’d like to withdraw.

728
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,220
Sorry.

729
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,260
It’s okay.

730
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,270
Go, go, go.

731
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,460
(Dress for the Beauty)

732
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,030
I thought it was something else.

733
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,750
Just a few books.

734
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,460
What do you know?

735
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,380
If Ji Yanxin saw it,

736
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,780
it’d be over between us.

737
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,990
It’d be truly over.

738
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,750
Qi Nian,

739
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,190
why don’t you like someone else?

740
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,340
Who do you think I am?

741
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:03,300
Do I look like someone who’s shaky?

742
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,500
I hope that you are.

743
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,460
It’s better than trying so hard

744
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:09,430
but to realize that he’s
already seeing someone.

745
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,790
What do you mean?

746
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,340
You really don’t know?

747
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,150
I don’t.

748
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,710
Mr. Ji will be engaged, soon.

749
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,070
Engaged?

750
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:22,100
With whom?

751
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,580
The news is all over the company.

752
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,350
With Miss Lin, Lin Yi
who just got back from abroad.

753
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:30,030
I heard that it’s approved
by Mr. Ji’s grandpa.

754
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:31,940
(Dress for the Beauty)
The boss has been checking

755
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:34,870
the settings and hotels, too.

756
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:37,830
Qi Nian?

757
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:39,550
Qi Nian?

758
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:41,230
Are you okay?

759
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:42,420
I’m fine,

760
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,710
I need to go to the bathroom.

761
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,340
It’s okay, it’s definitely a rumor.

762
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,870
