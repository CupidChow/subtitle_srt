Courtyard renovation.

24
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,410
Hello? Is it you?

25
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,610
Wrong number?

26
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,520
Hi, Miss.

27
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,160
I have a street store

28
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,280
close to the subway.

29
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,170
Do you have any interests?

30
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,490
Is it you, cousin?

31
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,200
Only the Ji’s

32
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,200
and salesmen

33
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,890
call this old number.

34
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:41,110
Siqi?

35
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,600
Okay, keep lying.

36
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,610
I’m listening.

37
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,080
We grew up together,

38
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,050
you think I can’t recognize
your calciprivic voice?

39
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,370
Dare you hang up my phone!

40
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,720
Believe it or not,

41
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,360
I’m sending the video of you

42
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,210
in the signings to Yanxin.

43
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,810
You know him.

44
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,680
If he knows about it,

45
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,200
I’m sure he will come to you

46
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,770
within twelve hours.

47
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,770
Ji Qiu, what do you want?

48
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,280
And,

49
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,010
my surname is Pei, not Ji.

50
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,200
You’d better go back home.

51
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,050
Go back home?

52
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,650
No way.

53
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,520
As long as Ji Yanxin is still there,

54
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,730
I will never go back.

55
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,320
Stop talking about this,

56
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,610
I need your help for other things.

57
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,140
(Courtyard renovation. No entry.)

58
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,330
Did you

59
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,200
see a handsome

60
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,320
passing by in a hurry?

61
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,330
No. No.

62
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,690
Wait.

63
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,290
It’s really you!

64
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,170
It’s been a long time, Qi Nian.

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,810
No.

66
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,730
Qiyue Qingwu.

67
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,730
Long time no see.

68
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,690
Miss Lu.

69
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,220
(It’s showtime.)

70
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,970
Are you sure to wipe it off?

71
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,450
Sorry.

72
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,290
It’s amazing.

73
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,130
Do you want to draw comics?

74
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,050
As a professional.

75
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,980
You don’t need to do it
on the sneak after class.

76
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,330
And you can also make money
from it.

77
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,200
You mean...

78
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,170
Be a cartoonist.

79
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,690
Cooperate with me,

80
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,930
let’s debut together.

81
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,010
My name is Lu Qingwu.

82
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,970
Qi Nian.

83
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,170
Found a treasure by strolling around?

84
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,210
Let me introduce,

85
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,690
this is Mr. Xiao, the editor in Rongpin.

86
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,600
Hi.

87
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,250
Hi, I’m Qi Nian.

88
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,880
Your style is very similar

89
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,200
to a painter on the Internet.

90
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,240
His name is called Qi…

91
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,090
Qiyue.

92
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,930
So you are Qiyue!

93
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,840
You are the best painter
I have ever seen.

94
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,130
Your story is unique,

95
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,530
which perfectly makes up
for Lu’s weakness.

96
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,400
She can only draw love stories.

97
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,850
She needs to improve her skills
in other aspects.

98
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,690
Hey, what are you talking about?

99
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,520
If you think Qi Nian is a good painter,

100
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,880
then sign her.

101
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,690
Of course, I will.

102
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,130
I’ll never miss

103
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,930
any talents.

104
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,780
(Qiyue Qingwu)

105
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,480
What is this?

106
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,840
My pseudonym.

107
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,130
It has both of our names in it.

108
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,490
Mr. Xiao said,

109
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,330
it will be launched in May.

110
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,450
Are you excited?

111
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,900
(Thither Cloud)

112
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,160
But my college entrance
examination is coming soon,

113
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,370
I’ll be isolated from the Internet
for a month.

114
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,930
We will wait until the Exam is over.

115
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,240
By then you will be

116
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,890
a cartoonist with serious works,

117
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,770
then I have to call you Miss Qi.

118
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,810
I’m flattered, Miss Lu.

119
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,360
Good luck to you!

120
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,770
Good luck to me!

121
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,840
How was the last exam?

122
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,920
Mom, the exam is over anyway.

123
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,440
Mom, can I use the Internet now?

124
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,920
Sure, see how eager you are.

125
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,650
Thank you, Mom.

126
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:09,340
(Thither Cloud)

127
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,240
Thither Cloud is

128
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,040
the first work I independently created,

129
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,680
thank you for your love.

130
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,920
I will continue to work hard

131
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,370
to create better works in the future.

132
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,050
Thank you all.

133
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,490
Are you still drawing comics?

134
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,610
Is this a manga character?

135
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,570
Now you don’t draw boys anymore,

136
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,290
but children’s books?

137
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,000
What I paint

138
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,170
has nothing to do with you.

139
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,280
If you’re still in this industry,

140
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,810
you should have been famous

141
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,160
after so many years.

142
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,770
Don’t you think you should
reflect on yourself?

143
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,680
Thank you, Miss Lu, for your concern.

144
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,240
You go your way, and I’ll go mine.

145
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,120
I don’t follow you,

146
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,410
please don’t follow me.

147
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,570
Sure enough,

148
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,650
after so many years,

149
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,180
you are still heartless.

150
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,240
At least I still have shame.

151
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:11,880
You…

152
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,440
Miss Lu, I have other things.

153
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,250
Please suit yourself.

154
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,200
(Key)

155
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,330
I’m here, where are you?

156
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:24,160
Oh, it’s you.

157
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,090
You sent that person?

158
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,290
What are you talking about?

159
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,330
I wondered why he did that
in the signings.

160
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,090
You asked him to do it.

161
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,450
Who are you talking about?

162
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,720
Even the gunman painted better than you.

163
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,120
You notorious liar!

164
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,590
The world must know your tricks!

165
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,570
Stop!

166
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,930
Stop!

167
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:50,410
Siqi?

168
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,770
You finally admitted it.

169
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,090
Take her away.

170
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,200
Wait.

171
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,640
Even if I know this person,

172
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,040
it doesn’t mean I asked him to do it.

173
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,890
It’s been so many years,

174
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,770
why are you still mentioning
Thither Cloud?

175
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,050
Yeah,

176
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,920
it’s been so many years,

177
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,170
you still haven’t got over it.

178
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,530
And you still think I’m sorry to you.

179
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,650
You know you are.

180
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,570
I do?

181
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,410
Forget it.

182
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,880
You are always like this,

183
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,130
sorry to no one.

184
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,130
What are you standing here?

185
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,930
She’s with that guy.

186
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,970
Take her to the security.

187
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,970
What are you doing here?

188
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,050
Let’s go.

189
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,370
Who are you?

190
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,250
You think you can

191
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,480
take someone from me

192
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,990
without an explanation?

193
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,450
What are you looking at?

194
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,730
It’s a waste of time
recognizing your face.

195
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,010
Cartoonist.

196
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:55,700
(Lu Qingwu Cartoonist)

197
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,610
Not a police?

198
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,640
When did I say I am a police?

199
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,090
Then why do you catch her?

200
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,210
I…

201
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,810
She has a job to do.

202
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,810
Bye, guys.

203
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,290
Let’s go.

204
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,450
I…

205
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,680
Miss Lu, they’re gone.

206
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,890
I know!

207
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,250
I can’t curse in front of a handsome.

208
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,970
Where is that kid?

209
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,130
Ran away from the stairwell.

210
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,360
Waste.

211
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,610
Even Jia is more useful than you.

212
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,990
Prof. Ji, what’s wrong with your foot?

213
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,320
I just left for a while,

214
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,430
what happened?

215
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:41,170
Nothing.

216
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,680
There is a bathroom,
go change your clothes.

217
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,280
I will send you back.

218
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,480
Let me take care of your foot first.

219
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,730
Then I will change clothes.

220
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,370
I’m fine. All I need is a rest.

221
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,010
I’ll help you over for a rest.

222
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,050
Let’s go.

223
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,680
I was away just for a while.

224
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,330
What happened?

225
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,090
Nothing.

226
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,770
Just had a dream.

227
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,650
Siqi?

228
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,370
Siqi?

229
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,970
Siqi?

230
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,290
What?

231
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,250
Sorry.

232
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,330
It’s okay.

233
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:41,800
It seems to be a bad dream.

234
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,520
Maybe it’s because I woke up too early,

235
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,050
I didn’t have time for many things.

236
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,610
Is there anything I can do for you?

237
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,880
Take care of your own business first.

238
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,450
I got no business.

239
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,610
Why are you disputing
with the cartoonist?

240
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,530
Since you are asleep,

241
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,130
then I will tell you another secret.

242
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,290
Actually…

243
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,650
I’m a comics painter.

244
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,440
Seems he really fell asleep
at that time.

245
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,610
Good, he didn’t hear it.

246
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,370
So you don’t know the reason,
just come and help me?

247
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,080
Need I know the reason to help you?

248
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,080
Then you will stand on my side

249
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,850
unconditionally from now on?

250
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,120
I have other things.

251
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,250
Go change your clothes.

252
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:33,920
I’ll wait for you…

253
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,650
to come back.

254
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,090
Why are there emergencies
all over the world?

255
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,030
Hello?

256
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,960
Is Ji Qiu with you?

257
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,810
I have something to ask her.

258
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,760
Even the gunman painted better than you.

259
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,200
You notorious liar!

260
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,770
The world must know your tricks!

261
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,410
Come in.

262
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,700
Stop watching it, Miss Lu.

263
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,160
How could I?

264
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,520
There are several trending searches
this afternoon.

265
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,810
The marketing accounts
are crazy about it.

266
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,360
Go

267
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,850
make more copies of this picture.

268
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:30,490
And then paste it on the dart board.

269
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:37,360
He is the one who embarrassed you

270
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,560
at the event?

271
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,290
Yes.

272
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,730
It’s a pity that he ran away.

273
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,600
If I know his name,

274
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,130
I’ll invite him for tea
and treat him good.

275
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,250
His name is Pei Siqi.

276
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,610
How do you know?

277
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,480
He submitted his resume.

278
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,040
I deleted it from the list

279
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,600
because of his incomplete identity info.

280
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,490
Well done.

281
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,730
Miss Lu, you won’t blame me, will you?

282
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,930
Of course no.

283
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,810
Why do I recruit my anti-fans,
to make trouble for me?

284
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,410
These are his works.

285
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,640
Because it was removed from the list,

286
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,850
I didn’t show it to you.

287
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,210
Pei Siqi.

288
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,850
What the hell is this?

289
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,760
Such a good painting,

290
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,130
but he is my anti-fan.

291
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,090
If I saw this painting earlier,

292
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,970
I would probably recruit him
without hesitation.

293
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,370
But now...

294
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,250
Is the admission list for new recruits
submitted?

295
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,930
The process has been completed.

296
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:46,960
It’s to be released tomorrow.

297
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,370
I guess it’s too late.

298
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,690
It’s strange.

299
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,010
What the hell am I sorry for?

300
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,290
So, about Pei Siqi,

301
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:03,450
do you still want to give him a chance?

302
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,460
(Sleeping pills)

303
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,980
(Key)

304
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,450
Hello, Key.

305
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,610
Liar.

306
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,360
I went to the third floor

307
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,330
and you were not there.

308
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,640
Hey,

309
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,520
I went to you on the first floor

310
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,650
and I met...

311
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,800
Forget it.

312
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,970
Are you all right now?

313
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,040
No.

314
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,160
Thanks to you,

315
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,520
I almost face the biggest crisis

316
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,530
in my life.

317
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,810
I saw my brother.

318
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,570
After so many years,

319
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,330
I didn’t expect to meet him in a mall.

320
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,370
How would your brother do seeing you?

321
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,690
No idea.

322
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,600
But if he finds out
that I ran away in front of him

323
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,360
he would probably kill me.

324
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,170
So cruel?

325
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:04,960
Forget it, let’s not talk about him.

326
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,730
Where are you?

327
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,240
I’m at the boss’s place.

328
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,090
What?

329
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,680
Qi Nian.

330
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,320
Have you forgot

331
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,570
that you have a family?

332
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,240
No, I haven’t.

333
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,680
My family is in Quancheng.

334
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,450
No.

335
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,240
What about Dress for the Beauty?

336
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,400
Do you still want to draw it?

337
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,120
Sure, don’t worry.

338
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,090
The first five paintings
have been polished

339
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,440
and will be released online soon.

340
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,000
The new storyboard is
also being prepared.

341
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,600
The progress will not be delayed.

342
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,240
All right?

343
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,360
What about me?

344
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,000
How long are you gonna ignore me?

345
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,280
Key.

346
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,520
Don’t call me.

347
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,840
Your boss and I,
you can only choose one.

348
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,610
Who do you choose?

349
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:36,930
I choose my boss.

350
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,650
Why?

351
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,290
Because he pays me.

352
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:40,930
And

353
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,850
he is the hero in my comics.

354
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,880
Rebellious stage.

355
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,530
Who is he angry with?

356
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,810
Zolpidem tartrate tablets.

357
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,780
(Zolpidem tartrate tablets)

358
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,130
Used for treating

359
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,810
insomnia.

360
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,170
The adverse reactions include

361
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,250
agitation

362
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,610
and sleepwalking.

363
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,140
(Sleepwalking)

364
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,400
Mom.

365
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,600
Why doesn’t that brother go to work?

366
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,930
Those who didn’t
learn well are like that.

367
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,610
But he is so handsome.

368
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,840
Can he make a living out of it?

369
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,360
An unemployed slacker
doesn’t have the right to be in love.

370
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,120
Go to play for a while.

371
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,250
You need to go home
and do your homework later.

372
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,540
(Rongpin)

373
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,860
(Offer Letter from Rongpin)

374
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,810
Really?

375
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,570
I got the offer!

376
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,970
I am not unemployed!

377
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,160
Little sister,

378
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,520
you need to wait for about ten years.

379
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,010
I have someone I like.

380
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,400
Let’s go.

381
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,090
Go home and do your homework.

382
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:17,760
Hello?

383
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,080
Where is my household register?

384
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,970
Bro, I need it for my job.

385
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,210
Did you really get the offer?

386
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,760
Of course.

387
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:27,960
Without the household register,

388
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,290
I can’t apply for a new ID card.

389
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:31,320
Without the ID card, I can’t go to work.

390
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,930
Rongpin has sent me

391
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,850
the entry information.

392
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,840
Didn’t you say

393
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,450
you would get it from
your cousin’s drawer?

394
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,320
But he...

395
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,200
Don’t worry about him.

396
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,450
He doesn’t know we are in contact.

397
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,130
No.

398
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,330
He knows it.

399
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:47,530
Is it fun?

400
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,080
Hello?

401
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:00,890
Ji Siqi.

402
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:01,950
Hello!

403
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,090
Make some room.

404
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,210
It’s so screwed.

405
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:14,800
What happened?

406
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,970
Someone is going to suffer.

407
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,130
I feel that a bitter fight is coming.

408
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,600
Don’t worry.

409
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,250
Ji Yanxin cares about his brother
more than anyone else.

410
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,610
He won’t do anything to him.

411
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,770
That’s why it’s scary!

412
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,240
Those who with Buddhist nature

413
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,450
once have obsession

414
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,120
will be a lot more damaging

415
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,250
than normal people!

416
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,520
Moreover,

417
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,410
the two of them haven’t seen
each other for so many years.

418
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,050
How much anger they must have saved up?

419
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,930
There is nothing we can do.

420
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,480
The two of them have to sit down

421
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,890
and solve it.

422
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,330
Don’t worry.

423
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,450
Even if they have a huge fight,

424
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,370
they won’t blame you.

425
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,050
Really?

426
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,650
Come on.

427
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,010
Let’s calm down.

428
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,090
Shao Zui, I will kill you!

429
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,210
Ji Qiu is such a traitor.

430
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,570
It’s me who wants to see you.

431
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,530
It has nothing to do with Ji Qiu.

432
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,730
What do you want?

433
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,220
That’s how you talk to your brother?

434
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,120
So you are here to put on airs,

435
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:34,850
right?

436
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,320
(Household Register)

437
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,290
Are you looking for this?

438
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:44,940
(Household Register)

439
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,610
Why don’t you go home
and take it yourself?

440
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,770
You know why.

441
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,810
Is it for me?

442
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,250
If you don’t give me, that’s fine.
I don’t care.

443
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,170
Answer my question first.

444
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,530
All right.

445
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,080
I just don’t want to see you.

446
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,080
I don’t want to go to your house.

447
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:04,810
Is it okay?

448
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,690
Don’t you take a look?

449
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,370
That won’t be necessary.

450
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,600
You haven’t come home for so many years.

451
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,490
How do you know
your name is still on it?

452
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,730
You fool me.

453
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,410
I just want you to remember it.

454
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,080
No matter how long
you are away from home,

455
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,680
we will always be
on the same household register.

456
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,890
It’s our home!

457
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,770
Ji Siqi.

458
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,330
Do you want to eat it?

459
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,490
Who wants to eat that?

460
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,400
You want to buy me with dessert?

461
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,290
In your dream!

462
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,960
Do I look like someone

463
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,160
who will give up the principle
just for dessert?

464
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,250
The restaurant offered it for free.

465
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,650
Well then...

466
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,010
Let’s not waste it.

467
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,130
What job did you get?

468
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,010
Why should I tell...

469
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,370
Comic assistant at Rongpin Culture.

470
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,290
Why is it still about comics?

471
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:27,810
Is there any problem?

472
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,440
You have left home for so many years.

473
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,280
I thought you might
grow up a little bit.

474
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,850
Why are you still so unrealistic?

475
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,930
There is only one wall between

476
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,810
chasing dreams and wasting time.

477
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,240
People with ideas

478
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,690
will break through
that wall sooner or later.

479
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,050
But the rest of them
would just be wasting time.

480
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,610
Which one are you?

481
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,890
No need to speak in a roundabout way.

482
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,720
I would have given up
early if I want to.

483
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,960
I won’t go with you

484
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,930
no matter how you trash me.

485
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,170
And I think

486
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,080
it’s enough

487
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,240
to have one person

488
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:57,970
to acknowledge me.

489
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,090
Who is that?

490
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,370
Someone of authority
in comic book world?

491
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,330
A famous painter?

492
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,000
Or is it just

493
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,680
mutual flattery among rookies?

494
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,810
Why are you so condescending?

495
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,160
It’s a leading comic book company.

496
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,040
(Offer Letter)
I got the offer.

497
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,080
It’s written down.

498
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:15,970
What else can you say?

499
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,290
Why are you laughing?

500
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,200
If you get this job

501
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,400
with your own ability,

502
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,490
I’ll set you free

503
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,530
and let you do whatever you want.

504
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,960
You said it.

505
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,920
As long as I get into the company,

506
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,000
you will leave me alone forever.

507
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,480
But if you fail...

508
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,890
Then I will go with you.

509
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,480
But that is impossible

510
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,850
Don’t be so confident.

511
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,080
Do you really think you can
control me forever

512
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,050
if I go with you?

513
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,410
You can have a try.

514
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,080
Since your childhood,

515
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,570
when did I ever break my words?

516
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,250
Remember to wear formal clothes at work.

517
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,250
Got it?

518
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,290
I told you not to stay up late.

519
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,560
You are a CEO.

520
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,290
Can you not talk like Qi Nian?

521
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,440
Is it a happy reunion

522
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,890
with your brother?

523
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,570
See.

524
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,890
I changed the subject and
you are staring at me.

525
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,490
The overwhelming pressure.

526
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,090
He is just a rebellious kid.

527
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,730
He is twenty years old.

528
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,810
But he is still so worrisome.

529
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,720
I know you.

530
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,410
Once it’s about your family,

531
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,570
you can act irrationally.

532
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,480
Plus, there is no less pressure

533
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,410
from the company’s recent project.

534
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,450
Can you really take it?

535
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,010
I’m fine.

536
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,370
I’ll take some pills.

537
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:28,460
(Lucid water and lush mountains
are invaluable assets)

538
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,730
She is waiting for me.

539
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,650
Why is there a pillow doll?

540
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,530
It has temperature.

541
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,330
The dolls now are so real.

542
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,890
The skin feels exactly like a human.

543
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:37,890
Human?

544
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,570
Ji Yanxin!

545
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,800
I’m so ill

546
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,130
that I sneak up on him.

547
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,040
No.

548
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,790
This is obviously the guest room.

549
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:53,090
I’m in my bed.

550
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:53,920
Could it be...?

551
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,130
Prof. Ji?

552
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,290
Prof. Ji?

553
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,290
Are you sleeping in the wrong room?

554
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,610
Don’t look at me like that.

555
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:19,210
I didn’t take the initiative this time.

556
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,850
What is happening?

557
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,090
Treatment.

558
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,090
Zolpidem tartrate tablets.

559
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,290
Used for treating

560
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,530
insomnia.

561
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,250
The adverse reactions include

562
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,270
agitation

563
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,490
and sleepwalking.

564
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,090
Is Ji Yanxin sleepwalking?

565
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,010
Did you stay up late last night?

566
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,410
Poor sleep will affect the work
in the next day.

567
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,090
Don’t be too playful.

568
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,920
Am I playful?

569
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,930
Who stopped me from
having sleep last night?

570
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:18,970
I...

571
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,290
You finally come back to your room.

572
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,240
What do you mean?

573
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,570
Is your sleepwalking over?

574
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,410
At least give me the key
before you go to sleep.

575
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,130
What should I do?

576
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,510
It was almost at dawn when I escaped.

577
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:59,090
Who can be bitterer than me?

578
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,840
The point is that he has

579
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,290
no memory at all about last night.

580
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,210
Prof. Ji.

581
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,890
Can you not lock the door at night?

582
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,610
Why?

583
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,290
Why?

584
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,490
Don’t you know why?

585
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,250
I just hope I won’t be exhausted.

586
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,400
Because I am afraid of ghosts.

587
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,000
I often have nightmares.

588
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,400
If I have a nightmare,

589
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,570
I can turn to you for comfort.

590
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,330
I won’t lock the door.

591
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:29,770
But don’t come to me.

592
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,920
I’ll be thankful

593
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,650
if you don’t come to me.

594
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,490
Who sucked you dry?

595
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,850
You are completely soulless.

596
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,200
Don’t ask.

597
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,920
The answer is two words.

598
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:59,060
No sleep.

599
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,370
Did your boss torture you again?

600
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,720
I was forced to stay overnight.

601
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,250
It was like hell every night.

602
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,970
Speaking of summer,

603
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,480
many people have insomnia recently.

604
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,410
Yes.

605
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,570
I remember you told me last year.

606
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,000
There would be ghosts in the pantry

607
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,170
when you worked overtime.

608
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,120
Yes.

609
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:22,960
Sometimes they worked
until early morning.

610
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,070
When they went to the pantry,

611
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,520
they saw a dark shadow

612
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,700
pouring coffee there.

613
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,720
It made the coffee and then poured it,

614
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,480
repeating the simple movements
again and again.

615
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,560
It’s so scary.

616
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,560
What’s scary about that?

617
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,480
That’s your boss.

618
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,250
He only does that when he
sleepwalks in the night.

619
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:36,730
What?

620
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:37,970
Mr. Ji?

621
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,850
How do you know it?

622
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:43,570
I misspoke again.

623
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:46,880
It’s about life and death.

624
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,880
It’s just between us.

625
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,120
Your boss is actually my boss.

626
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,400
He sleepwalks
in the middle of the night.

627
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,600
I got my dark circles

628
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,620
when I made coffee at night.

629
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,730
It’s so troublesome.

630
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,520
You should just handcuff him

631
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,730
and make him not move at all.

632
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,160
I thought about it.

633
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,210
But I feel it’s a little perverted.

634
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,120
Based on what you said,

635
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,760
there is no way to live like that.

636
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,920
If it were me,

637
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,560
I would just shake him up.

638
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,440
No matter what the consequence will be.

639
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,130
No, no, no.

640
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,360
He would never

641
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,040
sit quietly in front of me

642
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,730
and be my model in the daytime.

643
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:45,970
Next,

644
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,130
how to draw the hugging pose...

645
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,730
Not hug me.

646
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,170
Never mind.

647
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,960
I can only enjoy

648
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,560
such a treat

649
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,810
when he sleepwalks.

650
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,650
Since we hugged,

651
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,330
can we have a kiss?

652
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,810
Even if it is fake.

653
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,090
Stop!

654
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,080
Okay.

655
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,810
I know how to draw this pose.

656
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,970
Oh my god.

657
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,160
How can I do that?

658
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,360
This is basically

659
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,410
taking advantage of him.

660
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,520
No, no, no.

661
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,800
Think about how aloof
he is during the day.

662
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,400
That’s the real him.

663
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,570
I can’t do whatever I want.

664
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,960
God, don’t test me anymore.

665
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,130
I will become a monster.

666
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,610
I think

667
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,570
he should see a doctor.

668
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,970
Otherwise, Qi Nian will be arrested
sooner or later.

669
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,920
But I think you do enjoy it.

670
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,490
It’s painful but joyful.

671
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,440
Because when he is awake,

672
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,170
he would never be so gentle to me.

673
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,290
He won’t let me do whatever I want.

674
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,680
Where can I look for
this kind of chance?

675
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,880
Do you want him to wake up

676
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,850
or not wake up?

677
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,530
Let me enjoy it for some more time.

678
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:40,930
Call the police.

679
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,010
There is a pervert.

680
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:44,610
She is incurable.

681
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,290
Please come in.

682
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,490
We meet again.

683
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,250
Don’t you have anything to say?

684
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,290
About why I am here?

685
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,800
You are the Chief
Content Officer of Rongpin.

686
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,530
You are here to provide
guidance for new recruits, right?

687
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,690
