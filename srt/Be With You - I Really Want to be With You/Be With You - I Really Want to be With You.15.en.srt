It’s definitely a rumor.

22
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,240
How could Ji Yanxin...?

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,440
Mr. Ji is getting engaged soon.

24
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,640
I heard that it’s arranged
by his grandpa.

25
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,200
And he is looking for venues

26
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:16,960
and hotels these days.

27
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,240
If I were the girl back there,

28
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,240
I would kill you.

29
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,000
Thank you.

30
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,840
Are they the keys of my place?

31
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,760
What is the extra one?

32
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,640
The key of my house.

33
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,720
I’m busy this afternoon.

34
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,040
Can you watch the house for me?

35
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,300
(No.520 Bus)

36
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,600
Ji Yanxin, I like you.

37
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,040
Qi Bao,

38
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,040
I can’t come to see you often
in the future.

39
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,920
Remember to behave well.

40
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,320
Where are you going?

41
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,880
I met some family affairs.

42
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,000
So maybe I can’t come here for a time.

43
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,640
How long will it be?

44
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,040
Maybe after you’re engaged…

45
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,760
Wait.

46
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,360
It’s also inappropriate after that.

47
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,320
So I won’t come again in the future.

48
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,120
What do you mean?

49
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,700
(Dress for the Beauty)

50
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,760
I’m sorry that

51
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,960
I have bothered you for so long.

52
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,480
Sorry, I got bad intentions
at the beginning.

53
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,800
What does that mean?

54
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,680
At first, I tried to approach you

55
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,720
not because I liked you,

56
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,720
but I had to draw comics.

57
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,160
Siqi is my assistant.

58
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,000
I’m the chief editor.

59
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,840
The comic we made together

60
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,040
is called Dress for the Beauty.

61
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,880
And you are the archetype of the hero.

62
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,480
So I approached you, pleased you

63
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,520
and flirted with you

64
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,280
just to make some stories.

65
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,000
I know it’s

66
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,480
very wrong

67
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,320
to do this

68
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,040
without your permission.

69
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,240
So, I’m sorry.

70
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,160
So, everything is fake
from the beginning?

71
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:49,520
Yes.

72
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,200
Then, what’s true?

73
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,080
You are going to be engaged.

74
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,400
What’s the point of talking about this?

75
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,760
If I have to accept the apology,

76
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,800
I have to know what mistake you made.

77
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,240
If you don’t make it clear,

78
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,080
I won’t allow you to leave.

79
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:04,960
OK.

80
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,160
I have prepared for this anyway.

81
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,200
My mistake was that
I didn’t follow through.

82
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,560
I should have told you my goal

83
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,680
at the beginning.

84
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,920
When you refused me,

85
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,240
I should have left consciously,

86
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,000
but not tried every way to get closer.

87
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,760
The closer I am to you,

88
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,080
the more I like you.

89
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,440
So now, I can’t draw

90
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,560
anything without you by my side.

91
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,880
I become a loser whose comic
can’t be continued.

92
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,400
Is this enough?

93
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,760
Then, why are you leaving?

94
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,680
You are going to be engaged.

95
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,240
Why should I stay?

96
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,000
To be tortured?

97
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,320
Who said that?

98
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,040
I saw it with my own eyes.

99
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,720
You and Miss Lin.

100
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,080
Congratulations, Mr. Ji.

101
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,560
You can get married before 30.

102
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,280
She must be a great help
to your business,

103
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,200
which is more reliable than me,
a fake girlfriend.

104
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,640
So, you are quitting now?

105
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,520
Yes. I’m quitting.

106
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,800
I’ve wooed you for so long.

107
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,000
Except the final thing,

108
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,880
what else haven’t we done?

109
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,840
I have showed all of me to you,

110
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,440
but you still don’t like me.

111
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,800
Even if we start over again now,

112
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,600
and let me tell you,

113
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,280
I like you.

114
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,480
It’s not about anything else.

115
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,280
I just like you, Ji Yanxin.

116
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,760
Do you believe me? Can you accept me?

117
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,680
See?

118
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,960
So,

119
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,240
it’s meaningless to say all these.

120
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,480
Mr. Ji,

121
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,480
thanks for your concern all the time.

122
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,560
I’m very grateful.

123
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,040
What a pity.

124
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,800
It’s already broken

125
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,440
before you give it out.

126
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,800
Are you alright?

127
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,480
Why staring at me?

128
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,200
I think I must be dreaming

129
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,640
and I will wake up if I blink.

130
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,400
Why do you think so?

131
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,040
Because I lied to you.

132
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,040
You must be angry

133
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,280
and hate me so much.

134
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,200
And you’re about to get engaged
to someone else.

135
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,960
I’m not getting engaged.

136
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,800
You got me wrong.

137
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,280
No.

138
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,160
I must be dreaming.

139
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,960
Then, close your eyes.

140
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:23,840
What’s wrong?

141
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,400
It’s true!

142
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,640
Of course.

143
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,520
No, wait.

144
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,080
And…

145
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,920
What?

146
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,840
The luggage is outside.

147
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,760
Why bother to think about that now?

148
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,000
Are you drunk? Or crazy?

149
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,480

What’s wrong?

157
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,480
The whole thing changed too fast.

158

It’s not realistic.

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,240

I’m hungry.

186
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,280
You have walked two streets.

187
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,480
Aren’t you tired?

188
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,680
Don’t follow me.

189
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,480
It’s OK.

190
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,080
Tell me

191
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,600
where you are going.

192
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,240
To die.

193
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,280
You even want to die just because
you lost your love.

194
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,480
No wonder she chose your brother.

195
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,240
That’s interesting.

196
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,840
You can get Qi Nian back

197
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,920
just in this mood.

198
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,120
A kiss doesn’t really matter.

199
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,440
Where are you going?

200
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:09,840
Excuse me,

201
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,200
your wonton.

202
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,040
Please enjoy.

203
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:12,560
-OK. Thanks.
-Thank you.

204
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:23,640
Qi Nian.

205
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,440
Let’s give it a try.

206
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,200
You don’t understand?

207
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,440
No. Mr. Ji.

208
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,400
Please say it again.

209
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,280
I’m afraid I get it wrong.

210
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,440
I mean

211
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,120
let’s date.

212
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,920
What a boy.

213
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,880
He just got angry at a few words.

214
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,320
Can’t a boy be in danger?

215
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,680
How could you run around at night?

216
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,760
What if you meet someone weird?

217
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,840
Ji Siqi!

218
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,600
Ji Siqi! Where are you?

219
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,280
Ji Siqi!

220
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,520
Ji Siqi!

221
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,680
Who is it?

222
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,600
I wonder who will be in danger.

223
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,360
If someone else did this,

224
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,600
you would be doomed tonight.

225
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,160
You brat.

226
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,720
Are you threatening me?

227
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,240
Why are you haunting me?

228
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,840
You’re a girl

229
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,240
but you still worry about me.

230
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:26,880
So over-confident.

231
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,240
Who knows what you,

232
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,080
a fool of love, will do?

233
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:32,760
Oh, right.

234
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,880
You can only buy some cheap low wine

235
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,320
at the convenience store

236
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,320
and pretend to drown your sorrows

237
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,160
in wine while you

238
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,240
don’t even dare drink too much.

239
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,560
How dare you look down upon me?

240
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,880
Let me show you tonight.

241
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:50,920
OK.

242
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,920
I have wine at home.

243
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,920
Do you dare to come?

244
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,640
Never afraid.

245
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,200
What is your answer?

246
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,720
Well, shouldn’t there be a follow-up?

247
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,120
Shouldn’t there be a reversal?

248
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,440
What reversal?

249
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,880
Like, in the past, you would say

250
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,160
“I need you.”

251
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,440
“I can fall asleep only when
you are by my side.”

252
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,280
Shouldn’t there be a follow-up as well?

253
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,720
You should say

254
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,120
“Let’s date.”

255
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:24,600
“I’m kidding.”

256
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,120
Or, “Let’s date…”

257
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,360
“In your dream.”

258
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,440
Something just like that.

259
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,640
That’s your style.

260
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,960
Or I missed something.

261
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,520
Maybe what you really said was

262
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,760
to set

263
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,600
the date of delivery.

264
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,680
Qi Nian, are you doing this on purpose?

265
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,280
I’m not.

266
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,280
I’m really trying to

267
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,800
figure out your mind.

268
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,440
Because I have made mistakes about it

269
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:49,800
for so many times.

270
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,600
Don’t bother.

271
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,560
I didn’t drink

272
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,720
and was not sleepwalking.

273
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,360
As a fully capable person,

274
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,000
I am responsible for what I did today.

275
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,560
You don’t need to worry.

276
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,320
And you

277
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,840
just finish the food and go back home.

278
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,880
Think about it carefully.

279
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,480
Go home?

280
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:23,680
What else?

281
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,120
You want to stay at my place?

282
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:29,920
Wait for your answer tomorrow.

283
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,360
When did my brother buy a carpet?

284
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,280
Why are you in my dream?

285
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,560
Really?

286
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,920
Are you happy to see me

287
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,480
in your dream?

288
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,320
You’re wearing too little.

289
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,040
So shameless.

290
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,120
What…

291
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,240
Why are you in my home?

292
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:45,720
What…

293
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,120
And you’re wearing like this…

294
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,840
Wait… Wait.

295
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,600
Where am I?

296
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,880
You sober up so quickly.

297
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,040
You seem to be a good drinker.

298
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,960
You don’t even get dizzy.

299
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,240
It’s just drinking.

300
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,680
Bring me all your wine.

301
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,120
It’s OK.

302
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,760
But, kid.

303
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,210
Are you sure you can stay calm,

304
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,760
won’t do any drunken mistake?

305
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,040
Let alone that

306
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,680
I’m not interested in 99 percent

307
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,640
of girls in reality.

308
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,800
Even if I am,

309
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,720
it’ll never be you.

310
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,880
When you are living with Qi Nian,

311
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,240
have you ever had a maggot in your mind?

312
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,080
Shame on you!

313
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,400
You do have!

314
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,320
You always pretended to be pure.

315
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,520
But you had those dirty thoughts…

316
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,920
Stop! Stop it.

317
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,760
Just drink.

318
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,960
Stop talking nonsense.

319
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,080
I’m just worried.

320
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,000
You’re a boy anyway.

321
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,840
How about this?

322
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,160
I won’t lose control
by lust in this way.

323
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,200
Don’t worry.

324
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,000
I came here just to drink.

325
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,040
I have no other evil idea.

326
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,040
Then let’s just jump to the point.

327
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,680
Here. Have one glass of it

328
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,120
to quench your thirst first.

329
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,040
How is it?

330
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,440
It’s nothing at all.

331
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,000
Take the glass away.

332
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,040
So, what on earth happened last night?

333
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,280
Why… Why are my clothes changed?

334
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,160
Hey! Wait!

335
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,720
Are you crazy?

336
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,480
Can’t you change your clothes
after I go out?

337
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,360
Come on.

338
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,040
This is my home.

339
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,800
Do I have to ask for your permission

340
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,000
on where I should change my clothes?

341
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:42,880
What’s more,

342
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,480
we have done that.

343
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,640
You don’t need to be shy.

344
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,400
You mean…

345
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,000
You and I…

346
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,080
Congratulations.

347
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,960
Your life has entered the next stage.

348
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,200
You don’t need to act purely now.

349
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,360
But it’s really hard

350
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,680
to be your teacher.

351
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,480
You’ll never know how hard it is

352
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,440
to teach a tyro.

353
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:10,960
Shut up!

354
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,080
What?

355
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,520
You don’t admit it?

356
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:16,960
Alright.

357
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,920
Then let’s deal with it
in a grown-up way.

358
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,040
What are you doing?

359
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,720
Money? I will call the police!

360
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,360
You’re doing illegal trade!

361
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,320
You think too much.

362
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,920
You vomited on my wallet last night.

363
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,880
Take it to the laundry shop.

364
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,520
And,

365
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,480
if I have to say,

366
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,840
you’re more valuable than this.

367
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,600
Or why should I make so many efforts

368
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,440
to get you?

369
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,200
I’m not that bored.

370
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,840
You… You are!

371
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,480
You did so many shameless things.

372
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,760
What do you want?

373
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,720
Leave Qi Nian

374
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,320
and come to me.

375
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:56,800
In your dream.

376
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,280
It was before.

377
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,960
But now it’s different.

378
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,200
I’m going to the company.

379
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,480
Just stay at home

380
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,600
and get used to it.

381
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,520
We still have many opportunities.

382
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,760
I’ve got the bath ready for you.

383
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,960
It’s excellent soundproof here.

384
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,840
No one can hear you

385
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,800
even if you cry while bathing.

386
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,920
Enjoy your first day as a man.

387
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:24,880
You…!

388
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,720
Hello. It’s 1:30 a.m.

389
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,600
Let’s see

390
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,080
what our good drinker, Ji Siqi,

391
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,120
is doing.

392
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,000
Ji Siqi, what are you doing?

393
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,440
You’re swimming?

394
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,840
None of your business!

395
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,760
Don’t come over!

396
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,720
How could you throw at me?

397
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,600
You think it’s the park here?

398
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,180
Hello?

399
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,880
Brother, someone is bullying me.

400
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,720
Who is it?

401
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,760
Just someone!

402
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,200
He kissed the girl I like the most.

403
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,560
Right in front of me.

404
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,720
Looks like you still remember it.

405
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,640
Will you give up?

406
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,560
I will if Qi Nian asks me to.

407
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,480
Qi Nian?

408
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,120
Why are you here?

409
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,280
I knew it.

410
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:56,720
Can’t you tell

411
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,120
that I have no feeling for you at all?

412
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,320
I only like your brother.

413
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,640
You’re not even my spare choice.

414
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,400
What are you waiting

415
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,400
while you’re not giving up?

416
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,200
Did I make it so harsh?

417
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,080
Don’t play autism.

418
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,950
Ji Siqi! What… What are you doing?

419
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,040
Say you like me.

420
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,120
Watch carefully.

421
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:25,840
I am not…

422
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,320
Say it!

423
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,440
Just three words.

424
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,040
It’s easy.

425
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,040
I will give up if you say that.

426
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,320
You won’t. OK?

427
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,240
I like you.

428
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,240
Lu Qingwu!

429
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,800
He is still so angry

430
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,680
even if we really did nothing.

431
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,040
What a kid.

432
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,160
You just believe anyone.

433
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,520
Ji Yanxin said

434
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,520
he wants to date me.

435
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,520
What… What did you say?

436
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,080
Are you sure he was not asking
about the date?

437
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,040
I’m not the only one who got it wrong.

438
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,120
It’s not like what

439
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,880
he would say at all.

440
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,720
Wait. Wait. Wait.

441
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,040
I just want to know

442
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,280
before he said that,

443
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,960
what did he do?

444
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,760
Like…

445
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:45,800
Like this.

446
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:49,880
Or…

447
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,360
This.

448
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:56,840
And…

449
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,920
Stop. Stop it.

450
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,480
Do you always do this?

451
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,120
Cut the crap.

452
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,080
Just tell us if he did that.

453
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:12,960
Yes.

454
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,400
Well done! Girl.

455
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,280
That’s my girl.

456
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,880
But I want to refuse.

457
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,310
Why?

458
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,360
You can say I’m ungrateful.

459
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,640
But I’m really not sure

460
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,480
what he is thinking about.

461
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,920
Besides, I am a person

462
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,000
who is insensitive to feelings.

463
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,400
And there is a precedent.

464
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,030
I’m afraid I got it wrong again.

465
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,430
Precedent?

466
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,390
What precedent?

467
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,040
Do you remember there was

468
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,110
a popular guy in our high school?

469
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,400
That… That… Jin…

470
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,120
Jin Xian…

471
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,200
Jin Xianyu.

472
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:48,680
Yes. Right.

473
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,310
Right?

474
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,080
He is one grade elder than us.

475
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,280
With a pretty face,

476
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,830
he was popular for girls.

477
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,640
Like a school hunk.

478
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,360
What’s wrong?

479
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,030
You know each other?

480
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,840
Save it.

481
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,600
Qi Nian was more

482
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,720
unremarkable than now back then.

483
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,870
She was just a home-bound girl.

484
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,960
How could Jin Xianyu

485
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,190
know our Qi Nian?

486
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,310
He said he liked me before.

487
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,600
But days later,

488
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,190
he was together with another girl.

489
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,360
What happened?

490
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,030
He deceived you?

491
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,480
I don’t know.

492
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,200
And I didn’t ask.

493
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,160
Then in our second year in high school,

494
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,200
he went abroad.

495
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,510
And that became a mystery.

496
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,000
Then, did you…?

497
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,680
No. No! No!

498
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,520
How could it be?

499
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,270
I just can’t figure it out.

500
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,000
Why can a boy

501
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,200
say he likes

502
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,400
a girl so hastily

503
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,720
and then disappear

504
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,390
like nothing happened?

505
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,110
Not every boy does that.

506
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,190
Look at me.

507
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,800
For all my life,

508
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,240
I have only said that

509
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:42,910
to this one.

510
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,000
Just shut up.

511
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,400
You’re not one of the samples.

512
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,480
What? Why?

513
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,270
Go away.

514
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,230
Qi Nian,

515
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,150
I know how you are thinking.

516
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,840
But, you have to know.

517
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,320
Although they are all boys,

518
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,480
Ji Yanxin

519
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,070
is way better

520
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,840
than those

521
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,040
normal ones.

522
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,080
You can’t doubt his confession

523
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,550
just because of another unreliable man.

524
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,470
That’s right.

525
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,440
And, he can do this to anyone else.

526
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,950
Why did he only say that to you?

527
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,990
He is not that bored, is he?

528
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,080
But, if you’re still worried,

529
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,830
that means he didn’t give you
enough sense of security.

530
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,360
You should confirm it with him

531
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,750
in your own way directly.

532
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,360
You should confirm it with him

533
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,830
in your own way directly.

534
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:40,720
Qi Bao.

535
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,360
Qi Bao. Qi Bao.

536
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,120
Come here. Come on.

537
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:42,960
Tell me.

538
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,640
Give me some energy, OK?

539
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,150
What is your dad thinking?

540
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,110
Here you are.

541
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,440
Mr. Ji.

542
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,160
Well…

543
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,710
I’m here to give you my answer.

544
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,400
In fact, ever since we met,

545
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,030
I have been the one
to take the initiative.

546
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,800
I was surprised yesterday when you

547
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,910
suddenly went out of your way.

548
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,760
So I’m here now just to

549
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,350
confirm something with you.

550
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,150
Go ahead.

551
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,600
Mr. Ji,

552
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,960
did it break out in you

553
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,310
because you haven’t had
that thing for so long?

554
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,800
I know you preserve
your moral integrity.

555
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,470
But…

556
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,680
But it doesn’t mean
you won’t do it, right?

557
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,440
So, I’m lucky that I catch up

558
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,110
with your period, right?

559
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,230
It’s not…

560
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,160
Mr. Ji, calm down.

561
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,910
I’m just guessing about your motives.

562
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,990
Since it’s not a coincidence,

563
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,230
that must be a long-cherished plot.

564
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,040
That means that you

565
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,520
have been interested

566
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,790
in my body for a long time.

567
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,350
That’s so-called “desire”?

568
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,710
Qi Nian,

569
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,560
believe it or not…

570
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,600
Don’t get angry.

571
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,030
I know I’m making it difficult.

572
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,150
Then let’s go back to the simple thing.

573
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:11,790
Mr. Ji,

574
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,270
what kind of feeling do you have for me?

575
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,990
Is it because I look tired

576
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,950
for having been wooing you for long?

577
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,910
Or you think I’m not bad

578
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,150
so you can settle for me.

579
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,550
Or because you want

580
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,070
to look for a better girl
while dating one.

581
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,510
And I’m just a transfer station.

582
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,870
Why do you ask so?

583
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,070
Because love itself

584
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,110
has so many meanings.

585
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,590
If it’s like this,

586
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,350
I can’t rest assured.

587
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,190
Because I like you.

588
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,390
Just this simple.

589
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:58,750
Come here.

590
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,070
You just want a hug while awake, right?

591
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,870
Why did he suddenly confess?

592
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,200
Am I the only one

593
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,510
who thinks it’s too fast?

594
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,670
You’re not the only one.

595
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,710
I…

596
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:40,830
Like…

597
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,350
You.

598
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,580
(I like you.)

599
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:50,720
Actually,

600
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,640
I also think it went too fast.

601
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,320
It’s fine in the comic.

602
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,560
But it’s like a rocket in the real life.

603
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,760
You were still at the south pole
in the morning,

604
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,470
and now you are having a party
on the equator.

605
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,160
That’s a wild couple.

606
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,190
I can’t hold it.

607
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:03,950
Hold what?

608
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,070
Who is by your side?

609
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,040
No one.

610
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,430
I’m drawing alone.

611
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,110
Drawing?

612
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,670
I heard the voice of a guy.

613
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:25,990
No!

614
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:27,830
Alright.

615
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,240
Although the story is a little jumpy,

616
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,080
you’re already in a relationship.

617
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,950
You should know exactly what to do.

618
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,190
Do what?

619
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,110
What do you think?

620
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,750
So…

621
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,560
You are already together?

622
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,190
-Of course.
-Kind of…

623
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,670
What do you mean by “kind of”?

624
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,990
“Together” means many things.

625
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,230
Now we are just formally together…

626
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,990
You think it’s not enough?

627
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:17,720
No!

628
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,350
It’s enough.

629
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,430
I mean, we can slow down a little bit.

630
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,280
Yanxin,

631
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,830
stop pushing Qi Nian.

632
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,960
You’re suddenly in a relationship.

633
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,910
She must need time to get used to it.

634
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,470
Don’t worry.

635
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,720
I will follow up

636
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,040
with all the process.

637
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,640
Making sure you will be sweet

638
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,990
is one of my duties.

Miss Baby Seven,

642
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,190
please render your help.

643
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,510
It’s Shao Zui’s idea?

644
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,200
Why do you have to

645
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,190
work under his eyes?

646
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,560
I’m not doing this for him.

647
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,950
It’s for Dress for the Beauty.

648
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,230
Qi Nian,

649
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,680
since you’re already in a relationship,

650
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,680
can you update some daily stories

651
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,030
of the couple of you two?

652
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,510
Couple?

653
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,030
I think it’s a good idea.

654
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,510
But, what do couples always do?

655
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,990
I have no experience.

656
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,080
Don’t worry.

657
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,430
Look what I took here.

658
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,230
The gift pack from the beach camping
last time.

659
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,870

663
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,550
The most important thing is this.

664
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,910
Lover’s overnight set.

665
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,440
Alright.

666
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,440
Leave those here.

667
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,440
And the juvenile, go home.

668
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,520
What are you doing?

669
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,670

00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,320
I want to watch you two…

673
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:58,880
If you don’t go,

674
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,950
I will arrange blind dates for Shao Zui.

675
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,350
Is he going on blind dates?

676
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,950
There are so many things in pairs.

And lovers’ slippers.

679
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,760
This is so cute.

680
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,430
Let me put it on.

681
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,270
Does it look good?

682
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,680
Don’t even try.

683
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,720
But they are a pair.

684
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,080
Try it and let me have a look.

685
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:49,680
OK?

686
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:50,390
Please.

687
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,080
If you don’t wear it,

688
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,470
I will take off mine.

689
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,110
Alright.

00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,600
First step of a couple’s life,

691
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,270
make nicknames.

692
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,560
Mr. Ji,

693
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,880
what do you always call me?

694
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,840
Qi Nian.

695
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,470
Nothing else?

696
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:16,710
So cold.

697
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,470
But you always call me mister.

698
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,040
I’m used to it

699
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,390
and I can’t change it out of blue.

700
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,070
Then, call me by my name from now on.

701
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:25,990
Can I?

702
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,550
Ji Yanxin.

703
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,590
Ji Yanxin.

704
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,590
What’s up?

705
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,760
No. This is…

706
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,070
This is too much.

707
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,270
Let’s move to the next round.

708
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,240
The second step of a couple’s life.

709
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,390
Change each other’s alias.

710
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,860
(Prof. Ji)

711
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,550
Is it so simple?

712
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,040
At the beginning,

713
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,320
when I got your number,

714
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,230
you were still our professor.

715
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,240
Mr. Ji, what’s my alias?

716
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:06,750
Your phone.

717
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,400
No way.

718
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,040
Why?

719
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:09,910
Let me have a look.

720
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:10,440
No.

721
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,070
Just one look.

722
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,840
One look!

723
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,400
I just want to know.

724
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,040
Let me see it.

725
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:15,710
Don’t go!

726
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,760
I just want to see

727
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,400
what alias you will make

728
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,630
as a man who can’t remember names.

729
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:27,760
“My girl”?

730
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,720
(My girl)
I saw it.

731
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,350
Mr. Ji,

732
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,150
this is how you call me?

733
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,760
You call me your girl?

734
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,630
Don’t laugh.

735
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,550
Is that wrong?

736
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,800
No.

737
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,120
I just think that

738
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:46,680
it doesn’t

739
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,630
quite fit your image as a professor.

740
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,150
Then let’s change them together.

741
00:36:54,260 --> 00:37:00,620
(Boyfriend Girlfriend)

742
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,400
That’s it.

743
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,950
It looks better now.

744
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,190
From now on,

745
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,550
you’re my boyfriend.

746
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:10,950
Hello,

747
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,110
