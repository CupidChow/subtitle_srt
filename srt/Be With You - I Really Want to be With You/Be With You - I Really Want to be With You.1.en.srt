There’s something you need to know.

22
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,160
I like you. And you?

23
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:58,660
(I)

24
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:58,980

That’s my answer.

30
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,360
(I also like you.)
New stage, new relationship,

31
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,840
and new excitement.

32
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,080
Coming soon.

33
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,400
That’s a wrap!

34
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,000
Finished the whole thing!

35
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,480
Get up. Proofread it before going home.

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,440
I haven’t had any sleep for two days.

37
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,680
AC at home stopped working,

38
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,000
but I can’t afford to fix it.

Don’t wanna get up.

41

I really need a nap.

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,600
What the hell is this?

45
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,080
That’s an unexpected twist.

46
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,840
Can’t they have a romantic confession?

47
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,080
That love line sucks!

48
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,360
I’m just glad it ends.

49
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,600
I like the drawing and everything,

50
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,120
but the romance part stinks.

51
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,240
Those two have been through everything

52
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,640
and only won at the last moment.

53
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,640
There’s no contact from nose down.

54
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,680
Parents’ guide is unnecessary.

55
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,120
Comments were few at first,

56
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,960
but now they’re
flooding into the last chapter.

57
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,640
Isn’t that normal?

58
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,560
Readers are under huge stress.

59
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,520
They need to blow off their steam.

60
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,320
Really?

61
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,480
Baby Seven’s work
has been serialized for over a year,

62
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,240
but neither she nor her work has made on

63
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,760
the list of Best Authors or Best Works.

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,280
What’s your explanation
as her executive editor?

65
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,640
She’s been on the list of Most Updates.

66
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,680
Her best record is three times per week.

67
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,440
Why bother if no one is reading it?

68
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,840
Kids these days can write Mary-sues

69
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,440
or draw something romantic.

70
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,080
Is it really that hard?

71
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,360
As a matter of fact,

72
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,520
it is to Baby Seven.

73
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,760
She started from comics for boys.

74
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,040
I don’t care about her past.

75
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,200
Commercial comics are
all about popularity.

76
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,840
If she

77
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,520
doesn’t jazz up her next work,

78
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,600
then don’t bother to show up again.

79
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,320
-What’s that noise?
-What happened?

80
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:31,880
Baby Seven!

81
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,600
Didn’t you hear what Chief Editor said?

82
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,080
You can’t afford

83
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,200
to make more mistakes.

84
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,760
If your next work still fails,

85
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,240
that’s likely to end your career.

86
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,320
You’ll be doomed.

87
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,120
There’ll be no second chance, got it?

88
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,200
I know.

89
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,320
I won’t let that happen.

90
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,880
So I’ve announced in my next work...

91
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,640
Hold on.

92
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,280
Didn’t you say couples are into

93
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,320
physical contact?

94
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,840
So I’ve arranged that

95
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,680
since the very beginning.

96
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,120
I call it Wrestling Love.

97
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,720
Wrestling my foot!

98
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,160
That sounds crude instead of romantic.

99
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,560
Who’d read it?

100
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,320
And,

101
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,440
why are all your male characters

102
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,200
muscular?

103
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,520
Muscles are the best to show

104
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,560
sexuality and strength.

105
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,360
And drawing a six-pack is super easy

106
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,240
by simply making

107
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,080
a cat sticking its tongue out.

108
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,000
Shut up.

109
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,640
Let’s say I’m fine with your style,

110
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,760
but add some sparks between the couple.

111
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,400
That’s how you create a best seller.

112
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,560
Yet you have them spar.

113
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,880
How is that romantic?

114
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,720
What do you feel if someone hits on you?

115
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,360
Your heart starts racing.

116
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,400
You... You’ve never felt
your heart racing?

117
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,880
I’ve heard of heart attacks.

118
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,520
How can a heart race?

119
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,350
What are you doing?

120
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,050
(Wolf Girl and Black Prince)
(Kamisama Love)

121
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,320
I’m an editor,

122
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,320
not a relationship counselor.

123
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:06,880
Read these yourself.

124
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,800
But you asked me
to stay away from them

125
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,520
to not affect my inspiration.

126
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,720
I wish they could knock
some sense into you.

127
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,360
If you could model
your characters on them,

128
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,120
that’d be a relief!

129
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,080
Listen,

130
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,120
new works selection of this month

131
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,120
is your last chance.

132
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,800
If you botch that up,

133
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,800
you’re screwed!

134
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,360
But...

135
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:22,880
No buts.

136
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,640
5 pm tomorrow.

137
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,160
Hand in your new design
of the male character.

138
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,240
If I see another muscle man,

139
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,640
I’ll crush your head with my biceps.

140
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,800
Got it, got it. Ouch!

141
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,270
Ow…!

142
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,240
You... You’ve never felt
your heart racing?

143
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,480
Heart racing, aside from
the abstract meaning,

144
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,360
normally refers to
heart beating too fast.

145
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,320
Caffeine and sports can do that.

146
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,000
What’s it to do with me?

147
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,160
And I mean, if someone

148
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,080
does make my heart race,
I’ll be in trouble.

149
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,800
Beef jerky.

150
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,720
Where’s your owner?

151
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,720
Do you want this?

152
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:32,640
So adorable.

153
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,400
Qi Bao.

154
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,280
I’m also surnamed Qi,

155
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,800
so we’re sort of family.

156
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,920
Are you asking me to
help you find your owner?

157
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,040
Fine.

158
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,640
I have no inspiration anyway.

159
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,480
It’s better to take you home.

160
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,640
Finished.

161
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,960
Let’s go.

162
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,200
Qi Bao. Qi Bao. Qi Bao!

163
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,180
(Red Joy)

164
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,440
Qi Bao!

165
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,920
Qi Bao! Slow down!

166
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,940
(Jiulianshan Rd.)

167
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,880
Where are you going?

168
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,720
Slow down. I can’t keep up with you.

169
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,560
Where are you taking me?

170
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,260
(Lijiang West Rd.)

00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,920
Slow down. Don’t run so fast.

172
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,680
Qi Bao.

173
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,000
Where were you?

174
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,240
Thank you.

175
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,360
The leash.

176
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,760
Sorry for troubling you.

177
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,800
No, not at all.

178
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,640
Don’t mention it.

179
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,640
Did it eat your snacks?

180
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,720
It needs more food to grow.

181
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,000
Is it a boy or a girl? How old is it?

182
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,200
A 5-year-old boy.

183
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,600
Are you raising him alone?

184
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,760
That must be hard.

185
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,520
What was that?

186
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:54,140
♪Pretend I don’t care♪

188

I’m sorry.

189
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,600
It’s OK.

190
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,840
Just an accident.

191
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,520

00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,720
What’s going on?

195
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,120
Why is my heart beating so fast?

196
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,400
Do I have a congenital heart disease

197
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,800
that acts up after being kissed?

198
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,000
Are you OK?

199
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,600
I’m fine. I’m good.

200
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:50,760
Qi Bao!

201
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,400
Let go.

202
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:58,560
Sorry.

203
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,800
I’ll pay for these.

204
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,520
I don’t need your money.

205
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,160
Can you give me your number instead?

206
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,400
The one I can reach you directly.

207
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,640
Excuse me.

208
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,480
I don’t care where you are.
Get your ass back.

209
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,240
ASAP!

210
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,600
What is it?

211
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,880
I was wrong about the deadline.

212
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,800
It’s today.

213
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,080
You mean 5 o’clock this afternoon?

214
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,840
There’s less than one hour.

215
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,400
I’m hanging up.

216
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,720
Could you wait here for me?

217
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,000
I know it’s abrupt

218
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,640
but I really need a huge favor

219
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,200
from you.

220
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,400
It’s OK if you say no.

221
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,480
Well, I gotta run.

222
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,800
Just forget about everything I said.

223
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,720
I’m sorry.

224
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,300
(MC)

225
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,880
I’m here!

226
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,840
How long do I have?

227
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,240
30 minutes. Where’s your drawing?

228
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,000
Haven’t started it yet.

229
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,080
What?

230
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,210
It’s in my head. Let’s go.

231
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,800
How long do you need?

232
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,600
Almost done.

233
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,240
Baby Seven.

234
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,960
I didn’t ask you to not
interrupt your work.

235
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,440
Are you sure you got it covered?

236
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,440
Although it’s only a sketch,

237
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,640
I’m sure

238
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,280
the story about him

239
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,720
is gonna be good.

240
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,960
No, it’s gonna be a hit.

241
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,800
Yes.

242
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,560
Where are you?

243
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,640
By the lake waiting for someone

244
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,600
who might not show up.

245
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,840
I’ll go back to the firm
after walking Qi Bao.

Better than good!

261
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,080
Did you suddenly grow a magic hand

262
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,240
that could draw other than muscles?

263
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,720
I’m surprised your character is so hot.

264
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,200
And this heart-melting kiss

265
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,880
is text-book romance.

266
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,880
What’s gotten into you?

267
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,000
Have you and your style both changed?

268
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,840
It was exciting.

269
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,000
I mean the heart attack you said.

270
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,000
It’s heart racing.

271
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,600
I’ve felt it.

272
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,280
So this heart-throb

273
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,200
and the kiss…

274
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,240
They’re real.

275
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:54,560
And he looks hotter in person.

276
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,440
Hey, girl,

277
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,760
listen, you must publish this.

278
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,760
Use what you have
to build the character.

279
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,200
Materials can be gathered easily.

280
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,880
So where is he now?

281
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,720
Let’s go meet him.

282
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,520
Maybe...

283
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,560
You...

284
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,920
No way is he still here.

285
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,520
What am I thinking?

286
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,680
But if there’s the slightest hope,

287
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,360
I want to see him again.

288
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:40,560
I knew it.

289
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:58,320
Hello.

290
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,280
Have you found that heart-throb?

291
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,240
Send me a video of him.

292
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,240
He’s gone without leaving a number.

293
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,640
What now?

294
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,160
Listen to me.

295
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,560
You must find him

296
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,160
at all costs.

297
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,400
God, please,

298
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,560
don’t let him leave the city.

299
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:54,720
-Mr. Ji.
-Mr. Ji.

300
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,760
Mr. Ji.

301
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:58,760
Mr. Ji.

302
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:02,920
Mr. Ji.

303
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,640
Mr. Ji.

304
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,080
Mr. Ji, Mr. Shao is waiting inside.

305
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,760
Your tie is worn backwards.

306
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,880
I’m off work already.

307
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,440
Finally, we can leave.

308
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,000
Did you make this puzzle box?

309
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,720
Where’s the opening?

310
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,880
I tried but didn’t find it.

311
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,440
What is this?

312
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,920
This is a mortise-tenon box.

313
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,840
Not for amateurs.

314
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,640
Architects are indeed dexterous.

315
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,600
But what’s the point of making

316
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,360
so many boxes if only you can open them?

317
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,240
None of your business. Now, shoot.

318
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,400
What brings you here?

319
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,840
What else other than your marriage?

320
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,760
Miss Li called earlier.

321
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,800
Your grandpa is in rage

322
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,640
and he’s gonna
give you a good talking-to.

323
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,400
You’d better lie low.

324
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,880
He made that decision without asking me.

325
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,960
That’s not my problem.

326
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,080
Then do something.

327
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,040
If you were seeing someone,

328
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,880
he wouldn’t

329
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,040
rush you every day.

330
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:39,760
Who says I’m not?

331
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,040
You are?

332
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,720
Then tell me,

333
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,320
when was the last time

334
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:48,800
you had physical contact with a girl?

335
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:50,880
Do you remember that?

336
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,000
This afternoon.

337
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,360
What? Am I... Hearing it right?

338
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,480
Who was it? How close were you?

339
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,560
That was an accident.

340
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,680
Just a simple touch.

341
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:13,560
She...

342
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,880
Touch? Where?

343
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,000
You two... Kissed?

344
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,440
She... She kissed you first?

345
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,120
The other way round, I think.

346
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,400
What does she look like? How old is she?

347
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,320
Is she hot?

348
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,440
Not interested.

349
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,200
You’re looking for someone? Who?

350
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,280
A heart-throb.

351
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,400
My hero of the book, to be accurate.

352
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,600
Is he dead?

353
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,560
Does he exist?

354
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,840
(Datong Sliced Noodles)

355
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,040
How like-minded are you!

356
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,920
Are you really my friends?

357
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,240
But how is it possible?

358
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,480
I thought your heart is made of steel.

359
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,520
No one and nothing can melt you.

360
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,960
Were love your thing,

361
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,160
you wouldn’t still be single.

362
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,880
I don’t believe you either.

363
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,640
The thing called love

364
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,640
isn’t in your gene.

365
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,560
Or, you’d fall head over heels for me

366
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,600
before being taken by Liu Xia.

367
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,480
You...

368
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,600
Ow! Ow! Ow!

369
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,960
Laugh all you want.

370
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,120
I couldn’t believe it myself

371
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,400
that I’d have a crush on a stranger.

372
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,280
I’m probably drowsy.

373
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,960
Somebody better wake me up.

374
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:30,880
Who was it?

(Datong Sliced Noodles)

376
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,520
Sorry, sorry.

377
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,160
My... My friend got dumped
and drank too much.

378
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,320
I’ll make her apologize to you.

379
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:40,800
Come here.

380
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,560
Come. Sit back.

381
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,280
Sit down.

382
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,000
-There, there.
-It’s OK.

383
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,080
It’s OK.

384
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,920
Uh... Madam,

385
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,720
did you get dumped?

386
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,160
No, it’s my friend.

387
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,840
She got rejected. Sorry.

388
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,800
I’m sorry.

389
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,240
I see. That makes sense.

390
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,520
Excuse me?

391
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,640
What’s wrong with me?

392
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,200
Let’s go.

393
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,820
(Department of Architecture,
Chunming University)

394
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,520
Hold on.

395
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,160
Department of Architecture,
Chunming University.

396
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,400
You too?

397
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,200
I’m sorry.

398
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,400
Never mind. Take care of your friend.

399
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,160
She’s been through a lot.

400
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:24,640
I’m sorry.

401
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,280
You know her?

402
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,000
No.

403
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,120
But I know

404
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,800
who hurt her.

405
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,320
Who?

406
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,440
Chunming’s unique asset,

407
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,520
the hotshot in our department,

408
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,160
Prof. Ji.

409
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,000
Who is that?

410
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,320
Every year when freshmen arrive,

411
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,680
he’ll give lectures

412
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,720
as the visiting professor.

413
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,760
Girls all over the campus

414
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,840
are crazy about him,

415
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,760
but he drives lecturers and TAs crazy.

416
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,440
Why?

417
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,080
As charming as he is,

418
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,960
he’s cold as ice.

419
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,440
He never

420
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,040
remembers students’ names

421
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,680
but only their IDs,

422
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,120
and there’s no
communication between them.

423
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,800
TA is the messenger.

424
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,800
How did you know all that?

425
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,960
Because I’m the one

426
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,640
who has to get him TAs.

427
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,680
I’m a guidance counselor,

428
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,920
not his babysitter.

429
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:21,840
And now,

430
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,800
all his students hate me.

431
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,800
He doesn’t like any of them.

432
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,120
My life is hell!

433
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,120
You know, my boss is no better.

434
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,480
He’s a walking iceberg.

435
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,640
There’s no human touch
in him or his work.

436
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,600
But he’s already

437
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,960
won the highest award
in the industry this young.

438
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,520
His look and talents top others’.

439
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,200
So his temper can be tolerated.

440
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,240
Qi Nian, is your heart-throb like that?

441
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:49,960
Of course not.

442
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,440
What are you doing?

443
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,680
Looking for a lost dog.

444
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,960
At 5 pm on May 5th,

445
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,360
I lost a Golden Retriever

446
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,280
by the lake in Huangdao,

447
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,040
named Qi Bao.

448
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,120
He’s five years old,

449
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,080
gentle and loves snacks.

450
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,520
The man who walked him

451
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,720
is charismatic.

452
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,680
If you see that man and the dog,

453
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,680
please contact me.
You’ll be rewarded handsomely.

454
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,560
Is that too obvious and brazen?

455
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,160
Hope others can tell

456
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,160
that the man is the whole point.

457
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,860
(Lost Dog)

458
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:50,880
At that time, I thought

459
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,390
as we lived at
opposite ends of the city,

460
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:55,760
we wouldn’t meet again anytime soon.

461
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,120
But the encounter came

462
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,320
sooner than I expected.

463
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,820
(I might’ve seen him
at Chunming University…)

464
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,080

467
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,320
The campus is huge. Where is he?

468
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,800
Good.

469
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,520
No guards in the neighborhood.

470
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:32,780
Excuse me.

471
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,120
I’m not taking photos
of others but the view.

472
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,920
Don’t be nervous.

473
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,840
I’d like to ask you about someone.

474
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:42,920
Go ahead.

475
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,600
I know everyone here.

476
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,440
Have you seen a handsome man

477
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,760
with a Golden Retriever?

478
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,760
There are enough competitors on campus

479
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,280
and here comes more from other schools.

480
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,840
So do you want retouched photos

481
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,880
or raw ones altogether?

482
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:03,800
What?

483
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,560
If you aren’t here to buy photos,

484
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,360
why are you asking about him?

485
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:09,570
To be my prototype.

486
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,560
That might sound complicated.

487
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,710
I should make it simple.

488
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,320
I’ll be blunt.

489
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,600
I want him to be mine.

490
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,840
I’ve met tons of hardcore fans,

491
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,400
but they aren’t as blunt as she is.

492
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,240
Did anything happen

493
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,600
between you guys?

494
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,360
Does a kiss count?

495
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,640
Kiss?

496
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,520
On what?

497
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,600
On… the lips.

498
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,680
There she is!

499
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,120
That freshman again who snaps pictures.

500
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,600
-They’re worse than flies.
-Over there.

501
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,320
Come here. Come.

502
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:52,920
Come here.

504
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,680
Why?

505
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,160
Trust me. You’ll thank me later.

506
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,000
Stop! I’ve had eyes on you for long.

507
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,600
Stop!

508
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,200
Stop!

509
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,000
He’s hot!

510
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,680
So cool!

511
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
It’s him!

512
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:36,800
Who?

513
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,360
Do you regret it now?

514
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,440
Yeah. I should’ve known it.

515
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,000
Who else deserves
to be called a hotshot?

516
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,840
OK.

517
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,560
The class is full. Let’s begin.

518
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:10,800
No roll call?

519
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,720
I’ve told you already

520
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,480
that his class is always full.

521
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,720
Roll call is unnecessary.

522
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,760
Here it is. That’s it.

523
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,400
That’s it.

524
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,400
What’s happening?

525
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,920
Why are they so excited?

526
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,360
This is the once-in-a-year bonus.

527
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,200
Of course everyone is thrilled.

528
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,040
Are those who took this course last year

529
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:38,760
also here?

530
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,440
Me.

531
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,440
Me.

532
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,760
Why are they

533
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,080
taking the same course again?

534
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,000
To challenge ourselves.

535
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,680
I failed last year
and I have to try again.

536
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,440
What did she mean?

537
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,800
Chinese Mortise-tenon

538
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,000
is widely used in structures
in ancient buildings,

539
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,800
such as beams, pillars and brackets.

540
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,360
It’s also a clear proof

541
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,640
of how skilled

542
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,080
the ancient architects are.

543
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,360
The puzzle box I’m holding

544
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,280
is one example.

545
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,400
You’re welcome

546
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,720
to try to open it.

547
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,840
Like last year,

548
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,240
whoever succeeds

549
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,880
will be granted a request.

550
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,360
Extra points in the exam?

551
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,280
Your WeChat account?

552
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,240
That’s nothing.
I’d ask for individual tutoring.

553
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,160
In your dreams!
I want one-on-one tutoring.

554
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,200
I want an exclusive bonus.

555
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,920
You’re hot, Prof. Ji!

556
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,640
Sit down!

557
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,040
This year’s box
must be more difficult.

558
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,080
Those girls have to wait another year.

559
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:45,720
What to do?

560
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,400
I can’t help drawing muscles

561
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,910
whenever I’m excited.

562
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,280
Leave me alone. I’m busy.

563
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,920
Professor, I’m taking notes.

564
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,000
So you must’ve written down

565
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,560
everything I said.

566
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,360
Alright. Class is over.

567
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,280
Come to my office later

568
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:23,880
for a quiz.

569
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,760
Bring your notebook.

570
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,880
Congrats. The first-ever
detention winner.

571
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,760
This is your first day

572
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,400
and you’ve already enjoyed so much.

573
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,140
Shut up.

574
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,800
Now, you can try to open it.

575
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,480
Prof. Ji, Director Shen asks to see you.

576
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,000
I see.

577
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:51,950
Wait here for me.

578
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,280
What? What did he say?

579
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,440
He asked you to wait here for him.

580
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,320
Give me. Give me. Give me.

581
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:04,920
Can’t open it.

582
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,760
Is there a way?

583
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,320
Let me try it.

584
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,680
I’ll have them put together

585
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,880
profiles of guests at the symposium.

586
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,080
Thanks. There will be a huge crowd.

587
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:18,600
You got this?

588
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:19,840
I’ll do my best.

589
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:21,750
It’s open!

590
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,040
I’m about to get married.

591
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:06,840
Congratulations.

592
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,920
Aren’t you gonna ask who the groom is?

593
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,920
We’re in a relationship,

594
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,040
but why am I suddenly
marrying someone else?

595
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:16,920
We aren’t that close

596
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,000
as to have a relationship.

597
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,600
If there’s nothing else...

598
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,800
What do you not like about me?

599
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,760
What’s wrong with me?

600
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,440
Your grandpa has accepted me.

601
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,520
You want an answer?

602
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,320
Qi Bao doesn’t like you.

603
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,440
If I remember correctly, that’s your...

604
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,520
Yes, that’s my dog,

605
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,320
a Golden Retriever who greeted you

606
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,080
when you first came to our place.

607
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:53,960
You avoided him by instinct

608
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,080
which made him
lose his appetite for a while.

609
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,000
Is that a serious problem?

610
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,480
It is.

611
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,240
But we’re talking about a dog.

612
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,440
Correct.

613
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,120
Let’s call it a day, Miss Lin.

614
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,520
It’s Li.

615
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,440
Whatever.

616
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:21,830
Yes?

617
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,160
Qi Bao is missing?
