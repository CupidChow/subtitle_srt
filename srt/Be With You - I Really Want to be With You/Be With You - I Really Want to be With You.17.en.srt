20
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,240
It’s a little frequent that you come

21
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,670
to meet me recently, isn’t it?

22
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,830
Whoever doesn’t know

23
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,790
may think there’s something between us.

24
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,000
This is the contract for my next work.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,080
As long as you agree with my conditions,

26
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,390
I’ll update it on MC’s platform.

27
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:11,990
Generous.

28
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,670
Does Mr. Xiao know?

29
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,750
I’m always in charge of my contract.

30
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,360
As long as it’s my decision,

31
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,630
he won’t disagree at all.

32
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,350
Really?

33
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,310
But, I don’t think so.

34
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,000
How would he give away

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,150
his cash cow?

36
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:27,920
Well, it’d be a later story.

37
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,590
It doesn’t matter.

38
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,680
What I’m curious about now

39
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,430
is your condition.

40
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,990
I’d like to get somebody from you.

41
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,790
It’s Qi Nian’s assistant, Ji Siqi.

42
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,310
I want a full contract with him.

43
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,670
Ji Siqi?

44
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,480
Not Qi Nian?

45
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,190
Yes, he’s just a nobody.

46
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,950
It wouldn’t be hard

47
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,390
Yeah, that should be the case.

48
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,120
But now we’ve signed the contract…

49
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,350
I can pay several times

50
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,240
What else do you want?

51
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,830
I can promise them all.

52
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,030
Don’t bother.

53
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,640
What I’m saying is,

54
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,750
about an hour ago,

55
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,110
Ji Siqi has signed

56
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,680
So, he’s no longer

57
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,830
a staff of MC anymore.

58
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,590
Sorry, I couldn’t help.

59
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,750
Whose idea was it?

60
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,590
What about Qi Nian?

61
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,030
Did she just let him go right away?

62
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,800
I don’t know if there’s

63
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,200
any misunderstanding between you.

64
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,910
But it was Qi Nian who asked

65
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,230
Ji Siqi to do so.

66
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:37,410
Hello?

67
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,710
It’s me.

68
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,520
Do you still remember

69
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,350
what you said at the hotel by the sea?

70
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,830
Ji Siqi is a rare talent.

71
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,390
It’s a waste for him

72
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,600
If he works for me,

73
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,280
his achievements in comics

74
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,590
will be limitless.

75
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,950
You’re correct.

76
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,750
Staying by my side will only

77
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,870
He deserves a better working

78
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,470
So, I’d like to let him go.

79
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,200
That makes sense,

80
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,790
but isn’t it too harsh?

81
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,430
You broke off the contract directly.

82
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,230
He would be very upset.

83
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,630
I know.

84
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,120
But if not,

85
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,190
he wouldn’t leave.

86
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,030
I know that you care about him,

87
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,120
but I hope that you can

88
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,630
comply with your promise before

89
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:26,550
to cultivate him well,

90
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,510
instead of making him your money tree.

91
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,070
Got it.

92
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:34,990
Thanks.

93
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,080
Brat.

94
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,230
Fooling around at night again.

95
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,750
(HOME)

96
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,330
This place...?

97
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,420
(HOME)

98
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,470
Why are you sitting here at night?

99
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,430
Ji Siqi?

100
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,870
Are you drunk?

101
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,350
Did you

102
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,550
see my pen?

103
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,830
What pen?

104
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,550
Is it important?

105
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,310
It’s a G-pen for the lines

106
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,390
from Qi Nian.

107
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,030
I couldn’t find it.

108
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,750
So what if you could?

109
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,030
You can no longer stay with her.

110
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,870
It’s terminated.

111
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,030
Don’t look back.

112
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:50,810
Why?

113
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,370
What did I do wrong?

114
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,610
Please take care of him in the future.

115
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:45,930
Get up.

116
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,050
Stay here just for the night.

117
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,530
Have a good sleep

118
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,370
and we’ll talk tomorrow.

119
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,620
Don’t worry.

120
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,050
I’ll go to another room.

121
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,730
I won’t take advantages from you.

122
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,730
Ji Siqi.

123
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,220
Do you know what you’re doing?

124
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:12,850
Yes.

125
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,050
If you don’t want to regret it,

126
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,250
back off now.

127
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,490
No.

128
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,060
You brat.

129
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,060
Look at me.

130
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,220
Who am I?

131
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,130

132
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,370

Did I sleep here?

135
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,770
Of course.

136
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,420
It’s late.

137
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,220
Why didn’t you wake me up?

138
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,170
You’re having a hangover.

139
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,930
Was I drunk yesterday?

140

I’m sorry.

I’m not good enough to be your partner,

either to be the chief editor.

Everyone has got his own way.

159
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:46,610
You were correct.

160
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,170
It was a cruel but

161
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,970
necessary step for him.

165
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,900
and have a cold shower

166

I’ll not bring alcohol next time.

169
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,010
Is it about alcohol?

170
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,650
What is it about then?

171
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,010

00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,420
Mr. Ji.

176
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,450
It’s time for morning meeting.

177
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,810
Send them to my office.

178
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,050
What, what should I do?

179
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:19,980
Everyone’s here.

180
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,620
Good.

181
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,370
Let’s start.

182
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,740
He was tender last second

183
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,420
but started to tease me

184
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,490
Is it so hard to figure out

185
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,420
That’s okay, I can do it.

186
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,570
About the Quancheng’s ancient

187
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,090
based on the feedback from

188
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,620
all the residents living there

189
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,650
have left already.

190
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,540
Thanks to Mr. Ji

191
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,890
for finding that master of endorsement.

192
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,420
For all the recycling materials

193
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,140
like the tiles in the repair

194
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,340
must be inspected

195
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:53,050
by the builders before tearing down.

196
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,340
All the components must be

197
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,500
carefully taken care of while mending.

198
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,660
Be extra careful,

199
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,020
pile the materials in order.

200
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,050
Prevent them from rain.

201
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,340
At places where cars pass by,

202
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,250
wrap them up with plastic cloths

203
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,250
in case they stumble while shipping.

204
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,890
Due to the fact that section B is...

205
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,250
It’s about time.

206
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,420
Let’s call it a day.

207
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,250
Go back to work now.

208
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,690
Can I get out now?

209
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,250
Whatever.

210
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,610
So outrageous!

211
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,940
There’s more.

212
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,650
Do you want to know?

213
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,450
So loud.

214
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,130
Who set the alarm?

215
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:14,850
I did.

216
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,530
You didn’t leave?

217
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,540
Get dressed.

218
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,210
It’s time for breakfast.

219
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,500
What are you looking at?

220
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,300
Don’t you know how to eat breakfast?

221
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,290
You’re already this age.

222
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,290
Strawberry jam or blueberry jam?

223
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,210
Strawberry.

224
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:06,810
Wait.

225
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:07,860
Wait.

226
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,370
What I’m trying to say is...

227
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,250
Eat and sleep silently.

228
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,130
You’re worse.

229
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,780
Oh my, why is he suddenly

230
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,090
like his brother?

231
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,050
About last night...

232
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:29,890
I’m finished.

233
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,010
Just a few words,

234
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,850
hear me out and go later.

235
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,060
Hurry up.

236
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,130
I need to leave for a morning meeting.

237
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,220
Okay.

238
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,170
Listen carefully,

239
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,690
start from today,

240
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:47,930
I’d like to date you.

241
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,730
Okay, I’m done.

242
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,090
What’s your answer?

243
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,410
Save it.

244
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,410
I need to be responsible for you.

245
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,780
Who needs that?

246
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,890
Stop acting like you’re mature.

247
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,940
I, Lu Qingwu,

248
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:15,740
am not tragic enough

249
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,610
to be sympathized by a kid.

250
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,050
I’m not sympathizing.

251
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,050
Do you like me then?

252
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,090
I don’t think so.

253
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,820
Thank you

254
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,290
for forcing yourself to be

255
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,450
That’s impressive.

256
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,410
I don’t hate you.

257
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,290
It’s a half-half situation.

258
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,780
Currently,

259
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,100
I haven’t built a profound

260
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,330
relationship with you.

261
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,860
Because what you did

262
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,420
on the day we met

263
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,970
was trying my patience all the time.

264
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,970
It freaked me out every time.

265
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,650
I’d like to ask you,

266
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,340
do you really like me?

267
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,340
Of course I do.

268
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,010
Why would I...

269
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,290
But it’s different from dating.

270
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,290
Get up now.

271
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:14,850
Get up.

272
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,780
From now on,

273
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,850
let’s pretend that nothing happened.

274
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,090
Let’s be strangers again.

275
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,460
Don’t come to me again.

276
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,330
Wait, you...

277
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,770
You’ll see!

278
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,780
You’re late.

279
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,300
I’m late again.

280
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,140
Stupid machine.

281
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,010
Can it stop working?

282
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,210
Program crash.

283
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:00,930
(Crash)

284
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:01,660
Program crash.

285
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,570
Really?

286
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,250
It’d be better to erase the data, too.

287
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,540
How come the computers crashed?

288
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,690
Are today’s attendances all gone?

289
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,220
What’s wrong with it?

290
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,050
The data always disappears.

291
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,900
It’s a lucky day again.

292
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:18,970
Seems like I can take more days off.

293
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,100
Days off?

294
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:23,810
Why?

295
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,050
It’s for personal schedule.

296
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,890
Actually for my idol’s fan meeting.

297
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,490
Personal schedule?

298
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,620
Are you the CEO of the company?

299
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,420
Don’t forget

300
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,810
that you’re still in internship.

301
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,940
But I’ve already submitted

302
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,330
an application to the firm.

303
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,330
It’s approved?

304
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,370
And directly from the CEO?

305
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,580
MC is very efficient.

306
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,060
I won’t bother you then.

307
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:55,690
Chief He.

308
00:17:58,630 --> 00:17:59,080
Hello?

309
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,530
Our boss’s secretary

310
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,250
is asking for you.

311
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,890
What should I do now?

312
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,690
I’m done. I’m done.

313
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,100
(MC Culture Limited

314
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,370
Shao Zui, you asked for me?

315
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,650
See for yourself.

316
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,340
(MC Culture Limited

317
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,290
Didn’t the attendance system crash?

318
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,210
Deduct one day’s salary

319
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,260
Deduct all the bonus

320
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,210
if absent for more than three days.

321
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,330
Deduct half the salary

322
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,330
All of them are on manual.

323
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:55,890
Haven’t you read it?

324
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,090
Shao Zui, why are you so furious?

325
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,970
What’s with the attitude?

326
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,370
What attitude do you expect

327
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,020
Now you’re at work,

328
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,410
you should abide by the regulations.

329
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,370
You’re turning to twenty next month.

330
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,100
There’s no such a thing

331
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,290
as accommodation for gown-ups.

332
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,770
If you take one more day off,

333
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,130
you’ll get nothing this month.

334
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,090
So,

335
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,690
do you insist on meeting your idol?

336
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,850
I won’t go then.

337
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,130
I didn’t get the ticket anyway.

338
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,300
Fine, I promise

339
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,730
that I’ll work on time.

340
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:33,170
I swear on my idol’s happiness, okay?

341
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,130
Okay.

342
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:53,610
Sit down.

343
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,140
Train me as if I were Qi Bao?

344
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,730
I wouldn’t be that compliant.

345
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,090
This way, please.

346
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,210
I didn’t expect to meet acquaintances

347
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:24,260
Aren’t you

348
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:24,900
I was

349
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:25,940
but not anymore.

350
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,300
I’m his girlfriend now.

351
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,210
My name is Qi Nian.

352
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,850
Your family name is Qi?

353
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,730
Is Quancheng your hometown?

354
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,210
How did you know?

355
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,050
No wonder he chose you.

356
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,330
He’s sacrificed a lot for the project.

357
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:45,900
Miss Lin.

358
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,130
Please be clear.

359
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,090
Don’t ask me.

360
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,340
Don’t you find it

361
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,690
a bit weird?

362
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,330
What do you mean by that?

363
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,500
I’ve always known

364
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,370
there’s a woman who means a lot

365
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,770
But I can’t believe it’s you.

366
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,170
Think about it.

367
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,410
What does a guy like him

368
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,570
see in you?

369
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,010
Qi Nian,

370
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,380
you’ve been staring

371
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,290
at the menu’s cover for long.

372
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,610
I’m reading it.

373
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:34,820
Didn’t you want to try

374
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,380
their valentine’s set?

375
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:36,900
Yes.

376
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,690
I’ve seen it on recommendations.

377
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,570
It costs 898.

378
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,650
Much more expensive than the others.

379
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,370
Isn’t it a trap?

380
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,330
Maybe because it’s valentine-limited.

381
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,780
Mr. Ji,

382
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,540
let’s order separately then.

383
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,370
It will cost fewer.

384
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:54,890
Fine.

385
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,370
Excuse me.

386
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,330
I’d like to order two single-sets,

387
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,490
Alright, please wait for a while.

388
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,820
(Open)

389
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,610
Qi Nian.

390
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,010
What’s your plan later?

391
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,420
I, I’m going home.

392
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,770
Aren’t you going to the office?

393
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,580
I forgot to tell you

394
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,370
that I’m going to America temporarily.

395
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,450
So, all my work is done.

396
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,690
My whole day will belong to you.

397
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,540
Is there anywhere that you want to go?

398
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:33,170
Or any recommendations?

399
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,620
Wouldn’t it be tiring for you?

400
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,890
Why would it be tiring

401
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,210
to be with someone I like?

402
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:43,570
But do you really like me?

403
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:50,620
(He’s Just Not That Into You)

404
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,450
What are the choices?

405
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,170
They come with the set.

406
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,700
(Animal World)

Nature Documentaries.

409
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,460
A nice science documentary.

410
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,930
It’s just a little old.

411
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,460
It’s must be mistaken.

412
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,610
Ignore it, ignore it.

413
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,650
Seems like we need to wait

414
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:44,930
What’s wrong?

415
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:45,690
You don’t like it?

416
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,780
It’s not like that.

417
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,740
It’s just when scenes like

418
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,300
my parents would surely

419
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,340
cover my eyes.

420
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,010
So when I’m watching it now...

421
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,860
Don’t look at the screen.

422
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:55,730
Look at somewhere else.

423
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:56,570
Sure.

424
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,500
Do you remember what you said

425
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,610
last time I sent you home?

426
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,060
Just this?

427
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,210
Are you a kid?

428
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,330
We’ll continue next time.

429
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:27,770
I’m looking forward to it.

430
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,090
The follow-up you said.

431
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:32,060
I don’t remember exactly.

432
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,650
What did I say?

433
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,930
It’s useless to pretend now.

434
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,570
No wonder he chose you.

435
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,850
He’s sacrificed a lot for the project.

436
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,690
What does a guy like him

437
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,770
see in you?

438
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,460
Qi Nian.

439
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,010
I’m sorry.

440
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,890
I was being impatient.

441
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,130
I can wait

442
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,490
and give you time to adjust.

443
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:24,370
But,

444
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,490
don’t let me wait for too long.

The endorser of Quancheng’s project?

447
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,290
Why do you bring it up?

448
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,660
You know that Quancheng

449
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:38,620
There are only a few people

450
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,810
who are locally prominent.

451
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,900
We happen to know two of them.

452
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:42,700
Do you know...?

453
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,330
Qi Nian,

454
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,890
I know who you’re talking about.

455
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,740
But the boss is in charge of this.

456
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,100
It’s an inside secret.

457
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,850
He never tells us about it.

458
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,780
If we tell you, we may lose our jobs.

459

Isn’t the time when Ji Yanxin

466
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,730
and I just knew each other?

467
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,340
Maybe Ji Yanxin

468
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:03,050
knows more than nothing about me.

469

Who taught you that?

470
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,780
My dad is a building restorer.

471
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,020
There are plenty of them at home.

472
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:16,730
I’ve known it since young.

473
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,500
He wanted something

474
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,890
That’s how he noticed me.

475
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:27,050
He probably dates me for the project.

Hello?

00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,370
Mr. Ji.

There’s a Miss Pei for you.

479
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:56,770
Put her on.

Yes.

Why do you call my company?

484
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,830
Why can’t I?

485
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,100
Do you have more women

Okay, okay.

504
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,010
I told you to wait and see.

505
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:33,920
Don’t you always

506
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,850
want to hire me to work here?

507
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,370
Now, I’ve come voluntarily.

508
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,330
Aren’t you

509
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,490
happy about it?

510
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,410
I told you

511
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,410
to go back to strangers.

512
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:49,130
I’m just here for a job.

513
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,650
Nothing else.

514
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:54,370

This is the office.

518
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,050
And you’re my boss.

519
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,250
So what?

520
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,610
Miss Lu, are you there?

521
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,050
Come in.

00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,700
Miss Lu,

523
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,860
are you coming

524
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,130
It depends.

525
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,980
Well, Jia,

526
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,420
you’ve been busy lately.

527
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,490
Teach this new guy.

528
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,010
Don’t go easy on him.

529
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,700
Blow all the balloons

530
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,100
before the party.

531
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:40,810
Can you do that?

532
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,620
Asking new comers to

533
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,210
prepare for their own welcome party?

534
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,690
Any question?

535
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,930
Are you kidding me?

536
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,060
There are so many of them.

537
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,610
I wouldn’t finish them regardless

538
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,170
Who asked you to blow them with mouth?

539
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,090
Finish it by 4 p.m.

540

542
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:22,900
Hello?

543
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,810
Is it Xin?

Are you getting much more busy?

546
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,060
We’re okay.

547
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,650
Just a little busier than normal.

548
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:35,290
How’s Qi Nian?

549
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:38,810
She’s good.

550
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,780
Her comics are going well.

551
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,490
Don’t worry.

552
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,650
Okay, then.

553
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,260
Xin.

I need to go.

00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,090
Say hello for me to Qi Nian.

556
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:09,740
(Prof. Ji, good morning.)

557
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,980
Next week’s update

558
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,850
is out already?

559
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,860
She’s not only energetic.

560
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,450
She’s on fire.

561
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:27,810
Hey,

562
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,970
how long has she been like this?

563
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,370
Three days.

564
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,770
She doesn’t eat, drink or sleep.

565
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,340
She never leaves her seat

566
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,970
except for going to the toilet.

567
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:40,620
Maybe she’s working hard

568
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,330
to be on dates with Ji Yanxin?

569
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,530
See.

570
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:46,090
This isn’t her normal state

571
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:47,900
If she keeps working

572
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,450
so fiercely like this,

573
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,090
she’d collapse soon.

574
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:57,370
Qi Nian.

00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,100
(MC)

576
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:04,820
Baby Seven, what’s happening?

577
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,370
Is it a guy problem?

578
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:07,540
Ji Yanxin?

579
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,610
Not him.

580
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:14,090
How long have you been together?

581
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,610
Your honeymoon hasn’t finished yet.

582
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,530
Is it a seven-day itch?

583
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:18,740
No.

584
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,730
Maybe it was just my own wish.

585
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:22,660
Baby Seven.

586
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,330
Tell me.

587
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:24,500
Did Ji Yanxin

588
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,690
do anything to hurt you?

589
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,130
Is there another woman?

590
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,580
Did he cheat on you?

591
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,100
With a woman or man?

592
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,770
Nonsense.

593
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,220
Hello, Mr. Shao.

594
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,770
I won’t interrupt you bonding

595
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:36,930
I’ll be at work.

596
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,940
Why is she so afraid of you?

597
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:42,820
Of course.

598
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,300
Everyone is afraid of me

599
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,210
except you.

600
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,300
Let me tell you.

601
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,210
If she keeps doing this,

602
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,770
all of them will know

603
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,130
Why do you look upset?

604
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,540
What did Ji do to hurt you?

605
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:57,180
Yeah, Qi Nian.

606
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,500
Tell us about it.

607
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,180
Did he cheat with a woman

608
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,420
or a man?

609
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,140
We should be clear about the enemy

610
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,770
and come up with a plan.

611
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,500
It’s a girl.

612
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,930
She sounded like a pretty girl.

613
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:14,410
How can you tell from her voice?

614
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,700
I’ve got all the evidence.

615
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:18,860
I asked for the recording

616
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:21,340
of the girl who called his office

617
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,450
that day from Li Yue.

618
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,810
Judged by the graph,

619
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:27,940
she’s not only pretty

620
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,130
but also fair-skinned and rich.

621
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,650
Let me see.

622
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:35,170
She’s indeed pretty.

623
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,100
You think so?

624
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,170
Then it’s true.

625
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,490
Don’t irritate her at this point.

626
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:42,650
Qi Nian,

627
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,650
Ji Yanxin won’t be like that.

628
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,020
By the way,

629
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,140
why don’t you just call him

630
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:50,540
and ask?

631
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,770
His phone is off.

632
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,050
Off?

633
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,220
Ji Yanxin? The workaholic

634
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,780
who would be on call all the time?

635
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,340
Yeah.

636
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,220
He must be guilty.

637
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,690
Or why would he turn

638
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,290
Explain it.

639
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,660
Based on my understanding,

640
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:08,100
he, he shouldn’t be that kind of guy

641
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,250
who’d cheat when he

642
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,740
That’s what I said.

643
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:12,620
Ji Yanxin

644
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,140
may has known this dream girl

645
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,260
a long time ago.

646
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,180
Then, they kept dating in secret.

647
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:19,050
But you found it out this time.

648
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:20,900
I think,

649
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,500
the girl you mentioned

650
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,570
can be Ji Yanxin’s confidante.

651
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:26,770
Hello?

652
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,290
Can you be less irritating?

653
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,650
She’s already having a hard time.

654
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,610
I’m just being honest.

655
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,090
First of all,

656
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:40,210
Ji Yanxin is definitely

657
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:44,850
But if the sun rises in the west

658
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,980
and he cheats on you…

659
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,450
What if he does?

660
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:54,340
Then, then I wish you good luck

661
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,410
on dating another man.

662
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:59,330
