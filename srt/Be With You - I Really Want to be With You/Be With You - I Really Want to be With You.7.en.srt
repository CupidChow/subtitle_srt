Across the road.

22

Why are you standing there?

23
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,120
Like a concrete pole.

24
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,400
Look at the cement on you.

25
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,400
What happened?

26
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:20,920
I don’t know what to say.

27

00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,400
Is it Ji Qiu?

29
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,160
Did she mislead you to the concrete?

30
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,520
Why can you communicate?

31
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,120
(Construction ahead,
please make a detour.)

32
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,120
Let’s go home, Qi Bao.

33
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,240
Don’t play with bad kids.

34
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,680
Come with me.

35
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,360
Let’s go.

36
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,400
Are you gonna abandon me here?

37
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,720
Call me sweetie I’ll think about it.

38
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,400
Bah!

39
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,160
Uncle then.

40
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,200
Anyway, you’re in the same
generation with Qi Bao.

41
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,720
Shao Zui, are you tired of living?

42
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,640
Don’t you think

43
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,400
I can’t get at you!

44
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,640
You are so self-willed,

45
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,800
so Ji Yanxin always treats you

46
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,480
like a child.

47
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,200
You shut up!

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,560
Let’s go find a pet shop for Qi Bao

49
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,160
and clean him up.

50
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,000
Or if your cousin finds out,

51
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,520
you will be in trouble.

52
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,280
Seriously,

53

you finally have a chance
to be with him,

54
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,240
why come out walking the dog?

55
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,600
And messing yourself like this.

56
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,520

57

You are so annoying!

58

all right?

60
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,800
Besides,

61
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,120
what my cousin needs is not me.

62
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,360
You’ve finally realized that. Good.

63
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,440
You think I don’t know

64
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,440
what does he call me on his phone?

65
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:08,920
What?

66
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,080

in his heart

70
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,800
I can’t even compare to

71
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,840
the ten-legged crab.

72
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,800
No, crab only has eight legs,

73
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,120
the other two are pliers.

74

Can you stop

75
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,640
teasing me at this moment?

76
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,840
OK, let’s not talk about you.

77

He can’t remember names.

81
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,960
You know him.

82
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,600
But how can he remember

83
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,840
Qi Nian’s name?

84
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,680
Qi Nian, close the door…

85

You always hope

86
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,440
that someone can change him, do you?

Working. I got no choice. My boss…

Since you have chased her away,

210
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,530
why took her back?

211
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,280
It’s fine to work so late,

212
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,530
how dare you answer her phone call?

213

No.

No.

Professor, is the fever gone?

223
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,890
Don’t change the subject.

224
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,960
I never said that.

225
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,320
But I can’t control

226
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,690
what others think.

227
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,480
Come with me to an event tomorrow.

228
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,210
Where?

229
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,760
They will pick me up.

230
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,930
Be here before seven.

231
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,120

at least 1 hour by subway.

Don’t step out of this room

Suit yourself.

240
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,880
Three rules.

1. Don’t interfere
with homeowner’s work.

2. Don’t enter the prohibited area
of the house.

243
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,210
3. Don’t stay overnight.

244
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,050
I never thought about
staying here overnight.

245
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,490
How…

246

hear anything last night?

00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,560
That’s where I’m useful?

344
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,240
If you want to be useful elsewhere,

345
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,800
we can try to get along and see.

346
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,770
Shut up.

347
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,010
Go.

348
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,230
What’s so noisy there?

349
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,880
Some kind of activity.

350
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,170
Carnival or something.

351
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,010
Prof. Ji?

352
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,560
Stop looking.

353
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,440
I am the only one closest to you.

354
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,210
Just hold me and walk.

355
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,840
Knock it off.

356
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,820
Got it. Let me help you. Be careful.

357

(Rongpin Animation Culture Co, Ltd.
Lu Qingwu’s Signings)

358
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:28,980
(Flower & Romance)

359
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,980
(What did she do
to be treated like this?)

360
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,810
Lousy stories and painting skills.

361
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,530
Have you decided which edition to buy?

362
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,960
I’m not her fan.

363
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,280
Can’t I watch it for fun?

364
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,000
You cannot enter the venue
without buying a book,

365
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,450
this is the rule here.

366
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,410
Business trick.

367
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,290
This book is great.

368
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,850
Great?

369
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,210
I will take one.

370
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,450
This one.

371
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,490
You, you...

372
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,850
Come on in.

373
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,490
Be careful.

374
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,170
No one is here. Take it off.

375
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,880
You said the fever is gone.

376
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,450
Can you stop pretending…

377
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,930
It’s not fever.

378
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,010
Not fever?

379
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,680
Then what?

380
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,450
I’m sleepy.

381
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,210
Sleepy?

382
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,690
I must have taken the wrong medicine.

383
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,290
Sleeping pills?

384
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,320
I used to put sleeping pills
in a fixed position.

385
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,320
But I don’t know why,

386
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,010
I put it together
with the fever reduction.

387
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,130
I guess

388
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,090
I mistook it.

389
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,890
Prof. Ji, be careful.

390
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,730
The worse thing is,

391
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,450
I took it again half an hour ago.

392
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,280
Now my blood concentration

393
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,530
has reached the peak.

394
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:11,450
I’ll fall asleep

395
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,600
in any minute.

396
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,050
What can we do to remedy…

397
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,250
To relieve the effect?

398
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,520
Keep low, the goddess arrives!

No applause, just scream!

Keep low, the goddess arrives!

We’ll always support you!

Hurry.

Go, go, go!

410
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,290
I’ll do it.

411
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,120
Hurry.

412
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,070
Hurry up!

413
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,200
My Goddess. Sign me this.

414
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:08,730
Hello.

415
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:09,500
I’ve been waiting for a long time.

416
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,570
-Thanks.
-I like you so much.

417
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,370
Sign me one.

418
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,040
Can’t wait?

419
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,240
No, I…

420
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,210
I see. A special benefit for you.

421
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,530
How many hearts do you want?

422
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,040
Five.

423
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,680
Three.

424
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,680
I want three too.

425
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,520
Three.

426
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,810
Four.

427
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:31,880
My Goddess!

428
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,550
Please keep supporting me.

429
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,000
No. I…

430
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,720
I’m not…

431
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,540
That’s not enough?

432
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,410
Don’t miss me too much
before seeing me again.

433
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,730
Okay. Leave after signing.

434
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,240
My Goddess.

435
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,290
Sign for me!

436
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,810
My Goddess.

437
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,210
Slow down, Prof. Ji.

438
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,520
Find a cool and breathable

439
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,290
place to lie me down.

440
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,410
Lie down for a while.

441
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,210
Lie down.

442
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,690
Then what?

443
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,810
Talk to me.

444
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,570
What I took is short-acting
sleeping pill.

445
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,970
It got a short half-life.

446
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,400
Two to three hours.

447
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,450
It can be metabolized.

448
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,850
Before that,

449
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,890
no matter what you do,

450
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,530
don’t let me fall asleep.

451
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,810
Actually it doesn’t matter
if you fall asleep.

452
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,850
No, it’s shameful.

453
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,130
Okay, what do you want to hear?

454
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,650
Something that can stimulate my nerves.
Not boring.

455
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,130
Nerve-stimulating.

456
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,890
I cheated.

457
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,490
Prof. Ji,
I fell in love with someone else.

458
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,450
I don’t believe it. Get me another one.

459
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,200
Why?

460
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,130
I can’t have my feet on two boats?

461
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,040
Only when you are in a boat.

462
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:54,970
At least,

463
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,250
you’re not in my boat.

464
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,330
Then I will unfriend you.

465
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,490
Quadratic? Or which salted fish?

466
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,560
Because you are unique to me.

467
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,400
Different from anyone else.

468
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,530
Even the roles in comics.

469
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,400
Rather than the role in game,

470
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,680
I like the real you more.

471
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,550
Only you.

472
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,450
Others are all losers in my eyes.

473
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,320
You forget what you said.

474
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,210
Seems your confession is not sincere.

475
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,840
You asked me to say

476
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,250
something exciting.

477
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,280
As long as it is the truth,

478
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,450
it’s okay if it’s not exciting.

479
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,820
Tell me about yourself.

480
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,210
Me?

481
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,970
The real me is pretty boring.

482
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,530
I guess you want to sleep
right after hearing it.

483
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,410
Doesn’t matter.

484
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:46,750
All right then.

485
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:51,720
My name is Qi Nian, 24 years old.

486
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,530
Taurus, blood type O.

487
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,330
The only child in my family.

488
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,090
My mother is a housewife,

489
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,050
and my father deals with wood
all day long.

490
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,770
When I was young,
I was not good at study.

491
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,840
My adolescence was like
being anesthetized,

492
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,210
so it was not painful at all.

493
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,490
I’m listening. Keep saying.

494
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,570
My hobby is drawing comics.

495
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,770
But my major in university
is ancient Chinese.

496
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,970
Now I’m studying

497
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,730
Ji Yanxin and girl manga.

498
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,760
(Upright Lu Qingwu)

499
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,600
What is

500
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,130
girl manga for you?

501
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,840
For me,

502
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,470
girl manga is a guide to life.

503
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:38,410
Can you be more specific?

504
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,370
At first, I was attracted
by the style of painting.

505
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,160
Compared with the boy manga,

506
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,560
the girl manga paid more attention to

507
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,050
the gorgeous and exquisite picture.

508
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,600
Many girls like

509
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,720
beautiful things, do they?

510
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,640
So they subconsciously imitate

511
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,920
the clothes and hairstyle in it,

512
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,130
and gradually have their own style.

513
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,410
That should be considered
a fashion enlightenment?

514
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,000
Yes, but more attention
should be paid to

515
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,370
the direction of life than appearance.

516
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,800
The heroine in the girl manga

517
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,280
is described as a princess,

518
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,170
no matter what her origin is.

519
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,090
Some people call this Mary-sues.

520
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,320
But I take it

521
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,170
as an ideal.

522
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,680
What’s wrong with them

523
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,850
wanting to live like a comic heroine?

524
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,010
Want to be a knight?

525
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,770
Why not be a prince?

526
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,320
The knight’s job is only
to protect the princess.

527
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,530
Prince is too busy.

528
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,170
Can’t the knight protect the prince?

529
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,050
You’re right.

530
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,120
If the prince is like you,

531
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,250
then I will protect him,
with the princess.

532
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,450
You do have a complex for princess.

533
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,570
(My Dream)
But, just writing is okay.

534
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,170
(I want to be a cartoonist.)
Don’t submit it to the teacher.

535
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,770
Why?

536
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:48,640
If someone knows

537
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,250
you take girl manga as your ideal,

538
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,770
boys in school will laugh at you.

539
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,730
I don’t care. None of their business.

540
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,970
So far,

541
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,770
you finally said something nice to hear.

542
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,960
What are your most

543
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,160
satisfied work and your

544
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,250
most regrettable work?

545
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,320
What fans like is what I am
satisfied with.

546
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,760
When you don’t like me anymore,

547
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:20,170
then my works will all be regrettable.

548
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,840
No, never! We’re always your fans.

549
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,370
Miss Lu, we love you!

550
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,920
Miss Lu, we love you!

551
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,960
Thank you!

552
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,170
Thank you, please sit down.

553
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,440
Insincere.

554
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,730
Hypocritical.

555
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,570
But effective in attracting attention.

556
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,450
She’s definitely a cash cow.

557
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,090
Actually, speaking of regrets,

558
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,410
I do have something to regret.

559
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,890
This is my debut work,

560
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:48,690
Thither Cloud.

561
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,000
But Thither Cloud

562
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,530
is your representative work, isn’t it?

563
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,760
Yes, because of it,

564
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,850
I won many prizes when I debuted,

565
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,850
and it made me famous.

566
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,170
Then why?

567
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,210
Because it’s not really
what I want to paint.

568
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,200
Not what she wanted to paint?

569
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,770
I was still a newcomer at that time.

570
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,400
I participated
in the new work competition

571
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,650
under the arrangement of the company.

572
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,290
In order to get the price,

573
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,890
they studied the preferences
of the judges

574
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,680
and tailored a series

575
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,890
of stories for me.

576
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,850
So even if it succeeded,

577
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,790
it is just an excellent

578
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,330
propositional composition.

579
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,170
It can’t really be regarded
as my representative work.

580
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,370
That’s why

581
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,290
I only used Qiyue Qingwu
as my pseudonym for once.

582
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,320
What does the name

583
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,010
mean to you?

584
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,440
It’s a perfect start

585
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,570
and a past that I must leap over.

586
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,200
Nice answer.

587
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,090
Good.

588
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,320
Liar!

589
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:56,780
Great!

590
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,350
Yeah.

591
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:03,690
Prof. Ji.

592
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,070
Are you asleep?

593
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,590
If you don’t answer me,

594
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:12,440
I’ll kiss you.

595
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,310
Really?

596
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,910
It’s been half an hour,

597
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,150
the drug effect should work.

598
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,840
You will be fine after sleeping
for a while.

599
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,050
Why did you have to pretend?

600
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,440
I’ve been wasting my time
talking to you.

601
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,010
My lips got dry now.

602
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,270
Since you are asleep,

603
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,630
I will tell you another secret.

604
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:48,430
Actually, I’m a comics painter.

605
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:52,230
My pseudonym is Baby Seven,

606
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,350
and my previous pseudonym

607
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,270
was Qiyue Qingwu.

608
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,740
Will you abandon the name

609
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,910
Qiyue Qingwu?

610
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,100
I won’t say abandon.

611
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,950
I’m returning it
to its original position.

612
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,420
Maybe many fans

613
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,900
still have filters

614
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:14,610
for my past work.

615
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,710
They think the past is classic,

616
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:19,820
but in fact, it may not be much better

617
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:22,070
than the later works when
compare them in present times.

618
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:25,490
What happened?

619
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,500
Okay, because our time is limited.

620
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,420
Next, we will move on to

621
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,860
what we’re all looking forward to,

622
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,670
the free time for fans to ask questions.

623
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,980
Which fan wants to ask a question first?

624
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:40,780
Please raise your hand.

625
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,550
Me…Me…

626
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:43,940
Our book fans

627
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,540
are so very enthusiastic.

628
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,940
Okay, the one raising

629
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,150
Flower & Romance in the air.

630
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,630
Please.

631
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,870
Miss Lu, I want to ask you a question.

632
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,660
Is Thither Cloud

633
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,030
really your work?

634
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,180
What are you saying?

635
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,980
Yeah.

636
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:07,940
You’re spreading rumors.

637
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,340
What are you saying?

638
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,460
Are you out of your mind?

639
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,310
Yeah.

640
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,550
Okay, okay. His face didn’t get hurt.

641
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,190
You scared me to death.

642
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,230
My cell phone.

643
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,420
Hello, Xin.

644
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,580
Did you see the trending search?

645
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,340
Why?

646
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,820
I have no data flow now.

647
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:58,300
I will buy you some.

648
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,020
You must open up Weibo and see

649
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,580
what is called retribution.

650
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:02,310
What?

651
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:03,050
Hello?

652
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,620
(Loading)

653
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:11,030
Miss Lu,

654
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,630
I want to ask you a question.

655
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,750
Is Thither Cloud really your work?

656
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,660
What is he saying?

657
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,260
Yeah, what is he saying?

658
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:18,990
Of course, it is.

659
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,790
Why do you ask?

660
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,910
Because this comic is not over.

661
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,630
When do you plan to pick up this story?

662
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:29,540
I remember this was clearly stated

663
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,910
in the release statement.

664
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,010
Yes, you said it was
because of your body condition.

665
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,610
But after this,

666
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,230
you also painted many other works,
did you?

667
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,660
Why is this alone set aside?

668
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,130
Is it because of physical reasons

669
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,640
or is your talent gone?

670
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,490
Or,

671
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,560
it’s not your work at all,

672
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,130
so you don’t care if it ends or not.

673
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,640
How can he say that?

674
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,370
Is there any evidence for that?

675
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,650
Who is this guy?

676
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,290
Handsome,
you have to speak with evidence.

677
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,530
Evidence?

678
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,120
You just said Thither Cloud

679
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,730
does not represent
your highest standard.

680
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,240
But after that,

681
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,290
none of your works have a rating
higher than it.

682
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,440
Are you waiting

683
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,770
for your big tricks?

684
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,360
As I said,

685
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,640
most of my later works are girl manga,

686
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,370
it’s not comparable at all.

687
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,000
Is it not comparable

688
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,120
or is it because you want to

689
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,570
transform subconsciously?

690
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,240
From painting style to story,

691
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,170
you’re drawing a clear line
with Thither Cloud,

692
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,240
are you so scared

693
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,810
to compare with your debut work?

694
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:28,680
Host,

695
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,480
I think this session can be over.

696
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,000
Going on is a waste of time.

697
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,080
Why don’t you answer my question?

698
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,010
Are you guilty?

699
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,480
I knew you weren’t

700
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,890
the real Qiyue Qingwu.

701
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,970
She is not as low as you.

702
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,960
Drawing a line after tasting
the sweetness of being famous.

703
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,840
Look at the rubbish

704
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,850
you are drawing now.

705
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,600
The only thing you are better than her

706
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,730
is the ability to put this garbage
on the shelf.

707
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,160
You think I don’t know

708
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,150
your works are all

709
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,290
drawn by the gunman.

710
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,400
Even the gunman painted better than you.

711
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,800
You notorious liar!

712
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,090
The world must know your tricks!

713
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,240
Stop!

714
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,210
-Stop!
-Stop!

715
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,240
It’s okay, let’s continue.

716
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,160
Okay.

717
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,250
Let’s move on to the next part.

718
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,180
(Loading)

719
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,360
What exactly does Xin want me to see?

720
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,450
So long for loading.

721
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:22,120
Hello.

722
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:22,890
Siqi.

723
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,530
Are you free now?

724
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,570
Kind of.

725
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,600
I’m stuck

726
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,240
in the carnival stairwell,

727
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:29,970
come save me!

728
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,440
I’m also in the carnival mall.

729
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,730
I’m on the third floor of Building D.

730
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,610
Stay there and wait for me. I…

731
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,150
Hello?

732
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,410
Hello?

733
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,690
What did she say?

734
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,250
Building D. Where is Building D?

735
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,280
Found him. Here.

736
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,610
Catch him! Go.

737
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,240
Prof. Ji,

738
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,800
I have something to deal with right now.

739
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,320
You keep sleeping and wait for me,

740
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:01,960
OK?

741
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,890
Keep sleeping. Don’t catch a cold.

742
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:15,100
(Courtyard renovation. No Entry.)

743
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,900
(Courtyard renovation. No Entry.)

744
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,680
Singular. Dual. Singular. Dual.

745
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,880
Slow down,
don’t climb the stairs like that.

746
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,680
Watch your steps. Be careful.

747
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,320
But if I don’t hurry,

748
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,930
I will lose you.

749
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,010
Singular. Dual. Singular. Dual.

750
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,170
Damn! It’s singular.

751
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,400
What’s bad about singular?

752
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,520
You like singular.

753
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,920
You’re always alone. I don’t like it.

754
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,880
No.

755
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,810
I must make a dual number this time.

756
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,690
Singular. Dual. Singular. Dual…

757
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:23,450
Singular. Dual. Singular. Dual…

758
