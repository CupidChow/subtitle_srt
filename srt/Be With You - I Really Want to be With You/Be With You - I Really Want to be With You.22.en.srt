20
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,750
Are you bored?

21
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,030
You can’t endure more?

22
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,440
There are a lot. What about those?

23
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,920
I can. I can.

24
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,080
These are fabulous.

25
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,360
I can use them as background images.

26
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:08,950
How nice.

27
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,760
I have 2 TB of pictures.

28
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,630
Let’s go over them.

29
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,150
You clearly have little interest.

30
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,870
But...

31
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,990
Why didn’t you just tell me

32
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,790
you don’t like the pictures

33
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,390
or you think I’m too detached?

34
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,480
Are you still

35
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,790
uncomfortable to say no to my face?

36
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,070
Can I?

37
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,480
Maybe my life is too boring

38
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,230
and rigid,

39
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,350
but I would never joke about love.

40
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,710
If anything makes you uncomfortable,

41
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,910
tell me, and I’ll change.

42
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,950
I’ll spend my life with you,

43
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,590
not just a few months, or years.

44
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,310
Understood?

45
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,230
Can I ask you to stay with me?

46
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:13,710
Sure.

47
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,110
I want you to put the drafts aside

48
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,440
for me tonight.

49
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,070
OK.

50
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,760
I want you to put on the hairpins

51
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,680
for lovers I bought,

52
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,360
take a selfie
and post it on Hotpot Video.

53
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:29,990
OK.

54
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,350
I want to do the Thomas Hug

55
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,830
which is popular on Bilibili.

56
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,070
OK. OK.

57
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,710
Prof. Ji, hold me.

58
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,600
Ouch! It hurts!

59
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,640
Ouch! Easy!

60
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,120
You deserve it for your recklessness.

61
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,080
Hang on.

62
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,680
I’m sorry. I’m sorry. My fault.

63
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,470
I’m sorry. My fault.

64
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:08,870
Prof. Ji,

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,520
you’re not annoyed
by my impertinence.

66
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,760
Do you really like me?

67
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,670
What do you think?

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,120
If you could be honest
with your feelings,

69
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,600
we would have been together

70
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,230
in college.

71
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,470
Wasn’t I honest with it?

72
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,400
You need to tell me more

73
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,750
about your past.
The more, the better.

74
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,720
But before I met you, there seems

75
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,590
to have nothing in my life to boast.

76
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,800
What about Qi Bao?

77
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,520
How did you make it such a great boy?

78
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,030
You should ask his ex-owner.

79
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,920
When my driver found him,

80
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,120
I never expected
I’d have him for so long.

81
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,400
Didn’t his ex-owner

82
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,390
try to find him?

83
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,430
If he had tried, he would’ve found him.

84
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,270
But Qi Bao is now a family.

85
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,830
I won’t give him away.

86
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,310
But if it’s you,

87
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,710
I’ll have nothing to worry.

88
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,560
I’m gonna be busy next month.

89
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,670
Can you take care of him for me?

90
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:13,820
Sure.

91
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,390
I’m delighted to be alone with Qi Bao.

92
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,160
To be with my two families.

93
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,760
As his daddy, you can go to work.

94
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,670
Leave the baby to me.

95
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,150
Will you cheat on me
when I’m not around?

96
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,950
Siqi.

97
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,870
Sorry,
the subscriber you dialed is busy now.

98
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,870
Please try again later.

99
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,750
Sorry,
the subscriber you dialed is busy now.

100
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,430
Miss Ji.

101
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,030
Please try again later.

102
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,710
Miss Ji?

103
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,710
Miss Ji.

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I’m sorry. Are you calling me?

105
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,440
Of course.

106
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,910
Here is a letter from Mr. Shao to you.

107
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,950
I’m on a trip. Don’t try to find me.

108
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,350
Did he... book the flight back home?

109
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,750
No.

110
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,190
Shao Zui,

111
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,310
where are you?

112
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,030
Miss Lu?

113
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,960
What is that look? I’m not a ghost.

114
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,920
Can’t I come?

115
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,640
No, no.

116
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,840
Mr. Xiao said you’re on leave

117
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,440
and couldn’t come to the studio.

118
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,400
Nonsense!

119
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,190
This is my studio.
I can come at any time.

120
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,030
Oh, post a notice on my Weibo.

121
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,750
About what?

122
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,990
New chapter of Thither Cloud
to be updated.

123
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,390
The mysterious author of Qiyue Qingwu.

124
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,640
Why do you stop? Type.

125
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,000
Miss Lu, you can form CP with anyone,

126
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,280
but not post like this.

127
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,160
Mock at yourself,

128
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,680
but don’t joke with your reputation.

129
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,840
Cut it out.

130
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,430
Are you gonna do as I ask or not?

131
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,510
I’ll post it myself.

132
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,440
When did you become so close?

133
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,440
It’s a secret.

134
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,270
Come with me.

135
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,510
What are you doing here?

136
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,230
Qi Nian doesn’t want you?

137
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,030
Say her name again?

138
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,190
Come. Let’s see the sea.

139
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,310
Sea?

140
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,550
It’s the sea. Am I right?

141
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,350
I thought you’d forget.

142
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,430
Why would you think so?

143
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,710
I thought you wouldn’t come back

144
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,030
after you found out the truth.

145
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,990
I was going to.

146
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,710
I was flared up

147
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,030
and meant to break up.

148
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,590
But when I cooled down,

149
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,950
I found I was in your office.

150
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,390
I think I’m like a stalker.

151
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,830
More pathetically,

152
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,110
even after we broke up,

153
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,920
I still chose to work overtime

154
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,190
to draw the page for you.

155
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,030
And I finished it. Why?

156
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,830
You ask me?

157
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,390
It’s your fault. You’re responsible.

158
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,190
Sir, be reasonable.

159
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,830
You don’t like me.
Who should I be responsible for?

160
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,190
I see.

161
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,040
Are you asking for the pay

162
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,670
for the drawings?

163
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,720
Name a price and I’ll make a transfer.

164
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,550
I need your phone.

165
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,070
Got it?

166
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,990
So it’s a break-up kiss...

167
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,270
Is that all you have in mind?

168
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,350
Am I wrong?

169
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,750
Terribly.

170
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,630
Why can’t you...

171
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,990
interpret it as I like you or miss you?

172
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,830
Say something.

173
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,470
You’re talking to the wrong girl.

174
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,350
Did Qi Nian dump you again?

175
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,270
I don’t care if she dumps me.

176
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,470
The girl I like is you.

177
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,280
Are you kidding?

178
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,640
I’m notorious, remember?

179
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,240
Are you a scapegoat?

180
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,720
You like to take blames?

181
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,750
It wasn’t you.

182
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,270
How do you know?

183
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,270
When I found it, it was still recording.

184
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,240
Does that mean...?

185
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,720
It recorded your conversation

186
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,830
with Xiao Li.

187
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,870
Did you set Qi Nian up?

188
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,920
She didn’t sign off with us

189
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,280
or apply for the reward,

190
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,790
or pay people to defame me.

191
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,270
Are you worried?

192
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,990
Qi Nian isn’t a fragile girl.

193
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,990
I’m not talking about Qi Nian.

194
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,990
If it’s brought to court,

195
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,870
it’s impossible for Lu Qingwu
to get away.

196
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,030
If it happens,

197
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:34,990
who will you side with?

198
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:37,950
I don’t know.

199
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,670
Now that Qi Nian has the recorder,

200
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,950
I’ll respect her decision.

201
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,030
Siqi.

202
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,790
Here.

203
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,990
Qi Nian asks me to give it back to you.

204
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,150
So,

205
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,230
she can’t forgive me.

206
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,390
Why don’t you listen to it?

207
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,990
From the third minute
of the second audio.

208
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,790
Lu Qingwu, it’s me.

209
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,520
I’m not ready

210
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,510
to sit and talk to you.

211
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,150
So I can only tell you in this way.

212
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,070
I’ve heard the explanation you owe me.

213
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,240
In fact, I’m not a generous person.

214
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,310
Though it’s been years,

215
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,150
I still can’t forgive

216
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,830
for what Xiao Li did to me.

217
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,270
But I know

218
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,830
if the secret is disclosed,

219
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,110
you’ll be the first sacrifice.

220
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,950
And I can tell

221
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,150
Siqi cares about you.

222
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,470
I don’t want to make it hard for him,

223
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,150
or for anybody else either.

224
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,310
So I choose to let go of it.

225
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,960
It doesn’t mean I’ve forgiven you.

226
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,160
I just don’t want to rack myself

227
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,710
to find whose fault it is.

228
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,870
So I won’t bring it up again,

229
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,350
like it never happened.

230
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,390
It all stopped on the day in Grade 8

231
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,670
when you came to my classroom.

232
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,230
Let’s make ourselves famous together.

233
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,150
I’m Lu Qingwu.

234
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,190
Qi Nian.

235
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,550
Let’s start over again.

236
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,230
Alright.

237
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,070
She’s let it go.

238
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,510
Forgive yourself.

239
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,270
Are you sure you wanna move on?

240
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,760
Yeah, I don’t know others’ opinions.

241
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,790
But I have moved on.

242
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,390
Don’t you hate her?

243
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,320
In my philosophy,

244
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,350
ignorance is no excuse.

245
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,680
She’s your brother’s girlfriend.

246
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,120
You’re her future sister-in-law.

247
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:50,880
Prof. Ji,

248
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,400
you’re so biased.

249
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,710
Yeah, I’m protective.

250
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,310
Don’t worry.

251
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,440
Your brother has a good eye for girls.

252
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,480
Thanks to him,

253
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,070
I can have peace in mind.

254
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,190
You don’t believe me?

255
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,840
No.

256
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,230
Then come and find out.

257
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,600
I’m not asking you to drop your work.

258
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,440
Ignore me.

259
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,790
Follow your plan.

260
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,390
Are you sure?

261
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,640
Yes. I’d rather you show

262
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,750
a little care to Ji Qiu.

263
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,910
What about her?

264
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,120
You should ask the performance artist,
Mr. Shao,

265
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,400
why he disappeared

266
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,640
and gave her his company.

267
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,760
Is he dying

268
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,600
or does he have Alzheimer’s?

269
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,000
Why putting on this miserable show?

270
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,240
Even though he promoted me,

271
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:41,920
I demanded him to come back

272
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,230
and give Ji Qiu an explanation.

273
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,520
That’s the new assistant to the CEO,

274
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,910
Zhou Xinxin’s criticism.

275
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,070
Is it too much?

276
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,550
Is it?

277
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,150
I think it could be meaner.

278
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,110
After all, he took flight.

279
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,430
Don’t worry.
There’ll be a consequence.

280
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,150
We’re friends for years.

281
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,550
How could you curse me?

282
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,800
We’re friends for years.

283
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,230
How could you leave my cousin?

284
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,640
The trip you mentioned is

285
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,790
to work in a bar 2 km from my home?

286
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,990
Your body rests with
where your heart is.

287
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,310
Meaning?

288
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,440
To me,

289
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,470
it’s a trip when I’m away from her.

290
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,110
Still can’t get it.

291
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,550
So, when will you come back?

292
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,950
It’s not my plan.

293
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,220
(Yangcheng Lake)

294
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:52,180
Sorry,
the subscriber you dialed is busy now.

295
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,190
Do I have to die

296
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,070
before you pick up?

297
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,190
Miss Ji.

298
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,230
Don’t call me that.

299
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,950
It’s a big house.

300
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,510
That’s all he has at home?

301
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,280
Mr. Shao sold his real estates

302
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,750
in the city a year ago.

303
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,720
He also has paid off

304
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,390
the rent of his house last week.

305
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,070
These are found in the locker
in his office.

306
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,870
Please check them.

307
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,160
Miss Ji, if that’s all,

308
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,150
I’ll give you a minute.

309
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:38,060
(Blue House Home to the sky and stars)

310
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,540
(By Ji Qiu Dear Miss...)

311
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,960
I’m sorry, Miss. Sorry.

312
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,520
I spoiled her.

313
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,680
Sorry for the trouble.

314
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,320
I’ll make sure

315
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,320
she learns the lesson.

316
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:58,760
OK.

317
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,030
I’m sorry, Miss. Sorry.

318
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,600
Petite.

319
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,630
Don’t call me.

320
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,960
You wanna argue

321
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,070
for fighting with others?

322
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,030
You didn’t have to act
as my custodian.

323
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,390
You’re no custodian to me.

324
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,590
OK, I’m not.

325
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,950
Well,

326
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,280
I’ll tell your cousin then.

327
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,350
Wait.

328
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,870
Or your grandpa?

329
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,310
Write down your review

330
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,790
and send a picture to your teacher.

331
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,150
Alright.

332
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,430
What’s wrong?

333
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:00,720
Why are you crying?

334
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,550
Not your business.

335
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,400
With my parents away,

336
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,270
everybody can bully me.

337
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,710
It’s just a review. No big deal.

338
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,000
I was insulted first.

339
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,790
Why should I apologize?

340
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,510
OK.

341
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,880
If it happens again,

342
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,950
just ignore those abuses, OK?

343
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:30,030
Or you can let me know.

344
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,070
Why bother?

345
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,550
You’ll leave one day.

346
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,070
That’d be in a long time.

347
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,080
I won’t leave

348
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,150
before you grow up.

349
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,310
Really?

350
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,270
Swear to my dad’s photo.

351
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,480
OK.

352
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,800
Hi, uncle, nice to meet you.

353
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,230
I’m Ji Qiu’s hatchet man,

354
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,390
who’ll protect her safety.

355
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,360
Please pray for her

356
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,590
so she can grow up in peace.

357
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,870
And no puberty love.

358
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,030
Take the last one back.

359
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,980
(Shot in 2009
before the climb with the captain)

360
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,030
In 2009,

361
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,190
Shao Zui came to my home.

362
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,520
Hi, uncle, nice to meet you.

363
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,030
I’m Ji Qiu’s hatchet man,

364
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,780
(Shot in 2009
before the climb with the captain)

365
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,230
What’s that?

366
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,480
Are you sure

367
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,790
you won’t tell Ji Qiu the truth?

368
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:14,910
Tell her what?

369
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,440
The purpose I came to your family

370
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,630
is only to fulfill her dad’s last wish?

371
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,600
Or should I tell her

372
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,230
the fact of his dad’s death?

373
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,190
It was an accident.

374
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,800
You still can’t move on, can you?

375
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,950
Forget it. I’m now away from her.

376
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,120
Don’t worry.

377
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,910
Girls of her age forget fast.

378
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,470
Watch some dramas and she’ll move on.

379
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,900
The problem is you.

380
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,990
You’re in the mood to worry about me?

381
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,150
What are you trying to say?

382
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,680
You must be busy lately.

383
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,080
How does it feel
to leave your girlfriend

384
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:57,750
for so long?

385
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:58,910
Astringent.

386
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,420
See?

387
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,120
I mean the drink.

388
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,230
Stop pretending.

389
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,630
Let me give you a reminder.

390
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,960
Qi Nian is popular

391
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,960
and cute.

392
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,110
She must have many suitors

393
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,310
and could be taken away from you.

394
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,030
The cast is decided so soon.

395
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,200
My lady, don’t you check your Weibo?

396
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,150
It’s announced.

397
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,600
I haven’t checked it.

398
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,390
Who will play Mr. J?

399
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,400
Prepare yourself for the big news.
It’s Su...

400
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,030
Qi Bao.

401
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,500
(Dress for the Beauty)

402
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,310
Are you Baby Seven?

403
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,150
Nice to meet you. I’m Su Xuran.

404
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,630
You don’t know me?

405
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,910
Let me introduce myself.

406
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,960
I’m the actor who’s going to play Mr. J,

407
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,670
Su Xuran

408
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,030
and also Qi Bao’s ex-owner.

409
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,670
It’s a pleasure.

410
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,710
Pleasure.

411
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,320
There are plenty of men

412
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,150
who are more interesting,

413
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,400
younger, cuter

414
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,230
and smarter than you.

415
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,600
Keep an eye on your fuzzy ball,

416
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,310
or I bet she’ll be taken away.

417
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,350
You sure

418
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,190
you’re not gonna get a license?

419
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,990
Sorry. I scared you.

420
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,150
Shut up.

421
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,750
Qi Bao, do you miss me?

422
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,310
You’re so fat.

423
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,990
He’s the ex-owner. Crap.

424
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,150
They seem close.

425
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,630
Qi Bao must miss him very much.

426
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,240
Didn’t his previous owner

427
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,310
try to find him?

428
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,350
If he tried, he would find him.

429
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,150
But Qi Bao is now a family.

430
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,670
I won’t give him away.

431
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,270
Right, how could I give in?

432
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,800
When Prof. Ji is away,

433
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,510
I’m responsible to protect Qi Bao.

434
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,110
Baby Seven.

435
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,070
You seem distracted.

436
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,950
Did I disturb you?

437
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,920
No, not at all.

438
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,600
It’s my honor to talk to a star

439
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,510
like you.

440
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,230
I’m flattered.

441
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,070
In fact, I have a habit.

442
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,710
When I get a new role,

443
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,880
I tend to find similarities

444
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,630
with the role.

445
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,190
Sometimes, I can manage.

446
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,350
Others, I need assistance,

447
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,200
especially from original authors

448
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,310
(Boyfriend)
like you.

449
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,150
I have a question to ask.

450
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,110
Do you think

451
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,390
Mr. Ji and I are similar?

452
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,340
(Dress for the Beauty)

453
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:40,670
Yeah.

454
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,990
Do you like me

455
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,670
to play Mr. J?

456
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,160
As the author,

457
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,760
I think if you can bring out the role,

458
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,480
everybody will like you.

459
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,400
And actors have their views
on the roles.

460
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,120
So just bring out the spirit.

461
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,190
There’s no need to be 100% alike.

462
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,630
I can’t.

463
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,590
Since I decide to take the role,

464
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,710
I should try my best to portray him.

465
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:05,710
Right.

466
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,440
Talk to me about the role

467
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,430
when it’s convenient, please.

468
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,910
I don’t think it’s gonna be convenient.

469
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,790
Then I’ll visit Qi Bao.

470
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,030
As his ex-owner,

471
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,110
I have a lot to catch up with him.

472
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,990
You’d better come to see me.

473
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,230
OK.

474
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,310
See you, Xiaoqi.

475
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,070
I’m on my way to the airport.

476
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,990
Book a flight to Quancheng for me.

477
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,270
What’s going on? Where is everybody?

478
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,750
Laid off.
Drawers are assigned to other units.

479
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:15,870
Why?

480
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,280
Miss Lu decides
to continue Thither Cloud.

481
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,760
The profitable IP and adaptations

482
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,760
are called off.

483
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,670
Why would we keep the studio?

484
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,830
Would Xiao Li agree?

485
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,470
Of course not.

486
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,000
Before you came,

487
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,760
the two kicked up a row in the office.

488
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,990
Loud enough for all to hear.

489
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,600
If it continues,

490
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,430
they’ll fall out soon.

491
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,710
Yes, Mr. Xiao.

492
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:43,750
What is it?

493
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,790
Mr. Xiao wants you in his office.

494
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,550
Right on time.

495
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,270
Calm down.

496
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,310
It’d do Miss Lu no good

497
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,030
if you piss him off.

498
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,360
I know.

499
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,790
Easy. I’ll take care of him.

500
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,580
You ask for me, Mr. Xiao?

501
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:10,260
(Rongpin Animation Culture Co., Ltd.)

502
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,600
These are adaptations called off

503
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,830
by Lu Qingwu.

504
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,120
Many are

505
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,590
S+ projects.

506
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,230
Do you know how profitable they are?

507
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,990
They’ve been called off as you said,

508
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,590
is it necessary for me to read it?

509
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,750
Is this how you talk to your boss?

510
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,350
It seems Lu Qingwu likes your attitude.

511
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,200
Either she likes or not,

512
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,590
it’s between me and her,

513
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,310
not your place to ask.

514
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,510
Anything else?

515
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,230
Or I should go back to work.

516
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,190
Don’t you care what will happen to her?

517
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,640
Take it out on me.

518
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,230
What kind of man would target a woman?

519
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,550
Alright. It’s your words.

520
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,390
What do you want?

521
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,240
Lu Qingwu calls the projects off.

522
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:04,990
You take over.

523
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,070
(Storyline)
I know

524
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,270
(The heroine’s characters)
it’s beyond your capacity.

525
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,070
But it’s not my problem.

526
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,960
Give me what I ask,

527
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,910
and I’ll forgive her.

528
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,870
Otherwise, Lu Qingwu’s dirty secrets

529
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:24,790
will go out.

530
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,510
OK, deal.

531
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,320
But you have to keep it from Lu Qingwu.

532
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,110
Deal.

533
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,590
Qi Bao.

534
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:57,140
(Boyfriend)

535
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,350
Did I make a call at 4 P.M.?

536
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,750
I have a question to ask.

537
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,310
Is it a coincidence?

538
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,060
(Boyfriend)

539
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:17,940
Hello?

540
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,270
I pressed the wrong button.

541
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,200
So the call is based on a mistake.

542
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,120
No, no, no.

543
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,400
I was going to call you,

544
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,390
especially today.

545
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,470
What’s wrong?

546
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,990
Prof. Ji, do you trust me?

547
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,310
Of course.

548
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,040
Sir,

549
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,790
the plane is taking off soon.

550
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,030
You’re on the plane?

551
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,830
Yeah.

552
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,430
So you have five seconds.

553
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,710
What do you want to say?

554
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,030
Prof. Ji, I...

555
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,240
It’s directed by Liu Hua

556
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,430
and co-starred by Su Xuran and Zhang Ya.

557
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,400
The story is based on Baby Seven’s comic

558
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,760
in which a single cartoonist

559
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,240
breaks the bottle neck

560
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,710
by drawing comics.

561
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:39,100
(Borscht Soup)

562
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,680
Qi Bao.

563
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,800
What do you think your dad is doing?

564
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,790
Has he forgotten me?

565
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,160
Call him? No.

566
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,520
Dad works hard.

567
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,070
How could I disturb him?

568
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,870
Text him? OK.

569
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,520
But how should I make it
clear and simple

570
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,230
without being gross?

571
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,350
If he keeps ignoring me, I’ll be mad.

572
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,590
Qi Bao.

573
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:01,260
(Listen to your dog
Be a good pet owner)

574
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,580
(Press the button to record)

575
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,550
What the heck is that?

576
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,750
Qi Bao?

577
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:15,910
It’s me.

578
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:16,910
What?

579
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,160
Translated to dog language.

580
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,400
How is it?

581
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,760
How is what?

582
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,070
I’m not one of the dog family.

583
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,880
As a human,

584
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,280
Ji Yanxin won’t understand

585
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,670
that I call his names in dog language.

586
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:28,750
What did you say?

587
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,040
Ji Yanxin, you pighead.

588
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,870
If you don’t come back,
I’ll cheat on you.

589
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,350
That’s so adorable.

590
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,440
Look, he doesn’t get it.

591
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,720
Ji Yanxin, you deserve it.

592
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,350
I’m gonna record another.

593
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,830
Don’t play with fire.

594
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,990
He would come back and deal with you.

595
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,360
I want him to come back.

596
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,150
I should go. Bye.

597
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,750
What’s wrong with your hand?

598
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:16,640
Nothing.

599
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,790
I sprained

600
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,710
my wrist while playing basketball.

601
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,110
Lie!

602
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:22,600
I know basketball

603
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,550
isn’t your thing.

604
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,670
Isn’t this my program?

605
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,310
Who gives it to you?

606
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:31,870
Is it him?

607
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,390
It doesn’t matter.

608
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:38,790
What are you doing?

609
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,350
What are you doing?

610
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:43,580
(Employee’s Card)

611
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,550
Where are you going?

612
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,270
Don’t go to him. Don’t.

613
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,640
Ji Yanxin, give me a look.

614
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,430
You’ll lose your dog soon.

615
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,910
Are you singing scales, Xiaoqi?

616
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,000
No, I’m recording a video on Tik Tok.

617
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,230
What brings you here, Mr. Su?

618
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,080
I told you

619
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,590
I’d come to discuss the role.

620
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,720
You’re so devoted.

621
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,600
No wonder you’re the best actor,

622
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,630
a role model for the young people.

623
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,310
Even though,

624
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,470
I still need your help,

625
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,590
Xiaoqi’s story is based on you.

626
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,720
Shouldn’t you tell me

627
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,870
what in my role that attracts you?

628
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,880
It’s better for you

629
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,760
to meet the man behind this role.

630
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,870
But he’s not here.

631
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,870
Is his name Ji Yanxin?

632
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,910
It’s said he’s your boyfriend.

633
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,310
Is he that good?

634
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,670
He’s perfect.

635
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,110
What about me?

636
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,470
You’re here, Mr. Su.
I’m looking for you.

637
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,800
The meeting is about to start.
The producers are waiting.

638
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,550
Let’s go.

639
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,800
OK, I’m on my way.

640
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,750
Thanks, Miss Zhou.

641
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:01,990
Odd.

642
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,510
What’s odd?

643
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,280
I don’t think I told him my name.

644
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,710
How did he know my name?

645
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,720
Maybe he has a good memory.

646
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,160
After all, he’s the best actor.

647
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,670
Come on.

648
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,510
Hope I’m wrong.

649
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,600
On top of the weekly rank

650
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,470
of girl manga is...

651
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,990
Miss Lu, we’re in a meeting.

652
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,270
Dismissed.

653
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,310
Dismissed!

654
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,000
Go, go, go.

655
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,070
Chop. Chop. Let’s go.

656
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,310
Move.

657
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:41,670
Got it.

658
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,200
Burst in like that?

659
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,790
Seems you don’t care about your dignity.

660
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,070
Dignity is for humans,

661
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,950
not for you.
