1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:06,950


2
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,510
 Lee Joon Gi 

3
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:12,890
 Lee Kyung Young 

4
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:16,650
 Kim Ji Eun 

5
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:35,040
 Again My Life 

6
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,440
Get out of the way!

7
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:56,100
No!

8
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,170
Mom?

9
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,370
Dad?

10
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,910
  There were so many ways I could have saved my parents.  

11
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,040
  But the arrogance of believing that I could change fate led them to die anyway.  

12
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,790
  Hey, Mom.  

13
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:34,180
  Can you stay home from work today?  

14
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,250
 Why? Is something happening?  

15
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,400
 I'm taking today off too.  

16
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,750
  - Maybe together we can— 
 - Even if you take the day off we still have to go to work.  

17
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,020
  - We work 24/7. 
 - Exactly.  

18
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,760
  I should have tried insisting while holding their hands.  

19
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,100
  No.  

20
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,540
  Even if I had to cause an accident, I should have made sure that they couldn't leave for the factory.  

21
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:57,880
  I should have realized that I might become a variable to cause the driver to turn the steering wheel.  

22
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:03,470
 No, I should have pushed my parents a little closer to the sidewalk.  

23
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:28,560
  Am I to end up alone again like this?  

24
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:45,920
 Hui Wu! Hui Wu!  

25
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,150
 - Hui Wu, where are you?
 - Hui Wu? 

26
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,810
 Hui Wu! 

27
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:54,390
Mom! Dad!

28
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,700
- Are you okay? 
 - Hui Wu, are you hurt?

29
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,310
Mom, are you okay?

30
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:05,180
- Are you hurt? 
 - Are you okay?

31
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,610
Try moving. Try lifting your arms.

32
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:10,830
Why are you worrying about me? You two are hurt!

33
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:14,210
Mom, this won't do. Hurry and get on my back. Let's go to the hospital.

34
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:16,870
No, I'm okay. I was just a little shocked.

35
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:20,460
Are you sure you didn't get hit by any glass?

36
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:24,240
Dad, you're the one who got hurt, I said.

37
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,550
- You're bleeding. 
 - Bleeding?

38
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,910
Darn, I got hurt.

39
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,550
I did.

40
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,440
 Episode 2 

41
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,950
Mom, let's go to the hospital just to be safe.

42
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:45,310
I'm really okay.

43
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,370
But what happened to the driver?

44
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:50,580
I know, I think he might be badly injured.

45
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,810
Stay here. I'll go check.

46
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,470
Okay.

47
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:58,920
Are you okay?

48
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,150
I'm just a little roughed up.

49
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,220
 I'll finally get to see  

50
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,890
 the hit-and-run assailant who killed my parents.  

51
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,790
 - He died? Are you sure? 
 - Yes.  

52
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,110
- Did anything about him stand out? 
 - It looks like a DUI.

53
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,890
- Drunk driving? 
 - Yes.

54
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:16,660
He reeked of alcohol.

55
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,230
Hello, sir.

56
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:22,250
- What happened? 
 - Well... That...

57
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,980
Gosh!!

58
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,150
  Kim Jin Wu?  

59
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,160
 Why would Kim Jin Wu be here?  

60
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,780
Please move aside, we have a patient coming through!

61
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,050
  The smell of alcohol is so strong.  

62
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,880
 Is that... 

63
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,600
  Jo Hyeon Seok?  

64
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,040
  I finally have the missing piece.  

65
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,660
 Jo Hyeon Seok. Jo Tae Seop's son.  

66
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,960
  It's nice to meet you. 

67
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,800
  Mr. Kim?  

68
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,510
  I freely did a background check on you.  

69
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,810
 You lost your parents to a hit and run accident while you were young.  

70
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:18,430
 With lower-level grades, accepted to the Department of Law at Hankuk University after three exam attempts. 

71
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:22,910
  You were even a martial artist when you took the bar (exams). 

72
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:26,710
  On top of that, you're handsome too.  

73
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,570
  Very handsome.  

74
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:33,340
  You don't need to be this good looking if you're already so accomplished, but somehow you achieved that too!  

75
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:36,750
 Anyway, as a rising political star,  

76
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,880
 you're overflowing with talent. 

77
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,790
 My father,  Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop, will undoubtedly back you, too. 

78
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:46,590
 Just take one step forward.  

79
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:49,480
 The rest will follow. 

80
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,450
 What a brazen jerk.  

81
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:55,110
 He already knew who I was.  

82
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,840
 Ambulance 

83
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:05,380
 Fabricating and hiding the accident records. 

84
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:09,400
 That was due to Jo Tae Seop's power.  

85
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,440
Excuse me?

86
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,330
We'll need a witness statement. Would you mind coming to the station?

87
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:17,710
Sure.

88
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,040
Excuse me.

89
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,990
I'll do it.

90
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,760
I'm his father. I was also at the scene.

91
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,910
I'm also a victim.

92
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:29,430
Okay. Then I'll ask for your cooperation.

93
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,680
Come with me.

94
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,880
Are you going to be okay, Dad?

95
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,770
I'll be okay. Take your mom home and get some rest.

96
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,620
Yes.

97
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:53,150
  I changed fate. I protected my parents. 

98
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:56,180
 And Jo Tae Seop lost his son.  

99
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:01,580
 He'll probably be an even more cold-blooded madman than he was before.  

100
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,570
 I know 

101
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,860
 since I became that way  

102
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,220
 when I lost my parents. 

103
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:20,640
 Again My Life 

104
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:31,850
- You worked hard Seok Hun. 
 - I only did my job.

105
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:36,390
Thanks to you, I was able to protect my son's honor.

106
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:40,420
We've made sure to secure all information related to the accident.

107
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:43,110
So, please don't worry about that.

108
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,610
Okay.

109
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:50,570
I cannot fathom the depth of your grief, and for that, I apologize.

110
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,980
I'm sure it'll get better in time.

111
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:56,560
What can I do? It's not something that can be undone.

112
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,930
For everything you've done for me,

113
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:04,680
I'll be sure to repay you. You should receive good news soon.

114
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,830
Thank you, sir.

115
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,240
Only up to today...

116
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:16,090
That's right. I should think back on it and be sad only up to today

117
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:19,090
and let my son, Hyeon Seok, go.

118
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:26,160
Tomorrow, I have to go back and work for the people again.

119
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,820
- Yes, sir. 
 - Thank you for all your hard work.

120
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,610
You ate jjajangmyeon (black bean noodles) earlier. Why are you hungry again?

121
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:46,420
- Stop eating you pig! 
  - Let me have a cigarette.

122
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,410
Hey, go buy some cigarettes.

123
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,960
- Just give me one. You have some right? 
 - Hey, get me a lighter.

124
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,130
You are cool! Woohoo!!

125
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,420
- Get me some chocolate milk! 
 - And a cookie!

126
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,830
Welcome.

127
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:01,470
Cigarettes.

128
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:08,320
I heard that you were studying. Why? To go to college?

129
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:26,190
 Hey, you worm-like bastard. How dare you tell on me to the homeroom teacher? 

130
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:31,190
 But your father is a factory worker and mine is a police chief.  

131
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:36,250
 How unfair! It must feel so unfair for you!  

132
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,730
Bastard. Are your ears blocked?

133
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,710
Look at that stare.

134
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:46,400
Why? Are you going to hit me?

135
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,710
Wow, you're so damn whiny!

136
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:51,980
That's enough. Let's go.

137
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:56,820
Hui Wu. Study hard and make sure to get into college.

138
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,000
Become an important person.

139
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,570
- Who? This idiot?  
 - I said, let's go.

140
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:03,670
The others are waiting.

141
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,630
Hey. Watch that stare of yours.

142
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,950
Once a gofer, always a gofer.

143
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:11,870
Where did you graduate from that you dare to look at me that way?

144
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,340
Stay strong.

145
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:34,310
I need to hold back and keep it together.

146
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:40,250
 Kim Hui Wu. Come to the faculty office. 

147
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,770
Hey, Hui Wu, you're here!

148
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,980
Say hello. He is the director.

149
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,260
- Hello. 
 - Nice to meet you, student Kim Hui Wu.

150
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:56,080
You are the one who came first in the mock exams.

151
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,820
 Congratulations. 

152
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,970
For the first time since the academy was established, a student in the lowest grade class

153
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:06,220
overtook his peers from Hankuk University and came in first.

154
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:12,900
From today, move to the Hankuk University class.

155
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,610
Yes, sir.

156
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:19,180
- Is it you? 
 -  Kim Gyu Ri? 

157
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,820
First at the academy.

158
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,780
Ohh.. yeah.

159
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:27,420
What's your secret? I would have never believed it was possible.

160
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:31,470
- What's so funny? 
 - Nothing.

161
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,250
Anyway, congrats.

162
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:38,110
I'm sure it'll be your first and last time. No compromises next time.

163
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,910
Are you okay health-wise?

164
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:47,590
- What are you saying? 
 - Eat well.

165
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,690
Don't eat things like that.

166
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,560
Hey, cigarettes.

167
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:03,620
There's no cigarette for 1000 won.

168
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,350
- Why are you laughing? 
 - Because you are.

169
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:13,160
So it's true that you changed, just like I heard.

170
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,440
Hurry up and give it to me. I don't have time.

171
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,760
Time? More like money.

172
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,370
And, no cigarette costs 1000 won.

173
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:24,250
This bastard, gosh!!

174
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,010
- Huh? Did you just avoid me? 
 - Yeah, I did.

175
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,670
- Why should I get hit? 
 - If you avoid it, you'll get hit more.

176
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,090
Then try hitting me, you lunatic.

177
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:32,980
This punk...

178
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:38,990
Why aren't you coming out already? What are you doing?

179
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:42,790
Hey! Let's take it outside.

180
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:45,010
Deal.

181
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,900
Seriously!

182
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,460
Kim Hui Wu, why do you have to give up on life in front of me?

183
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:56,390
Why is it me of all people? Why are you trying to make me a murderer?

184
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:59,220
I won't die. Don't worry.

185
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,180
And even if you get caught and locked up,

186
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:06,340
punks like you only get about six months for a petty offense.

187
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:12,520
What is he saying? What the hell is this bastard saying?

188
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,740
What?

189
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:21,590
Gosh, this punk...

190
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,750
Let go! Let go, you punk.

191
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:31,050
W-W-Wait. Let go. I'm fine.

192
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:33,660
How dare you, punk?!

193
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:37,660
Stay back! Stay back! Hold on, hold on. Damn it.

194
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,180
Let go. I said, let go, you bastard.

195
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:43,090
Let go!

196
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,960
 Did that punk just tickle me?  

197
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,820
Hold on.

198
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,950
Are you a pervert? Why are you tickling me?

199
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:56,310
I'm begging you. Can't you just leave today?

200
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,550
Just go. Okay?

201
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:08,570
How dare this bastard bite the master without any fear?

202
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,390
 Are you out of your mind now just because you graduated from school? 

203
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:14,280
I didn't bite him. I just tickled him for a second.

204
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,300
- What is he saying? 
 - Th-That's actually true.

205
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:22,280
- What? 
 - I mean, th-this bastard—

206
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,870
You moron. Come here, you bastard.

207
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:34,050
Go kill him!

208
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:36,430
 Catch him. 

209
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:58,130
What are you doing? Why are you closing your eyes?

210
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,890
To feel it?

211
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,140
I'm going to kill you for real.

212
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,160
Let's stop now, okay?

213
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:11,090
If I keep going, you might pee your pants. No?

214
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,750
-  College?  
 - Yes.

215
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,430
What is your father's name?

216
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:22,580
Kim Chan Seong.

217
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,770
Our son is saying he wants to go to college?

218
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:29,160
Yes. I am studying hard while going to the academy.

219
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:34,920
What about the p-p-part-time job?

220
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,720
- While working. 
 - When are you sleeping?

221
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,090
You don't have to worry about my health.

222
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:42,280
So, what's your goal?

223
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,620
The Department of Law in Hankuk University.

224
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:50,960
You're scaring me now. What the hell have we done wrong?

225
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:56,530
Hui Wu, come on. Let's start over and talk seriously.

226
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,090
Okay.

227
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,580
I knew you wouldn't believe me.

228
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:06,230
- Here it is. 
 - What is this? Grade card?

229
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,140
- Did you do well? 
 - Yes.

230
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:12,900
I placed first at the academy.

231
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,690
First place? Why?

232
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:18,250
- What do you mean why? 
 - Watch it!

233
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,950
How dare you lie to us? Just because we don't know how to read the grade card.

234
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:25,500
Our son placed first? Someone from our family is first place?

235
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,160
Did you cheat?

236
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,240
It's a crime to cheat this much!

237
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:33,900
I didn't! I studied hard for this. Dad, I swear.

238
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,920
Honey, let's have a family meeting. Without him, just us.

239
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:41,430
How can someone from our family place first? How?

240
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:44,560
 Assemblyman Jo Tae Seob of the Democratic Party has announced 

241
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,320
 his candidacy for the national convention to elect the next party president. 

242
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,980
 He held a press conference today at the National Assembly's Democratic Party 

243
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,890
 and expressed his intent to run as the party's candidate for president, 

244
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:56,620
 saying he will do everything to create a new Republic of Korea. 

245
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:59,330
 In a situation where inequality and polarization are intensifying... 

246
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:02,370
 Time is flowing according to my memories. 

247
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:05,620
 All the incidents from my past are really happening. 

248
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:11,160
 The fateful time that must be stopped is also approaching. 

249
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:21,460
 Three months later. 

250
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:55,520
 What is this? Why did the lights go off? 

251
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,250
I can't see anything.

252
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,230
 What's this? 

253
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:15,270
Could it be... today?

254
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:18,620
 On that day, thunder and lightning struck, and there was a power outage, too. 

255
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,380
 Pharmacy 

256
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,980
 I am sure it's somewhere here. 

257
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,430
 The academy alley in front of the pharmacy. 

258
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,890
 Rensol Pharmacy. 

259
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,220
 Pharmacy 

260
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,070
Kim Gyu Ri!

261
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:09,980
You are up. Are you conscious?

262
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,790
Did you bring me here?

263
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,410
Yeah.

264
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:22,490
- Thanks. 
 - You need to take care of yourself.

265
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:26,170
I'm thankful, but it's not something you need to worry about.

266
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,850
If you are sleepy, just sleep.

267
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:39,020
 Instead of taking these. 

268
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:48,410
It's not that I didn't sleep. I reduced it as much as I can with this.

269
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:50,650
- What do you get by forcibly sleeping less? 
 - I study.

270
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,180
- What after studying? 
 - Get into a good college.

271
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:55,990
- What after getting into a good college? 
 - I will think about that once I get there.

272
00:19:55,990 --> 00:20:00,180
For now, it's important that I don't disappoint my parents.

273
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:03,800
Is it your goal to satisfy your parents at every step?

274
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,470
I didn't say I was doing it for them.

275
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,960
You're not?

276
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:13,030
I am grateful to them, that's all.

277
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:19,470
It's true. Parents are usually people we are grateful for.

278
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:22,520
- You can just be grateful for them, too. 
 - What do you mean?

279
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,790
For your parents, you are just their child.

280
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,900
They wouldn't think of you as adopted.

281
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:35,180
What are you? How did you know?

282
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:46,660
Because they are good people who adopted you, you feel burdened and are obsessed.

283
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:51,120
You even ruined your health. Would they want all this?

284
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,400
Don't try to pay back in the wrong way.

285
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,390
At least for your sake.

286
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:05,030
True. This is not right.

287
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:28,890
 In the past, Gyu Ri was someone who always placed first. 

288
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,600
Good-bye.

289
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,560
Thank you.

290
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,840
- I heard Gyu Ri fainted. 
 - Yes.

291
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,230
I heard that's why she couldn't take the entrance exam. Where did she faint?

292
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:42,820
In the academy alley in front of the pharmacy.

293
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,930
I just came back from the hospital.

294
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,810
The aftereffect is severe because she was found late.

295
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,150
But, why did she faint?

296
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:51,220
They say it's from an overdose of stimulants.

297
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:56,630
I think she took too many stimulants when she got sleepy and didn't eat enough.

298
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,220
 Department of Law at Hankuk University. You can do this! Don't give up till the end. 

299
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,580
 Kim Gyu Ri 

300
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,790
 Department of Law at Hankuk University. You can do this! Don't give up till the end. 

301
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:29,720
 Rumors said that Gyu Ri went on to attend Law School at Hankuk University. 

302
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:36,380
 But I had never heard Kim Gyu Ri's name in both Hankuk University and the Law community. 

303
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,190
 I wonder why? 

304
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:50,240
 Today, her fate was changed through me. 

305
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,110
 What would Gyu Ri's future be like? 

306
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:00,210
Jong Il, do you know what this is?

307
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,110
What is it?

308
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,680
It's a hot-ticket item these days.

309
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,920
  Just one and done. 

310
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:11,690
Really? Good. I've been getting really tired of Han Mi playing hard to get.

311
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,350
Put one in her drink at the club later.

312
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,810
Okay.

313
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,820
Han Mi is on her way.

314
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:37,010
Our pathetic Kim Hui Wu, aren't you working hard.

315
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:38,900
Do well.

316
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,880
Bye-bye.

317
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,660
♫  I can feel love  ♫

318
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,760
♫  Feel love  ♫

326
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,520
Let's go see Han Mi.

327
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:30,380
 Wow, she is really hot. 

328
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:33,420
 Hey, let's get a better look. 

329
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:41,880
Gosh, these dirty bastards. Look what they're up to.

330
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,440
That punk must be crazy.

331
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:53,700
Look at that confidence.

332
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:02,330
Manners...

333
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,010
maketh...

334
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,080
man.

335
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:16,400
The movie hasn't been released yet, right?

336
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,630
Did I just put on a show again?

337
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:22,810
What is that bastard saying? You're a dead man.

338
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:29,990
It won't do. Today, you guys are going to get some true education.

339
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:32,640
What a load of crap.

340
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,530
That hurts!

341
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,620
- What happened? 
 - Are you awake?

342
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,660
I asked what happened!

343
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:40,530
Here you go.

344
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:01,280
  Chief Im Jeong Wu 

345
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,750
Do you guys know where you are?

346
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:20,180
Guys.

347
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,300
I am asking you.

348
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:25,840
Whatever this place is, I don't know why I am here.

349
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,310
Why criminals like you are sitting in the police chief's office,

350
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:32,660
I am asking you if you know why.

351
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,990
Why am I a criminal?

352
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:40,620
You reported that your drink was spiked, right? That's why we investigated it. Diligently.

353
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:45,370
 Thankfully, the drug packet was found in the trash. 

354
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:47,040
Who was it?

355
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,020
What are you doing?

356
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:53,590
- I will pull out your eyes, you son of a— 
 - Quiet!

357
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:59,640
My son also drank alcohol without knowing his friends had spiked it for fun.

358
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:04,540
That's why he was mentally and physically weak.

359
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:10,040
But one guy came out of nowhere and assaulted my son.  Why did you beat him?

360
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:15,320
I went there to save my friend. These guys didn't listen to me, so I gave them a warning.

361
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,580
I don't know if you checked the crime scene.

362
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,810
That guy threw a liquor bottle at me.

363
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:23,810
It broke creating a scratch on the wall.

364
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,750
Do you see this?

365
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:29,420
It was not a one-sided assault. Self-defense.

366
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,090
So you did beat him.

367
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:35,910
I will repeat myself. It was self-defense.

368
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:42,140
 Injury Certificate. 

369
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:46,120
I heard you're hard-working. Why didn't you consider your future?

370
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:52,410
I thought I'd never see the day a police chief fabricated an incident and threatened kids.

371
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:54,500
Shut up!

372
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,490
Deputy Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hoon, what brings you here?

373
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:03,250
 Kim Seok Hoon? Why is this guy here? 

374
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:08,690
- Are you Im Jong Il? 
 - Yes.

375
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:12,050
- You made a mistake, right? 
 - I haven't done anything wrong.

376
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,530
- You haven't done anything wrong? 
 - No.

377
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,330
 Deputy Chief Prosecutor. 

378
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,440
 Do you have a death wish? 

379
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:38,780
 Shinju Police Station 

380
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:46,750
What is this? Kim Seok Hun had only one son.

381
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:50,260
Hey, Kim Hui Wu.

382
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,240
Let's go eat.

383
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:55,720
- I already ate. 
 - But I didn't.

384
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,930
- So what do you want? 
 - Let's eat together.

385
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:58,510
- I said I already ate.
 - I can't eat alone.

386
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:59,960
- So what about it? 
 - I am saying let's eat together.

387
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,350
- I already ate. 
 - What do you want me to do?

388
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:02,900
- Let's eat together. 
 - That's right, let's eat.

389
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:06,370
Okay, let's eat— Wait, what?

390
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,150
Gosh, I got confused.

391
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:13,500
I don't want to eat. I already ate.

392
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,250
It's not me.

393
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,220
Hey, is it me then? I can tell if my stomach makes noise.

394
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:29,360
Hey, I want to buy you food because I am grateful. Why are you being crazy and rejecting?

395
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:34,050
Being obsessive about not eating together is crazy, not rejecting.

396
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,950
I'm being obsessive?

397
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:40,750
Hey. I just want to repay you, so why are making me look pathetic?

398
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:43,960
I will respectfully turn you down. Why?

399
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:56,190
What are you doing?

400
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:59,700
I can smell cigarettes.

401
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:03,130
I feel sick if I smell cigarettes.

402
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,570
Sorry I'm late.

403
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:32,410
Welcome. Deputy Chief Kim.

404
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:35,220
I am sorry, sir. I had to deal with something.

405
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:39,730
I am sure it went well since you handled it yourself.

406
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:44,680
- Yes. 
 -  Every large fissure starts with a tiny crack. Be careful always.

407
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,740
I will keep that in mind.

408
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:55,190
So, how is it? You are the first one in your class to become a Deputy Chief Prosecutor. How are you feeling?

409
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:56,650
I am just thankful.

410
00:31:56,650 --> 00:32:01,120
I will do my best so that no one crosses your path and gets in your way.

411
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:06,450
Just continue what you are doing now—the path you want to take.

412
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,730
Your capabilities...

413
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:16,180
I will form that path and fill in whatever you lack.

414
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,560
How's the taste?

415
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:30,710
Yes, welcome.

416
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:33,960
Kim Gyu Ri.

417
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,620
- What is this? 
 - Summary notes.

418
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:43,980
 It's better to go on the faster and more accurate path, right? 

419
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:47,780
-  I am paying you back.  
 - Pay me back?

420
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:52,220
Thank you for helping me last time. I am not the type to owe someone.

421
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:56,580
All my study know-how is in it, so use it well.

422
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:59,250
Thank you.

 College Scholastic Ability Test held today is said to have been harder than the previous years. 

448
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:38,740
 In particular, the math section will determine the discrimination ability of the top students. 

449
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,860
 For this reason, students who did well in the mathematics section...

What is the mathematics section?

451
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,250
Math. Math!

Okay. I am sure the result will be good since you studied hard.

00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,790
I want to work part-time more.

475
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:13,470
- A part-time job? 
 -  Yes. 

476
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:16,730
I want to pay my own tuition.

477
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:20,210
 Since you're going to work anyway, 

478
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:23,720
 my brother's office is looking to hire someone for document assistance.  

479
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,260
 I think it'll suit you well. 

480
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:29,890
 KMS Law Firm's Head Attorney Kang Min Seok. 

481
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:33,040
 In the past life, he was famous for a high winning rate. 

482
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,240
 I can't believe he was Teacher Min Gyeong's brother. 

483
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:43,500
Kim Hui Wu?

484
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,800
Yes.

485
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,800
Nice to meet you.

486
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,770
Hello.

487
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:54,690
I heard about you from my sister. She said you're smart, and you want to major in law at Hankuk University.

488
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:57,650
So, do you have any interest in this field?

489
00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:01,330
I have an interest in law, so I have read a few books related to it.

490
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:06,430
Even if it's moderately related to law, it's quite difficult. You must know more than I thought.

491
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:08,190
Work won't be hard here.

492
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:12,890
Assisting Chief Seo to organize documents, preparing for meetings, and submitting documents to the court from time to time.

493
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:16,320
Yes. It's not at all hard. I will work hard.

494
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,960
While you are working, if you want any law-related help, come to me anytime.

495
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,110
Yes, sir.

496
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,630
Let's work well together.

497
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,540
I put myself in your hands.

498
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:27,450
This case is going to be an iconic one for our law firm.

499
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:28,950
But, our opponent is Cheonha Group.

500
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:31,320
It's dangerous. They are formidable.

501
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,880
Why would environmental groups use us as legal representatives?

502
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,830
Because they think we can fight against Cheonha Group.

503
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:39,770
CEO, sir!

504
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:42,850
They want to destroy a mountain and build a resort. We should stop it for sure.

505
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:44,850
I would understand if Cheongpoong Mountain was famous.

506
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:46,700
 Cheongpoongsan? 

507
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,170
 The lawsuit that took five years? 

508
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:49,830
Are you going against Cheonha Group?

509
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:51,680
Even public opinion won't be on our side.

510
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,850
That's right.

511
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:55,120
We can't do this, sir.

512
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,470
Crisis is an opportunity.

513
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:59,390
It will be difficult, but we have to do it at any cost.

514
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:01,400
Sir, please think carefully.

515
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,210
Please reconsider.

516
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:05,110
By putting KMS's fate on the line,

517
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:08,170
let's try it. We can do it.

518
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:26,380
  It's described as an "endangered plant."  

519
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:33,420
  Callipogon relictus  

520
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,430
  Callipogon relictus  

521
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:47,380
  A rare 4mm creature that stopped a 9-trillion won mining development project. 

522
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:51,170
  Callipogon relictus.  

523
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:53,740
 Endangered Wildlife Class 1. 

524
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:57,920
Gwangneung Yogang Flower. Endangered Class 1 Protected Species.

525
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,350
Listed in the critical category of the International Union for Conservation of Nature's World Red List.

526
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:06,780
A large-scale colony of endangered species of mimosa.

527
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:10,120
All of these are on Cheongpoong Mountain.

528
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:13,830
Development or ecosystem conservation? With this, let's fight a winning case.

529
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:17,110
 Kang Min Seok will become a star with this lawsuit. 

530
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:19,200
 He will fight and win against the Cheonha Group. 

531
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:24,290
 He created an opportunity for environmental evaluation to be strengthened in domestic developments projects. 

532
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:30,420
Our part-time worker did everything he should, as well as things he didn't need to.

533
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:33,990
You make it impossible for me not to compensate you beyond the salary.

534
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:35,410
Pardon?

535
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:40,720
I thought cash would be best.

536
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,660
You are wise!

537
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,410
 ₩1,000,000 

538
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:50,810
But this is too much.

539
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:52,930
Because I am a big person.

540
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:54,650
You are wise!

541
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:56,530
Thank you!

542
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,160
  Check Application Status for Hanguk University  

543
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:02,110
  Checking for the result  

544
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:03,820
Why is it taking so long?!

545
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,060
  Checking for the result  

546
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:07,290
  Congratulations. 
 Mr. Kim Hui Wu is accepted into the Department of Law at Hanguk University.  

547
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:09,240
Passed? Passed!

548
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,210
Passed!

549
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,140
 Hankuk University Law School
 Law Students Gathering 

550
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:39,680
It's still the same here.

551
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:59,170
Is Gyu Ri still not here yet?

552
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:22,660
It's been a while, Professor Min Byong San.

553
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:26,880
  Civil Code  

554
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,980
Civil law is not a science.

555
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:31,940
Civil law is not a science.

556
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:37,100
It is a user's guide that people of this generation should follow with common sense.

557
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,270
Now, for example.

558
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:43,870
One student rented a room which was the subject of a mortgage of thirty million won.

559
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:46,360
The student was later in priority than the mortgage.

560
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:49,500
But the house was at auction.

561
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:54,280
Also, the winning bid was even lower than the indebtedness secured by the mortgage.

562
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:58,540
So this student couldn't get his deposit back.

563
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:00,960
What will you do in this situation?

564
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,950
You have no choice but to give up.

565
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:07,530
If you knew that you were in later priority and signed the lease, then I think there's no way to get out of it.

566
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,750
Does anyone have a different opinion?

567
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:20,640
I'll get the deposit back.

568
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,870
- Get the deposit back? 
 - Yes.

569
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:24,430
How?

570
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:27,800
The market price for the deposits for rooms around colleges isn't that high.

571
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,910
So even if the house went into auction,

572
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:33,540
you can get a minimum award under the Small Amount Housing Lease Protection Act.

573
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:34,820
- Also... 
 - Also?

574
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:38,380
You don't have to pay the rent during the auction period, so it's more beneficial.

575
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:42,810
On top of that, you can even receive the moving expenses when the owner asks you to vacate.

576
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:48,560
He's pretty good. He gave a more detailed answer than I did.

577
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,540
It's an answer that's hard to get from a freshmen class.

578
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:54,780
That's correct. What you just said is the Civil Code.

579
00:42:54,780 --> 00:43:00,400
If you know, then it'll protect you from the danger that might come at any time.

580
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,330
You! What's your name?

581
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,920
I'm Kim Hui Wu.

582
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,890
Kim Hui Wu?

583
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:09,400
Kim Hui Wu.

584
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,680
That's all for today!

585
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,120
Thank you so much!

586
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:23,230
I guess you studied a lot to get in.

587
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:25,130
Nice to meet you. I'm Park Seung Hwan.

588
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:27,450
Yes, nice to meet you. I'm Kim Hui Wu.

589
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:30,370
You know there's a freshmen welcome party tonight, right?

590
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:32,320
Seonbae Choi Kang Jin said we should all gather.

591
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:35,400
- Choi Kang Jin? 
 - The student president of the law school, Seonbae Choi Kang Jin.

592
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,610
Choi Kang Jin...

593
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:40,600
Are you going to go there? What's so big a deal about seniors?

594
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:45,150
Who are you?

595
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:46,910
Me? I'm Lee Min Su.

596
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:48,500
Ah, yes.

597
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,690
Hello, I'm a freshman, Kim Hui Wu.

598
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:53,030
I know you, Kim Hui Wu.

599
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:56,280
- We are in the same year, let's be friends. 
 - I'm sorry?

600
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:59,650
Is that something that surprising? Do you think it's a loss for you?

601
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:00,460
Of course not.

602
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:03,810
You don't look that young either.

603
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:05,500
So are you going?

604
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,470
- He said everybody should definitely come. 
 - That makes me definitely not go.

605
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:08,920
Sure, you don't have to come.

606
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,240
- Also, the dress code is business suits. 
 - That's ridiculous. I'm not coming.

607
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,250
Again, you don't have to come.

608
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:16,890
Also, Seonbae Jang Il Hyeon, who was the top of the class at the Judicial Research and Training Institute, is coming too.

609
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:18,220
Jang Il Hyeon?

610
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:20,410
Does that make your heart move?

611
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:21,950
Yes.

612
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:24,990
How am I supposed to watch people being pretentious?

613
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:26,190
You said you are not coming.

614
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:28,420
How can I not go when my friend is going?

615
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:29,670
Who said he's your friend?

616
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:31,120
He's not saying anything. Why are you bothered about that?

617
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,320
Wait, Hui Wu. Let's go get some coffee.

618
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,030
- All of a sudden? 
 - Yes.

619
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:37,170
- Why don't you hang out with your friends? 
 - You are my friend.

620
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:38,660
- Let's go. 
 - Since when?

621
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:40,370
From today!

622
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:42,780
How can he be so self-centered?

623
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:45,380
How far are we going for a coffee?

624
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:47,170
There were a lot of coffee shops in front of the school.

625
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:50,100
My friend. Even if it's just a cup of coffee, drink it with class.

626
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:54,670
There's a national barista called the Alchemist of Coffee.

627
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:55,510
The taste of coffee is amazing—

628
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:59,000
You evil wench! How dare you come in here?

629
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,940
How dare you come here?

630
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:04,370
Honey...

631
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:06,130
Excuse me?

632
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:08,170
- Honey! 
 - Oh my, me?

633
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:10,220
Are you saying that to me?

634
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:16,860
I'm sorry. She's suffering from dementia.

635
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:17,760
I'm okay.

636
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,340
I went out for a second to get some medicine.

637
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:27,360
So I told you just to leave it by the door when I'm not home.

638
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,320
It's not good if the food gets cold.

639
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:32,030
Also, it's not good for you to have cold food .

640
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:34,140
You got a stomach ache after having cold food the other time.

641
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:36,310
It's because I'm sorry.

642
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:38,000
How many times has this happened already?

643
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,440
I'm okay.

644
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:44,330
Here. It's still warm.

645
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:46,770
Please take this home and have it with your wife. 
   Lunchbox of Love, Faith Welfare Foundation  

646
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:48,800
Thank you.

647
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,190
Have a nice day.

648
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:51,370
Let's meet in our next life.

649
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:53,350
See you!

650
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,320
Lunchbox of Love.

651
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:01,660
So you are a lunchbox delivery volunteer for the vulnerable group?

652
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:02,930
Yes.

653
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:04,650
Wait, let me see your back.

654
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:07,780
Oh? You are an angel without wings.

655
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:11,290
Anyway, thank you.

656
00:46:11,290 --> 00:46:13,930
I thought I was really going to be beaten with that broomstick.

657
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:17,790
I'm glad you didn't get hurt.

658
00:46:17,790 --> 00:46:22,460
It's a precious connection that we have by the broomstick. Why don't we talk about it more

659
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:24,410
with drinks and meat in front of us—

660
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:25,950
I'm late!

661
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:28,420
Bye! Thank you for helping me today!

662
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:30,430
Bye!

663
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,850
She's really moving my heart.

664
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:36,950
I'll save it in my heart!

665
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:41,810
What is it? How do you know this already?

666
00:46:41,810 --> 00:46:45,160
This thing? I've been doing it for a long time. Do you want me to do it for you, too? Save in my heart!

667
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,950
I mean... Really?

668
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:50,410
Then is it not real?

669
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:54,820
It's very confusing...

 2008 Welcome Night For Freshmen 

672
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:06,520
Thank you.

673
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,520

674

  Kim Hui Wu  

675
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:39,040
You came.

676
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,360
Yes.

677
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,130
Excuse me for a second.

678
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:47,270
Congratulations.

679
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:51,650
Hello, Sunbaenim!

680
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:53,690
Yes, Seung Hwan!

681
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,540
  Choi Kang Jin?  

682
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:01,630
  This is Prosecutor Choi Kang Jin, whom I talked about before.  

683
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:04,160
  Why don't you introduce yourself to him properly?  

684
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,470
  Hello, sir.  

685
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:09,350
  Yes, nice to meet you. Let's work well together. 
    

686
00:48:11,370 --> 00:48:14,180
  He's very trustworthy.  

687
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:16,730
  You are such a good-looking man.  

688
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:19,430
  You have to work very hard from now on.  

689
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:23,250
  This election wasn't a victory for me, Choi Kang Jin, 

690
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:27,530
  but for all of you who voted for me.  

691
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:31,970
  I'll be the Assemblyman who represents truth and justice.  

692
00:48:31,970 --> 00:48:36,520
  I'll make a warm society where we can embrace the vulnerable and underrepresented groups of people!  

693
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:39,260
  Choi Kang Jin. He started as a prosecutor,  

694
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:43,610
  then a human-rights lawyer, and became an Assemblyman. A piece of trash.   

695
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,390
Good to see you.

696
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:49,640
Is he a freshman?

697
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:56,510
Yes, I'm Kim Hui Wu.

698
00:48:56,510 --> 00:49:00,300
Oh, yes. I heard about you from Seung Hwan.

699
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:06,650
Some freshmen think passing the bar exam is all there is and don't care about school life.

700
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:10,120
That's not true. It's good to come out to these gatherings.

701
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,580
I'll engrave that on my heart, Sunbaenim.

702
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:17,350
Right. That way, you can broaden your connections. You can pull and push each other in the world.

703
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:20,210
Also, you can close your eyes to each other and scheme things together.

704
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:23,420
That way, you can stuff each other's stomachs. It's stuff like that.

705
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:25,970
Why don't you have some manners?

706
00:49:25,970 --> 00:49:27,260
Are you back at school, Lee Min Su?

707
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:30,080
- Yes, I came back because I missed you. Have you been well? 
 - It sucks.

708
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,990
- I can hear you. 
 - I said it for you to hear it.

709
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:33,830
Sunbae Kang Jin is a senior. How do you know each other?

710
00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:36,290
He got into medical school when I came into law school.

711
00:49:36,290 --> 00:49:38,980
Also, we graduated high school together.

712
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:41,710
I guess you didn't like fine art and music school.

713
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:45,360
You are right. And I need to figure out law school after spending some time here.

714
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:49,760
  Lee Min Su. I didn't know this person in my previous life.  

715
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,120
  I guess my past changed, so he appeared in my life?  

716
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:55,970
Now, our Hanguk University Department of Law's remarkable!

717

Please welcome, Seonbae Jang Il Hyeon!

718
00:49:58,150 --> 00:50:00,340
  Welcome night for Freshmen of Hanguk University Department of Law  

719
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:02,600
Welcome, Sunbaenim.

720
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:17,520
Hello, my dear Hanguk University Department of Law students. I'm Jang Il Hyeon.

721
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:18,630
  Jang Il Hyeon.  

722
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:21,220
  You stupid dumb punk!  

723
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:25,060
  How dare you dig into Jo Tae Seob?  

724
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:28,920
  He's a great man doing big work. Who do you think you are!  

725
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:31,710
  How dare you make an issue out of insignificant things!  

726
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:34,490
  Under the Act on the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Crimes, bribery,  

727
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:37,690
  embezzlement of government projects, abuse of authority... 

728
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:40,760
  Besides these, he also has more than ten minor charges. 

729
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:43,390
  Do you want me to report this to you?   

730
00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:46,240
  This punk... 

731
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,530
  You are such a dummy.  

732
00:50:47,530 --> 00:50:51,110
  Hey, he can do that in his position.  

733
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:55,760
  If you keep acting out this way, you'll be the one who goes to jail.  

734
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,380
  Just shut your mouth quiet, you punk!  

735
00:50:57,380 --> 00:51:01,660
We will protect our nation's rights through the law

736
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:05,710
and make people's daily lives comfortable.

737
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:09,920
I hope you all have a good time tonight with your friends and alumni and share your dreams together.

738
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:16,820
  Welcome Night for Freshmen  

739
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:21,120
I think you are not suited for events like this.

740
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,890
I'm like that, too.

741
00:51:22,890 --> 00:51:27,060
People are all being so pretentious.

742
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:30,890
It feels like I'm standing in the middle of a sandstorm.

743
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:33,240
When you inhale a lot of dust,

744
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:36,440
you have to have some greasy meat and a glass of soju.

745
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:39,690
- Let's go. If you buy it, then it's better. 
 - Oh, no.

746
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:41,700
- Oh, you're getting it for me? 
 - I didn't say that.

747
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:43,860
- Thank you for the meal. 
 - What?

748
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:47,020
No, wait.

749
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,300
I said, no!

750
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:50,210
Hurry up and come!

751
00:51:51,590 --> 00:51:53,920
  What's up with that person?  

752
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,910
♫   Chicken and beer   ♫

753
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:03,070
♫   Shall we have a fried chicken and beer?    ♫

754
00:52:03,070 --> 00:52:04,860
Why do you study?

755
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:06,100
What?

756
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:10,080
Then let me ask it this way. Do you want to be successful?

757
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:13,500
Does it look that way?

758
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,630
Yes.

759
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:18,650
Of course. I have to be successful.

760
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:20,350
How high do you want to go?

761
00:52:20,350 --> 00:52:21,490
What?

762
00:52:21,490 --> 00:52:25,070
As I think about it, I have the world in my hands.

763
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:28,730
I wonder if I should squeeze them shut or open them up.

764
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:30,370
Not laughing?

765
00:52:30,370 --> 00:52:34,860
Usually, you laugh when I say stuff like this and say stop reading comics.

766
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,370
No, no.

767
00:52:36,370 --> 00:52:37,820
I also think the same way.

768
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:42,920
I knew it.  When I first met you, I felt we were alike.

769
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:46,420
We must be a perfect match. Want to marry me?

770
00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:49,800
Do you want to marry me?

771
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,420
What kind of thinking is that?

772
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:56,560
Since at our school, you were the only person who could tolerate me.

773
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:57,630
- No. 
 - You!

774
00:52:57,630 --> 00:52:58,610
I don't like it.

775
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:00,200
Stop it.

776
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:04,060
Anyway, med school, art and music school...

777
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:07,360
In general, didn't you find it difficult to study?

778
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:10,090
There's nothing as easy and fulfilling to me as studying.

779
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:11,880
So easy.

780
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:15,080
The world is a tough place and people have a hard time, right?

781
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:18,620
  Lee Min Su. I wonder what kind of change he would bring from now on.  

782
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:20,990
  I can't picture it at all.   

783
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,350
Hey!

784
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:34,630
- Why do you take a picture of women's legs? 
 - What?

785
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:38,000
You just took a photo of a part-timer girl who just passed by. You pervert!

786
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,690
- Do you have evidence? 
 - Yes.

787
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:41,990
Your phone.

788
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:44,430
Oh? She's the one who I saved in my heart.

789
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:46,940
You asked me if I had evidence. It's on your phone!

790
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:51,210
She was a humanist before, but she's a warrior here.

791
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:53,690
Why would I give my phone to you? Are you crazy?

792
00:53:53,690 --> 00:53:57,020
Unless you want to see real craziness, give me your phone now.

793
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:59,300
Are you not going to shut up?

794
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:02,130
You are an embarrassment. Why don't you take off the school jacket?

795
00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:03,900
Hey, Hey!!

796
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:05,240
- What? 
 - I said, shut up.

797
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:06,420
Shut your mouth up!

798
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:07,720
Don't we need to go and stop him?

799
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:11,370
Hello, there's a fight in the college pub in front of the front gate of Hanguk University.

800
00:54:11,370 --> 00:54:14,400
I think you have to hurry up.

801
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,810
You are beyond my expectations as well. It's a very not cool way to deal with it.

802
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:20,500
This is the real way to help her.

803
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:23,120
If it escalates after we try to help her, what will you do then?

804
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,580
- That's true. 
 - Yes. 
 - Shall we wait and see?

805
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:29,650
Jeez. Stop acting out when you are nothing.

806
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:32,500
- Where are you going? 
 - Damn. Jeez.

807
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:37,110
Hey, student, this is not right.

808
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:40,590
Police are coming, so please calm down.

809
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:42,330
What? Police?

810
00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:45,130
Let me go, you bastard. Who are you?

811
00:54:45,130 --> 00:54:46,860
Who are you to interfere with this?

812
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:49,400
Just go on your way.

813
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:57,140
Hey, you. You are more than disgraceful right now.

814
00:54:57,140 --> 00:55:00,600
So just stay quiet until the police come. Okay?

815
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:02,810
I understand.

816
00:55:02,810 --> 00:55:05,700
Please, please.

817
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:12,300
You bastard, it's a lucky day for you!

818
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:16,020
Why are you stumbling on my feet by yourself?

819
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:19,400
We got a report.

820
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,460
- Yes, he's the bad guy. 
 - I didn't do anything!

821
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:23,020
It's not me!

822
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:25,680
I really didn't do anything!

823
00:55:37,370 --> 00:55:39,360
We meet again.

824
00:55:42,570 --> 00:55:44,170
Cheers.

825
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:51,950
It's really unavoidable, I think.

826
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:55,070
I think it's called meant to be. You can't escape from it.

827
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:00,780
Does my face have anything on it?

828
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:02,800
No. I am sorry.

829
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:05,450
I was just thinking about something else.

830
00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:08,540
- From what I heard you say before, are you a Hanguk University student? 
 - Yes.

831
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:11,240
- We are also at the same university. 
 - Are you going to Hanguk University as well?

832
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:14,230
- We are both freshmen in Law School. 
 - Oh, really?

833
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:16,350
I'm a freshman in Computer Science. I'm Kim Hui Ah.

834
00:56:16,350 --> 00:56:19,030
I'm Kim Hui Wu. I'm 21 years old because I took the college entrance exam twice.

835
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:21,980
I'm also 21 years old and took the college entrance exam twice.

836
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:25,520
KIm Hui Wu,  Kim Hui Ah.

837
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:28,500
Our names look similar too.

838
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:31,040
It is really meant to be. I can't avoid it.

839
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,200
That's what I said.

840
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,260
Then, since we are the same age, let's talk comfortably.

841
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:37,170
You are very progressive! I'm Lee Min Su. It's nice to meet you.

842
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:38,450
I'm Hui Wu's friend, so you can talk comfortably to me as well.

843
00:56:38,450 --> 00:56:40,220
I think we should drink properly.

844
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:43,270
I feel like you are pretending not to hear me the whole time.

845
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:49,450
Okay. Since two of my same school friends helped me today, I'll pay for tonight.

846
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:51,610
- Oh, I like it very much.  Okay.
 - Okay.

847
00:56:51,610 --> 00:56:53,960
- Cheer.
 - Cheer.

848
00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:57,800
You are not listening to me for sure.

849
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:05,920
Why are you keep looking at me like that?

850
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:08,150
It's because you look a bit familiar.

851
00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:10,180
You can hear that lame line from him?

852
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:13,210
But you look familiar to me as well.

853
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:15,360
Wow, how can you take that old line from him?

854
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:20,180
  She does look familiar somehow, but I don't remember her.  

855
00:57:26,490 --> 00:57:28,430
  Who is she?  

856
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:36,970
  Bus 278: Going to Anguk-dong, Ganghwamun  

857
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:31,960


858
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:51,320
♫  Dear, All your things you've done  ♫

859

874
01:00:03,710 --> 01:00:05,520
  It's because I thought of a good move.  

875
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:09,180
  We decided to accept you into our secret club in the Department of Law.  

876
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:13,080
  If my eyes are correct, she can be Jo Tae Seob's target at any time.
