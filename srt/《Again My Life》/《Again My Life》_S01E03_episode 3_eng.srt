00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,990
 - How are you? 
- Not very well. 

7
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:07,300
 You are lousy, as usual. 

8
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,120
 I'm  disappointed. 

9
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:22,550

 Raise your guard! 

13
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,310
 Get up. How long are you going to live getting beaten up? 

14
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:30,590
  Hyung Seong Jae ... We met sooner in this life! 

15
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,140
- What would you like to practice? 
- Can we have a sparring session?

16
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:43,130
- Sparring? 
- Yeah!

35
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,630
How old are you?

36
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:01,830
I’m 30... 20 years old.

37
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:05,030
You can work out here. I won't charge you.

38
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:08,430
You're as fiery as I expected!

39
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:11,890
As expected? You know me?

40
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:15,180
Come on! We have exchanged blows, so we are acquaintances now.

41
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,520
But aren't you talking a bit chummy with me?

42
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,910
There is no superior or inferior inside this ring. Don't be tacky.

43
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:28,170
- Should we go down and fight once more? 
 - No.

44
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:31,820
Anyway, I humbly request your guidance from now on.

45
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,820
 Be my oh~~ so best martial arts teacher in this life too. 

46
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,170
It's a deal, for now.

47
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:39,970
Deal!

48
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,690
Hi!

49
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:52,630
Oh! Hello!

50
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,170
Here!

51
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,860
I was waiting for you.

52
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:01,080
- What is this? 
-  I made it myself.

53
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,250
If one is indebted, they should surely pay it back. That's what I learned.

54
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,490
Aww. You didn't have to...

55
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:13,030
Ah! If you don't like the taste, that's on you, so don't be too surprised.

56
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,950
Wow, a special precaution too!!

57
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:17,490
Okay! Noted. Thanks for the food!

58
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,530
Yeah! See you later.

59
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:22,390
Sure.

60
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,250
Gosh, my popularity...

61
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,980
Looks delicious!

62
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,120
Umm.... No, no.

63
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,590
It must be me. Let's not get flustered.

64
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:13,650
Kim Gyu Ri!

65
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,850
What is this?

66
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:30,990
- But did Kim Gyu Ri come to college today? 
 - No.

67
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:34,410
- Don't you guys attend the same academy? 
 - That's right.

68
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:39,360
Then contact her. We have to distribute notices, but she doesn't accept my calls.

69
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,290
I don't think I can attend college.

70
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:54,650
What?! Why?

71
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,900
My dad’s business went bankrupt.

72
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:01,660
Our house is up for sale, and Dad even fainted.

73
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:06,610
My mother, who was a housewife her whole life, is still dazed.

74
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:09,520
I am sorry to hear that.

75
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,330
You know that you are a full scholarship student, right?

76
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:16,450
I can't pay my father's hospital bills with the scholarship, right.

77
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:21,290
Considering Dad's health care, it's not that surprising.

78
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,520
I am sure there's a way. You should attend college.

79
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,140
The situation is worse than I thought.

80
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:29,220
If the house also gets sold, then our family...

81
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:33,410
I need to gather money for a studio room deposit.

82
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:37,160
There's nothing I can do. I need to try something.

83
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,110
But, I am earning quite a bit these days.

84
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:44,050
Guess how much a private tutor with a perfect score on the college entrance exam gets paid?

85
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,650
Hello! What?

86
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:58,340
Yes, I understand. Yes!

87
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,450
I’ll be right there.

88
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,120
What? Something happened?

89
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,020
I think my dad just collapsed.  Thank you for your concern, Hui Wu. I'll see you next time.

90
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,970
 That's why the Gyu Ri of my past life wasn't there. 

91
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:16,660
 Because she gave up on her studies. 

92
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,560
 Then... 

93
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:24,090
 Seoul Central District Court 

94
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,520
Since it's my first time at an auction court, it's so unfamilar.

95
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,820
Ajumma, please give me an auction information booklet.

96
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:37,350
- Ah, here you go. There are a lot of good items.

97
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:42,050
- Excuse me. Give me one, please.
 - Here you go.

98
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,780
Let's see.

99
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:55,730
Gyu Ri's apartment information is here too.

100
00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:02,760
Yeah, I'll be able to see firsthand the competition and the winning bid.

101
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:18,160
Case number 2008 Ta-Gyeong 7611

102
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,850
 Wu Yong Su, 354,999,000 Won - successful bid winner. 

103
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:24,390
Again?

104
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:29,270
 TN: "Ta Gyeong" is a fictional case citation, usually denotes type of case, here, the "Gyeong" denotes Auction.) 

105
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:33,660
 Wu Yong Su? Where have I heard it?   

106
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:37,940
 That's already two apartments and three villas. 

107
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:41,650
 They were all bought for half their market value. 

108
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:48,070
Case Number 2008  Ta-Gyeong 7913

109
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:53,460
 If I can buy these places for a profit, not only can I cover Gyu Ri's apartment 

110
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:57,380
 I can also raise funds to respond to Jo Tae Seop. 

111
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:02,230
 But... I don't have enough yet. 

112
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:23,040
Are there such things as hacks to auctions as well?

113
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,740

122
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:01,770
 Stamina. Studies. Money. I can't give up on any of them. 

123
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,170
A is the owner of patent A.

124
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:11,490
But B produced and sold the product using A's technology without A's permission.

125
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:16,920
Tell me about the legal measures A can take at this time.

126
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,590
- Kim Hui Wu. 
 - Yes!

127
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:33,600
First, under Article 750 of the Civil Act

128
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,980
and Article 128 of the Patent Act, the right to claim damages can be exercised.

129
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,360
Article 126 of the Patent Act grants the right to seek a preliminary injunction

130
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,720
and a permanent injunction against patent infringement.

131
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,370
Also, the right to claim reinstatement of the business reputation under Article 131 of the Patent Act

132
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:52,410
and Article 741 of the Civil Act provides the right to sue for the return of unjust enrichment.

133
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:58,340
Under the Criminal Code, a person who infringes on a patent or exclusive right can be reported or sued.

134
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,200
You're like a professional!

135
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,220
Now then, that is all for today!

136
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:09,110
Thank you, Professor!

137
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:15,350
Hey, Hui Wu, there's this octopus restaurant...

138
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,990
Hey, Hui Wu, Hui Wu—

139
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:22,010
Do you have to use the restroom?

140
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,500
He's fast.

141
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,700
 Seoul District Court Auction Court 

142
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,290
Case Number 2008 TaGyeong 2534

143
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:35,900
  Wu Yong Su, 32,845,000 Won - successful bid winner.  

144
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:39,020
 TaGyeong 2637 

145
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,150
Wu Yong Su, 35,910,000 Won - successful bid winner.

146
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:44,610
 TaGyeong 2718. Wu Yong Su 

147
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:48,280
 52,740,000 Won - successful bid winner. 

148
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,800
 Three villas... 

149
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:08,200
 It was like this last time.  But why now, when the market isn't even good. 

150
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:17,240
If you don't know, then you have to go and see directly.

151
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,860
It's underground.... underground.

152
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:08,150
All of the villas that were auctioned off are on the basement floor...

153
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,620
Why?

154
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:26,080
There's nothing special about this area so why was it auctioned off?

155
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,590
What's so different about this place?

156
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:32,790
I have no idea.

157
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,120
Elder!

158
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,540
 Seoul District Court Auction Court 

159
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,090
Hello!

160
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:49,780
I am Kim Hui Wu, a Hankuk  U. law student studying court law.

161
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:54,430
What business does a court law student have with me?

162
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:58,400
- I want to earn money.
 - And?

163
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,760
I was looking around about the property you won at the bidding last week.

164
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,420
Looking at potential profit from selling, the real estate market is not very active.

165
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:10,010
They wouldn't even be profitable if you rented them out because they are half-basement properties.

166
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:15,240
For the life of me, I couldn't understand why on earth you would try to buy such property on a bid.

167
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,650
If you don't know then you can't earn money.

168
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:21,760
And I am not obligated to explain it to you either.

169
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,270
Elder! Then, at least a hint.

170
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:27,750
Did I ask the question? What hint?

171
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:31,800
Look at the map.

172
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,170
Map?

173
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:53,490
Other than them being in Seoul, there is no other connection.

174
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,740
Ah, what is it?

175
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,820
Wait.

176
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,610
These locations...

177
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,050
Redevelopment!

178
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:28,330
It was redevelopment!

179
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,950
A place where redevelopment is expected in the future due to the rise in local values.

180
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:38,800
The last remaining  goldmine-like land in Seoul. And if you only count the stakes in the basement homes...

181
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,230
You can make a huge profit at a cheap cost!

182
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:45,370
Yeah, that was easy. You should have known that much already.

183
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,680
I need a teacher like you. Please teach me.

184
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,940
I have no interest in teaching someone.

185
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:58,960
Then, let me just watch you as you work.

186
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,890
Please, I beg you.

187
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:04,230
Do you know what real estate is?

188
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:08,520
Real estate starts with the ground, then the building and planting trees.

189
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,930
In order to raise its value. In other words, it's greed!

190
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:16,450
- Greed? 
 - Do you know the price of greed?

191
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:19,050
Loss of character.

192
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:20,650
 Keep this in mind. 

193
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:26,490
 You cannot catch the devil until you become a bigger monster. 

194
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:30,130
How can you succeed without greed?

195
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:32,470
And how can you make contributions without success?

196
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:36,370
Couldn't you cultivate that greed and use it for good?

197
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:40,210
Fat chance of that.

198
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:43,550
Elder. Please look into my eyes.

199
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:48,840
I believe that it is important to know how to read people as much as the land.

200
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:53,750
What do you think? It looks nice, right? You felt that from the beginning, right?

201
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,740
I am a righteous man.

202
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:59,200
You must be crazy.

203
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,820
You keep calling me Elder, but you mock me. Fine.

204
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:07,150
Then, I'll give you a test.

205
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,530
 Eviction Notice 

206
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:16,670
- That's for Basement Number 1. 30 minutes should be enough, right? 
 - What?

207
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:20,520
Evict them within the allotted time.

208
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:25,750
So you mean, kick out the people that are living here?

209
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:30,650
Correct. Keep the moving costs at a minimum, and they are to move within a month.

210
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:35,650
If you can do it in 30 minutes, I'll take you in.

211
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:48,270
Umm... When can you move out?

212
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:56,420
Yes... I understand that this isn't an easy decision.

213
00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:00,440
I don't know what to do.

214
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,720
What am I supposed to do with such short notice?

215
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,340
Yes, and it's still cold outside.

216
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,350
Elder!

217
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,360
Shall we go inside?

218
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,770
Here. Let me pour you a glass.

219
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:31,390
Okay.

220
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:32,750
Here.

221
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,350
Thank you.

222
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:37,550
Can I treat you as my teacher from now on?

223
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,460
If you like.

224
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:46,480
By the way, you did a good job earlier.

225
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,210
How did you do it?

226
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:50,470
I couldn't do it.

227
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,550
And I shouldn't.

228
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:57,660
 So, money is the reason you can't leave this house? 

229
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,920
 Yes. 

230
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,580
 I don't have money. 

231
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:04,960
 I want to earn some money, but I'm not in any position to do that. 

232
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,550
 What do you mean? 

233
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,980
 That enemy I call a husband used my name to borrow money. 

234
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:13,800
 And then, he went bankrupt. 

235
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,720
 Fortunately, I was able to get by 

236
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,970
 with what I was being paid at a neighborhood restaurant. 

237
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:23,050
 But, a little while ago, 

238
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:26,180
 while I was working in the kitchen, 

239
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,480
 I got hurt. 

240
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,820
 So, I can't even work anymore. 

241
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:32,720
 The situation is pretty bad. 

242
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,530
 Where else could I go? 

243
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:37,930
 I even looked into declaring bankruptcy. 

244
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:40,040
 But the lawyer asked for 

245
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,560
 1.5 million won (1,500 USD) as the base fee. 

246
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:46,230
 - Bankruptcy? 
 - Yes, bankruptcy. 

247
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,620
 Ajummeoni, 

248
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:52,100
 I can move forward with the bankruptcy proceedings so that you can move on with your life. 

249
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,480
 But you're just a student. 

250
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,310
 I'm a law student at Hankuk University. 

251
00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:01,800
 I can do this much for free. 

252
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,500
 - Really? 
 - Yes. 

253
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:07,830
 In exchange, can you move out within a month? 

254
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:11,670
So, you didn't really do much?

255
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:13,180
Yes.

256
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,840
That's fine. The outcome matters most.

257
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,100
Why do you want to make money?

258
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,780
To prepare for what will happen in the future.

259
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,890
An investment in the future?

260
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:29,080
That's good. But there's something you need to know.

261
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:33,100
There aren't many days that go as well as it did today.

262
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:36,440
Some days happen to help you sharpen your knife.

263
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,440
That's the nature of the real estate business.

264
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:47,650
Of course, most people are going through a difficult time.

265
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:51,300
And of course, you have to heartlessly kick most of them out.

266
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:55,500
That's why real estate is known to be a business of greed and loss of character.

267
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,190
Like you said, it's something you can't do.

268
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:02,010
I'll turn that thing I shouldn't do, into something that's okay to do.

269
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:06,120
I think it'll be possible as long as I move faster and work harder.

270
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:11,320
While maintaining law and justice.

271
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,670
Your goals are big!

272
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:15,800
- Here. 
 - Yes!

273
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,030
- Here. 
 - Yes!

274
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,620
You said you'll catch the bus from here, right?

275
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,900
Yes.

276
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,170
You worked hard today.

277
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,440
- Excuse me, sir? 
  - Yes?

278
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:34,520
Um...

279
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:38,480
There's a house I really want to win the bid for.

280
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,050
Is there some way to guarantee that I win the bid?

281
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:44,560
Is there a reason you have to be the one to win the bid?

282
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,750
Someone's life depends on it.

283
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:52,750
 The consolidation of domestic financial institutions is accelerating along with the global financial crisis. 

284
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:56,340
 On the other hand, depending on where the Bando Bank goes for sale, 

285
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:59,450
 it is expected that the structure of the domestic banking sector will undergo some changes. 

286
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:03,030
 This is Kim Sae Hee is on the scene. 

287
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,930
Are you okay, Dad?

288
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,980
I told you to not feel bad about asking for help.

289
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,250
I'll be your hands and feet until you get better.

290
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:22,310
You must be tired.

291
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,830
- Go home. 
 - I'll go when Mom comes.

292
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:29,550
Don't worry. Should I massage your legs?

293
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,950
Are you okay?

294
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,050
Does it feel nice?

295
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:45,080
 KMS Law Firm 

296
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,180
Okay. What is it?

297
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:50,710
I want to participate in an apartment auction, but I'm not in the position to do it myself.

298
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,240
Auction?

299
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,280
What kind of ambition is driving you to be so active?

300
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,480
There are still a lot of things I haven't been able to do.

301
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,480
There's someone I need to help.

302
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,450
Who?

303
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:06,210
My friend's apartment went up for auction.

304
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:08,560
You're going to spend that much money on a friend?

305
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:12,130
It's someone who helped me get into Hankuk University.

306
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:14,490
- Did your friend ask for help? 
 - No,

307
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:18,380
they don't know. And they have to keep on not knowing.

308
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,660
Hmm...

309
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:24,360
And you've thought hard about this, right?

310
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,310
Yes.

311
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:28,000
Okay. I'll help you.

312
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:40,380
Why are there so many people here today?

313
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,220
 Bidding booth 

314
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,910
 I feel like everyone is bidding for Gyu Ri's house. 

315
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:48,720
  Should I bid more?  

316
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:54,640
 Do you know what mistake most newcomers make at auctions?  

317
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,650
 They're often taken in by the atmosphere  

318
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:02,880
 They think that everyone there is going after what they want  

319
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,350
 So, they get anxious.  

320
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:10,150
 That's right. Calm down Hui Wu!  

321
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:12,780
 You've already confirmed everything.  

322
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:16,790
 Bidding booth 

323
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:29,370
Case number 2008

324
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:33,410
TaGyeong 9931, Lee Ok Seon,

325
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:36,650
has won with a bid of 240 million won (240,000 USD).

326
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:43,170
Case number 2008 TaGyeong 8092...

327
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:46,150
 I'm up. Please... 

328
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:48,370
  - Please!  
 - Kang Min Seok.

329
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:51,910
Has won with a bid of 2.35 million won (235,000 USD).

330
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:01,160
Sir!

331
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:09,300
Thank you, sir. Thanks to you, I was able to win the bid.

332
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,950
Why is that thanks to me?

333
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:15,440
From now on, everything that happens at the auction house is thanks to you.

334
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,480
- Then, is it still my fault if it doesn't go well? 
 - Yes.

335
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,360
It'll make me feel better that way.

336
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,210
You're a funny one.

337
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:26,440
Anyway, that friend is the best in the country.

338
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:30,060
She's a good person. And above that, she was able to protect that talent.

339
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:33,440
- Isn't that called patriotism to the nation? 
 - I don't care about all of that.

340
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,700
Today, you must evict a tenant who won't get any money for moving

341
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,710
because she did not submit a report of her moving.

342
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:42,630
Okay.

343
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:46,500
When can you move out?

344
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,530
Can't you wait a little bit longer?

345
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:53,790
We couldn't get the moving compensation so we have no money.

346
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:59,560
Your situation is a shame, but I also can't afford to wait indefinitely.

347
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:04,450
If you move within the month, I'll cover the moving costs.

348
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:09,340
But any longer than that, and it won't be easy for me to help you

349
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,330
since I also have to pay interest to the bank.

350
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:15,860
Please just wait until I find a new place to live.

351
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:19,760
If not, we'll have to sleep on the street.

352
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:24,010
I've filed for a compulsory eviction with the court.

353
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:28,000
- Compulsory eviction? 
 - I'm not in a position to drag this out.

354
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,420
So I'll at least pay for the electricity and water bills

355
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,810
during that time.

356
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,230
Okay.

357
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:37,530
I understand.

358
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:48,430
- What do you think? 
 - Excuse me?

359
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:50,680
About that mother and daughter.

360
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:55,940
Her husband is in prison and she doesn't have any family to help her.

361
00:31:55,940 --> 00:32:00,240
She's barely making a living by doing some chores in a neighborhood market.

362
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,660
Honestly,

363
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:05,590
- it was a shame. 
 - What was a shame?

364
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,280
If not me, was it that woman?

365
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:10,110
- Of course... 
 - Is this something to have to think about?

366
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:12,850
- Of course, it's a shame for me. 
 - What?

367
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:16,540
I won the bid and have rights to that property.

368
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:20,650
But that woman infringed on my rights using her circumstances as a justification.

369
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:24,620
I've never received any money for a deposit or rent.

370
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:28,180
But I said I would pay for utilities and moving expenses,

371
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,720
even though she's not even a tenant I signed a contract with.

372
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,550
But, who is it a shame for?

373
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:39,230
Do you remember what I said about real estate?

374
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:44,590
 Real estate starts with the ground, then the building and planting trees. 

375
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:47,930
 In order to raise its value. In other words, it's greed! 

376
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:51,080
  - Greed? 
  - Do you know what the price of greed is? 

377
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,380
Yes. You said it's a business that robs you of your character.

378
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:58,020
That's right. If you start something to make money, you only pay attention to money.

379
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:01,390
Real estate is not something you can do if you pay attention to anything else.

380
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:04,480
Throw away useless emotions and only pursue profit.

381
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,560
That's how you can make real money.

382
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:11,700
Sympathy is forbidden when delivering evictions.

383
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:15,340
There are many times when kindness is repaid with poison.

384
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:18,620
It's nice to help others, but if that fails,

385
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:22,190
the other person will pull your hair to save themselves.

386
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:27,360
When that becomes a wound, and it feels like a nail is being hammered into your heart,

387
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,850
you stop being a person.

388
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:33,580
You become numb to sorrow. And seeing other people's tears becomes a nuisance,

389
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,460
and it only annoys you.

390
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:39,640
At that point, you're already a demon and a beast.

391
00:33:55,640 --> 00:34:00,610
 I knew, but the reality is much harsher and more merciless.  

392
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:05,580
 If I move a little bit faster, would I be able to make up for the rest? 

393
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:20,250
 Key Money Deposit  
  Monthly Rent 

394
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,280
Are you there?

395
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,020
What brings you here now?

396
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,950
I have something to tell you.

397
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:37,420
You didn't seem to have a lot of stuff, so I suggest that we call a moving service.

398
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:39,120
- I'll help you. 
 - Excuse me?

399
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:44,860
Call the elder tomorrow and say that you'll move out in two days and need to borrow 500 thousand won.

400
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:47,340
He'll probably agree to that amount.

401
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,960
What are you saying?

402
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,150
Here.

403
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:55,450
This is a property on the way to the subway.

404
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:59,760
There are places that just need 500 thousand won more than the cost of moving to rent.

405
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,200
It was just sold, so it's still vacant. You can move in immediately.

406
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,750
Oh... This is...

407
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:08,830
Honestly, there are some problems with the apartment.

408
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:12,520
But I'll take care of them before you move in, so you won't feel uncomfortable.

409
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,770
You shouldn't have...

410
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:18,490
- Thank you. 
 - It's nothing.

411
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:30,060
Sir!

412
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:33,100
How much more did you tell her to rip me off?

413
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:39,050
Five hundred thousand won! I told her that the real estate office down there had a cheap place!

414
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:40,700
They said they're moving soon.

415
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:44,800
That's a relief. Be careful.

416
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,880
If you are always the one to concede, you can end up being the one who falls to ruin.

417
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,850
Yes, sir. I’ll keep it in mind.

418
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:57,890
It wasn't a bad idea to find a house for them like you did today.

419
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:02,570
There won't be a reason to fight them tooth and nail.

420
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:06,350
You have a good head on your shoulders.

421
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:08,880
Keep doing that in the future.

422
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,590
Hey.

423
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:19,980
- Hui Wu.  
- Yes?

424
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:23,300
How much do you want to earn?

425
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,240
I...

426
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:27,740
This,

427
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:31,310
and... that.

428
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:32,330
 Chunha 

429
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:37,660
And, that over there, enough to buy an apartment.

430
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:42,290
Chunha Electronics, Chunha Cars.

431
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:44,580
Chunha Construction.

432
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:48,110
You want Chunha in the palm of your hands?

433
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:58,080
 Yes. I need Chunha so I can stop Jo Tae Seop. 

434
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:03,510
There will be a redevelopment boom in Seoul.

435
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:08,090
If you leave it there for a few years, it will be a lot of money, so keep it in your pocket.

436
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:09,060
Understood.

437
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:14,440
You'll know when you see it, but the man owns a few small pieces of land and some houses.

438
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:19,190
Heaven must be on your side. To your benefit, everything you needed was in the hands of one man.

439
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,570
It should be easy then.

440
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:26,190
According to Department Head Han's investigations, there were many shops and villas in the area.

441
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:31,130
The total assets are worth about 200 billion won, and after deduction of debt, the net worth is about 100 billion won.

442
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:36,440
Since you work in finance, you know how to set it up, don't you?

443
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,860
Shall I bring all of it?

444
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:42,010
He's quite old.

445
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:47,740
Help him use his assets well as his final service to his country.

446
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,430
Leave him a home to live in.

447
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:51,750
I'll take care of it right away.

448
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:56,430
 Personal Details Statement 
 Wu Yong Su 

449
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,060
Oh, Kim Gyu Ri!

450
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:19,060
Thanks!

451
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:21,320
 She's really smart. 

452
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:25,610
 She asked a lot of questions in place of her mother, so she had me sweating answering her. 

453
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:29,340
 Anyway, I took care of the auction and Gyu Ri's father's hospital bill. 

454
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,260
What should I do?

455
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:35,000
I'll pay you back later. Many times over.

456
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,010
Enough of that. Aren't you paying attention to class?

457
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:39,530
It's almost midterms.

458
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:41,550
Oh, that's right!

459
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:44,680
I'll have to start living at the library starting today.

460
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,480
- You'll help, right? 
 - Of course.

461
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,020
I will help you.

462
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,740
You are Kim Gyu Ri, right?

463
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:50,600
Who are...?

464
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,920
Me? I'm the student rep, Park Seung Won.

465
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:56,950
- I've been dying to meet you. Miss Perfect Score and first place on the college entrance exams. 
 - Oh...

466
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:57,730
Really?

467
00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:02,800
Oh right. When it comes to school news and miscellaneous announcements, you'll want to hear them from Seung Won.

468
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,370
He's the most hard-working student rep in our major.

469
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:07,610
It's all true.

470
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:09,570
Although his introduction was very modest,

471
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:13,920
the more you get to know me, the more you'll realize how meaningful my work is.

472
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,810
Oh, I see.

473
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,820
I'll look forward to working with you.

474
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,160
Sure. Nice to meet you.

475
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,380
Seung Won!

476
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,520
Really?!

477
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,020
Do you spend all day waiting for the perfect moment to jump in?

478
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:32,550
You have to put in the effort, you bastard.

479
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,010
Ah, seriously!

480
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:46,410
Who's this? I only had a nap, and suddenly there's a new face?

481
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:49,330
I'm a freshman but today is the first day I've come to school.

482
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:53,330
Why are you so polite? We are the same, freshmen.

483
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:56,490
Oh, I have a quiet personality.

484
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:58,890
Don't be polite, and don't be modest.

485
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:00,840
We're all friends with Hui Wu.

486
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,760
I'm Lee Min Su. You can speak informally, friend.

487
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,170
No,  thanks.  I'll speak formally.

488
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:09,070
W-Why?

489
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:11,170
I’ll feel comfortable that way, sir.

490
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:14,020
She's even speaking with honorifics. That's going too far.

491
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:16,410
Why are you playing around?

492
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:19,760
I'm Kim Gyu Ri. Accept my bow.

493
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,560
Stop! Stop! I can't accept that.

494
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,440
Why aren't there any laid-back people here? Seriously.

495
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,930
So you do know how to joke around!

496
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:28,960
It's not a joke!

497
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:32,040
Please accept my bow!

498
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:35,050
Wh-What? What's the matter with you? Don't bow to me.

499
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:38,130
You're making me bow too. Damn it.

500
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:41,500
You know mutual bows are only done by couples marrying each other.

501
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,970
How long has it been since I've been tutoring you?

502
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,390
What? Why? What is it? Is there a problem?  I tried really hard!

503
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:53,220
No, your head...

504
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,510
wasn't totally made of rocks after all!

505
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:58,590
Watch your tongue. You're dead meat.

506
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:01,000
Amazing! Good job!

507
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,260
- Really? 
 - Yes!

508
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:07,040
At this level, you can aim for universities in the Seoul metropolitan area.

509
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,570
That's a given.

510
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:11,100
I'm going to go to Hankuk University.

511
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,730
What? Really?

512
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:14,600
Well... I know it's a long shot.

513
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:18,370
No. You have the basics down, so you catch on really fast.

514
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:22,100
If you just nail the concepts, you can even get into Hankuk University

515
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,390
I'm your proof here.

516
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:25,920
- Really?
 - Yes.

517
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,830
I did it, so you can do it too.

518
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:31,800
Yes, teacher.

519
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,340
 Dad:  Critical announcement: Dinner time tonight. 

520
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,360
What's the critical announcement?

521
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,240
- First, pour me a drink. 
 - Yes.

522
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:54,580
You must have something to celebrate.

523
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:58,560
More, more, more, more!

524
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:08,690
Your mom and I have decided to open a steamed chicken restaurant!

525
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:10,720
What? So suddenly.

526
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,080
We signed a contract for the store today!

527
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:18,430
When everyone else is going for fried chicken, your old man will open Red Ocean which will only sell steamed chicken.

528
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:22,740
I want to let people know that fried chicken isn't the only way to enjoy it.

529
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:26,300
When we open, bring all your friends! I'll give them an 80% discount!

530
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,860
- What? 
 - Fifty percent discount!

531
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:30,620
- You're crazy! 
- Four percent discount!

532
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:35,580
- There isn't a discount. I'll just give you something complimentary. 
 - Okay.

533
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:39,480
We are the only house that had delicious steamed chicken!

534
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,550
I support your decision.

535
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:44,420
- Here! Take this. 
 - Yes!

536
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:45,880
Steamed chicken!

537
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,560
What? Give me one.

538
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,610
Sorry!

539
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:52,650
There. Steamed chicken!

540
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,370
I'm going to brag to my mom about my grades.

541
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:07,420
I was told to escort you.

542
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:13,980
- Take it. 
 - What is it?

543
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:17,720
Your tuition. Your mom asked me a favor.

544
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,580
Take it.

545
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:24,720
I heard you're studying hard. Since you're smart like me, you'll get accepted somewhere.

546
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,710
Use the remaining money to buy clothes when you get accepted.

547
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:30,940
What are you gawking at? Say yes and take the money.

548
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:32,590
Yes.

549
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:37,620
You aren't hanging around with gangsters anymore, right?

550
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:41,000
Make sure I never have to interfere like that again.

551
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,350
Don't be an insolent child that blocks her parent's way.

552
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,280
Are you here to beg my father again?

553
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:15,990
- What? 
 - Why are you being so pathetic?

554
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:19,110
Do you want to know how to make easy money?

555
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:21,340
Like your mom?

556
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:25,520
Stay out of my sight.

557
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:29,420
It's disgusting to see you come to my house to beg.

558
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:31,240
You guys are like parasites.

559
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:36,000
Then you should have given me more pills to keep the parasites out.

560
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,790
What?!

561
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:43,100
Because I am low born, it's my job to skin animals like you.

562
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:46,020
How about it?  Should I skin you too?

563
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:49,950
Kim Han Mi.

564
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:51,900
Born how?

565
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:56,750
Don't go around saying things like that.

566
00:44:56,750 --> 00:45:01,390
Apologize. Apologize right now.

567
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:07,940
I'm sorry.

568
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:26,930
 Kim Hui Wu. 

569
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:29,430
 Come quickly. 

570
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:54,290
Hey, Kim Han Mi.

571
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,510
My teacher is here.

572
00:45:57,510 --> 00:46:01,980
Why are you drinking all by yourself?

573
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:06,660
Ajumma, another glass, please.

574
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:09,130
Chicken feet too!

575
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:22,980
I'm paying today, so eat as much as you want!

576
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:26,890
Today I...

577
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:34,320
have a crap-ton of money.

578
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:38,320
What's with that money?  Don't tell me you're...!

579
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:42,280
I didn't steal it!

580
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,590
Or did I?

581
00:46:44,590 --> 00:46:48,310
From that bastard's perspective, I guess I did steal it.

582
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:54,020
Or... did I beg for it?

583
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:57,400
What do you mean that bastard?

584
00:46:58,670 --> 00:47:01,770
You saw him at the police station.

585
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:06,420
Our Deputy Chief Prosecutor.

586
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:11,090
I'm that person's bastard child.

587
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:15,450
 I was anticipating this,  but I was right. 

588
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:23,010
I... didn't want to accept that money.

589
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:27,640
I really didn't want to.

590
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,710
I don't understand this.

591
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:49,100
Which one?

592
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:54,050
This one. The criminal code on rape. This part.

593
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:56,970
Oh, special rape?

594
00:47:56,970 --> 00:47:59,260
Okay, so, special rape.

595
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:04,070
In special rape, it doesn't matter whether the perpetrator can kill or not.

596
00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:07,570
As long as there's a threat to the victim, it counts as special rape.

597
00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:09,960
That's difficult.

598
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:14,810
Stay calm.  I won't kill you. Follow me quietly.

599
00:48:14,810 --> 00:48:16,130
You surprised me.

600
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:18,340
I told you to follow me.

601
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:19,720
Ok, cut! That's enough!

602
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,030
Was that okay, director?

603
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:23,920
That was very good Sunbaenim!

604
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,120
So, how did you feel just now? Scared?

605
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:28,550
A little at first.

606
00:48:28,550 --> 00:48:33,450
So, even something like a pen which usually isn't considered a weapon

607
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:37,550
If the threatened person feels like they will die or be hurt, it is special rape—

608
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:39,610
Then it's special rape.

609
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:43,830
Additionally, when it comes to special rape, the evidence is particularly important.

610
00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:45,150
Thank you.

611
00:48:45,150 --> 00:48:46,810
Don't hesitate to ask for more!

612
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:49,140
But, wasn't my acting really good?

613
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:52,840
What do you think Hui Wu? I'm thinking about trying out for a theater major this time!

614
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:56,600
Let me try again with my theater voice.

615
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:00,120
- Wasn't it funny? 
 - Nope.

616
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:02,860
It's rare in Korea to have such a unique mask as I have.

617
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:07,990
Yes, Seonbaenim. Why don't you take that unique rare mask and quietly disappear?

618
00:49:09,310 --> 00:49:11,290
You're so mean, friend.

619
00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:13,560
You're that friend.

620
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:17,530
Gyu Ri, shall I explain armed robbery to you this time?

621
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:18,810
No thank you.

622
00:49:18,810 --> 00:49:20,730
Why are you so serious?

623
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:22,930
Because it's the truth.

624
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:27,170
- I see! 
 - Hui Wu!

625
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:29,700
Ah, you scared me!

626
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,370
- One moment. 
 - Why?

627
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:37,990
Did you do anything to upset Sunbae Kang Jin?

628
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:41,690
He's not the kind of sunbae to call people in individually.

629
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:44,110
Just apologize for everything.

630
00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:47,200
If possible, I'll stand by your side.

631
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,950
I'm the student representative of our department.

632
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:53,640
  Law School Student Council Room  

633
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,550
Come on in.

634
00:49:57,910 --> 00:49:59,630
Oh!

635
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:02,000
RIght. You're here.

636
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,920
Welcome, Kim Hui Wu!

637
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,530
You can leave now.

638
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:09,390
- Sorry? 
- You did your job so you can leave now.

639
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:12,670
Okay.

640
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,690
Sit! Sit comfortably!

641
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:22,630
Yes, thank you.

642
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:34,730
The professors praise you a lot.

643
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:35,670
Ah, no.

644
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:38,210
There's no need to be humble.

645
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:41,130
Everybody here is smart.

646
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:44,210
But everyone says that you're special.

647
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:48,390
- So I want you to join the student council. 
 - Pardon?

648
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:52,090
You know our alumni paved the way for the entire legal profession.

649
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:56,180
And among those, those from the student council have the fastest way up.

650
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:57,550
Yes.

651
00:50:57,550 --> 00:51:00,440
But, I don't know if I'll be able to do well.

652
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:03,390
This smart boy is also cautious.

653
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:05,800
I really like you.

654
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:11,010
Let's go outside. We can't make our Sunbaenim wait for us.

655
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:17,980
The guest is coming in!

656
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:26,880
- Thank you for coming, Sunbaenim. 
 - Yeah.

657
00:51:30,430 --> 00:51:33,430
Hello, Sunbaenim. I'm Kim Hui Wu, a freshman.

658
00:51:33,430 --> 00:51:35,890
Is that so? Have a seat.

659
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:41,760
- Your first impression isn't bad. 
 -Thank you, sir.

660
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,570
You heard about our club from Kang Gin?

661
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:47,370
Sorry? Club?

662
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:48,600
Ah, I haven't told him yet.

663
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,930
I thought that it would be good if you told him directly.

664
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:53,050
Really?

665
00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:54,860
- Kim Hui Wu. 
 - Yes!

666
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:59,250
We have decided to accept you as a member of our secret law club.

667
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:00,950
Secret club?

668
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:05,760
Yes. Our secret club isn't even known inside our law department at Hanguk University.

669
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,410
But it's a private organization that has existed for a long time.

670
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:12,630
You know that our major's alumni have a strong bond, right?

671
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:14,130
Oh yes. Of course.

672
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:18,970
People say it favors school connections, but our secret club is beyond that.

673
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:21,980
Why would we look for bright juniors from school?

674
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:27,920
A talented person who shoots up from the bottom is always a threat to the person above.

675
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,350
But what if we find talented people first

676
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:33,270
and let them walk on the solid path that we've built?

677
00:52:33,270 --> 00:52:38,390
Brilliant seniors sit in key positions, help juniors build good careers,

678
00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:43,170
and keep those positions until the juniors come up, then hand them down to them.

679
00:52:43,170 --> 00:52:49,540
Also, juniors follow behind their seniors and keep watch to make sure other people don't move up.

680
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:51,830
What do you think?

681
00:52:51,830 --> 00:52:54,360
Ah, yes!

682
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:57,970
There isn't a reason not to accept, am I right?

683
00:52:57,970 --> 00:53:01,050
This is how we all can benefit together.

684
00:53:01,050 --> 00:53:02,830
Here.

685
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:12,770
Until now, the Minister of Justice, Public Prosecutor General, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and so on.

686
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:17,570
Everybody who went up to the very top is from our club.

687
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:21,130
That's all. I explained it very simply.

688
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:23,600
- I bet you understood. 
 - Wow!

689
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:27,170
You explained it so it was very easy to understand. Thank you, sir.

690
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:31,000
- How is it? Doesn't it make your heart pound from excitement? 
 - Yes.

691
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,280
This is like a national archery team.

692
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:40,080
It's harder to become a national team member than to get an Olympic medal.

693
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,150
That's a perfect way to put it.

694
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:43,960
Thank you.

695
00:53:45,490 --> 00:53:49,460
Sunbaenim! Thank you so much for thinking of me in a good way.

696
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:52,830
I'll do my best so that I won't let your expectations down.

697
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:56,630
I'll work myself to the utmost!

698
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:59,390
Look at him!

699
00:53:59,390 --> 00:54:02,230
- I like your personality. 
 - Thank you so much.

700
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:05,100
Please allow me to pour you a glass on that note.

701
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:06,910
Yes.

702
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,130
Go for it.

703
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:10,510
Thank you for letting me into the club.

704
00:54:10,510 --> 00:54:12,100
It's nice!

705
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:14,880
Okay! Today's a good day.

706
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,730
- Thank you, sir! 
 - Yes.

707
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:18,420
- Let's work together well. 
 - Yes, sir!

708
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:20,420
Cheers!

709
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:29,470
I'm so happy and honored to be with all of you, Sunbaenim.

710
00:54:29,470 --> 00:54:31,420
This boy.

711
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:35,990
Choi Kang Jin, you found a real good one this time.

712
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:39,330
I have a good eye for people, Sunbaenim!

713
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:42,370
That's why you have me as your senior.

714
00:54:42,370 --> 00:54:45,020
By the way, since I became a prosecutor,

715
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:49,520
so many people around have wanted to meet me. It's exhausting.

716
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,490
I have no doubt. You are working so hard.

717
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:57,810
Hey, this is a secret. But do you guys know what DH Money is?

718
00:54:57,810 --> 00:54:59,650
DH Money?

719
00:54:59,650 --> 00:55:03,410
  Park Dae Ho, the one who manages Jo Tae Seop's fund, is the CEO of that place.  

720
00:55:03,410 --> 00:55:04,830
As a new business from DH Money, where is that?

721
00:55:04,830 --> 00:55:08,570
The end of Songpa-gu, where it's meeting Gyeonggi-do. They are redeveloping that area.

722
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:11,650
  That's where most of the elder's real estate is located.  

723
00:55:11,650 --> 00:55:12,510
  As I expected ...  

724
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:16,150
They have already set the target.

725
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:20,140
There's someone who has the most houses and land in that area.

726
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:24,220
I heard that he's the God of auctions. His name is Wu Yong Su.

727
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:26,320
 And they are going to get rid of him first. 

728
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:30,010
If you get rid of him and go into redevelopment,

729
00:55:30,010 --> 00:55:34,540
in the blink of an eye, you'll have hundreds of billions of won in your hand.

730
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:38,420
  - I have to stop this.   
 - Isn't this crazy?

731
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:58,110
I'm sorry, so sorry.

732
00:55:58,110 --> 00:56:02,250
I don't have much time left until I'll be with you, my love.

733
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:04,460
I'll see you then.

734
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:22,150
Oh, it's you, boy. What are you doing calling me in the middle of the night?

735
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:23,720
What did you say? 
  Coal BBQ 

736
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:26,230
Sell all of my property?

737
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:29,550
Yes, and as soon as possible as well.

738
00:56:29,550 --> 00:56:30,850
Why?

739
00:56:30,850 --> 00:56:33,840
I heard from a school sunbae currently working as a prosecutor

740
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:37,050
that DH Money is eyeing your land and buildings.

741
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:38,790
Why my property?

742
00:56:38,790 --> 00:56:43,450
Apparently, there's a redevelopment plan for that area as you expected.

743
00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:48,150
That's true, I wasn't wrong much in the past.

744
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:54,250
I think there's a political force behind DH Money.

745
00:56:56,590 --> 00:57:01,030
Those bastards. I see what they're doing,

746
00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:03,050
but do you think it will be easy?

747
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:06,560
When you bought the realty, you sought a loan, yes?

748
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:07,720
Yes, I did.

749
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:11,160
What if the interest rate on your loan were to be raised to the max?

750
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:13,560
To a point where you couldn't even handle it.

751
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:18,100
And if you couldn't repay it, it would go to auction right away.

752
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:21,730
They would buy anything that fell into auction at a cheap price.

753
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:24,570
In the end, it would bankrupt you.

754
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:26,920
My bank is Bando bank.

755
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:29,190
It's not related to DH Money in any way.

756
00:57:29,190 --> 00:57:32,580
You know that the banks are in the process of merging.

757
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:37,810
Taking over that single Bando bank would be a piece of cake for DH Money, which has Japanese funds.

758
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:41,510
Also, there's a political force watching their back.

759
00:57:41,510 --> 00:57:44,010
All of it would be taken care of as if it were totally legal.

760
00:57:44,010 --> 00:57:47,650
Just to get a few pieces of real estate that an old man has...

761
00:57:47,650 --> 00:57:51,420
Because they know the value of that land.

762
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,190
Fine.

763
00:57:55,190 --> 00:57:58,720
Okay. I can see it clearly.

764
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:07,700
You're saying I need to sell it all right away, right?

765
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:09,040
Yes.

766
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:12,680
And when you transfer your registrations, you have to sell all of them at the same time.

767
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:13,620
Why is that?

768
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:19,430
Now that they're targeting it, they will be watching the movement of your assets.

769
00:58:19,430 --> 00:58:23,510
If they find out that you're in process of selling...

770
00:58:23,510 --> 00:58:25,810
You're saying they won't just sit back?

771
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:27,620
Yes.

772
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:30,520
We don't know what they'd do.

773
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:33,550
Since DH Money is a company that grew by loan sharking.

774
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:36,790
Are you saying they might kidnap me or something?

775
00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:41,520
They might lock you up so you can't pay back the loan.

776
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:45,490
You managed to save one person's life...

777
00:58:45,490 --> 00:58:47,540
It's all thanks to you.

778
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:51,740
This time, did you come to save my life?

779
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:16,740
 Through property speculation including redevelopment, 

780
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:18,970
 Jo Tae Seop earned a huge profit in his past life. 

781
00:59:18,970 --> 00:59:23,190
 He used the financial sector to steal people's assets, 

782
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:27,630
 and in that process, several properties suffered heavy losses. 

783
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:34,590
 The body of a man in his seventies 

784
00:59:34,590 --> 00:59:37,880
 found by a Han River Police officer searching for fallen victims early this morning, 

785
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:41,710
 was identified as Wu Yong Su, who had the title of the God of Bidding. 

786
00:59:41,710 --> 00:59:48,050
 The God of Bidding Wu Young Su is an example of one of those people who died a pitiful death after going bankrupt 

787
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:50,730
  due to the pressure from finance corporations to collect on loans. 

788
00:59:52,670 --> 00:59:55,920
 I will protect him.  

789
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:01,700
 Always Green Realty 

790
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:04,300
 Realty Sale Contract 

791
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:05,900
Are you really selling all of it?

792
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:09,100
I'm going to register them all at once on the same day.

793
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:10,880
Okay.

794
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:13,150
Are you sure you won't regret it?

795
01:00:13,150 --> 01:00:17,410
I put the rest of the money in Nara bank instead of Bando bank.

796
01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:19,440
Really...

797
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:22,300
You're going to regret it.

798
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:28,890
 Always Green Realty 

799
01:00:34,670 --> 01:00:40,700
 I must be suffering like this to go by your side. 

800
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:48,800
DH Money succeeded in taking over the Bando bank.

801
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:52,570
Yes. DH Money and Bando bank have unified,

802
01:00:52,570 --> 01:00:56,080
providing them the stepping stone to becoming the number one finance corporation in Korea.

803
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:57,930
We will always be with the people.

804
01:00:57,930 --> 01:01:00,830
and take the lead in the welfare of the people.

805
01:01:00,830 --> 01:01:02,880
What did you say, you bastard?

806
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:05,730
Are you seriously telling me all the properties were sold in one day!?

807
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:07,990
How can you let some random old man get away like this!?

808
01:01:07,990 --> 01:01:08,930
I'm sorry.

809
01:01:08,930 --> 01:01:11,240
Sorry?

810
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:14,810
Sorry? Didn't I tell you to keep a close eye on him?

811
01:01:14,810 --> 01:01:18,370
There weren't any strange movements, so I didn't really take action.

812
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:22,530
So, that's why you let one hundred billion won disappear into thin air?

813
01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:28,560
We finally got Bando bank and had a plan ready, and now our target is gone, you little shits!

814
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:34,180
 Department Head Han 

815
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:38,240
I've committed a serious error.

816
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:42,600
That old fox Wu Yong Su moved faster than we thought—

817
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:50,310
It's okay.

818
01:01:50,310 --> 01:01:54,320
As people live, they make mistakes in life.

819
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:57,640
Think of this as a mirror for the future and don't make mistakes anymore.

820
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:00,480
This won't happen again. I'm so sorry.

821
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:03,820
It's okay, that's enough. Get up.

822
01:02:06,830 --> 01:02:11,870
It's just that the houses now belong to multiple people instead of one.

823
01:02:11,870 --> 01:02:15,130
Nothing's changed. Am I right?

824
01:02:15,130 --> 01:02:17,890
Yes, I won't mess up next time.

825
01:02:17,890 --> 01:02:20,440
You can go now.

826
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:22,050
Yes.

827
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:28,090
Are you forgiving President Park?

828
01:02:28,090 --> 01:02:32,920
One cannot allow himself to get tunnel vision when undertaking a big task.

829
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:35,580
Because you never know what variable might interfere.

830
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:38,500
You have to look far and wide.

831
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:43,400
If you bet one hundred billion and earn a trillion, it's a profit.

832
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,860
I was shortsighted.

833
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:48,650
Department Head Han, thank you for the data that you got from the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport.

834
01:02:48,650 --> 01:02:50,500
Yes.

835
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:55,660
A good staff member moves before suspicion, like Department Head Han.

836
01:02:55,660 --> 01:02:59,950
They used to say that the country will go into ruin if a politician knows money,

837
01:02:59,950 --> 01:03:04,350
but nowadays, without knowing money, you can't be a leader.

838
01:03:04,350 --> 01:03:07,780
Look at America. They earn money printing dollars.

839
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:12,320
If you don't know the economy, you can't have power.

840
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:15,500
It's a time where money is power.

841
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,850
I'll keep that in mind.

842
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,860
Wu Yong Su...

843
01:03:26,030 --> 01:03:29,200
Was he just lucky?

844
01:03:31,250 --> 01:03:32,650
Elder.

845
01:03:32,650 --> 01:03:34,040
Don't worry about it.

846
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:37,950
Today, I'm going to pour my own drinks.

847
01:03:37,950 --> 01:03:39,370
Okay.

848
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:46,620
Today is my birthday.

849
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:52,080
Before I die, I figured I'd celebrate my birthday for once instead of working.

850
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:57,350
What do you think of it here? This is a place that I like.

851
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:03,220
It's my town, but it looks cool from here.

852
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:07,310
All those houses you can see will become apartments.

853
01:04:07,310 --> 01:04:12,110
And this mountain will become a luxury villa area.

854
01:04:12,110 --> 01:04:14,040
 Yes, that's what it will become. 

855
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:16,870
You look like you already knew that.

856
01:04:16,870 --> 01:04:18,570
Excuse me?

857
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:21,700
No.

858
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:26,240
As if. You were born with a talent for seeing the future.

859
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:28,730
You're also smart.

860
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:32,950
I pray you use your talent in a good way.

861
01:04:35,430 --> 01:04:38,270
Here take it, I liquidated everything.

862
01:04:38,270 --> 01:04:39,670
What is this?

863
01:04:39,670 --> 01:04:43,420
You take care of this from now on.

864
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:45,320
 Wu Yong Su 
 Savings Account 

865
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:50,900
  ₩101,330,000,000 

866
01:04:50,910 --> 01:04:51,820
Sir...

867
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:54,190
Didn't you protect this money with your wits?

868
01:04:54,190 --> 01:04:56,760
I'm reinvesting it in you.

869
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:59,370
- But... 
 - The fact that we met,

870
01:04:59,370 --> 01:05:04,390
and that I protected my money thanks to you... It all seems like the heavens willed it.

871
01:05:04,390 --> 01:05:09,530
Use it as you wish and rule the world like you said you wanted to.

872
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:13,800
Money does its job when it goes to a person who needs it.

873
01:05:14,930 --> 01:05:16,130
Have a glass.

874
01:05:16,130 --> 01:05:17,790
Yes.

875
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:38,320
The auction house is almost like a composite art piece.

876
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:43,010
Forecasting the future and calculating profits through regional analysis,

877
01:05:43,010 --> 01:05:45,850
avoiding losses through the use of legalities,

878
01:05:45,850 --> 01:05:49,350
the thrill of winning a bid at court,

879
01:05:49,350 --> 01:05:52,190
and even playing mind games with the residents.

880
01:05:52,190 --> 01:05:56,490
You have to move after planning and seeing the big picture.

881
01:05:56,490 --> 01:06:00,150
Instead of investing aggressively in a building with high risk,

882
01:06:00,150 --> 01:06:04,260
lower the risk by investing in a safe asset.

883
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:08,850
Those are the rules of auctioning that I've kept until now.

884
01:06:08,850 --> 01:06:14,340
Learn to see the future value and find the lowest risk assets.

885
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:15,550
That's what you mean, right?

886
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:16,920
Exactly.

887
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:21,210
Don't only focus on one thing, but look at the big picture.

888
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:23,940
What's the redevelopment speed around there,

889
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:27,800
what do people want and where do they gather...

890
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:34,040
My wife died when I was scouting out the whole country because I was crazy about land.

891
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:36,490
She kept saying her stomach hurt,

892
01:06:36,490 --> 01:06:41,410
but I thought she'd get better after a while, so I just got her some digestive medicine.

893
01:06:41,410 --> 01:06:43,960
I regret that.

894
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:47,920
She could've lived if I took her to the hospital sooner.

895
01:06:53,730 --> 01:06:58,280
I have one thing that worries me when I see you.

896
01:06:58,280 --> 01:06:59,590
Sir?

897
01:06:59,590 --> 01:07:05,080
When I first saw you, it felt like looking into my own eyes when I was younger.

898
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:10,200
Eyes that are crazed about something. Don't get too crazy about it.

899
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:13,010
If you do, you'll lose yourself.

900
01:07:19,330 --> 01:07:22,640
Let me pour you one, sir.

901
01:07:24,630 --> 01:07:27,220
Happy birthday, sir.

902
01:07:53,250 --> 01:07:57,400
 The fact that we met, and that I protected my money thanks to you... 

903
01:07:57,400 --> 01:08:00,450
 It all seems like the heavens willed it. 

904
01:08:00,450 --> 01:08:03,900
The heavens willed it...

905
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:06,390
No, no.

906
01:08:06,390 --> 01:08:08,230
Here he comes again.

907
01:08:08,230 --> 01:08:09,630
That person came to our school.

908
01:08:09,630 --> 01:08:11,210
Do they really want to do that?

909
01:08:11,210 --> 01:08:12,500
April, 8th. April, 8th.

910
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:13,830
What is it?

911
01:08:13,830 --> 01:08:18,120
 Young people, set a goal and achieve it! 

912
01:08:19,930 --> 01:08:23,800
Young people, set a goal?

913
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:26,480
That's today.

914
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:27,460
Should we go see it?

915
01:08:27,460 --> 01:08:28,990
Hmm?

916
01:08:29,830 --> 01:08:31,520
Shall we go, Sunbaenim?

917
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:33,660
Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop is a graduate from our department.

918
01:08:33,660 --> 01:08:35,140
I wouldn't go even if they paid me to.

919
01:08:35,140 --> 01:08:37,150
- Me neither.  
 - You scared me.

920
01:08:37,150 --> 01:08:40,950
Kim Hui Ah from the engineering department. 'Saved'!

921
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:42,760
I don't like that man, Jo Tae Seop.

922
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:44,650
Right?

923
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:49,440
Let's go and check it out. He supposedly has some helpful things to say.

924
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:50,600
We should be thankful.

925
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:53,200
Should we?

926
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:56,610
Are you going?

927
01:09:01,740 --> 01:09:04,230
How about some day drinking?

928
01:09:04,230 --> 01:09:07,090
How did you know today's my day off from my part-time job?

929
01:09:07,090 --> 01:09:09,040
You make a proposal I can't refuse.

930
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:12,030
- Let's go. 
  - You have money, right?

931
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:16,910
 Young people set a goal and achieve it! 

932
01:09:21,250 --> 01:09:23,500
- Here? 
 - Yes.

933
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:27,720
It's a full house.

934
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:31,980
He's the only assemblyman in Korea people don't talk badly about.

935
01:09:33,130 --> 01:09:35,190
He is here! Wow!

936
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:48,710
 It's been a while, Jo Tae Seop 

937
01:09:48,710 --> 01:09:53,400
 Let's see what kind of nonsense he'll spout.

940
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:16,370
 When you get closer to Jo Tae Seop, you might see me again.

01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:35,110
♫  Who knows, how will it go?  ♫

945
01:10:38,290 --> 01:10:42,550
♫  Hiding in black and white  ♫

946
01:10:42,550 --> 01:10:45,940
♫  We are here to find the truth  ♫

947
01:10:45,940 --> 01:10:51,950
♫  Give up, I warn you so  ♫

948
01:10:53,720 --> 01:11:01,150
♫  Who would ever find out who you really are? Hm  ♫

949
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:03,350
♫  You'll never know  ♫

950
01:11:03,350 --> 01:11:06,440
 Again My Life 

951
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:09,870
 Jo Tae Seop wouldn't just keep a random person by his side. 

952
01:11:09,870 --> 01:11:13,440
 Why don't you take this program? 

953
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:14,620
 Haha Talk? 

954
01:11:14,620 --> 01:11:18,270
 This time, I'll carry out my plans for you a little more quickly. 

955
01:11:18,270 --> 01:11:21,740
 Who's meddling in all this? Who? 

956
01:11:21,740 --> 01:11:25,670
 The only way to fight with them right now is head on. 

957
01:11:25,670 --> 01:11:28,040
 I like the phrase "Too Big To Fail."  

958
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:30,490
 Work with me. 

959
01:11:30,490 --> 01:11:32,610
 I remember... 

960
01:11:32,610 --> 01:11:34,430
 who you are. 

961
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:42,910
