00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:07,040


2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,880
 Lee Joon Gi 

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,710
 Lee Kyung Young 

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,420
 Kim Ji Eun 

5
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:35,070
 Again My Life 

6
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,320
- Sir! 
- Just a comment, please!

7
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,430
 I brought the powerful Jo Tae Seop here 

8
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,590
to show that you're nothing but a piece of garbage.

9
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:48,630
I am looking forward to seeing what card you will use.

10
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,200
 I have done the job. 

11
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,970
 I will take care of it as instructed. 

12
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:04,480
 If you have another life, will you use it to catch Jo Tae Seop again? 

13
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,280
 Promise me. 

14
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,410
 Can you show him hell? 

15
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:15,920
 My life began again to catch that person. 

16
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,930
Hey!

17
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,970
Always the same tactics...

18
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,050
It's old now. It's boring.

19
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,290
Who are you?

20
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,410
Is that important right now?

21
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:48,490
I asked who you are.

22
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:51,850
Someone who knows you too well.

23
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,830
Have we met before?

24
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,190
Yes.

25
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,150
And...

26
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,670
I died at your hands.

27
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,280
You have the wrong person.

28
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,880
I have never failed before.

29
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,050
You're right. You didn't fail.

30
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:14,280
I just resurrected like a miracle.

31
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,670
I was so angry at how unfair it was

32
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,240
that I even managed to avoid death.

33
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,450
Sounds interesting.

34
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:25,080
Then try to avoid it this time, too.

35
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,980
Are you stupid?

36
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,290
I wouldn't have interfered then, you bastard!

37
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:56,490
♫  Hey, you're so cold. That evil leer  ♫

38
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:00,260
♫  You clearly intend something nasty  ♫

39
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:03,620
♫  Lie lie lie gradually it will come out  ♫

40
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:07,550
♫  Standing up, Standing up, Standing up  ♫

41
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:12,160
♫  What kind of gang came at me?  ♫

42
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,330
 I can't lose twice. 

43
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,330
♫  wait just for me  ♫

44
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,240
♫  Even if you fool everyone else  ♫

45
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,390
 I can see it now. 

46
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:22,960
 Got it. 

47
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,130
 I think I can do this. 

48
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,270
 As expected, he is strong. 

49
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:35,280
Do you work out?

50
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,080
A little.

51
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:43,450
To be honest, I'm shocked. This is the first time I've been so flustered.

52
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,040
Right?

53
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,350
I feel like I have fought with you hundreds of times.

54
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,180
You will soon be more shocked.

55
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,640
A fight is different from a competition.

56
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,880
You talk too much.

57
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,330
Come on then.

58
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,010
You cowardly bastard. That's cheating.

59
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:17,940
I already told you that a fight is different from a competition.

60
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,840
Fine.

61
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,430
I will give you a proper lesson today.

62
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,020
You lucked out.

63
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:42,720
Hyeong Hui Wu. Hyeong Hui Wu! Are you all right?

64
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,550
That black-suited scumbag!

65
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,000
What about Seung Hyeok?

66
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,550
Prosecutor Gu?

67
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,140
Seung Hyeok!

68
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,910
Prosecutor Gu!

69
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,490
Seung Hyeok!

70
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,170
- Are you alright? 
 - Yeah, I am.

71
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,930
Sang Man, we should rush to the hospital.

72
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,520
Okay, Hyeong. I'll go bring the car.

73
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,840
Okay.

74
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:10,090
- Hey, can you stand up? 
 - Yeah.

75
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,320
Let's go.

76
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,940
Try some of this.

77
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,150
 Episode 13 

78
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,970
Are you hurting anywhere else?

79
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,870
No, I am alright.

80
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,930
Punk...

81
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,610
Hey, Gu Seung Hyeok.

82
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,370
Seonbae.

83
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:40,180
Are you alright?

84
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:44,030
Thank God. Look at his face. It's a mess.

85
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,160
A mess?

86
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,110
It's just a figure of speech.

87
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:51,780
But, only one rib is fractured. Everything else is fine.

88
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:57,010
I might not be able to fight well, but I'm resilient.

89
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,620
What kind of bastard did this to a prosecutor?

90
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,950
You were lucky today.

91
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,980
That's right. He wasn't a petty gangster.

92
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:12,770
While I was getting beaten by him, I really thought I could die.

93
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,610
I'll ask the police to cooperate.

94
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:19,360
Let's check out the CCTV immediately and identify the—

95
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,070
Wait.

96
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:27,390
Could the two of you step out for a moment?

97
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,520
Sure.

98
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,730
What do you want to say?

99
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:45,580
Are you asking us to back down?

100
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,930
Yes.

101
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:50,430
Gyu Ri, you go to the District Prosecutor's Office and release Kim Yeong Il immediately.

102
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:54,020
From this moment on, you both stay away from the JQ Construction case.

103
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,320
- Hey, Kim Hui Wu! 
 - What are you saying?

104
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,910
You want us to stop because of a thug?

105
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:01,940
Yeah. It would be even better to say you stopped because you were scared.

106
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,190
- Hey! 
 - Hey!

107
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,390
Kim Gyu Ri. Gu Seung Hyeok.

108
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:11,390
You guys trust me and back off.

109
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,000
I promise I will finish off this case.

110
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,680
Do me the favor.

111
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,190
Please?

112
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:37,580
 Again My Life 

113
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:45,420
I am looking forward to the prosecution you will build.

114
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:49,250
I will never forget this favor.

115
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,190
But sir,

116
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,600
I am really sorry,

117
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,620
but I want to ask you something.

118
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,680
The one who told you about the Bando Bank investigation,

119
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,200
was it Kim Hui Wu?

120
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,220
Kim Hui Wu ...

121
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:11,170
He is a capable prosecutor. He is quick-witted and skilled.

122
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:13,980
Unlike others of his age, he has good judgment skills.

123
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,390
I guess that's why you got it wrong.

124
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:22,100
Did you think I wouldn't be able to see through him?

125
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:28,780
I must have looked lax.

126
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:35,010
If you are in my position, you see a lot. You also might hear a lot.

127
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,400
Your thoughts and actions are no exception.

128
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,450
I am sorry.

129
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,320
That's alright.

130
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,820
- Do well from now on. 
 - Yes, sir.

131
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,080
 Sir. 

132
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,540
Yes.

133
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:57,830
- Then I will get going now. 
 - All right.

134
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:06,110
What's the matter?

135
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:09,200
- He failed. 
 - Failed?

136
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,230
Someone intervened, and the police showed up.

137
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,570
We are checking all the CCTV from around that area.

138
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:26,380
Sir, Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu wants to meet with you right now.

139
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:29,230
- Kim Hui Wu? 
 -  Yes. 

140
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:33,330
- Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu is here. 
 - Come in.

141
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,720
I am sorry for coming so late at night.

142
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,280
- Is there a problem? 
 - Yes.

143
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,170
What is it?

144
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:00,010
I had a fight.

145
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:02,900
- Fight? 
 - Yes.

146
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:07,270
The Prosecutor who arrested JQ Construction's Managing Director Kim Yeong Il is my colleague.

147
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:11,470
When I went to convince him to drop the case, I met an unidentified assailant.

148
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,300
- Assailant? 
 -  Yes. 

149
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:18,590
So you fought that assailant?

150
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,370
Yes, sir.

151
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,850
Did you manage to convince your colleague?

152
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,430
Yes. I'll have Kim Yeong Il released by the end of the night.

153
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:31,480
Both prosecutors have decided to stay out of this case too.

154
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,910
Is that why you came to see me?

155
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,440
No.

156
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,940
I came to hear your opinion.

157
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,110
My opinion?

158
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:48,790
Yes. I was taught that a prosecutor should always question everything.

159
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,580
And?

160
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,880
It's an assault case involving a prosecutor.

161
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,440
Obviously, I'm going to go after that assailant from this point on.

162
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,960
But, all of a sudden a thought crossed my mind.

163
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,670
That perhaps the assailant

164
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:09,000
could be one of your people.

165
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:14,580
What?

166
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,310
I apologize if I'm mistaken.

167
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:20,070
But, I wanted to make sure

168
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:23,140
and receive instructions before taking action.

169
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,390
Whether I can go after that assailant,

170
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:30,550
or if I should just cover it up.

171
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:34,380
I'll do as you say.

172
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,160
Don't go after him.

173
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:41,400
Can I take this to mean that he is one of your people?

174
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:46,630
You're still young.

175
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:50,640
It just means that I'll take care of him myself. Understand?

176
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:57,650
I understand. I will follow your instructions.

177
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:01,860
You seem very tired. Go home and rest.

178
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,550
Yes, sir.

179
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:11,060
Kim Seok Hun will be the next prosecutor general.

180
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:26,700
Will you be okay? The person you're trying to take down will be the next prosecutor general.

181
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,810
If you made that decision, I will trust your judgment.

182
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:34,690
- Is that right? 
 - Yes.

183
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:38,380
Your faith in me and your hard work so far,

184
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:43,790
I would like to repay you this time. Tell me what you would like.

185
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,090
- I'm okay. 
 - You're okay?

186
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:53,520
I understand. You can leave.

187
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,000
- Hi Gyu Ri. 
 - I let Kim Yeong Il go.

188
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,330
Thank you for believing in me.

189
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:29,100
Make sure your plan works.

190
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,910
I will.

191
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,780
I understand.

192
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,930
Kim Yeong Il has been released.

193
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:44,660
Really?

194
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,010
What do you think of Kim Hui Wu?

195
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:51,350
He seems to have a tendency to succeed in whatever goals he sets.

196
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,810
I like him.

197
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:57,410
The people who seek me out tend to make a lot of noise.

198
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:00,760
Whining and asking me to solve their problems.

199
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:05,180
But Kim Hui Wu isn't like that.

200
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:10,220
He brings me solutions. But something is bothering me.

201
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,370
He doesn't want anything.

202
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:16,120
He is a young prosecutor. He's not old enough to be able to discriminate between good and bad.

203
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,160
At his age, one should have ambition and aspiration.

204
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:25,460
He came out on top from the training center, and by looking at all the cases he's been involved in so far,

205
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,040
he's unusual.

206
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:31,690
That's not all. He figured out my relationship with Park Dae Ho and Bando Bank.

207
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:36,170
He also figured out that I sent the assailant.

208
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:41,720
Sometimes, he catches me off guard. He's remarkable.

209
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,420
He also knows he is great.

210
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:48,230
But, he doesn't want anything?

211
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,370
- Secretary Kim. 
 - Yes, sir.

212
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:53,400
Pick someone who can keep Kim Hui Wu in check.

213
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:58,280
- Someone skilled and unique from inside the prosecution. 
 - Yes, sir.

214
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,590
Those at the Eastern District Prosecutors' Office who backed off, leave them alone.

215
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,680
Yes, sir.

216
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,140
 Daily Newspaper. 

217
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,020
 'Principles and Integrity' Kim Seok Hun, Candidate for Prosecutor General. 

218
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,590
 Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office Chief Kim Seok Hun 

219
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,090
 Don't worry about your son's problem. I will take care of it. 

220
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:23,270
 Get rid of Yun Jong Gi, who is blocking your path. 

221
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,130
Come in.

222
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,990
Did you call for me?

223
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:38,260
- The Bando Bank Investigation. Shut it down. 
 - What?

224
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:41,610
The opponent has figured it out. It's meaningless now.

225
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,260
Yes, sir.

226
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:50,030
I will give you a new target. Your planning skills will be more than enough.

227
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:54,260
Get him. Eastern District Chief Prosecutor Yun Jong Gi.

228
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,790
- Got it?  
 - Yes.

229
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:00,520
- Get started. 
 - Yes, sir.

230
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,350
 Chief Director of Prosecutors' Office
 Chief Director Kim Seok Hun. 

231
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:30,070
It's me.

232
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:33,160
You want to bring down Kim Seok Hun?

233
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,790
Yes.

234
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,800
How?

235
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:51,830
 Loan Agreement 

236
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,700
- This is... 
 -  Yes. 

237
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:59,550
It's the illegal loan file of Kim Seok Hun's son, JQ Construction's Executive Director Kim Yeong Il and the Bando Bank.

238
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:04,190
It's a card I can't use at the Prosecutors' Office, but I think it's different in political circles.

239
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:06,850
- Do you want to expose it? 
 - No.

240
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:09,690
Please persuade CEO Kim Jeong Taek.

241
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,810
Persuade him...

242
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:17,130
Will CEO Kim Jeong Taek use this to hold Kim Seok Hun back?

243
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,890
The general election is around the corner.

244
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:23,960
Nobody knows what kind of variables will come up.

245
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:28,700
Although he is the leader of the weak opposition party, Kim Jeong Taek already got a taste for power.

246
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:33,320
He might aim for something more.

247
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,990
For now, just persuade him.

248
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,920
Please do me that favor, sir.

249
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,770
Okay.

250
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,980
 I am sorry. 

251
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:51,770
 I cannot tell you everything yet. 

252
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:56,920
 That Kim Seok Hun is the bait and the target is Kim Jeong Taek.  

253
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:08,320
 In my prior life, Kim Jeong Taek was eliminated brutally by Jo Tae Seop. 

254
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:13,230
 After his arrest on a charge of defamation, Great Korea Party head Kim Jeong Taek,  

255
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:16,640
 who accused JQ Construction's Executive Director Kim Yeong Il 

256
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,660
 and Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop as being behind  Bando Bank's illegal loan case,  

257
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,690
  resigned from politics. 

258
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:26,380
 For causing concern among the public by spreading incorrect information, 

259
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:30,020
 I humbly apologize. 

260
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:34,910
 I, Kim Jeong Taek, will go back to being a citizen from now on. 

261
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:39,790
 Thank you so much for sending so much support and love till now. 

262
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:41,190
 Kim Jeong Taek, former head of Great Korea Party. 

263
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:45,500
 A bridgehead to eliminate Kim Jeong Taek was made. 

264
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,630
 Bando Bank's Loan to JQ Construction, Related Documents 

265
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,170
 Daehan Party 

266
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:54,890
 A Better Korea 

267
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:56,370
Is this all true?

268
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:58,860
Everything is factual.

269
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:03,050
If you find it suspicious, check it with the Eastern District Prosecutors' Office.

270
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:07,390
But... why are you giving this to me?

271
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:11,260
How long are you going to act as Jo Tae Seop's puppet?

272
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:14,010
How long are you going to be a puppet for the ruling party?

273
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:17,760
How much has our Daehan Party faced because of Jo Tae Seop, till now?

274
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:23,590
During the sexual favors scandal, all the assemblymen in the Democratic Party went unscathed

275
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:28,660
but in our party, two assemblymen lost their positions.

276
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:34,350
Jo Tae Seop has already decided unofficially on Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun as Prosecutor General.

277
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:38,770
Of course, he's already finished talking with the members of the legislative judiciary committee.

278
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:43,590
Besides the Assembly, he's trying to gain command of even the Prosecution Service.

279
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:46,450
We must stop him.

280
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:50,330
Before the general elections, through Kim Seok Hun, we will reveal flaws in the ruling party.

281
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:55,390
Using that momentum, if we show that the ruling party is a corrupt group,

282
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:59,520
we can even claim the majority.

283
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:09,960
Assemblyman Hwang, please stop digging up dirt on other people and instead take care of the public welfare.

284
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:15,970
If you don't, during this party nomination, you cannot be assured of your district.

285
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,180
 Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop 

286
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,900
 Great Korea Party
 A Better Korea 

287
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:25,680
Could you excuse me? It's an important call.

288
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:35,510
Yes, sir.

289
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:39,470
Ah, I understand.

290
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,650
 Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong 

291
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:53,100
- Yes, sir. 
- I've conveyed it to Minority Leader Kim Jeong Taek.

292
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:57,550
But I don't think he's convinced.

293
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:00,810
I understand. Thank you for your efforts.

294
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:08,460
 The wind will start picking up now. 

295
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:14,630
 Have you been well, Minority Leader Kim? You look good. 

296
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:18,390
It's been a while since I last saw you.

297
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:20,670
Why did you want to see me?

298
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:26,140
The approaching general election. I mean the Daehan Party nominations.

299
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:30,000
Let you and I discuss who will make that list.

300
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,820
- Sir.
 - Minority Leader Kim.

301
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:38,130
Do you believe Korea is normal right now? Let me ask again.

302
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:41,820
Do you think it will become normal if it continues this way?

303
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,960
Until when must each party fight like enemies?

304
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,760
As a result of useless fights over pride, the country's competitiveness is falling behind.

305
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,250
Other countries are growing daily. What are we doing?

306
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:59,180
Postponing marriages, not having babies, giving up on jobs.

307
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,500
Why?

308
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:04,840
Because the country's assemblymen are only fighting and not doing the work they should be doing.

309
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:08,950
Now is the time for both parties to combine their strengths.

310
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:11,370
I mean that it's time for cooperation.

311
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:17,540
You and I will be opening the door to that era.

312
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,040
Toward one goal,

313
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,990
I'd like to run instead of fighting.

314
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:23,420
Still,

315
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:28,530
Daehan Party's nominations aren't something I can discuss with an assemblyman of the Democratic Party.

316
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:32,980
If there wasn't a problem in the first place, would I have set up a meeting like this?

317
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,550
- Manager Han.
 - Yes,  sir.

318
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,390
 Investigation Results for Kim Jeong Taek, the Leader of Daehan Party 

319
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,680
Wasn't this matter already over with?

320
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:58,040
On the condition of not holding me accountable, I also

321
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:02,140
gave you the list of names of corrupt assemblymen in the People's Party that Assemblyman Hwang Jin Young obtained.

322
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,290
It was an equal trade.

323
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:07,360
I took action on behalf of the party,

324
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:13,070
and you took action in order to hide your guilt. Look at the following page.

325
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:17,180
You again accepted a request to select a business for government property.

326
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:20,450
You received 1 billion won from two local construction companies.

327
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:25,230
I also heard that you're making deals these days using Daehan Party's nomination rights.

328
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,220
Sir!

329
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:30,050
Minority Leader Kim, I, too, am someone who was a prosecutor.

330
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:33,380
I can't keep my eyes shut after seeing violations of the law.

331
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:41,380
Register the names for the party nominations after discussing them with me.

332
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:56,610
 Daehan Party 

333
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,790
 Material regarding Bando Bank's Loan to JQ Construction 

334
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:25,200
How are you? It's me, Kim Jeong Taek.

335
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,220
Could I see you for a moment?

336
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,830
 Material regarding Bando Bank's Loan to JQ Construction 

337
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,660
How did you...?

338
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:41,790
Let me get straight to the point, Chief Prosecutor.

339
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,100
Let's join hands.

340
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,620
Won't the risk be too big? You must know already.

341
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:51,820
It could also mean that we can gain a lot if we succeed.

342
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:57,180
For you, the Prosecutor General position, and for me, it'll solidify my position.

343
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:03,510
It's a matter that's already been upended.

344
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:09,220
But it's never been made an issue of in political circles.

345
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:12,350
Do you mean that you will stoke the fire?

346
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,910
Yes.

347
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:16,780
We will bring up the truth at the start,

348
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:20,490
so please bring it to justice and take care of the end.

349
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:24,060
Then the name on the next prosecutor general's desk plate

350
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:28,000
 will be your name, Yun Jong Gi. 

351
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,490
Is that so?

352
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:37,070
The prosecution office doesn't always have to be the one to search for the truth.

353
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:43,400
If you work hard, I shall also do my best.

354
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,120
Thank you.

355
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,350
I understand.

356
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,770
Modify the ones I've checked.

357
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:57,550
Yes, sir. I just received a call from Chairman Park Dae Ho.

358
00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:00,850
Kim Yeong Il is holding, as a hostage, the stake in Cheonha Holdings.

359
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:02,600
He said he wants a business loan.

360
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,160
Tell him to deny it. Kim Seok Hun will take care of it.

361
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,050
All right.

362
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:11,490
- Manager Han. 
 - Yes, sir.

363
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:14,540
It seems the three Cheonha siblings are being quiet.

364
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:17,200
Shall I summon Vice Chairman Kim Yong Jun?

365
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,760
Just relay my greetings to him.

366
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,700
Yes, I will.

367
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,810
Director.

368
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:32,830
The National Tax Service's special tax investigation team went to Cheonha Electronics.

369
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,200
What?

370
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,060
Only Cheonha Electronics?  Not the other affiliates?

371
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,430
Just Cheonha Electronics.

372
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,240
They're targeting Oppa, and Jo Tae Seop is behind this.

373
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,760
It's such a sudden investigation that even people in related departments weren't aware of it.

374
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,350
So what's Oppa doing?

375
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:54,280
Vice Chairman Kim Yong Jun is meeting with the finance team to come up with a plan.

376
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:57,940
- That's not going to do it. 
 - Excuse me?

377
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:01,980
It's a signal from Jo Tae Seop to go see him.

378
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:05,430
It means he is slowly going to tighten the leash.

379
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:11,490
I need to send a signal to Jo Tae Seop, too.

380
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:15,470
It's not going to be easy to hold onto our leashes.

381
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:20,210
I will do exactly what Jo Tae Seop did.

382
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:25,040
So I was so surprised when I saw her wearing that.

383
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,240
Anyway, what's the amount you urgently need?

384
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,240
Two hundred billion won.

385
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,890
- Two hundred billion? 
 - Yes.

386
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:35,180
I can't.  The amount is too large.

387
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:39,730
It would be too difficult because the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) is scrutinizing corporate loans.

388
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:44,990
Chairman Park, that's not what we agreed on.

389
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:48,380
The stake in Cheonha Holdings is in my hands.

390
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:52,240
What do you want me to do when the FSS is watching with a spotlight on?

391
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,700
Don't even think about trying to convince me.

392
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:58,200
Why don't you ask your mom for some allowance?

393
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,890
Or go to those wealthy shareholders and beg on your knees.

394
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:05,980
It's up to you. It's your company, not mine.

395
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,860
 JQ Construction Executives:  Kim Yeong Il, Executive Director 

396
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,790
 JQ Construction Trend Briefing No. 13 

397
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,950
How many shares of JQ do we own?

398
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:32,250
About 3.4%.

399
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,660
Approach Kim Yeong Il.

400
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:40,260
For the amount of shares you own, he will cater to you on his knees with just one call.

401
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,570
Yes.

402
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:45,490
But, Hyeong, there's something you should know.

403
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:48,300
A few days ago, a big private investor appeared at JQ Construction.

404
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:52,040
He wiped up the shares after stock market hours, and there was nothing I could do.

405
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,260
Did you find out who it is?

406
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:57,870
I barely managed to get the name. Park Jong Hyeok?

407
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:00,390
Park Jong Hyeok...

408
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:05,220
Okay. He may show up tomorrow, so be on alert.

409
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,640
Yes.

410
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:10,600
And Yeon Seok, you're Sang Man's secretary and driver.

411
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,890
I'll be his security, too.

412
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:14,400
I saw on the news that sometimes fights break out.

413
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:18,140
All right. Make sure to look after him well.

414
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:56,820
 JQ Construction 

415
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:08,040
 JQ Construction Co., Ltd. Invitational Business Briefing for Shareholders 

416
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,830
Have you come for the business briefing?

417
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:11,850
- Yes, that's right. 
 - May I have your name?

418
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:13,970
 It is Park Sang Man. 

419
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,550
Chairman Park Sang Man.

420
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:21,570
I am Sin Dae Wung, Managing Director of JQ Construction.

421
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:25,070
Our Executive Director is waiting for you. Follow me.

422
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,570
Yes.

423
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,320
Oh, welcome.

424
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,410
Say hello. This is Executive Director Kim Yeong Il.

425
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:46,110
Hello. Nice to meet you, Chairman Park.

426
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,570
Yes. What is it?

427
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:59,250
 I guess they are in a rush 

428
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:04,310
He says his father is going to become prosecutor general and he's encouraging investment.

429
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:06,510
So I promised investment using the shares as collateral.

430
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:08,840
Good.  Hang around a little before you go home.

431
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:12,850
Yes, Hyeong. I'll come back early. In the morning.

432
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,500
Aren't you going to work out?

433
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,360
I'm leaving right now.

434
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,880
What is this?

435
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,710
I eat it before I work out.

436
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,500
The color is intense.

437
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,690
Two at a time.

438
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,980
Here.

439
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,200
Thanks.

440
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,910
What for?  Have a nice chat.

441
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,870
But, I noticed you were pensive since earlier.

442
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:21,190
Kim Seok Hun has been nominated to be prosecutor general. It's an affront to the Prosecution Service.

443
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:24,800
- Are you sure? 
 - I heard it from a colleague at the Supreme Prosecutor's Office.

444
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,050
We've collected so much evidence, yet, we couldn't use any of it.

445
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:32,080
The path that Kim Seok Hun travels is a bed of roses.

446
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:35,410
We need to make it a thorny path.

447
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:37,120
How?

448
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,500
I'd like to borrow some external help.

449
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,140
External help?

450
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:44,460
Kim Jeong Taek, the leader of Daehan Party.

451
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,660
Kim Jeong Taek?

452
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,120
Yes.

453
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:53,020
Politicians are good at biting into and hanging on to other people's corruption.

454
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:57,900
I... don't trust politicians.

455
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:01,270
And would that alone be enough?

456
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:05,990
There is a surefire solution.

457
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:17,170
Sir, the JQ Construction Corruption documents have reached Daehan Party Chairman Kim Jeong Taek.

458
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:18,400
How was it leaked?

459
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,100
I'm looking into it right now.

460
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,880
First, we checked the chief prosecutor of the Eastern District Prosecutors' Office and Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu.

461
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:28,480
It has been confirmed that they have not contacted Kim Jeong Taek or his close associates.

462
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,430
I suspect it was Yun Jong Gi, the chief prosecutor of the Eastern District Prosecutors' Office.

463
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:36,350
It could also be an expression of dissatisfaction with the prosecutor general's internal affairs.

464
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:40,230
- Make sure to investigate fully.
 - Yes, sir.

465
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:48,370
Sir, Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun is here.

466
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:50,190
Come in.

467
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:54,200
Ah, yes.

468
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:59,070
Congratulations on being nominated Prosecutor General.

469
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:01,660
- Thank you. 
 - Of course.

470
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:05,160
There will be a hearing soon, so prepare well.

471
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,270
I've put in a good word to the Judiciary Committee of the National Assembly.

472
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:11,390
If you prepare your answers well, you will pass easily.

473
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:12,830
Yes, I understand.

474
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:14,680
I will prepare well so as not to be a hindrance.

475
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:18,310
And be careful not to become fodder for gossip until the hearing.

476
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:20,460
Yes, sir.

477
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,090
And... Kim Jeong Taek.

478
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:25,650
Excuse me?

479
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:36,160
It's Kim Jeong Taek's nomination scandal. It would be  better if there's another charge.

480
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,520
Just investigate, don't prosecute.

481
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:42,450
I'll decide when to file the charges, so just keep that in mind.

482
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:44,620
Yes, I understand.

483
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:51,710
 Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office 

484
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:53,550
Come in.

485
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,960
You called for me?

486
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,680
Yes.

487
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:13,180
I am going to be the next prosecutor general.

488
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:16,120
Oh, congratulations.

489
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,780
I didn't call you to congratulate me.

490
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,010
We're nearly there.

491
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:25,530
The prosecution I've always wanted, beyond everyone's expectations. I'll be able to achieve it soon.

492
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:29,920
So, I have something I would like you to do.

493
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,090
Give Yun Jong Gi's case to Choi Kang Jin.

494
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:39,920
 Improper Nomination by Daehan Party Chairman Kim Jeong Taek 

495
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,000
It's the details of the nomination scandal of Kim Jeong Taek, the leader of the Daehan Party.

496
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,740
Check the facts and find every detail on Chairman Kim Jeong Taek.

497
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,950
That is your job.

498
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:57,500
Yes, sir.

499
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,340
You may leave.

500
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:07,110
 Okay, it's Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong's turn. 

501
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:16,250
You want me to become the party leader?

502
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:19,750
Yes, sir.

503
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:23,260
I would like you to become the leader of Daehan Party.

504
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:29,560
I don't like the sound of pushing out Kim Jeong Taek when he's done nothing wrong.

505
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,590
Please take a look at this.

506
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,460
 Daehan Party Chairman Kim Jeong Taek Improper Nomination 

507
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,440
 request  for money and valuables, sexual favors 

508
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:01,380
We can't beat Jo Tae Seop because someone like him is leading the minority party.

509
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,640
How did you get...

510
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:08,070
I've received orders from the chief prosecutor

511
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:11,870
to look into what Kim Jeong Taek has been doing

512
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:14,020
all these years.

513
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:20,790
I'm sure the chief prosecutor got his orders from Jo Tae Seop.

514
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:26,620
Kim Jeong Taek has started on the Bando Bank's illegal loans incident.

515
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:30,020
The wind that you helped create has finally started to blow.

516
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:34,760
Did you plan all this to make me the party leader?

517
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:39,750
Is that why you told me to give the file to Kim Jeong Taek?

518
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,260
Yes, sir.

519
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:48,500
I apologize for not telling you everything in advance.

520
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,100
I'm sorry.

521
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,850
Fine.

522
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:56,620
Then what are you going to do now?

523
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:03,480
I'm going to help Jo Tae Seop and bring down Kim Jeong Taek.

524
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:07,790
 I will offer him help and cut out his right hand man, Kim Seok Hun.  

525
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:13,950
 Then, I will get Hwang Jin Yong appointed as the leader of the opposition party to rival Jo Tae Seop. 

526
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:19,080
Please become the leader of the party.

527
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,810
You...

528
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:24,810
have crossed the line.

529
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:31,380
Do you like fishing?

530
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:38,990
The sun has to set and dew has to settle for fish to come out at this reservoir.

531
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:42,460
Until then, you have to keep throwing bait

532
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:45,980
and wait.

533
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:48,300
Just wait a little bit.

534
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:53,520
It'll be night soon and it will be covered in dew.

535
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,130
I apologize.

536
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:12,020
The trigger has already been pulled.

537
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,940
Wow! It's a big fish before the night dew.

538
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:35,820
You'll also be able to catch big fish at the National Assembly!

539
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,120
Oh, Sang Man. What's up?

540
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,610
Yes, Hyeong. I discovered something a little weird.

541
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:59,990
- What is it? 
  - You know the big JQ Construction investor Park Jong Hyeok that we talked about last time? 

542
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:03,090
I hacked into the system and did some investigating.

543
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:07,230
That person's IP address...

544
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:09,100
Are you sure?

545
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,290
Okay.

546
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:26,020
Prosecutor Kim is here.

547
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:30,520
Welcome, I was surprised by your sudden contact.

548
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,980
What brings you all the way here?

549
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,570
I needed to check something.

550
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:35,800
- Confirm?
 - Yeah.

551
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:39,020
I will step outside.

552
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,750
Hold on.

553
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:50,090
I would like to speak to you.

554
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:57,030
 Management and Strategy Chief Office 

555
00:41:57,030 --> 00:42:01,270
I was going to tell you at the right opportunity. You beat me to it.

556
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:07,740
I simply returned to Jo Tae Seop, Park Dae Ho, and Kim Yeong Il what they gave to me.

557
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:11,070
My name is too well known so I asked Mr. Park.

558
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:14,800
He was a former special agent, so he's been using the alias Park Jin Hyeok.

559
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:19,540
instead of his real name, Park Jong Hyeok. He was perfect for this plan.

560
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,470
I see.

561
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:27,500
I had no idea it was the Office Manager Park I knew. I thought another major shareholder had surfaced.

562
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,840
I'm sorry for confusing you.

563
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:34,840
It's fine. This happened because I didn't know your real name.

564
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:38,550
On the other hand, I'm impressed by your intel source.

565
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:40,540
You should be impressed.

566
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:46,590
But if I noticed, I'm sure Jo Tae Seop did too.

567
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:49,250
He'll figure it out soon too.

568
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:53,270
This could be dangerous for you.

569
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:57,560
The only reason Jo Tae Seop left you alone is because you didn't get involved in this game.

570
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:01,910
But you already got yourself involved.

571
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:05,260
So?

572
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:11,910
We have the upper hand now. That's all we should focus on.

573
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:18,640
Do you think I didn't expect this when I started? My dad told me something.

574
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:22,260
"When the fight starts, only focus on winning."

575
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:25,720
"Don't deviate even if you bleed."

576
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:29,050
"Just think about crushing the opponent."

577
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:33,910
I've already stepped into the boxing ring. I can't pull out now.

578
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:37,850
It's now how risky it is.  I am focused only on winning.

579
00:43:42,430 --> 00:43:46,920
How large a stake in JQ Constructions' shares did you gather up through Sang Man?

580
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:50,800
About 3.4 percent. You?

581
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,460
I have two percent.

582
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:55,550
That means together we have over five percent.

583
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:59,120
If we buy a little more we should be able to earn management rights.

584
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:04,090
Sang Man invested around 20 billion won with JQ Constructions' shares as collateral.

585
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:08,510
But it seems Kim Yeong Il wants to borrow more than that.

586
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:11,380
Borrow more?

587
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:13,960
He must not be afraid of debt.

588
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:17,340
If we are successful in acquiring more shares, we might be able to take over JQ Construction.

589
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:19,100
Relay this to Sang Man.

590
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:24,590
A big player nuna who wants to invest in JQ Constructions is looking forward to his call.

591
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:27,960
Okay.

592
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,850
That'll make that kid happy.

593
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:33,790
Contact me if you ever need me.

594
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,550
Thank you.

595
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:41,190
- I'll be on my way now. 
 - Bye.

596
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:59,850
Here's the investment contract.

597
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:02,750
Kim Yeong Il is asking to borrow an even bigger sum.

598
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:05,760
Lend it to him, since there's already collateral.

599
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,390
Because the amount is so big, it's a bit burdensome.

600
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:10,800
Should I decrease the burden a bit?

601
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,510
How?

602
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:15,650
That big private investor. It was one of Hui Ah's people.

603
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:19,350
Yes! I knew it.

604
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:22,540
Hui Ah says she wants to invest in JQ Construction with you.

605
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:26,480
Nuna Hui Ah said that?

606
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,150
Happy?

607
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:33,060
-  Meet up with her and discuss it. 
 - She wants to... to meet me?

608
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:35,750
Hyeong, what has happened to me?

609
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:38,990
Does she like me?

610
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:47,260
Yes, sir.

611
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:50,510
I'm on the way to meet Kim Jeong Taek.

612
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:56,660
If this time things go again as you expect, I will make a bid.

613
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:58,670
Leader of the party.

614
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:06,420
I fact-checked the material you gave me.

615
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:11,010
JQ Construction and Bando Bank's illegal loan.

616
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:13,320
It was true after all.

617
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:18,640
You asked before how long I was going to live as Jo Tae Seop's puppet.

618
00:46:21,370 --> 00:46:23,360
I won't.

619
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:27,990
So I have a request to make.

620
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:32,610
For the moment, I'm going to bow before Jo Tae Seop.

621
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:35,880
Seizing the opportunity while my opponent is off guard...

622
00:46:37,810 --> 00:46:39,730
 Material Concerning Bando Bank's Loan to JQ Construction 

623
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:41,860
please expose this.

624
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:47,450
Exactly like the last time.

625
00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:50,960
The outcome will be different

626
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,790
since we also have the prosecution.

627
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:01,690
 List of Daehan Party Assemblyman Nominees 

628
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:07,030
I will follow your wishes.

629
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:09,640
It's our party's list of nominations.

630
00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:20,900
Get ready. It'll come out shortly.

631
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:22,570
Yes.

632
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:25,720
 Material concerning Bando Bank's Loan to JQ Construction 

633
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:28,190
Jo Tae Seop.

634
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:33,900
You underestimated me.

635
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:43,250
He knows my weakness, yet he pretends to act innocent?

636
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:46,220
Should I contact Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun?

637
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:48,550
That's alright. Not yet.

638
00:47:48,550 --> 00:47:52,460
Making a move now will only be venting my anger.

639
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:54,570
There's nothing to gain.

640
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:58,070
Rat-like bastards.

641
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:35,060
Thank you for coming again. I guess the taste suits you well.

642
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:36,610
Because it's been a while since you've come,

643
00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:40,040
Hui Wu's mother put out the entire kitchen.

644
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:44,190
- Here. 
 - You always pack up food whenever we come here.

645
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:46,270
We are the ones who are thankful.

646
00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:48,230
It's me you should say thanks to.

647
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:52,560
It was hard to bring out the entire kitchen. Since I'm the king in the kitchen.

648
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,940
Madam, when it comes to food, mine is tastier, no?

649
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:56,240
What are you saying?

650
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,010
Hui Wu, tell me honestly.

651
00:48:58,010 --> 00:49:00,360
Between mine and your dad's, whose is tastier?

652
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:04,030
- Excuse me?
 - Prosecutor, tell us the truth.

653
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:09,610
That is...

654
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:12,140
That's it. It's exactly that!

655
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:16,250
- When you get married, don't take anyone's side.
 - Right.

656
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:18,110
You're right. I didn't think of it. When we got married,

657
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:22,710
I said my mom's food was tasty and suffered at lot at your mom's hands.

658
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:25,330
However, I'm on your side.

659
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:28,880
Indeed, Prosecutor Ji has sense.

660
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,910
Fake prosecutor, please leave. Get out immediately.

661
00:49:30,910 --> 00:49:34,050
Get out. Get out.

662
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:35,740
Welcome.

663
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:38,310
I wasn't saying that to you.

664
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:42,020
Please sit here.

665
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:48,330
It's tomorrow.

666
00:49:48,330 --> 00:49:50,520
Kim Seok Hun's confirmation hearing.

667
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:59,890
Right. How sweet. It's been a while since we got together.

668
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:04,480
- Here, let's drink!
 - Yes.

669
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:18,130
Chief Prosecutor is coming.

670
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:23,520
- Goodbye, sir.
 - Goodbye, sir.

671
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,300
Why are you all out here when it's not even anything special?

672
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:28,360
Let's proceed, Prosecutor General.

673
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:30,390
- Goodbye, sir.
 - Goodbye, sir.

674
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:34,520
- Goodbye, sir.
 - Goodbye, sir.

675
00:50:59,910 --> 00:51:01,670
Goodbye, sir.

676
00:51:11,970 --> 00:51:17,590
We will now begin the confirmation hearing of the Prosecutor General nominee.

677
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:26,310
"I swear to tell the truth in accordance

678
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:32,840
with my conscience without evasion and aid.

679
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:35,620
You may now question the nominee.

680
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:40,720
Making false resident registrations, falsifying contracts, or committing property speculation.

681
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,990
Indeed, it's befitting a candidate for the next prosecutor general.

682
00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:44,980
Thank you.

683
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:49,560
As a prosecutor, I did not do anything that ran counter to my position.

684
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:53,730
As you're a member of JQ Group, people are concerned

685
00:51:53,730 --> 00:51:57,000
that you may go easy on the wealthy.

686
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,610
What do you think in regard to this?

687
00:52:00,610 --> 00:52:03,240
I can understand where it's coming from.

688
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,730
While living as a prosecutor for over twenty years,

689
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:09,410
I have never been shaken by improper requests or bribes.

690
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:13,340
Also, my in-laws' and my work are completely separate.

691
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:19,230
If you become the prosecutor general, what would you like to change first?

692
00:52:19,230 --> 00:52:24,600
Our agency comes across as rigid and unapproachable.

693
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:28,870
I want people to see it as a flexible and friendly agency, so the people can freely communicate with us.

694
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,670
Hello.

695
00:52:32,670 --> 00:52:35,220
I'm Prosecutor Jeon Seok Gyu of the Central District Office.

696
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:39,120
I will now begin the briefing about Nominee Kim Seok Hun's son,

697
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:42,840
Managing Director Kim Yeong Il of JQ Constructions. During this briefing, I'll disclose the corruption behind the bidding

698
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:46,670
for the construction site as well as the embezzlement of the deposits for apartment units.

699
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:50,400
Hold on. Did you run this by the public relations officer?

700
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:55,140
He's in the confirmation hearing to be the Prosecutor General and you're going after his son?

701
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:56,890
What does that matter?

702
00:52:56,890 --> 00:52:59,440
Isn't telling the truth a journalist's spirit?

703
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:04,150
If you're not going to write the article, please leave. I will tell the truth by myself.

704
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:06,650
I guess I'll get an exclusive.

705
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:10,390
Please continue, Manager Jeon Seok Gyu.

706
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:14,460
Criminal Investigation Division Five noticed a sign of collusion between public and private sectors

707
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:19,870
and the unlawful involvement of civil servants during the bidding process of development areas in Gusan and launched an investigation.

708
00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:24,910
JQ Construction colluded with its competitor to win the bidding with the lowest price,

709
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:28,660
and they offered bribes to civil servants to look away from this corruption (turn a blind eye).

710
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:32,360
On top of that, they also embezzled the deposits for apartment units.

711
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:35,250
Therefore, they should be severely punished.

712
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:41,410
Assemblymen, do you have any other questions?

713
00:53:46,030 --> 00:53:50,950
 I know it will be hard, but please stay until the end. 

714
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:00,160
A news flash has surfaced.

715
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,190
Please check.

716
00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:05,870
- What? 
- What is it?

717
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,970
Sir, please take a look.

718
00:54:14,610 --> 00:54:16,430
 Arrest Warrant Issued for Managing Director Kim Yeong Il 

719
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:22,790
Nominee Kim Seok Hun.

720
00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:28,110
It's been confirmed that your son, Managing Director Kim Yeong Il, indeed committed corruption.

721
00:54:28,110 --> 00:54:30,610
What's your opinion?

722
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:32,840
Please tell us.

723
00:55:09,070 --> 00:55:12,960
You didn't know about this, okay?

724
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,270
But sir...

725
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:18,520
You are my last stronghold.

726
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:21,140
It's preparation for when things go bad for us.

727
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:28,280
Enough. Don't look at me that way.

728
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:33,090
My wife asked how long I was going to work at the prosecutor's office.

729
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:38,530
You know. Promotions have gone down the drain but it's midnight by the time you leave work.

730
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:43,920
Even the kids say the neighbor is better than you.

731
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,590
I don't have any regrets now.

732
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:58,120
You kids. Don't make that kind of face.

733
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:00,970
I put in my years for my pension.

734
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:05,010
Drink up!

735
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,730
What do you plan to do?

736
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:27,790
The citizens are full of distrust.

737
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:31,440
Do you perhaps intend to see it to the end?

738
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:35,180
What should I do?

739
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:45,000
Resign voluntarily.

740
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:47,350
Assemblyman.

741
00:56:47,350 --> 00:56:50,430
Are you asking me to save you?

742
00:56:50,430 --> 00:56:53,000
Is that possible now?

743
00:56:55,530 --> 00:57:01,050
I will turn over the Cheonha Holdings shares my son has to you.

744
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:02,070
Why?

745
00:57:02,070 --> 00:57:05,200
I am hoping you will spend it in the national interest.

746
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:09,370
In the national interest, you say.

747
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:14,560
- Look here, Manager Han. 
 - Yes.

748
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:16,780
Release Kim Jeong Taek's corruption incident.

749
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:18,920
Yes, sir.

750
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:24,010
As for you, go and arrest Kim Jeong Taek.

751
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:28,150
Cover your name with Kim Jeong Taek's name.

752
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:29,550
Thank you, Assemblyman.

753
00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:32,130
But that won't be enough.

754
00:57:32,130 --> 00:57:34,470
It won't even make a dent.

755
00:57:34,470 --> 00:57:40,020
JQ Construction shareholders and victims won't forget this incident.

756
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,560
There's only one way.

757
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:45,870
It's to eliminate the cause when there's a problem.

758
00:57:45,870 --> 00:57:48,390
You have a great precedent.

759
00:57:48,390 --> 00:57:50,420
Choi Kang Jin does.

760
00:57:51,390 --> 00:57:55,000
He himself informed the authorities about his own father.

761
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,050
Arrest your son with your hands.

762
00:57:58,050 --> 00:57:59,020
Sir...

763
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:03,770
Your son broke the law, so you must punish him.

764
00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:06,060
Before others arrest him, you arrest him.

765
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:09,030
Think about everything else after you become the prosecutor general.

766
00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:13,560
Whether you get him out on probation or keep him in prison,

767
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:15,770
take care of that as you see fit.

768
00:58:15,770 --> 00:58:18,230
Become a righteous prosecutor.

769
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:20,930
I will turn the public opinion.

770
00:58:22,490 --> 00:58:25,490
And Jeon Seok Gyu.

771
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:27,610
Don't provoke him.

772
00:58:27,610 --> 00:58:30,240
For now, embrace Jeon Seok Gyu.

773
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:34,000
And when it quiets down, kick him out then.

774
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:37,600
Yes, sir.

775
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:43,610
 Prosecution Service 

776
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:50,170
Come in.

777
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:56,600
 Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun 

778
00:59:03,130 --> 00:59:05,830
You called for me.

779
00:59:05,830 --> 00:59:10,350
Arrest Kim Yeong Il.

780
00:59:13,790 --> 00:59:15,750
Immediately.

781
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:17,420
Yes, sir.

782
00:59:26,050 --> 00:59:28,330
You were supposed to expose him!

783
00:59:28,330 --> 00:59:31,610
Why did you not touch Bando Bank's illegal loan?

784
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:37,200
Kim, I'm not a dog you've raised.

785
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,840
Did you think I wouldn't know what you were thinking?

786
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:41,760
By ordering me to do the divulging,

787
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:44,320
what were you going to do?

788
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:46,610
You probably thought

789
00:59:46,610 --> 00:59:52,930
you could make me do the dangerous work and, if things went wrong, you'd get out.

790
00:59:52,930 --> 00:59:56,910
Did you think I wouldn't see right through your wickedness?

791
00:59:56,910 --> 00:59:58,060
Assemblyman!

792
00:59:58,060 --> 01:00:03,590
A person like you isn't suited to be a party representative.

793
01:00:03,590 --> 01:00:04,660
Step down now.

794
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:06,950
Hwang Jin Yong!

795
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,170
Sir.

796
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:17,540
 Kim Jung Taek Soon to Be Summoned On Corruption Charges 

797
01:00:22,210 --> 01:00:24,830
 Prosecutor Yun Jong Gi 

798
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:28,640
 Daehan Party Leader Kim Jeong Taek 

799
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:32,790
 Daehan Party Leader Kim Jeong Taek 

800
01:00:32,790 --> 01:00:37,180
There's no way I can drown with you.

801
01:00:41,550 --> 01:00:45,490
Hwang Jin Yong too. Jeon Seok Gyu, the tiger too.

802
01:00:45,490 --> 01:00:47,950
To find a way to live,

803
01:00:47,950 --> 01:00:51,550
they did not provoke Bando Bank.

804
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:59,380
- A comment, sir! 
- Any comments?

805
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:00,680
- Please answer our questions! 
- Tell us the truth!

806
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:02,180
Please one comment!

807
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:03,590
Are the allegations true?

808
01:01:03,590 --> 01:01:04,820
Did you know about this?

809
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:06,370
Do you admit to the charges?

810
01:01:06,370 --> 01:01:08,870
- Sir! A comment!
 - Please answer our questions.

811
01:01:08,870 --> 01:01:10,140
Please answer our questions.

812
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:12,380
 For corrupt loans, 

813
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:16,730
 Executive Director Kim Yeong Il of JQ Construction 

814
01:01:16,730 --> 01:01:19,510
 was detained by the Central District Prosecutor's Office today. 

815
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:22,040
 Today's detention resulted from Executive Director Kim Yong Il's father and 

816
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:26,390
Central District Prosecution's Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun's special order.

817
01:01:26,390 --> 01:01:28,950
 Through a briefing by the prosecution service, Chief Prosecutor Kim 

818
01:01:28,950 --> 01:01:34,760
 revealed that he tried to be faithful to a prosecutor's duties. 

819
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:40,290
Assemblyman, he's arrived.

820
01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:42,600
Did you come together?

821
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,570
Escort him in.

822
01:01:44,570 --> 01:01:46,460
Please come in.

823
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:51,340
Welcome.

824
01:02:17,350 --> 01:02:19,310
You're riding in a nice car.

825
01:02:19,310 --> 01:02:20,700
What is it?

826
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:23,150
Why don't you ride in the crap car today?

827
01:02:23,150 --> 01:02:25,530
I came to escort you, as a prosecutor.

828
01:02:25,530 --> 01:02:29,480
Prosecutor Lee Min Su, isn't it about time now to give up?

829
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:31,840
But I obtained a warrant again.

830
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:33,500
 Arrest Warrant 

831
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:35,690
I won't give up.

832
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:41,310
Until I catch you. Until the end.

833
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:47,620
 Mirae Electronics' CEO Jeon Il Bo stood trial for bribery and a violation 

834
01:02:47,620 --> 01:02:51,450
 of the Act on the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Crimes and was released on probation in his first trial. 

835
01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:55,210
 He has been detained again by the prosecutors on yet another charge. 

836
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:03,860
Go first.

837
01:03:07,210 --> 01:03:09,660
Did you come here to say hello?

838
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:12,840
So you could order a fancy meal for him again? Too bad.

839
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:16,690
But it won't work.

840
01:03:16,690 --> 01:03:18,270
Jeon Il Bo is mine.

841
01:03:18,270 --> 01:03:21,480
I'll give him food and I'll also give him the punishment.

842
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:23,290
So don't provoke me.

843
01:03:23,290 --> 01:03:28,970
If you provoke me, know that your life will also end in a prison.

844
01:03:28,970 --> 01:03:33,360
This time, I won't let you off.

845
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:35,980
 Prosecution Service 

846
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:48,410
Jeon Il Bo was arrested.

847
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:52,720
Did Kim Seok Hun allow this?

848
01:03:57,690 --> 01:04:01,940
I apologize. Prosecutor Lee Min Su is someone difficult to control.

849
01:04:02,910 --> 01:04:04,660
President Jeon Il Bo will soon—

850
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:06,370
Carry it out according to the law.

851
01:04:06,370 --> 01:04:09,680
That bastard Jeon Il Bo has committed too many crimes.

852
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:15,640
And bringing down Jeon Il Bo will look great in your resume for your future title.

853
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:17,740
Yes, I understand.

854
01:04:35,390 --> 01:04:36,960
Kim Hui Wu.

855
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,150
Yes.

856
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:42,700
If you didn't exist, I would have chosen to live having fun.

857
01:04:44,830 --> 01:04:47,270
But not now.

858
01:04:47,270 --> 01:04:49,860
Because I found something more fun.

859
01:04:56,170 --> 01:04:58,150
Fighting with you.

860
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:04,990
I am going to work for Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop.

861
01:05:07,290 --> 01:05:08,950
I know.

862
01:05:09,850 --> 01:05:12,350
That the person who framed my father is Jo Tae Seop.

863
01:05:12,350 --> 01:05:16,620
But at that time, Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop was a prosecutor

864
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:17,910
and was only doing his job.

865
01:05:17,910 --> 01:05:18,920
Seonbae.

866
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:21,100
Don't worry.

867
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:23,700
I will keep my mouth shut and help with bringing down Kim Seok Hun.

868
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:27,120
That way, there's the right balance to the game.

869
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:29,130
Right, Bro?

870
01:05:34,990 --> 01:05:38,390
You'll keep quiet and help Kim Seok Hun's fall.

871
01:05:38,390 --> 01:05:40,990
Our last partnership?

872
01:05:44,970 --> 01:05:46,880
Then, you will fight me?

873
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,470
Yup.

874
01:05:56,220 --> 01:06:00,250
Yes, fine.

875
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:03,160
Let's do it.

876
01:06:04,930 --> 01:06:11,970


877
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:16,830
♫  Dear, All your things you've done  ♫

878
01:06:16,830 --> 01:06:20,000
♫  We are here to wreck it up  ♫

879
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:26,020
♫  Who knows, how will it go?  ♫

880
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:33,910
♫  Hiding in black and white  ♫

881
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:37,160
♫  We are here to find the truth  ♫

882
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:43,200
♫  Give up, I warn you so  ♫

883
01:06:45,090 --> 01:06:49,180
♫  Who would ever find out who you really are? Hm  ♫

884
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:52,450
 Again My Life 

885
01:06:52,450 --> 01:06:55,880
 Let's kick Kim Seok Hun out fast. 

886
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:57,890
 Don't kneel! 

887
01:06:57,890 --> 01:07:00,670
 Are you going to use him as an excuse? 

888
01:07:00,670 --> 01:07:06,230
 He saw my weakness. So I need to know at least one of his. 

889
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:10,450
 If you want a deal, bring me something worthy, 

890
01:07:10,450 --> 01:07:12,160
 not your threat. 

891
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:14,390
 Our partnership ends today. 

892
01:07:14,390 --> 01:07:19,510
 Sit. If you leave now, it won't end with you going home. 

893
01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:24,330
 Next, I must get rid of Park Dae Ho, Jo Tae Seop's source of funds. 

894
01:07:24,330 --> 01:07:27,970
♫  Let them get what they want  ♫

895
01:07:31,110 --> 01:07:33,160
 Again My Life
