1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,230
 Again My Life 

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:10,100


3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,800
  20 year-old medical student kills his pregnant lover and denies crime 

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,490
  A creepy and calm suspect who continues to deny crime 
 Brutally murdered after refusing an abortion 

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,400
Good morning. ( In English  
  Episode 8 

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,520
The articles are causing public outrage.

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,440
The number one most searched term

8
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,290
is the female college student's murder.

9
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,560
Everyone is paying attention to the shameless killer.

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,850
- Is Prosecutor Jang Il Hyeon the one in charge of this case? 
 - Yes, sir.

11
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:34,150
He's been different since he began, and he has outstanding skills.

12
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:35,890
Get Kim Seok Hun on the phone.

13
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,270
Yes, Assemblyman. Thank you.

14
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,450
I'll let Jang Il Hyeon know.

15
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,570
Okay. I understand.

16
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:45,730
Okay.

17
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:50,660
I said it wasn't me! I said it wasn't me. It's not!

18
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:55,030
Anger management issues.

19
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,060
Is yelling a mental disorder?

20
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,110
It's a psychologist's diagnosis.

21
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:03,240
How is that proof that I killed someone?

22
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:07,450
You often argued with your girlfriend, and during those arguments, you used abusive language.

23
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:11,360
You would throw things and make a fuss,

24
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,320
and even ended up fighting with the neighbors.

25
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,880
I already explained that to you!

26
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:20,260
- Can you please listen to me—
 - You fought with your girlfriend that day, too.

27
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,090
You stabbed her in a fit of rage when you lost your reasoning.

28
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:27,340
Accidental murders are all simple.

29
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,560
What's complicated is the feeling of the person doing the stabbing.

30
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,970
Please! Listen to me!

31
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,060
Hey.

32
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:45,760
I'm not sitting here to listen to someone like you babble.

33
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,590
How dare you?

34
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:56,770
You're going to get the maximum sentence.

35
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:01,510
Do you know who decides the verdict? The court of public opinion.

36
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,720
You ...

37
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,370
are finished, Punk.

38
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,150
Yes. This is Jang Il Hyeon.

39
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:26,210
 Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop is paying special attention to this case. 

40
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:28,690
 Make sure to be transparent and thorough. 

41
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,940
 and Mirae Electronics stays out of the news. 

42
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:36,380
Okay. I'll try to cause more provocative headlines.

43
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,190
Thank you.

44
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,490
It looks like we need to speed this up.

45
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:50,850
Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop is paying special attention to this case.

46
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,770
There's also something I'm aiming for while the timing's good.

47
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,990
If things go well for me, it will benefit you, too.

48
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:01,430
- You understand, right? 
 - Yes. Thank you.

49
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:06,070
This punk has no patience.

50
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:09,390
Hello, Reporter Park. Tonight?

51
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,430
Okay!

52
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:15,820
Yeah. I actually had something to tell you.

53
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,460
Don't you think It's time you got promoted?

54
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,980
Do I ever say anything I don't mean?

55
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,570
Nice to see you.

56
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,380
Why did you want to see us?

57
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,490
I'll catch Jang Il Hyeon.

58
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,950
Jang Il Hyeon?

59
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:49,200
What's this? His eyes are glistening again.

60
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,550
Something's definitely up.

61
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:56,500
Someone getting excited at the thought of a promotion by putting another's life on the line.

62
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,510
That shouldn't be allowed.

63
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:02,770
Of course. That's more than enough reason for motivation. But how will you do it?

64
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:04,450
Sponsor prosecutor.

65
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,160
That will get people's attention for sure.

66
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,440
But that alone won't get as big a response as you want.

67
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,830
Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun is the one backing Jang Il Hyeon.

68
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:16,130
And behind both of them is probably someone even more powerful.

69
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:21,070
Well, It hurts my pride to have to discuss this for more than five minutes.

70
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:24,360
Let's set the table lightly like we did in Gimsan.

71
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,780
- Set the table? 
 - Yes.

72
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,550
Jang Il Hyeon is currently dating Seong Jin Mi.

73
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:34,610
Hey, what are you going to do with the two of them dating?

74
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:37,510
First off, I'm going to expose them to the media.

75
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:41,550
- Hey. Do you think I'm some sort of entertainment reporter? 
 - Hey

76
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,550
What are friends for?

77
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,550
If you show them that, they'll probably treat you to a meal.

78
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,600
Okay. In exchange, you pay for drinks.

79
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,860
 TV: Seung Ji Min is a pianist and president of the National Foundation for the Arts University. 

80
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,720
Isn't that Jang Il Hyeon? 
  TV: Seong Jin Mi fell in love. 

81
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,470
Have they been dating that long? Meeting in a place like that. 
  TV:  She's dating a prosecutor at the Central District Prosecutors' Office and they became lovers when they met at an event. 

82
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:03,700
It's that prosecutor passing by now. 
   TV:  Look forward  

83
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:07,950
What is going on exactly? 
  TV: to lots of news about their lovely relationship! 

84
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:10,520
Prosecutor Jang, I heard that you're dating nowadays?

85
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,880
Make sure you eat some chives.  (for stamina) .

86
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,440
Why would I eat chives when I'm dating?

87
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,930
Go do some squats, you loser. 
  Pianist Song Jin Mi falls in love with a prosecutor! 

88
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:22,630
She's getting more media exposure than expected.
  Pianist Seong Jin Mi 

89
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:26,280
Dating is good, but you need to think about the advantages and disadvantages.

90
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,970
I'll make sure to take care of any potential disadvantages as we date.

91
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,050
There are advantages then?

92
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:38,330
Yes. There's something functional in the sexual relationship between men and women.

93
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:42,170
Well. A prosecutor and artist.

94
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,930
is  not a bad combination.

95
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,160
Congratulations.

96
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,890
Thank you!

97
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:50,040
Really? The Chief Prosecutor congratulated you?

98
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,070
Of course!

99
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:54,470
 The corruption of two people in the spotlight breaks out at once. 

100
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:57,290
 The whole world will be watching.  

101
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,500
 Once that happens, whether it's Kim Seok Hun or the higher-ups in power, 

102
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,260
  will have a hard time covering it. 

103
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:07,980
Before that, please take charge of Seong Jin Mi at the National Foundation for the Arts University.

104
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,130
What's this?

105
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,210
An admissions list from the National Foundation for the Arts University

106
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:14,480
and a history of asset changes for Seong Jin Mi and the foundation.

107
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,390
Please look it over.

108
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,110
Wow. How amazing.

109
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:23,000
Entrance exam corruption, tax evasion, and embezzlement.

110
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,590
Do you think it'll be possible?

111
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:29,160
Private school corruption isn't a new issue.

112
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,150
And Seong Jin Mi is a big spender

113
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,630
who tends to travel abroad often.

114
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:37,450
So there is a high likelihood she is using the foundation's money for her own gain.

115
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,680
You have a point. It is sufficiently possible.

116
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,580
Okay.

117
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,620
Got it.

118
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,810
Boss.

119
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,320
Good job.

120
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,880
 I'll leave the Jang Il Hyeon's sponsor case in your care. 

121
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:04,160
I understand. I've also collected some materials, so I'll do my best to catch them.

122
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,360
For now, I'll focus on the investigation that Jang Il Hyeon is in charge of.

123
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,430
- The female college student murder case? 
 - Yes.

124
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:14,930
We can't let someone be wronged because of a prosecutor like Jang Il Hyeon.

125
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,670
 Prosecution Service 

126
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,660
You must be tired from being investigated all day.

127
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,590
I'm sorry for calling you out again.

128
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,670
It's fine.

129
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,170
You didn't kill her, right?

130
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:42,280
You said you didn't kill her.

131
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,710
Right?

132
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:51,020
No. It wasn't me.

133
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:54,690
We got into a big argument, so I went out for a bit since I was angry.

134
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,740
But while I was gone...

135
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,130
If I had stayed, she wouldn't have died.

136
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,150
How far did you go?

137
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:09,500
I went from the alley down to the main road.

138
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,140
Then I smoked a cigarette and went back when I calmed down.

139
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:16,620
Walking down that street wouldn't have taken longer than five minutes.

140
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,590
That's true.

141
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:22,490
You were so close by, but you didn't hear any screaming?

142
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:25,990
No. I didn't hear anything.

143
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,700
 Is this really where she got stabbed? 

144
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:40,670
- Mr. Lee Ju Seok. 
 - Yes?

145
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:44,760
Do you remember what parts of your girlfriend's body was stabbed?

146
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,710
Throat, chest,

147
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:50,850
back, her sides, and abdomen.

148
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,060
It wasn't just one area.

149
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:55,370
- Even so, you didn't hear any screaming? 
 - No.

150
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:58,770
If that's the case, we know where she was stabbed first.

151
00:08:58,770 --> 00:08:59,730
Her lungs.

152
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:02,660
Do you think you can

153
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,570
look at her wounds?

154
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,520
Yes.

155
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,300
What kind of wound damaged her lungs, do you think?

156
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,910
I think you'll know since you're a medical student.

157
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,880
This one.

158
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:39,340
The wound on her back damaged her lungs.

159
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:43,200
If that's the case, it's possible she was attacked from behind.

160
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,220
If that's the case, Seon Hui wouldn't have had time to scream.

161
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:51,670
If your lungs are punctured, you can't scream.

162
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,480
She must have been in so much pain.

163
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,560
It's my fault.

164
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,580
My fault.

165
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,180
Lee Ju Seok.

166
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,250
Yes.

167
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:10,360
We need proof that you weren't there.

168
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,710
Even little details can help. So think carefully.

169
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:20,220
Well, maybe this is useful?

170
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,660
Tell me.

171
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:25,920
There was an idol fan signing event happening while I was on the main road.

172
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,950
I could have been photographed in the background while passing by.

173
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:37,370
Okay. Let's check the CCTV footage nearby.

174
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:41,620
And, the fact that I was here,

175
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,080
don't tell Prosecutor Jang.

176
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,660
Okay.

177
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:49,210
Excuse me, prosecutor.

178
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,890
Does this mean you'll help me?

179
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:55,410
I don't care what happens to me.

180
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:59,940
I'll die of guilt anyway.

181
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:03,080
But the asshole who killed Seon Hui.

182
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,960
Please catch him.

183
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:09,810
We have to do at least that much for the person who died.

184
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:19,250
That's the kind of work I do.

185
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:23,660
And I'm not someone who came to believe your testimony.

186
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,620
We still don't know who the culprit is,

187
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:30,720
but I'll be sure to catch them.

188
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,370
The real culprit.

189
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,880
Will this suit your taste?

190
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,060
It's just to fill your stomach.

191
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:44,840
Taste doesn't matter when you're eating at a place like this.

192
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,450
I truly apologize.

193
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:49,890
Sorry for the inconvenience, but please be patient a little longer.

194
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:53,670
If you ever need anything, feel free to tell me.

195
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,440
Goodness. What is all this?

196
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,900
Is the District Attorney's Office an amusement park for your picnic?

197
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,720
- What? 
- Sir, this is my case.

198
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,880
Chief Kim asked me to take over. You're out.

199
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:13,620
Sir! Even kindergarteners don't lick someone else's food to claim it.

200
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:17,000
Isn't that so, Chairnan Jeon Il Bo?

201
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:26,600
- Come out. 
 - Okay.

202
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:35,290
Sir, I'll see you soon.

203
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:45,640
Hey, dumb bastard!  Think, will you?

204
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,930
- Think about what? 
 - Don't you get it?

205
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:52,770
Haven't you considered the effect on the country's economy if he gets locked up?!

206
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:57,930
Why should prosecutors worry about the economy? Transfer to the Ministry of Economy and Finance if you're that worried.

207
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:01,880
What? This bastard really does...

208
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:08,220
- What are you doing? 
 - A courageous prosecutor who removes the darkness of injustice.

209
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,920
A warm prosecutor who takes care of the powerless and marginalized.   (T.N.  He is quoting from the new prosector's oath of office. )

210
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,970
A fair prosecutor who only follows the truth.

211
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:17,460
An upright prosecutor who is tougher on himself.

212
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,920
What kind of prosecutor are you?

213
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,980
I know for a fact that I'm not a crazy prosecutor like you.

214
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,510
You crazy bastard.

215
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,710
Have a good day, sir.

216
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:37,550
Ah, you bastard, let's live quietly, quietly!

217
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,830
You're here. Living quietly is no fun.

218
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:43,490
- Min Su... 
 - It's okay.

219
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,350
- Lee Min Su. 
 - Okay.

220
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,350
- I will help you. 
  - With what?

221
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:50,980
- You're a free spirit. 
 - So?

222
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:55,200
Go to Gimsan. There's a vacant position now that Hui Wu and his minions are here.

223
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,910
I'll get you transferred there in the next personnel change.

224
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:02,990
I have that much influence, at least. In Gimsan, you can go fishing whenever you want and be free.

225
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,460
- Oh, Gimsan is nice. 
 -  You don't need to thank me.

226
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:09,860
I'll go to Gimsan, and you'll end up in jail.

227
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:14,910
Write me a letter to thank me for giving you time to self-reflect.

228
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,850
It's a joke. Joke.

229
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:26,960
How could I send you to jail?

230
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:31,330
What are you waiting for? You're here to wag your tail. Go and wag.

231
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:34,130
Crazy bastard.

232
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,560
Seonbae.

233
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:45,340
Oh, are you here? Gosh...

234
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,900
- Are you okay? 
 - Oh, of course.

235
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,360
How about having a late-night drink later?

236
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,250
Late at night? Let's go now and grab it.

237
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:59,420
I have to take care of something after Chief Jang leaves for the day.

238
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,800
What? Are you scheming behind Jang Il Hyeon's back?

239
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,130
Then I'll have to work overtime since it's been a while.

240
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:10,130
Okay. I'll let you know when I'm done.

241
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:27,800
  This is where it happened. No CCTV. 

242
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,340
 An alleyway not used very often by people. 

243
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:35,150
 The culprit is most likely well aware of this, 

244
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:40,050
 so he was able to pull out the knife without hesitation even in broad daylight. 

245
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:55,020
 He aimed precisely at the lungs from behind, so that the victim couldn't even scream. 

246
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:59,080
 The culprit must be someone who has experience killing people. 

247
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:07,260
 Yes, Prosecutor. 

248
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:10,950
- How have you been? 
-  Good, and you?

249
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:12,740
But what's the matter?

250
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:15,880
I have a job that needs to be handled quietly, but I'm a little short-handed.

251
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,680
Just speak. Gimsan is light on work these days.

252
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,620
 I'll text you the address. 

253
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:25,440
Please compile a list of ex-offenders in the area who committed violent crimes in the past.

254
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,170
 Yes, sir. I'll send the list over as soon as it's ready. 

255
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:31,000
Thank you!

256
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:40,470
They had an argument here.

257
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:48,010
Then he smoked by the main road over there and was possibly caught on camera.

258
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,640
 - Seon Hui.
 - Let go. 

259
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,420
 I said, I'm sorry. 

260
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,830
 - What's the matter? 
 - Let's break up. 

261
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:57,750
 - Just because you want to?
 - Yes. 

262
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,850
 Fine! 

263
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:33,900
I'll have to check all the CCTVs around here.

264
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:38,590
 Again My Life 

265
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:47,280
- Are you here? 
 - No.

266
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,310
How about here?

267
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,830
Not here either.

268
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:53,170
Then let's go to the next one.

269
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:59,510
Wait. Here!

270
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,790
You're right.

271
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:16,620
An idol group held a fan signing event in the area that day.

272
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,190
I was standing further over there.

273
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:21,470
Let's keep watching the video.

274
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:25,860
There, prosecutor. Here!

275
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:30,890
Can we use this to prove that I'm innocent?

276
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:33,400
We've overcome one hurdle now,

277
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:39,250
but catching the real culprit is the only definite way to prove your innocence.

278
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:48,170
- What is a prosecutor? 
 - What?

279
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,280
Are we a legal criminal organization or what?

280
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:54,050
Gosh. Being a prosecutor sure isn't easy.

281
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:57,290
Are you upset about what happened earlier?

282
00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:00,560
That jerk thinks he can lecture me just because he's my senior.

283
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:05,180
He's coddling a criminal to cover up the Mirae Electronics case.

284
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:08,370
Mirae Electronics' CEO is a big shot. It won't be easy.

285
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:11,600
If he were easy, it'd be no fun.

286
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,950
You're not saying you'll give up.

287
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,720
Of course not.

288
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,880
- Did you get everything done? 
 - Yes.

289
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,650
Do you think you can catch the real culprit?

290
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:33,590
- You knew? 
 - There are only two things that I don't know.

291
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:37,300
What women think and what you think.

292
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:43,300
Too bad. I think I know how you think.

293
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:48,960
I'm easy, that's why. I'm the same inside and out.

294
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,350
Assemblyman Lee Jae Hun.

295
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:00,450
- Did you do a background check on me? 
-  Because I wanted to trust you.

296
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:04,010
- You wanted to trust me? 
 - I wanted to know what kind of person you were.

297
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:06,670
I had to confirm.

298
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:09,860
- I'm sorry. 
- Not a problem.

299
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:13,120
- So, now you trust me? 
- Yes.

300
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,230
That's odd. The brother that I know

301
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:20,110
would've felt hostility toward me as soon as he heard my father's name.

302
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,940
He wasn't exactly a clean politician, you know.

303
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:26,990
He had a successful political career, but he was involved in a number of corruption scandals and sex crimes.

304
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:31,740
He was framed by someone, wasn't he?

305
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:34,990
How did you know?

306
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:39,090
All his case files are gone.

307
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:41,760
The files are gone,

308
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:47,150
but there are people who remember what happened.

309
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,000
Wait.

310
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,540
I can't think straight right now.

311
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:58,520
Let me ask you two questions so I can gather my thoughts.

312
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:02,270
- When did you look into this? 
- When I was in Gimsan.

313
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:04,460
Why are you telling me this when you really didn't need to?

314
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:07,710
Because I'm convinced that we share the same goal.

315
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:10,870
- What is my goal? 
 - Jo Tae Seop.

316
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,400
Later...

317
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:29,260
Someday,

318
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:35,850
I hope I can tell you everything.

319
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:43,420
I'll look forward to that day.

320
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,260
Let's drink.

321
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,580
- Yeon Seok. 
- Yes.

322
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,710
Hey, tell Sang Man to come down for dinner.

323
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:03,770
Don't make him come down here. He's been helping Hui Wu for the past few days until he's nearly sick.

324
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:07,810
Really? Then hold on a sec.

325
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,940
You should go and grab a bite too.

326
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:13,750
- May I? 
 - The dinner rush is over. Relax and enjoy the food.

327
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:21,610
Yeon Seok, let's go. There's nothing like braised chicken after a long, hard day.

328
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:23,690
What? Are you going with him?

329
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:29,470
Of course. I must serve this delicious braised chicken to the young hardworking men who are helping our son.

330
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,970
- Wait a minute. 
- What?

331
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:34,110
Put your foot on the chair.

332
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:37,380
You're so bossy. Here.

333
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,150
- The right foot. 
 - Goodness. What's with you?

334
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,540
Fine. Here. What's the problem?

335
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,520
Why do you need this?

336
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,820
What is that doing there?

337
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,170
Figures. You were behaving for the past few days.

338
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:59,400
Don't get the wrong idea. I just wanted to cheer up the young men.

339
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,240
Do you know when a man feels the most pitiful?

340
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,290
When he realizes that he doesn't have soju while eating meat after a long, hard day.

341
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:08,840
Really?

342
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:13,670
Here. Take this and enjoy your dinner with Sang Man.

343
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:16,450
He'll clean and close up today.

344
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:18,200
- Thank you.
 - No problem.

345
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,210
- Hey, Yeon Seok!

346
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:21,970
- You!

347
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:24,120
- What? 
- I need to talk to you.

348
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,910
About what?

349
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,280
Let's split up.

350
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,690
Sure, whatever.

351
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:34,600
Today! Let's split up immediately! Right now.

352
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,200
Then we'll meet again tomorrow.

353
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,940
I love you.

354
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,190
I'm so embarrassed.

355
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:53,580
Who writes comments like this?

356
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:56,940
Have some food first.

357
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,400
- What's all this? 
- Ah, dongsaeng  (younger sibling) ,

358
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,720
you wouldn't understand even if I explained what the cyber task force does.

359
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,550
Is it going well?

360
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,710
- You're here. 
- Yes.

361
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,210
Look at you, our comment management task force.

362
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:21,680
So? Is everything moving smoothly?

363
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,900
"Comment management task force"? Come on. I'm a pro.

364
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,810
Okay, I deleted those comments.

365
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:32,240
Jang Il Hyeon will probably upload more malicious comments.

366
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,220
A college student's future depends on this, so focus and don't let your guard down, okay?

367
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:39,790
I've never let my guard down. I'm tightening my sphincter muscles as I speak.

368
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:41,760
Good for you.

369
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,730
It wasn't me. It came from here.

370
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:56,600
Have some food, online comments manager.

371
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,680
I'm the head of the cyber task force.

372
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:03,240
Here, one more. Open wide, online comments manager.

373
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,000
The cyber...

374
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:20,720
You've come.

375
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,520
I had a meeting today with the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy.

376
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,680
Yes, I heard.

377
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:30,660
The Korean semiconductor industry should be leading the world now,

378
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:34,650
but the competition among the domestic companies has been costing them too much.

379
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:39,520
When it comes to technology, fierce competition spurs innovation and development.

380
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:45,030
Right. I understand that competition is good for the industry, but coexistence is equally important.

381
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,710
Right.

382
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:51,210
Speaking of which, don't you think Mirae Automobile's decision to end

383
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:55,200
their affiliation with Mirae Electronics

384
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,710
was made too hastily?

385
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:02,100
The two companies can and should grow together.

386
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:05,500
Look at the bigger picture and re-consider the decision.

387
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:10,500
The thing is, the group has already finalized the decision.

388
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:14,280
Hello, sir.

389
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,750
Hui Ah, good to see you.

390
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:21,660
I heard you're now the head of Chunha Economic Research Institute. Congratulations!

391
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,340
Thank you.

392
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:27,850
I'm sorry to interrupt, but my father has to take his medication on time.

393
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:33,180
As I get older, the only thing which increases is the number of pills I have to take for my blood pressure and heart.

394
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:38,160
You're leading the economy of this country. You must always look after your health.

395
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:42,770
I'm glad you're here.  Get me the analysis on Mirae Electronics' semiconductor department.

396
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:44,740
Yes, sir.

397
00:26:54,290 --> 00:27:00,030
The decision was made based on our in-depth research and prediction analysis from different perspectives.

398
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:02,810
Can you explain it to him?

399
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:08,270
Yes, sir. As you know, sir, many semiconductor technologies are used to make a car.

400
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:12,710
So the key is using semiconductors that incorporate reliable and confirmed technology

401
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:17,690
and Chunha Electronics' technologies surpass Mirae Electronics' in various aspects.

402
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:20,720
If you read that, you can confirm the data.

403
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,800
I see.

404
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,560
Now that Mirae Automobiles belongs to Chunha Group,

405
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:31,680
we believe that focusing on safety and cost-effectiveness is more important than sticking to what is customary.

406
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:36,710
That is something you always emphasized too, sir.

407
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:40,820
Your daughter is such a bright young lady.

408
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:45,150
She sure is qualified to be the next leader of Chunha.

409
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:47,540
Your brother must be nervous.

410
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,340
No, sir.

411
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:01,420
 I emailed you the list you asked for. 

412
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,550
 Look at this.  

413
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,220
Hey, Gyu Ri!

414
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,330
It's been a long time.

415
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:23,280
Yes. Good to see you. How have you been?

416
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,960
Good, of course.

417
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,990
What brings you here at this time of day?

418
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:31,520
Aren't you busy?

419
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,240
Hold on.

420
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:38,330
Take a look at this.

421
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,860
 Prosecution Service 

422
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,710
What's this?

423
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:45,840
It's about a case.

424
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,690
- A case? 
 - Yes.

425
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:55,330
- This is... 
- It's about the college girl's murder,  which was all over the news recently.

426
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:58,590
So you want me to represent the accused in the case?

427
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:00,070
Yes, sir.

428
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:06,450
I'm sure you're not asking me to fight to lose. What makes you think this is winnable?

429
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:09,590
There is a lot of uncertainty in the evidence saying the client is the murderer.

430
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:13,800
And also there is evidence that he wasn't at the murder site at the time.

431
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:18,610
That is insufficient. Even if you push it, there's no guarantee he will win.

432
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:22,340
Perhaps the reason the client left the scene was to purchase a knife.

433
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:26,570
There is no place selling knives of that size within one kilometer of the site.

434
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:29,860
He was on good terms with his girlfriend before the murder,

435
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:32,360
so it would be difficult to say he secretly hid the knife in advance in a premeditated crime.

436
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,770
That's no different. It's not good enough for concrete evidence.

437
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:38,690
If it is true that the client murdered his girlfriend in this heartless way,

438
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:43,590
what will happen if, without any remorse, he denies the killing?

439
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:48,180
I don't wish to defend such a person.

440
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,210
If you were also a lawyer, you would understand.

441
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:54,840
That dirty feeling of defending a criminal who should never be forgiven.

442
00:29:54,840 --> 00:30:00,920
If I were a lawyer... when I assert that an innocent victim was guilty,

443
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:04,880
I would feel even dirtier.

444
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:11,240
I knew it. You were meant to be a lawyer!

445
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,810
So you'll accept the case?

446
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:21,400
Okay. It'll be a tough fight, but let's try.

447
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,680
Thank you.

448
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:27,250
My firm doesn't exactly have a good rapport with the prosecution.

449
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:29,450
You're aware of this, right?

450
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:33,440
The side that loses will take a big hit.

451
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:38,050
But if we win, we'll gain a lot.

452
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:44,250
Come to order.

453
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:52,630
Case Number 2017-GH-19273. We will now begin the trial.

454
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:58,450
This photo was taken when the accused was standing by the main road after arguing with his girlfriend.

455
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:01,860
An idol group's fan signing event was taking place in the area.

456
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,940
This shows the accused who happened to be walking by

457
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:07,700
while the fan club members were taking the photo.

458
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,700
This photo was taken at 16:27.

459
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:15,780
The accused called an ambulance at 16:28:52.

460
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:21,020
Do you think he could have run back, stabbed her, and called an ambulance in 1 minute and 52 seconds?

461
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,750
That's certainly not enough time.

462
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,060
Your Honor.

463
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:27,460
It only takes a few seconds to kill someone.

464
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:32,650
The defense is distracting us by listing a bunch of numbers.

465
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:36,840
More importantly, from the moment of his arrest on-site and until now, the defendant—

466
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,990
- You're here. 
-  has not shown any sign of remorse. 

467
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:43,630
I'm sure you wouldn't have invited me to a fight you would lose.

468
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:47,440
- How do you plan on catching him? 
  - You don't see any bloodstains on the defendant's hands. 

469
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,800
- See for yourself. 
 - If he had killed someone,  

470
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,170
would he have such clean clothes?

471
00:31:55,660 --> 00:32:00,170
Here, we have a clear imprint of the defendant's fingerprints.

472
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:04,810
Let me add that no other fingerprints were found on this besides the defendant's.

473
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:08,890
Additionally, there were no signs of the victim resisting.

474
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:13,360
The fact that she didn't resist is proof that she knew the assailant.

475
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,500
I submit this as evidence.

476
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,850
It's been confirmed that the victim was stabbed once,

477
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:26,880
exactly in her lungs. This led to her instant death, in which she couldn't even scream.

478
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:32,930
It's highly likely that the culprit is someone who is experienced with knives.

479
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:34,870
I object, Your Honor.

480
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,880
The defendant is a medical student.

481
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,980
He knows the human anatomy better than anyone.

482
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:43,000
Objection sustained.

483
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,280
Kim Gyu Ri?

484
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:43,550
Your Honor, the real culprit of this case has been caught.

485
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:04,680
Therefore, in accordance with Article 255 of the Criminal Procedure Act, the prosecution team

486
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:09,160
withdraws the prosecution.

487
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:14,660
Quiet. Be quiet everyone.

488
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:22,080
This was it, wasn't it?

489
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:39,150
Now spill it, who wants to go first?

490
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:41,570
 Prosecutor Kim Gyu Ri of the Eastern District Prosecutor's Office, arrests the real culprit in the female college student murder case! 

491
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:45,420
Hui Wu came to me a week ago and asked me to request a case.

492
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,720
 Requesting a case  
 1 week ago 

493
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,950
- Requesting a case? 
 - Yes.

494
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:51,950
There's something suspicious, so I wanted to ask you to check it out.

495
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:54,530
I think there's a real culprit somewhere.

496
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:56,400
Why are you asking me?

497
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:02,030
Director Jang Il Hyeon from my department is in charge of the case, so for me to step in directly is a bit...

498
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:05,020
- It's a case that Director Jang Il Hyeon is in charge of? 
 - Yes.

499
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:08,880
Of course, I know it's a burden on you,

500
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,280
because you might end up fighting head to head with Director Jang Il Hyeon.

501
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:15,210
I'll do it.

502
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:20,230
If the real culprit is this bastard like you said, we need to get him.

503
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:22,580
I knew it.

504
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,220
Thank you.

505
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:27,690
Kang Deok Gu...

506
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:29,770
Look at this bastard.

507
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:33,740
Forced molestation, sexual assault, and battery, rape.

508
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:39,090
- This bastard is a piece of trash, this asshole. 
 - Seonbae,

509
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:40,780
calm down on the swearing.

510
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:43,740
Even if I'm the only one here listening, don't you think you're going too far?

511
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,710
Whatever.

512
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:48,570
- Prosecutor Gu Seung Hyeok. 
 - Yes?

513
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:50,220
- Follow me. 
 - Excuse me?

514
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,770
Where are we going?

515
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:54,630
We're going to the Yangpyeong area. There's a murder case reported.

516
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:57,010
Murder case!? Where is it? Let's go.

517
00:35:57,010 --> 00:35:58,650
Stop!

518
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:02,720
It's a top-secret investigation, so don't go over the top.

519
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,150
You could ruin things by acting without thinking. This is a warning.

520
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:08,590
Okay. I'll be careful.

521
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:10,830
- Let's go. 
 - Yes!

522
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:12,770
You're doing it again!

523
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,440
There's nothing around here, and I don't see anyone passing by.

524
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,800
It's a perfect place to dump a body.

525
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:48,470
By the way, we're here to collect evidence, not to arrest,

526
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:52,710
- so look carefully and tell me the moment you see anything suspicious. 
 - Okay.

527
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,310
Let's go.

528
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:12,240
Does he ever tire?

529
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:18,730
It's already been four hours but I don't see anything special.

530
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:21,600
Is it too much to search with just two of us?

531
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:26,100
Prosecutor Gu, let's wrap it up for today.

532
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:29,180
No, let's look a little longer.

533
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,560
That klutz...

534
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,150
Gu Seung Hyeok, are you okay?

535
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,800
Gu Seung Hyeok!

536
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:47,870
What is it!?

537
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:51,100
Over... there...

538
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:03,680
- Yes? 
 -  Hey, Hui Wu, 

539
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:07,640
we just found an unidentified body at the place you mentioned.

540
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:11,500
However, there's no evidence to connect this to Kang Deok Gu. What should I do?

541
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,770
I'll find the evidence. Just keep this information secure for a while.

542
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:15,790
Okay.

543
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:19,800
We'll keep the body secret for now and request an autopsy from the National Forensic Service,

544
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,180
and I'll also start a stakeout.

545
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,900
Okay, thank you.

546
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,340
Sure. Good luck.

547
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:56,130
Are you here to eat!?

548
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:58,520
Stop eating so much, you idiot.

549
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:18,310
- Hey, wake up, now! Now! 
 - What, what is it?

550
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:19,640
Kang Deok Gu!

551
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,770
We can't lose him. Get going.

552
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:24,510
He's going. He's going! He's going!

553
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:28,050
- Why is it doing this? 
 - I said get going!

554
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,520
Can you tell where he's going?

555
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,520
Misa-ri?

556
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,200
Okay, try following him.

557
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,820
He's a very dangerous person, so don't get too close,

558
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:45,420
and if you find anything strange at all, request backup right away.

559
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:51,010
Do not, and I mean  do not  intervene.

560
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:52,920
Do you understand? Yeah.

561
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,080
Hey, Sang Man.

562
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,980
Let's go.

563
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,870
Slowly.

564
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:02,890
Kang Deok Gu!

565
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:08,790
I'm Prosecutor Kim Kyu Ri of the Eastern Prosecutors' Office. You're under arrest for the murders of multiple women.

566
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:39,760
You have the right to an attorney and you'll have an opportunity to explain.

567
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,220
You have the right to remain silent and refuse to answer questions.

568
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:47,020
From now on, anything you say may be used against you in court.

569
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:51,800
Hyeong, we arrested Kang Deok Gu.

570
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:05,750
These are the victims we believe you murdered.

571
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:11,670
It's so nice to see them like this.

572
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:17,580
She had pretty feet.

573
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,700
She had nice hair.

574
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:25,810
And this one's hands were so smooth.

575
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,050
And this one...

576
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:29,590
 -  What's wrong? 
- Let's just stop. 

577
00:45:29,590 --> 00:45:30,820
 What's going on? 

578
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:32,570
 Let's break up. 

579
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:34,870
 - Just like that? 
- Yes. 

580
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:37,170
 Okay! Let's break up then! 

581
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:47,140
Her sharp voice was so attractive.

582
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:49,770
That's why I killed her.

583
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:52,110
That's why she died.

584
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:57,810
I see. That's how it happened?

585
00:45:57,810 --> 00:45:58,920
Well done!

586
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,660
Actually, I should thank you.

587
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:04,380
I caught a serial killer thanks to you.

588
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:05,850
But Kim Hui Wu,

589
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:09,990
what made you suspect Kang Deok Gu as the real culprit?

590
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:14,190
That was before we got the autopsy result for one of his victims.

591
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:17,440
Oh, that? I got lucky when I was investigating my case.

592
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:20,740
How did you know the dead body was in Yangpyeong?

593
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,170
I really didn't like what Jang Il Hyeon was up to.

594
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:28,230
It started off as a simple suspicion. I was just lucky.

595
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:30,500
Really?

596
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,790
I thought you were some kind of psychic.

597
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,580
I bet it's a hunch of a competent prosecutor.

598
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:39,140
But everyone knows that Seonbae has the best hunches.

599
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:43,550
Gosh. Seriously, Hui Wu. Even your flattery is on another level.

600
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:48,720
I should get going first. I need to identify the rest of the victims.

601
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,670
See you around, Seonbae.

602
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:51,020
See you. Good luck with the case.

603
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:53,150
- See you later.
 - Yes.

604
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:57,940
Okay. Then I'll get going too.

605
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:00,360
Already? Why?

606
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,720
We should get a cup of coffee.

607
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:04,690
What are you talking about? I don't have time for that.

608
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:06,940
I need to wrap up the Mirae Electronics case.

609
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:10,760
Wait. Did you get the case back?

610
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:14,050
Not yet. But I will get it back at some point.

611
00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:17,100
Chief Prosecutor Kim's plan to bury the Mirae Electronics case

612
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:20,700
using the college girl murder case is ruined.

613
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:24,540
Then the Mirae Electronics case will be in the limelight again.

614
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:28,780
He will put me back on the case before the public finds out he switched the prosecutor in charge.

615
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:33,200
He hates it when people badmouth him.

616
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,790
Probably.

617
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:37,530
Anyway, what's next for you, Hui Wu?

618
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:40,130
In my opinion, you're preparing for an even bigger event.

619
00:47:40,130 --> 00:47:43,430
It's not like you to end things this prematurely. Right?

620
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:47,960
Exactly. Where's the fun in showing all my cards in the trailer?

621
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:50,260
Of course.  I'll look forward to that.

622
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:52,830
- Bye. 
- See you.

623
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:09,930
 I saw the breaking news. 

624
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:13,520
I knew it.. You are something else, Prosecutor  Kim.

625
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:17,150
Could you tell me your secret? I won't tell anyone.

626
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:18,670
There's no secret.

627
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:22,540
It's all thanks to you, Investigator Oh. Thank you.

628
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:26,280
It's my honor to contribute to catching a serial killer.

629
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,980
I'll call you again before long.

630
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:30,830
I would like to politely decline it.

631
00:48:30,830 --> 00:48:32,400
Sorry?

632
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:34,930
It was a joke.

633
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:37,990
I will welcome your calls anytime.

634
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:42,630
Thank you. Bye bye.

635
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:48,560
 I emailed you what you asked me to look into. 

636
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,850
 Jungjin-gu, Seoul List of Violent Convicts 
 

637
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,860
 Look at this. 

638
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:58,730
 It's the notorious serial killer, Kang Deok Gu. 
 [ Kang Deok Gu / 34 years old / 172 cm / 68 kg 

639
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,200
 I didn't think I would come across him with this case.
  

640
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:06,730
- Prosecutor Jang Il Hyeon! 
- Prosecutor Jang!

641
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:09,290
- The defendant was acquitted.!
 - One comment!

642
00:49:09,290 --> 00:49:10,820
A comment, please!

643
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:13,890
What will you do about this case?

644
00:49:13,890 --> 00:49:15,630
A comment, please!

645
00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:18,070
Prosecutor Jang!

646
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:20,500
A comment, please!

647
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:34,020
I'm sorry. 
  Has Mirae Electronics Slush Fund Also Entered the Political Arena? 

648
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,350
Your failure to wrap up a case ruined everything.

649
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:41,580
I'm ashamed of myself.

650
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:46,420
The reputation of Korea's prosecutors is in the gutter. The CEO of Mirae Electronics, Jeon Il Bo's case resurfaced

651
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:51,770
as soon as Kang Deok Gu was arrested as if they had been waiting all along.

652
00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:54,810
That means the press saw through our moves.

653
00:49:58,050 --> 00:49:59,720
Yes?

654
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:02,140
What?

655
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,200
Turn on the TV.

656
00:50:07,490 --> 00:50:11,730
 We could not repress the shock from the prosecution's double standard. 

657
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:14,950
 Their shoddy investigation caused an innocent man to be accused of murder. 

658
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:19,780
 But it has come to surface that they showed leniency in a conglomerate corruption investigation. 

659
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:22,590
 Who does Korea's prosecution serve? 

660
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:25,870
 Please make your stance clear! 

661
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:27,220
 We at Daehan Party... 

662
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:31,300
Call Public Information. Tell them to release articles that we won't go easy on the rich.

663
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:35,230
Put Lee Min Su back on the case before people start to talk.

664
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:39,030
Yes, sir. I will do as you say.

665
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,960
I got the file from the financial director of Hosan Chemicals, who bribed Jang Il Hyeon.

666
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:57,280
The funds his son used to buy an apartment in Gangnam seem a bit suspicious.

667
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,660
We found a good lead. Thank you for your help.

668
00:51:02,590 --> 00:51:06,230
Here. This is a lead for admissions corruption at the National University Arts Foundation.

669
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:11,120
The kids of famous people entered the school every year by manipulating the scores of practical exams and interviews.

670
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:15,270
From high-ranking government officials, lawmakers, city councilors, to NIS employees,

671
00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:19,070
just one word from them, and the foundation took care of the rest.

672
00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:22,410
And I was able to get evidence of corruption on Seong Jin Mi.

673
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:25,520
This must have been a lot of work. Thank you.

674
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,670
I didn't mind the work. But I was just so shocked.

675
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:30,000
These people had nothing to fear.

676
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,860
When I kept digging, I kept finding more dirt. I bet they don't even think this is a problem.

677
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:36,430
All right. So what's your plan for the future?

678
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:42,360
First of all, the connection between Kim Seok Hoon and Jang Il Hyeon must be completely severed.

679
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:46,530
And you will be the cause.

680
00:51:46,530 --> 00:51:48,950
- Me? 
 - Yes.

681
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:53,750
Jang Il Hyeon will probably pay you a visit.

682
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:05,370
What brings you here?

683
00:52:05,370 --> 00:52:08,730
I heard you've been investigating National Foundation for the Arts University.

684
00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:11,030
I'll cut to the chase.

685
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:16,210
I will soon marry Chairwoman Seong Jin Mi of the National Foundation for the Arts University.

686
00:52:16,210 --> 00:52:17,120
Is that so?

687
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:22,050
That's why I'm bringing this up.  The investigation you are doing... I want you to stop.

688
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:26,160
I understand where you're coming from, but I can't do that.

689
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:31,740
I'm ashamed to admit it, but I came to Seoul and haven't accomplished anything.

690
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:37,960
Don't you want to join  Chief Prosecutor Kim's side?

691
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:41,630
I hope you and I can belong to the same club.

692
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:44,730
But with a matter this unsavory,

693
00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:48,390
I don't think that's possible.

694
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,870
I understand what you mean.

695
00:52:55,870 --> 00:52:58,420
Then I'll stop here.

696
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:03,020
Then I hope our relationship can continue to stay amicable.

697
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:08,610
 Kim Seok Hun 

698
00:53:08,610 --> 00:53:10,830
As if losing the trial wasn't enough,

699
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:14,540
how dare he drop my name to stop an ongoing investigation?

700
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,290
 Yes, Chief Prosecutor Kim 

701
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:21,720
Call Division Chief Jeon here.

702
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:30,840
- Did you ask to see me? 
 - Yes.

703
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,850
So you've been investigating National  Foundation for the Arts University.

704
00:53:32,850 --> 00:53:37,540
Sorry? Oh, yes, sir.

705
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:39,090
I was, but...

706
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:41,210
What is it? Something happen?

707
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:44,360
Well, Department Chief Jang asked me to stop—

708
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:49,130
You're a prosecutor, trying to catch criminals. You don't have to worry about him.

709
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:51,640
You can smell corruption from the foundation a mile away, right?

710
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,410
Yes. It's pretty bad.

711
00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:55,410
Okay. Do you have any evidence?

712
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:56,380
I have it.

713
00:53:56,380 --> 00:54:00,470
Request a search warrant now.  Investigate thoroughly and find every single crime they've committed.

714
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:01,890
Don't forget to report to me.

715
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:04,820
Yes, I understand.

716
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:18,840
What on earth is this now?!

717
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:22,810
A search warrant for National Foundation for the Arts University?!

718
00:54:22,810 --> 00:54:24,000
Oh! Did it already get issued?

719
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,540
You told me that you would back up. You went behind my back?!

720
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:30,570
I see. Is your nickname "Bat"?

721
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:32,610
You clearly told me you would back off!

722
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:34,370
- I was going to. 
 - Then what?

723
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:38,060
Chief Prosecutor Kim told me to keep investigating.

724
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:39,830
Chief Prosecutor Kim did?

725
00:54:39,830 --> 00:54:42,460
 Are you sure that's what he told you? 

726
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:45,180
 No. I don't remember him telling me about that. 

727
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:48,090
 You're just trying to ruin me now, aren't you?! 

728
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:50,030
 As you may be well aware, 

729
00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:54,150
the press has been running stories that we've been covering up cases.

730
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:58,330
So Chief Prosecutor Kim is paying a lot of attention to my investigation now.

731
00:54:58,330 --> 00:55:04,630
I couldn't bring myself to tell him that you asked me to drop the investigation.

732
00:55:04,630 --> 00:55:08,220
Should I go over there and tell him that now?

733
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:12,540
And...

734
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:18,240
- you'd better watch out, you little shit. 
 - What?

735
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:21,720
How dare you raise your voice in front of your senior?

736
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,940
 The Prosecutor General is on the line. 

737
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:45,180
Yes, Prosecutor General.

738
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:47,610
How could you fail to take care of the Mirae Electronics case?

739
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:48,650
I'm sorry.

740
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:52,270
Chief Prosecutor Kim, is this your leadership problem?

741
00:55:52,270 --> 00:55:55,220
I'll take care of it as soon as possible.

742
00:56:03,490 --> 00:56:06,120
 The Secretary at the Blue House is on the line. 

743
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:11,560
This is Kim Seok Hun speaking.

744
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:13,820
 I've been hearing a lot of chatter lately. 

745
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:16,540
 People are already demanding reform in the prosecution. 

746
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:19,460
There's nothing we can do to stop them.

747
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:23,680
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have let it get past me.

748
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:29,320
Chief Prosecutor Kim. Forget about becoming Prosecutor General now.

749
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:33,850
 Perhaps, even your current position should be reconsidered. 

750
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:38,290
 I'm saying everyone has their place based on their competence. 

751
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:41,330
But we won't neglect the hard work you put in.

752
00:56:41,330 --> 00:56:43,410
Taking a break can be an option too.

753
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:03,550
 The prosecution is now trying to prove the charges against Mirae Electronics' former chairman. 

754
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:06,860
 He said he had concrete evidence 

755
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:11,170
 and dismissed the possibility of his release. 

756
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:15,480
If Mr. Jeon were to get arrested,

757
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:21,170
my request for your help would be moot. Don't you agree?

758
00:57:21,170 --> 00:57:24,030
I'm ashamed of myself.

759
00:57:24,030 --> 00:57:26,440
So what brings you here?

760
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:29,290
The reputation of the prosecution is worsening day by day.

761
00:57:29,290 --> 00:57:33,820
I want to divert the public's attention.

762
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:36,760
Things must be tough for you.

763
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,860
I need your help, sir.

764
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:43,590
People take things for granted when I continue to be generous.

765
00:57:43,590 --> 00:57:48,410
So when they are in a predicament, they come to me and beg for my help.

766
00:57:48,410 --> 00:57:51,420
But how could I believe in you?

767
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:55,730
I'm sorry.  You should step down.

768
00:57:55,730 --> 00:57:57,630
Assemblyman.

769
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:02,660
I'm sorry, sir.

770
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:07,590
This will... This will never happen again.

771
00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:11,860
Prosecutor Kim.  Don't you know who gave you your position?

772
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:12,910
You, sir.

773
00:58:12,910 --> 00:58:15,540
I know your limit.

774
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:20,960
I will give you money and power that will satisfy you more than enough.

775
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,800
So bear this in mind.

776
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:27,450
You will have more than enough as long as you stick to what I give you.

777
00:58:27,450 --> 00:58:29,950
I will bear that in mind.

778
00:58:29,950 --> 00:58:32,180
Get up now.

779
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:34,180
- Director Han. 
- Yes, sir.

780
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:35,440
Do you have anything we can use?

781
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,480
There's a scandal regarding announcer hidden cameras.

782
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:39,520
Hidden cameras.

783
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:42,890
- Let's go with that. 
- Yes, sir.

784
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:46,650
I told you to get up. Now.

785
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:50,470
Thank you.

786
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:56,680
But to divert the public's attention completely from the corruption of Mirae Electronics,

787
00:58:56,680 --> 00:59:00,810
the announcer spy cam scandal won't be enough.

788
00:59:00,810 --> 00:59:04,230
Is there any other case you can use now?

789
00:59:04,230 --> 00:59:07,780
There's a corruption scandal behind National Foundation for the Arts University. I'll blow it up immediately.

790
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:13,960
If it's the National Foundation for the Arts University, a lot of people buy art from there as investments.

791
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:15,860
So make sure they aren't affected by this.

792
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:16,980
Yes, sir.

793
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:22,190
By the way, people already lost faith in the prosecution. What will you do about that?

794
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:25,820
You, especially, must be in a pickle.

795
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:28,580
I will make sure to redeem myself.

796
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:31,290
It's not about redeeming yourself.

797
00:59:31,290 --> 00:59:34,820
Why don't you offer up a fall guy who will take responsibility?

798
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:36,050
Responsibility?

799
00:59:36,050 --> 00:59:38,770
Why? Show the people that you can still be trustworthy.

800
00:59:38,770 --> 00:59:40,960
The credibility of the prosecution is fine.

801
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,620
A loach just clouded the water.

802
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:46,440
You set an example by catching the loach.

803
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:48,460
Simple, isn't it?

804
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:50,660
A loach?

805
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:54,280
 Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office 

806
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:58,620
 The scoop! Announcer Choi Min Jin! Hidden camera video leakage! 

807
01:00:09,990 --> 01:00:15,060
 When I was investigating corruption behind the foundation, I stumbled upon Chief Jang Il Hyeon's corruption as well. 

808
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:18,220
 It's pretty bad, so I'm reporting it to you. 

809
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:20,040
Come on in.

810
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:26,750
Did you want to see me?

811
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:28,600
Sure.

812
01:00:38,790 --> 01:00:39,870
What is this?

813
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:44,220
Recently, a prosecutor has brought disgrace to our entire organization.

814
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:47,790
And the same prosecutor has been taking bribes from conglomerates.

815
01:00:47,790 --> 01:00:50,010
You can guess who it is, right?

816
01:00:50,010 --> 01:00:51,180
Yes, sir.

817
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:55,130
Do you think you can take down Chief Jang Il Hyeon?

818
01:00:55,130 --> 01:00:59,030
I'm going after a colleague as well as a senior prosecutor.

819
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,920
I'll give you full authority. Keep the investigation under wraps.

820
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:07,330
Hui Wu, you are responsible for restoring the reputation of our organization.

821
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:09,820
Yes, sir.

822
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:17,190
This investigation is only between us. I expect you to end it as swiftly as possible.

823
01:01:17,190 --> 01:01:19,630
Yes, sir. I will.

824
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:29,940


825
01:01:37,450 --> 01:01:41,960
 Your lifeline has snapped, Jang Il Hyeon. 

826
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:52,680
♫  Dear, All your things you've done  ♫

827
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:55,920
♫  We are here to wreck it up  ♫

828
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:02,160
♫  Who knows, how will it go?  ♫

829
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:09,680
♫  Hiding in black and white  ♫

830
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:13,050
♫  We are here to find the truth  ♫

831
01:02:13,050 --> 01:02:18,310
♫  Give up, I warn you so  ♫

832
01:02:18,310 --> 01:02:21,590
 Again My Life 

833
01:02:21,590 --> 01:02:24,760
 The knife that is pointed at Jo Tae Seop. 
♫  Will I ever find out who you  ♫

834
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:27,480
 He's going to make people want to fight in the storm. 

835
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:30,320
 Live like Kim Hui Ah. 
  We'll catch him! 

836
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:32,560
 If it will make our nation stronger...! 

837
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:36,880
 It will make us stronger. 

838
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:40,380
♫   let me show you how to start  ♫

839
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:44,310
 Again My Life
