 Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu 

8
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:53,620
 Prosecutor 

9
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,870
 Someone is here to see you. 

10
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:58,140
 Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu? 

11
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,610
 Yes, sir. 

12
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,070
 I'm Jeon Seok Gyu from the Gimsan Branch. 

13
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,230
 Oh, nice to meet you. 

14
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,890
 Please have a seat. 

15
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,160
 You must be curious why I'm here to see you without advance notice. 

16
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,980
 Yes. 

17
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:28,440
 Ah! I heard a lot about your achievements during your time here. 

18
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,090
 That was a long time ago. 

19
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,340
 On that subject, I've heard a lot about you, Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu.  

20
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,370
 Everyone says you're even more persistent than I am. 

21
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:41,640
They may not show it, but many of your colleagues are rooting for you.

22
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,450
 Is that so?  

23
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:50,080
 I brought you what I've compiled while working in the branch offices. 

24
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,230
 I hope you find them helpful. 

25
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,970
 "Helpful"? 

26
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:58,910
 Investigating their corrupt deeds will lead you to the big shot behind them. 

27
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,070
 I'll leave,  then. 

28
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,760
 Let's 

29
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,360
 skip the unnecessary formalities. 

30
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,770
 Yes then, farewell.

 Breakdown of Jo Tae Seop-related Personnel Corruption 

33
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:53,870
 This lists all the corrupt deeds committed by Jo Tae Seop's minions. 

34
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:56,680
 How many years did it take him to compile this? 

35
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,600
 Don't say.  Is he also after Jo Tae Seop? 

36
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,920
Chief Jeon!

37
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,940
Chief Jeon!

38
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,900
Wait!

39
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,750
Thank you.

40
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,510
The information you gave me will be put to good use.

41
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:25,600
I'm going to quit being a prosecutor.

42
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,940
Prosecutor Kim, I truly hope you achieve your goal.

43
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:34,190
 You won't get a second chance. If you can't succeed on your first try, 

44
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:37,060
  you will fall hard, 

45
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,130
 like me. 

46
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:55,900
 Again My Life 

47
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,900
Don't do this again.

48
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:26,480
Nothing is more important than your life.

49
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,770
Yes, sir.

50
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:36,690
So... let's hear if you had a plan before causing this ruckus.

51
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:39,730
The most they'd get for starting an illegal casino is five years.

52
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,600
Once they have a puppet CEO, the case is closed.

53
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,390
Sure, if it were like any other gambling den.

54
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,900
What do you mean?

55
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,030
It's already spilled milk. So please leave it to me.

56
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:52,190
There's no way they're only engaging in this kind of business.

57
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:00,880
If you stomp around too hard, it'll probably leave footprints.

58
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,260
Do you think only the pure-hearted will follow them?

59
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:08,670
Don't put your life on the line. Do you understand?

60
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,240
Yes, sir.

61
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,570
- Bring them in. 
 - Yes, sir.

62
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,590
Let's go. Come on.

63
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,870
Come on.

64
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,640
Do Chang Su.

65
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,640
Yes?

66
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,660
Your daughter's name is Do Hwa Jin, right?

67
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,590
Yes.

68
00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:00,300
The dad accrued gambling debt and to pay it off, he sold his daughter.

69
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,760
 My dad got into debt because of gambling. 

70
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:07,030
 And he sold me to pay it off. 

71
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,400
 Well, he didn't actually sell me. He put me up as collateral. 

72
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:18,880
 My dad continued to gamble at that casino, even though I was stuck there as collateral. 

73
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,750
 Do you know why I'm not trying to stop him? 

74
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,780
 There's no hope. No hope. 

75
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,860
 Even if he sold all of his organs. 

76
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,010
 he'd just break even on the interest. 

77
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:38,410
 But beyond that, well... 

78
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,200
 But who knows? 

79
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,160
 If my dad wins a big sum... 

80
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,370
 A really big sum. 

81
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:57,040
 Then he might cook... some soybean paste stew for me like the old days. 

82
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:02,180
 Dad is a lousy gambler, 

83
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,220
 but he's a great cook. 

84
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:17,560
Cut off my wrists, please.

85
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,260
Then wouldn't I quit?

86
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,100
Please cut them off!

87
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,150
I heard you used to own a restaurant.

88
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,380
I also heard you were a good cook.

89
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:35,890
Use those hands to make some warm soybean paste stew

90
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,760
- and have a hearty meal with your daughter.
 - Sorry?

91
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:44,010
If you gamble but can maintain your daily life, you're not considered an addict.

92
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:48,470
Start by regaining control of your normal life.

93
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:51,160
We'll help you with the rest.

94
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,640
But... but the amount of debt I've accrued—

95
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,800
Gambling debts are not legally enforceable.

96
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,760
And the Yuchae Faction will be disbanded soon anyway.

97
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,140
Luckily, you're a first-time offender,

98
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:05,150
so you'll probably be released on probation.

99
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,340
- Let's give this a shot. 
 - Thank you!

100
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,430
I'll give it a shot!

101
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,920
Thank you.

102
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,410
Thank you. Thank you.

103
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:20,060
Thank you so much.

104
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:29,000
My goodness. All this money moved through a small-town casino?

105
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,930
It's unbelievable.

106
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,830
- How's it going? Have you found out anything? 
  - Yes, sir.

107
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:40,220
- Prosecutor,  we've got a problem here. 
 - What is it?

108
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:44,100
On paper, the money was sent to their own incorporated business, so we can't—

109
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,700
Hold on. Hyeong.

110
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,040
This must be it.

111
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,080
Take a look at this.

112
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,220
This was sent to Daemin as an investment,

113
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:00,030
but it was actually sent to Jangmi for their operating expenses.

114
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:03,660
Here, it says this money was invested in Yurim Corp, but it was actually sent to Mokran.

115
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:07,110
- The same amount, 20 million KRW. 
  - This is it.

116
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,680
Yes, that's right.

117
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,850
The two ledgers that Yuchae Faction hid.

118
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,760
Well done.

119
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,590
Investigator Oh, please get this organized while I interrogate them.

120
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:21,700
And let's haul in their boss, Moon Gu Jun, first thing in the morning.

121
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,400
Yes, sir.

122
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,970
- And as for you. I need you to go to Seoul now. 
 - Got it.

123
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:30,330
What? At this moment? But I pulled an all-nighter.

124
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:33,960
Oh, sure.  Investigator Oh, did you prepare the thing I requested earlier?

125
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,500
Oh, right, yes. Here it is.

126
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:44,170
Go to Seoul now, deliver this to the addressed person, and then you can go home and sleep all you want.

127
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:46,710
- "Reporter Kim Han Mi"? 
 - Yes.

128
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:50,700
Tell her I sent you, and she'll know what it's about.

129
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,130
Goodness. We don't have time. Get moving.

130
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:56,900
- Wake up. Hurry up. 
 - Gosh.

131
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,070
 Gangwon District Prosecutors' Office 

132
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,370
Now, all of you rise!

133
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:20,820
Yes, you will all hurry up and rise.

134
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,300
We will now begin interrogating you one at a time.

135
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,770
Beyond the gambling den incident,

136
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:35,740
I've pulled out every case for which the statute of limitations hasn't expired.

137
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,020
The longer you are uncooperative with the investigation,

138
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:42,070
the longer your sentence will grow, to put it bluntly.

139
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,350
What the...

140
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:52,810
Furthermore, your leader, Mun Gu Jun is going to be arrested,

141
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:56,550
so if you understand you have nowhere else to turn, your hearts will be at ease.

142
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,130
- Okay? 
 - Yes

143
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:04,380
It's Hyeong-nim, you bastards. He'll be on his way home after a meal.

144
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,610
Don't you have an elder at your residence, Prosecutor?

145
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:14,620
How dare you talk of an elder's name without even a nim (honorific) after? For shame!

146
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:20,410
I hope you have some manners when using your tongue.

147
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:25,560
What's this? Do you lack sense or are you just stupid?

148
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,360
- Investigator Oh. 
 - Yes.

149
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,650
this bastard needs no interrogation. Just keep him in for ten years.

150
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:34,100
If his sentence ends up being short, I'll be sure to fill it.

151
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,940
- Like that bastard the other time? 
 - Huh?

152
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,270
Oh, yeah. Like that bastard that time.

153
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,660
Yes, understood.

154
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,660
You. Keep your trap shut.

155
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:50,010
Excuse me—uh, Prosecutor Sir? Prosecutor Sir!

156
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:52,170
Quiet.

157
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:00,520
Sit down.  Sit down.

158
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,400
I get that this is your first time, being a rookie prosecutor, so your passions must've gotten ahead of you.

159
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,320
But even without studying law, we know that we're not going to be sentenced to many years over something like this.

160
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,160
I have nothing to say, so call me a lawyer.

161
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,300
Where are the women?

162
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,250
Women? What are you talking about?

163
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,010
The women who disappeared from the gambling den.

164
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,620
Weird things?

165
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:30,570
Now that I think of it, the young women who came to the gambling den would often disappear.

166
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:36,440
When I finished work, I noticed traces of their disappearance like their handbags or clothes.

167
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,210
But where their owners went, I have no idea.

168
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:42,360
Afterward, they didn't retrieve their belongings nor did they reappear.

169
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,270
They said you were the one who kidnapped them.

170
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:47,980
Wh-Who said so? Kidnapping wasn't my job. That bastard Hyeon Jeong was supposed to take care of all—

171
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:51,140
Ah, Hyeon Jong did it.

172
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,620
 Defendant Testimony 

173
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:57,460
Hey, Choi Hyeon Jong, what did you do with the kidnapped women?

174
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:01,070
- What?
 - What do you mean what?

175
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,400
They said that was your job.

176
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:07,650
Which bastard said that?!

177
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:12,120
Why? You didn't do it on your own?

178
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:17,530
Prosecutor, I have arrested Mun Gu Jun

179
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,820
- Yes, understood. 
 - Very well then.

180
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:29,540
Hey, you heard? Your boss is here.

181
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:33,540
So what? Think about it logically.

182
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:40,220
Do you honestly think your boss would say, "I did all of it. Please release my men"?

183
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:51,390
What. Will you take the entire blame and live in prison for human trafficking, too?

184
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:54,570
All the other kids will be released from prison on probation.

185
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,850
Excuse me, Prosecutor, I only did as I was ordered.

186
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,810
- Ordered? 
 - Yes.

187
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:04,910
- To kidnap the women. 
 - And?

188
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,040
After we kidnap them, we drug them.

189
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,450
Drugs?

190
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,960
- Illegal drugs?
 - Yes

191
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:16,120
We would inject them. The addicted ones were sold to the brothels.

192
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,190
How many up to this point?

193
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,390
About twenty?

194
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,710
 Cecilia 

195
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:55,020
 Milky Way, Cecilia, Susancho 

196
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:03,050
Investigator, please confirm the details  the women who work at the circled brothels

197
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:06,890
of the woman working at the circled brothels and run drug screens on them.

198
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:10,370
In particular, see if they have injection sites on their arms.

199
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:13,350
- All of them? 
 - Yes.

200
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:16,510
Human trafficking and illegal drug trafficking will be added charges

201
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:20,020
We must find the women who were wrongfully abused and kidnapped.

202
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,830
Understood.

203
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:25,410
- What about Mun Gu Jun? 
 - He's in the interrogation room.

204
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:46,240
Mr. Prosecutor, I haven't had my meal yet.

205
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,760
Give me the menu, please.

206
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:10,110
Hey, go eat this. You son of a dog.

207
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:15,750
What. Do you want another?

208
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,880
What kind of criminal bastard says that to a Korean prosecutor? What? You want a menu?

209
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,040
Hey, do you think this is a restaurant to order food from, you little shit?

210
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,660
You clearly can't read the room to save your life.

211
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:38,170
Even if heaven forgives you, you will get a life sentence. You know?

212
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:39,450
You.

213
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,720
You.

214
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:46,820
- I'm going to skin you alive myself—
 - You piece of...

215
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,130
Hey, hey Prosecutor, restrain yourself. Please.

216
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:51,440
No, no. Restrain yourself. You can do it.

217
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,290
- No, let go of me. Today I will skin this bastard.
 - You can't!

218
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:59,560
Restrain yourself. First, restrain yourself. You've been called by the regional prosecutor.

219
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,380
- Regional Prosecutor? 
 - Yes.

220
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:04,220
- Why?
 - I'm not sure.

221
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:11,090
Mr. Prosecutor, it looks like you have a lot to learn. That's how things are.

222
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:15,670
I'll order delivery food here. I'll eat that.

223
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:20,210
But I'll eat dessert at home.

224
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:22,490
That's how it is.

225
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:26,570
- This f*cking little...
 - Prosecutor!

226
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:29,420
Prosecutor, you mustn't. Restrain yourself.

227
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:33,020
Prosecutor! Go ahead with your other work.

228
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,580
No, no.

229
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:39,110
- Investigator. 
 - Yes.

230
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:42,210
This son of a b*tch... doesn't get any kibble today.

231
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:43,920
Yes.

232
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:52,740
 Gimsan Regional Prosecutors' Office 
 Regional Prosecutor Office 

233
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,210
 Chief Jeon, what are you trying to pull? 

234
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:59,860
Please calm down everyone and listen to me first.

235
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:02,380
Does it look like we can calm down right now?

236
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,730
Come in.

237
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:16,980
I'm Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu.

238
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:22,000
Do you realize what you have done?

239
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,250
Yes, I do.

240
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,540
I did my job as a prosecutor.

241
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,970
Prosecutor Kim.

242
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:31,690
Sure, you can't know everything from just law school alone.

243
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:33,400
But that is the nature of law.

244
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,800
Taking one code and applying it equally across different situations,

245
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,260
it's an oxymoron.

246
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:41,710
It's up to the local leaders to be flexible in how they apply them

247
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:43,590
according to the circumstances.

248
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:46,100
We're talking about the local economy here.

249
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,420
Do you think they're only engaged in that kind of business?

250
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:53,380
Who do you think is supporting the city's economy and creating jobs for people so they can put food on the table?

251
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:58,030
If you keep this up, the city's economy will collapse.

252
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:02,690
Prosecutor Kim, take it easy and focus on getting to Seoul.

253
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:05,180
You're all absolutely right.

254
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:08,290
Chief Jeon, aren't you going to manage your subordinates better?

255
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:09,800
About the Yuchae Faction too.

256
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:14,540
The thugs in this area have been quiet because this region is under the Yuchae Faction's control.

257
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:18,550
If you round up the kids now, all the riffraff will come back.

258
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,960
Then things will really get out of control!

259
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,780
Furthermore, they say over twenty are injured currently.

260
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,230
If this isn't an overreaching investigation, what else would be?

261
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:33,060
There was some conflict during the arrest, I know there was no overreach or breach of the law.

262
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,700
And there was just one prosecutor on our side.

263
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,460
Chief Jeon!

264
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:39,990
You clearly haven't come to your senses yet.

265
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:45,000
Wasn't this why you were thrown out by your in-laws' and ended up in this small branch office in Gimsan?

266
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,720
Chief Jeon.

267
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,840
Stop going on about the law. Get off your high horse so we can all live peacefully.

268
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:02,760
The law is... a set of rules that the nation has the right to enforce.

269
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:08,090
Mr. Assemblyman, Mayor, and Chief. If we keep changing it like you're suggesting... then it's not law anymore.

270
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:09,580
- How dare you lecture us? 
 - Goodness.

271
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:13,520
Goodness.Where did this little loach crawl from?

272
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,860
You're dirtying the waters of our peaceful city!

273
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,340
That's enough, all of you!

274
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,990
What did you just say?!

275
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:24,250
- Prosecutor Kim. 
 - Yes, sir. 
- That was uncalled for.

276
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,080
Apologize to them at once.

277
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,030
I apologize.

278
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,630
Look, Chief Jeon.

279
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:43,690
Let's not complicate things, okay?

280
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:47,020
Chief Jeon, properly educate your junior prosecutors.

281
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:50,550
Indeed. We'll quietly let this one go,

282
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:53,200
so put things back in place at once!

283
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,440
Looks like he got the message.

284
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,510
We should get going.

285
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:07,280
Okay, let's go.

286
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,180
But what shall we do?

287
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:14,410
We can't let things quietly go, nor can we put things "back in place."

288
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,710
What do you mean?

289
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:19,680
A junior of mine who visited me in Gimsan saw what happened in this incident.

290
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,560
So? What about it?

291
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,780
I'm telling you this because...

292
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:28,390
Oh, look it's time.

293
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:32,080
I know you're all busy with official business but stay for a moment to watch this.

294
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,440
All right.

295
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,420
 This is QBS with the 6 o'clock news. 

296
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,690
 Early this morning in Gimsan, Gangwon Province 

297
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:42,750
 a gang that ran an illegal gambling den were all caught. 

298
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,900
 The prosecutors swooped down on the scene in the early morning, 

299
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,730
 and arrested 20 gang members. 

300
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:50,560
 The high-ranking officials who had embezzled... 

301
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,680
What in the world?

302
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,190
Are you playing games with us?

303
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:56,040
I'm sorry.

304
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,820
For those who break the law, there is no compromise.

305
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:07,080
The Yuchae Faction must've thought they wouldn't ever be investigated.

306
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,610
They were kind enough to leave the bribery information and details of deposit and withdrawal

307
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:14,460
precisely recorded in their computer at the gambling den.

308
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:18,570
Thanks to that it was easy for us to secure the evidence.

309
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:22,410
Aren't you curious whose names are on the list...

310
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,740
and for what reason?

311
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:33,770
The young prosecutors these days aren't like what they used to be.

312
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:36,610
They just won't listen to the regional prosecutor.

313
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:40,030
Do you think a few names on that ledger

314
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:42,710
is enough to lock me up?

315
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:46,210
Don't you know who's got my back?

316
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:50,860
As the regional prosecutor, you should know at the very least what happens to those who oppose the living power.

317
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,970
We're prosecutors.

318
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:54,980
The law will decide that.

319
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:58,400
Fine. Let's see how you end up.

320
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,690
♫  Even if you fool everyone else with that innocent face  ♫

321
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:06,020
♫  You can't get away from me.  ♫

322
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,990
♫  Oh Bring it on Bring it on  ♫

323
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:14,350
♫  Bring it on Oh Yeah  ♫

324
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:18,140
How do you feel about turning this place upside down when you haven't even been here for half a month?

325
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,490
It is very fun.

326
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:22,900
Rotten things, must be cut out.

327
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,850
But there's an apt timing to all things.

328
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:30,100
When did you plan on exposing this incident, Regional Prosecutor?

329
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:30,910
What?

330
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:34,750
I had the feeling that you were anticipating this more than I had been.

331
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:39,220
A prosecutor must only speak with conviction, not mere feelings.

332
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,000
I will remember that, sir.

333
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,480
It'll be hard to expose them with the records on the computer alone.

334
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,150
If we add Moon Gu Jun's confession, it'll be worth trying.

335
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:49,620
Do you feel confident?

336
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,970
Yes, sir.

337
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:59,320
Prosecutor, we found clear track marks on the arms of the brothel women.

338
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,220
The drug test results will be available tomorrow.

339
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,930
I've taken care of these so far.

340
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:07,190
Fine, good job.

341
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:11,450
If you're done with those, please take care of these too.

342
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,080
 Gimsan City High-ranking Officials Personnel Reception List 

343
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,180
Um, I really have to go home today.

344
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:18,540
Ah! You haven't been able to go home.

345
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,350
Indeed.

346
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:23,260
Then go home and take care of it tomorrow.

347
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:32,140
And as for Choi Hyeon Jong and the others that we've investigated, just release them.

348
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:34,760
You went through that trouble, and want to let them go already?

349
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:38,240
We can't justify keeping them long here.

350
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:42,760
We have Moon Gu Jun now, so it's fine.

351
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:46,120
Right, keep Lee Hyeon Seok too.

352
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,550
Yes, I understand.

353
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,900
Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu.

354
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:00,190
It's good to see you. It's been so long.

355
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:02,120
- What brings you here? 
 - Oh.

356
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:05,070
I was actually on my way back after the resort's grand opening.

357
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,570
I guess you're busy these days.

358
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:10,270
Yes, there are more cases than I expected.

359
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:12,810
You returned to Korea sooner than I thought.

360
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:15,550
I came back because of my dad's health.

361
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:19,030
So are you mostly in the office these days?

362
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:23,000
Well, I'm just helping out my brother.

363
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,530
What about you?

364
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,810
Why did you come down all the way here?

365
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:30,840
I heard our legal team scouted you, too.

366
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:35,350
I just... wanted to see the ocean.

367
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,050
What?

368
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:43,970
Wow. It's so lame

369
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:44,990
but cool at the same time.

370
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:46,470
I know.

371
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:51,660
I missed you and your lame jokes.

372
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:55,560
And? I haven't changed, right?

373
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,960
Yes.  And I'm still the one who has to reach out.

374
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:04,350
I'm always the one who says, "I missed you," and reaches out to you first.

375
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:08,500
Well, then let's just say I said "I missed you" first.

376
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,300
Aigoo, how fair.

377
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,030
I am a fair person.

378
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:17,360
I heard you had a new case early this morning. Aren't you busy?

379
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,700
A little.

380
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:21,160
Okay.

381
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,220
- Then let's get going. 
 - Sure.

382
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,020
Kim Hui Wu!

383
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,020
Hey, Kim Han Mi!

384
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,410
I'll be off, then. Call me when you're in Seoul.

385
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:35,960
Okay, keep in touch. Have a safe trip.

386
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,460
Yes.

387
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,230
- Who is she? 
 - Oh.

388
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:58,030
A classmate from college.

389
00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:01,130
She is pretty, but not as pretty as I am.

390
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:02,210
You didn't see her up close.

391
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:04,750
- I did. 
 - No, you didn't.

392
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:07,620
Give me one reason she's better than me.

393
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:12,240
Just one? Is that even possible?

394
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,120
Got a death wish? Stop playing hard and just tell me one reason.

395
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,190
W-Well, she's a woman.

396
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:25,660
How did you know to come all the way here?

397
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,100
I was planning on sending you the press release myself.

398
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:33,700
How could I ignore you when this guy came all the way to the broadcast station on your behalf?

399
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:36,050
- I said I was covering a story here as an excuse. 
 -Good job.

400
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:38,520
Do you pick your friends based on looks?

401
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,020
How can they all be so beautiful?

402
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:44,570
Should I say that birds of a feather flock together?

403
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:45,930
I was wrong.

404
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:47,490
About what?

405
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:52,350
Anyway, it's nice to see you. I didn't get to say goodbye since I left right after the training institute.

406
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:55,970
Your charm is that you think you're cool.

407
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:59,180
- I guess my charm is nothing special then.
 - Yeah.

408
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:01,790
That's why you should treat your friends better.  It's annoying.

409
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,220
What are you annoyed about?

410
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:08,180
When you look at this face, the annoyance just melts away.

411
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:11,570
Are the two of you by chance...?

412
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,650
You get along well.

413
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:22,910
So this is where you were!

414
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,920
Mr. Prosecutor isn't that tough after all.

415
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,550
Yeah, it turns out there's not much to being a prosecutor.

416
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:33,940
You come here for a drink, right? Go ahead. Drink up.

417
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:36,050
You know, Mr. Prosecutor

418
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:42,120
Hyeon Jeong was really angry. I heard you scared him and threatened him?

419
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,790
Is that how he felt? I wonder why?

420
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:50,420
Plus, everything you said was a lie.

421
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:56,680
And you have a well-endowed eonni here too.

422
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:00,710
Really? Does it look that way?

423
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:04,070
Where was he looking? Gosh, what a lucky—

424
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:06,620
- Do you think so too? 
 - This is a tough one.

425
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:09,090
I don't think so.

426
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,680
Do you want to die, you bastard?

427
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:18,240
Hey, hey. That's enough. Just go. Go and have some raw fish.

428
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,680
Look a shrimp. It looks just like you. Do you want to eat this?

429
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:27,510
Prosecutor, be careful. This neighborhood is pretty small.

430
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:29,990
And Eonni, about what I said before—

431
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:35,170
I get it, so shut up you asshole. Before I stab you in the ribs with my chopsticks.

432
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:41,720
Let's go.

433
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,880
Hurry up.

434
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:53,500
Excuse me, Noonim. The way you talk is exactly my style.

435
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,540
- What about the well-endowed thing? 
 - I'm not too sure about that.

436
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:01,590
They're bigger than you think. But I'm not telling you to imagine them.

437
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:02,720
Oh, okay.

438
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:07,160
You should relax a bit. How is it your mouth is still foul after all this time?

439
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,520
What are you talking about? Being a journalist just made it worse.

440
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,840
But it's okay... since I'm well-endowed.

441
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,870
Aww... I don't... think that's true.

442
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:19,520
Hey! Hey! Why are you so fixated on that?

443
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,600
I don't know! I was doing just fine...

444
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,040
It pisses me off more the more I think about it.

445
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:32,420
- Hey! Hey! Han Mi! 
 - Hey! Look!

446
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,590
- They are pretty big. 
 - Yes. You're 100% right.

447
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:38,470
She still has that temper.

448
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,950
It's cold, isn't it?

449
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:48,660
How is it being a journalist?

450
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:54,240
I don't know. The whole day passes by without any time to think about things.

451
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,850
That sounds good.

452
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:57,370
What about you?

453
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:04,260
It's good. I'm doing what I really wanted to do.

454
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,500
You really never know about people.

455
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:13,980
I never imagined my life would turn out this way.

456
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,700
Until I met you.

457
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:21,420
No. You would have become a reporter either way.

458
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:24,100
- Do you think so? 
 - Yes.

459
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,900
It was your fate to be a reporter.

460
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:33,360
Oh, right! How did your dad react?

461
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:38,760
Well... He lost his mind. After all, I didn't listen and do as he said.

462
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:43,470
Even so, since I was stubborn about it, he took a step back. Do you know what he said?

463
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:46,080
He said he would consider it if I went into the entertainment department.

464
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,240
He may as well have thrust you into politics.

465
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:53,570
Of course. I applied for politics.

466
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:56,920
I'll be assigned as soon as my internship ends.

467
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:03,940
I'm rooting for you, Han Mi.

468
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:20,120
 When did you plan on exposing this incident, Regional Prosecutor? 

469
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:25,480
 - What? 
 - I had the feeling that you were anticipating this more than I had been. 

470
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:41,870
 It'll be hard to expose them with the records on the computer alone. 

471
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:45,380
 If we add Moon Gu Jun's confession, it'll be worth trying. 

472
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,860
 - Don't expect me to help. 
 - That's a given. 

473
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:50,270
 - Are you saying you don't need help? 
 - Not yet. 

474
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:54,130
 Really? Then what are you going to do? 

475
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:04,940
I'm going to hand over the human trafficking and drug cases to Deputy Director Kim Seok Hun.

476
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:10,350
And I'm considering taking you and Sunbae Ji,

477
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:13,070
and the three of us crossing over to their side.

478
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:18,840
Even me? Why should I?

479
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:23,210
You need power to fight for justice.

480
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:28,500
But isn't Kim Seok Hun next in line to be Prosecutor General?

481
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,090
Yes. He is.

482
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:33,240
And do you think he'd get his hands dirty with work like this?

483
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,890
He doesn't need to do anything at all to become the chief prosecutor.

484
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:40,000
It's true that Kim Seok Hun is an impressive person.

485
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,140
But he still doesn't have any major achievements.

486
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:50,800
To stand above the 2,000 strong prosecutors, he needs a big case.

487
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,550
We're exchanging a big case that Deputy Prosecutor Kim

488
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:57,120
desperately needs for a ticket back to Seoul.

489
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,320
- And 
 - And?

490
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:03,770
Either way, it would be hard for us to solve the case ourselves.

491
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:07,630
We could end up ruining the case without even touching it.

492
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:09,710
So you're saying that since it's a case we couldn't solve anyway,

493
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:13,760
we should hand it over to Kim Seok Hun and take the help?

494
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,560
Yes. Exactly.

495
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:24,020
Kim Hui Yu. What is it that you really want?

496
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,920
Director Jeon Seok Gyu,

497
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,170
Is that why you came here?

498
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:29,520
Yeah.

499
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,770
Why? His personality sucks and he looked scary.

500
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:37,870
I really don't know what's inside your head.

501
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:40,200
I have a lot to learn from him.

502
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,600
Are you looking for another mentor?

503
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,140
Well, it'll be good if we have one per subject.

504
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:47,280
That's true.

505
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,710
Hyeong,

506
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:57,250
when did you start dating?

507
00:35:57,250 --> 00:36:01,790
Two women came looking for you on the same day. Which one is the real deal?

508
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,250
If you ask me,

509
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:14,860
my heart says Seonbae Hui Ah. But I'm also strangely drawn to Nuna Han Mi too.

510
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:17,620
- Sang Man, 
 - Yes?

511
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:21,880
You've gotten really comfortable nowadays, haven't you?

512
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,960
Don't you have a lot of work to do tomorrow?

513
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,960
Let's go to sleep. Go to sleep, you punk!

514
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,510
Turn off the lights!

515
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:33,880
Hyung, could we share the bed today?

516
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:37,430
- Do you want to sleep outside? 
 - No, no. Sleeping on the floor is better.

517
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:41,900
That brat,

518
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,570
thinking about useless things.

519
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:44,900
So cold...

520
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,880
- Be quiet. 
 - I hate you... 
 - What?

521
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,120
There are reports of drugs being brought in by ship.

522
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:56,910
If you feel anything is off while you're working, report back immediately.

523
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,980
Park Gun!

524
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:04,100
The flatfish that we brought in today are fantastic. Should we go have a drink today?

525
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,180
That would be great!

526
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:07,950
 Gimsan Regional Prosecutors' Office

 Illegal Gambling Accomplices List 

528
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:22,000
- Investigator. 
 - Yes.

529
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,200
Take it easy.

530
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,580
You woke the birds of Gimsan Branch with your clacking keyboard,

531
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:30,820
so that they started chirping before sunrise.

532
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:33,080
Then should I?

533
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,540
But what's that?

534
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,630
This?

535
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,460
Things I'm going to investigate.

536
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:43,140
Give it here. I guess a house is just a place you go back to on the holidays.

537
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:45,730
Please stop. You'll pass out at this rate.

538
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:50,200
I already passed out. Work is done with the mind, not the body.

539
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,070
I told you to go home.

540
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:57,440
I can see heaps of work piled up in front of me, but what can I do? People come before work.

541
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,960
Forget it. Give it to me!

542
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,950
But I said it's okay...

543
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:07,950
I'm only giving these to you because you asked for them,

544
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:12,010
but as you may well know, I need them done before you leave.

545
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:16,970
Yes, I see now that I had been lazily whistling away while receiving my government pay.

546
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:20,410
Sure. I'll do it. I have to.

547
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:25,060
If you're telling me to finish it before leaving work, you're basically telling me to leave work tomorrow.

548
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:29,230
If you look at the volume, it would seem so.

549
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:33,470
Either way, I respect your passion.

550
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:42,590
Then, I'll leave it to you. Fighting!

551
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:49,310
Sure. Go ahead.

552

 Investigation Room 

553
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:05,100
Is your lawyer not here yet?

554
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:10,100
What a lazy person.

555
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,810
Let's just say that's how the lawyer is.

556
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:19,460
Have any of your lifelines come to visit you even once?

557
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:22,400
They didn't, did they?

558
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:29,100
The people you relied on can't help you anymore.

559
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:39,650
 Many Gimsan City Gangsters Caught Running Illegal Gambling Den 

560
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:45,690
Those folks are very busy right now trying to put out their own fires.

561
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,320
But that's that.

562
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,650
- Human trafficking? 
 - What?

563
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:58,780
Did you personally distribute the illicit drugs?

564
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:05,900
Mr. Mun Gu Jun. Let's go swiftly and easily. Yes?

565
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:09,990
The kids under you already confessed anyway.

566
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,310
Here, what you requested.

567
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:17,590
Thank you.

568
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:19,950
These are the statements you received from the illegal brothel women right?

569
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:21,930
Yes.

570
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:23,990
Great job. I'll leave the rest in your hands too.

571
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:26,090
Yes, understood

572
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:30,030
Let's look here.

573
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:37,660
There are times you personally injected the drugs, Chairman.

574
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:40,930
But you'll still remain mum?

575
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:44,410
Sure, continue to assert your right to remain silent.

576
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:49,380
Then before the lawyer gets here, let me briefly recite to you

577
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:52,430
your charges, Mr. Mun Gu Jun.

578
00:40:55,500 --> 00:41:00,610
Criminal syndicate, Yuchae Faction criminal allegations: opening and running an illegal gambling den,

579
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:04,520
bribery, human trafficking for the purpose of prostitution,

580
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,600
smuggling and distribution of illicit drugs,

581
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:10,590
running a financial institution with illegal interest rates.

582
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:14,000
Just how many is this?

583
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,490
On top of that, you already have a rap sheet, so your sentencing would be even more severe.

584
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:20,230
Just looking at it, it would be at least

585
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:24,850
about 30 years, I wager?

586
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:30,250
You're not young. Looks like you'll end your life in jail.

587
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:39,820
Look, Mr. Mun Gu Jun. I'll give you some options.

588
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:43,160
Would you like to take responsibility for only the crimes you committed?

589
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:48,260
Or would you rather have all of it blamed on you?

590
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,650
Water, please.

591
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:07,180
His swing is so smooth. He hit him with everything he has without breaking a sweat.

592
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,520
Are you sure he's a first-time prosecutor?

593
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:12,250
The way he's questioning him, if you said he was in his 10th year as a prosecutor, I'd believe it.

594
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:15,820
 Okay, we'll end here for today. 

595
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,860
Nice work.

596
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,310
Come in.

597
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:37,340
Nice work.

598
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,620
Shall we have a drink?

599
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:42,870
Yes.

600
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:57,880
- Seong Wu. 
 - Yes?

601
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,390
Support Hui Wu for now.

602
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:01,800
Pardon? Me?

603
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,560
Yeah.

604
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:09,250
If a human trafficking ring is involved, it'll take some time for Hui Wu to find them alone.

605
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:16,130
You'll bring me to Seoul?

606
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:17,210
Yes.

607
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:20,920
If I get stabbed in the back by trusting you,

608
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:23,970
I'll probably drown in that ocean.

609
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:26,230
That won't happen.

 Gimsan City
 Human Trafficking. Drug Cartel 

612
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:42,390
I should earn my own carfare. I can't leech off my subordinates now, can I?

613
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:46,190
It's a document listing this region's high-ranking officials' corruption.

614
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:49,290
I collected them whenever they had their guard down.

615
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:53,760
Thank you.

616
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,760
I will carve out the rotten parts leaving nothing behind.

617
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,980
Assemblyman Gu Ok Cheong, Mayor, Police Precinct Head. You detonated a bomb via the news.

618
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:05,800
They'll stop at nothing to escape.

619
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,370
I will ensure their roads are blocked.

620
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:09,360
No.

621
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:13,080
With this, even Mun Gu Jun won't be able to hold out any longer.

622
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:16,760
But how did you know that I was secretly investigating?

623
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:20,150
This is a secret investigation for me, too, so I can't tell you.

624
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:22,180
Please understand.

625
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,850
Kim Hui Wu.

626
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,410
Let's do well.

627
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:32,040
Yes.

628
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,030
Let's drink.

629
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,820
Stay seated.

630
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:49,720
Stay seated.

631
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:52,190
No, no, no.

632
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:55,180
Hyeong Choi Hyeong and Park Gun, come here.

633
00:44:56,590 --> 00:44:59,830
What are the two of you doing tomorrow night?

634
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:01,160
Not much.

635
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,630
Same here.

636
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:05,280
Wouldn't you like to do something with me?

637
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,130
The pay is quite something.

638
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,200
Well, sounds good. What is it?

639
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:14,230
I'm just letting the two of you know especially.

640
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:19,150
If you help out with the offloading of the fishing boat tomorrow, the pay will be...

641
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:28,200
Also when the work is over, they'll pay for a grand meal afterward.

642
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,290
It's good right?

643
00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:31,950
Sounds good.

644
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:33,600
 Got you. 

645
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,380
What?

646
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:42,680
Got it. I'll give them twice the promised pay, so tell them to give that job to us.

647
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:46,900
And you need to come to Seoul with me.

648
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:48,830
Yeah, right now.

649
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:52,190
 Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office 

650
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:56,600
I've heard through Il Hyeon. What is it that you need to discuss?

651
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:00,140
I would like to request help from you, Deputy District Prosecutor.

652
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:02,690
- Help? 
 - Yes.

653
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:13,190
It's a case about the ties between the Gimsan City's gangsters and its regional politicians

654
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:15,970
I also heard of this case on the news.

655
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:19,590
What is it? Human trafficking.

656
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:21,610
 Breaking of laws regarding illicit drug controls 

657
00:46:21,610 --> 00:46:23,380
Drugs?

658
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:28,370
The scale of this case is much bigger than what was on the news.

659
00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:29,990
Yes.

660
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:34,180
Human trafficking is happening through job agencies.

661
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:37,050
From what we gathered so far, there are 15 sites nationwide.

662
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:44,200
As for the drugs, using fish from Gimsan Port the drugs are being distributed through those agencies.

663
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:47,750
The transaction is scheduled for tomorrow night.

664
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:49,600
Tomorrow night?

665
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:53,350
But why are you giving this to me?

666
00:46:53,350 --> 00:46:58,120
This is something for the Gangwon Provincial Public Prosecutors' Office to handle.

667
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:03,550
No, we would like to investigate under your direction, Deputy District Prosecutor.

668
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:05,280
- We? 
 - Yes.

669
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:10,830
To give this case to you, I conferred with the branch prosecutor.

670
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:12,930
Branch prosecutor...

671
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,760
- Oh, Jeon Seok Gyu?
 - Yes.

672
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:21,330
Branch Prosecutor Jeon would like to work under you.

673
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:26,670
This case is like a show of sincerity from him to you.

674
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:32,380
 Jeon Seok Gyu... that straightforward bamboo stalk comes to work under me? 

675
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:36,160
 I could use this to bring a considerable number of my opponents to my side. 

676
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,710
On your way to an even higher position,

677
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:42,140
I hope that this case will be at least a small help.

678
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:47,870
Well, I also want to quickly come to Seoul to assist you.

679
00:47:47,870 --> 00:47:53,270
 Kim Hui Wu is a clever bastard. If someone like this worked for me... 

680
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:59,090
Fine. I'll try putting my trust in you.

681
00:47:59,090 --> 00:48:01,370
Thank you, Deputy District Prosecutor.

682
00:48:02,390 --> 00:48:05,810
You have to hit the trafficking and smuggling sites at the same time.

683
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:10,690
One whole region will be taking a hit, so it'll seem bigger than it actually is.

684
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:12,380
That's right.

685
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:15,720
The large scope of the human trafficking case will be taken care of here.

686
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:19,360
- What about the drug smuggling? Should I send reinforcements?
 - Yes.

687
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:22,940
Since it'll be the justification to bring Branch Prosecutor Jeon back to Seoul,

688
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:26,120
so for the related case of the Gimsan bribery, be sure to cleanly conclude that as well.

689
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:30,990
I'll expose it to the news to make the world focus on Gimsan.

690
00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:34,140
As ordered, I will take care of it without fail.

691
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:37,240
When I make my move then, Jeon Seok Gyu

692
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:41,750
and everyone under him will be able to come to Seoul.

693
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:48,430
Thank you, Deputy District Prosecutor.

694
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:51,950
Sure.

695
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:02,000
 Hey, brother! 

696
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,400
Seonbae!

697
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:08,880
It's been so long!

698
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,200
- Have you been well? 
 - Yes.

699
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,680
You never contacted me once after going to Gimsan.

700
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,600
I apologize, I've been busy.

701
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,570
I bet you were.

702
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:21,970
Jerk! I missed you!

703
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:32,470
Aren't you doing well! Even meeting Deputy District Prosecutor Kim one-on-one.

704
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:35,840
Well, it ended up that way somehow.

705
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:40,100
Anyway, it was you, right?

706
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:44,230
Gimsan Illegal Gambling Dens and Bribery Case.

707
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:48,440
Right now there are three prosecutors at the Gimsan Branch.

708
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:51,540
Two of them have been exiled, so there's no way they'd make a scene.

709
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:55,070
That leaves just you, but that's not what's important.

710
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:58,910
What is important is that you, as the prosecutor-in-charge,

711
00:49:58,910 --> 00:50:02,180
came to Seoul to meet Deputy District Prosecutor Kim.

712
00:50:04,090 --> 00:50:08,560
- What about it?  
 - There's an even bigger case behind the Gimsan case.

713
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:14,840
What's more, the fact that you met with a bigshot like Kim Seok Hun and not Jang Il Hyeon means

714
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:20,050
you made a tricky deal that no ordinary prosecutor could pull off.

715
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:23,320
What did you offer and what did you receive?

716
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:29,540
A ticket to Seoul. Right?

717
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:34,900
 Seonbae Lee Min Su, he's frighteningly sharp and perceptive. 

718
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:37,510
Great idea. Please move up here already.

719
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:40,130
That way my life can get spicier.

720
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:43,640
Seoul's no fun without you.

721
00:50:47,770 --> 00:50:50,820
 Gyu Ri said to drop by the Eastern District Prosecutors Office on your way. 

722
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:54,660
 If you don't want to get cursed out, it's better to go. 

723
00:50:56,910 --> 00:50:58,840
Did you come to Seoul to tour the Prosecutors' Offices?

724
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:02,570
Let's stop by since it's on the way. She's an important friend.

725
00:51:02,570 --> 00:51:03,470
Okay.

726
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:05,720
 You bastard! 

727
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:09,300
- Did you become a prosecutor to look cool? 
 - Sorry?

728
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:12,720
Do you think you're some kind of justice warrior?

729
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,520
I believe that this society needs to be fair.

730
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:17,380
Do you think I don't know that?!

731
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:19,160
 What is the rule of law? 

732
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:23,210
Wrongdoings need to be judged fairly whether they seem unfair or pitiful.

733
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:27,120
If you dismiss all of them because you feel sorry for them and don't indict them because things feel unfair,

734
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:30,100
what about the crime?

735
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:32,590
Though you may take things into consideration since being human comes first,

736
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:37,310
the law must account for the wrongdoing. Or you can quit and go help the unfortunate instead.

737
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:38,520
Got that?

738
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,860
Yes, understood.

739
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:45,200
I don't want to see you for the next 20 minutes.

740
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,080
- Get out. 
 - Yes.

741
00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:57,280
That crazy, rock-headed idiot.

742
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,720
Kim Hui Wu.

743
00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:10,720
- Here. This is all I can offer you. 
 - Okay.

744
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,580
Thanks.

745
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:17,340
It's true, what Seonbae Min Su said.

746
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:18,320
What?

747
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:23,020
The model student Kim Gyu Ri has become a tough woman warrior.

748
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:26,940
Once I became a prosecutor, I naturally ended up this way.

749
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:31,200
Wait three years, and you'll curse creatively.

750
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,920
Too many things happen that drive me up the wall.

751
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,390
Still, it's nice to see.

752
00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:39,790
How are you doing? Do you like being a prosecutor?

753
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:41,230
Yeah. Of course.

754
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:45,150
Well, you did place first at the institute, so it's not surprising.

755
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:48,440
But about Gu Seung Hyeok...

756
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,070
Gu Seung Hyeok?

757
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:52,730
Oh, you two were at the institute at the same time, right?

758
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:55,710
Yeah, he's a good guy.

759
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:57,920
Nonsense.

760
00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:01,120
He's crawling around under me right now.

761
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,620
Was that punk always so stubborn and inflexible?

762
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:06,340
He's always the same.

763
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:10,040
That's Prosecutor Gu's charm.

764
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:12,600
He drives me nuts.

765
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,320
Thanks for dropping by with your busy schedule.

766
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:22,160
I should be thanking you. You're the one who's busy.

767
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,650
Go inside.

768
00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:26,450
Okay, see you next time then.

769
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:30,780
Be good to Seung Hyeok. He's going to be a big help to you.

770
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:33,380
Yeah. Get back safely.

771
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:35,400
Let's keep in touch.

772
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:45,040
Hyeong.

773
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:51,020
I am someone without any predispositions. You can tell me honestly.

774
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:53,680
You're a pervert, right?

775
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:56,930
What is this unprovoked attack?

776
00:53:56,930 --> 00:53:59,960
How many girlfriends do you have exactly?

777
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:02,600
Will you focus already?

778
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:04,370
Hurry up and drive.

779
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,740
- Kim Hui Wu? 
 - Yes.

780
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:18,320
He was 1st at the institute, but he went down to Gimsan Branch.

781
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,020
He's an odd one.

782
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:24,280
- And he wants to come to Seoul?
 - Yes.

783
00:54:25,330 --> 00:54:29,930
The fact that he was able to grow the case from out in the boonies is an extraordinary skill.

784
00:54:29,930 --> 00:54:32,050
He has good directing abilities.

785
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:33,870
Bring Kim Hui Wu to Seoul.

786
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:36,090
He had another condition.

787
00:54:36,090 --> 00:54:38,700
He said Branch Prosecutor Jeon Seok Gyu and the other ordinary prosecutor

788
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:42,150
also wanted to be reassigned together to Seoul.

789
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:44,010
Jeon Seok Gyu.

790
00:54:44,010 --> 00:54:47,390
A few years ago, he was the one who convicted the son of the Minister of MoLIT  (Ministry of Land Infrastructure and Transport). 

791
00:54:47,390 --> 00:54:51,800
Because of his history of rejecting his superiors' orders, he was exiled to Gimsan Branch.

792
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:56,480
The prosecutor that made a big noise in Seocho-dong?  (Where the Seoul Western District Prosecutors Office is.) 

793
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:59,230
- Was his nickname tiger? 
 - Yes, correct.

794
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:01,220
There isn't any relationship with us,

795
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:04,300
but because of his uprightness, many prosecutors followed him.

796
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:08,100
We wouldn't lose anything by keeping someone like him around us.

797
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:10,480
I also feel the same.

798
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:14,870
Look at how he takes care of this case. If he's useful, bring him up too.

799
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:16,330
Yes, sir.

800
00:55:16,330 --> 00:55:19,070
 There's a high chance of suicide... 

801
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:28,100
- Investigator? 
 - Yes, Prosecutor.

802
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:30,560
Now if you even just call me, I'm scared.

803
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:33,140
That's so disappointing to hear.

804
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:34,920
Why did you get to work so early?

805
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:39,460
What do you mean arrive to work? Because of someone, I was unable to get off work.

806
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:40,820
I see.

807
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:42,980
Then you must be about done with your work?

808
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:46,280
Why? I'm almost done. Is there something else I need to do?

809
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:49,140
You should come with me from now on.

810
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:52,340
With you, Prosecutor? Why?

811
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:57,480
Tonight, there's going to be a drug transaction at Gimsan Port.

812
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,560
Drugs?

813
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:01,730
Yes.

814
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:03,890
It's Kim Hui Wu's work?

815
00:56:03,890 --> 00:56:06,200
Yes. Kim Hui Wu's work.

816
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:10,680
This time he's given a big present to the deputy district prosecutor. What a kid.

817
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:15,900
I can tell, seeing that Deputy District Prosecutor himself is directing the investigation.

818
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:18,180
I knew he was soaring above others, but it's beyond my imagination.

819
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:22,820
If this works out, our merits will be carved into Deputy District Prosecutor's red carpet.

820
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:27,970
He's someone who has set the table for us grandly. He didn't leave a single one of us out.

821
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:30,210
I'm Osan. You?

822
00:56:30,210 --> 00:56:32,010
- I'm Pyeongtaek. 
 - Okay.

823
00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:34,790
- Let's leave early so we're not late. 
 - Yes.

824
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:52,830
Investigator, you're so cool.

825
00:56:52,830 --> 00:56:57,100
After we get off work, let's really eat something delicious.

826
00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:06,380
He's going to work me down to the bone.

827
00:57:07,410 --> 00:57:10,480
What is this? Why is this one so heavy?

828
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:23,240
Damn it, that punk!

- Hey, what are you doing?
 - Oh, nothing much!

834
00:58:01,810 --> 00:58:04,060
What if we're wrong about this?

835
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:05,930
Oh, my back.

836
00:58:05,930 --> 00:58:08,720
Sir!

837
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,670
I'm telling you, it's fresh!

838
00:58:10,670 --> 00:58:13,590
Of course! I'm not a newbie in this business!

839
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:14,980
Aren't you going to work?

840
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:17,320
Oh, sorry.

841
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:21,050
Just a sec.

Hey, you better do your job properly.

843
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:25,700
- I'm sorry. 
 - You should have watched where you were going.

844
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:27,730
Make sure you pick up every one of them.

845
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:29,410
Yes, sir.

846
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:31,090
Hello?

847
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:34,250
 What problem? 

848
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:35,130
What is this?

849
00:58:35,130 --> 00:58:38,150
I'm saying it's truly grade A this time.

850
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:40,390
It's really grade A.

851
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:46,140
Good.

852
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:48,180
What do you think you're doing?

853
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:49,890
- Are you crazy, you bastard? 
 - Prosecutor?

854
00:58:49,890 --> 00:58:54,180
Of course, he's crazy. Hard not to be.

855
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:55,680
Good job.

856
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:59,430
Innocent civilians have been dragged into a crime scene. Wouldn't you go crazy?

How's this bastard now?

By someone.

It doesn't matter who truly killed him.

I have to use it against them.

Is it because of Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop? I can convince him.

You're going to set the game up?

Assemblyman is waiting for you.

There's a listening device.
