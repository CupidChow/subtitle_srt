 Lee Joon Gi 

3
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,820
 Lee Kyung Young

00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,490
 Kim Ji Eun

00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:35,030
 Again My Life 

6
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:37,910
 Young people, set a goal and achieve it! 

7
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,580
 Young people, set a goal and achieve it! 

8
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:55,700
 When you get closer to Jo Tae Seop, you might see me again. 

9
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,950
 The Grim Reaper? 

10
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:06,410
Nice to meet you. I'm Jo Tae Seop.

11
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:08,650
 Nice to meet you. 

12
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:13,250
You played a big role in winning last year's Presidential elections and regime change.

13
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,500
Unexpectedly, the percentage of voters in their 20s exceeded 45%.

14
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,050
 I want to hear your thoughts on communicating with the younger generation. 

15
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:23,760
I keep my mouth closed and my wallet open.

16
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:29,330
I watch and listen to Super Junior and Lee Hyo Ri. 
 (TN: Kpop idols)

17
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:34,220
I still Alt+Tab  ( a 1987 function to switch between tasks ) and read Guiyeoni novels  (Guiyeoni: pen name of a well-known internet novelist.) 

18
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,920
to read the thoughts of you all.

19
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,150
It's a joke.

20
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,490
Even if we don't listen to the same music, one should understand the other generations

21
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,950
and respect their cultures.

22
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,480
 It's not a forced communication made  

23
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,420
 by opening the wallets of the older generation. Instead  

24
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,630
 an easy-going communication with formality is needed. 

25
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:00,390
 However, what's preventing it may be vested interests, 

26
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,190
 the selfishness of the older generation. 

27
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:08,650
Cutting the tuition fee to half was the promise of the current president.

28
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,770
- Do you think it’s possible? 
- No!

29
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,190
- Is it possible? 
- No!

30
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:18,070
No! Our ultimate goal is not to cut them to half.

31
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:21,070
But make it fully state-funded!

32
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:23,750
 Young people, set a goal and achieve it! 

33
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,240
I believe that everybody has the freedom and right to dream.

34
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,190
But, what can you do with just freedom and rights?

35
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:46,270
An opportunity to effortlessly achieve that dream!

36
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:50,110
That opportunity should be given fairly and equally.

37
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,860
Various voices of the diverse generations should pour out.

38
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,370
And those diverse voices should bear equal power.

39
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:02,170
Only then a person can go from rags to riches. 
  (Meaning derived from a proverb.) 

40
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,740
 The youths that act on their dreams 

41
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:09,810
 and the hopes the next generation holds, will protect this society.  

42
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:12,600
 The future is for the ones who dream. 

43
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,960
Everyone, please have dreams!

44
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,110
 Have a future. 

45
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:23,770
Our present. Our future.

46
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,310
Please protect them.

47
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:29,110
I, Jo Tae Seop, will help you.

48
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,840
 Jo Tae Seop, as I expected, this won't be easy. 

49
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,040
 Jo Tae Seop 

50
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,890
Can I please take a photo?

51
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,210
Thank you!

52
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,510
Assemblyman, can I request one too?

53
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:01,050
Ah! Sure. Your name is...

54
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,450
My name is Kim Gyu Ri.

55
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:06,490
Please sign for me also!

56
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,480
 Episode 4 

57
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,520
 You're so handsome! 

58
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:16,270
Please stay in line!

59
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:25,470
 If you have another life, will you use it to put Jo Tae Seop in jail? 

60
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:43,540
 Promise me. Can you show him that there's a living hell in this world? 

61
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:50,540
Thanks. I’ll keep my promise.

62
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,690
Yes. Please do.

63
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:03,350
 The Grim Reaper is Jo Tae Seop's secretary. 

64
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,680
He's coming out!

65
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,130
Oh, where?

66
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:20,160
 Young people, set a goal and achieve it. 

67
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,130
Office Manager Han Ji Hyeon, what's the next appointment?

68
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:40,390
- A field trip to the district and a visit to Daeoseong Orphanage. 
 - Okay

69
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,710
Han Ji Hyeon.

70
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:29,420
- It's been a while. Have you all been okay?
 - Yes!

71
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:32,140
Let me give you a hug. Up we go!

72
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:35,460
Oh my! Why did you gain so much weight!

73
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,720
Just grow up strong!  Down we go.

74
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,170
Grandpa, I made this for you.

75
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:46,130
- Oh! Really? You can put it here. 
- Yes!

76
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,370
Thanks, Ye Seong.

77
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,370
I wrote a letter.

78
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:53,040
Ah! A letter too?

79
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,920
Wow, Su Bin writes so beautifully too!

80
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,790
Thanks.

81
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:08,590
Wait a minute. The little one is standing there alone.

82
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:17,740
You’ve never seen me before, right?

83
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,250
- What's your name? 
- Park Ji Na.

84
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:25,580
Ji Na, what a beautiful name.

85
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,300
What's it like to live here?

86
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,050
The principal takes care of me really well.

87
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:33,650
Ah! I see. Ji Na, come over here.

88
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:38,720
This country is your mom and dad.

89
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,330
You are not alone. There are always

90
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:46,320
people rooting for you, Ji Na.

91
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,380
Don't forget that.

92
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,620
Promise me.

93
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,460
 Jo Tae Seop visits people in their environs. 

94
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:05,810
 Manager Han ... Jo Tae Seop isn't someone who would keep just anyone next to him.  

95
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,760
 But the fact that I don't know her... 

96
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:14,290
 Please catch him. Please show him that there's a living hell in this world. 

97
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,250
Does that mean she died before me?

98
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,490
 Again My Life 

99
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:44,910
 Thanks. I’ll keep my promise. 

100
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,490
Now, drink up. 
 Jo Tae Seop continues to interact with everyday people ... 

101
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,060
- Should I pour for myself? 
 - Oh, no. I'll do it.

102
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:00,210
To the top.

103
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:02,640
- Cheers! 
- Cheers!

104
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,070
Nice.

105
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,320
Why do you think Hui Wu went to go see that person?

106
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,640
I don't think that's Hui Wu's type.

107
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,360
Smart and cool people tend to

108
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,380
master both sides.

109
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,970
Hold on.

110
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:30,180
Progressive, conservative.  Like this ... like me!

111
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,800
That’s not what I mean.

112
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,090
That person...

113
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:38,680
A person behaving like that comes across as being false.

114
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,220
Someone whose insides and outside are different.

115
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,780
- Do you know that person? 
 - Do I have to know to see that?

116
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,720
You can just tell.

117
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,800
And me?

118
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,660
You?

119
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:55,660
You're the same inside and out.

120
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,970
- And? 
 - Now, all you need is a bit of charm!

121
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:04,160
Ah, that's hard. It's so hard. That's the hardest.

122
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:08,440
But since we're in the same grade we should speak comfortably.

123
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,840
Even so, that's kind of ... We have to consider your face value as sunbaenim, so I don't think we should.

124
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,280
What's so important about the outer appearance?

125
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,440
Mental age is what is important.

126
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,160
I am forever 14 years old! An 8th grader. 8th grade.

127
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:27,450
- Okay! Now, we are friends. 
- Okay!

128
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:30,280
- Friends? 
- Okay, Hui Ah!

129
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,910
You're talking casually? What kind of nonsense is that!

130
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:39,190
Hui Wu! Now, Hui Ah and I are friends.

131
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:43,590
Why are you obsessed with becoming friends with the younger classmates? I don't understand.

132
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:47,580
What do you mean friends? You said you were an 8th grader.

133
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:51,490
- Now, call me Nuna! 
 - Nuna.

134
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:54,060
Nuna! Hui Ah Nuna!

135
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,110
- Nuna! 
- Nuna?

136
00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:00,230
Hey, age doesn't matter.  Let's live comfortably.  Freely!

137
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,670
Have a drink.  Have a drink. Have a drink.

138
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,300
Hey, hey.

139
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,480
 Have a glass. Here, here. 

140
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,570
Let's go for a second round.

141
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:13,900
- Hui Wu, I'm really not drunk. 
 - That's what a drunk person says.

142
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,160
Let's get in, Sunbaenim. Come on.

143
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,500
- I'm really not drunk! The world is. 
 - Get in.

144
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,670
-The world is drunk. 
 - Get in.

145
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:28,410
Hui Wu, you know that I'm holding back a lot right now, right?

146
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:33,280
I really can do anything in this life, you know.

147
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:36,930
What should I do?

148
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:41,340
Should I gobble it right up,

149
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,630
or should I break it to pieces?

150
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:47,050
You can break it, topple it, have it for porridge, or whatever...

151
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:48,650
Get in! Get in!

152
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,940
To Samdo-dong, please.

153
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,460
Crap, what's this?

154
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,490
- You're a  Kkondae. 
 - Yes, have a safe trip, Sunbaenim! 
 (Kkondae: Korean term for Boomers.) 

155
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,720
I'm so tired.

156
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,420
Who are you?

157
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:58,030
Hey. Are you a stalker?

158
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,710
Hey!

159
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:19,270
 Who is he? He's not an ordinary person. 

160
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:21,740
- I think there's been a misunderstanding. 
  - Misunderstanding?

161
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,780
I saw you following us from the bar.

162
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,380
I already told you that you've misunderstood.

163
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:34,140
Then why did you follow us knowing that it would cause a misunderstanding?

164
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,780
Who are you?

165
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,120
Kim Hui Wu.

166
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,450
Manager Park!

167
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:12,330
What are you two doing?

168
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:19,360
Miss. There was a bit of a misunderstanding.

169
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,100
Miss?

170
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:25,250
About that...

171
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:32,610
 I remember who you are now, Kim Hui Ah.  

172
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:41,590
 Kim Geon Yeong, a giant in the Korean business world and chairman of Cheonha Group has passed away at the age of 78.  

173
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,720
  He is the son of the late Kim Sang Man who founded Cheonha Group. 

174
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,870
 Cheonha Group has become a world-renown company 

175
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,880
  Kim Geon Yeong is survived by 

176
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,990
  his eldest son Kim Yong Jun, the executive director of Cheonha Electronics, 

177
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,570
  his second son Kim Seong Jun, managing director of Cheonha Motors 

178
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:55,650
  and Kim Hui Ah. 

179
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:58,450
 The one whose face became known for the first time at her father's funeral, 

180
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:01,310
  Kim Hui Ah, the only daughter of the Chairman Kim Geon Yeong.  

181
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:25,340
 What kind of fate is this now?  

182
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,610
 Hui Yu, can you keep this incident a secret?  

183
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:45,320
 Jo Tae Seop used Cheonha as a slush fund source, but 

184
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,070
  I hate Jo Tae Seop  

185
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:51,850
 if I'm right, I can bring Kim Hui Ah over to my side.  

186
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:09,000
He's not a normal student. 
  Kim Hui Wu 

187
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,680
- His parents are nightshift factory workers? 
 - Yes

188
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,610
He went from placing last to first place?

189
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,930
Is that even possible?

190
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:21,170
He even went to Hankuk University Law School, one of the best schools in the country.

191
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:24,830
And that mere twenty-year-old stood toe-to-toe with you?

192
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:28,940
We don't know how it would have turned out if the young lady hadn't stepped in.

193
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:33,100
- Have you ever lost a hand-to-hand fight with anyone? 
 - No, never.

194
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:39,180
This, this is truly a strange one, hmm?

195
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,060
- Look into him some more. 
 - Okay, sir.

196
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,290
Dad?

197
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:51,350
I heard you got a boyfriend?

198
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:56,770
He's not my boyfriend. He's just a friend.

199
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:59,420
I heard that there was a fight because he thought Jin Hyeok was a stalker.

200
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,600
In the end, it is something to be grateful for.

201
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,030
Yeah. On top of that, the two were neck and neck.

202
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:07,780
While the two of them were flying around in the air,

203
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:11,370
- I thought I was watching a martial arts movie. 
 - Really?

204
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:13,590
He's more interesting the more I get to know him.

205
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:18,780
When did he have time to exercise while studying as hard as he does?

206
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:22,150
And he's polite. And attractive...

207
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:27,150
He is attractive, but he's not my type.

208
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,900
I don't believe you.

209
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,700
It looks like you've already fallen for him.

210
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,890
Of course, not.

211
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:39,050
- Well... it was enough to make me a little conflicted about studying abroad. 
 - Really?

212
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:42,130
In that case, I'll have to ask that guy to keep my daughter here.

213
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:43,490
Really?

214
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:44,920
Wow, so you're serious about this, then?

215
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:48,540
This brat who doesn't even listen to her father.

216
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:51,870
- You're making me sad. 
 - I was joking!

217
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:57,330
 Chairman, Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop is here to see you.  

218
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,620
Send him up.

219
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,580
- I'll head out to school then. 
 - Okay.

220
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,090
Who's this?

221
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:10,550
- Hello. 
 - It's been a long time.

222
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:13,820
I heard that you got into Hankuk University. Congratulations.

223
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:19,910
- Thank you. 
 - Pick your major wisely so that you can become one of the talented young people to lead our country.

224
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:25,180
In the future, artificial intelligence, information, and communication technologies will sweep the globe.

225
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:30,890
Yes. I'll keep that in mind. I'll leave you both to talk.

226
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,210
It's been a long time, Assemblyman.

227
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:35,900
Hui Ah grew up nicely.

228
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,430
She's still young.

229
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,850
- Have a seat. 
 - Sure.

230
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:44,490
 I hate him. 

231
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,950
So good. The instant coffee from my memories.

232
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,320
Pretentious jerk.

233
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,860
- Me? Why? 
 - Hm?

234
00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:00,550
- What? 
  - Oh... you just said I was a pretentious... something or other.

235
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,630
Oh! Not you.

236
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:05,190
- That person. 
 - Ah...

237
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,410
That's what you meant. 
  ...the basic right to live. 

238
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:15,140
 Therefore, members of the National Assembly make systems and laws in order to protect the fairness of society.  

239
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:18,680
Fairness? What a joke. 
  That is the purpose of politics. 

240
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,150
Is Jo Tae Seop a bad person?

241
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:25,570
Bingo. People just don't know it yet.

242
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:28,290
How do you know?

243
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:29,750
Me?

244
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,390
You'll know as time passes.

245
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:36,770
Lies and hypocrisy are bound to come out someday.

246
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,510
Hui Wu!

247
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:44,390
- What's up Gyu Ri? 
 - Are you busy? Can you help me?

248
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:46,060
Oh, sure.

249
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,560
Can you take this to the classroom?

250
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,560
I have to go to a liberal arts class right now, but it's hard to carry it all.

251
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,620
I'll buy you dinner later.

252
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:58,110
- Of course! No problem. But is that what you're reading these days?

253
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:02,220
Oh, I've been taking Western Cultural History, so I'm reading it again. 
  Greek and Roman Mythology  

254
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,690
I'll see you later then!

255
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:05,190
Okay.

256
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,320
I heard you guys came from the same academy?

257
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,730
-  Gyu Ri and me?  Yes. 
- Ah...

258
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,320
You must have spent all day together when you two were studying.

259
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,880
Probably. Why?

260
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,730
You were a shuttle, weren't you? 
  (Shuttle: an errand boy for bullies.) 

261
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:28,590
You seem so used to doing whatever you're told.

262
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,070
Does it seem like that?

263
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,300
I guess you could see it like th—

264
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,400
Take care of mine too, would you?

265
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,270
Yeah, sure!

266
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:41,450
Hey, Hui Ah... wait.

267
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:43,160
Hui Ah.

268
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,800
Hey, brother!

269
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:49,620
Say hello. He’s a friend from med school. His name is: Moon Seong Hwan.

270
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,870
He used to compete for first place in our department.

271
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,910
Hello. I'm Moon Seong Hwan.

272
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:57,630
Yeah, nice to meet you.

273
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,890
He's kind and gentle.

274
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:03,610
 Moon Seong Hwan? That name sounds familiar.  

275
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:09,320
Take Mirae Automobiles and grow the size of the Cheonha company.

276
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:13,090
- That's... 
 - I'll give you some time to think.

277
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:17,580
I don't expect Mirae Automobiles to be sold abroad.

278
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:21,760
How many times has a foreign fund taken over a Korean company and then dine-and-dashed with it?

279
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,410
That's true, but...

280
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:27,080
The creditor bank decided to provide emergency funds for Mirae Automobiles

281
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,420
since they're in dire need of money right now.

282
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,880
That's a temporary fix.

283
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,260
I heard that the amount of debt alone is close to one trillion won.

284
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,920
That's right.

285
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:41,280
If we leave it like this, then Mirae Automobiles will be a bottomless pit.

286
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,760
However, if Mirae gets Cheonha branding, that's a different story.

287
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:51,530
Assemblyman, the trend these days is to establish overseas sites to reduce production costs.

288
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:56,370
The time will soon come when a single robot will be able to handle the tasks of 10,000 people.

289
00:21:56,370 --> 00:22:00,930
Mirae Automobiles, having only domestic factories, is a company with no major benefits for me as a business manager.

290
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:02,540
That's strange.

291
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:07,110
You aren't the type of person who wouldn't understand.

292
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:09,720
There's only one answer to my suggestion.

293
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,410
You have to learn to let things go.

294
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,970
Take Mirae Automobiles.

295
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:26,560
The entire medical college went nuts at the time.

296
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,720
Two geniuses, born maybe once in a hundred years, were both dropping out.

297
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,440
Don't call yourself a genius.

298
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,840
If I don't say it, no one will.

299
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,160
- Maybe that's why. 
 - Ah...

300
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:43,270
Anyway, I dropped out to follow my dreams, and he dropped out to change the world.

301
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,540
You're cool.

302
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:48,320
Hardly. I was merely displaying bravado by myself.

303
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,550
Do you know how hard it is to show bravado without troubling others?

304
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,230
Resolve. Nice, good.

305
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:58,580
I don't know. After studying how to fix people, my interest shifted to making people more comfortable.

306
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,960
I'm not sure if this will end up as 'nice'.

307
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,180
I think it'll become 'nice' as long as you change the name.

308
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:06,270
The app or whatever he created has such a childish name.

309
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,940
- HeuHeuTalk? 
 - It's HaHaTalk!

310
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,970
- HaHaTalk?

311
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:11,780
Yes!

312
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:14,900
 The person who created HaHaTalk, Moon Seong Hwan.  

313
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,920
 Youth entrepreneur's downfall, HaHaTalk Moon Seong Hwan leaves to study abroad. 

314
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,540
 He creates a platform that changes the world, 

315
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:27,030
 but he suffered an intellectual property dispute with Jeil Telecom and lost the trial, 

316
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,750
 and suddenly left to study abroad. 

317
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,760
Hey, Heuheu Talk is better, right?

318
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,760
HeuHeuHeuTalk.

319
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,780
- Is it childish? 
 - No.

320
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,850
It's great actually.

321
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:39,150
If he says he likes it,  then it's really good.

322
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:42,080
Then what, would he change the world with this?

323
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,440
Sure would.

324
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,360
I mean...

325
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,710
That's the feeling I get.

326
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:51,790
Strangely, I trust him.

327
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:52,790
Right?

328
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:53,820
I like it.

329
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,570
I told you to come here—

330
00:23:55,570 --> 00:24:00,470
By the way, it must be a lot of work to do all that on your own, right?

331
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:06,120
I felt limited on my own, both financially and business-wise, so I applied to a large company project contest.

332
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,220
Large company?

333
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:11,120
Yes. It's called the Cheonha Telecom Youth Enterprise Support Project.

334
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,410
I mean, Cheonha Telecom, and not Jeil Telecom?

335
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:16,240
Yes.

336
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,430
They haven't announced the winner yet, but the CEO already contacted him to have a meeting.

337
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:23,800
By chance, do you know the name of the CEO?

338
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,020
I heard it was Chairman Kim Chan II.

339
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:29,400
- Chairman Kim Chan Il? 
- Yes.

340
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:33,420
 Kim Chan Il? 

341
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,110
 Cheonha Telecom Youth Support Project 

342
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:38,050
Disqualify.

343
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:42,300
However, according to the Cheonha economy research report, it has the greatest potential for commercialization—

344
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,830
Hey, did you not understand what I just said?

345
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:48,600
Yes, sir. I’ll do as you say.

346
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:53,080
In addition, secretly prepare a legal team without the company board noticing.

347
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,790
Pardon? Without the company board noticing?

348
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:59,180
Hey, you're going to be moving with me, so just do what I tell you!

349
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,690
Yes, sir. Understood.

350
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:04,380
Once we get the source of Moon Seong Hwan's program,

351
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:08,390
- we'll proceed with patent and copyright registration right away. 
 - Yes.

352
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:11,030
- You can leave now. 
- Yes, sir.

353
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,600
 Cheonha Telecom Youth Support Project  
  Contest Report 

354
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,860
It's me, Manager Han.

355
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,280
 Kim Chan Il 

356
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,400
 Cheonha Telecom CEO Kim Chan Il. "We must raise  customer satisfaction in communication services" 

357
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:38,640
 Cheonha Telecom CEO Kim Chan Il. 

358
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,540
 Kim Chan Il. he's with Cheonha Telecom this time. 

359
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:46,910
 However, he will lure Moon Seong Hwan and transfer to Jeil Telecom soon. 

360
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:51,110
 He will make HaHaTalk a success, gaining wealth and fame. 

361
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,200
 That's our staff member break room. 

362
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,110
 Jeil Telecom 

363
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:57,060
 This sculpture is quite unique. 

364
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,450
 Yes, it represents that everything comes from this egg. 

365
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:02,940
 Kim Chan Il, who was an industrial spy and a minion of Jo Tae Seop. 

366
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,810
 Yes, the wish that everything will be awakened from an egg and built. 

367
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:08,130
 Yes. 

368
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:11,220
 Let me show you the research lab. 

369
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:13,690
 Yes, 

370
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:18,620
 we must awaken from the egg to break into the new world. 

371
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,480
 Hello? 

372
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,390
 What?! 

373
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:29,760
 Don't leave a single thing. 

374
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:35,080
 How dare you search my office!? Who the hell are you?! 

375
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:38,150
 I'm going to ruin all of you! You bastards! 

376
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:43,250
 Who is it? Hey! It's you, right? 

377
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:47,270
 He was known as the hyena of the business world and did not hesitate to be violent or use dirty methods. 

378
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:51,730
 He was a criminal who sold core communication technology and manpower to foreign countries. 

379
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:56,390
 Mr. Kim Chan Il. Release him. 

380
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:59,050
 Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu. 

381
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:03,740
 In addition to the violation of the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Economic Crimes Act, I'm adding obstruction of official business. 

382
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,940
 Ah! So it's you. 

383
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:08,120
 You bastard! Who do you think you are? 

384
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,810
 Hey! Ow! 

385
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:15,640
 Hey, are you confident that you could take me? 

386
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,550
 Yes. Of course. 

387
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:22,990
 I would have added a few more years to his sentence if I had known the truth behind HaHa Talk. 

388
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:25,680
 Kim Chan Il, this time I'll be a little faster 

389
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,350
 to stamp you out completely. 

390
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:37,010
 Sunbaenim is looking for you. 

391
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,340
 The guest is coming in.  

392
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:44,610
Sunbaenim, how do you do?

393
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:46,670
Oh, it's been a while.  Come and sit.

394
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:48,340
Sorry, I'm late.

395
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,900
Hui Wu, have a seat.

396
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,600
 He's already drunk even though it's early in the evening. 

397
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:57,760
I just wanted to have a drink with you guys.

398
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,810
I'll come running to you if you call me, except on my funeral day.

399
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:05,760
Then, I'll come running to you even if I become a ghost after death.

400
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,880
You bastard!

401
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,230
Did I overdo it?

402
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:13,670
Hey... I guess this was why I wanted to see you guys.

403
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:21,540
Okay. Kang Jin, you must be a little more relaxed since you passed the bar exam.

404
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,360
Hui Wu, how are you doing?

405
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,610
Well, I'm working hard so I can meet your expectations.

406
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:32,690
Okay. There's no reason for you not to succeed when you're working so hard.

407
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:35,120
What? Did something bad happen?

408
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:39,670
It's nothing bad. It's just nothing good either.

409
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:45,650
Hey. How come my presence in the prosecutor's office keeps getting smaller?

410
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:50,470
I don't believe that. You were at the top when you were in the training institute.

411
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:51,800
Case.

412
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,540
Case.

413
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,150
I have no cases.

414
00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:01,120
How long do I have to keep arresting small criminals and worry about how many months I should put them in jail for?

415
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,140
How long do I have to be concerned with such things?

416
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:08,850
No big cases are coming my way.

417
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:16,620
Even the great Jang Il Hyeon had a rookie period like that.

418
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,900
A big case, huh?

419
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:29,500
 A world-leading company  
  Cheonha Telecom 

420
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:32,090
Okay!

421
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:36,260
I'll prepare the greatest feast for him to enjoy.

422
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,940
- Here.
 - Yes.

423
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:42,690
What is this?  HaHa Talk project?

424
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:48,190
- Yes. It's a project created by a Min Su's friend. Take a look. 
 - Oh...

425
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:51,060
You came all this way to give me this?

426
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:53,360
Yes. I want to know your thoughts.

427
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,740
- At this hour? 
 - Yes.

428
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:57,430
- Is there no other reason? 
- No.

429
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:04,680
Usually, people meet for personal reasons at a time like this.

430
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,820
I’m usually studying at this hour.

431
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,390
Right.

432
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,370
 HaHaTalk Startup Overview 

433
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:26,630
Hey. This person is full of potential.

434
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:28,440
He's categorically a genius.

435
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,440
A genius even?

436
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,420
In my opinion, yes.

437
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:39,560
This may be just the beginning, but you can solve way more problems with this thing than you think.

438
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,780
You could say it's enough to dominate that market?

439
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:46,070
No, it could even monopolize it depending on the speed.

440
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:49,620
 I knew she would see the potential of this. 

441
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:54,670
I've been carrying such an important thing so precariously.

442
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:56,580
Right?

443
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:00,220
But why are you...

444
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,570
I heard he applied for the Cheonha Telecom project contest.

445
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,510
- Cheonha Telecom? 
 - Yes.

446
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:11,180
They must've seen the potential. The CEO called him to meet him in person.

447
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,780
Is that so?

448
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:17,590
If it's someone who's smart, I bet their eyes would spin the moment they saw him.

449
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:19,830
I knew it was a great idea to ask you.

450
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:23,000
Good! Then take this home and have a good look at it.

451
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,170
Okay.  Well, I also have someone I want to show this to.

452
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:28,980
Alright, counting on you!

453
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:34,000
I got your report.

454
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:45,310
It's a serious project that's worth keeping an eye on.

455
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:50,980
The Cheonha economy research team's prediction was never wrong. So what?

456
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:55,230
Why don't you take this program?

457
00:31:55,230 --> 00:32:00,040
It will be of great help in the creation of your government. It would also be a good foundation for controlling the company.

458
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,770
Stop beating around the bush.

459
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:05,530
I'll take this one in my pocket.

460
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:09,270
And, I'll go to Jeil Telecom.

461
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:17,230
I guess Cheonha Telecom has been dominant in global telecommunication for too long.

462
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:19,320
They don't see the virtue in a win-win situation.

463
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:24,110
Cheonha Group's motto is 'The more you have, the more you want.'

464
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:28,940
- Should I start the process? 
 - There shouldn't be any noise about this.

465
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:33,210
Okay, I'll get it done precisely and quietly.

466
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:35,510
You may leave.

467
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:37,850
Yes, sir.

468
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:39,560
Let's go.

469
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,490
HaHaTalk?

470
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,540
This will become quite an item.

471
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:58,060
 Try this.  

472
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:01,670
My goodness, this is for two people. A serving for two people that feels like it's actually for five people.

473
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:03,660
I don't think it'll be enough for you, so let me know if you need–

474
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,550
Father! I'm sorry for being late.

475
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,510
You said you had an important meeting, how'd you get here so quickly?

476
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:10,710
I had to come quickly. Today is a historical day.

477
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:13,720
They call people like you a filial son!

478
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,330
What are you doing? Don't you see it's crowded with customers?

479
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:19,380
But, isn't this too much for an opening day? It's a huge success.

480
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:22,430
Set up some more ingredients in the kitchen when it gets less crowded.

481
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:24,450
We're already out of ingredients?

482
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:27,540
My goodness, I'm so very excited right now.

483
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:32,940
Our golden braised chicken recipe that could've just rotted in our Kim family, is finally debuting into the world.

484
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:38,320
You're funny. Why is that your recipe? It's my family's recipe that's been handed down since my grandmother.

485
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:43,190
Hey, hey, red pepper paste from father, soy sauce from mother. What a great collaborative fusion recipe! Right?

486
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:47,490
We're such a great married couple. You married so well. Congratulations for meeting such a cool man.

487
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:50,990
- Thank you. 
- Let's go to work. 
 - Excuse me! 

488
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:52,190
Yes, coming!

489
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:53,480
- Excuse me! 
- Yes.

490
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,040
- Three more portions, please. 
- Yes, I'll bring them.

491
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:59,660
 Excuse me! Over here! 

492
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:02,660
 Okay. Yes! 

493
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:11,720
- I have an early meeting, so I'll leave first. 
- All right.

494
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:17,490
I also have an early class. So I'll head out too.

495
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:19,400
See you later, guys.

496
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,580
What?

497
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,560
I have something to tell you.

498
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,230
What it is?

499
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:35,550
I have a great business item. May I talk about it?

500
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:39,330
I think it'll bring a huge boon to our company.

501
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:47,400
It's called HaHaTalk. A senior from our medical school created this communication platform.

502
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:51,950
It precisely targets the emerging smart phone world.

503
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:55,920
You know that, right? That this will take the place of computers in the future?

504
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:59,770
How can that help our company?

505
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:06,500
Listen carefully. A huge amount of people's information will be gathered through that platform.

506
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:13,490
Then, we can use that to analyze consumers' tendencies, and also plan a surefire strategy for the future.

507
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:16,130
Don't you think it'll be helpful in various ways?

508
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:19,580
But that Sunbae applied to the Cheonha Telecom

509
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:23,950
Youth Support program with that platform.

510
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:28,330
We can't give extra points for acquaintances. I'm sure you're aware.

511
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:33,230
Of course. I'm telling you because I heard President Kim contacted him already.

512
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:37,650
Wait, he contacted him personally?

513
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:41,560
They have an appointment to meet soon.

514
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:56,910
I mean, who could've imagined that such a young person was planning such a platform?

515
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:01,970
Let me be straight with you.

516
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:04,870
I think this won't work for the contest.

517
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:10,250
- Excuse me? 
 - Then why do you think I asked to meet with you?

518
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:13,940
You lost sleep, couldn't eat properly,

519
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:16,480
and toiled endlessly to make this,

520
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:21,130
but now you're out of development money, and you're at the edge of it all.

521
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:25,370
That's a common problem amongst startup developers.

522
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:28,280
So...

523
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:33,170
I'm considering a proposal for you.

524
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:36,590
I'll help you receive investments from Jeil Telecom.

525
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:40,200
Sorry? But you're with Cheonha Telecom–

526
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,930
No, no. Even if I'm the CEO, I'm just an employee.

527
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:50,210
Cheonha's methods are outdated. They don't understand this kind of new platform at all.

528
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:53,360
However, Jeil is different.

529
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:59,850
Mr. Moon Seong Hwan, look at the big picture. The influence your talent will have.

530
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:06,570
If you think beyond the terms of the company, the nation, and even mankind as a whole, then the company name doesn't matter.

531
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:12,290
And right now, it's more important that you acquire a steady development fund.

532
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:15,080
Yes... but...

533
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:20,630
However, there's one condition.

534
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:24,950
Since we will invest huge amounts of money without holding back,

535
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:29,050
you must share the development process of HaHaTalk.

536
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:35,380
Let's work together. It's an opportunity that won't come again.

537
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,650
Seong Hwan!

538
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,540
Okay.

539
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,220
Do you have what I asked you for?

540
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:03,860
Here.

541
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:08,580
Min Su said I should take precautions.

542
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,970
Good job.

543
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:12,440
I said I'd think about it like you told me to.

544
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:16,040
But... what should I do now?

545
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,170
Are you aware of wisdom property rights...

546
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:21,820
I mean, intellectual property rights?

547
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:22,940
Yes.

548
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:29,010
Intellectual property rights are organized into four categories including patents, trademarks, design rights, and copyrights.

549
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:33,440
Because you have to get exclusivity as soon as possible, we have to focus on patenting it.

550
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:40,370
If either Cheonha Telecom or Jeil Telecom is interested in HaHaTalk, there are only two things they can do.

551
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:46,340
First, they invest a lot of their capital and manpower to create something similar,

552
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:51,480
or they steal yours by any means necessary.

553
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:56,110
The only way to fight with them right now is head-on.

554
00:38:56,110 --> 00:39:02,210
So, you go ahead and try to finish your project as soon as possible, and we'll hurry up on patenting it in the meantime.

555
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:03,630
Okay.

556
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:09,560
- Good. Make sure there are no problems in opening Smile Talk over the next month. 
 - Yes, sir.

557
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,710
How's the navigation app development going?

558
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:15,950
Well, we're in the process of discussing with the developer so...

559
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:19,250
So, how long do we have to wait until we can release it?

560
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:23,050
Four... about three months...

561
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,230
- Next month. 
 - That's...

562
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:29,680
Hey, it must not come out later than S Map. Do you hear me?

563
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,870
Yes. I understand.

564
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,610
Next. What about 'Thunder Sand'?

565
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:38,710
We got the source code from the developer and deposited the money to his wife's account.

566
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:45,340
See? People have no morals or anything when it comes to money. Moon Seong Hwan should've been like this!

567
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:49,260
We're planning to release it in 15 days. They're planning it for next month.

568
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:53,880
Good job. You should learn something from him, you fool! Damn it!

569
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,670
 Law Firm 

570
00:39:56,670 --> 00:40:00,070
This law firm specializes in Cheonha Group lawsuits, though.

571
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:05,890
Didn't you know? This is the best law firm in Korea when it comes to patents.

572
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:09,620
I know, but it feels unsettling that it's here of all places.

573
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:13,550
Hello! Sorry, you've had to wait.

574
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:17,070
I’m the associate attorney,  Hwang Seon Ham.

575
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:22,000
Hello, sunbaenim! I'm a student at Hankuk University School of Law, Kim Hui Wu.

576
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,400
I'm Lee Min Su of the same department.

577
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,960
Oh, then... that makes you my juniors.

578
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,550
Nice to meet you. Sit, sit.

579
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:31,420
So, how can I help you?

580
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:36,400
It's just that one of the sunbaes I know developed this program,

581
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,860
and I have many questions related to patent registration.

582
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:41,330
Patent? What is it?

583
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:42,510
 HaHaTalk Project 

584
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:44,760
This here. It's called HaHaTalk.

585
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:49,800
It's a program that makes communication possible by using the data between users.

586
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,220
Oh, I see.

587
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:54,080
Cheonha Telecom CEO contacted us about it too.

588
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,860
Really?!

589
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:02,120
If you look here, in the future...

590
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:05,690
Really? Is that so?

591
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,000
Thank you, Lawyer Hwang. Let's meet up for a meal soon.

592
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,390
Okay, go ahead. No, no, you go ahead. Okay.

593
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:21,040
Kids these days grow up without getting beat up enough.

594
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:23,580
Hey, get in here!

595
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:30,280
Did you call for me, sir?

596
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:33,530
Wasn't there an errand center that did cleanup jobs for us before?

597
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:36,790
Kim Hui Wu, did you visit the law firm to...

598
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:40,010
Yes. I went there to stir up Kim Chan Il.

599
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:42,770
People make mistakes when they get hasty.

600
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:44,710
Use the enemy instead of avoiding them?

601
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:48,380
- Exactly. 
 - You have a knack for strategizing. You're ready for the army.

602
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:55,130
How could you say something so dreadful? How could I go back there... again?

603
00:41:57,470 --> 00:42:00,780
What? What's wrong? You went already?

604
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:03,970
I have to go, of course.

605
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:09,420
Stop talking about useless stuff and focus on the job, please.

606
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:12,860
Why are you annoyed? Do you want to eat  Ppogeul-i later? 
  (Ramen cooked in the packaging, often eaten in the army.) 

607
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:15,850
Ppogeul-i my ass!

608
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:26,320
Hui Ah told me something quite interesting a little while ago.

609
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:30,780
She said that HaHaTalk, an app created by one of her seniors would change the world.

610
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:33,680
Really? How?

611
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:38,860
She said that a lot of people would put their information up on that platform.

612
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:43,020
She says it could be used to plan for a surefire victory.

613
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:45,730
Hui Ah is quite clever.

614
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:48,340
Yes. She is very intelligent.

615
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:52,950
- But, there's something strange too. 
 - Something strange?

616
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:56,320
It was submitted to the Cheonha Telecommunications Contest,

617
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:00,860
but President Kim Chan Il personally reached out to the app developer,

618
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:03,380
even though he's the person who should be the most impartial.

619
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:06,640
I made him the president of Chunha Telecommunications because of your recommendation.

620
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,050
But, he's changed a lot.

621
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:13,050
I thought he was a useful person.

622
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:15,190
It looks like I chose the wrong person.

623
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:20,170
Since you said that, let's get to the point.

624
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:24,380
Here it is, sunbaenim.

625
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:27,710
- Is this for real? 
 -Yes.

626
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:30,260
It's evidence that Chunha Telecommunications used ruthless tactics

627
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:35,560
to steal the software developed by one of the contestants.

628
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,580
If you look here, you'll see what was captured on surveillance footage.

629
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:42,260
You can probably learn a lot from this investigation.

630
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:45,680
- Of course! There are a lot of problems here.
 - Yes.

631
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:50,630
This is evidence that these national competitions are not transparent.

632
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:54,670
This is a big crime even for President Kim Chan Il.

633
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:58,300
- Of course, it is. 
 - Anyway, thank you.

634
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:02,560
Infringement on intellectual property and abuses by executives of large corporations

635
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:06,030
along with unfair contest practices and industrial espionage.

636
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:08,820
Wow, this could turn out to be a big scandal.

637
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:14,210
And if we find evidence of patent infringement on top, the case will be huge.

638
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:18,710
Exactly. Of course, you would be able to see the big picture.

639
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:22,660
This kind of thing is probably happening all of the time at these kinds of companies.

640
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,400
Of course. Exactly that.

641
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,650
After raising the issue with Cheonha Telecom,

642
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:32,900
demand an extensive inspection of large corporations.

643
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:37,390
- It's a good picture. 
 - As usual, I'm glad I came to you with this.

644
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:44,110
And, I don't know if I should tell you this...

645
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:45,920
Is there more?

646
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:55,170
I heard a rumor while investigating President Kim Chan Il.

647
00:44:55,170 --> 00:44:58,760
Kim Chan Il and Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop have some sort of relationship.

648
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,340
What did you say?

649
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:04,190
Jo Tae Seop is on the National Assembly of Sciences, Technology, Information Broadcasting, and Communications committee

650
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:08,870
to give Cheonha Telecommunications special treatment.

651
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:10,350
- Really? 
 - Yes.

652
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:13,510
Are you really saying there is some dirt on Jo Tae Seop right now?

653
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:17,970
The reason that Kim Chan Il is going around running his mouth

654
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:20,290
is probably because he is immature.

655
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:23,830
From Assemblyman Jo's point of view, this is probably going to be quite the headache.

656
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:25,720
Hold on.

657
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:33,400
This case is huge. If I resolve this well, I'll definitely get recognized by my superiors.

658
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,400
I mean, aren't IT-related cases especially sensitive nowadays?

659
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,000
Of course.

660
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:42,120
Hey! Kim Hui Wu.

661
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:45,880
- You did a surprisingly good job. Thank you. 
 - Not at all.

662
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:52,300
I'm satisfied with just helping you advance in your career a tiny bit.

663
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:56,810
Of course. You're truly like a little brother to me.

664
00:45:56,810 --> 00:46:02,220
Hey! When this case ends, let's meet with Kang Jin!

665
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:05,220
Let's go somewhere nice and celebrate for the whole night.

666
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,660
Of course. Let me know when.

667
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:15,050
- It's over. They're all dead. 
  - I wish you the best, Sunbaenim!

668
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:39,890
Okay. I understand. This...

669
00:46:39,890 --> 00:46:42,870
- needs to be handled quietly. 
 - I'll leave no room for errors.

670
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:44,370
Good.

671
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:00,360
Assemblyman, it's President Kim Seok Hun.

672
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,700
- Yes, it's me. 
 -  Hello Assemblyman.

673
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:07,370
President Kim Chan Il has been charged with unfair contest practices, infringement of intellectual property

674
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:10,600
and industrial espionage by the prosecutor's office.

675
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:14,600
It looks like he even went as far as to sell your support of him.

676
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:18,480
I know. I'll take care of it.

677
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:22,800
Things are getting interesting.

678
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:27,710
Kim Geon Yeong only caught a scent of it, but the information made it all the way to the prosecutor's office.

679
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:30,650
Who's the one behind all of this? Who?

680
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:32,520
I'll make preparations.

681
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:36,000
- Do it quietly. 
 - Yes.

682
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,380
Hold on. Chief Kim, you take care of this.

683
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:41,790
Okay. I understand.

684
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:47,750
It's getting noisy.

685
00:47:54,820 --> 00:48:01,160
 The person who benefitted most from HaHaTalk in the past life was Jo Tae Seop. 

686
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:05,090
  As long as HaHaTalk can't find the right investors,  

687
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:08,490
 it can always fall prey to Jo Tae Seop. 

688
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:14,510
 Nara Bank 

689
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:20,130
 Nara Bank  
  Wu Yong Su 

690
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:35,400
You called me at the crack of dawn and this is where you wanted to meet?

691
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,310
Teacher, you don't like exercise, right?

692
00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:44,720
I'd rather read another newspaper if I had time to spare.

693
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:47,200
From now on, let's work out in the morning together!

694
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,050
Why are you like this all of a sudden?

695
00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:52,330
I need you to live long and healthy so that

696
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:55,790
I can repay all the blessings that you've given me.

697
00:48:55,790 --> 00:48:57,650
If you have something to say, say it.

698
00:48:57,650 --> 00:49:00,390
I don't like it when you beat around the bush.

699
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:02,860
Teacher...

700
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:08,170
I'm thinking of investing the money you gave me in a start-up company.

701
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:12,710
It's the money that's in your pocket. Why would you ask me?

702
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:13,760
But!

703
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:17,330
Teacher, teacher!

704
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:22,780
That's all I needed.

705
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:24,200
You arrived just in time.

706
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,270
I've been wanting to throw a celebration party.

707
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:27,320
A celebration party?

708
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:29,450
We should spread the good news!

709
00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:33,100
Oh, good news... What's that?

710
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:34,900
I got news from Cheonhwa!

711
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:38,440
And it was from Chairman Kim Geon Yeong himself at that.

712
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:42,690
He apologized and offered to invest.

713
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:45,850
He said that they were preparing Cheonha Communication,

714
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:49,060
An internet company that is already separate from Telecommunication.

715
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:54,520
 I got rid of Kim Chan Il and yet... Did I fail in changing his fate? 

716
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:57,640
Honestly, it's almost done.

717
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:01,700
When we invest and it succeeds, I'll make sure to pay you back.

718
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:04,760
As to money, you can't do anything, but ...

719
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,350
Yeah.

720
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:09,700
Are you going to take the deal?

721
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:13,040
Yes! Because it's a pretty good deal.

722
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,020
I see.

723
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:19,940
I am curious about something.

724
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:23,120
- What is it? 
 - Why did you believe in me?

725
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:26,620
Oh, that? I had three reasons.

726
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:31,630
Number one is because CEO Kim Chan Il tried to play me like you said.

727
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:33,940
You were like a fortune teller!

728
00:50:35,110 --> 00:50:37,030
 Seong Hwan! 

729
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:43,880
 Be careful of CEO Kim Chan Il. 

730
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:49,930
 If you meet him, he'll show you a disadvantageous contract and suggest Jeil Telecom instead of Cheonha. 

731
00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:53,650
 You must never... take that deal. 

732
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:56,720
You should always trust a fortune teller! Ah!

733
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:01,220
You were also right to recommend I live here for the time being too.

734
00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:12,540
 If I hadn't listened to you, it would've taken me months to just recover. 

735
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:15,410
- What's the second reason? 
  - Min Su!

736
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:17,210
- Seonbae Min Su? 
 - Yes!

737
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:21,050
To tell you the truth, the HaHaTalk idea was Min Su's.

738
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:25,870
A world where people communicate on smartphones using the data communication function.

739
00:51:25,870 --> 00:51:30,770
Min Su told me not to tell you but I'm just telling you the truth.

740
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,750
 Seonbae Lee Min Su. Of course! 

741
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:37,330
I said something to Min Su one time.

742
00:51:37,330 --> 00:51:41,100
If I succeed with his idea, then I'd give him money!

743
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:43,520
But he said he didn't need money.

744
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:47,370
He said that he could be the richest man in the world if he just put his mind to it!

745
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:50,110
He really is a genius.

746
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:55,760
 Here's the chicken you fools! Come get it! 

747
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,020
Anyway, congratulations!

748
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:58,470
- Thank you! 
 - Congrats!

749
00:51:58,470 --> 00:52:00,390
Thanks!

750
00:52:05,010 --> 00:52:08,060
Chicken and beer are the best!

751
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:11,800
Ah! Let's continue with what we were talking about earlier.

752
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,690
- What's the third reason? 
 - Ah!

753
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:18,940
I got a text right before I met with CEO Kim Chan Il.

754
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:20,500
Here it is.

755
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:22,530
Here.

756
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:28,790
I thought that it was strange so I called but some guy picked up and said that he never sent such a text message. 
  Beware of President Kim Chan Il. -Pluto- 

757
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:30,550
And...

758
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:36,000
Give it! What is it?

759
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,080
 'Patent war' holding back start-up companies 

760
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:46,090
Those are all articles related to CEO Kim Chan Il.

761
00:52:51,490 --> 00:52:55,000
 Who is it? Why...? 

762
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:13,920
Assemblyman, why don't you move up your ranking to the next dan ( level ) now?

763
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:19,050
I think you've exceeded the pro first dan.

764
00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:22,400
It's because you help me often.

765
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:25,700
I learned a lot today too.

766
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:27,480
Assemblyman!

767
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:31,300
Drag him out.

768
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:35,790
Let's stop here for today.

769
00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:39,230
Yes sir. Well then, I'll see you again next time.

770
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:45,980
Please save me, Assemblyman!

771
00:53:47,450 --> 00:53:51,400
You look like you've suffered a lot.

772
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:54,460
Don't be like that and sit down

773
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,770
Yes sir!

774
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:07,290
The two hours I spend playing baduk once a week is the only time I take a break.

775
00:54:07,290 --> 00:54:09,040
I'm so sorry, it was an urgent matter.

776
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:13,550
This match is a game where I've been on the edge of losing for three weeks now.

777
00:54:14,470 --> 00:54:17,030
I like the phrase "Too big to fail."

778
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:21,910
Even if the sky falls, there's always a way to survive.

779
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:23,830
Thank you, Assemblyman.

780
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:30,680
However, if there's a Gonma early on, it must be abandoned. 
  (Gonma: a term in go, a stone that's hard to save.) 

781
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:34,980
A player needs to see the big picture.

782
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:39,250
The moment you get tied up in a stone that's hard to save, your whole game will be in danger.

783
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:43,170
Assemblyman, please, just give me one, one more chance–

784
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:52,830
Thanks to you, I got an excellent idea. This was the move.

785
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:57,600
- Assemblyman! 
 - Manager Han.

786
00:55:03,630 --> 00:55:05,630
Let him out.

787
00:55:08,690 --> 00:55:10,780
Assemblyman... Assemblyman, just one more...

788
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:13,070
one more chance, please–

789
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:33,690
 A dog who betrayed you once won't have trouble doing it again. 

790
00:55:33,690 --> 00:55:37,190
 So I would like to make a suggestion. 

791
00:55:37,190 --> 00:55:38,380
 Go ahead. 

792
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:43,320
 Why don't you just get rid of a dog without the basics, and work with me? 

793
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:47,810
 Cheonha should lead the communication industry, not Jeil. 

794
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:52,070
 I hope you would support Cheonha more with this opportunity. 

795
00:55:52,070 --> 00:55:56,190
 If you give me a positive answer, the talk we had about Mirae Automobiles earlier... 

796
00:55:56,190 --> 00:56:00,770
 I'll consider it in a positive way. 

797
00:56:00,770 --> 00:56:04,160
Yes. I'll relay your message.

798
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:14,430
Assemblyman, we got a call from Chairman Kim Geon Yeong's office.

799
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:17,880
He made an agreement to work with Moon Seong Hwan with HahaTalk.

800
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:21,990
Good. That was a long way around.

801
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:25,920
The uncomfortable situation with Cheonha is now back under my control.

802
00:56:27,530 --> 00:56:30,750
Now, I just hope it all ends well.

803
00:56:33,210 --> 00:56:35,260
Why is it taking him so long to buy some drinks?!

804
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:38,980
He left ten minutes ago to buy it. You're so impatient!

805
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:42,420
I know right. Why am I so impatient?

806
00:56:44,350 --> 00:56:45,490
Hurry, turn on the TV!

807
00:56:45,490 --> 00:56:47,320
The TV?

808
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,540
Why what's wrong?

809
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:56,700
 This just in. The CEO of Cheonha Telecom Kim Chan Il has killed himself by jumping off a building. 

810
00:56:56,700 --> 00:57:01,890
 CEO Kim Chan Il threw himself off of a building in Haero-gu, Seoul. 

811
00:57:01,890 --> 00:57:05,060
- What is this? 
  CEO Kim was taken to Seoul Yeongil hospital 

812
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:07,220
 right after he was found and received CPR... 

813
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:12,670
 Due to Kim Chan Il's death, this case has no right of prosecution. It's done.  
  but he wasn't able to... 

814
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:16,390
 Jo Tae Seop has cut off the tail. 

815
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:18,980
 Completely. 

816
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:25,090
 Pluto? 

817
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:33,540
- Homework? 
 - Yes.

818
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:37,400
It's so fun learning mythology after always looking at law books.

819
00:57:40,310 --> 00:57:42,550
Are you also reading Greek or Roman mythology?

820
00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:43,830
No, why?

821
00:57:43,830 --> 00:57:48,040
Pluto, that's another name of the god of death, Hades.

822
00:57:50,930 --> 00:57:52,950
Hades...

823
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:58,310
One second.

824
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,370
Yes, Seonbae?

825
00:58:02,370 --> 00:58:03,740
I found him.

826
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:08,260
- Who? 
 - The owner of the phone that sent a text to Seong Hwan.

827
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:13,070
He's a part time employee at a convenience store, and they borrowed his phone and sent the text.

828
00:58:13,070 --> 00:58:16,130
I'm with the part-timer right now so hurry up.

829
00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:19,520
We have to check it.

830
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:23,040
I was the fool for lending my phone over her looks.

831
00:58:24,010 --> 00:58:25,760
I thought there was something strange about that woman.

832
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,170
- A woman? 
- Yes!

833
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:30,350
Hey! He said it was a woman! You heard right? It's a woman.

834
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:36,170
Let's see here. You said she came in after an old man who bought five bottles of rice wine, yes?

835
00:58:36,170 --> 00:58:37,830
Yes.

836
00:58:45,510 --> 00:58:47,320
Right there!

837
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:49,260
Right after that.

838
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:54,320
Is this the right girl?

839
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:55,940
Yes!

840
00:59:08,970 --> 00:59:10,110
 That girl is...! 

841
00:59:10,110 --> 00:59:15,270
 Pluto, that's another name of the god of death, Hades.
