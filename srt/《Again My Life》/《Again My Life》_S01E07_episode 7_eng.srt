 Lee Kyung Young

 Again My Life 

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,910
What if we're wrong about this?

7
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,140
Oh, my back.

8
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,510
You've arrived!

9
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,980
I'm telling you, it's fresh!

10
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,820
Of course! I'm not a newbie in this business!

11
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,020
What?  Aren't you working?

12
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,190
Oh, yes, sorry.

13
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,240
- Just a sec. 
 - You should have been careful!

14
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,880
- Hey, pay attention! 
 - I'm sorry.

15
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,060
- You should have watched where you were going.
  - Make sure you pick up every one of them.

16
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,650
Yes, yes, sir.

17
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,790
Hello? What do you mean a problem?

18
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,450
- What is this? 
 - I'm telling you it's truly grade-A this time.

19
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,650
It's really grade-A.

20
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,440
Good.

21
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,000
- What do you think you're doing? Are you crazy, you bastard? 
 - Prosecutor?

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,530
Of course, he's crazy. Hard not to be.

23
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,720
Good job.

24
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,360
Innocent civilians have been dragged into a crime scene. Wouldn't you go crazy?

25
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,850
Bastard, what are you?

26
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,280
Isn't that right, Hyeon Jong?

27
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,820
Don't be flustered. Come here.

28
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,350
Let's begin.

29
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,580
- Okay!  
 - Okay. Let's go.

00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,090
 Episode 7 

31
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:08,850
Boys, take care of Mr. Prosecutor here.

32
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:11,800
Come on, guys. Let's not make this difficult.

33
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,480
Stay back.

34
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,150
♫  Hey, you're so cold.  That evil leer  ♫

51
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:07,270
Hey, Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu. Everything's been taken care of here perfectly. How about you?

52
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,390
Hey, don't frown and go with a happy heart!

53
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:13,090
We're wrapping up too. Thank you for everything, Sunbaenim.

54
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,000
♫  Oh Bring it on Bring it on  ♫

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,790
♫  Bring it on Oh Yeah  ♫

56
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,240
It's all been sorted out, Chief.

57
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,890
I will begin interrogating Mun Gu Jun right away.

58
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:34,600
I believe I gave you more than enough time.

59
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:42,350
Fine. We found something interesting.

60
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,910
Here.

61
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:49,170
In addition to investigating illegal gambling, human trafficking, and drugs,

62
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:52,100
we looked into the bidding for government contracts in Gimsan City and

63
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:57,690
we discovered that you embezzled 3.8 billion won through fraudulent contracts.

64
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:02,380
The problem is the trio who saw these contracts,

65
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,720
the mayor, police chief, and assemblyman

66
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:10,530
were apparently furious that you scooped up all the money.

67
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,460
What will you do? It looks like you'll take the fall for everything again.

68
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,560
So you'll stubbornly stick to your right to remain silent?

69
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:33,870
Okay. Then keep your lips sealed so you can protect those high-ranking officials

70
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:38,780
and rot in prison all alone for the rest of your life, all right?

71
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,580
Thank you for your time.

72
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,400
Wait.

73
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,680
- I'll talk. 
 - Yes!

74
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,080
- Sung Ho.  
 - Yes, sir.

75
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,020
- Prepare for a press conference. 
 - Yes, sir.

76
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,240
 Gimsan Regional Prosecutors' Office 

77
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,580
 Prosecution Service 

78
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,840
He is here.

79
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:42,220
I am Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu at the Gimsan Branch Office.

80
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:47,500
I will now begin the press briefing on the Yuchae Gang, a criminal organization in Gimsan.

81
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,260
 Early this morning, the Gimsan Branch Office, 

82
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,350
  under the leadership of Deputy Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun of the Central Prosecutor's Office, 

83
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:58,840
 arrested all members of a criminal organization specializing in drugs and human trafficking. 

84
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:03,710
The case started with a campaign to eradicate the Yuchae Gang

85
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:07,750
which was operating an illegal gambling house in Gimsan.

86
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:12,630
Investigation revealed the gang was linked to criminal organizations

87
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,270
dealing in drugs and human trafficking.

88
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:19,690
Also, the relationship between the Yuchae gang and the local government officials was discovered.

89
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:24,490
We will summon all the relevant officials for questioning.

90
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:28,360
- So far, we've confirmed that these government officials had— 
- Prosecutor Kim.

91
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,200
Please excuse me for a moment.

92
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,420
Chief Jeon wants to speak with you urgently.

93
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,480
Yes, Chief Jeon.

94
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:57,520
Pardon me? What do you mean?

95
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,070
Understood.

96
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,190
My apologies. Let's continue.

97
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:28,180
So far, we've confirmed the involvement of

98
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:32,620
- Police Chief Jang Hae Jin... 
 - What?  Jang Hae Jin?

99
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:38,460
and Kim Sang Tae, the mayor of Gimsan.

100
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,590
That's it. Thank you.

101
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,260
What?

102
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,810
- Does that mean... 
 - A question, please.

103
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:51,070
What? What about Assemblyman Gu?

104
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,730
 Today morning, the 4th Deputy Chief of Prosecutors' Office Kim Seok Hun 

105
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,880
- Reduce the volume. 
 -  from the Anti-Corruption Investigation Department... 

106
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,050
- Okay. 
 -  was arranging drug distribution and human trafficking. 

107
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:05,190
I nearly lost everything because of that kid.

108
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:08,540
You saved me, sir. Thank you so much.

109
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,860
- Assemblyman Gu. 
 - Yes, sir.

110
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,770
Are you confident that you'll win the next election?

111
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,290
For my constituency, I am certain that I will win as long as I'm nominated.

112
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:25,740
Right, my question is... are you confident that you will be nominated?

113
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:32,310
Please help me just once more. I will devote my life wholly to serving you, sir.

114
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:34,910
You'll devote your life?

115
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:40,050
You see, people vote for us because they can't stand the Daehan Party, not because they like us.

116
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:44,720
They hate the robbers so much that they'd rather vote for swindlers.

117
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,710
- Do you understand?  
- Yes, sir.

118
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:49,390
You'd better be very careful from now on.

119
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,270
Yes, sir. I will heed your advice.

120
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,360
You can go now.

121
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,150
- Manager Han. 
 - Yes, sir.

122
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,400
What was his name again?

123
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,350
Do you mean Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu, sir?

124
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:12,120
Right, Kim Hui Wu. Kim Seok Hun was right.

125
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,890
That kid is really something.

126
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:17,000
Would you like me to arrange a meeting, sir?

127
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,810
Yes. As soon as he arrives in Seoul.

128
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,770
- Understood, sir.  
- Good.

129
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:51,060
 Again My Life  

130
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:56,060
Chief Jeon, give me a reason I can understand.

131
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:59,430
Why did you tell me to leave Assemblyman Gu out?

132
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,450
Chief Jeon.

133
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:09,450
Deputy Chief Kim Seok Hun called me

134
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:12,290
and said we'd have to leave his name out

135
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:16,990
if we wanted to return to Seoul.

136
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,150
Does that answer your question?

137
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,830
- Yes, sir. 
 - Then get back to work.

138
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:28,960
- Be available this evening. 
- Yes, sir.

139
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,320
Kim Seok Hun got Gu Wuk Cheong out of this?

140
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,140
But they're not affiliated in any way.

141
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:58,900
 Do you think a few names on that ledger is enough to lock me up? 

142
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,700
 Don't you know who's got my back? 

143
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:12,110
Oh!  The person who's got his back is Jo Tae Seop.

144
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,680
 Please help me, sir! 

145
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,670
 Gu Wuk Cheong begged Jo Tae Seop for help. 

146
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:20,490
 So now, Jo Tae Seop has leverage over Gu. 

147
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:27,890
 But I also hold Wuk Cheong's weakness.  

148
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:31,560
 I may be able to use it as a weapon when I strike at  Jo Tae Seop. 

149
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,650
- I told you about it.  
- Yes, it's delicious.

150
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:37,480
Investigator Oh.

151
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:46,960
Could you bring Lee Yeon Seok to the interview room?

152
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,210
Yes, sir.

153
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:52,130
- Oh, and what are you doing this evening? 
 - Why do you ask?

154
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:54,520
The past few days have been quite stressful.

155
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,240
Why don't we have dinner together? With Chief Jeon too.

156
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:02,610
I was worried for a second. I must decline.

157
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:06,290
I'd like to go home at a decent time for once.

158
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:08,570
- I see. You want to go home. 
- I do.

159
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:11,100
- Then you should. 
- I will.

160
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,360
Hey, how are you feeling?

161
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm still aching all over.

162
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:42,850
- Let's see. Lee Yeon Seok. Age 21.  You didn't go to high school.
 - That's not true.

163
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,890
- What? 
- I dropped out of high school.

164
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:48,150
- It's the same thing. 
 - No, it's different.

165
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:51,860
Fine. You dropped out of high school.

166
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,960
You worked as an enforcer to pay your mother's hospital bills?

167
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,080
- I'm a freelancer. 
 - Wh-What?

168
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,820
- Sorry, freelancer? 
- Yes, sir.

169
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,960
Okay, you're a freelancer.

170
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,340
That's cool.

171
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,210
Hey, Sang Man. It's me. Call Gimsan Hospital now

172
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:16,710
and pay Ms. Kim Jung Ok's bills in full.

173
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:19,590
Also, have them transfer her to Chunha Hospital in Seoul.

174
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:23,990
I don't care how much it costs. Make sure she gets the best treatment possible.

175
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,710
Sure.

176
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,480
- That's your payment in advance. 
- Sorry?

177
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,110
You're a young first-time offender, so you'll be released on probation.

178
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:38,560
Move to Seoul as soon as your trial is over. And...

179
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,070
call this number. Get a job and study.

180
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:48,800
- And take good care of your mother. 
 - Wait.

181
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,180
What are you talking about?

182
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:59,760
You said you were a freelancer. I want to hire you. Are you in or not?

183
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,460
I'm in.

184
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:20,030
Good. Then I'll see you later.

185
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,630
Yes, sir.

186
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:03,650
- No sign of him yet? 
- No, sir.

187
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:06,710
- He hasn't even called? 
- Should I try calling him?

188
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:09,180
No, don't bother.

189
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:13,100
Why do you think Kim Seok Hun is being like this?

190
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,460
I'd say he's waging a silent protest.

191
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:18,050
- Against me? 
- Yes.

192
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,500
As you know, the periodic personnel reshuffle is coming up.

193
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:25,090
- He agreed to omit Assemblyman Gu without complaint. 
 - So?

194
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:30,000
You haven't promised him anything yet.

195
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:35,820
The ultimate goal of Kim Seok Hun is the prosecutor general title.

196
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,430
If he's not promoted this time, his plan won't work.

197
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:42,180
He might think that he'd never get another chance.

198
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,870
He wants me to lay a stepping stone to the prosecutor general position.

199
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:48,850
Yes, sir. He'll want to become the head of the Central District Prosecutors' Office.

200
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:52,470
I was going to time it with the presidential election.

201
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:54,560
He wants to cut a deal with me?

202
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,160
Yes, sir.

203
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,310
- So what do you think? 
 - As you know, Deputy Chief Kim

204
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:02,790
has never once, up to now, asked you for a favor.

205
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:06,410
- Right. 
- But this time, it'll be different.

206
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:08,930
I suggest you offer him a carrot first.

207
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:12,490
Make him chief of the Central District Prosecutors' Office

208
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:15,820
and give him more power so I can keep control over the prosecution?

209
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,410
Yes, sir.

210
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,620
Call him.

211
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:35,690
Do you know how long I've been working as a prosecutor? It's been 22 years.

212
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:41,300
As you all know, I was ousted and sent here for refusing to follow unfair orders.

213
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:46,920
They wanted me to end my career here in Gimsan.

214
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,400
So I decided to take a risk.

215
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,160
- Take a risk? 
 - I wanted to trust what I saw in your eyes.

216
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,810
 I will send you to Seoul. 

217
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,920
  You have no good reason. But you came to take me to Seoul? 

218
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,990
 - Reason? I'll find you one. 

219
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,690
 - Tell me why I should do that?
 - Because you need power to  realize justice. 

220
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:08,480
I could tell that you were different from the usual rookie prosecutors.

221
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:16,820
I have yet to come across a rookie who is as fearless and arrogant as you are.

222
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:22,610
So if it were you, I could truly expect to return to Seoul.

223
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:24,720
And I was right.

224
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,230
And so... I trust you now.

225
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,890
- Thank you, sir. 
- No, I'll be honest.

226
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:35,420
I don't want to stop here.

227
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,990
I'll think of you as my last chance,

228
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:43,320
and this damn world where the wicked prosper and the righteous suffer...

229
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,280
I want to change this world.

230
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:51,930
All right. Now, tell me your story.

231
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:56,300
Now that we're in the same boat, I need to know where you're headed.

232
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,440
Yes, of course.

233
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,090
You graduated first from the judicial training institute. What are you doing in Gimsan?

234
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:07,200
- I came here because I needed you. 
- Why would you need me?

235
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,650
You're not afraid of those with power.

236
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:17,560
No, you may fear them. But you don't avoid dealing with them.

237
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:22,360
I firmly believe that the prosecution needs someone like you.

238
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:26,230
And eventually, you should become Prosecutor General.

239
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,460
- What? Prosecutor General? 
 - Yes, sir.

240
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,560
The Prosecutor General of the Republic of Korea.

241
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,250
You're crazy.

242
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:45,630
I... would like to help you so you can spread your wings.

243
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:51,330
Goodness. Am I drunk already?

244
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:56,140
Hearing this runt is getting my heart excited.

245
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,360
That's good.

246
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,930
Let me pour you one, sir.

247
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,820
Sir, Deputy Chief Kim is here.

248
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,920
My apologies, sir. I unexpectedly got called into a meeting.

249
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:36,300
Gambling requires time to think. Am I wrong?

250
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,320
I won't deny it.

251
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,150
Okay. Tell me what you're thinking.

252
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:45,760
I'd like to be promoted to chief of the Central District Office.

253
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:53,860
Very interesting.

254
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:58,540
Manager Han, your prediction was on point.

255
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:03,120
The Prosecutor General is on his way here now.

256
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,770
- How about we make it happen in the upcoming reshuffle? 
- Thank you, sir.

257
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:11,900
You can thank me when you're under consideration to be the next prosecutor general.

258
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:16,210
I will do my very best to fulfill your expectations, Sir.

259
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,420
Sure.

260
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,900
Doesn't Kim Seok Hun irk you?

261
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,290
He's a prosecutor, but he's always trying to please the higher-ups.

262
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:28,700
Yes, I do find him irksome.

263
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:34,220
However, I'm in no position to criticize him now.

264
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:38,810
Just so I can return to Seoul, I let Gu Wuk Cheong go, knowing he's a total scumbag.

265
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:41,050
We had no choice.

266
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:46,560
It will take some time, but we will get Gu Wuk Cheong no matter what.

267
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:52,640
For now, let's just think that he was our ticket to Seoul.

268
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,790
Once the train arrives at the destination, the ticket should be tossed.

269
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:02,490
Yes, you're right.

270
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:04,220
Here.

271
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:09,330
By the way, are you sure you're not on Kim Seok Hun's side?

272
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,540
No, sir. I am on your side.

273
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,410
Under Kim Seok Hun, a smooth ride is guaranteed.

274
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:21,710
Why did you choose a clunker like me?

275
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:27,850
I don't want to become a dog that wags its tail in front of those with power.

276
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:30,900
Such a man should never become a prosecutor to begin with.

277
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,020
You’re right.

278
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:36,790
We must bring Kim Seok Hun down

279
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:40,980
But how? He's well-connected with politicians and business moguls.

280
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:44,450
And I bet he has many supporters within the prosecution as well.

281
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:49,880
- Right.  That's why I think we should target Jang Il Hyeon first. 
 - Jang Il Hyun?

282
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:54,540
He's ambitious and clever. On top of that, he's from a good family.

283
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:58,860
At the moment, he's like Kim Seok Hun's henchman within the prosecution.

284
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:03,330
You're right. Maybe we shouldn't go after the head right away.

285
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:06,460
It's probably not a bad idea to cut off the limbs first.

286
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:10,400
All right, then. Let's start with him.

287
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:16,490
I will open the door for you when you take your first step into the prosecutor general's office.

288
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:20,250
- Welcome. 
 - Thank you.

289
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,950
It's been a while since you've been in Seoul, right?

290
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:24,480
Thanks to you, I was able to take in the sights here.

291
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,340
Congratulations on your promotion, sir.

292
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:32,090
My goodness. Thank you. This is my first week here, so I'm still all over the place.

293
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:37,380
That said, go to Team Five and get accustomed to how things are done here.

294
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,810
I'll see how things go and move you to an appropriate position.

295
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:43,150
I'm honored that I can work in Seoul again.

296
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:46,760
- I'll do my best, sir. 
- Sure.

297
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,610
- Let's all work hard. 
- Yes, sir.

298
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,900
 Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office, Prosecutor General - Kim Seok Hoon. 

299
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:59,190
Hey, brother.

300
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:01,810
Nice catch. Welcome to Seoul.

301
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:04,190
Is this my welcome gift? This just won't cut it.

302
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:07,850
Only the best things for you. Check where the beans are from.

303
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:10,430
It was made with top-notch Colombian coffee beans.

304
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:13,370
Top-notch, my foot. It's only 40 percent.

305
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:15,350
Still, they're Colombian beans.

306
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:19,000
Do you have money invested in stocks?

307
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,590
If you have Mirae Electronics shares, sell them.

308
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:24,700
What?

309
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,600
We arrested the president, Jeon Il Bo.

310
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,560
I gave him the gift of a silver bracelet  (handcuffs) .

311
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:33,940
Oh right, I heard about that! As expected it was my seonbae.

312
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:38,540
Supplied with public funds from taxpayers, the president's son bought a car worth 1.3 billion won.

313
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:43,220
His wife used the corporate credit card and spend 3 billion won overseas.

314
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,340
On top of that, the unjust profits

315
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:49,110
from inserting a phony affiliate as a middleman, using the toll method, netted him 14 billion won.

316
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:53,300
I thought he liked the country's money, so I arrested him so he can eat a lot of the country's rice in jail.

317
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,430
But you didn't receive any comment from upstairs?

318
00:23:55,430 --> 00:24:01,310
What do you think? He cursed like a rapper.  Blah,  blah, blah, blah.

319
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:06,650
Well, it was reasonable to incarcerate him, but I am worried about you.

320
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:09,620
Right? Isn't it worrisome?

321
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:14,570
But it's not fun if it's easy. Life has to be fun.  You know my motto.

322
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:17,200
As I expect of your mental state.

323
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,780
 Chief Kim Seok Hun:  To my office. 

324
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,900
Who is it?

325
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,500
Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun.

326
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,010
What does Chief Kim want?

327
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:30,700
I don't know.  He wants me to go to his office.

328
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:35,280
Hey, are you at a level where you can hang out with the chief prosecutor?

329
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,860
Seonbae, I'll see you later.

330
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:39,280
Hey. Let's get together with Gyu Ri later on.

331
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,180
Yes. I'd like that.

332
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,400
Bye bye.

333
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:13,270
I've been thinking a little about you.

334
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:17,720
You handled the Gimsan case neatly and your ability was confirmed.

335
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,450
So I've been considering putting you into an important position,

336
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:24,660
but for the time being it would be better to stay under Jeon Seok Gyu.

337
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,450
I'm fine with that.

338
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:30,030
While you're there, find out the real reason Seok Gyu came to me

339
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:33,510
and what he's thinking.

340
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:38,940
Jeon Seok Gyu is not the kind of person who bows down so easily.

341
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:42,430
You know that I trust you, right?

342
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:43,410
Yes, sir.

343
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:46,910
I'm putting the corruption case with the Gimsan mayor and police chief

344
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:50,530
under your name, not Jeon Seok Gyu.

345
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:53,830
This will look good on the resume of a new prosecutor.

346
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:54,890
Thank you.

347
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:58,520
Oh and, what do you think about Ji Seong Ho?

348
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,570
Is he useful?

349
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:05,080
I don't know much about him yet, but he seems frank and sincere.

350
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,810
All right.

351
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:08,180
You can leave.

352
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,980
Yes, sir.

353
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,630
You don't trust Jeon Seok Gyu but you trust me?

354
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:40,430
 Kim Seok Hun is a meticulous and distrustful person. 

355
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:45,960
 He put his own success ahead of his own child, Han Mi's happiness. 

356
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,420
 But that kind of person trusts me? 

357
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,610
 Electronics 

358
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:12,940
- Seong Ho, let's eat. 
 - Yes.

359
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:15,150
Did you have a good meeting with your colleague?

360
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,370
Yes.

361
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:18,200
Come to lunch with us.

362
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,810
Go on ahead.  I have some things to take care of. I'll catch up with you as soon as I'm done.

363
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:23,660
Okay, come quickly.

364
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,430
Yes.

365
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,860
I'm worried because there are so many good things to eat in Seoul.

366
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:14,000
- How about spicy stewed pollock today? 
 - Trying to clear a hangover?

367
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,890
Oh, I just have spicy soup on my mind.

368
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:18,710
Call Hui Wu.

369
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,390
Chief!

370
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:21,570
Oh you came quickly.

371
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:25,060
What do you think about spicy pollack soup for today's menu?

372
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:30,180
I have something to tell you.

373
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,250
What is this?

374
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,350
- It's a bug detector. 
 - What?

375
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,270
Why do you have this?

376
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:43,820
There is a wiretap in our office.

377
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:47,010
Because I felt something was wrong, I used it.

378
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:49,190
I found a bug in the bookcase in your office.

379
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:50,600
- Are you sure? 
 - Yes.

380
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,850
Who on earth bugged ...

381
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:56,350
Kim Seok Hun?

382
00:28:56,350 --> 00:29:01,600
Yeah, it's certainly possible with a wary person like Kim Seok Hun. He won't trust me easily.

383
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,160
 Once you're marked,  you're marked for life I guess? 

384
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,170
I am truly seething.

385
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:10,990
It's one thing if we were ignorant, but as long as we're aware, this is good for us.

386
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:13,120
Good how?

387
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,000
- Give them a taste of their own medicine. 
 - Their own medicine?

388
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:19,200
I'm opposed.

389
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:24,530
Chunha electronics technology is the best.  Why are you cooperating with Mirae Electronics Semiconductor Division?

390
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:29,420
Mirae Automobile Company has been receiving technology from Mirae Electronics for a long time.

391
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,060
I'm saying just leave it that way.

392
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,890
That was a long time ago.

393
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:36,580
Mirae Automobile Company is now under our Chunha Group.

394
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:41,070
It's no longer a Mirae affiliate, so we should draw a firm boundary.

395
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:44,040
Is there something else that is bothering you?

396
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:48,720
There are a large variety of interests in a business.

397
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,750
Is it because of Jo Tae Seop?

398
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:56,620
The one who gave Mirae Automobiles to you is him.

399
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:02,410
Dad, even if it was customary, I think we should change what needs to be changed.

400
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:07,610
You are the person who taught me I must be cool-headed when it comes to business.

401
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:12,400
What would you do?  So that neither side is offended.

402
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:16,310
I'm not sure.

403
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:21,680
It's a high-tech industry.  So I think I would use confirmed data, reliability,

404
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:26,360
and efficiency to fairly choose a business to partner with.

405
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,840
Then no matter who it is, they can't do anything else but acknowledge it.

406
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,530
That's right.

407
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:35,050
Chunha has the upper hand when it comes to semi-conductors.

408
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:39,810
Yes.  Because Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop, who only thinks of protecting Mirae Electronics,

409
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:44,230
and my brother, who only thinks of tradition, both know when they see a good thing.

410
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:45,630
They can be persuaded.

411
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:50,400
Yes, yes. I should talk to Seong Jun again.

412
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:57,980
Hui Ah, don't just focus on research. Can't you work on the front line now?

413
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:02,000
You saw what happened to the family in Jaeil Group.

414
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,500
Brothers stealing from each other and abandoning each other.

415
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:12,600
In the end, they become enemies. I don't want that with Oppa and Seong Jun.

416
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,860
I changed my nieces' and nephews' diapers.

417
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:19,000
And I fed them baby food.

418
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,600
- I want to see them get married as their aunt. 
 - Hui Ah—

419
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:29,250
I want to spend my life helping you and doing what I want to do.

420
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:31,580
Stubborn girl.

421
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,800
 Ilmiri Gold Braised Chicken   
 - Good work everyone.

422
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,910
Good job.

423
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:43,140
Good job.

424
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,370
Thanks.

425
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:46,470
Thanks for your hard work.

426
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,510
Do you know each other?

427
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:52,950
Yes, she's a friend.

428
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:56,610
So the owners here are your parents? Awesome.

429
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:57,630
What brings you here?

430
00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:01,420
I'm taking over the column of a seonbae who is on maternity leave.

431
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,460
The column introduces restaurants.

432
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:06,190
What an honor. To think my parents' restaurants will be featured.

433
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:09,520
Hey, blogs are raving about how this is a must-eat place.

434
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,810
The truth cannot be hidden.

435
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:14,060
Hui Wu, let the reporter eat before she leaves.

436
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:16,750
She tells me she's so busy she can't even stay to eat.

437
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:19,360
He's right. Have a bite.

438
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:21,050
Should I?

439
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:23,550
Yeon Seok, let's set the table.

440
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,850
Wait a sec.  Nobody move.

441
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:28,900
My son's friend is here, so let's close this place and have all the braised chicken we want.

442
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:32,380
Yes.  Hui Wu hasn't eaten well since he came to Seoul.

443
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:34,380
He's been so busy.

444
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,720
Great.  I invited some others.

445
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,400
What? Is it all right for me to be here?

446
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:42,060
Of course. They might be people you also know.

447
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:46,000
How many braised chickens can a human consume?  Let's challenge the human limit.

448
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,040
Tell them all to come.  Yeon Seok, get six orders.

449
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,420
Hello! I brought the elder with me!

450
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,060
Oh, Elder.

451
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:56,040
Hello. The Real Estate Legend.

452
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,150
Please have a seat.

453
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:00,020
Hello.

454
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:05,010
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

455
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:07,030
Hello.

456
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:16,580
Here. Try this too.

457
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,630
This is my mother's special dish.

458
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:28,280
Nice.

459
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:34,130
It's light and savory.

460
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:36,180
Look at the cheese.

461
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:43,580
Eating this tender meat with the cheese ... this is crazy.

462
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,770
- It's good, right? 
 - Yeah!

463
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,430
Yes, Seonbae.

464
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:55,530
Yes, yes.  I'll hurry and go.

465
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:57,590
What, do you have to leave now?

466
00:33:57,590 --> 00:34:01,850
This really is a must-eat restaurant. I lost track of time eating.

467
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:05,510
I have to go back to work so I'm leaving first.

468
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:08,460
- That's too bad. 
 - Safe trip.

469
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,190
See you next time.

470
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:12,820
Good bye.

471
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:15,420
She looks really familiar.

472
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,590
- The college entrance exam repeaters' academy. 
 - That delinquent?

473
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:21,160
She must have studied hard.

474
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:24,150
I hear her mom sent her to college.

475
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:27,470
Hey Sang Man, just eat your chicken.

476
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:28,310
Hyeong, it's tasty.

477
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:30,500
You must have a skill for raising people.

478
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:34,290
You raised Sang Man and Yeon Seok, and now you've taken care of her too?

479
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:37,900
Oh, no such thing. They all did it all on their own.

480
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:41,780
- Our Hui Wu has a love of people. 
 - Indeed!

481
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,900
Let's toast to Hui Wu's comeback to Seoul.

482
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,400
No, don't do that.

483
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:48,670
Let's do it.

484
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,200
Let's make a good toast.

485
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,190
When I give the signal, everyone shout "Hui Wu" please.

486
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,830
So, all together now!

487
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:56,220
Hui Wu!

488
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:59,340
- Now back again! 
 - Hui Wu!

489
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:28,010
Hey, that's enough!

490
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,540
Your stamina is really good, kid.

491
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,260
Good job!

492
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,900
Let's go!

493
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,920
Thank you.

494
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:56,370
How are your studies going?

495
00:35:56,370 --> 00:36:00,470
It's hard but Hyeongnim Sang Man is teaching me well.

496
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:04,300
- Do you think you can get into college? 
 - I'll try the best I can.

497
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:09,120
Sang Man is your teacher. Protect him from now on.

498
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,600
Okay.

499
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:16,240
Hey. If we fought again, do you think you could win?

500
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,350
Look at that. You aren't answering, huh? Huh?

501
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,810
Fine, overtake me!

502
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,450
- Going to the academy, right? 
 - Yes.

503
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:30,200
Let's go.

504
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,420
 Prosecution Service 

505
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:46,070
- When you have time, look over the unsolved cases.
 - Yes, sir!

506
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:49,160
I was just about to look over some of today's cases.

507
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:53,940
If we are as carefree as we were in Gimsan when something happens... gosh, then it'd be chaotic.

508
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:08,070
Here are the case files.

509
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:11,220
I have a prior engagement so I'll be stepping out for a bit.

510
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,440
- You may leave. 
 - Yes, sir.

511
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:26,360
There aren't any special movements from Jeon Seok Gyu yet.

512
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,650
What does he usually do when he's in his office?

513
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:34,510
Other than reading the newspaper and watching television, he looks at the unsolved case files.

514
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:38,820
There was a time when he was once called a tiger by the rich and gangsters alike.

515
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:42,900
We can't relax just because we have him locked up.

516
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:47,650
Don't you think he had a lot of time to think during his time in Gimsan?

517
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:53,580
He advised me to turn a blind eye, even if I see the authorities commit crimes.

518
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:57,370
He's changed a lot.

519
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:03,750
Fine. Let's keep watch until we are certain.

520
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:05,610
Yes, I understand.

521
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:08,320
Oh, and clear your evening schedule.

522
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,250
- You can hear the rest of the details from Prosecutor Jang Il Hyeon. 
 - Yes.

523
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:26,140
Hello, Seonbaenim!

524
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:30,310
Maybe it's because you came to Seoul, but your complexion has gotten brighter.

525
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:32,770
This is all thanks to you!

526
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:35,340
Punk, trying to flatter me.

527
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,620
You're going to have to be on your toes today.

528
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:41,190
Excuse me? Why?

529
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:45,570
- You haven't met the top-secret club members yet, right? 
 - Right.

530
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:47,970
We have a club meeting today.

531
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:51,640
The director has told me to bring you today,

532
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,510
so think of it as an honor.

533
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:58,610
 I'll finally be able to see the faces of the great club members. 

534
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:00,920
- Yes, it's an honor! Thank you! 
 - Alright.

535
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,900
I'll see you later.

536
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,340
Yes.

537
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:11,590
Now, when the elders come, we'll greet them here.

538
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:15,910
This is the role of the lower-level staff. They are all distinguished people so be on your toes.

539
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:18,970
Yes! I'll keep that in mind.

540
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:40,270
They're coming.

541
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:48,370
 Former and current ministers, members of Congress, the Attorney General, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. 

542
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:50,690
 All the people in high positions are coming together. 

543
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:52,230
Hello!

544
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:53,840
- Good job. 
 - Thank you!

545
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,680
I haven't seen you in a while.

546
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,180
- Keep up the good work. 
 - Yes!

547
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,890
- Keep up the good work. 
 - Thank you!

548
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:02,540
- Welcome. 
 - Yes.

549
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:06,640
- Welcome. 
 - Wecome.

550
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,400
Good work! Do well today!

551
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,990
Yes!

552
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:15,590
- Good work. 
 - Hello!

553
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:18,020
- Welcome.

554
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:32,250
 Thirty minutes have passed. 

555
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:36,440
 But no one is touching their food. 

556
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,670
 Everyone is waiting on one person. 

557
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:44,080
 There is but one person who can keep the nation's most powerful waiting. 

558
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:52,420
- When will that prosecutor be done? 
 - He said that it'll be done in a month.

559
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,500
 Jo Tae Seop. 

560
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,610
Hello!

561
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:05,870
You worked hard.

562
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:09,020
Nice to meet you.

563
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,940
Oh, yes.

564
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:19,670
Please sit. It's not like I'm anyone important.

565
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:22,820
I told you to eat first.

566
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:28,880
Let's eat.

567
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:50,410
 It's a show of power! He's making sure everyone here knows that he's the master. 

568
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:54,490
 So Jo Tae Seop made all the people of power wait for 30 minutes. 

569
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:56,450
Hey, Kim Hui Wu!

570
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:58,380
Come here!

571
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:05,270
Kim Hui Wu.

572
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:07,070
Yes!

573
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:12,220
After you finish your meal, you will meet Representative Jo Tae Seop alone.

574
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:15,540
- Individually?  
 - Yes!

575
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,310
It is a tradition in our club.

576
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:21,570
- The youngest will have a meeting with the head of the club. 
 - Wow!

577
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:25,590
It is such an honor!

578
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:29,200
Hey. She's here. Go on now.

579
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:36,810
- I'll be waiting in the car so take your time. 
 - Yes.

580
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:39,940
Don't get nervous!

581
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:45,010
I'll be back.

582
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:56,030
The representative is waiting. Let's go.

583
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:00,790
It's been a while.

584
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:05,630
It's been a few years, but do you remember me saying that'd I'd keep my promise?

585
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:13,330
Did I make some sort of agreement with you?

586
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,370
That's...

587
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:23,270
Let's just call it homework.

588
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:26,620
You'll come to realize it as time passes.

589
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:29,760
I'll trust you. Let's go.

590
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:44,730
 Representative, Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu has arrived. 

591
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:46,470
Come in.

592
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,540
I am Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu.

593
00:43:54,540 --> 00:44:00,060
I am Jo Tae Seop. We finally get to meet, Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu.

594
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:02,970
It's nice to meet you. Sit over here.

595
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:04,510
Yes.

596
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:17,680
It feels good seeing a new face after a long time.

597
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,530
So, what is your dream?

598
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:25,380
I don't have any plans on looking ahead right now.

599
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:29,310
I want to dedicate myself to the role I have at the moment.

600
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:35,100
Yes, I suppose that's normal for a first-time prosecutor. Expected even.

601
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:39,090
So what do you think should be the relationship

602
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:41,710
between an assemblyman and a prosecutor?

603
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:46,210
Don't try to match it to my standards, and just tell me what you think.

604
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,080
I think it's the same as a master and his subject.

605
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:57,730
Master and subject? So the belief that there must be loyalty between the monarch and subject?

606
00:44:57,730 --> 00:45:00,380
Yes, I think so.

607
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:04,110
It might be a bit awkward to call it a monarch and its subject, but

608
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:08,240
the National Assembly believes in the prosecution and the courts and promotes legislation.

609
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,420
The prosecution should also believe the laws are correct and move forward

610
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:15,580
before the legislation can properly stand.

611
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:20,590
It's only possible if there's trust and loyalty between the two.

612
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:26,150
That's an interesting interpretation.  But I'm curious.

613
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:28,950
Who are the "masters" you're referring to?

614
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,420
That is, wouldn't our prosecutors be the ones to make laws

615
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:35,700
that they can trust and follow?

616
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:39,910
All right.

617
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:47,010
There has to be faith

618
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:51,600
between the National Assembly and the prosecution.

619
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,380
I think the two

620
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:00,120
are one.

621
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:04,950
Don't we have a common goal to make the country better?

622
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:07,610
Yes, I think so.

623
00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:10,130
Just one more question.

624
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:14,730
What was your first thought when you saw today's meeting?

625
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:17,420
With all the people who gathered here today,

626
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:21,420
I thought the foundation for a national governance organization could be established.

627
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:25,710
Yes.  They have all that talent.

628
00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:31,790
That is why I

629
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:34,910
want everyone to become one.

630
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:37,320
And that one power...

631
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:42,000
to come to me.

632
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:50,930
What do you say?

633
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:54,270
After meeting Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop in person.

634
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:56,150
He is a powerful man.

635
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:58,490
Right, he is indeed powerful.

636
00:46:58,490 --> 00:47:02,430
He is also the only man who can change this country.

637
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:04,380
Is that so?

638
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:08,510
Of course. Honestly who else can unify our country?

639
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:12,950
Assemblyman Jo has come up with a plan to bring together

640
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:17,790
and unify this country, which is divided into progressives and conservatives.

641
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:22,540
You also are patriotic, all because you also are under Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop's wings.

642
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:24,360
 Patriotic, my foot. 

643
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:30,430
You can consider our secret club as an organization to make Assemblyman Jo the President

644
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:34,120
You guaranteed your future because you got under the right leadership.

645
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,350
Consider it an honor.

646
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:37,920
Yes, I'm honored. Thank you.

647
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,870
So, to celebrate this,

648
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:43,500
let's have another drink tonight!

649
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:44,440
Let's go!

650
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:45,690
Floor it!

651
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:49,230
My righteous prosecutors.

652
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:53,570
That guy, Kim Hui Wu, I like him.

653
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:57,250
But why do you leave such talent unattended?

654
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:59,220
He is overconfident.

655
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:02,150
- Overconfident? 
- Yes.

656
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:06,710
That's why I ordered him to monitor Jeon Seok Gyu and report back to me.

657
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:12,060
So you're making him follow orders and report to you, so he knows who's boss?

658
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:16,560
Yes. In Gimsan, Jeon Seok Gyu let him do as he pleased.

659
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:23,610
It may have worked out for him in the end but, a dog unleashed might bite its owner.

660
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:26,230
This is Seoul, not Gimsan.

661
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:32,260
Once he understands he's on a leash and wags his tail, I plan on bringing him to my side.

662
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:37,280
I understand. But I'd like to suggest a different approach to you.

663
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,090
If you imprison a horse that can run a thousand miles,

664
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:44,430
it can become an idiot or escape your fence.

665
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:50,560
To make it become a horse able to run a thousand miles is the owner's responsibility.

666
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:53,450
He has already solved the case with Jeon Seok Gyu.

667
00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:56,800
They came together from Seoul. They're comrades.

668
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:02,060
But you would like to turn a comrade into a supervised enemy?

669
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,790
Are you not underestimating Kim Hui Wu too much?

670
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:11,510
Chief Prosecutor Kim, mark my words.

671
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:15,940
The master is not the one holding the leash,

672
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:21,130
but the one who feeds the animal.

673
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:41,610
Sir, are you reading the Gimsan corruption files again?

674
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:44,170
Just in case we missed anything.

675
00:49:44,170 --> 00:49:46,310
That ship has already sailed, sir.

676
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:49,800
You're not seriously trying to arrest Assemblyman Gu Wuk Cheong, are you?

677
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,060
Did I say I'm trying to lock him up now?

678
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:55,280
Anyway, I'm just looking at it since I have some time to spare.

679
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,210
Gu Wuk Cheong is not even in our jurisdiction anymore.

680
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:01,950
Exactly. That was Gimsan. But this is Seoul.

681
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:04,590
We have to look for cases here.

682
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:24,670
 That guy, Kim Hui Wu, I like him. 

683
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:28,780
 But why do you leave such talent unattended? 

684
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:32,320
 The master is not the one holding the leash, 

685
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:37,540
 but the one who feeds the animal. 

686
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:41,740
Come in.

687
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:49,350
I have something to report to you.

688
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:58,550
Jeon Seok Gyu seems to still be interested in Gu Wuk Cheong's case in Gimsan.

689
00:50:58,550 --> 00:51:03,770
He's not seriously investigating yet, but I'll keep checking and reporting to you.

690
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:08,650
 It's as I just heard. 

691
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:11,990
 He knows who his master is. 

692
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:13,640
 Good. 

693
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,380
Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu.

694
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:16,470
Yes, sir.

695
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:21,180
Starting tomorrow, you can report to Prosecutor Jang Il Hyeon in the Anti-Corruption Investigation Unit.

696
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:24,830
Then how will I keep watching Director Jeon Seok Gyu?

697
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:28,370
You can't do surveillance jobs forever.

698
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:30,660
Yes. Understood.

699
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:34,000
Also, there will be a Future Talents Forum.

700
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,260
- Future Talents Forum? 
- Yeah.

701
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:40,270
It is an event where young and talented individuals from all sectors participate.

702
00:51:40,270 --> 00:51:45,730
And Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop personally selected you, so you should go with Il Hyeon.

703
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:49,850
Oh, yes. Thank you for the opportunity.

704
00:51:56,310 --> 00:51:57,690
 Prosecution Service 

705
00:51:57,690 --> 00:52:03,830
Right. Since I'm holding his leash, and even feeding him,

706
00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:06,860
I just have to be a good master now.

707
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:10,150
Nice to meet you all.

708
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:16,220
Welcome to the Future Talents Forum. Here, we present and discover new talent in Korea.

709
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:20,390
All of you are the top elite in your field,

710
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:23,740
and these are the talents who will make our country continue to grow.

711
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:30,800
All of the innovations and changes in the world are thanks to people like you who continue to strive and challenge yourselves.

712
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,670
As creative leaders,

713
00:52:32,670 --> 00:52:36,170
you all inspire and energize your businesses

714
00:52:36,170 --> 00:52:40,900
and will lead Korea in the right direction into the future.

715
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:46,500
We hope you spend valuable time in today's forum. Thank you.

716
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:52,810
 Schön Rosmarin by Fritz Kreisler. 

717
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:06,840
 Hello! 

718
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:15,580
 Everyone is busy managing their contact lists. 

719
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:17,550
Excuse me.

720
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:22,190
Hello. I am Jo Yun Ah.

721
00:53:23,590 --> 00:53:26,780
Oh, nice to meet you. Movie actress, Jo Yun Ah.

722
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:27,780
Do you know who I am?

723
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:31,170
Of course. You're the most popular actress nowadays.

724
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:34,620
I also heard you signed a contract with a Hollywood studio.

725
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:37,700
Oh, yes. I was just lucky.

726
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:39,460
Now that you're right in front of me, you look—

727
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:42,250
You're much prettier in person.

728
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:46,400
I'm a fan of yours and I'm honored to meet you.

729
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,630
Right.

730
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:49,830
Oh my! Sorry for not introducing myself.

731
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:52,340
I am Prosecutor Choi Kang Jin at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

732
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:55,390
And I'm  Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu's senior.

733
00:53:55,390 --> 00:53:57,910
Oh, really?

734
00:53:57,910 --> 00:53:59,630
Nice to meet you.

735
00:53:59,630 --> 00:54:01,420
Nice to make your acquaintance.

736
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:04,420
I enjoyed your movie.

737
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:06,340
Thank you.

738
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:20,620
 Seong Jin Mi? 

739
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:23,940
 Seong Jin Mi! You are under arrest for corruption in college admission, 

740
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:27,440
tax evasion, and embezzlement of the National Foundation for the Arts  University.

741
00:54:29,870 --> 00:54:33,920
 You have the right to remain silent and to hire an attorney. 

742
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:38,550
 Everything you say can be used against you in court. 

743
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:46,480
 I personally arrested her on charges of foundation embezzlement and tax evasion. 

744
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,760
  The president of the National Foundation for the Arts, Seong Jin Mi. 

745
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:53,480
 Your jokes, really. 

746
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:55,110
 There's nothing much to life. 

747
00:54:55,110 --> 00:54:57,590
 It's all thanks to you. 

748
00:55:02,890 --> 00:55:05,140
 One shot, 

749
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:07,050
 two kills. 

750
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:18,900
Hello. You're Ms. Seong Jin Mi, correct?

751
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:22,290
I attended one of your concerts.

752
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:23,980
At my concert?

753
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:26,260
Yes.

754
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:30,650
Was it Haydn's Sonata? Very impressive.

755
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:36,810
To be honest, I didn't really like Haydn until I heard you play it on the piano.

756
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:43,530
But after that day, thanks to you, I started to enjoy Haydn's clear tones.

757
00:55:43,530 --> 00:55:47,380
The people in our country prefer Beethoven or Mozart.

758
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:50,790
They're both considered masters by everyone.

759
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:55,390
You're the first person to talk music instead of business to me.

760
00:55:56,490 --> 00:55:58,600
Oh, really?

761
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:03,420
I especially liked Sonata N.60, it was really upbeat.

762
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:05,800
Thank you.

763
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:10,160
Let me introduce myself. I'm Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

764
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,790
Yes, nice to meet you.

765
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:27,100
I usually thought prosecutors were insensitive to music,

766
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:29,670
but you have a deep knowledge of it.

767
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:33,310
There are plenty of people who are sensitive to music in the legal business.

768
00:56:33,310 --> 00:56:34,950
What a surprise.

769
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:38,040
Here's another. I'll introduce you.

770
00:56:39,310 --> 00:56:41,360
- Seonbaenim?
 - Huh?

771
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:50,070
This is Jang Il Hyeon, chief of the anti-corruption crime investigation unit of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

772
00:56:50,070 --> 00:56:52,860
You are the President of the National Foundation for the Arts, am I right?

773
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:54,010
Yes, I am. How are you?

774
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:55,610
I've always wanted to meet you.

775
00:56:55,610 --> 00:56:57,510
- Seriously?
 - Please, forgive me.

776
00:56:57,510 --> 00:57:03,130
I know it may be rude to say it in our first meeting, but you are my ideal type.

777
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,550
Who would have known I would meet you here?

778
00:57:05,550 --> 00:57:08,430
Wow, this is truly an honor.

779
00:57:08,430 --> 00:57:10,730
Yes, nice to meet you.

780
00:57:10,730 --> 00:57:16,110
Mr. Jang was the person who took me to your concert.

781
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:22,160
You were truly in love with her performance, weren't you?

782
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:25,400
- Thank you.
 - Oh, yes.

783
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:30,620
To me, music is equal to love.

784
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:39,420
You two seem to be getting along. I'll bring you some wine.

785
00:57:44,650 --> 00:57:46,470
It's a new glass. Please have a drink.

786
00:57:46,470 --> 00:57:48,380
Thank you.

787
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:53,700
- Really? 
- Yes.

788
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:55,610
I'm being 100% honest.

789
00:57:55,610 --> 00:57:57,610
What did you think about my concert?

790
00:57:57,610 --> 00:57:59,950
Your hands were very beautiful.

791
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:08,230
I couldn't help it, but I should have paid attention to the music...

792
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:13,110
 Right. Enjoy it while you can. 

793
00:58:13,110 --> 00:58:18,240
 This time, I'll arrest you and her together! 

794
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:24,430
Assemblyman, I have something to report.

795
00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:26,560
Sure.

796
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:29,520
The prosecutors have requested access to Mirae Electronics' bank accounts.

797
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:32,620
Isn't that managed by Bando Bank? Who requested it?

798
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:34,610
Prosecutor Lee Min Su.

799
00:58:34,610 --> 00:58:37,170
If they happen to find out about the bank's illegal corporate loans—

800
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:39,410
I know.

801
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:46,150
Tell the director of Bando Bank to stall for as long as possible.

802
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:49,190
I'll give instructions to the chief prosecutor directly.

803
00:58:49,190 --> 00:58:50,770
Okay.

804
00:58:58,830 --> 00:59:02,850
 Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop 

805
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:09,580
Hello Mr. Assemblyman.

806
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:13,020
Talk about the Mirae Electronics case has made its way to me.

807
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:16,430
 It's because of my negligence. Apologies for the inconvenience. 

808
00:59:16,430 --> 00:59:17,860
Will it be difficult to cover up?

809
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:21,370
I replaced the prosecutor in charge of the case, so it will be taken care of soon.

810
00:59:21,370 --> 00:59:23,120
I understand,

811
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,990
I'll be keeping an eye on this.

812
00:59:24,990 --> 00:59:28,620
Since you've become a prosecutor now, you have to look at the big picture.

813
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:30,990
I'll keep that in mind.

814
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:40,800
 Jang Il Hyeon  

815
00:59:43,430 --> 00:59:46,610
Yes. Yes, I understand.

816
00:59:50,930 --> 00:59:51,970
They want to settle.

817
00:59:51,970 --> 00:59:53,810
Settlement?

818
00:59:53,810 --> 00:59:58,930
Oh? This is Seong Jin Mi's CD.

819
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:02,350
This is her recital album.

820
01:00:02,350 --> 01:00:07,740
The world seems more livable nowadays thanks to you.

821
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:12,630
Hey isn't Director Seong really fine?

822
01:00:12,630 --> 01:00:13,730
Of course. She's the best.

823
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:18,960
At that young age, she gained early admission to college and is the president of a private school foundation.

824
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:22,990
Would marrying her be the same as hitting the jackpot?

825
01:00:22,990 --> 01:00:26,310
Why are you acting so humble? There's nothing wrong with you.

826
01:00:26,310 --> 01:00:29,910
She would be the one hitting the jackpot.

827
01:00:29,910 --> 01:00:32,410
How are you so good at flattery?

828
01:00:32,410 --> 01:00:34,180
I'm not at all.

829
01:00:35,290 --> 01:00:38,410
I'm getting you this far, but you have to succeed quickly.

830
01:00:38,410 --> 01:00:41,770
Okay. I understand.

831
01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:47,790
Kang Jin has been paying a lot of attention to his looks nowadays.

832
01:00:47,790 --> 01:00:51,340
That kid was asking about that actress Jo Yun Ah.

833
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:54,670
Is that the case? That's good.

834
01:00:54,670 --> 01:00:59,220
I'm going to investigate a murder suspect right now. Do you want to go together?

835
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:03,920
It's a high-interest case for the prosecution. It would be good for you to go.

836
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:07,280
Thank you. But what kind of case is it?

837
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:11,720
It's about a medical student who murdered his pregnant girlfriend.

838
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:14,160
Ah, I see. I read about it in the newspaper.

839
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:17,720
I'll be the one doing the work for now.

840
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:20,340
But watch what I do and learn.

841
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:23,020
Okay. Thank you.

842
01:01:32,510 --> 01:01:33,780
Hold on.

843
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:38,250
I have to stop by here. I have to greet them while we're here.

844
01:01:43,510 --> 01:01:44,500
Hello

845
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:47,050
Aren't you going to say hello?

846
01:01:48,220 --> 01:01:49,560
The president is inside, right?

847
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:51,230
Yes.

848
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:54,760
Hold on for a moment. I'll be out shortly.

849
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:56,420
Okay.

850
01:01:59,830 --> 01:02:01,740
Hello.

851
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:07,880
Hello.

852
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:12,780
 Thank you for coming. You're doing so much for the economy of the country, 

853
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:14,980
 so I understand that you must be busy. 

854
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:17,570
  The Jeon Il Bo case was sent here? 

855
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:20,900
 It was definitely Min Su's case before. 

856
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:24,200
Wasn't the Jeon Il Bo case originally given to another department?

857
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:25,660
You're right.

858
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:28,620
That idiot Min Su didn't know his place and crossed the line,

859
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:30,720
so the case was handed over to us.

860
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:33,290
The boss will be personally in charge of this case from today on.

861
01:02:33,290 --> 01:02:36,700
Speaking of which, isn't that guy Lee Min Su really shortsighted?

862
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:40,910
If he drags the president of Mirae Electronics here without thinking about the consequences, what can he expect?

863
01:02:40,910 --> 01:02:43,610
The judge who issued the warrant is an idiot too.

864
01:02:43,610 --> 01:02:46,740
 How does our economy even run? 

865
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:51,520
 It's all due to our magnanimous CEO. 

866
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:54,070
 Now that we're on the topic, what I wanted to talk to you about... 

867
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:56,490
 Hey you rock head! 

868
01:02:56,490 --> 01:02:59,560
 Didn't I tell you that it's pointless to go after someone as big as Jo Tae Seop? 

869
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:01,330
 How many times do I have to say it before you understand? 

870
01:03:01,330 --> 01:03:04,750
 Do you think you've become a star because the media is talking about you? 

871
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:08,480
 What, did you want to act like a prosecutor of justice? 

872
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:11,200
 What will be left for you after you're done playing hero? 

873
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:16,740
 Listen up, Kim Hui Wu. Stop investigating Jo Tae Seop. 

874
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:18,660
 Take it easy. 

875
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:21,610
 This brat should understand how to live in moderation. 

876
01:03:21,610 --> 01:03:24,640
 How long do I have to stay here? 

877
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:26,070
My sincerest apologies.

878
01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:30,260
We will open the doors as soon as the public calms down.

879
01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:33,350
Please think of it as a short break.

880
01:03:33,350 --> 01:03:37,470
We will make sure you aren't uncomfortable during your time here.

881
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:49,730
- You've worked hard. 
 - Hey!

882
01:03:49,730 --> 01:03:55,010
Pay a little more attention to the CEO. Serve him some tea or something.

883
01:03:55,010 --> 01:03:59,200
And by the way, did you prepare the file on the college student murder case?

884
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:00,630
Yes.

885
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:02,070
I was just on my way to give it to you.

886
01:04:02,070 --> 01:04:04,040
Hurry up.

887
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:06,700
This is the suspect file. Take a look.

888
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:09,460
Okay. Thank you.

889
01:04:16,790 --> 01:04:17,990
Aren't you going to tell the truth?

890
01:04:17,990 --> 01:04:21,870
You killed her. And then, you got scared and reported it.

891
01:04:21,870 --> 01:04:23,650
No. It really wasn't me!

892
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:25,420
What do you mean it wasn't you?

893
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:27,600
 Hey! You said the two of you fought. 

894
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:30,630
 He hasn't changed at all.  

895
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:35,250
 He's weak in front of the strong and strong in front of the weak. He's the worst kind of trash. 

896
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:36,420
 Aren't you a psycho? 

897
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:37,670
While we were fighting

898
01:04:37,670 --> 01:04:40,770
 Lee Ju Seok, a medical student at Hankuk University 

899
01:04:40,770 --> 01:04:44,380
 The person who reported the crime and the potential suspect. 

900
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:47,900
 He was dating the victim. 

901
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:51,100
 Where do you think you are, lying like that? Hey, stop crying.  

902
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:55,310
 If they were really fighting outside, there would have been a witness. 

903
01:04:55,310 --> 01:04:58,030
 But there isn't one. 

904
01:04:58,100 --> 01:05:02,100
  Nothing was even captured on the CCTV near the scene. 

905
01:05:02,950 --> 01:05:05,910
  It smells like a sloppy investigation.  

906
01:05:05,910 --> 01:05:08,630
Your fingerprints were found on the murder weapon.

907
01:05:08,630 --> 01:05:15,410
This... I was just holding the knife still after she had been stabbed.

908
01:05:15,410 --> 01:05:18,560
 You are the culprit! 

909
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:22,840
 You can't fool the evidence. If you confess, your sentence might be more lenient 

910
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:28,690
 That's right, a medical student would do that to prevent further bleeding  

911
01:05:29,570 --> 01:05:33,500
 It really wasn't me.  

912
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:36,510
It really wasn't me. Please believe me.

913
01:05:36,510 --> 01:05:38,450
Hey, hurry up and tell the truth.

914
01:05:38,450 --> 01:05:41,320
It's so unfair. It really wasn't me.

915
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:42,150
Hurry up and tell the truth!

916
01:05:42,150 --> 01:05:44,450
It's not fair!

917
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:48,550
This asshole.

918
01:05:48,550 --> 01:05:51,790
Let's see how long you can last.

919
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:58,560
 There's only one piece of evidence. Just a knife with fingerprints on it. 

920
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:02,860
 This isn't enough to prove that Lee Ju Seok is the culprit 

921
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:06,740
 Jang Il Hyeon is too smart not to know that.  

922
01:06:11,630 --> 01:06:14,160
You've worked hard.

923
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:16,170
He's holding up quite a bit.

924
01:06:16,170 --> 01:06:19,970
Of course, it must be frustrating and embarrassing.

925
01:06:19,970 --> 01:06:23,070
Let's go, I need to quench my thirst.

926
01:06:23,070 --> 01:06:24,780
Okay.

927
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:36,020
Should I investigate the people around the suspect one more time?

928
01:06:36,020 --> 01:06:37,290
Investigate?

929
01:06:37,290 --> 01:06:41,150
Hui Wu, this is why you're still an amateur.

930
01:06:41,150 --> 01:06:43,480
Don't you get what's going on?

931
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:47,950
It doesn't matter who really killed her.

932
01:06:47,950 --> 01:06:51,150
Right now, Lee Ju Seok has to be the culprit.

933
01:06:51,150 --> 01:06:56,010
- Excuse me? 
 -  I told you didn't I? The chief prosecutor is interested in this case.

934
01:06:56,010 --> 01:06:57,360
And?

935
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:59,420
Why do you think?

936
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:03,120
He's a really attractive suspect.

937
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:07,440
The son of a snack shop owner who always got an award for good deeds. He's poor, but

938
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:12,520
it only looked like he was kind and smart. In reality, he was a murderer.

939
01:07:13,670 --> 01:07:18,260
Before long, it'll be big in the news.

940
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:21,470
It'll be hot on the internet too.

941
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:24,200
He has no money or support.

942
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:27,040
That's exactly who Lee Ju Seok is.

943
01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:34,400
That bastard Lee Ju Seok is completely screwed.

944
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:45,860
Yes, it's me.

945
01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:51,720
From now on, all anti-corruption and crime investigation departments will be on the Lee Ju Seok case.

946
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:55,350
We will contact all friends and relatives and shake them thoroughly.

947
01:07:55,350 --> 01:07:59,220
Posting and leaving comments on the internet on the victims' relatives' pages,

948
01:07:59,220 --> 01:08:03,630
we will make him into a complete monster in the public eye.

949
01:08:03,630 --> 01:08:05,560
Got it?

950
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:13,390
This will definitely cover up the

951
01:08:13,390 --> 01:08:15,840
Mirae Electronics case.

952
01:08:18,430 --> 01:08:20,180
  So that's what it was.  

953
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:22,170
It's genius.

954
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:29,850
Yes, Jin Mi?

955
01:08:29,850 --> 01:08:32,810
Of course. I missed you too.

956
01:08:32,810 --> 01:08:34,830
Did you eat?

957
01:08:34,830 --> 01:08:38,720
Then we should eat together.

958
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:42,810
♫   Dear, All your things you've done   ♫

959
01:08:42,810 --> 01:08:46,020
♫  We are here to wreck it up  ♫

960
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:48,020
♫  Who knows,   ♫

961
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:53,800
 Jang Il Hyeon, I'll make you into a monster in the public eye soon as well. 

962
01:08:55,460 --> 01:08:59,950
♫  Hiding in black and white  ♫

963
01:08:59,950 --> 01:09:02,950
♫  We are here to find the truth  ♫

964
01:09:02,950 --> 01:09:08,980
♫  Give up, I warn you so  ♫

965
01:09:10,930 --> 01:09:18,110
♫  Who would ever find out who you really are? Hm  ♫

966
01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:26,730
♫  You'll never know that I will throw off your disguise  ♫

967
01:09:26,730 --> 01:09:27,850
♫  Oh let me show you   ♫

968
01:09:27,850 --> 01:09:30,360
 Again My Life 

969
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:31,510
♫  Wait, Till the end  ♫

970
01:09:31,510 --> 01:09:34,920
 I'll catch the culprit myself. 

971
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:36,730
 What will you do next? 

972
01:09:36,730 --> 01:09:39,140
 I'll start by revealing the relationship between those two. 

973
01:09:39,140 --> 01:09:41,420
 A sponsor prosecutor. 

974
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:42,500
 It can't be Kim Hui Ah. 

975
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:45,130
 So you'll reveal what's going on in my family? 

976
01:09:45,130 --> 01:09:47,950
 We need evidence that Lee Ju Seok wasn't there. 

977
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:50,100
 It's going nationwide right now. 

978
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:52,030
 There is a traitor who'll betray the Assemblyman. 

979
01:09:52,030 --> 01:09:55,020
 - An easy game is no fun. 
 - I investigated it. 

980
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:58,620
 Stop what you're doing right now. 

981
01:09:58,620 --> 01:10:06,150


982
01:10:06,150 --> 01:10:08,340
 Again My Life
