 Episode 11 

7
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,940
- Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop came to see him? 
 - Yes.

8
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,160
 Cheonha Hospital 

9
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:57,050
 He needs to rest as much as possible. 

10
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:00,650
 If anything were to cause a shock to his heart... 

11
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,930
 Wishing you a speedy recovery 

12
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:16,270
Vice-Chairman Kim Yong Jun came to see me.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,400
He grew up well. He has good reasoning skills.

14
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,350
He asked me to help him become the chairman in exchange for handing me the outlet.

15
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:30,690
The ability to figure out who he's dealing with,

16
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,460
it's a virtue businessmen need.

17
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,520
So I came to the conclusion

18
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,320
that I can leave Cheonha to Vice-Chairman Kim Yong Joon.

19
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:45,670
Assemblyman Jo, that's my decision.

20
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,430
In time, the successor issue will be—

21
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:51,250
As you get older, your judgment becomes blurred.

22
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,290
I guess that's why you don't realize

23
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:54,680
the time has come for you to step away.

24
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,970
- Assemblyman Jo! 
 - Chairman.

25
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,740
You should step down now.

26
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,230
Cheonha needs to start a new era now.

27
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,260
 Rehabilitation Center 

28
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:13,650
Check and see if Oppa and Seung Jun made contact with Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop.

29
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,570
- Also, find out what the board members have been up to. 
 - Yes.

30
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,030
Jo Tae Seop...

31
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,900
That's right.

32
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,770
Thanks to Cheonha, Korea has made great progress.

33
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,880
I acknowledge that.

34
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:35,020
But we can no longer keep up with the times with your vision.

35
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,830
I guess you don't know.

36
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:43,350
Cheonha will never operate on the opinions of a chairman alone.

37
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:47,880
But it is the sole chairman who makes the decisions.

38
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,940
The general election is around the corner,

39
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:58,330
so why don't you concentrate on that? I'll worry about my company.

40
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:05,170
I think you misunderstand me.

41
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:09,130
I, Jo Tae Seop, think only about this country's future.

42
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,680
You mean your own future.

43
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,400
Not at all. You're mistaken.

44
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,380
Then let me ask.

45
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:22,700
What do you think about Hui Ah as my successor?

46
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,020
You probably don't like that

47
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:32,200
since she would never follow your wishes.

48
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,790
What you want isn't Korea's future.

49
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,500
What you want is a dog that obeys.

50
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:47,670
I thought you wouldn't understand, so I prepared a gift.

51
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:54,510
 Let's move onto the next story. 

52
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:58,000
 Kim Geon Yeong, chairman of Cheonha Group, who had been rumored to be ill, 

53
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,710
  has been hospitalized for 15 days, it has been confirmed. 

54
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:04,110
- I've laid the groundwork. 
 -  According to an official from the Cheonha Group, 

55
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,270
- Chairman. 
 -  he's is critical condition. 

56
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,090
Come down on your own.

57
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:19,580
There's nothing more miserable than being dragged down.

58
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:27,220
Is the gift you prepared... merely this?

59
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,270
I thought you were coming with a fruit basket,

60
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,440
but you came holding a knife.

61
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:39,790
But you should know, too. I also have a knife.

62
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,030
 - Move aside! 
 - You can't go in! 

63
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,100
- They're in the middle of a conversation. 
 - Move aside.

64
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,590
I told you they're having a conversation.

65
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,460
Let her in.

66
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:08,320
It's nice to see you, Miss Hui Ah.

67
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,100
Let's go.

68
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,850
 Chairman Kim's critical condition... 

69
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,020
Dad, are you okay?

70
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,240
Don't worry.

71
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,700
I'm sure he came to see you on purpose.

72
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,860
He must have been the one who leaked it to the media, too.

73
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,890
What did he want this time?

74
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:41,160
You don't need to know.

75
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,390
Everything is up to me to figure out before I go.

76
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,650
 Cheonha Hospital 

77
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,950
- How was the visit? 
 - How is he feeling?

78
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:57,160
What did you talk about?

79
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,680
Please answer a few questions!

80
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,500
Let's go.

81
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,670
Please give us a statement!

82
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:12,090
 We heard that you went to visit Chairman Kim Geon Yeong at the hospital. 

83
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:14,280
- Hello. 
 - Hi. 
 -  What did you talk about? 

84
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,140
 I'm sorry. 

85
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,960
 I can't speak about it. 

86
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,520
 How is Chairman Kim Geon Yeong feeling? 

87
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,450
 As a citizen, 

88
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:29,710
 Chairman Kim Geon Yeong is someone I respect, and I can only wish for his speedy recovery. 

89
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,910
 Chairman Kim is critically ill... 

90
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,450
 That's why Hui Ah... 

91
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:38,810
 A monk cuts his hair when he leaves the world, right? 

92
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,070
 I came to cut my hair, too. 

93
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,270
 Hui Ah has jumped into management. 

94
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:03,050
 It's a different development from my previous life. 

95
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,610
Did you really meet with Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop?

96
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:10,080
Yes, I did. I gave him the outlet, too.

97
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,310
But Dad told you.

98
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,830
To develop the outlet on your own steam.

99
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:18,040
Never to have involvement with the political world.

100
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,320
- It's cooperation, not involvement. 
 - Oppa!

101
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,890
Why? Should I shovel and lay the bricks myself, too?

102
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,700
You don't live alone in this world.

103
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,620
You know how Jo Tae Seop thinks.

104
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,240
He'll put you on a leash.

105
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,380
That's for me to worry about.

106
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,910
And he'll shake up Cheonha Group.

107
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:38,550
I'll worry about that.

108
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:41,700
Kim Hui Ah,

109
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:46,970
stay quietly if you don't want to get kicked out and lose everything you have.

110
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:56,400
I've contacted the board of Cheonha Group

111
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,180
that you'll support Vice-Chairman Kim Yong Jun.

112
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:04,330
Then we'll now begin working on his image.

113
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,050
 An Anonymous Donor Angel 

114
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,610
Okay.

115
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,410
Sir.

116
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,010
What should we do about Jo Yun Ah?

117
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:16,900
Jo Yun Ah...

118
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:24,610
Yes, sir.

119
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,530
Who are you?

120
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,010
What are you?

121
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:58,990
 The actress Jo Yun Ah died in her home last night. 

122
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:04,530
 The late Jo Yun Ah, who appeared like a comet in 2009 and swept the rookie awards at various film festivals, 

123
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:07,480
 had recently signed with a major US agency 

124
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,680
 and was about to enter Hollywood, 

125
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,180
 adding to her fans' sadness. 

126
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:18,520
"Everything has happened because of money.

127
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,130
"I didn't know things would get so big.

128
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,610
"There are no videos.

129
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:25,600
"I apologize to President Choi Su Hyeok and to Vice Chairman Kim Yong Jun.

130
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,660
"I'm sorry.

131
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:30,720
"I take responsibility for everything as I leave."

132
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,030
This is too perfect a suicide note.

133
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,570
Not to mention the cause of death. Overdosing on methamphetamine while drinking!

134
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:41,350
Did she use methamphetamine, too? Wasn't it propofol that she was using?

135
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:44,510
I feel like I've seen this before.

136
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,700
 It's just the right mix of alcohol and methamphetamine. 

137
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,330
Where?

138
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,590
Never mind.

139
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,790
What's with you?

140
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,790
Take a look.

141
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,480
 Actress Jo Yun Ah's "Suicide"
 Leaves a Suicide Note On the Recent Controversy 

142
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:26,440
 Actress Jo Yoon Ah's "Suicide"
 Leaves a Suicide Note On the Recent Controversy 

143
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,370
 ... drinking when it's not enough, will it fill that void? 

144
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,460
Yes, I understand.

145
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,940
That was from Vice-Chairman Kim Yong Jun's office.

146
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,890
With regard to the instructions you gave on Cheonha Distribution,

147
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:40,230
he agreed that there will be no restructuring between labor and management

148
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:44,170
and that he will take the lead in hiring more young people.

149
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,390
He understands quickly.

150
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:51,630
And the site of the outlet was also confirmed and announced as the area you proposed

151
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,830
to Chairman Kim Geon Yeong in the past.

152
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:57,260
It's commendable. Good.

153
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,900
Then I'll have to reciprocate.

154
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,580
I can't let him remain in his father's shadow forever.

155
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,530
Put in a call to Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun.

156
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:07,410
I understand.

157
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,420
Why aren't you answering your calls?

158
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,280
Chief wants to see us.

159
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:49,270
Chairman Kim Geon Yeong of Cheonha Group is in critical condition, and the succession process is marred by expediency.

160
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:52,670
You will become righteous prosecutors from this moment on.

161
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,320
If there's any punk here who received an allowance from Cheonha Group,

162
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:00,720
remove all evidence of it, and if any of you have friends there, forget them.

163
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,720
You will only look at the crime.

164
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,550
Show the world that the law is fair!

165
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,420
- Got it? 
 - Yes, sir!

166
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,920
That's all.

167
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,810
 Special Investigation Team Office 

168
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:24,310
 Special independent Prosecutor Choi Kang Jin 

169
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:29,950
Turn in your cellphones, and don't answer any calls!

170
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:33,670
Track down borrowed-name accounts of former and current employees

171
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:37,700
and shake down every Cheonha Group affiliate who has securities accounts and trades stock.

172
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,660
 Yes, sir! 

173
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,650
- What? The prosecution? 
 - Yes.

174
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:47,980
They're investigating the overall succession process and the three of us, too.

175
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,130
 Chairman Kim Geon Yeon will think 

176
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:59,090
 that the prosecution is gunning for him. 

177
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:00,930
 But... 

178
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:13,300
if you scar a healthy body, it loses its overall value.

179
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,590
You just need to get rid of the one thing that's ruining the balance.

180
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:24,620
Like this.

181
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:29,420
How is it? Doesn't it look good?

182
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,560
Sir.

183
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,090
Mr. Kim Seong Jun?

184
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:40,250
What is it?

185
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,070
I'm Prosecutor Choi Kang Jin from the Central District Office.

186
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:48,880
I'd like to give you a choice. Would you cooperate and come with us quietly?

187
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,520
Or do you want your face all over the news?

188
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,320
- What?
 - Let's go.

189
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,420
- Seong Jun? 
- Yes, sir.

190
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:00,040
It looks like he committed embezzlement.

191
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:05,330
 Kim Geon Yeong will know that Seong Jun's arrest is a warning. 

192
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:09,080
Dad.

193
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:16,590
I'll bring Seong Jun back.

194
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:19,890
 And that the next target is Kim Hui Ah. 

195
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:21,940
I'll take care of everything, so you stay out of this.

196
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:25,850
I told you that I must put an end to this with my own hands.

197
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:27,730
Dad.

198
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:34,610
No, don't cut it too close.

199
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:36,820
Yes, sir.

200
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,480
Good. That's it.

201
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,610
Great. Get ready to greet a guest.

202
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:50,680
Chairman Kim Geon Yeong won't surrender like this.

203
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,650
He'll visit me with a knife in his hand.

204
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,320
Okay.

205
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:06,940
Sir, Chairman Kim Geon Yeong is here.

206
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:17,320
 Again My Life 

207
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,140
What brings you here?

208
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,440
What are you doing?

209
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,900
My son, Seong Jun. Please let him go.

210
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:48,430
Yong Jun, Seong Jun, and Hui Ah.

211
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,830
I do not want my children...

212
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:56,410
to be involved any further in political circles.

213
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:57,860
Chairman Kim.

214
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,970
Please, this is my last wish.

215
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:06,860
I want this relationship to end with me.

216
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:14,960
I'm sorry. I'm afraid I can't grant your wish.

217
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,720
 You'll just serve ten years in jail, no more. 

218
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,190
Chairman Kim!

219
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:44,830
 1993 
 Investigation on Corruption Within Chunha Group 

220
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:49,890
 1993 

221
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,970
 What? This is... 

222
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:58,920
 You'll just serve ten years in jail, no more. 

223
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,860
 The new administration has taken office. 

224
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:04,840
 It's time to round up some chaebol ( conglomerate owner )  to show the public how "righteous" we are. 

225
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,930
 So I'm your target? And you're here to arrest me? 

226
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,410
 We'd be having this conversation in my office if that were the case. 

227
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:16,140
 Why do you think I suggested this lunch meeting? 

228
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:20,230
 I'd like to run for office during the upcoming general election. 

229
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:24,230
 Join hands with me, 

230
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:28,320
 and I'll bury this for you. 

231
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:33,260
 I'm sure we can do a lot together. 

232
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,460
 Thank you, sir. 

233
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,150
I was wrong. It was nothing but an ill-fated decision.

234
00:17:56,150 --> 00:18:00,910
You must know that I don't have many days left to live.

235
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:06,490
We could go to jail together, hand in hand.

236
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:15,600
You see, we've known each other for a long time.

237
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:21,390
It'd be nice to reminisce about the good old days together in jail.

238
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:25,920
This is my last request and threat.

239
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:31,390
Put Seong Jun back where he belongs.

240
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:35,560
And do not contact my children again.

241
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:39,960
I'm sure you get the message.

242
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,030
Let's take care of him. I'll get ready, sir.

243
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:11,440
- It's too risky.
 - When was it not?

244
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,210
We're dealing with Chairman Kim here.

245
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:35,560
Kim Geon Yeong.

246
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,060
 Help! 

247
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,670
 Oppa. Oppa! Oppa! 

248
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:05,490
 Help! Oppa. Oppa. Oppa. 

249
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,290
Oppa.

250
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,860
Do you really think a mere prosecutor can take me down?

251
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:29,020
Unfortunately, this is my job. I'm just following orders. So no hard feelings, please.

252
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:35,300
Looks like this will take a while. Do you want some ox bone soup?

253
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:39,970
Oh, wait. Do rich heirs not eat stuff like that?

254
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,620
We're letting Mr. Kim Seong Jun go.

255
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:08,080
Mr. Kim Seong Jun has been released.

256
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:15,290
Transfer my shares to Hui Ah as quickly as possible so we won't have any problems.

257
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:16,450
Pardon?

258
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:20,430
I want Hui Ah to be my successor.

259
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:25,690
- Tell Yong Jun and Seong Jun to stop by the hospital tomorrow. 
- Yes, sir.

260
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:27,450
You can go.

261
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:43,220
Dad, just focus on your recovery now. I'll take care of everything else.

262
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,490
You don't need to worry about me.

263
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:49,520
I'll stay alive until you've fully transitioned into my position.

264
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:57,110
You'll have Cheonha on your shoulders.

265
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:02,870
I'm sorry, Hui Ah. You wanted to live an ordinary life,

266
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:07,000
but you can't do that because you're my daughter.

267
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:12,690
Expect to get busy. Go home and rest up.

268
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:16,260
Starting tomorrow, you'll come here and work with me.

269
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,860
Okay.

270
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,420
- Get some rest. 
- All right.

271
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,700
- Mr. Park. 
- Yes, sir.

272
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,290
- Spare me a moment. 
- Yes, sir.

273
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,070
It's chrysanthemum tea.

274
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,830
You made it very cleanly.

275
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:12,000
Since I've drunk good tea, tonight

276
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:15,830
it seems I'll sleep soundly.

277
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:45,140
Yes.

278
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:48,950
Yes, I understand.

279
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,790
Excuse me, Assemblyman.

280
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:06,380
You've put in much effort, Chairman.

281
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,500
Now,

282
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,440
now, rest in peace.

283
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,770
 Kim Geon Yeong, chairman of Cheonha Group, Korea's number 1 business group, 

284
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:22,200
 passed away at 73 years of age at Cheonha Hospital this dawn. 

285
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,430
 Continuing the legacy of the late founder, Kim Seong Man... 

286
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:29,780
 It's not yet time for Chairman Kim Geon Young to leave this world. 

287
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:34,370
 Cheonha Electronics' Vice Chairman Kim Yong Jun, Cheonha Group Strategic Management's General Manager Kim Hui Ah, 

288
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:38,120
 Cheonha Products President Kim Seung Jun. 

289
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:41,520
 It's because of me. 

290
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,930
 As I intervened, the future deviated. 

291
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,510
Look at this fancy place.

292
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:58,770
Where is this?

293
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:01,750
The home of Cheonha Group Chairman Kim Geon Yeong.

294
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,760
The home?

295
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:06,620
Wait here a moment.

296
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,760
Yes, go ahead.

297
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:37,170
 Our deepest condolences 

298
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,170
 Republican Party Representative Jo Tae Seop 

299
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:27,000
I will pray that his soul may rest in peace.

300
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,640
Thanks for coming.

301
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:52,270
It's really regrettable what happened with your father.

302
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:56,200
I'm sorry.

303
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,090
Why should you?

304
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,870
It's not something you should apologize for.

305
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,800
I'll help.

306
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,700
- With what?
 - Cheonha Group.

307
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:13,190
Won't it be difficult for you to handle alone?

308
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:16,840
What is that you are saying all of a sudden?

309
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,270
See you soon.

310
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:27,230
And take good care of your body.

311
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,640
Investigate Hui Wu a bit for me.

312
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,620
Who is the person driving, friend, what his parents do, everything, without leaving out anything.

313
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:58,980
Yes.

314
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:15,640
 Chairman Kim Geon Yeong is someone who should have lived several years more. 

315
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,580
 If someone like that died suddenly... 

316
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:21,510
 In this life, there is only one reason. 

317
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:28,330
 Jo Tae Seop. Isn't it that he has 

318
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:31,090
 moved up Chairman Kim Geon Yeong's death? 

319
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:05,850
 Now, he will slowly reveal his greediness about swallowing up Cheonha Group. 

320
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,620
Let's start.

321
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:51,810
Yes, sir. I'll buy more of Cheonha's shares.

322
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:10,210
 But I can't let things proceed as Jo Tae Seop intends. 

323
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:23,090
Chairman Kim Geon Yeong passed away.

324
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,760
Right.

325
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,500
Although someone will be saddened,

326
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,490
someone will think of it as an opportunity.

327
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:33,370
I... think of it as an opportunity.

328
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:38,540
Let's catch him, Kim Seok Hun.

329
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:43,650
As Jang Il Hyeon was caught, Kim Seok Hun was shaken.

330
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:47,610
Also, the special team that set Cheonha Group as the target,

331
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:50,330
it's obvious that it will be disbanded with Chairman Kim Geon Yeong's death.

332
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:53,610
Right, since it'll become a burden for politicians also.

333
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:59,150
Prosecutors' complaints will pile up, and Kim Seok Hun's walls will become precarious.

334
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:04,660
Right now is the best opportunity for us to strike Kim Seok Hun.

335
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:09,960
But there still isn't anything revealed about Kim Seok Hun's personal corruption.

336
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:13,790
JQ Construction.

337
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:17,140
I think you will know it well since you have investigated it all that time.

338
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,730
The corruption that Kim Seok Hun's wife, who is the CEO,

339
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:23,570
and their son JQ Construction's Kim Yeong Seon committed.

340
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:27,910
However, we haven't found corruption that Kim Seok Hun has directly committed.

341
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:32,310
Yes, however, that much source is enough.

342
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:37,040
Since what holds back a powerful person is always

343
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,240
family.

344
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:42,580
And there's what I prepared too.

345
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:45,830
Fine.

346
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:49,650
Let's give it a go.

347
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:07,960
"Chairman Kim Geon Yeong deceased, curtain rises for Cheonha Group Vice Chairman Kim Yong Jun's time"

348
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,790
It's wrong.

349
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:13,370
Vice Chairman Kim Yong Jun's time won't come.

350
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:15,520
What are you saying?

351
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,900
Did you come from the future, Sir?

352
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,600
That's done, and

353
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,070
let me ask a favor.

354
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:27,900
Say it, since whatever favor you ask is okay.

355
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,970
Write an article for me.

356
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:35,010
Something like... "Cheonha Group General Manager Kim Hui Ah leads the way"

357
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:37,000
Hey.

358
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:40,350
Even I know that Kim Hui Ah is your friend.

359
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:43,250
How dare you try to use a reporter of the Republic of Korea for personal matters?

360
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:45,560
Do I look like a trash reporter to you?

361
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:57,580
The person the late Chairman Kim Geon Yeong marked out as his successor is Hui Ah.

362
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:01,890
She's the only one out of the three children who didn't bow to Jo Tae Seop,

363
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:04,510
and her management skills are excellent.

364
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:10,090
The media is only talking about Kim Yong Jun and Kim Seung Jun, right?

365
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:13,580
That's Jo Tae Seop's work.

366
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:17,110
Ah, wait a second. I'm very confused right now.

367
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:19,500
Chairman Kim Geon Yeong's death

368
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:23,610
could become the foundation for increasing Jo Tae Seop's power.

369
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:26,520
I'm going to prevent that by helping Hui Ah.

370
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:33,690
Hey, if I saw you as a trash reporter, I probably wouldn't have made a request like this.

371
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:36,690
I'm not asking this favor of my friend Kim Han Mi

372
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:40,040
but of Reporter Kim Han Mi.

373
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:45,020
I think I just heard some very shocking news.

374
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:49,630
So, you're going to help Kim Hui Ah to stop Jo Tae Seop?

375
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,070
Yeah.

376
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:54,220
Then, asking me to let you meet Representative Hwang was also...

377
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:58,200
Because he's the only politician who didn't bow to Jo Tae Seop.

378
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,130
Hey, do you not know Jo Tae Seop?

379
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:04,220
The most popular with the entire nation, an icon of trust and integrity!

380
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:06,160
It's a charade.

381
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:10,440
And I'm going to take off that mask.

382
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:13,970
If Jo Tae Sup is a dinosaur, then you're just an ant!

383
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:16,820
Isn't an ant a bit much?

384
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,040
Kim Hui Wu!

385
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,450
That's enough.

386
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:24,340
So! The answer to my request?

387
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:28,020
Do you not see me opening my laptop?

388
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,550
Good!

389
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:32,390
Do me this favor!

390
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,890
Did you eat well?

391
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:55,450
Are you spying on me? I just finished dinner and was on my way home.

392
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:58,110
I suddenly thought of you.

393
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:00,940
As if. What is it again, today?

394
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:05,430
As expected, our criminal investigator's good at getting right to the point.

395
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:08,050
I'm already thrilled.

396
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:11,340
Please investigate Bando Bank's corporate loan case.

397
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:14,560
And look into the transaction details of the related companies involved.

398
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,190
 Yes! 

399
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:18,310
Yes, thank you!

400
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:30,870
I will use the money that you have given me.

401
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:34,670
I told you to do whatever you want. Why do you keep asking?

402
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:36,990
It's because we could lose everything.

403
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:40,370
But you could also make it bigger?

404
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:42,170
Yes!

405
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:44,810
 Making how much money is your goal? 

406
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:46,750
 I... 

407
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:51,450
 This. And... 

408
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:53,040
 That! 

409
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:59,270
 And... if I can buy that, over there, it'll be enough. 

410
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:06,950
 So it's Cheonha Electronics, Cheonha Automobiles, Cheonha Construction. 

411
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:09,810
 So you want Cheonha in the palm of your hands. 

412
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:18,070
It's money I gave you to spend. Spend it the way you want.

413
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:22,570
Whether you buy a phone, buy a car, or buy an apartment!

414
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:26,740
Thank you, Elder!

415
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:33,720
- Hyeong, you're back?
 - Yeah.

416
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:38,130
How are you managing the elder's current assets?

417
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:41,150
I'm managing it by investing in stocks and real estate.

418
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:45,590
As for the investments, I'm in the process of increasing the earnings by focusing on the stocks that you picked, and

419
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:47,260
they are on fire.

420
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:51,910
As for real estate, I'm managing

421
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:54,570
auction items such as stores, villas, and apartments that Elder is advising me on.

422
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:56,310
Sell it all.

423
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:58,980
Sell? Everything?

424
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:01,200
Stocks, shops, villas, apartments, everything?

425
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,520
Mm-hm.

426
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:06,040
Turn everything into cash. As soon as possible.

427
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:09,880
Wow. Cut the belly of the goose that lays the golden eggs

428
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:18,640
and take out the golden egg?

429
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,280
Mm-hm.

430
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:22,630
Okay.

431
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:34,480
You've worked hard. You managed to accomplish something big.

432
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,490
Manager Kim,

433
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:40,070
I have set up a position as Minister of Health and Welfare.

434
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:45,160
Prepare for the hearing. I'll tell the leaders of the ruling and opposition parties in advance.

435
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,530
Thank you.

436
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:48,690
See him out.

437
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:51,020
Yes, shall we go?

438
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:54,500
- Manager Han. 
 - Yes?

439
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:59,700
Call Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun. Tell him to stop the investigation of Cheonha Group.

440
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,910
Yes.

441
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:03,650
 Cheonha Group 

442
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:06,220
 Kim Geon Yeong, Chairman of Cheonha Group passed away. Where's the rest of the police investigation? 

443
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:21,000
As expected, the investigation into Cheonha Group has been suspended.

444
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,330
 Come to my office. 

445
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:37,040
Hold off on the investigation that said "Become Just Prosecutors"?

446
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,110
That's what I'm saying. They said to look only at the guilt.

447
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:42,530
They said that they'd let the world know that the law was fair.

448
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:44,320
What is this, I say!

449
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,320
It's not as if we're training mutts!

450
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:56,440
Prosecutors are getting agitated. It's time to toss the bait to Kim Seok Hun.

451
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:01,290
 Prosecution Service 

452
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:12,180
There are many complaints from prosecutors. We even set up a special investigation team to catch chaebols,

453
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:17,590
but we've all become dogs staring at the roof where the hen flew away because of the suspension of the investigation.

454
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:23,500
Chairman Kim Geon Yeong's death is unfortunate, but we should try to put the special investigation team back—

455
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:33,370
How about it if we turned people's attention away?

456
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:35,860
- Attention?
 - Yes.

457
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:39,280
Yes, they are prosecutors whose morale has increased a good bit due to the investigation of Chunha Group.

458
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:44,280
If you throw them a case equivalent to that, they'll be less dissatisfied.

459
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:50,140
Can you make a case similar to the Gimsan Case?

460
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,400
Yes.

461
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,080
What is it? Tell me at once.

462
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:56,480
It's a case involving embezzlement and illegal loans from insolvent banks.

463
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,620
Which bank?

464
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,570
It's Bando Bank.

465
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:05,330
It was merged during the 2008 financial crisis, and the major shareholder is DH Money—

466
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:09,170
No. We can't touch banks recklessly.

467
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:11,800
Don't bring up things that are closely related to national life.

468
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:18,120
However, due to excessive loans to insolvent companies and extended maturity, we have low liquidity.

469
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:21,420
- We have to at least protect people's property— 
 - We still can't do that.

470
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,600
The work prosecutors must do is ensure the country's security, not create confusion.

471
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,960
Find another case.

472
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,160
Yes, I understand.

473
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:35,450
What? You talked about Bando Bank?

474
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:41,000
Hey! Look at his spirit! You knew it'd be disregarded, but you still suggested the case. The reason is?

475
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,780
I wanted to show it to the chief prosecutor.

476
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:46,200
That even prosecutors have a hidden card.

477
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:51,480
Political prosecutor Kim Seok Hun. But in essence, a prosecutor.

478
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,380
His pride and self-esteem as a prosecutor are greater than anyone else's.

479
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,770
That kind of person arrested and released Kim Seung Jun.

480
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:00,510
Following the order of the person in power.

481
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:03,500
His pride must have been hurt.

482
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:09,540
Would you like to do it together?

483
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:12,340
So that Chief Prosecutor Kim will have no choice but to use his hidden card?

484
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:14,230
Sorry.

485
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:20,380
Although I want to do whatever together if it's your work, Bro, but the trial for Mirae Electronics President Jeon Il Bo has been set, finally.

486
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,980
I'll be the one to go to trial.

487
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:24,420
Oh, really?

488
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,990
I guess there's nothing I can do.

489
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:32,580
- I'll cheer you on! 
 - Me too!

490
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:38,560
 Kim Hui Wu Investigation Results 

491
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:40,870
Is this all real?

492
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:42,330
Yes.

493
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:46,170
And what is this person named Park Sang Man?

494
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:49,560
How could there be such a large amount of money in Hui Wu's hands?

495
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:53,690
It seems that Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu has a definite talent for investing.

496
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:58,040
Since college, he's made huge profits in real estate and stocks.

497
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:01,690
There is definitely something...

498
00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:03,490
Miss?

499
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:07,360
- I... 
 - Huh?

500
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,690
It's nothing.

501
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:15,690
As I thought, I'll have to hear it from him directly. Manager Park!

502
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:17,110
Yes.

503
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:46,440
They say Degas was originally a young man who used to study law.

504
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:50,020
But he met Ingres and turned into a painter.

505
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:56,690
This painting... Doesn't it look like someone's stealing glances at something?

506
00:43:56,690 --> 00:44:01,190
It's exactly like someone I know.

507
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:04,510
A person who graduated from law school and became a prosecutor.

508
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:11,450
That person is also snooping around the other world, peeping.

509
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,430
Even though you've been caught, you're not surprised.

510
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:22,510
I don't know. Is it something to be surprised about?

511
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,000
Then, would you be surprised if I said it like this?

512
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,010
Because I'm not the type to be surprised by most things.

513
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:33,260
Park Sang Man

514
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:37,020
After my father passed away,

515
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:41,860
Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu, who turned the assets he managed incognito through Park Sang Man into cash

516
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:46,900
and approached me at an appropriate time.

517
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,690
What could the reason be?

518
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:52,160
Did you investigate me?

519
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,350
Yeah. You said you would help me.

520
00:44:54,350 --> 00:44:58,390
I looked into you to determine whether you were trustworthy.

521
00:44:58,390 --> 00:45:00,890
You know how good Cheonha Group is at getting information, right?

522
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:08,810
So? What do you think?

523
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:11,810
Do I seem trustworthy?

524
00:45:18,370 --> 00:45:20,390
I don't know...

525
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:24,220
If you're friend or foe.

526
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:26,400
Let's go get a cup of tea.

527
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:30,220
Sure.

528
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:34,960
What? You saved up money to catch Jo Tae Seop?

529
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,740
Yeah. Little by little.

530
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:41,280
I also didn't want to see a friend suffer.

531
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:50,680
- It's dangerous. 
 - I know.

532
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:53,810
To Jo Tae Seop, all you are is a prosecutor.

533
00:45:53,810 --> 00:45:56,230
I know that too.

534
00:45:56,230 --> 00:46:00,230
Hui Wu. The money you saved is impressive.

535
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:05,100
But, that amount is pocket change to Cheonha Group.

536
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:06,240
I know that too.

537
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,370
If you know that—

538
00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:10,350
- I said I would help you, didn't I? 
 - With what?

539
00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:21,210
Will Jo Tae Seop just leave Cheonha group alone if the chairman is gone?

540
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:29,650
Jo Tae Seop will order another search and seizure of Cheonha group soon.

541
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:35,400
He'll shake up your family while revealing all of the corruption that Cheonha group thought that they buried.

542
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:39,410
He'll never choose just one method.

543
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:45,110
Finances, prosecution, government, the money and power he needs to kill Cheonha.

544
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:47,630
He has everything he needs to take the group down.

545
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:53,200
Eventually, your family will lose the group.

546
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,890
Thank you for your concern, but

547
00:46:57,890 --> 00:47:02,350
our group is stronger than you think.

548
00:47:02,350 --> 00:47:04,010
We won't get dragged along by Jo Tae Seop.

549
00:47:04,010 --> 00:47:07,120
You can't just rely on official numbers.

550
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:12,130
Your brothers, President Kim Yong Jun and President Kim Seong Jun,

551
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:13,820
do you believe in them?

552
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:20,020
The enemy is Jo Tae Seop. He can do anything.

553
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:24,830
Do you still not get it?

554
00:47:24,830 --> 00:47:27,450
Do I need to give you examples of the groups he's destroyed using inheritance disputes?

555
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:30,420
You're doing a good job making up stories even though we're meeting up for the first time in a long time.

556
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:34,560
Stories are based on reality.

557
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:45,990
I'll help you. You protect Cheonha Group.

558
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:51,410
How?

559
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:53,400
Park Dae Ho.

560
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:58,140
He's the CEO of Bando Bank, the bank that manages Jo Tae Seop's money.

561
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:01,010
How do you...

562
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:03,030
I'm prosecutor, aren't I?

563
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:08,940
I'll catch Park Dae Ho and bring him to you.

564
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:13,520
I'll bring you the 15% of Cheonha group that he owns too.

565
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,800
Do you think that's even possible?

566
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,470
I'll take care of it.

567
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:21,780
In exchange, I have a condition.

568
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:23,590
Condition?

569
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:29,350
When you become the president, cut off all ties with the political world.

570
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:35,250
If not, I'll have to catch you too.

571
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:50,740
Can I really do what Hui Wu said?

572
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:54,010
Are you talking about becoming the head of Cheonha group?

573
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:59,600
That, and cutting ties with politics.

574
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:02,590
It was something my father wasn't able to do either.

575
00:49:02,590 --> 00:49:04,770
It will be difficult.

576
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:07,150
But you have to do it.

577
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:10,270
To protect the company and its employees.

578
00:49:10,270 --> 00:49:12,180
That's true.

579
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:24,250
 The rapid rise of a next generation leader. Kim Hui Ah, Head of the Cheonha Group Management &amp; Strategy Division  

580
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:30,620
Kim Hui Wu, you're really pushing me on.

581
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:35,270
Secretary Park, what's on the schedule today.

582
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:38,900
There is one meeting left with the Jinhyeok Group executives.

583
00:49:42,050 --> 00:49:43,680
 I'll help you 

584
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:48,150
 You protect Cheonha group 

585
00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:59,430
I improved on the marketing strategy based on your suggestions. It has been received well so far.

586
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:01,410
This is it, right?

587
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:14,900
 Foodology 

588
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:23,070
It's particularly popular with young women.

589
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:24,900
That's good.

590
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:28,590
Moving forward, the number of people who pay special attention to their bodies will continue to increase.

591
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:31,310
Dominating the market is important.

592
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:34,240
- You're okay, rigtht? 
 - Excuse me?

593
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:39,400
We've been worried about you since the chairman passed away.

594
00:50:40,510 --> 00:50:41,890
I'm okay.

595
00:50:41,890 --> 00:50:44,700
I'm keeping myself busy by focusing on work.

596
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:46,590
We're on your side.

597
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:50,230
Please overcome it even if it's difficult.

598
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:54,540
The person who stopped Vice Chairman Kim Jong Jun from selling Cheonha Healthcare,

599
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:59,590
I heard it was you.

600
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:03,890
It's a promising business. We can't let it be taken away.

601
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:07,570
- Of course, our chairman thought so too. 
 - Excuse me?

602
00:51:07,570 --> 00:51:13,290
While he was alive, he used to say something to us employees about our stake in Cheonha Group.

603
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:18,000
To throw it to the person protecting the company.

604
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,130
How much does it amount to?

605
00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:21,530
0.5%.

606
00:51:21,530 --> 00:51:28,130
It's not a lot, but don't fights even break out over 0.1% stake?

607
00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:32,970
Thank you! I hadn't even thought about that.

608
00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:36,310
Look closely,

609
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:38,930
subsidiaries like us that want to follow the chairman's will,

610
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:43,010
there will be quite a few.

611
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,760
Yes.

612
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:49,420
Thank you for becoming my strength.

613
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:58,590
Please give me permission to continue my investigation into Cheonha Group.

614
00:51:58,590 --> 00:52:00,720
There is a lot of talk about who will take over.

615
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:04,880
There have been allegations of illegal inheritance and tax evasion in the media

616
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,400
If the Prosecutor's office stays quiet in this situation—

617
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,570
Chairman Kim Geon Yeong passed away.

618
00:52:09,570 --> 00:52:12,760
You might have difficulty if you conduct an unreasonable investigation.

619
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:17,470
Assemblyman. You said it yourself.

620
00:52:17,470 --> 00:52:20,430
That Cheonha needed to be sacrificed to rise to the president's position.

621
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:25,160
But, I didn't even put up a fight and gave up.

622
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:28,820
Seok Hun,

623
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:33,030
you're different.

624
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:36,490
I told you that I know what the size of your bowl is

625
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:39,400
and that I would be the one to fill that bowl for you.

626
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:45,230
It takes time for that bowl to be filled.

627
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:50,380
Come in.

628
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:56,420
Prosecutor Yun Jong Gi from the Eastern District Prosecutor's Office has arrived.

629
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:58,610
Send him in.

630
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:07,400
Assemblyman.

631
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:09,940
Come sit.

632
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:11,560
Okay.

633
00:53:14,170 --> 00:53:16,470
It's been a long time.

634
00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:18,200
Yes.

635
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:25,240
It's been a while since we saw each other too.

636
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:26,640
Yes.

637
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,060
Here, let's have a drink.

638
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:34,360
There's not much time left until the announcement about the prosecutor general, right?

639
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,330
I believe.

640
00:53:38,070 --> 00:53:45,950
No matter who becomes Prosecutor General, I'll work with him for the sake of the country.

641
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,590
Come, let's have a drink.

642
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:05,850
 Prosecution Service 

643
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:13,090
So you'll do it to the end.

644
00:54:14,570 --> 00:54:19,550
How long do you think you'll be able to use me like a dog?

645
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:25,970
Come in.

646
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:33,370
Did you call for me?

647
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:35,110
Kim Hui Wu.

648
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:37,050
Yes?

649
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:39,250
We're prosecutors.

650
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:43,810
Don't think about anything else. Only pay attention to the crime.

651
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:49,430
Let's start an investigation of Bando Bank.

652
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:51,410
 He took the bait!  

653
00:54:51,410 --> 00:54:55,680
Do it in secret. And report all of the results of the investigation to me.

654
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,970
You understand, right?

655
00:54:57,970 --> 00:54:59,260
Yes.

656
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:01,090
You can leave.

657
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:22,730
 The cracks in Jo Tae Seop and Kim Seok Hun's relationship have finally started to show. 

658
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:37,180
Hey, it's me. Let's go to the gym after work.

659
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:46,420
Shouldn't prosecutors go to a nice room to talk?

660
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:49,040
Why do you insist on coming here?

661
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,640
There's no place as safe as this one.

662
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:54,810
And it's cozy. It suits us perfectly.

663
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:56,540
Thank you.

664
00:55:56,540 --> 00:55:57,870
What do you mean, thank you?

665
00:55:57,870 --> 00:56:01,290
I didn't say something to get a thank you.

666
00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:03,790
Then, I'll leave you to have your conversation.

667
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,230
- Sung Ho
 - Yes.

668
00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:14,990
Before we begin, I'll give you the opportunity to get out.

669
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,370
You have a wife and child and—

670
00:56:19,370 --> 00:56:22,960
I don't know what it is, but you have them too, wife and children.

671
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:26,020
Whatever it is, I should do it since I've come following only you.

672
00:56:28,570 --> 00:56:30,430
We're going to catch him. Kim Seok Hun.

673
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:33,080
Yes? Really?

674
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:36,890
Since you've heard this, you can't get out now.

675
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:42,770
I absolutely can't leave. No matter what, it's go!

676
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:47,260
Finally, what we've investigated all that time will finally see the light.

677
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:49,840
- Let's begin.
 - Yes.

678
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:56,910
If we're going to catch Kim Seok Hun, it's necessary first to cut off his backing.

679
00:56:56,910 --> 00:56:58,200
What do you mean his backing?

680
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,120
Jo Tae Seop.

681
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:03,500
Jo Tae Seop?

682
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:06,470
Continue. How do you mean to cut it off?

683
00:57:06,470 --> 00:57:10,180
I'm going to use the Bando Bank card that Kim Seok Hun holds.

684
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:12,130
Bando Bank?

685
00:57:12,130 --> 00:57:16,180
- The one where Park Dae Ho, formerly of organized crime, is the CEO?
 - Yes.

686
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:18,230
We're talking Jo Tae Seop's slush fund too.

687
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:22,020
It's still only a rumor. We haven't confirmed it as fact.

688
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:25,040
So I want to try to fact check.

689
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:28,240
- By using Kim Seok Hun.
 - Yes.

690
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:34,230
If things just turn out properly, fact check is a matter of course and the relationship between the two also gets split.

691
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:35,620
The plan is good.

692
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:40,330
But will Kim Seok Hun indeed take out that card? It'll be hard.

693
00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:44,350
No. He's already pulled it out.

694
00:57:45,870 --> 00:57:50,250
Today, Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun permitted investigation into Bando Bank.

695
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:53,030
- Kim Seok Hun did?
 - Yes.

696
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:57,060
Of course, maintaining secrecy was a condition precedent.

697
00:57:57,730 --> 00:58:01,310
It must not have been an easy decision, so why did he do that?

698
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:03,070
It was that he was dissatisfied

699
00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:09,290
with Jo Tae Seop, who was weighing between him and Yun Jong Gi for the next prosecutor general.

700
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:14,130
Bando Bank will become a secret card for such a Kim Seok Hun.

701
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:18,690
So Bando Bank is the warning Kim Seok Hun sends Jo Tae Seop.

702
00:58:18,690 --> 00:58:23,580
If he isn't elevated to the position of Prosecutor General, he will take this case to the end.

703
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:24,410
That's it.

704
00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:29,460
But, if Jo Tae Seop holds up Kim Seok Hun's hand, it seems like the situation will end anything but seriously.

705
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:31,270
No.

706
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:35,100
Jo Tae Seop won't hold up Kim Seok Hun's hand that easily.

707
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:36,150
Why not?

708
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:39,450
I will give Jo Tae Seop a card to hold too.

709
00:58:39,450 --> 00:58:41,610
A card?

710
00:58:41,610 --> 00:58:43,340
Yes.

711
00:58:50,490 --> 00:58:52,200
Is the hidden card going well?

712
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:55,800
It's too bad. Since I should have been involved, it's really too bad.

713
00:58:55,800 --> 00:59:00,370
You're coming to the Mirae Electronics President Jeon Il Bo's trial at 2 pm tomorrow, right?

714
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:06,950
Starting now, we will begin the trial of Case No. 2017- Gohap 1234,

715
00:59:06,950 --> 00:59:09,670
concerning alleged violations

716
00:59:09,670 --> 00:59:14,310
of the Law on Aggravated Punishment for Certain Economic Crimes, etc.

717
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:17,240
Isn't the evidence that's come out so far telling you?

718
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:22,070
This is the creation of an illegal slush fund and manipulation of stock prices.

719
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:23,250
I object.

720
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:26,980
The prosecution is accusing the defendant with unclear evidence.

721
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:29,530
The prosecutor's indictment is ambiguous.

722
00:59:29,530 --> 00:59:31,330
The source of the slush fund is also certain.

723
00:59:31,330 --> 00:59:34,440
Aren't they the unjust enrichment from manipulating stock prices?

724
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,610
It's merely coincidental that the price of the stock rose.

725
00:59:36,610 --> 00:59:38,710
- He's making an absurd claim. 
- Oh, please.

726
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:41,970
He used inside information to artificially manipulate the market price

727
00:59:41,970 --> 00:59:46,340
so he could set up his secret funds.

728
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:50,650
Pursuing corruption while exercising the right of management and

729
00:59:50,650 --> 00:59:55,580
having seriously twisted the business's rational decision-making and the business's transparency,

730
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:58,760
the defendant Jeon Il Bo has committed a serious crime.

731
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:01,860
In accordance with the Act on the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Economic Crimes,

732
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:05,390
for the violation on the charge of embezzlement, I request ten years

733
01:00:05,390 --> 01:00:08,890
and a fine of 15 billion won (~$15M).

734
01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:15,950
We won't refute anymore.

735
01:00:15,950 --> 01:00:21,290
Only, we earnestly request a wise decision by the judges.

736
01:00:21,290 --> 01:00:25,340
After a moment's recess, we will issue the sentence.

737
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:27,740
We are issuing the sentencing.

738
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:31,350
As the CEO of Mirae Electronics, the defendant Jeon Il Bo

739
01:00:31,350 --> 01:00:36,310
embezzled a huge sum of the company's money and caused damage to the company.

740
01:00:36,310 --> 01:00:39,500
The amount embezzled is in excess of 30 billion won

741
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:43,350
for the company at which he involved the employees in the corruption.

742
01:00:43,350 --> 01:00:48,880
Since the nature of that crime is depraved, it is appropriate that he bear serious punishment.

743
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:53,390
However, as the President of Mirae Electronics, the defendant Jeon Il Bo

744
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:57,610
has made an effort to repay the entirety of the amount of damage the company incurred, and

745
01:00:57,610 --> 01:01:01,110
seeing that he has repaid all of the amount during the trial,

746
01:01:01,110 --> 01:01:07,790
this court sentences the defendant Jeon Ilbo with 2 years and 6 months.

747
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:11,400
Only 2 years and 6 months!

748
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:15,990
However, for four years from the date of this ruling,

749
01:01:15,990 --> 01:01:19,180
the enforcement of the sentence will be suspended.

750
01:01:24,270 --> 01:01:26,340
What?

751
01:01:54,630 --> 01:01:56,300
It was always that way.

752
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:59,760
The cases you thought you had in the bag got buried for people in power.

753
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:02,030
It was the might of the powerful.

754
01:02:03,030 --> 01:02:06,700
The preparation is finished and the planning is perfect, but

755
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:09,840
for that reason, I feel anxious.

756
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:16,160
If the work this time gets buried for power, it'll be hard for everyone to be safe.

757
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:18,290
Me, you too,

758
01:02:18,290 --> 01:02:20,280
Seong Ho too.

759
01:02:23,330 --> 01:02:25,520
Don't worry, you kids!

760
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:29,110
If we fail, I'll go down for everything.

761
01:02:29,110 --> 01:02:31,730
There won't be any such thing.

762
01:02:31,730 --> 01:02:34,900
What do you mean? That's what Nongae would've said.

763
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:35,830
What's this about?

764
01:02:35,830 --> 01:02:41,010
Right? We're in the same boat, so we'll share fate.

765
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:43,730
Is there some serious matter?

766
01:02:43,730 --> 01:02:45,310
No, there isn't.

767
01:02:45,310 --> 01:02:48,790
Our work is always serious, no? Don't pay any attention.

768
01:02:48,790 --> 01:02:50,570
Hui Wu's mom has a lot of worries

769
01:02:50,570 --> 01:02:54,300
that since all you guys meet are bad people, you may get harassed.

770
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:56,720
Father, please do not worry.

771
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:58,170
I will protect them well.

772
01:02:58,170 --> 01:03:02,380
Just hearing you say so feels reassuring. Dear, do you not have something to say at this moment?

773
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:04,440
Director, do you have anything you'd like to eat?

774
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:07,220
Why wouldn't there be? Let's bring the kitchen in its entirety.

775
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:09,790
Let's braise everything and bring them to him.

776
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:13,940
Who will protect whom?

777
01:03:13,940 --> 01:03:19,050
Have you not seen Hui Wu flying about? We'll be fortunate if we don't become a burden.

778
01:03:19,050 --> 01:03:20,760
What do you mean a burden?

779
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:25,080
We each protect each other.

780
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:28,860
Here, let's have a drink.

781
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:50,400
What is the matter?

782
01:03:51,250 --> 01:03:53,140
 I would like to see the Assemblyman. 

783
01:03:53,140 --> 01:03:56,200
The Assemblyman doesn't receive visits other than scheduled appointments.

784
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:59,950
Please convey that it's urgent business concerning Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun.

785
01:03:59,950 --> 01:04:02,220
Then, after you've made an appointment, please return.

786
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:05,990
 Manager Ha, I'm not someone who comes on pointless matters. 

787
01:04:05,990 --> 01:04:09,560
That decision is, of course, the Assemblyman's part.

788
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:14,060
Then, I will ask him.

789
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:24,460
 Please come in. 

790
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:51,900
Finally, I've arrived.

791
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:57,150
 The heart of power in Korea. And the gathering place of trash. 

792
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:27,770
Assemblyman, Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu has arrived.

793
01:05:27,770 --> 01:05:29,790
Let him enter.

794
01:05:55,870 --> 01:05:58,240
Have you been well?

795
01:05:59,550 --> 01:06:01,930
So what is the matter?

796
01:06:03,030 --> 01:06:07,580
I will catch the Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun.

797
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:15,990

807
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:56,360
 It's time for those who were waiting in silence to shine. 

808
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:59,850
 That bastard, Kim Hui Wu, doesn't he seem dangerous? 

809
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:01,980
 Even if I can know the truth— 

810
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:03,750
 You have no right to stop me. 

811
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:09,750
 Should I go along with him, or if not... 

812
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:13,660
 I will shut the mouth of the righteous lawyer.

01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:15,530
♫  what they say  ♫

814
01:07:15,530 --> 01:07:19,340
♫  At the end, They'll know  ♫
