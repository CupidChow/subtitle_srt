 Lee Joon Gi 

3
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:12,780
 Lee Kyung Young

00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,370
 Kim Ji Eun 

5
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:35,320
 Again My Life 

6
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,950
 Help! 

7
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,710
 Oppa... 

8
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,450
 Oppa! Oppa! 

9
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,640
 Please help! 

10
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,590
 Oppa. My oppa is here, too. 

11
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,610
 Go outside! Get out! 

12
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,880
 Come on! 

13
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,590
 Wake up! 

14
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,290
 - Are you okay? 
 - Yes. 

15
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:23,630
 Good. Let's get out of here. 

16
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,800
 Right now. 

17
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,110
 You have changed public opinion about you. 

18
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:40,230
 By your saving these kids, your approval as a candidate shot up. 

19
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:44,500
 I told you not to do anything dangerous! Revealing the  corruption at the orphanage was enough! 

20
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,540
 I would do anything for you, sir. 

21
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,200
 If I had to set myself on fire instead of the orphanage to get the job done, 

22
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,770
 - I would have done it. 
 - But the kids got hurt! 

23
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,460
 That kid even has amnesia due to the shock from the fire! 

24
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,160
 I feel bad for the kids, but I had no other options. 

25
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,900
 Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office 

26
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,530
Take your hands off the case. Turn over the investigation into Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun

27
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,720
to Prosecutor Choi Kang Jin.  And

28
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,380
starting now, you'll be working at the 5th Investigative Division where Prosecutor Ji Seong Ho is.

29
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,920
Sorry, Hui Wu.

30
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,430
You're the one who set the table, but I get to serve the meal.

31
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:37,370
I won't forget to give you credit, so don't feel too bad.

32
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:41,240
- Chief. 
 - You may leave.

33
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,080
Yes, sir.

34
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,770
 5th Investigative Division 
 Prosecutor Ji Seong Ho 
 Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu 

35
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,810
Wow, this is unbelievable.

36
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,180
Do you know what he said to me?

37
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,450
 Seong Ho, can't you resign? 

38
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:12,800
 I've thought long and hard. Being a prosecutor doesn't suit you. 

39
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,480
Exactly what's going on?!

40
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,350
I'm sure he has a plan.

41
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,170
To succeed maybe.

42
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,830
He's decided to fight against authority.

43
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:24,140
That was in the past. He's changed.

44
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:27,540
What did he say to you? Did he tell you to resign, too?

45
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,180
No.

46
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,170
He told me to take my hands off of Kim Seok Hun's case.

47
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:36,380
This is BS. What a load of crap! So?

48
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:40,000
I was given orders, so I have to obey.

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,020
I'm going to take my hands off of the Kim Seok Hun investigation.

50
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:46,110
- In return... 
 - In return?

51
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:49,650
I'm going to get Park Dae Ho.

52
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:55,040
Since I didn't receive orders to stop the investigation into Bando Bank.

53
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,670
The acquisition of JQ Construction is going off without a hitch, right?

54
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,380
Yes.

55
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,570
I heard there's a fly in the ointment. Is there a problem?

56
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:06,260
No, there isn't a problem.

57
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:09,350
I see. Good.

58
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,760
Chairman Park.

59
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,260
You must succeed in the JQ Construction acquisition this time.

60
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,480
When Kim Yeong Il's shares fell into Kim Hui Ah's hands

61
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,010
it was a major setback to Assemblyman Jo's plans.

62
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:30,960
The assemblyman may be able to forgive you with his generous heart, but not me.

63
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:36,820
I won't allow someone who habitually makes mistakes to work with the assemblyman.

64
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:41,320
Of course. Please don't worry. I'll work hard.

65
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,240
No. Do it with desperation.

66
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,180
That way, you can survive.

67
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:52,500
I got all the Cheonha Life Insurance board members together and set the fire. 
   Episode 15 

68
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,990
Cheonha Life Insurance can provide as much as Park Dae Ho wants, right?

69
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:59,500
Of course. There are lots of loan products at an insurance company.

70
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,900
When the bank denies you a loan, the next place you usually go to is

71
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,640
the insurance company.

72
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,570
Since the interest rate is much lower than in the loan industry or the private sector.

73
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:12,350
All we have to do now is steer Park Dae Ho well, who's prevented from borrowing from Bando Bank.

74
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,280
That's right.

75
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:19,130
I leaked information out to the loan industry about  Cheonha Life Insurance expanding its loan division,

76
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,570
so we should hear back soon.

77
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:24,930
You know the loan industry people have a knack for smelling money.

78
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,350
True.

79
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:30,560
When money is urgently needed, you get sensitive to information.

80
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,420
So do you think he'll make a risky move?

81
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,010
Yeah, definitely.

82
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:45,280
I wonder what kind of wind blows someone here

83
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,720
saying he's going to join the powerful and gets rid of his subordinates.

84
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,160
My Yong Ho, I must have let you down a lot. Sorry.

85
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,770
I'll use this opportunity to pay back everything I've owed you.

86
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:00,830
I hear Cheonha Life Insurance is expanding their loan business.

87
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:05,600
You haven't changed one bit. Only coming to see me when you need me.

88
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,030
You and I should scoop up all the money.

89
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,050
With loans, the quickest ones get it all.

90
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,370
It's easier said than done.

91
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,110
Well, how?

92
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,840
The construction you and I used to do.

93
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,440
It's your boys' specialty, after all.

94
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,680
Let me use your hidden card just one more time.

95
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,760
You won't regret it.

96
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,770
I just need three billion won.

97
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:34,360
The rest, Yong Ho... President Park, you can have it all.

98
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,900
It's beneficial for us both. Let me have ten of your boys.

99
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,300
Director.

100
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,180
It's a list of people who applied for loans from Cheonha Life insurance.

101
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,440
I've emailed Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu a copy.

102
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,340
Great job.

103
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:20,380
Hi, Hui Wu. I just emailed you the list.

104
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,730
Yeah, I just saw it.

105
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,310
Thanks.

106
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:37,610
It's me. I just sent you an email. Have you seen it?

107
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:40,500
You want me to identify suspicious people and let you know?

108
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:45,210
That's right. We have too many eyes here, so it's too hard for me to look into.

109
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:48,890
They might have used the same person who took out a loan in the past.

110
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:52,890
Is it possible to get a loan when you have an existing one at Bando Bank?

111
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:56,850
We have circumstantial evidence that Park Dae Ho has manipulated records to clear loans.

112
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:01,850
Please find any person on both lists and get me their personal info.

113
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,670
- By tomorrow. 
 - What?

114
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,710
- By tomorrow? 
 - That's right.

115
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:08,390
- Please do me this favor. 
 - Hold on!

116
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:17,720
 Again My Life 

117
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,220
- Yes, Investigator, sir. 
  - I've combed through the list you gave me. 

118
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:24,290
 There wasn't anyone with a criminal record but some caught my attention. 

119
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:27,120
- Suspicious? 
 - Yes.

120
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,710
There was someone who was reported missing but got a loan.

121
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:31,750
 Really? 

122
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,900
I've emailed you the person's info, so verify it.

123
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:38,800
Good job. I'll treat you to a meal.

124
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,610
I've never seen anyone actually follow through with that promise.

125
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:45,310
No, I promise I will.

126
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,600
Then do it now.

127
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,510
- Investigator-nim 
 - Investigator Oh, sir!

128
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,100
There you go.

129
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,360
Reserved. 
  Reserved 

130
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,470
I wonder who Hui Wu's bringing.

131
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:12,630
I know. I wonder who it is. He's never made this kind of request before.

132
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:17,130
He asked to make the meal especially delicious saying it's someone he's indebted to.

133
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,660
Maybe he's bringing his girlfriend.

134
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,880
Right! Girlfriend.

135
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,380
I shouldn't be standing here like this. I should go put on the yellow shirt we bought at the department store.

136
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,660
I should put on a bow tie, too, and sunglasses.

137
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:32,400
But when he's so busy, when did he have the time to date?

138
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,230
Aigoo, come on.

139
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:36,630
Don't you remember long ago when we were dating?

140
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:41,200
You came to see me after working all night and then went to work after barely any sleep.

141
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,630
That's why I thought living together would be better and got married, but that was the start of a tragedy.

142
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:48,270
What? You're ending up at a weird conclusion.

143
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,050
You said you couldn't live without me back then!

144
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:52,750
You call this living? We have alcohol piled up there to sell,

145
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,820
but I can't even freely drink! I'm living like an animal.

146
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,240
Welcome!

147
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,420
We're here.

148
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:06,030
So... the special person is him?

149
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:10,530
Yes. He's the investigator who helped me out a lot in Gimsan.

150
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:13,740
Hello. I'm Oh Min Guk.

151
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,520
Hello.

152
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,370
I thought he was bringing a girl.

153
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:19,220
Maybe his identity is...

154
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,660
- What? 
 - Never mind.

155
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:26,270
You asked for a special table, but all we have are ordinary ones. Please sit.

156
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,300
Please sit.

157
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,940
But the food is special!

158
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,550
Now.

159
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,670
It's been so long.

160
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,620
About a hundred years!

161
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,150
Did you get transferred to the Central District Prosecutors' Office?

162
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:46,380
Yes. I applied for a transfer and got lucky.

163
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,620
Let's have a drink.

164
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,080
Nice to see you!

165
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:57,510
Oh, but the people you asked me to investigate...

166
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,630
there were lots of suspicious things.

167
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:04,030
The person was reported missing, but soon after got a loan and bought a car.

168
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,950
There's even a record of the person having worked at a service company.

169
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:09,190
What was the name of the company?

170
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:12,250
Big Tiger Outsourcing.

171
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:16,850
Looking into it, it's a company run by Park Dae Ho's informant.

172
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,600
He probably faked his employment in order to get the loan.

173
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,980
That's right. Since you need a job in order to get a loan.

174
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,640
I think we have an angle of sorts.

175
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,250
How should we approach it?

176
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,950
From ground up.

177
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,130
 Jeonghan 3- Gil 47 

178
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,810
Hello?

179
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,040
Anyone home?

180
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,700
Who are you?

181
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,680
I'm a prosecutor.

182
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:05,750
You reported Lee Chang Su missing, right?

183
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,540
Have you found him?!

184
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,800
Have you found my husband?

185
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:24,140
So you're saying your child was born with congenital heart disease,

186
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,270
and you got a loan to pay hospital bills?

187
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,500
Yes.

188
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:32,090
In the end, we owed more than we could pay back.

189
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:36,100
The daily pressure to pay it back was killing me,

190
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,590
but one day, my husband said something strange.

191
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:44,120
Not to worry since he paid off the loan.

192
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,210
How?

193
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:48,620
He said he received an advance from his new job.

194
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,520
Then a week later, he went missing.

195
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,790
He never called you?

196
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,430
No.

197
00:12:55,430 --> 00:13:01,280
I don't even know where he was working. He just disappeared into thin air.

198
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,840
Please find him for me.

199
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:08,150
Our daughter misses her dad so much.

200
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,820
Yes. I'll try to find your husband.

201
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:18,270
I hope you can help.

202
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,450
Yes, Sunbaenim.

203
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,920
 I found Lee Chang Soo. 

204
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:35,020
He's been working as a recruiter for voice phishing at Park Dae Ho's subordinate's studio.

205
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:39,160
 Investigator Oh says he's basically being held captive. 

206
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:44,620
 Big Tiger Outsourcing. 

207
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:50,130
Wouldn't it be best to ask for police cooperation?

208
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:54,750
No. We have to do this one secretly.

209
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,360
It won't be too late to make a request after we get the president and Lee Chang Su out first.

210
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,980
We could get killed secretly, too...

211
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:06,610
If you're that worried, you can stay here.

212
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:10,350
I'm just kidding. I can't miss this.

213
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,620
Seonbaenim?

214
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,390
Good timing. Backup arrived.

215
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:44,280
Are we running a charity?

216
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,570
What's with a 15% commission? Raise it right now!

217
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:51,600
Then the outsourced staff might file a complaint with the Labor Office.

218
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,400
This bastard. Are you a newbie to this business?

219
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,970
Find out their weaknesses. Their weakness.

220
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,420
Who are you?

221
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,110
I came to see Lee Chang Su.

222
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:11,880
Lee Chang Su! Lee Chang Su!

223
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,200
Lee Chang Su!

224
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:17,010
Yeon Seok.

225
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,870
Hey!

226
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,390
Hey, who are you?

227
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,720
Oh, hold on.

228
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,340
Kids, come greet our guests over here.

229
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,560
Oh, really?

230
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:55,250
♫  Hey, you're so cold.  That evil leer  ♫

231
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:59,140
♫  You clearly intend something nasty  ♫

232
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:02,520
♫  Lie lie lie gradually it will come out  ♫

233
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,530
♫  Standing up standing up  ♫

234
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,490
♫  Standing up  ♫

235
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:09,380
♫  What kind of gang came at me?  ♫

236
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,220
♫  Stopped in your tracks  ♫

237
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,050
♫  Stay there and wait just for me  ♫

238
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:19,390
♫  Even if you fool everyone else with that innocent face  ♫

239
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:24,010
♫  You can't get away from me.  ♫

240
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,180
B-Back up...

241
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,880
Just send over everyone who's available for backup.

242
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,710
♫  Bring it on Oh Yeah  ♫

243
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:39,950
Mr. Prosecutor, seeing how you came here instead of going to the Prosecutor's Office,

244
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:44,500
you also must know who is behind me.

245
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:48,540
Yup, I know too well.

246
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,160
Park Dae Ho.

247
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,170
Then let's stop here.

248
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:55,630
If we end it here, I, too, will—

249
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:58,570
Think with that head of yours, punk.

250
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:02,010
If I was planning to stop, would I have caught you?

251
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:06,230
Also, why do you think I brought you here?

252
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:09,000
In the interrogation room, they can record you,

253
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,770
but here, there isn't anything of the kind.

254
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:15,070
It's pleasant.

255
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,810
Now, listen up.

256
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:23,750
How you'll get on the news is

257
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:27,210
a man whose child was suffering from congenital heart disease had to take a loan

258
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:30,980
to pay for her hospital bills, and like garbage you kidnapped him,

259
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,460
confined him, beat him up,

260
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:39,100
and made him take an illegal loan that's impossible to pay off.

261
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:46,350
So, no complaints, right?

262
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:48,800
Since it's 100% fact with no lies.

263
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,070
Sure.

264
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:54,520
Thanks to you, I'll become a righteous prosecutor who arrested an illegal loan shark.

265
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,680
And you

266
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,820
just

267
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,990
will be screwed.

268
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:08,310
Laugh now.

269
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,600
But... I'm curious about something.

270
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,850
When something like this happens,

271
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:22,370
will Park Dae Ho save you?

272
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:27,340
I mean, will your family get off scot-free?

273
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:33,410
You know how netizens are. It's a piece of cake to get their hands on personal info.

274
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:40,060
You have a daughter. If her criminal father appears on the news,

275
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:43,520
will she be able to attend school normally?

276
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,520
Now, you get the situation, right?

277
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:56,350
If you do, talk.

278
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:58,550
List all the crimes Park Dae Ho has committed so far.

279
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:01,410
If I tell you, then what? What will you do to Dae Ho?

280
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:04,050
I'll send him to jail.

281
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:06,250
You can't.

282
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:10,350
The media won't cover it, and no one will listen to you.

283
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:13,440
That's not your problem.

284
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,990
You just worry about your problem, you bastard.

285
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,440
Hey, Mr. Park.

286
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,420
Why are you hesitating?

287
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,900
You're a selfish punk.

288
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,260
When Park Dae Ho had a private loan business,

289
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:49,040
you pocketed a lot of money while acting loyal to his face.

290
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:57,210
The building near Namdaemun. You bought it with that money.

291
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:59,200
Am I wrong?

292
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,640
Park Dae Ho is all stressed because of three million dollars right now.

293
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,690
If he finds out about this siphoning, he'll lose it.

294
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:10,150
It'll be a fun show to watch.

295
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:18,830
You see, I know scumbags like you very well.

296
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:22,060
People like you are always prepared for the worst-case scenario.

297
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:24,260
You already prepared everything

298
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:28,810
to threaten him in case you got caught like this.

299
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,450
Right?

300
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,820
Call Park Dae Ho.

301
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:38,150
You're the only one who knows his burner phone number.

302
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:03,900
Hold on.

303
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:09,370
 Hyeongnim Dae Ho 

304
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,310
- Hyeongnim, it's me.
  - Yes.

305
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:18,280
Chunha Life Insurance has approved the loan application.

306
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,510
I'll send you the approval details.

307
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:24,930
You can send it to my finance director. When will we get the money?

308
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:26,620
Tomorrow.

309
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,880
Okay, good job.

310
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,040
Well done.

311
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:41,050
Thanks for that.

312
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,830
Hui Wu.

313
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,710
Hand him over.

314
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:11,110
Chief.

315
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:13,860
Get out.

316
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,350
You want to do it alone again?

317
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:20,830
I heard everything.

318
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:24,060
Investigator Oh.

319
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,320
I'm sorry, sir.

320
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,960
I told him everything.

321
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,050
 He's been flying solo. 

322
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:40,310
 He'd soar even higher if he had someone helping him by his side. 

323
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:44,690
 I heard you'd been helping Kim Hui Wu. 

324
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:49,640
 - I hope you can help him more easily now that you work here. 
- Thank you, sir. 

325
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:54,680
 He will surely get himself into a dangerous situation. 

326
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:59,190
 I can take the bullet. I don't want anyone else to get hurt. 

327
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,770
I told you to get out.

328
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,580
Sir.

329
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:14,480
Hui Wu. Will you arrest Park Dae Ho and call it quits?

330
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,190
No, right? You still have to take down Jo Tae Seop.

331
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:21,750
If you get what I'm saying, get out.

332
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,910
Hide your claws and back off.

333
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:27,450
I got Park Dae Ho.

334
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,350
Sir, there's breaking news.

335
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,210
 Earlier today, 

336
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:42,510
 the prosecution arrested a group of loan sharks 

337
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:46,010
 who also ran a scam call center disguised as an outsourcing agency. 

338
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:49,180
 They assaulted and harassed debtors who failed to meet 

339
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:53,350
  their payment deadlines and even took out loans 

340
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:56,630
 in their names by using their personal information. 

341
00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:01,320
 The prosecution's investigation into this group of illegal moneylenders 

342
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,250
 has also revealed that Mr. Park, the CEO of B Bank, 

343
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:05,520
 may have had some involvement in the case. 

344
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,690
 The prosecution plans to summon Park in the near future. 

345
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:11,980
Where is Park Dae Ho now?

346
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:15,050
We can't track him down at the moment.

347
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:16,730
What?!

348
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:19,150
What? Are you saying Park Dae Ho is missing?

349
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:21,720
We're checking all the security footage to track him down.

350
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,610
We'll find him soon.

351
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:26,030
We must find him before Jo Tae Seop does.

352
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:30,750
Hey, what's up?

353
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,100
Sir, I think I know where he might be.

354
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,760
I'll text you the address.

355
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,500
I'm on my way there now. Please send backup.

356
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,750
Hey, bastard! I told you not to step in!

357
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:45,210
We have no time. I'm asking for backup.

358
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:53,410
 In my previous life, Park Dae Ho fled to his hiding place right before he was summoned. 

359
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:55,950
 And that was where he was found dead. 

360
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:58,210
 If that's where he is now, 

361
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:02,430
 he will die this time too. 

362
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:04,810
Yes, I undestand.

363
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:10,230
Sir, they've managed to locate Park Dae Ho.

364
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:39,260
Find a dead body that can pass as mine.

365
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:41,530
I have to make it look like I'm dead.

366
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:43,790
I'll pay you more than enough.

367
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:48,000
As for the boat ride to Japan and the hotel, I'll—

368
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:54,510
 Who are you? You scumbag. 

369
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,230
Let go, punk!

370
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:25,520
 I won't allow someone who habitually makes mistakes to work with the assemblyman. 

371
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,690
I can kill you. Where is Park Dae Ho?

372
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:34,890
I don't know, you jerk.

373
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,720
Finish him off.

374
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:05,230
Sir, Chief Prosecutor Jeon Seok Gyu is here.

375
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,450
Release Park Dae Ho.

376
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:08,260
I cannot do that.

377
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,100
The arrest warrant has already been issued.

378
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,690
Are you disobeying my order?

379
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:14,610
His charges have already been made public.

380
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:17,650
If our investigation proves that he's not guilty, we'll let him go.

381
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:21,950
I commend you for acting on your belief and pushing ahead.

382
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:26,960
But in your position, it's more important to be flexible.

383
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,470
Listen carefully.

384
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:32,800
Whether you're after a person or an animal, you must keep an exit open when cornering them

385
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,420
to make sure you can catch them unscathed.

386
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,340
I'll heed your advice, sir.

387
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:45,110
That look on your face tells me that you won't listen to me no matter what I say.

388
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,990
You may leave.

389
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,790
 Then guarantee this for me. 

390
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:06,760
 For the office to have authority over investigations and personnel. 

391
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,340
 I will reconsider then. 

392
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:11,410
Is this why he made such a request?

393
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:15,430
According to Prosecutor Choi Kang Jin, the orders all came from Chief Jeon.

394
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:18,010
So he won't betray his convictions.

395
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:22,660
Prosecutor Ji Seong Ho from Gimsan is in charge of the case.

396
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:25,070
Should it be assigned to someone else?

397
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,480
Tell them to put Kim Hui Wu in charge.

398
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:33,610
Jeon Seok Gyu will concede because he thinks that Kim Hui Wu is loyal to him.

399
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:35,560
This is actually good.

400
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:42,250
This way, we can see whose side Kim Hui Wu will take.

401
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:49,990
Now, Jeon Seok Gyu can't even return to his old post.

402
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:55,170
Manager Han. Tell Prosecutor General Yun Jong Gi to make room for dinner on his schedule.

403
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,690
Yes, sir.

404
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:58,610
 Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office 

405
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,000
Kim Hui Wu speaking.

406
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,020
Park Dae Ho's case. You'll be put in charge of the investigation.

407
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:23,580
 Release him. 

408
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,660
 It's Assemblyman Jo's order. 

409
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:35,480
You prosecutors are quite gentlemanly.

410
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,810
I appreciate that you're guaranteeing my safety like this.

411
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:40,080
A jail sentence is also guaranteed

412
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,790
because you've done a lot of bad things.

413
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,820
Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu, right?

414
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:46,900
Anyway, thank you.

415
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,060
You saved my life.

416
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:52,440
That scumbag yesterday... Wow, he was really something.

417
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:57,440
My bodyguard is tough, but he couldn't even fight back.

418
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,330
He wasn't bad.

419
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,790
I was a skilled fighter when I was young.

420
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:06,870
It takes one to know one, you know?

421
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:14,140
Do you know why I went to such trouble to save you?

422
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:17,190
To keep you alive so you can pay for everything you did.

423
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:20,470
To you, even death is too much of a luxury.

424
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,790
Watch your mouth, you brat.

425
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,830
Clearly, you have no remorse.

426
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:29,350
Hey, do you actually think you can put me in jail?

427
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,660
Okay, fine.

428
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:49,570
Let's not talk about me.

429
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:53,650
What about Assemblyman Jo though?

430
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:59,490
With just one word, he can make you vanish right here without a trace.

431
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:07,200
You see, he ordered me to release you.

432
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,730
I think he wants to see you as soon as possible.

433
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:14,400
So if I release you as per his order,

434
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,160
what do you think will happen?

435
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,400
Prosecutor Kim.

436
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:24,150
Don't worry. I'll buy you some time, a week.

437
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:28,720
Use that time to think hard to figure out a way to survive.

438
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:33,080
If you won't tell me anything...

439
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:40,620
A week from now, you'll have to face the assemblyman.

440
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:50,490
You must be busy settling in. I hope I'm not being a nuisance.

441
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,970
Of course not, sir.

442
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:57,380
You will always be my priority.

443
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:01,940
You're much more enthusiastic now that you're Prosecutor General.

444
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:05,070
This is all thanks to you, sir.

445
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:08,850
I'll get to the point then.

446
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:14,160
Tell me, what do you think about Chief Prosecutor Jeon Seok Gyu?

447
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,970
I'm having doubts about my decision.

448
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:22,760
How about giving him some time before you decide to replace him.

449
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:29,290
It's already been reported to the press. People will talk if I replace him.

450
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:33,220
I used a losing card.

451
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:37,910
He's naturally a wild animal, so he bites his owner as he pleases.

452
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:42,420
I think you should catch your breath.

453
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:45,770
I will make sure the issue doesn't blow up.

454
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:50,810
I'll make it so that it was Park Dae Ho's solo corruption case.

455
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:53,350
- Also... 
 - Also?

456
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:57,910
I will strike Chief Prosecutor Jeon at his Achilles heel.

457
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:04,750
If the staff doesn't obey the Chief Prosecutor, he's nothing but a paper tiger.

458
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:10,490
- Make him nothing but a shell with a title? 
- Yes.

459
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,790
- Manager Han. 
- Yes, sir?

460
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:16,760
Did anything newsworthy happen?

461
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:22,470
There was a self-harm attempt by an assemblyman who had issues with Daehan Party's election nominations.

462
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:25,920
Assemblyman Hwang's leadership is proving to become a problem.

463
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,620
I'll see to it that it makes the news.

464
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:32,160
Prosecutor General Yun, I'm counting on you.

465
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:37,020
Chief Jeon voluntarily resigning would be the best-case scenario.

466
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,700
Yes, sir.

467
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:46,520
Sit down.

468
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:54,450
We've received orders from the Supreme Prosecutors' Office to close Park Dae Ho's case.

469
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:58,630
I'm sure you already knew to a certain extent.

470
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:02,980
And one of you probably received orders from them too.

471
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:05,900
You each have your survival methods, so I won't force you.

472
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:09,190
However, I want you all to know

473
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:13,900
that your junior colleague is fighting a tough battle in order to protect justice.

474
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:16,960
Sir, although I know it's a good cause...

475
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,810
I know.

476
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:24,920
The fear you have of potentially ending your careers by teaming up with a powerless chief prosecutor.

477
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:33,820
There are no disadvantages. You may leave if you don't believe in this cause.

478
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:51,700
Chief Prosecutor, no, Seonbae. You struggled to get this position.

479
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,790
Please bend your will just this once.

480
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:56,980
Chief Prosecutor, there's always next time.

481
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,660
It's all right.

482
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,640
You two may also leave.

483
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:07,510
I'll fight this battle until the very end.

484
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:13,030
- I'm sorry, sir. 
- I'm sorry, sir.

485
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,250
We expected it anyway.

486
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:50,590
Chief Prosecutor. Hang on a little longer,

487
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:53,930
I mean,

488
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:56,720
please hang on until the end.

489
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,130
Do you know what my speciality is?

490
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:03,330
It's to lie low and wait for the right time.

491
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:11,310
Don't worry. I'll be defending this position while you're out fighting crime.

492
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,640
Fight.

493
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,950
And make sure you win.

494
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:21,580
Yes, sir. I promise.

495
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:36,520
Did you hear?  The chief prosecutor was humiliated.

496
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:38,890
Yes.

497
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:44,410
I didn't like hearing it but it's probably worse for you living and eating together.

498
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:47,110
Brother, if you also feel bitter, how about a drink?

499
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:51,060
Did Jo Tae Seop tell you to see how I'm doing?

500
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:55,020
He must like you. He's so curious about your state of being.

501
00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:01,850
Come be my drinking buddy. I don't enjoy drinking alone.

502
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:06,150
Let's go somewhere quiet.

503
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:22,420
When I drink at a place like this, it makes me feel like I've succeeded.

504
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:25,820
Even though, I'm actually a fan of soju.

505
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:32,390
I'm going to release Park Dae Ho.

506
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:35,060
We could face harsh criticism from the public,

507
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:38,960
so after everything's over and done with and the public has forgotten about him.

508
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:43,190
What are you saying? Why Park Dae Ho all of a sudden?

509
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:46,710
When I go to Jo Tae Seop, I can't go empty-handed.

510
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:49,450
You can tell him you heard me say that.

511
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:53,440
I'm tearing up that you're giving me such amazing intel.

512
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:58,420
But,

513
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:02,540
are we actually fighting against each other?

514
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:05,520
No. We don't have time for a fight.

515
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,770
I can't fight because I don't get mad when I see you.

516
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:12,460
Excuse me.

517
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:18,650
Hello? Yes.

518
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:29,500
Oh, you're that person from the restaurant last time, right?

519
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,790
Oh, yes.

520
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:35,210
Thank you for that day. The road you showed me was nice and interesting.

521
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:37,300
Really? That's good.

522
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:42,240
Oh... if perhaps you're alone, can I join you for a moment?

523
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:47,540
Ah, but I am with someone today. Oh, here he is.

524
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,870
Oh, I see. Nice seeing you again.

525
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,310
Likewise.

526
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:57,780
Who's that? Were you flirting?

527
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:00,900
No. She was just asking a question.

528
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:04,390
What a shame. She's totally my style.

529
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:08,580
I just told everything to Office Manager Han.

530
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,130
Yes, thank you.

531
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:15,740
No, I should thank you.

532
00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:32,170
Can I join you? Now I am alone.

533
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,060
I'd like that.

534
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,790
Cheers.

535
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:49,680
Shall we go elsewhere to drink?

536
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,410
Somewhere private?

537
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:10,360
- You are a prosecutor, aren't you? 
 - Yes.

538
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:14,220
Then, do you know a lot of people?

539
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,120
I am not sure.

540
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:20,860
Didn't I tell you what I do?

541
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:24,190
Didn't you say you were in the trade business?

542
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:29,860
When you're doing business, there are times you need connections.

543
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:37,210
So, if you know people like entrepreneurs, politicians...

544
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:38,510
You want me to introduce you to them?

545
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:40,720
If it's not too much to ask.

546
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:48,770
What is our relationship?

547
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:53,310
Flirting? Or...

548
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:55,240
Wrong.

549
00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:01,550
Then... are we dating?

550
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:03,010
Wrong again.

551
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:04,690
Then what?

552
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:12,530
A criminal and a prosecutor.

553
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,370
Lobbyist Jeong Se Yeon. 
 (TN: Lobbyist is person or group of persons who exert pressure in favor of certain interests.) 

554
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:21,640
 Rooftop of Prosecutor's Office. 

555
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:23,810
 Jeong Se Yeon dead at hotel 

556
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:30,340
 Lobbyist Jeong Se Yeon is dead? It makes no sense. 

557
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:32,840
 Jeong Se Yeon was not the type of woman to commit suicide. 

558
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,840
 Especially, the day before the prosecution investigation. 

559
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,580
 I just needed a little more time!  

560
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:41,830
 Then I could have jailed that devil Jo Tae Seop. 

561
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:59,850
 That's the way Gu Seung Hyeok was charging toward Jo Tae Seop without hesitation. 

562
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:07,710
 - What did you say? 
- Check the news right now.  

563
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:09,350
 Okay. 

564
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:14,270
 The driver who died today in the traffic accident in Cheonghyeon-dong, Haero-gu, 

565
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:17,780
 was revealed to be Prosecutor Gu Seung Hyeok of the Central District Prosecutors' Office. 

566
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:23,510
 The police revealed that Gu's blood-alcohol level was 0.13 percent at the time of the accident 

567
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:28,750
 and are investigating the possibility that he was drunk and drowsy. 

568
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,170
 Jo Tae Seop. 

569
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:53,930
 That's how Gu Seung Hyeok died. 

570
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:03,480
If I do as you ask, I'll become a criminal just like you,

571
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:07,350
as someone who plays a decisive role in your lobbying activities.

572
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:12,250
And that would become my leash, wouldn't it?

573
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:31,070
Illegal activities to sell weapons.

574
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:35,350
I think it's sufficient to send you to prison.

575
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:38,550
 Jeong Se Yeon Profile 

576
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:52,340
Tell me. Did Jo Tae Seop order you to do it?  To approach me?

577
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:57,340
But, too bad. I don't want to sit at Jo Tae Seop's game table.

578
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:03,450
I'm going to start a new game. Make a choice. Which table will you sit at?

579
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:06,360
If you sit at the one I set,

580
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,540
there will be no harm to you.

581
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,770
But if you sit at the one Jo Tae Seop set,

582
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:24,030
that seat will be prison.

583
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:39,060
Go tell Jo Tae Seop you succeeded.

584
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:42,860
That Kim Hui Wu fell for it.

585
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:47,340
And sell the weapons you want. Whether a helicopter or a bullet,

586
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:51,970
I'll make up the evidence you need to show him.

587
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:59,170
There. The table's been set.

588
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:01,730
It's time for you to make your choice.

589
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:02,940
Is that a threat?

590
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:04,210
Choice.

591
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:07,180
Then, let me threaten you.

592
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:12,490
If I go straight to Jo Tae Seop and tell him everything you just said,

593
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:14,440
what will happen?

594
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:20,510
My illegal activities?

595
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:25,020
I think Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop will block everything.

596
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:31,830
Try it. Will Jo Tae Seop block them for you?

597
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:38,400
You seem to misunderstand. To Jo Tae Seop, you're just something to use.

598
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:45,040
Oh, that's not it. When you're no longer useful, you'll get discarded.

599
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,510
Like a disposable.

600
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:48,920
- Mr. Kim Hui Wu!
 - Ms. Jeong Se Yeon.

601
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:52,510
I know what it is that you're really trying to sell.

602
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:56,500
Military helicopter? That's a smoke screen.

603
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:01,110
The real object is a new non-nuclear EMP bullet that converts electronic equipment into a black hole.

604
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:03,640
Who are you?

605
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:09,710
But... you have no intention of making a deal with Jo Tae Seop. Why?

606
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:12,490
Because he charges a very high commission.

607
00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:17,220
However, if you sell the weapon without Jo Tae Seop's knowledge,

608
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:20,950
you will end up dying.

609
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:38,220
The domestic arms dealer you contacted without Jo Tae Seop knowing, Kwon Chang Gyu.

610
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:46,270
He also contacted Jo Tae Seop.

611
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:52,290
Don't trust this person. He will sell your name to live.

612
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:55,830
How refreshing.

613
00:46:55,830 --> 00:47:00,970
I've met people who make deals with money, but you're the first person to make a deal with my life.

614
00:47:00,970 --> 00:47:06,110
You have only one life, and you also get to make a choice only once.

615
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:08,360
Looks like it.

616
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:13,240
And you won't lose anything

617
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,310
by helping me.

618
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:20,510
You give me the information I need, sell your weapons,

619
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:25,640
and you can leave.

620
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:34,730
What do you say?  I think it's quite a good deal.

621
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:42,010
Fine. I have one condition.

622
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:45,170
Please proceed after I leave Korea.

623
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:47,230
Deal.

624
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:07,020
There.  It's the leash for Kim Hui Wu that you want.

625
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:09,550
It's a recording of Kim Hui Wu, in order to win my heart,

626
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:13,270
giving me details of the corruption investigation and

627
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:15,610
giving me contact information to use

628
00:48:15,610 --> 00:48:21,610
of the Minister of Defense, generals, and relevant politicians.

629
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:25,380
I told him to give it to me the day I leave for the US.

630
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:29,910
Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu did?

631
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:33,130
Did you think he would be different?

632
00:48:33,130 --> 00:48:38,490
He promised to cooperate entirely in what I do for the rest of our relationship,

633
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:41,260
with confidentiality, surely.

634
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:43,900
You'll see when you check the file.

635
00:48:46,070 --> 00:48:47,770
Okay.

636
00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:51,520
So now, let's talk business.

637
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,990
We should.

638
00:48:52,990 --> 00:48:57,170
If it is successful, I will give you a 5% rebate.

639
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:02,390
You are too greedy.

640
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:05,070
I know this business is worth 1.5 trillion won.

641
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:08,080
You will take over 20% of it for yourself.

642
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:10,750
5% of that's just 15 billion won?

643
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:13,810
I'm offering you the industry average.

644
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:17,040
Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop did not

645
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,670
introduce you to the Minister of Defense

646
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:21,160
because of some pocket change.

647
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,440
Ten percent.

648
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,070
Thirty percent.

649
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:27,960
Ninety billion. No deal for less than that.

650
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,400
Do you want this to be a one-time thing?

651
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:37,530
I met with Jeong Se Yeon.

652
00:49:37,530 --> 00:49:39,580
It's Kim Hui Wu's leash.

653
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:42,370
I confirmed it.

654
00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:45,540
It's nice to be young.

655
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:52,700
Assemblyman, there is something you need to see.

656
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:57,170
Park Sang Man, CEO of PSM Investment, became the new CEO of JQ Construction.

657
00:49:57,170 --> 00:49:59,210
Park Sang Man?

658
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:03,000
 An unknown young businessman acquires JK Construction 
 PSM Investments: 'We'll focus on a new JQ Construction." 

659
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:05,600
Park Sang Man, right?

660
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:13,680
If you stop, no one will get hurt.

661
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,610
You're the one who made Sang Man the CEO of JQ Construction, right?

662
00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:18,240
I only pulled the trigger.

663
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,400
It's gonna be a great show.

664
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,050
Yes.

665
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:25,950
The whole country will be shaken up.

666
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:28,160
Don't get hurt.

667
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,140
Yes, tell me.

668
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:46,550
Jo Tae Seop is digging into Park Sang Man.

669
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:51,250
The new CEO of JQ Construction is the same person as the owner of Kim Young Il's shares.

670
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:54,750
Jo Tae Seop can only be curious, so...

671
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:56,180
 Be careful. 

672
00:50:56,180 --> 00:51:00,150
We'll keep our mouths shut but... our opponent is Jo Tae Seop.

673
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:04,440
Ah, push it.

674
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,350
Oh, you're here?

675
00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:07,160
Park Sang Man,

676
00:51:10,330 --> 00:51:11,940
Jo Tae Seop.

677
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:14,380
Jo Tae Seop may try to contact you.

678
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:17,020
Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop?

679
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:19,050
Yeah.

680
00:51:19,050 --> 00:51:23,860
Don't take any calls from him. And never meet him even if he asks to.

681
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:26,140
If possible, don't go outside.

682
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:30,760
And if you do go out, make sure Yeon Seok is with you. Understand?

683
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,530
What's going on? You're scaring me.

684
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:35,360
Do as I ask.

685
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:45,870
Manager Han.

686
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:47,410
Yes, sir.

687
00:51:47,410 --> 00:51:50,960
- Contact Park Sang Man.
 - Yes, Assemblyman.

688
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:01,760
Hello, this is Park Sang Man.

689
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:05,800
Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop would like to meet you, CEO Park.

690
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:12,170
If he asks one to come, is it mandatory? We are in a democracy.

691
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:14,850
The decision is yours to make, however

692
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:19,350
we don't know what will happen to you if you reject.

693
00:52:19,350 --> 00:52:22,270
I'll put you down for 7 pm then.

694
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:28,770
What do you think he'll do?

695
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:33,590
Will Park Sang Man accept my drink?

696
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:37,380
He'd better.

697
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,970
Are you really going? It seems dangerous.

698
00:52:41,970 --> 00:52:46,320
Of course, it is dangerous. That's why I'm going by myself.

699
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:50,210
So, don't tell Hui Wu.

700
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:01,340
 Hui Wu 

701
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:03,630
I didn't call him.

702
00:53:03,630 --> 00:53:05,580
I hate you.

703
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:10,670
Hello, Hyeong.

704
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:11,750
Don't go.

705
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:14,080
This is my issue.

706
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:17,140
I am the CEO of JQ Constructions.

707
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:19,170
Don't go!

708
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:22,580
Hyeong.

709
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:39,400
A guest has arrived.

710
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,410
Send him in.

711
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:05,170
What's the meaning of this?

712
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:07,380
Why do you ask when you already know?

713
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:12,060
The one who instructed Park Sang Man and planned everything is me.

714
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:17,460
So... don't go after an innocent man,

715
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:18,980
but talk to me instead.

716
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:21,040
Do you understand what you're saying?

717
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,800
A declaration of war.

718
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:29,340
I'll punish you for all the crimes you've committed.

719
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:31,830
Crimes? Punishment?

720
00:54:31,830 --> 00:54:33,270
Yes.

721
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:37,240
I don't know what you misunderstood, but nothing I do

722
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:40,150
is out of my own greed.

723
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:43,240
- It is for all the nation... 
- Ah!

724
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:47,120
Stop this "for the nation's sake" speech.

725
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:49,290
I'll give you a chance.

726
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:55,090
I am a person who looks at one's potential besides their past mistakes.

727
00:54:55,090 --> 00:54:59,360
Get up and kneel. Beg for forgiveness.

728
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:08,860
And if I do that, will you forgive me entirely?

729
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:29,360
I am sorry.

730
00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:34,290
But, it's too bad.

731
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:40,030
I tend to be petty, so even if you get up, kneel and beg for forgiveness,

732
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:42,550
I'm not willing to let this go.

733
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,910
Let's not waste our energy.

734
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:48,630
Let me get straight to the point.

735
00:55:49,810 --> 00:55:56,410
I am going to arrest you.

736
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:03,180
Do you have the ability to do that?

737
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:08,800
Let us see about that.

738
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:12,480
What a waste. It's really a waste.

739
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:17,480
Well, since you said not to waste our energy, it seems difficult to convince you anymore.

740
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:19,020
How should I do it?

741
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:20,860
Should I get you fired,

742
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:25,170
or should I set up a nice branch office in the middle of a desert island?

743
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:29,720
I also have a suggestion.

744
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:34,580
Which prison should I send you to? Do you have any private jail you'd prefer?

745
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:39,800
You see, how powerful people go to prison and live like kings,

746
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,020
I'd rather not see it because it's disgusting.

747
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:46,260
Therefore, I'll make it so that you

748
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:50,360
share the same cell with other prisoners.

749
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:52,500
You're good with that, right?

750
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,590
You are a great politician.

751
00:56:54,590 --> 00:56:58,380
So you can be the leader of the cell.

752
00:57:03,310 --> 00:57:05,380
Look here.

753
00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:10,580
I'm very curious as to why you're doing this to me.

754
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:16,020
Considering your actions, it seems like you hold some kind of grudge.

755
00:57:18,970 --> 00:57:20,810
I do.

756
00:57:20,810 --> 00:57:26,280
However... even if I told you, you wouldn't understand.

757
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:32,160
I am saying this to you purely as a prosecutor to a criminal.

758
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:35,080
You shouldn't be out here.

759
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:38,430
The prison suits you better.

760
00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:43,030
I like it.

761
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:48,160
So now I am very curious...

762
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:51,580
on how this will end.

763
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:57,950
If you're finished, you can go.

764
00:58:02,010 --> 00:58:03,740
Okay.

765
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,640
Let me tell you one thing.

766
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:18,390
Going after the weakest spot of your opponent is how politicians fight.

767
00:58:19,210 --> 00:58:21,750
If you cared about Park Sang Man,

768
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:27,750
you shouldn't have come here.

769
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:40,050
 The phone number dialed is unavailable... 

770
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:46,750
Where are you?

771
00:58:46,750 --> 00:58:47,760
In the office.

772
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:48,580
And Sang Man?

773
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:51,670
He went to buy some food at the restaurant because he was hungry.

774
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:53,780
Check on him right now.

775
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:59,760
I want just one thing from you. To teach Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu

776
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,740
how it feels to be betrayed by a trusted friend.

777
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:06,190
Just expose Kim Hui Wu.

778
00:59:06,190 --> 00:59:08,180
If there is nothing, we can make something up.

779
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:11,750
Truth is not something to be found but created.

780
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:16,080
I promise you.

781
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:20,980
You can have as much money and even more power as you want.

782
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,910
I don't think it's a difficult choice.

783
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:25,750
Is that not right?

784
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:30,650
Hey. Braised chicken doesn't taste good if it's cold.

785
00:59:44,510 --> 00:59:46,800
Hold on! Please!

786
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,620
Please, no! Ah!

787
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:55,980
If you can't betray Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu,

788
00:59:55,980 --> 01:00:00,570
then I can use you to break his heart.

789
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:02,680
Choose.

790
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:05,650
Is it life or death?

791
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:15,780
You must live.

792
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:20,520
Only disobedient children make their parents bury them first.

793
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:22,010
Will you give me money?

794
01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:23,790
You can become a chaebol (heir to a conglomerate).

795
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:27,890
You just need to say one thing about Kim Hui Wu.

796
01:00:28,770 --> 01:00:32,410
True. There is no one who knows him

797
01:00:32,410 --> 01:00:34,830
better than I do.

798
01:00:36,130 --> 01:00:38,950
Keep your promise.

799
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:40,900
Making me a  chaebol. 

800
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,630
Let me ask you one thing.

801
01:00:57,790 --> 01:01:03,650
Can I assume that this promise is coming from Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop?

802
01:01:05,190 --> 01:01:09,340
I need to know who's at the top to do my work. Don't you agree?

803
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:12,740
Am I right? Is it Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop?

804
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:21,060
What's the matter?

805
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:22,330
What? What are you doing?

806
01:01:22,330 --> 01:01:24,420
What? Hey! No!

807
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:26,170
Can't I ask a question? Hold on! No!

808
01:01:26,170 --> 01:01:27,730
Hold on!

809
01:01:27,730 --> 01:01:28,710
Hey, wait a moment!

810
01:01:28,710 --> 01:01:30,200
Hey!

811
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:40,020
You caught me.

812
01:01:40,990 --> 01:01:42,900
Forget it.

813
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:45,850
I just...

814
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:50,950
want to remain Hui Wu's friend.

815
01:02:10,630 --> 01:02:13,430
 Operating Center 

816
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:39,700
How did it go?

817
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:57,900
I can't promise that the patient

818
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:00,370
will regain consciousness.

819
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:54,570
Jo Tae Seop.

820
01:03:54,570 --> 01:03:56,340
 Kim Hui Wu. 

821
01:03:58,950 --> 01:04:01,130
It's been a while since I met a fun match.

822
01:04:01,130 --> 01:04:06,450
Sir. I think you are overestimating him.

823
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:09,460
Do you think I fear anyone?

824
01:04:09,460 --> 01:04:13,550
Hwang Jin Yong? Or the next President?

825
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:18,060
No. People in their old age don't scare me.

826
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:21,250
The older they get, the more they have to protect

827
01:04:21,250 --> 01:04:23,580
and the more they think about saving face.

828
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:25,940
But it's not the same with youngsters.

829
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:28,680
They have no need to save face,

830
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:31,110
be afraid, or protect anything.

831
01:04:31,110 --> 01:04:35,980
But Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu can't be a match for you.

832
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:38,730
And you sent him a warning through Park Sang Man.

833
01:04:38,730 --> 01:04:42,680
You think he will see it as a warning? No.

834
01:04:44,550 --> 01:04:47,490
He will challenge me

835
01:04:47,490 --> 01:04:49,940
until his last breath.

836
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:54,090
But he will regret it soon.

837
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:56,610
And when the morning comes, he'll realize.

838
01:04:56,610 --> 01:05:00,870
What being powerless means.

839
01:05:02,430 --> 01:05:04,490
- Manager Han. 
- Yes?

840
01:05:04,490 --> 01:05:06,890
Get Kim Hui Wu's call history.

841
01:05:06,890 --> 01:05:10,050
- And find out about all of his personal relationships. 
- Yes, I got it.

842
01:05:10,050 --> 01:05:11,120
Manager Kim.

843
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:14,550
Tell the Prosecutor General and the Minister of Justice I want to see them immediately.

844
01:05:14,550 --> 01:05:16,150
Yes, sir.

845
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:21,210
 Prosecution Service 

846
01:05:21,210 --> 01:05:22,640
Gimsan Branch Office?

847
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:23,900
I've never heard of that city.

848
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:25,190
He must be going far.

849
01:05:25,190 --> 01:05:26,620
I don't know what happened.

850
01:05:26,620 --> 01:05:29,630
- Over there. 
 - Maybe he did something wrong.

851
01:05:33,590 --> 01:05:37,070
 Notice of Appointment 

852
01:05:37,070 --> 01:05:39,590
Both of them are getting transferred?

853
01:05:39,590 --> 01:05:41,250
To Gimsan?

854
01:05:41,250 --> 01:05:42,450
I think so.

855
01:05:42,450 --> 01:05:45,050
Why all of a sudden? 
   Han Mi 

856
01:05:45,050 --> 01:05:46,550
Yes?

857
01:05:46,550 --> 01:05:49,540
They suddenly want me to go to Japan as a correspondent.

858
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:00,610
- Seonbae. 
- You're here.

859
01:06:00,610 --> 01:06:03,680
- Investigator Oh. 
- You're here.

860
01:06:08,110 --> 01:06:09,990
We'll meet again soon.

861
01:06:09,990 --> 01:06:14,430
It's fine. I'd rather stay somewhere with fresh air than this uptight Seoul.

862
01:06:14,430 --> 01:06:17,950
Same here. I think Gimsan is more my scene.

863
01:06:18,850 --> 01:06:21,110
Make sure to win.

864
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:24,630
Good luck, Prosecutor Kim.

865
01:06:33,650 --> 01:06:36,160
 Gu Seung Hyeok 

866
01:06:36,950 --> 01:06:38,660
Yes, Seung Hyeok.

867
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:40,750
I'm going to Gangwon Province.

868
01:06:40,750 --> 01:06:43,630
I'm going to Gimsan.

869
01:06:43,630 --> 01:06:46,020
Let me know if there are any good restaurants.

870
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:49,330
You heard her, right? Good luck.

871
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:56,550
 Kim Hui Wu will be completely alone. 

872
01:06:58,010 --> 01:07:04,650
So he will be in despair as if he's standing at a cliff and feel powerless because there's nothing he can do.

873
01:07:04,650 --> 01:07:07,690
He's making an example out of Kim Hui Wu

874
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:12,170
to let the other prosecutors know the assemblyman is to be feared.

875
01:07:13,150 --> 01:07:14,810
I'm sure you know it too.

876
01:07:14,810 --> 01:07:20,040
It's so easy for fear to turn into respect.

877
01:07:34,390 --> 01:07:35,750
 Let me officially introduce myself. 

878
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:38,560
 My name is Park Sang Man. 

879
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:41,890
 It's because I like you. I'm more grateful. 

880
01:07:41,890 --> 01:07:45,620
 You cleared my father's name. 

881
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:49,350
 Fine. Let's do this. 

882
01:07:49,350 --> 01:07:53,290
 Anyone who breaks the law should be punished. 

883
01:07:53,290 --> 01:07:55,420
 I knew you were a woman warrior. 

884
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:57,430
 Shut it, you brat. I'm your senior. 

885
01:07:57,430 --> 01:07:59,490
 You punk. I missed you. 

886
01:07:59,490 --> 01:08:01,360
 Thank you, Hui Wu. 

887
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:05,700
 Someday, hopefully, I can tell you everything. 

888
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:06,890
 I'll wait for that day. 

889
01:08:06,890 --> 01:08:09,260
 I don't want to stop here. 

890
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:13,810
 This darn world where the wicked prosper and the righteous suffer... 

891
01:08:13,810 --> 01:08:14,820
♫  till the war  ♫

892
01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:16,280
 I want to change that world. 

893
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:19,000
 Kim Hui Wu. Let's do this right. 

894
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,250
 Yes, sir. 

895
01:08:20,250 --> 01:08:23,750
♫  I won’t lose control  ♫

896
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:28,160
♫  Till the day I die  ♫

897
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:31,870
♫  well it’s freaking tragedy  ♫

898
01:08:31,870 --> 01:08:35,120
♫  Why you gonna еlude  ♫

899
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:39,070
♫  Looking at the end you choosе  ♫

900
01:08:39,070 --> 01:08:41,760
 I don't have anyone around me anymore. 

901
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:45,890
All of my colleagues and friends are getting hit

902
01:08:45,890 --> 01:08:48,830
by the prosecution service and the press.

903
01:08:48,830 --> 01:08:50,710
And the word has spread

904
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:56,430
that whoever works with me will end up getting burned by Jo Tae Seop.

905
01:08:56,430 --> 01:09:00,940
I expected this, but I didn't think that

906
01:09:00,940 --> 01:09:03,480
I would be completely isolated like this.

907
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:07,890
What about you? Are you okay?

908
01:09:07,890 --> 01:09:11,650
I also didn't expect it to turn out like this.

909
01:09:12,510 --> 01:09:14,900
That it would be to this extent.

910
01:09:18,230 --> 01:09:20,630
"I regretted a bit."

911
01:09:20,630 --> 01:09:25,160
Maybe I should've left Jo Tae Seop be.

912
01:09:27,350 --> 01:09:30,350
Then things wouldn't have gone to this extent.

913
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:36,660
No one would have gotten hurt or died.

914
01:09:41,970 --> 01:09:45,950
But I can't turn back time.

915
01:09:45,950 --> 01:09:49,770
So I'm going to give

916
01:09:49,770 --> 01:09:54,760
Jo Tae Seop a taste of pure misery.

917
01:10:02,650 --> 01:10:05,090
I would like to ask for a favor.

918
01:10:05,090 --> 01:10:06,250
A favor?

919
01:10:06,250 --> 01:10:07,510
Yes.

920
01:10:07,510 --> 01:10:09,240
What is it?

921
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:11,430
Tell me.

922
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:16,440
It could be easy or hard.

923
01:10:17,610 --> 01:10:20,240
Good work, Prosecutor General Yun.

924
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:24,570
I won't have to get involved with the transfers for a while now.

925
01:10:24,570 --> 01:10:26,150
Okay.

926
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:33,780
Kim Hui Wu wants to bring me down.

927
01:10:34,570 --> 01:10:37,140
Do you think you can bring him down?

928
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:38,710
Yes.

929
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:47,770
Is there anything you want?

930
01:10:47,770 --> 01:10:50,590
I want to follow in my father's footsteps.

931
01:10:50,590 --> 01:10:52,290
You want to be a politician?

932
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:58,460
Not yet. But someday, I want to restore my father's honor.

933
01:11:01,910 --> 01:11:08,040
Kim Hui Wu will be your ticket to get a seat in the National Assembly.

934
01:11:10,220 --> 01:11:12,340
Bring him down.

935
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:13,970
Yes, sir.

936
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:26,780
Kim Hui Wu is my ticket.

937
01:11:47,830 --> 01:11:50,380
Hey, Brother.

01:11:51,710 --> 01:11:53,020
 Prosecution Service 

939
01:11:53,020 --> 01:11:55,290
They were transferred out.

940

Seeing what happened here, I feel bad breaking the news.

941
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:01,650
But I must deliver it.

942
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:06,880
Okay. Go ahead.

01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:08,690
Kim Hui Wu.

944
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:13,350
I need you to be my ticket.

945

01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:18,020
Yes.
