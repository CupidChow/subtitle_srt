 Again My Life 

6
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,910
 A country can survive a war. 

7
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,230
 A country can survive both disease and poverty. 

8
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:46,710
 However, a country without justice can never survive.

Prosecutor Oath.

12
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,610
Prosecutor Oath!

13
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:07,390
At this moment, I am called by the country and the people

14
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:11,640
to be a proud and honorable prosecutor for the Republic of Korea.

15
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,660
As a representative, I will uphold justice and human rights 
 Celebration: New Prosecutor Ceremony 

16
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,860
and protect the community and public from crime

17
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:22,230
as I am entrusted with this grave duty.

18
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:27,780
 Episode 1 

19
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,880
What are you doing?

20
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,420
Prosecutor, you've come.

21
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,330
You were told to enforce the law, but you're just standing facing them.

22
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:58,110
Is this Panmunjom? Is this a demilitarized zone?

23
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,340
I see you guys are armed, at least.

24
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,830
- What are you doing, Captain? 
 - We were waiting for a warrant.

25
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,780
I told you their boss would try to escape as a stowaway and that it was urgent!

26
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,740
I told you to arrest without a warrant.

27
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:17,520
You know that we're 21st-century policemen who have to follow procedure! Why are you being like this?

28
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,200
If two or more able-bodied men, regardless of field-work,

29
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,630
have equipment in their hands that can be used as blunt instruments and confront a public official for more than three minutes,

30
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:28,580
it can be regarded as the formation and participation of criminal organizations,

31
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:31,800
even those who engage in simple activities

32
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:37,070
will be sentenced to a minimum of two years in prison or fined a minimum of 50 million won.

33
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,570
Hey, give me that.

34
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,660
I told you it's  a minimum   50 million won fine.

35
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,270
Hey.

36
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm sure you've heard of a maximum fine,

37
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,560
but a minimum fine is all new to you, no?

38
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,180
- Yeah. 
  - Right.

39
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,340
Not fair, is it?

40
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,560
 - Ah, you scared me! 

41
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,690
Damn, it split open.

42
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,830
- Ah, what are you doing? South Korea's prosecutor's head was just split open!

43
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:40,760
He's a freaking lunatic.

44
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:49,320
Now, on the count of three, drop your weapons and follow me politely.

45
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,530
One.

46
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,290
Two.

47
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,860
- Three. 
 - What are you guys doing?

48
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,880
Let's go!

49
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:48,310
 I am a brave prosecutor who removes the darkness from injustice. 

50
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:51,410
 Gyodae Station, Courts, Prosecutors' Office 

51
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,260
- Ma’am. 
 - Yes?

52
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,820
You're in front of the prosecutor's office. There will be a crackdown in no time.

53
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:07,290
But I haven't even sold anything yet.

54
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:16,630
Yes, it's me. Today's lunch is going to be kimbap.

55
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,860
Ma'am, I'll take everything here.

56
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,960
- All these? 
- You should get to sell something, at least.

57
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,070
 - Thank you so much! 

58
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:30,800
 A warm-hearted  prosecutor who cares for the powerless and the excluded. 

59
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,810
 They're here!
   

60
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:48,380
Prosecutor Kim.  There is public opinion that during a protracted economic recession,

61
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:52,390
an intense investigation into a large corporation can have adverse effects on the economy.

62
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,700
What's your opinion?

63
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,630
The economy is the force that sustains the nation.

64
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:01,530
There is only one reason the nation is failing economically.

65
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,570
Corruption.

66
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:06,320
As a person affiliated with the prosecution, believing that the law should be protected,

67
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:11,840
I only think that it is my duty to eradicate that corruption.

68
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,760
When will the results of the investigation be announced?

69
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,170
Prosecutor, just one more question!

70
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:20,520
 An impartial prosecutor who pursues the truth only. 

71
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,880
There was an instance of that slush fund flowing into political circles.

72
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,450
"Who is responsible?"

73
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:32,130
If I asked that, I'm sure you would say that you don't know, right?

74
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,940
It's Jo Tae Seop, isn’t it?

75
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:42,350
There it is. I expected to see that kind of expression, and I did.

76
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:46,630
- Are you scared?
 - Isn't there anything you're scared of?

77
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:54,780
Well, coming to work on Mondays always scares me.

78
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,380
Now.

79
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:03,700
Look, Jo Tae Seop is a criminal.

80
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:08,460
He's not someone to be scared of but someone you just need to report.

81
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:12,010
Then I arrest him. Got it?

82
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:15,430
Speak up! Are you just going to maintain your right to be silent?

83
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,780
In the event of a false accusation,

84
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,850
you could be punished under Act 156.

85
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:23,000
Do you acknowledge that?

86
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:31,670
Prosecutor, I received a call from the head of the management strategy department.

87
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:35,460
 As a prosecutor who is stricter and more honest with himself. 

88
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:01,330
 Kim Hui Wu 
 Prosecutor 

89
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,930
 Cheonha 

90
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:15,990
I'm trusting you.

91
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:19,320
I will give my testimony.

92
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,450
 Name: Jo Tae Seop 
 Resident Identification Number: 5203 

93
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:33,800
 Prosecution Service 

94
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:37,330
 Warrant 

95
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,710
  On my honor I swear firmly  

96
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:52,840
  to serve with all of my might the people  

97
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,020
 of the nation for the sake of the country. 

98
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,850
- Don't do it. 
 - "Don't do it?"

99
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,650
- Yeah, don't do it. 
- Why?

100
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:03,510
There is no one in the entirety of South Korea who thinks Jo Tae Seop is a criminal.
  Kim Seok Hun: Chief Prosecutor of Seoul 

101
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,170
Since they're being fooled.

102
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:09,100
I will make sure he gets punished for deceiving the citizens by pretending to be an angel.

103
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,540
Do you think a prosecutor who targets power has a chance to win?

104
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,820
But it's not impossible.

105
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:24,370
Because of you, people are calling from all over the place.

106
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:29,820
Good. Give me a list of everyone who's called. I will have them all arrested.

107
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,830
Now I see why they call you a lunatic prosecutor.

108
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:35,980
I catch bad guys. Who cares if I'm a lunatic?

109
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:39,100
I am a prosecutor who catches criminals.

110
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,270
 Kim Seok Hun: Chief Prosecutor of Seoul 

111
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:46,700
Do you think that there aren't any other prosecutors who work with the same conviction and confidence as you?

112
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:51,490
That those prosecutors are keeping things buried because they have no volition or thought?

113
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:56,500
Conviction is only good when you can beat your opponent.

114
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,460
Prepare well and use that conviction when you know you can win.

115
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,480
Do you think I'm not prepared enough?

116
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,260
Don't think that you are well-prepared because you're wrong.

117
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,670
 Kim Seok-Hoon: Chief Prosecutor of Seoul 

118
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:17,700
The village that you are trying to touch has its own order.

119
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,720
When you're trying to get to its center, where would you tread?

120
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,000
Obviously, you'd step on the village grounds to get in,

121
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,720
thereby upending their order.

122
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,380
Then, instinctively, the villagers will join forces and grow power.

123
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,760
At that point, it is no longer a fight between two individuals.

124
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,570
Who said that the people in that village could live without any rules?

125
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:41,950
- Perhaps, do you live in that village? 
 - Hey, Kim Hui Wu.

126
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:44,750
Why did you meet with Jo Tae Seop yesterday?

127
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,560
- You're even tailing me now?  
 - I tail criminals, and our paths overlapped.

128
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,860
Thanks to an unrealistic subordinate,

129
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:58,230
I had to have dinner, which didn't suit my taste, and do my job. Happy now?

130
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:01,120
I would like to believe you, sir.

131
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,930
No matter what I say, you wouldn't get it right now.

132
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:08,230
There's no right time for filtering out bad advice.

133
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,130
You may leave.

134
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:15,890
Yes, sir.

135
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,220
Assemblyman, sir, it's me.

136
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,720
I think you'll have to prepare yourself for what's to come.

137
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,540
 Kim Seok Hun: Chief Prosecutor of Seoul 

138
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:52,600
 Can anyone stop Jo Tae Seop's skyrocketing presidential candidate approval rating? 

139
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,790
  Expected to secure over 68% of votes 

140
00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:01,300
You have no idea what kind of person Jo Tae Seop is yet.

141
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,110
You're all so frustrating.

142
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:10,500
Do you really think this matter deserves a meeting?

143
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,310
From Assemblyman Yun as well, 
  Democratic Party 

144
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:15,110
people are opposing.

145
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:20,020
- He's a seven-term assemblyman and father-in-law of the President. Expulsion is too— 
 - Look!

146
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:27,250
"President's Father-in-law, Assemblyman Yun Yeong Hun, is bashed with criticism for only protecting his family."

147
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:31,220
"He criticizes the aid who was sexually assaulted by Assemblyman Gu Wuk Cheong."

148
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:34,340
In this world where women are getting wiser.

149
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:39,460
What's good is serving seven terms when he speaks like someone who's been newly elected?!

150
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,870
Everyone seems to be at ease since the general election is already won.

151
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:49,770
But it's hard for politicians with no sensitivity to gender-related issues to survive.

152
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:55,810
In the future, pay some attention to what the opinions of the youth and future voters are!

153
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:59,660
Expel Assemblyman Yun right away. I'll take responsibility.

154
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:15,000
 Cheong Wa Dae "Blue House" – Home and Office of President of Republic of Korea 

155
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:20,010
They're waiting for you.

156
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:24,300
Oh, hold on.

157
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:28,820
It's not a meeting you can sit in, Chief of Staff.

158
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:41,900
 Heo Jae Geun, President 

159
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,940
- You! 
 - Assemblyman Jo!

160
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,700
Assemblyman Jo?

161
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,220
Do you think you can look down on the world now that you're in that seat?

162
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:58,550
"Expulsion of Assemblyman Yun excessive."

163
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,810
"Come in for a sec"?

164
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,080
I got you elected as President so you can serve the country,

165
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,590
but you're sitting here only worried about your father-in-law.

166
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:14,690
Why are you fussing over your in-laws while sitting in the Blue House?!

167
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,930
  Would 300 billion won (~300 million USD) be enough?  

168
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:30,820
 You can't win the presidential election with just 56 billion won. 

169
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:35,040
 I'll give you 100 billion won (~100 million USD) today and 200 billion won in a week. 
 Presidential Candidate Heo Jae Geun  

170
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,930
 They say you can forget your enemies, but you should always return favors. 

171
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:42,720
 What can I do for you? 

172
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,630
 I'm not greedy. 

173
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:50,070
 Just become President and take care of Korea. 

174
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:55,580
 All I care about is to have one of my people become President. 

175
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:01,280
 Since I felt it wouldn't look good for a presidential candidate, 

176
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:05,070
 I sent her to America. 

177
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,480
 She won't be able to return to the country for five years. 

178
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,080
 Do you know why I am called the kingmaker? 

179
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:24,190
 Or why the candidate I choose wins the presidential election? 

180
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,040
 It's because passing my verification process is 

181
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:32,310
 10 to 20 times harder than one carried out by the party. 

182
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,520
Your mistress in LA

183
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,270
is huffing and puffing because she's still angry.

184
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:47,150
Should I go there myself and remove her gag so she can speak?

185
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,140
That's right.

186
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:57,530
Think of it as a dual executive system for the rest of your term and visit other countries.

187
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:02,440
Go to the military bases and take some pictures with soldiers while shoveling.

188
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,210
I'll take care of the rest.

189
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,790
From now on, this is how we administer the affairs of the state.

190
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:16,130
This country has me, Jo Tae Seop, and the president.

191
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:18,240
Do you understand?

192
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,760
  The Prosecutor's Office just summoned the assemblyman. Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun  

193
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,170
What is it?

194
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,200
I just received word that you have been summoned by the prosecution.

195
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,580
Okay.

196
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:58,790
I'll finally get to meet him.

197
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:04,500
Let's go get something to eat first. I know a great rice and side dish place in Seochodong.

198
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:09,480
- Do you like spicy food? 
 - Yes.

199
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,280
 Prosecutor's Office  

200
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,400
 Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office  

201
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:20,790
Sir! Sir!

202
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,400
Do you acknowledge the charges of violations of the Aggravated Punishment for Specific Crimes Act brought against you by the prosecution?

203
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,990
We only acknowledge something when it's true.

204
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:46,120
The allegations brought forth by the prosecution have absolutely nothing to do with me.

205
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:50,850
I'm just very sad to have caused concern to the people

206
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:55,610
who have believed and supported me for a long time.

207
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:59,440
Some are saying that this is the prosecution's way of doing away with the presidential candidate.

208
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,480
Please hold your judgment until the results are released.

209
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,250
 When will those results be released?  

210
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:10,140
  Kim Seok Hun  

211
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:22,980
It feels different being back here after all this time.

212
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,810
- Maybe because I'm here as a suspect. 
 - I apologize.

213
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:28,960
No, no. You did your job.

214
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,450
The prosecution office had a lot of concerns about it as well.

215
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:35,480
It's something that I had to go through at least once.

216
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,460
I think of it as a vaccination.

217
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:44,100
It's nice that I don't have to bother my people and can have someone else take care of it.

218
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:49,190
But, Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu isn't an easy person to deal with.

219
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:51,110
That's how he should be.

220
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:54,990
I didn't come here to see someone who only lives a day, did I?

221
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:03,390
I should go. Thanks for the coffee.

222
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:50,410
So this is how we meet, Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu.

223
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:52,570
It's nice to meet you.

224
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:57,430
I don't think that's how a suspect should greet a prosecutor.

225
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,650
I'm sure you wanted to meet me as well.

226
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:04,340
That's true, but I'm not that glad about it.

227
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:08,680
- You're full of energy. 
 - You're full of ambition.

228
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,270
You're funny too.

229
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:21,720
- Mister. 
 - Mister?

230
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,080
This is a prosecution investigation room,

231
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,180
and you're a suspect.

232
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:31,930
You're only Jo Tae Seop when you're outside. Are we outside right now?

233
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,260
I see.

234
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:37,120
I brought that powerful Jo Tae Seop in here

235
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,160
to show what garbage he really is.

236
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,130
Why?

237
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:46,660
Because it's true that you're the trash of all trash.

238
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:49,750
And even more importantly,

239
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:54,160
if your usual tactics of putting your all into tearing me down were going to work on me,

240
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,420
I wouldn't have brought you here in the first place.

241
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:59,310
No, I wouldn't have been able to bring you here.

242
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:04,820
And even if I did bring you here, I wouldn't have been able to call you trash to your face.

243
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,950
I would have taken your order of Americano,

244
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:09,200
and asked if I should add syrup to your coffee.

245
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,370
I would have asked you about things like that.

246
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:17,350
But, did I ask you how you wanted your coffee today?

247
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:20,690
Do you not understand the situation?

248
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,880
I think I understand the situation.

249
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:29,820
If we're clear now, you should sit up and stop being at ease.

250
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:36,270
I don't know what you've misunderstood, but nothing I do is about personal gain.

251
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:39,570
- Only for the people—  
 - I'll start the questioning.

252
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:42,590
You seem to have a lot to say.

253
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:46,660
I'm looking forward to what you have up your sleeve.

254
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:50,950
The higher the expectation, the higher the disappointment, so make sure to do your job well.

255
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:53,990
It seems like you still don't get it.

256
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,660
Hui Wu.

257
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:06,460
Hui Wu?

258
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:11,460
Have you thought about what purpose justice without true power serves?

259
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:16,120
It's not that you people are ignorant because you are civil servants but you became civil servants because you're ignorant.

260
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:20,910
You still don't understand that because you're ignorant. Idiots...

261
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:30,430
About justice... the justice that looks pretty cool when you see it in movies,

262
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:32,710
it's not something you can have just because you want it.

263
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:38,190
It's not you but it's justice that chooses the person.

264
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:45,870
Do you know the word naive? What you have right now is not justice.

265
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:50,180
It's naivety that is firmly based on stupidity.

266
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:56,510
If you want to break me, you have to break the system that was structured for me first.

267
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:59,660
Do you think you're here to give a seminar?

268
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:02,120
You're not here on an invitation.

269
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,730
Okay. Fine.

270
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:12,470
I'll break that system down piece by piece from now on.

271
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:18,060
Prosecutor Kim, you have secured a witness, right?

272
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:22,030
A witness only starts to show their value when they stand in court.

273
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:26,030
But if they can't do that...

274
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,380
Room service.

275
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,370
Speaking of which, wasn't it too easy?

276
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:58,510
Getting to see me.

277
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,470
I wanted to see

278
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:05,240
who the prosecutor was that brought me all the way here.

279
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:13,060
Don't you want to use that get-up-and-go spirit somewhere a little more valuable?

280
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,420
Sir...

281
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:48,350
 I can't contact the Cheonha Group's strategy department head who was staying at the hotel. 

282
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,440
 Cheonha Head of Strategy Department 

283
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:01,400
 Text Message: Please save me. 

284
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,580
 I-I'm so sorry. 

285
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:19,260
  I-I'm so sorry... I'm so sorry!

286
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:22,160
Bastards...!

287
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:40,550
 Information got leaked. Jo Tae Seop already knew about our plans. 

288
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,290
 We're keeping safe the person you're looking for. 

289
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,840
  Prosecutor's Office  

290
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:39,070
The interrogation with the prosecutor ended earlier than expected. How did it go?

291
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:42,350
I did my best to participate in the investigation.

292
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:45,840
The judgment is up to the court.

293
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:06,710
This restaurant is famous for its stir-fried octopus.

294
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:11,640
It's different from what they have in Yeouido. It's very spicy.

295
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,610
Yes.

296
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:34,690
Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu just got there. Should we get rid of them both?

297
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:38,550
No need to get rid of a dog that has tucked its tail.

298
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,950
- Surprised? 
 - A little.

299
00:27:56,950 --> 00:28:00,700
I'm different from other weak prosecutors.

300
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:04,300
I'm also different from other neighborhood gangsters.

301
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:09,390
Okay, let's cut to the chase.

302
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,110
Come on then.

303
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:02,600
If you say you will stop here, I'll spare your life.

304
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,470
How can you trust me?

305
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:09,710
It doesn't matter. I'm not afraid of a dog that's tucked its tail.

306
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:11,710
Too bad.

307
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:15,700
I don't want to be a dog that's surrendered.

308
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,790
This is your last chance. Beg for your life.

309
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,220
Please spare me.

310
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:32,090
So I can wipe you guys out completely.

311
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:36,630
You need to die.

312
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:50,410
That's what you think.

313
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:20,750
You instigated and attempted murder. You have the right to an attorney.

314
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:25,850
You have the right to remain silent, and anything you say

315
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:28,110
can be used against you in court.

316
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,060
Your arm might break.

317
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:41,100
I've carried out my orders. I'll finish him off as instructed.

318
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:48,180
He says he'll finish him off.

319
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:54,150
You brewed it very clean and nice. Since I drank some good tea,

320
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:59,020
I'll sleep well tonight. Thank you.

321
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:14,660
It's a mixture of alcohol and meth.

322
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:18,980
Tomorrow morning, people will find out a corrupted prosecutor

323
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:24,430
killed himself by drinking and overdosing.

324
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:03,080
 The Zenith 

325
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,080
I'm dead, right?

326
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,690
Yes.

327
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:20,570
But why does it hurt?

328
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:25,610
The parts where I got hit before I died hurt really bad.

329
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:27,700
Who said it wouldn't hurt when you die?

330
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,450
I thought that was how it worked.

331
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:32,310
It's misinformation.

332
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,530
You're killing me twice.

333
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,130
That was a joke.

334
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:38,220
If you go up to the afterworld, it won't hurt.

335
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:40,140
Why would you make that kind of joke to a dead person?

336
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:43,220
Until you feel better, I'll do my work.

337
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:45,000
You are such an odd person.

338
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,410
I'm not a person.

339
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:02,330
Let's skim through your life for a second.

340
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:03,810
  Move quickly!  

341
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,980
  The next station is the crotch.  

342
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,870
  Crotch.  

343
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:16,010
  What did you say? This bastard.  

344
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:17,660
  Stop it.  

345
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,570
  Are you crazy?  

346
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:22,050
  Why are you misbehaving?  

347
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:23,990
  Are you out of your mind?  

348
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:26,320
  Are you crazy? Look down!  

349
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,550
  This is a crazy bastard.  

350
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:33,900
Kim Hui Wu. You got beaten up throughout your life.

351
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:37,470
Usually, people who have justice

352
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:40,530
but don't have power get beaten up a bit.

353
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:54,200
Your parents passed away in a hit-and-run accident.

354
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,990
Then...

355
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:01,530
will I be able to see my parents now?

356
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,020
You did martial arts, too.

357
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:08,350
I decided to be strong.

358
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,180
  Wear this.  

359
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:31,400
I decided to do it to survive and protect myself.

360
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:50,430
  Yes! There you go!  

361
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:11,890
Accepted to the Department of Law at Hankook University after three attempts.

362
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
  The General Provisions of the Civil Code  

363
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:20,040
  The 2nd room for the 57th Bar Exam's first test  

364
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:23,060
  Lecture room 317  

365
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:28,860
 You passed the bar exam and became a prosecutor. 

366
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,800
 And then... 

367
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:39,380
 About justice... the justice that looks pretty cool when you see it in movies, 

368
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,660
 it's not something you can have just because you want it. 

369
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,080
  It's not you  

370
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:47,590
  but justice which chooses the person.  

371
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:50,340
Did you provoke Jo Tae Seop?

372
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:53,450
What do you mean provoke? I'm a prosecutor.

373
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:57,650
Jo Tae Seop is just a dirty criminal. Never mind provoke,

374
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:00,080
my job is to lock him up in jail even if I have to beat him up!

375
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:04,090
But you failed and got murdered.

376
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:07,230
Maybe it's because you had justice but no power.

377
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:12,280
You didn't even get to show your strength and got killed.

378
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:15,860
I'll acknowledge that since this was the end result.

379
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:22,640
If you had survived this fight, would you have put Jo Tae Seop in jail?

380
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,640
Would he have been brought to justice?

381
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,830
I'm not sure.

382
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:35,140
If you had another life, would you use it to put Jo Tae Seop in jail?

383
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:37,450
It's a job I put my life on the line for.

384
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:42,990
It was predetermined and something I have to do.

385
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:46,970
Do that then.

386
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:53,860
Take time to prepare and finish him off properly.

387
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:59,030
If you move hastily, you could face a useless death again.

388
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:02,690
I'm telling you I'll spare your life.

389
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:05,460
- What? 
 - Make sure you bring him down.

390
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:08,820
Punishment in the afterworld is too late.

391
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:13,410
Please show him that there's a living hell in this world.

392
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:15,110
Promise me.

393
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:19,540
Can you show him a living hell?

394
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:26,700
I'll show him.

395
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:31,620
When you get closer to Jo Tae Seop, you might see me again.

396
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,300
Don't forget.

397
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:42,360
You cannot catch the devil unless you are a bigger monster.

398
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:49,930
Please get it done.

399
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:53,900
Make sure you succeed.

400
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:12,350
Hey.

401
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,370
Hey.

402
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:18,580
Hey!

403
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,580
What are you doing?

404
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:25,590
Are you not going to ring me up?

405
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:35,030
Why are you staring at me?

406
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:36,160
Kim Han Mi?

407
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,540
Yeah, I'm Kim Han Mi.

408
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:55,000
  This is the convenience store where I worked after graduating from high school.  

409
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,880
  But what am I doing here right now?  

410
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:01,390
  Punishment in the afterworld is too late. 

411
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:05,100
  Please show him that there's a living hell in this world.  

412
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,880
Hey!

413
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:41,380
  A Convenience Store Devoted to You 
 Part-timer: Kim Hui Wu  

414
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,820
How did this happen?

415
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:51,420
  I'm telling you I'll spare your life.  

416
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:17,420
Did I really come back to life?

417
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:32,800
  Again My Life  

418
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:39,520
 Take time to prepare and finish him off properly. 

419
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:46,420
  If you move hastily, you could face a useless death again. 

420
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:53,930
Did she really send me back to my past?

421
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:00,860
If this is real...

422
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:14,190
  I have to go home. 

423
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:42,680
It's here. The house I used to live in.

424
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:03,380
  Kim Chan Seong  

425
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:21,660
  I was an immature son.  

426
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,960
  Did you eat?  

427
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:31,560
  That temper...  

428
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,030
  We'll be back from work!  

429
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:38,200
  I made you breakfast, so don't forget to eat!  

430
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:41,450
  Let's go. Let's just go.  

431
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:48,110
  That was the last time with my parents.  

432
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:22,920
  Pushed to survive, my parents couldn't take good care of me.  

433
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:26,450
  And I ignored and resented them.  

434
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:28,570
  That's why  

435
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:33,160
  I wanted my parents to see the untouched food on the table  

436
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:36,830
  when they came home and feel heartbroken.  

437
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,170
  Hello?  

438
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:56,090
 What's going on?  

439
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:31,630
  Kim Chan Seong 
 Lee Mi Ok  

440
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:44,720
 That's how my parents died  

441
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:49,950
 and left behind a son filled with resentment and anxiety.  

442
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:28,210
  I was hungry.  

443
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:33,400
  Son,  

444
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:38,390
  I'm sorry that I was so busy that I couldn't make you anything delicious.  

445
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:43,460
 There's some bulgogi in the fridge, so warm it up and eat it with this.  

446
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:53,100
  The last meal cooked by my mom 

447
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:44,020
  I was desperate  

448
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:47,120
 because I never had the chance  

449
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:51,350
  to make up for my mistakes. 

450
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:16,540
  But if I've come back to this time, 

451
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:19,920
 it might be before my parents died.  

452
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:24,220
 Please. 

453
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:29,020
  I hope that the heavens have given me this once in a lifetime chance.  

454
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:51,800
Mom!

455
00:49:56,650 --> 00:49:58,830
Father.

456
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:06,380
Mom!

457
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:43,070
Hui Wu? Are you already done with your part-time job?

458
00:50:51,610 --> 00:50:53,660
M-Mom.

459
00:50:54,990 --> 00:50:56,680
Mom.

460
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:01,520
Mom?

461
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:08,570
What's wrong with you all of the sudden?

462
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:10,830
Is something wrong?

463
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:20,980
What's with all the hugging? Did something happen?

464
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:24,550
Father.

465
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:28,110
Why are you doing this to me, too? It feels awkward.

466
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:40,000
It's burdensome.

467
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:43,550
I'm back!

468
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:47,350
Obviously.

469
00:51:47,350 --> 00:51:50,980
Hey. Are you going to keep making it awkward?

470
00:51:58,930 --> 00:52:03,140
 I didn't believe it, but I came back to life. 

471
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:06,810
  I thought that law and justice were enough, 

472
00:52:06,810 --> 00:52:09,120
 but I was ambitious and arrogant.  

473
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:14,460
 Take time to prepare and finish him off properly. 

474
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:17,590
She wants me to start preparing from now.

  May 18th  

478
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,700
 Good Student 

479
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:39,340
Come on, brat...

480
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:41,410
Are you asleep?

481
00:52:41,410 --> 00:52:43,350
No!

482
00:52:43,350 --> 00:52:47,230
Your father and I going out to do a job.

483
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,450
Mom, wait a moment.

484
00:52:51,450 --> 00:52:54,390
I'll open it for you.

485
00:52:54,390 --> 00:52:57,350
Why do you keep being weird and doing things you wouldn't normally do?

486
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:03,880
Be safe. Drive safely since it's dark.

487
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:06,410
Hui Wu. Why are being like this?

488
00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:08,200
What?

489
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,340
Son ...

490
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:11,740
Are you angry?

491
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:14,110
I don't know what happened, but I'm sorry.

492
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:16,060
What do you mean angry? I'm just seeing you off.

493
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:20,170
You always rebel against us.

494
00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:22,910
But since earlier, you've felt a little different.

495
00:53:22,910 --> 00:53:25,920
By any chance, are you going to join a temple?

496
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,060
It's nothing like that.

497
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:30,700
What is this about seeing us off?

498
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,610
Come here.

499
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:36,570
He's doing it again.

500
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:40,220
What exactly did we do so wrong?

501
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:45,540
If you're not angry, are you sick?

502
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:48,130
Yes. I'm sick.

503
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:52,880
I'm sick since I'm so happy.

504
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:56,050
Why do you keep hugging us? He must have lost his mind.

505
00:53:56,050 --> 00:53:58,860
This isn't our son, is it?

506
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:00,540
I'm not dreaming.

507
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:04,550
And it does look like him. Is it a mask?

508
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:05,980
I am your son.

509
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:07,380
Let's go.

510
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:08,430
Go ahead.

511
00:54:08,430 --> 00:54:09,630
Be safe.

512
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:12,550
Can we leave our house to that stranger?

513
00:54:13,390 --> 00:54:15,630
Who are you?

514
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:26,460
 I'm not sure if what is happening right now is a dream or reality. 

515
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:28,880
If it's the past or the future.

516
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:34,510
 Everything is still confusing, but I'm sure about one thing.

That's true.

 Kim Hui Wu  

553
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,400
He must be new.

554
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:43,070
Look who it is!

555
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:44,980
Why? You want to study for college?

556
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:48,280
It's not for working at the convenience store.

557
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,960
You're all done with that, huh?

558
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,540
You've matured a lot, Kim Hui Wu.

559
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:53,130
Aren't you embarrassed?

560
00:56:53,130 --> 00:56:56,680
- What?  
 - If you graduated from school, stop acting like a punk.

561
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,860
Study.

562
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:06,650
 It's math. 

563
00:57:06,650 --> 00:57:09,690
  It'll take some time for me to get in the groove.  

564
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:10,920
Just memorize it all?

565
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:14,140
Yes. Just memorize all of the ways of problem-solving.

566
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:16,900
If I memorize it, do you think I can be good at math?

567
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:19,410
Of course, why? you don't believe it?

568
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:21,490
No. It's not that.

569
00:57:21,490 --> 00:57:24,460
I haven't studied math in a long time.

570
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:27,280
How long has it been?

571
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:31,860
I think... maybe 17 years?

572
00:57:33,830 --> 00:57:35,060
No.

573
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:37,750
It's because I'm worried.

574
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:40,160
You can do it.

575
00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:47,690
This book shows problem-solving methods very well. So study this and memorize it.

576
00:57:47,690 --> 00:57:50,010
Okay.

577
00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:51,900
Thank you.

578
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:55,430
Can I have some expectations of you?

579
00:57:56,430 --> 00:57:58,860
Yes. Definitely.

580
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:01,140
This is shout without a sound.

581
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:04,240
This expression includes metaphor and paradox.

582
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,980
Because shout without a sound doesn't make any sense.

583
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:11,550
That's why it's a paradox. And "this" and "shout" are equal, so it's a metaphor.

584
00:58:11,550 --> 00:58:15,830
Mang and Mangsoi's uprising happened in Myeonghak-so, Gongju.

585
00:58:15,830 --> 00:58:20,690
Please memorize this well.

586
00:58:20,690 --> 00:58:23,820
You have to do it as K divided by N.

587
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:26,350
But what should you divide this with?

588
00:58:26,350 --> 00:58:29,150
- With 3n. 
 - That's right!

589
00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:44,820
Mom. Father!

590
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:46,680
Hui Wu.

591
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:18,180
Mom!

592
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:21,000
What is it?

593
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:29,700
I am sorry. I didn't sleep well yesterday night.

594
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:36,880
So the word that precedes the prepositions and the relative pronouns

595
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:38,010
means the place.

596
00:59:38,010 --> 00:59:39,620
 It's tomorrow. 

597
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:42,860

600
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:00,950
Is there any way I can make my parents take a day off?

601
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:08,870
That's the easiest way to do it.

  May 18th  

603
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:14,600
Hui Wu, let's eat.

604
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:16,390
Yes.

605
01:00:22,810 --> 01:00:25,800
Honey, have this kimchi. It's perfectly ripe now.

606
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:31,040
 This could end up being our last dinner. 

607
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:34,040
Oh no, Hui Wu, you lost weight.

608
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:35,740
Aren't you studying too hard?

609
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:40,190
No. I'm working out too, so don't worry.

610
01:00:40,190 --> 01:00:44,890
Good. Becoming the top of the class is nice, but I like that you're doing something diligently more.

611
01:00:44,890 --> 01:00:47,050
Our family just lived off of our looks generationally.

612
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:50,130
So seeing how you're working so hard on something, it's nice to see.

613
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:51,030
Go, go!

614
01:00:51,030 --> 01:00:53,270
Don't push him too hard. He'll ruin his health!

615
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:57,260
Hui Wu, I don't care as long as you're healthy.

616
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:59,420
- So—
 - She's lying.

617
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:02,660
She's bragging so much at the factory that you are studying hard.

618
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:04,710
Of course, I should brag!

619
01:01:04,710 --> 01:01:06,430
You're my son, after all.

620
01:01:06,430 --> 01:01:09,090
- Right?
 - Whose son? He's my son.

621
01:01:09,090 --> 01:01:13,160
We look alike. We look exactly the same.

622
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:22,460
Mom, can you not go to work today?

623
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:24,760
Why? What's the matter?

624
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:27,130
You said you had some aches and pains.

625
01:01:27,130 --> 01:01:29,550
I thought it might be nice for you to take a day off.

626
01:01:29,550 --> 01:01:33,750
You can't take off because you're aching. It's a blessing to have jobs in this bad economy.

627
01:01:33,750 --> 01:01:37,050
That's right. At times like these,

628
01:01:37,050 --> 01:01:39,570
we need to work harder and more diligently.

629
01:01:41,310 --> 01:01:44,050
I'm not going to my part-time work today. Why don't we go out—

630
01:01:44,050 --> 01:01:46,850
You can take a break, but we should work.

631
01:01:46,850 --> 01:01:49,290
- There's no time to take a break for us. 
 - Yes.

632
01:01:49,290 --> 01:01:51,310
- Why don't you eat some more? 
 - Okay.

633
01:01:51,310 --> 01:01:55,810
  Right. My parents are not people who would take off from their work.  

634
01:01:55,810 --> 01:01:59,180
  I shouldn't make them feel uncomfortable.  

635
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:03,650
  I'll just wait in front of the factory and escort them back home.  

636
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:31,820
  It's a typically poor investigation.  

637
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:34,050
  There might not be any surveillance cameras,  

638
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:38,450
  but there would have been skid marks and car debris.  

639
01:02:38,450 --> 01:02:43,510
  If they looked into car bumper repair histories, they could've found suspected cars.  

640
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:48,420
  They didn't even do this basic investigation. Why?  

641
01:02:57,090 --> 01:03:00,770
 Wasn't the time of the accident also manipulated?  

642
01:03:00,770 --> 01:03:06,830
  If that's the correct time, then my parents should've been working the night shift.  

643
01:03:06,830 --> 01:03:10,190
  May 18th, 2007, 03:38 AM, Presumed time of the death by hit-and-run  

644
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,110
 Snow Removal Tool Box 

645
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:20,150
 Snow Removal Tool Box 

646
01:03:20,150 --> 01:03:23,900
 Snow Removal Tool Box 

647
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:33,060
  I should let my parents walk along the street on the inside, and I'll walk on the outside. 

648
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:37,610
 That way I'll be ready for the accident. 

649
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:44,220
Mom, Mom!

650
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:47,320
Hui Wu, why are you here?

651
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:50,050
I missed you, so I came.

652
01:04:50,050 --> 01:04:53,240
I mean, I couldn't sleep, so I came out for a walk.

653
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:55,590
You don't know when we will finish. Why did you come?

654
01:04:55,590 --> 01:04:59,480
What brought you here? The machine stopped somehow, so we came out early.

655
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:03,380
It's cold at night. You might have waited for us for a long time, Hui Wu.

656
01:05:04,490 --> 01:05:07,690
  Because of the machine breakdown, they got off from work earlier.  

657
01:05:07,690 --> 01:05:10,910
  Now the mystery of the time of death got resolved.  

658
01:05:16,390 --> 01:05:18,290
It's too cramped.

659
01:05:18,290 --> 01:05:22,220
Don't come out from now on. You have to go to class in the morning, so you should be in bed.

660
01:05:22,220 --> 01:05:25,320
But it's good to see my son.

661
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,500
Maybe we had telepathy.

662
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:30,170
How can we run into each other at the exact time? Right?

663
01:05:30,170 --> 01:05:32,390
Right.

664
01:05:32,390 --> 01:05:36,270
Don't walk around in the middle of the night without fear, even if you are a guy.

665
01:05:36,270 --> 01:05:38,930
Right, listen to your dad.

666
01:05:38,930 --> 01:05:42,600
Do you know how fast the cars go around here?

667
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:45,140
Yes.

668
01:05:50,350 --> 01:05:52,340
 It's coming. 

669
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:02,850
What's wrong?

670
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:08,510
What is that?

671
01:06:08,510 --> 01:06:10,070
Pardon?

672
01:06:10,070 --> 01:06:11,690
That...

673
01:06:16,290 --> 01:06:18,220
Get out of the way!

674
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,610
No!

675
01:06:33,020 --> 01:06:39,990


676
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,980
Mom.

677
01:06:49,510 --> 01:06:51,670
Father.

678
01:06:53,410 --> 01:06:57,390
  Am I going to end up alone again?  

679
01:06:57,390 --> 01:07:01,490
♫  Dear, All your things you've done  ♫

680
01:07:01,490 --> 01:07:05,040
♫   We are here to wreck it up   ♫

681
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:10,650
♫  Who knows, how will it go?  ♫

682
01:07:14,190 --> 01:07:18,410
♫  Hiding in black and white  ♫

683
01:07:18,410 --> 01:07:21,830
♫  We are here to find the truth   ♫

684
01:07:21,830 --> 01:07:27,740
♫  Give up, I warn you so  ♫

685
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,370
♫  Who would ever   ♫

686
01:07:31,370 --> 01:07:34,000
 Again My Life 
♫  find out who you really are?  ♫

687
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,580
  Time is moving along as I remember.  

688
01:07:37,580 --> 01:07:43,550
  The time of fate that I have to prevent is approaching as well.  

689
01:07:43,550 --> 01:07:47,820
  Manners maketh man.  

690
01:07:47,820 --> 01:07:50,930
  Since you did it on your own, I bet you dealt with it well.  

691
01:07:50,930 --> 01:07:54,460
  We had been entangled in a dirty karmic bond for a long time.   

692
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:56,150
  You are not suited for this kind of place.  

693
01:07:56,150 --> 01:07:58,540
  Kim Hui Wu? I'm Kim Hui Ah.  

694
01:07:58,540 --> 01:08:04,100
  This is a person I didn't know from my previous life. Fate has changed.  

695
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:06,500
♫  Oh I'll wait for now  ♫

696
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:11,260
  Again My Life
