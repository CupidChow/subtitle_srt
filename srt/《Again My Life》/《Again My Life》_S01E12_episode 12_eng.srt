1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:08,670


2
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,790
 Lee Joon Gi 

3
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:12,830
 Lee Kyung Young 

4
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:15,610
 Kim Ji Eun 

5
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:35,110
 Again My Life 

6
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:28,880
 Han Ji Hyeon? 

7
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:45,520
 The fate of others is changing because I am living again. 

8
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,410
 A butterfly's wings fluttering in the sky may result in a typhoon elsewhere.  

9
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:19,120
 Grim Reaper Han Ji Hyeon, you brought me back to life! 

10
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,490
 Are we enemies or friends? 

11
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:37,470
 Again My Life 

12
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:40,210
 Episode 12 

13
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:07,120
 Finally I'm here. The heart of the Republic of Korea’s power!  Where filth gathers.  

14
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,060
Have you been well?

15
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,960
Yes. What brings you here?

16
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:48,480
I'll bring down Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun.

17
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,860
Will you bring down Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun?

18
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,510
- Yes, sir. 
 - Why?

19
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:12,750
I remembered the conversation we had before.

20
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:18,100
- About what? 
 - Your goal to build a strong Republic of Korea.

21
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,760
Yes, that's what I'm always doing.

22
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,980
Chief Prosecutor's goal is to create a strong prosecution.

23
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:29,410
I also heard that from him often. What about it?

24
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:34,660
Right now, I work under the orders of Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun.

25
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,890
So I've been contemplating it.

26
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:36,800
Contemplating?

27
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,360
A strong nation and a strong prosecution.

28
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,400
But you and the chief prosecutor can't coexist.

29
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,820
As for me,

30
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,410
I want to be on your side, sir.

31
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,890
What are you saying right now?

32
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,430
Bando Bank.

33
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:09,190
Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun ordered me to conduct a secret investigation.

34
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:12,850
Excessive loans to insolvent companies and extension of the deadline for repayment

35
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,630
And illegal loans through homeless people.

36
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:21,240
Park Dae Ho owns 15% of the shares in the Cheonha Group, but in name only.

37
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,300
The real owner is you, sir.

38
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:31,030
Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun wants to put a leash on you.

39
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,260
What do you want to do?

40
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:41,710
So, what do you want to do with Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun?

41
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:45,240
I don't believe that's my concern.

42
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,330
I'm just a prosecutor.

43
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:50,310
Then can you cover up what you just told me?

44
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,390
I'll do that.

45
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:01,470
Then I'll take care of this.

46
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,360
Then I need to compensate you for this.

47
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,160
- What do you want? 
 - Sorry?

48
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,460
Feel free to tell me what position or place.

49
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:18,230
I’m giving you a chance to choose your future.

50
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:21,400
- Nothing. 
 - Is there nothing?

51
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,920
You betrayed Kim Seok Hun and came to me.

52
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,230
Wasn't it because you wanted something?

53
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:31,190
I didn't betray but only followed my convitions.

54
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,800
- Convictions? 
 - Yes, sir.

55
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,620
Yes, convictions.

56
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,700
I'm glad the country has a prosecutor like you.

57
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,020
If you ever need anything, come and see me.

58
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:52,360
The door will be open to you at any time.

59
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,670
Thank you.

60
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,920
Goodbye for now.

61
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,640
- Manager Han! 
 - Yes, sir.

62
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,130
- See him out. 
 - Yes, sir.

63
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,520
If you had told him what you wanted, he would have granted it.

64
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,740
There isn't anything like that.

65
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:34,070
- I’m curious what you're thinking.
 - Sorry?

66
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:41,120
You told me you woul'd keep your promise.

67
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,260
I'm curious as to what that is.

68
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:46,460
- Before I answer, I have a question. 
 - For me?

69
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,080
While investigating Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop under the chief prosecutor's orders,

70
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,600
I looked into you as well.

71
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:57,410
But I didn't find anything on you.

72
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:01,620
- You won't be able to investigate me.  
 - Is that so?

73
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:06,390
Saying something like that makes a prosecutor want to dig deeper.

74
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:10,510
If you can, do so.

75
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:14,070
I think it's time now to get my question answered.

76
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:19,630
I can't give you all the answers yet. Be patient a little longer.

77
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:23,450
The hour when I'll keep my promise is approaching.

78
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:27,450
What does that mean?

79
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,380
Thank you for seeing me off. Then, now ...

80
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:58,240
Kim Seok Hun finally showed who he is.

81
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,670
He is shortsighted.

82
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:07,420
Just because of the prosecutor general position, he's going to lose something bigger.

83
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,170
- Manager Kim. 
 - Yes, sir.

84
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:12,150
Keep an eye on Kim Seok Hun's every move

85
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,600
- and watch the Eastern District Prosecutors' Office. 
 - Eastern District Prosecutors' Office?

86
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,100
- If one moves, will the other stand still? 
 - Understood, sir.

87
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,320
- Manager Han. 
 - Yes, sir.

88
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,100
Doesn't Kim Hui Wu seem dangerous?

89
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,110
Look into him from start to finish.

90
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,660
Without missing anything, investigate thoroughly.

91
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,570
Yes, sir.

92
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:36,870
The Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office is investigating Bando Bank?

93
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:39,040
- Is Kim Seok Hun doing that? 
 - Yes, sir.

94
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,010
Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun wants to become the next prosecutor general.

95
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:46,950
He wants to use Bando Bank as a bargaining chip with Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop.

96
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,300
So, what do you need from me?

97
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:57,180
I'm going to leak information that the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office is investigating Bando Bank.

98
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,060
Leak?

99
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,180
- You want me to light the fuse? 
 - Yes, sir.

100
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,690
- In your name. 
 - Why?

101
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:13,260
If, rather than a leak, we hold a press conference, it won't just light the fuse,

102
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,790
but set the house on fire.

103
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:18,390
But last time, it backfired.

104
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,970
We tried to blow up the issue,

105
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:23,510
but Assemblyman Jo became more powerful and stronger.

106
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,670
Also, Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop has

107
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:31,330
enough power and resources to distract the public no matter how we try to expose him.

108
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,090
That's true.

109
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,820
That’s why the goal of my plan this time

110
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:42,480
is to break the alliance between Jo Tae Seop and Kim Seok Hun.

111
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,770
- Break the alliance? 
 - Yes, sir.

112
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,640
Bando Bank and

113
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,490
Kim Seok Hun and Jo Tae Seop.

114
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:53,140
If it goes as planned, they'll be attacking each other like in some melodrama.

115
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,880
But then again,

116
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,550
people love melodramas.

117
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,810
I'm asking for your help.

118
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,940
Fine.

119
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:18,880
 But don't forget that your opponent is Jo Tae Seop. You will have to have a plan B 

120
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,320
 and be more prepared. 

121
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,440
 Yes, sir. Of course. 

122
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:31,600
- Kim Hui Wu. 
 - Hi.

123
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:36,010
What's it? What happened that you came all the way here to see me?

124
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:39,000
- Let's talk.  
- You're making me excited.

125
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:48,770
What is it? You said you wanted to talk.

126
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:52,310
I'm going to catch a really bad guy.

127
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:55,430
But it could cause my friend to suffer some damage.

128
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,450
- A nice friend? 
 - Yeah.

129
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,730
You're talking about Kim Seok Hun, right?

130
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,650
How did you know?

131
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:06,820
Before I came out to see you, Ajeossi Hwang Jin Yong called me.

132
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,100
And I got a rough idea, too.

133
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:13,760
Hey, how can you let me hear something that concerns me from Ajeossi?

134
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,820
I'm sorry.

135
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:20,360
It could make things really hard for you.

136
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:24,230
I can see the headlines in my head.

137
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:28,890
"The suspicion of Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun's extramarital affairs revealed to be true"

138
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,820
I'll try to block it as much as I can.

139
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:35,690
But I wanted you to be prepared, at least.

140
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:39,490
Don’t worry. Just promise me one thing.

141
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,590
Come on.

142
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:50,310
Take him down for good. If you don't, I'll never see you again.

143
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:54,090
Okay.

144
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:58,260
Also, this is my job. I will support you.

145
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,910
- Hey, Kim Han Mi! 
 - I'm leaving.

146
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:22,280
  - Keep an eye on Kim Hui Wu. 
 - Hui Wu?  

147
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,040
Yeah. I told him to take care of something.

148
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,890
But Kim Hui Wu, that punk,

149
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:32,740
doesn't report back to me but gives me notice. He did the same thing with Gimsan and Jang Il Hyeon.

150
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,870
He's like a runaway train with faulty brakes.

151
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:41,150
We have to help him brake at the critical moment. Can you do it?

152
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,550
Yes, sir.

153
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:46,650
I'll promise. If all goes well this time,

154
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:50,960
I’ll have your father released.

155
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:02,230
- Are you clocking out now? 
 - Yes.

156
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,740
How about we get some drinks?

157
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,880
Sorry.  I have an appointment.

158
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,880
Gee, you're always so busy.  Take it easy.

159
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,270
I will.  Then ...

160
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,940
Okay.

161
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,190
Right now. Follow him.

162
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:56,750
- You're here? 
 - Yes.

163
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:01,490
- Did everybody come? 
 - Yeah. Even the woman warrior.

164
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:06,400
But I have a tail.

165
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,740
- Shadowed a prosecutor?
 - Yes.

166
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:13,000
I don't know what kind of guy he is, but he's foolhardy.

167
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,580
Should I grab him?

168
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:18,700
No, pretend you don't know and just keep an eye on him.

169
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,590
We need to find out who ordered him.

170
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:31,810
Here.

171
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,130
What is this?

172
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:39,290
A present. I wanted to wrap it beautifully, but this time you should put the ribbon on it yourself.

173
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:40,790
 Internal Investigation Report on JQ Construction 

174
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:43,670
- JQ Construction? 
 - Yeah.

175
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,990
 JQ Construction is owned by Kim Seok Hun's wife's family.  

176
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:54,110
If this gets out, it would deal a fatal blow to Kim Seok Hun's ambition to become the next prosecutor general.

177
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:57,680
At the same time, it will be good for his opponent Prosecutor Yun Jong Gi.

178
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:02,490
Hey, if this is done right, we can uproot everything evil that is embedded there in one move.

179
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:06,450
It doesn't matter if you uproot the evil.  It is opposing Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun.

180
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:08,450
What's wrong with opposing the chief prosecutor?

181
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:12,680
Yes.  Whoever it is who violates the law should be caught.

182
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,690
We are prosecutors.

183
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:17,720
Let's catch him.

184
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,520
I knew you were a woman warrior.

185
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,740
Punk, to your seonbae ...

186
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,220
Keep it under cover for now.  I'll tell you when to expose it.

187
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:31,110
Okay.  For now I will do a confirming investigation with Prosecutor Gu.

188
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:34,210
We have a great sauce so we should cook it perfectly.

189
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:35,910
Okay.

190
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:40,120
This is the intel on Kim Hui Wu.

191
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,900
What do you think, can we trust him?

192
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:47,090
That's something you should decide on your own.

193
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:50,980
 Kim Hui Wu Resumé 

194
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:56,030
His father was the witness at the scene of Hyeon Seok's accident?

195
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,170
Yes.

196
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:59,680
What a strange coincidence.

197
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:05,040
Anyway, this guy was under Kim Seok Hun

198
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,740
and attached himself to me like a bat. Why did he do that?

199
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:13,320
From the circumstantial evidence and what the head of the training center when Kim was there said,

200
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:17,950
I think Kim is working on behalf of Prosecutor Jeon Seok Gyu.

201
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:23,740
That's a valid point. It didn't make sense for the first place trainee at the center to apply for a provincial office.

202
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:29,410
Yes. I think the design was that he and Jeon Seok Gyu would come to Seoul together.

203
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:33,760
Yes, Kim Hui Wu is not  Kim Seok Hun's person.

204
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,950
From the start, he has worked to bring Jeon Seok Gyu back to Seoul.

205
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:39,620
And to bring down Kim Seok Hun,

206
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,750
he is trying to use me.

207
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,810
What should I do?

208
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:48,370
Shall I do what he wants?

209
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:53,190
Or should I make him pay for trying to use me?

210
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,540
Shrewd bastard.

211
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,060
Central District Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun?

212
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:22,530
- Why? 
 - This is a bit ...

213
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:27,100
What's the matter with you? Let's not be like this among pros.  You've released even worse.

214
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,550
The office is a phantom and there's an overseas server.

215
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:35,570
The most important is that the source is Assemblyman Hwang.

216
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:39,740
What's the catch? Is price a problem?

217
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,580
Deal?

218
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:52,420
 Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu 

219
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,290
- Yes? 
 - I threw the bait.

220
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:01,270
Did you? Good job.

221
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:12,100
 Jo Tae Seop.  You'll have no other choice but to come to me. 

222
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,180
Sir, this is an urgent report we just got in.

223
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,510
Tell me.

224
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:20,900
It's the content of a tabloid article that will be uploaded tomorrow.

225
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:25,780
- The Central District Prosecutors' Office is investigating Bando Bank? 
 - Yes.

226
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,370
So it's true that Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu has been investigating this.

227
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:32,910
For now, I've muffled the tabloid reporter's mouth, but the problem is the source is Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong.

228
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:37,300
If he knows, the problem is rather serious.

229
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:41,240
It could be hard for me to block it on my own.

230
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,900
- Summon Kim Hui Wu. 
 - I will.

231
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,460
 Han Ji Hyeon. 

232
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,870
 It's Han Ji Hyeon. 

233
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:14,220
I was expecting your call.

234
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,830
You want me there right now?

235
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,280
 What? 

236
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:20,150
Yes.

237
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:30,280
Sir, Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu is here.

238
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,550
Welcome.

239
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,940
You're a gifted prosecutor.

240
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:53,040
You're a promising prosecutor who can grow even greater in the future.

241
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:57,010
I'd like to give you an opportunity.

242
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:00,170
Take Kim Seok Hun down.

243
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,950
I'll help you.

244
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:08,130
 Help me?  But you won't accept responsibility... 

245
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:12,150
To what extent will you help me?

246
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:17,750
I won't let anyone interfere with you while you are carrying out the task.

247
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,610
Thank you, sir.

248
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:26,020
It's not going to be easy.

249
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:29,010
I am only following the orders given to me.

250
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:33,070
- First, look into JQ Construction. 
 - I'm already doing that.

251
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:37,770
Are you? Great. Did you find anything?

252
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:43,090
Yes. However, it requires more time to confirm.

253
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:46,580
Of course, with your assistance, I could shorten the time.

254
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:50,000
My help?  What is it?

255
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:54,240
I need your secretary.

256
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,950
- Manager Han? 
 - Yes.

257
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:01,090
She has never left my side.

258
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:03,750
What do you need my secretary for?

259
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:08,300
She just needs to show her face. She won't need to say a word.

260
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,340
What are you trying to accomplish with Manager Han?

261
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:14,360
I will show you through the result.

262
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:19,190
All right.  Well, I'll see it when the time comes.

263
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:25,100
I'll ask you again today.  What do you want?

264
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:30,570
- Nothing. 
 - There isn't anything this time either?

265
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:34,710
No.  I'm not looking for a reward.

266
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:38,020
I'm only following my convictions.

267
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:42,260
- Manager Han. 
 - Yes, sir.

268
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,940
Help Prosecutor Kim.

269
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,550
Yes, sir.

270
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,670
   
Prisoner Number 5346 to the Interview Room 

271
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:05,910
Look at this punk. What are you doing here?

272
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:08,850
Why have you come, punk?

273
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:14,820
How many times has Kim Seok Hun come here?

274
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:18,770
Naturally, he would not have phoned.

275
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,630
You've been abandoned. Completely.

276
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:28,070
And you will stay.  Right here.

277
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:30,870
Hey, Punk. Did you come to fan the fire?

278
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:34,220
That fire, I came to put it out.

279
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,750
What?

280
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,960
- Let's make a deal. 
 - A deal?

281
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,240
There's a way to reduce your sentence.

282
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,440
What bullshit is that, punk?

283
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,450
Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop.

284
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:56,320
I'm working for him now.

285
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:06,740
He's ordered me to bring Kim Seok Hun down.

286
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:15,570
Hey. Don't go overboard with your lies. Are you kidding?

287
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:18,750
You're daring to claim to be in a position I could never attain?

288
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,530
Yes.

289
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:25,950
So please tell me about Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun's corruption.

290
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:30,880
What an amateur. Corruption is something only bastards like me commit.

291
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,370
Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun doesn't need things like that. Don't you know his wife's family is JQ?

292
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:36,410
That JQ is all I need.

293
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:39,380
When JQ Construction bought the land in Gusan City,

294
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:43,120
there was a report that you were involved.

295
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,880
Then prove that you're the assemblyman's person first.

296
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,940
So that I can believe it.

297
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,610
Please come in.

298
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:16,600
 Record 

299
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:21,930
Everything that you say here can be used as evidence.

300
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:23,970
Do you agree to it?

301
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,190
Yes. I agree.

302
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:32,280
Please tell us.

303
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:38,100
JQ Construction won an unfair bid on the purchase price of land in Gusan City,

304
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:41,120
which was much lower than market value in the vicinity.

305
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,090
Is there any evidence for that?

306
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,880
There isn't.

307
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:49,950
Not with me.

308
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,690
But JQ's Executive Director Shin Dae Wung will probably have proof.

309
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:57,300
JQ's old-timer, in the position of executive director.

310
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:00,570
He's also the architect of the crooked purchase of the land in Gusan City.

311
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:10,130
All right. I'll stop recording now.

312
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:16,210
Thank you for your hard work.

313
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:21,290
Hey, Kim Hui Wu. Let me ask one question.

314
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:26,640
Since when did you betray me?  Bastard, was it from the very beginning?

315
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:32,180
Never mind. Make sure to keep your word.

316
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:36,310
Are you positive you can reduce my sentence?

317
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:39,880
Yes.  I keep my word.

318
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:59,790
 Central Detention Center 
 Maintaining Public Well-Being and Order 

319
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:08,410
It's a present for the assemblyman.

320
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:11,060
I hope he likes it.

321
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:15,210
I really didn't say a word, did I?

322
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:18,980
Should I ask the assemblyman to reduce Jang Il Hyeon's sentence a little?

323
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:22,930
A promise is a promise, so maybe about a month?

324
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:25,780
Please ask him for me.

325
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,430
Good-bye for now.

326
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:50,220
Kim Hui Wu met Jang Il Hyeon with Manager Han?

327
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,220
Were you still here?

328
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,750
Yeah.

329
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:06,870
Yes, Chief Prosecutor.

330
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:11,080
 I want to hear an interim report on the Bando Bank investigation. 

331
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:14,140
Yes, I'll come right now.

332
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:36,380
Park Dae Ho runs separate organizations that employ foreigners and don't share information.

333
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:39,710
We have secured a list of the homeless in need of illegal loans.

334
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:43,910
- Foreigners? 
 - Yes. If something goes wrong, it's hard to trace.

335
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:49,590
So Bando Bank made illegal loans to homeless people.

336
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:52,120
And the money went straight into Park Dae Ho's back pocket.

337
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,810
The situation is still ongoing. I've only checked the list.

338
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:58,250
The situation is also a fact.

339
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:03,940
We will be unbeatable if we go together wielding swords.

340
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,920
Thank you.

341
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,400
- Do you have plans later? 
 - No, nothing at all.

342
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:11,520
Let's have dinner.

343
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,490
Yes.  Let's do that.

344
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,930
The size of the home care market is growing daily.

345
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:29,020
We need a unique technology that can dominate this global market.

346
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,140
What is the special feature of the products that will be launched this time?

347
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:35,940
Yes, it's been made to be used conveniently after considering the consumer's ease.

348
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,630
We can use it easily.

349
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:41,170
Yes, would you like to try using it yourself?

350
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:42,880
I'll do that.

351
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:56,670
Then, it'll become very easy to take care of one's skin at home.

352
00:29:56,670 --> 00:30:01,510
That's good. Please hurry the product launch. I'll tell the  related design.

353
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:07,330
And, going forward, I hope you will submit overall reports regarding product development directly to me.

354
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:09,220
Then, let's end today's meeting here.

355
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,600
Thank you for your effort.

356
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,760
Thank you for your effort.

357
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,220
General Manager.

358
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,850
What is it?

359
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:40,620
This is the status report on stocks that was just uploaded on the FSC and KRX websites.

360
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:45,190
JQ Constructions' Managing Director Kim Yeong Il suddenly bought a huge block of Cheonha Holdings' shares.

361
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:48,460
What is this? 5%?

362
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,090
Yes.

363
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:54,460
But JQ Constructions lacks funding. Who is their source?

364
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:57,700
It's been revealed that they received the loan from Bando Bank.

365
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,740
Bando Bank?

366
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:08,190
If they purchased shares through a loan from Bando Bank, I'm sure they're not on our side.

367
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:10,960
CEO Park Dae Ho's shares are 15%

368
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:15,820
If even the 5% share here that JQ Construction has taken goes into CEO Park Dae Ho's hands,

369
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:19,100
then my brothers and I would be unable to prevent their right to management.

370
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:24,520
While investigating, we detected a few places where Bando Bank made illegal loans for JQ Construction.

371
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,110
How about exposing that?

372
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:34,660
No, for us to expose it, the risk is too big. It's also work that prosecutors should do.

373
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:38,130
Manager Park, please organize the material on everything we have gathered so far.

374
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,650
Yes.

375
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:57,150
 Hui Wu 

376
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:05,130
Aren't there many places to eat in Seochodong too?

377
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:07,300
Why? Do you find it burdensome to go far?

378
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:12,560
Or is it strange that I am driving without even a driver?

379
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,680
It's both.

380
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:18,250
It's because it's a difficult and an important get-together.

381
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:22,890
Do you know what I want to do if I become Prosecutor General?

382
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:25,800
Isn't it to make the prosecutor's office strong?

383
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:31,040
More specifically, a prosecutor's office that does not get jerked around by politics.

384
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:34,880
However, in order to get that kind of power,

385
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,410
the reality is that there's no other way but to collude with politics.

386
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:51,840
You've met Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop before, right?

387
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,950
Yes.

388
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:57,010
It seems he thought well of you. He told us to come together.

389
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:03,050
Don't speak until you meet him.

390
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,090
 What is this? 

391
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:10,470
 Have I been caught in Jo Tae Seop's and Kim Seok Hun's snare? 

392
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,520
He's waiting.

393
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:37,660
It's been a while.

394
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:48,720
According to the Chief Prosecutor, you've been very busy due to the case you've taken on recently.

395
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,910
What kind of case is it?

396
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:59,560
 If I tell the truth, Kim Seok Hun will strike me, and if I lie, Jo Tae Seop will. 

397
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,030
Speak comfortably.

398
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:04,810
 I can't lie. Then... 

399
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:12,630
I apologize. While I respect you, sir,

400
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:17,040
because it is a matter related to a prosecutor's duties, I cannot speak of it with outsiders.

401
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,890
Aigoo, I... I have asked an onerous question.

402
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:23,080
Haven't I, Chief Prosecutor?

403
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,710
Yes.

404
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:31,590
The reason I asked you two is that I wanted to see Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu.

405
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:37,590
This prosecutor who will lead the prosecutors' future, what kind of person, how he'd express himself...

406
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:41,130
I wanted to offer a glass of this drink too.

407
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:51,520
I know how you feel. I must seem heartless.

408
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:56,500
You must be thinking that I'm weighing between you and Chief Prosecutor Yun Jong Gi.

409
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:01,130
It's been difficult recommending you to both parties.

410
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:03,640
Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong's side is particularly a problem.

411
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:08,320
You know. That I have no way of manipulating that side.

412
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,530
Assemblyman, if that's the case, how about we entrust Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong to Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu?

413
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:18,940
 Was it this? They called me to get Assemblyman Hwang? 

414
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,740
Don't underestimate Hwang Jin Yong.

415
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:25,390
I also had a number of opportunities when I could have stripped Hwang Jin Yong of his position, but I bided my time.

416
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:29,220
Since an immoderate attack has a way of creating cracks in me too.

417
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,850
Yes, sir.

418
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:35,190
He's a man who has stood firm all this time on this harsh political field.

419
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:39,410
If you are to oppose Hwang Jin Yong, you'll need to build more experience.

420
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:41,590
I'll consider it more seriously.

421
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:47,630
But I think he will come in quite useful when it comes to taking down small fry.

422
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:53,490
What do you say? Do you think you're up for the task?

423
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:57,120
 He's calling Kim Seok Hoon small fry. 

424
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,870
 It's Jo Tae Seop's intent to discard him. 

425
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:01,870
Yes, I'll catch him.

426
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:03,650
Here.

427
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:07,990
You too should have a glass.

428
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:25,550
- You did a good job, even though it must have been difficult for you. 
- Not at all.

429
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:30,420
It's not much longer. We must launch a new era for prosecutors.

430
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:33,760
Prosecutors who don't get jerked around by politics.

431
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,500
The era of just and upright prosecutors who see only the law.

432
00:36:54,990 --> 00:37:00,280
 That's not something to be said by a person who's trying to become the prosecutor general by flattering politicians. 

433
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:14,080
The assemblyman asked for you.

434
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:29,080
- Did you have enough to drink?
 - Yes.

435
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,320
Your mask is better than I thought.

436
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,960
Were you testing me?

437
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,710
Yes, I tested you.

438
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,700
I was curious

439
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:47,580
as to what face you'd present when Kim Seok Hun and I were in the same place.

440
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:51,700
You answered as I'd expected. I like it.

441
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:56,560
I heard from Manager Han about where you went.

442
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,480
How is the work progressing? Well?

443
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,450
Yes.

444
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:03,570
You'll need to move carefully.

445
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:07,400
Kim Seok Hun catches on more quickly than you think.

446
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,260
I understand.

447
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:13,190
Ta-da.

448
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:15,010
While Hui Wu's on his way, could you taste this?

449
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:18,930
It's a new dish we developed, but I don't know if it'll be to young people's taste.

450
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:22,450
Gyu Ri, you like Western food, don't you? I wondered if Western food and steamed chicken

451
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:25,010
couldn't become friends and tried making this.

452
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:29,750
I named it, "Dominate the World, Jjimdak". Don't hold back on your comments.

453
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:32,970
Thank you, sir. It looks delicious.

454
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:43,290
The sauce and the steamed chicken blend together well.

455
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:47,120
Dear, dear! I have a good feeling this time too!

456
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,360
The last menu item  Gyu Ri praised became a hit too.

457
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,990
You and I seem to get each other in some way.

458
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:55,330
While I can't cook, my sense of taste lives on.

459
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:59,280
The world is full of delicious food. It's not a problem that you can't cook, sweetie.

460
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,650
Anyone watching might think Seonbae (Gyu Ri) is your daughter-in-law.

461
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:05,400
Really? I wanted to be seen as a daughter.

462
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:10,220
Honestly, we need a daughter and a daughter-in-law too. Do you have any interest in our Hui Wu?

463
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:14,870
Even though Hui Wu may seem blunt, when you take a good look at him, he's tender, kind, and alright.

464
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:20,090
- Don't worry. Gyu Ri likes Hui Wu.
- Hey, Gu Seung Hyeok!

465
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:22,950
Ah, liking someone is not something to be embarrassed about. Like him all you want.

466
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:26,190
Continue to like him. Nonstop. On and on and on.

467
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:28,710
Thank you. Father. Mom.

468
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:30,440
-I'm back.
 - Come in.

469
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,120
One came in.

470
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,700
Right, I'll prepare five servings of steamed chicken.

471
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,760
- Hey, you waited a long time, didn't you? 
 - No.

472
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,260
What do you mean we haven't waited long? An hour and a half has passed.

473
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:46,650
But what about you, Seonbae Min Su?

474
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:49,520
I came together so I could make an alibi for Hui Wu.

475
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,860
Alibi?

476
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:54,620
With just the three of you, people will think you're conspiring. But if I'm here, it becomes a friendly gathering.

477
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:57,580
What's going on? Are you being followed?

478
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:00,350
Yes. But don't worry.

479
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:04,160
We can talk comfortably today thanks to Min Su.

480
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:10,130
Here. I'll offer this as my fine for being late.

481
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,910
- Jang Il Hyeon's confession. 
- What?

482
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:18,620
In order to forget the pain of Jeon Il Bo, I've already taken it upon myself

483
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:20,780
to investigate Executive Director Shin Dae Yong.

484
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:24,100
Please take extreme caution so that our paths don't overlap.

485
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,460
Yes, Seonbae.

486
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:29,460
But the more I dig into this, the bigger it gets.

487
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,950
I think JQ Construction will collapse.

488
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:36,140
No, it won't. Only their higher-ups will change.

489
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:39,320
From a scumbag to a clean one.

490
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,340
- Park Sang Man. 
 - What's up?

491
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:50,940
You graduated at the top in computer science from Hanguk University.

492
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,850
You were on scholarship for four years.

493
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:57,070
You received job offers from large domestic and foreign corporations, but you rejected them all.

494
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:59,990
Are you just recognizing my value?

495
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:04,110
Why do I have such a competent person?

496
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:06,600
Do I have to say it?

497
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,530
What is it?  Tell me.

498
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:10,810
Because I like you so much.

499
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,850
Thanks.

500
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:16,000
I'm more thankful to you.

501
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,800
You got my father off from the false charges.

502
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:29,200
Then ...  shall we start something more suited to your specialty now?

503
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:32,350
What's that?

504
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,200
Make a proper company.

505
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,810
Make a company?

506
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:40,610
Yes.  As an investment.

507
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,940
Come on. I've never ever worked for a company.

508
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:47,220
Good. You can start now then.  As the CEO.

509
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:49,920
CEO?  Are you serious?

510
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:55,190
You are taking over JQ Construction.   Starting now, buy its stock whenever you can.

511
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,600
Hyeong, are you nuts? Do you really want me to run the company?

512
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:01,720
Yeah. Your minor was business management, wasn't it?

513
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,880
You had very good grades

514
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:07,280
and you like playing business games.

515
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:12,330
The thing is ... are studying and playing games the same as the real thing?

516
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:17,400
They are different. Reality might be easier, especially for you.

517
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:18,660
Hyeong.

518
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,890
Start getting ready to take over.

519
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,140
CEO?

520
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,090
Get ready to take over?

521
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:36,790
Kim Seok Hun will disappear soon and JQ Construction will collapse.

522
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:42,600
The financial structure of JQ Construction is poor, but not so much that it'll become a problem.

523
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:46,090
- If DH money succeeds in taking it over— 
 - But that is —

524
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:48,120
Why? Is there a problem?

525
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,320
- That is— 
 - Say it.

526
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:56,460
If the prosecutor starts to investigate JQ Construction, we will be in trouble.

527
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:58,000
What do you mean by trouble?

528
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:04,010
I heard that Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun was your man and gave his son...

529
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:07,480
A loan.  An illegal one.

530
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,180
Yes.

531
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:12,250
Why did you?

532
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:17,390
It wasn't easy to find someone to hold on to a large block of Cheonha Holding Company stock.

533
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:21,410
If we placed the stock with a less wealthy person, his source of funds would be immediately traced.

534
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:24,810
Even I couldn't come forward so I used Kim Yeong Il because of the situation.

535
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:27,650
Without even reporting to me?!

536
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:31,850
I deserve to die.  The situation was so urgent.

537
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:36,070
That side needed money and we needed a strawman to hold title.

538
00:43:36,070 --> 00:43:42,670
I thought it was a great opportunity for him to secure a 5% share of the Cheonha Holding shares on the market.

539
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:44,560
This really...

540
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:50,830
The total amount of the loans is 700 billion.  Of that, 500 billion went to Kim Yeong Il.

541
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:51,990
How did he use them?

542
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:55,760
As Director Park Dae Ho said, he bought shares of Cheonha Holding Company and—

543
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,700
There's more?

544
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:01,730
Yes.  We have determined that it was used in the purchase of his apartment.

545
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:08,830
When the investigation begins we cannot predict the extent of the fallout.

546
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,670
I thought I said you didn't need to know.

547
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:19,130
Still, I need to know what case Kim Hui Wu is investigating.

548
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:21,400
I'm looking for the common thread in his different actions, but for now—

549
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,280
There's nothing special in Kim Hui Wu's activity, is there?

550
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,910
No.

551
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:31,020
Okay.  For the time being, keep a close eye on him.

552
00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:55,210
Kim Hui Wu.

553
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:02,250
Let's chat.

554
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:19,420
 They didn't exceed expectations. 

555
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:22,600
What is this?

556
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:26,810
I tailed you a little.

557
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:29,970
Don't be offended. Let's not get emotional.

558
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:32,560
When we are ordered to reveal something, we reveal it because we are prosecutors.

559
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:33,360
So what?

560
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:36,950
Who told you to meet Seonbae Jang Il Hyeon with Manager Han?

561
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:41,620
The chief prosecutor's order? If not, the assemblyman?

562
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:47,380
I'll ask a question first. Tailing me,

563
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:51,590
was it the chief prosecutor's order or if not, of your own volition?

564
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:53,880
Chief Prosecutor's order.

565
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:01,060
This time, it's me.

566
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:06,280
After staking down Seonbae Jang Il Hyeon, he must be thinking of taking me down this time.

567
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:08,920
Then who will be next?

568
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:14,370
Don't you know?  The chief prosecutor does not intend to take you or me with him to the prosecutor general's office.

569
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:15,920
It must be a liability for him, right?

570
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,390
That his right-hand hoobaes  (juniors)  are stained with corruption.

571
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:21,900
He must have thought he had to cut us off before he moves up to the prosecutor general's office

572
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:26,190
so that he could become a fine prosecutor general.

573
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:30,950
So who ordered you to meet Jang Il Hyeon?

574
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:33,620
Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop.

575
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:47,130
Don't waste your time chasing my tail.  Stand in line well.

576
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:50,050
It's up to you to judge.

577
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:55,780
Then, I'll be leaving now.

578
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:23,450
What do you mean there is a case you want to request?

579
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:27,270
These are Cheonha files.

580
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:32,320
 Report on Holders of Large Blocks of Cheonha Holdings Stock 

581
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:36,270
Coveting Cheonha.   Kim Yeong Il's greed is  extraordinary.

582
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:40,210
He has taken a 5% stake in Cheonha Holdings.

583
00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:46,420
He looked for an opening while you and your siblings were frantic after the chairman died.

584
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:50,620
If not now, there won't be an opportunity to get shares in our group.

585
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:53,860
But where did Kim Yeong Il get the money?

586
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:57,270
JQ Construction that I investigated is having a liquidity crisis.  (That is, being short of money.) 

587
00:47:57,270 --> 00:48:00,910
From Bando Bank. It was a preferential loan.

588
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:03,890
If you analyze documents and accounting data related to the bank's investment business,

589
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:08,490
you'll find evidence of poor screening during the processing of the loan.

590
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:12,700
The loan is of a magnitude which is difficult to obtain with JQ Construction's poor credit rating.

591
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:14,520
Right.

592
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:18,040
Thanks, Kim Hui Ah.

593
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:20,790
- Do you mean it? 
 - Yeah.

594
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:24,350
This is information I needed.

595
00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:28,330
That's fortunate. I wondered if I was pressuring you.

596
00:48:28,330 --> 00:48:30,080
Even though I know the truth—

597
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:34,230
You have no authority to punish.  That's why you looked for me.

598
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:36,380
Yes.

599
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:37,860
I'll make good use of it.

600
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:42,070
You'll soon learn how helpful you've been.

601
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:47,340
Oh, I've got to get going.  See you later.

602
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:49,040
Yes.

603
00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:02,790
Are you saying Bando Bank and JQ Engineering &amp; Construction are connected?

604
00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:04,310
Yes.

605
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:09,260
My heart is pounding. Look at this case growing bigger.

606
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:14,250
He was trying to use Bando Bank as a springboard for his career but it got entangled with his son.

607
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:16,230
It's a royal backfire.

608
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:18,610
Kim Seok Hun must be in shock.

609
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:21,390
He probably didn't know.

610
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:25,840
The issue is what will Jo Tae Seop's next move be?

611
00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:35,320
 Manager Han Ji Hyeon 

612
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:40,460
 Stop the investigation of JQ Construction. 

613
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:43,790
- What? 
 - It's the Assemblyman's instruction.

614
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:45,970
I understand.

615
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:49,980
He said that he will not forget

616
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:52,510
 how hard you have worked all of this time. 

617
00:49:52,510 --> 00:49:54,180
Yes.

618
00:49:56,710 --> 00:49:58,800
I told him.

619
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,930
How did he respond?

620
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:02,210
He was calm.

621
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:05,850
Calm? Without asking why?

622
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:07,610
Yes.

623
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:13,730
You were calm?

624
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:15,390
As expected, the investigation was stopped.

625
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:20,050
But it's not over until it's over.

626
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:24,060
He's a little late.  It's about time he arrived.

627
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:25,730
Who's coming?

628
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:27,440
I brought the homework.

629
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,990
You came?

630
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:33,200
Why are you so surprised? Have I come where I shouldn't have?

631
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,110
Here. A recording of the confession of Sin Dae Wung,

632
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:40,200
the architect of corruption in Gusan City.

633
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:43,990
Good job, Seonbaenim.

634
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:49,200
From now, it's time for Department head and Seonbae Ji who have been working hard,

635
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:53,290
and the friends who were quietly sharpening their knives,

636
00:50:53,290 --> 00:50:55,650
to see the light.

637
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:08,290
Gyu Ri, I'm sending you a recording of Sin Dae Wung's confession.  Verify it and

638
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:11,890
release it.

639
00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:14,170
Welcome, Prosecutor Kim. 
  Eastern District Prosecutor's Office. 

640
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:17,830
Did you and Prosecutor Gu bring this?  Report of the Internal Investigation of JQ Construction 

641
00:51:17,830 --> 00:51:19,940
Yes, that's correct.

642
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:22,850
I think there should be more prosecutors like you.

643
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:26,910
Then, the public can trust us.

644
00:51:29,110 --> 00:51:33,550
Can you finish by yourself what you started?

645
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:35,630
Yes. Of course.

646
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:37,260
Then, get started.

647
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:40,520
The whole investigation process should be reported directly to me.

648
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:42,700
I will, Chief Prosecutor.

649
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:44,380
What?

650
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:46,690
Do you know who I am?

651
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:51,420
Kim Yeong Il, son of Kim Seok Hun, chief of the Central District Prosecutor Office,  and third generation chaebol.

652
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:55,150
Still a witness,  soon to be a suspect.

653
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:59,870
The law is equal for everyone.

654
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:01,770
Assemblyman.

655
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:03,140
Is something the matter?

656
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:06,640
The Eastern District Prosecutors' Office just arrested Kim Yeong Il, managing director of JQ Construction

657
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:10,370
- What are the charges? 
 - Illegal loans and a rigged bid on land.

658
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:16,370
- Call Yun Jong Gi. 
 - Yes.

659
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:18,160
Okay.

660
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:23,060
Kim Yeong Il was arrested.

661
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:26,260
The warrant will be issued soon, right?

662
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:29,240
Isn't that risky?  To the Eastern District Prosecutor's Office.

663
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:32,760
When JQ's loan issue is revealed, Park Dae Ho will appear.

664
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:36,420
Right.  Park Dae Ho used to be a gangster.

665
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:39,410
They will be fine.

666
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:41,990
 - Yeon Seok.
 - Yes. 

667
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:45,330
 Starting tomorrow, you should become Gyu Ri and Seung Hyeok's guard. Without anyone knowing. 

668
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:46,830
 I will. 

669
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:50,230
 If anything dangerous happens, call me right away. 

670
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:51,830
  Yes. 

671
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:07,480
That jerk, Yun Jong Gi!

672
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:15,090
 Prosecution Service 

673
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:24,940
 Manager Han Ji Hyeon 

674
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:31,050
 The receiver cannot be reached. You will be directed to voicemail. 

675
00:53:37,490 --> 00:53:39,960
The timing isn't ideal.

676
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:43,600
Release Kim Yeong Il of JQ Constructions.

677
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:48,800
Why? Are you upset?

678
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,670
Well.

679
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:53,710
It's not exactly a nice feeling.

680
00:53:53,710 --> 00:53:58,220
Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun is lacking to be the leader of the prosecutors.

681
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:01,080
That's not up to you to decide.

682
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:09,590
Please take a look and make your decision.

683
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:17,870
 Investigation Report on Suspicions in JQ Construction 

684
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:24,090
This matter is too serious to cover up. According to the investigation, done by my prosecutors—

685
00:54:25,370 --> 00:54:26,940
- So what? 
- Pardon?

686
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:31,940
I didn't call you here to talk about the appointment of the prosecutor general.

687
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:34,480
I called you here regarding the JQ Constructions case.

688
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,820
Can't you see?

689
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:40,870
I don't like stubborn dogs.

690
00:54:42,010 --> 00:54:43,870
You can go now.

691
00:54:55,070 --> 00:54:57,510
It's all material you already know.

692
00:54:57,510 --> 00:55:02,280
Do you think Chief Prosecutor Yun will cover up the JQ Construction case?

693
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:05,230
He will. He doesn't have any other choice.

694
00:55:05,230 --> 00:55:08,960
The problem isn't the chief prosecutor. It's the two prosecutors in charge of the case.

695
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:13,580
They are very tenacious and don't compromise.

696
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:15,840
How noisy.

697
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:19,130
They are bothering me.

698
00:55:19,130 --> 00:55:21,360
I'll take care of them.

699
00:55:30,090 --> 00:55:32,420
Something is off.

700
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:40,910
Bando, JQ Construction, and Hwang Jin Yong. Now, Yun Jong Gi as well?

701
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:47,520
It's like someone is reading my moves ahead and getting in my way.

702
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:52,170
Should I go along?

703
00:55:52,170 --> 00:55:54,420
Or...

704
00:55:56,710 --> 00:55:58,860
Or...

705
00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:04,430
Stop the investigation?

706
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:06,530
Don't ask me anything.

707
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:07,610
Just do what I say.

708
00:56:07,610 --> 00:56:11,390
It's an order. Get out.

709
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:20,530
I'm sorry. But I'm a prosecutor.

710
00:56:20,530 --> 00:56:22,580
Kim Gyu Ri.

711
00:56:30,390 --> 00:56:31,520
What is this?

712
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,140
I need to be somewhere right now.

713
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:35,670
Are you crazy? Where do you think you're going after what just happened?

714
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:37,460
We have a witness.

715
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:40,270
- A witness? 
- It's a civil servant from the JQ Construction corruption case.

716
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:43,340
The witness kept dodging my calls, but now, the witness wants to meet.

717
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:45,850
The witness wants to testify.

718
00:56:45,850 --> 00:56:48,880
We can keep Kim Yeong Il here with the testimony.

719
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:50,510
Okay.

720
00:56:51,350 --> 00:56:54,470
I'll stall time here. Make sure to bring the witness here.

721
00:56:54,470 --> 00:56:55,940
Okay.

722
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:04,150
There he comes.

723
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:14,090
Yeon Seok, I'll follow Prosecutor Gu.

724
00:57:14,090 --> 00:57:16,170
You stay here and keep an eye on Gyu Ri.

725
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:17,870
Okay.

726
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:35,170
 Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu 

727
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:41,110
Hey, Sang Man.

728
00:57:41,110 --> 00:57:46,540
Huyng. I followed Prosecutor Gu's car here. But something is off.

729
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:47,490
What do you mean "off"?

730
00:57:47,490 --> 00:57:49,330
 We're in Gusan now. 

731
00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:51,220
This is an empty carpenter's shop.

732
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:54,040
Really? At this hour?

733
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:55,230
Yes.

734
00:57:55,230 --> 00:57:57,120
Okay.

735
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:16,450
Is this the right place?

736
00:58:18,630 --> 00:58:22,630
 The number you dialed does not exist. Please check and try again. 

737
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:24,850
Prosecutor Gu.

738
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:32,430
Who are you?

739
00:58:36,510 --> 00:58:39,980
Why don't you stop investigating the JQ Construction case?

740
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:40,750
What?

741
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:44,760
Telling me that you'll stop isn't so hard.

742
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:48,630
If you give me your word, I will let you go unharmed.

743
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:51,540
I won't listen to your nonsense. Do you think a thug can scare me?

744
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:53,000
A thug?

745
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,900
Do you think I'm a mere thug?

746
00:58:55,900 --> 00:59:02,050
I'll give you time to decide. You may die here.

747
00:59:02,050 --> 00:59:05,410
I hope you will make a wise decision.

748
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:13,790
 Hui Wu. A guy in a black suit is talking to Prosecutor Gu. 

749
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:41,130
Assemblyman.

750
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:53,540
I came here because I needed to sort things out.

751
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:56,380
Chief Prosecutor Kim, it's time to decide now.

752
00:59:56,380 --> 00:59:58,130
I'm sorry.

753
00:59:58,130 --> 01:00:00,820
If you made your decision, I will accept it without objections.

754
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:02,830
You'll accept it without objections?

755
01:00:02,830 --> 01:00:04,690
I will.

756
01:00:06,130 --> 01:00:09,190
- You take it. 
- Pardon?

757
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:11,330
The prosecutor general title.

758
01:00:11,330 --> 01:00:16,980
Your name will be engraved on the deskplate of the next prosecutor ceneral.

759
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:20,670
Don't worry about your son. I'll take care of it.

760
01:00:21,550 --> 01:00:24,190
Isn't this funny?

761
01:00:24,190 --> 01:00:29,780
I'm trying to help you. But you are trying to hold me back. You know?

762
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:32,000
Bando Bank.

763
01:00:34,410 --> 01:00:37,160
I would like to hear your excuse.

764
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,830
- Assemblyman.
 - Seok Hun.

765
01:00:41,150 --> 01:00:45,210
I hope this is the last time you ever test me.

766
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:49,110
Don't cross the line. I told you many times.

767
01:00:49,110 --> 01:00:52,530
I will let you reach your limit.

768
01:00:52,530 --> 01:00:56,750
Make sure I never have to repeat myself again.

769
01:00:58,170 --> 01:00:59,610
I'll keep that in mind.

770
01:00:59,610 --> 01:01:04,730
As of today, I will forget your past mistakes.

771
01:01:04,730 --> 01:01:09,030
But let's clear one thing up.

772
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:13,240
What do you think of Chief Prosecutor Yun Jong Gi?

773
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:18,280
Stabbing a colleague in the back to become the prosecutor general.

774
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:20,640
It is indeed ridiculous.

775
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:25,970
But Seok Hun, Yun Jong Gi is standing in the way of your future. You get rid of him.

776
01:01:26,710 --> 01:01:31,630
I will silence the mouth of the righteous prosecutor.

777
01:01:38,690 --> 01:01:40,450
This is your last chance.

778
01:01:40,450 --> 01:01:43,590
Tell me you will stop.

779
01:01:44,470 --> 01:01:47,790
What's the point of bringing justice and following the law?

780
01:01:47,790 --> 01:01:50,720
You need to live first.

781
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:53,200
If you can't speak, just nod your head.

782
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:54,670
Like a dog.

783
01:01:54,670 --> 01:01:59,790
What if I tell you I will stop the investigation,

784
01:01:59,790 --> 01:02:03,250
but I keep investigating the case?

785
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:05,070
It doesn't matter.

786
01:02:05,070 --> 01:02:09,900
A submissive dog isn't threatening.

787
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:16,330
Too bad. I'm not a dog. I'm a prosecutor.

788
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:23,590
That only leaves killing you.

789
01:02:26,990 --> 01:02:31,120
This is a perfect mixture of alcohol and methamphetamine.

790
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,620
Tomorrow morning,

791
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:35,780
the world will remember you as a corrupt and drug-addicted prosecutor

792
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:39,410
who committed suicide.

793
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:43,630
Hey.

794
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:50,370
You still haven't changed your playbook.

795
01:02:50,370 --> 01:02:53,550
That's too outdated. It's boring.

796
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:03,070
Who are you?

797
01:03:04,130 --> 01:03:05,850
Is that important right now?

798
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:08,940
I asked who you were.

799
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:12,290
Someone who knows you very well.

800
01:03:12,290 --> 01:03:14,330
Have we met before?

801
01:03:14,330 --> 01:03:16,690
Yes.

802
01:03:16,690 --> 01:03:21,480
And I died at your hands.

803
01:03:23,470 --> 01:03:27,250
You have mistaken me for someone else. I have never failed.

804
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:31,460
Right. You didn't fail.

805
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:34,660
I just resurrected like a miracle.

806
01:03:34,660 --> 01:03:40,590
I was gravely wronged and furious. So even death grazed past me.

807
01:03:40,590 --> 01:03:42,840
How funny.

808
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:45,600
Then I expect you to do the same again.

809
01:03:46,340 --> 01:03:49,110
Are you dense?

810
01:03:49,110 --> 01:03:54,160
If that was the case, I wouldn't have gotten involved. You jerk!

811
01:04:19,050 --> 01:04:25,990


812
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:32,060
♫  Dear, All your things you've done  ♫

813
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:35,220
♫  We are here to wreck it up  ♫

814
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:41,400
♫  Who knows, how will it go?  ♫

815
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:49,090
♫  Hiding in black and white  ♫

816
01:04:49,090 --> 01:04:52,390
♫  We are here to find the truth  ♫

817
01:04:52,390 --> 01:04:58,470
♫  Give up, I warn you so  ♫

818
01:04:58,470 --> 01:05:01,430
 Again My Life 

819
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:04,420
 "When the fight begins, think only about winning." 

820
01:05:04,420 --> 01:05:07,150
 I need to give a signal to Jo Tae Seop. 

821
01:05:07,150 --> 01:05:08,500
 You might be in danger. 

822
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:12,790
 Tell him that a rich lady wants to invest in JQ Construction and she's waiting for his call. 

823
01:05:12,790 --> 01:05:17,350
 Perhaps, that unidentified attacker could be working for you. 

824
01:05:17,350 --> 01:05:18,960
 Kim Seok Hun is the bait. 

825
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:22,560
 You crossed the line. 

826
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:27,030
 I'm the only one who can measure up to Kim Hui Wu. 

827
01:05:27,030 --> 01:05:29,100
 I won't go easy on you this time. 

828
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:32,220
♫  nowhere to hide  ♫

829
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:38,440
 Again My Life
