 Episode 9 

7
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,490
- You're here. 
 - Yes, sir.

8
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,690
- What's the matter? 
 - I've instructed Kim Hui Wu.

9
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,740
Jang Il Hyeon will be arrested soon.

10
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,050
Seonbae Jang?

11
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,750
Are you ditching him?

12
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,810
I'm just teaching him a lesson.

13
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,770
As you know, it would be a waste to let go of him that way.

14
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,930
We've known each other for a long time as well.

15
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,540
While he's reflecting on himself, there's something you need to do for me.

16
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:24,200
There's a big nuisance to deal with because of Mirae Electronics.

17
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,060
We need an offering to wash away our sins.

18
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,460
Get Jeon Seok Gyu.

19
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:38,970
We let him transfer to Seoul, but he's hiding his claws and waiting to show his true ambition.

20
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,660
From the fact that he's been investigating Jang Il Hyeon and Seong Jin Mi.

21
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:50,220
The fake company President Jeon Il Bo at Mirae Electronics set up

22
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,330
sent deposits to this borrowed-name account on a regular basis. Take this and—

23
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,270
I'll make sure it's found in Jeon Seok Gyu's possession.

24
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:57,970
- Do you think you can pull it off? 
 - Yes, sir.

25
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,230
This stays between us.

26
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,340
Proceed quietly.

27
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,090
Yes, sir.

28
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,970
- You're here. 
 - Yes.

29
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,120
So what's this about?

30
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:22,450
Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun ordered me to take down Jang Il Hyeon.

31
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:25,530
Kim Seok Hun wants to take down Jang Il Hyeon?

32
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:28,040
- He ordered you to do it? 
 - Yes.

33
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:34,940
Handing over his right-hand man to a close junior prosecutor of his...

34
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:38,940
Maybe he doesn't want to see Prosecutor Jang fall off the cliff.

35
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:43,390
He wants to put on a show. He doesn't intend to arrest him.

36
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,720
Right.

37
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,540
Then it means he needs someone to take the bullet instead of Jang Il Hyeon.

38
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:56,000
I feel like that person is...

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,990
No way!

40
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:00,010
No, it's very likely.

41
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:06,540
Since you dug the deepest into his right-hand man's dirty deeds.

42
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:10,400
Not a day goes by quietly in my life as a prosecutor.

43
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,460
I don't think Kim Seok Hun has any intention of arresting Jang Il Hyeon.

44
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:17,160
I bet he just wants to warn him.

45
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,320
But what can you do?

46
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,770
I've already received orders to arrest Jang Il Hyeon. Therefore,

47
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,450
I need to arrest him.

48
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,300
What's this?

49
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,150
Please take a look first, then we'll talk.

50
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,590
 Apartment Purchase Agreement 

51
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:46,360
You bought an apartment as a wedding gift for your eldest son.

52
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,040
- How did you get... 
 - Isn't it amazing?

53
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,170
No money left your bank account,

54
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:55,800
but an apartment in Gangnam fell from the sky.

55
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,850
I borrowed the money from a colleague.

56
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:04,070
- Do you think you can defeat a prosecutor of Korea by lying? 
 - What?

57
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,950
Please finish reading the rest of the pages.

58
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:13,550
How is it? Now that you've read it, you have your answer, right?

59
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:18,710
The subcontracting company of Hosan Chemicals paid both the down payment as well as the balance.

60
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,080
Aren't you curious now?

61
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:30,370
Why I came here in person instead of summoning you to the prosecutors' office?

62
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,030
Why do you think that is?

63
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,020
What do you want?

64
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,110
You know Prosecutor Jang Il Hyeon.

65
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:45,080
I need the deposit records of the bank account backed by Hosan.

66
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,410
Look, I heard that Prosecutor Jang Il Hyeon is

67
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:51,370
backed by the chief of the Central District Prosecutors' Office.

68
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:57,730
Right. I came here under the chief's orders,

69
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,550
so make sure you pick your side wisely.

70
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:09,120
I got it. Let's start.

71
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:27,100
 Again My Life 

72
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,490
Who are you guys?

73
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:33,170
I'm Prosecutor Ji Seong Ho of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

74
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:36,620
I'm executing a search warrant for your residence.

75
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,550
Get out right now!

76
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,300
Do you know who I am?

77
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,620
I know very well.

78
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,470
Seong Jin Mi, the chairwoman of the National Foundation for the Arts University.

79
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,680
We ask for your cooperation.

80
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,940
Come on. Let's get it done quickly!

81
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,310
Don't leave anything related to the foundation behind!

82
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:07,500
Il Hyeon, what's going on?

83
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,820
What?!

84
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:13,250
Okay. Just hold on. I'll take care of it.

85
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,880
I got it, I said. I told you I'll stop it!

86
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,210
So just wait.

87
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,670
Search and seizure of the National Foundation wasn't enough that

88
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:34,130
you're now cleaning out Seong Jin Mi's house?

89
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,570
Bravo.

90
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:45,420
I'll arrange a dinner meeting with the chief prosecutor this week.

91
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:48,200
So make a promise.

92
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,170
Promise?

93
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:55,810
The National Foundation for the Arts University and I

94
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:58,470
have nothing to do with each other. Also,

95
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:03,210
if you're looking to take sides, you'll have to draw a clear line.

96
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,300
I know nothing about the National Foundation.

97
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,370
You'll find out soon enough, but Seong Jin Mi?

98
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:12,690
She's been involved in illegal activities even before we knew each other, and—

99
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:17,280
Chief Jang. You're paying for that dinner, right?

100
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,770
Of course.

101
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,540
I loved you, Seong Jin Mi.

102
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:38,410
- Prosecutor Jang Il Hyeon? 
 -  I am, so what of it?

103
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:42,120
We're arresting you on charges of accepting bribes.

104
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,530
What?!

105
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,280
You have the right to remain silent.

106
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,040
You have the right to an attorney.

107
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:51,460
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.

108
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:54,880
Hey, are you guys crazy?! Don't you know who I am?!

109
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,300
If you refuse to comply with the arrest, you will also be charged with obstruction of justice.

110
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,760
Don't be ridiculous! Which bastard is...

111
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:05,840
 Arrest Warrant 
 Kim Hui Wu 

112
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,460
K-Kim Hui Wu?

113
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,680
Hey, let go! This is invalid!

114
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,550
How dare you pull a stunt like this?! Do you know who I am?!

115
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:17,230
I'm Jang Il Hyeon!

116
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:47,980
 Copying Files 

117
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,630
I should have come by sooner to see you, Sunbae.

118
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:05,190
Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu has been telling me a lot about you.

119
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:07,450
That you took good care of him in school.

120
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,960
Is that what he told you?

121
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,800
Well, I did help so he could have a comfortable school life.

122
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:20,920
What's up? That you came to see me out of the blue?

123
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,520
The thing is,

124
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,280
you know that I'm close to Seonbae Jang, right?

125
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:31,660
I saw him earlier in the hallway, and I was wondering what was going on.

126
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,780
I heard that you have a lot of sources,

127
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,640
but yet, you're asking me?

128
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,800
It's hard to know what's right under your nose.

129
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:54,140
Kim Hui Wu, you bastard! What do you think you're doing?!

130
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:58,080
We're being recorded, Seonbaenim. Please calm down.

131
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:00,940
Please sit.

132
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,740
I didn't have a choice either.

133
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,560
Tell me clearly what's going on!

134
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,070
I was ordered by the higher-ups to investigate you.

135
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:16,640
I just don't understand!

136
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,460
Why did the chief prosecutor ditch me?!

137
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:22,390
Is it because I covered for the National Foundation for the Arts University case?

138
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:24,260
Did Jeon Seok Gyu rat me out?!

139
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,860
Tell me right now!

140
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:33,830
This is my guess, but public opinion about the prosecution has become very negative.

141
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:36,920
The prosecution's credibility has reached new lows due to the female college student murder case,

142
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,520
and in the meantime, Mirae Electronics' incident became magnified.

143
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,000
On top of that,

144
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:46,320
your coverup of the corruption at the National Foundation for the Arts University.

145
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,270
I believe the Chief Prosecutor has been offended continuously.

146
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,930
What?

147
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,570
So that's why he's ditching me?

148
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:57,850
Do you intend to use me as a scapegoat to regain public trust?

149
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,920
I'm sorry.

150
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:05,960
I need to leave because I have something to take care of.

151
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,020
What?  Hey!

152
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,000
It's all done.

153
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,660
When are you going to set it off?

154
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,310
How about tomorrow?

155
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:24,620
Before the press starts to dig into Seonbae Jang.

156
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:28,550
Yes. When something new appears, the public promptly forgets old memories.

157
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,990
The sooner the better.

158
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,750
It turns out that the main character of the Gimsan case was a corrupt prosecutor.

159
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,770
I came up with a witness, too.

160
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:39,770
Of course, I will need your help.

161
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:44,290
Don't be concerned about that.  Make your move before Kim Hui Wu.

162
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:45,810
Yes, sir.

163
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:51,800
- I'm sorry. 
 - That's okay.  Answer it.

164
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,790
Yes.

165
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:57,450
What? There is a briefing?

166
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,900
 Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun 

167
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,770
Will you be okay?

168
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,650
Yes. It doesn't matter.

169
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:31,270
Crazy son of a bitch.

170
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,780
I have something to tell you.

171
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,130
Tell me later.  I'm busy right now.

172
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:48,430
Someone left a present in my office.

173
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:51,880
I found out he's one of your investigators.

174
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:55,470
Did someone ask for my head?

175
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:58,120
What are you talking about?

176
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,960
Do you really not know?

177
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,810
Let's get some coffee.

178
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:36,670
 Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun. 

179
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,850
I am Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

180
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:44,070
I'll start the briefing now.

181
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,910
In accordance with our public mission, while the office was investigating allegations of

182
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:52,760
corruption between the prosecution and industrial conglomerate,

183
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:58,590
we uncovered circumstantial evidence that Prosecutor Jang Il Hyeon accepted bribes.

184
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:03,520
He has received large amounts of cash every month

185
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,190
from the Finance Director of H Chemicals.

186
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:09,780
At the same time, at the request of the chairman of the National Foundation for the Arts University,

187
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:14,170
he interfered with our investigation into corruption involving university admissions.

188
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:20,160
Now the prosecution has lost the citizens' trust.

189
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,460
As a member of the Prosecutor's Office

190
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:28,660
I apologize to everyone for this distrust.

191
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,990
 Prosecution Service 

192
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,910
Aimed at rooting out corruption inside the Prosecution Service,

193
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:46,180
this investigation under the special direction of Seoul Central District Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun,

194
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:52,040
is a specific measure to restore public trust in the office.

195
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:57,580
We will proceed in the future to do our best to investigate thoroughly.

196
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:01,190
- That is all. 
 - Prosecutor Jang Il Hyeon...

197
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,220
 13 missed calls 

198
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,490
I am sorry.  It's due to my negligence.

199
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:18,460
Negligence? Are you challenging me right now?

200
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:22,050
Since when did the Central District Prosecutors' Office represent the entire prosecution?

201
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:24,030
Are you the Attorney General or what?!

202
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:27,710
With whose permission are you apologizing on behalf of the prosecution?!

203
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,210
Sir, the thing is—

204
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:32,700
Also, what's the matter with that Jang Il Hyeon bastard?

205
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,020
 Bribes? 

206
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:38,740
 Don't you know how to keep your subordinates under control? 

207
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,150
 You have a call from the Minister of Justice. 

208
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,740
 Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun 

209
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:55,890
Tell him I'm out and don't put any calls through.

210
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,570
Kim Hui Wu, you crazy bastard.

211
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:03,900
 I'll give you full authority. 

212
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,290
 Finish it off as quickly as possible. 

213
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,080
 Yes, sir. 

214
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,060
 Editor-in-Chief Wu Jang Su 

215
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:16,770
Oh, Chief Wu. I have no time to explain.

216
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:19,930
Put the article about the prosecution on hold right now.

217
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:21,130
What are you talking about?

218
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:25,120
There was a misunderstanding. I meant to clarify it, but—

219
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,560
Why would you clarify it?

220
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,740
Go check online right now.

221
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:32,760
People are saying that you're the next attorney general.

222
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,110
What?

223
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:38,920
  You've been slow lately, but you sure know how to strike. 

224
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:44,350
 It looks like you're the best candidate to become the next attorney general. 

225
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:46,960
 Congratulations. 

226
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,900
 Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun 

227
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:55,940
 Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop 

228
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,920
Yes, sir.

229
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,410
I saw the press conference. Was it intended?

230
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:07,850
That is... I apologize, sir.

231
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:11,830
- What do you mean? Good job. 
 - Sir?

232
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:15,390
  I like your initiative. Don't worry about anything and push for it. 

233
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:20,260
The road to you becoming Attorney General is now wide open.

234
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,550
Yes. Thank you, sir.

235
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:35,010
The road to becoming Attorney General?

236
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,970
 Prosecution 

237
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,860
Come in.

238
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:56,360
I only thought about restoring the prosecution's honor.

239
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,550
I had no choice in order to calm public opinion.

240
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:04,750
I apologize for putting you in a tough spot.

241
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:09,670
I will take responsibility for everything, and— 
 No need. Good job.

242
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:15,110
I expected this outcome when I gave you full authority.

243
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,460
The press briefing was good today.

244
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:23,150
Oh, can you handle the trial for the Prosecutor Jang Il Hyeon case well, too?

245
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:27,770
- Yes, sir. 
- Since we've started, we need a good outcome as well.

246
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:31,750
If not, we’ll be criticized again for caring for our own, understand?

247
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,240
I do.

248
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,010
- You can leave. 
 - Yes, sir.

249
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:49,170
One day.

250
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,420
It took one day.

251
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:57,320
The time it took to get rid of Jang Il Heon.

252
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:03,970
How should I interpret this?

253
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,230
I was amused by what was done to my computer.

254
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:15,600
Bank transaction records that I have no knowledge of were planted.

255
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,450
When I looked into it, I saw that President Jeon Il Bo of Mirae Electronics was tied to it.

256
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:23,710
- Your average investigator couldn't have set up something this big. 
 - Geez.

257
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:26,280
I'll look into it right away.

258
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,200
There's no need, Prosecutor Choi.

259
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,560
I don't want to make a big deal out of this. What's your opinion?

260
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:37,110
But still, we can't let this slide!

261
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,750
Even for the sake of resolving any misunderstandings.

262
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:43,220
Then should I make an issue out it?

263
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,450
I’ll let this particular incident go quietly,

264
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:53,150
so if you find out who was behind it, let him know

265
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:57,090
That if he wants to fight me, he should be prepared to end up in hell together.

266
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:13,020
 Chief Prosecutor’s Office 
Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun 

267
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,740
 I’m sorry! 

268
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:21,960
Kim Hui Wu beat me to it, so I lost my chance to get Jeon Seok Gyu.

269
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,480
Did he figure it out or not?

270
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,250
So he did. How did he react?

271
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:36,010
I don’t know why, but he said he didn’t want to make a big issue out of it and would let it slide.

272
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:38,690
- He said that? 
- He didn't ask any questions.

273
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:40,150
There's no way he doesn't know.

274
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:45,190
If he knows that you did it, he must know that I was behind it.

275
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:55,080
His time in the boondocks must've taught him when not to speak up.

276
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,880
Fine. Bury the Jeon Seok Gyu case.

277
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,600
Can I really do that?

278
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,760
That's what he wants. That should serve as a sufficient warning.

279
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:08,660
Then what will happen to Seonbae Il Hyeon now?

280
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:13,000
What do you think? The law will decide how he should be punished.

281
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:20,230
Take Jang Il Hyeon's vacant seat starting tomorrow.

282
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,740
Oh, okay.

283
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:27,570
- What? 
 - The official order will be issued soon. Go ahead and get back to work.

284
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,290
Yes, sir.

285
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:46,910
 Look in on Jang Il Hyeon on your way out.  

286
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:50,420
 We've spent a lot of time together, so you should at least comfort him. 

287
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:55,470
 And let him know that I won't forget him if he stays quiet.  

288
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,880
Me in Seonbae Jang's position?

289
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:28,200
I raised a snake, didn't I?

290
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:32,780
Where is Kang Jin, that little punk?

291
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:35,410
I'm no longer useful now?

292
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:36,650
I've relayed the information.

293
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:40,880
No... Make him a suspect too.

294
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,090
Could I alone fill your stomach, you snake bastard?

295
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:49,740
If you're looking to succeed by backstabbing your seonbaes, I won't be enough.

296
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,540
What's my title in the media right now?

297
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,530
It's okay. Tell me.

298
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:59,080
Bribed prosecutor.

299
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:03,940
Tell them to change the title.

300
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:08,760
"Choi Kang Jin, Prosecutes for Sexual Favors."

301
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,760
Take him down.

302
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,980
That bastard Kang Jin, too.

303
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,000
You can leave.

304
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,400
Okay.

305
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,230
Seonbae, how can you do this?

306
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:55,740
All I've been doing out there is thinking of ways to save you! You want us to go down together?

307
00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:00,730
I'm sorry. But I know you as well as you know me.

308
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,690
You've been thinking of ways to save me out there? Stop bullshitting.

309
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:08,670
You wouldn't have done anything if I hadn't taken it this far.

310
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:11,850
I have evidence of all of the corruption you've committed thus far.

311
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:16,490
If you don't want that all to blow up in your face, get moving. Don't worry about saving me.

312
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:18,840
Just bring Kim Hui Wu here.

313
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:25,390
To jail. In the same room as me.

314
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:30,760
I threw the bait to Kim Hui Wu, so he will come after you hard.

315
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,680
Find something small and blow it up.

316
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:39,690
Arrest and lock him up the moment he conducts an illegal investigation without a warrant.

317
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:43,020
From that point you can do your specialty of fabricating crimes.

318
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:46,570
Okay. Don't worry.

319
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:49,700
I will get you out on probation,

320
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:54,440
and I’ll come up with a plan to put that bastard Kim Hui Wu away for at least two years.

321
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:59,730
He will learn the price he has to pay for betraying his seonbae for his own success.

322
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:01,720
I'll make sure to show him.

323
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:06,980
Do your best to make sure you don't lose your law license.

324
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,600
I understand.

325
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,880
Kim Hui Wu. Don't ever underestimate him.

326
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,520
It you're not careful, you'll end up in my situation. Do you understand?

327
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,790
Yes. Don't worry.

328
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:22,400
I'll get going.

329
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,080
 Investigation Room 

330
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:42,220
What are you doing?

331
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:46,040
I was just passing by and wanted to order some food for Chief Prosecutor Jang.

332
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,120
What should I order? Triangle kimbap?

333
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,500
Do whatever you want.

334
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,680
When will you honor your promise?

335
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,890
Why? I thought you were going to send me to prison.

336
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:01,310
Oh... That? It got boring.

337
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:05,860
I was going to put you away with Jang Il Hyeon as a pair, but we're missing the hamburger.

338
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:09,440
It's not right to just send the french fries.

339
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,760
Crazy asshole…

340
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,710
An easy game is no fun.

341
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:23,140
 Gangwon District Prosecutors' Office, Gimsan Branch 

342
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,740
  Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu 

343
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,320
 Prosecutor Service 

344
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:42,870
Hello, Prosecutor Kim.

345
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:45,570
Hi Investigator Oh. It's me. Have you been well?

346
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:48,860
Yes. I've been so well that I'm feeling antsy.

347
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,720
Should I make it fun for you?

348
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,450
 I'm already looking forward to it. 

349
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:54,270
Where is it this time?

350
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:56,030
Cheers.

351
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,050
You worked hard. Because of you, my lifespan got extended.

352
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:07,210
It's all thanks to you working with me.

353
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:10,350
About that, are you just going to leave Choi Kang Jin alone?

354
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:15,000
He’s Jang Il Hyeon's close associate, so I investigated him. A lot of suspicious things came up.

355
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,410
There is a saying that there are some things that are forbidden.

356
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:20,360
Like the fact that you cannot catch young fish that are below standard.

357
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,370
Exactly. Choi Kang Jin is still immature.

358
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:25,940
There's no reason to waste the bait.

359
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:29,000
I want you to catch the bigger one first.

360
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:35,480
SHC Entertainment, the company that Choi Kang Jin's father, Choi Su Hyeok, runs.

361
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,250
Hyeongnim.

362
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:47,170
You're here.

363
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:48,650
Prosecutor Gu is here, right?

364
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:50,210
Yes. But...

365
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,980
Why?

366
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,760
Go in and see.

367
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,450
- Let's get started— 
   - Hey! Kim Hui Wu. 

368
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,980
Who said you could meet with my direct subordinate without my knowledge?

369
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:05,970
How are you here?

370
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:08,370
What happened?

371
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:10,850
I got caught on my way out.

372
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:15,240
What is it? What were you going to talk about without me?

373
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,560
Are you disregarding me?

374
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:21,580
It's not that. It's too dangerous.

375
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:25,380
I didn't want to drag you into it, too. Please understand.

376
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,940
What are you saying? You made me catch a serial killer.

377
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,360
It might be dangerous?

378
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:35,540
You must have misunderstood something.

379
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:38,490
I have more experience as a prosecutor than you both.

380
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:41,680
I've been doing it for three years longer.

381
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:45,310
I'm your seonbae. Do you understand?

382
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:48,350
It's so ridiculous that I'm speechless.

383
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:53,030
I'm sorry. Sorry.

384
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,600
Sorry?

385
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:59,300
No. I apologize, Seonbaenim.

386
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:04,010
Fine.

387
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,050
Tell me what's going on.

388
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:10,640
Please don't be angry. Come sit.

389
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,810
You'll know by looking at the documents, but it's SHC Entertainment.

390
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:26,260
Choi Kang Jin's father is an important figure in entertainment, but he's done a lot of bad things.

391
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:32,440
All the while, Choi Kang Jin has been covering for his father on controversial cases.

392
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,090
This crazy...

393
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:38,090
He lobbied politicians by using aspiring actors in his company?

394
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:42,210
We only have charges. We still need to find evidence.

395
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:45,570
I understand why you called over Prosecutor Gu.

396
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:48,610
The Central District Prosecutor's Office is worked up as it is because of Jang Il Hyeon's case.

397
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:54,610
If we lock up Choi Kang Jin, too, it would look like the prosecution is being attacked internally.

398
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:58,850
But... What if we delayed this a little bit?

399
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:03,120
From lawmakers, to journalists, lawyers and chaebols.

400
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,440
It's unlikely we would be able to take this to court with our power alone.

401
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,190
No. We can catch them.

402
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,770
We can build it up with what we know for certain.

403
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:18,010
You should go meet Jo Yun Ah, the actress.

404
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:20,620
- Jo Yun Ah? 
 - Yes.

405
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:24,260
She knows a lot about SHC Entertainment.

406
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:29,010
If Jo Yun Ah, the symbol of youth and innocence opens her mouth...

407
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:34,250
It would cause a commotion. Even a member of the National Assembly wouldn't be able to stop it.

408
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:38,160
But, will she cooperate?

409
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,520
Her image is everything.

410
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:49,070
 Profile of Actress Jo Yun Ah 

411
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:54,110
Propofol? Drugs? Jo Yun Ah is doing drugs?

412
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,180
Let's suggest a plea bargain.

413
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:59,360
You want to make a deal?

414
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,970
Well.  Let's think of it as a special case.

415
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,800
 Plea Bargain: An agreement that the sentence will be reduced if the defendant pleads guilty. 

416
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:11,710
Okay. Let's try it.

417
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:29,530
 Jang Il Hyeon  

418
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:32,960
 Jang Il Hyeon  

419
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:38,990
This is my seat now, Seonbae.

420
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:47,050
If things go well, wouldn't I be the youngest person to become Chief Prosecutor?

421
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:55,130
 Don’t ever take Kim Hui Wu for a fool.   

422
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:57,670
 The moment you let your guard down, you will end up like me. 

423
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:59,420
 Do you understand? 

424
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:04,860
I'm not stupid like you.

425
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,460
What's this?

426
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:24,790
This is not the time to be casually working out.

427
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,170
Elder, I am here.

428
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:07,100
Why did you come again?

429
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,930
No place is as comfortable as here.

430
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:13,040
A comfortable place?  Aren't you here to hide?

431
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,620
What?

432
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,020
You brought along that guy behind the telephone pole.

433
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:22,670
You caught on.

434
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:26,500
Since you came here wanting to hide, I will hide you.

435
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:31,930
Fill my glass already. Should I call that guy over to pour instead?

436
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:33,910
No, sir.

437
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,640
Here.

438
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,910
I'm back.

439
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,840
Oh, you are!

440
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,040
You need to eat, right?

441
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,950
Yes.

442
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:04,440
Aren't you tired of always eating the same thing?

443
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,080
 Come on! 

444
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,300
How can the son of a braised chicken restaurant shop ever say that!

445
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,750
I don't ever get tired of it. I want to eat it and eat it again.

446
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:12,090
I keep dreaming about eating it.

447
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:14,540
Sang Man, you're my son.

448
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:16,390
I guess I'm handsome because I resemble you.

449
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:20,970
Hui Wu's the one who looks like me. You just grow up healthy for me.

450
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:25,210
Hyeong, taste this.

451
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:26,230
I don't want to.

452
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,360
Eat it. Eat it. Eat it.

453
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,550
Taste it, Hyeong.

454
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:31,340
Here.

455
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:36,580
It's more delicious today!

456
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:41,580
Yeon Seok, is your studying going well?

457
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,600
No, it's hard.

458
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,540
 Assemblyman Hwang, will you accept responsibility for what you are saying? 

459
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:52,560
 Yes, I accept responsibility. 

460
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,970
Is that the assemblyman who does volunteer work at the hospital where Mom is hospitalized?

461
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:59,280
 Are you determined to divide the country? 

462
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,940
 Is questioning corruption divisive? 

463
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:06,030
Hey, he's like a neighborhood ajussi normally, but he is a fighter when he's at the National Assembly.

464
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:09,050
He's just a hypocrite pretending to be good.

465
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:11,630
Without cameras around, he probably wouldn't do volunteer work.

466
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:14,470
There's no camera there.

467
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:18,610
I don't know what all that's about. Always bickering.

468
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:22,550
The more you fight, the more you age. If you fight a lot, you die young.

469
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,030
 Overheated war of words between majority and opposition parties at the confirmation hearing for Minister of Justice  

470
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:33,080
Nice to meet you.  I am Kim Gyu Ri from the Eastern District Prosecution Office.

471
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,760
I'm prosecutor Gu Seung Hyeok.

472
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,890
Hello. I am Jo Yun Ah.

473
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:40,140
Please have a seat.

474
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:46,810
Thank you for agreeing to the investigation.

475
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:51,650
Not at all.  You are offering to help, so how could I refuse?

476
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:55,010
We want to help you as much as we can.

477
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:04,340
Where should I start?

478
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:09,410
  I met Prosecutor Choi Kang Jin  for the first time at a place called the Future Talent Forum. 

479
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:11,920
 - He approached  me quite enthusiastically. 
  - Nice to meet you.  

480
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:17,430
I thought he sincerely like me, and I liked him, too.

481
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:21,040
During that time, I was having a rough time with my agency,

482
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,990
and Prosecutor Choi Kang Jin offered to help me sign with SHC Entertainment,

483
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:27,580
the agency run by his father President Choi Su Hyeok.

484
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:30,260
So, did you?

485
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,410
Yes.

486
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:35,080
President Choi said he would even get me an opportunity to go to Hollywood

487
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,890
and give me the largest signing bonus.

488
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:40,250
Also,

489
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:46,600
he introduced me to a famous plastic surgery clinic in Gangnam where all expenses would be covered by the agency.

490
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:50,460
That caused a problem.

491
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,830
A problem?

492
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:57,300
I was persuaded by the plastic surgeon, and I had several procedures done.

493
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:01,440
Before I knew it, I was addicted.

494
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,900
Geez.

495
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,050
President Choi found out about it and used it by

496
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:10,350
offering for me to secretly meet a wealthy married man.

497
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:13,340
At first, I refused,

498
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:17,920
but I couldn't bear the threat of exposure of my use of the drug propofol.

499
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,250
So did you tell Prosecutor Choi Kang Jin?

500
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:25,910
It's been a long time since we've been in contact.

501
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:30,490
I'm so upset that I ever loved such a person for even a moment.

502
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:32,570
You should sue him.

503
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:36,560
- Sue him?  
 - Yes, of course.  That kind of punk you need to...

504
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,090
Yes.  We will help you with the rest.

505
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:46,290
Thank you.

506
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,790
 Cheonha Hospital 

507
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:54,180
That soon? You said he would be okay for a few years.

508
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:57,600
About that...

509
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,170
I apologize, Agassi.  (Agassi: young lady, often used for unmarried daughter of a wealthy family.) 

510
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:05,950
Please keep it confidential, for the time being, Director.

511
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,650
Even from my family.

512
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:10,960
Yes, I will.

513
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:16,120
Should I take you to the Economic Research Institute?

514
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:19,280
No.  Where is Dad right now?

515
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,210
He's meeting with Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop.

516
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:23,530
What?

517
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:27,050
Cheonha Distributors is planning a premium outlet, right?

518
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:28,710
Yes.

519
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:33,820
I've chosen this location for the outlet.

520
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:39,660
You won't have to worry about any land problems or related laws.

521
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:42,710
I've taken care of everything, so just take your time looking around.

522
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:45,430
I appreciate what you are saying,

523
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:48,600
but I'm sorry.

524
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,300
My eldest is usually in charge of outlets.

525
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:56,340
I want to see him handle it on his own without help from anyone.

526
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,270
I see.

527
00:38:58,270 --> 00:38:59,910
I'm sorry.

528
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:02,000
It's nothing.

529
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:09,350
Kim Gun Yeong ...

530
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:58,150
Judging from your expression, you must have met with Director Yun.

531
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:05,000
I heard that he told you to rest no matter what.

532
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:07,600
I don't have much time left.

533
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,650
Dad!

534
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:14,030
If you're that worried about me, do as I wish.

535
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:18,740
I need to sort it out while I'm alive.

536
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:23,310
Do you really not want it?

537
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:27,380
Hui Ah, no matter what anyone says, the one who will lead Cheonha is—

538
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:29,770
I told you before.

539
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:33,380
I don't want to fight with my brothers.

540
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:40,760
Money is thicker than blood.  That's the way the world is.

541
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:44,450
When I die, there will be a fight.  Until someone dies.

542
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:47,610
Hui Ah, while you might want to protect our family,

543
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:52,540
I am responsible for the thousands of employees at our company.

544
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:56,670
 Father, please re-consider. 

545
00:40:56,670 --> 00:41:02,140
 We must mercilessly get rid of those who are against management by restructuring. 

546
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:04,530
 Look at the cost savings. 

547
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:10,260
 Don't look at people as numbers. Unless the restructuring is something you can't help but do. 

548
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:13,840
 Oppa, can you re-consider just once more? 

549
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:17,310
 If it leads to a decrease in productivity, the problem will only grow worse. 

550
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:18,650
 Kim Hui Ah! 

551
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:20,810
 I'm neutral. 

552
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:26,490
 Father, if we can just get rid of lazy workers who only cost us money,  

553
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:29,740
 we can save approximately 500 billion won in the electronics sector. 

554
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:32,830
 What? Lazy workers who only cost us money?!  

555
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:36,340
 How dare you say that about my staff?!  

556
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:45,090
Someone who can only see the small profits in front of him doesn't deserve to be in charge of Cheonha.

557
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:51,820
Hui Ah, please re-consider.

558
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:12,070
Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop has asked to meet with your older brother.

559
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,160
What?

560
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,650
Should I tell the chairman?

561
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:21,120
No, don't do that.  I'm sure he already knows.

562
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,830
Then Seung Jun will be summoned soon, too.

563
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:28,880
Jo Tae Seop...

564
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,190
I'm sure he's trying to make us fight with us in his grasp.

565
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:36,270
He's going to blatantly intervene in my family's affairs?

566
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:39,380
Not Kim Hui Ah. She's shrewd.

567
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:41,420
She won't follow my will.

568
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:45,250
But Chairman Kim seems to have chosen Kim Hui Ah.

569
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:50,290
It's said that Chairman Kim recently transferred Cheonha Produce bearer bonds to Kim Hui Ah.

570
00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:53,830
He must mean to slowly start supporting his child of choice.

571
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:58,910
The world has changed. It doesn't make sense to hand everything down to one child.

572
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:02,590
Who do you want to become the chairman of Cheonha?

573
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:05,260
Didn't you decide on Kim Yong Jun?

574
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:07,390
Nothing is for sure in this world.

575
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:10,200
Whoever fits the role takes the seat.

576
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,370
Don't you think so, Director Han?

577
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:17,820
I believe that the successor could change depending on the choices of the politicians when you include tax issues in the equation.

578
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:19,960
I see.

579
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,150
What happened to Kim Yong Jun?

580
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:24,640
I let him know that you'd like to meet him.

581
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:29,540
However, he refused, saying that he'd follow Chairman Kim Geon Yeong's resolution to keep his distance from politics.

582
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,220
As expected.

583
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:36,260
They're puppies that aren't used to the leash. They'll pull against it again and again.

584
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:39,880
However, the results for leashed dogs are always the same.

585
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,900
They move as their owner wishes.

586
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:47,000
They'll soon roll over and show their belly in front of me.

587
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,330
Tell him I'd like to see him again in a little while.

588
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:52,350
Understood.

589
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:06,520
What's he thinking?

590
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:11,960
He's not the kind of guy to just sit back.

591
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:14,090
Enjoy your meal.

592
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:22,790
Only a few more days until the Jang Il Hyeon trial, right?

593
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:23,790
Yes.

594
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:28,920
Seems like Jang Il Hyeon's sentence is almost certain.

595
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,370
How does it feel to hit another home run after the Gimsan case?

596
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:35,350
It was nothing much. I just did what I'm supposed to.

597
00:44:35,350 --> 00:44:37,510
Who's next?

598
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:41,820
You sent Jang Il Hyeon away, so Choi Kang Jin?

599
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,570
Or Choi Kang Jin's father Choi Su Hyeok?

600
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:52,520
Knowing you, I think you'd go after the father first.

601
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:02,770
Present.

602
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:09,130
 SHC Entertainment Male Celebrity Military Corruption History 

603
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:11,250
Military corruption...

604
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:14,940
How did you...?

605
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:19,300
Jang Il Hyeon acted like such a jerk when he took my case in the past,

606
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,220
so I did a background check.

607
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:26,910
I looked into Kang Jin at the same time, and he's no saint either.

608
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:29,320
Choi Kang Jin's father, Choi Su Hyeok.

609
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:35,270
The male actors from that entertainment production company got a diagnosis from the hospital written there,

610
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:39,540
and the doctor in charge is getting a pretty penny from Kang Jin's father.

611
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:43,530
I'm sure you were busy dealing with the Mirae Electronics case. Thank you.

612
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:47,940
By now, shouldn't you treat me to some neungi baeksuk  (steamed/boiled unseasoned meat or fish)  or something?

613
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:53,060
- Excuse me– 
 - Nope. Let's just keep going with the braised chicken.

614
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:55,370
I have something to give you too.

615
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:02,080
What is this?

616
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,840
I can't tell you where it's from,

617
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:09,000
but this is the transaction history of the paper company created by President Jeon Il Bo.

618
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,580
No matter how much we keep digging, his crimes keep coming out like a sweet potato vine.

619
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:15,660
I guess I can't have the neungi baeksuk.

620
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:17,340
Braised chicken, sure.

621
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:20,280
Sir, two more servings of the braised chicken, please.

622
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:24,610
Of course. The best order is an additional order.

623
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:27,100
Have a glass.

624
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:34,290
Thank you, Hui Wu.

625
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:38,120
I'm more thankful.

626
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:45,890
Hey, I can go on my own.

627
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:50,200
You came all the way to my neighborhood, so I need to see you off.

628
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,770
Do you like me that much?

629
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:54,230
It's just manners. Manners.

630
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:03,440
- Wait. 
 - What is it?

631
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:07,480
There was a string wrapped around the man's hand.

632
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:45,570
 Your father did something wrong, so you should be punished in his place! 

633
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:54,220
You bastard!

634
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:57,610
Stop there!

635
00:47:57,610 --> 00:47:59,400
Hey!

636
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:02,870
Are you okay?

637
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:05,540
Excuse me!?

638
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:19,660
I didn't run. I was waiting for you.

639
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:25,050
I'll give you a chance. You can keep walking or die.

640
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:31,220
I'll give you a chance, too. Get arrested nicely, or get arrested after being beaten up.

641
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:34,060
You must've lost your sense of fear, huh?

642
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,540
Don't move, or your bones will break.

643
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:58,340
 Operating Room 

644
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:02,850
Hye Jin... Hye Jin...

645
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:08,060
These are the men.

646
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:12,460
- Thank you.
  Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong. Han Mi? 

647
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:14,900
I don't know how to repay you.

648
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:16,910
Thank you.

649
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:25,940
Fortunately, she looks like she'll be okay.

650
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:32,220
Why did that man... terrorize my daughter?

651
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:36,160
We're still looking into it, but he said he didn't like your political actions.

652
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,630
He attacked my daughter because of that? .

653
00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:43,430
He should've ... he should've attacked me instead.

654
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:51,030
Ajussi?

655
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:55,000
Yeah. Well, I guess I can call him a drinking buddy.

656
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,970
How did you become friends with him?

657
00:49:56,970 --> 00:49:59,770
I tutored Hye Jin when I was in college.

658
00:49:59,770 --> 00:50:02,890
- Hye Jin? 
  - His daughter.

659
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:07,940
What? Is it funny to hear that I used to tutor?

660
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:09,460
Yes.

661
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:13,000
Anyway, I'm worried.

662
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,080
I hope nothing happens to Hye Jin.

663
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:20,660
After his wife passed away, Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong lived only caring about Hye Jin.

664
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:22,290
 Is this heaven's plan?  

665
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:25,190
 Getting connected with Assemblyman Hwang like this... 

666
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:26,990
Can you set up a meeting for us?

667
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:30,540
- What? With him? 
 - Yes.

668
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:34,660
I think I might be able to be of help to him.

669
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,370
I'll try.

670
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:42,310
- It's getting late. I'm going to go. 
 - Okay.

671
00:50:42,310 --> 00:50:44,820
- Get home safe. 
 - Okay.

672
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:48,920
 Assemblyman Hwang's daughter died in my past life.  

673
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:52,540
 A passionate supporter of Jo Tae Seop made it happen. 

674
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:56,580
 I hope she won't lose her life again in this life. 

675
00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:06,430
Please sit.

676
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:08,900
Wait a minute,

677
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:11,820
I didn't know the two of you were friends.

678
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:13,910
Here, have a drink.

679
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:16,480
Let me introduce myself properly.

680
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,720
I'm prosecutor Kim Hui Wu from the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

681
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:26,320
Prosecutors... I'm not really...

682
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:31,350
I know very well that you don't trust prosecutors.

683
00:51:31,350 --> 00:51:34,330
I'd like to ask you for just three minutes.

684
00:51:34,330 --> 00:51:37,560
I'll give you three minutes.

685
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:41,710
Stop what you're preparing.

686
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:44,430
What do you suppose I'm preparing?

687
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:48,160
A knife aimed at Jo Tae Seop.

688
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:51,420
Even if you swing it around, that knife will only slice the air.

689
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:55,060
No, you won't even get to swing it.

690
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:58,850
- See you later, Reporter Kim. 
 - Three minutes hasn't passed yet.

691
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:04,180
You're a prosecutor?

692
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:07,490
- Hui Wu... 
 - There's a traitor in your midst.

693
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:09,490
You need to find that person.

694
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:18,290
Young prosecutor, thank you for saving my daughter, but that's it.

695
00:52:18,290 --> 00:52:22,390
If you're a prosecutor, you should act like one instead of snooping around the political arena.

696
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:26,310
Also, a traitor?

697
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:31,430
It's wrong to speak ill of my people by driving in a wedge, like that.

698
00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:33,550
It's been three minutes.

699
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:37,070
Ajussi!

700
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:48,720
Why did you do that?

701
00:52:50,350 --> 00:52:52,800
I told you he hates prosecutors.

702
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,930
- Treading carefully was the least you could've– 
 - I told you already.

703
00:52:55,930 --> 00:53:00,410
- That I might be of some help to Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong. 
 - What?

704
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:03,790
In order to do that, he needs to trust me.

705
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:06,890
What are you talking about? I don't understand.

706
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:10,660
He is a good man, give him moral support.

707
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,240
 Daehan Party Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong's Office 

708
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:20,980
 What? 

709
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:24,670
Chairman Kim Jeong Taek seems to have made a deal with Jo Tae Seop?

710
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:26,370
Yes, sir.

711
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:30,480
I think Jo Tae Seop has caught onto what we were planning to strike him with.

712
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,880
Jo Tae Seop raised the issue of bribery to Chairman Kim Jeong Taek, and—

713
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:38,550
Kim Jeong Taek made a deal with our information.

714
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:41,930
To prevent his own bribery charges.

715
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:43,590
Yes, sir.

716
00:53:48,110 --> 00:53:49,800
Wait...

717
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:52,670
But how did Kim Jeong Taek find out?

718
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:55,540
What we were planning?

719
00:53:56,470 --> 00:53:58,750
The information might have leaked.

720
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,320
President Kim... I heard.

721
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:13,570
But that was evidence to strike Jo Tae Seop's faction.

722
00:54:13,570 --> 00:54:18,120
You turned that over to save your own face?

723
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:22,240
President Kim.

724
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,460
President Kim.

725
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:34,280
Call a meeting right now.

726
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:37,660
 Daehan Party 

727
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:44,080
 Call cannot be connected, leave your message  

728
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:47,540
No one is answering.

729
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:57,090
 Daehan Party for a Better Country 

730
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:16,100
It's been a while.

731
00:55:19,270 --> 00:55:22,740
I'm happy to see you, but I guess you don't feel the same.

732
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:28,160
Why... would I be?

733
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:33,130
Seonbaenim, maybe you remember,

734
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:38,960
when we worked together at the prosecutors', we did a lot of work for this country.

735
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:44,360
Catching killers, gangsters, day and night.

736
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:48,100
Even back then, you pursued an ideal.

737
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:50,810
Let's follow the law, stick to the regulations.

738
00:55:50,810 --> 00:55:53,030
But what happened in the end?

739
00:55:53,030 --> 00:55:56,360
You lost. You only failed!

740
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:58,270
 Why would I request an arrest warrant? 

741
00:55:58,270 --> 00:55:59,680
 Then they’ll find out!  

742
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:03,150
 The law is the same for everyone. Let's stick to the regulations!  

743
00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:05,570
 Hyeongnim, the defendant is the president’s son!  

744
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:07,550
 - Even at this moment, that bastard— 
 - Hey, Jo Tae Seop!  

745
00:56:07,550 --> 00:56:09,320
 Seonbae! 

746
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:13,060
 They're asking us to stop. 

747
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:15,630
 They want us to stop the investigation.  

748
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:19,110
 Damn it! Seonbae! 

749
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:22,900
An idealist like you wouldn't understand.

750
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:27,680
You can't see reality because you're hung up on ideals.

751
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:33,400
"I will give money to the poor and create jobs."

752
00:56:35,390 --> 00:56:38,700
So... what did you do exactly?

753
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:42,700
It's always all talk, just like the prosecution days.

754
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:46,490
Again, you'll regret this, too.

755
00:56:46,490 --> 00:56:49,570
"I should have worked harder."

756
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:52,760
I'm different from you.

757
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:55,600
I don't think about anything else but how to make this country strong.

758
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:58,050
I don't do politics that are all talk.

759
00:56:58,050 --> 00:57:02,680
If you ignore the process, there will be sacrifices made accordingly.

760
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:07,570
Do you have any feelings of regret or guilt about those sacrifices?

761
00:57:07,570 --> 00:57:09,220
No.

762
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:12,200
Someone has to sacrifice.

763
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,980
I don't care about the dirt on my clothes.

764
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:16,980
I don't care if I get covered in filth.

765
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:21,520
If our citizens can live well, if this country can become powerful!

766
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:24,870
So why...

767
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:27,780
do you only look at the specks of dust and point fingers?

768
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:33,250
Don't you know that you have to get your hands dirty while achieving great things?

769
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:38,060
If someone who has to achieve great things only stares at the specks of dust,

770
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:42,110
no one will stand by you.

771
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,570
Just like now.

772
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:57,490
I promised to nominate him for the next general election.

773
00:57:57,490 --> 00:58:01,380
In return, he handed over all the material to me.

774
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:05,770
You did? Why?

775
00:58:05,770 --> 00:58:09,520
I worked under you for eight years for the sake of the people.

776
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:14,850
But you didn’t even once mention the nomination to me.

777
00:58:14,850 --> 00:58:18,860
I'm sorry, sir.

778
00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:21,820
I want to do politics.

779
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:24,070
You...

780
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:27,650
need to learn more.

781
00:58:27,650 --> 00:58:29,670
Seonbaenim.

782
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:39,220
You don't even understand how those around you feel, so how you could understand the hearts of the people?

783
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:44,800
I suggest you stop having limited vision and look at the big picture instead.

784
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:47,490
With us.

785
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:49,580
Together!

786
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:03,770
That

787
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:07,690
will never happen.

788
00:59:07,690 --> 00:59:12,690
Then... this is as far as I can go with

789
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:16,310
being considerate of you.

790
00:59:29,550 --> 00:59:32,140
 There is a traitor in your midst.  

791
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:34,670
 You need to find that person.  

792
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:37,680
That was my aide?

793
01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:08,670
Thank you.

794
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:30,150
How did you know there was a traitor?

795
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:34,310
I hear a lot things working at the prosecution.

796
01:00:34,310 --> 01:00:37,680
Do you know why I dislike prosecutors?

797
01:00:38,570 --> 01:00:41,450
The current chief prosecutor is Jo Tae Seop’s dog.

798
01:00:41,450 --> 01:00:45,240
Everything that happens in the prosecution goes to Jo Tae Seop’s ears,

799
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:49,470
that’s what makes him stronger.

800
01:00:52,390 --> 01:00:54,770
That's probably why you don't like them.

801
01:01:00,430 --> 01:01:03,030
I only have one master.

802
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,320
The law is my master.

803
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:09,350
I only follow the law.

804
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:24,270
I'm a prosecutor.

805
01:01:24,270 --> 01:01:29,030
I want to take down Jo Tae Seop by helping you.

806
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:57,010
What is this?

807
01:01:57,010 --> 01:01:59,640
Pandora's box.

808
01:02:01,810 --> 01:02:03,200
 Public Officials' Children who evaded Military Service 

809
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:04,440
This is...

810
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:08,980
Yes, it's exactly as you see.

811
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:11,440
What do you want me to do with this?

812
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,470
Present it to the National Assembly.

813
01:02:13,470 --> 01:02:15,380
It will shock the country.

814
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:19,940
But you will regain your political strength.

815
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:22,540
No one can open this box

816
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:25,770
except you.

817
01:02:27,670 --> 01:02:31,950
The moment you open this Pandora’s box, the world will react loudly,

818
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:38,840
but the people will be able to see their last hope.

819
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:55,920
 Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong was the only politician who opposed Jo Tae Seop. 

820
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:02,320
 Now his wings are broken, but he is essential to defeating Jo Tae Seop.

 Pandora's box will open. 

830
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:54,240
 I will release the names on this list. 

831

 Don't be lenient on those people on the list. 

832

 Tell those people on the list. Tell them to come to me if they want to live. 

833
01:04:00,490 --> 01:04:04,340
 I will be part of management. 

834
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:07,760
 Are you brave? Or are you reckless? 

835
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:11,420
 I will make sure to expose Jo Tae Seop's real identity to the world. 

836
01:04:11,420 --> 01:04:14,110
 You'll get another chance. Take a breather and wait. 

837
01:04:14,110 --> 01:04:18,180
 Now that we've joined hands, I ought to grant him his wish.
