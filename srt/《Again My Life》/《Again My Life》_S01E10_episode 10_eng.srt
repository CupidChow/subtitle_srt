 Episode 10 

7
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,250
He'll need every assemblyman's help.

8
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,500
- Yes, sir. 
- Yes, sir.

9
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,180
 What's this? 

10
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,930
 Pandora's box. 

11
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,290
 Public Officials' Children who evaded Military Service 

12
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:56,460
 - This is...
 - Yes. 

13
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,130
 It's as you see. 

14
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,600
 What do you want me to do? 

15
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,620
 Bring it up at the National Assembly. 

16
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,510
 This will destroy the country. 

17
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:10,040
 But you will gain power again. 

18
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,600
 You're the only one... 

19
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,960
 who can open this box. 

20
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:22,150
 The moment you open the box, the world will be in an uproar. 

21
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:28,730
 But people will be able to see the last ray of hope. 

22
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:38,900
Assemblyman Hwang. Stop objecting just for the sake of objecting.

23
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,510
The Minister of Justice position...

24
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:46,170
shouldn't be left vacant for too long.

25
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,280
If the candidate was truly qualified for the position,

26
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,850
you'd have nothing to worry about.

27
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,590
 Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong remains strongly opposed. 

28
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:14,770
 They will yet again struggle to reach an agreement at the confirmation hearing for the Minister of Justice candidate. 

29
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:18,330
 Here's the Legislation and Judiciary Committee, where the hearing is being held. 

30
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:23,320
 We will now begin the confirmation hearing for the Minister of Justice nominee. 

31
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,560
 Pandora's box is about to be opened. 

32
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,980
 Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong. 

33
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,500
 You may ask questions. 

34
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,770
Yes. What are your thoughts on public officials' children...

35
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:37,100
purposely evading their military service?

36
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,220
Pardon?

37
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:43,630
I received this list from an informant who wishes to remain anonymous.

38
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,910
This list includes the names of high-ranking public officials' children who

39
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:51,750
avoided military service through a broker.

40
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,050
It contains the names of 37 people,

41
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:57,820
which includes the children of some of the assemblymen

42
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,280
who are here now.

43
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,730
It is of utmost importance that public officials

44
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:11,010
always act with ethical awareness. Yet their children are guilty of military service evasion.

45
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:13,790
Are you confident that you can handle this fairly and justly?

46
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,690
I am asking you if you can do it.

47
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,990
The nation is watching.

48
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,410
Please answer my question.

49
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:22,160
Yes. If they broke the law, they should—

50
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,740
Assemblyman Hwang! Can you take responsibility for what you're saying right now?!

51
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,060
Responsibility? Yes, I can and I will.

52
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,910
However, you'll be under investigation too, Assemblyman Park.

53
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:36,710
And of course, the 37 people on this list, including your son,

54
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:39,310
will be re-examined for military enlistment.

55
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,680
I have another question for the nominee.

56
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,080
What are your thoughts on narcotics law violations committed by

57
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,800
some celebrities and high-ranking public officials' family members?

58
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,270
- Narcotics? 
- Yes.

59
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:53,070
Narcotics.

60
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:57,530
In this document are names of about 50 drug offenders,

61
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:01,830
which includes the children of the lawmakers present.

62
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,870
How will you proceed?

63
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:06,600
I will follow the procedure established by the law—

64
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,440
Forget it.

65
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:13,880
Lastly, let me ask one more question to the Minister of Justice nominee.

66
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:18,490
Nominee, have you ever received sexual favors?

67
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,300
"Sexual favors"?

68
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,040
Assemblyman Hwang, are you here to cause trouble?

69
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,850
Why bring up something irrelevant and make everyone uncomfortable?

70
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:31,380
Be quiet. I'm not done talking.

71
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:36,000
Nominee, I asked if you ever received sexual favors.

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,330
- No, never.
 - You're lying.

73
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:42,380
Never? Are you sure?

74
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,230
 Jo Tae Seop 

75
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:48,750
I'm asking because your name is on this sexual bribery list.

76
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,670
Assemblyman Hwang, stop talking nonsense!

77
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:55,190
How dare you spread false information?

78
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,830
Did you say "false information"?

79
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,800
False information? Assemblyman Kim, Assemblyman Yoo.

80
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,270
Your names are on this list too!

81
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,820
- What? 
- What did you say?

82
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:07,090
Assemblymen, do you think this is normal?

83
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:09,500
These people are not qualified to be participating

84
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,890
in this confirmation hearing for the Minister of Justice nominee.

85
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:16,240
They have no right to be judging anyone's qualifications.

86
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,220
All right. Now,

87
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:23,880
I will read out the names on this list one by one.

88
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,020
Assemblyman Hwang! Have you lost your mind?

89
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,420
Hey! Turn off the cameras!

90
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,880
- Turn off the cameras! 
- Hey, the cameras!

91
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,800
Park Su Nam,

92
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,630
Choi Hyeon Min,

93
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,710
Han Il Gu,

94
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,650
Park Ju Hyeon.

95
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:39,820
Stop!

96
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,850
- What are you doing? 
- Calm down!

97
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,560
Order! Please be seated!

98
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,260
Order!

99
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:50,000
Order!

100
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,750
Assemblyman Lee! Go back to your seat!

101
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,330
Go back to your seat!

102
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,800
 Minister of Justice Nominee Alleged to Have Received Sexual Favors 

103
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,880
It's begun.

104
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,410
- Let's move on it. 
 - Okay.

105
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,710
What happened to the search warrant for SHC Entertainment?

106
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:12,060
The chief said not to worry. It will be issued soon.

107
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,900
Okay.

108
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:18,530
- Check the witnesses involved in sexual favors again! 
 - Yes, ma'am

109
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,910
 What?! A search warrant?! 

110
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:29,050
Crazy wench!

111
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:31,440
Yes, I understand, Father.

112
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,160
I’ll take care of the most urgent things first. Yes, Father.

113
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:41,140
Hey Kim Hui Wu, I have to go out for a sec. Let me know if you need me.

114
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,710
Is something wrong?

115
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,510
Nothing special.

116
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,740
An obstacle coming from someone I never imagined.

117
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,950
Is there anything I can help you with?

118
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,980
It's fine.

119
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,490
Just stay here and figure out what's going on.

120
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,060
At times like these, you sure move fast.

121
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:15,580
When I needed your help, you didn’t even return my calls.

122
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,540
A prosecutor came by. She was curious.

123
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:25,190
Drugs and celebrity sexual favors, and you, who are behind it.

124
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,030
- Which prosecutor? 
 - Well...

125
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,430
Is that important now?

126
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:34,410
It looks like what matters now is how you feel.

127
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:41,340
Tell me how you feel. Are you ready to make a deal?

128
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,600
 Public Officials' Children Who Evaded Military Service 

129
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,100
Sir, it's the Prosecutor General for you.

130
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,100
Did you say SHC Entertainment? Stop all activities.

131
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:59,570
The Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office will take charge of the investigation.

132
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:02,840
I’ll check the list here. Okay.

133
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,460
Military evasion, drugs, sexual favors.

134
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,890
The whole Republic of Korea is covered in corruption.

135
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,170
How many in total?

136
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:15,450
Related persons have 37 irregularities in military service, 50 are involved with drugs,

137
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,920
and 16 are involved in bribes with sexual favors.

138
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,010
In total, there are about 100 people on the list.

139
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:23,760
Of these, about 20 people are involved with SHC Entertainment.

140
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,620
Who do we have to take care of?

141
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,770
I think it’s a little over ten people, but it’ll be difficult to save all of them.

142
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:32,170
Especially for Assemblymen Kim and Yun who received attention at the hearing over sexual favors,

143
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:34,620
an investigation is inevitable.

144
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,740
What a waste.

145
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,280
- The press? 
 - It'll be hard to stop.

146
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:43,000
Assemblyman Hwang's comments are spreading quickly over the internet.

147
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,640
I see.

148
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,130
Then let the media do what they want instead of stopping.

149
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,790
I'm sure Assemblyman Hwang thought

150
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:55,070
that the revelation cut off my limbs.

151
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:58,020
But his judgment is faulty.

152
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:02,300
This incident will make me even stronger.

153
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,850
Only some of the contents of Hwang Jin Yong's list have been revealed.

154
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:10,750
All the guilty ones are probably feeling nervous right now,

155
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:15,670
wondering whether their names are on the list or not.

156
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,740
Tell the people on this list

157
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,770
that if they want to live, come see me.

158
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,540
Yes, sir.

159
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,740
- Connect me to Kim Seok Hun. 
 - Yes, sir.

160
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:36,570
Yes, Assemblyman. I understand. I'll do that.

161
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,140
- Prepare a press conference. 
 - What?

162
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:44,820
Our office will take over the investigation of Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong's list.

163
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,090
Not the Eastern District Prosecutors' Office?

164
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:50,150
They are only going to investigate the SHC Entertainment case.

165
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,630
Yes, sir.

166
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:56,570
Tell all the reporters that we'll tell them everything Assemblyman Hwang didn't get to say.

167
00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:00,970
- Yes, sir. 
 - It’s a golden opportunity to change the negative opinion about the prosecution.

168
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:04,180
We’ll be busy for a while. Get ready for it.

169
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:07,310
Oh, and also investigate Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong.

170
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:11,060
Whether there were any illegal actions taken in order to get his hands on the list.

171
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,000
You get my meaning?

172
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,950
Yes, sir.

173
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:18,040
Then get to work. Also,

174
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,780
tell Kang Jin to come see me as soon as he gets back.

175
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,860
Yes, sir.

176
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,490
Our district office took over the investigation of the list.

177
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:42,440
You're also going to be investigated on how you got that list.

178
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,650
That was expected.

179
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:50,620
Yes. But, it was Jo Tae Seop who gave the order.

180
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,990
What? Jo Tae Seop?

181
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:55,340
So he did...

182
00:10:55,340 --> 00:11:00,410
 It wouldn't be enough for him to stop the investigation, but he ordered it? 

183
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:03,530
Jo Tae Seop did...

184
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,130
Yes.

185
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,490
 Again My Life 

186
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:13,880
Have you come to your senses now?

187
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,420
Sunbae, please save me.

188
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:22,340
I never thought the Eastern District Prosecutors' Office would target my father's company since I was focused on Kim Hui Wu and the Gimsan gang.

189
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:26,470
Launching a sneak attack by using his university colleague...

190
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:29,970
As expected, Kim Hui Wu is smart.

191
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,270
So, what did you do with Jo Yun Ah?

192
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:38,320
I managed to calm her down and hid her away, but it won't last long.

193
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,550
If she decides to talk, there's nothing I can do to stop her.

194
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,820
I'm sure.

195
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:47,770
The president of the production company who made her take propofol habitually by using plastic surgery as bait

196
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:53,780
and used that against her for sexual favors.

197
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:58,020
And the prosecutor who kept all that under wraps.

198
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:03,740
It's perfect gossip for busybodies.

199
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,420
I wanted Kim Hui Wu to end up here with me,

200
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,570
- but it looks like you might. 
 - Sunbae!

201
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:15,540
I hear you perfectly well, so don't yell, you bastard.

202
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,980
Sunbae, you won't be able to get out if I end up here, too.

203
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:23,950
If you help me out this once,  I swear that I'll get you out.

204
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,430
Well, there is one solution.

205
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,460
 There is only one person who can save you now. 

206
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,680
  You know it's not free, right? 

207
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,670
 Don't try to pull one on me and do it properly. 

208
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,180
 How could this happen out of the blue? 

209
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,670
- Who knew? 
- Goodness.

210
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,730
Assemblyman Jang!

211
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:14,770
How did this happen?

212
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:28,130
The ones in power who came to see the assemblyman are here to save themselves.

213
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:31,460
Thanks to Assemblyman Hwang, the assemblyman has become more powerful.

214
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:39,890
 I think citizen distrust of leadership will continue to grow. 

215
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:44,130
 There are sexual favor scandals and military corruption. 

216
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:48,550
 I wish lawmakers and assemblymen would be a little more ethical in their actions. 

217
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:51,190
There's been a commotion all day.

218
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:54,630
I apologize. Since you instructed us not to respond to the media—

219
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:57,460
No. You did well.

220
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:00,650
The media wants to do their part, so let's just leave them alone for now.

221
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:05,410
Thanks to them, weeding becomes easier.

222
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:12,540
I never thought Assemblyman Hwang would end up helping me.

223
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,060
With real cooperation over this incident...

224
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,640
the parties will become united.

225
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,380
- Should I go welcome the guests? 
 - Yes.

226
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,550
I mean seriously. Look at what happened to him.

227
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:31,920
I told you.

228
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,760
I'm watching intently.

229
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,360
Sinners should not be standing!

230
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:54,680
Should I stop them for you?

231
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,510
Answer me! Should I stop them?

232
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,700
Yes.

233
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:06,260
- Assemblyman Kim. 
 - Yes?

234
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,690
How did you get here?

235
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,660
Wh-Wh-What happened was—

236
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,600
Are you too embarrassed to even say it?

237
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:20,770
If you know to feel shame, how could you give in to momentary pleasure so easily?

238
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:23,130
It was my mistake.

239
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:27,890
- Assemblymen Jang and Park! 
 - Yes.

240
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,930
Didn't you oppose my bill last time?

241
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,040
It'll never happen again.

242
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,080
- Never. 
 - Please forgive us.

243
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,840
Do you understand what a politically sensitive and dangerous time this is?

244
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:46,320
For the nation to properly function, the politicians must come to their senses!

245
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,870
Is being a representative of the people something to take so lightly?

246
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,320
- I'm sorry. 
 - I was wrong 
 - I apologize.

247
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,330
Regardless of political party, aren't we all the people who should be leading the country?

248
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,330
I've debated it all day.

249
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:05,000
How I should save you all, who have worked with me to serve this country.

250
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,430
My conclusion is that true cooperation and

251
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:12,420
sincere public service. Only people who

252
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:16,020
pledge this will have their names removed from the list.

253
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,180
Thank you.

254
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:21,410
But! I can't save all of you.

255
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:24,450
If I did that, the people wouldn't trust us.

256
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,550
Some of you need to be prepared.

257
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,440
Don't feel resentful. Instead, do some self-reflection.

258
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,850
I hope that you think of it as you having saved another.

259
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:35,680
I, Jo Tae Seop, promise you.

260
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,870
The people who have sacrificed for the greater good,

261
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:44,260
I'll take care of you until the end.

262
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,360
Call Kim Seok Hun here.

263
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,530
Yes, sir.

264
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,430
I'm sorry.

265
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:18,500
 It feels ominous. 

266
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,160
We've only just begun. Why are you putting a damper on it?

267
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,620
I went to see a doctor involved in the military service evasion to secure him as a witness.

268
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,320
Wasn't that doctor going to testify?

269
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,560
Yes, but I can't get in touch with him.

270
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,930
What did you say?

271
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:33,990
The hospital says he's away on vacation, and his family says he's away attending a seminar.

272
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:39,650
He was definitely working at the hospital to yesterday but suddenly disappeared.

273
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,620
Let's check the departures list tomorrow.

274
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,850
Since it happened today, he couldn't have gone far.

275
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,690
We should double check our witnesses, too.

276
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:50,090
Don't worry, I'll make sure to take care of it.

277
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:55,490
Choi Kang Jin's arrest warrant came out. I'll summon him tomorrow.

278
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,960
Gyu Ri, don't be mistaken. Choi Kang Jin is not an easy target.

279
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,200
Sunbae, I'm not that easy to deal with either.

280
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,500
I'm already looking forward to whatever scheme Choi Kang Jin will come up with.

281
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:22,070
I'm offended. I don't like people who show up without an appointment.

282
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:24,760
I apologize for offending you.

283
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,550
This is the price of my life.

284
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,890
Please take a look and make your judgment.

285
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,630
I'll look at it later.

286
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:48,790
Do you want to live?

287
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:53,130
Then bring your father's head.

288
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:14,130
- Choi Kang Jin. 
 - Chief Prosecutor!

289
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:19,080
- Did you come to beg for your life? 
 - It ended up that way.

290
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,660
How dare you come here?

291
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,740
The assemblyman is waiting for you.

292
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:31,780
Come to my office as soon as you get to work tomorrow.

293
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:46,090
- You only need to investigate the people on this list.
 - Yes.

294
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:49,240
-  I'll take care of the rest. 
 - Yes, sir.

295
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,390
Prosecutor Choi Kang Jin stopped by.

296
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,110
Yes. I met him outside.

297
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,270
He was really scared.

298
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:59,470
I apologize. It was disrespectful to you.

299
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,640
It's not that.

300
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,820
He must have been feeling desperate to come looking for me.

301
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,700
- Yes, sir. 
 - I gave him an assignment.

302
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,740
So make your decision after checking that assignment.

303
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:16,060
Whether I can use him instead of Jang Il Hyeon.

304
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:21,990
Now his life is in your hands.

305
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:26,670
You decide whether to end him or to let him live.

306
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,870
Yes, sir.

307
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,730
You should have come to me first.

308
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:35,120
I apologize. I was in a rush.

309
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,040
So, you went to see Jo Tae Seop directly?

310
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,930
I'm so sorry.

311
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,020
I won't let you off twice.

312
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:48,010
Yes, it won't happen again.

313
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:54,130
I need to teach you a lesson first. The Eastern District Prosecutors' Office has a warrant, so answer the summons.

314
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:55,070
Chief Prosecutor...

315
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:57,220
I just got off the phone with the East District Chief Prosecutor.

316
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,970
Before that, you need to keep the promise you made to Jo Yun Ah.

317
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:03,180
Yes, sir.

318
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:06,170
And I've already spoken to my father.

319
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,990
Come in.

320
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,300
 List of children of high-ranking officials for corruption in military enlistment 

321
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:42,500
 Among the people Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong exposed,  

322
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:47,710
 the most important figures have been excluded.  

323
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:50,270
 This is a list with only the minor players who've been abandoned. 

324
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:54,120
Make sure to punish those on the list.

325
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:57,580
- Yes, but...
 - What is it?

326
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,690
It seems to be different than what Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong revealed.

327
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:06,400
Assemblyman Hwang only brought up the suspicion. All we need to do is investigate the facts.

328
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,940
If there is an omission, there must be a reason for it.

329
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:12,180
Stop questioning it and proceed.

330
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,500
- Yes, sir. 
- You can leave.

331
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:45,560
Is Kim Gyu Ri the prosecutor who issued my arrest warrant?

332
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,060
Is that right?

333
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,120
Isn't it amazing?

334
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,000
As soon as Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong exposed the list,

335
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,520
the Eastern District Prosecutors' Office went into action. That means

336
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:00,420
the investigation into this matter had already been under way.

337
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:06,190
Who possibly could have given the list to Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong?

338
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:09,340
I’m planning to find out. The chief prosecutor instructed me to as well.

339
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:11,640
You're smarter than that.

340
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,500
It's obvious. It must have leaked from the Eastern District Prosecutors' Office.

341
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:20,790
Or someone tipped off Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong and the Eastern District Prosecutors' Office at the same time.

342
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:26,100
If you're curious to know, I will report back to you after I carry out the investigation.

343
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,890
Okay. Make sure you do.

344
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:30,500
Yes, sir.

345
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:56,460
This is the indictment filed by prosecutor Choi Kang Jin against Choi Soo Hyeok, the CEO of SHC Entertainment.

346
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,860
He saved himself by giving up his father.

347
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,290
What happened to the witnesses?

348
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:05,480
The doctor who was involved in the military service evasion corruption left the country today.

349
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:10,010
And on the sexual favor matter, I’m in the process of contacting the celebrities and wanna-be celebrities involved.

350
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:14,320
They're young people with dreams. Support them well so that they don't raise any issues.

351
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,150
Yes, sir. I'll get them to settle for a transfer of agency or cancellation of penalty for breach of contract.

352
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:19,590
Okay.

353
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:23,210
Since it's such a sensational issue, it may be hard to cover up.

354
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:26,720
We'll have a plan B ready using what prosecutor Choi Kang Jin gave us.

355
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,740
- Have you gathered the representatives from both parties without the press? 
- Yes, sir.

356
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,360
Let's go.

357
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:40,910
The sky is very clear today.

358
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,300
Let's go.

359
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:39,430
Hello, sir.

360
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:41,900
Please take a seat.

361
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,690
The moment we have to work together has finally come.

362
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:53,320
Thanks to Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong, the country is up in arms.

363
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,290
I'm sure you've all heard already.

364
00:25:56,290 --> 00:26:00,560
I've been turning the nation's attention to other things for the time being.

365
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:04,510
But you can't cover the sky with your palm.

366
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:10,910
Before I got here, I tried to cover the sky with my hand because it was so bright out.

367
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:17,450
But the light came through. I couldn't help but see the sunlight coming through my fingers.

368
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:23,550
A question here. Is there a way to cover the sky with the palm of your hand?

369
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:31,860
Yes, if you take a palm

370
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,650
and cover both eyes.

371
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:39,640
Then you can't see the sky even if you tried.

372
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:45,600
So, have you found a way to soothe the exploding public sentiment?

373
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:51,580
Turn people's attention to problems that affect their livelihood!

374
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:55,860
Leak it out to reporters that you're working on a bill that will raise taxes significantly.

375
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,990
Raising cigarettes' or soju prices are all good.

376
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:00,780
Tell them that you're raising the price of all goods.

377
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:06,590
Wouldn't raising taxes suddenly cause a revolt?

378
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:10,080
With the elections around the corner, I'm not telling you to actually raise the taxes.

379
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,040
Just spread the rumor is what I'm saying!

380
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:17,060
So you're saying we should shift the focus from corruption to taxes, right?

381
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,940
That's right!

382
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:22,980
Why do you think people are paying attention to Hwang Jin Yong’s list right now?

383
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:27,480
You're saying it's because they don't have immediate worries?

384
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,100
Finally, we're seeing eye to eye.

385
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:36,420
When public opinion turns its attention to taxes, we will not increase them but reduce them.

386
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:40,250
The central objective of our party is to lower taxes!

387
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:42,770
Yes. Do you get it now?

388
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:45,150
I'm suggesting that we change the focus.

389
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:49,990
Then the problematic kids of all the assemblymen will be forgotten.

390
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:54,720
Ah! And in the next nomination, don't include anyone who was caught in the corruption.

391
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,790
It's best to leave any flaws behind.

392
00:27:56,790 --> 00:28:01,730
Since a new administration is going to be in office anyway, let's change the political circle.

393
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:05,350
- Okay? 
 - Yes, sir.

394
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:08,400
You’re making a big mistake right now.

395
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,670
A mistake?

396
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:12,250
Prosecutors don’t punish innocent people.

397
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:15,610
We only punish criminals who have sinned.

398
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,610
Hey Kim Gyu Ri! Watch it. It sounds like you're talking about me.

399
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:25,830
Watch yourself, too. In here, I'm not Kim Gyu Ri but Prosecutor Kim Gyu Ri.

400
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:28,440
I don’t know why you're suddenly targeting me,

401
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,380
but you're making a huge mistake right now.

402
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:35,230
You’re the one who made the mistake.

403
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,600
You’re going to regret it soon.

404
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:41,070
People who are guilty talk more. You also have too much to say.

405
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:43,680
Watch yourself or you'll get hurt.

406
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,770
Let’s start the interrogation.

407
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:50,450
Go ahead, Prosecutor Kim.

408
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:51,820
Mr. Choi Kang Jin,

409
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:58,220
did you ever arrange a meeting between politicians and artists from SHC Entertainment?

410
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,480
I've never done that.

411
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,990
What favor did you receive in exchange for gifting sexual favors?

412
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,160
I have nothing to do with gifting sexual favors.

413
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,330
I've never even been interested in the entertainment business.

414
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:12,020
Many of the celebrities in the agency said they know you.

415
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:14,550
Really? Who? Bring them here.

416
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:16,720
Mr. Choi Kang Jin.

417
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:38,650
 Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office 

418
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:42,780
Why do my ominous premonitions always prove themselves right?

419
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:47,030
That doctor related to military corruption left Korea early this morning.

420
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,980
 Certificate of Entry &amp; Exit 

421
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:53,320
That was quick. This means he took action right after the scandal broke.

422
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,750
That means he has someone big behind him.

423
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,960
That's right.

424
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,290
That's one thing. Gyu Ri must be panicking too.

425
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:05,540
- Panicking? 
 - Oh my, you didn't know?

426
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:08,420
Search Jo Yun Ah online.

427
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:17,560
 Jo Yun Ah, beautiful farewell with SHC Entertainment 

428
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:24,300
Everyone on our team got sucker punched.

429
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:27,380
Why? Do you have a problem too?

430
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,280
 List of children of high-ranking officials suspected of corruption in military enlistment 

431
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,350
 Kim Hyeon Su, National Assembly. Second son. Exempted 

432
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:41,470
- Hey, this is... 
 - Yeah. They left us with a shell.

433
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:47,600
It's such a disgusting world.

434
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:56,250
I expected this, but it's worse than I thought.

435
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:59,820
I thought I'd at least be able to cut the tail off, but I couldn't even do that.

436
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,720
They're all nobodies.

437
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:08,200
I didn't do all that just to see these no-name players get locked up.

438
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,630
I'm sorry.

439
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:13,110
No, you have nothing to be sorry about.

440
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:18,440
I expected this from the moment you handed me the list.

441
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:24,410
Jo Tae Seop already took over the mass media, and knows how to use it as well.

442
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:28,580
He also knows how to cover the citizens' eyes, and how to block their ears.

443
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,760
I understand how you feel, sir.

444
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,940
However, please wait just a little while.

445
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:38,420
I'll arrest every one of those who escaped.

446
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:43,530
After seeing the way Jo Tae Seop works, have you still not realized?

447
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:46,690
No matter how much you try to beat him with your strength,

448
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:53,450
it's useless until the rotten prosecutor's office is completely replaced.

449
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,340
We need time.

450
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:03,630
We're going to bring down a huge dam with a small crack.

451
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:08,260
Your help is vital to make it happen.

452
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,850
Now is the beginning.

453
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:15,490
Prosecutor Kim, are you just brave or reckless?

454
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:18,740
I only make promises I can keep.

455
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:21,720
I will reveal Jo Tae Seop's real identity to the world.

456
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:26,220
I'll also be sure to make him pay for his crimes too.

457
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:29,930
I hope it's a promise you can keep.

458
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:35,760
To be honest, I don't have much time left in the political field.

459
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,310
Do you think you can succeed within that time?

460
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,710
It's more than enough time.

461
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:46,670
I don't like the prosecutor's office, but I feel like I can trust you.

462
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:05,910
I don't like politicians, but I also feel like I can trust you.

463
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,470
One more!

464
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:24,200
Gyu Ri, calm down. You must be very upset.

465
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,530
She's not upset, she's livid.

466
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:28,450
I know.

467
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:30,060
Leave me alone tonight

468
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,610
since I'm feeling destructive.

469
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:36,980
If you say that in front of the braised chicken, you'll startle it.

470
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:39,550
Of course sir, braised chicken is the way to go.

471
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:42,090
Gyu Ri, where are your manners?

472
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:44,660
As I expected, you are my son.

473
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,540
How many sons do you have?

474
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,470
You said Sang Man was your son too last time.

475
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:51,030
Anyone who likes braised chicken is my son.

476
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:55,620
- What about Hui Wu? 
 - We'll kick him off our family tree since he likes pork belly, and Min Su, who knows braised chicken is the way to go, will be...

477
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:58,370
He said he liked beef last time.

478
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,730
Beef?

479
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:01,650
Min Su, what is this?

480
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:03,210
Did you betray me by any chance?

481
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:05,800
Gyu Ri, it's not right for you to frame me like this.

482
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,580
I am a prosecutor who only speaks the truth, sir.

483
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,880
I ate chicken porridge this morning also.

484
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,390
Then, prove it.

485
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:13,330
Give us two more servings.

486
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:14,710
You are definitely my son.

487
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:15,950
Three additional servings please!

488
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:17,740
You are my best son.

489
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:20,270
- I hope you guys become my children soon too. 
 - Okay.

490
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:21,800
Three more servings!

491
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:34,470
 OPEN: 11:00 AM 
CLOSE: 10:00 PM 

492
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:37,320
 Sir, has the additional order finished cooking? 

493
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,830
I'm here.

494
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:41,390
Here's my savior.

495
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:42,460
Sorry I'm late.

496
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,420
It's okay.

497
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,520
Are you alright?

498
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:51,800
I should've thrown a resignation letter at the chief prosecutor.

499
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,950
Not enough evidence they said. The reason for Choi Kang Jin was acquittal.

500
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:58,520
I mean, how many more witnesses and pieces of evidence do they need?

501
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,410
 "If they committed a crime, I won't let it slide, even if it's family." 

502
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:05,440
 A true prosecutor, who indicted his own father's company, SHC Entertainment. 

503
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,710
 It is no other than Prosecutor Choi Kang Jin. 

504
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:11,880
 There are even talks that the anonymous informant who provided data to Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong 

505
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,390
 was Prosecutor Choi Kang Jin. 

506
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:17,260
Choi Kang Jin has become a hero.

507
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:21,290
Yeah. That bastard.

508
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:23,450
I'll get him.

509
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:30,130
Choi Kang Jin. I'll get him for you.

510
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:36,480
Now, now, you know that when our brother here says he'll get him, he will, right?

511
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,640
Now is not a time to be down.

512
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,680
We should be preparing for the second round.

513
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,920
At this point, haven't we become 'The Avengers' amongst prosecutors?

514
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,450
Now! Let's cheer up!

515
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:50,330
To eradicating evil!

516
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:52,530
Cheers!

517
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:54,490
♫  What kind of gang came at me?  ♫

518
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:57,100
♫  Stopped in your tracks  ♫

519

00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,340

528
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:31,420
Good!

529
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,910
Good job.

530
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:49,400
Hey, how could you throw me like that?

531
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:54,280
When did you get so good? Both of you are acting like you're in a real match.

532
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,720
It's thanks to Hui Wu.

533
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,170
I need a lot more training.

534
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:11,310
What brings you here...?

535
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:16,990
Have a good talk.

536
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:19,190
Yes, thank you.

537
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:28,300
Should I start exercising too?

538
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,870
Director, Hui Wu is really cool, don't you think?

539
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:32,170
It's good to see you taking care of yourself.

540
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:35,500
I can see that your actions at Gimsan weren't a coincidence.

541
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,250
I'm still far from perfect.

542
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,450
By the way, what brings you two here?

543
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:44,160
Where should I even start? The director said he wanted to see you since early this morning, so...

544
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,980
I barely managed to wash my face.

545
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:50,980
I came here because there are too many prying eyes at the prosecutor's office.

546
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:53,800
There are a few things I want to ask you.

547
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,790
I also have something to tell you.

548
00:37:55,790 --> 00:38:00,000
You go ahead. I think it'll be something I want to hear.

549
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,520
I met Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong yesterday.

550
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,590
Assemblyman Hwang?

551
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:10,840
As I expected. I was wondering where Assemblyman Hwang got such information to share.

552
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:16,310
In that case, the investigation of SHC Entertainment at the Eastern District Prosecutors' Office must be your work too.

553
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:20,070
Yes. I'm sorry I didn't tell you ahead of time.

554
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,890
It's okay.

555
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:25,900
I expected as much when you said you were going after Choi Su Hyeok first before going after Choi Kang Jin.

556
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:30,600
I was curious how you were going to go about it, because it hasn't been so long ago since you arrested Jang Il Hyeon.

557
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,280
Did you satisfy your curiosity?

558
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,460
But are you okay though?

559
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,290
Excuse me?

560
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:41,380
We heard the chief prosecutor gave you a list with only the no-name players on it.

561
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:46,050
Another chance will come by again. Catch your breath and wait for it.

562
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:49,590
Jang Il Hyeon, Choi Kang Jin... both of them suffered losses, big and small.

563
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:54,300
However, be careful. Kim Seok Hun may feel that something's off since he's quick-witted.

564
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,890
You need to control your pace.

565
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:59,900
Especially if your final goal is a bigger villain.

566
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,620
 He's sharp as expected. 

567
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:05,510
 He seems indifferent, but did he already know everything? 

568
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,370
Okay. I'll keep your words in mind.

569
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:15,940
I can tell you're well mannered and nice, but I can't tell what you're thinking.

570
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:19,710
If I could, I might be of some help, you know?

571
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:22,800
You two are already helping me a lot.

572
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,910
Really.

573
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:26,760
You can swear a bunch if you're angry.

574
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,560
It's pretty obvious that you're holding back your feelings.

575
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,760
I can see why you were sparring so fiercely this early.

576
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,580
You're the type of guy who can't just sit back after seeing someone who committed a crime.

577
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:38,430
Is it really that obvious?

578
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:41,540
- Yes, very much. 
 - Yes, very much.

579
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:57,770
Looking at your expression, it seems that things went well.

580
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,390
It's all thanks to you.

581
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,540
The answer to your survival is now out,

582
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:08,160
so you should keep the agreement you made with me.

583
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,030
Yes.

584
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:14,760
I'll get you on probation even if I have to kneel in front of that bastard Kim Hui Wu.

585
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,370
Good.

586
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,360
I trust you.

587
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:31,340
- Welcome back. 
 - Thanks.

588
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,480
Hui Wu.

589
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:42,470
Yes?

590
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:47,300
I know the Chief of Prosecutor made you take care of Seonbae Jang.

591
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:50,270
What can we do, but do as the higher-ups order us to?

592
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:54,980
You have to look after your own side. We're directly on the Chief Prosecutor's side.

593
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:59,750
We should support and help each other after what happened to Seonbae Jang.

594
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:02,280
- Don't you think? 
 - Yes.

595
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:06,370
So... I want to let Seonbae Jang out, no matter what it takes.

596
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:09,680
He can't go back to being a prosecutor even if he's released.

597
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,350
Isn't it a bit much to disqualify him from being a lawyer?

598
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:20,040
We used to work together, so it's not right for us to ruin his way of earning money, right?

599
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:23,410
Are you telling me to manipulate the evidence?

600
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:27,740
Hey! If you say that so directly, I'll look like a weirdo.

601
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,820
You're in charge of it,

602
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:36,210
so you could make a loophole in the paperwork to help him get out.

603
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:40,100
And then?

604
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,620
Why don't you concede this time around?

605
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:47,280
You can't?

606
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,960
No, never mind.

607
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,840
I don't want to dirty my junior's hands.

608
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:55,200
I'll take care of it. Go on with your business.

609
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:11,410
Jang Il Hyeon wants to be a lawyer?

610
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:21,000
I'm going to end Jang Il Hyeon for good.

611
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:24,190
 Southern Detention Center 

612
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:28,140
If you came here to talk about Jang Il Hyeon, I'm done.

613
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:33,320
That's too bad. I came to help you.

614
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,580
Get to the point.

615
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:40,300
Aren't you curious?

616
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:46,330
The reason why Jang II Hyeon made his betrothed Seong Jin Mi into a liar and con artist.

617
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:50,450
I was tricked by Chairwoman Seong Jin Mi.

618
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:55,420
How do you think I knew about the corruption of the National Foundation for the Arts University? It was all fabricated.

619
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:57,930
Are you referring to the National Foundation for the Arts University embezzlement?

620
00:42:57,930 --> 00:42:59,510
I've been used is all.

621
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:03,300
Ms. Seong Jin Mi claimed that she used the embezzled money together with you.

622
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:07,400
I didn't know. I was only used by that woman.

623
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,890
 Ms. Seong Jin Mi used you? What does that mean? 

624
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:13,320
It's because he knows. If he puts the crime on your shoulders,

625
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:17,470
he knows that the weight of his crime becomes lighter.

626
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:21,410
Now, by flipping that,

627
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:25,950
if you put your crime on his shoulders, what would happen?

628
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,640
It'll make your own shoulders lighter, right?

629
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:34,060
You're saying you'll help me?

630
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:38,690
I'm sick and tired of prosecutors,

631
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:41,150
but I am curious what kind of help you would be.

632
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:44,090
Come to the prosecutor's office tomorrow to be interrogated.

633
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:45,740
Okay.

634
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:48,460
Ms. Seong Jin Mi, Ms. Seong Jin Mi, let me ask just one question!

635
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:51,050
What do you think of the scandal between you and former prosecutor Jang Il Hyeon?!

636
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:54,160
There's a rumor that you two agreed to be married. What's the truth on that!?

637
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:57,050
Former Prosecutor Jang Il Hyeon said that he was only used by you.

638
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:59,290
Is there anything you want to say?

639
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:08,870
 - Do the same thing. 
 - What do you mean? 

640
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:13,460
  Copy what Jang Il Hyeon did. 

641
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:15,530
 "Jang Il Hyeon made me do everything." 

642
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:19,970
Prosecutor Jang Il Hyeon made me do everything.

643
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:23,840
 "However, Jang Il Hyeon is not to blame." 

644
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:26,370
However, Prosecutor Jang Il Hyeon is not to blame.

645
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:28,700
 "I'm the sinner for not being able to stop him." 

646
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,870
I'm the sinner for not being able to stop him.

647
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:34,280
 "I thought that was love."  
 - I thought that was love.

648
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,980
 "Also..."  
 - Also...

649
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:37,860
 Cry. 

650
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:40,360
I'm sorry.

651
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:47,820
Are you pregnant by any chance?

652
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:52,490
Does Prosecutor Jang Il Hyeon know about it?

653
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:04,000
 The rest will be taken care of by the media. 

654
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:10,000
 Sponsor Prosecutor Jang Il Hyeon / Prosecutor's Office Ethics Flawed / Shameless Prosecutor Used Pregnant Fiancée to Negotiate Sentence 

655
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:14,500
Come in.

656
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:20,030
- You wanted to see me? 
  Under allegations of bribery, 

657
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:22,760
 under the act on the aggravated punishment of specific crimes,  

658
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:25,030
 former Prosecutor Jang Il Hyeon's additional crimes are being revealed one by one. 

659
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:27,170
 During this, Seong Jin Mi, the chairwoman of the National Foundation for the Arts University,  

660
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:31,620
 who attended the prosecutor's witness interrogation, revealed a shocking fact. 

661
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:34,750
 While the ethics of the prosecutor's office are once again being questioned, 

662
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:38,590
 it remains to be seen how this will affect the outcome of the trial. 

663
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:43,380
The public opinion isn't good. Stop dragging it out,

664
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,060
and finish Jang Il Hyeon's trial as soon as possible.

665
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:47,330
Okay, understood.

666
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:57,390
Using the title of prosecutor,

667
00:45:57,390 --> 00:46:01,590
the defendant Jang Il Hyeon is charged with accepting bribes

668
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:06,750
and turning a blind eye and taking part in his fiancée, National Arts Foundation Chairman Seong Jin Mi's

669
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:08,540
illegal activities.

670
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:14,540
The court will hereby sentence him to seven years in prison

671
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:18,350
for violation of the Act on Aggravated Punishment, etc.,

672
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:22,570
and violating the Act on the Prohibition of Illegal Solicitation and Acceptance of Money, etc

673
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:24,260
 Seven years? 

674
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:32,000
He needs more than seven years!

675
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:43,960
Let go. Let go!

676
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:08,890
Kim Hui Wu... get him.

677
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,860
Thank you Kim Hui Wu, for getting rid of Seonbae Jang.

678
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:26,090
Thanks to you, I've gained wings.

679
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:31,470
Is there still nothing from Kim Yong Jin?

680
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:33,280
Not yet.

681
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:38,060
If he can't find the answer, I should give him a hint.

682
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:41,930
Open the gift bag that Choi Kang Jin brought.

683
00:47:41,930 --> 00:47:44,220
Yes, sir.

684
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:56,860
It becomes quite a bit expensive if it's within a week, will that be okay?

685
00:47:56,860 --> 00:48:01,400
Understood. We'll lead a real-time response as well.

686
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:06,420
You're working overtime for this coming week.

687
00:48:12,830 --> 00:48:16,160
 Chaebol C's shocking fact! Affair with a top actress? 

688
00:48:30,830 --> 00:48:33,600
Office Manager Park, is there something going on?

689
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,520
The ward atmosphere is a bit strange today.

690
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:38,230
Rumors about your brother are being spread indiscriminately

691
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:40,540
on social media and in the mass media.

692
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:42,090
Oppa?

693
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:44,280
Don't look. It'll calm down soon.

694
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:47,400
It's family business. I should at least know what it's about.

695
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:52,530
"The Scene of the Successor of Company C and Actress A's Affair"?

696
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,580
This is a video.

697
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:57,220
This isn't just a tabloid.

698
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:00,820
I think your oldest brother was illegally filmed.

699
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:04,880
Prevent the newspapers from going into father's room.

700
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,770
And tell him that the TV is being fixed for a moment.

701
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:09,990
He can't find out about this.

702
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,720
Nuna, you are here.

703
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:23,070
- When did you get here? 
 - Just a moment ago.

704
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:25,250
I had something to report to father.

705
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:27,360
Father, I'll head out now.

706
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,950
Okay.

707
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:39,800
Hui Ah, start going to the group management planning office starting tomorrow.

708
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:43,560
Don't say you don't want to, and don't say you can't. Just do as I say.

709
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:46,080
Dad, I told you already.

710
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:50,430
- I just want to be a family member– 
 - I'm telling you because you are family!

711
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:53,110
The so-called directors are busy checking on what Yong Jun wants,

712
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:56,580
and Seong Jun, that boy is just drooling, looking to see if there's anything to eat up off the ground.

713
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:58,800
Who do you think can stop them?

714
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:03,300
I'm not saying this out of anger, I'm speaking with reason.

715
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,320
Hui Ah!

716
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:09,700
I'll do it.

717
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:13,600
I'll participate in management.

718
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,200
It's been a while.

719
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:32,400
So that's how you feel.

720
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,780
I always felt as if you were with me the whole time.

721
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:41,930
Monks shave their heads when they leave behind worldly desires.

722
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:45,600
So I'm here to do that.

723
00:50:47,450 --> 00:50:49,070
You.

724
00:50:50,170 --> 00:50:52,830
I'm here to say goodbye.

725
00:50:52,830 --> 00:50:55,010
As a friend.

726
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:57,350
I thought about you from time to time.

727
00:50:57,350 --> 00:51:00,930
"What would have Hui Wu done in this situation?"

728
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,520
But I'm going to stop now.

729
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,790
I wanted to come back to an ordinary life,

730
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:16,030
have a drink like ordinary people, argue like everyone,

731
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:21,900
and become happy when a guy buys me a stuffed animal on the street.

732
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:24,450
I wanted an ordinary life like that.

733
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:28,650
But I don't think that's possible now.

734
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:45,050
Bye.

735
00:51:45,050 --> 00:51:46,670
Okay.

736
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,090
Kim Hui Ah.

737
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:35,280
If you get upset, unload on this guy. And you just be yourself.

738
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:40,510
Okay.

739
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:44,050
When things are tough, come to me. I'll buy you another one.

740
00:52:45,770 --> 00:52:47,560
Thanks.

741
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:50,350
I'll get going then.

742
00:52:50,350 --> 00:52:52,010
Okay.

743
00:54:12,110 --> 00:54:13,760
How could you do this, you jerk?

744
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:14,750
Get your hands off me!

745
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:15,810
Hey! Kim Seung Jun!

746
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:18,440
Oppa, calm down. The housekeepers will hear you.

747
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:20,420
I don't care about people's opinions of me right now.

748
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:23,320
Dad must have scolded you, but don't fool yourself.

749
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:27,640
He was bound to find out. I only told him because it would be better coming from his son, than a random stranger.

750
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,210
I knew Nuna wouldn't tell him about that.

751
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:31,770
Come on, Oppa. Let go of him. Let's talk it out.

752
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:33,720
Oppa.

753
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:37,970
Family? You don't think I know you've been meeting recently with the shareholders?

754
00:54:37,970 --> 00:54:40,200
What? Is someone backing you?

755
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:42,590
I'm working hard for our company. Don't accuse me of that.

756
00:54:42,590 --> 00:54:44,340
You're the one who messed up.

757
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:46,460
Do you know how much our stock price plummeted?

758
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:47,270
What?

759
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:50,140
Besides, you don't have any right to say that to me.

760
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:53,140
You haven't done anything to help the company. You're just a risk to the company.

761
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:54,310
Kim Seung Jun, you...

762
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:56,160
Oppa.

763
00:55:05,490 --> 00:55:07,160
Yes.

764
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:09,540
What?

765
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:12,280
Okay.

766
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,110
Hey, Kim Hui Ah. Are you really the new director of Management and Planning?

767
00:55:17,110 --> 00:55:18,130
What?

768
00:55:18,130 --> 00:55:20,180
Nuna. Is that true?

769
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:21,070
Yes.

770
00:55:21,070 --> 00:55:23,540
Is this Father's doing?

771
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:24,350
Yes.

772
00:55:24,350 --> 00:55:26,330
You said you weren't interested in management.

773
00:55:26,330 --> 00:55:27,890
Now, I am.

774
00:55:27,890 --> 00:55:29,360
Are you challenging me?

775
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:32,110
Yes. I want to work together with you.

776
00:55:32,110 --> 00:55:34,850
I'll help you. I'll cooperate,

777
00:55:34,850 --> 00:55:36,590
so you can do a good job.

778
00:55:36,590 --> 00:55:38,540
Forget it.

779
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:42,030
I'll see you at work.

780
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:45,210
Oppa.

781
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:47,930
You're scary, Nuna.

782
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:50,320
Seung Jun.

783
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:27,310
Should I drive you home, sir?

784
00:56:27,310 --> 00:56:29,140
Yes.

785
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,130
No.

786
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:45,630
My apologies for my late introduction.

787
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:47,410
That's understandable.

788
00:56:47,410 --> 00:56:49,420
Sit down.

789
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:16,730
Have some tea.

790
00:57:16,730 --> 00:57:18,760
This is the perfect temperature.

791
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:20,980
Oh, okay.

792
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:28,200
In life, missing an opportunity's window can result in lowering its value.

793
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:30,140
Right.

794
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:39,080
So there is something I hope you can increase the value of.

795
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,400
What could that be?

796
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:43,790
Chunha Distributions is preparing to set up a premium outlet.

797
00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:44,940
And?

798
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:49,120
I want you to select the location for the outlet.

799
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,780
I'm just a politician. What do I know about land?

800
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:55,760
The general election is around the corner.

801
00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:00,840
Information on the location of the outlet will be very useful to your people.

802
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:05,350
I'm sure you want something from me. Go ahead and tell me.

803
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:12,340
I want to wash away the disgrace on my shoulders.

804
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:15,580
And I want to stay where I am.

805
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:17,660
Please help me.

806
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:23,030
I'm not interested in the outlet.

807
00:58:23,030 --> 00:58:25,440
You can pick the location of your choice.

808
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:30,200
But I heard Chunha Distribution will go through restructuring.

809
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,690
I want you to stop that.

810
00:58:32,690 --> 00:58:35,960
You might think that restructuring is a good option

811
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:40,450
to cut costs and get rid of freeloaders at the company.

812
00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:45,620
I want to join hands with those who have national interest in mind and who work for the country,

813
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:49,950
not those who view people as tools to further their personal gains.

814
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:54,780
And I believe someone similar ought to lead the company.

815
00:58:55,530 --> 00:58:57,750
Do you think you can do that?

816
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:05,630
If the answer is yes, I'll join hands with you.

817
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:15,460
He wants to wash away the disgrace?

818
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:18,690
He wants to stay where he is?

819
01:00:35,620 --> 01:00:41,130
Now that we've joined hands, I ought to grant him his wish.

820
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:48,020
Get ready. A great star

821
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:50,020
will fall soon.

822
01:00:50,970 --> 01:00:58,000

 The next target is Kim Hui Ah. 

831
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:39,310
 I set things up. 

832
01:01:39,310 --> 01:01:41,140
 What is it that you want? 

833
01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:42,750
 Look into Hui Wu. 

834
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:44,660
 Find out if he met with Assemblyman Jo. 

835
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:45,730
 Give me a bit more time. 

836
01:01:45,730 --> 01:01:48,560
 I will soon be able to keep my promise to you. 

837
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:51,240
 I'm asking for help one last time. 

838
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:53,670
 Start the investigation. 

839
01:01:53,670 --> 01:01:56,960
 I'm sorry about your father. 

840
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:59,830
 I see it as an opportunity. 

841
01:01:59,830 --> 01:02:01,470
 Let's bring down Kim Seok Hun.
