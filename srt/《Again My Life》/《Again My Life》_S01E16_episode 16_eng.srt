00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:35,960
 Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office 

7
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,490
What? You're declaring war on Jo Tae Seop?

8
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:42,000
- Yes. 
 - Are you crazy?

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,300
 Episode 16  
 So that's why all those ridiculous personnel transfer orders came about.

10
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,850
He's trying to isolate me.

11
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,640
It's a threat to stop right now.

12
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,250
But I won't stop.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,650
I'll keep going. Then ...

14
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:05,290
the answer will probably come from Jo Tae Seop's side.

15
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:09,240
No matter what the answer is, please don't try to stop me.

16
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,670
Crazy jerk. Are you really going to keep at it?

17
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:18,380
- Yes. 
 - Fine. What are you going to do moving forward?

18
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,710
I should release the things I have prepared.

19
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:26,010
- Is this it? 
 - Yes.

20
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:29,570
I prepared it ever since Sang Man acquired JQ Construction.

21
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:33,560
It's Sang Man's stock as well as the merger and acquisition documents.

22
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,630
It feels a bit empty since we're doing this without Sang Man.

23
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,460
He'll understand.

24
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:43,580
Cheonha will make the first official announcement.

25
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:50,010
You have to become the CEO and protect Cheonha.

26
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:53,180
Yes. I will.

27
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:59,580
It appears that Cheonha Group will be buying JQ Construction.

28
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,940
The CEO of JQ was Park Sang Man, right?

29
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:08,870
Then, this must also Kim Hui Wu's doing.

30
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,660
Summon Prosecutor General Yun Jong Gi.

31
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:18,270
I need Kim Hui Wu to learn about the world a bit more.

32
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,440
Train in America?

33
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,510
Yes. An order to go to the US for training came down.

34
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:28,170
It'll happen early next month. They tell me it will be a good opportunity for you.

35
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:34,920
I'll follow the orders. Please pass along the message that I will go to the US training.

36
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:41,780
What a nice world. A prosecutor orders the chief prosecutor around.

37
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,400
I understand.

38
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:51,260
Before I leave, I'll cut off Jo Tae Seop's right arm.

39
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:55,300
Could I ask you for a favor?

40
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:04,570
 Let's meet up. We can discuss Kim Hui Wu while we eat.  

41
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,940
Hold on.

42
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:18,320
If you are on your way to meet Chief Prosecutor Jeon Seok Gyu, talk with me first.

43
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:25,270
- What did you have to say? 
 - It was you, wasn't it?

44
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:28,030
The person who did that to Sang Man.

45
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:32,300
So, are you going to get revenge?

46
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:39,080
- Yes. 
- Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu. You need power to seek revenge.

47
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,420
Without power, there's nothing you can do.

48
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,420
That's for me to worry about.

49
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,940
Do it if you can.

50
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:51,710
The more you try, the more desperate you’ll feel.

51
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:55,330
Then you will feel powerless to do anything.

52
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:05,340
You're right. I'm already feeling that powerlessness.

53
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:11,730
So I'm going to stop being a prosecutor.

54
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:16,930
You used to be a prosecutor, so you must know well.

55
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:21,260
When a prosecutor has resolved to quit, he can catch anyone.

56
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:26,250
But, I couldn't catch Jo Tae Seop.

57
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:33,080
So, I've decided to give up on catching Jo Tae Seop.

58
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:37,780
But... the sword was drawn.

59
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:42,050
So I should at least chop something up.

60
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,770
 Breaking News: Investigation into the acquisition of helicopters for the army. The suspect is a broker named Kim. 

61
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,040
♫  Hey, you're so cold.  That evil leer  ♫

62
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,790
♫  You clearly intend something nasty  ♫

63
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:16,240
♫  Lie lie lie gradually it will come out  ♫

64
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,310
♫  Standing up better watch  ♫

65
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,610
♫  Gonna let you know  ♫

66
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:24,460
♫  You make me bad with cowardly words  ♫

67
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:28,360
  - Did we get good photos? 
 - Yes  

68
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,720
♫  Try Try Try  ♫

69
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,680

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,730
♫  standing up  ♫

71
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:38,470
In exactly an hour, every TV station will receive an original copy without your face blurred.

72
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:43,810
Your face will be made public.

73
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:49,510
Also, I enjoyed listening to your conversation with Jeong Seo Yeon.

74
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:54,680
The amounts you talked about were so astronomical that it would be enough to enrage the public.

75
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:00,470
There's even the image of you putting money in the trunk, so you have no way out now.

76
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,690
♫  Oh Bring it on Bring it on  ♫

77
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:08,790
♫  Bring it on Oh Yeah  ♫

78
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:17,660
I know that the bribe wasn't from a broker.

79
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:22,940
But you know, too, that this is a pretty good scenario.

80
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,190
I copied your style.

81
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:39,600
What? Do you think you can stop the media by putting pressure on them?

82
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,050
Get out of my way.

83
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:45,850
- Wait. 
 - Get out of my way, scumbag!

84
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,370
What now?

85
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,850
The cellphone is in my hand now. Huh?

86
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:15,930
You surely don't think that's everything I have on you.

87
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:24,290
Illegal loans through loan companies, manipulation of real estate speculation, assaulting landowners,

88
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:28,270
blackmailing various politicians and business leaders, money laundering,

89
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:34,320
that’s all the crimes on your shoulders.

90
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,080
You’ve always been the hunter, right?

91
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:56,420
Now see what it feels like

92
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,220
to be the prey.

93
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:08,260
 The prosecution plans to request an arrest warrant for Kim, the prime suspect, 
  - Sorry? Yes.

94
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:12,620
 who committed corruption during the process of introducing the army helicopter.  
- Yes.

95
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,140
Yes, I understand.

96
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,130
What's going on?

97
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,410
The informant said he would identify the broker next.

98
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:23,770
So, the media didn't know that he was Office Director Kim Jin Wu.

99
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,550
Tell them to take it down immediately!

100
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,430
Yes, sir.

101
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:32,030
Sir, it's Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu.

102
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,990
Did you manage to stop the media?

103
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:41,010
I wanted to send you on a trip to the US,

104
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,820
but it appears you didn’t want to go.

105
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:46,110
I don't like long flights.

106
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:49,940
If you had tried to send me somewhere closer, I would have happily gone.

107
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,640
Do you still intend to fight me?

108
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,010
Once you start, you have to see it to the end.

109
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:59,810
I’m in a different weight class. You’re making a mistake, Prosecutor Kim.

110
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:01,660
What if I'm not?

111
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:06,720
Why? Are you afraid of me?

112
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:12,650
Well, I don't need to know what you think.

113
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:15,340
Let me tell you what I think.

114
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:23,310
I put a collar around your faithful dog, Kim Jin Wu's neck.

115
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:26,880
He'll be arrested soon.

116
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,790
But, I'm curious.

117
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:35,260
Will your faithful dog keep his mouth shut until the end?

118
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,970
I imagine you’re also curious

119
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:44,440
whether that faithful dog will keep wagging his tail or betray you.

120
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:52,710
I’ll get you sooner or later. So be ready for it.

121
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:57,990
Don’t lay a finger on Director Kim!

122
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:04,000
Let's not say such conventional things when we have no good feelings towards one another.

123
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,260
Jin Wu, where is he now?

124
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,740
I can't reach him.

125
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,840
- Find him! Find him right now! 
 - Yes, sir.

126
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:38,080
 Arraignment 

127
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:44,970
 If you don't want to be prey, hunt. 

128
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:48,220
 Bite your master, Jo Tae Seop.  

129
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:53,820
 I'll wait at the cafe on the first floor. When you make up your mind, come down. 

130
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:07,700
 Arraignment 

131
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,590
I'll take responsibility for everything.

132
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:19,590
Sir, please change the world...

133
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:49,990
 Defense broker Kim, who was suspected of bribery, was found dead.  

134
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:55,000
 According to the police, Mr. Kim, jumped from a hotel in Ganghyeon-gu, Seoul, at around 7:30 pm today,  

135
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,920
 amid mounting pressure with the official launch of the prosecution's investigation. 

136
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:05,090
 Mr. Kim was part of a foreign company that was in the process of introducing a new military helicopter 

137
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:07,250
 to the defense department through lobbyists and was suspected of accepting money and valuables 

138
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:10,000
 from the agents to ensure 

139
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,340
  the purchase of such transport. 

140
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,200
Punk...

141
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,140
Why...

142
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,970
Why did you make that foolish decision?

143
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,350
I...

144
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,020
I...!

145
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,070
Jin Wu,

146
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:20,130
don’t snoop around here and there while on your way

147
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:24,900
and just follow the white light.

148
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,890
Just follow...

149
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,790
the white light.

150
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,590
 Again My Life 

151
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:57,540
 Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu 

152
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,210
What is this?

153
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:01,220
It's my resignation letter.

154
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,200
You know I can't go to the United States.

155
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,960
I understand.

156
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:19,840
Well done, Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu.

157
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:44,420
 Prosecutors' Oath 

158
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,250
Are you really leaving?

159
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,940
I made up my mind.

160
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,620
- Well done. 
 Daehan Party, Building a Better Korea 

161
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,870
Thank you.

162
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,500
Let me use my nomination rights.

163
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,060
I owe a debt. Just give me a throwaway nomination.

164
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:26,530
He just needs to run, that's all.

165
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:31,130
Oh! I would love for him to run in Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop's district.

166
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:36,870
Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop's district? That's going to be a definite loss then.

167
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,260
Sure. Please go ahead then.

168
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,820
But, who is it?

169
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,010
 I have a favor to ask.  

170
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:47,240
 - A favor? 
 - Yes.   

171
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:51,380
 It can be easy and also difficult.   

172
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,740
  Tell me.  

173
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,380
 I heard you have a nomination right. 

174
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,620
 Nomination right? 

175
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:02,800
 Yes, I do. And?  

176
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,980
 When I resign from being a prosecutor,  

177
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:09,800
 please nominate me. 

178
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:14,260
  Are you serious?   

179
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,120
 Yes.  

180
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:21,130
 Even if you’re nominated, there’s no guarantee you’ll win.  

181
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:26,770
  Sir, I don't want be a lawmaker.  

182
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:31,230
 I want to catch Jo Tae Seop. 

183
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:34,590
 Please nominate me in the same district as Jo Tae Seop.  

184
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:39,060
You don’t need to know who it is. Will you give it to me or not?!

185
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:43,960
In Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop's District! Work hard.

186
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,350
Are you saying Hwang Jin Yong nominated him?

187
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:54,100
Okay. All right.

188
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,810
Kim Hui Wu is my opponent.

189
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,000
How cute. Call him and tell him that I'd like to have lunch with him tomorrow.

190
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,840
I will.

191
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:15,510
You're going too far. You can stop joking now.

192
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:19,500
Joke? It's not a joke.

193
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:26,960
We both can't stand the sight of each other, so I'm sure you didn't call me to have lunch.

194
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,350
Let's get to the point.

195
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,800
Why did you call me?

196
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:36,400
I was really curious as to why you're after me.

197
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,480
Why do you think?

198
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:43,300
I want to bring you down since you're a criminal, that's all.

199
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,020
I wanted to do that as a prosecutor,

200
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,180
but I couldn't do it.

201
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,800
Do you think you can bring me down?

202
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,230
Why couldn't I?

203
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,560
You resemble me.

204
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:00,230
I’m sure you don’t want to hear this, but you're a lot like me.

205
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:03,240
You remind me of my days as a prosecutor.

206
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:08,270
I gave up being a prosecutor for a similar reason.

207
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,850
I'm glad to hear that.

208
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:14,760
I thought I had to turn into someone like you in order to bring you down.

209
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,900
You can't do it. Why?

210
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,930
You don't have power. Get that first.

211
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:27,140
Invest five, ten years in your election, and re-election, and gain political influence.

212
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,290
Then you will have the power to bring me down.

213
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:34,680
I'll help you get that power to bring me down.

214
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:40,520
I’m a man who values ability. And I hope your ability is used to build a strong nation.

215
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:45,160
After that, I don’t care if you bring me down.

216
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,850
If that's for the sake of the country.

217
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:58,090
Ah, you are severely delusional.

218
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:03,720
I'm sure you know that my goal is not politics better than anyone.

219
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:11,240
I'm going to make sure to bring you down.

220
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,150
Director Kim Jin Wu.

221
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,610
How did he look in his last moment?

222
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,790
You must already know.

223
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:05,390
There's no way for you to win against him.

224
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:11,980
It's a fight between a tiger and a rabbit. It's not too late to... ask for forgiveness.

225
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:17,970
I have three questions for you.

226
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:23,870
One. Would he leave me alone if I gave up?

227
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:29,580
Two. Do I look like a rabbit?

228
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:35,800
Three. Why are you telling me this now?

229
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:40,240
I believe that there needs to be someone like you, that's all.

230
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:47,460
So let me tell you something, too.

231
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:53,060
You’re preparing something to catch Jo Tae Seop, aren't you?

232
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,360
Don't do it.

233
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,440
You'll die, Manager Han.

234
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,350
It's out of concern.

235
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:14,280
I don’t want anyone else to get hurt or die anymore.

236
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,740
Just watch. I'll catch him.

237
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:24,870
That was our agreement.

238
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,810
Though, you may not remember it.

239
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:37,530
I’d like to see you in private. If you believe what I'm saying, call me.

240
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:03,930
Kim Hui Wu is quite impressive. I was afraid Jin Wu might have died because of a lightweight.

241
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:12,400
If I shed that punk's bloody tears on Jin Wu's grave, I think he'll be satisfied.

242
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,820
I have to help him let go of his grief.

243
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:22,280
When the general election is over, sharp wind will blow.

244
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:28,390
Kim Hui Wu's and Hwang Jin Yong's blood will stain the party's name.

245
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:33,520
I’m going to step on that blood and run for President.

246
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:41,780
I told you, didn't you?  I will show you before Jin Wu's soul leaves.

247
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:50,270
 The candidate Jo Tae Seop of the Democratic Party for Haero-gu, 

248
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:56,910
 known as Seoul's political center, launched his election campaign today. 

249
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:02,340
Thank you.

250
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,370
Please look this way.

251
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:08,420
Please take care of me, honored guests.  Thank so much!

252
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:11,950
It's a no-brainer that you'll win again. Please help us out, sir.

253
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,750
How’s my opponent, Kim Hui Wu?

254
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,270
You have nothing to worry about.

255
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:19,260
Ah! He doesn't do anything. The election campaign is really simple, too.

256
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,360
He hasn't done anything?

257
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:26,400
He should come by to meet with these ladies, too.

258
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,700
Yes. Thank you!

259
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,800
Please take care, Assemblyman.

260
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,890
Aigoo. Hello.

261
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:36,660
- Sir, we believe in you! 
 - Thank you!

262
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,860
 Always speaking up for the people 

263
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,190
 Jo Tae Seop with the people 

264
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:41,850
 Jo Tae Seop!  

265
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:44,100
I found out what Kim Hui Wu’s intention is.

266
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:48,670
Don’t worry. Whatever his intention, the result will be the same.

267
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:51,810
Sir, Prosecutor Lee Min Su, wants to see you.

268
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:54,280
- Tell him to come. 
 - Yes, sir.

269
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:04,410
Sorry.

270
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:09,340
You asked me to take down Kim Hui Wu, but I failed.

271
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:13,930
I almost got him, but he quit and ran for election.

272
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:16,270
Did you come to say that?

273
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:19,900
I had prepared this to take down Kim Hui Wu.

274
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:26,830
I hope it helps your election campaign.

275
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:30,320
Kim Hui Wu seems to have been in some fights during his school days.

276
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,650
He frequented the police station, too, during the time he was studying for the exams.

277
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:39,210
This is a witness statement video of Im Jong Il, Ma Yong Seok, and Lee Tae Hun who were his victims.

278
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:44,020
They went to a birthday party at a club and were assaulted for no reason by Kim Hui Wu.

279
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:48,840
The video also shows that he carried a drunk woman out of the club.

280
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,350
School violence, rape...

281
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:55,980
And Kim Hui Wu went to college and participated in auctions of foreclosed properties.

282
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:59,090
He squeezed every last penny out of people in financial trouble.

283
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:02,260
You'll find the complaints inside as well.

284
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,080
Good job.

285
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:09,300
- Prosecutor Lee.  
 - Yes, sir.

286
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:13,470
Do you think I'll believe this? Huh?

287
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:15,700
You can believe it.

288
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:20,160
I will accept this card.

289
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,720
Since I now have a reason to destroy Kim Hui Wu.

290
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,940
- Director Han. 
 - Yes, sir.

291
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:33,200
Fact check everything in here and turn Kim Hui Wu into a demon.

292
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,020
 Hello, change brings hope! 

293
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:39,110
 You have a dinner meeting with the party leader tonight. 

294
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:45,130
Please check the schedule of the lawmakers in your party and find out if they can attend the upcoming election campaign.

295
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:49,390
Candidate! Candidate!

296
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:56,760
 Allegations of school violence have surfaced against former Central District Prosecutor Kim Hi Wu, 

297
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,000
 opponent of Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop. 
   

298
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,900
 It's correct that Kim Hui Wu was a bully.  

299
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,500
 I am also one of his victims. 

300
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:10,100
 I was scared when I heard such a person became a prosecutor. I can't believe that kind of person is running to become an assemblyman. 

301
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:14,980
 I wouldn’t live in a district where he was an assemblyman. 

302
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:21,400
 The approval rating is dropping rapidly. Real-time comments say, "Stop being so fake!" 

303
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:25,680
 Ah! Damn it! 

304
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:32,730
 Kim Hui Wu's School Violence Scandal Causes Controversy 

305
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:36,680
Release another one. Make Kim Hui Wu a complete piece of crap.

306
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,140
Yes, sir.

307
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,740
 Candidate Kim Hui Wu is suspected of participating  in illegal real estate deals.  

308
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:50,200
 He accumulated wealth by purchasing properties in real estate auctions and selling them with huge markups back in college. 

309
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,770
Now, let's play a game, Ji Ho.

310
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:59,570
Guess which hand the candy is in.

311
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:06,200
Ta-da! Where is it?

312
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,780
Really?

313
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,620
- Are you sure? 
- Yeah.

314
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:12,020
Now, here!

315
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:15,710
Wow, it's here! You're a genius.

316
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:20,550
Give me five!

317
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,870
Say thank you.

318
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:24,380
- Thank you! 
 - Let's go.

319
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,620
Bye.

320
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:31,180
Are you happy fooling the kids?

321
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:35,780
A good-faith lie. A virtue of a politician.

322
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:40,360
What are you doing?

323
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:45,360
Cracks are forming in the image of a candidate who is campaigning as someone who sympathizes with youth and integrity.

324
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,910
Shouldn't you release an article countering that? Aren’t you going to do an election campaign?

325
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:51,930
I'm doing it right now.

326
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:54,350
I'm meeting with a journalist right now.

327
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,920
Stop joking around.

328
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:00,750
Anyway, what happened to you?

329
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,190
Should you be here like this?

330
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:04,600
You were only recently transferred to the Japan office.

331
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,420
Well, the politics section couldn’t go on without me.

332
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:13,620
The director called me two days ago and begged me to come back, so I said okay.

333
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,450
When the "ace" was missing, he realized how precious I was.

334
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:19,280
Oh, "ace"?

335
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:23,610
Sure, welcome, Kim Han Mi.

336
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,330
 I would like to see you. Han Ji Hyeon 

337
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:15,720
Do you really think you can bring down Jo Tae Seop?

338
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:17,620
Yes.

339
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:20,620
That's why I'm even more curious.

340
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:24,080
Why you're not responding to our attacks.

341
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,420
Do I have to tell you that?

342
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:29,370
The two of us could end up in the same boat.

343
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:36,200
Before that, let me ask you how you knew.

344
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:40,680
That I was preparing myself.

345
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:47,050
Because I'm a prosecutor.

346
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,970
No.

347
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:53,050
Because I was a prosecutor.

348
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,530
That's not a satisfying answer.

349
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:59,600
It doesn't make sense either.

350
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,210
Is the world satisfying?

351
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:06,840
Does everything in the world make sense?

352
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:12,550
There are things in this world that don't make sense.

353
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,730
Just trust me.

354
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:17,730
You have to believe in me

355
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:21,180
to save yourself.

356
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,810
And you'll realize.

357
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:29,310
That I am the only one who can handle Jo Tae Seop.

358
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:36,730
I'll take my time preparing

359
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:39,040
and tie him up perfectly.

360
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:43,850
And I'll show him that hell

361
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,020
can also exist while he is living.

362
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:53,600
To the attacks...

363
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:58,470
I'm going to start responding now.

364
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:02,890
First, I'm going to get married.

365
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:04,720
Married?

366
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,380
Yes.

367
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,940
 Kim Hui Ah, the head of Cheonha Group's business strategy division  

368
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:14,110
 made a surprise wedding announcement. 

369
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:19,090
Honey! Hui Wu's mom. 
  The groom will be Kim Hui Wu, a former prosecutor and candidate for the National Assembly.  

370
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:21,820
  Director Kim has stated that she has found the person she wants to spend the rest of her life with. 

371
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:24,300
That guy isn't our son, is he?

372
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,830
Of course, he's your son. 
   He protected and cherished her throughout several difficult moments. 

373
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,980
 She told Kim Hui Wu that she had fallen in love with him  

374
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,390
 and wanted to get married.  

375
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:32,870
 They originally wanted to announce their marriage   

376
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:34,840
What is this, is he really getting married? 
  after the elections  

377
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,520
Oh, my gosh... 
   We take the recent reports 

378
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:40,050
  against Kim Hui Wu quite seriously 

379
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:41,740
 He has stated  

380
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:44,410
What are you doing? 
  that he will hold a press conference to share the truth about the matter.  

381
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:48,360
You must be busy. We're grateful that you came today.

382
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,330
I will start taking questions now.

383
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:53,300
This is a question for Kim Hui Wu.

384
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:58,020
Don't you have anything you want to say to the victims who have come forward?

385
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:09,210
I guess my marriage announcement has become a press conference to deal with gossip about me.

386
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:14,160
The negative press about me has gone too far, so I want to take this opportunity to tell everyone.

387
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,340
The rumors that have been going around about me

388
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:20,150
are all false.

389
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:22,390
 Can you take responsibility for what you just said? 

390
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:24,280
That fox-like bastard. 
  Yes. 

391
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,990
He keeps bullshitting.

392
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:28,980
 It's too early to say who's telling the truth. 

393
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,200
 Please don't treat Hui Wu as a suspect. 

394
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,210
He really succeeded at making an issue.

395
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:37,440
If the rumors are false, why do new ones keep coming up?

396
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,230
There is an organized movement to cause me harm.

397
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:44,460
It's probably the work of someone

398
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,670
who isn't happy to see me get into politics.

399
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:49,870
Are you referring to one of your competitors?

400
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:52,640
It would be nice if I was wrong.

401
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:59,600
Candidate Jo Tae Seop, don't hide in the back and do this.

402
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:05,050
Come talk to me in front of the voters.

403
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:08,150
I'll be waiting.

404
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,950
 National Assembly candidate Kim Hui Wu announces marriage to Cheonha Group's Kim Hui Ah.  

405
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,820
 Daehan Party candidate Kim Hui Wu proposes an open discussion with Jo Tae Seop 

406
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:18,400
 The world will focus its attention on me. 

407
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:22,310
 After that, we'll propose a televised forum  

408
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:25,940
 so that Jo Tae Seop can't refuse.  

409
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:30,470
A televised forum and a wedding announcement?

410
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:33,800
It looks like Kim Hui Wu is trying to get me to the colosseum.

411
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:38,330
Someone has to die in a life-or-death duel

412
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:40,840
for it to end.

413
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:47,040
Sir, with your high approval rating, I don't think you need to respond to his provocation.

414
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,530
You should just ignore it.

415
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:50,430
Let's go.

416
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:53,380
- Contact the National Elections Commission. Let's do it.
 - Sir.

417
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:56,050
I can't hide like a dog.

418
00:34:56,050 --> 00:35:01,010
How can the people trust me if I ignore that newbie's taunts?

419
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:04,570
Politicians are people who fight for the citizens.

420
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:08,620
You lose that identity if you avoid the fight.

421
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:11,490
Kim Hui must be

422
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:14,260
sharpening his sword right now to kill me.

423
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:17,480
But what I have isn't a sword.

424
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:20,570
It's a gun.

425
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:31,890
There are candidates receiving a great deal of national attention in this election cycle.

426
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:34,530
Those are seasoned politician, Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop,

427
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:38,570
and former prosecutor Kim Hui Wu, who proposed this conversation.

428
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:42,830
I'll go to candidate Jo Tae Seop first.

429
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:44,640
Please begin.

430
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:50,200
I was very happy to hear that we had a younger contender

431
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,150
in this race.

432
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:56,270
I wanted to hear fresh insights that only the voices of the younger generations can provide.

433
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:58,910
But, what is this?

434
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:03,720
The allegations surrounding Kim Hui Wu aren't simply negative press.

435
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:07,770
School violence, rape, robbery and countless others

436
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:09,510
are crimes.

437
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:13,660
If you have a conscience, you should step down yourself.

438
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:16,370
Are you talking about conscience?

439
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:21,360
A few years ago, Bando Bank, one of the three biggest banks in our country

440
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:25,370
ended up in the hands of Park Dae Ho, the CEO of DH Money.

441
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:30,520
It was a really shocking incident at the time.

442
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,310
Let's talk about the topic at hand.

443
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:35,090
What does that situation have to do with me?

444
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:38,170
Wasn't that because in order to take over the financial sector,

445
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:40,460
you teamed up with members of the Financial Supervisory Services?

446
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:43,950
I'm disappointed that you're taking such an expected route.

447
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:47,430
You wanted to expose me and harm me, never mind if it's not true?

448
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:50,150
Did you propose a discussion just to do this?

449
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:55,190
No. I want everyone to see your true colors.

450
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:58,870
Shouldn't the voters know that?

451
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:02,270
I submitted a video in advance.

452
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:05,910
If it's ready, please take a look.

453
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:09,860
It's too unfair for me to cover up all of the embezzlement.

454
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,700
I was just a cover for Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop.

455
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:17,590
Even with a 15% stake in Cheonha Holdings, how would I have enough money to buy the bank?

456
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:21,520
I was just used by Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop.

457
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:26,350
The video you just saw was taken with Park Dae Ho's consent.

458
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:30,250
The rest will be turned over to the press

459
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:32,350
after the discussion.

460
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:35,640
It is possible for intimidation or threats to have played a role.

461
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:41,410
And I can also see the possibility of trying to use false testimony to hurt me.

462
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:43,380
Do you really think that's possible?

463
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,700
There is so much evidence.

464
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,820
It's a shame.

465
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:50,690
You've been poking around in politics even as a prosecutor.

466
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:53,970
It seems like you've only learned how to do bad things.

467
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:55,850
And our citizens

468
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:59,360
won't fall for such cheap tricks.

469
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:03,030
The voters are the ones who will make the decision.

470
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:06,110
The voters are also the ones who will make the final judgment about the candidates.

471
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:07,680
That's true.

472
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,190
I'm no longer someone who fights in a courtroom.

473
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:13,810
This isn't a court of law.

474
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:17,500
But, the people have the right to know the truth

475
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,380
and make their decisions.

476
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:24,120
It looks like these two are going after each other ruthlessly.

477
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:28,610
I would now like to ask the two candidates about their political goals.

478
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:31,560
Candidate Kim Hui Wu of the Deahan Party can go first.

479
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,860
Okay.

480
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:40,550
I only had one reason for getting into politics.

481
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:46,400
That was to end the dirty and rotten things happening in politics.

482
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,410
People who want to belittle politicians,

483
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:53,070
wanting to become politicians themselves

484
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,980
is a great contradiction.

485
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:57,080
Even bigger contradictions exist.

486
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,930
You have typically argued that your goal

487
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:03,940
is to make a stronger Republic of Korea.

488
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:07,460
Yes. That's is my mission.

489
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:11,460
What do you think about making a few sacrifices for that greater mission?

490
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,220
Sacrifice is what I do.

491
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:16,850
I can't allow anyone else but me to make a sacrifice.

492
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:21,190
Then why did you try to take businessman Wu Yong Su's assets?

493
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:24,870
Why did you sacrifice Kim Chan Il of Cheonha Telecommunications and actress Cho Yun Ah?

494
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:28,880
Candidate Kim. Do not confuse the voters with your groundless assumptions.

495
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,980
Instead of conjuring ways to slander me, you should've prepared your policy and vision.

496
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:36,400
Confusion?

497
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,350
I'm simply telling the truth.

498
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:46,460
This here is the cellphone of Director Kim Jin Wu, the late secretary of Candidate Jo,

499
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:50,900
who committed suicide after being questioned for committing defense industry corruption.

500
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,590
In here, Candidate Jo,

501
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:58,690
is the truth and filth you have desperately been trying to hide.

502
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:00,340
Candidate Jo.

503
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:03,450
Do you still claim innocence?

504
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:12,690
Moderator. I ask that you don't allow unverified personal information

505
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:14,620
to be leaked.

506
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:20,240
Candidate Kim, please refrain from leaking unverified personal information during a live broadcast.

507
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,350
- Understood. 
- Candidate Kim.

508
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:26,040
This is truly deplorable.

509
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,940
No matter how eager you are to win,

510
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:35,430
you shouldn't resort to such a vulgar tactic of using evidence from a suicide case and threatening to leak it.

511
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:37,590
You should know better as a former prosecutor.

512
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:40,020
A vulgar tactic?

513
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,300
This isn't vulgar.

514
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,480
It's illegal.

515
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,510
It's clearly illegal.

516
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:50,710
However, I had no other choice. Or else,

517
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:55,150
Candidate Jo, you would silence the press again and conceal and manipulate through the prosecution again.

518
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:58,280
What do you mean, cover up and manipulate?

519
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:01,410
Apologize this instant and take back what you said.

520
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,350
I will gladly accept my punishment.

521
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:07,900
So,

522
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:13,420
Candidate Jo should pay now for all your past crimes.

523
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,920
 The last one, number 3. 

524
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:20,400
 We will die together. 

525
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:30,050
I am certain that my late secretary did not commit suicide.

526
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:34,360
I can't shake off the reasonable doubt

527
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:37,930
that Candidate Kim right here was deeply involved with his death.

528
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:43,180
The reason I didn't refute his absurd claims today was not because I had no rebuttal.

529
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:47,570
But I wanted to show respect to my colleagues and opponents.

530
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:51,750
Please show the file I prepared.

531
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:57,300
This was the last time Kim Jin Wu was seen alive.

532
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:02,560
The person with him at that time was a prosecutor. They even got into a physical altercation.

533
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,180
That prosecutor was none other than Candidate Kim right here.

534
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:07,020
Answer me this.

535
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:11,250
What exactly happened that night?

536
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:13,390
What kind of horrible threat did you make

537
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:17,160
that pushed him to take his own life?

538
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:22,080
Candidate Kim! A person is dead!

539
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:29,430
Give your excuses  to the prosecutor and repent in prison.

540
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:33,390
You don't deserve to be here.

541
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:36,400
That is all.

542
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,180
Okay.

543
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:44,260
As to the reasonable doubts Candidate Jo has voiced, I empathize with him.

544
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,610
I will reveal the truth about all the doubts raised about me

545
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:50,820
regarding Office Director Kim Jin Wu's death

546
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:54,780
through future investigations.

547
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:59,000
I ask the people to make a level-headed judgment.

548
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,040
Are the claims that Candidate Kim made true?

549
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,050
Please give us a comment!

550
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:08,150
What about Manager Han?

551
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:09,790
There's no contact.

552
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:13,020
 The debate between the two Haero-gu candidates is wrapping up. 

553
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:16,490
I've brought someone special to the  Site of Current Events 24 .

554
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:20,610
She's someone who's known to be candidate Jo Tae Seop's closest aide.

555
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,620
You said you'll make an important announcement today to the citizens.

556
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:29,730
 Yes. I am Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop's executive assistant, Han Ji Won. 

557
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:33,620
 The assemblyman is someone who always worries about our country's future. 

558
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:35,720
 And he is someone who's sincere. 

559
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:40,700
 However, there's something I have come to know while standing beside the assemblyman for over ten years. 

560
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:42,060
 Political power 

561
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:44,090
 I need your help, Hui Ah. 

562
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:46,560
 It's an opportunity to catch Jo Tae Seop. 

563
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,900
Reporter Kim Han Mi has done something amazing.

564
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:50,980
 I won't say that I have no regrets. 

565
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:54,470
Viewership will increase and it'll also become an issue. Isn't it good, Director?

566
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:57,780
If it goes wrong, the risk to us...

567
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:02,000
Which side's risk do you think, will be greater?

568
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,950
Whatever the circumstance, don't end the broadcast.

569
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:08,580
If you want to continue to get our advertisements.

570
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,900
I won't say that it was wrong from the start.

571
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:18,480
However, there were certainly problems in Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop's process.

572
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,910
While I don't know if the objective was right, he was not upright in his methods.

573
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:26,200
To maintain power, he moved enormous sums of government funds,

574
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:31,550
and I also very clearly witnessed people being sacrificed.

575
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:39,870
 He has a lot of shops and villas around here. 

576
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:44,750
 The bastard's wealth is about 200 billion, but if we take out the debt, it should be about 100 billion. 

577
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:49,080
 Since you, CEO Park, do banking, you know how to set the table. 

578
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,610
 - Right? 
 - Should I bring you everything? 

579
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:54,800
 He seemed to be a man of a certain age, 

580
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,690
 so that he can use his wealth properly for his country at last, 

581
00:44:58,690 --> 00:44:59,820
 assist him. 

582
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:01,560
Building political funds.

583
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,940
 I suggest you offer him a carrot first. 

584
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:07,620
 By giving the position of the Central District Prosecutor and cultivating Kim Seok Hun, 

585
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:10,380
 continue to maintain command over the prosecution, you say? 

586
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:11,400
Command over the prosecution.

587
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,390
 Manager Han, isn't there anything that's prepared? 

588
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:15,150
 A man installed hidden cameras to spy on newscasters. 

589
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:16,600
 Go with that. 

590
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,660
Driving public opinion.

591
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:20,160
 Kim Hui Wu, that bastard, doesn't he appear dangerous? 

592
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,200
 Find out, from beginning to end. 

593
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,490
 Investigate him without leaving out a thing. 

594
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:26,720
Investigations into individuals.

595
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:39,400
And the assemblyman has made my older brother into a murderer.

596
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:44,100
We cannot change the world through the assemblyman's methods.

597
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:47,380
 Please stop now, Assemblyman. 

598
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:51,630
Do not become more of a monster.

599
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:53,850
I beg you.

600
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:03,450
Assemblyman, is Manager Han's disclosure the truth? Please give us a comment.

601
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:08,040
I am sorry to the public for not providing a policy discussion

602
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:12,440
but a debate only filled with suspicion.

603
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:16,360
And now, they are using my confidante as well.

604
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:19,820
It's a regrettable night.

605
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:25,230
Dear citizens, until the entire truth is brought to light,

606
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:27,430
I hope you will maintain objectivity.

607
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:31,570
I trust you, dear citizens.

608
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:33,610
How do you know CEO Park Dae Ho of DH Money?

609
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:35,960
- How do you know CEO Park Dae Ho? 
- Excuse us.

610
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,220
Excuse us.

611
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:39,030
Give us an explanation.

612
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:40,380
Please make way.

613
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:41,820
Sir, give us a comment.

614
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:43,330
What do you have to say?

615
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:45,210
- Do you admit you did it? 
 - Is it true?

616
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:46,310
It's me.

617
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:49,570
Assemblyman, do not worry.

618
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:52,500
I'll get everything dismissed for lack of evidence.

619
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,210
Alright.

620
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:02,480
Give us a comment, please.

621
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,160
Bring Manager Han.

622
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:14,230
Please get in, candidate Kim Hui Wu sent us.

623
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:34,750
We are being followed right now.

624
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:45,920
 The political world is wavering after the claims made by a former prosecutor. 

625
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,890
 Former prosecutor Kim and Assemblyman Jo's associate, 

626
00:47:48,890 --> 00:47:52,500
 Manager Han Ji Won's testimony and evidential material. 

627
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:56,890
 Countless allegations of Jo accepting billions in bribes and claims of abusing his power 

628
00:47:56,890 --> 00:47:59,980
 will greatly affect his future. 

629
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:01,720
 The shocking revelations made by former prosecutor Kim Hui Wu 

630
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:06,160
 brought focus on the deeply rooted collusion between politics... 

631
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:45,180
Let's go.

632
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:47,730
Stop now. I'm not going.

633
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:49,750
The assemblyman says he wants to see you.

634
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:51,910
Go alone.

635
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:57,050
Then, I can't help it.

636
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:23,600
Let go of Manager Han Ji Won.

637
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:27,310
It's finished. It stops here.

638
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:30,820
Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop will end up going to jail.

639
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:38,340
The assemblyman, not you, decides the end.

640
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:56,290
Yeon Seok, are you okay?

641
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:10,160
 From my memory, 

642
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:14,730
 I erase you today. 

643
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:49,780
Hyeong, hurry!

644
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:39,630
Stop!

645
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:42,750
Stop, please.

646
00:52:46,850 --> 00:52:49,190
He's my older brother.

647
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:53,650
The one who can't remember me.

648
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,630
I admit it.

649
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:31,380
Assemblyman, I'm sorry.

650
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:33,550
I failed.

651
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:38,630
I understand.

652
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:49,010
Go. It's the assemblyman's order.

653
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,980
Here.

654
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:07,970
It's me, Kim Hui Wu.

655
00:54:07,970 --> 00:54:10,020
I told you

656
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:15,670
that you can't catch me. Maybe if you had eliminated me,

657
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:20,650
leaving me like this means you weren't able to change the present.

658
00:54:20,650 --> 00:54:25,010
It means you weren't able to accomplish the mission you were given.

659
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:30,150
The accountability for that is not something you can mete out.

660
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:35,170
It's me, Jo Tae Seop. It's something I myself must call to account.

661
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:39,490
I'll wait and see

662
00:54:39,490 --> 00:54:42,190
for the Republic of Korea that you will make.

663
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:18,370
Now you won't need to hide.

664
00:55:18,370 --> 00:55:20,220
I'll go...

665
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:23,820
to jail.

666
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:32,570
In working with Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop, I also committed a lot of wrong things.

667
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:36,590
If there is no witness, you won't be able to catch him.

668
00:55:36,590 --> 00:55:42,720
You know. That Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop is someone like that.

669
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,790
Have I come too far?

670
00:55:58,710 --> 00:56:00,400
Manager Han.

671
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:10,250
Manager Kim.

672
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:38,710
 While Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop's whereabouts are unknown, 

673
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:43,050
 Jo Tae Seop-Gate has gone beyond the world of politics and to the prosecution. 

674
00:56:43,050 --> 00:56:45,300
- A comment, please. 
- - Move!

675
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:47,600
 Prosecutor General Yun Jong Gi 

676
00:56:49,550 --> 00:56:51,280
Shall we go?

677
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:57,640
A moment to smoke a cigarette?

678
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:00,350
Quit, you bastard!

679
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:02,140
Proceed.

680
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:14,100
 Seoul Central Detention Center 

681
00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:18,510
Although it's prison life, I feel good.

682
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:21,470
Now I'm going to live completely for myself.

683
00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:27,070
I'll help you so that you can live a splendid life after you finish your sentence.

684
00:57:29,150 --> 00:57:35,540
Then, will I, like you, also be able to have good friends beside me?

685
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:41,210
I was envious of Reporter Kim Han Mi and Chairwoman Kim Hui Ah.

686
00:57:41,210 --> 00:57:43,750
That there were friends like them.

687
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:49,160
I'll help you with that too.

688
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:53,100
But there's something I'm curious about.

689
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:58,820
Why did you decide to do the expose?

690
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:02,680
You said so yourself.

691
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:05,300
 I know now. 

692
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:11,100
 That, if I decide to live, what I won't be able to catch is Jo Tae Seop. 

693
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:20,350
 Unless it's a monster even worse, the devil 

694
00:58:20,350 --> 00:58:23,050
 cannot be caught. 

695
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:28,150
I only had the thought that I will have to expose Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop's crimes someday.

696
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:33,690
The truth was that I was an assistant who received Assemblyman Jo's orders and carried out evil deeds in his stead.

697
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:38,930
One who couldn't get away from him despite knowing it was wrong.

698
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:43,480
However, to catch Jo Tae Seop, to safeguard justice,

699
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:47,940
throwing away everything, you jumped into the fire with Jo Taep Seop.

700
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:52,080
While I watched you, I felt a pang of conscience.

701
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:55,690
I didn't want to beg for my life anymore.

702
00:58:55,690 --> 00:58:58,650
What you said and did during that time,

703
00:58:58,650 --> 00:59:02,990
seeing you who read my thoughts exactly.

704
00:59:02,990 --> 00:59:07,630
While I couldn't understand it, I thought if it was this person.

705
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:14,220
Perhaps if it is this person, it might even be possible.

706
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:21,060
Approaching Han Mi at that time was an excellent choice.

707
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:24,960
It's because I knew she was your friend.

708
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,420
I thought she was someone I could trust.

709
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:31,540
Yes, the timing was the best.

710
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:35,760
Because of the thought that there may never be an opportunity if it wasn't this time,

711
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:38,620
I didn't have time to hesitate.

712
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:42,380
I was also certain that you would take care of what's left.

713
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:46,520
Thank you for trusting me.

714
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,850
 Let's meet. 

715
00:59:59,130 --> 01:00:01,390
Silent to the end.

716
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:05,930
Then, can we view it as meaning that you acknowledge all charges?

717
01:00:07,090 --> 01:00:13,380
If I'm guilty of something, it's that I could not complete the assemblyman's orders.

718
01:00:14,990 --> 01:00:18,120
That's not something for you to decide.

719
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:21,390
This one's crazy. Crazy...

720
01:00:22,370 --> 01:00:24,910
This one's crazy.

721
01:00:24,910 --> 01:00:27,920
But what can we do. I'm also crazy.

722
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:39,450
How does it feel to eat in the prosecutors' cafeteria coming in as an outsider?

723
01:00:39,450 --> 01:00:43,950
It doesn't feel real. And as if I must go up to the office right away and work.

724
01:00:43,950 --> 01:00:49,970
Hey, I watched a debate with anxiety for the first time ever.

725
01:00:49,970 --> 01:00:52,110
What kind of person was Jo Tae Seop.

726
01:00:52,110 --> 01:00:55,060
The look in his eyes felt as if it were penetrating even into my heart.

727
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:58,520
If I weren't a genius at acting, it probably would have been really obvious.

728
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:04,000
 Kim Hui Wu. I need you to be my ticket. 

729
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,790
 - Ticket?
- Mmhm. 

730
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:13,800
 Let me ask you. Have you really bowed? To Jo Tae Seop? 

731
01:01:15,430 --> 01:01:19,190
 Do you really mean to have a go at me? 

732
01:01:19,190 --> 01:01:23,870
 Hui Wu, I don't like people around me getting hurt. 

733
01:01:23,870 --> 01:01:30,180
 So leave it to me and stop. At this point. 

734
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:34,310
 Seonbae, you will never be able to win against Jo Tae Seop. 

735
01:01:34,310 --> 01:01:38,730
 Even before fighting, you are getting worried about me. 

736
01:01:41,530 --> 01:01:47,040
 What can we do? Since I can't tell you to stop. 

737
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:53,090
 To win over Jo Tae Seop, I will do whatever. 

738
01:01:53,090 --> 01:01:58,480
 Even if you get hurt, I'll pretend not to know. 

739
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:02,600
 Will you still do it? 

740
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:06,880
 Of course, a life-or-death game is fun. 

741
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,410
Thank you.

742
01:02:11,410 --> 01:02:15,580
Thanks to you leaking material about the bullying, my work became much easier.

743
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:18,910
But wasn't it really bullying?

744
01:02:18,910 --> 01:02:22,830
No way. I can swear to the universe that there isn't a single speck—

745
01:02:22,830 --> 01:02:24,550
There must be.

746
01:02:24,550 --> 01:02:27,210
- There isn't. 
 - There probably is.

747
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:29,930
 Despite the joint search by the prosecution and police, 

748
01:02:29,930 --> 01:02:33,990
 the whereabouts of the former assemblyman, Jo Tae Seop, are unknown. 

749
01:02:33,990 --> 01:02:40,200
 But a dead body, presumed to belong to Former Assemblyman Jo, has been found on a nearby shoreline of Daemyeong Beach. 

750
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:41,910
 The police requested a DNA test... 

751
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:45,960
Do you think the person who was discovered there is really Jo Tae Seop?

752
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:48,450
I confirmed the report that the DNA matched.

753
01:02:48,450 --> 01:02:52,570
Only in games, he could come back to life.

754
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:55,400
This is so annoying.

755
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:59,810
We got all of them. But why don't I feel relieved?

756
01:02:59,810 --> 01:03:03,150
It's probably because there's no one who's received proper punishment.

757
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:06,360
They weaseled their way out or left the world behind.

758
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:10,210
Jang Il Hyeon, probation and a fine. Park Dae Ho, probation and a fine.

759
01:03:10,210 --> 01:03:13,070
Kim Seok Hun, a special pardon on Independence Day.

760
01:03:13,070 --> 01:03:16,550
They say even Jeon Il Bo could get out. Does this make any sense? This?

761
01:03:16,550 --> 01:03:21,220
Of course, it doesn't make sense. So we have to catch them a hundred, a thousand times and lock them up.

762
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:25,510
Bro, you're not a prosecutor anymore.

763
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:28,020
Ah. That's right.

764
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:29,500
Right.

765
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:33,150
Leave that to me, and you?

766
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:35,920
Make a world worth living in.

767
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:39,890
Yes, I'll do so.

768
01:03:39,890 --> 01:03:42,060
I'm blinded.

769
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:44,430
 Assemblyman's badge. 

770
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:46,550
Ah, I apologize.

771
01:03:46,550 --> 01:03:47,780
Let's eat.

772
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:52,820
"Politics isn't about filling people's deficiencies. But it's about creating what people need."

773
01:03:52,820 --> 01:03:58,100
"That way, people will vote for me again to treat another deficiency they have."

774
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:00,390
 "The Walk of the Day" 

775
01:04:01,970 --> 01:04:05,400
Hey, Park Sang Man. I bet this is what you want to tell me. Right?

776
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:08,620
What's so interesting about this that you're reading it?

777
01:04:08,620 --> 01:04:11,130
I, I don't think I can read this.

778
01:04:11,130 --> 01:04:14,660
If you want to read it, wake up and read it yourself.

779
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:16,610
Kid.

780
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:53,720
 Closed for today, Sorry! 

781
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:59,470
All right. A man I have such deep respect for, Mr. Wu Yong Su, is here today

782
01:04:59,470 --> 01:05:04,550
along with many of my acquaintances who must be busy.

783
01:05:05,650 --> 01:05:07,600
I'll tell you why I called for this meeting.

784
01:05:11,890 --> 01:05:14,230
We will postpone our wedding.

785
01:05:14,230 --> 01:05:15,740
- But why? 
- But why?

786
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:19,870
Actually, we just started dating.

787
01:05:19,870 --> 01:05:23,030
We just need some time to get to know each other.

788
01:05:23,030 --> 01:05:27,570
To be honest, we weren't really dating when we announced our marriage.

789
01:05:27,570 --> 01:05:30,870
We felt hurried while we were trying to catch Jo Tae Seop.

790
01:05:30,870 --> 01:05:34,240
To bring him down, we met often and spent a lot of time together.

791
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:36,180
♫  frozen time  ♫

792
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:37,620
♫  I really want  ♫

793
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:39,390
And we ended up dating.

794
01:05:39,390 --> 01:05:43,590
The order of things happened to get reversed.

795
01:05:43,590 --> 01:05:45,190
♫  And if I get another chance  ♫

796
01:05:45,190 --> 01:05:47,400
Then what's this?

797
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:49,670
Oh, that. You can open it now.

798
01:05:49,670 --> 01:05:51,870
♫  I'll let it burn fire  ♫

799
01:05:51,870 --> 01:05:54,270
What? Then why did they print wedding invitations already?

800
01:05:54,270 --> 01:05:56,090
Bali.

801
01:05:56,090 --> 01:05:56,840
Bali?

802
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:58,250
 Bali Pasut Beach 
♫  I wanna rise higher  ♫ 

803
01:05:58,250 --> 01:05:59,870
Yes.

804
01:05:59,870 --> 01:06:02,890
You must have been shocked because of our news.

805
01:06:02,890 --> 01:06:07,910
As a way to apologize, I'm going to send you on a trip!

806
01:06:07,910 --> 01:06:12,850
Why don't we all go to Bali, paradise on earth?

807
01:06:12,850 --> 01:06:17,850
I knew it. That's why I've been practicing Bali dance.

808
01:06:17,850 --> 01:06:20,340
Wait. I have another announcement!

809
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:23,710
Chairwoman of Cheonha Kim Hui Ah will bring you to Bali

810
01:06:23,710 --> 01:06:26,510
on a chartered plane!

811
01:06:31,370 --> 01:06:35,580
♪  I've got peace like a river  ♪

812
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:39,490
♪  I've got peace like a river  ♪

813
01:06:39,490 --> 01:06:43,600
♪  I've got peace like a river  ♪

814
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:46,760
♪  Oh, peace  ♪

815
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:56,300
My cologne.

816
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:06,800
Great.

817
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:11,460
This is the best cologne to get rid of the smell of blood.

818
01:07:16,050 --> 01:07:23,060
By the way, people these days are so rude. You know?

819
01:07:23,060 --> 01:07:27,010
Hey. You!

820
01:07:32,180 --> 01:07:35,100
Who signs your paychecks?

821
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:38,460
Chairwoman Cheon signs your paychecks.

822
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:41,800
Then how dare you run to the prosecutor

823
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:45,470
and expose her embezzlement?

824
01:07:45,470 --> 01:07:48,090
Does the prosecutor pay you?

825
01:07:58,310 --> 01:08:01,130
- Take care of him. 
- Yes, sir.

826
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:25,380
Why the long faces?

827
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:27,890
We're not at a funeral.

828
01:08:33,540 --> 01:08:35,380
Hey.

829
01:08:44,990 --> 01:08:47,670
I'm sure you all know

830
01:08:47,670 --> 01:08:52,210
I had to jump through so many hoops

831
01:08:52,210 --> 01:08:54,970
to get you out of Kim Hui Wu and his crew's clutches.

832
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:58,410
So show me some smiles.

833
01:08:58,410 --> 01:09:02,250
Then all my hard work will feel rewarding. Okay?

834
01:09:02,250 --> 01:09:06,140
Hey, Choi Kang Jin. Smile.

835
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:07,560
Okay.

836
01:09:08,330 --> 01:09:11,730
Lawyer Cha. I want your explanation.

837
01:09:11,730 --> 01:09:14,260
Why did you bring us here?

838
01:09:18,630 --> 01:09:21,670
Chairwoman Cheon Ho Ryeong will be here soon.

839
01:09:21,670 --> 01:09:24,980
She will tell you why you're here.

840
01:09:24,980 --> 01:09:30,270
And you just need to be careful of one thing.

841
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:32,280
Don't shake your leg.

842
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:34,990
She hates it because it chases away good luck.

843
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:39,950
The chairwoman is coming in.

844
01:09:48,410 --> 01:09:50,540
It's been a while.

845
01:10:00,990 --> 01:10:05,110
You must be curious why I brought you all here.

846
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:07,950
I want to help you

847
01:10:07,950 --> 01:10:11,350
go back to your old lives.

848
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:18,940
The secret club Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop made.

849
01:10:18,940 --> 01:10:21,160
I would like to bring it back.

850
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:26,280
As for that, Hwang Jin Yong and Kim Hui Wu are watching us like hawks.

851
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:28,900
What can't money solve?

852
01:10:31,090 --> 01:10:36,370
Kim Seok Hun. If you want, I'll get you your job back in the prosecution.

853
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:40,730
Gu Wuk Cheong. If you want, run in the next general election.

854
01:10:40,730 --> 01:10:44,200
What? Are you serious?

855
01:10:45,030 --> 01:10:46,600
But, ma'am.

856
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:49,240
What? Do you want your old job back?

857
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:50,850
Desperately.

858
01:10:50,850 --> 01:10:55,050
But you were never interested in gaining power.

859
01:10:55,050 --> 01:10:57,390
I'm still not interested.

860
01:10:58,010 --> 01:11:00,020
I just want one thing.

861
01:11:00,020 --> 01:11:04,720
That no one dares challenge Jehwang Group even if I'm not around.

862
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:08,950
Even if Hwang Jin Yong and Kim Hui Wu try to bring it down with their petty sense of justice,

863
01:11:08,950 --> 01:11:12,770
Jehwang Group will not falter.

864
01:11:12,770 --> 01:11:19,250
A world where my son, my daughter, and my grandson can rule forever.

865
01:11:19,950 --> 01:11:25,190
You can get the power you seek. And I can make an ironclad company.

866
01:11:26,270 --> 01:11:30,370
We'll be good partners because we want different things.

867
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:36,760
Do you know why Assemblyman Jo failed?

868
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:39,770
Because he tried to have everything.

869
01:11:39,770 --> 01:11:44,720
Power, money, and even the justificiation.

870
01:11:46,610 --> 01:11:50,620
I'm different. Power belongs to you. You can keep it.

871
01:11:50,620 --> 01:11:52,040
I

872
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:56,050
only need money.

873
01:11:59,950 --> 01:12:04,030
All right. Join hands with me.

874
01:12:05,290 --> 01:12:07,560
Jang Il Hyeon.

875
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:09,790
Stop shaking your leg.

876
01:12:16,130 --> 01:12:19,690
All right. Why don't we raise our glasses?

877
01:12:22,470 --> 01:12:25,990
Cheers to Chairwoman Cheon Ho Ryeong of Jehwang Group!

878
01:12:25,990 --> 01:12:28,180
- Cheers! 
- Cheers!

879
01:12:37,050 --> 01:12:40,720
Gosh. Come on, smile.

880
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:44,050
Choi Kang Jin, aren't you happy?

881
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:07,660
 Trash that I must get rid of still remains. 

882
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:20,340
 A country can survive even after a war. 

883
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:25,410
 A country can also survive disease and poverty. 

884
01:13:25,410 --> 01:13:32,390
 But a country without justice will not be able to survive in the end.
