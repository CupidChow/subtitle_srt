1
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,877
Hurry up. One bucket.
How hard can that be?

2
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,259
Gigi!

3
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,553
Come on.

4
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:54,971
Let's go!

5
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:51,945
Gi.

6
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:56,533
Sorry. Migraine was killing me last night.

7
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,035
Why don't you rest? We've got this.

8
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,579
No need, it's fine. How are things?

9
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:05,708
One bucket, for that guy.
Looks like he's having a bad day.

10
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:09,170
Cut me some slack, boss.
Give me until tomorrow, at least.

11
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:14,175
I've got this.
Just check the orders in the kitchen.

12
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,426
You sure?

13
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:18,972
Yes sir.

14
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,188
<i>Whoa!</i>

15
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,439
One bucket, sir.

16
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:31,526
<i>Was the drink that strong?</i>

17
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:36,322
- Fuck!
- Sorry, sir. Sorry, sir.

18
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:39,367
- Is everybody stupid everywhere?
- Sorry, sir.

19
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:43,371
- First, your slowpoke waiter, now this!
- Sorry, we'll just give you a new bucket.

20
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:45,290
What about this? Huh?

21
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:50,420
I'll have it washed, we have extra
staff shirts you can wear while I do.

22
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,922
Right, so I'll look like
one of your waiters!

23
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,550
Are you insulting me?
Don't you know I'm a cop?

24
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:56,593
- Sorry, sir.
- Hey!

25
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:57,719
Apologies, sir.

26
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:00,805
- I'll wait here.
- You sure?

27
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,892
- Yes! Back me up.
- You want to help? Where's your manager?

28
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:07,729
- I'm the manager, sir.
- That's why this place is shit!

29
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:10,690
Sir, please lower your voice.
Calm down please.

30
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:12,692
The other customers are getting scared.

31
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:16,696
- If you don't want to change--
- Scared? So I look scary? All right, then!

32
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,948
Here! You scared now?

33
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,074
Sir!

34
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:23,286
Who are you? Why are you butting in?

35
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,663
Sir, maybe we can talk about this, sir!

36
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:32,503
Sir, we have CCTV cameras.
You're being recorded.

37
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:39,427
I won't press charges if you just leave,
please, sir.

38
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,846
Please, apologies for everything, sir.

39
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,647
Next time, don't be such a klutz!

40
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,649
Don't come closer.

41
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:02,450
Make sure none of this gets out
or I'll come back for you!

42
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:18,424
Asshole!

43
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:22,095
Aljon, gather the CCTV recordings,
I'll have that guy dealt with.

44
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,973
Micah, the tapes…

45
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:27,725
What were you thinking,
arguing with the guy?

46
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,852
He was an ass!

47
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:30,979
What the heck?

48
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:35,316
Emilia, where were you?

49
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,860
There's another anomaly with the threads.

50
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,454
Let's drink to calm down.

51
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:53,001
Think I'll pass, Aljon.
I'm still a bit shaken.

52
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:55,461
- I got dibs.
- I'm going home.

53
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:57,922
I'm off.

54
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,591
All right. Take it easy.

55
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,678
- Thanks for being here.
- You take care.

56
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,640
- Thanks, Miguel.
- You rest up, Gi.

57
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,567
Lara…

58
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,864
I saw something.

59
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:27,869
Huh?

60
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:30,496
When I touched the cop.

61
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:32,707
Really?

62
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:34,876
You didn't hear anything?

63
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,760
Nothing. I think.

64
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:48,681
Maybe you were just disoriented
by what was happening.

65
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:52,268
The whole thing was so intense
and confusing.

66
00:05:57,815 --> 00:06:00,193
You were pretty tough back there. Solid.

67
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:03,362
I'm so glad we saved Gigi.

68
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,116
I was terrified.

69
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,535
That was close.

70
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,122
Good thing we saw it in the vision.

71
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,084
What if we didn't, right?

72
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,795
It could have been worse.

73
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:21,339
Right?

74
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:33,351
What happened?
Why are there even more red threads?

75
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:42,026
I think the higher ups
have something to do with it!

76
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:10,555
I used to think
we become stars when we die.

77
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:15,476
That's also what my nanny used to say.

78
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,729
I even thought

79
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:22,859
you could choose what part of the sky
you'd spend the rest of your afterlife.

80
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,777
But that sounds kind of boring.

81
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:31,617
Boring? Being a star
sounds like a lot of fun!

82
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:36,956
Think about it, though, you don't see
that many stars here in Metro Manila.

83
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,126
No one will see us.

84
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:47,425
Us?

85
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,222
You think we'll be next to each other
up there?

86
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,811
Yeah.

87
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,399
I'll choose the spot right next to you.

88
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:49,737
- You said you didn't hear anything.
- Wait, Miguel…

89
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,616
Miguel, he was going to kill Gigi.

90
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,409
So we just let him die?

91
00:08:56,077 --> 00:09:00,331
- That's a person you're talking about.
- Miguel, we can't save everyone.

92
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:02,250
Especially those who don't deserve it!

93
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,712
You said it yourself, we are not God.

94
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,757
But we know what's right and what's wrong.

95
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,052
You heard it yourself,
that man's a criminal, he's bad man.

96
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:15,137
But he's still human, Lara!

97
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,557
And if he dies, that's on us!

98
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,975
We're not going to kill him!

99
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:22,061
But we knew what would happen
and we didn't do anything!

100
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,272
What if he has a family?

101
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:27,024
What if there are people
depending on him, Lara?

102
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,735
He's not our responsibility, Miguel.

103
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,905
He made his choice!
It's on him if he dies.

104
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:36,492
He should have thought of his family
before committing a crime!

105
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:40,663
Your dad was such a decent person
but you weren't able to save him!

106
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,165
Now you want to save that cop!

107
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,388
Miguel…

108
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:12,004
I want to continue the work
Jaime was doing for Helping Hands.

109
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:16,092
<i>Are you replacing Sir Jaime officially?</i>

110
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:20,179
Although, the person replacing him
is very nice.

111
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:21,639
But I can't guarantee

112
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:25,684
he'll continue what Jaime was doing
for communities like yours.

113
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,646
<i>Oh, is that so?</i>

114
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,816
<i>That's really nice to hear, ma'am.</i>

115
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:40,616
I have to admit, at first,
I didn't think Primehealth would benefit

116
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:57,258
<i>Thank you, ma'am.</i>

117
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:06,892
- Aren't you eating? You're up early.
- Swamped with work, Ma.

118
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:10,896
Yeah, I noticed.
You're going out more often.

119
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,399
Are you sure it's work?

120
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:16,235
Or are you dating?

121
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:19,280
How are you and Miss Jasmin's son?

122
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:21,240
- What's his name again?
- Miguel?

123
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:22,783
Miguel! That's it!

124
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:24,827
Let me have a sip.

125
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,078
Are you two together?

126
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,627
Ma… we're not dating!

127
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:37,923
And if you were going to be a Karen,
get your facts straight.

128
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:44,263
Even if no one gives me info,
I can read it in your face.

129
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:47,475
The way you blushed
when you mentioned his name.

130
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:50,811
You should stop watching K-dramas, Ma.

131
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,607
Whatever. Just update me.

132
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:58,360
You know how happy I am
if someone's making you happy.

133
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,906
Regardless if it's work or a boyfriend.

134
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,699
Yes, Ma.

135
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:04,950
Also…

136
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,578
You might forget this again.

137
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,127
I'll go ahead.

138
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,027
I know that face, sis.

139
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,701
What's confirmed?

140
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:53,207
You and Miguel are having a fight.

141
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,292
No, we're not.

142
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:58,879
"No, we're not." Right.
Why is there a tear in your eye?

143
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:03,133
There, there…
Whoa, it fell but I caught it!

144
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:09,640
Sis, if there's a tear in one eye,
you're fighting.

145
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:13,561
If there's tears in both eyes… breakup!

146
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:18,566
Just kidding. You're too serious.

147
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,901
That little gossip told me.

148
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:24,321
We're not fighting!

149
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,448
So what?

150
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:33,289
Misunderstanding. I don't know.

151
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,834
Do we need to put a label on it?
Can't we just fix it?

152
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:43,883
Sis, it's like this,
since you're not so fond of labels!

153
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:45,843
That's the last time.

154
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,511
That's my last, then.

155
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:52,349
The important question is,
can it still be fixed?

156
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:03,777
That's the spirit!
Cheers. Keep hoping, sis.

157
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:08,616
If I were you… I'd fix that immediately.

158
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,368
Look at me, last night, I was this close.

159
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,832
Go on, stop being fussy.

160
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,188
Hey, Miguel!

161
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,440
Has it happened already?

162
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:44,068
Hey! Lara! What are you doing here?

163
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,615
Stay here.

164
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:56,372
Boss Julio's asking
if we can just stick around here?

165
00:15:57,122 --> 00:16:00,167
Your boss promised to pay up every week!

166
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,711
Can you even put up the money?

167
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:06,006
We're really short. There's too much
competition on the street.

168
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,883
What the fuck do you mean by "short"?

169
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,010
Hey, Lara, where you going?

170
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,887
We need to do something.

171
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,599
Fuck! Is that my problem?

172
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:18,227
- You think that's on me?
- We're figuring it out.

173
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,521
- You need a little persuading.
- Whoa, wait!

174
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:21,730
Hey!

175
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,984
- We're doing what we can!
- Help! Help! Someone's fighting!

176
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:28,445
Help! Help! Help!

177
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:29,822
Don't come near me.

178
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:32,491
- Think you're so tough, asshole?
- I'll fire!

179
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:33,492
Then fire it!

180
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,286
- You arrogant punk!
- Don't come near me!

181
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,373
Fuck you… shoot me!

182
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:49,967
What?

183
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:17,036
Thank you for the statement, ma'am, sir.
We'll have one of our cars take you home.

184
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:43,771
This is tough.

185
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,484
Part of me feels guilty.

186
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,028
But the other part doesn't.

187
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,324
Because I know he's not a good man.

188
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:00,829
But that's it.

189
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:05,334
I know he's a bad man.

190
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:09,546
I couldn't help trying to help him.

191
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:14,009
Even if I knew
he wouldn't do the same for me,

192
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,053
if the tables were turned.

193
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,977
That's because you're a good man, Miguel.

194
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:37,199
You think we were given these abilities
because supposedly…

195
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,661
Supposedly our judgment's sound?

196
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:44,498
Supposedly we can handle
the responsibility.

197
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:50,379
Maybe for you, yes.

198
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,507
But not for me.

199
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:59,096
I'm not even sure
if I'm a good person or not.

200
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:05,561
I only saw one side.

201
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:09,523
I didn't think
of the ramifications on others.

202
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:16,029
So I just did what I thought was right.

203
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:22,744
But now, it's like, I'm not really sure.

204
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:48,228
It flew, then it came back.

205
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:52,816
Big sis, my head is spinning.
What could happen next?

206
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,569
That's why we need
to observe the two of them closely!

207
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,070
So we know how they act.

208
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,238
Two?

209
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,718
Who are you?

210
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:29,394
One, two. Juanito.

211
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:34,733
- Is that your age or your name?
- Both.

212
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,444
What do you need?

213
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,660
Regarding the…

214
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,496
anomalies…

215
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:50,457
that have been happening
these past few days.

216
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,917
We don't have animals here.

217
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,753
So, what is it that you're looking for?

218
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,838
That was not our fault.

219
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,258
How can you be sure?

220
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:04,137
Your app is buggy!
That's what you get from always updating.

221
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:15,065
the problem is coming from here,
on the surface.

222
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:17,067
- Who is your superior?
- You're done for!

223
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:20,529
- Let's talk to your superior.
- Excuse me!

224
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:21,905
That's off limits.

225
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:23,782
This is a part.

226
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:29,746
Part of protocol.
Part of inspection. Excuse me!

227
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:46,221
Nothing? Nothing. Nothing. Right?

228
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,476
Looks like nothing.

229
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,062
There really is nothing. Period.

230
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,241
We got a good job. Don't fight.

231
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,959
- Aren't you done yet?
- I'll be back!

232
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:23,175
Sis! Sis! I was so scared!
What was that? We almost got caught!

233
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:25,427
We shouldn't be lax!

234
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,262
Good thing that was an idiot!

235
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:30,807
If not… God! We're busted!

236
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,227
Okay, so wait? What are going to do?

237
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:40,067
Those two.
We should find a way to stop them!
