1
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,738
Where did you go?

2
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:32,532
Another anomaly happened
while you were gone.

3
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:33,658
Wait up, sister.

4
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:38,288
This is so boring.

5
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:41,374
- Come on, let's move closer.
- What do you mean move closer?

6
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:46,296
We can do left or right.

7
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:51,134
Sister, they were being followed,
I saw them.

8
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:53,386
What do you mean "followed'?

9
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,849
She said it was the…

10
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,518
He's aware of the two.

11
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:03,688
I just don't know what his plans
for them are.

12
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,234
What is he doing here?

13
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:12,322
Aren't the higher ups even curious?

14
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,659
sister, all this time.

15
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:19,788
At least I know who's behind this

16
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:22,415
and why a lot of other people
are being affected.

17
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:30,089
Okay. We need to stop them.

18
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,467
Or else, they'll be in danger!

19
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,385
Stop them how?

20
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:38,640
We don't even know
how they're connected to all of this!

21
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:07,103
You sure you don't want
to hitch a ride home?

22
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:10,106
Yes, yes, I'm good,
promise, it's okay, I'll be fine.

23
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:15,486
Come on! Ems won't mind. It's nothing.

24
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,823
Poch always hitches a ride
even if he can afford a Grab.

25
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,784
No really, it's really okay, promise,
I'm good.

26
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,995
- You sure?
- I am, yes. Go on.

27
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:26,247
- Promise?
- Yes. I'll be fine here.

28
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,249
- This is me.
- All right, take care.

29
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,709
Okay, take care. See you.

30
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:32,712
You sure?

31
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,306
Hello. Come on. Hop in.
We'll take you home.

32
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:49,229
No, no need, ma'am, I'm really okay.
I also live a little far away. Cavite.

33
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,105
No need, it's fine.

34
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,566
That means we'll be together longer.

35
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,569
- Come on, we'll take you home. Hop in.
- Ma'am.

36
00:03:57,278 --> 00:04:00,990
I won't allow you
to go home to Cavite alone at this hour.

37
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,116
Okay.

38
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,952
- I'm really fine, ma'am…
- Come on.

39
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,787
- Come on.
- All right, ma'am.

40
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,724
Not yet.

41
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,269
Have you eaten?

42
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:33,815
We had dinner.

43
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:44,701
Ma'am, yes.
We had dinner already, Auntie, thank you.

44
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,620
Did you just call me Auntie?

45
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,298
What do you think we should do?

46
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,717
I don't know. I'm the youngest.

47
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,303
- Big sister.
- Yes.

48
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:09,559
If they save more lives,
there are more red threads.

49
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,436
- This is orange.
- Yeah.

50
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:17,108
But we got lucky at the last inspection.

51
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:21,988
But I cannot let that…
I cannot let that happen again!

52
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:23,406
That was a close call!

53
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:35,710
- No!
- Here we go again!

54
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,638
What would we do there, Ma?

55
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,308
What kind of event, Auntie?

56
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:53,394
Like he said, it's for an NGO,
it's a charity event.

57
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:54,479
Okay.

58
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,606
I'd love to go, Auntie.

59
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:14,082
I don't really have any formal dress.

60
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:27,303
So, you go get her a dress,
then don't forget to fetch her, okay?

61
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,933
Okay. That's a lot of assignments, huh?

62
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,812
He doesn't have to, Auntie,
we can meet halfway.

63
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,614
Are you reading each other's minds?

64
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:50,076
- I'll go ahead.
- Do you have superpowers?

65
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,537
- Thank you, ma'am.
- You two are so sweet!

66
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:00,419
Goodbye, ma'am. Thank you, ma'am.

67
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,599
You know, son…

68
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,036
- Right.
- Right, yes.

69
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,913
So hard to find an errand boy.

70
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,499
- Crosswise.
- Yes, crosswise.

71
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,792
Then, lengthwise.

72
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,336
…but I'll be fine. We all need some time.

73
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,588
That's good.

74
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,274
It's for Lara, that's fine.

75
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:10,573
Are you looking for a dress?

76
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,092
To help you relax.

77
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,012
- What for, ma'am?
- Duh.

78
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,686
So I know what kind of dress to suggest.

79
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:45,918
You really don't have an idea
what you want? Anything?

80
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,129
Any dress will do.

81
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:49,171
Any dress?

82
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,593
It's your first gift to her, right?

83
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,472
Have a sip first.

84
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,494
I don't see one I like.

85
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:06,332
If I were you, son,

86
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:14,006
If you think this is the right dress,

87
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:26,394
- This is it!
- Yes! Thank you, son!

88
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:38,030
If you want,
we can personally deliver that to her.

89
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:44,286
your first glimpse of her,
she should be wearing that.

90
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,962
- All right, game! Free delivery it is!
- Okay!

91
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:57,299
- Just Viber us the address, son.
- Okay.

92
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:21,407
- Are you on something?
- Thank you!

93
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,746
Free delivery, really?

94
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,833
Isn't that ugly dress enough?

95
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:35,796
We have to be very sure
she'll receive this.

96
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:41,218
And she can't go
where she's supposed to go at all costs.

97
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,928
If that happens…

98
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,556
They're going to have a problem.

99
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,183
Yes!

100
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:55,399
You know me and you know these kids,
they're pretty shallow!

101
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,234
Especially at that age.

102
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:00,696
We've got no more petty cash.
Who's having that delivered?

103
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,490
Well, whose idea was it?

104
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:07,036
- Let's decide this way.
- So mature!

105
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,454
- All right.
- So mature!

106
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:09,914
Odd one out!

107
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,754
Anybody home?

108
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,423
Anybody…

109
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,716
Nobody's home.

110
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,427
Oh, I got it!

111
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,850
Still won't come out, huh?

112
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,977
I know somebody's home.

113
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,771
- Hello…
- Wait up, ma'am.

114
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:34,897
Hi!

115
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,149
Who's there?

116
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:38,734
Hey!

117
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:41,695
Is that the dress?

118
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:45,157
Yes. Oh, wait.
I need a picture with the item.

119
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:49,912
Wait, I'll make it a 0.5.

120
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,753
- Wait, one more.
- Oh, it's you! Hello, ma'am!

121
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,713
Oops! I meant hello.

122
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:03,300
Wow. Didn't know you deliver
as far as Cavite.

123
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:10,683
You order, we deliver,
to any part of the earth.

124
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:17,773
Wow. Such fun commuting to Cavite
during rush hour, yes!

125
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:20,442
The air is so fresh,

126
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:25,990
and it's not so hot,
and I'm thinking of so many things!

127
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:29,076
Good thing your boyfriend
ordered a dress for you.

128
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:31,245
Oh no, he's… He's not my boyfriend.

129
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:34,331
Seriously?
But why are you always together?

130
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:37,668
Oh, that's why.

131
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:39,044
That's why what?

132
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:42,047
That's why I keep seeing him
with different women.

133
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,340
- Huh?
- Sorry.

134
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:47,761
Yes, sometimes it's a tall girl,
sometimes short.

135
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:51,557
One of them actually looked like you!
Like an actress too!

136
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,018
I heard they even flew to Taiwan!

137
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,269
Sorry.

138
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:59,064
But you're probably the third girl
I've delivered a dress to.

139
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,817
Or are you the fourth?
I'm not sure anymore.

140
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,444
There's so many of them.

141
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:07,406
Men today start fooling around
at such a young age.

142
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:11,076
That's why you need to be careful, girl.

143
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,788
Miguel doesn't fool around!

144
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:17,124
Really, seriously, he doesn't.

145
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:22,379
It must have been a really long trip
for you to think of so many things, ma'am.

146
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,590
- I beg your pardon!
- Yes, ma'am.

147
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:27,301
Your imagination
must be working double time.

148
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:30,304
Best to go home now, ma'am. Take care.

149
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,723
Thank you, ma'am, thank you!

150
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,767
Try the dress on…

151
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,525
Cancel order, big sis!

152
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,782
I RECEIVED THE DRESS

153
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:12,680
<i>That's why I keep seeing him</i>
<i>with different women.</i>

154
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:15,724
<i>Yes, sometimes it's a tall girl,</i>
<i>sometimes short.</i>

155
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,227
<i>One of them actually looked like you!</i>

156
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:41,250
<i>- Success?</i>
- I don't know.

157
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,211
She hasn't come out yet.

158
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:49,299
If she was really going, she should've
left a long while back, right?

159
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:53,345
<i>Come back here! You're just wasting time!</i>

160
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,556
Now as in… Oh, wait.

161
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:00,936
Yes, yes, I'm on my way,
I need to pick up Miguel first.

162
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:25,169
Coming! I've got this, Miggy!

163
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:28,505
- You got this, Nanny Arg?
- You might get sweaty.

164
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:29,882
I'm coming!

165
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,604
She's a little cranky!

166
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,360
Is that really the dress I bought for you?

167
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:52,738
What do you think?

168
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:57,409
You really go around doing that,
don't you?

169
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:58,827
Doing what?

170
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,248
Will you stop it, Miguel?

171
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:06,877
You think you can string me along
by sending me a dress?

172
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,170
Who were you with?

173
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:12,549
Somebody told me you love fooling around
with different women.

174
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:16,095
I hear you send them all dresses.

175
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:23,602
Know what, this is such an ugly dress.

176
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:28,398
The only reason I accepted it is
because I took pity on you.

177
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,651
And I don't want to embarrass you.

178
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,877
Sorry, I don't know what came over me.

179
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,839
Sorry.
Sorry if I said something offensive.

180
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,091
It's okay.

181
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,051
Everything's okay.

182
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:57,362
How was last night?

183
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:02,701
You and Miguel looked so serious,
I didn't want to disturb you.

184
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:06,371
- Wait, wait. Are you together?
- Ma, stop it!

185
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,499
I'll tell you later.
Hello, sir. Good morning.

186
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,960
Sorry. I haven't introduced you yet.

187
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,754
Lara, your Uncle Chris.

188
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:16,256
We were high school buddies.

189
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,098
Sir, sir, are you okay?

190
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:30,270
At the hospital! You almost got run over!

191
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:37,694
Wait, this was what
you were telling me about?

192
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:46,245
- Lara, by the way, sir.
- Thank you.

193
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:49,706
You said we were on the phone
right before that happened.

194
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,834
Yes, we were talking
as I was leaving the hospital.

195
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,796
It's as if you sent your daughter
to save me.

196
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:07,724
- I have another appointment.
- What?

197
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,644
- You aren't done with coffee.
- Take some with you, sir.

198
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:27,119
- All right, Doc. Thank you. Take care.
- Thank you, thank you.

199
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:30,372
- Win.
- Bye, Doc.

200
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,916
- Doc, take care.
- Yes, you too.

201
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,252
We still have a lot
to talk about next time.

202
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,755
- Take care.
- Take care.

203
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:48,765
So? What's up? Are you two together?

204
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:52,477
- Ma, stop it.
- Stop what?

205
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:55,022
That Miguel is so handsome!

206
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:01,862
We're not there yet, Ma.

207
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:06,158
Also, something happened last night.

208
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:07,909
I said something…

209
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:12,539
Whatever. We're not at that stage yet.

210
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:18,712
So what are you?
What do you call that? MU?

211
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:22,215
I don't know what that is, Ma.
What's an MU?

212
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:25,427
You kids really don't know
the terms anymore!

213
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,179
Non-exclusive!

214
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:31,767
Your mom jokes are so corny, Ma.

215
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,269
You're like Dad with his dad jokes.

216
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,901
But seriously, Lara.

217
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:44,196
If you had a fight, and there's a problem,

218
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:49,284
but you know how to fix it, fix it now.

219
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:53,288
Sometimes all it takes
is a little conversation,

220
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:55,791
a little tenderness.

221
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,584
Make him understand.

222
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:05,175
I brought someone to life
that I feel has potential.

223
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:09,429
I feel he has the makings
of an Olympic gold medalist!

224
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:13,141
- You could be right.
- Told you.

225
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:16,853
It's been awhile
since we anointed someone like this.

226
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,190
- This one deserves it.
- Should be yearly.

227
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:22,234
I thought we were going to unwind.

228
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:24,486
Why are we still talking about work?

229
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:28,073
- Big sister's in a mood again.
- That's okay.

230
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:31,034
You know what's even weirder?

231
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:36,456
It was delivered to my house
by one of the women at the Atelier.

232
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,168
You think they did this to us?

233
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:43,421
What? Like they're witches?

234
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:48,677
Know what though,
with everything that's happening,

235
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:53,390
that wouldn't be impossible.

236
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:58,854
But, to be honest…

237
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:04,901
you still looked gorgeous
even if the dress wasn't good.

238
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:10,699
Really?

239
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,702
Yes, really!

240
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,920
- She's so pretty.
- Pretty, yes, so pretty.

241
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:32,971
- Here it comes!
- Shots, motherfucker!

242
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:35,599
- We got shots!
- Intense!

243
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,575
No more chasers!

244
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:05,045
We need to be more aggressive about this!
If not, we're fucked!

245
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:08,924
Can we really not talk to them directly?

246
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:12,719
They're smart kids. We can explain to them

247
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,972
the effects of their deeds on the world.

248
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:19,976
I'm sure they'll understand
why they need to break up.

249
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:31,613
Isn't "idiots" a little harsh?
They're still our kids.

250
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:32,697
Precisely.

251
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,241
They're not my kids!

252
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:38,662
I just cut their lives off.
I don't care who they are as people.

253
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:56,096
I MIGHT GO TO SLEEP

254
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:58,014
HOW ABOUT YOU? CAN'T SLEEP YET?

255
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:02,352
WE'RE STILL PLAYING.

256
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,816
ARE YOU WINNING?

257
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:12,946
WHENEVER YOU REPLY, YES.

258
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:18,868
SO, I'M YOUR LUCKY CHARM!

259
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:29,754
THAT'S WHY WE WERE DESTINED TO MEET

260
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,758
YOU'RE SO ANNOYING!

261
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:36,011
BE THANKFUL YOU'RE MY FAVORITE HAHAHAHAHA

262
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:41,099
What's with the "hahaha"?

263
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:48,440
SAMEDT.

264
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:49,649
That's it?

265
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:52,319
Same?

266
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:05,832
YOU'RE MY MOST FAVORITE OF ALL.

267
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:15,258
THAT'S A FLIRTY WINK EMOJI HAHAHAHAHAHAHA

268
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,844
GOOD NIGHT!
I'M SURE, YOU HAVE ALREADY LOST THE GAME

269
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:21,222
IT'S FINE. WITH YOU, I'M THE WINNER.

270
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:28,021
STOP
