1
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,701
Stop taking pictures of me!

2
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:40,952
Sorry, sir.

3
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,791
- Buy something, kid.
- Maybe next time.

4
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,208
Hello, ma'am. Do you do alterations?

5
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,171
At her age,

6
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,183
It's not like we have other customers.

7
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,559
Let me see.

8
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,603
Oh, sure, ma'am!

9
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:49,687
Here you go.

10
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,689
- There it is!
- It's just a dress.

11
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:53,816
Thrift shop.

12
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,987
It's free size,
a little loose in the waist.

13
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,782
I'm usually a small,
that's why it doesn't--

14
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:05,870
Smedium?

15
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,748
You're not a small,
but you're an almost-medium.

16
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:09,874
Oh, medium.

17
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:13,169
I'll fix this. You wait here.
Go look around.

18
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:18,299
Put weights on the trees.
Wind will tip them over.

19
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,425
Minmin, hurry!

20
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:23,513
This isn't Valentine's Day.
Think group of friends.

21
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,557
Micah, set that up already please.

22
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,645
Sissy, help!

23
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:32,522
I'm so tired!

24
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:33,648
Fight?

25
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:35,483
Why's this still here?

26
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,238
Isn't it a little early for chaos?

27
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:43,366
Because that's all life has to offer,
chaos!

28
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,450
Gi!

29
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,828
Taste test, Gi .

30
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,123
- No fork?
- Use your hands.

31
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:56,504
Get out of here! Why's that so good?

32
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:57,714
Of course!

33
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:59,757
What's up with that?

34
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:14,355
Sis! Love it!

35
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:18,401
- Is it okay?
- So good! Go! I'll play this tonight.

36
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,611
You could've just e-mailed this to me.

37
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,864
Just to see my reaction?

38
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:24,991
Why? Don't you want to see me?

39
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,660
Or you don't want to pay?

40
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,247
Harsh! I was gonna GCash the money to you!

41
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,709
But later. After all this chaos is done.

42
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:37,128
Double time, guys! Look at the time!

43
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:39,714
- Thank you. Thanks for the gig.
- Of course!

44
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:42,383
How's your event going?
Did anyone RSVP yet?

45
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,552
Yes, some ten-ish.

46
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,263
- Ten?
- On Facebook.

47
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,892
But that's fine. Fingers crossed.

48
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,269
Fingers crossed, pray.

49
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:56,105
This place will be like
a train station tonight.

50
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,982
Packed like sardines.

51
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,532
Wow!

52
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,410
Gorgeous.

53
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:12,163
- Fits perfectly!
- Told you you were a smedium.

54
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:15,374
We're almost the same size,
but I'm a small and you're…

55
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,920
Thank you. Thank you, ma'am.

56
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:21,589
What was that?
Did you just call me "ma'am"?

57
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:29,430
Don't mind our sister.
She thinks she's still a teenager.

58
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,265
Oh, you're siblings?

59
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,184
Yes. We just don't look we are.

60
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:36,270
My baby face makes you look like
my older sister.

61
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,026
- Thank you, ma'am…
- What was that?

62
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,736
Thank you, I mean… How much?

63
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,987
On the house!

64
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,697
- On the house?
- Yes!

65
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:50,368
- Thank you, ma'am…
- Go ahead, go ahead.

66
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,716
She called me ma'am. Me.

67
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:22,418
Miggy, son, didn't we agree you would call
if it rained too hard?

68
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,046
- It's just water, Nanny Arj.
- Water.

69
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,590
- Also, I have an umbrella.
- Umbrella, right.

70
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,509
Wait, stay there.

71
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,219
Have you seen how you look?

72
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,179
Look at you.

73
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,849
Stay there, don't move!

74
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,602
I'll go get towels.

75
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:58,412
Here you go. Wait here.
I'll make some soup.

76
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,252
Yes!

77
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:10,174
I'll update you right away. All right.

78
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,427
Where have you been?

79
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,562
Speak up, it's raining hard. Okay?

80
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,412
All right.

81
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,549
Were you ignored?

82
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,262
Me too.

83
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,917
Lara? You get caught in the rain?

84
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,379
You're soaking wet!

85
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,008
You forgot to take your umbrella again?

86
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:37,720
I didn't know it was going to rain, Ma.
It was so sunny when I left.

87
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:41,891
Doesn't matter how sunny it gets.
We live in the Philippines.

88
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,893
There's always a chance of rain.

89
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,313
And you even waded through the flood.

90
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,441
I had no choice, Ma.

91
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:53,736
I was so stressed by the rain.
I just wanted to go home--

92
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,822
Better be stressed than sick.

93
00:10:56,906 --> 00:11:00,576
You might end up like Mikmik, Lydia's son.

94
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,497
Waded through the flood
just to go the computer shop.

95
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,499
And voila! <i>Leptospirosis!</i>

96
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,626
Ma, I don't get sick easily.

97
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:11,837
My health card hasn't been used,
not even once.

98
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,256
Stop that! You might jinx it and get sick!

99
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,342
Get changed, let's have dinner!

100
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,427
I have a deadline I need to meet.

101
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,181
- I'll come knock when it's time.
- All right, Ma.

102
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:23,724
You need to eat.

103
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,140
- They're not important!
- Our partners then?

104
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:48,976
Those who actually need the card
are important.

105
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,074
They're not the ones we're targeting!

106
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,039
The ones without benefits!

107
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,234
Anyway…

108
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,885
ALREADY SENDING, BOSS, IT'S AT 80%.

109
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:38,878
Please let the data work.

110
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,026
Doc, Doc, he's awake.

111
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,156
I told you not to go out in the rain!

112
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:50,824
Where's Ma?

113
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,993
I tried waking her up,
she wouldn't get up.

114
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,537
I almost brought her here too.

115
00:15:55,621 --> 00:16:00,459
Miguel, are you in any pain
or feel any discomfort?

116
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,628
Tell the doc.

117
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:16,183
You said he was hit by lightning?

118
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:19,353
That's what the witness said,
the security guard.

119
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,897
- I was hit by lightning?
- Yes.

120
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,733
Wait, my camera, Nanny Arj?
Did you get it?

121
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,736
Burnt to a crisp.
I left it downstairs with Ems.

122
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,823
Wait, how did that happen?

123
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:20,039
I thought you were meeting a deadline,
child, why…

124
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,167
What happened to you?

125
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:27,379
I'll take your vital signs first,
just to be sure, okay?

126
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,444
What's the matter? Did something hurt?

127
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,950
Just a dizzy spell, Doc.

128
00:17:57,034 --> 00:18:00,621
Just take it easy. Take it easy.
Lie down please.

129
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:35,447
Are you saying
that I'm making this all up, Doc?

130
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:47,000
All right, Doc.

131
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,465
- We good, ma'am?
- Yes, sir.

132
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:06,163
Shall we go?

133
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:19,009
Sisters, it's almost 11:00…

134
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,930
They went ahead without me?

135
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:01,551
We'll look for other solutions,
other treatments.

136
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,428
I won't leave your side.

137
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,462
Are you okay?

138
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:40,299
If you want to get killed, do it yourself!

139
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:43,593
Dr. Madiaga, what happened?
We'll take it from here.

140
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:51,226
Just stay put. We're being picked up here.

141
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:59,901
- What did you do?
- Nothing!

142
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,278
Why me?

143
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:02,571
You were holding it.

144
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:06,199
- You said it was his time!
- It was!

145
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,617
What did the app say?

146
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:14,833
Wait, I think there's a problem
with the app.
