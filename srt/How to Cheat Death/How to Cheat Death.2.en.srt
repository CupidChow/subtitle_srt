1
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:16,391
They've messaged thrice already.

2
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:18,351
What do they want now?

3
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:21,187
WHY IS CHRISTOPHER R. MADIAGA
NOT WITH US? ANSWER US!

4
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:23,481
How can you read it without being "seen"?

5
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:25,316
- Just hold.
- Hold… like this?

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,651
- What're you doing?
- Wait…

7
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:28,319
Sorry! I didn't mean to!

8
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:33,867
Big sis, what are you doing?

9
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,584
Hello! Yes, what is it?
How can we help you?

10
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:46,713
<i>We detected an anomaly in the records.</i>

11
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:51,509
<i>Christopher Madiaga was due yesterday.</i>
<i>We scheduled him for 11:53 a.m.</i>

12
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:55,555
Oh! I cut that yesterday.
Maybe there's a problem with the app?

13
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:59,726
Right. Your wi-fi's always at one bar
but we get blamed for anomalies.

14
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:02,103
<i>The app has no bugs.</i>

15
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,147
<i>We tested that already…</i>

16
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,398
<i>Right?</i>

17
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:13,948
Hey! What'd you do?

18
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,784
We got disconnected.

19
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,507
What is that?

20
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,593
- Is that only happening now?
- It's been looking at it for a bit.

21
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,054
Big sis…

22
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,788
- Good afternoon!
- Holy cow!

23
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,123
Where's Migs?

24
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,462
Hey, shoes off. I just cleaned the house.

25
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:52,672
Sorry.

26
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:11,149
This was struck by lightning.

27
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:18,197
- Hi.
- Good afternoon, Auntie.

28
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:25,204
What do you mean
your camera was struck by lightning?

29
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:29,500
Not just the camera, ma'am.

30
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:32,170
Lightning struck him too.

31
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,338
What?

32
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:35,840
Are you trying to be funny, Arjie?

33
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:38,384
That only happens in movies.

34
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:46,184
Sorry, ma'am,
I was trying to wake you up last night.

35
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:50,188
But you were sleeping so soundly.

36
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,034
Still alive.

37
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:05,954
Anyway… Poch and I are going up.

38
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,164
- Miguel…
- Don't worry, Auntie.

39
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,666
Leave Migs to me.

40
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,754
It really happened, dumbass.

41
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,467
Make sure it's good, Aljon.
That's for Lara.

42
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,929
- How's your inventory?
- It's done.

43
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,348
Better make sure. Come on!

44
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,685
Hey! No littering here, girl.

45
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:31,104
I can't find my wallet.

46
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:34,107
Where'd it go? So you can't pay for this?

47
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:39,362
You can't pay for this.
Now you have to wash the dishes.

48
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:43,491
You need to get even the 1% of germs
that the soap can't.

49
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,036
Kidding! Here you go!

50
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,331
That's on the house because I love you.
Order whatever.

51
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,127
I remember taking it out at the hospital.

52
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,630
Such a hassle if I have to go back!

53
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:01,259
If there's nothing important in it,
just buy a new one.

54
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,221
All my IDs are in it, dork.

55
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,017
True. You can always try calling.

56
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,519
All hospitals have a Lost and Found.

57
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:29,412
The higher ups must be bored,

58
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,540
that's why things
are being fucked up here.

59
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:36,711
Actually, I'm anxious to know their plans
for what's going on.

60
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,797
Plans? The higher ups?

61
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:43,051
They're probably just messing with us.

62
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,719
This is some serious messing up.

63
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:47,597
Five lives in exchange for one?

64
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:49,974
I don't get it.

65
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:01,819
- That's right, Poch! Fuck, man!
- Damn it, dude!

66
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,367
Such a bad player, dude.

67
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:11,412
- You're a bad player!
- I'm the bad player?

68
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:14,123
Can't even tell left from right.
How stupid is that?

69
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:17,543
Yo! Poch! Come on!

70
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:23,466
- You have a wallet…
- Don't touch that!

71
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:24,926
Dude, game!

72
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:27,178
Weren't you bragging
you live cashless now?

73
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,640
The fuck do you care?

74
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:35,812
I know! Game time, Poch!

75
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,038
It's not mine.
I picked it up at the hospital.

76
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,750
I told you, I got struck by lightning!

77
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,255
I don't know how to return it.

78
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:07,051
I've got so many deaths already.
Do something about it.

79
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,554
Poch!

80
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,714
God, you're too fucking shy.

81
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:48,509
Okay, thank you.

82
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,013
Did anyone find it?

83
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,682
- Nope.
- The hell?

84
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:58,352
Whoever found it probably
has no plans to give it back.

85
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,689
That's fine, I can lend you money.

86
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:09,489
Hi?

87
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:12,492
Hi?

88
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,286
Random stranger slides into your DMs?

89
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:17,413
You go, girl!

90
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,499
Gi! Enough!

91
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,678
That's the guy
I bumped into at the hospital!

92
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:34,764
- Shy?
- Yeah.

93
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,724
Here's shy for you!

94
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:44,857
Yeah? Good for you!

95
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:55,535
I TOOK IT BY ACCIDENT. SORRY.

96
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,121
My wallet's with him!

97
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:03,834
There you go! Divine providence!

98
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,461
Just have it delivered.

99
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,882
CAN I HAVE IT PICKED UP
AND DELIVERED TO ME?

100
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,220
Oh. She just wants it delivered.

101
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:17,390
That's weak shit, bro. Ask to meet up.

102
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,201
He wants to meet.

103
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:40,204
- He likes you.
- Calm down, Gi!

104
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:43,082
Know what? Meet up with him here.

105
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,918
So I can have sure customers.
Place is drawing flies.

106
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,801
There you go!

107
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:19,952
What happened?

108
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,934
What's your order, sir?

109
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,853
- One iced tea please.
- All right.

110
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:47,563
The fuck? Iced tea? Seriously?

111
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,606
So what?

112
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,906
- It's him.
- Confirmed? It's him?

113
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,532
- It's him! Walk over.
- No way!

114
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,993
Why me? Shouldn't he walk over to me?

115
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:04,955
If he doesn't see you,
he walks away with your wallet.

116
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:11,754
Ouch! That hurts!

117
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,757
You've been anxiously waiting,
now that he's here, you freeze.

118
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,716
What's that?

119
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,928
- You have a crush on him?
- Crush? So soon? No way!

120
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,763
Then what?

121
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:26,060
- Walk over, will you?
- Can you just wait?

122
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,729
That's the problem with you!

123
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:33,192
- You act as if you had a past.
- No, I don't!

124
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:40,866
Ready?

125
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,079
Go talk to him!

126
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:47,123
I can do this!

127
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,500
I believe in you, I trust you.
I'll just be here.

128
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,585
Hey, it's her!

129
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:52,837
Sound.

130
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,550
How is it? Okay?

131
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:44,013
I would definitely date it.

132
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:48,893
You're bringing a date here?
Perfect! We have a Valentine Special.

133
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,439
Of course I have! I own the place.

134
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:58,068
Oh. Well, in that case,
welcome to my life.

135
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:14,126
So, is Ice Ice Water
our peg for today's video?

136
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:23,385
What? Wait, you got struck by lightning!

137
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,303
When?

138
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,724
Me too!

139
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,185
We need to talk.

140
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,520
Come on. We need to talk.

141
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:33,771
- Right now?
- Yes!

142
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:37,024
Go, sis!

143
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:40,778
That's why you're my girl!

144
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,742
That we can see
what happens in the future?

145
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,331
I got it!

146
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,375
Bump into me.

147
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:58,420
- What?
- You heard me. Bump me.

148
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,882
- How? Ouch!
- There!

149
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,053
- You feel something?
- Nothing.

150
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:10,182
- There! How about that?
- Nothing. Just hurts a bit.

151
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:19,900
How about now?

152
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,070
Anything?

153
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:26,448
Nothing!

154
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:35,291
It'll be weirder
if we really saw something.

155
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:38,085
But we did see something at the hospital.
What was that?

156
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:42,339
Deja vu! Or maybe we had a dream
that just happened in real life.

157
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:45,259
No, no, that wasn't a dream.

158
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:48,637
It really happened! We saw the future.

159
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,932
Then we saw someone who almost died
but we saved him.

160
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:58,439
But it happened.
So, what, that means nothing?

161
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,359
I think it's just a coincidence.

162
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,905
Coincidence? Then why…

163
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,158
Why were you looking at me?

164
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,371
Just found me pretty?

165
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:16,832
Of course not!

166
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,545
I'm not pretty?

167
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,969
Yes… you're pretty. No…

168
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,180
That's really not what I meant!

169
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:42,566
You mean we could really see the future?
That's impossible! No…

170
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,999
Do you see what I see?

171
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:08,425
I think, I may have had
too much to drink. Wow.

172
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,886
No, no. I see it too.

173
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,561
Big sis!

174
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:32,491
Maybe the higher ups
have some kind of event and…

175
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:35,077
I don't know.
I don't read the memos anymore.

176
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,746
Probably just didn't see the invite.

177
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,804
Okay. I'll just message you.

178
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,517
Why?

179
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:02,229
Because we still have lots to talk about.

180
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:06,734
Thanks, Nanny Arj.

181
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:12,322
Oh, Miguel. Got a new one already?

182
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:34,303
You that sleepy, huh?

183
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,080
What?

184
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:02,748
Are they fighting?

185
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,125
- Arjie?
- Wanna bet?

186
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,502
- Arjie.
- Ma'am?

187
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,462
Can you please clean the car for later.

188
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,297
I'm cleaning the car for later.

189
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,635
- On it, ma'am.
- Thank you.

190
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,543
What time are we leaving?

191
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,504
As soon as your mother's drunk.

192
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,591
Or soon as you get jacked on coffee?

193
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:11,919
SORRY THIS IS SO RANDOM,
BUT DID YOU SEE SOMETHING?

194
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:14,922
I THINK I'M HEARING THINGS.

195
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:17,925
- You ready?
- Almost, Ma!

196
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:20,761
Hurry up! We might get caught in traffic.

197
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,102
Miguel!

198
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:34,399
<i>I saw something.</i>

199
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:39,363
Let's go.

200
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:41,615
- I'll text you.
- Wait! Where are you going?

201
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:44,201
I'll explain later.
Text me when you get there.

202
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:46,245
What's happening, why are you in a rush…

203
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,500
Right. I'm talking to myself.

204
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:55,796
Nanny Arj!

205
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,174
Nanny Arj! Where's Dad?

206
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,218
Did he leave?

207
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:07,432
Your dad left, then your mom left.
You should follow them and go now.

208
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:36,837
- Miguel.
- Lara.

209
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,630
Did you see something?

210
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,675
Did you hear something?

211
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,404
Miguel, where's your dad now?

212
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:07,117
At… At an event.

213
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,618
But…

214
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,120
But wait…

215
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:14,082
What we saw, that was here.

216
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,208
That was here!

217
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:19,212
If that was true, where's my mom and me?

218
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,506
That also wasn't what he was wearing.

219
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:26,636
The shirt. The shirt!
That was a "Helping Hands" shirt!

220
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,513
- Helping Hands?
- NGO.

221
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,390
Ma works for them.

222
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:33,852
Maybe… Maybe they're in the same event!

223
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:37,355
Wait, let me call Ma.
Maybe she's with your dad.

224
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,608
Please. I'll try calling them too.

225
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:49,951
What if we make another mistake?

226
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,370
I've cut so many threads
since the last anomaly!

227
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,000
I don't want to see red threads again.

228
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,795
- Has your dad replied yet?
- Not yet.

229
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:01,797
Neither has Ma.

230
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:07,511
Can you drive faster, sir?
It's an emergency. Thank you.

231
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:10,222
Jaime Imperial's time is up.

232
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,060
This is as far as he gets.

233
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:18,480
That's Dad's car.

234
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,774
- Sir, can we go back?
- Go back?

235
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:23,110
Yes, sir. Just follow that black car.

236
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,084
Nanny Arj!

237
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:24,588
What happened to sir?

238
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,217
I'll call for help!

239
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,305
I'm calling an ambulance!

240
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:39,144
Help! Where are these people
when you need them?

241
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:41,646
- Help us!
- Dad!
