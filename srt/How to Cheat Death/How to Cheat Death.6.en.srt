1
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:13,346
- Here's more.
- Let me do that.

2
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,016
- Thank you, thank you.
- Wow. This smells so good.

3
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:20,478
- Diets aren't allowed here.
- Yes, ma'am. Thanks for cooking.

4
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:23,106
There she is! Finally, you're up!

5
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:26,192
Our handsome guest needs entertaining.

6
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:27,485
Good morning!

7
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:31,156
- Hey!
- I'm not wearing a bra, Ma!

8
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:34,576
Just drape the towel over you
and come here quickly!

9
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:38,705
Thank you, that's enough,
you've already done so much.

10
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:40,248
It's fine, ma'am.

11
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,210
What are you doing here?

12
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:45,587
Your ma invited me.

13
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:50,884
Miss Jasmin can invite my daughter.
I can't invite her son?

14
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,639
Go, take a seat.

15
00:00:56,723 --> 00:01:00,018
Good thing, Miguel, she woke up
on the right side of the bed.

16
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,813
You know what, give me your plate, son.

17
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:07,233
When she was in grade school
and I had to wake her up at 5:00 a.m.,

18
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:11,529
she'd pretend she was sick.
She'd give all sorts of excuses.

19
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:14,157
Your daughter's a lifelong
master of excuses, Auntie!

20
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,328
You said it! Even in high school,
when she started going out!

21
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:21,164
Thank you, ma'am. Yes, like you said.

22
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,041
Ma…

23
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:25,126
what else did you tell him?

24
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,294
A lot!

25
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:28,963
But that's between the two of us.

26
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:32,258
- You're embarrassing me, Ma.
- Me? Embarrass you?

27
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,886
What do you think of me?

28
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:40,016
It's nothing. All your ma told me
was you can't ride a bike.

29
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,604
Sorry, Miguel, she can't say anything.

30
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:46,648
She's terrified.

31
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:50,026
I tried to teach her many times
but she was just too scared.

32
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,488
You should be the one to teach her.

33
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:55,240
Make the fear go away.

34
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:56,616
What do you think?

35
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:57,700
I can do that!

36
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:06,000
Can I ask
why you're so afraid of riding a bike?

37
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,630
This is how Dad died.

38
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:11,923
Riding a bike.

39
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:18,513
He was out riding with his friends
and it was raining.

40
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:19,848
Then, it happened.

41
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,350
That's when he had an accident.

42
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:27,230
Ma probably forgot to mention that part.

43
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,365
We can go back. You don't have to do this.

44
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,535
No, no, I really want to learn.

45
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:43,121
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I am.

46
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:45,915
- You sure? You don't need to do this.
- No.

47
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,210
Mama was right.
I shouldn't be afraid. Game.

48
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,503
Okay. All right.

49
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,339
- Just look straight.
- Okay.

50
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,633
Then, relax your body.

51
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:58,887
There. Relax your arms.
Don't be too tense.

52
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,806
- Okay.
- Then, just pedal away!

53
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:12,108
- Okay?
- Game.

54
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:13,526
- Take it slow first.
- Okay.

55
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,861
Okay?

56
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:17,238
All right. I'll just be here.
I've got you.

57
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,907
- Okay?
- Okay.

58
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,241
The other foot…

59
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,744
- Okay. Let's go. Okay!
- And…

60
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:24,203
There. Pedal!

61
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,956
- Slowly.
- Okay.

62
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,833
- That's it, slowly, okay.
- Okay.

63
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,836
- Steady, relax, look straight.
- Okay, okay.

64
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,671
- Look straight.
- Look straight.

65
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:36,674
- Okay, okay.
- Look straight.

66
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,259
Miguel, is this okay? Miguel?

67
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,678
- Miguel! Hey! Miguel!
- There! Go, Lara, go!

68
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,013
Go! You can do it!

69
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:43,348
Miguel, Miguel, hurry!

70
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:44,599
Miguel…

71
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,814
- Next time you should do it on your own.
- No way! That's too soon!

72
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:21,029
You again? What are you doing here?

73
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,072
Aren't you from the atelier?

74
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:26,993
Let me cut to the chase!
The atelier is nothing but a front.

75
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:30,830
What's important is that you know
both your lives are in danger!

76
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:35,001
Wait, in danger, how?
Is there someone after us?

77
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:37,670
I have a bad feeling about this.

78
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,256
Are you part of a syndicate? What? A gang?

79
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:41,716
I'll call the cops!

80
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:49,140
What's that?

81
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:52,769
Official name? Or what? Girl group?

82
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:56,689
What do you think we are?
Sub-units? Rewind, rewind.

83
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:06,908
They call us by different names.
Morai. Parcae.

84
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:20,922
Those old and ugly ladies in mythology?
Like in the cartoons? That's you?

85
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:24,592
Do I look old and ugly?

86
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:25,885
Is this the new thing?

87
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:28,930
Is "are you open minded"
not a thing anymore?

88
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,692
Now do you believe me?

89
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:46,072
That thing you're doing,
saving people who are supposed to die,

90
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,282
you can't do that anymore!

91
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:49,742
Wait! How did you know--

92
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:54,372
I'll say it again.
We control the threads of life.

93
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,138
So, what?

94
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,806
You're murderers? Is that it?

95
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:25,069
Destiny? Couldn't be bothered
to make our lives a little better?

96
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:31,159
Wait, wait! Does this mean
it's our destiny to have these abilities?

97
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:35,872
We don't know yet
who gave you those abilities.

98
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:43,296
those in the underworld
see it as an opportunity

99
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:46,757
to have more people die.

100
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,311
As in Hell?

101
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:01,397
Yes. Hell.

102
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:07,195
That's why if you don't stop
what you're doing, more people will die!

103
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:10,281
People are dying? Because of us?

104
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,116
Yes.

105
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,995
At this point,
too many people are getting caught up.

106
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:18,748
That's why you cannot be together!

107
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,424
Even we don't know what the purpose
is behind bringing you together.

108
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,514
Just remember…

109
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:46,734
It started with five,
then the number got bigger and bigger.

110
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:48,194
Who are you?

111
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:50,238
I'm Emilia. And you are?

112
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,697
Winona.

113
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,199
Winona…

114
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:54,951
De Guzman?

115
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,411
But who are you? Do you know her?

116
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,372
She's Auntie Jasmin's designer.

117
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:02,708
Yes, ma'am, but she's about to leave.

118
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:06,504
Yes. She's about to leave, right now.
Bye now, take care.

119
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,099
- Have they broken up?
- Not yet.

120
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:28,651
Lara is the daughter of Winona De Guzman.

121
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:29,986
She's sick now.

122
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:33,197
If they find out, especially Lara,

123
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:36,284
for sure she'll find a way
to save her mother!

124
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,328
Wait! That's one of the names
that popped up

125
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,497
when we had that anomaly
with the bartender!

126
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:50,214
No! It's been moved…

127
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:53,384
You know what, in my design,
she would still have four months!

128
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:57,305
- Let's just wait it out.
- More people will be affected it we do!

129
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,599
That's why we should do it now.

130
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,518
I don't want to be caught
in their quarrel.

131
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,855
I thought we didn't meddle
with human lives.

132
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:12,278
Besides, it's her fault that her mother
will die ahead of schedule!

133
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:15,364
Can you hear yourself, big sister?

134
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,075
You think there'll be no trade-off
if we do this?

135
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:32,089
No, big sister, you can't do that!
That's too cruel!

136
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,174
Do it!

137
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,800
- No!
- Emilia!

138
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:38,512
Sis, she still has one week left.
That's unfair to Lara!

139
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:44,101
Or else they won't take
this situation seriously!

140
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:47,563
We will do this to make them stop! Okay?

141
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:54,862
Big sister…

142
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,162
You think what she was saying is true?

143
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:08,959
What if, all this time,
we weren't actually saving lives?

144
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:15,549
I don't know, to…

145
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:21,222
- Why just us?
- I don't know, I don't know.

146
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,518
I'm scared.

147
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,353
Hey, hey…

148
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,190
Don't be scared, okay?

149
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,610
We've been through so much.

150
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:39,281
I know these past few weeks
have been full of confusion,

151
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,540
We're solid. Until now.

152
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:56,465
I don't know
why the two of us were chosen for this.

153
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,260
But I know there's a reason.

154
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:03,472
I'm happy that it was you.

155
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,275
Ma?

156
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:17,486
- Ma! Ma!
- Auntie? Auntie!

157
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,197
- Are you okay? Ma!
- What happened? Are you okay?

158
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:21,949
- I'm okay.
- You sure, Auntie?

159
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,325
- Ma!
- Auntie!

160
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:33,794
…breast cancer. That's the reason
I keep seeing your Uncle Chris.

161
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:37,256
He helped me look for a doctor,

162
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:41,802
but by the time I was diagnosed,
the cancer was in an advanced stage.

163
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:48,934
Why, Ma? Why so sudden, Ma?

164
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:54,023
Did you even plan
on telling me about this?

165
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:23,260
So, what? Why didn't you try to treat her?

166
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:28,891
<i>She didn't want to, and I couldn't</i>
<i>force her. It was her decision.</i>

167
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:34,104
Is this in your oath, Doc?
Letting patients make wrong decisions?

168
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:42,029
<i>Your mom has made her decision.</i>
<i>I need to respect that.</i>

169
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:43,447
But what about me, Doc?

170
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,911
<i>She doesn't want to waste money.</i>

171
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:52,039
You're being very unfair, Doc!
Very, very unfair.

172
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:01,549
Lara…

173
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,595
Hey, wait. Where are you going?

174
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,182
I'm going to the atelier.

175
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,649
Miguel, does it look like Ma has time?

176
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:21,694
Lara, wait.

177
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:37,543
You're still together?

178
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:40,087
Can you do something about my mom's death?

179
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:44,133
Didn't you say
you held the threads of life?

180
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,344
Can you move my mom's death?

181
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:50,556
And why would we do that? Tell me.

182
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:54,268
You want Miguel and I to be apart, right?

183
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:57,146
You want us to stop saving people.

184
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:00,065
We'll do that if you move my mom's death!

185
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:12,453
Girl, even what we do has consequences!

186
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:21,503
Whatever is written is what must happen!

187
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,547
You don't want to interfere.

188
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,551
What do you call
what you're doing to me and Miguel?

189
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:35,142
What's this?

190
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:41,649
That's a list of the people who died
because of what you did!

191
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,487
Including your mom!

192
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,372
Thanks for the visit.

193
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,883
Please, I'm begging you, just this once,

194
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,386
move it, by a little, just a little.

195
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,554
Emilia.

196
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,642
I promise we'll separate for real!

197
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:19,853
Just this! We'll separate right after!

198
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:23,273
We'll stop saving lives!
Promise! Really! Please!

199
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,484
Just this, Emilia.

200
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,551
That was super harsh!

201
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,387
You wanted this, right?

202
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,640
What is meant is what is meant!

203
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,601
That's the job.

204
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:08,736
So, is it our fault
that Ma's going to die?

205
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,450
We're not even sure
if they're telling the truth.

206
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:21,206
Is this the trade-off
for all the lives we saved?

207
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,792
No fair, Miguel! Unfair!

208
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:29,965
Everything's being taken away from me?
First, Papa, Mama, and now, even you!

209
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,886
Even you! We need to be apart!

210
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:37,473
- I will never, ever leave you, Lara.
- Miguel!

211
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:42,644
If we don't separate,
more people who shouldn't die will die!

212
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:44,605
Like Ma!

213
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,490
We need to go back there, we need to…

214
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,992
We need to go back,
maybe there's another way.

215
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:02,164
Maybe, maybe when they're asleep
we can look for another way.

216
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,752
Maybe, maybe it's in the atelier,
maybe we can go back in.

217
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,213
How, Lara?

218
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:15,469
If you don't want to help me,
then don't help me!

219
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:19,098
But I'll do whatever it takes
to keep Ma alive!

220
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,208
Lara.

221
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,044
You knew?

222
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,552
- But--
- You didn't tell me.

223
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,601
We can't stop it anymore, Lara.

224
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,433
Child.

225
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:19,468
- Wait, let me close up.
- I was thinking…

226
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:26,266
Is there really no way
to save Auntie Winona?

227
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:15,565
those are actual people's lives!

228
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,487
we're only doing our job.

229
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,824
If we don't stop you,

230
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:28,036
the underworld
will take advantage of the situation

231
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,123
to increase their numbers!

232
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:53,603
I promise we will stop saving lives!

233
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:23,633
Please talk to me, Child.

234
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,019
You didn't even think of me, Ma.

235
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,858
I think of you every single day.

236
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:47,240
Day in and day out,
I didn't give up for you.

237
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,287
I'm ready.

238
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,501
That's why I'm hoping…

239
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:00,921
you are too.

240
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:06,218
I know you'll be fine even without me.

241
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,553
You're ready.

242
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,682
I'm not.

243
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:18,980
If I could only turn back time, Ma.

244
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:27,489
Child, there are some things in the world
we can't change.

245
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:33,328
I won't turn back time
so I can heal you, Ma.

246
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:38,041
I want to turn back time
so I can be more ready.

247
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:41,044
When Pa died…

248
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,757
I wasn't ready either.

249
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,679
Don't give in.

250
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:54,224
You're braver than this, I know.

251
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:04,276
Even if sometimes you don't believe that.

252
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:12,367
I love you so much, my child.

253
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,626
- I can't do it, I can't.
- Why me?

254
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:23,879
Give it to me!

255
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,214
Do we really need to do this, big sister?

256
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,009
Do you really need to ask me that?

257
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:31,678
They won't separate
just because you told them to.

258
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,691
I know you're still mad at me.

259
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:58,742
But I know Auntie was happy
in her final moments.

260
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,331
I saw it on her face.

261
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,114
I'll drink it, then.

262
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:25,954
How's Lara?

263
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,166
I don't know.

264
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:34,546
You don't know?

265
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:39,300
Aren't you in touch, to console her?

266
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:44,806
I'd like to.

267
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,434
But I can't anymore.

268
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,646
Can't anymore?

269
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:55,608
Have you broken up, son?

270
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:02,657
No.

271
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,454
I don't know.

272
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:12,500
You've been through so much.

273
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:24,596
Lara became such a huge part of my life.

274
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:28,266
So how can it not affect everything?

275
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:47,220
What are you doing here?

276
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:52,851
Come with me, you two.

277
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:57,397
This is what we were saying.

278
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:02,193
You really need to separate.
They're aware of the two of you.

279
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:07,031
Look, we know what connects you now.

280
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,958
You have a divine connection.

281
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:20,169
There's a reason
twin flames are kept apart.

282
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,653
Help!

283
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:08,051
He's here!

284
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:43,211
It's only a matter of time
before they find us again.

285
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,978
I don't want anything bad
to happen to you, Lara.

286
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:05,274
Is there no…

287
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:09,320
Is there no other way,
is there nothing we can…

288
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:11,864
do?

289
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:15,535
There's nothing we can do
other than what they ask for now.

290
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:18,705
The most important thing
is to separate and hide.

291
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:23,376
These threads
are part of your threads of life.

292
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:36,222
you will know
what's going on with the other.

293
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:42,687
<i>This thread is a part of Lara's life.</i>

294
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:49,861
<i>This thread is a part of Miguel's life.</i>

295
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:59,537
<i>Because we know you can't help</i>
<i>but worry about each other.</i>

296
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:22,894
I know this is not the way you imagined

297
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:25,521
how we would say goodbye.

298
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:35,740
And when that day comes,
maybe I can love you,

299
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:39,160
without any lives at stake.
