1
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:12,090
Winona, ma'am. Helping Hands Foundation.

2
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:32,402
Ma'am, we just wanted to say
how much we appreciated Sir Jaime.

3
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,364
If he didn't help us in Cavite,

4
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:41,161
there would be a lot less people
with decent healthcare.

5
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:55,133
We really feel like we lost a true ally.

6
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:01,180
Hopefully, even if he's gone,

7
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:06,060
all his plans
to help our communities come through.

8
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,867
We should be the ones thanking you.

9
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:25,663
Have you eaten?

10
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:29,167
We have so much food here.
You should go eat.

11
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,360
Doesn't matter how many people
say the word.

12
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,030
Nothing will change.

13
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,622
Miguel, no one's saying

14
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:11,000
any of this sadness
is going away just like that.

15
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:18,424
It's not anyone's fault
that it's the only thing they can say.

16
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,398
No, you don't.

17
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:50,248
Dad was disappointed in me when he died.

18
00:04:56,337 --> 00:05:00,174
- Miguel, don't say that.
- No, it's true.

19
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:47,096
Why is that?

20
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:57,523
In a way, Mom was right.

21
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:10,661
If Dad was still alive today,
I would tell him straight to his face.

22
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,893
Miguel, don't apologize.

23
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:36,104
You have nothing to apologize for.

24
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:42,068
What happened to your dad
was not your fault.

25
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,361
Why not?

26
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,782
I saw what was gonna happen to him
but I couldn't do anything.

27
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:50,118
I didn't do anything to stop it.

28
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:55,498
Miguel, it was a heart attack.
There was nothing you could do.

29
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:56,874
I don't know!

30
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:01,254
Why do I have to see it coming
if I can't do anything anyway?

31
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:06,676
That's why we need to know
what's really happening to us.

32
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:10,471
How?

33
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:13,224
I don't know.

34
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,009
they won't bring my Dad back.

35
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:51,053
That's not the goal, Miguel.

36
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,358
Let's face it when you're ready.

37
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,646
<i>- How are you?</i>
<i>- Yeah…</i>

38
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,356
Sorry for not replying.

39
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:53,110
Didn't I tell you not to say sorry
if you don't need to.

40
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:13,172
I'm happy that I made you feel… things.

41
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,552
Do you want to go out?

42
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:22,098
Out? You sure you can?

43
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,559
- Yes.
- Okay, then. Let's go.

44
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:29,230
Where do you want to go?
You good with Grapevine?

45
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:33,484
<i>But I'm not sure if it's already open.</i>
<i>I think it's still closed.</i>

46
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:43,119
- Good morning, ma'am.
- Hello.

47
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:50,251
Okay. Tell me why we're meeting here.
What's your plan?

48
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:54,338
You said you wanted to know more
about our abilities.

49
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,387
You think we can save someone here?

50
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,351
Try, how?

51
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:10,563
We randomly bump into patients?

52
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:12,314
To trigger the vision?

53
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,692
That might work.

54
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,736
That was a joke.

55
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,072
But how would we know?

56
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:31,041
Not sure it's right for us
to bump into sick people.

57
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,260
Who's your patient?

58
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,638
She's having a dizzy spell.

59
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:49,310
Yes, ma'am, I am dizzy.

60
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:50,769
Let's sit over here.

61
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,230
Sit down, ma'am.

62
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,441
How bad does it hurt?

63
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:01,238
Like a migraine. Times ten. Hurts!

64
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:04,366
- Hello, mother.
- Hey! Who are you?

65
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,285
Anything else you're feeling?

66
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:09,663
That migraine just went up to 20 times.

67
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,833
- Get well soon.
- Over here, ma'am.

68
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:15,794
How are you doing?

69
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,547
Do you have a history
of hypertension in your family?

70
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,093
- Hello, sir! Welcome.
- That hurts!

71
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:25,971
Why sir? Are you all right?

72
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:29,308
No, I'm not! You squeezed my broken hand!

73
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:34,021
- That hurts!
- Sorry, sir.

74
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,698
Let's go.

75
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,999
- Lower abdominal pain. BP 140/90.
- Let me help you.

76
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,209
Sir, sir.

77
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,677
Call the doctor.
The patient needs saturation.

78
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,055
I heard something. Did you see anything?

79
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:18,649
Patient, Tyrone Espina.
I think this is Pip-Tazo.

80
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,317
Did we order a skin test?

81
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:32,121
What are you doing?

82
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,289
I'll tell them.

83
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:38,127
What? That the patient will die today.
You think they can do something?

84
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:46,844
Miss, can you check his records, please?

85
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,596
What?

86
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:52,933
Pip-Tazo.
Double-check if he's allergic to that.

87
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,518
Are you a doctor here?

88
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,565
We look like idiots.

89
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:05,112
Hey! Look.

90
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,717
Wait, what? Second warning?
Shouldn't it be the first?

91
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:31,847
- Wish we could all ignore this like her.
- Yeah.

92
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:35,017
There's a problem with the app, right?

93
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,312
Then there's nothing to worry about!

94
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:43,150
I'd be worried if we were doing
something wrong, but we're not!

95
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,194
Whatever.

96
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,461
What're you doing here?

97
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:06,924
Tyrone?

98
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,976
It's too noisy!

99
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:19,311
You've met him once
during my birthday party.

100
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:23,482
So, how is he?

101
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:32,032
- Sure, sure! Get well to your cousin.
- Thank you, thank you.

102
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,427
Is that still the app?

103
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,470
What are we gonna do?

104
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:14,742
Then it turns out to be Poch's cousin!

105
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,078
Sure is!

106
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,955
Maybe this really is a sign!

107
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,417
Maybe this was given to us for a purpose.

108
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:32,217
Yeah. Shame we were a bit too late
in saving Dad.

109
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:36,013
Hey, Miguel.

110
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:43,645
We didn't know what this was
when that happened.

111
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,107
Hey, you did nothing wrong.

112
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:50,152
We did nothing wrong.

113
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:56,617
Also, having these abilities
doesn't make us gods.

114
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:08,754
Hey!

115
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,592
Are you two a thing?

116
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,933
What about you? Where'd you come from?

117
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,768
Dodging the question, girl?

118
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,773
The real question is, why are you late?
You're never late.

119
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:32,027
I came from the doctor.

120
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:36,657
Said I was dehydrated again. As usual.

121
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:41,829
Now, I'm going up
to drink a gallon of… water.

122
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:46,708
Service water's free at Grapevine.
Why don't you drink when…

123
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:52,339
Because booze is her water. Good job.

124
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:57,678
A drink is a drink is a drink. Right?

125
00:18:58,428 --> 00:18:59,888
Right.

126
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:05,477
Anyway. Are you going up?
Are leaving? Let's go up!

127
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,604
We'll… We'll follow!

128
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,356
Promise?

129
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,566
Promise.

130
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,944
Okay. Excuse me, ma'am, sir.

131
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:16,488
- See you.
- Time to work.

132
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:19,408
<i>Are you fucking insulting me?</i>
<i>Don't you know I'm a cop?</i>

133
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,493
<i>Sorry, sir.</i>

134
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,169
- Fuck! Why are you all so stupid?
- Sir, sorry.

135
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,670
You want to be scared?

136
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,054
Gigi!
