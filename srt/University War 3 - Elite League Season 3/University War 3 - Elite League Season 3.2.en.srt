1
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,781
Please check the stock of black coins.

2
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:34,117
None remains.

3
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,460
I'll see you later, then.

4
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:49,800
Black coins are all out.

5
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,552
Black coins are out?

6
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:55,389
So he had none left? That's a huge blow.

7
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:58,559
Until then, we were certain
we were ahead of STEM Division.

8
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:01,853
It was an unexpected turn of events.

9
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:04,565
Our division used multiple coins
to make the queries

10
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:06,984
but failed to bring in any profits.

11
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:11,280
DESPITE USING 5 GOLD COINS

12
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:13,198
None remains.

13
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:15,534
MEDICAL DIVISION FAILED TO BUY BLACK COINS

14
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,453
I was really flustered.

15
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:21,582
- We have one visit left to the Exchange.
- Should we get anything?

16
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:23,792
- What should we get?
- Something cheap?

17
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:27,754
We could also buy the coins
that will do well in Round 4 or 5.

18
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:30,757
Did STEM Division buy anything in Round 2?

19
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,803
- They did get something.
- Did they go to the Exchange?

20
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:35,887
Maybe I'm wrong.

21
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:40,017
30 MINUTES AGO

22
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,435
That's our plan for Round 1.

23
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,186
- We can fine-tune it later.
- Let's get in line.

24
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,396
I'll go first.

25
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,607
AS SOON AS ROUND 1 BEGAN,
MEDICAL DIVISION ASKED QUESTIONS

26
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,735
Medical Division just sent people
into the Inquiry Booth.

27
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,778
They probably have a similar plan.

28
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:55,365
- They're ahead of us.
- They'd be asking about Round 2.

29
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:56,283
Why don't we ask

30
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:59,703
about the coin with the biggest price gain
from Round 1 to 3?

31
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:00,996
TARGETS ROUND 3'S HIGHEST EARNING COIN

32
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:04,207
We knew Medical Division
would've thought of binary search.

33
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,335
Since they were using the same approach,

34
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:08,754
they could get ahead of us
and buy the coin we wanted.

35
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,922
Then, we would've wasted our queries.

36
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:12,341
From Round 1 to 3?

37
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:14,009
JUMPS AHEAD TO FIND
ROUND 3'S BEST PERFORMER

38
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,269
It's the black coin.

39
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:27,564
BLACK COIN HAS THE BIGGEST PRICE GAIN
FROM ROUND 1 TO 3

40
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:30,275
Black coins. Two teams get 8,
and the other gets 9.

41
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:33,487
I'd like to buy eight black coins.

42
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,280
Eight black coins, please.

43
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:36,865
Nine black coins, please.

44
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:39,951
8 COINS, 8 COINS, 9 COINS

45
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:42,663
Once they learn black coin
gains the most in Round 3,

46
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:43,872
they'll be so shaken.

47
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,290
Totally.

48
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:48,210
Losing all of black coins to them
is a huge blow.

49
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,336
For now...

50
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:53,131
I mean, Round 3 is important
because of the asset reveal.

51
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,342
It won't hurt to change our strategy.

52
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,802
STRATEGY REVISION REQUIRED

53
00:02:57,094 --> 00:03:01,306
We could check our coin's price
and sell them if it drops.

54
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,183
- The pink coins?
- The price may go up again.

55
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:10,148
I think he's eavesdropping over there.

56
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:11,817
Let's lower our voices.

57
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,569
He's going in
after listening in on our conversation.

58
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:16,530
We'll have to submit the query soon.

59
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:17,948
He heard everything.

60
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,408
KANG JI-HOO LIT A FIRE
UNDER MEDICAL DIVISION

61
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:23,036
EVER SINCE CHOI A-IN WALKED
OUT OF THE EXCHANGE

62
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,746
KANG JI-HOO HAS BEEN OBSERVING

63
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,957
As they say,
too many cooks spoil the broth.

64
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:31,169
Frankly, our strategy wouldn't change much
with or without me.

65
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:32,713
We already had our plan.

66
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:37,509
So I thought about what more I could do
to contribute to my division.

67
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,303
Are we sure
they bought anything in Round 1?

68
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:41,972
We don't know that.

69
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,932
We missed that completely.

70
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:47,602
We hadn't been keeping an eye
on what our opponents were doing.

71
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,147
We needed to know what they were doing

72
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,692
to hatch a plan to turn the tables on them
and secure a victory.

73
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,112
I think we need a scout to monitor them.

74
00:03:57,195 --> 00:04:00,407
That's a good idea.
That way, we can see their general plan.

75
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:04,286
KANG JI-HOO COUNTED
MEDICAL DIVISION'S VISITS TO THE EXCHANGE

76
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:08,415
I don't think
they're buying anything this round.

77
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:09,332
What?

78
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,959
Why aren't they buying, though?

79
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,044
Maybe I'm getting my hopes up too much,

80
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:16,381
but they might have failed to buy
the black coins.

81
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:19,384
They must've learned
all black coins were out.

82
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:22,387
I think that kind of messed up their game.

83
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:26,892
...close in one minute.

84
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,314
It's going up.

85
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,982
Up? The price is going up.

86
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,567
- Up?
- Let's hold on to them.

87
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,195
- The price will go up.
- Then, we should keep them.

88
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,780
DECIDED TO KEEP THE PINK COINS

89
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:43,241
I think we should redefine our goals
at this stage.

90
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:45,619
Why don't we talk it over
in the Division Room?

91
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:51,082
Our strategy so far has been figuring out

92
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:55,003
the coin with the biggest price gain
from this round to the next one

93
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,339
and purchase all of them.

94
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:00,258
But since our opponents
cleaned out the coin

95
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:02,719
that will do well in the next round...

96
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:05,472
Are we not using binary search anymore
to find the best performer?

97
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:09,893
We still need to find the best performer,
but we must consider Ji-hoo's motive.

98
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,813
We need to assume he was out there
because his division figured out

99
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,773
- the best performer in Round 4.
- Right.

100
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,734
I suggest we buy the coin
that will do well in Round 5.

101
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:20,904
Should we ask about the price gain
from Round 3 to 5

102
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,739
- considering our goal?
- Of course.

103
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:25,617
That's right.
Let's increase our assets in Round 5.

104
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,870
The problem is, we're not sure
how much STEM Division knows.

105
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,915
I bet Medical Division is floundering.

106
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:36,086
I mean, we're out here
already in position for the next round.

107
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,463
20 MINUTES AGO
Should we check the price gain...

108
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,924
- From Round 3 to 4?
- Yes, we should.

109
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,134
DECIDED TO BUY THE COIN
WITH THE BIGGEST PRICE GAIN IN ROUND 4

110
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,391
It's either silver or black.

111
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,892
- It's silver, then.
- Yes.

112
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:53,728
The moment Round 3 begins,
we'll sell our black coins...

113
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:56,273
- Right, then we'll buy silver coins.
- Oh, okay.

114
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,859
Round 2 ends in 5 minutes.

115
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,277
I'll go reserve our place.

116
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,154
STEM DIVISION PLANS TO BUY
ROUND 4'S BEST PERFORMING COIN

117
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:06,283
I think we're going to win
if our miners do well.

118
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,912
Our strategy
for the earlier rounds worked.

119
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:12,873
It's time to plan for the middle rounds.

120
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,041
We need to nail the final rounds to win.

121
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:19,462
A miner in Team SNU in STEM
requested a change of position.

122
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,132
- Want to try?
- Sure.

123
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,174
See you later.

124
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:25,677
We're selling black coins
and buying silver coins, okay?

125
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,429
- Get eight silver coins.
- Okay.

126
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,224
Did you handle multiplication?

127
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,518
We switched
because I kept making mistakes.

128
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,981
That concludes Round 2.

129
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:41,318
Coin prices in Round 3
will now be revealed.

130
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,987
STEM DIVISION OWNS 25 BLACK COINS

131
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,656
Black coin, 16,000 won.

132
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,912
- It increased so much.
- Wait, the black coins...

133
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:54,247
Pink coin, 14,000 won.

134
00:06:58,168 --> 00:06:59,461
I'd say it's legendary.

135
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:04,049
Fortunately, it looks like we did better.
Black coin had the highest spike.

136
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:07,218
- Pink coin had a 1,000-won gain.
- Black coin's price shot up.

137
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:09,346
Are we falling behind by 50,000 won?

138
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,263
ACCUMULATED RETURNS

139
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,724
MEDICAL DIVISION: 100,000 WON
STEM DIVISION: 150,000 WON

140
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:15,226
We should find out
which coin will rise in Round 5.

141
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,103
Should we do the binary search
for Round 5?

142
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:18,271
All right.

143
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:23,902
MEDICAL DIVISION WANTS TO SECURE
THE BEST PERFORMING COIN OF ROUND 5 FIRST

144
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,696
AS PLANNED, STEM DIVISION BUYS
THE BEST PERFORMING COIN OF ROUND 4

145
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,115
YOU CAN CHECK THE STOCK OF ONE COIN
BEFORE MAKING A PURCHASE

146
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,617
Do you have any pink coins left?

147
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,786
No, none remains.

148
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:35,830
I'll sell my coins first.
Here are eight black coins.

149
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:38,750
Here's 128,000 won.

150
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,586
And I'd like to buy nine silver coins.

151
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:45,256
Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min,
here are nine silver coins.

152
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,508
Thank you.

153
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,095
- They're still holding onto pink.
- Really?

154
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,846
- They are all out.
- They are?

155
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:57,352
STEM DIVISION OBTAINS PROFIT
FROM SELLING THEIR BLACK COINS

156
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,646
THEY THEN PURCHASED 8 SILVER COINS EACH

157
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:00,689
Thank you.

158
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:05,944
It bugs me that STEM Division
earned a lot with the black coin.

159
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,029
- How many did we get?
- Three.

160
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:10,991
That's not bad.
Maybe the miners will determine the game.

161
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:15,537
The amount
we're falling behind in investment

162
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,871
- is 50,000 won.
- Right.

163
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,873
We had 20,000 won at the outset,

164
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:22,460
so if our division can mine
one more gold coin than our opponents,

165
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:23,420
we're even.

166
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,130
Aren't our guys better at calculation?

167
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:29,092
Team Yonsei succeeded
in mining one gold coin.

168
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,344
You're so thorough.

169
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,388
How much have they earned so far?

170
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,558
Team POSTECH succeeded...

171
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:39,227
Team SKKU succeeded...

172
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:43,023
Team KAIST succeeded
in mining one gold coin.

173
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,651
- TEAM KAIST is on fire.
- Totally.

174
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,862
Our miners are catching up.

175
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:51,990
- They're checking the price gain, right?
- That's right.

176
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,075
- From Round 3 to 5, right?
- Yes.

177
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:57,787
MEDICAL DIVISION WANTS TO SECURE
ROUND 5'S BEST PERFORMING COIN

178
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:02,208
We shouldn't overlook the fact

179
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,794
that they made more profit
than we did in Round 4.

180
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,631
I asked, "Is the coin
with the biggest positive price gain

181
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,675
from Round 3 to 5
between black, pink, silver, and red?"

182
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:11,760
The answer was no.

183
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:13,470
THE BEST PERFORMER
ISN'T BLACK, PINK, SILVER, OR RED

184
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,765
We can cross them out.
We should ask about the remaining ones.

185
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:19,267
- About the three remaining ones?
- Yes.

186
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,728
IS THE COIN
WITH THE BIGGEST POSITIVE PRICE GAIN

187
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,980
FROM ROUND 3 TO 5 BETWEEN GREEN AND BLUE?

188
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,900
The answer's no.

189
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,234
You got no?

190
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:31,362
- If the answer is no...
- I got a no.

191
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:33,615
Only the purple coin remains.

192
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:37,202
But there's a chance
the gain is a negative number.

193
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:38,369
EVEN PURPLE COIN'S PRICE MAY GO DOWN

194
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,080
Are we getting a bear market?

195
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:42,999
Maybe the market's going to crash.

196
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,711
Let's include another coin in the query
and ask if the gain exceeds zero.

197
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:48,004
Let's ask right away.

198
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:51,716
IF IT EXCEEDS 0, THE PRICE GOES UP
IF IT DOESN'T, THE PRICE GOES DOWN

199
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,886
If it exceeds zero, let's buy them all
and sell our pink coins.

200
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:02,685
Can you wait by the Exchange?

201
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,230
- I'm feeling anxious.
- Okay.

202
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,315
Let's go line up by the Exchange.

203
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,949
Team SNU in STEM succeeded
in mining one gold coin.

204
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,284
I think purple gets negative growth.

205
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:21,037
I asked if purple or green has
a positive price gain from Round 3 to 5,

206
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:24,833
- and the answer was no.
- Round 5 is a bear market.

207
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:30,338
- Are they buying now?
- They're not doing anything.

208
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:34,384
It looks like they believe
pink coin's price will go up, doesn't it?

209
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,886
We'll sell pink coins in Round 4.

210
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,681
- We must.
- In Round 4, we shouldn't have anything.

211
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,851
- In Round 4, everything should be...
- We should cash in.

212
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,310
Because it's a bear market.

213
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:45,353
LIQUIDATION PLANNED

214
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:48,314
That concludes Round 3 of Mine and Trade.

215
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:52,443
Bear in mind that they may have a lead
from acquiring all black coins.

216
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:55,989
Each division's total assets
will now be revealed.

217
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,907
- I'm getting nervous.
- Shall we use the big screen?

218
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,702
The big screen sounds nice.

219
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,204
Please...

220
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,086
Medical Division has 790,000 won.

221
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,379
STEM Division

222
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:16,217
has 740,000 won.

223
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,303
- ...has 740,000 won.
- What?

224
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,764
MEDICAL DIVISION: 790,000 WON
STEM DIVISION: 740,000 WON

225
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,351
Did they sell the black coins

226
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:28,271
- and make a bad investment?
- Maybe they lost some money that way.

227
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,898
Maybe our miners did better.

228
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:32,859
I don't get why we're falling behind.

229
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,778
STEM Division has 740,000 won.

230
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:36,863
MINING ROOM

231
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:38,156
Did you hear that?

232
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:41,117
- How big is the difference?
- It's 50,000 won.

233
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,161
- We're behind by 50,000 won?
- Yeah.

234
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,663
Let's crank up the mining efforts.

235
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,832
The difference is 50,000 won.

236
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:53,963
Good job, guys.

237
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,049
TEAM SNU IN STEM: 14
TEAM KAIST: 11, TEAM POSTECH: 15

238
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,342
STEM DIVISION'S TOTAL: 40 COINS

239
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,764
Why is the difference so small?

240
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,017
- How are you holding up?
- I'm doing fine.

241
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,769
I misread the number. That's all.

242
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,815
Do you want to switch? Are you okay?

243
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,567
- I'm good.
- Okay.

244
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,611
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE: 20
TEAM YONSEI: 20, TEAM SKKU: 16

245
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:17,946
MEDICAL DIVISION'S TOTAL: 53 COINS

246
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,783
MEDICAL DIVISION MINED 13 MORE COINS

247
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,451
CURRENT 1ST PLACE IN MINING

248
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:26,537
FRONT-RUNNERS: TEAM SKKU, KANG JI-HU
AND TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE, JOO MIN-SEO

249
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:30,208
OVERALL 1ST PLACE: JOO MIN-SEO, 13 COINS

250
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,253
10-DIGIT-BY-10-DIGIT MULTIPLICATION

251
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:36,047
A TOTAL OF 13 QUESTIONS SOLVED,
EACH TAKING 5.7 MINUTES

252
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,800
Working with the 10-digit numbers
was a complex process,

253
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,678
so I tried my best
not to make a mistake along the way.

254
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,222
I was also surprised
that I made no mistakes.

255
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:47,642
I couldn't be sure if I was slow
or Min-seo was insanely quick.

256
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,478
Turns out she was that quick.

257
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:53,231
OVERALL 2ND PLACE: KANG JI-HU, 12 COINS

258
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:56,442
Coin prices in Round 4
will now be revealed.

259
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:59,779
STEM DIVISION HOLDS SILVER COINS
MEDICAL DIVISION HOLDS PINK COINS

260
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,030
We gained 1,000 won.

261
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,701
- It's still a gain.
- Baby steps, right?

262
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:09,914
Let's keep the door open
to monitor the trading activities.

263
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:12,667
I'll go make our trade.

264
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,669
Let's go sell the silver coins.

265
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:17,463
I'll ask about the pink coin's stock.

266
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:24,178
KIM GANG-HYEON AND JAE SEUNG-GYU
LINE UP BY THE EXCHANGE

267
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,727
Two STEM teams lined up to make a trade.

268
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,396
They must know
all the prices are going to drop.

269
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,772
I doubt they'll buy anything.

270
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,649
- The answer was no.
- What?

271
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,776
We're getting a bear market.

272
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,279
- A bear market?
- Neither red nor silver will see profit.

273
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,780
Shall we cash in and wait?

274
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:44,532
- Let's sell everything.
- Okay.

275
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:45,616
LIQUIDATION DECIDED

276
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,077
I'd like to check the pink coin's stock.

277
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,412
None remains.

278
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:51,956
I'd like to sell nine silver coins.

279
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,917
- He has no pink coins.
- That means

280
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,919
it's safe to say we're in the lead, right?

281
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,671
We had a 3,000-won price gain.

282
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:02,091
When we cash in all 25 silver coins,
our profit totals 75,000 won.

283
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,801
MEDICAL DIVISION: 790,000 WON
PINK COIN'S PROFIT: 25,000 WON

284
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:05,470
STEM DIVISION: 740,000 WON
SILVER COIN'S PROFIT: 75,000 WON

285
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:08,973
STEM DIVISION CAUGHT UP
ON MEDICAL DIVISION WITH EARNINGS

286
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:12,769
STEM DIVISION LIQUIDATED ALL THEIR ASSETS
I'd like to sell eight silver coins.

287
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,979
Team SNU in Medicine succeeded in mining.

288
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:17,315
Team Yonsei succeeded in mining.

289
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:20,193
It looks like
we're falling behind in mining.

290
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,493
Team SNU in Medicine succeeded in mining.

291
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,453
COIN MINING SUCCEEDED

292
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:34,665
Team SNU in Medicine's miner
requested a change of position.

293
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,503
I'll get going. I think I'm done.

294
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:41,839
Team POSTECH's miner
requested a change of position.

295
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:44,425
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE'S HAN SEO-YEON
AND TEAM POSTECH'S PARK SEO-YEON GO IN

296
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,637
- How's it going?
- What?

297
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,848
- Our returns are higher.
- Really?

298
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,309
So the mining is the issue.

299
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,103
I'll try to speed it up.

300
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,438
MEDICAL DIVISION ALSO PREPARES
FOR THE BEAR MARKET

301
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:59,273
I'd like to sell eight pink coins.

302
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,235
I'd like to check
the stock of silver coins.

303
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,362
- Silver, please.
- I'll check them.

304
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,697
I have 25 coins in stock.

305
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:09,200
I'd like to sell all my pink coins.

306
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:13,079
The Exchange and Inquiry Booth
close in five minutes.

307
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,917
We're asking about the price gain
from Round 5 to 6.

308
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,669
- All 25 silver coins are in stock.
- I see.

309
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,546
But Ji-min just entered the Exchange.

310
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,172
- He did?
- Yes, just now.

311
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:24,424
Team KAIST's buying.

312
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,759
1 MINUTE AGO

313
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,719
RAN INTO TEAM KAIST'S JEON JI-MIN
ON HIS WAY OUT

314
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:32,932
Maybe he's checking the stock.
Both sides cashed in on all their assets.

315
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:36,060
That means they knew
about the bear market too.

316
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,062
Please check the pink coin's stock.

317
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:39,313
- The pink coins?
- Yes.

318
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,691
- I have 18 coins.
- Eighteen?

319
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,776
18 PINK COINS IN STOCK
Thank you.

320
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,155
- He has 18 coins.
- The pink ones?

321
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:48,656
- What an awkward number.
- It is.

322
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:51,409
- Maybe one team didn't sell theirs?
- There are 18 pink coins.

323
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:54,996
- All this is just...
- Do we have any pink coins?

324
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,707
- No, we've got nothing.
- They kept seven coins?

325
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,251
I'd like to sell all my pink coins.

326
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:03,171
I want to sell these eight pink coins.

327
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:06,007
I have these pink coins...

328
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:11,596
I'd like to sell just one coin for now.

329
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:15,516
- Hey, Min-seo.
- My mind is whirling.

330
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,103
Go to the Exchange
and sell all pink coins we've got.

331
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:21,606
- All our pink coins?
- Yes, all of them.

332
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,400
I thought STEM Division
would also check the stock.

333
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:28,404
So I only sold one pink coin initially
to confuse them.

334
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,703
- I don't get their plan.
- Their strategy must be different.

335
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:39,499
MEDICAL DIVISION IS ON THE HUNT
FOR ROUND 6'S BEST PERFORMER

336
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:40,750
From Round 5 to 6.

337
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:45,588
MEDICAL DIVISION FOUND OUT
ROUND 6'S HIGHEST-EARNING COIN

338
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,966
The Exchange and Inquiry Booth
close in one minute.

339
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:52,470
We've got to hit the Exchange
the moment Round 5 begins.

340
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,222
STEM guys are probably going to--

341
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:56,015
- Ask the same questions we did?
- Yeah.

342
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,683
So we should be ready
the moment Round 4 ends.

343
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:59,560
Should I stay in line?

344
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,063
- We should wait in line here.
- Yes, it's necessary.

345
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:05,191
I'm sure they're going to ask
about the price gain from Round 5 to 6.

346
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,901
So let's wait in line

347
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,612
and enter the Exchange
the moment they say Round 5 is live.

348
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:14,116
TEAM POSTECH'S JAE SEUNG-GYU
GOES INTO THE INQUIRY BOOTH

349
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:19,080
STEM DIVISION IS INDEED LOOKING
FOR ROUND 6'S BEST PERFORMING COIN

350
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:21,874
It's the pink coin.

351
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,751
What a relief.

352
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:29,340
That concludes Round 4 of Mine and Trade.

353
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,969
Coin prices in Round 5
will now be revealed.

354
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,974
LEE SEUNG-HYEON SIGNALS HIS ALLIES

355
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,600
Can we get in line already?

356
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:41,227
MEDICAL DIVISION LINES UP
THE MOMENT ROUND 5 BEGINS

357
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,270
Can we get in line?

358
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:43,604
...8,000 won.

359
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:46,148
- Shouldn't we get in line as well?
- I know. They beat us to it.

360
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:47,441
STEM DIVISION MISSED THEIR CHANCE

361
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:51,862
Coin prices in Round 5
will now be revealed.

362
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:57,159
COIN PRICES IN ROUND 5

363
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,997
It's the Great Depression, man.

364
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,457
- Dang.
- Pink coin, 9,000 won.

365
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,918
Purple coin, 10,000 won.

366
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,588
Guys.

367
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,592
Suppose we can't buy pink coins.
What's our plan?

368
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:14,218
Then, we're in trouble.

369
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,470
It looks like
Medical guys are trying to buy it.

370
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,266
- Do I just leave if pink coins are out?
- Yes, do that.

371
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:24,186
Shouldn't we prepare for Round 10
and start building our portfolio?

372
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,857
Considering Round 10, we should buy coins
when the prices are ultra-low.

373
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,735
Don't you think it's about time
we purchased blue coins?

374
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:34,864
- It wouldn't hurt even if we went all-in.
- "All-in?"

375
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,949
Has any other coin
dropped below 6,000 won?

376
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:38,951
- I don't think so.
- It's the lowest.

377
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:41,287
Should we just empty our pockets?

378
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,873
- Let's buy the cheap ones.
- We'll still have some funds left.

379
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,709
We'll be in trouble
if Medical Division buys everything.

380
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,002
Shall we wait in line?

381
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,962
- Yes, let's wait in line.
- Okay.

382
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,843
Why don't we find out

383
00:18:55,926 --> 00:19:00,890
which coin will see profit
between this round and Round 9?

384
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,475
Good idea. We can hold on to it.

385
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:05,394
We might not be able to buy it
if we're too late.

386
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,396
We have enough funds anyway.

387
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,273
Blue or red coins are pretty cheap.

388
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:12,943
Let's ask if the sum of their prices
goes up in Round 9.

389
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:15,404
STEM DIVISION WANTS TO BUY
BLUE AND RED COINS WHEN THEY'RE CHEAP

390
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:18,115
DOES THE SUM OF THE PRICE GAIN
OF BLUE AND RED COINS

391
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:19,700
FROM ROUND 5 TO ROUND 9 EXCEED ZERO?

392
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,245
Hey, he's back. What did you get?

393
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,538
The sum exceeds zero.

394
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:26,332
- Shall we buy them?
- Let's do it.

395
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,668
We can buy both blue and red coins...

396
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:30,878
Let's buy them now.

397
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:41,681
KIM DONG-GEON LOOKS TIRED

398
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,350
Go take some rest.

399
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:50,439
Team SNU in STEM's miner
requested a change of position.

400
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:54,527
I'll handle it.

401
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,618
I'd like to check the pink coin's stock.

402
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,245
CHECKING THE STOCK
OF ROUND 6'S BEST PERFORMING COIN

403
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:13,003
I have 25 pink coins.

404
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:15,715
MEDICAL DIVISION DIDN'T BUY PINK COINS

405
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:17,717
I'd like eight pink coins.

406
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:23,222
He had all 25 pink coins,
so I bought 8 pieces.

407
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:26,142
You can buy nine pieces.
The others can get a mix of blue and red.

408
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,435
Great.

409
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:30,479
I'd like to buy eight pink coins.

410
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,356
Nine pink coins, please.

411
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:37,194
- Thank goodness pink coins were in stock.
- Are we also buying the blue and the red?

412
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:39,697
Yes, I told them to buy
five of each color.

413
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,700
I still can't believe
pink coins were in stock.

414
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:46,537
It's satisfying and confusing
at the same time, isn't it?

415
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,956
- What did they buy, then?
- I wonder that too.

416
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,877
I'd like to buy 5 blue coins
and 5 red coins.

417
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,839
I have five blue coins,
but red coins are not in stock.

418
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,258
NO RED COIN REMAINS

419
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:03,179
I'd like to buy eight red coins.

420
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,638
Eight red coins, please.

421
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,141
I'll take all the remaining red coins.

422
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:08,893
MEDICAL DIVISION: RED
STEM DIVISION: PINK

423
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:13,898
FROM ROUND 5 TO 6,
BOTH COINS GET A 3,000-WON INCREASE

424
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:17,318
- Red is out, but blue is in full stock.
- Really?

425
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:20,613
All we have is how the sum will change,
so it's hard to decide.

426
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:21,864
- Red coins are out.
- Really?

427
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:22,948
I couldn't get any.

428
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:25,618
- What were you told to buy?
- Red and blue, five each.

429
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,078
- Should I get blue only?
- Yes, get ten.

430
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:35,795
I think the STEM guys got in line
to buy the cheaper coins.

431
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:37,922
The bear market slashed the prices.

432
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:41,258
So I suggest we buy silver coins.

433
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:43,719
Let's split it three ways.
We'll claim it first.

434
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,514
- I wonder what they're after.
- Let's analyze them--

435
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:48,557
- We can ask them directly.
- We can.

436
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:49,934
They can just refuse to tell us.

437
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:52,561
Excuse me.

438
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:55,064
Can you tell us what you're buying?

439
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:58,567
- A coin in one of the ROYGBIV.
- One of the ROYGBIV?

440
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,194
- That was clever.
- Just kidding.

441
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,613
- So?
- He wants one of the rainbow colors.

442
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,114
He said ROYGBIV.

443
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:05,950
And he's going for one of them?

444
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,661
- It's a technically true statement.
- Diversification is wise.

445
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,788
Scale trading, right?

446
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:13,666
MEDICAL DIVISION TRIES TO BUY CHEAP COINS

447
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,584
Can I check the blue coin's stock?

448
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,920
I have two blue coins in stock.

449
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:18,963
Two?

450
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:24,134
I'd like to buy 2 blue coins
and 8 silver coins.

451
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,846
How many silver coins remain?

452
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:28,472
I have 17 in stock.

453
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,766
I'll take eight pieces.

454
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,186
HE SEEMS TO BE SHORT ON FUNDS

455
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:39,650
Can I take that back?
I don't think I have enough cash.

456
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,486
I'll take five instead.

457
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:46,073
Why don't we check the blue coin's price?

458
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,825
We can ask if it will drop again.

459
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,661
But the queries cost too much.

460
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:51,579
That's true.

461
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:54,415
But it can't drop further
in the next round.

462
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,208
I won't say I'm not anxious,

463
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:59,003
but we got the blue coin
at an incredibly low price.

464
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,630
I think we should hold on to it
no matter what.

465
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:03,841
Even if the price drops,
we still bought it at 6,000 won.

466
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,510
We used the surplus funds
for that investment.

467
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:09,221
That concludes Round 5.

468
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:12,808
Coin prices in Round 6
will now be revealed.

469
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:19,356
COIN PRICES IN ROUND 6

470
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:21,525
That shot up.

471
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,360
Blue went up too.

472
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:25,654
Let's ask about Rounds 6 and 7.

473
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:29,783
- Let's form a single file.
- Let's wait in the order of arrival.

474
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:32,411
Quick, join the line.

475
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:34,663
Where's this inquisitiveness coming from?

476
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:35,581
What happened?

477
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,708
They must be bubbling with questions.

478
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:41,128
RIGHT AFTER ROUND 6 BEGAN

479
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:43,589
Guys, we have to get moving.

480
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:45,883
MEDICAL DIVISION HEADED
TO THE INQUIRY BOOTH

481
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:49,428
Guys, let's bag everything
for Rounds 6 to 8.

482
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:52,264
Let's ask about the trends
of Round 6 to 7 and Round 7 to 8.

483
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:54,642
The six of us can finish things right now.

484
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:57,895
To stay ahead of STEM Division,
our goal shouldn't be winning one round

485
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:00,940
but sweeping the highest earners
in the next two rounds.

486
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:04,026
THEIR STRATEGY IS TO FIND OUT
THE TOP EARNERS OF ROUNDS 7 AND 8

487
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:07,029
FIRST, THEY FOUND OUT THE COIN
WITH THE HIGHEST PRICE GAIN IN ROUND 7

488
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:08,697
It's pink, all right.

489
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:11,158
Pink? You want us to buy pink coins?

490
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:13,702
Please check the pink coin's stock.

491
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:17,873
I have six pink coins in stock.

492
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:19,708
6 PINK COINS REMAIN

493
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:25,506
I'd like to sell
silver coins and red coins.

494
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:29,718
I'd like to buy 2 pink coins
and 8 blue coins.

495
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:32,179
- I don't have any blue coins in stock.
- Okay.

496
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:34,431
0 BLUE COIN REMAINS

497
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:36,433
How many does he have?

498
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:38,185
- He had only six pink coins.
- What?

499
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:39,603
So I bought two.

500
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:43,190
I ordered eight blue coins as well,
just to check on the stock,

501
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:44,817
but he didn't have them either.

502
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,318
Go ahead and get pink coins.

503
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,153
- And--
- What should I sell?

504
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:50,864
Everything you've got
except the blue coins.

505
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:54,326
I'd like to sell 5 silver coins
and 8 red coins.

506
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:58,205
I'd like three pink coins.

507
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:01,458
I'd like to buy three pink coins.

508
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,044
I gave it some thought,

509
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:06,839
and there's something
we can't lose sight of.

510
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,425
We couldn't buy the pink coins
because most of the stock was gone.

511
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,468
That means our opponents have the rest.

512
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:15,848
They will benefit from holding on to them,
depriving us of our profit for one round.

513
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:19,476
MEDICAL DIVISION OWNS 8 PINK COINS
WHERE ARE THE REMAINING 17?

514
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,895
Can we go to the Exchange
at the last minute

515
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:24,148
to prevent them
from buying the pink coins?

516
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,399
5 MINUTES AGO

517
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:26,483
I like the idea.

518
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:28,444
THEIR STRATEGY IS TO SELL
AT THE LAST MINUTE

519
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,529
TO PREVENT MEDICAL DIVISION
FROM BUYING THE PINK COIN

520
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:33,699
The Exchange and Inquiry Booth
close in two minutes.

521
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,701
STEM DIVISION GOES TO THE EXCHANGE
LATER THAN MEDICAL DIVISION

522
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:38,245
Please check the pink coin's stock.

523
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:39,955
I have six pink coins in stock.

524
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:43,959
I'd like to buy 2 pink coins
and 8 blue coins.

525
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:46,962
I'd like three pink coins.

526
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:49,590
I'd like to sell
all the pink coins I have.

527
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,633
I'm selling all my pink coins.

528
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,469
I'd like to sell all my pink coins.

529
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:56,305
AT THE MOMENT,
20 PINK COINS REMAIN IN STOCK

530
00:25:56,597 --> 00:25:58,515
SKIPS STOCK CHECK
I'd like to sell

531
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:01,226
eight red coins.

532
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:04,313
I'd like to buy three pink coins.

533
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,900
How much will we lose, then?

534
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:08,817
I think...

535
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:11,779
It feels like an inflection point for us.

536
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:15,824
That concludes Round 6 of Mine and Trade.

537
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:18,786
Coin prices in Round 7
will now be revealed.

538
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:22,331
COIN PRICES IN ROUND 7

539
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:25,250
- Which coins do we own now?
- Blue coins.

540
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:28,212
- How many have we got?
- Twenty in total.

541
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,672
- Its price went down.
- That's right.

542
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:33,342
Maybe our idea to hold on to it is doomed.

543
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:37,179
We have to go.
We can talk it out over there.

544
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:39,098
MEDICAL DIVISION ON THE MOVE
AS THE NEW ROUND BEGINS

545
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:42,893
I'll take nine purple coins, please.

546
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:46,188
STEM Division is staying holed up there.

547
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,690
Maybe they already bought purple coins.

548
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:50,109
Guys.

549
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:52,444
He had 25 coins, so I bought 9.
Go buy 8 coins each.

550
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:54,279
Why aren't they buying anything?

551
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:56,615
First things first. Go get our coins.

552
00:26:58,075 --> 00:26:59,535
I can't guess what they're thinking.

553
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:02,329
I know. It's impossible to tell
what they have.

554
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:07,167
I think Medical Division
is way ahead of us.

555
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:10,212
Why don't we find out
the best coin in Round 9?

556
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,464
It looks like
they had all their queries answered.

557
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:14,341
Why don't we check the price gain
from Round 8 to 9?

558
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:15,467
I agree.

559
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:19,930
SKIPS ROUND 8'S BEST PERFORMER
TO FIND OUT ROUND 9'S HIGHEST EARNER

560

MEDICAL DIVISION USES
THE INQUIRY BOOTH NEXT

561
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:27,938
MEDICAL DIVISION IS ALSO LOOKING
FOR ROUND 9'S BEST PERFORMER

562
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:34,903
Is it silver or black?

563
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,115
Pink, then? It's got to be pink.

564
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:41,076
Okay, let's go all-in on pink coins.

565
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,705
Pink has a higher gain.

566
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:47,207
- That's the best performer of Round 9?
- I'll go check its price.

567
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:50,752
That concludes Round 7 of Mine and Trade.

568
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:54,798
Each division's total assets
will now be revealed.

569
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:58,427
Let's all pray.

570
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:00,637
Come on now.

571
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:05,809
Medical Division

572
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:08,437
has 1,542,000 won.

573
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:10,189
STEM Division

574
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:12,941
has 1,436,000 won.

575
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:15,819
MEDICAL DIVISION HAS A LEAD
OF APPROXIMATELY 100,000 WON

576
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:16,737
Thank goodness.

577
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,405
We have a 100,000-won lead!

578
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,741
- At this point,
- A whopping 100,000-won gap!

579
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,868
there's no way they can make a comeback.

580
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:25,954
...has 1,436,000 won.

581
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:26,914
We're winning.

582
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,210
What a relief.

583
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,171
Take it in.

584
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,264
The margin isn't so small.

585
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,975
Ten mining can cover that.

586
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,268
That's a piece of cake.

587
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:51,313
Coin prices in Round 8
will now be revealed.

588
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:55,400
Come on.
Let's see if their alliance crumbles.

589
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:57,152
- Open slightly.
- Check the vibe.

590
00:28:58,195 --> 00:28:59,696
Blue coin, 6,000 won.

591
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,657
BLUE COIN'S PRICE IS IMMOVABLE
Silver coin, 12,000 won.

592
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,451
Purple coin, 18,000 won.

593
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,787
Purple's price skyrocketed.

594
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,830
- Wow, purple is crazy.
- It shot up.

595
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,040
That's a 4,000-won increase.

596
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:12,584
Blue still remains at 6,000 won?

597
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:15,212
It's such a shame
we couldn't buy red coins.

598
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:16,922
- Did red go up a lot?
- Yes.

599
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,633
I regret that we didn't pay
attention to purple.

600
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:25,389
Team SNU in STEM's miner
requested a change of position.

601
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,933
- I'll go.
- No, it's better if I go.

602
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,269
I tried mining, so I know some tricks.

603
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:31,353
Oh, yeah?

604
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:33,188
Good luck.

605
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:36,858
Round 8 of Mine and Trade begins now.

606
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:38,277
Shall we get the coins?

607

STEM DIVISION ON THE MOVE
TO BUY PINK COINS

608
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:40,696
Are you going to...

609
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,991
Are we going to make a purchase?

610
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:45,117
Sure, we need pink coins.

611
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,202
MEDICAL DIVISION ALSO MOVES OUT
TO BUY PINK COINS

612
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:48,996
Let's hurry and get in line.

613
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:51,498
- Are you going to the Exchange?
- Yes.

614
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:53,250
Hey, they beat us to it.

615
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,668
TEAM KAIST'S JEON JI-MIN
ENTERS THE EXCHANGE FIRST

616
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:58,463
TEAM SNU IN STEM GOT DELAYED
FROM THE MINER EXCHANGE

617
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:02,467
We should've gotten here earlier.
This doesn't look good.

618
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:04,594
20 PINK COINS REMAIN
I'd like 7 pink coins.

619
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:06,346

622
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:11,393
ALL PINK COINS ARE OUT

623
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,061
That's 24,000 won.

624
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:16,189
I'd like to buy 4 black coins
and 6 pink coins.

625
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:18,233
I don't have pink coins in stock.

626
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:20,610
Here are your four black coins.

627
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:21,903
FAILED TO GET PINK COINS

628
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:24,906
- Pink coins are all out.
- They're out?

629
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,034
Can we buy green and silver?

630
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:29,286
We need to close the gap,
so let's buy them.

631
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,246
I'll go get 3 green and 3 silver.

632
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:34,541
- More investment is our only lifeline.
- We're out of options.

633
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:37,711
I'd like to buy 3 green coins
and 3 silver coins.

635
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:43,175
No matter what happens,
their only hope is the blue coin.

636
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:45,969
They can only hope
for blue's price to spike.

637
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:52,184
How much cash do you guys have?

638
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:56,271
We have 14,000 won.

639
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:58,357
No, we've got 19,000 won.

640
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,816
Right, we have 19,000 won.

641
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:02,444
We have 21,000 won.

642
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:04,946
That's 30,000 won...

643
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,282
In total, we have 46,000 won.

644
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:08,950
- You've got 46,000 won?
- Yes.

645
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:18,085
That concludes Round 8 of Mine and Trade.

Blue coin, 5,000 won.

649
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:25,509
Blue's price dropped.

650
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:27,219
Dang, blue went down further!

651
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:29,888
We're so screwed.

652
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:32,432
- How come?
- We have heaps of blue coins.

653
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:33,892
How much is it?

654
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,061
It just dropped to 5,000 won.

655
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:41,316
Round 9 of Mine and Trade begins now.

656
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:47,114
Since our miners have secured
twice as many gold coins as theirs,

657
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:50,450
- I know.
- we don't need to take risks.

663
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:06,383
Team Yonsei succeeded in mining.

664
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:10,011

667
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:20,522
We need to stop them
from earning a whole lot.

668
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,858
We can lump either blue or pink

669
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,652
with green, silver, and black,
and check if their sum increases.

670
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:28,780
If the answer is yes, we hold on to them.
If not, we cash in.

671
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,200
In that case, let's go with pink.

672
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:35,078
- I'll use pink instead of blue.
- Okay.

673
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:37,831
- Just a minute.
- Should we even ask?

674
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,875
- It's the last round.
- It's a waste of money.

675
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:43,336
We now have to accept
that our division is going to lose.

676
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:46,298
Our miners are falling behind too.

677
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:47,674
Right? What should we do?

678
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:51,303
I may have counted wrong,
but I'm sure we beat Team KAIST.

679
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,597
- We mined at least ten more coins,
- Really?

680
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,016
- so we definitely beat them.
- That's the gap?

681
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:59,769
But I'm not sure about Team POSTECH.
The difference may be 4 or 5.

682
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:02,063
Things weren't looking so good.

683
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:07,235
Our division purchased blue coin,
but its price continued to drop.

684
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:08,945
It was no longer
about beating Medical Division

685
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:13,867
but narrowing down the gap
between the other two STEM teams and us.

686
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,703
Our next goal is
to eliminate any possible variables.

687
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:19,706
We should match whatever asset we have
with Team POSTECH's.

688
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:20,790
- That's the best.
- Right.

689
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:22,083
Team KAIST's already in the ditch.

690
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:27,047
If the three STEM teams had
an almost identical portfolio,

691
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,341
that would remove
any surprise factor from investments,

692
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:32,552
allowing us to reframe the game
into a mining match.

693
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,223
We need you to stay focused.

694
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:39,768
Prioritizing our survival
would be for the best, right?

695
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:43,480
Look, they're acting separately too.

696
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:46,441
- I have a question.
- Okay.

697
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:49,778
Suppose we lost to the Medical Division.

698
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:52,239
- Among the three STEM teams...
- Our rank?

699
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:54,157
I can't be sure.

700
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:55,784
Is the difference small?

701
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:59,120
Yes, because all three teams invested
under the same strategy.

702
00:34:00,497 --> 00:34:04,000
I think we should start considering

703
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:07,212
whether we can outperform
the other STEM teams.

704
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:10,632
When I checked the assets,
we had slightly more than the others.

705
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:13,927
- We have 480,000 won.
- How much did our division have in total?

706
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:14,886
About 1,430,000 won.

707
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:17,264
Multiply what we have by 3,
and you get 144.

708
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:19,391
- So at least one team has fewer than us.
- You're right.

709
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:22,519
The winner will be
the team with the best miners.

710
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,437
The STEM team that survives

711
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:27,440
will be the one with miners
that secure the most coins.

712
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:29,818
Another possible scenario
is blue skyrocketing.

713
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,653
- Blue may skyrocket.
- We have ten blue coins.

714
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:35,448
With a 5,000-won spike,
we'll get 25,000 won more than the others.

715
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:37,117
That's a huge margin.

716
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:41,037
Is the main difference
between us and Team POSTECH

717
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:43,290
- the five blue coins?
- Pink as well.

718
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:44,457
- Pink?
- They have five more.

719
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:46,418
But we have more cash.

720
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,336
- We do?
- Yes.

721
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:51,881
MINERS' PERFORMANCE WILL DECIDE
THE TWO TEAMS IN THE DEATHMATCH

722
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:00,432
This is killing me. I'm tired.

723
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,392
I'm starting to feel drained too.

724
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:04,185
No, I can still do this.

725
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:05,812
Let's focus on our tasks.

726
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:10,191
I think we'll get a good final score
thanks to you.

727
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:12,277
You'll probably get us a big win.

728
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:15,363
- What's the verdict?
- Negative.

729
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:16,615
These three don't exceed zero.

730
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,700
- Do we sell everything?
- We have to.

731
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:21,745
Let's cash in pink,
black, silver, and green coins.

732
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,663
Leave only the blue coins.

733
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:26,124
We're staking our lives on blue, right?

734
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:27,834
- Please.
- Please!

735
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:29,669
May it skyrocket.

736
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:31,880
Come here, Jong-yun.

737
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:36,134
Should we buy blue coins
if any are in stock?

738
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:38,720
- It's better to match with Team POSTECH.
- Agreed.

739
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,263
- Do I buy it if there is any?
- Yes.

740
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:41,806
- We must close in on them.
- Right.

741
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:45,018
Could you check the blue coin's stock?

742
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:47,604
I don't have any blue coins in stock.

743
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:50,899
I'd like to sell
4 black, 2 pink, 3 silver,

744
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,026
and 3 green coins.

745
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:58,990
Team SKKU succeeded in mining.

746
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:00,450
Another gold coin?

747
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,786
Has any of your teammates stayed
in the Mining Room all this time?

748
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,621
- Yes.
- Anyone mining five hours straight?

749
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:07,040
I'm so grateful to him.

750
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:08,667
He moves me to tears.

751
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,544
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE'S KIM MIN-SEOK
HASN'T ASKED FOR A POSITION CHANGE

752
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:18,927
DURING THE 4-HOUR GAME TIME,
HE SINGLE-HANDEDLY MINED 29 GOLD COINS

753
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:23,306
- I think we should stay on until the end.
- Okay.

754
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:27,018
NEITHER MINERS OF TEAM SKKU

755
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:29,896
ASKED TO BE RELIEVED OF THEIR DUTIES

756
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:34,025
TEAM SKKU'S KIM DONG-YEON
MINED 21 COINS DURING 4 HOURS

757
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:37,070
TEAM SKKU'S KANG JI-HU
MINED 36 COINS DURING 4 HOURS

758
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:38,154
OVERALL 1ST PLACE

759
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:41,324
A position swap

760
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:43,660
would've required information exchange,
possibly wasting our time

761
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,370
and messing up our tempo.

762
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,372
I had a small pain in my back,

763
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,791
but that eased up
when I shifted my position.

764
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,127
So I decided to stay on until the end.

765
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:56,423
SELLING EVERYTHING EXCEPT BLUE
Here are 3 silver coins and 7 pink coins.

766
00:36:56,506 --> 00:37:00,135
I'd like to sell 7 pink coins
and 3 green coins.

767
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:03,722
- How's it going for us?
- What?

768
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:06,516
First off, we sold everything
that generated any value.

769
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:10,019
Realistically speaking,
I don't think STEM Division can win.

770
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:12,021
- What?
- We won't be able to win.

771
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:13,231
- It's unlikely?
- Yes.

772
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:19,070
The only difference between the teams is
that we have ten blue coins.

773
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:20,488
The others have five each.

774
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:22,407
- That's a gamble.
- That's right.

775
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,284
If blue rises by 5,000 won, we win.

776
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:28,663
If blue gets a 10,000-won spike,
then our whole division can win.

777
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:30,749
Because we hold a lot of them?

778
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:33,126
It could be a mistake.

779
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:35,503
The others became our rivals
in an instant.

780
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,757
Let's say there's a margin
of four gold coins.

781
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,259
The differences may be tiny.

782
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:42,886
This is frustrating.

783
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:46,306
Team SNU in STEM succeeded in mining.

784
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:48,016
Thank you.

785
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:51,186
I don't know if it's Dong-geon
or Myeong-su, but I'm grateful.

786
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,687
That was a clutch move.

787
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,983
Our freshmen duo is doing a fine job.

788
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,401
Tell me about it. I'm so grateful.

789
00:37:58,485 --> 00:38:00,779
TEAM SNU IN STEM'S FRESHMEN DUO
DOING THEIR BEST UNTIL THE END

790
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,948
It helped that we didn't switch
our miners and traders as much.

791
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,492
It was for the better.

792
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:06,743
4 TRADERS STAYED ON THROUGHOUT THE GAME

793
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,536
How big is our lead in mining
from Round 7?

794
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:11,414
- It's huge.
- It's really huge.

795
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:13,708
- It's way too big.
- Absurdly so.

796
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:14,793
They can't overcome this.

797
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:17,128
- Turns out we didn't contribute much.
- Definitely.

798
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:19,130
We might have burned away 100,000 won.

799
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:20,924
Honestly? I think that's a possibility.

800
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:23,968
The whole game taught us
the true worth of honest work.

801
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:25,929
Never dream of hitting the jackpot.

802
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:27,847
- "Don't invest in crypto."
- "Get help for addiction."

803
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:33,144
That concludes Round 9 of Mine and Trade.

804
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:35,063
- Great work today.
- Thanks.

805
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:38,358
Really though, my number crunching
won't have been for nothing.

806
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,235
The game ended, no?

807
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:43,696
Oh, what a bummer.
All that remained was the addition.

808
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:44,864
You were amazing.

809
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:47,242
KIM JAE-HAN WAS THE ONLY STEM CONTESTANT
WHO DIDN'T ASK FOR A POSITION SWAP

810
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,785
- I'm sorry.
- What for?

811
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:51,204
I think it's over now.

812
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,957
- Let's still finish it.
- Okay.

813
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:58,711
We pulled our weight big time.
We mined 57 coins.

814
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:02,090
We're going to win. That's for sure.

815
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,508
There's no way we'll lose.

816
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:06,344
All contestants,
please come to the Main Hall

817
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:09,764
and stand before your base camps.

818
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:18,356
Now that we're lined up like this,
it hits me that we're on different teams.

819
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,066
But we were besties earlier.

820
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:21,901
I'm sure we're going to win.

821
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:24,195
HIS PERSONAL HOPES
The blue will cost 20,000 won.

822
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:27,782
Coin prices in Round 10
will now be revealed.

823
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:34,831
Black coin, 13,000 won.

824
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:37,375
Red coin, 18,000 won.

825
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:38,543
MEDICAL DIVISION'S INVESTMENTS
ALL PAID OFF

826
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,044
Blue coin...

827
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:41,963
Oh, come on.

828
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:48,595
Blue coin, 7,000 won.

829
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:51,472
BLUE COIN ONLY HAD A 2,000-WON INCREASE

830
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,017
That's good for us.

831
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:56,144
We won 10,000 won more than the others.

832
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,105
Nice, I'm so relieved.

833
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:00,273
- Is that a good thing?
- Yeah.

834
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:02,567
STEM Division took a gamble
on the blue coin.

835
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,027
- It didn't go up that much.
- No.

836
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,612
Pink coin, 14,000 won.

837
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:09,616
Purple coin, 17,000 won.

838
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:16,039
That concludes the main match,
Mine and Trade.

839
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:19,542
The total assets for each division
will now be announced.

840
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:21,044
Medical Division

841
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:24,589
has 2,205,000 won in total.

842
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:25,798
STEM Division

843
00:40:25,882 --> 00:40:28,676
has 1,764,000 won in total.

844
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,429
Medical Division wins the game.

845
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:39,187
Our division had better talents.
It wasn't surprising.

846
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:42,815
My teammate's mining
drove the division's victory,

847
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:45,652
so I'm grateful to them.

848
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:50,740
Each team's total assets
will now be revealed.

849
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:52,575
Gosh, I'm shaking.

850
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:53,910
Team SNU in Medicine

851
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,745
has 709,000 won.

852
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:57,497
Team Yonsei

853
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,248
has 731,000 won.

854
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:01,042
Team SKKU

855
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,211
has 765,000 won.

856
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:06,673
You mined that much?
Oh, the benefit of 20,000 won.

857
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:10,343
- We did better even without the benefit.
- Good job, team.

858
00:41:11,344 --> 00:41:13,012
Team SNU in STEM

859
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:16,265
has 629,000 won.

860
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,060
Team KAIST...

861
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:23,815
has 539,000 won.

862
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,692
TEAM KAIST WILL COMPETE IN THE DEATHMATCH

863
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:27,819
I thought, "Shoot, we're in trouble."

864
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,113
Team POSTECH...

865
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:32,198
TO SURVIVE, TEAM POSTECH'S ASSET
MUST EXCEED 630,000 WON

866
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:35,535
...has 596,000 won.

867
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:36,911
We're 30,000 won short.

868
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:38,871
If only we had 30,000 won more.

869
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:42,041
TEAM SNU IN STEM SURVIVES
BY 30,000-WON DIFFERENCE

870
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:44,252
I was relieved that we survived.

871
00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:49,173
Team SNU in STEM is advancing.

872
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:50,842
- It's a rival match.
- KAIST versus POSTECH.

873
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:52,051
Is it POSTECH versus KAIST?

874
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,761
The lowest-ranking two teams,

875
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:57,015
Team KAIST and Team POSTECH,

876
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,934
please prepare for the Deathmatch.

877
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:02,353
We can beat them.

878
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:04,522
Don't get nervous. We can beat them.

879
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:09,819
We go against Team POSTECH
this season, too?

880
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:16,534
Good luck.

881
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:20,663
I wonder when we first messed up.

882
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:23,249
Still, I'm so relieved we mined
the most coins in our division.

883
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,126
TOTAL MINED COINS

884
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,754
BEST IN MEDICAL DIVISION
TEAM YONSEI AND TEAM SKKU, 57 COINS

885
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:29,839
BEST IN STEM DIVISION
TEAM SNU IN STEM, 48 COINS

886
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:33,843
We're home.

887
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,764
We are victorious.

888
00:42:37,847 --> 00:42:38,765
Good work.

889
00:42:38,848 --> 00:42:40,683
- Well done.
- Great work, everyone.

890
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:42,560
Great work, everyone.

891
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:44,896
- Thank you.
- Thanks for everything.

892
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:46,189
That was fun.

893
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,940
- Because we won.
- Of course.

894
00:42:48,024 --> 00:42:50,068
Guys, we took them down a peg.

895
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:53,279
- Without the benefit, we're the best.
- That's true.

896
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:59,118
The Deathmatch will now begin.

897
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:02,205
TEAM KAIST VS TEAM POSTECH

898
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:04,707
I never thought we'd end up
in the Deathmatch on our first day.

899
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:07,251
Still, we were against Team POSTECH,
the weakest team.

900
00:43:07,335 --> 00:43:08,336
That eased my mind.

901
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:12,006
I said to myself,
"We're going to win this no matter what."

902
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:15,134
In this show,
Team POSTECH always lost to Team KAIST.

903
00:43:15,218 --> 00:43:16,886
We deserved to win at least once.

904
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:19,514
I thought, "This is our shot."

905
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:24,268
It weighs on me to see them
have a face-off at the Deathmatch.

906
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:26,229
It's a bleak situation.

907
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:30,066
- We're losing a dependable ally.
- Right.

908
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:31,734
Tell me about it.

909
00:43:32,485 --> 00:43:35,947
Today's Deathmatch is

910
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:38,116
Double-sided Bingo.

911
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:39,784
Bingo?

912
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,619
Double-sided Bingo?

913
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:43,496
In Double-sided Bingo,

914
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:46,541
you will be given tiles
with different colors on each side

915
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:49,460
to place on a 4-by-4 bingo board.

916
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:51,879
The first to get a bingo
by filling a line with the same color

917
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:53,673
wins the game.

918
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,675
That sounds interesting.

919
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:57,260
This should be fun.

920
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:58,886
The contestants will receive

921
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:02,431
a set of tiles
painted in red, yellow, or blue.

922
00:44:02,515 --> 00:44:05,143
Each piece has a different color
on each side,

923
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:08,354
and each set includes nine tiles.

924
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:10,565
The color covering the majority
of the front side

925
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:13,234
should be the same
on four neighboring squares

926
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,695
for you to get a bingo.

927
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:17,446
Consider the board on screen.

928
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:20,366
We have a bingo from the red column.

929
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:21,701
With a red-yellow tile...

930
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:23,744
You'd have red on the front
and yellow on the back.

931
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:24,704
I get it now.

932
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:27,456
- They put a frame for us to understand.
- Right.

933
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:30,418
It's the color in the center that counts.

934
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:34,755
Out of a horizontal,
vertical, or diagonal line,

935
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:38,009
all four tiles must be of the same color
for you to get a bingo.

936
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:39,635
Before we begin,

937
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:44,515
each player will be assigned a color
for them to get a bingo.

938
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:47,310
The designated colors will not match,

939
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:49,520
and they will remain undisclosed.

940
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:51,230
There's room for mind tricks.

941
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,316
Since they won't know
each other's assigned color,

942
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:55,067
they can fool their opponent.

943
00:44:55,151 --> 00:44:57,486
- Bluffing may help in some cases.
- Exactly.

944
00:44:57,570 --> 00:45:00,907
But you may end up
helping your opponent while bluffing.

945
00:45:01,324 --> 00:45:03,826
Two players will take turns
to place their tiles.

946
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:07,622
Once both players
have placed seven tiles each,

947
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:10,291
they will be allowed
to either place a new tile

948
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:15,004
or maneuver one of the placed ones
starting from their eighth turn.

949
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:18,382
First, they can move one of the tiles
to a neighboring empty square

950
00:45:18,466 --> 00:45:22,178
regardless of the color it is showing.

951
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:26,098
But you can't move the tile diagonally.

952
00:45:26,182 --> 00:45:27,683
But with 14 tiles placed,

953
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:29,769
- there's not much room to move.
- Right.

954
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:32,230
Still, moving the tiles around
can be the only option

955
00:45:32,313 --> 00:45:34,440
- when playing defensively.
- Exactly.

956
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:38,110
Second, they can flip one of the tiles
placed on the board

957
00:45:38,194 --> 00:45:42,573
regardless of the color it is showing.

958
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:46,786
You'll have to keep flipping
to show your assigned color.

959
00:45:47,662 --> 00:45:52,333
You must remember
that you can't move or flip the tile

960
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:55,711
that your opponent placed, moved,
or flipped in their latest turn.

961
00:45:55,795 --> 00:45:57,380
OPPONENT'S TILE IS OFF-LIMITS FOR 1 TURN

962
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:59,257
You can't touch the tile
the other just touched.

963
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:00,633
That's intense.

964
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:03,469
The latest tile being off-limits
makes it really hard.

965
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:08,516
The first to get a bingo
of their designated color wins.

966
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:12,019
There will be three rounds in total.

967
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:14,855
Each round will be played
on a one-on-one basis.

968
00:46:14,939 --> 00:46:18,985
Rounds 1 and 2 require different players,
but anyone can participate in Round 3.

969
00:46:19,068 --> 00:46:20,611
Out of a total of three rounds,

970
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:24,907
the team that secures two wins first
will be declared the winner.

971
00:46:27,994 --> 00:46:29,495
I started playing chess at a young age,

972
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:31,914
so I knew I could handle
a turn-based game.

973
00:46:31,998 --> 00:46:34,166
I thought, "I'm sure to win."

974
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:38,879
Usually, I can see 13 to 20 moves ahead
in a game of Connect Five.

975
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:41,132
So I felt confident about my chances.

976
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:45,970
The team to go first in Round 1
will be decided by Team POSTECH

977
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:48,180
as they held more assets
in the main match.

978
00:46:49,015 --> 00:46:51,225
They get to decide
since they had more money.

979
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:52,685
Won't they go first?

980
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:56,188
Since they can move or flip
a tile starting from the eighth turn...

981
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,524
- First player gets the advantage.
- Sure.

982
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:01,444
Both teams,
please start discussing your strategies.

983
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:05,031
I have to try it to get the hang of it.

984
00:47:05,114 --> 00:47:07,950
Do you think there's a strategy
that will guarantee a win?

985
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:10,661
All right. Hit me with your ideas.

986
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:13,581
I think we should claim the four corners

987
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:16,167
since they're necessary
in the intersecting lines.

988
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,376
- Do you follow?
- Yes.

989
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:18,711
Let's say my color is red.

990
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:20,755
With a yellow-red tile
and a blue-red tile in each row,

991
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:24,967
covering all four corners
to stop the opponent...

992
00:47:25,051 --> 00:47:28,137
- From using their assigned color?
- Yes, exactly.

993
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:30,389
If you secure all four corners

994
00:47:30,473 --> 00:47:33,267
using tiles with your color
with a different-colored rim,

995
00:47:33,351 --> 00:47:37,897
you hold two squares of horizontal,
vertical, and diagonal lines.

996
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:41,692
Then, you can force your opponent
to play on the defensive from all angles.

997
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:45,237
Even if your opponent
flips the tile in the top row

998
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:47,573
to show their assigned color, yellow,

999
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:49,992
they won't be able to get a bingo.

1000
00:47:50,076 --> 00:47:53,079
Even if your opponent has blue
as their designated color,

1001
00:47:53,162 --> 00:47:55,790
flipping the tile in the bottom row

1002
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:58,584
won't get them a bingo.

1003
00:47:58,918 --> 00:48:01,462
At the start,
prioritize securing the four corners

1004
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:03,839
and eliminating any threats.

1005
00:48:05,925 --> 00:48:06,926
Wait, but...

1006
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:10,388
The more I study the board,
the more important the center seems.

1007
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:14,141
All possible lines
intersect in this region,

1008
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:16,143
so our focus should be here.

1009
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:19,480
I suggest claiming two squares
in the center region.

1010
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:23,317
When your tile is in the center,
you have four options to spread out.

1011
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:26,487
Dominating the center region
was the priority.

1012
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:29,365
Won't the tiles in the outer region
have more value?

1013
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:30,408
In terms of value?

1014
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:34,120
But center spots give you
more options to spread out.

1015
00:48:34,203 --> 00:48:37,832
In bingo, the four center squares
are the most important.

1016
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:40,709
- Yes, they are.
- The center is the main battlefield.

1017
00:48:40,793 --> 00:48:43,212
But the players can move the tiles.

1018
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:45,798
The tiles in the center
can be moved elsewhere.

1019
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:47,258
- Yes, that's true.
- Right.

1020
00:48:47,675 --> 00:48:49,385
TEAM POSTECH: CORNER-ORIENTED APPROACH

1021
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:51,053
TEAM KAIST: CENTER-ORIENTED APPROACH

1022
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:52,930
Let's say I'm the first player.

1023
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:54,056
TEAM KAIST'S PRACTICE GAME

1024
00:48:55,975 --> 00:48:58,561
I can win this way, right?

1025
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:01,147
When I flip this later, it's game over.

1026
00:49:01,397 --> 00:49:02,565
The first player

1027
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:04,775
- can flip a tile first, right?
- Yes.

1028
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:06,986
- I see.
- The first player gets that advantage.

1029
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:09,155
We'll have to figure out
the opponent's color quickly,

1030
00:49:09,238 --> 00:49:10,531
especially if we're going second.

1031
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:12,950
If we're going second,
we'll have to play defensively

1032
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:14,034
in most cases.

1033
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:15,077
In most cases, yes.

1034
00:49:15,161 --> 00:49:18,372
What do you think
Team POSTECH will choose?

1035
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:20,499
They'll probably go first in Round 1.

1036
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:24,253
Now, we should decide
on our player roster.

1037
00:49:24,587 --> 00:49:26,839
Want to give it a go, Ji-hoo?
You've had a drill.

1038
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:28,716
- Get us an upset win.
- Win for us.

1039
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:32,845
Going second is a huge disadvantage,
but I'll do my best to win.

1040
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:35,055
Okay, then. Ji-hoo will play in Round 1.

1041
00:49:35,431 --> 00:49:37,433
Do we have any volunteers first?

1042
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:38,684
I'd like to play.

1043
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:40,352
- I want you to play, too.
- All right.

1044
00:49:40,436 --> 00:49:42,605
I'm good with games
that involve mind games,

1045
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:44,523
and I have a lot of experience.

1046
00:49:44,607 --> 00:49:47,193
I felt certain I could defeat anyone.

1047
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:51,697
The time for strategy meeting is up.

1048
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:55,034
- I've got to have faith in myself.
- Have faith.

1049
00:49:55,451 --> 00:49:57,328
Great. I feel like we won already.

1050
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:59,288
- Why don't we do our chant?
- Guys!

1051
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:01,081
One, two, three.

1052
00:50:01,165 --> 00:50:03,501
- KAIST!
- Let's go!

1053
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:05,711
- KAIST!
- Let's go!

1054
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:07,880
- Want to do ours here?
- Let's do it.

1055
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:09,590
- POSTECH!
- Let's go!

1056
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,176
It's all about the attitude.

1057
00:50:12,635 --> 00:50:14,011
We practically won already.

1058
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:14,929
We won.

1059
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:20,309
DEATHMATCH
DOUBLE-SIDED BINGO

1060
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:27,983
Which team should I root for?
This is driving me nuts.

1061
00:50:28,067 --> 00:50:29,235
The winner is our ally.

1062
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:31,654
Should I hope for one team
to dominate the match?

1063
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:35,533
Then, we'll have that competent team
as our ally tomorrow.

1064
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:38,160
- Why do we always end up here?
- Tell me about it.

1065
00:50:39,245 --> 00:50:42,039
One of my goals was
to contribute to Team KAIST's elimination.

1066
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:44,917
I was happy
to be given the chance to do so.

1067
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:48,170
I've got a good feeling about this.

1068
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:52,341
We will now begin the Deathmatch,
Double-sided Bingo.

1069
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:57,763
Both teams, please announce
which contestant will play in Round 1.

1070
00:50:58,264 --> 00:50:59,348
Team KAIST.

1071
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:02,851
Kang Ji-hoo will play
for Team KAIST in Round 1.

1072
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:06,772
I, Lee Jun-u, will play for Team POSTECH.

1073
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:09,108
So it's you.

1074
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:13,153
A FACE-OFF BETWEEN ALUMNI
OF GYEONGGIBUK SCIENCE HIGH

1075
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:14,989
He was one year ahead of you, right?

1076
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:18,742
What's with the look he's giving you?

1077
00:51:18,826 --> 00:51:21,537
That means all he can do
is try to get under my skin.

1078
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:25,833
He's always been like that.
I'm not even bothered.

1079
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,960
I know him well enough.

1080
00:51:28,586 --> 00:51:32,131
He's always been very playful
when we were in high school together.

1081
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:36,635
So I expected him to try
to shake me that way.

1082
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:41,932
Both teams, please take an envelope
and check your designated color.

1083
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:12,880
The players for Round 1,
Team POSTECH's Lee Jun-u

1084
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:15,841
and Team KAIST's Kang Ji-hoo,
please come up to the stage.

1085
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:26,810
- It's been a while.
- It's nice to see you here.

1086
00:52:27,728 --> 00:52:29,438
What's your assigned color?

1087
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:31,982
Don't pry on me just yet.

1088
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:34,109
- You'll use your color right away, no?
- You will, won't you?

1089
00:52:34,193 --> 00:52:35,110
You bet I will.

1090
00:52:35,194 --> 00:52:38,197
- Both of them seem so at ease.
- So relaxed.

1091
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,990
As expected from someone
who shares my name.

1092
00:52:40,074 --> 00:52:42,159
Ji-hoo's yapping
to make Jun-u lose his cool.

1093
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:47,081
That's so him.

1094
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:50,167
When it comes to games,
I can be a nightmarish opponent.

1095
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:54,630
I kept talking to Jun-u to irritate him
and shake him off mentally.

1096
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:58,467
I tried maintaining my composure
to play the game at my pace.

1097
00:53:00,803 --> 00:53:03,972
As Team POSTECH had
bigger total assets in the main match,

1098
00:53:04,056 --> 00:53:06,392
they will decide which team goes first.

1099
00:53:06,475 --> 00:53:07,393
Please make your choice.

1100
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:10,813
I'll go first.

1101
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:14,149
That's actually better.
He can play as he practiced.

1102
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:16,944
Did you have to be selfish and go first?

1103
00:53:18,404 --> 00:53:20,489
Your jokes are helping me relax.

1104
00:53:22,825 --> 00:53:25,494
Team POSTECH's Lee Jun-u.
Please place your tile.

1105
00:53:26,537 --> 00:53:28,539
You have one minute.

1106
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:41,719
That would mean
his color is yellow or red.

1107
00:53:41,802 --> 00:53:44,388
Could he have chosen that tile
to dupe Ji-hoo?

1108
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:47,850
You can't tell at first.

1109
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:49,977
So your color is yellow, right?

1110
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:52,980
Team KAIST's Kang Ji-hoo.

1111
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:54,231
Please place your tile.

1112
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,282
What was that about?

1113
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:04,450
It's a tactical move.

1114
00:54:04,533 --> 00:54:06,535
He showed so much spirit there.

1115
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:08,704
Deathmatches are all about attitude.

1116
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:10,456
That's true.

1117
00:54:19,465 --> 00:54:20,966
He's not hiding that it's yellow.

1118
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:22,426
He's not hiding it at all.

1119
00:54:28,557 --> 00:54:29,933
Two red tiles in a row.

1120
00:54:30,017 --> 00:54:33,187
He's as good as admitted
that his color is red, hasn't he?

1121
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:35,230
"Hey, my assigned color is red."

1122
00:54:35,481 --> 00:54:37,775
His color is red.
That's almost a declaration.

1123
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:40,527
Jun-u's color is yellow,
and Ji-hoo's color is red?

1124
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:42,154
- It looks that way.
- Right.

1125
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:44,156
It looks like they're going head-to-head.

1126
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:49,369
TEAM KAIST: RED, TEAM POSTECH: YELLOW

1127
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:52,247
Team POSTECH's Lee Jun-u.
Please place your tile.

1128
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:02,299
He's decided that the four corners
would give him an edge.

1129
00:55:03,342 --> 00:55:08,055
I think his plan is
to claim all four corners.

1130
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:11,642
I thought the center section
had more strategic value,

1131
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:14,102
but Jun-u kept placing his tiles
on the corners.

1132
00:55:14,353 --> 00:55:15,604
So you like the corners?

1133
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:21,360
- Looks like I'll beat my disadvantage.
- You have ten seconds left.

1134
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:27,533
Ji-hoo seems to be set on gaining
full control in the center.

1135
00:55:27,616 --> 00:55:29,576
He's going to take
the four squares in the center.

1136
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:30,911
I think so too.

1137
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:33,205
Their strategies
are drastically different.

1138
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:36,083
One goes for the center,
the other goes for the corners.

1139
00:55:37,835 --> 00:55:39,503
Will he take all the corners?

1140
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:41,672
I think that's likely

1141
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:45,217
because the diagonal line
has three red tiles on it.

1142
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:48,887
Jun-u will need that corner
for a defensive move.

1143
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:58,146
A DEFENSIVE MOVE USING
A TILE WITHOUT TEAM KAIST'S COLOR

1144
00:55:58,564 --> 00:56:00,941
There we go. That was good.

1145
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:05,779
I think he saw Ji-hoo's color as red
and made the best defensive move he could.

1146
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:08,323
You're smart. I'll give you that.

1147
00:56:08,407 --> 00:56:09,449
What do I do next?

1148
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:15,205
I know your color is yellow.

1149
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:22,880
TEAM KAIST CAN GET A BINGO
IF LEFT UNCHECKED

1150
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:25,799
LEE JUN-U'S DEFENSIVE MOVE

1151
00:56:25,883 --> 00:56:27,384
He just won, didn't he?

1152
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:28,427
Jun-u did, yes.

1153
00:56:29,553 --> 00:56:30,762
Did we just lose?

1154
00:56:30,846 --> 00:56:34,266
It's a double-three situation.
He has another opportunity over there.

1155
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:36,268
If Team POSTECH's player
places a yellow tile

1156
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:39,062
in either of the highlighted squares,

1157
00:56:39,855 --> 00:56:41,231
as the first player,

1158
00:56:41,315 --> 00:56:45,569
he gets his chance to flip or move a tile
on his eighth turn ahead of his opponent.

1159
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:48,947
Then, he can get a bingo.

1160
00:56:50,032 --> 00:56:51,867
I thought, "I'm in big trouble."

1161
00:56:56,163 --> 00:56:59,833
TEAM POSTECH STILL HAS
ONE VIABLE ROUTE OF ATTACK

1162
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:01,877
Since Jun-u went first,
he can finish the game

1163
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,587
- by flipping on his next turn.
- Right.

1164
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:14,932
You have ten seconds left.

1165
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:34,201
He could've won if he had chosen
that empty square. What a bummer.

1166
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:35,702
Why didn't he do that?

1167
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:37,955
It can be hard to see it
when you're under pressure.

1168
00:57:38,038 --> 00:57:40,415
I agree. That's possible.

1169
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:47,506
When Jun-u couldn't find the winning move,
I realized I could beat him.

1170
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:51,885
Team POSTECH's Lee Jun-u
will now take his turn.

1171
00:57:51,969 --> 00:57:53,637
Damn, I've been eyeing that spot.

1172
00:57:58,433 --> 00:58:01,019
TEAM POSTECH CREATED ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY

1173
00:58:01,395 --> 00:58:04,856
We need to counter that,
but we're out of blue-red tiles.

1174
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:07,484
- Ji-hoo only has blue-yellow tiles.
- Right.

1175
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:13,490
You have ten seconds left.

1176
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:21,707
- That finishes the game, no?
- No, Jun-u can't flip it.

1177
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:24,626
That one's off-limits.
So they both need to be on defense.

1178
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,921
From this point on,
you can place a new tile

1179
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:31,591
or select one of the tiles on the board
to move or flip it.

1180
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:34,845
Team POSTECH's Lee Jun-u
will now take his turn.

1181
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:37,305
- He needs to flip that red tile.
- Exactly.

1182
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:42,644
TEAM POSTECH ON DEFENSE

1183
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:45,230
Well done. He's doing great.

1184
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:47,691
Team KAIST's Kang Ji-hoo
will now take his turn.

1185
00:58:49,443 --> 00:58:50,610
He needs to fix

1186
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:53,363
- the bottom row with yellow tiles.
- He has to.

1187
00:58:53,989 --> 00:58:55,323
You have ten seconds left.

1188
00:59:00,746 --> 00:59:01,997
Yes, he needed that.

1189
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,957
Good job.

1190
00:59:10,005 --> 00:59:12,007
- Why did he do that?
- It was necessary.

1191
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:13,008
If he hadn't,

1192
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:16,178
Ji-hoo could flip the tile
next to the one Jun-u just flipped

1193
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:18,472
- and get the double-three.
- Oh, I see.

1194
00:59:20,307 --> 00:59:21,641
You have ten seconds left.

1195
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:27,773
He launched an attack.

1196
00:59:27,856 --> 00:59:30,192
Jun-u will have to choose one of those

1197
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:31,610
- to go on defense.
- Won't he pick one

1198
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:33,070
to defend and attack at the same time?

1199
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:38,825
This won't end until someone moves a tile.

1200
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:40,619
Both of them only have tiles

1201
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:43,288
that have the opponent's color.
They can't place any new tiles.

1202
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:45,624
Placing new tiles is
the last thing on their minds.

1203
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:48,919
I think the game will continue
until one of them messes up.

1204
00:59:52,881 --> 00:59:54,132
- I'll flip this.
- Okay.

1205
00:59:56,802 --> 00:59:58,136
You have ten seconds left.

1206
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:05,310
The game won't end at this rate.
How do I finish this?

1207
01:00:05,644 --> 01:00:07,354
He could try moving a tile.

1208
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:10,148
- But can he gain anything from that?
- Not really.

1209
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:13,193
But to break this cycle...

1210
01:00:18,532 --> 01:00:20,408
- Oh, he moved a tile.
- So it begins.

1211
01:00:20,492 --> 01:00:22,619
- That was smart, right?
- Yes, agreed.

1212
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:24,579
That eliminated the possibility
of the red column.

1213
01:00:24,663 --> 01:00:25,497
Right.

1214
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:27,332
I moved the tile

1215
01:00:27,415 --> 01:00:29,668
to remove the chance
of Ji-hoo getting a bingo

1216
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:31,211
and to seize control of the game.

1217
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:33,171
Jun-u made the smart choice.

1218
01:00:33,255 --> 01:00:34,089
He's brilliant.

1219
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:36,299
He came up with a solid strategy.

1220
01:00:36,383 --> 01:00:37,843
You have 30 seconds left.

1221
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:43,890
Out of the 6 red-yellow tiles,
5 tiles show red.

1222
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:46,226
Hey, that's impressive.

1223
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:48,270
When did Ji-hoo flip them all?

1224
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:51,231
The game's running smoothly
because both sides have planned ahead.

1225
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:53,692
Team POSTECH's Lee Jun-u
will now take his turn.

1226
01:00:57,195 --> 01:01:00,031
TEAM POSTECH'S LEE JUN-U
FOUND A NEW AVENUE OF ATTACK

1227
01:01:00,115 --> 01:01:01,741
- There we go.
- Yes.

1228
01:01:01,825 --> 01:01:03,160
That's the right call.

1229
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:05,871
Team KAIST's Kang Ji-hoo
will now take his turn.

1230
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:14,921
TEAM KAIST'S KANG JI-HOO FLIPPED
ALL THE RED-YELLOW TILES TO SHOW RED

1231
01:01:15,172 --> 01:01:17,757
Only a few tiles on the board show yellow.

1232
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:19,718
- That's true.
- Jun-u needs to flip them.

1233
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:20,802
That's for sure.

1234
01:01:20,886 --> 01:01:24,347
But Jun-u had to take that risk
to move the initial tile.

1235
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:31,813
Team KAIST's Kang Ji-hoo
will now take his turn.

1236
01:01:40,739 --> 01:01:43,116
- It's over.
- It's over?

1237
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,826
He's got a double-three.

1238
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:47,037
Ji-hoo can move this tile...

1239
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:50,790
I mean, he can slide it to the right
or flip that one to get a bingo.

1240
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:52,209
Hey, you're right.

1241
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:57,380
30 MINUTES AGO
If I build enough two-tile blocks

1242
01:01:57,464 --> 01:01:59,174
and claim the center section,

1243
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:02,093
I'll be able to find an angle
to get a double-three.

1244
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:06,848
The moment I got my double-three,
I thought I did it.

1245
01:02:06,932 --> 01:02:08,850
That took a weight off my chest.

1246
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:12,729
Shoot, he lost.

1247
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:14,189
You can't defend that.

1248
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:16,816
At any rate,
you need a double-three to win.

1249
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:18,235
Looks that way.

1250
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:24,199
Team KAIST's Kang Ji-hoo
will now take his turn.

1251
01:02:28,954 --> 01:02:32,874
Team KAIST's Kang Ji-hoo
got a bingo first.

1252
01:02:36,336 --> 01:02:38,046
All right. There we go.

1253
01:02:39,047 --> 01:02:41,633
Team POSTECH went first,
but Team KAIST won.

1254
01:02:41,925 --> 01:02:44,344
It was fun to watch a game
between skilled players.

1255
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:46,596
Both had a knack
for finding the best moves.

1256
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:47,555
Yes, they did.

1257
01:02:47,931 --> 01:02:50,308
Team POSTECH will have to win
two rounds back-to-back to survive.

1258
01:02:50,392 --> 01:02:51,559
It's pretty difficult.

1259
01:02:51,643 --> 01:02:52,978
We didn't see that coming.

1260
01:02:56,231 --> 01:02:58,525
One of my game plans was to provoke Jun-u.

1261
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:00,694
I later regretted it,
thinking maybe I went too far.

1262
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:01,945
I felt so bad for him.

1263
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:07,575
Ji-hoo's attempts at shaking me
didn't affect me all that much.

1264
01:03:07,659 --> 01:03:10,662
Rather, I think I lost
because I got impatient midway.

1265
01:03:10,745 --> 01:03:12,414
That leaves me with regrets.

1266
01:03:17,544 --> 01:03:18,503
I'm sorry.

1267
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:20,005
Dude, don't apologize.

1268
01:03:24,968 --> 01:03:26,803
Ji-hoo the Great.

1269
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:30,098
Well done.

1270
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:33,184
I shouldn't have moved the tile.
That puts you at a disadvantage.

1271
01:03:33,268 --> 01:03:35,979
If your opponent keeps
on flipping the tiles, you're helpless.

1272
01:03:36,271 --> 01:03:38,940
Your game taught us so much.

1273
01:03:39,024 --> 01:03:40,775
- It was an epic match.
- For sure.

1274
01:03:40,859 --> 01:03:42,193
Thanks for the great game.

1275
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:48,074
Both teams, please announce
which contestant will play in Round 2.

1276
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:51,036
DOUBLE-SIDED BINGO
ROUND 2

1277
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:53,413
I bet Team KAIST will send in Jeon Ji-min.

1278
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:55,081
- Ji-min...
- He's good.

1279
01:03:55,165 --> 01:03:57,792
He seems like the obvious choice.
He's good.

1280
01:03:57,876 --> 01:03:59,002
It will be Ji-min.

1281
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:02,505
I think the guy who participated
in Primality Test will compete here.

1282
01:04:04,007 --> 01:04:07,052
Kim Jae-han will play
for Team KAIST in Round 2.

1283
01:04:08,053 --> 01:04:10,764
- Team KAIST's Kim Jae-han is competing.
- Not Ji-min?

1284
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:14,142
UNEXPECTEDLY, TEAM KAIST'S KIM JAE-HAN
IS PLAYING IN ROUND 2

1285
01:04:14,225 --> 01:04:15,060
Good luck.

1286
01:04:15,143 --> 01:04:16,269
He doesn't need luck.

1287
01:04:16,353 --> 01:04:17,812
Go get them.

1288
01:04:18,063 --> 01:04:20,315
We tried a few practice games
by ourselves.

1289
01:04:20,398 --> 01:04:24,027
We then learned
that Jae-han had an eye for finding angles

1290
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:25,195
that we couldn't see.

1291
01:04:25,779 --> 01:04:27,947
DURING STRATEGY MEETING
KIM JI-U AND JEON JI-MIN'S PRACTICE GAME

1292
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:31,618
You know, you already lost

1293
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:33,995
when you placed the red-blue card,
completing the red column.

1294
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:35,747
THE FIRST PLAYER CAN FLIP THE CARD
AND GET A BINGO

1295
01:04:35,955 --> 01:04:38,083
Put it here,
and what with the blue tile...

1296
01:04:38,166 --> 01:04:39,250
JAE-HAN'S QUICK ANALYSIS

1297
01:04:39,334 --> 01:04:42,003
You can flip this,
but once you do, the game is over.

1298
01:04:42,087 --> 01:04:43,296
Block some other line, and you lose.

1299
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:45,632
- You're our man, Jae-han.
- You've got this.

1300
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:47,425
You want me to compete?

1301
01:04:47,509 --> 01:04:51,012
The game itself
was of the type I enjoy a lot.

1302
01:04:52,263 --> 01:04:55,141
The problem was that
my nerves often got the better of me.

1303
01:04:55,934 --> 01:04:56,768
So...

1304
01:04:56,851 --> 01:04:59,896
PRE-PRODUCTION INTERVIEW
KIM JAE-HAN WAS VISIBLY NERVOUS

1305
01:04:59,979 --> 01:05:02,023
What with mathematics... I mean...

1306
01:05:02,607 --> 01:05:03,441
I'm sorry.

1307
01:05:04,234 --> 01:05:07,278
- It's my kryptonite. I'm just...
- But you did fine just now.

1308
01:05:09,614 --> 01:05:12,659
Jae-han was hesitant to compete
because of his nerves,

1309
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:14,953
so I helped him loosen up
as best as I could.

1310
01:05:15,662 --> 01:05:16,663
You're doing great.

1311
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:18,748
- But...
- He's looking many moves ahead.

1312
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:19,707
He's seeing far and wide.

1313
01:05:19,791 --> 01:05:21,376
- Good luck.
- You've got this.

1314
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:24,379
I think you're great.
You're seeing so many moves ahead.

1315
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:26,089
It feels like we won already.

1316
01:05:27,132 --> 01:05:30,385
I felt grateful to my teammates,
and I was set on doing my best.

1317
01:05:30,718 --> 01:05:32,345
No pressure, though.

1318
01:05:32,429 --> 01:05:34,139
You were amazing during practice.

1319
01:05:34,222 --> 01:05:38,226
No offense to Ji-hoo when he just won,
but I think you're the best, Jae-han.

1320
01:05:38,518 --> 01:05:39,644
Just do what you did.

1321
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:40,979
TEAMMATES SHOWER HIM WITH COMPLIMENTS

1322
01:05:41,062 --> 01:05:42,355
Team POSTECH.

1323
01:05:42,439 --> 01:05:45,275
I, Hwang Seok-hun, will play
for Team POSTECH in Round 2.

1324
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:49,237
I knew that my defeat would mean
the end of my team's journey.

1325
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:50,864
So I had to win at all costs.

1326
01:05:51,448 --> 01:05:55,952
Both teams, please take an envelope
and check your designated color.

1327
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:58,371
I wonder what our color is

1328
01:05:58,455 --> 01:06:00,457
I wonder what it can be

1329
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:06,337
Let's see it together.

1330
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:12,886
Someone's got to bluff.

1331
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:14,596
It will be so cool if anyone tries it.

1332
01:06:15,346 --> 01:06:21,102
The players for Round 2,
please come up to the stage.

1333
01:06:21,352 --> 01:06:23,188
- Best of luck.
- You've got this.

1334
01:06:23,897 --> 01:06:25,398
Shoot, this is nerve-wracking.

1335
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:31,696
I don't want us to leave without a bang.

1336
01:06:32,197 --> 01:06:35,658
Team KAIST will go first
as their player went second in Round 1.

1337
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:38,828
Team KAIST's Kim Jae-han.
Please place your tile.

1338
01:06:44,501 --> 01:06:47,003
KIM JAE-HAN PLACED
A YELLOW TILE IN THE CENTER

1339
01:06:47,086 --> 01:06:50,131
That confirms it.
Their strategy is to claim the center.

1340
01:06:50,548 --> 01:06:53,718
Team POSTECH's Hwang Seok-hun.
Please place your tile.

1341
01:06:57,722 --> 01:06:59,390
BOTH PLACED A YELLOW TILE EACH

1342
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:00,683
What?

1343
01:07:00,767 --> 01:07:02,769
What the heck? Just a second.

1344
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:03,895
What's going on?

1345
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:05,855
One of them is bluffing.

1346
01:07:06,105 --> 01:07:07,524
Both placed yellow tiles.

1347
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:11,069
Team KAIST's Kim Jae-han.
Please place your tile.

1348
01:07:11,152 --> 01:07:12,779
PLACED ANOTHER YELLOW TILE

1349
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:14,822
He's using yellow tiles back-to-back?

1350
01:07:14,906 --> 01:07:17,450
Team KAIST's designated color
must be yellow.

1351
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:20,620
Team POSTECH's Hwang Seok-hun
will now take his turn.

1352
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:22,872
I think Team POSTECH's color is red.

1353
01:07:22,956 --> 01:07:24,666
I can't be sure
if their color is blue or red.

1354
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:25,750
I think it's blue.

1355
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:29,003
But if so, why put the red side up
instead of the blue side?

1356
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:31,589
To fool Jae-han completely?

1357
01:07:32,131 --> 01:07:34,592
I thought that it'd give
the second player an edge

1358
01:07:34,676 --> 01:07:36,928
to hide the assigned color.

1359
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:39,264
IMMEDIATELY AFTER ROUND 1
The way I see it,

1360
01:07:39,347 --> 01:07:43,142
it's best to place a tile with your color
upside down and flip it later.

1361
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:46,062
When your opponent knows your color,
they'll counter your move at every turn.

1362
01:07:46,145 --> 01:07:48,314
You then end up
with endless tile flipping.

1363
01:07:48,773 --> 01:07:49,941
You're going second,

1364
01:07:50,024 --> 01:07:52,860
so you need to find a way
to take your opponent by surprise.

1365
01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:55,613
Team KAIST's Kim Jae-han
will now take his turn.

1366
01:07:59,951 --> 01:08:02,579
- He got the reverse L shape.
- So he did.

1367
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:04,581
The first player has to try their best

1368
01:08:04,664 --> 01:08:06,916
to get the tiles
placed in a reverse L shape.

1369
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,126
Once you have that,

1370
01:08:08,376 --> 01:08:12,046
you get a two-tile cluster in vertical,
horizontal, and diagonal lines.

1371
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:14,424
If the second player makes
a single mistake,

1372
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:18,595
the first player can strike,
ending the game right then and there.

1373
01:08:18,845 --> 01:08:21,472
Team POSTECH's Hwang Seok-hun
will now take his turn.

1374
01:08:26,477 --> 01:08:27,854
I thought, "There we go."

1375
01:08:28,271 --> 01:08:29,355
He won.

1376
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:31,816
- All he has to do is hang in there.
- Right.

1377
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:33,651
If the first player
makes a two-tile cluster,

1378
01:08:33,735 --> 01:08:35,445
the second player can only use a tile

1379
01:08:35,528 --> 01:08:37,488
without the first player's color
for defense.

1380
01:08:37,572 --> 01:08:40,658
If they use one
with the first player's color,

1381
01:08:40,742 --> 01:08:44,495
the first player can add one more tile
and flip the second player's addition

1382
01:08:44,579 --> 01:08:46,205
to get a bingo first.

1383
01:08:46,581 --> 01:08:52,295
KIM JAE-HAN USED THE YELLOW TILES
TO QUICKLY MAKE A REVERSE L

1384
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:55,840
The thing was,
Seok-hun used a tile that included yellow.

1385
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:58,384
HWANG SEOK-HUN USED A TILE
WITH YELLOW ON ONE SIDE

1386
01:08:58,468 --> 01:09:00,219
That convinced me
that I had it in the bag.

1387
01:09:00,762 --> 01:09:03,056
Our strategy
was claiming the corners first,

1388
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:04,891
and I followed through.

1389
01:09:06,059 --> 01:09:07,143
Wait.

1390
01:09:07,602 --> 01:09:09,646
Team KAIST's Kim Jae-han
will now take his turn.

1391
01:09:10,396 --> 01:09:13,358
KIM JAE-HAN BUILT A 3-TILE CLUSTER
IN HIS ASSIGNED COLOR

1392
01:09:13,441 --> 01:09:16,736
ALL HE HAS TO DO TO GET A BINGO
IS FLIP THE TILE

1393
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:19,447
Team KAIST went first.
The game is as good as won.

1394
01:09:20,114 --> 01:09:22,200
Jae-han gets to start flipping tiles.

1395
01:09:24,661 --> 01:09:25,703
I lost.

1396
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:35,129
Whatever Seok-hun tries next,
he can't win if Jae-han plays on defense.

1397
01:09:35,213 --> 01:09:37,757
All Jae-han has to do is defend.

1398
01:09:39,217 --> 01:09:40,343
I felt so terrible,

1399
01:09:41,302 --> 01:09:43,304
so I turned around
to look at my teammates.

1400
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:46,432
- Seriously...
- I feel you.

1401
01:09:48,059 --> 01:09:50,019
What a shame.

1402
01:09:57,735 --> 01:09:59,570
- Jae-han looks relaxed.
- I see it.

1403
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:00,905
He found his composure.

1404
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:03,074
He's smiling, even.

1405
01:10:09,372 --> 01:10:12,375
If only I hadn't insisted
on hiding my color,

1406
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:13,710
I could've found a better move

1407
01:10:13,793 --> 01:10:16,629
and kept the game going
until we were flipping tiles for a while.

1408
01:10:16,713 --> 01:10:17,922
That filled me with regret.

1409
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:22,009
HWANG SEOK-HUN PLACES HIS 7TH TILE

1410
01:10:22,093 --> 01:10:24,470
Team KAIST's Kim Jae-han
will now take his turn.

1411
01:10:29,016 --> 01:10:32,562
Team KAIST's Kim Jae-han
got a bingo first.

1412
01:10:33,604 --> 01:10:37,734
I mostly felt terrible for my teammates.

1413
01:10:39,736 --> 01:10:41,154
- Oh, dear.
- Poor guy.

1414
01:10:41,404 --> 01:10:44,866
If only he hadn't gotten
so into the bluffing strategy.

1415
01:10:45,116 --> 01:10:47,201
Oh, man...

1416
01:10:51,706 --> 01:10:55,501
I knew he'd pull it off.
I had a good feeling about this.

1417
01:10:55,752 --> 01:10:58,004
- This is devastating.
- It's a bummer.

1418
01:10:58,337 --> 01:11:02,884
Round 2 of Double-sided Bingo
ends in Team KAIST's victory.

1419
01:11:07,597 --> 01:11:10,516
Both contestants,
please return to your places.

1420
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,393
- I'm sorry, guys.
- Don't be. You did great.

1421
01:11:12,477 --> 01:11:13,311
Don't worry about it.

1422
01:11:13,394 --> 01:11:15,688
I lost in the first place.
I'd never blame you.

1423
01:11:15,772 --> 01:11:17,440
- It's all on me.
- Not at all.

1424
01:11:19,317 --> 01:11:21,861
My man, Jae-han!

1425
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:23,404
Good job, both of you.

1426
01:11:23,488 --> 01:11:25,281
That was beautiful. Let me give you a hug.

1427
01:11:25,364 --> 01:11:27,033
Come here.

1428
01:11:28,201 --> 01:11:29,202
That was so cool.

1429
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:33,039
Now that I have tried it,
it had me thinking,

1430
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:36,834
"I'm pretty good.
I can actually hold my ground."

1431
01:11:36,918 --> 01:11:38,336
The experience gave me confidence.

1432
01:11:38,419 --> 01:11:41,380
I'll do my best moving forward.

1433
01:11:41,589 --> 01:11:43,800
If only the bluffing had worked.

1434
01:11:43,883 --> 01:11:47,178
He should've at least avoided
using a tile with a yellow side.

1435
01:11:47,261 --> 01:11:50,264
He was probably confident
about using yellow tiles

1436
01:11:50,348 --> 01:11:52,350
because he thought
he'd be flipping them first.

1437
01:11:52,683 --> 01:11:54,894
The loss wasn't on Seok-hun.
Jae-han just had a better plan.

1438
01:11:54,977 --> 01:11:56,604
Team KAIST identified the road to victory.

1439
01:11:56,687 --> 01:11:59,023
It's a strategy-based victory.

1440
01:11:59,649 --> 01:12:03,361
That concludes the Deathmatch,
Double-sided Bingo.

1441
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:05,196
The result will now be announced.

1442
01:12:05,655 --> 01:12:08,199
The winning team is Team KAIST.

1443
01:12:15,581 --> 01:12:20,253
The first team to be eliminated
from Elite League Season 3 is

1444
01:12:20,461 --> 01:12:22,338
Team POSTECH.

1445
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:27,635
It's nobody's fault but mine.

1446
01:12:28,803 --> 01:12:30,805
I almost had it, but I botched it.

1447
01:12:31,222 --> 01:12:33,057
Don't beat yourself over it.

1448
01:12:37,854 --> 01:12:41,065
Team POSTECH, please exit the grounds.

1449
01:12:41,816 --> 01:12:42,900
Oh, man...

1450
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:46,904
They're really leaving.

1451
01:12:46,988 --> 01:12:48,948
This isn't a survival show for nothing.

1452
01:12:54,036 --> 01:12:55,538
I didn't get to say goodbye.

1453
01:12:57,707 --> 01:13:00,418
I wanted to invite Jun-u for a meal.

1454
01:13:09,343 --> 01:13:10,761
I can't believe I made it here.

1455
01:13:11,721 --> 01:13:16,976
Initially, I had the daring dream
of outperforming the show's front-runners

1456
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:20,229
and overthrowing
the established university ranks.

1457
01:13:20,313 --> 01:13:22,064
Everyone will see us as underdogs.

1458
01:13:22,148 --> 01:13:23,316
We have to prove them wrong.

1459
01:13:24,191 --> 01:13:26,611
We didn't perform well enough
to accomplish that.

1460
01:13:28,321 --> 01:13:29,572
That fills me with regret.

1461
01:13:30,781 --> 01:13:31,991
I'll give you my energy.

1462
01:13:32,491 --> 01:13:34,410
I'm grateful to my team
for accompanying me

1463
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:35,912
on this short but meaningful journey.

1464
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:38,164
As a die-hard fan of Elite League...

1465
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:40,416
He couldn't have rewatched it
more than I did.

1466
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:43,210
Tell them you have the lines memorized.

1467
01:13:43,461 --> 01:13:44,962
I watched it like eight times.

1468
01:13:46,839 --> 01:13:50,593
It was an honor to be
a part of the show, if only briefly.

1469
01:13:50,968 --> 01:13:52,136
Thank you.

1470
01:13:53,304 --> 01:13:54,305
There we go.

1471
01:13:54,388 --> 01:13:59,602
Though it was for a brief period,
I'll cherish our time together

1472
01:13:59,894 --> 01:14:02,104
as a precious memory.

1473
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,815
The season's division setting
was a great opportunity

1474
01:14:04,899 --> 01:14:09,362
for me to demonstrate
that I chose not to go to medical school.

1475
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:10,696
It's a shame I couldn't.

1476
01:14:11,030 --> 01:14:14,116
I hope our rivals in the division,
Team KAIST and Team SNU in STEM,

1477
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,994
will beat all the med school teams
and become champions.

1478
01:14:34,845 --> 01:14:36,013
The logo lamp went out.

1479
01:14:36,681 --> 01:14:37,556
They turned white.

1480
01:14:38,432 --> 01:14:40,393
The strip lights now have a white glow.

1481
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:41,644
Hey, you're right.

1482
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:43,854
The colors look more harmonious this way.

1483
01:14:43,938 --> 01:14:46,232
- All in a blueish shade, right?
- Exactly.

1484
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:47,316
All right.

1485
01:14:47,942 --> 01:14:50,611
TEAM YONSEI'S BASE CAMP
What's our motto for the day?

1486
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:53,823
We'll take first place today.

1487
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:55,074
TEAM SNU'S BASE CAMP
Shall we?

1488
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:57,326
CHECKING THEIR REFLECTIONS

1489
01:14:57,410 --> 01:14:59,036
Looks like you have firm standards.

1490
01:14:59,578 --> 01:15:00,621
Fit check!

1491
01:15:00,705 --> 01:15:02,206
Fit check!

1492
01:15:02,289 --> 01:15:03,124
TEAM KAIST'S BASE CAMP

1493
01:15:03,207 --> 01:15:05,543
Ji-u, you remind me of CHUU today.

1494
01:15:07,211 --> 01:15:10,089
Not with that look, though.
When you smile.

1495
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:12,091
- I get it.
- You do, right?

1496
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:14,635
Don't agree to him, Jae-han.

1497
01:15:15,136 --> 01:15:16,595
It's just that I get why he said that.

1498
01:15:16,846 --> 01:15:19,306
Come to think of it,
isn't CHUU's real name Ji-u?

1499
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:21,767
CHUU'S REAL NAME IS ALSO KIM JI-U

1500
01:15:21,851 --> 01:15:24,020
I'm going to call you KAIST's TARZZAN.

1501
01:15:24,103 --> 01:15:25,813
TARZZAN, A MEMBER OF ALLDAY PROJECT

1502
01:15:27,481 --> 01:15:29,525
I think you'll become famous
as KAIST's CHUU.

1503
01:15:29,984 --> 01:15:31,277
KAIST's CHUU. KA-CHUU.

1504
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,945
- KA-CHUU.
- Just like Pikachu.

1505
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:34,196
"Pikachu."

1506
01:15:36,157 --> 01:15:37,491
"Pika-pika."

1507
01:15:37,575 --> 01:15:39,618
You're so annoying.

1508
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:42,288
TEAM SNU'S BASE CAMP

1509
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:44,248
Hey, something's inside.

1510
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:47,084
"Elite League Board Game."

1511
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:49,086
We can play board games?

1512
01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:50,337
ELITE LEAGUE BOARD GAME

1513
01:15:50,629 --> 01:15:54,633
Can we play a variety of games
with that single set?

1514
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:56,844
"Match and Mix,
Rotate! Rock, Paper, Scissors."

1515
01:15:56,927 --> 01:16:00,473
- Guys, there's "Signal Investigation"!
- Oh, that was my favorite.

1516
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:01,849
What's all this?

1517
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:05,478
I wanted to try the old games.

1518
01:16:06,103 --> 01:16:07,855
It's a worthy investment.

1519
01:16:07,938 --> 01:16:09,940
You can get four games out of it.

1520
01:16:10,524 --> 01:16:11,859
This looks like fun.

1521
01:16:11,942 --> 01:16:13,694
The dice
for Rotate! Rock, Paper, Scissors.

1522
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:15,488
These cards are for Signal Investigation.

1523
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:18,866
- I wanted to play this.
- Me too.

1524
01:16:18,949 --> 01:16:20,785
These cards are for Pixel Number.

1525
01:16:20,868 --> 01:16:22,244
I like that game.

1526
01:16:22,453 --> 01:16:26,165
My favorite is Signal Investigation.
It makes you feel like a detective.

1527
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:29,752
I want to keep one in my student club room
and play with the members.

1528
01:16:29,835 --> 01:16:31,796
"This is the perk
of having a cast member as your friend."

1529
01:16:32,088 --> 01:16:33,547
- I want to get one.
- What happened?

1530
01:16:33,631 --> 01:16:34,632
Did you spill your coffee?

1531
01:16:34,715 --> 01:16:37,468
- I said I wanted to buy one.
- Sorry, I misheard that.

1532
01:16:40,054 --> 01:16:41,764
I didn't mess up, okay?

1533
01:16:41,847 --> 01:16:44,141
I thought you followed
in Dong-jae's footsteps.

1534
01:16:45,935 --> 01:16:48,312
WHILE WATCHING THE ACE MATCH,
PRIMALITY TEST

1535
01:16:50,648 --> 01:16:51,482
Are you okay?

1536
01:16:51,565 --> 01:16:53,692
THIS IS WHAT DONG-YEON MEANT
BY FOLLOWING IN DONG-JAE'S FOOTSTEPS

1537
01:16:53,776 --> 01:16:55,069
You must've been pretty nervous.

1538
01:16:55,152 --> 01:16:58,614
Wait. No, I should be okay.
I doubt that will make the final cut.

1539
01:17:00,658 --> 01:17:02,910
I thought someone spilled drinks again.

1540
01:17:02,993 --> 01:17:04,912
I'd like to try the games
when this hits the market.

1541
01:17:04,995 --> 01:17:07,164
- I'm going to buy it for real.
- Same here.

1542
01:17:07,998 --> 01:17:10,084
I wonder what kind of game
they prepared today.

1543
01:17:12,253 --> 01:17:15,673
I wonder how the games will be affected
now that STEM Division is...

1544
01:17:15,756 --> 01:17:18,092
- Yes, it's 3 teams against 2 teams.
- ...missing a team.

1545
01:17:18,592 --> 01:17:20,177
To avoid today's Deathmatch,

1546
01:17:20,261 --> 01:17:21,929
- our division has to...
- We must win.

1547
01:17:22,012 --> 01:17:23,264
That's for sure.

1548
01:17:23,347 --> 01:17:25,391
I really hope
we beat Medical Division today.

1549
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:27,393
I want that so badly.

1550
01:17:27,726 --> 01:17:29,436
Can you handle spatial awareness games?

1551
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:30,813
How about games like Pixel Number?

1552
01:17:30,896 --> 01:17:33,274
I can handle any question
in under 30 seconds.

1553
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:36,193
I love it.

1554
01:17:36,277 --> 01:17:37,403
We did calculations yesterday,

1555
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:40,322
so our reasoning or memorization skills
will be tested today.

1556
01:17:40,406 --> 01:17:41,615
Are you good with sequences?

1557
01:17:41,699 --> 01:17:43,576
- Of course, I am.
- What about you?

1558
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:45,161
Why don't I quiz you on sequences?

1559
01:17:45,244 --> 01:17:49,039
TEAM YONSEI'S SEQUENCE EXERCISE

1560
01:17:53,752 --> 01:17:55,171
I see 9 times 9

1561
01:17:55,254 --> 01:17:56,463
and 9 times 7.

1562
01:17:57,047 --> 01:17:58,883
That approach will take you a full day.

1563
01:18:01,635 --> 01:18:02,553
I'll tell you the answer.

1564
01:18:02,636 --> 01:18:05,472
- No, stop!
- Don't tell us just yet!

1565
01:18:05,556 --> 01:18:07,349
How dare you try to feed us answers?

1566
01:18:08,976 --> 01:18:12,104
Wait, I see 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32.

1567
01:18:12,188 --> 01:18:14,106
- The next should be 64.
- So the answer is 4.

1568
01:18:14,607 --> 01:18:18,402
A SEQUENCE LISTING POWERS OF 2
IN DOUBLE-DIGIT NUMBERS

1569
01:18:18,485 --> 01:18:19,653
It's actually 41.

1570
01:18:20,946 --> 01:18:22,656
You're embarrassing us.

1571
01:18:25,951 --> 01:18:29,663
Brainpower survival challenge,
Elite League Season 3.

1572
01:18:31,248 --> 01:18:33,083
- Here we go.
- The surviving teams are as follows.

1573
01:18:33,292 --> 01:18:38,380
In Medical Division, Team SNU in Medicine,
Team Yonsei, and Team SKKU.

1574
01:18:43,636 --> 01:18:45,888
In STEM Division, Team SNU in STEM...

1575
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:48,307
- Our survival is a given.
- Sure.

1576
01:18:49,767 --> 01:18:51,227
...and Team KAIST.

1577
01:18:56,857 --> 01:18:58,734
They're our polar opposite.

1578
01:18:59,026 --> 01:18:59,985
I love Team KAIST's energy.

1579
01:19:00,277 --> 01:19:01,946
They're hyped up
after surviving the Deathmatch.

1580
01:19:02,238 --> 01:19:03,197
They'd be super pumped.

1581
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:05,032
Team KAIST returns from hell.

1582
01:19:05,866 --> 01:19:07,409
Shoot, my throat hurts.

1583
01:19:09,370 --> 01:19:13,249
We intimidated the others,
but I took some damage in the process.

1584
01:19:14,166 --> 01:19:17,294
Today's Ace Selection will test

1585
01:19:18,128 --> 01:19:20,047
your reasoning skills.

1586
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:21,423
Reasoning!

1587
01:19:22,716 --> 01:19:23,842
Just as you suggested.

1588
01:19:23,926 --> 01:19:26,512
The keyword alone doesn't give us
any hints on the game.

1589
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:28,806
It's easy to guess the calculation games.

1590
01:19:28,889 --> 01:19:30,683
But this keyword itself
requires reasoning skills.

1591
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:33,519
Reasoning games
may involve numbers like...

1592
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:34,979
Sequence-based questions?

1593
01:19:35,062 --> 01:19:37,481
It could be something basic
like identifying a sequence rule.

1594
01:19:37,564 --> 01:19:39,275
Remember that game from Season 1

1595
01:19:39,358 --> 01:19:41,944
where a set of sentences stated
how many numbers were in it?

1596
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:43,529
IN THIS SENTENCE,
THE NUMBER OF OCCURRENCES

1597
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:44,863
OF THE DIGIT 1 IS X
OF THE DIGIT 2 IS X...

1598
01:19:45,239 --> 01:19:47,074
We may get a similar game today.

1599
01:19:47,157 --> 01:19:49,952
We may get a game using logical reasoning
like back in Season 1.

1600
01:19:50,035 --> 01:19:52,955
TEAM SKKU IS MAKING THE SAME GUESS
AS TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE

1601
01:19:53,038 --> 01:19:56,208
I think we'll get something
similar to that game.

1602
01:19:56,292 --> 01:19:57,793
It's that or sequences.

1603
01:19:57,876 --> 01:19:58,752
Are you good with that?

1604
01:19:58,836 --> 01:19:59,878
- Sequences?
- Yes.

1605
01:19:59,962 --> 01:20:02,381
When it comes to finding rules
like in past Elite League games,

1606
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:04,633
I'm about as good as anyone.

1607
01:20:04,717 --> 01:20:06,176
You're competing today, then.

1608
01:20:06,468 --> 01:20:08,721
After all that grumbling,
he crushed yesterday's game.

1609
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:12,808
If he feels he's as good as anyone,
that means he has to compete today.

1610
01:20:12,891 --> 01:20:14,643
And you, Pikachu.

1611
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:16,103
Go, Pikachu!

1612
01:20:18,314 --> 01:20:20,316
I get the feeling
you're good at reasoning.

1613
01:20:20,399 --> 01:20:21,525
Logical reasoning?

1614
01:20:21,608 --> 01:20:23,193
It's about time you stepped up, Ji-u.

1615
01:20:25,446 --> 01:20:27,781
I think reasoning can be defined

1616
01:20:27,865 --> 01:20:32,661
as investigating various possible cases
to find one fitting answer.

1617
01:20:32,953 --> 01:20:34,621
You look especially smart today.

1618
01:20:34,705 --> 01:20:36,915
That's the vibe I'm going for.

1619
01:20:36,999 --> 01:20:38,292
It's my concept for the day.

1620
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:40,377
I'm saving STEM Division from danger.

1621
01:20:40,461 --> 01:20:42,796
We're not in danger yet.
Why do you keep saying that?

1622
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:44,840
Because my plan today
is to win the main match.

1623
01:20:45,341 --> 01:20:46,925
When we win,
we'll be free from the dangers.

1624
01:20:47,009 --> 01:20:49,053
My plan includes
Team Yonsei getting eliminated

1625
01:20:49,136 --> 01:20:51,055
after a Deathmatch with Team SKKU.

1626
01:20:51,138 --> 01:20:54,099
Team Yonsei may get eliminated
after a face-off with the other Team SNU.

1627
01:20:54,183 --> 01:20:56,518
Why do you both say
Team Yonsei will be gone?

1628
01:20:57,728 --> 01:20:59,104
Why regard Team Yonsei as an underdog?

1629
01:20:59,188 --> 01:21:01,273
Team SKKU was so impressive yesterday.

1630
01:21:01,732 --> 01:21:03,942
By the end of the season,

1631
01:21:04,026 --> 01:21:06,195
we'll have to compete
in games with 3 1-on-1 rounds.

1632
01:21:06,278 --> 01:21:09,573
Since our strengths differ,
I want us to take turns to participate.

1633
01:21:09,656 --> 01:21:12,034
Why don't you compete today?
You said your strength was reasoning.

1634
01:21:12,117 --> 01:21:13,577
All right.

1635
01:21:14,036 --> 01:21:19,249
Reasoning and spatial awareness
are the areas I feel most confident in.

1636
01:21:19,333 --> 01:21:22,753
Today's Ace Match was reasoning,
so I thought I had a good shot at it.

1637
01:21:22,836 --> 01:21:24,296
That's why I decided to compete.

1638
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:26,090
- Good luck.
- We'll do our best.

1639
01:21:26,173 --> 01:21:27,841
You've got this.

1640
01:21:28,092 --> 01:21:30,260
The time for strategy meeting is up.

1641
01:21:30,344 --> 01:21:33,972
The contestants
competing in the Ace Selection,

1642
01:21:34,056 --> 01:21:35,974
please gather in the Main Hall.

1643
01:21:37,059 --> 01:21:40,687
TEAM SNU IN STEM
HAN JONG-YUN, SONG MYEONG-SU

1644
01:21:41,230 --> 01:21:42,064
Let's go.

1645
01:21:42,147 --> 01:21:44,400
TEAM YONSEI
LEE YUN-BEOM, CHOI A-IN

1646
01:21:44,483 --> 01:21:47,069
TEAM SKKU
KIM DONG-YEON, LEE DONG-JAE

1647
01:21:47,403 --> 01:21:49,738
The rosters have changed
a lot from yesterday.

1648
01:21:49,822 --> 01:21:52,116
One thing's for certain.
They're all yesterday's miners.

1649
01:21:52,199 --> 01:21:54,451
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE
KIM MIN-SEOK, JOO MIN-SEO

1650
01:21:54,785 --> 01:21:56,120
Every team sent their best miners.

1651
01:21:56,203 --> 01:21:57,746
TEAM KAIST
KIM JAE-HAN, KIM JI-U

1652
01:21:58,163 --> 01:22:00,290
The second Ace Selection is...

1653
01:22:03,836 --> 01:22:05,629
Between the Numbers.

1654
01:22:07,214 --> 01:22:08,424
"Between"?

1655
01:22:08,799 --> 01:22:10,300
Sequence, right?

1656
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:11,844
In Between the Numbers,

1657
01:22:11,927 --> 01:22:14,012
your task is to place the numbers
in the empty slots

1658
01:22:14,096 --> 01:22:16,932
while satisfying all of the conditions.

1659
01:22:17,015 --> 01:22:19,435
When you place numbers
in the example below,

1660
01:22:19,518 --> 01:22:23,522
there should be only 1 number
between the 2 instances of number 1.

1661
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:27,443
There should be 2 numbers
between the 2 instances of number 2.

1662
01:22:27,526 --> 01:22:31,405
Lastly, there should be 3 numbers
between the 2 instances of number 3.

1663
01:22:32,656 --> 01:22:35,117
SAMPLE QUESTION: 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3
ANSWER: 3113

1664
01:22:37,327 --> 01:22:39,121
Hey, there was a similar game.

1665
01:22:39,204 --> 01:22:41,331
Yes, it's just like Perfect Number.

1666
01:22:42,082 --> 01:22:45,669
Season 1 had a similar game
called Perfect Number.

1667
01:22:45,752 --> 01:22:50,132
I remembered solving it very quickly,
so that boosted my confidence.

1668
01:22:50,215 --> 01:22:53,802
This was the type of game I excel at.

1669
01:22:53,886 --> 01:22:57,973
I wanted to be my division's Ace player
and leave a strong impression.

1670
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:00,851
Jae-han's gotten more confident.

1671
01:23:00,934 --> 01:23:01,894
I love seeing it.

1672
01:23:02,352 --> 01:23:03,187
I trust you, Jae-han.

1673
01:23:03,270 --> 01:23:05,397
He's got a great sense of numbers.

1674
01:23:05,481 --> 01:23:09,109
We will now begin the Ace Selection,
Between the Numbers.

1675
01:23:09,193 --> 01:23:11,236
Here is your question.

1676
01:23:14,531 --> 01:23:15,991
Just a second.

1677
01:23:16,074 --> 01:23:17,659
BETWEEN 1 AND 1, THERE IS 1 NUMBER

1678
01:23:17,743 --> 01:23:19,161
BETWEEN 2 AND 2, THERE ARE 2 NUMBERS

1679
01:23:19,244 --> 01:23:20,829
BETWEEN 3 AND 3, THERE ARE 3 NUMBERS

1680
01:23:20,913 --> 01:23:22,122
BETWEEN 4 AND 4, THERE ARE 4 NUMBERS

1681
01:23:22,206 --> 01:23:23,415
BETWEEN 5 AND 5, THERE ARE 5 NUMBERS

1682
01:23:23,499 --> 01:23:24,666
BETWEEN 6 AND 6, THERE ARE 6 NUMBERS

1683
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:25,876
BETWEEN 7 AND 7, THERE ARE 7 NUMBERS

1684
01:23:26,668 --> 01:23:29,463
That's tricky.

1685
01:23:36,512 --> 01:23:38,347
It's difficult.

1686
01:23:44,811 --> 01:23:47,773
We have to start from the condition
with the least possible cases.

1687
01:23:48,232 --> 01:23:52,361
There were only a few spots
where we could use 7 or 5.

1688
01:23:52,903 --> 01:23:55,531
I started shifting the sevens
to look for my answer.

1689
01:23:55,614 --> 01:24:00,327
Now that I know where the 7s go,
I need to place the 5s.

1690
01:24:00,786 --> 01:24:02,496
You should start with the sevens.

1691
01:24:02,579 --> 01:24:04,581
Frankly, there aren't so many options.

1692
01:24:04,957 --> 01:24:07,918
The first 7 can only go
in the first 3 slots...

1693
01:24:08,001 --> 01:24:11,088
If the first number seven is placed
in the highlighted slot,

1694
01:24:11,171 --> 01:24:13,840
the next number seven has to go
in the next highlighted slot.

1695
01:24:13,924 --> 01:24:16,510
But since six already occupies it,

1696
01:24:16,593 --> 01:24:20,556
the first number seven
can't be placed in this slot.

1697
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:23,517
As such, the first number seven
can only be placed

1698
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,727
in one of the three colored slots.

1699
01:24:25,811 --> 01:24:27,187
Using this method,

1700
01:24:27,271 --> 01:24:30,857
examine the possible cases
starting from the bigger numbers

1701
01:24:30,941 --> 01:24:34,152
to narrow down the options
and find the answer.

1702
01:24:34,653 --> 01:24:37,364
I think you've got to place
the bigger numbers first.

1703
01:24:37,447 --> 01:24:40,075
It's best to keep
the smaller numbers until the end.

1704
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:42,661
There's no room for guesswork.
You must use logic all the way

1705
01:24:42,744 --> 01:24:45,205
to determine the slots
for numbers 7 and 5.

1706
01:24:45,289 --> 01:24:48,125
Once you finish examining
all the possible cases,

1707
01:24:48,208 --> 01:24:50,544
you will see that those are the only slots
for numbers 5 and 7.

1708
01:24:59,678 --> 01:25:01,638
But they can only use mental math.

1709
01:25:01,722 --> 01:25:03,682
Right, they can't make notes.

1710
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:06,059
They can only type in the answer.

1711
01:25:06,143 --> 01:25:08,186
Cracking all that in your mind
won't be so easy.

1712
01:25:09,521 --> 01:25:11,398
It was very challenging

1713
01:25:11,481 --> 01:25:14,693
to count the squares by sight
without being able to take notes.

1714
01:25:16,486 --> 01:25:18,780
Initially, I thought
this was a piece of cake.

1715
01:25:20,073 --> 01:25:21,950
I realized it was more difficult
than I had thought.

1716
01:25:24,786 --> 01:25:27,247
It's confusing to solve this
relying on your memory.

1717
01:25:27,331 --> 01:25:30,125
Please get it, guys.
Let's go, Team Yonsei.

1718
01:25:30,208 --> 01:25:32,878
We'll secure the benefit,
win the main match,

1719
01:25:33,837 --> 01:25:36,131
and avoid the Deathmatch.

1720
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:46,391
Three...

1721
01:25:51,021 --> 01:25:52,022
One contestant submitted

1722
01:25:52,105 --> 01:25:54,650
the correct answer
for Between the Numbers.

1723
01:25:54,733 --> 01:25:55,859
Did someone solve it?

1724
01:25:57,861 --> 01:25:59,863
You've got this, Jae-han and Ji-u.

1725
01:26:00,238 --> 01:26:01,823
Medical Division's Ace player is...

1726
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:08,080
Team Yonsei's Choi A-in.

1727
01:26:10,374 --> 01:26:13,168
- Yes, that's what I'm talking about!
- What's with A-in?

1728
01:26:13,502 --> 01:26:15,212
That's exactly what I wanted!

1729
01:26:15,295 --> 01:26:18,507
MEDICAL DIVISION'S ACE PLAYER:
TEAM YONSEI, CHOI A-IN

1730
01:26:21,551 --> 01:26:24,179
I placed second in the pre-test.

1731
01:26:24,262 --> 01:26:26,973
I felt great
when I heard that I got it right.

1732
01:26:27,057 --> 01:26:30,352
I concluded that reasoning
was my strength, just as I thought.

1733
01:26:31,061 --> 01:26:34,064
I think I'll remember the answer
until my dying day.

1734
01:26:35,107 --> 01:26:37,275
- She's good.
- I see that.

1735
01:26:37,693 --> 01:26:39,486
As expected
of a Sejong Science High valedictorian.

1736
01:26:39,569 --> 01:26:40,737
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

1737
01:26:40,821 --> 01:26:43,323
Dong-jae believes Sang-yeon
is Team Yonsei's central figure.

1738
01:26:43,532 --> 01:26:45,450
He does lead the group, actually.

1739
01:26:45,701 --> 01:26:47,244
- He has the experience.
- Yes.

1740
01:26:47,327 --> 01:26:50,622
I think Sang-yeon lacks flexibility.
But A-in is flexible.

1741
01:26:50,706 --> 01:26:54,960
- Really?
- I actually see her as more of a threat.

1742
01:26:55,043 --> 01:26:57,421
- We'll have to defeat her in the end.
- That's right.

1743
01:26:57,921 --> 01:27:01,883
STEM DIVISION DOESN'T HAVE
AN ACE PLAYER YET

1744
01:27:04,386 --> 01:27:05,762
STEM people haven't solved it yet.

1745
01:27:05,846 --> 01:27:07,055
Yes, they're still working on it.

1746
01:27:07,139 --> 01:27:07,973
We crushed them.

1747
01:27:08,056 --> 01:27:09,558
- It's a landslide.
- For sure.

1748
01:27:09,641 --> 01:27:12,394
- I'm sending a mental message.
- They wouldn't remember it, though.

1749
01:27:12,477 --> 01:27:14,938
- Three, seven...
- They'd go, "Come again"?

1750
01:27:15,021 --> 01:27:16,523
I wonder who'll get it first.

1751
01:27:16,606 --> 01:27:18,024
I want our guys to show our strength.

1752
01:27:18,608 --> 01:27:21,486
My gut says Jong-yun will do that.

1753
01:27:28,368 --> 01:27:30,287
STEM Division's Ace player is...

1754
01:27:30,370 --> 01:27:32,748
STEM DIVISION'S ACE PLAYER

1755
01:27:32,831 --> 01:27:33,915
...Team SNU's...

1756
01:27:34,708 --> 01:27:36,168
Oh, shoot.

1757
01:27:40,088 --> 01:27:41,631
...Song Myeong-su.

1758
01:27:43,341 --> 01:27:44,593
- All right.
- Great.

1759
01:27:44,676 --> 01:27:46,219
STEM DIVISION'S ACE PLAYER:
TEAM SNU IN STEM, SONG MYEONG-SU

1760
01:27:47,512 --> 01:27:49,598
Logical reasoning
has always been one of my strengths.

1761
01:27:49,681 --> 01:27:53,810
I thought that if I could keep it up,
I could secure the benefit as well.

1762
01:27:54,186 --> 01:27:55,854
Here's your answer.

1763
01:27:58,607 --> 01:28:00,859
That concludes the Ace Selection.

1764
01:28:01,485 --> 01:28:03,487
Good luck on the Ace Match.

1765
01:28:03,779 --> 01:28:06,198
I'll get us the benefit.

1766
01:28:06,907 --> 01:28:08,742
I ranked higher than Myeong-su
in the pre-test,

1767
01:28:08,825 --> 01:28:10,285
and I noticed how long it took him.

1768
01:28:10,368 --> 01:28:14,664
I felt good about my chances
of defeating him in the Ace Match.

1769
01:28:14,748 --> 01:28:18,126
The pre-test and the games
were entirely different matters.

1770
01:28:18,210 --> 01:28:20,420
I wasn't worried. I felt pretty confident.

1771
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:24,800
We will now begin the Ace Match,
Three-way Divide.

1772
01:28:25,258 --> 01:28:26,760
The game involves the Korean alphabet.

1773
01:28:26,843 --> 01:28:28,386
Man, that looks like a blast!

1774
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:30,764
That's an inhuman speed. It's outrageous.

1775
01:28:32,307 --> 01:28:33,308
Team SNU's Song Myeong-su.

1776
01:28:33,725 --> 01:28:36,019
I'm getting a dopamine rush.

1777
01:28:36,102 --> 01:28:37,729
I never fall apart.

1778
01:28:38,647 --> 01:28:40,148
Team Yonsei's Choi A-in.

1779
01:28:40,232 --> 01:28:41,274
That is correct.

1780
01:28:41,358 --> 01:28:42,776
Way to go, A-in!

1781
01:28:42,859 --> 01:28:44,277
Today's main match is...

1782
01:28:45,195 --> 01:28:47,239
Exit Strategy 3.

1783
01:28:47,322 --> 01:28:48,406
What does the hunter do?

1784
01:28:48,490 --> 01:28:49,491
Can they remove a piece?

1785
01:28:49,574 --> 01:28:50,826
Let's take this.

1786
01:28:50,909 --> 01:28:52,118
This is a sure way to win.

1787
01:28:52,202 --> 01:28:53,370
We don't need to get intimidated.

1788
01:28:53,453 --> 01:28:55,372
This will be our main battleground.

1789
01:28:55,455 --> 01:28:57,707
We achieved our goal,
and they took the bait.

1790
01:29:40,417 --> 01:29:42,419
