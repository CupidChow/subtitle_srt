00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,996
MEDICAL DIVISION
DEATHMATCH

2
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:31,565
<i>One of those lamps will be off tomorrow.</i>

3
00:00:31,999 --> 00:00:34,234
Oh, man. If we had to be there now...

4
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:37,271
You'd hate to be there, right?

5
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,276
This is just a chapter
in our epic journey.

6
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:43,210
Of course.

7
00:00:43,277 --> 00:00:46,713
Be it in the Deathmatch or the main match,
the winner will advance.

8
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:48,849
- Let's just have fun.
- All right.

9
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:50,884
The ones having fun will win.

10
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,120
I don't think we'll lose.

11
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,521
- Me neither.
- We'll do fine.

12
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:56,423
We're not going to lose. Just look at us.

13
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:58,559
They don't stand a chance against us.

14
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,362
Do you want to compete
if we get a one-on-one game?

15
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,899
It depends.
If it tests memorization, I'll handle it.

16
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:11,271
<i>Please gather outside your base camps</i>
<i>for the Deathmatch.</i>

17
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:13,674
- Let's go.
- Shall we do a chant?

18
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,443
- SKKU!
- SKKU!

19
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,946
- Let's go, SNU!
- Let's go, SNU!

20
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:20,847
- Akaraka!
- Akaraka!

21
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,549
- Let's go, Yonsei!
- Let's go, Yonsei!

22
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:24,117
DISAPPOINTED

23
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:26,787
- Let's go, Yonsei!
- Let's go, Yonsei!

24
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:28,555
They're not in sync at all.

25
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:30,390
That was freaking hilarious.

26
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:34,428
<i>Brainpower survival challenge,</i>
<i>Elite League Season 3.</i>

27
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:39,232
<i>We will now begin today's Deathmatch.</i>

28
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,803
<i>The two high-ranking teams will survive,</i>

29
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:46,740
<i>while the lowest-ranking team</i>
<i>will be eliminated immediately.</i>

30
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:49,443
It finally feels like I'm on Elite League.

31
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:51,178
- Finally feeling nervous?
- Yeah.

32
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:53,614
This is the thrill I've been waiting for.

33
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:55,349
I have faith in us.

34
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:57,584
- Same here.
- Good.

35
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,253
I can't wait to see who'll go home.

36
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,256
I ran into Sang-yeon in the men's room,
and he looked mad.

37
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:05,258
He must be very competitive.

38
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:08,362
I bet Sang-yeon is out for blood.

39
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:14,301
"Anyone who messes with my team
will be sent home."

40
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:16,737
<i>That was my resolve going in.</i>

41
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:18,438
<i>Today's Deathmatch is...</i>

42
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,511
<i>Mystery Poker.</i>

43
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:27,848
We're playing poker?

44
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:30,183
- Poker?
- I've been dying to play poker.

45
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:31,485
You any good with poker?

46
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:33,453
- I'm pretty good.
- Really?

47
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:36,857
What's the mystery element?

48
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:39,793
Do you think
they'll be given sequence quizzes?

49
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,662
<i>For Mystery Poker,</i>

50
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:44,931
<i>you will study the submitted cards</i>
<i>and the winning hand</i>

51
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:51,004
<i>to identify the rule for victory.</i>

52
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:52,873
They won't know the rule at first?

53
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:54,841
No, their task is to deduce it.

54
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,777
We must figure out the rule.

55
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:57,678
Rules?

56
00:02:57,778 --> 00:03:00,380
It's a reasoning game.
Guys, I've got this.

57
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,050
<i>Once the game begins,</i>

58
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,986
<i>each team will receive 2 sets of 9 cards.</i>

59
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:06,987
REUSABLE AT EACH TURN

60
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:09,423
1-MINUTE DEADLINE
<i>After deciding on the order,</i>

61
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:12,159
<i>all teams will take turns</i>
<i>to submit a pair of cards.</i>

62
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:16,830
<i>Then, the host will make</i>
<i>the fourth and last submission.</i>

63
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:19,900
<i>Each round has</i>
<i>a predetermined rule for victory,</i>

64
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,169
<i>which will remain a mystery.</i>

65
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:24,504
<i>After the four submissions are made,</i>

66
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:27,040
<i>the mystery rule will be applied.</i>

67
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,510
<i>Then, the winning hand of that turn</i>
<i>will be announced.</i>

68
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:33,547
<i>As the round progresses,</i>

69
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:38,151
<i>you must deduce the rule for victory</i>
<i>from the accumulated data.</i>

70
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:43,223
<i>In the case of the example on screen,</i>
<i>the hand with the largest sum wins.</i>

71
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:45,859
Just the winner and nothing more?

72
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,394
How do we deduce the rule?

73
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:48,628
That's rough.

74
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:52,933
<i>After the winning hand is announced,</i>
<i>you will be given two minutes.</i>

75
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,470
<i>You can submit your answer</i>
<i>any time during this window.</i>

76
00:03:57,471 --> 00:04:01,007
They can use the two minutes
to deduce the correct answer,

77
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,543
or select the cards to submit
on the next turn.

78
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:09,049
<i>The submitted answers</i>
<i>will not be shared with your competitors.</i>

79
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:13,653
<i>While there is no limit</i>
<i>on the answer submissions,</i>

80
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,622
<i>a wrong answer triggers a penalty,</i>

81
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:20,560
<i>banning your team from submitting answers</i>
<i>for the next two turns.</i>

82
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:21,628
How cruel.

83
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:24,498
Just 1 turn can be critical,
but they're banned for 2 turns?

84
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,467
Whether you decide
to take a guess after the first turn

85
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:30,103
or only after the second turn
can make a world of difference.

86
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:32,305
A wrong answer costs you two submissions.

87
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:38,044
<i>Out of a total of 5 rounds,</i>
<i>the first team to win 2 rounds survives.</i>

88
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,747
<i>They will be relieved</i>
<i>from the Deathmatch immediately.</i>

89
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:43,750
<i>The remaining two teams will continue,</i>

90
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:47,687
<i>until one of them wins two rounds first</i>
<i>and secures their survival.</i>

91
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,357
Win two points first, and you're safe.

92
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:54,494
How would their strategy meetings go?
Would they brainstorm for bizarre rules?

93
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,997
The most creative team would win.

94
00:04:57,097 --> 00:05:00,600
The card selections can't get you so far
because those are shared.

95
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,135
It's all about creativity.

96
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:04,905
I hope Ji-hu's team survives.

97
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,607
- To take him down yourself?
- Of course.

98
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:09,442
I chose him as my nemesis.

99
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,678
The rules will be pretty complex.

100
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,382
We can't pinpoint the rule
simply based on one winning hand.

101
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,284
I think we've got this.

102
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,319
- It doesn't seem so daunting.
- No.

103
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:20,921
We're wiz with numbers.

104
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:24,691
<i>All teams,</i>
<i>please start discussing your strategies.</i>

105
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:28,028
<i>You'll be given 20 minutes.</i>

106
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:30,564
All right. I feel pretty good about this.

107
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:36,670
I think the cards we submit
will play an important role, Sang-yeon.

108
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:39,206
What if we get to go first early on?

109
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:41,975
Shall we hand in 1-1 in that case?

110
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:43,844
- Let's go with 1-1.
- You want 1-1?

111
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:45,745
Yes, then they can't learn anything.

112
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,515
We should think about the cards to submit

113
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:50,383
- when we go last.
- Definitely.

114
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:53,753
Which hand would give the others
as little information as possible?

115
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,422
We should check their hands first.

116
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:58,992
Let's not worry about others
getting ideas from our submission.

117
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:00,961
We'll prioritize finding answers.

118
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:04,397
- Let's submit a pair we're curious about.
- At the end of the day,

119
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:06,867
- we can get ahead if they get wrong.
- Exactly.

120
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:09,035
- If they don't, that can't be helped.
- Right.

121
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:13,340
The others might not catch on
even if we openly carried out our plan.

122
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:15,542
So we decided against limiting our options

123
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:20,013
in consideration of our competitors.

124
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:23,083
- I doubt the rounds will go on for long.
- Really?

125
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:25,218
- Will we find the rule soon?
- I think so.

126
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:29,189
I think the first few rounds
will have an easy rule.

127
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:32,459
Our best bet is to score two points
and get the heck out quickly.

128
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,527
Okay, any ideas on the rules?

129
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:36,730
- Are you ready to share?
- Give me a minute.

130
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:38,732
Simple operations?

131
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:41,067
Division? No, let's go with remainders.

132
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,869
- Hey, that could work.
- Right?

133
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:45,572
I think there's a high chance
a remainder will pop up.

134
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:48,074
What are the possibilities
apart from the four operations?

135
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:50,377
Here's an idea.

136
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:52,279
"Take the cards as a double-digit number.

137
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:55,582
Multiply the ones place by three.
Which hand has the largest result?"

138
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:57,817
That's a possibility.

139
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:01,021
Would they ask us to convert the numbers
using the binary system?

140
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,423
"How many ones does it have
after the conversion?"

141
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:08,261
- You never know, so I'll write it down.
- Please do. Let's not take any chances.

142
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:13,199
"How many primes are there
between the numbers AB and BA?"

143
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,235
COUNT THE PRIMES
BETWEEN THE NUMBERS AB AND BA

144
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:16,603
That's a possibility.

145
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:19,272
Here's my approach.

146
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:20,840
If one of them submits 1-6,

147
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:23,376
we can submit 6-1 to see
if the mirror version also wins.

148
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,445
Yes, I think that's worth trying.

149
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:27,380
It works for us
if both hands turn out to be winners.

150
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:33,520
<i>Symmetric pairs such as 1-6 and 6-1</i>

151
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:38,291
<i>may get the same results</i>
<i>depending on the rule for victory.</i>

152
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:42,395
<i>For example, if the rule for victory</i>
<i>uses multiplication of two numbers,</i>

153
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:47,667
<i>the hands 1-6 and 6-1</i>
<i>both yield an identical result of six.</i>

154
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,936
<i>Now, consider the case</i>

155
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:53,406
<i>where the rule asks you to divide</i>
<i>the first number by the second one.</i>

156
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,343
<i>The two hands</i>
<i>would then have different results.</i>

157
00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:59,346
<i>Since this is the case,</i>
<i>submitting symmetrical pairs</i>

158
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:03,717
<i>can give you an important lead</i>
<i>in identifying the rule for victory.</i>

159
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:07,287
How's this? Let's say we think
it's the number of factors.

160
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:11,858
Since we have that general idea,
we'll have our answer sheet ready.

161
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,626
Then, we can submit 7-2.

162
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:15,862
Since 72 is 2 to the third power
times 3 to the second power,

163
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:17,731
- it has a lot of factors.
- Right.

164
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,599
We can submit the most likely set to win.

165
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,369
Once we learn it won,
we can go ahead and...

166
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:24,871
We'll hit the buzzer
and submit the answer sheet.

167
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,574
Ready to crush this, guys?

168
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,042
I know I'm up for it.

169
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:32,712
The word "poker" made me uneasy,
but the rules restored my confidence.

170
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:36,216
This will be fun.
I'm pretty psyched already.

171
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:37,917
I've been waiting for a game like this.

172
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:41,388
<i>The time for strategy meeting is up.</i>

173
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:48,395
<i>It makes no sense for Team SNU Medicine</i>
<i>to be eliminated so early.</i>

174
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:52,532
<i>I was set on teaching them a lesson.</i>

175
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:54,701
This is our playground.

176
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:56,603
We'll enjoy this. It's a fun game.

177
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,338
You can say that again.

178
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:01,741
If Team SKKU goes home,
we'll be in a better position.

179
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:04,411
- They have strong players.
- Exactly.

180
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:06,312
They left an impression on Day 1.

181
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:08,782
Ji-hu even won the Ace Match.

182
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:11,518
All three teams will now throw a die.

183
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:14,587
The team with the largest number
will decide the order first.

184
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:20,593
Team SNU in Medicine
has the largest number.

185
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,196
- Shall we go last?
- Okay.

186
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:24,364
We'll go third.

187
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:26,633
Team SNU in Medicine will go third.

188
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:29,602
We'll go second.

189
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,404
Team SKKU will go second.

190
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:34,774
That leaves Team Yonsei to go first.

191
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:38,111
- It's not bad.
- We can leave the Deathmatch first, too.

192
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:41,114
Let us begin the first turn of Round 1.

193
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:42,949
- Team Yonsei will go first.
- I'll follow the plan.

194
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,951
Please show us your cards.

195
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:51,458
THEY PRESENT 1-1 AS PLANNED

196
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:54,627
Team Yonsei's hand is 1-1.

197
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:56,930
Should we make it hard for them?

198
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:59,399
We can spice things up
with two large numbers.

199
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:01,367
Two large numbers? How's 8-9?

200
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,402
I like that.

201
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,675
Team SKKU's hand is 8-9.

202
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,010
They went with 8-9 and 1-1.

203
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:13,580
Shall we try 9-8?

204
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:18,585
Team SNU in Medicine's hand is 9-8.

205
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:20,253
My hand is...

206
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:22,455
Which cards will he present?

207
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:25,425
My hand is 2-4.

208
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:30,396
I will now reveal the winning hand
based on the rule for victory.

209
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,166
I hope it's either 8-9 or 9-8.

210
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,335
<i>Here is the result of the turn.</i>

211
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:36,769
<i>The winning hand is 9-8.</i>

212
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:39,772
The bigger the better?

213
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,942
- Looks that way.
- You will now be given two minutes.

214
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:45,311
We had 8-9 and 9-8, but only 9-8 won.

215
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:47,180
- So symmetry's not involved.
- Exactly.

216
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:50,283
Try A minus B.
The one with the largest result is 9-8.

217
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,118
Guys, listen.

218
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:55,121
- A minus B may be our rule.
- Let's keep our voices low.

219
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:58,591
- Isn't it too simple, though?
- Still, keep this in mind.

220
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:00,793
They have too little to work with.

221
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,196
Yes, it's impossible
to guess at this point.

222
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:04,864
What can they do with that?

223
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:06,699
Guys, look.

224
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:10,270
THE HAND WITH THE LARGEST NUMBER
WHEN A IS DIVIDED BY B

225
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,172
Want to give it a try?

226
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:14,140
You want to submit an answer now?

227
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:15,675
What?

228
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:17,544
Let's wait for one more turn.

229
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:20,647
If we're wrong in the next turn,
we can only submit at the fifth turn.

230
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:24,083
But if our answer is wrong now,
we can submit again on the fourth turn.

231
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:27,554
Honestly, this is a pretty good guess.
Let's roll with it.

232
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:29,889
What if we get a major clue
in the next turn?

233
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:31,491
Let's still try our luck.

234
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,362
<i>Winning points early on</i>
<i>was critical in this game.</i>

235
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,731
<i>I thought it didn't make a difference</i>
<i>whether we used two turns</i>

236
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:41,768
in testing our theory
or waiting for the penalty to expire.

237
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:46,072
That's why I decided to submit an answer
when I felt it had an 80-90% shot.

238
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,474
He up and did it.

239
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,376
- What?
- He made a submission.

240
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:52,745
The game does have an element of poker

241
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:55,582
because you need a nerve of steel
to make such a move.

242
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:58,952
Okay, then. Let's wait it out
until after the third turn.

243
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:00,687
- We have so many options
- Right.

244
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:03,790
like the largest remainder
when AB is divided by nine.

245
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,425
When it is divided by 11, too.

246
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:06,359
TOO MANY POSSIBILITIES

247
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:08,928
- It's too early to tell.
- This works as well.

248
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:11,097
But a wrong answer costs them two turns.

249
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:13,866
The odds of getting a conclusive lead
during that time are slim.

250
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,236
Anyhow, he's incredibly bold.
I can't believe it.

251
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,571
Team Yonsei.

252
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:22,275
THE HAND WITH THE LARGEST NUMBER
WHEN A IS DIVIDED BY B

253
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,347
Team Yonsei.

254
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,514
That is incorrect.

255
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:34,921
For the next two turns,
you will not be able to submit an answer.

256
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:36,256
That is incorrect.

257
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:38,825
- Good.
- They can't do anything for two turns.

258
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,827
Attitude definitely matters here.

259
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:44,297
- If it had been right...
- It would've been legendary.

260
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:46,933
The two-turn penalty seems heftier
than I initially thought.

261
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,268
Totally.

262
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:50,937
It'd be better to get it right
on the first try.

263
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,172
Let us begin the second turn of Round 1.

264
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:55,475
Let's target the sum of factors.

265
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:56,709
A FACTOR DIVIDES ANOTHER NUMBER EXACTLY

266
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,545
A number with more factors
will probably give us more information.

267
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,447
- This is the sum of 72's factors.
- How's 7-2?

268
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:02,982
OPTS FOR A HAND
WITH THE LARGEST SUM OF FACTORS

269
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:06,486
Team SKKU's hand is 7-2.

270
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:07,587
SUM OF FACTORS: 195

271
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:12,992
Team SNU in Medicine's hand is 7-3.

272
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,461
All right, then.

273
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,430
Let's go with 7-1.

274
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:20,933
- No, let's complicate things a bit.
- Team Yonsei?

275
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,468
We'll go with 8-4.

276
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:27,473
Team Yonsei's hand is 8-4.

277
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:29,175
Check the factors of 84.

278
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:30,476
What's their sum?

279
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:31,678
CALCULATING THE SUM OF 84'S FACTORS

280
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:32,612
- Isn't it 224?
- Yes.

281
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:34,580
They must be thinking
along the same lines as us.

282
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,283
That totals 224,
so their hand's sum outnumbers ours.

283
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,484
BELIEVES TEAM YONSEI HAS THE SAME IDEA

284
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:41,621
My hand is 9-9.

285
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:42,789
He went with 9-9.

286
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:43,890
That's a clincher.

287
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:46,025
- Let's submit an answer if 8-4 wins.
- What's our rule?

288
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,694
The sum of AB's factors.

289
00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:49,362
<i>Here is the result of the turn.</i>

290
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:53,132
<i>The winning hand is 8-4.</i>

291
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,169
- Let's try it.
- What are we writing?

292
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,371
Hit that buzzer.

293
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,044
Team SKKU.

294
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:06,446
THE HAND WITH THE LARGEST SUM OF FACTORS

295
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,181
- That is incorrect.
- Shoot.

296
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:10,316
Still, maybe we got somewhere close.

297
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:15,922
For the next two turns,
you will not be able to submit an answer.

298
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:17,256
Let's pass this turn as well.

299
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:20,159
- Wild guesses don't get you anywhere.
- Let's not gamble.

300
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,162
I think we have to be sure of our answer.

301
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:26,366
Let us begin the third turn of Round 1.

302
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:30,103
Team SNU in Medicine's hand is 8-4.

303
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,205
How's this?

304
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:34,207
PARK SANG-YEON THOUGHT OF
A SQUARED MINUS B SQUARED

305
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:35,808
<i>This works.</i>

306
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,210
Oh, I see that.

307
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:41,948
What's going on?

308
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:44,951
- This yields the same result as 8-4.
- Okay.

309
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:48,521
Team Yonsei's hand is 7-1.

310
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:53,025
<i>If the rule is A squared minus B squared,</i>
<i>as Team Yonsei predicted,</i>

311
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:56,763
<i>Team SNU in Medicine's hand of 8-4</i>

312
00:14:56,863 --> 00:14:59,399
<i>will yield 48.</i>

313
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:02,835
<i>And Team Yonsei's hand of 7-1</i>

314
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:06,572
<i>will also yield 48.</i>

315
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:08,374
What can it be?

316
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:11,043
Let me think.

317
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,079
A squared minus B squared.

318
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:14,747
- It works.
- A squared minus B squared?

319
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:16,048
Yes, it works.

320
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:18,418
- Really?
- The difference of two squares.

321
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:19,619
This could be it.

322
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:24,524
Team SKKU's hand is 7-2.

323
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,393
My hand is 7-3.

324
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:31,798
If 8-4 and 7-1 yield the same results,
the rule is A squared minus B squared.

325
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:33,633
- When you apply it--
- Both yield 48.

326
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:35,535
- Did they go with 7-1 to confirm?
- Probably.

327
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,769
I see.

328
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:40,306
- The two new hands won't affect our test.
- No.

329
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:43,609
I hope the others won't notice
even if our theory checks out.

330
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:45,545
Especially Team SNU in Medicine.

331
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:48,581
We need to broaden our options.
What else could work?

332
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:50,249
ONLY TEAM SNU CAN SUBMIT AN ANSWER

333
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:53,252
What about the difference of two squares?

334
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:54,954
Like X squared minus Y squared.

335
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:56,589
JOO MIN-SEO THINKS OF THE SAME RULE

336
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:58,658
- The difference of two squares.
- What?

337
00:15:58,758 --> 00:16:00,159
- I said it works.
- Right?

338
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:01,828
Let's test it out first.

339
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:03,796
- I'll write it down anyway.
- Okay.

340
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:07,133
DESPITE FINDING
A PROMISING RULE FOR VICTORY

341
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,803
THE OTHER TWO TEAMS
CANNOT SUBMIT AN ANSWER

342
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:15,007
It seems joint winners
will get us big leads.

343
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:17,376
<i>Here is the result of the turn.</i>

344
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:21,314
<i>The winning hands are 8-4 and 7-1.</i>

345
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,782
TEAM SKKU CAN'T MAKE A SUBMISSION

346
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:23,816
No, stay calm.

347
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:25,618
Just a second.

348
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:28,788
Hey, wait.

349
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,024
- It's the difference of two squares.
- Lower your voices.

350
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:37,597
THE JOINT WINNING HANDS
TIPPED THE SCALE FOR TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE

351
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:41,067
They're making a submission.

352
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:47,640
I'm sure this is it.
Team Yonsei chose 7-1 just to confirm it.

353
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:50,643
What a good find.

354
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,812
Yeah, you're the best. Well done.

355
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:53,946
Stay on your toes.

356
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,815
- Oh, my heart is racing.
- You struck gold.

357
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:57,383
- Please...
- You're amazing.

358
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,252
Team SNU in Medicine.

359
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,020
THE HAND WITH THE LARGEST DIFFERENCE
OF 2 SQUARED NUMBERS

360
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:02,088
That is correct.

361
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,823
That concludes Round 1.

362
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:07,360
- Great job.
- Round 1 ends in Team SNU's victory.

363
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:10,730
We shouldn't jump the gun.

364
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:17,670
We should check joint winners
only when we can submit an answer.

365
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:19,505
It's okay.

366
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:22,808
Let's smile when we've made it through.

367
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:26,646
TEAM SKKU: 0, TEAM YONSEI: 0,
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE: 1

368
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,815
Let us begin the first turn of Round 2.

369
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:36,222
Team Yonsei's hand is 1-1.

370
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,092
Want to try 2-2?

371
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,261
- That's not a bad idea.
- All right.

372
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:47,133
I'll give it to them
if they can match with 3-3.

373
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,302
That proves that they can read the room.

374
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:56,242
Team SNU in Medicine's hand is 3-3.

375
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:00,012
- Team SNU in Medicine's hand is 3-3.
- Way to go, guys.

376
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,548
I can't wait to see the host's hand.

377
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:07,153
- He should go with 4-4. He has to.
- He will if he's tactful.

378
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:11,023
My hand is 4-4.

379
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:13,893
My hand is 4-4.

380
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,562
Vibe check, success.

381
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,032
Way to go, Mr. Host.

382
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:21,767
<i>Here is the result of the turn.</i>

383
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:23,803
<i>The winning hand is 2-2.</i>

384
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,173
Where does that leave us?

385
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:28,908
Simple operations don't work.

386
00:18:29,976 --> 00:18:32,778
What about remainders?
The rule might use it this time.

387
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,181
The smaller the remainder
when divided by seven...

388
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,350
THE HAND WITH THE SMALLEST REMAINDER
WHEN AB IS DIVIDED BY 7

389
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,818
What stands out to you?

390
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:40,620
This could be about remainders.

391
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,254
I'll work from that angle.

392
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,991
Let us begin the second turn of Round 2.

393
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:46,726
Let's go with 5-5.

394
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,962
Team SKKU's hand is 5-5.

395
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:54,533
Team SNU in Medicine's hand is 7-1.

396
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,204
Let me see. They went with 7-1 and 5-5.

397
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:01,641
Let's test our theory this time.

398
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:03,275
THE HAND WITH THE SMALLEST REMAINDER
WHEN AB IS DIVIDED BY 7

399
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:05,211
We need a multiple of seven.

400
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:06,779
A MULTIPLE OF 7 WON'T HAVE A REMAINDER

401
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:08,347
You have 30 seconds left.

402
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:11,817
Team Yonsei's hand is 1-4.

403
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,386
IF THIS HAND WINS,
TEAM YONSEI WILL SUBMIT AN ANSWER

404
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:16,856
My hand is 3-6.

405
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:20,026
<i>Here is the result of the turn.</i>
<i>The winning hand is 1-4.</i>

406
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:24,563
You're running with this?

407
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,565
Why not? We proved our theory.

408
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,534
Okay, then.

409
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:30,403
You will now be given two minutes.

410
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,838
- We agreed to do this if it checks out.
- Okay, go ahead.

411
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,207
Team Yonsei, please submit your answer.

412
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:36,876
What?

413
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:39,512
They found something just out of this?

414
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:42,014
I guess they chose 1-4 to prove something.

415
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:44,183
But what's their theory?

416
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,652
Their hand has the smallest remainder
when divided by seven.

417
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:49,955
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE FIGURED OUT
THE SAME RULE AS TEAM YONSEI

418
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:53,125
The hand with the smallest remainder
when divided by seven. Write that down.

419
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:58,497
- If their answer is wrong...
- Go for it then.

420
00:19:58,731 --> 00:19:59,899
Team Yonsei.

421
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:03,569
THE HAND WITH THE SMALLEST REMAINDER
WHEN AB IS DIVIDED BY 7

422
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:05,004
Team Yonsei.

423
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:06,238
That is incorrect.

424
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:07,606
Again?

425
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:09,975
Let's take it step by step, guys.

426
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:13,212
That is incorrect.

427
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:16,382
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE
HITS THE BUZZER RIGHT AWAY

428
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:18,551
Team SNU is being proactive

429
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:21,821
because they won a point
and would like to keep the lead.

430
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,391
But we haven't won any points,
so let's proceed with caution.

431
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,861
Team SNU. That is incorrect.

432
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:31,230
THE HAND WITH THE SMALLEST REMAINDER
WHEN AB IS DIVIDED BY 7

433
00:20:31,297 --> 00:20:33,099
We need a variety of ideas.

434
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:34,433
ONLY TEAM SKKU CAN ANSWER
FOR THE NEXT 2 TURNS

435
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:37,236
Let us begin the third turn of Round 2.

436
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:39,839
<i>Here is the result of the turn.</i>

437
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,874
<i>The winning hand is 1-4.</i>

438
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:43,943
We have 1-1 and 1-4. What's the rule?

439
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:45,478
Nothing comes to me.

440
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:48,047
Why did 1-4 win?

441
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,750
Did you try swapping the numbers?

442
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,419
I did, but we still need more
to build a theory.

443
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:57,456
- A times B is out.
- The factors won't do either, right?

444
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:01,093
Do you think swapping the numbers
will get us anywhere?

445
00:21:01,894 --> 00:21:03,262
My brain is dead.

446
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:07,867
One plus...

447
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:10,336
My mind keeps gravitating to remainders.

448
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:11,470
You know...

449
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:14,240
<i>I checked the remainders</i>
<i>when A plus B is divided by six.</i>

450
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:15,975
<i>Then, the winning hand is 1-4.</i>

451
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:18,477
<i>Well, that could work.</i>

452
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:20,980
WINNER: 1-4
REMAINDER WHEN A+B IS DIVIDED BY 6: 5

453
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,150
Let us begin the fourth turn of Round 2.

454
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,887
- Let's go with 1-1.
- We can't answer anyway.

455
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:32,158
Team Yonsei's hand is 1-1.

456
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,362
Team SKKU's hand is 8-2.

457
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:37,296
Let's go with 2-2.

458
00:21:37,363 --> 00:21:39,331
Is it the best choice for us?

459
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:41,333
It'd give them the least information.

460
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:44,804
Team SNU in Medicine's hand is 2-2.

461
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:48,841
TEAM SKKU SMILES
AFTER SEEING TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE'S HAND

462
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,243
3 MINUTES AGO
Team Yonsei went for 1-1,

463
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,478
so Team SNU would go for 2-2.

464
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:53,813
Its remainder is four.

465
00:21:53,913 --> 00:21:55,147
What has the same result?

466
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:57,650
There's 8-2. Let's use that.

467
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,251
TEAM SKKU PRESENTED 8-2 ON PURPOSE

468
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,188
Team SKKU's hand is 8-2.

469
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:04,356
If they both win, hit the buzzer.

470
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:07,459
<i>Here is the result of the turn.</i>

471
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:10,663
<i>The winning hands are 8-2 and 2-2.</i>

472
00:22:12,131 --> 00:22:15,000
- The winning hands are 8-2 and 2-2.
- Let's go.

473
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:19,205
- Let's go.
- Why did they clap just now?

474
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:20,873
Hit it.

475
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:25,277
What did they come up with?

476
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:26,946
I'm clueless.

477
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:29,748
Team SKKU.

478
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:32,818
THE HAND WITH THE LARGEST REMAINDER
WHEN A+B IS DIVIDED BY 6

479
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:34,053
That is correct.

480
00:22:36,422 --> 00:22:37,756
What's the rule?

481
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:38,858
What was it?

482
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:40,426
They did an amazing job, anyway.

483
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:43,596
- You have to give it to them.
- We couldn't have won.

484
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:45,331
- What was it?
- That concludes Round 1.

485
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:46,866
What can it be?

486
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:49,602
So what's the rule? I'm lost here.

487
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:52,004
- That was sick.
- Tae-hun.

488
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,840
I'll now reveal
the rule for victory of Round 2.

489
00:22:55,541 --> 00:23:00,145
<i>It is the hand with the largest remainder</i>
<i>when A plus B is divided by six.</i>

490
00:23:01,013 --> 00:23:03,249
- Oh, they added two numbers.
- The addition.

491
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:05,050
The sum of both numbers.

492
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,585
We can still survive.

493
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:08,687
All we need to do is win one more round.

494
00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:12,057
TEAM SNU: 1, TEAM YONSEI: 0, TEAM SKKU: 1
THE TEAM THAT WINS 2 ROUNDS FIRST SURVIVES

495
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:14,627
This might be it for Team Yonsei.

496
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,696
We can win this round
and get back on an equal footing.

497
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,865
Back to square one.

498
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,935
Let us begin the first turn of Round 3.

499
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:25,037
TEAM SKKU IS GOING FIRST

500
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,072
Let's stick with 7-2.

501
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:31,377
Team SKKU's hand is 7-2.

502
00:23:32,044 --> 00:23:34,813
Team SNU in Medicine's hand is 7-1.

503
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:37,216
- They love that pair.
- It must be their favorite.

504
00:23:37,283 --> 00:23:39,184
Our favorite is 7-2.

505
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:45,391
Team Yonsei's hand is 1-7.

506
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:48,127
They're checking if symmetry is involved.

507
00:23:48,961 --> 00:23:51,063
My hand is 2-7.

508
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,565
We'll get a mother lode of information.

509
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:56,402
- Everyone will be ready for that.
- Two mirror images.

510
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:00,372
Here is the result of the turn.

511
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:04,043
<i>The winning hands are 7-2 and 2-7.</i>

512
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,414
Symmetry is definitely involved.
Let's get to work.

513
00:24:09,415 --> 00:24:11,450
We still need to tread carefully.

514
00:24:11,517 --> 00:24:15,988
Let's wait for the next turn's result,
analyze it, and then make a submission.

515
00:24:16,088 --> 00:24:19,124
We'll have to pour our everything
into this round.

516
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:20,859
We're going all-in.

517
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:28,767
Let us begin the second turn of Round 3.

518
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:33,238
TEAM YONSEI: 6-6, TEAM SKKU: 9-4,
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE: 1-1

519
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:35,541
My hand is 9-9.

520
00:24:36,075 --> 00:24:37,609
<i>Here is the result of the turn.</i>

521
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:39,611
<i>The winning hand is 9-4.</i>

522
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:41,180
What can this be?

523
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:43,282
The bigger, the better, right?

524
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:45,517
How come 9-9 didn't win?

525
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:51,857
Let us begin the third turn of Round 3.

526
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:56,428
<i>Here is the result of the turn.</i>
<i>The winning hands are 5-9 and 9-5.</i>

527
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:03,669
No, not that one.

528
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:06,638
The least common multiple?

529
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,374
The least common multiple.

530
00:25:08,474 --> 00:25:10,209
THE SMALLEST COMMON MULTIPLE OF 2 NUMBERS

531
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:11,343
You have one minute left.

532
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:14,313
- That works. The LCM can be it.
- What about this one?

533
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:17,116
Yeah, you're right. It fits our data.

534
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,917
We'll need to choose our hand well.

535
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:21,820
Yes, let's consider our hand carefully.

536
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:26,158
<i>All the winning hands had a larger result</i>
<i>when the two numbers were multiplied.</i>

537
00:25:26,225 --> 00:25:29,028
WINNING HANDS OF THE 1ST TURN IN ROUND 3

538
00:25:29,228 --> 00:25:31,063
<i>The host's hand was 9-9.</i>

539
00:25:31,163 --> 00:25:32,931
<i>There were also 9-4 and 6-6.</i>

540
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:36,568
<i>I was rather confused</i>
<i>when 9-4 was declared the winning hand.</i>

541
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:40,005
<i>I assumed 9-9 would win,</i>
<i>so I tried to find out why 9-4 won.</i>

542
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:43,709
I noticed that the pair
with the same numbers didn't win.

543
00:25:43,776 --> 00:25:44,843
<i>So...</i>

544
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,845
6 TIMES 6 AND 9 TIMES 4
HAVE THE SAME PRODUCT

545
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:48,914
BUT ONLY 9-4 WAS SELECTED
AS THE WINNING HAND

546
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:52,217
That's when I was convinced
that the rule was based on the LCM.

547
00:25:54,253 --> 00:25:55,587
Did we check the LCM?

548
00:25:55,788 --> 00:25:56,755
What? Hang on.

549
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:58,624
- Wait, does this...
- It fits with all the data.

550
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:01,560
- I think this is it.
- Let's wait for one more turn.

551
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,796
Our only viable option is the LCM.

552
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,764
They wrote down something.

553
00:26:06,632 --> 00:26:07,966
Team SKKU has an answer.

554
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:09,735
What now?

555
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:12,171
We have to submit our answer
the moment our theory checks out.

556
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,373
Looks like they're ready for a submission.

557
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,743
Team Yonsei has put their answer
in the envelope.

558
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:20,946
Let us begin the fourth turn of Round 3.

559
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:24,616
Team SNU in Medicine's hand is 2-8.

560
00:26:25,217 --> 00:26:27,920
- The LCM for that is eight.
- Chung-seo.

561
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:30,823
Can we swap places?

562
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:33,358
Team Yonsei, please show us your hand.

563
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:36,995
- Let's opt for a pair with a large LCM.
- How's 8-9?

564
00:26:37,663 --> 00:26:39,998
- How about 8-7?
- Let's go with that.

565
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,435
Team Yonsei's hand is 8-7.

566
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:44,636
THEIR LCM IS 56

567
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:49,208
- Instead of going for bigger numbers--
- Try something with a smaller LCM.

568
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:50,576
All right.

569
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,978
- How's 8-6?
- Let's go with 8-6.

570
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:53,946
Okay.

571
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,683
THEIR LCM IS 24
Team SKKU's hand is 8-6.

572
00:26:57,983 --> 00:27:00,586
My hand is 7-5.

573
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:02,654
My hand is 7-5.

574
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:05,824
Hit the buzzer if 8-7 wins.
Keep your hand on it.

575
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:07,826
LEAST COMMON MULTIPLE OF EACH HAND

576
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:11,497
I will now reveal the winning hand
based on the rule for victory.

577
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:13,298
Here is the result of the turn.

578
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,971
<i>The winning hand is 8-7.</i>

579
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:20,439
<i>The winning hand is 8-7.</i>

580
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:22,841
<i>The winning hand is 8-7.</i>

581
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:30,415
Team Yonsei, please submit your answer.

582
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,017
I should've pushed it quicker.

583
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:33,352
Let's wait. It's okay.

584
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:34,786
Oh, please...

585
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:36,588
- I'm sure it's right.
- Please...

586
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,891
- Our odds are good.
- Just this once.

587
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:40,292
Let's all pray.

588
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:41,727
- Come on, Chung-seo.
- Christian faith.

589
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:44,029
Oh, please. We're a Christian school.

590
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:45,697
Round 3.

591
00:27:46,198 --> 00:27:47,499
Team Yonsei.

592
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:48,800
THE HAND WITH THE LARGEST
LEAST COMMON MULTIPLE

593
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:49,735
"That is correct."

594
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:51,003
Team Yonsei.

595
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:53,038
That is correct.

596
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,707
You're overdoing it.

597
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:57,209
That concludes Round 3.

598
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:00,312
- Round 3 ends in Team Yonsei's victory.
- Thank goodness.

599
00:28:00,546 --> 00:28:03,048
- That was a narrow escape.
- Let's go.

600
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:05,083
Okay, we've got this.

601
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:07,085
We have a tie now.

602
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:13,091
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE: 1,
TEAM YONSEI: 1, TEAM SKKU: 1

603
00:28:15,394 --> 00:28:16,995
Don't worry about it.

604
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:18,564
We can win the next round.

605
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,735
- That never occurred to us.
- The LCM?

606
00:28:25,504 --> 00:28:27,239
Why didn't I think of that?

607
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:30,108
That never came to mind.

608
00:28:31,343 --> 00:28:33,845
Okay, I'm getting the hang of it.

609
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,084
High five, Chung-seo.

610
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:41,220
Let's focus.

611
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:46,558
It's neck and neck.

612
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:48,727
One point each? Oh, man.

613
00:28:48,794 --> 00:28:50,696
Each team has one point.

614
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:52,798
- We fight to the death now.
- For sure.

615
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:54,600
- Damn.
- Let's get that point.

616
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,501
This is it. Focus for Round 4.

617
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,870
- We're wrapping things up here.
- Okay.

618
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:03,375
Let us begin the first turn of Round 4.

619
00:29:04,276 --> 00:29:06,778
Good. Let's start it off with 1-1.

620
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:09,348
Team Yonsei's hand is 1-1.

621
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:11,984
- Want to go with 7-2?
- Okay.

622
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:13,252
To keep them in check.

623
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:16,688
Team SKKU's hand is 7-2.

624
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:18,824
- How about 2-7?
- You want 2-7?

625
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:23,729
Team SNU in Medicine's hand is 2-7.

626
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,698
My hand is 3-7.

627
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:30,002
Here is the result of the turn.

628
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:31,570
<i>The winning hand is 3-7.</i>

629
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:35,374
What's this about?

630
00:29:36,008 --> 00:29:37,776
I have zero clue.

631
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:42,648
We need to come up
with good ideas quickly.

632
00:29:43,015 --> 00:29:45,117
- Keep it calm, but...
- Calm and quick.

633
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:48,086
Exactly. We need to be calm and quick.

634
00:29:48,487 --> 00:29:50,188
Let us begin the second turn of Round 4.

635
00:29:50,656 --> 00:29:52,324
<i>Here is the result of the turn.</i>

636
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:53,959
<i>The winning hand is 4-9.</i>

637
00:29:54,593 --> 00:29:57,663
The hand with the largest number
when AB is swapped.

638
00:29:57,763 --> 00:30:00,432
It might be the hand with the largest
number when AB is swapped.

639
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:03,502
We could get a rule
about swapping numbers.

640
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:06,471
Let us begin the third turn of Round 4.

641
00:30:06,838 --> 00:30:09,574
Team SKKU's hand is 2-4.

642
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:12,144
Team SNU in Medicine's hand is 1-2.

643
00:30:12,511 --> 00:30:15,814
Why don't we try this
to keep the others in the dark?

644
00:30:16,882 --> 00:30:18,483
Are we testing the number swap theory?

645
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:19,951
- Yes.
- Got it.

646
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,854
Team Yonsei's hand is 3-8.

647
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:26,024
My hand is 5-5.

648
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:27,793
Here is the result of the turn.

649
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:29,761
The winning hand is 3-8.

650
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:30,796
See?

651
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,432
- All this can't be a simple coincidence.
- No.

652
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:34,866
You think this can be it?

653
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:37,669
Let's submit it.
You do the honors, Chung-seo.

654
00:30:37,903 --> 00:30:39,304
- I'll hit it.
- Yes, and go deliver it.

655
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:43,041
They must've found something.

656
00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:46,845
It's time to pray again.

657
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:51,149
Please let us survive this.
I don't want to go home yet.

658
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:54,353
Team Yonsei.

659
00:30:54,453 --> 00:30:57,322
THE HAND WITH THE LARGEST NUMBER
WHEN TWO NUMBERS ARE SWAPPED

660
00:30:57,389 --> 00:30:58,724
That is incorrect.

661
00:30:58,824 --> 00:31:00,926
This won't take so long.

662
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:06,865
For the next two turns,
you will not be able to submit an answer.

663
00:31:06,932 --> 00:31:09,735
- How was it not the answer? What a shame.
- What is it, then?

664
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:13,038
What a relief.

665
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,843
Let's hurry, guys.
Run the numbers quickly.

666
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:19,111
One thing is for sure.

667
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:21,747
The second number
must be larger than the first one.

668
00:31:23,515 --> 00:31:26,518
Let's see.
The second number does matter, but...

669
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:28,720
For what, exactly?

670
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:31,757
The rule might be
a slight variation of our answer

671
00:31:31,857 --> 00:31:33,959
that centers around B being larger than A.

672
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,262
- You have a point.
- Sounds plausible.

673
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:40,732
It must have something to do
with the second number being larger.

674
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:47,939
Well, how's this?

675
00:31:49,141 --> 00:31:51,209
Oh, that's a good idea.

676
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:53,678
<i>How's this?</i>

677
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,581
<i>It's not so random, so this can be it.</i>

678
00:31:58,316 --> 00:31:59,751
Did you apply it to all the samples?

679
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:00,952
It checked out so far.

680
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:02,220
- All of them?
- Yes.

681
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:05,624
Let's test it first.
We can go for it if our hand wins.

682
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:08,693
Let us begin the fourth turn of Round 4.

683
00:32:08,994 --> 00:32:11,930
Team SNU in Medicine's hand is 9-2.

684
00:32:12,631 --> 00:32:14,966
Team Yonsei's hand is 1-2.

685
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:18,937
Team SKKU's hand is 2-6.

686
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:21,907
My hand is 9-3.

687
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:26,445
TEAM SKKU PLANS TO SUBMIT AN ANSWER
IF 2-6 IS THE WINNING HAND

688
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:27,345
Come on.

689
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:28,980
Here is the result of the turn.

690
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:36,621
The winning hand is 2-6.

691
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:39,825
This is it, right?

692
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:43,295
Wait, I'm getting weak.

693
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:45,030
Do we scream out loud if we win?

694
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,832
But won't the other teams mind?

695
00:32:46,932 --> 00:32:48,767
We didn't even do a chant.

696
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:50,268
Let's just punch in the air.

697
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:53,038
- Yelling is just too much.
- That's true.

698
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:00,745
Please get it wrong.

699
00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:02,747
Team SKKU.

700
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,783
THE HAND WITH THE LARGEST RESULT
WHEN A+B IS MULTIPLIED BY B

701
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,151
That is correct.

702
00:33:09,588 --> 00:33:10,789
Seriously...

703
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:12,524
Well done, you.

704
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,799
Team SKKU, safe.

705
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:22,868
Jeez, this is driving me nuts.

706
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:25,604
- I can't even guess the rule.
- What a bummer.

707
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:33,078
It's okay. Let's get Team SNU eliminated.

708
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:36,681
<i>Team SKKU won two rounds first</i>

709
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:39,784
<i>and secured their survival</i>
<i>from the Deathmatch.</i>

710
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:42,020
<i>Please return to your base camp.</i>

711
00:33:42,087 --> 00:33:43,788
- Let's go.
- Let's tidy up a bit.

712
00:33:45,257 --> 00:33:46,191
Good luck.

713
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:49,094
You've got this.

714
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:51,096
- The winner gets to be our ally.
- You bet.

715
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:52,697
They'll actually be our ally tomorrow.

716
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:53,798
You're right.

717
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:57,002
- Let's relax and enjoy the match.
- I'll sleep like a baby tonight.

718
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:59,638
- You were all amazing.
- Come here, guys.

719
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:02,107
I'm stoked!

720
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:03,742
Seriously, guys...

721
00:34:03,842 --> 00:34:04,910
I love it.

722
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,344
We did great.

723
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:09,915
I was really relieved
that we didn't get eliminated.

724
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:14,119
<i>I even teared up a bit</i>
<i>because I felt so happy.</i>

725
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:15,854
<i>That boosted my confidence again.</i>

726
00:34:15,921 --> 00:34:18,089
<i>Basically, we defeated</i>
<i>the others in our division.</i>

727
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:23,862
I think we proved that Team SKKU
has a place in Elite League Season 3.

728
00:34:24,763 --> 00:34:27,532
<i>Deathmatch, Mystery Poker.</i>

729
00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:31,136
<i>Team SNU in Medicine and Team Yonsei</i>

730
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:33,004
<i>will continue with the game.</i>

731
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:37,776
<i>Both teams will take turns</i>
<i>to present a pair of cards twice.</i>

732
00:34:37,876 --> 00:34:41,313
<i>In total,</i>
<i>we will have four hands of cards.</i>

733
00:34:42,047 --> 00:34:46,384
<i>As Team SNU in Medicine</i>
<i>and Team Yonsei are tied,</i>

734
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:49,888
<i>the team that identifies</i>
<i>the rule for victory in this round</i>

735
00:34:49,955 --> 00:34:52,791
<i>will secure their survival</i>
<i>from the Deathmatch.</i>

736
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:58,163
I can't believe Team SNU or Team Yonsei
will get eliminated just like that.

737
00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:02,400
It's mind-boggling to think
one of them is going home.

738
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:04,402
- We've got this.
- Good luck, guys.

739
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:06,705
- We can do this.
- Of course.

740
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:11,643
- The key is to broaden our perspectives.
- Let's be flexible.

741
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,645
<i>No offense to Team Yonsei,</i>

742
00:35:13,745 --> 00:35:17,282
<i>but we are determined to survive,</i>
<i>no matter what.</i>

743
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:20,318
Remember. Let's not lose our cool.

744
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:23,588
Let's focus, guys.

745
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:28,660
<i>Team SNU in Medicine had no luck</i>
<i>after winning Round 1.</i>

746
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,896
<i>So I felt sure our chances were good.</i>
<i>I was ready to take them.</i>

747
00:35:32,097 --> 00:35:34,499
Let us begin the first turn of Round 5.

748
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:38,169
Let's go with 9-6.

749
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:43,475
Team Yonsei's hand is 9-6.

750
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:48,446
Team SNU in Medicine's hand is 4-4.

751
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:53,551
Team Yonsei's hand is 6-4.

752
00:35:54,686 --> 00:35:57,489
Team SNU in Medicine's hand is 6-3.

753
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,659
<i>Here is the result of the turn.</i>

754
00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:02,494
<i>The winning hand is 9-6.</i>

755
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:06,331
Our takeaway for now is,
the bigger the X, the higher the rank.

756
00:36:06,398 --> 00:36:09,634
Let's stay open-minded,
but the first number should be large.

757
00:36:09,701 --> 00:36:11,970
Are we going to check the factors?

758
00:36:12,037 --> 00:36:14,105
Does that rule check out?
Keep working on it.

759
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,306
CHUNG-SEO'S GUESS: NUMBER OF FACTORS

760
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:18,476
Let us begin the second turn of Round 5.

761
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,246
What should we present?

762
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:24,115
- Just large numbers?
- Let's go in that direction.

763
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:27,719
If we get an exception,
we can learn something from it.

764
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:34,059
Team SNU in Medicine's hand is 9-6.

765
00:36:34,793 --> 00:36:36,695
I'll go with 2-7.

766
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:42,701
Team Yonsei's hand is 2-7.

767
00:36:43,168 --> 00:36:45,503
They're avoiding bigger numbers.

768
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:49,207
Would it be a bad choice to try 7-2?

769
00:36:49,274 --> 00:36:52,544
As in their mirror image?
But we don't have to do that for them.

770
00:36:53,912 --> 00:36:56,047
I think 2-8 is a pretty good choice.

771
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:57,449
- Come again?
- I said 2-8.

772
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:58,983
- Shall we use that?
- Okay.

773
00:36:59,284 --> 00:37:02,353
Team SNU in Medicine's hand is 2-8.

774
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,724
Team Yonsei's hand is 4-3.

775
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,860
<i>Here is the result of the turn.</i>

776
00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:10,562
<i>The winning hand is 9-6.</i>

777
00:37:11,863 --> 00:37:14,199
Want to check the number of factors?

778
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:17,035
How about a hand
with the same number of factors as theirs?

779
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:20,472
I'm going to check the number of factors,
plain and simple.

780
00:37:21,773 --> 00:37:23,174
- Does it work?
- Well, yes.

781
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,776
Okay, test your theory.

782
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:30,582
BOTH TEAMS ARE CONSIDERING
THE SAME RULE FOR VICTORY

783
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:33,218
Let us begin the third turn of Round 5.

784
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,756
Team Yonsei's hand is 4-5.

785
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,059
Why does she have a hand on the buzzer?

786
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:46,030
I guess it's out of habit.

787
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:51,136
Team SNU in Medicine's hand is 7-4.

788
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:56,207
Team Yonsei's hand is 3-7.

789
00:37:56,508 --> 00:37:57,909
How's 7-5?

790
00:37:58,877 --> 00:37:59,878
What, 7-5?

791
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:03,081
- To aim for joint winners?
- Not bad.

792
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:07,519
Team SNU in Medicine's hand is 7-5.

793
00:38:07,819 --> 00:38:09,621
- Doesn't 45 have 6 factors?
- Yes.

794
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:11,689
- What did they put up?
- They went with 7-4.

795
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,925
- Six and three...
- Three squared...

796
00:38:13,992 --> 00:38:16,761
Wait, 75 has 6 factors, too.
Should we wait?

797
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:20,265
I will now reveal the winning hand
based on the rule for victory.

798
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:24,135
<i>The winning hands are 4-5 and 7-5.</i>

799
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:28,940
That's a big clue.

800
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:32,110
- Do we try our luck?
- Should we?

801
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,312
- Go or no?
- Do we go for it or not?

802
00:38:34,379 --> 00:38:35,613
- Do it. In the end...
- Okay.

803
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,515
Go for it. But don't share anything.

804
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:41,853
No, I'm sure they got it wrong.

805
00:38:44,389 --> 00:38:46,825
<i>I desperately hoped</i>
<i>their answer would be wrong.</i>

806
00:38:48,092 --> 00:38:49,994
Please be correct.

807
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:52,130
Whichever way I look at it,
this is the only answer.

808
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:54,732
Team SNU.

809
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:57,802
THE HAND WITH THE MOST NUMBER OF FACTORS

810
00:38:57,869 --> 00:38:58,937
Please...

811
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:01,806
That is correct.

812
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:05,510
Great job.

813
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,181
- Good work.
- Well done.

814
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:12,317
- Thanks, guys.
- Good job.

815
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:13,418
Great work.

816
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:17,055
The round ends
in Team SNU in Medicine's victory.

817
00:39:17,155 --> 00:39:18,389
You were amazing.

818
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:19,657
Great job.

819
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:46,618
Team Yonsei got eliminated.

820
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:48,353
Team Yonsei...

821
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:52,023
You know, I thought they were formidable.

822
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:02,567
<i>First and foremost,</i>
<i>I felt terrible for my teammates.</i>

823
00:40:02,634 --> 00:40:03,534
<i>To be honest...</i>

824
00:40:04,002 --> 00:40:08,039
In my haste to submit an answer
in the earlier rounds,

825
00:40:08,106 --> 00:40:11,376
I hurt the team with the penalty.

826
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:14,212
I don't think
I was receptive enough to them.

827
00:40:14,279 --> 00:40:17,749
That leaves me with regret
and a sense of shame.

828
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:41,973
<i>We let Team SNU in Medicine take Round 1</i>
<i>when we also had the answer ready.</i>

829
00:40:42,073 --> 00:40:43,908
<i>We could've survived...</i>

830
00:40:43,975 --> 00:40:46,811
<i>I felt terrible for my skilled teammates.</i>

831
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:56,087
<i>I was heartbroken.</i>

832
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:06,864
It's okay.

833
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:10,935
What do you mean we're going home?
That makes no sense.

834
00:41:12,337 --> 00:41:14,439
We're losing out big time.

835
00:41:14,505 --> 00:41:17,008
Think about all the fun games
they'll get to play.

836
00:41:17,108 --> 00:41:18,609
I feel you there.

837
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:21,279
- We won't get to try them.
- No.

838
00:41:22,013 --> 00:41:24,449
I had so much fun here.

839
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:26,284
To think it ends today...

840
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:31,456
We still did great.

841
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:40,865
<i>The second team to be eliminated</i>
<i>from Elite League Season 3 is</i>

842
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:43,001
<i>Team Yonsei.</i>

843
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:48,973
We have done so well so far.

844
00:41:49,207 --> 00:41:51,109
It's okay.

845
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,044
- We placed fifth?
- It's okay.

846
00:41:53,578 --> 00:41:55,046
That in itself is historic.

847
00:41:55,146 --> 00:41:56,314
It's all my fault.

848
00:41:58,116 --> 00:41:59,884
Seeing them like this
is just as upsetting.

849
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:02,487
Facing them like this
makes my heart heavy.

850
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:05,723
How could Team Yonsei go home so soon?

851
00:42:06,391 --> 00:42:07,825
This is incredible.

852
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:11,562
<i>Team Yonsei, please exit the grounds.</i>

853
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,131
Let's go.

854
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:19,504
Great work, everyone.

855
00:42:20,171 --> 00:42:22,473
We'll get going.

856
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,342
- Good work.
- Well done.

857
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:29,080
We became close
in that little time we had together.

858
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,681
I feel conflicted.

859
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:39,590
Our team is bound to be the best.

860
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:42,360
We should consider that, too. Earlier...

861
00:42:42,427 --> 00:42:44,328
<i>I think I was too assertive.</i>

862
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:47,198
I should've been open to your input.

863
00:42:47,265 --> 00:42:49,734
Why did I have to be so headstrong?

864
00:42:51,169 --> 00:42:54,105
I wasn't ready to listen to others
when I should have been all ears.

865
00:42:54,205 --> 00:42:57,108
My sincerest apologies.

866
00:42:57,208 --> 00:42:59,544
<i>We were on our path</i>
<i>to achieve a higher goal</i>

867
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:02,814
<i>while resolving our differences.</i>

868
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:06,951
<i>It's unfortunate</i>
<i>that our journey ended so soon.</i>

869
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:10,254
I was happy to compete
with brilliant friends by my side.

870
00:43:10,822 --> 00:43:12,423
That looks like fun.

871
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:15,126
Isn't it fun?

872
00:43:15,526 --> 00:43:20,198
<i>Sang-yeon, Yun-beom, and A-in</i>
<i>all worked together with me for the games.</i>

873
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,100
<i>I'd like to thank them for everything.</i>

874
00:43:23,468 --> 00:43:27,205
When we first met, I was struck
by how competent everyone seemed.

875
00:43:27,405 --> 00:43:29,474
Hey, we've got all the top students.

876
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:31,275
I placed second in the pre-test.

877
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:32,944
<i>I thought we could place high</i>

878
00:43:33,544 --> 00:43:36,948
or even win just as I badly wanted to,

879
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:39,584
<i>but we ended up losing by a tiny margin.</i>

880
00:43:40,818 --> 00:43:42,820
I'm very sad it had to end like this.

881
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:45,556
Okay, I'm getting the hang of it.

882
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,658
<i>We still did our best,</i>

883
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:51,963
<i>and I know that the others</i>
<i>gave their all just as we did.</i>

884
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:55,666
I'm not going to look back
on our journey with only regret.

885
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:21,058
- It's another exciting day.
- It feels strange.

886
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:23,027
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

887
00:44:23,528 --> 00:44:25,496
Our division is more energetic.

888
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:28,065
The medical teams
fought to the death just yesterday.

889
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:30,501
They got all excited
when another team made a mistake.

890
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:31,802
Right, that's true.

891
00:44:33,204 --> 00:44:34,071
Hilarious.

892
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,307
We never argued with Team KAIST.

893
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:38,609
We're back.

894
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:42,680
It feels like home. Hi, we're back.

895
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,815
I've grown attached.

896
00:44:44,882 --> 00:44:47,752
TEAM KAIST'S BASE CAMP

897
00:44:48,219 --> 00:44:50,655
DANCING MACHINE

898
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:53,991
- Let's copy her moves.
- She's relaxed enough to dance here.

899
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:57,662
Look at Dong-geon.

900
00:44:57,728 --> 00:45:00,364
You look like a total brainiac today.

901
00:45:00,565 --> 00:45:01,866
I know. I look unreal.

902
00:45:01,933 --> 00:45:03,234
It's almost incredible.

903
00:45:03,334 --> 00:45:05,536
With my hair parted
and with the glasses...

904
00:45:05,636 --> 00:45:07,672
I'm like the epitome of SNU students.

905
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:09,207
I mean, you look really good.

906
00:45:09,307 --> 00:45:10,474
They say smart is the new sexy.

907
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,009
SELF-ACCLAIMED SMART AND SEXY

908
00:45:12,243 --> 00:45:14,011
- Yum-yum.
- We got some quail eggs.

909
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:15,179
TEAM SKKU'S BASE CAMP

910
00:45:17,348 --> 00:45:19,116
These are so good.

911
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:32,196
A DEEP SIGH

912
00:45:32,263 --> 00:45:35,399
- What's the matter?
- The caffeine's traveling down my veins.

913
00:45:35,499 --> 00:45:37,969
- Did it feel electrifying?
- Yeah, it's insane.

914
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,940
<i>Brainpower survival challenge,</i>
<i>Elite League Season 3.</i>

915
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:45,610
<i>The surviving teams are as follows.</i>

916
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:46,877
Just four.

917
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:50,147
<i>In Medical Division,</i>
<i>Team SNU in Medicine and Team SKKU.</i>

918
00:45:52,116 --> 00:45:54,719
TEAM SKKU

919
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:57,521
- She moved on so quickly.
- I know.

920
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,624
We meant to whoop
after "Team SNU in Medicine."

921
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:03,794
<i>In STEM Division,</i>
<i>Team SNU in STEM and Team KAIST.</i>

922
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:07,064
It's 2-against-2.

923
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:09,700
Let's do our best today.

924
00:46:11,736 --> 00:46:14,605
Feels like STEM Division
is better than Medical Division.

925
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:16,307
In yesterday's main match,

926
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:18,142
we just flattened them.

927
00:46:18,242 --> 00:46:19,977
The stat difference was unbelievable.

928
00:46:20,077 --> 00:46:22,647
Let's win again and avoid the Deathmatch.

929
00:46:22,747 --> 00:46:24,982
- I badly want that, too.
- Oh, please...

930
00:46:25,082 --> 00:46:26,651
If we can make it through the day...

931
00:46:26,751 --> 00:46:29,620
I've said that tons of times already.
Anyway, it will feel amazing.

932
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:33,157
We can just keep that mindset every day.

933
00:46:33,257 --> 00:46:35,860
Focus on survival every day,
and we'll be at the finals.

934
00:46:36,661 --> 00:46:40,731
Don't you think we'll have
a full-scale Ace Selection today?

935
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:43,834
Because we have fewer people?
We have only eight on each side.

936
00:46:43,934 --> 00:46:45,836
Isn't it about time
they test our memorization?

937
00:46:45,936 --> 00:46:48,973
You have a point.
We haven't had a memorization game yet.

938
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,509
Today's plan. Jong-yun will win
the memorization game as our Ace player.

939
00:46:51,609 --> 00:46:52,643
Then, we win the main match.

940
00:46:53,411 --> 00:46:54,345
Nice and neat.

941
00:46:56,314 --> 00:46:59,216
My gut tells me we'll skip the Ace Match
and do something else.

942
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:02,620
We could go right into the main match.

943
00:47:02,687 --> 00:47:03,754
That's possible.

944
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:05,823
Yeah, it's just 2-against-2 now.

945
00:47:07,058 --> 00:47:10,795
<i>Brainpower survival challenge,</i>
<i>Elite League Season 3.</i>

946
00:47:11,595 --> 00:47:12,863
<i>Starting from today,</i>

947
00:47:14,298 --> 00:47:18,502
<i>there will be</i>
<i>no Ace Selection or Ace Match.</i>

948
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:21,906
Oh, no.

949
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,809
<i>We will play</i>
<i>the day's main match right away.</i>

950
00:47:26,711 --> 00:47:27,845
I didn't see this coming.

951
00:47:27,912 --> 00:47:30,448
Way to make us nervous from the start.

952
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,083
Yeah, we got no warning at all.

953
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:34,185
The main match directly?
Man, I'll need to focus.

954
00:47:34,251 --> 00:47:36,821
No Ace Match to wake your brain up.

955
00:47:37,154 --> 00:47:38,856
Let's dive into the main match!

956
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:40,624
Does that mean there's no benefit?

957
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:43,861
- I think so. Just fair and square.
- No additional setups?

958
00:47:43,928 --> 00:47:45,463
It's for the better.

959
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:48,099
How will they manage without the benefit?

960
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:49,033
Poor guys.

961
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:50,468
Tell me about it.

962
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:53,904
I love it. We have a nice diversity here.

963
00:47:54,004 --> 00:47:57,908
Whatever the creators throw at us,
we're less likely to be overwhelmed.

964
00:47:58,175 --> 00:48:00,711
<i>All contestants,</i>
<i>please gather at the main hall</i>

965
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:02,913
<i>- for the main match.</i>
- For the main match.

966
00:48:03,948 --> 00:48:05,249
Let's go!

967
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:06,183
Good luck.

968
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:07,852
- Let's go.
- All right.

969
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:15,926
Another day begins.

970
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:20,030
<i>I wanted to do well in the main match.</i>

971
00:48:20,097 --> 00:48:21,932
<i>My goal was to avoid the Deathmatch again.</i>

972
00:48:23,501 --> 00:48:24,702
Let's do our best.

973
00:48:24,769 --> 00:48:25,603
Good luck.

974
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:28,973
<i>The finals will be</i>
<i>our one and only Deathmatch.</i>

975
00:48:29,774 --> 00:48:31,242
<i>Now that I've experienced the Deathmatch,</i>

976
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:34,879
<i>I know about the stress</i>
<i>and the pressure we have to endure.</i>

977
00:48:34,945 --> 00:48:36,680
<i>We'll make sure that Medical Division...</i>

978
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,516
<i>We'll win, no matter what.</i>

979
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:41,752
- I wonder what the game is.
- I can't wait to find out.

980
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:43,053
I'm dying to know.

981
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:45,122
<i>Today's main match is...</i>

982
00:48:45,423 --> 00:48:46,757
Just like that?

983
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:51,328
<i>...Signal Investigation 3.</i>

984
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:56,000

985
00:48:57,334 --> 00:48:58,869
BEFORE THE MAIN MATCH
What will it be?

986
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:01,172
- We might get Signal Investigation.
- Definitely.

987
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:03,307
- Signal Investigation 3.
- Signal Investigation 3.

988
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:06,010
My amazing deduction skills.

989
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:09,547
With a top-class skill like this,
I'd say we won already.

990
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,482
Wow, this should be good.

991
00:49:11,582 --> 00:49:14,952
- Not bad. It's not a memorization game.
- We need to see what it's about.

992
00:49:15,019 --> 00:49:17,588
- That's true.
- The setup can change everything.

993
00:49:17,655 --> 00:49:20,558
Signal Investigation in Season 1
and Season 2 were nothing alike.

994
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:22,460
<i>In Signal Investigation 3,</i>

995
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,029
<i>you will have to examine</i>
<i>the sentences and the photos</i>

996
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:27,031
<i>to identify the culprit.</i>

997
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:29,967
<i>There will be a total of two rounds.</i>

998
00:49:30,034 --> 00:49:31,202
<i>In Round 1,</i>

999
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:33,938
<i>you will be presented with cards</i>
<i>that have parts of one sentence.</i>

1000
00:49:34,004 --> 00:49:36,674
<i>There will be 2 sets of 55 cards.</i>

1001
00:49:36,774 --> 00:49:40,444
<i>In other words,</i>
<i>you will receive a total of 110 cards.</i>

1002
00:49:40,511 --> 00:49:43,948
<i>Please note that the numbers on the cards</i>
<i>are in a random sequence.</i>

1003
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:50,020
<i>During Round 1,</i>
<i>you must make sense of the 55 sentences</i>

1004

<i>to deduce the eight suspects' professions.</i>

1005
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:56,794
<i>The team that succeeds in identifying</i>
<i>all suspects' professions</i>

1006
00:49:56,861 --> 00:50:01,398
<i>can immediately start their task</i>
<i>for Round 2 and find the culprit.</i>

<i>From that point,</i>

1008
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:08,539
<i>all teams must complete their tasks</i>
<i>in 1 hour and 30 minutes.</i>

1009
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:11,208
There's a time limit.

1010
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:16,780
<i>Teams that go into Round 2</i>
<i>will be given a code to the safe.</i>

1011

<i>from the security camera</i>

1012
00:50:20,551 --> 00:50:26,190
<i>and 9 photos of the persons of interest,</i>
<i>including 8 suspects and 1 victim.</i>

1013
00:50:26,257 --> 00:50:31,529
<i>The four teams must combine the clues</i>
<i>gathered from the photos and the sentences</i>

1014
00:50:31,629 --> 00:50:33,664
<i>to identify the culprit.</i>

1015
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:35,833
<i>When the game ends,</i>

1016
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:40,204
<i>the time each teams took to apprehend</i>
<i>the culprit will be added by division.</i>

1017
00:50:40,271 --> 00:50:43,641
<i>The division that apprehended the culprit</i>
<i>in less time will survive,</i>

1018
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:47,177
<i>while the losing division</i>
<i>will compete in a Deathmatch right away.</i>

1019
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:49,880
- Everyone has to pull their weight.
- Yes.

1020
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:52,983
<i>Please start discussing your strategies.</i>

1021
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:55,986
<i>You'll be given 20 minutes.</i>

1022
00:50:57,187 --> 00:51:00,824
First, the basic information.
We need to find the eight professions.

1023
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:03,193
Yes, we need to quickly find
what they are.

1024
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:06,564
Let's look for phrases linked to jobs.

1025
00:51:06,664 --> 00:51:07,765
Yes, the related phrases.

1026
00:51:07,865 --> 00:51:09,900
<i>For instance, keywords about a magician</i>

1027
00:51:10,668 --> 00:51:12,102
<i>or something about a chef.</i>

1028
00:51:13,037 --> 00:51:14,538
We get 55 sentences,

1029
00:51:14,605 --> 00:51:16,473
- so we should sort them well.
- Agreed.

1030
00:51:16,574 --> 00:51:18,475
We should designate a section for each job

1031
00:51:19,209 --> 00:51:22,379
and put all the relevant cards there.

1032
00:51:22,446 --> 00:51:24,014
That's an idea.

1033
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:26,850
We obviously need to do well individually,
but teamwork will matter, too.

1034
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:27,918
That's for sure.

1035
00:51:28,018 --> 00:51:29,887
We should assign roles strategically.

1036
00:51:29,954 --> 00:51:32,389
My takeaway from Signal Investigation 2

1037
00:51:32,456 --> 00:51:34,258
is that STEM students like us

1038
00:51:34,325 --> 00:51:37,561
tend to lose their way
when they get fixated on conclusive leads.

1039
00:51:37,962 --> 00:51:39,463
We have to play with an open mind.

1040
00:51:39,563 --> 00:51:41,865
We have to let our intuition
guide us sometimes

1041
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:44,568
to speed through a game like this.

1042
00:51:44,635 --> 00:51:47,104
Intuition always plays a huge role
in logic puzzles.

1043
00:51:47,171 --> 00:51:50,975
Get your mojo up
and send it to your brain.

1044
00:51:51,075 --> 00:51:54,745
First off, we need an 8-by-8 table.

1045
00:51:56,647 --> 00:51:59,984
If we feel sure
about a certain person's job,

1046
00:52:00,084 --> 00:52:01,352
we'll use a circle.

1047
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:04,622
If there's a high probability,
we'll use a triangle.

1048
00:52:04,722 --> 00:52:07,591
If something can be ruled out,
we can mark it with an X.

1049
00:52:07,658 --> 00:52:11,328
If there's even the slightest possibility,
we'll use a triangle.

1050
00:52:11,428 --> 00:52:14,898
I think the key is to finish
the task for Round 1 as soon as possible.

1051
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:17,101
Reducing time in Round 1
will be essential.

1052
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:20,137
It would give our division a big boost.

1053
00:52:20,204 --> 00:52:22,272
Then our division won't lose.

1054
00:52:22,339 --> 00:52:24,608
- It'll be a race to the finish.
- Yeah.

1055
00:52:24,675 --> 00:52:27,211
In a game like this, one mistake is fatal.

1056
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:28,746
We need precision.

1057
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:29,980
CAN'T AFFORD A MISTAKE

1058
00:52:30,514 --> 00:52:33,617
When matching a person to a job,
at least two people should confirm it.

1059
00:52:33,684 --> 00:52:35,452
- Yes, let's double-check.
- Okay.

1060
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:37,821
Then let's split the cards.

1061
00:52:37,921 --> 00:52:39,990
- You guys can take Set A.
- Yeah?

1062
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:43,093
First, let's tackle the first set of cards

1063
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:46,296
- so we can combine the information later.
- Yes, we'll do that.

1064
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:50,834
A transitive verb
requires a direct object.

1065
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:54,405
If there is a conjunction like "and,"
we'll set that card aside.

1066
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:56,140
The tense could matter, too.

1067
00:52:56,206 --> 00:52:58,375
- If a card has the word "yesterday,"
- You're right.

1068
00:52:58,475 --> 00:53:00,844
it should be matched
with a card using the past tense.

1069
00:53:01,412 --> 00:53:03,580
<i>We thought it would be good</i>

1070
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:08,519
to strategize first
with the grammatical aspects or syntax.

1071
00:53:08,786 --> 00:53:10,354
When sorting out the cards,

1072
00:53:10,421 --> 00:53:13,957
we should see if it only has a subject,
or a subject and an addressee.

1073
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:16,160
Same with verbs.
Let's see if it needs a complement.

1074
00:53:16,226 --> 00:53:20,597
We can also get an intransitive verb
or a transitive verb.

1075
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:22,366
Let's use this as our guide.

1076
00:53:22,433 --> 00:53:24,735
Once a variety
of specific guides are set up

1077
00:53:24,835 --> 00:53:27,004
- and we keep categorizing the cards...
- We must keep at it.

1078
00:53:27,071 --> 00:53:29,707
- That would help us narrow things down.
- Exactly.

1079
00:53:29,807 --> 00:53:31,909
Even with the system we set up,

1080
00:53:32,009 --> 00:53:34,411
we may still miss something
or make a mistake.

1081
00:53:34,511 --> 00:53:39,216
So someone needs to examine our work
and check if there is an alternative take.

1082
00:53:39,283 --> 00:53:41,051
I can take on that role.

1083
00:53:41,151 --> 00:53:44,154
- I'm often called a skeptic.
- Okay, you can check our work.

1084
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:47,991
Be critical, okay?
Tell us if anything looks shaky.

1085
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:50,060
Hit us with everything you can think of.

1086
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:53,731
<i>You have five minutes left</i>
<i>to discuss your strategy.</i>

1087
00:53:53,831 --> 00:53:55,766
<i>Let's brainstorm for Round 2 a bit.</i>

1088
00:53:55,866 --> 00:53:59,636
We're getting photos
from the same angle in Round 2, right?

1089
00:53:59,737 --> 00:54:01,839
<i>It will be like those escape room games.</i>

1090
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:04,942
<i>Like, we might have to catch</i>
<i>the changes in item arrangement.</i>

1091
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:09,046
If the events take place outdoors,
we'll have to look for a clock tower or...

1092
00:54:09,113 --> 00:54:13,383
We can look at the length of the shadows
if there are no clocks around.

1093
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:17,321
Grass on the ground may get flattened
if someone passed that point.

1094
00:54:17,421 --> 00:54:21,892
The photos will give us various clues,
such as time.

1095
00:54:21,959 --> 00:54:24,261
I'd like us to log them separately.

1096
00:54:24,328 --> 00:54:28,098
I just know that you'll help us out
big time in Round 2, Tae-hun.

1097
00:54:28,198 --> 00:54:29,933
I hope I can oblige.

1098
00:54:30,033 --> 00:54:31,401
Let's go get it.

1099
00:54:31,468 --> 00:54:35,305
This is the type of game
we wanted the most for a main match.

1100
00:54:35,405 --> 00:54:37,407
I've been hoping for a game like this

1101
00:54:37,474 --> 00:54:39,610
because when memorization
or calculation is involved,

1102
00:54:39,676 --> 00:54:42,312
- we can't beat the med students.
- We can't beat the med students.

1103
00:54:42,412 --> 00:54:44,915
Our odds are better
in strategy or deduction games.

1104
00:54:44,982 --> 00:54:48,118
We won yesterday because the game
wasn't about calculation or memorization.

1105
00:54:48,218 --> 00:54:50,954
All of us felt good
about our deduction skills,

1106
00:54:51,054 --> 00:54:54,458
so I thought we had the game in the bag.

1107
00:54:54,525 --> 00:54:56,827
<i>The time for strategy meeting is up.</i>

1108
00:54:56,927 --> 00:54:58,428
STRATEGY MEETING OVER

1109
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,364
Let's do this.

1110
00:55:01,899 --> 00:55:03,801
I'm afraid the STEM guys will kill it.

1111
00:55:04,601 --> 00:55:06,503
- No, this is our thing.
- Really?

1112
00:55:06,603 --> 00:55:09,973
This tests your sheer analytical skills,
so we get the upper hand.

1113
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:12,676
GOOD LUCK, MEDICAL DIVISION

1114
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,148
What's with the little sexy move?

1115
00:55:19,817 --> 00:55:20,851
Why?

1116
00:55:20,951 --> 00:55:22,719
I think I saw some hip shimmies.

1117
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,688
He did this yesterday, too.

1118
00:55:24,788 --> 00:55:25,856
He did that just now.

1119
00:55:25,956 --> 00:55:27,090
He did this yesterday, too.

1120
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:28,292
Hey, Ji-hu just danced.

1121
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:30,527
This is very unusual.

1122
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:34,665
GOOD LUCK, JI-HU AND JI-HOO

1123
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:36,934
<i>Before we begin the game,</i>

1124
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,870
<i>we will give you a summary of the events</i>
<i>leading up to the case.</i>

1125
00:55:41,104 --> 00:55:44,541
<i>The events take place in 2075,</i>
<i>the era of commercialized space travel.</i>

1126
00:55:44,641 --> 00:55:48,745
<i>Space 7, the perfect artificial</i>
<i>gravity system for space stations,</i>

1127
00:55:48,846 --> 00:55:51,148
<i>simulated Earth's gravity so well</i>

1128
00:55:51,215 --> 00:55:55,652
<i>that it became the first major success</i>
<i>as a destination to visit in space.</i>

1129

<i>and the face of space commercialization,</i>

1130
00:56:00,757 --> 00:56:03,360

<i>a newly discovered substance on Mars.</i>

1132

<i>and named the project "Stone of Eternity."</i>

1133
00:56:10,901 --> 00:56:15,706
<i>With the new drug's release approaching,</i>
<i>a commercial was to be shot on Mars.</i>

1134
00:56:15,772 --> 00:56:18,709
<i>To oversee the process,</i>
<i>Adam boarded Space 7.</i>

1135
00:56:18,775 --> 00:56:22,012
<i>But only a day before the shoot,</i>

1136
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:27,351
<i>Adam was found dead in his cabin.</i>

1137
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:31,255
<i>Space 7 is an isolated spacecraft.</i>

1138
00:56:31,355 --> 00:56:35,726
<i>Which one of the passengers</i>
<i>is responsible for Adam's death?</i>

1139
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:39,796

1174
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:05,082
Actor, manager.

1175
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:08,785
Physician and researcher.
That's one person.

1176
00:58:08,852 --> 00:58:10,320
One person with two jobs.

1177
00:58:11,254 --> 00:58:13,023
Who would handle patrol duty?

1178
00:58:13,123 --> 00:58:15,459
- Head of security, right?
- Yes, it's here.

1179
00:58:15,993 --> 00:58:17,961
Patrol duty. It's the second column.

1180
00:58:18,028 --> 00:58:19,696
SECURITY GUARD

1181
00:58:19,796 --> 00:58:23,300
It says someone must check the equipment.
That's the engineer's job.

1182
00:58:23,367 --> 00:58:26,003
ENGINEER

1183
00:58:26,303 --> 00:58:28,171
Let's dig into the YouTuber.

1184
00:58:28,271 --> 00:58:29,106
...HER YOUTUBE CHANNEL'S...

1185
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:33,343
If a card uses a verb like "ask," wouldn't
the matching card elaborate on that?

1186
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:34,378
- Of course.
- Right?

1187
00:58:34,478 --> 00:58:36,847
<i>- As in, "A asked B to do C."</i>
<i>- Oh, sure.</i>

1188
00:58:36,913 --> 00:58:38,348
FOCUSING ON VERBS
THAT REQUIRE A COMPLEMENT

1189
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:40,050
Grouping cards with similar verbs

1190
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:42,119
- could be helpful.
- Good idea.

1191
00:58:42,486 --> 00:58:44,688
- Verbs like ask, request, or tell...
- Yeah.

1192
00:58:44,755 --> 00:58:45,856
I'll start from here.

1193
00:58:46,857 --> 00:58:48,692
Verbs that need a complement...

1194
00:58:49,026 --> 00:58:50,994
"Harry messaged his editor..."

1195
00:58:51,061 --> 00:58:52,929
- I think this is it.
- Really?

1196
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:54,464
That's the last one that fits the bill.

1197
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:56,299
Really? Let's check the verbs.

1198
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:58,535
5 CARD WITH VERBS
THAT REQUIRES A COMPLEMENT

1199
00:58:58,602 --> 00:59:01,505
<i>Look for cards from Set B</i>
<i>that might be their matches.</i>

1200
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:02,873
CARDS THAT MAY BE A MATCH

1201
00:59:02,939 --> 00:59:03,840
Look at this.

1202
00:59:03,907 --> 00:59:06,743
- This can be the content of a message.
- Right, let's see if someone sent one.

1203
00:59:06,843 --> 00:59:08,512
"That she scraped her arm on the pipe."

1204
00:59:08,578 --> 00:59:09,913
CARD WITH A CLAUSAL COMPLEMENT

1205
00:59:10,247 --> 00:59:11,481
"That he heard Gabriel's voice..."

1206
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:13,183
CARD WITH A CLAUSAL COMPLEMENT

1207
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:15,152
"For taking his role."

1208
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:17,020
CARD WITH A PREPOSITIONAL COMPLEMENT

1209
00:59:17,087 --> 00:59:19,589
"With a bottle of wine as a gift."

1210
00:59:19,689 --> 00:59:20,690
CARD WITH A PREPOSITIONAL PHRASE

1211
00:59:20,757 --> 00:59:23,326
CARD WITH A CLAUSAL COMPLEMENT
This here would need a fitting verb

1212
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:25,529
- because it's a request.
- Right.

1213
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:31,234
We found 5 cards from Set A
and 5 cards from Set B to match...

1214
00:59:31,334 --> 00:59:32,769
Wait, we have six cards.

1215
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:35,372
5 CARDS FROM SET A,
6 CARDS FROM SET B

1216
00:59:35,705 --> 00:59:40,110
THE CARDS FROM SET B
OUTNUMBER THE CARDS FROM SET A

1217
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:42,712
There are too many of them
for us to review.

1218
00:59:42,779 --> 00:59:46,783
THE GRAMMATICAL APPROACH ISN'T EFFECTIVE

1219
00:59:46,983 --> 00:59:49,119
Are we really going to categorize them?

1220
00:59:49,219 --> 00:59:50,787
Won't that be too difficult?

1221
00:59:52,055 --> 00:59:54,658
- Yeah, it's just...
- It's too big a challenge.

1222
00:59:54,758 --> 00:59:56,927
Let's just use our intuition
to match them.

1223
00:59:56,993 --> 01:00:00,263
- Just go with your intuition.
- That might be the right approach.

1224
01:00:00,964 --> 01:00:02,299
One more thing.

1225
01:00:02,399 --> 01:00:04,768
These cards tell a story together.

1226
01:00:04,835 --> 01:00:06,603
B-43 and A-43 both mention
Dylan getting fired.

1227
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:07,737
Judging from that,

1228
01:00:07,804 --> 01:00:11,408
we won't need to get fixated
on matching an A card with a B card.

1229
01:00:11,475 --> 01:00:14,578
Look at B-25 and B-45.

1230
01:00:14,644 --> 01:00:16,146
They both mention subscribers.

1231
01:00:16,246 --> 01:00:18,815
They have to be about the same person.

1232
01:00:18,915 --> 01:00:20,550
Yes, that has to be the case.

1233
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:22,619
Guys, about that YouTuber.

1234
01:00:22,686 --> 01:00:23,687
That's Jennifer.

1235
01:00:23,787 --> 01:00:25,021
JENNIFER IS THE YOUTUBER?

1236
01:00:25,122 --> 01:00:26,022
- How so?
- Are you sure?

1237
01:00:26,123 --> 01:00:28,425
It says Jennifer filmed
an unapproved location.

1238
01:00:28,492 --> 01:00:29,693
ADAM ARGUED THAT JENNIFER FILMED...

1239
01:00:29,793 --> 01:00:33,563
Out of all the jobs on the cards,
only a YouTuber would do that.

1240
01:00:33,864 --> 01:00:35,499
The YouTuber is a woman.

1241
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:39,503
So the YouTuber has to be
either Jennifer or Christina.

1242
01:00:39,603 --> 01:00:41,404
- Only these two are women.
- That's Christopher.

1243
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:43,673
- Jennifer is likely the YouTuber.
- You bet.

1244
01:00:43,773 --> 01:00:45,509
There's a high chance
Jennifer is the YouTuber.

1245
01:00:45,609 --> 01:00:46,810
- She is?
- Yeah.

1246
01:00:46,877 --> 01:00:48,311
Jennifer enjoys going on trips.

1247
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:50,413
<i>Then, this card about her travel content</i>

1248
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,183
<i>should be connected</i>
<i>to her YouTube channel's growth.</i>

1249
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:56,286
I like this. Can we confirm this pair?

1250
01:00:57,287 --> 01:01:01,324
JENNIFER BOARDED SPACE 7 TO FILM
THE EXPERIENCE FOR HER YOUTUBE CHANNEL

1251
01:01:02,359 --> 01:01:06,296
Bella took care of the equipment failure.
She must be an engineer.

1252
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:09,299
Bella resolved the equipment failure.

1253
01:01:09,366 --> 01:01:10,467
She's an engineer.

1254
01:01:10,534 --> 01:01:12,736
- So Bella's an engineer.
- Yes.

1255
01:01:13,303 --> 01:01:17,040
BELLA IS AN ENGINEER ON SPACE 7

1256
01:01:17,307 --> 01:01:22,045
We discussed
how Gabriel is likely the physician.

1257
01:01:22,145 --> 01:01:25,148
Someone with an injured hand
came to see Gabriel.

1258
01:01:25,215 --> 01:01:27,184
- Okay, then...
- Should we assume he's a physician?

1259
01:01:27,284 --> 01:01:28,451
The physician...

1260
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:31,021
- Gabriel is a physician.
- He's a physician?

1261
01:01:31,087 --> 01:01:32,389
A-8 and B-9 match.

1262
01:01:32,489 --> 01:01:33,924
Isn't he the researcher?

1263
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:36,026
He's a physician and researcher.

1264
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:41,031
GABRIEL IS A PHYSICIAN ON SPACE 7
WORKING ON THE NEW DRUG RESEARCH

1265
01:01:41,097 --> 01:01:43,400
...NEW BOOK SET IN A SPACECRAFT...
Harry is writing a new book.

1266
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:45,835
- You're right.
- He's the writer.

1267
01:01:45,902 --> 01:01:47,704
Guys, remember that card?

1268
01:01:47,771 --> 01:01:50,540
One mentioned Harry's book,
<i>Murder on the Two-lane Road</i>.

1269
01:01:51,007 --> 01:01:54,511
I think that should be followed
by how it was based on a real event.

1270
01:01:54,578 --> 01:01:56,513
Aren't these two a good match?

1271
01:01:56,580 --> 01:01:58,248
Hey, I like this.

1272
01:01:58,348 --> 01:02:00,517
- Harry is the writer.
- Yes, he is.

1273
01:02:01,084 --> 01:02:05,088
HARRY IS WORKING ON HIS NEW BOOK
THAT TAKES PLACE IN A SPACECRAFT

1274
01:02:05,188 --> 01:02:07,324
We only have a few jobs left.

1275
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:08,692
Let's look for more.

1276
01:02:08,758 --> 01:02:10,260
Any mention of a security guard?

1277
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:13,196
"Security guard."
We've got a security guard.

1278
01:02:13,263 --> 01:02:14,931
One of them must be a chef.

1279
01:02:15,031 --> 01:02:16,233
ADAM STATED THAT HE WANTED A NEW CHEF...

1280
01:02:16,333 --> 01:02:17,567
Write down manager.

1281
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:18,868
- Manager?
- Yeah.

1282
01:02:18,935 --> 01:02:21,905
"Edward told his manager..."
It seems he has a manager.

1283
01:02:21,972 --> 01:02:24,241
What if Edward is an actor
and has a manager?

1284
01:02:24,341 --> 01:02:26,376
So he's an actor with a manager?

1285
01:02:26,443 --> 01:02:29,913
These cards say Edward was enraged
at the rookie Frank.

1286
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:32,449
- Right.
- Doesn't it mean Frank is also an actor?

1287
01:02:32,549 --> 01:02:34,618
We must have two actors,
a veteran and a rookie.

1288
01:02:34,718 --> 01:02:36,786
That's a possibility.

1289
01:02:36,886 --> 01:02:39,990
Guys, look. It says Edward
was enraged at the rookie Frank.

1290
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:41,291
What do we make of "rookie"?

1291
01:02:41,391 --> 01:02:43,426
That term is usually associated with...

1292
01:02:43,793 --> 01:02:46,396
I'd say he's likely an actor, but...

1293
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:48,898
Wait, he could be a writer, too.

1294
01:02:48,965 --> 01:02:50,400
He could be new to YouTube

1295
01:02:50,467 --> 01:02:52,469
- or the culinary field.
- Yes, he could be a chef.

1296
01:02:52,569 --> 01:02:54,304
- That keyword...
- It doesn't tell us much.

1297
01:02:54,404 --> 01:02:55,805
FRANK, A ROOKIE

1298
01:02:55,905 --> 01:02:58,441
WHAT IS FRANK'S PROFESSION?

1299
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:02,445
Let's revisit Christopher and Frank.

1300
01:03:02,646 --> 01:03:04,180
- Christopher...
- "When he got no replies..."

1301
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:05,448
Replies?

1302
01:03:05,548 --> 01:03:07,784
As for messaging back and forth...

1303
01:03:07,851 --> 01:03:10,954
I think I saw a couple of cards
about the actor texting people.

1304
01:03:11,187 --> 01:03:13,390
Look, he complained
about being insulted "via text."

1305
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:14,991
Do we know who the actor is?

1306
01:03:15,091 --> 01:03:18,295
Wait, Christopher got overlooked.

1307
01:03:18,395 --> 01:03:20,764
- He got overlooked?
- Yes, for promotion.

1308
01:03:21,498 --> 01:03:24,200
I'd say he's the manager.
But do managers get promoted?

1309
01:03:24,301 --> 01:03:26,136
CAN CHRISTOPHER BE THE MANAGER?

1310
01:03:26,503 --> 01:03:30,507
<i>Team SKKU's submission...</i>

1311
01:03:32,042 --> 01:03:34,611
<i>on the suspect information was correct.</i>

1312
01:03:34,678 --> 01:03:36,313
- Which team was it?
- Team SKKU.

1313
01:03:36,413 --> 01:03:38,014
Damn it.

1314
01:03:38,848 --> 01:03:41,117
<i>I thought we were moving along quite fast.</i>

1315
01:03:41,184 --> 01:03:43,486
<i>I was caught off guard</i>
<i>by Team SKKU's quick success.</i>

1316
01:03:44,421 --> 01:03:47,023
- Shoot.
- Let's get back to work. Nice and steady.

1317
01:03:47,590 --> 01:03:49,693
<i>Ji-hu, that little rascal,</i>
<i>got ahead of me.</i>

1318
01:03:49,793 --> 01:03:50,960
<i>This was bad.</i>

1319
01:03:52,162 --> 01:03:54,431
- That was awesome.
- I killed it, didn't I?

1320
01:03:54,864 --> 01:03:57,334
TEAM SKKU SUCCEEDED QUICKLY
THANKS TO SUNG TAE-HUN

1321
01:03:57,434 --> 01:03:59,669
- I can't believe it. What the heck, dude?
- That's insane!

1322
01:03:59,769 --> 01:04:01,905
PASSCODE SECURED
It's 18751879.

1323
01:04:02,772 --> 01:04:05,909
<i>We owe it to Tae-hun,</i>
<i>from start to finish.</i>

1324
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:11,147
<i>He has good intuition,</i>
<i>so he read all the cards by himself...</i>

1325
01:04:12,048 --> 01:04:14,184
Guys, I skimmed through all 110 cards.

1326
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:15,819
QUICKLY MASTERED THE CONTENT OF 110 CARDS

1327
01:04:15,885 --> 01:04:17,921
<i>Since we had quite a lot of cards,</i>

1328
01:04:18,021 --> 01:04:23,326
<i>I thought it would be too time-consuming</i>
<i>to systematically categorize them.</i>

1329
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:26,896
I realized the importance
of intuition in the game.

1330
01:04:27,464 --> 01:04:31,868
He went through the cards alone
and told us the profession of each person.

1331
01:04:31,935 --> 01:04:35,071
We have a writer,
a security guard, an actor,

1332
01:04:35,171 --> 01:04:36,539
and an engineer.

1333
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:39,576
HE CORRECTLY IDENTIFIED
THE SUSPECTS' PROFESSIONS IN ONE GO

1334
01:04:39,676 --> 01:04:40,510
PASSCODE IS 18751879

1335
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:42,512
TEAM SKKU OPENED THE SAFE FIRST

1336
01:04:42,579 --> 01:04:44,047
It's freaking unbelievable.

01:04:53,056 --> 01:04:54,924
AND 20 PHOTOS FROM A SECURITY CAMERA

1340
01:04:55,291 --> 01:05:00,897
WHEN ARRANGED IN THE CORRECT SEQUENCE,
THESE PHOTOS WILL REVEAL THE TRUTH

1341
01:05:00,964 --> 01:05:05,535
<i>We will now begin Round 2</i>
<i>of Signal Investigation 3.</i>

1342
01:05:05,602 --> 01:05:08,671
<i>You will be given 1 hour and 30 minutes.</i>

1343
01:05:11,841 --> 01:05:13,877
Let's focus on the jobs
and start matching them.

1344
01:05:13,943 --> 01:05:16,679
- Yes, exactly.
- We've lost focus on the jobs.

1345
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:18,615
MUST COMPLETE THE ROUND 1 TASK
TO TACKLE ROUND 2

1346
01:05:19,282 --> 01:05:21,284
<i>Team SKKU completed Round 1 very early,</i>

1347
01:05:21,384 --> 01:05:24,954
whereas we had almost nothing confirmed.

1348
01:05:25,688 --> 01:05:27,290
Does that make no sense grammatically?

1349
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:29,726
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE'S ONLY GUIDE
WAS GRAMMATICAL ELEMENTS

1350
01:05:30,093 --> 01:05:32,061
<i>None of us felt comfortable</i>
<i>requesting a new action plan</i>

1351
01:05:32,128 --> 01:05:34,464
<i>with respect to the plan we made</i>
<i>during the strategy meeting.</i>

1352
01:05:34,564 --> 01:05:36,433
<i>...on the suspect information was correct.</i>

1353
01:05:36,533 --> 01:05:37,600
They're so fast.

1354
01:05:38,268 --> 01:05:41,171
<i>Team SKKU's quick success</i>
<i>with the Round 1 task</i>

1355
01:05:41,471 --> 01:05:47,444
drove us to take up a new approach boldly.

1356
01:05:48,178 --> 01:05:51,481
Let's sort out the cards
based on the clues we gathered so far.

1357
01:05:51,581 --> 01:05:52,749
- Agreed.
- Good idea.

1358
01:05:52,816 --> 01:05:55,251
HARRY, FOR HIS NEW BOOK
I think A-32 and B-13 are a match.

1359
01:05:55,318 --> 01:05:57,420
JENNIFER, UPLOAD SCHEDULE
Here's another set. A-14 and B-6.

1360
01:05:57,487 --> 01:05:58,788
Is it about Jennifer?

1361
01:05:58,888 --> 01:06:01,324
<i>Okay, we're on the right path. Good job.</i>

1362
01:06:01,424 --> 01:06:02,892
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE PICKS UP THE PACE

1363
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:06,629
DYLAN TOOK A SLICE OF FRUIT CAKE...
I think Dylan may be a chef.

1364
01:06:06,729 --> 01:06:08,898
Adam wanted to replace his chef
and fired Dylan.

1365
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:10,099
Great job.

1366
01:06:11,034 --> 01:06:13,203
- "Dylan protested..."
- He was wrongfully dismissed!

1367
01:06:13,303 --> 01:06:15,638
Basically, Dylan was Adam's subordinate.

1368
01:06:15,738 --> 01:06:17,640
- Exactly.
- Adam was his boss.

1369
01:06:18,608 --> 01:06:22,011
DYLAN WAS A CHEF
WORKING ON ADAM'S SPACECRAFT

1370
01:06:22,111 --> 01:06:24,614
I think Christopher works for Adam, too.

1371
01:06:24,681 --> 01:06:27,383
<i>Maybe not, but he wanted to talk to Adam</i>
<i>for being overlooked for promotion.</i>

1372
01:06:27,484 --> 01:06:30,019
Do we have more leads
about Frank and Christopher?

1373
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:31,521
I'll look for them.

1374
01:06:31,621 --> 01:06:34,290
TEAM KAIST HAS IDENTIFIED
MOST SUSPECTS' PROFESSIONS

1375
01:06:34,357 --> 01:06:35,959
EXCEPT FOR CHRISTOPHER AND FRANK

1376
01:06:36,025 --> 01:06:39,195
We thought Dylan might be in security
because we knew he was on Adam's payroll.

1377
01:06:39,295 --> 01:06:40,530
It's almost a certainty.

1378
01:06:40,630 --> 01:06:43,199
- Only the security guard fits the bill.
- All right, then.

1379
01:06:43,533 --> 01:06:44,701
I'll put a circle here.

1380
01:06:45,502 --> 01:06:47,003
Who do we have left now?

1381
01:06:47,070 --> 01:06:48,638
Christopher and Frank.

1382
01:06:48,705 --> 01:06:50,139
Match chef and manager...

1383
01:06:50,206 --> 01:06:52,208
- With those two guys. Got it.
- Exactly.

1384
01:06:53,409 --> 01:06:56,779
Are we sure Dylan is the security guard?

1385
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:58,515
He's got to be the chef.

1386
01:06:58,615 --> 01:07:00,250
- How come?
- What makes you say that?

1387
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:02,785
Just look.

1388
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:05,655
Adam asked Dylan to delay
his usual tea delivery by ten minutes.

1389
01:07:05,722 --> 01:07:08,258
Dylan has to be the chef.

1390
01:07:09,158 --> 01:07:11,227
Maybe Edward works in security.

1391
01:07:11,327 --> 01:07:14,264
But we know Edward has a manager.

1392
01:07:14,364 --> 01:07:16,065
Frank is the rookie, right?

1393
01:07:16,165 --> 01:07:18,835
Frank is the rookie,
and Edward has a manager.

1394
01:07:19,269 --> 01:07:23,806
Doesn't that make Frank
an up-and-coming actor?

1395
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:25,808
CHRISTOPHER AND FRANK: N/A

1396
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:27,911
Maybe Frank is the manager?

1397
01:07:28,011 --> 01:07:29,512
The rookie Frank somehow enraged Edward.

1398
01:07:29,579 --> 01:07:33,049
- Frank is a rookie actor.
- A rookie actor?

1399
01:07:33,116 --> 01:07:36,419
- We still have an issue.
- The manager and the rookie actor...

1400
01:07:36,519 --> 01:07:38,821
REMAINING JOBS:
ROOKIE ACTOR, MANAGER, SECURITY GUARD

1401
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:40,924
I don't think the manager
is in the suspect pool.

1402
01:07:41,024 --> 01:07:41,858
Frank is an actor, then.

1403
01:07:41,925 --> 01:07:43,593
Where did this manager come from?

1404
01:07:43,693 --> 01:07:47,530
One card mentions
Edward complaining to his manager.

1405
01:07:47,597 --> 01:07:51,200
But the manager can have
nothing to do with the murder.

1406
01:07:51,834 --> 01:07:55,772
- One mention doesn't make you a suspect.
- The manager might not be on Space 7.

1407
01:07:55,872 --> 01:07:57,607
We have two actors in the suspect pool?

1408
01:07:58,141 --> 01:07:59,142
That seems likely.

1409
01:07:59,242 --> 01:08:00,710
FRANK: ROOKIE ACTOR
CHRISTOPHER: SECURITY GUARD

1410
01:08:00,777 --> 01:08:02,912
I think Edward and Frank may be actors.

1411
01:08:03,012 --> 01:08:06,449
This card says Edward was enraged
at the rookie Frank for a reason.

1412
01:08:06,849 --> 01:08:08,484
<i>We can match these two, no?</i>

1413
01:08:08,585 --> 01:08:09,953
EDWARD WAS ENRAGED AT THE ROOKIE FRANK...

1414
01:08:10,053 --> 01:08:10,954
...FOR TAKING HIS ROLE

1415
01:08:11,054 --> 01:08:13,022
- We have two actors.
- See? I told you.

1416
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:15,325
But the veteran
was replaced by the rookie.

1417
01:08:15,425 --> 01:08:16,459
That seems to be it.

1418
01:08:17,327 --> 01:08:20,797
EDWARD AND FRANK ARE ACTORS
WHO BOARDED SPACE 7 TO SHOOT A COMMERCIAL

1419
01:08:21,264 --> 01:08:22,432
CHRISTOPHER

1420
01:08:22,498 --> 01:08:25,335
TEAM KAIST ONLY HAS TO DEDUCE
CHRISTOPHER'S PROFESSION

1421
01:08:25,635 --> 01:08:29,706
<i>Because we were making steady progress,</i>
<i>I thought we could come in second.</i>

1422
01:08:29,973 --> 01:08:33,710
In essence, being overlooked for promotion
means not becoming the head of security.

1423
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:36,279
I think Christopher is the security guard.

1424
01:08:36,579 --> 01:08:37,814
That's the only possibility.

1425
01:08:37,914 --> 01:08:39,182
- Got it.
- Great.

1426
01:08:40,316 --> 01:08:43,086
CHRISTOPHER IS A SECURITY GUARD ON SPACE 7

1427
01:08:43,152 --> 01:08:46,789
TEAM KAIST SUBMITS THEIR FINDINGS
ABOUT THE SUSPECTS' PROFESSIONS

1428
01:08:46,889 --> 01:08:49,659
<i>Team KAIST's submission</i>
<i>on the suspect information</i>

1429
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:51,828
<i>was correct.</i>

1430
01:08:51,928 --> 01:08:54,464
<i>...on the suspect information was correct.</i>

1431
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:57,800
THE WINNER IS DECIDED
BY EACH DIVISION'S TOTAL TIME SPENT

1432
01:08:57,900 --> 01:08:59,002
<i>...was correct.</i>

1433
01:08:59,602 --> 01:09:00,470
They did it.

1434
01:09:00,536 --> 01:09:02,205
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE GROWS IMPATIENT

1435
01:09:02,305 --> 01:09:04,173
<i>That added a sense of urgency.</i>

1436
01:09:04,273 --> 01:09:07,110
<i>I thought that I should be more alert.</i>

1437
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:11,648
We have to rearrange them, right?
Can you sort these out in order of events?

1438
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:16,352
20 PHOTOS FROM THE SECURITY CAMERA
ARE MIXED RANDOMLY OUT OF ORDER

1439
01:09:16,653 --> 01:09:20,623
THEY CAN FIND THE CULPRIT BY COMBINING
INFORMATION FROM THE PHOTOS AND THE CARDS

1440
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:23,026
"While leaving Adam's cabin, Frank..."

1441
01:09:23,126 --> 01:09:24,327
Why was he there anyway?

1442
01:09:24,394 --> 01:09:27,463
PHOTO OF FRANK
STANDING OUTSIDE OF ADAM'S CABIN

1443
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:30,400
Pretty much all the suspects visited Adam.

1444
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:35,004
CHRISTOPHER THE SECURITY GUARD
DISCOVERED ADAM'S CORPSE

1445
01:09:35,638 --> 01:09:39,409
SUSPECTS SEEN LEAVING ADAM'S CABIN
ARE AS FOLLOWS

1446
01:09:39,509 --> 01:09:42,412
EDWARD THE ACTOR

1447
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:45,415
JENNIFER THE YOUTUBER

1448
01:09:45,515 --> 01:09:48,418
HARRY THE MYSTERY WRITER

1449
01:09:48,518 --> 01:09:49,952
GABRIEL THE PHYSICIAN AND RESEARCHER

1450
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:52,522
<i>Why was Gabriel there?</i>
<i>Was there a mention of him going in?</i>

1451
01:09:52,588 --> 01:09:55,591
Adam was trying to push
the launch of the new drug,

1452
01:09:55,692 --> 01:09:58,795
so the physician and researcher, Gabriel,
wanted to stop that.

1453
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:00,396
GABRIEL'S PERSUASION ATTEMPT

1454
01:10:00,496 --> 01:10:03,166
So Adam and Gabriel didn't get along.

1455
01:10:03,232 --> 01:10:06,135
- Everyone would have beef with him.
- Of course.

1456
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:08,237
Everyone has to have a motive for murder.

1457
01:10:08,538 --> 01:10:11,240
By the way,
multiple people were out to kill Adam.

1458
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:15,078
- Yeah, there's a handful.
- Exactly. He made a lot of enemies.

1459
01:10:15,178 --> 01:10:20,283
SUSPECTS WITH A GRUDGE AGAINST ADAM

1460
01:10:21,684 --> 01:10:23,619
These are just smoke screens.

1461
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:27,423
<i>Many cards mentioned people</i>
<i>being upset by Adam's actions.</i>

1462
01:10:27,523 --> 01:10:31,527
But I thought those were just
game devices to trick us.

1463
01:10:31,594 --> 01:10:35,631
I believed that our investigation
should be based on solid evidence.

1464
01:10:35,732 --> 01:10:40,403
Dong-yeon, out of the events in the cards
that you have been reviewing up to now,

1465
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:44,006
can you tell me the ones
we know exactly when they happened?

1466
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:47,043
This happened at 10:50 p.m.,
and that happened at 11:10 p.m.

1467
01:10:47,110 --> 01:10:48,478
These are all between that time.

1468
01:10:49,645 --> 01:10:51,214
- Let me take notes.
- Okay.

1469
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:52,548
ANALYZING THE TIME DATA

1470
01:10:54,650 --> 01:10:57,653
<i>I thought we needed</i>
<i>the estimated time of death first.</i>

1471
01:10:57,754 --> 01:11:01,457
TEAM SKKU TRIES TO PINPOINT
ADAM'S TIME OF DEATH

1472
01:11:01,557 --> 01:11:03,326
When did Adam have his chamomile tea?

1473
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:06,596
One of the cards mentioned
the time of the usual delivery.

1474
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:09,132
Found it. The chef has
to give him the tea at 10 p.m.

1475
01:11:09,232 --> 01:11:12,902
- The delivery was made at 10:10 p.m.
- At 10:10 p.m.

1476
01:11:12,969 --> 01:11:16,906
AT 10:10 P.M., DYLAN THE CHEF BROUGHT
TEA AND CAKE TO ADAM'S CABIN

1477
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:20,343
Look. Harry had an appointment
with Adam at 10:55 p.m.

1478
01:11:20,443 --> 01:11:22,278
to gather material for his new book.

1479
01:11:22,345 --> 01:11:26,282
AT 10:55 P.M., HARRY THE MYSTERY WRITER
VISITED ADAM TO INTERVIEW HIM

1480
01:11:26,749 --> 01:11:28,618
We could use a timeline on the board.

1481
01:11:28,684 --> 01:11:30,686
- Okay, one second.
- Let's use that to catch our killer.

1482
01:11:31,053 --> 01:11:32,989
The solar flare occurred at 11:10 p.m.

1483
01:11:33,890 --> 01:11:36,893
AT 11:10 P.M., BELLA THE ENGINEER HAD
TO EXAMINE EQUIPMENT DUE TO A SOLAR FLARE

1484
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:39,262
EMERGENCY LIGHT WAS ON AT 11:10 P.M.

1485
01:11:39,328 --> 01:11:42,832
<i>Team SNU in STEM's submission</i>
<i>on the suspect information was incorrect.</i>

1486
01:11:42,932 --> 01:11:44,534
<i>Please try again.</i>

1487
01:11:45,001 --> 01:11:46,936
Chin up, guys!

1488
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:50,139
We still don't know
if Frank is an actor or a manager.

1489
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:51,340
We're sure about this.

1490
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:52,775
ONE MORE FAILURE
WILL TRIGGER A 10-MINUTE PENALTY

1491
01:11:52,842 --> 01:11:54,143
Well, about Frank...

1492
01:11:54,944 --> 01:11:59,015
<i>We wrongly assumed</i>
<i>that everyone had a different profession.</i>

1493
01:11:59,115 --> 01:12:02,185
I'm still haunted by the conundrum
of Edward and Frank both being actors.

1494
01:12:02,285 --> 01:12:04,387
How do we resolve this?

1495
01:12:04,487 --> 01:12:07,290
This card says he valued his integrity
as a physician and researcher.

1496
01:12:07,356 --> 01:12:09,992
I think this physician and researcher
must be Gabriel.

1497
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:14,030
ONLY BELLA'S PROFESSION
IS LEFT UNDETERMINED

1501
01:12:24,106 --> 01:12:26,275
<i>...on the suspect information was correct.</i>

1502
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:27,577
- There we go!
- See?

1503
01:12:27,677 --> 01:12:29,345
- You were right.
- He's an actor.

1504
01:12:30,313 --> 01:12:34,483
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE
OBTAINED ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE

1505
01:12:35,751 --> 01:12:38,487
These photos are a treasure trove.

1506
01:12:39,155 --> 01:12:41,958
<i>I was convinced</i>
<i>the photos would give us key leads.</i>

1507
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:44,360
<i>When I studied them closely,</i>

1508
01:12:44,427 --> 01:12:47,563
<i>I noticed that focusing on items</i>
<i>placed on the trolley alone</i>

1509
01:12:47,663 --> 01:12:50,066
told us the basic timeline.

1510
01:12:50,299 --> 01:12:53,502
9 PHOTOS WITH THE TROLLEY

1511
01:12:55,171 --> 01:12:57,907
A CUP OF CHAMOMILE TEA ON THE TROLLEY

1512
01:12:58,841 --> 01:13:01,377
PHOTOS WHERE THE CUP IS FULL

1513
01:13:01,978 --> 01:13:04,881
PHOTOS WHERE THE CUP IS EMPTY

1514
01:13:05,081 --> 01:13:09,151
<i>We could get the perfect sequence</i>
<i>of events based on that alone.</i>

1515
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:13,022
ORDER OF EVENTS ARRANGED
BY THE CUP OF CHAMOMILE TEA

1516
01:13:21,163 --> 01:13:25,735
<i>I examined the photos alone</i>
<i>while my teammates reviewed the cards.</i>

1517
01:13:25,935 --> 01:13:30,339
<i>Then I shared the information I learned</i>
<i>with my teammates.</i>

1518
01:13:32,008 --> 01:13:33,809
Type in actor next to Frank.

1519
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:36,212
Edward is an actor, and so is Frank.

1520
01:13:37,046 --> 01:13:39,582
Why did we think
one of them had to be a manager?

1521
01:13:39,649 --> 01:13:42,084
<i>We believed</i>
<i>that one of the suspects was a manager,</i>

1522
01:13:42,485 --> 01:13:44,954
but we realized our mistake later on.

1523
01:13:45,054 --> 01:13:48,557
<i>The manager was only a recipient</i>
<i>of Edward's text messages.</i>

1524
01:13:49,392 --> 01:13:51,127
<i>We finally corrected our mistake.</i>

1525
01:13:51,227 --> 01:13:54,463
<i>Team SNU in STEM's submission</i>
<i>on the suspect information was correct.</i>

1526
01:13:54,563 --> 01:13:56,799
- See? That did the trick.
- Darn it.

1527
01:13:57,366 --> 01:13:59,402
No, it's okay. We can catch up with them.

1528
01:14:00,236 --> 01:14:03,739
One, eight, seven, five,
one, eight, seven, nine, hash.

1529
01:14:05,641 --> 01:14:07,076
We can still turn it around.

1530
01:14:07,143 --> 01:14:10,212
I'll place all the matched pairs
on this side.

1531
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:12,815
I think this happened first.

1532
01:14:12,915 --> 01:14:15,618
<i>- Frank and Edward's visit.</i>
<i>- How so? On what grounds?</i>

1533
01:14:15,685 --> 01:14:17,453
<i>First off...</i>

1534
01:14:18,054 --> 01:14:19,155
Dylan heard Gabriel's voice.

1535
01:14:19,255 --> 01:14:20,623
DYLAN SAID HE HEARD GABRIEL'S VOICE
IN ADAM'S ROOM

1536
01:14:20,690 --> 01:14:22,925
<i>That would be because Gabriel was inside.</i>

1537
01:14:22,992 --> 01:14:24,660
<i>- Dylan heard Gabriel's voice?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

1538
01:14:25,094 --> 01:14:27,396
<i>So he decided to leave the items outside.</i>

1539
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:28,531
<i>Then, Gabriel came out.</i>

1540
01:14:28,631 --> 01:14:29,966
GABRIEL THE PHYSICIAN LEFT ADAM'S CABIN

1541
01:14:30,066 --> 01:14:30,866
In this exact sequence.

1542
01:14:30,967 --> 01:14:32,068
<i>The actors went in. Frank left.</i>

1543
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:34,103
<i>Gabriel went in as Edward left.</i>
<i>Then, he left.</i>

1544
01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:36,973
<i>To explain the trolley,</i>
<i>Dylan should've come before Gabriel left.</i>

1545
01:14:39,809 --> 01:14:42,545
Let's remove the unlikely suspects.
Frank couldn't have done it.

1546
01:14:42,645 --> 01:14:44,080
<i>He returned to his cabin.</i>

1547
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:45,614
WHEN EDWARD ASKED FOR PRIVACY,
FRANK RETURNED TO HIS CABIN

1548
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:48,451
- The YouTuber didn't do it, either.
- No?

1549
01:14:48,517 --> 01:14:49,452
Adam was still alive.

1550
01:14:50,119 --> 01:14:51,287
<i>Hey, that's right.</i>

1551
01:14:51,354 --> 01:14:52,254
<i>He was alive.</i>

1552
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:53,856
ADAM PLACED THE EMPTY CUP ON THE TROLLEY
AFTER JENNIFER LEFT

1553
01:14:53,956 --> 01:14:55,858
Dylan can't have done it, either.

1554
01:14:55,958 --> 01:14:58,694
<i>No one answered the door,</i>
<i>so he didn't enter the cabin.</i>

1555
01:14:59,862 --> 01:15:04,100
DYLAN, JENNIFER, AND FRANK ARE EXCLUDED

1556
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:05,501
One thing's for certain.

1557
01:15:05,568 --> 01:15:08,838
Adam was alive until Dylan returned
to collect the trolley.

1558
01:15:08,904 --> 01:15:11,040
- That's true.
- He was seen leaving his cup outside.

1559
01:15:11,841 --> 01:15:15,111
GABRIEL IS EXCLUDED BECAUSE HE LEFT
BEFORE THE TROLLEY WAS REMOVED

1560
01:15:15,678 --> 01:15:18,681
GABRIEL IS EXCLUDED

1561
01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:21,984
Don't you think Adam's face
could be deep purple from suffocation?

1562
01:15:22,051 --> 01:15:23,119
It makes sense, no?

1563
01:15:23,719 --> 01:15:28,124
THE CAUSE OF DEATH WAS ASPHYXIATION

1564
01:15:28,557 --> 01:15:30,726
That's a match.

1565
01:15:30,826 --> 01:15:32,661
- He must've died around 11:05 p.m.
- Around 11:05 p.m.?

1566
01:15:32,728 --> 01:15:34,563
That's when someone lowered
the oxygen level to 10%.

1567
01:15:34,663 --> 01:15:37,400
By the way, who adjusted the oxygen level?

1568
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:41,037
"Only the engineers verified by biometrics
can make remote adjustments."

1569
01:15:41,137 --> 01:15:42,738
Wasn't Bella the engineer?

1570
01:15:42,838 --> 01:15:44,006
<i>Can she have done it?</i>

1571
01:15:44,073 --> 01:15:46,842
DID BELLA THE ENGINEER MURDER ADAM?

1572
01:15:46,909 --> 01:15:49,578
What happens
when the oxygen level is lowered?

1573
01:15:49,678 --> 01:15:51,047
People die.

1574
01:15:51,147 --> 01:15:53,315
When the oxygen level goes below 10%...

1575
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:56,185
See? If that state continues
for ten minutes, people die.

1576
01:15:56,252 --> 01:15:57,787
That should last for at least ten minutes.

1577
01:15:58,354 --> 01:16:00,623
Okay, here's my take.

1578
01:16:00,723 --> 01:16:02,691
Someone lowered
the oxygen level at 11:05 p.m.

1579
01:16:02,758 --> 01:16:05,227
<i>The emergency lamp lit up</i>
<i>because of the solar flare at 11:10 p.m.,</i>

1580
01:16:05,327 --> 01:16:08,597
<i>- so the tampering occurred before that.</i>
<i>- Oh, then it couldn't have killed him.</i>

1581
01:16:08,964 --> 01:16:12,435
Once the emergency light is on,
all cabin settings are reset.

1582
01:16:12,535 --> 01:16:15,805
When that happens,
the oxygen level returns to 21%.

1583
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:19,208
There is no way the oxygen level
remained low for more than ten minutes.

1584
01:16:19,275 --> 01:16:21,210
Low oxygen level
wasn't the cause of death.

1585
01:16:21,277 --> 01:16:25,648
SOMETHING OTHER THAN THE LOW OXYGEN LEVEL
CAUSED ADAM'S ASPHYXIATION

1586
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:27,383
My money is on Harry.

1587
01:16:27,450 --> 01:16:28,584
- The killer?
- Yes.

1588
01:16:28,651 --> 01:16:30,719
- Why?
- I'm not sure yet. Give me a minute.

1589
01:16:31,387 --> 01:16:33,656
Harry's movements are
too disconnected from the other events.

1590
01:16:33,756 --> 01:16:36,659
I know. There is no lead
pinpointing when he came or left.

1591
01:16:36,926 --> 01:16:40,229
NO OTHER PEOPLE OR ITEMS
ARE SHOWN IN HARRY'S PHOTOS

1592
01:16:40,296 --> 01:16:43,099
<i>Team SKKU's submission...</i>

1593
01:16:46,635 --> 01:16:48,070
<i>on the culprit...</i>

1594
01:16:49,772 --> 01:16:51,841
<i>was correct.</i>

1595
01:16:53,909 --> 01:16:56,779
Did Adam die
because of the low oxygen level?

1596
01:16:56,846 --> 01:16:57,780
No.

1597
01:16:57,847 --> 01:17:00,216
Someone snuffed the life out of him.

1598
01:17:00,282 --> 01:17:01,851
<i>Adam fought back.</i>

1599
01:17:01,951 --> 01:17:05,688
<i>We know he managed to scratch the killer</i>
<i>from the blood under his nail.</i>

1600
01:17:05,788 --> 01:17:08,824
We should take a closer look
at the injured people.

1601
01:17:08,924 --> 01:17:11,627
<i>Those with a visible scar</i>
<i>are Edward, Harry, and Bella.</i>

1602
01:17:11,694 --> 01:17:13,996
3 SUSPECTS WITH A SCAR

1603
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:16,832
Edward met the physician at 10:50 p.m.

1604
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:19,635
He couldn't have been hurt by Adam.

1605
01:17:19,702 --> 01:17:24,773
EDWARD IS EXCLUDED AS HE LEFT THE CABIN
WHEN ADAM WAS STILL ALIVE

1606
01:17:25,007 --> 01:17:27,643
The killer was inside Adam's cabin.

1607
01:17:27,710 --> 01:17:31,046
BELLA THE ENGINEER
NEVER CAME OUT OF ADAM'S CABIN

1608
01:17:31,147 --> 01:17:33,682
<i>When we removed suspects</i>
<i>from our pool one by one,</i>

1609
01:17:33,782 --> 01:17:34,984
<i>only Harry remained.</i>

1610
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:36,585
SOLE REMAINING SUSPECT WITH A SCAR
HARRY THE MYSTERY WRITER

1611
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:38,621
HARRY VISITED ADAM AT 10:55 P.M.

1612
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:40,022
ADAM WASN'T HURT BEFORE HE MET HARRY

1613
01:17:40,122 --> 01:17:41,490
<i>Harry had to be our guy.</i>

1614
01:17:43,259 --> 01:17:45,494
Not everyone has an alibi,

1615
01:17:45,594 --> 01:17:47,963
but based on the evidence,
only Harry fits the bill.

1616
01:17:48,464 --> 01:17:50,733
- Let's submit our answer.
- Okay, I'll do it.

1617
01:17:52,168 --> 01:17:53,369
Please be right.

1618
01:17:53,469 --> 01:17:54,637
WHO IS THE CULPRIT?
HARRY

1619
01:17:56,472 --> 01:17:57,873
<i>Team SKKU's submission...</i>

1620
01:17:58,841 --> 01:18:02,178
<i>on the culprit was correct.</i>

1621
01:18:02,278 --> 01:18:04,914
TEAM SKKU IS THE FIRST
TO APPREHEND THE CULPRIT

1622
01:18:05,014 --> 01:18:07,816
IT TOOK THEM 41 MINUTES AND 37 SECONDS

1623
01:18:07,883 --> 01:18:09,451
- Good job.
- What the heck, Tae-hun?

1624
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:11,654
- My gosh, Tae-hun...
- You're our hidden ace.

1625
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:13,556
You were amazing. Kudos.

1626
01:18:13,656 --> 01:18:17,226
<i>I think the four of us</i>
<i>can take on any team</i>

1627
01:18:17,326 --> 01:18:19,929
in games where all members participate.

1628
01:18:20,029 --> 01:18:21,764
The culprit has to be Harry.

1629
01:18:21,864 --> 01:18:23,566
- Why?
- Consider the timeline.

1630
01:18:23,666 --> 01:18:26,735
I think we got the timeline correctly.
This far, that is.

1631
01:18:26,835 --> 01:18:28,337
<i>Only Harry was seen leaving Adam's cabin.</i>

1632
01:18:28,404 --> 01:18:30,339
<i>After that, there was no time</i>
<i>for anyone to go back in.</i>

1633
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:32,675
<i>The emergency light turned on</i>
<i>at 11:10 p.m.</i>

1634
01:18:32,741 --> 01:18:34,376
HARRY LEFT BEFORE 11:10 P.M.

1635
01:18:34,476 --> 01:18:36,478
- Do we type in Harry?
- Yes, we've got to.

1636
01:18:36,545 --> 01:18:38,547
Team SKKU up and did it,
and our guys will need more time.

1637
01:18:38,647 --> 01:18:39,648
I'll go with Harry.

1638
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:41,050
SUBMITTED HARRY AS THE CULPRIT

1639
01:18:41,116 --> 01:18:42,685
Oh, please. Let's pray, guys.

1640
01:18:42,751 --> 01:18:47,656
<i>Team KAIST's submission on the culprit</i>

1641
01:18:48,090 --> 01:18:49,325
<i>was correct.</i>

1642
01:18:49,391 --> 01:18:51,694
TEAM KAIST APPREHENDED THE CULPRIT

1643
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:55,764
THEY TOOK 46 MINUTES AND 25 SECONDS,
ROUGHLY 5 MINUTES MORE THAN TEAM SKKU

1644
01:18:57,666 --> 01:18:59,935
- Good job, Team KAIST.
- They're fast.

1645
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:02,705
Team SNU in Medicine
has to beat the other Team SNU.

1646
01:19:02,771 --> 01:19:04,206
If Team SNU in STEM finishes first,

1647
01:19:04,273 --> 01:19:05,941
our guys have to follow
in less than five minutes.

1648
01:19:06,041 --> 01:19:07,142
That's right.

1649
01:19:07,243 --> 01:19:09,245
Let's hope for Team SNU in STEM's success.

1650
01:19:09,345 --> 01:19:10,446
Come on, guys.

1651
01:19:12,147 --> 01:19:14,350
We have to pray for Team SNU in Medicine.

1652
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:16,986
They'll do fine.

1653
01:19:17,886 --> 01:19:20,222
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE VS TEAM SNU IN STEM

1654
01:19:20,623 --> 01:19:22,458
Shall I gather the cards with time?

1655
01:19:22,558 --> 01:19:24,927
Collect all the cards
that have numbers on them.

1656
01:19:24,994 --> 01:19:27,596
According to these,
Adam always replied within five minutes.

1657
01:19:27,696 --> 01:19:30,299
When Adam was still around,
he would reply to any messages

1658
01:19:30,399 --> 01:19:33,302
- No reply suggests...
- within five minutes.

1659
01:19:33,402 --> 01:19:34,737
These are also important.

1660
01:19:34,803 --> 01:19:36,772
Bella received an answer
to her 11 p.m. text.

1661
01:19:36,839 --> 01:19:38,974
That means Adam was still alive at 11 p.m.

1662
01:19:39,642 --> 01:19:43,779
"Blood likely belonging to the culprit..."
That must be the culprit's.

1663
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:45,781
We have to know more about this blood.

1664
01:19:45,848 --> 01:19:47,149
Who got injured earlier?

1665
01:19:47,249 --> 01:19:48,584
Someone bled, didn't they?

1666
01:19:48,651 --> 01:19:50,619
- Who was it?
- Harry.

1667
01:19:50,853 --> 01:19:53,489
Harry is probably the one
who entered the cabin last.

1668
01:19:53,822 --> 01:19:55,424
My gut says he did it.

1669
01:19:55,491 --> 01:19:57,760
- It's very likely.
- Let's try our luck.

1670
01:19:58,594 --> 01:20:00,429
- What if he did it?
- Hang on!

1671
01:20:00,496 --> 01:20:03,565
HAN SEO-YEON AND JOO MIN-SEO POINT
THE SAME PERSON AT THE SAME TIME

1672
01:20:03,632 --> 01:20:06,001
We don't know when he left.

1673
01:20:06,101 --> 01:20:09,338
He's the only person who could've been
in Adam's cabin in the time window.

1674
01:20:09,438 --> 01:20:10,973
It's Harry.

1675
01:20:11,273 --> 01:20:12,775
- Murder solved!
- I think you got it.

1676
01:20:12,841 --> 01:20:14,276
- I'll go with Harry.
- Do it.

1677
01:20:14,610 --> 01:20:16,111
- Tell me what to do.
- Do it!

1678
01:20:16,178 --> 01:20:17,479
Okay. One, two, three.

1679
01:20:17,579 --> 01:20:18,414
CULPRIT'S NAME SUBMITTED

1680
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:21,483
Let's go with Harry. If it's not him,
we'll accept the Deathmatch.

1681
01:20:22,318 --> 01:20:25,054
CULPRIT'S NAME SUBMITTED

1682
01:20:25,154 --> 01:20:28,223
Suppose Harry is our killer.
What's his motive?

1683
01:20:28,791 --> 01:20:30,059
- What's his motive?
- I wonder.

1684
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:31,994
Same. That's what I'm dying to know.

1685
01:20:33,796 --> 01:20:34,697
Here's an idea.

1686
01:20:34,797 --> 01:20:37,833
Harry's bestselling book
was based on a murder case.

1687
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:40,636
- What if he's an actual murderer?
- Yeah, exactly.

1688
01:20:41,203 --> 01:20:43,539
So his novel was based on a true crime?

1689
01:20:43,639 --> 01:20:46,342
Yes, but he'd be the one
carrying out the crimes.

1690
01:20:46,442 --> 01:20:50,813
He told his editor that the manuscript
would be ready after his trip.

1691
01:20:50,879 --> 01:20:52,147
He's a nutjob.

1692
01:20:52,214 --> 01:20:55,150
- Yes, he's a weirdo.
- Right. He assured his editor, see?

1693
01:20:55,217 --> 01:20:58,253
<i>That concludes Signal Investigation 3.</i>

1694
01:20:58,354 --> 01:21:00,456
CULPRIT APPREHENDED

1695
01:21:00,522 --> 01:21:02,891
<i>The result will now be announced.</i>

1696
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:06,628
<i>Team SKKU apprehended the culprit</i>

1697
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:08,731
<i>in 41 minutes and 37 seconds.</i>

1698
01:21:10,366 --> 01:21:12,901
<i>Team KAIST apprehended the culprit</i>

1699
01:21:13,001 --> 01:21:14,937
<i>in 46 minutes and 25 seconds.</i>

1700
01:21:17,673 --> 01:21:21,110
<i>Team SNU in Medicine and Team SNU in STEM</i>

1701
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:22,745
<i>apprehended the culprit.</i>

1702
01:21:23,345 --> 01:21:24,646
<i>Now, for the final results.</i>

1703
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:28,016
<i>Medical Division</i>
<i>took 99 minutes and 8 seconds in total.</i>

1704
01:21:28,083 --> 01:21:29,251
<i>STEM Division...</i>

1705
01:21:33,188 --> 01:21:34,390
<i>STEM Division</i>

1706
01:21:34,490 --> 01:21:36,558
<i>took 106 minutes and 36 seconds in total.</i>

1707
01:21:37,126 --> 01:21:39,762
<i>Medical Division won the match.</i>

1708
01:21:39,862 --> 01:21:41,530
MEDICAL DIVISION
WINS SIGNAL INVESTIGATION 3

1709
01:21:41,597 --> 01:21:42,664
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE
57:31

1710
01:21:42,731 --> 01:21:43,766
TEAM SKKU
41:37

1711
01:21:43,866 --> 01:21:44,900
TEAM SNU IN STEM
60:11

1712
01:21:44,967 --> 01:21:46,034
TEAM KAIST
46:25

1713
01:21:46,235 --> 01:21:49,271
<i>Team SKKU managed to deliver</i>
<i>good performances back-to-back.</i>

1714
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:51,507
<i>That filled me with pride.</i>

1715
01:21:52,107 --> 01:21:55,244
<i>I thought it was such a relief</i>
<i>to have Team SKKU in my division.</i>

1716
01:21:55,544 --> 01:21:59,214
<i>I was pleased</i>
<i>that my team survived another day.</i>

1717
01:21:59,381 --> 01:22:04,253
<i>In light of STEM Division's defeat,</i>
<i>Team SNU in STEM and Team KAIST,</i>

1718
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:07,423
<i>please prepare for the Deathmatch.</i>

1719
01:22:09,958 --> 01:22:12,060
We lost face to Team KAIST big time.

1720
01:22:12,995 --> 01:22:15,130
<i>If we had apprehended the culprit</i>
<i>faster than Team SKKU,</i>

1721
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:18,434
<i>we could've advanced</i>
<i>regardless of Team SNU in STEM's results.</i>

1722
01:22:18,534 --> 01:22:21,003
<i>It's such a shame we hadn't.</i>

1723
01:22:21,537 --> 01:22:23,338
<i>We promised</i>
<i>to advance to the finals together.</i>

1724
01:22:23,439 --> 01:22:25,474
<i>It was heartbreaking</i>
<i>to see our dream shatter.</i>

1725
01:22:25,574 --> 01:22:29,945
<i>But I told myself that the experience</i>
<i>of the Deathmatch would strengthen us.</i>

1726
01:22:31,079 --> 01:22:32,948
<i>Today's Deathmatch is</i>

1727
01:22:33,015 --> 01:22:35,017
<i>Lucky 21.</i>

1728
01:22:35,117 --> 01:22:36,251
<i>It's a memorization game.</i>

1729
01:22:36,318 --> 01:22:37,619
Let's go get them.

1730
01:22:38,187 --> 01:22:40,022
<i>We have to carry the torch</i>
<i>for STEM Division.</i>

1731
01:22:40,122 --> 01:22:42,825
<i>KAIST is the best in STEM.</i>
<i>We can't lose this match.</i>

1732
01:22:43,258 --> 01:22:44,259
Excuse me.

1733
01:22:44,593 --> 01:22:45,961
We're splitting the prize, remember?

1734
01:22:47,963 --> 01:22:49,565
<i>Why does Team KAIST look so relaxed?</i>

1735
01:22:49,832 --> 01:22:52,334
<i>They've experienced this before.</i>

1736
01:22:52,434 --> 01:22:54,670
- We can win and be done with it.
- Sure.

1737
01:22:54,770 --> 01:22:57,506
We'll now begin Round 1 of the Deathmatch.

1738
01:22:57,606 --> 01:22:58,907
<i>The match we've been waiting for.</i>

1739
01:23:00,209 --> 01:23:01,677
- I'll obtain it.
- I'll take a pass.

1740
01:23:02,778 --> 01:23:04,913
<i>I'm a wreck now. I can't stand this.</i>

1741
01:23:05,147 --> 01:23:06,114
Hang on.

1742
01:23:07,149 --> 01:23:07,983
What was that?

1743
01:23:08,050 --> 01:23:09,318
I guess something went wrong.

1744
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:11,019
<i>That was a mistake.</i>

1745
01:23:11,119 --> 01:23:12,287
I'll obtain it.
