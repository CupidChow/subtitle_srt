1
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:30,155
<i>The losing teams of the main match,</i>
<i>Team KAIST and Team SNU in STEM,</i>

2
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:33,575
<i>will now begin today's Deathmatch.</i>

3
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:36,036
It's time we got a bit of action.

4
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:39,039
Let's focus on keeping our cool, guys.

5
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:42,584
<i>Team KAIST got dragged</i>
<i>into the Deathmatch because of us,</i>

6
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,878
<i>despite coming in second,</i>

7
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:48,298
<i>so I felt like we owed them</i>
<i>for falling behind.</i>

8
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:52,803
<i>But in a Deathmatch,</i>
<i>there's no room for such sentimentality.</i>

9
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:55,013
All right.

10
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:59,393
<i>I'd be lying</i>
<i>if I said I don't blame them.</i>

11
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:04,189
<i>But I'd rather take this as a chance</i>
<i>to prove that KAIST is the best in STEM.</i>

12
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,525
<i>Today's Deathmatch is...</i>

13
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:11,613
<i>Lucky 21.</i>

14
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:12,698
Lucky 21?

15
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,658
- Will it involve numbers?
- Probably.

16
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,785
- Sounds like blackjack, no?
- Yeah.

17
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,787
The goal in that game
is to get 21 points as well.

18
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:23,834
<i>In Lucky 21,</i>
<i>you will be presented with a 7-by-7 board.</i>

19
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:27,379
<i>You will be given time</i>
<i>to memorize the 49 numbered tiles</i>

20
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:30,382
<i>and then take turns to obtain them.</i>

21
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:36,221
<i>Your task is to make a set of 3 tiles</i>
<i>that add up to 21 to earn points.</i>

22
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:38,765
It's a memorization game.

23
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,810
<i>Jong-yun has an edge in memorization.</i>

24
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,980
ACED THE MEMORIZATION QUIZ IN THE PRE-TEST
<i>I felt certain I would win.</i>

25
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:50,027
<i>The numbered tiles include</i>
<i>special tiles and basic tiles.</i>

26
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,154
<i>The special tiles include</i>
<i>the number 7 tiles</i>

27
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,281
<i>and the ones marked with a clover.</i>

28
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:59,578
<i>There are 4 tiles of the number 7</i>
<i>and 7 tiles marked with a clover.</i>

29
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:03,290
<i>The remaining 38 tiles are the basic ones.</i>

30
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,710
They named it "lucky"
because of the clover.

31
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,587
<i>During the match,</i>

32
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,673
<i>only the backside of the tiles</i>
<i>will be displayed.</i>

33
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:15,802
<i>At the outset, one game piece</i>
<i>will be placed in the center of the board.</i>

34
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:18,347
<i>You can move the piece</i>

35
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,433
WITHIN THE 30-SECOND LIMIT
<i>up to 3 cells at your turn.</i>

36
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:25,937
<i>But the first player can move it</i>
<i>only one cell on their initial turn.</i>

37
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:30,025
<i>Additionally, you cannot reverse</i>
<i>your opponent's previous move,</i>

38
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:32,861
<i>or move the piece diagonally.</i>

39
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,280
<i>Once the piece reaches your destination,</i>

40
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:38,950
<i>you must perform</i>
<i>one of the following four actions.</i>

41
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:40,786
<i>Your first option is "checking."</i>

42
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,579
<i>If you ask for checking,</i>

43
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:45,707
<i>the tile's number will be shown</i>
<i>to you and your opponent.</i>

44
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:49,753
<i>Then it will be returned to its place</i>
<i>with the backside showing.</i>

45
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,713
They should avoid that option, right?

46
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:53,965
You see it together,
so that should be your final resort.

47
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:57,010
If you're good enough,
you won't ask for that option.

48
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:59,012
Yes, if you're good enough.

49
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:00,847
<i>Your second option is "obtaining."</i>

50
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,017
<i>You can obtain the tile</i>
<i>once the piece reaches its stop.</i>

51
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:08,271
<i>You can only keep</i>
<i>up to four tiles at a time.</i>

52
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,483
What happens if you get more?

53
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:14,486
<i>Your third option is "discarding."</i>

54
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,571
Oh, so that's an option.

55
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:19,032
<i>You can take the piece</i>
<i>to a cell without a tile</i>

56
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:23,036
<i>and discard one of the tiles</i>
<i>in your possession.</i>

57
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:26,081
- That changes the layout.
- Right.

58
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:28,041
That's wild.

59
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:31,211
If the other guy takes a tile from here
and discards it over there,

60
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:34,214
- that changes the whole setup.
- This reminds me of Match and Mix.

61
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,549
GAME FROM SEASON 1

62
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,843
The board keeps changing
from the one in your memory.

63
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,387
<i>Your fourth option is "taking a pass."</i>

64
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:45,600
<i>You can choose not to do anything</i>
<i>and complete your turn.</i>

65
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:47,602
<i>Proceed with the game</i>

66
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:50,981
<i>until the sum of 3 tiles</i>
<i>in your possession reaches 21.</i>

67
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:54,359
<i>Then, you can log the set.</i>

68
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:57,863
<i>You win one point</i>
<i>if your set consists of the basic tiles.</i>

69
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,991
<i>If your set is a trio of Tile 7s</i>

70
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,493
<i>or a trio of clover tiles,</i>

71
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,996
<i>you win two points.</i>

72
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,916
<i>If your set contains</i>
<i>both basic and special tiles,</i>

73
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,252
<i>you win one point.</i>

74
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:15,046
<i>Keep winning points</i>
<i>by logging suitable sets.</i>

75
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:20,218
<i>The first to secure four points</i>
<i>wins the round.</i>

76
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:22,262
Your priority should be Tile 7s.

77
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:25,807
You can double the point
with a set of special tiles.

78
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:28,977
It might not be a bad idea
to memorize just the special tiles.

79
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,562
That's one possible strategy.

80
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:33,523
Suppose you take the tiles
and log your sets non-stop.

81
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,150
Two-pointers will get you a quicker win.

82
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:39,738
If a player obtains two Tile 7s,
the other has to claim the remaining ones.

83
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,448
Otherwise, they lose two points.

84
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,159
<i>You can make</i>
<i>one special request per round,</i>

85
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:47,329
<i>either the "Move 5 Cells" card</i>
<i>or the "Discard 1 Tile" card.</i>

86
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:50,457
<i>The choice is up to you.</i>

87
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:55,378
<i>If you use the Move 5 Cells card,</i>
<i>you can move the piece up to 5 cells.</i>

88
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,839
<i>If you use the Discard 1 Tile card,</i>

89
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:00,634
<i>you can place the tile</i>
<i>on any empty cell of your choice</i>

90
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,761
<i>without consuming your turn.</i>

91
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:03,804
That may be more helpful.

92
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:06,181
You can discard a tile
when the sum isn't 21.

93
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,517
<i>There will be three rounds in total.</i>

94
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:12,479
<i>Rounds 1 and 2 require different players,</i>
<i>but anyone can participate in Round 3.</i>

95
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,397
- Let's go get them.
- All right.

96
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:15,941
Your time has come.

97
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,859
Good luck.

98
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:22,572
<i>As Team KAIST apprehended the culprit</i>
<i>in Signal Investigation 3 in less time,</i>

99
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:27,077
<i>they will decide which team goes first.</i>

100
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,871
<i>Both teams,</i>
<i>please start discussing your strategies.</i>

101
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:32,541
<i>You'll be given 20 minutes.</i>

102
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:36,002
<i>Hit me up with ideas.</i>

103
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:37,587
Should we go first or second?

104
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:41,132
If we go first,
we'll literally get one more tile.

105
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:43,677
Can we make them go first
and take a Tile 7 on our turn?

106
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,428
- You want us to go second?
- Yes.

107
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:49,599
If you think about it,
the best tile to secure first is a Tile 7.

108
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,226
- For sure.
- With three Tile 7s,

109
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:54,437
we can get ahead with two points
even if they win a point first.

110
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:58,608
So one option is to lock in,
memorize their locations, and secure them.

111
00:05:58,692 --> 00:05:59,526
Suppose we go second.

112
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,444
Can we guarantee a Tile 7
with the Move 5 Cells card?

113
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:02,362
You got a point.

114
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,364
- That's right up my alley.
- Great.

115
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:05,949
Being on the offensive.

116
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,826
It's very aggressive.
I love that about it.

117
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,078
Let me sum it up for you, Jong-yun.

118
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,913
Crush their spirits
with your great memory.

119
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:13,665
There's no need to overthink it.

120
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:14,833
All right.

121
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,419
You've got a brilliant memory, anyway.

122
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:20,046
<i>Memorizing the board</i>
<i>was central to the game.</i>

123
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,673
There was a movable game piece,

124
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:26,761
but whoever memorized the 49-tile board
was set to win the match.

125
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:30,056
<i>By design, Jong-yun would excel</i>
<i>because of his amazing memory.</i>

126
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,018
It seemed like the perfect chance
for Jong-yun to shine.

127
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,520
I've trained myself
with the mind palace technique.

128
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:38,148
By using this method, I was able
to memorize the 40 double-digit numbers

129
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,358
in under five minutes on the pre-test.

130
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:45,780
I think I'm the best at memorization
out of the remaining eight contestants.

131
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:49,075
My strategy is to memorize the whole board
so I don't need to check any tiles.

132
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,703
I'll use all of my 30 seconds
to make my opponent's memory fade.

133
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:55,373
That's the best game plan
if that doesn't affect your memory.

134
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:57,042
What technique do you use again?

135
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,877
A photographic memory
or creating a sequence?

136
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,046
Basically, I turn the information
into a sequence.

137
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,714
How? By making up a story?

138
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:03,757
Yes.

139
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,760
I have five compartments in my mind.

140
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,929
If I want to know the number here,

141
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:12,015
I would retrieve it from my memory
by visiting the mental space it is in.

142
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,433
To speed up the process,

143
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,893
I would link the physical location

144
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,979
with my mental compartment
housing that information.

145
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:20,649
I'll need to use all 30 seconds anyway,

146
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:23,818
and during that time,
my opponent would forget bits and pieces.

147
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,695
Any tips on memorizing efficiently?

148
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:29,324
- That's the key.
- It sure is.

149
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,869
Memorization...

150
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:38,959
Let's say we manage to get a Tile 7
by taking advantage of going second.

151
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,378
Find pairs whose sum reaches 14 or 21
during the memorization time

152
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,089
and hold on to their coordinates,
not the individual numbers.

153
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,758
So our top priority
is the locations of Tile 7s,

154
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,843
followed by the locations of pairs
that add up to 14?

155
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,762
Just their locations
without the exact numbers.

156
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:53,056
We can use these pairs
unless they take one of the tiles.

157
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:56,977
Initially, I thought memorization
would be the most important aspect.

158
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,604
But as you know, there is a limit
to how much you can remember.

159
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:03,233
So I needed a foolproof plan to win,
even if my memory wasn't the best.

160
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:06,111
Memorizing by pairs seems effective.

161
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,487
When you have a pair's location

162
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,782
but end up having to check
because you feel unsure,

163
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,618
you learn about 2 tiles
while your opponent only learns of 1.

164
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:14,786
Oh, that's true.

165
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:18,790
If memorization isn't their forte,
their focus will be on the special tiles.

166
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:22,293
We should obtain them first
to disrupt their game plan

167
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:24,629
and hopefully score two points on our end.

168
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:26,089
Here's an idea.

169
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,757
Don't make it your goal

170
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,342
- to get two-point sets.
- That's the key.

171
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:31,136
But you should still
try to get special tiles.

172
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,471
You can always complete your set
with a suitable basic tile.

173
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:36,266
We can then prevent Team KAIST
from scoring two points

174
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,269
- and win 4 times with 1 pointers.
- With steady progress.

175
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,896
If the round drags on,
they'll have to check the tiles.

176
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,733
I can go over what I've memorized
as they spend their 30 seconds.

177
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:47,277
- I must prolong the game to win.
- Yeah.

178
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,487
Any volunteers?

179
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:51,698
My gut tells me this is your thing.

180
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,742
- I guess I can do it.
- Good.

181
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:55,326
Anyone else?

182
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,245
I don't think
memorization will be so difficult.

183
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,873
You mean when you memorize by pairs,
as we discussed?

184
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:00,790
No, the whole board.

185
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,292
- Really?
- Yeah.

186
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,294
I can't say how long I'll remember,

187
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,962
but I think I can manage that
at the start.

188
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,757
- I'll win Round 1 for us.
- Yes, do that.

189
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,592
Want to take on Round 2, Ji-hoo?

190
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:14,804
Team SNU in STEM will send in
Mr. Chess Player and Mr. Hunter.

191
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:15,805
Well, probably.

192
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,516
I can see Mr. Hunter on their roster.

193
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,560
I mean, Dong-geon.

194
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:23,146
They did great in the pre-test.

195
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,190
They took most of the top four spots.

196
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,941
- In STEM Division.
- Yes, exactly.

197
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:28,568
Hey, hang on.

198
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,154
- That doesn't matter.
- Of course not.

199
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,491
You bet. I can take them.

200
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,952
I think we'll win.
I've got a good feeling about this.

201
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:41,039
- Wait, who's playing in Round 2?
- You guys can sort that out.

202
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,416
I'll take on Round 3
if Round 1 doesn't turn into a disaster.

203
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,668
- I can give it a go.
- Go for it if you'd like.

204
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:49,172
Wait, will you be using the same strategy?

205
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,716
- I'll decide after--
- He's going to memorize everything.

206
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,929
I'll memorize the tiles on the border.
They won't want the piece over there.

207
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:59,432
<i>I thought it was very unlikely</i>
<i>they'd memorize the border tiles.</i>

208
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:04,854
Since we could move up to three cells,
I could reach the border from any point.

209
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,022
I could keep up to four tiles.

210
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:09,025
Even if I had to pick up tiles
from the section I hadn't memorized,

211
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,736
I could find a suitable tile
from tapping into my memory

212
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,030
and complete a set that adds up to 21.

213
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:17,283
I thought this would give me
more freedom to maneuver the piece.

214
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,202
Hey, that's pretty good.

215
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,121
I'll memorize these parts only.

216
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:23,414
Can you get to the border from any point?

217
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:27,043
Of course. The nearest border cell
will always be within three cells.

218
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:27,961
That's true.

219
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,088
- What if you get crushed?
- Come on.

220
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,965
I'm going to blindside them.

221
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,050
A surprise tactic does sound promising.

222
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:37,846
Everyone else will focus on the center
because the piece will keep crossing it.

223
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:41,099
If I'm going second, I'll be okay
with the border and the special tiles.

224
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,726
Let's mull it over as we watch Round 1.

225
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,354
<i>The time for strategy meeting is up.</i>

226
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:49,065
You're going to be unbeatable.
Go out there with confidence.

227
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,067
- I can take them.
- Just be yourself.

228
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:54,112
You're not stressed, right?
You've got this. This is your forte.

229
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,697
I need to deliver here.

230
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,823
I know I've got to.

231
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:58,741
- SNU!
- For independence!

232
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,660
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

233
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:04,497
DEATHMATCH
LUCKY 21

234
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:08,877
We will now begin
the Deathmatch, Lucky 21.

235
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:12,338
Players competing in Round 1
are Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min

236
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:15,717
and Team SNU in STEM's Han Jong-yun.

237
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,886
Please come to the stage.

238
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,808
Let's have a good game.

239
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:30,148
As Team KAIST
held a higher rank in the main match,

240
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,233
their player will decide who goes first.

241
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:36,279
Please make your choice.

242
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:39,157
I'll go second.

243
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,243
Team KAIST chose to go second.

244
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,496
Here is your board for Lucky 21.

245
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,999
You'll be given four minutes to memorize.

246
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:09,646
It's best to get Clover Tile 11.

247
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,773
That will play a critical role.

248
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,192
<i>You can pair it with 8-2, 6-4, or 9-1.</i>

249
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:17,028
WITH CLOVER TILE 11,
YOU CAN MAKE 3 SETS THAT ADD UP TO 21

250
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,244
The time for memorization is over.

251
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:28,456
Team SNU in STEM's Han Jong-yun
will go first.

252
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:31,501
You can only move one cell
in your initial turn.

253
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,212
Please move the piece.

254
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:41,177
AS PLANNED, HAN JONG-YUN TAKES HIS TIME

255
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,888
You have ten seconds left.

256
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,142
I'll obtain the tile.

257
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:54,190
HAN JONG-YUN:
CLOVER 8

258
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,443
He claimed Clover Tile 8.
He can make a 2-pointer set with 9 and 4.

259
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:01,406
Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min.
Please move the piece.

260
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,786
I'll obtain the tile.

261
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,543
Smart move.
That Clover Tile 11 will be pivotal.

262
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,296
BOTH PLAYERS SECURED ONE CLOVER TILE EACH

263
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:20,300
Team SNU in STEM's Han Jong-yun.
Please move the piece.

264
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:29,225
You have ten seconds left.

265
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,396
I'll obtain the tile.

266
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,194
Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min.
Please move the piece.

267
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,241
I'll obtain the tile.

268
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,620
OBTAINED TILE 7, A SPECIAL TILE

269
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,957
FROM CLOVER TILES TO TILE 7S
He must've changed his target.

270
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:56,794
Team SNU in STEM's Han Jong-yun.
Please move the piece.

271
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:02,342
You have ten seconds left.

272
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,761
I'll obtain the tile.

273
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:09,724
HAN JONG-YUN:
CLOVER 8, 5, 9

274
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,977
Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min.
Please move the piece.

275
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:17,440
I'll obtain the tile.

276
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,442
That's a Tile 7.

277
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,616
JEON JI-MIN:
7, 7, CLOVER 11

278
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,618
<i>He knows Tile 7s' exact locations.</i>

279
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,788
LOCATIONS OF THE REMAINING TILE 7S

280
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,832
The other Tile 7s are too far away.

281
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,959
He has to take the piece downward.

282
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,671
I doubt Jong-yun will let him do that.

283
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:45,468
You have ten seconds left.

284
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,184
I'll obtain the tile.

285
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,607
What was that?

286
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,234
He took that tile?

287
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,985
That has 14 on it.

288
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:07,907
THE SUM DOESN'T REACH 21

289
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:12,453
<i>I got concerned because Jong-yun</i>
<i>seemed noticeably nervous.</i>

290
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:15,498
Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min.
Please move the piece.

291
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,795
I'll take a pass.

292
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:24,048
- Where is another Tile 7?
- In the border.

293
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:26,551
It's on the lower right side.

294
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,846
JONG-YUN CAN SECURE A TILE 7 IN 1 TURN

295
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,890
Team SNU in STEM's Han Jong-yun.
Please move the piece.

296
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:33,850
HIS HAND IS FULL

297
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:36,894
He has to get the piece away from Tile 7s.

298
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:42,233
<i>I decided that getting the piece away</i>
<i>from Tile 7s was more important.</i>

299
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,240
I'll discard a tile.

300
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:51,951
It's 14.

301
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,414
Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min.
Please move the piece.

302
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,499
I'll use the Move 5 Cells card.

303
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:07,925
I'll obtain the tile.

304
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:13,181
TEAM KAIST LOGS A SET OF SPECIAL TILES

305
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:16,517
Dang, I can't believe
he built a set of Tile 7s.

306
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:18,436
That was amazing.

307
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,229
Unbelievable.

308
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,315
That means he memorized the whole board.

309
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:26,736
Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min won two points.

310
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,822
<i>I wanted to keep the momentum going</i>
<i>and take the first round.</i>

311
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:33,326
He's managing the game perfectly.

312
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:37,455
I guess they planned
to collect a trio of Tile 7s.

313
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:43,211
Team SNU in STEM's Han Jong-yun.
Please move the piece.

314
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:48,007
<i>It will be difficult to catch up</i>
<i>unless he gets a trio of clover tiles.</i>

315
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:54,138
I'll obtain the tile.

316
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:59,018
HAN JONG-YUN:
CLOVER 8, 5, 9, 5

317
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,061
Hang on.

318
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,606
THE SUM DOESN'T REACH 21

319
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,691
I guess something went wrong.

320
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:12,406
<i>I made a basic calculation mistake</i>
<i>while rushing myself to win a point.</i>

321
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,118
<i>It seemed like Jong-yun fumbled</i>
<i>because my play got under his skin.</i>

322
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,245
<i>That boosted my confidence.</i>

323
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:20,623
Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min.
Please move the piece.

324
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,418
I'll obtain the tile.

325
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:28,923
<i>He has two clover tiles.</i>

326
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,010
- Wasn't Clover Tile 4...
- It's just 3 cells away.

327
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:34,095
<i>You're right.</i>

328
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,430
THE PIECE IS CLOSE TO CLOVER TILE 4

329
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:39,934
The game is over
if Jong-yun can't recall that now.

330
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,896
Team SNU in STEM's Han Jong-yun.
Please move the piece.

331
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:51,153
THE PIECE MOVES AWAY FROM CLOVER TILE 4

332
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,822
I'll discard a tile.

333
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,949
HAN JONG-YUN:
CLOVER 8, 5, 9

334
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,620
I'll take a pass.

335
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:02,873
Team SNU in STEM's Han Jong-yun.
Please move the piece.

336
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,300
You have ten seconds left.

337
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:15,386
You have five seconds left.

338
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:20,641
I'll take a pass.

339
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,019
That's a deathblow, no?

340
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:26,439
JEON JI-MIN CAN OBTAIN
CLOVER TILE 4 IN THE NEXT TURN

341
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,983
Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min.
Please move the piece.

342
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,234
TEAM KAIST'S TURN

343
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:33,946
I'll obtain the tile.

344
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,284
- It's over.
- Yes, it is.

345
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,914
Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min
logged a set of tiles.

346
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:48,753
He won 2 points
as it consists of 3 special tiles.

347
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,380
TEAM KAIST: 4, TEAM SNU IN STEM: 0

348
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,467
Round 1 ends with Team KAIST's victory.

349
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,596
<i>Wow, he's good.</i>

350
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:01,098
Ji-min's really good.

351
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:03,476
He's brilliant.

352
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,645
That was simply perfect, sir.

353
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:07,980
The board is pretty easy to memorize.

354
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:09,565
I had it all memorized.

355
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,734
Doesn't it just mean
he's got an excellent memory?

356
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,196
I feel like we're unbeatable.

357
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,240
JI-MIN WILL COMPETE AGAIN IN ROUND 3

358
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,661
Don't worry. Making a comeback
from a mistake is always tricky.

359
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:26,916
<i>I did poorly even after assuring my team</i>
<i>that memorization was my specialty.</i>

360
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,959
<i>I felt too ashamed to face them.</i>

361
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:33,130
Ji-min is just that good.

362
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:35,549
How are we going to counter
their strategy?

363
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,927
- With the special tiles.
- We need the special tiles.

364
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,430
- Jong-yun made a mistake early on.
- Yes, it was a simple mistake.

365
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:44,350
I should've paid more attention
to the special tiles.

366
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:48,104
I'll have to memorize the numbers
on the special tiles as well.

367
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,773
We can't fall to Team KAIST.

368
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:52,983
Don't worry. I've got this.

369
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:57,405
We will now begin Round 2
of the Deathmatch, Lucky 21.

370
00:19:57,488 --> 00:20:02,201
Both teams, please announce
which contestant will play in Round 2.

371
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:06,080
Here. I'm playing on my team's behalf.

372
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:09,375
I'm competing in this round.

373
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,378
I hope Team SNU in STEM wins this time.

374
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:15,715
I don't know why, but I'm getting nervous.

375
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,675
Isn't he the hunter from before?

376
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:18,801
You mean Dong-geon?

377
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,136
He was their hunter.

378
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,096
Yeah, he killed it.

379
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:25,307
As Team SNU in STEM lost Round 1,

380
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:28,144
their player will decide who goes first.

381
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,354
I'll go first.

382
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:32,398
You chose to go first.

383
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:34,358
It's better to go second.

384
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:36,485
I don't think so.

385
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,821
<i>I did feel nervous going in,</i>

386
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:42,616
<i>but I was also excited</i>
<i>to take on the Deathmatch game.</i>

387
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:47,163
<i>I didn't feel so nervous</i>
<i>because the last Deathmatch hardened me.</i>

388
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,373
<i>I felt confident I could take him.</i>

389
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:51,792
Here is your board for Lucky 21.

390
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:54,712
You'll be given four minutes to memorize.

391
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:08,392
It's a tougher arrangement.

392
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,603
This one's harder to memorize.

393
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,438
It will be hard to memorize it.

394
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:17,276
Dong-geon's strategy
will pay off big time.

395
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,570
I'll memorize the tiles on the border.

396
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,489
DONG-GEON'S STRATEGY
IS TO MEMORIZE THE BORDER TILES

397
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:26,660
<i>I thought Team KAIST's strategy was</i>
<i>to get two-point sets with special tiles.</i>

398
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:31,707
<i>So I memorized their locations first</i>
<i>and moved on to the border section.</i>

399
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,293
- Because of the clover tiles there?
- Yes.

400
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,545
- And all the Tile 7s.
- On top of those...

401
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:40,341
You just get a lot to work with.

402
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:43,344
The time for memorization is over.

403
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:46,472
Team SNU in STEM's Kim Dong-geon
will go first.

404
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:50,267
He'll go for Clover Tile 2, right?

405
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,604
I'll obtain the tile.

406
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:59,235
KIM DONG-GEON:
CLOVER 2

407
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:03,197
I hope he'll kick us off
with Clover Tile 13.

408
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:07,493
With Clover Tile 13,
Dong-geon's Clover Tile 2 is neutralized.

409
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:11,789
<i>In this setup, Clover 2 Tile needs</i>
<i>2 specific tiles for a 2-point set.</i>

410
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:15,835
<i>The only possible 2-point set</i>
<i>consists of Clover Tiles 2, 6, and 13.</i>

411
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,010
I'll obtain the tile.

412
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:27,930
KANG JI-HOO:
CLOVER 13

413
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:31,475
He went for the clover tile first.

414
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,435
He knows what Dong-geon is after.

415
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:37,231
DONG-GEON CAN'T MAKE A 2-POINT SET
WITH CLOVER TILE 2

416
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:40,526
I'll obtain the tile.

417
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,028
KIM DONG-GEON:
CLOVER 2, CLOVER 6

418
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:45,573
TEAM KAIST'S TURN

419
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:48,993
I really hope Ji-hoo forgets stuff.

420
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:52,162
Please let him forget.

421
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:53,664
- I can't watch this.
- What?

422
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,374
I can't bear to watch.

423
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:01,797
I'll obtain the tile.

424
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:06,218
BOTH PLAYERS COLLECTED SPECIAL TILES ONLY

425
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:07,761
Good job.

426
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:09,680
That's Tile 7.

427
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:12,975
<i>They're trying to keep each other</i>
<i>from getting the special tiles.</i>

428
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:18,480
TEAM SNU IN STEM'S TURN

429
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:19,857
I'll obtain the tile.

430
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,318
KIM DONG-GEON:
CLOVER 2, CLOVER 6, 8

431
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:25,738
I'll take a pass.

432
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,449
I'll use the Move 5 Cells card.

433
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,120
That should be used

434
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:35,831
only when you can get a tile
to complete your set.

435
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:43,923
I'll obtain the tile.

436
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:52,473
TEAM SNU IN STEM LOGS A SET OF BASIC TILES

437
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:56,936
Team SNU in STEM's Kim Dong-geon
won one point.

438
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,522
He wanted to secure a point first.

439
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,442
I'll obtain the tile.

440
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:06,737
KANG JI-HOO:
CLOVER 13, 7, 8

441
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,075
I'll obtain the tile.

442
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:12,868
KIM DONG-GEON:
CLOVER 2, CLOVER 1

443
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:15,746
I'll obtain the tile.

444
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,289
KANG JI-HOO:
CLOVER 13, 7, 8, CLOVER 5

445
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:19,333
THEY'RE TRYING TO NEUTRALIZE
THE OTHER'S SPECIAL TILES

446
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,502
<i>Round 2 is more intense than Round 1.</i>

447
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,422
I'll obtain the tile.

448
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,676
I'll take a pass.

449
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:31,595
Ji-hoo is holding onto so many tiles...

450
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,806
<i>I know. Why won't he discard any of them?</i>

451
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,101
I'll take a pass.

452
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:41,522
Team KAIST's Kang Ji-hoo.
Please move the piece.

453
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:45,609
WHOEVER SECURES TILE 3 FIRST
CAN LOG A SET OF TILES

454
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:48,612
I'll take a pass.

455
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,240
I'll take a pass.

456
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,325
I'll take a pass.

457
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:56,370
I'll take a pass.

458
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,122
- What?
- I think Dong-geon is leading him on

459
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:00,833
- I think so, too.
- to get to the tile he wants.

460
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,010
Take it to that empty cell.
You have to discard a tile, Mr. KAIST.

461
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,680
I'll take a pass.

462
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:20,519
<i>I could tell most of the tiles</i>
<i>Ji-hoo had memorized were gone.</i>

463
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,233
I'll obtain the tile.

464
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:28,235
He did it.

465
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:30,612
He must've remembered that Tile 3 there.

466
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:36,452
Team SNU in STEM's Kim Dong-geon
logged a set of tiles.

467
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,370
TEAM KAIST: 0, TEAM SNU IN STEM: 2

468
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:40,873
Two points in total.
He's making steady progress.

469
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,583
Slow and steady like the mining operation.

470
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:46,920
He keeps including a special tile.
That way, he's likely to win.

471
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:50,299
Yes, Dong-geon is getting the upper hand.

472
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:51,800
I could remember everything,

473
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:55,054
so I knew I would win
the longer the game went on.

474
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,515
I'll discard a tile.

475
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:03,479
<i>So I felt good about my chances.</i>

476
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:06,273
I'll obtain the tile.

477
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,067
I'll obtain the tile.

478
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:10,194
I'll obtain the tile.

479
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:14,490
Team SNU in STEM's Kim Dong-geon
logged a set of tiles.

480
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:19,995
ONE MORE POINT,
AND TEAM SNU IN STEM WINS THIS ROUND

481
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,666
There we have it.

482
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:28,712
Please...

483
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:34,885
I'll obtain the tile.

484
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,095
I'll obtain the tile.

485
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:41,433
<i>My only way out</i>
<i>was to claim the Tile 7 trio.</i>

486
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:45,729
<i>I knew I would win in the end.</i>

487
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:49,358
KIM DONG-GEON:
10, 2, 8

488
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,734
Move one cell up.

489
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,486
Take it just one cell up.

490
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:55,948
DONG-GEON CAN LOG A SET OF TILES
IF HE OBTAINS TILE 9 NEXT

491
00:26:57,157 --> 00:27:00,619
Team SNU in STEM's Kim Dong-geon.
Please move the piece.

492
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:04,790
I'll obtain the tile.

493
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:06,041
He did it!

494
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,210
Kudos to his memory.

495
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,712
Kudos indeed.
He definitely has a sharp memory.

496
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:12,840
He kept the board memorized
throughout the game.

497
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:14,550
Yes, he retained it throughout.

498
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:19,054
Team SNU in STEM's Kim Dong-geon
won a point.

499
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:22,891
Round 2 ends
with Team SNU in STEM's victory.

500
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:24,518
TEAM KAIST: 0, TEAM SNU IN STEM: 4

501
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,354
What a shame.

502
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:30,524
That concludes Round 2 of Lucky 21.

503
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,277
How many cells did you memorize?

504
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,154
- The whole board, of course.
- Really?

505
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:37,197
No, I was just kidding.

506
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:39,950
<i>I was relieved</i>

507
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:43,287
<i>that my strategy</i>
<i>to focus on the border was effective.</i>

508
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:45,289
I think the winners will play in Round 3.

509
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:46,707
- That's for sure.
- Right?

510
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,625
- That should be interesting.
- I know.

511
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:51,295
I'd say Ji-min and Dong-geon
will compete next.

512
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:54,882
If they get a face-off,
Ji-min will surely win.

513
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:57,509
- Great job.
- Thank you.

514
00:27:58,552 --> 00:27:59,636
That's how it's done.

515
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,556
You did us a solid.

516
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:06,935
It's such a shame.

517
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,145
Don't worry about it.

518
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:10,189
You gave it a nice sense of suspense.

519
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:11,773
You spiced things up for the show.

520
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:14,318
I'll get us the win in Round 3.

521
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:20,282
We will now begin Round 3
of the Deathmatch, Lucky 21.

522
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:25,829
Both teams, please announce
which contestant will play in Round 3.

523
00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:27,206
Will it be Dong-geon?

524
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:28,248
Of course.

525
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:30,292
If they don't throw us a curve, sure.

526
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,589
Team SNU in STEM.

527
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,676
I'll be playing.

528
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,221
HAN JONG-YUN WILL COMPETE

529
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:48,227
Didn't Jong-yun compete in Round 1?

530
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,853
They're going with Jong-yun.

531
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:52,606
AGAINST ALL EXPECTATION,
HAN JONG-YUN GOES FOR ROUND 3

532
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,567
AFTER ROUND 2
What do we do about Round 3?

533
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:56,652
Let Jong-yun compete.

534
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,695
My mind's pretty exhausted.

535
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:02,157
<i>I knew how good Jong-yun was</i>
<i>at memorization,</i>

536
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:04,993
so I was convinced
that he'd do far better than I

537
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:08,705
if he memorized
where the special tiles were.

538
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:11,833
- You actually want to compete, right?
- Yes.

539
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:14,002
I hope you're not offering
because you want to oblige.

540
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:16,463
- Your opinion matters most.
- You've got this.

541
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:17,923
Think about it.

542
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,591
I know I'm being greedy here.

543
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:22,135
- If you're up for it, you should do it.
- Agreed.

544
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,722
To be honest...

545
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:30,435
I don't think I did my part
during our game yesterday,

546
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:34,147
so I want to tackle the final game myself.

547
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:36,024
If you want that, you can go for it.

548
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:37,526
You totally should.

549
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:40,320
- That game's built for you.
- No pressure, though. You've got this.

550
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:42,572
- For sure.
- Thank you, guys.

551
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:46,535
<i>I realized I should pull myself together</i>
<i>instead of floundering.</i>

552
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:50,622
Put your memory to good use,
and you're bound to win.

553
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:52,165
Good luck. I know you've got this.

554
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:55,085
I've got this.

555
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:57,212
Team KAIST.

556
00:29:58,005 --> 00:30:00,090
I'll play on my team's behalf.

557
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,508
TEAM KAIST'S PLAYER, JEON JI-MIN

558
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:03,552
It's basically a rematch.

559
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:06,013
- It's the same lineup from Round 1.
- You're right.

560
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:07,639
Jong-yun must've felt
he could win this time.

561
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:09,141
I guess he revised his strategy.

562
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:11,393
He's probably determined
to get his payback.

563
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:13,770
- His strategy must've been faulty.
- I agree.

564
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:16,148
He must have an impeccable one now.

565
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,191
I think Team SNU will make a comeback.

566
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:20,068
I'll come back victorious.

567
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:22,237
- Good luck.
- You've got this.

568
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:23,947
- Go get them.
- Best of luck.

569
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:26,658
<i>Jong-yun got overwhelmed</i>
<i>by my prowess in Round 1.</i>

570
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:29,494
So I had the feeling
I might get another good game.

571
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:31,496
Good luck. You can beat him.

572
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,998
Dong-geon.

573
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,708
- Thanks for the opportunity.
- Good attitude.

574
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:35,751
- Good luck.
- Let's roll.

575
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,128
- I'll get us the win.
- I know you can do it.

576
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:41,214
<i>Dong-geon gave me the chance</i>
<i>to make up for my failure,</i>

577
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:43,425
<i>so I felt more determined</i>
<i>to win the round.</i>

578
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:49,056
Players competing in Round 3 are
Team SNU in STEM's Han Jong-yun

579
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:51,767
and Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min.

580
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:55,854
This is the real drama.
It's what epics are made of.

581
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,775
As Team KAIST lost Round 2,

582
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,027
their player will decide who goes first.

583
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,571
- He'll probably go second.
- Yeah.

584
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,656
- Same as Round 1, right?
- He won then.

585
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:14,706
I'll go second.

586
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:21,129
Here's your board for Lucky 21.

587
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:23,256
You'll be given four minutes to memorize.

588
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:37,687
- Thank goodness.
- Why did you say that?

589
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:40,899
Jong-yun's going first,
so he can get Clover Tile 8.

590
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:43,360
- Clover tiles are nearby. See?
- Hey, you're right.

591
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:45,529
- It's better to go first.
- Definitely.

592
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:04,923
I don't see multiple sets
except the ones using Clover Tile 8.

593
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:07,467
Jong-yun will likely take it at the start.

594
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:11,179
It will be difficult to make sets
with the clover tiles.

595
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:13,014
I'm worried about the clover tiles.

596
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:15,767
I've only found two possible sets so far.

597
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:17,477
3, 8, 10 AND 4, 8, 9
ARE THE ONLY POSSIBLE CLOVER SETS

598
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:22,399
We can count on Jong-yun's memory...

599
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:25,861
- So it's for the better.
- I'm sure he'll deliver results.

600
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:32,909
The time for memorization is over.

601
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:36,538
I think this round will be fun.

602
00:32:37,164 --> 00:32:39,749
Team SNU in STEM's Han Jong-yun
will go first.

603
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:42,711
You can move only one cell at this time.

604
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,421
Please move the piece.

605
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:47,883
- He'll take Clover Tile 8, won't he?
- You bet he will.

606
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,431
I'll obtain the tile.

607
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:57,851
HAN JONG-YUN:
CLOVER 8

608
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:04,441
<i>Jong-yun's ringing voice implied</i>
<i>that he was fully back in the game.</i>

609
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:07,569
Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min.
Please move the piece.

610
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:14,159
I'll obtain the tile.

611
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:17,704
JEON JI-MIN:
CLOVER 9

612
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:19,498
Was that a defensive move?

613
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:23,376
JONG-YUN CAN'T MAKE
THE CLOVER SET OF 4, 8, AND 9

614
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:26,171
Team SNU in STEM's Han Jong-yun.
Please move the piece.

615
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:31,051
Looks like Jong-yun is reviewing things.

616
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,677
- Yes.
- He's retrieving the numbers.

617
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:34,346
JONG-YUN IS WORKING IN HIS "MIND PALACE"

618
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,889
He's looking for his playmates.

619
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:38,975
Yeah, he's rummaging around
to find the thief and the puppets.

620
00:33:42,896 --> 00:33:44,231
I'll obtain the tile.

621
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:46,691
HAN JONG-YUN:
CLOVER 8, 7

622
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:50,779
I'll obtain the tile.

623
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:54,491
JEON JI-MIN:
CLOVER 4, CLOVER 9

624
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,703
<i>- Both are on defense.</i>
<i>- Exactly.</i>

625
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:00,539
It's getting fierce.

626
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:04,376
I think I saw a Tile 7
on the bottom right side.

627
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:13,468
I'll obtain the tile.

628
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,014
HAN JONG-YUN:
CLOVER 8, 7, 7

629
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:19,474
He has two Tile 7s, right?

630
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:21,142
Yes, I think so.

631
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:28,024
<i>I thought the game was progressing</i>
<i>as I had planned.</i>

632
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,784
You have ten seconds left.

633
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,872
I'll take a pass.

634
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:45,750
I'll take a pass.

635
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:49,170
Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min.
Please move the piece.

636
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:55,594
Time is on our side.
I'm sure Jong-yun remembers everything.

637
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:03,143
- Jong-yun needs one more Tile 7.
- They're in the upper section.

638
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:04,686
One in the middle and one at the top.

639
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,522
One wrong move, and Jong-yun will use
the Move 5 Cells card to get one.

640
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:09,190
Ji-min shouldn't move it up.

641
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:13,945
<i>It looks like Ji-min is trying</i>
<i>to figure out a way to avoid that.</i>

642
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:16,823
You have five seconds left.

643
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:21,077
I'll obtain the tile.

644
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:24,789
JEON JI-MIN:
CLOVER 10, CLOVER 4, CLOVER 9

645
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:27,709
Team SNU in STEM's Han Jong-yun.
Please move the piece.

646
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:32,631
I'll use the Move 5 Cells card.

647
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:35,175
There we go. He's moving it up.

648
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:37,844
- All right. He needs that Tile 7.
- Good call.

649
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:39,679
I'll use the Move 5 Cells card.

650
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:44,809
I'll obtain the tile.

651
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,104
I'll log my tile set.

652
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:49,439
A SET OF SPECIAL TILES

653
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:52,859
Team SNU in STEM's Han Jong-yun
logged a set of tiles.

654
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:57,322
He won 2 points
as it consists of 3 special tiles.

655
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,908
<i>Your attitude can either make</i>
<i>or break the game.</i>

656
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:03,244
<i>That's why I tried to show</i>
<i>as much confidence as possible.</i>

657
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:06,581
He won 2 points
as it consists of 3 special tiles.

658
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:09,125
- So he had a trio of Tile 7s.
- Yeah, he did.

659
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:19,135
Shoot, I get that now.

660
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:20,679
Ji-min can't get a two-pointer now.

661
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:23,139
- Three Tile 7s are out...
- Don't forget Clover Tile 8.

662
00:36:23,223 --> 00:36:25,558
I'm getting an incredible dopamine rush.

663
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:29,312
Ji-min can't get any 2-point set
with Clover Tiles 10, 4, or 9.

664
00:36:29,396 --> 00:36:32,482
- Ji-min's special tiles became useless.
- Exactly.

665
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:37,612
That was a mistake.

666
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,703
You have ten seconds left.

667
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,331
I'll take a pass.

668
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,126
I'll obtain the tile.

669
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:54,546
HAN JONG-YUN:
CLOVER 8, 1

670
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:57,465
Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min.
Please move the piece.

671
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:02,595
I'll use the Move 5 Cells card.

672
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:09,602
I'll obtain the tile.

673
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,985
Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min
logged a set of tiles.

674
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,612
He won a point.

675
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:21,948
He's going for 1-pointers.

676
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:24,784
Now, it all comes down
to how much they remember.

677
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:26,077
This will be a tough one.

678
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:32,417
I'll obtain the tile.

679
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,922
LOGS A SET OF TILES

680
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:39,632
<i>He's become a different person.</i>

681
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:42,510
<i>He must've memorized</i>
<i>the whole board this time.</i>

682
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:45,555
- He's getting his revenge for Round 1.
- Looks that way.

683
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:49,684
Team SNU in STEM's Han Jong-yun
won a point.

684
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:51,060
TEAM KAIST: 1, TEAM SNU IN STEM: 3

685
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:58,651
He's progressing fast.
He won three points in no time.

686
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:01,613
Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min.
Please move the piece.

687
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:05,742
Thirteen... Twelve...

688
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:08,828
Time is definitely on our side.

689
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:11,122
It looks like
Jong-yun remembers everything.

690
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,296
I'll obtain the tile.

691
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:19,923
JEON JI-MIN:
2, CLOVER 9

692
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:22,926
I'll obtain the tile.

693
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:24,636
HAN JONG-YUN:
4

694
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:26,513
I'll take a pass.

695
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:28,723
I'll obtain the tile.

696
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:31,017
HAN JONG-YUN:
4, 9

697
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:35,647
IF HE SECURES TILE 8, HE WINS THE ROUND

698
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,232
Does he know where Tile 8s are?

699
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,692
- Where are they?
- Here.

700
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:40,944
<i>And here, too.</i>

701
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,238
<i>- I think he'd know.</i>
<i>- Do you see it?</i>

702
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,573
2 TILE 8S REMAIN ON THE BOARD

703
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:48,243
Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min.
Please move the piece.

704
00:38:51,955 --> 00:38:53,164
I'll obtain the tile.

705
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:55,959
JEON JI-MIN:
11, 2, CLOVER 9

706
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:00,797
Jong-yun can now get Tile 8.

707
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:03,758
- I see. He can get it.
- He sure can.

708
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:06,427
It's over if he recalls where Tile 8 is.

709
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:08,680
He has to go right, down, down.

710
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:11,683
Team SNU in STEM's Han Jong-yun.
Please move the piece.

711
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:16,771
IF HE COLLECTS TILE 8,
THE ROUND ENDS IN A 4-1 VICTORY

712
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,241
- Let's go, man.
- Yeah, you've got this.

713
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:30,535
- Right, down, down.
- Exactly.

714
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:38,960
You have ten seconds left.

715
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:43,798
I'll...

716
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:45,425
Yes, I'll obtain it.

717
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:49,137
JONG-YUN PICKS UP TILE 5 INSTEAD OF TILE 8

718
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:56,060
Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min.
Please move the piece.

719
00:39:58,855 --> 00:40:00,773
JI-MIN TOOK THE PIECE TO TILE 8

720
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:02,233
I'll obtain the tile.

721
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:09,240
Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min
logged a set of tiles.

722
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:11,701
He won a point.

723
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:13,870
TEAM KAIST: 2, TEAM SNU IN STEM: 3

724
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:15,622
- Ji-min knew about it.
- Looks like it.

725
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:18,166
- That was a risky move.
- I know.

726
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,752
This is pretty sick.

727
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:23,838
Team SNU in STEM's Han Jong-yun.
Please move the piece.

728
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,016
You have ten seconds left.

729
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:39,479
I'll take a pass.

730
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:42,690
TEAM KAIST'S TURN

731
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,569
Please make your choice.

732
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:47,779
I'll obtain the tile.

733
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:53,326
- It's over.
- Yeah!

734
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:55,161
Jong-yun should know about that Tile 8.

735
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:58,831
ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO OBTAIN TILE 8

736
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:09,842
I'll obtain the tile.

737
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:11,970
JONG-YUN FAILED TO SECURE TILE 8

738
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:16,891
He's forgotten about that.

739
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:18,309
Dang it.

740
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:22,647
Please make your choice.

741
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:23,815
I'll obtain the tile.

JEON JI-MIN:
9, 5, CLOVER 9

743
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:31,572
Ji-min wastes no time at all.
It's pretty intense.

744
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:34,701
Jong-yun has to discard a tile now.

745
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:38,037
WITH 4 TILES IN HIS POSSESSION,
JONG-YUN HAS TO DISCARD ONE

746
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:40,999
<i>It seemed he didn't memorize everything.</i>

747
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:42,792
I'll discard a tile.

748
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,627
<i>I realized he was in a fog.</i>

749
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,964
<i>I set my mind on keeping this momentum.</i>

750
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:52,719
Please make your choice.

751
00:41:52,802 --> 00:41:53,886
I'll obtain the tile.

752
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:00,560
Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min
logged a set of tiles.

753
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:02,729
He won a point.

754
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,231
JI-MIN GAVE CHASE TO TIE THE GAME

755
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:06,274
It's neck-and-neck.

756
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:07,358
What a close game.

757
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:09,694
- It's 3-to-3.
- Anyone can win.

758
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:13,156
Come on now.

759
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:16,117
He's got an incredible memory.

760
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,618
- If he wins...
- I'm amazed.

761
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:21,664
Ji-min has managed to gain on Jong-yun.

762
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,501
<i>When it's tied 3-3,</i>
<i>the one who doesn't mess up would win.</i>

763
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:28,838
<i>I felt unsettled</i>
<i>when Ji-min caught up with me,</i>

764
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:31,758
<i>but I still thought</i>
<i>I could win as long as I stayed focused.</i>

Please make your choice.

769
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:43,269
I'll obtain the tile.

Please make your choice.

771
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:48,232
I'll obtain the tile.

772
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:52,195
My heart.

00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:58,576
I'll take a pass.

776
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:04,707
I'll discard a tile.

777
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:06,167
I'll obtain the tile.

778
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:13,132
- I'll take a pass.
- I'll take a pass.

779
00:43:13,216 --> 00:43:14,175
What a tight race.

780
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,719
I'm a wreck now. I can't stand this.

781
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:21,933
They're so set
on not revealing their goal.

782
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:24,519
They really should check the tiles,
but they're avoiding it

783
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:25,812
because it's so neck-and-neck.

784
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:28,773
Team SNU in STEM's Han Jong-yun.
Please move the piece.

785

Please make your choice.

786
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:33,361
I'll obtain the tile.

787
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:36,114
HAN JONG-YUN:
9, 16, CLOVER 6

788
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:38,825
<i>After wracking my brain</i>

789
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:41,494
<i>to find a set whose sum reached 21</i>
<i>out of the tiles I memorized,</i>

790
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:43,162
<i>I finally found a suitable pair.</i>

791
00:43:43,246 --> 00:43:44,997
All I had to do was obtain them.

792
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:49,085
- Please make your choice.
- I'll take a pass.

793
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:53,297
I'll discard a tile.

794
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:55,007
- What's on that tile?
- It's 16.

795
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,468
HAN JONG-YUN:
9, CLOVER 6

796
00:43:57,552 --> 00:43:59,804
WITH TILE 6, THE SUM WILL REACH 21

797
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,889
Are there more Tile 6s
other than the one above Tile 11?

798
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:04,016
There's one more in the upper left corner.

799
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:07,812
You're right.
It looks like Jong-yun can wrap it up now.

800
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:11,566
Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min.
Please move the piece.

801
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,950
You have ten seconds left.

00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:28,457
I'll obtain the tile.

804
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:38,176
<i>I managed to get to the 3-3 tie</i>

<i>All I needed to win then was Tile 16.</i>

806
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:45,850
JONG-YUN DISCARDED TILE 16

807
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:51,939
<i>I thought, "That will get me the victory.</i>
<i>I'm on the brink of winning."</i>

I'll discard my Tile 5.

814

Come on now. Surely not...

815
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:23,262
BOTH TEAMS NEED JUST ONE MORE TILE TO WIN

816
00:45:23,346 --> 00:45:25,723
JONG-YUN'S TARGET: TILE 6
JI-MIN'S TARGET: TILE 16

I'll discard my Tile 4.

819
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:42,615
Jong-yun can reach that Tile 6
no matter what.

820
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:45,868
Ji-min can't reverse Jong-yun's last move,
so he won't have any problem.

821
00:45:45,952 --> 00:45:48,287
<i>As the piece cannot be returned</i>

822
00:45:48,371 --> 00:45:50,164

00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:18,234
I'll obtain the tile.

831
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:28,786
Team SNU in STEM's Han Jong-yun
logged a set of tiles.

832
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:30,997
He won a point.

833
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:45,469
I'm floored.

834
00:46:46,721 --> 00:46:50,808
<i>I was glad that I managed to repay</i>
<i>my teammates' trust with a victory.</i>

835
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:51,976
<i>I also felt relieved.</i>

836
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:55,146
<i>I was literally one tile away</i>
<i>from winning,</i>

837
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:56,731
<i>so I was racing to get it.</i>

838
00:46:56,814 --> 00:47:00,151
<i>It was deeply upsetting</i>
<i>to have it slip through my fingers.</i>

839
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:08,075
Team SNU in STEM's Han Jong-yun
won four points in total.

840
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:10,536
That concludes Round 3 of Lucky 21.

841
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:13,748
Round 3 ends
with Team SNU in STEM's victory.

842
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:16,667
- Thanks for the good game.
- Thank you.

843
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:24,050
- Good job.
- Thanks, man.

844
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:29,930
All I needed was one more turn.

845
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:32,183
- What a shame.
- It's so disappointing.

846
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:34,894
- Thank you for your trust.
- I loved your game.

847
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:37,855
You were amazing.

848
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:42,151
<i>That concludes the Deathmatch, Lucky 21.</i>

849
00:47:45,154 --> 00:47:48,366
<i>The third team to be eliminated</i>
<i>from Elite League Season 3 is</i>

850
00:47:48,741 --> 00:47:50,618
<i>Team KAIST.</i>

851
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:52,953
Will the light go out?

852
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:56,040
Oh, no. Don't turn off
the lovely sky blue light.

853
00:47:56,749 --> 00:47:58,584
All teams surrounding us went home.

854
00:47:59,085 --> 00:48:00,503
So lonely.

855
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:03,047
- I haven't had a face-off against Ji-hu.
- Oh, right.

856
00:48:06,342 --> 00:48:09,720
<i>Team KAIST, please exit the grounds.</i>

857
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:12,431
- Should we get going?
- Yeah.

858
00:48:12,515 --> 00:48:15,935
- Are we seriously leaving?
- Bummer.

859
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:25,903
It's such a shame.

860
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:28,197
Let's do our best.

861
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,408
Our clips will be on the web
for at least a decade.

862
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:32,201
This should be fun.

863
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:35,704
<i>I basically waited two years</i>
<i>to be on the show, since I applied twice.</i>

864
00:48:35,788 --> 00:48:39,250
Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min
has been chosen as the Ace player.

865
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:41,669
<i>I was so elated to be selected.</i>

866
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:44,713
<i>I had such a great time</i>
<i>playing the amazing games.</i>

867
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:47,049
<i>The two-year wait was so worth it.</i>

868
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:50,678
<i>...was correct.</i>

869
00:48:52,388 --> 00:48:55,141
<i>My only regret is</i>
<i>that our joyful journey has to end.</i>

870
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:57,059
What a bummer.

871
00:48:57,435 --> 00:49:01,856
<i>Thanks to my teammates, I made it so far</i>
<i>and got to play a bunch of fun games.</i>

872
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:04,316
Now, we have to leave...

873
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:06,986
I still can't believe it.

874
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:11,323
<i>I gave it my all until the end,</i>
<i>so I don't have any regrets left.</i>

875
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:13,993
<i>I'd like to thank the creators</i>
<i>for the opportunity.</i>

876
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:18,122
Jae-han is a wiz with this stuff.
He's like a machine.

877
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:21,167
<i>I probably wasn't the strongest contender,</i>

878
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:24,295
<i>but I loved tackling various tasks</i>
<i>with the help of my team.</i>

879
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:28,132
<i>I had so much fun competing here</i>
<i>with my teammates by my side.</i>

880
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:30,509
I think I'll remember
my days here forever.

881
00:49:30,593 --> 00:49:35,931
<i>To be honest,</i>
<i>being on the show felt like a dream.</i>

882
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:37,433
<i>Along the way...</i>

883
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:41,312
This is probably the day I solved
the most calculation questions in my life.

884
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:43,898
<i>I do have my regrets,</i>
<i>but I did my very best.</i>

885
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:47,359
<i>My teammates also gave their all,</i>
<i>so I want to thank them for it.</i>

886
00:49:51,906 --> 00:49:53,491
I'm sorry.

887
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:54,533
- Don't be.
- My bad.

888
00:49:54,617 --> 00:49:56,827
Don't say that.
You're here because you are good.

889
00:49:57,161 --> 00:49:58,287
Excuse me.

890
00:49:58,370 --> 00:49:59,788
We're splitting the prize, remember?

891
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:16,597
We'll have the 1-on-1 interviews now.

892
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,723
AFTER LUCKY 21

893
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:20,267
If you wait at the main hall...

894
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:24,063
ALL CONTESTANTS GATHER AT THE MAIN HALL

895
00:50:24,313 --> 00:50:26,607
TEAM KAIST
THIRD TEAM TO BE ELIMINATED

896
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:27,650
They turned the lights off.

897
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:29,777
LIGHTS ARE OFF
OUTSIDE THE ELIMINATED TEAMS' BASE CAMPS

898
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,071
WAILING

899
00:50:32,321 --> 00:50:34,323
Hey, the lights are off.

900
00:50:34,782 --> 00:50:36,158
- They turned off the light.
- I know.

901
00:50:36,242 --> 00:50:37,701
TEAM POSTECH
FIRST TEAM TO BE ELIMINATED

902
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:39,411
I hear you came in first.

903
00:50:39,495 --> 00:50:41,455
TEAM YONSEI
SECOND TEAM TO BE ELIMINATED

904
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,457
So you killed it?

905
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:45,084
- It's been a while.
- Right.

906
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:47,253
- So you aced the main match?
- Yes, we did.

907
00:50:47,336 --> 00:50:49,171
Tae-hun did the heavy lifting.

908
00:50:49,255 --> 00:50:50,256
Be the champions, okay?

909
00:50:50,339 --> 00:50:52,925
It's 2-against-1 now. You've got to win.

910
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:54,343
You bet we will.

911
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:56,178
We can't let Team SNU
win three seasons in a row.

912
00:50:56,262 --> 00:50:57,471
Exactly.

913
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,140
You guys are my favorite.

914
00:51:00,683 --> 00:51:02,560
- You're my favorite, okay?
- The feeling's mutual.

915
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:05,604
We had good chemistry, didn't we?

916
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:08,274
I'm sorry.
If we hadn't bungled the main match...

917
00:51:08,357 --> 00:51:11,193
We should've done a better job
with the investigation.

918
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,738
How was the shoot yesterday?
Aren't you guys drained?

919
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:16,740
I went straight to bed after Day 1.

920
00:51:16,824 --> 00:51:18,576
And I woke up at 3 p.m. the day after.

921
00:51:19,118 --> 00:51:20,286
- I was that tired.
- Sounds lovely.

922
00:51:20,369 --> 00:51:21,537
I'm so jealous.

923
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:24,290
You think it was lovely?
Are you making fun of us?

924
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:27,376
We are just messing with you.

925
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:29,420
What did you do at the hotel?

926
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:30,629
Us?

927
00:51:30,713 --> 00:51:32,715
We wallowed in grief.

928
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,341
We grieved.

929
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:36,677
To be honest, I fell asleep right away,

930
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,971
but these folks had a sleepless night.

931
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:41,557
I finally fell asleep at 5 a.m.

932
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:44,268
A-in's crying face kept coming back to me.

933
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:47,563
Of course, you were heartbroken.

934
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:50,441
- It was upsetting.
- We were heartsick.

935
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:51,567
So, Ji-hu.

936
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:53,694
- You went to Hansung Science High?
- Yes.

937
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:55,821
- You graduated early, too?
- Yes.

938
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:56,739
KANG JI-HU, 17 YEARS OLD

939
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:59,366
How are you so bright when you're only 17?

940
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:02,161
His brain is young and supple.

941
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:04,955
- Back when I was 18...
- We were beasts.

942
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:06,457
We shook the whole universe.

943
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:09,585
<i>- We will now begin a redemption round.</i>
- What?

944
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:13,631
- Wait...
- Seriously?

945
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:16,925
What on earth?

946
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:19,678
Is this for real?

947
00:52:19,762 --> 00:52:21,263
It makes no sense.

948
00:52:21,347 --> 00:52:22,681
Is this for real?

949
00:52:22,765 --> 00:52:24,350
Seriously, what's going on?

950
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:28,812
- It's real.
- Are you serious?

951
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:31,273
What was our elimination interview for?

952
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:37,571
What on earth?

953
00:52:37,655 --> 00:52:38,989
Maybe the game is on today.

954
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:41,116
- It's on right away.
- Right away?

955
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,701
The whole interview was a smoke screen.

956
00:52:42,785 --> 00:52:45,371
They used it as a pretext
for the redemption round.

957
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:48,374
- Hang on.
- Just a second.

958
00:52:48,457 --> 00:52:50,334
- Let's put our friendship on hold.
- Yeah, right.

959
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:52,294
We'll see you later.

960
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:54,463
We have a good chance of making it back.

961
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:56,006
We've got to take it.

962
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:58,717
Seriously though, we need you to advance.

963
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:01,178
- That way, we get a 3-to-1 setup.
- "Medical versus STEM,

964
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:03,597
- med students flatten their opponents."
- We need that.

965
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:06,934
Let's give it our all
like it's our Deathmatch.

966
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:09,228
A true Deathmatch
where the survivors return from hell.

967
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:12,398
This is exactly what we needed.

968
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:16,402
<i>We will now begin the redemption round.</i>

969
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:18,862
Oh, the lights are back on.

970
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,449
They turned them back on.

971
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:24,410
- Wow, the lights are on.
- They are.

972
00:53:25,077 --> 00:53:26,328
<i>Team POSTECH.</i>

973
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:27,996
<i>Team Yonsei.</i>

974
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:29,748
<i>Team KAIST.</i>

975
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:32,710
<i>With the exception of these three teams,</i>

976
00:53:32,793 --> 00:53:35,629
<i>please return to your base camps.</i>

977
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:36,547
Good luck, Team Yonsei!

978
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:38,590
- You've got this!
- Go get them!

979
00:53:38,674 --> 00:53:40,384
- Good luck!
- You've got this!

980
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:41,510
All right!

981
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:43,595
- Good luck.
- Go get them!

982
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:45,055
Let's go, STEM Division!

983
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:46,181
We'll do our best!

984
00:53:46,515 --> 00:53:47,349
Ji-hoo.

985
00:53:47,433 --> 00:53:48,684
Hey, Ji-hoo.

986
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:50,519
FROM JI-HU TO JI-HOO
Good luck.

987
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:51,437
You've got this.

988
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,896
All right. Go, me!

989
00:53:54,106 --> 00:53:56,191
This isn't exactly good news for us.

990
00:53:56,275 --> 00:53:57,901
- I agree.
- Same here.

991
00:53:57,985 --> 00:54:00,070
Things will get tricky
with Team KAIST back in the mix.

992
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:02,531
We barely managed to defeat them.

993
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:04,032
They're way too good.

994
00:54:04,116 --> 00:54:06,785
We jumped through hoops
to get them eliminated.

995
00:54:07,536 --> 00:54:09,079
If Team Yonsei makes it back,

996
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:11,123
- it will get rough for us.
- I know.

997
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:13,751
- We had such a close game.
- Exactly.

998
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:15,753
We won by a very narrow margin.

999
00:54:15,836 --> 00:54:18,255
Who knows what will happen in a rematch?

1000
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:21,592
Honestly though,
I was happy to see Team Yonsei leave.

1001
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:25,220
This means
that we get one of our rivals back.

1002
00:54:25,304 --> 00:54:26,138
Tell me about it.

1003
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:27,931
That will add the pressure.

1004
00:54:28,307 --> 00:54:30,934
None of them is a pushover.
It's frightening.

1005
00:54:31,018 --> 00:54:32,644
A true return from hell.

1006
00:54:32,728 --> 00:54:33,812
A redemption round?

1007
00:54:33,896 --> 00:54:36,982
But then again, it did feel like
things were going too well.

1008
00:54:37,733 --> 00:54:39,151
I wonder which team will make it back.

1009
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:42,946
I think Team KAIST has the upper hand
since they played until this morning.

1010
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:44,698
They could be worn out, though.

1011
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:47,034
Team Yonsei had a good night's rest.

1012
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:50,746
Let's say Team KAIST manages to advance.
Just imagine their day.

1013
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:53,582
<i>They would've traveled back and forth</i>
<i>from hell to heaven.</i>

1014
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:56,752
I still can't believe what's happening.

1015
00:54:56,835 --> 00:55:00,756
Our elimination was a surprise,
but that was nothing compared to this.

1016
00:55:01,215 --> 00:55:03,383
Those guys look so well-rested.

1017
00:55:06,762 --> 00:55:08,347
We're at a disadvantage.

1018
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:10,557
That's true.
But we must rise above and win

1019
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:12,518
to complete our hero's journey.

1020
00:55:12,601 --> 00:55:14,269
We'll overcome this.

1021
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:18,565
<i>We simply couldn't get eliminated again.</i>
<i>I was determined to claw our way back.</i>

1022
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:21,693
Let's pull ourselves together
and do better this time.

1023
00:55:21,777 --> 00:55:24,404
Let's give it our all
and leave no regrets.

1024
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:28,617
<i>That was our last shot.</i>
<i>Another defeat meant we were truly done.</i>

1025
00:55:28,909 --> 00:55:31,787
<i>We'll win this time</i>
<i>and make our way back into the game.</i>

1026
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:34,164
Remember how it felt when we got axed.

1027
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:35,791
- Let's do our best.
- I'm all for that.

1028
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:37,000
Imagine how cool it'd be

1029
00:55:37,084 --> 00:55:39,336
if we rose like a phoenix
and became the champions.

1030
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:40,254
Totally.

1031
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:42,506
- That's a perfect narrative.
- You bet.

1032
00:55:42,965 --> 00:55:46,385
<i>I wanted to win no matter what.</i>
<i>I was ready to seize my shot.</i>

1033
00:55:46,844 --> 00:55:48,428
<i>The redemption round is...</i>

1034
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:56,019
<i>Relay Match.</i>

1035
00:55:58,146 --> 00:55:59,815
It's called the Relay Match.

1036
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:01,400
It will be a one-on-one game.

1037
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:03,777
Everyone will have to pull their weight.

1038
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:05,362
<i>In Relay Match,</i>

1039
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:09,408
<i>the host will choose 1 game</i>
<i>out of 3 options.</i>

1040
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:12,995
<i>Then, they will select one contestant</i>
<i>as their opponent.</i>

1041
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:15,914
<i>The winner will be determined</i>
<i>by the head-to-head results.</i>

1042
00:56:22,254 --> 00:56:25,799
An individual competition is long overdue.
The survivors should be the fittest.

1043
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:29,428
Given the setup, one person
may single-handedly rescue their team.

1044
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:30,762
This will be so much fun.

1045
00:56:30,846 --> 00:56:34,766
<i>All teams will be assigned six lives.</i>

1046
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:38,729
<i>You can freely divide them</i>
<i>between your teammates,</i>

1047
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:42,608
<i>but please remember to assign</i>
<i>at least one life to each member.</i>

1048
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,276
This sounds so exciting.

1049
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:46,278
- Won't Ji-min get three lives?
- Maybe.

1050
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:48,363
They'll need to approach it strategically.

1051
00:56:49,031 --> 00:56:52,784
<i>As Team KAIST</i>
<i>managed to survive the longest,</i>

1052
00:56:52,868 --> 00:56:55,120
<i>one of their members</i>
<i>will be the initial host.</i>

1053
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:58,165
<i>The host can choose</i>
<i>the game they would like to play</i>

1054
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:00,709
<i>and the contestant</i>
<i>they would like to compete against.</i>

1055
00:57:00,918 --> 00:57:05,505
<i>The winner's team</i>
<i>will be awarded one point.</i>

1056
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:08,717
<i>Additionally,</i>
<i>the winner will be the next host.</i>

1057
00:57:09,718 --> 00:57:13,055
<i>The loser will lose one life.</i>

1058
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:15,682
<i>When you lose all your lives,</i>

1059
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:18,810
<i>you will be barred</i>
<i>from participating in the game.</i>

1060
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:21,647
It's a true fight to the death.

1061
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:23,857
We'll get an all-out war.

1062
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:25,651
<i>The games will test you</i>

1063
00:57:25,734 --> 00:57:29,237
<i>on reasoning, spatial awareness,</i>
<i>and memorization.</i>

1064
00:57:29,321 --> 00:57:34,826
<i>Relay Match has 18 questions in total,</i>
<i>with 6 questions per game.</i>

1065
00:57:35,494 --> 00:57:41,083
<i>Each team can use the Priority card</i>
<i>once throughout the entire game.</i>

1066
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:44,461
<i>Please note that it can only be used</i>
<i>within 30 seconds</i>

1067
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:46,964
<i>after the host's selection.</i>

1068
00:57:47,047 --> 00:57:51,009
<i>The contestant who uses the Priority card</i>
<i>can compete against the host</i>

1069
00:57:51,093 --> 00:57:53,762
<i>instead of the opponent of their choice.</i>

1070
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,848
Like a substitute.

1071
00:57:57,099 --> 00:57:58,976
<i>Secure points following these rules.</i>

1072
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:03,355
<i>The team with the most points</i>
<i>will be declared the winner.</i>

1073
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:06,233
<i>The winning team</i>
<i>will get their second chance</i>

1074
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:10,362
<i>to rejoin the surviving teams</i>
<i>of the competition.</i>

1075
00:58:10,821 --> 00:58:12,197
You've got this, right?

1076
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:14,324
We have to do well.

1077
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:18,787
- Let's do this.
- We've got this.

1078
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:20,288
Our Ace player.

1079
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:22,165
We're going to win.

1080
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:25,502
<i>We will now reveal the three games</i>

1081
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:29,089
<i>of the redemption round, Relay Match.</i>

1082
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:32,092
<i>The first game</i>
<i>will test your reasoning skills.</i>

1083
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:34,011
<i>It is Time Jump.</i>

1084
00:58:34,094 --> 00:58:35,345
<i>In Time Jump,</i>

1085
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:39,224
<i>your task is to fill in each blank</i>
<i>with one of the given numbers.</i>

1086
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:42,310
<i>The first to make</i>
<i>the correct sentence wins.</i>

1087
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:46,023
<i>You may be asked about dates as well.</i>

1088
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:49,609
USE NUMBERS FROM 1 TO 3
"One hour after 2 o'clock is 3 o'clock."

1089
00:58:49,693 --> 00:58:51,153
"Two hours after 1 o'clock is 3 o'clock."

1090
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:52,863
There are multiple answers.

1091
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:56,658
<i>The second game</i>
<i>will test your spatial awareness.</i>

1092
00:58:56,742 --> 00:58:58,326
<i>It is Pixel Art.</i>

1093
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:01,038
"Pixel"? That may be like Pixel Number.

1094
00:59:01,121 --> 00:59:02,873
I don't get the "art" part.

1095
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:06,293
<i>In Pixel Art, you will be presented</i>
<i>with nine pixel cards in total.</i>

1096
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:09,755
<i>Three of them will match the target</i>
<i>when layered together.</i>

1097
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:11,965
<i>Your task is to find them first.</i>

1098
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:14,801
They have to be overlapped?

1099
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:16,678
Oh, that sounds like fun!

1100
00:59:16,762 --> 00:59:18,513
<i>When you combine the pixel cards,</i>

1101
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:21,933
<i>you can rotate the cards</i>
<i>to get the target image.</i>

1102
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:25,645
Dang, I'm taking back what I just said.

1103
00:59:25,729 --> 00:59:28,273
- Shoot, did I just hear right?
- Oh, man.

1104
00:59:28,774 --> 00:59:30,317
That's tricky.

1105
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:36,114
<i>But the pixel cards may not be flipped</i>
<i>horizontally or vertically.</i>

1106
00:59:36,198 --> 00:59:40,118
<i>The three primary colors in Pixel Art</i>
<i>can be mixed to create secondary colors.</i>

1107
00:59:40,202 --> 00:59:43,163
<i>A red cell layered over a blue cell</i>
<i>will result in a violet cell.</i>

1108
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:46,083
<i>A red cell layered over a yellow cell</i>
<i>will result in an orange cell.</i>

1109
00:59:46,166 --> 00:59:48,835
<i>A blue cell layered over a yellow cell</i>
<i>will result in a green cell.</i>

1110
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:51,713
<i>When all three colors</i>
<i>are layered together,</i>

1111
00:59:51,797 --> 00:59:53,590
<i>you will get a black cell.</i>

1112
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:56,384
<i>To get a secondary color,</i>

1113
00:59:56,468 --> 01:00:00,347
<i>the different colors</i>
<i>must be mixed at a 1-to-1 ratio.</i>

1114
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:04,059
<i>But cells of the same color</i>
<i>can be layered without restrictions.</i>

1115
01:00:04,142 --> 01:00:06,103
They've got to mix the colors?

1116
01:00:06,186 --> 01:00:08,105
That explains the art part.

1117
01:00:08,188 --> 01:00:10,482
The black cells
will be the ones to watch out for.

1118
01:00:10,774 --> 01:00:12,567
The black cells seem important, right?

1119
01:00:12,651 --> 01:00:15,654
Let's use the secondary colors
as our guide.

1120
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:18,740
<i>The third game</i>
<i>will test your memorization skills.</i>

1121
01:00:18,824 --> 01:00:21,535
I hope we get a decent memorization game.

1122
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:23,829
<i>It is Photo Memory.</i>

1123
01:00:23,912 --> 01:00:25,247
<i>In Photo Memory,</i>

1124
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:28,750
<i>you will be shown a set of 10 photos</i>
<i>for 10 seconds each to memorize.</i>

1125
01:00:30,919 --> 01:00:34,548
<i>You will then solve</i>
<i>nine questions in a row.</i>

1126
01:00:35,132 --> 01:00:39,010
<i>The player with more points wins the game.</i>

1127
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:43,473
- What on earth? That sounds outrageous.
- That's just insane.

1128
01:00:43,557 --> 01:00:45,433
It's not a simple memorization game.

1129
01:00:45,517 --> 01:00:47,519
This will actually require
a photographic memory.

1130
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:49,271
That sounds like a blast, though.

1131
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:51,356
- I can crush this.
- Really?

1132
01:00:51,439 --> 01:00:54,484
I can take down anyone
when it comes to pure brainpower shit.

1133
01:00:54,568 --> 01:00:56,403
Watch your language.

1134
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:59,948
Sounds like only Pixel Art
requires strategies.

1135
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:02,159
As for the rest, we can rely on our minds.

1136
01:01:02,242 --> 01:01:06,872
Here's the real problem.
What if Team KAIST won't choose us?

1137
01:01:06,955 --> 01:01:09,166
We'll use the Priority card
and claim the host position.

1138
01:01:09,249 --> 01:01:10,208
I see. Good idea.

1139
01:01:11,126 --> 01:01:13,253
I guess that's what the card is for.

1140
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:15,714
<i>All teams,</i>
<i>please start discussing your strategies.</i>

1141
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:18,967
<i>You'll be given 20 minutes.</i>

1142
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:22,304
All the 1-on-1 games
were saved for this match.

1143
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:24,181
It looks like so much fun.

1144
01:01:24,264 --> 01:01:27,601
This is pretty similar
to Mystery Poker from yesterday.

1145
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:29,227
The more prepared you are,

1146
01:01:29,311 --> 01:01:31,188
- the less confused you get.
- Agreed.

1147
01:01:32,731 --> 01:01:34,900
Can I tell you
about the strategy for Pixel Art first?

1148
01:01:34,983 --> 01:01:35,817
Go ahead.

1149
01:01:36,026 --> 01:01:38,528
We can rotate the pixel cards, right?

1150
01:01:38,612 --> 01:01:39,946
Here's what I think.

1151
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:42,991
Whichever way you rotate it,
the center cell will remain in the spot.

1152
01:01:43,074 --> 01:01:45,535
Why don't we use that as a guide
to sort out the cards?

1153
01:01:46,286 --> 01:01:47,162
I like the idea.

1154
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:50,248
<i>Look at this example.</i>
<i>Since the center cell is white,</i>

1155
01:01:50,332 --> 01:01:52,626
<i>we can exclude the cards</i>
<i>with a colored cell in the center.</i>

1156
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:54,961
EXCLUDE PIXEL CARDS WITH A COLORED CENTER

1157
01:01:55,045 --> 01:01:56,087
<i>If the center cell is black,</i>

1158
01:01:56,171 --> 01:01:58,506
<i>we will need a combination</i>
<i>of red, yellow, and blue.</i>

1159
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:01,509
RED, BLUE, AND YELLOW ARE NEEDED
TO GET THE COLOR BLACK

1160
01:02:01,593 --> 01:02:03,887
That will help us narrow down cases.

1161
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:05,680
Let's try this approach.

1162
01:02:06,598 --> 01:02:09,935
We can focus on the secondary colors,
violet, orange, and green.

1163
01:02:10,018 --> 01:02:13,521
Those narrow down cases to combinations
of white and two different colors.

1164
01:02:13,605 --> 01:02:15,482
You're absolutely right.

1165
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:19,945
<i>To get the three secondary colors</i>
<i>of violet, orange, and green in Pixel Art,</i>

1166
01:02:20,028 --> 01:02:25,492
<i>the relevant primary colors</i>
<i>must be mixed at a 1-to-1 ratio.</i>

1167
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:26,868
<i>However,</i>

1168
01:02:26,952 --> 01:02:30,956
<i>you must use three pixel cards</i>
<i>to get the target image.</i>

1169
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:33,291
<i>As this is the case,</i>

1170
01:02:33,375 --> 01:02:36,628
<i>you will need one white cell</i>
<i>to get the violet cell.</i>

1171
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:38,296
With secondary colors,

1172
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:42,217
you need a set like white, red, and blue
or white, red, and yellow.

1173
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,594
I think it's better to use them
to narrow things down.

1174
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:46,179
- Good idea.
- That way,

1175
01:02:46,263 --> 01:02:47,847
we can easily eliminate a bunch of cards.

1176
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:50,725
I think I can do a good job
with Pixel Art.

1177
01:02:50,809 --> 01:02:53,937
Rather than looking for three cards
that can give me the target,

1178
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:56,731
I'll take the target image
and layer it over the cards.

1179
01:02:56,815 --> 01:03:00,902
<i>Ji-min is suggesting a strategy</i>
<i>of placing the target on the cards.</i>

1180
01:03:00,986 --> 01:03:02,404
<i>This way,</i>

1181
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:06,449
<i>you can eliminate</i>
<i>the unnecessary cards quickly.</i>

1182
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:11,621
I can weed out irrelevant cards
after comparing them to the target.

1183
01:03:11,705 --> 01:03:13,498
When three cards remain, I have my answer.

1184
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:16,501
Layering the target over other cards
sounds pretty good.

1185
01:03:17,294 --> 01:03:18,962
Are there any hacks to Time Jump?

1186
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:20,630
That's the game I'm worried about.

1187
01:03:20,714 --> 01:03:22,716
Why don't we use MOD 30?

1188
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:23,842
With that...

1189
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:26,386
Can you give me an example?
It sounds fuzzy to me.

1190
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:28,513
Let's find out the date
81 days past August 17th.

1191
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:31,266
Add 81 to 17. We get August 98th.

1192
01:03:31,516 --> 01:03:33,893
- Okay, next?
- Divide 98 by 30.

1193
01:03:33,977 --> 01:03:36,563
- Divide it by 30?
- Then, we get a quotient and a remainder.

1194
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:39,149
Use the quotient to update the month.

1195
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:42,068
Then, check how many months with 31 days
come between August and that month.

1196
01:03:42,152 --> 01:03:43,445
- Dock it out?
- Exactly.

1197
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:45,697
August and October
both have 31 days, right?

1198
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:47,365
Now, subtract 2 from 8.

1199
01:03:48,283 --> 01:03:50,368
Subtract 2 from 8?
Is the answer November 6th?

1200
01:03:50,452 --> 01:03:51,494
Yes.

1201
01:03:51,578 --> 01:03:53,413
The key is to correctly count
the months with 31 days.

1202
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:56,082
Make sure to keep that in mind.

1203
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:58,543
Let's move on to dates.
Ever heard of the Doomsday algorithm?

1204
01:03:58,626 --> 01:04:01,087
- Doomsday algorithm?
- I'll tell you all about it.

1205
01:04:01,171 --> 01:04:03,006
There's this chart

1206
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:06,760
that lists one day in every month
that occurs on the same day of the week.

1207
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:08,345
In January, it's the 10th.

1208
01:04:08,428 --> 01:04:10,722
February only has 28 days,
so it's going to be the 28th.

1209
01:04:11,056 --> 01:04:14,851
THE LISTED DATES ALL OCCUR
ON THE SAME DAY OF THE WEEK EVERY YEAR

1210
01:04:14,934 --> 01:04:18,104
Basically, all these days
occur on the same day of the week.

1211
01:04:18,188 --> 01:04:19,189
EXAMPLE
JANUARY 10TH IS A MONDAY

1212
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:21,941
<i>To find out which day September 7th is,</i>

1213
01:04:22,025 --> 01:04:24,194
<i>you can refer to the Doomsday algorithm</i>

1214
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:28,656
<i>to learn that January 10th</i>
<i>and September 5th are both Mondays.</i>

1215
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:31,659
<i>As September 7th</i>
<i>is 2 days past September 5th,</i>

1216
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:34,704
<i>you can deduce</i>
<i>that September 7th is a Wednesday.</i>

1217
01:04:34,788 --> 01:04:35,997
<i>We can use this information</i>

1218
01:04:36,081 --> 01:04:38,708
to tackle the date questions efficiently.

1219
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:40,001
When it comes to people,

1220
01:04:40,085 --> 01:04:42,670
focus on noticeable traits
like wearing a headset.

1221
01:04:42,754 --> 01:04:45,298
Here's what I do
when I need to memorize anything.

1222
01:04:45,382 --> 01:04:47,342
Don't try to capture all the details.

1223
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:51,304
Look at it from afar,
like you're gazing at a forest.

1224
01:04:51,388 --> 01:04:53,556
That way, we can get a general impression.

1225
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:56,434
But short-term memory
is the key to memorization.

1226
01:04:56,518 --> 01:04:57,644
Hit the buzzer right away.

1227
01:04:57,727 --> 01:04:59,437
- Just go for it.
- That's a must.

1228
01:04:59,521 --> 01:05:00,939
If you miss something, you won't recall.

1229
01:05:01,022 --> 01:05:03,108
You need to at least
win a chance to answer.

1230
01:05:03,191 --> 01:05:04,025
Hands down.

1231
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:06,236
Which game do you feel most confident in?

1232
01:05:06,694 --> 01:05:08,279
I'll be okay with any of them.

1233
01:05:08,363 --> 01:05:09,656
No, I feel good about all of them.

1234
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,366
This guy has no weaknesses.

1235
01:05:11,449 --> 01:05:12,784
Do you want 2 lives or 3?

1236
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:14,619
Right, we can give him three lives.

1237
01:05:14,702 --> 01:05:16,830
But three lives might keep people at bay.

1238
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:19,332
Because they'll see Ji-min
as too big a threat?

1239
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:21,167
Okay, then. I'll take two lives.

1240
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:23,086
TEAM KAIST'S LIFE ALLOCATION

1241
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:25,839
TEAM POSTECH'S LIFE ALLOCATION

1242
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:28,550
TEAM YONSEI'S LIFE ALLOCATION

1243
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:33,805
We'll have to win as many points as we can
when we get the initial host position.

1244
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:36,141
Let's make the most of that perk

1245
01:05:36,224 --> 01:05:38,143
- and win a ton of points.
- We've got to.

1246
01:05:38,226 --> 01:05:39,561
Are you up for it?

1247
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:41,479
I am, actually.

1248
01:05:41,563 --> 01:05:43,022
Just end it yourself.

1249
01:05:43,106 --> 01:05:45,483
- You can just...
- You want me to win 12 points?

1250
01:05:45,567 --> 01:05:46,943
- Yeah, go ahead.
- I'd love that.

1251
01:05:47,026 --> 01:05:48,361
Don't lose, Ji-min.

1252
01:05:50,405 --> 01:05:52,240
Both teams think we're lightweights.

1253
01:05:52,323 --> 01:05:55,743
They think we're the weaklings,
so they won't try to avoid us.

1254
01:05:55,827 --> 01:06:00,290
I think there's a chance
they won't even let us compete.

1255
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:02,709
Well, I think that will be to our benefit.

1256
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:06,171
Let them go head-to-head
and exhaust each other's lives--

1257
01:06:06,254 --> 01:06:08,882
Wait, the lives don't matter.
It's all about points.

1258
01:06:09,174 --> 01:06:11,885
You could even say
lives don't have much of an impact.

1259
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:13,178
But not the points.

1260
01:06:13,261 --> 01:06:15,305
We must get a chance to compete
and earn points.

1261
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:17,307
Even if we end up losing,
we've got to compete.

1262
01:06:17,557 --> 01:06:22,228
Let's say Team KAIST goes
after every member of Team POSTECH.

1263
01:06:22,312 --> 01:06:27,275
Team KAIST taking away
Team POSTECH's lives doesn't matter.

1264
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:30,403
What matters is that they're taking
the points that could have been ours.

1265
01:06:30,487 --> 01:06:31,446
Here's my pitch.

1266
01:06:31,529 --> 01:06:33,823
If Team KAIST selects Team POSTECH
two times in a row,

1267
01:06:33,907 --> 01:06:35,742
we should use the Priority card.

1268
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:39,746
We'll let them take two points,
but we'll get into the game from Round 3.

1269
01:06:40,872 --> 01:06:44,459
Remember the two guys besides Jun-u,
my opponent in the Deathmatch?

1270
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:45,835
I think they have a bad memory.

1271
01:06:46,169 --> 01:06:48,213
Oh, I didn't say anything.

1272
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:53,259
They seem like math and physics prodigies
who are terrible at memorization.

1273
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:56,387
I think you need to be prepared.

1274
01:06:56,471 --> 01:06:57,514
- Okay.
- Got it?

1275
01:06:57,597 --> 01:07:01,643
There's a high chance
Team KAIST will come after you first.

1276
01:07:01,726 --> 01:07:03,853
Alternatively,
they might go after Team Yonsei.

1277
01:07:03,937 --> 01:07:06,523
They'll remember your performance
from the Deathmatch.

1278
01:07:06,606 --> 01:07:09,567
They've seen you get nervous,
so you'll be high on their target list.

1279
01:07:09,651 --> 01:07:12,445
- I want you to be mentally prepared.
- Okay, I will.

1280
01:07:12,529 --> 01:07:13,988
One more thing.

1281
01:07:14,072 --> 01:07:16,241
Let's say we get picked to compete.

1282
01:07:16,324 --> 01:07:18,993
Then, please remember
that this is a favorable setup for us.

1283
01:07:19,536 --> 01:07:21,371
So be confident

1284
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:24,290
- and just think about winning, okay?
- Good point.

1285
01:07:24,374 --> 01:07:28,836
If there's any chance
you can control the situation,

1286
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,505
leave Ji-hoo for me.

1287
01:07:30,588 --> 01:07:31,631
I want to take him down.

1288
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:33,967
LEE JUN-U VOWS TO GET HIS REVENGE
FOR DOUBLE-SIDED BINGO

1289
01:07:34,259 --> 01:07:36,594
Let's not underestimate
Team KAIST and Team POSTECH.

1290
01:07:36,678 --> 01:07:38,096
Yeah, we need to focus.

1291
01:07:38,179 --> 01:07:40,431
There's a chance we might lose,
so let's keep our focus.

1292
01:07:40,515 --> 01:07:42,058
We don't want to regret it later.

1293
01:07:42,141 --> 01:07:45,061
- Think of this as a Deathmatch.
- It is a Deathmatch.

1294
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:47,689
It's a three-way Deathmatch.

1295
01:07:48,147 --> 01:07:49,190
Let's make it back.

1296
01:07:49,274 --> 01:07:51,484
It's time to awaken the other me.

1297
01:07:51,568 --> 01:07:53,236
I have two souls inside of me.

1298
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:54,362
Two hearts.

1299
01:07:54,445 --> 01:07:55,405
Yeah, two hearts.

1300
01:07:55,488 --> 01:07:56,406
BOTH HAVE 2 LIVES

1301
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:58,992
<i>The time for strategy meeting is up.</i>

1302
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:03,538
<i>All teams, please gather</i>
<i>at the main hall for the match.</i>

1303
01:08:03,871 --> 01:08:06,124
- KAIST!
- Let's go!

1304
01:08:06,207 --> 01:08:07,834
- POSTECH!
- Let's go!

1305
01:08:08,418 --> 01:08:11,087
- Akaraka!
- Let's go, Yonsei!

1306
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:23,266
<i>We will now begin the redemption round,</i>

1307
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:26,352
<i>Relay Match.</i>

1308
01:08:26,436 --> 01:08:28,771
- This is going to be fun.
- It will be epic.

1309
01:08:29,022 --> 01:08:31,524
I hope Team KAIST doesn't return.
They're so scary.

1310
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:34,193
I'd hate to face Ji-min in another game.

1311
01:08:34,277 --> 01:08:36,321
<i>I hope this match will drain them.</i>

1312
01:08:36,988 --> 01:08:41,618
Team KAIST, please announce
which contestant will play as the host.

1313
01:08:42,076 --> 01:08:44,037
I'll be the first host.

1314
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:47,665
- All right, Ji-min.
- Ji-min.

1315
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:49,751
He has a thunderous voice.

1316
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:50,835
He has great energy.

1317
01:08:50,918 --> 01:08:52,879
Yeah, and his energy
can really throw you off.

1318
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:54,964
He must have nerves of steel.
He's always confident.

1319
01:08:55,048 --> 01:08:58,176
It looks like Ji-min does
all the heavy lifting for Team KAIST.

1320
01:08:58,635 --> 01:09:00,511
<i>He's their Ace player.</i>

1321
01:09:02,055 --> 01:09:07,143
The host, Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min,
will now select the game.

1322
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:08,311
6 QUESTIONS EACH

1323
01:09:08,645 --> 01:09:10,563
I wonder what he'll choose.

1324
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:13,983
I'll go with Pixel Art.

1325
01:09:14,067 --> 01:09:18,071
Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min
selected Pixel Art.

1326
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:22,950
Please choose your opponent.

1327
01:09:25,953 --> 01:09:29,123
<i>Team KAIST's priority now</i>
<i>is to find the weakest team.</i>

1328
01:09:29,207 --> 01:09:31,668
<i>I think he'll go with Team POSTECH</i>
<i>because of their rivalry.</i>

1329
01:09:31,751 --> 01:09:33,753
<i>Sure, who can resist a rival match?</i>

1330
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:39,425
I'll play against
Team POSTECH's Hwang Seok-hun.

1331
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:43,513
Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min
chose Team POSTECH's Hwang Seok-hun.

1332
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:47,058
- Good luck out there. Don't get nervous.
- I won't.

1333
01:09:47,892 --> 01:09:50,311
- It's the first game, so no pressure.
- Good luck.

1334
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:51,854
You've got this.

1335
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:57,026
- Let's have a good game.
- Looking forward to it.

1336
01:09:59,278 --> 01:10:02,615
I really hope he'll do well.

1337
01:10:03,825 --> 01:10:05,618
<i>I wanted to repay my friends' trust in me.</i>

1338
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:09,455
<i>So I tried to empty my mind</i>
<i>and give the game my undivided attention.</i>

1339
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:14,001
<i>I thought my mission was to stay</i>
<i>as the host as long as I could.</i>

1340
01:10:14,085 --> 01:10:16,003
<i>Basically, I had to win at all costs.</i>

1341
01:10:16,546 --> 01:10:18,464
If Ji-min finishes Team POSTECH off,

1342
01:10:18,548 --> 01:10:20,091
- he can decide the match.
- Absolutely.

1343
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:22,593
Remember how Team KAIST
shipped Team POSTECH off?

1344
01:10:22,677 --> 01:10:24,178
- In the Deathmatch?
- You're right.

1345
01:10:24,262 --> 01:10:27,557
Those two already had a face-off.

1346
01:10:28,015 --> 01:10:29,934
<i>The first rival match</i>
<i>after the Deathmatch.</i>

1347
01:10:30,017 --> 01:10:31,102
REUNION OF THE OLD RIVALS

1348
01:10:31,185 --> 01:10:33,354
Let us begin Pixel Art.

1349
01:10:33,771 --> 01:10:37,275
THEY MUST SELECT 3 PIXEL CARDS

1350
01:10:43,948 --> 01:10:46,117
- Dang, this is confusing.
- Totally.

1351
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:48,619
I spotted a promising card,
but I can't find it now.

1352
01:10:55,042 --> 01:10:56,544
Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min.

1353
01:10:57,003 --> 01:10:58,880
I'll go with Pixel Cards 3, 7, and 8.

1354
01:11:00,214 --> 01:11:01,716
Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min.

1355
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:05,428
That is correct.

1356
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:10,600
PIXEL CARDS 3 AND 7: 180-DEGREE ROTATION

1357
01:11:11,726 --> 01:11:14,020
PERFECT MATCH TO THE TARGET

1358
01:11:15,855 --> 01:11:17,064
How did he get it so quickly?

1359
01:11:17,148 --> 01:11:19,358
- That speed, though.
- How can he solve it so fast?

1360
01:11:19,442 --> 01:11:20,693
You've got to hand it to him.

1361
01:11:20,777 --> 01:11:24,572
Team POSTECH's Hwang Seok-hun.
You lost a life.

1362
01:11:26,199 --> 01:11:27,492
What a shame.

1363
01:11:27,992 --> 01:11:30,161
You still did a great job.

1364
01:11:31,662 --> 01:11:33,748
CURRENT STANDINGS
YONSEI: 0, KAIST: 1, POSTECH: 0

1365
01:11:33,831 --> 01:11:37,376
Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min.
Please select the next game.

1366
01:11:37,627 --> 01:11:39,253
I'll go with Pixel Art.

1367
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:45,551
Please choose your opponent.

1368
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:47,929
It will get wild
if he chooses Seok-hun again.

1369
01:11:49,055 --> 01:11:50,306
That's so hardcore.

1370
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:52,308
That's the right move
to secure your survival.

1371
01:11:52,892 --> 01:11:54,352
Call Seok-hun again.

1372
01:11:55,853 --> 01:11:57,855
I'll play against Team POSTECH's...

1373
01:11:58,439 --> 01:12:00,775
Team POSTECH's Jae Seung-gyu, please.

1374
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:05,154
He's targeting people with two lives.

1375
01:12:05,238 --> 01:12:07,073
He's docking everyone's life.

1376
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:09,033
Looks like he's planning
to wipe out Team POSTECH.

1377
01:12:09,116 --> 01:12:10,827
Here is your question.

1378
01:12:10,910 --> 01:12:13,955
TARGET

1379
01:12:24,465 --> 01:12:25,466
Pixel Card 1's a must, no?

1380
01:12:25,550 --> 01:12:27,343
You need that for the yellow center.

1381
01:12:27,426 --> 01:12:28,344
That's my point.

1382
01:12:31,055 --> 01:12:32,181
Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min.

1383
01:12:32,598 --> 01:12:35,351
I'll go with Pixel Cards 1, 4, and 7.

1384
01:12:38,104 --> 01:12:39,397
That is correct.

1385
01:12:39,981 --> 01:12:42,108
You will remain as the host.

1386
01:12:43,109 --> 01:12:44,235
Damn it.

1387
01:12:45,236 --> 01:12:49,615
PIXEL CARD 1: 90-DEGREE ROTATION,
PIXEL CARDS 4 AND 7: 180-DEGREE ROTATION

1388
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:52,118
PERFECT MATCH TO THE TARGET

1389
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:55,872
Team POSTECH's Jae Seung-gyu lost a life.

1390
01:12:56,247 --> 01:12:57,790
CURRENT STANDINGS
YONSEI: 0, KAIST: 2, POSTECH: 0

1391
01:12:57,874 --> 01:12:59,750
Samsung has a bright future ahead.

1392
01:12:59,834 --> 01:13:00,668
- What?
- Samsung.

1393
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:02,503
Oh, because he majors
in semiconductor engineering?

1394
01:13:04,088 --> 01:13:05,548
THE FUTURE OF SEMICONDUCTORS IN KOREA

1395
01:13:05,631 --> 01:13:08,301
SEMICONDUCTOR SYSTEM ENGINEERING MAJOR
AND KAIST-SAMSUNG SCHOLARSHIP RECIPIENT

1396
01:13:09,594 --> 01:13:11,804
I'll go with Pixel Art.

1397
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:13,848
Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min.

1398
01:13:13,931 --> 01:13:16,934
Please choose your opponent.

1399
01:13:22,899 --> 01:13:24,817
I'll play against
Team POSTECH's Jae Seung-gyu.

1400
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:30,197
- Didn't he just beat Seung-gyu?
- Yeah.

1401
01:13:31,157 --> 01:13:32,617
That's cruel.

1402
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:36,787
- Things might get physical after this.
- Looks like it.

1403
01:13:36,871 --> 01:13:41,083
If he keeps on hounding Team POSTECH only,
Team KAIST will make it back.

1404
01:13:41,334 --> 01:13:42,919
That seems to be their game plan.

1405
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:46,172
<i>Honestly speaking,</i>
<i>I saw Team Yonsei as a bigger threat.</i>

1406
01:13:46,672 --> 01:13:48,925
I think we should target
a single team early on.

1407
01:13:49,008 --> 01:13:52,553
Why don't we strike Team POSTECH
when we have the host position?

1408
01:13:52,637 --> 01:13:54,722
Team POSTECH itself isn't our main target.

1409
01:13:54,805 --> 01:13:57,099
Team Yonsei
will probably target Team POSTECH,

1410
01:13:57,183 --> 01:13:59,435
so we should claim the points
before they can.

1411
01:14:00,061 --> 01:14:01,687
To keep Team Yonsei from winning points?

1412
01:14:01,771 --> 01:14:03,064
Exactly.

1413
01:14:03,898 --> 01:14:06,609
JEON JI-MIN CHOSE
TEAM KAIST CONTESTANTS 3 TIMES IN A ROW

1414
01:14:07,234 --> 01:14:08,444
Let's keep it cool.

1415
01:14:08,527 --> 01:14:10,696
The host, Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min,

1416
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:13,783
chose Team KAIST's Jae Seung-gyu
as his opponent.

1417
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,160
Team Yonsei will use the Priority card.

1418
01:14:16,535 --> 01:14:18,663
Team Yonsei will use the Priority card.

1419
01:14:21,248 --> 01:14:22,750
Seung-gyu is being replaced.

1420
01:14:22,959 --> 01:14:26,128
Team Yonsei must've thought
they had to cut in now for survival.

1421
01:14:26,212 --> 01:14:30,675
Team Yonsei's Choi A-in
used the Priority card.

1422
01:14:30,758 --> 01:14:34,011
<i>My team expected to get overlooked</i>
<i>for two rounds.</i>

1423
01:14:34,095 --> 01:14:36,263
<i>That didn't mean</i>
<i>we had to just stand and watch.</i>

1424
01:14:36,347 --> 01:14:38,557
The host will have a new opponent
for this round.

1425
01:14:38,641 --> 01:14:42,228
Team Yonsei's Choi A-in,
please come to the stage.

1426
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:43,479
Good luck.

1427
01:14:46,273 --> 01:14:47,692
Let's have a good game.

1428
01:14:49,694 --> 01:14:51,737
<i>I saw him beat two opponents back-to-back,</i>

1429
01:14:51,821 --> 01:14:54,407
<i>so I knew he wasn't going</i>
<i>to be an easy mark.</i>

1430
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:56,742
<i>Still, I didn't let that make me nervous.</i>

1431
01:14:57,702 --> 01:14:58,703
Is it 1, 4, and 7?

1432
01:14:58,786 --> 01:15:00,204
Aren't they the answer?

1433
01:15:00,287 --> 01:15:01,831
A-IN SOLVED THE PREVIOUS QUESTION
FASTER THAN JI-MIN

1434
01:15:02,665 --> 01:15:04,000
I want to volunteer.

1435
01:15:05,084 --> 01:15:08,170
<i>I told myself, "He may be good,</i>
<i>but not overwhelmingly good."</i>

1436
01:15:08,462 --> 01:15:10,131
<i>I was actually expecting</i>

1437
01:15:10,214 --> 01:15:12,633
<i>that they would make a move</i>
<i>to take the host position.</i>

1438
01:15:12,717 --> 01:15:15,553
<i>A-in is a strong contender</i>
<i>with good results in the pre-test,</i>

1439
01:15:15,803 --> 01:15:17,930
<i>so I tensed up a bit.</i>

1440
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:20,474
Here is your question.

1441
01:15:21,308 --> 01:15:24,520
TARGET

1442
01:15:33,279 --> 01:15:36,240
Do they need yellow and red to get orange?

1443
01:15:36,323 --> 01:15:37,199
Yes.

1444
01:15:37,742 --> 01:15:39,410
They'll need Pixel Card 9.

1445
01:15:46,083 --> 01:15:48,377
I'll go with Pixel Cards 4, 7...

1446
01:15:50,504 --> 01:15:51,630
and 6.

1447
01:15:56,802 --> 01:15:59,180
Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min.
That is incorrect.

1448
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:04,143
PIXEL CARDS 4, 6, 7: WRONG COMBINATION

1449
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:06,062
Come on, A-in.

1450
01:16:08,522 --> 01:16:10,024
Team Yonsei's Choi A-in.

1451
01:16:10,608 --> 01:16:12,735
I'll go with Pixel Cards 2, 4, and 9.

1452
01:16:17,698 --> 01:16:20,284
Team Yonsei's Choi A-in. That is correct.

1453
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,749
<i>I failed to win</i>
<i>as many points as I could as the host,</i>

1454
01:16:26,832 --> 01:16:27,833
<i>so that was disappointing.</i>

1455
01:16:27,917 --> 01:16:29,585
- She took it from him.
- She did it.

1456
01:16:29,668 --> 01:16:31,837
- I got so nervous just now.
- Same here.

1457
01:16:32,713 --> 01:16:34,965
So Ji-min went down?

1458
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:41,097
PIXEL CARD 2: 180-DEGREE ROTATION
PIXEL CARDS 4 AND 9: 90-DEGREE ROTATION

1459
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:43,599
PERFECT MATCH TO THE TARGET

1460
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:47,061
Team Yonsei's Choi A-in is the new host.

1461
01:16:47,144 --> 01:16:49,522
<i>It was satisfying</i>
<i>to contribute to my team.</i>

1462
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:54,151
<i>It gave me hope that I could lead</i>
<i>my team to victory and survival.</i>

1463
01:16:54,819 --> 01:16:56,112
Such a shame.

1464
01:16:58,697 --> 01:17:00,449
CURRENT STANDINGS
YONSEI: 1, KAIST: 2, POSTECH: 0

1465
01:17:00,533 --> 01:17:01,575
Did I win two points?

1466
01:17:02,076 --> 01:17:03,119
<i>I wasn't concerned before,</i>

1467
01:17:03,202 --> 01:17:05,287
<i>but I started to worry</i>
<i>that things might go down</i>

1468
01:17:05,371 --> 01:17:07,373
<i>after my initial loss.</i>

1469
01:17:07,748 --> 01:17:08,916
How do we proceed?

1470
01:17:08,999 --> 01:17:10,793
I think we can wait it out.

1471
01:17:11,252 --> 01:17:14,004
She may choose one of us.

1472
01:17:14,421 --> 01:17:18,134
Team Yonsei's Choi A-in.
Please select the next game.

1473
01:17:18,551 --> 01:17:20,886
I'll go with Pixel Art.

1474
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:24,640
Please choose your opponent.

1475
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:29,562
<i>I thought I had to choose someone</i>
<i>I could certainly defeat.</i>

1476
01:17:33,274 --> 01:17:35,860
You think she's looking at me?
Maybe it's you.

1477
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:42,825
Will she choose Team POSTECH, too?

1478
01:17:42,908 --> 01:17:45,452
- I won't blame them if they get offended.
- Me neither.

1479
01:17:45,536 --> 01:17:48,914
- She has to do what's best for her team.
- Yeah, that's true.

1480
01:17:49,123 --> 01:17:51,667
CHOI A-IN WALKS UP TO TEAM POSTECH

1481
01:17:52,084 --> 01:17:54,044
Do I have any volunteers?

1482
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:55,796
Do I have any volunteers?

1483
01:18:00,092 --> 01:18:02,303
<i>When provoked, people tend to tense up.</i>

1484
01:18:02,386 --> 01:18:05,431
<i>I was hoping to intimidate them</i>
<i>with my surprise question.</i>

1485
01:18:07,224 --> 01:18:09,685
I choose Team POSTECH's Jae Seung-gyu
as my opponent.

1486
01:18:10,019 --> 01:18:13,147
- Okay, I'll see you later.
- Focus, okay? She's not so fast.

1487
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:16,942
HOST: TEAM YONSEI, CHOI A-IN
OPPONENT: TEAM POSTECH, JAE SEUNG-GYU

1488
01:18:17,234 --> 01:18:18,485
That should make him mad.

1489
01:18:18,569 --> 01:18:19,570
WHY?

1490
01:18:19,653 --> 01:18:21,113
He got selected three times.

1491
01:18:21,197 --> 01:18:23,073
<i>I was chosen three times in a row.</i>

1492
01:18:23,157 --> 01:18:25,326
<i>That didn't make me feel great, exactly.</i>

1493
01:18:25,409 --> 01:18:27,203
<i>It fueled my drive to win.</i>

1494
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:29,496
Here is your question.

1495
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:33,000
TARGET

1496
01:18:34,418 --> 01:18:35,794
This one is difficult.

1497
01:18:35,878 --> 01:18:37,546
It's gotten much harder.

1498
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:39,840
We had more empty cells in earlier rounds.

1499
01:18:58,484 --> 01:18:59,652
So soon?

1500
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:01,695
Wow, he has a lot of fight left in him.

1501
01:19:01,904 --> 01:19:03,864
I'll go with Pixel Cards 4, 5, and 9.

1502
01:19:05,783 --> 01:19:08,619
PIXEL CARDS 4, 5, 9: WRONG COMBINATION

1503
01:19:08,702 --> 01:19:11,580
Team POSTECH's Jae Seung-gyu.
That is incorrect.

1504
01:19:11,664 --> 01:19:14,124
Your opponent will now get
the chance to answer.

1505
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:16,418
Why is my heart racing?

1506
01:19:21,507 --> 01:19:22,925
You have five seconds left.

1507
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:27,054
Come on.

1508
01:19:29,431 --> 01:19:30,391
Ten seconds have passed.

1509
01:19:30,474 --> 01:19:33,727
OPEN FLOOR AFTER 10 SECONDS
Both contestants are allowed to answer.

1510
01:19:33,811 --> 01:19:35,354
Please help us out, Seung-gyu.

1511
01:19:39,483 --> 01:19:41,360
I'll go with Pixel Cards 1, 5, and 9.

1512
01:19:42,027 --> 01:19:43,529
Team POSTECH's Jae Seung-gyu.

1513
01:19:47,658 --> 01:19:48,784
That is correct.

1514
01:19:50,536 --> 01:19:54,415
PIXEL CARD 1: 90-DEGREE ROTATION,
PIXEL CARDS 5 AND 9: 180-DEGREE ROTATION

1515
01:19:55,416 --> 01:19:56,375
PERFECT MATCH TO THE TARGET

1516
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:57,459
That is correct.

1517
01:19:58,585 --> 01:20:02,172
Team POSTECH's Jae Seung-gyu
is the new host.

1518
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:03,716
<i>It felt amazing.</i>

1519
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:06,719
<i>I finally got the chance</i>
<i>to show everyone my worth.</i>

1520
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:09,888
Team Yonsei used the Priority card,
but they only earned a single point.

1521
01:20:09,972 --> 01:20:11,265
They're in big trouble.

1522
01:20:11,598 --> 01:20:14,226
Team Yonsei's Choi A-in lost a life.

1523
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:16,270
Please return to your place.

1524
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:21,817

The host, Team POSTECH's Jae Seung-gyu,

1526
01:20:23,986 --> 01:20:25,779
will now select the next game.

1527
01:20:26,155 --> 01:20:27,906
I'll go with Time Jump.

1528
01:20:28,157 --> 01:20:30,409
I'm so curious. I wanted to try that one.

1529
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:32,036
All right. Time Jump!

1530
01:20:32,119 --> 01:20:33,537
I can't wait.

1531
01:20:33,996 --> 01:20:35,414
Good.

1532
01:20:35,497 --> 01:20:38,500
Please choose your opponent.

1533
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:46,800
<i>I wanted to get back on stage,</i>
<i>beat him, and reclaim the host role.</i>

1534
01:20:47,468 --> 01:20:49,011
I wonder who he'll choose.

1535
01:20:50,054 --> 01:20:52,097
CHOOSE SOMEONE FROM TEAM KAIST

1536
01:20:52,598 --> 01:20:56,060
HAND SIGNAL RECEIVED

1537
01:20:58,312 --> 01:21:00,356
I'll play against Team KAIST's Kim Ji-u.

1538
01:21:00,814 --> 01:21:03,192
Team KAIST's Kim Ji-u,
please come to the stage.

1539
01:21:08,739 --> 01:21:10,240
Here's your question.

1540
01:21:11,367 --> 01:21:12,618
USE NUMBERS FROM 1 TO 6

1541
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:16,997
(2-DIGIT) MINUTES PAST (1-DIGIT):(1-DIGIT)
IS (1-DIGIT):(1-DIGIT)

1542
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:22,378
Team POSTECH's Jae Seung-gyu.

1543
01:21:22,461 --> 01:21:24,380
- Already?
- He has an answer already?

1544
01:21:25,255 --> 01:21:27,007
- So quick.
- He's so fast.

1545
01:21:27,257 --> 01:21:28,759
Please state your answer.

1546
01:21:29,927 --> 01:21:34,848
The answer is,
62 minutes past 4:01 is 5:03.

1547
01:21:36,141 --> 01:21:38,477
Team POSTECH's Jae Seung-gyu.
That is correct.

1548
01:21:42,731 --> 01:21:45,150
Is this the beginning
of a new king's reign?

1549
01:21:45,567 --> 01:21:47,152
<i>I hope Team POSTECH crushes them.</i>

1550
01:21:47,236 --> 01:21:51,490
- A shot at Team Yonsei...
- A shot at Team KAIST. Bang, bang.

1551

Please select the next game.

1553
01:21:58,414 --> 01:22:00,999
I'll go with Time Jump.

1554
01:22:01,208 --> 01:22:03,502
Please choose your opponent.

1555
01:22:04,711 --> 01:22:05,921
Why don't you choose me?

1556
01:22:06,630 --> 01:22:08,465
Why don't you choose me?

1557
01:22:08,549 --> 01:22:11,051
Should I raise my hand?

1558
01:22:17,141 --> 01:22:18,642
Go with Team KAIST one more time.

1559
01:22:19,309 --> 01:22:22,062
<i>Because we had seen</i>
<i>Team Yonsei playing an active role</i>

1560
01:22:22,146 --> 01:22:23,814
<i>in preparing strategies</i>
<i>for Mine and Trade,</i>

1561
01:22:23,897 --> 01:22:26,400
<i>we determined that</i>
<i>they would be harder to defeat.</i>

1562
01:22:26,483 --> 01:22:30,737
<i>That's why we decided</i>
<i>to target Team KAIST instead.</i>

1563
01:22:31,238 --> 01:22:32,156
HOST: TEAM POSTECH, JAE SEUNG-GYU

1564
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:34,450
I'll play against
Team KAIST's Kang Ji-hoo.

1565
01:22:35,617 --> 01:22:36,827
- This isn't good.
- Who did he want?

1566
01:22:36,910 --> 01:22:38,287
Someone from Team KAIST.

1567
01:22:39,455 --> 01:22:41,248
Let us begin Time Jump.

1568
01:22:41,331 --> 01:22:43,208
Here is your question.

1569
01:22:43,292 --> 01:22:45,002
USE NUMBERS FROM 1 TO 7

1570
01:22:45,085 --> 01:22:50,132
(2-DIGIT) MINUTES PAST (1-DIGIT):(1-DIGIT)
IS (1-DIGIT):(2-DIGIT)

1571
01:23:12,112 --> 01:23:13,572
That startled me.

1572
01:23:19,036 --> 01:23:19,995
Seventy...

1573
01:23:22,789 --> 01:23:26,585
<i>My mind went blank after I blurted out 70.</i>
<i>I couldn't recall the answer.</i>

1574
01:23:26,668 --> 01:23:29,046
Your opponent will now get
the chance to answer.

1575
01:23:29,129 --> 01:23:30,631
TEAM POSTECH CAN ANSWER NOW

1576
01:23:30,714 --> 01:23:32,132
Team POSTECH's Jae Seung-gyu.

1577
01:23:32,216 --> 01:23:37,304
The answer is,
76 minutes past 3:05 is 4:21.

1578
01:23:37,638 --> 01:23:40,098
Team POSTECH's Jae Seung-gyu.
That is correct.

1579
01:23:41,058 --> 01:23:41,892
He's good.

1580
01:23:42,476 --> 01:23:45,395
- He's really good.
- Seung-gyu is on fire.

1581
01:23:45,979 --> 01:23:49,107
Team POSTECH's Jae Seung-gyu
will remain as the host.

1582
01:23:49,483 --> 01:23:51,401
<i>The new king's reign has begun.</i>

1583
01:23:51,485 --> 01:23:54,613
Now, I don't even want Team POSTECH.
Why are they all so good?

1584
01:23:54,696 --> 01:23:57,491
I wish the winner didn't have to join us.

1585
01:23:57,574 --> 01:23:59,910
I hope the creators
will scrap the redemption round.

1586
01:23:59,993 --> 01:24:02,871
Seung-gyu has won
three consecutive rounds.

1587
01:24:03,205 --> 01:24:04,248
Team KAIST's Kang Ji-hoo.

1588
01:24:04,331 --> 01:24:07,584
You don't have any life left
and cannot compete anymore.

1589
01:24:07,668 --> 01:24:08,669
Please leave the main hall.

1590
01:24:08,752 --> 01:24:11,088
- Good luck, guys.
- We'll do our best.

1591
01:24:12,339 --> 01:24:13,882
<i>It was very upsetting.</i>

1592
01:24:13,966 --> 01:24:17,469
<i>I felt terrible that I failed</i>
<i>to help secure our team's survival.</i>

1593

1595
01:24:24,059 --> 01:24:25,477
I'll go with Time Jump.

1596
01:24:26,144 --> 01:24:27,187
Who will he choose next?

1597
01:24:27,563 --> 01:24:28,981
He'll choose one of us now.

1598
01:24:33,485 --> 01:24:35,028
HOST: TEAM POSTECH, JAE SEUNG-GYU

1599
01:24:35,112 --> 01:24:37,239
I'll play against
Team KAIST's Kim Jae-han.

1600
01:24:38,365 --> 01:24:40,033
Team KAIST again?

1601
01:24:41,994 --> 01:24:44,246
- He chose Jae-han.
- He's out to crush them one by one.

1602
01:24:44,329 --> 01:24:46,456
- Seung-gyu's good.
- I'm enjoying this.

1603
01:24:49,668 --> 01:24:52,254
Okay. You've got this, Jae-han.

1604
01:24:52,504 --> 01:24:54,131
Let us begin Time Jump.

1605
01:24:54,214 --> 01:24:55,716
Here is your question.

1606
01:24:55,799 --> 01:24:57,050
USE NUMBERS FROM 0 TO 7

1607
01:24:59,386 --> 01:25:01,096
They need a three-digit number?

1608
01:25:01,513 --> 01:25:03,223
(3-DIGIT) MINUTES PAST (1-DIGIT):(2-DIGIT)
IS (1-DIGIT):(1-DIGIT)

1609
01:25:03,307 --> 01:25:04,266
What?

1610
01:25:04,975 --> 01:25:05,809
Are you serious?

1611
01:25:05,892 --> 01:25:09,730
(3-DIGIT) MINUTES PAST (1-DIGIT):(2-DIGIT)
IS (1-DIGIT):(1-DIGIT)

1612
01:25:09,813 --> 01:25:14,067
NOTE: DON'T USE 0 FOR THE HOUR

1613
01:25:14,318 --> 01:25:16,778
Zero has to go in the middle
of the three-digit number.

1614
01:25:16,862 --> 01:25:18,238
It can't go anywhere else.

1615
01:25:18,322 --> 01:25:20,532
So the 3-digit number must be
in the 100s or the 200s.

1616
01:25:20,616 --> 01:25:22,784
I'd say it's in the 200s.

1617
01:25:27,581 --> 01:25:30,459
<i>I thought,</i>
<i>"I'm so screwed. It's all over."</i>

1618
01:25:30,542 --> 01:25:32,336
Please...

1619
01:25:32,502 --> 01:25:35,797
The answer is,
206 minutes past 4:35 is 7:01.

1620
01:25:36,548 --> 01:25:38,342
Team POSTECH's Jae Seung-gyu.

1621
01:25:40,385 --> 01:25:41,970
206 MINUTES PAST 4:35 IS 7:01

1622
01:25:42,054 --> 01:25:43,055
That is incorrect.

1623
01:25:43,138 --> 01:25:45,390
Your opponent will now get
the chance to answer.

1624
01:25:49,227 --> 01:25:51,521
You've got this, Jae-han. Take your shot.

1625
01:25:51,730 --> 01:25:53,106
You have five seconds left.

1626
01:25:55,317 --> 01:25:56,485
Ten seconds have passed.

1627
01:25:56,568 --> 01:25:59,363
Both contestants are allowed to answer.

1628
01:26:01,406 --> 01:26:02,658
Team KAIST's Kim Jae-han.

1629
01:26:02,949 --> 01:26:08,080
The answer is,
205 minutes past 3:41 is 7:06.

1630
01:26:12,668 --> 01:26:15,212
Team KAIST's Kim Jae-han. That is correct.

1631
01:26:19,383 --> 01:26:23,178
Team KAIST's Kim Jae-han is the new host.

1632
01:26:24,930 --> 01:26:26,556
This changes everything.

1633
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:28,642
That means Seung-gyu is out of life, no?

1634
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:31,728
Team POSTECH's Jae Seung-gyu.
You don't have any life left

1635
01:26:32,270 --> 01:26:34,314
and cannot compete anymore.

1636
01:26:34,398 --> 01:26:35,774

01:27:00,674 --> 01:27:03,051
Excuse me, Jae-han.

1643
01:27:03,427 --> 01:27:05,887
Why don't you choose one of us?
Come on, we're game.

1644
01:27:06,263 --> 01:27:08,306
<i>I couldn't just stand there.</i>
<i>I had to do something.</i>

1645

<i>So I threw down the gauntlet.</i>

1646
01:27:16,857 --> 01:27:17,941
I'll play against...

1647
01:27:18,525 --> 01:27:20,819
I'll play against Park Seo-yeon.

1648
01:27:20,902 --> 01:27:23,113
Targeting one team
is the right strategy here.

1649
01:27:23,363 --> 01:27:25,741
- I knew he'd go with Team POSTECH.
- He had to.

1650
01:27:25,824 --> 01:27:27,367
He needs to be strategic.

1651
01:27:27,451 --> 01:27:30,620
Team Yonsei made a big blunder,
using the Priority card too soon.

1652
01:27:30,954 --> 01:27:32,497
<i>They should've saved it.</i>

1653
01:27:32,956 --> 01:27:35,709
I should've held on to the host position.

1654
01:27:35,792 --> 01:27:38,336
I'm sorry
I didn't get to keep it for long.

1655
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:39,421
It's okay.

1656
01:27:40,046 --> 01:27:41,548
- Hello.
- Hello.

1657
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:44,926
Here's your question.

1658
01:27:45,010 --> 01:27:46,428
USE NUMBERS FROM 0 TO 5

1659
01:27:46,511 --> 01:27:48,722
THE NEW QUESTION INVOLVES DATES

1660
01:27:48,805 --> 01:27:50,265
Finally.

1661
01:27:50,515 --> 01:27:52,058
We've got dates now?

1662
01:27:52,142 --> 01:27:55,479
(2-DIGIT) DAYS PAST (1-DIGIT)/(1-DIGIT)
IS (1-DIGIT)/(1-DIGIT)

1663
01:27:55,562 --> 01:27:59,274
NOTE: FEBRUARY ALWAYS HAS 28 DAYS

1664
01:27:59,566 --> 01:28:00,984
Where do we put the zero?

1665
01:28:01,067 --> 01:28:04,529
It can only go into the second digit
in the two-digit number, right?

1666
01:28:04,613 --> 01:28:07,491
Okay, then. That means
the first month is an odd month.

1667
01:28:10,786 --> 01:28:12,204
Team KAIST's Kim Jae-han.

1668
01:28:12,579 --> 01:28:15,373
The answer is,
30 days past January 5th is February 4th.

1669
01:28:15,457 --> 01:28:17,709
Team KAIST's Kim Jae-han. That is correct.

1670
01:28:17,793 --> 01:28:19,628
You will remain as the host.

1671
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:22,756
TEAM POSTECH'S PARK SEO-YEON IS ELIMINATED

1672
01:28:22,839 --> 01:28:24,758
CURRENT STANDINGS
YONSEI: 1, KAIST: 4, POSTECH: 3

1673
01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:29,721
The host, Team KAIST's Kim Jae-han,
will now select the next game.

1674
01:28:30,263 --> 01:28:31,640
I'll go with Pixel Art.

1675
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:35,769
Team KAIST's Kim Jae-han
selected Pixel Art.

1676
01:28:35,852 --> 01:28:38,772
Please choose your opponent.

1677
01:28:40,357 --> 01:28:42,317
It's time to end Team POSTECH.

1678
01:28:50,617 --> 01:28:52,244
HOST: TEAM KAIST, KIM JAE-HAN

1679
01:28:52,327 --> 01:28:53,995
I'll play against Hwang Seok-hun.

1680
01:28:54,079 --> 01:28:55,121
Oh, man.

1681
01:28:55,205 --> 01:28:56,206
- Take your time.
- Okay.

1682
01:28:56,289 --> 01:28:59,167
- Don't worry about getting it wrong.
- Okay.

1683
01:29:00,544 --> 01:29:04,965
Wow, so smart.
We saw him flounder with Pixel Art.

1684
01:29:05,048 --> 01:29:06,925
Jae-han is amazing.

1685
01:29:07,175 --> 01:29:10,095
If Seok-hun wins this round
and Jun-u wins most of Photo Memory,

1686
01:29:10,178 --> 01:29:12,556
we have a good chance of survival.

1687
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:15,559
Team POSTECH's Hwang Seok-hun,
please come to the stage.

1688
01:29:15,642 --> 01:29:17,477
Don't freeze up. Go get him.

1689
01:29:19,646 --> 01:29:23,149
<i>I realized that I could wrap things up</i>
<i>if I could beat two POSTECH contestants.</i>

1690
01:29:23,650 --> 01:29:25,277
<i>That didn't seem like a huge challenge,</i>

1691
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:28,196
<i>so I set my mind</i>
<i>on taking them down one by one.</i>

1692
01:29:28,822 --> 01:29:30,907
<i>- It's a rematch of their Deathmatch.</i>
<i>- That's true.</i>

1693
01:29:30,991 --> 01:29:31,825
REUNION AFTER DOUBLE-SIDED BINGO

1694
01:29:32,492 --> 01:29:36,246
Team KAIST's Kim Jae-han
got a bingo first.

1695
01:29:36,329 --> 01:29:38,790
KIM JAE-HAN DEFEATED HWANG SEOK-HUN

1696
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:41,668
<i>We need Seok-hun to win.</i>

1697
01:29:41,877 --> 01:29:44,421
I hope Seok-hun will surprise all of us.

1698
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:47,924
<i>I wanted to secure a win no matter what.</i>

1699
01:29:48,008 --> 01:29:49,509
Here is your question.

1700
01:29:49,885 --> 01:29:53,763
TARGET

1701
01:29:59,352 --> 01:30:01,521
Do your thing, Jae-han.
You were the best in this.

1702
01:30:01,605 --> 01:30:04,107
He beat all of us in practice runs.

1703
01:30:05,483 --> 01:30:07,611
Jeez, what a headache.

1704
01:30:09,154 --> 01:30:11,489
I'm completely lost this time.

1705
01:30:12,115 --> 01:30:14,242
It might be easier
to focus on primary colors.

1706
01:30:14,326 --> 01:30:15,785
It's the fastest to sort out the cards

1707
01:30:15,869 --> 01:30:19,331
based on the primary colors,
then the secondary colors on the sides.

1708
01:30:20,290 --> 01:30:21,374
That's a solid idea.

1709
01:30:27,547 --> 01:30:29,007
Team POSTECH's Hwang Seok-hun.

1710
01:30:29,090 --> 01:30:31,635
I'll go with Pixel Cards 3, 4, and 6.

1711
01:30:32,427 --> 01:30:34,095
Please be right.

1712
01:30:34,471 --> 01:30:36,514
He sounded so sure of his answer.

1713
01:30:39,351 --> 01:30:41,144
Team POSTECH's Hwang Seok-hun.

1714
01:30:43,146 --> 01:30:44,189
That is incorrect.

1715
01:30:44,272 --> 01:30:46,608
Your opponent will now get
the chance to answer.

1716
01:30:46,691 --> 01:30:48,318
That's a bummer.

1717
01:30:48,401 --> 01:30:50,570
This game is harder than it looks.

1718
01:30:50,654 --> 01:30:53,323
Plus, your mind goes blank
when you're out there.

1719
01:30:57,786 --> 01:30:59,037
Team KAIST's Kim Jae-han.

1720
01:30:59,204 --> 01:31:01,081
I'll go with Pixel Cards 2, 4, and 6.

1721
01:31:05,835 --> 01:31:08,088
Team KAIST's Kim Jae-han. That is correct.

1722
01:31:10,757 --> 01:31:12,092
PIXEL CARD 2: 180-DEGREE ROTATION

1723
01:31:12,175 --> 01:31:14,719
PIXEL CARD 4: 270-DEGREE ROTATION,
PIXEL CARD 6: 90-DEGREE ROTATION

1724
01:31:15,637 --> 01:31:17,973
PERFECT MATCH TO THE TARGET

1725
01:31:18,515 --> 01:31:19,641
I can't believe this.

1726
01:31:19,724 --> 01:31:21,810
- He's so good.
- He really is.

1727
01:31:21,893 --> 01:31:23,269
He's killing it.

1728
01:31:24,187 --> 01:31:25,647
- Jae-han won.
- He won again.

1729
01:31:25,730 --> 01:31:27,315
Team KAIST is likely to make it back.

1730
01:31:27,399 --> 01:31:28,817
We're so close, though.

1731
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:31,444
If only we could beat Team KAIST...

1732
01:31:31,528 --> 01:31:34,072
- But we only have Jun-u now.
- That's true.

1733
01:31:38,994 --> 01:31:40,328
Team POSTECH's Hwang Seok-hun.

1734
01:31:40,412 --> 01:31:43,748
You don't have any life left
and cannot compete anymore.

1735
01:31:43,832 --> 01:31:45,250
Please leave the main hall.

1736
01:31:45,875 --> 01:31:47,460
Wow, he's an absolute genius.

1737
01:31:47,544 --> 01:31:49,254
How many games has he won now?

1738
01:31:51,464 --> 01:31:54,718
KIM JAE-HAN HAS WON 3 CONSECUTIVE GAMES

1739
01:31:55,051 --> 01:31:56,845
CURRENT STANDINGS
YONSEI: 1, KAIST: 5, POSTECH: 3

1740
01:31:57,053 --> 01:31:59,472
This round can be
Team POSTECH's last one, right?

1741
01:31:59,556 --> 01:32:00,515
Yeah.

1742
01:32:00,598 --> 01:32:02,892
But if Jun-u wins three rounds,
he can turn the tables.

1743
01:32:02,976 --> 01:32:04,019
Jun-u is the calm type, so--

1744
01:32:04,102 --> 01:32:06,104
- But if he loses, we're done.
- Well, I suppose.

1745
01:32:06,187 --> 01:32:08,148
Then, we're really out of the game.

1746
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:11,026
TEAM POSTECH'S LAST SURVIVOR, LEE JUN-U

1747
01:32:11,109 --> 01:32:13,361
Please select the next game.

1748
01:32:13,987 --> 01:32:15,405
I'll go with Pixel Art.

1749
01:32:16,990 --> 01:32:19,909
Please choose your opponent.

1750
01:32:20,910 --> 01:32:24,039
Eliminate Jun-u, and we're done.
It's all over.

1751
01:32:24,581 --> 01:32:26,374
I'll play against Lee Jun-u.

1752
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:30,378
Team POSTECH's Lee Jun-u,
please come to the stage.

1753
01:32:32,422 --> 01:32:35,300
<i>I told myself if I took my time</i>
<i>and reviewed cards at my own pace,</i>

1754
01:32:35,383 --> 01:32:37,302
<i>then I'd be able to defeat Jae-han.</i>

1755
01:32:40,180 --> 01:32:42,849
You can do this, Jae-han.

1756
01:32:42,932 --> 01:32:44,309
You're that good.

1757
01:32:45,393 --> 01:32:48,229
Please come through for us, Jun-u.

1758
01:32:48,313 --> 01:32:50,106
Let us begin Pixel Art.

1759
01:32:50,190 --> 01:32:51,900
Here is your question.

1760
01:32:52,192 --> 01:32:55,111
TARGET

1761
01:33:02,118 --> 01:33:03,953
This is super challenging.

1762
01:33:04,037 --> 01:33:05,914
Dang, it's making me dizzy.

1763
01:33:08,708 --> 01:33:09,918
Team KAIST's Kim Jae-han.

1764
01:33:10,251 --> 01:33:11,711
Oh, what?

1765
01:33:11,795 --> 01:33:13,171
How is he pulling it off?

1766
01:33:13,254 --> 01:33:14,714
- He's so fast.
- Definitely.

1767
01:33:15,090 --> 01:33:17,008
I'll go with Pixel Cards 1, 3, and 9.

1768
01:33:18,510 --> 01:33:19,719
I can't bear to watch.

1769
01:33:21,471 --> 01:33:23,264
Oh, please...

1770
01:33:23,348 --> 01:33:24,724
Pretty please...

1771
01:33:24,808 --> 01:33:27,060
Team KAIST's Kim Jae-han. That is correct.

1772
01:33:28,853 --> 01:33:31,231
PIXEL CARD 1: 180-DEGREE ROTATION,
PIXEL CARDS 3 AND 9: 270-DEGREE ROTATION

1773
01:33:32,232 --> 01:33:33,983
PERFECT MATCH TO THE TARGET

1774
01:33:36,361 --> 01:33:42,075
<i>Even if Team Yonsei managed</i>
<i>to defeat the remaining Team KAIST,</i>

1775
01:33:42,158 --> 01:33:45,120
<i>their total score</i>
<i>would only amount to four points.</i>

1776
01:33:45,203 --> 01:33:49,499
<i>As such, we will apply the mercy rule</i>
<i>and end the game.</i>

1777
01:33:50,083 --> 01:33:52,168
- Oh, shoot.
- It's over.

1778
01:33:53,169 --> 01:33:54,295
How disappointing.

1779
01:33:54,379 --> 01:33:56,881
If only I had gotten
that Time Jump question right.

1780
01:33:56,965 --> 01:33:58,091
I'm sorry.

1781
01:33:58,925 --> 01:34:00,927
I shouldn't have chosen Jae-han.

1782
01:34:01,928 --> 01:34:03,638
Oh, Team KAIST's back in the game.

1783
01:34:03,847 --> 01:34:04,889
Damn it.

1784
01:34:05,557 --> 01:34:07,934
We went full savage
to get them eliminated, but...

1785
01:34:09,435 --> 01:34:11,563
Thank you for the good game.

1786
01:34:13,565 --> 01:34:16,860
- He beat four people all by himself.
- He's amazing.

1787
01:34:16,943 --> 01:34:19,195
How is this real?

1788
01:34:19,696 --> 01:34:23,783
KIM JAE-HAN ELIMINATED
ALL 4 CONTESTANTS OF TEAM POSTECH

1789
01:34:23,867 --> 01:34:26,286
That was a major boost to my confidence.

1790
01:34:26,578 --> 01:34:29,330
I thought I could contribute more

1791
01:34:29,414 --> 01:34:32,625
if I took on a more active role
in the upcoming games.

1792
01:34:32,709 --> 01:34:35,879
<i>I'll take this</i>
<i>as a fresh shot at Elite League</i>

1793
01:34:35,962 --> 01:34:37,338
<i>and do my absolute best.</i>

1794
01:34:44,137 --> 01:34:47,015
<i>I felt disappointed in myself.</i>

1795
01:34:47,348 --> 01:34:49,434
<i>If only I had hit the buzzer</i>
<i>faster than Seung-gyu,</i>

1796
01:34:49,517 --> 01:34:51,895
<i>I could've stayed on as the host.</i>

1797
01:34:51,978 --> 01:34:54,564
<i>Looking back,</i>
<i>I realize I might have been too impatient.</i>

1798
01:34:54,647 --> 01:34:56,941
<i>I felt bad for my teammates, too.</i>

1799
01:34:57,025 --> 01:34:59,319
Then again,
every good redemption round is brutal.

1800
01:34:59,402 --> 01:35:02,488
The winner gets a new shot.
We need some cruelty.

1801
01:35:02,780 --> 01:35:04,032
It was a fair game.

1802
01:35:04,115 --> 01:35:06,034
All teams were given the Priority card.

1803
01:35:06,117 --> 01:35:08,995
Team Yonsei should've saved it

1804
01:35:09,537 --> 01:35:11,998
so they could use it
when they knew they wouldn't lose.

1805
01:35:12,081 --> 01:35:13,291
- They used it too early.
- Right.

1806
01:35:13,374 --> 01:35:14,792
Now that it's come to this,

1807
01:35:14,876 --> 01:35:17,837
you could say Team KAIST proved
that they're better than these two.

1808
01:35:17,921 --> 01:35:21,090
Team KAIST went through two Deathmatches
and the redemption round.

1809
01:35:21,174 --> 01:35:22,550
<i>They really made it back from hell.</i>

1810
01:35:22,634 --> 01:35:25,303
<i>That makes them more formidable</i>
<i>than Team KAIST of Season 2.</i>

1811
01:35:30,683 --> 01:35:33,019
This was an opportunity
none of us expected.

1812
01:35:33,102 --> 01:35:36,522
We never imagined
that we could return to this hall again.

1813
01:35:36,981 --> 01:35:38,608
I wanted to try Photo Memory, though.

1814
01:35:38,691 --> 01:35:41,069
Same here.
It's a shame we never got to compete.

1815
01:35:43,738 --> 01:35:48,326
<i>That concludes the redemption round,</i>
<i>Relay Match.</i>

1816
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:50,995
<i>Now, the final results.</i>

1817
01:35:51,079 --> 01:35:56,584
<i>As Team KAIST obtained the most points,</i>
<i>Team KAIST won the match.</i>

1818
01:35:59,837 --> 01:36:03,591
<i>As the winner of the redemption round,</i>
<i>Team KAIST secured a second chance.</i>

1819
01:36:03,675 --> 01:36:07,804
<i>They can rejoin the surviving teams</i>
<i>and compete in Elite League Season 3.</i>

1820
01:36:08,721 --> 01:36:10,598
Thank you.

1821
01:36:11,349 --> 01:36:15,270
<i>Team Yonsei and Team POSTECH,</i>
<i>you failed to secure a second chance.</i>

1822
01:36:15,353 --> 01:36:17,063
<i>Please exit the grounds.</i>

1823
01:36:21,317 --> 01:36:22,652
Good luck, guys.

1824
01:36:30,118 --> 01:36:30,952
Good job.

1825
01:36:31,244 --> 01:36:32,787
We're hard to get rid of.

1826
01:36:32,870 --> 01:36:34,372
We keep coming back.

1827
01:36:35,206 --> 01:36:36,499
<i>We went through two Deathmatches</i>

1828
01:36:36,582 --> 01:36:39,210
<i>and barely managed</i>
<i>to win the redemption round.</i>

1829
01:36:39,377 --> 01:36:42,588
<i>Now that we're back,</i>
<i>we really should aim for the trophy.</i>

1830
01:36:51,931 --> 01:36:55,226
<i>Today's main match is Dilemma of the Mean.</i>

1831
01:36:55,310 --> 01:36:56,144
What?

1832
01:36:56,352 --> 01:36:57,186
Dilemma?

1833
01:36:57,270 --> 01:36:58,813
- Sounds like a mind game.
- It's a mind game.

1834
01:37:00,523 --> 01:37:03,609
<i>Let's make ourselves untouchable</i>
<i>and let the rest fight it out.</i>

1835
01:37:03,693 --> 01:37:04,986
<i>I do feel nervous.</i>

1836
01:37:05,069 --> 01:37:07,196
<i>Team KAIST made it back from hell twice.</i>

1837
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:08,364
<i>Is it a revenge match?</i>

1838
01:37:08,448 --> 01:37:10,658
Like, "We're back from the dead"?

1839
01:37:10,742 --> 01:37:13,911
We should've tried to get
in Team KAIST's good books.

1840
01:37:13,995 --> 01:37:17,081
There's no way
we can take Team KAIST down now.

1841
01:37:17,165 --> 01:37:18,958
<i>We should smash Team SNU in Medicine.</i>

1842
01:37:19,042 --> 01:37:20,460
We've got to be bold.

1843
01:37:20,543 --> 01:37:22,045
Hey, they're out to get us.

1844
01:37:22,128 --> 01:37:23,588
Everyone is targeting us.

1845
01:37:23,671 --> 01:37:26,257
This is a major make-or-break move.

1846
01:37:26,341 --> 01:37:28,051
What do we do now? We're in big trouble.

1847
01:37:28,134 --> 01:37:29,093
Yeah, really.

1848
01:37:29,177 --> 01:37:30,887
You could say Team SNU wasted their lives.

1849
01:37:30,970 --> 01:37:32,597
We're seeing the infighting of Team SNUs.

1850
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:33,848
Let's not get involved.

1851
01:37:33,931 --> 01:37:36,392
- It's better for us.
- Team SNU is practically repaying us.

1852
01:37:36,976 --> 01:37:38,895
We must take a gamble to win.

1853
01:37:39,479 --> 01:37:42,065
Seriously though,
that's absolutely insane.

1854
01:38:24,190 --> 01:38:26,192
