1
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,612
DAY 5
SEMIFINAL

2
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,658
We should put our phones away
for another successful day.

3
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:35,244
For another day of learning.

4
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:36,203
Locked.

5
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,746
See you later.

6
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:39,998
I'm so happy I can tease you again.

7
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,042
Jeez.

8
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,877
Seriously though, Ji-u.

9
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:46,880
- You get a new look every day.
- Fine, give it to me.

10
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:48,590
- Let's hear it.
- Go on.

11
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:51,927
You looked just like CHUU two days ago.

12
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,096
- But today...
- Today...

13
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,223
You look like Lara Croft.

14
00:00:58,225 --> 00:00:59,518
Because of her braids?

15
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,603
- Isn't he the worst?
- I feel you.

16
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:03,772
Come on, I only brought up pretty people.

17
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:06,525
I'd say I'm seeing a downward trend.

18
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,694
I'd love to make fun of you tomorrow, too.

19
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:09,945
Let's make it through

20
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,156
so I can tease you again
about your new look.

21
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,616
Let's survive another day.

22
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,077
Wow, we're down to three teams.

23
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,413
Most of the Physics Olympiad
medalists have left.

24
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,290
Like Jong-yun and Sang-yeon.

25
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:22,416
<i>You're right.</i>

26
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,126
LEE SEUNG-HYEON
SOLE SURVIVOR AMONG THE OLYMPIANS

27
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,003
THE LAST REMAINING PHYSICS GOLD MEDALIST

28
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,880
IS MAKING AN ORIGAMI CRANE

29
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:32,050
I've never made an origami crane before.

30
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:35,137
Back in the day,
I challenged myself to make 1,000 cranes.

31
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,055
But I gave up after about 100 cranes.

32
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:39,349
And who were the cranes for?

33
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,351
THROWN OFF

34
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,312
- I bought ready-made ones.
- What?

35
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,231
- That defeats the purpose.
- Who were they for?

36
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:48,066
I just gifted the ones I bought.

37
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,986
You really are an extraordinary guy.

38
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,572
Half of the teams are gone.

39
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,824
Number one in STEM colleges.

40
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:58,577
- The best in STEM, KAIST.
- The ultimate STEM school.

41
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,120
Hey, that's pretty awesome.

42
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,581
We proved that we're the best in STEM.

43
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:05,626
But our ultimate goal
is to defeat the med school teams.

44
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:06,752
- You bet.
- It is what it is.

45
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:09,755
We only had to land in the top 2
among 4 teams yesterday,

46
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,673
so we needed a safe approach.

47
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:14,384
But we have to win today
to avoid the Deathmatch.

48
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,595
Because only the winner
escapes the Deathmatch?

49
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,639
Let's place first just like yesterday.

50
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:19,640
All right.

51
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:25,395
<i>All contestants, please gather</i>
<i>at the main hall for the semifinal.</i>

52
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,064
Wow, the semifinal.

53
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,440
Intimidating, right?

54
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,484
Oh, man. We made it to the semifinal.

55
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,235
- The semifinal?
- It's not a main match.

56
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:36,281
As the last remaining STEM team,
we're the pride of the STEM students.

57
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:38,700
- KAIST!
- Let's go!

58
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:41,536
Do we go with "SNU"
or "SNU in Medicine" in our chant?

59
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,205
- We're the only Team SNU left.
- Right.

60
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,374
- Let's go, SNU!
- Let's go, SNU!

61
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:47,668
<i>- Kingo, Kingo, Escara, Kingo</i>
<i>- Kingo, Kingo, Escara, Kingo</i>

62
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:50,128
<i>- Hula, Hula, SKK!</i>
<i>- Hula, Hula, SKK!</i>

63
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:55,842
I can't help smiling.

64
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:59,554
- So full of confidence?
- I'm looking forward to a great game.

65
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:00,931
Ji-hu looks excited.

66
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,392
Ji-hu seems to be in a good mood.

67
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:05,477
But I'm in a better mood.

68
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:11,525
<i>Brainpower survival challenge,</i>
<i>Elite League Season 3.</i>

69
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,318
<i>The surviving teams are as follows.</i>

70
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:15,404
<i>Team SNU in Medicine,</i>

71
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:16,988
<i>Team SKKU...</i>

72
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:18,073
Correct.

73
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,283
<i>...and Team KAIST.</i>

74
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:22,285
Let's keep it relaxed.

75
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:25,539
<i>We will have one main match</i>
<i>for the semifinal.</i>

76
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,374
<i>The team in first place</i>
<i>advances to the finals...</i>

77
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:32,003
<i>while the bottom two teams</i>
<i>compete in the Deathmatch.</i>

78
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:35,382
<i>Only the winner can advance to the finals.</i>

79
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:37,718
Let's place first.

80
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,346
<i>Which two teams will be the finalists?</i>

81
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:46,309
<i>The semifinal of Elite League Season 3</i>

82
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:49,104
<i>begins now.</i>

83
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:52,065
<i>The main match for the semifinal is...</i>

84
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,401
- I wonder what it is.
- What's it to be?

85
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,945
<i>...Secret Student Club.</i>

86
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,239
- What?
- What are we to make of that?

87
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,615
- What?
- A reasoning game?

88
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:02,659
The name alone doesn't give us much.

89
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:05,454
- What's this about?
- At least it's not a calculation game.

90
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:07,956
I can't even make a guess.

91
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,249
- What?
- Student Club?

92
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,251
- What is this?
- What does it involve?

93
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:13,837
This game is the biggest enigma.

94
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,131
Similar to Find My Personality Type
from Season 1?

95
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,258
- Maybe.
- Let's see.

96
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,594
<i>In Secret Student Club,</i>

97
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:24,306
<i>your task is to deduce</i>
<i>each contestant's club and their rank.</i>

98
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,143
<i>You can win points</i>
<i>with each successful identification.</i>

99
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:30,020
We guessed right.

100
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:31,563
<i>All contestants</i>

101
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:37,778
<i>are members of the band,</i>
<i>the dance club, or the drama club.</i>

102
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:43,867
<i>Each club has 1 president,</i>
<i>1 secretary, and 2 members.</i>

103
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:47,788
<i>When the game begins,</i>
<i>you will be given no information</i>

104
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:50,332
<i>on your club or your rank.</i>

105
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,626
Even I'm in the dark?

106
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,044
We don't know our own info.

107
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,004
<i>The only information we will share now</i>

108
00:04:56,213 --> 00:05:02,219
<i>is that each team has 1 president,</i>
<i>1 secretary, and 2 members</i>

109
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,597
<i>and that each team</i>
<i>has at least one member of each club.</i>

110
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:09,392
<i>There are three stages in the game.</i>

111
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,812
<i>The first stage is the meeting.</i>

112
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:14,272
<i>There will be three meetings</i>
<i>in each round.</i>

113
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:19,152
<i>Each team can send</i>
<i>up to two members to a meeting.</i>

114
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,240
<i>Alternatively,</i>
<i>you may choose not to send anyone.</i>

115
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,952
<i>In the first and third meetings,</i>

116
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:30,455
<i>the attendees will be told</i>
<i>which club has the most members attending</i>

117
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:31,790
<i>and how many there are.</i>

118
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:33,834
<i>In the second meeting,</i>

119
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:37,212
<i>they will be told</i>
<i>which rank has the most members attending</i>

120
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,922
<i>and how many there are.</i>

121
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:43,760
<i>Please remember that the information</i>
<i>will only be shared with the attendees.</i>

122
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:46,930
You have to attend to stay informed.

123
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:48,932
Guess we'll have to attend, then.

124
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,268
<i>The second stage is the investigation.</i>

125
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,855
<i>You will enter the Dealer Room alone,</i>
<i>select one contestant,</i>

126
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:57,691
<i>and inquire if they are</i>
<i>in the same club as yours,</i>

127
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:01,486
<i>or of the same rank as yours.</i>

128
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,905
<i>The third stage is the identity deduction.</i>

129
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:07,826
<i>In this phase, you will submit an answer</i>
<i>based on the information you gathered.</i>

130
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,703
<i>You can win points</i>

131
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:14,332
<i>by correctly identifying</i>
<i>a contestant's club and their rank.</i>

132
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:18,753
<i>A correct identity deduction</i>
<i>takes away one life of that contestant.</i>

133
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,964
<i>The number of lives assigned to you</i>

134
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:24,175
PRESIDENT: 4, SECRETARY: 2, MEMBER: 1
<i>varies by your rank.</i>

135
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,636
<i>Once you run out of lives,</i>

136
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,055
<i>you cannot participate</i>
<i>in meetings or investigations.</i>

137
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:32,934
<i>Therefore, you cannot collect information.</i>

138
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:37,772
<i>Each team can perform</i>
<i>three identity deductions per round.</i>

139
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:41,651
<i>You may carry out multiple deductions</i>
<i>on the same person.</i>

140
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:45,447
<i>Please refer to the screen</i>
<i>for the timeline of the game.</i>

141
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,658
ROUNDS 1, 2, AND 3:
MEETINGS AND INVESTIGATIONS

142
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,368
ROUNDS 2, 3, 4, AND 5:
IDENTITY DEDUCTIONS

143
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:53,580
<i>All teams,</i>
<i>please start discussing your strategies.</i>

144
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:57,000
I feel like we could beat them all.

145
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:01,171
About the initial investigations.
We get four attempts, right?

146
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:04,257
It might help to use
those four shots on us.

147
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,343
On us?

148
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,429
Let's say I asked if one of you
was of the same rank as mine.

149
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,431
If I get a yes,
the other two will be club officers.

150
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,100
You're right.

151
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,561
<i>Suppose A asked</i>
<i>if B's rank matched theirs,</i>

152
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:18,438
<i>and the answer was affirmative.</i>

153
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,273
<i>- A and B are just members.</i>
<i>- Right.</i>

154
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,233
1 PRESIDENT, 1 SECRETARY,
AND 2 MEMBERS IN A TEAM

155
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:27,530
If we're lucky, the first three questions
can confirm the ranks of all of us.

156
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:32,243
I'd like us to use the first four queries
to ask about each other's rank.

157
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:33,828
If someone gets a yes,

158
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:36,790
- we can confirm those two people's ranks.
- Right.

159
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,000
So that's the go-to strategy for Round 1.

160
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:43,129
We have no initial information,
so it's a very promising plan.

161
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,633
Okay, about the first meeting of Round 1.

162
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,134
Do we send two people?

163
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:51,012
What if there are ties?

164
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:53,932
IF 2 CLUBS OR 2 RANKS HAVE AN EQUAL NUMBER
OF ATTENDEES, BOTH WILL BE SHARED

165
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,309
- A tie can be very significant.
- I agree.

166
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:59,396
Let's think about the combinations
for four attendees.

167
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,732
<i>Suppose we get 2 clubs for 4 attendees.</i>

168
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:05,568
<i>Then, two people belong to each club.</i>

169
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,404
<i>If 3 out of 6 people are in Club A,</i>

170
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,031
<i>the other two are in Club B,</i>
<i>and the last person is in Club C.</i>

171
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:11,116
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- Right.</i>

172
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:16,246
Just as we discussed,
each meeting will be a treasure trove.

173
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,957
- I think all meetings will be fruitful.
- Agreed.

174
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,877
I don't think it will hurt
to send out people.

175
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:25,463
Do you want to adjust numbers
based on the turnout?

176
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:27,966
Yes, that's what I'm pitching.

177
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,426
Then how many...

178
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:33,096
I realized that our own gameplay

179
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:37,726
would be heavily influenced
by other teams' actions.

180
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:40,812
We have to know about our own info
as much as possible.

181
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,231
And how much of our identity is revealed.

182
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,525
We should monitor
the other teams' deductions

183
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:48,361
and work backward from those
to identify them.

184
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:52,323
Let's dissect each and every new input
to reduce the effect of dumb luck.

185
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:55,952
We must stay on top of everything.
Only then can we have an edge.

186
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,163
We must place first today, after all.

187
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,081
Our actions can be limited by others.

188
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:02,375
Suppose the first team
doesn't send anyone to a meeting.

189
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,335
If we're called next,
we have to send our people.

190
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:09,424
Otherwise, the third team can send someone
and figure out their own club or rank.

191
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:12,218
Anyhow, we should never let
one team hog a meeting.

192
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:13,511
Agreed.

193
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,139
I'll make a table for all possible cases.

194
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,390
Okay.

195
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,976
When we strike out
the impossible cases later,

196
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,561
- only a handful will remain.
- Of course.

197
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,897
I like the idea of striking cases out.

198
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,149
KANG JI-HU DRAWS UP A TABLE
FOR A QUICK ANALYSIS

199
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:29,027
- You can log the results, Tae-hun.
- I'll keep each meeting result

200
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,111
on a separate page.

201
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:31,946
I'll handle the analysis.

202
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,616
- I've got this.
- I'll handle the analysis

203
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,367
- and write a report of our findings.
- Okay.

204
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:39,454
We're strongest when we work together.

205
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:44,542
- Exactly.
- I'm sure we'll crush this.

206
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:48,421
<i>You have three minutes left.</i>

207
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:51,966
We didn't go over the special items.

208
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,594
The Extra Deduction card
and the Dismiss Deductions card.

209
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:58,807
<i>In Secret Student Club,</i>
<i>there are two special items.</i>

210
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,601
<i>The first item</i>
<i>is the Extra Deduction card.</i>

211
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:05,021
<i>If you use this card,</i>
<i>you can conduct one more deduction.</i>

212
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:09,109
<i>The second item</i>
<i>is the Dismiss Deductions card.</i>

213
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,986
<i>When applied to one certain teammate,</i>

214
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:15,657
<i>this item can negate all deductions</i>
<i>made against them in that round.</i>

215
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:19,619
<i>Those who attack that person</i>
<i>with a successful deduction</i>

216
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:23,373
<i>will not be awarded a point.</i>

217
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:26,626
The Dismiss Deductions card can cause
a huge damage when used timely.

218
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:27,669
You feel me, right?

219
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,671
Oh, of course.

220
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,756
It would prevent
the other teams from scoring.

221
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,882
Exactly.

222
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:36,094
The most you can get
from the Extra Deduction card

223
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,637
- is one point.
- Yeah.

224
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,973
- Only when used correctly.
- Exactly.

225
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:43,560
But with the Dismiss Deductions card,
we can cost the others three points.

226
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,727
That's so true.

227
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:48,064
<i>The time for strategy meeting is up.</i>

228
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:53,111
<i>We will now begin the main match,</i>
<i>Secret Student Club.</i>

229
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,612
<i>Please roll a die.</i>

230
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:58,741
<i>The team with the largest number</i>
<i>will decide their order first.</i>

231
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,827
Who has the best luck today?

232
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,247
I looked up a fortune-telling website,
and it said today's my day.

233
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:07,917
It's your day, Jae-han.

234
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,802
Today really is your day, Jae-han.

235
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,095
We have six.

236
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,848
We'll go with B.

237
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,184
B means going second.

238
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,227
We'll go first.

239
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:27,937
We'll take the first turn.

240
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:32,192
<i>That leaves</i>
<i>Team SNU in Medicine to go last.</i>

241
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,486
<i>Let us begin Round 1</i>
<i>of Secret Student Club.</i>

242
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,655
<i>We will have the first meeting shortly.</i>

243
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:41,784
<i>All attendees,</i>
<i>please come to the main hall.</i>

244
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,870
<i>You will be given one minute.</i>

245
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,581
<i>First, Team SKKU.</i>

246
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:53,338
<i>Team SKKU has one attendee, Sung Tae-hun.</i>

247
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,757
TEAM SKKU'S SUNG TAE-HUN JOINS THE MEETING

248
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,926
Just one person.

249
00:11:58,009 --> 00:11:59,510
We can send one as well.

250
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:03,640
Is that wise? I think we should send two
especially in earlier meetings.

251
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,892
But suppose Team KAIST sends one.

252
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,770
- We'd be at a disadvantage.
- If they send one, we should match them.

253
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,104
Right.

254
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,523
<i>Second, Team KAIST.</i>

255
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:16,194
They could send no one.
Wait, they get no information, then.

256
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,738
I don't think
they'll have that as an option.

257
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,991
<i>You have ten seconds left.</i>

258
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,996
<i>Your time is up.</i>

259
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:31,376
<i>Team KAIST has no attendees.</i>

260
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,127
- Hear that?
- They sent no one.

261
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:35,964
Why not, though?

262
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:38,758
- Why give up on the info?
- They would miss it.

263
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:39,759
It makes no sense.

264
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,679
There is no reason
to miss the first meeting.

265
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,347
No one is attending.

266
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,890
We're not sending anyone.

267
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:46,933
TEAM KAIST TOOK A PASS

268
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,310
- We're going to target a single team.
- Right.

269
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:52,105
The others will have
the same game plan as us.

270
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:55,942
So it'd be vital to pit the medical teams
against each other early on.

271
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,193
Yeah, that's valid.

272
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,070
Why don't we skip the meetings?

273
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,905
I mean the first few ones.

274
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,115
- All together?
- Yeah.

275
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,700
- We're sending no one?
- Yes.

276
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,451
We won't get the info, then.

277
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:07,662
The info won't tell us much anyway.

278
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,706
I'd rather we stayed alive
for more investigations.

279
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,792
I think we should give up
on the first few meetings.

280
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:16,337
Then, the medical teams
will investigate each other,

281
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,464
using what little knowledge they have.

282
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,800
Once that's done, there's no going back.

283
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,553
They have to keep targeting each other.

284
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,638
It's crucial to get them engaged.

285
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:27,557
You want them to fight each other, right?

286
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,267
That's more important than the info.

287
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,853
The game was designed
to have us fight one another.

288
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,731
So I thought we could take first place

289
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,442
<i>by pitting the other teams</i>
<i>against each other.</i>

290
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,111
One option is to attend
the meetings in Rounds 1 and 2.

291
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:43,489
Next is to attend only the ones in Round 2
armed with info from the investigations.

292
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:47,452
The difference in our intel is small,
but the others would learn much about us.

293
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:53,124
<i>Team SKKU has one attendee, Sung Tae-hun.</i>

294
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,169
I'd say Tae-hun is done for. Great.

295
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,254
Everything is falling into place.

296
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,340
All right, things are working out.

297
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:03,801
- We have to send people.
- Okay, let's send one person.

298
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:04,761
- Just one?
- One?

299
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,263
It's better to have the attendees
exchange information.

300
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:16,272
<i>Team SNU in Medicine</i>
<i>has one attendee, Kim Min-seok.</i>

301
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,737
We'll learn a lot, then.

302
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:27,533
The problem is that Min-seok
will get the same information.

303
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:30,995
<i>The first meeting of Round 1</i>
<i>will now begin.</i>

304
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,833
Gosh, thank you.

305
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:42,131
Let's leave a note about our visit.
It's the Club Room, after all.

306
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,635
KIM MIN-SEOK...

307
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:46,719
Nice handwriting.

308
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:49,555
<i>The result will now be announced.</i>

309
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,268
MEETING RESULT

310
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:58,356
DRAMA CLUB: 1, DANCE CLUB: 1

311
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,941
I bet you're a good dancer.

312
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,235
I've seen you dance, you know.

313
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,487
- See you later.
- Sure.

314
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:09,409
DRAMA CLUB: 1, DANCE CLUB: 1
KIM MIN-SEOK, SUNG TAE-HUN

315
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,662
One in drama club, one in dance club.

316
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,497
One member each?

317
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,582
So you're in either one of those.

318
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,668
- Team KAIST's scheme cost them big time.
- I know.

319
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:19,585
What did you learn?

320
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,546
- One in drama club, one in dance club.
- One each?

321
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,965
- Come again?
- Drama, one. Dance, one.

322
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,550
One each. Got it.

323
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:28,219
Lunge at each other, guys. Come on.

324
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,930
<i>We will have the second meeting shortly.</i>

325
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:33,558
<i>First, Team KAIST.</i>

326
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,643
I hope they stay back again.

327
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:38,146
- No, we should be worried, then.
- What for?

328
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:41,190
- They must have a solid strategy
- For some plot?

329
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:42,900
for some secret plot.

330
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:45,611
<i>First, Team KAIST.</i>

331
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:51,200
<i>Team KAIST has no attendees.</i>

332
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,871
Again?

333
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,706
What happens if we send one person?

334
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,250
Team SKKU would reciprocate.

335
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,710
With one person, right?

336
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,795
Then we get a game of chance.

337
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:06,507
<i>Team SNU in Medicine</i>
<i>has one attendee, Lee Seung-hyeon.</i>

338
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:10,720
<i>Team SKKU has one attendee, Kim Dong-yeon.</i>

339
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:15,641
- Let's pray we get two members.
- I agree.

340
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,894
That would stop us
from gunning each other down.

341
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,147
If we get two non-officers,
do we kill off Dong-yeon?

342
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,150
I doubt they would use
the Dismiss Deductions card

343
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,401
just to save a club member

344
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:29,197
since we can use the item only once
throughout the whole game.

345
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,240
<i>The result will now be announced.</i>

346
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,204
2 MEMBERS

347
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:39,832
LEE SEUNG-HYEON AND KIM DONG-YEON
ARE BOTH MEMBERS

348
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,630
- What did you get?
- Two members.

349
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,215
Two members?

350
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:48,883
- I got two members.
- Great.

351
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,760
I knew it.

352
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,095
That confirms my rank, right?

353
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,056
We may have to revise our plan.

354
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,725
First, Team SNU may make
their three deductions on you,

355
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:00,811
each with a different club,
just to kill you off.

356
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:03,147
We should consider
doing that to Seung-hyeon, too.

357
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,732
Yes, you're right about that.

358
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:08,861
Now that it's come to this,
this round may be it for Dong-yeon.

359
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:11,489
They should be busy
looking into each other by now.

360
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,534
<i>We will have the third meeting</i>
<i>of Round 1 shortly.</i>

361
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,912
Don't attend a meeting
since your club may be revealed.

362
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,622
Of course not.

363
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:20,706
That's a given.

364
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,668
We will be called first this time.
Who are we sending?

365
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,753
If we send Min-seok again,

366
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:29,048
can't we learn something
without giving information to others?

367
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:32,593
But Team SKKU may be able
to deduce his club by elimination.

368
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:35,179
Oh, if it's another one-on-one situation

369
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:37,890
and the drama club isn't mentioned,
they'd know he's in the dance club.

370
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:40,434
- Min-seok should stay back, then.
- I agree.

371
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:42,270
I think it should be me or Min-seo.

372
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:45,898
The question is whether both of us
should attend or just one of us.

373
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,568
- It's a 50-50 chance anyway.
- Right, let's go.

374
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:54,115
<i>Team SNU in Medicine has two attendees,</i>
<i>Han Seo-yeon and Joo Min-seo.</i>

375
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,908
They sent two people.

376
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,618
Do we lose out if we matched them?

377
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:59,745
We won't suffer any losses.

378
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,706
- Let's send two.
- That's the right choice.

379
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:08,879
<i>Team SKKU has two attendees,</i>
<i>Lee Dong-jae and Kang Ji-hu.</i>

380
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,049
- Team SKKU also sent two.
- I see.

381
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:15,052
Does that put us at a huge disadvantage?

382
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:16,262
- Not at all.
- Really?

383
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,805
We won't lose anyone.

384
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,515
In terms of intel, we're behind.

385
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:20,850
But we won't lose anyone.

386
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,060
Our goal is to place first.

387
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:26,606
Let's wait for the bodies to pile up
before we pounce.

388
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:30,610
<i>Team KAIST has no attendees.</i>

389
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:33,821
What are they doing?
They're not participating at all.

390
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,990
I get it now.

391
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,034
They're trying to avoid
losing anyone in Round 1.

392
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:41,245
They won't gain any intel,
but they will keep everyone alive.

393
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,956
We can't deduce their identity
without any intel on them.

394
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,542
They want to prevent us
from attacking them.

395
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:49,420
Maybe Team KAIST wants
Team SKKU and us to take each other down.

396
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:52,506
But what good does that do them?
They lose the opportunities to score.

397
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:53,758
Beats me.

398
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,844
<i>Please go to the Club Room.</i>

399
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:01,182
The whole setup makes me feel
like I'm on campus.

400
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,558
- Totally.
- It's nice to see you.

401
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,185
- Hello.
- We can continue inside.

402
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,354
- All right.
- Like a proper club meeting?

403
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:09,023
- Hello, everyone.
- Hello.

404
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,107
It's a pleasure.

405
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:15,571
- I want to leave a note, too.
- We have a visitors' log.

406
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:18,866
SNU-AND-SKKU...

407
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:22,370
I'll add "inter-university student club."

408
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,749
- Are we ditching Team KAIST entirely?
- That's it.

409
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,545
- They won't join us.
- "Team KAIST has no attendees."

410
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:33,547
WHEN ARE YOU JOINING US...

411
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:35,591
That's a good question.
When are they joining us?

412
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:38,469
- Seriously, when?
- Why won't they join us?

413
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:39,887
WHEN ARE YOU JOINING US, TEAM KAIST?

414
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,014
<i>The result will now be announced.</i>

415
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:43,641
MEETING RESULT

416
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,518
DRAMA CLUB: 2, DANCE CLUB: 2

417
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:46,602
Not bad.

418
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:49,980
You're both actually
in a dance club, right?

419
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:50,981
- Gosh.
- Good to know.

420
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:52,650
Did the creators take that into account?

421
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:54,151
Hey, that's right.

422
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:55,277
Hang on.

423
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,530
- I think we hit the jackpot.
- Really?

424
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,366
We learned a lot about each other. Look.

425
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,492
Two in drama, two in dance.

426
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,703
So far, we have three members
in both clubs.

427
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:07,957
That means Team KAIST
has two members of the band.

428
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,417
That checks out.

429
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,001
Two in drama, two in dance?

430
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:12,211
You must be in the band.

431
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,422
Both you and Dong-yeon
must be in the band.

432
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:17,091
I know. You had two members
of the drama club and the dance club?

433
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,384
- What?
- I know, right?

434
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:21,554
<i>The first and the third meetings confirmed</i>

435
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:25,015
<i>that the total of six people</i>
<i>from Team SNU in Medicine and Team SKKU</i>

436
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:28,185
<i>are either in the drama club</i>
<i>or the dance club.</i>

437
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:32,273
<i>As all teams must have members</i>
<i>from all three clubs,</i>

438
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:36,819
<i>the remaining two contestants</i>
<i>have to be members of the band.</i>

439
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:40,322
<i>That leaves the vacant four slots</i>

440
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,825
<i>for the members of Team KAIST.</i>

441
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:44,702
Dong-yeon and I are non-officers.

442
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:49,081
The band members in Team KAIST
must be the president and the secretary.

443
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:51,375
- That's for sure. Here's what we'll do.
- Poor Team KAIST.

444
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:54,170
Let's figure out their non-officer members

445
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:58,090
and then the officers
before we dive into Team SKKU.

446
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:01,719
- We need to take them out first.
- Agreed.

447
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:05,514
We stand to gain
whoever we can identify out of Team KAIST,

448
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:08,350
- so you should investigate one of them.
- Right.

449
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:11,479
TEAM KAIST BECOMES THE TARGET
<i>We need to take a swing at them.</i>

450
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,565
<i>We will now begin</i>
<i>the investigation phase of Round 1.</i>

451
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:19,945
<i>You may go to the Dealer Room one by one</i>
<i>to conduct an investigation.</i>

452
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:24,575
TEAM KAIST RUSHES OUT
THE MOMENT THE ANNOUNCEMENT IS MADE

453
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:31,999
Do I have the same rank
as Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min?

454
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:35,211
No, you don't.

455
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,587
Thank you. Understood.

456
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:40,424
- So?
- He said no.

457
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:42,468
- He said no?
- Yeah.

458
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:46,096
Do I have the same rank
as Team KAIST's Kang Ji-hoo?

459
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:49,058
No, you don't.

460
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,519
SAME RANK AS TEAM KAIST'S KIM JI-U?
No, you don't.

461
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:55,856
<i>The three investigations confirmed</i>
<i>that these three have different ranks.</i>

462
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:59,443
<i>As such, among the trio are the president,</i>
<i>the secretary, and one of the members.</i>

463
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:04,114
<i>That leaves the remaining member</i>
<i>as Kim Jae-han.</i>

464
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,576
We didn't have much luck there.

465
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,161
Go take your shot, Jae-han.

466
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:11,121
TRYING TO FIND ANOTHER MEMBER

467
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,917
I'd like to ask about Lee Seung-hyeon.

468
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,253
Do we have the same rank?

469
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:19,380
Yes, you do.

470
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:23,300
- It's Jae-han's lucky day.
- Yeah.

471
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:24,635
FOUND ANOTHER MEMBER AT 1ST TRY

472
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,929
Shall I go ask a question?

473
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:27,972
I'll give it a go.

474
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:30,266
- To see if you're a member?
- Yes.

475
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,268
Ask to compare your rank with mine.

476
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,521
Please compare our ranks.

477
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,439
SAME RANK AS TEAM SNU'S LEE SEUNG-HYEON?

478
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:38,816
You have different ranks.

479
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,570
SAME RANK AS TEAM SNU'S LEE SEUNG-HYEON?
You have the same rank.

480
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,030
- I'm the other member.
- I see.

481
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:46,073
Goodness.

482
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,200
Are we in the same club?

483
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,537
SAME CLUB AS TEAM SNU'S HAN SEO-YEON?
Yes, you are.

484
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,830
Are we in the same club?

485
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,707
SAME CLUB AS TEAM SKKU'S KANG JI-HU?

486
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,916
Yes, you are.

487
00:22:57,418 --> 00:22:59,211
- So?
- We're in the same club.

488
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,548
Let's think about what to do next.

489
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,550
<i>You have three minutes left.</i>

490
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,051
We're in the same club.

491
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:07,511
- Really?
- Isn't it for the better?

492
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:10,639
- It's better, right?
- Much better.

493
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:12,683
<i>This is great.</i>

494
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,101
CLUB A: DONG-JAE, JI-HU
CLUB B: SEO-YEON, TAE-HUN

495
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:17,104
<i>We will have the first meeting</i>
<i>of Round 2 shortly.</i>

496
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,148
Are we attending no matter what?

497
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,274
We'll have to.

498
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:23,944
I agree. We gave them enough time
to be at each other's throats.

499
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:25,237
Let's send one person.

500
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:26,238
Why don't I go?

501
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:27,531
- Okay.
- I'll handle it.

502
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:32,536
<i>Team KAIST has one attendee, Kim Ji-u.</i>

503
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,663
TEAM KAIST'S KIM JI-U JOINS THE MEETING

504
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,248
Just one.

505
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:37,917
- Only Ji-u?
- It's Ji-u.

506
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:41,128
- We have no info on her.
- Let's go find out her club.

507
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:44,632
We haven't made any queries about her yet,
so it's a bonus for us.

508
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:45,883
Yes, it's good for us.

509
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:51,513
<i>Team SNU in Medicine</i>
<i>has one attendee, Lee Seung-hyeon.</i>

510
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:53,766
- It's Seung-hyeon.
- We might learn his club.

511
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,017
This is looking great.

512
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,977
- We can find out about his club.
- I like it.

513
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:57,895
THEY KNOW HIS RANK

514
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,146
Should I go?

515
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:00,898
Just a second.

516
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,859
- In this setting...
- With me attending?

517
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:06,528
<i>If she's in the band,</i>
<i>the result will be "two people in band."</i>

518
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,698
<i>In this case, all clubs will be mentioned.</i>

519
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,200
KIM JI-U, SUNG TAE-HUN
DRAMA OR DANCE

520
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:15,621
<i>If the result is the drama club,</i>
<i>that confirms Ji-u and Tae-hun's club.</i>

521
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:18,707
- Then, Tae-hun should go.
- He can confirm everything for us.

522
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:22,002
<i>Team SKKU has one attendee, Sung Tae-hun.</i>

523
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:24,046
- Will we get a talent show?
- Sorry?

524
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,674
- I'll dance if we get the dance club.
- Really?

525
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:28,926
TEAM KAIST'S FIRST VISIT TO THE CLUB ROOM

526
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:31,971
The result came out
before Min-seok could finish writing.

527
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:35,057
"When are you joining us, Team KAIST?"

528
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,310
- Ji-u came at long last.
- I get the vibe now.

529
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:39,895
Did you do a talent show?

530
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:40,938
- Of course.
- Really?

531
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:41,939
We all sang a song.

532
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:44,066
You didn't, did you?

533
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:47,319
She's sharp.

534
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:50,030
<i>The result will now be announced.</i>

535
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:53,826
BAND: 2

536
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:58,789
KIM JI-U'S CLUB IS CONFIRMED AS THE BAND

537
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:00,624
Band, two people.

538
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:02,918
That confirms it.

539
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:06,338
Ji-u is in the band.
I got the band with two people.

540
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:07,548
- Band, two people?
- Yes.

541
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,466
- That means Ji-u is in the band.
- Okay.

542
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:10,467
BOTH TEAMS KNOW KIM JI-U'S CLUB

543
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,637
<i>We will have the second meeting</i>
<i>of Round 2 shortly.</i>

544
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:18,684
Time to go seal my fate.

545
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:24,440
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE'S LEE SEUNG-HYEON
ATTENDS MEETINGS BACK TO BACK

546
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,316
- Seung-hyeon is joining?
- Yes.

547
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:30,738
10 MINUTES AGO
I think I can be a tool of attack.

548
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:33,157
You're doomed to die this round anyway.

549
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,158
That's true.

550
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:36,326
I'd better get killed off this round.

551
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:39,288
Then, Team KAIST and Team SKKU
can only get 0.5 points each.

552
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:44,793
<i>There is one important rule governing</i>
<i>the points you can earn through deduction.</i>

553
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:50,174
<i>If multiple people from different teams</i>
<i>succeed at identifying someone,</i>

554
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,218
<i>one single point</i>
<i>will be equally divided between them.</i>

555
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:58,557
<i>Please note that all values</i>
<i>will be truncated to two decimal places.</i>

556
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:03,520
As Team SKKU figured out
my rank and club already,

557
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:06,523
we wanted to give Team KAIST
enough intel to identify me

558
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:11,028
so that Team SKKU would have to share
the point with Team KAIST.

559
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:14,114
We thought it'd be effective
in holding Team SKKU in check.

560
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:21,371
<i>Team SKKU has two attendees,</i>
<i>Lee Dong-jae and Kang Ji-hu.</i>

561
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:27,127
I shouldn't go, right?
Could I go if I had a wingman?

562
00:26:27,211 --> 00:26:29,129
- I'll go with you, then.
- Okay.

563
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:31,799
SENDING 2 ATTENDEES TO AVOID
HAVING 1 PARTICIPANT IDENTIFIED

564
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:40,390
<i>Team KAIST has two attendees,</i>
<i>Jeon Ji-min and Kim Jae-han.</i>

565
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:42,476
They sent two guys.

566
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,353
We have the member.

567
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:45,562
DURING ROUND 1

568
00:26:45,646 --> 00:26:49,817
TEAM SKKU CONFIRMED
THAT KIM JAE-HAN IS A MEMBER

569
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,653
We have more to gain here.

570
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:57,074
We know Jae-han is a member,
so we can figure out Ji-min's rank.

571
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,159
If the result is four members...

572
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:01,203
THAT MEANS JEON JI-MIN IS ALSO A MEMBER

573
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,329
It'll be epic.

574
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:05,374
<i>The result will now be announced.</i>

575
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:06,875
What the...

576
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,544
4 MEMBERS

577
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:09,503
4 MEMBERS

578
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:11,046
- Four members.
- What?

579
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,215
THE BEST OUTCOME THEY WERE HOPING FOR

580
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,300
Ji-min is a member,
and Seung-hyeon is in the band.

581
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:18,971
<i>We will have the third meeting</i>
<i>of Round 2 shortly.</i>

582
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,265
We need ways to avoid
giving Team KAIST information.

583
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,100
We just keep attending meetings.

584
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:24,560
Oh, I see it now.

585
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:30,440
<i>Team SKKU has two attendees,</i>
<i>Kang Ji-hu and Sung Tae-hun.</i>

586
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:31,900
Ji-hu and Tae-hun.

587
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:34,069
- What's their angle?
- What?

588
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,697
- Will I get killed off if I go?
- No way.

589
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,490
We have to risk it. We need the intel.

590
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:39,783
I'll risk my life.

591
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,872
<i>Team KAIST has one attendee, Kang Ji-hoo.</i>

592
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:49,459
<i>Team SNU in Medicine</i>
<i>has one attendee, Lee Seung-hyeon.</i>

593
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:53,755
AS HE IS ALREADY COMPROMISED,
HE JOINS ALL 3 MEETINGS OF ROUND 2

594
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:58,510
<i>Please go to the Club Room.</i>

595
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,138
- I should get a certificate.
- What?

596
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:02,139
For attending all meetings.

597
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:04,766
Why did you not show up
for meetings in Round 1?

598
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,435
We should collect penalty fees.

599
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,687
Why did you join us so late?
You should be fined.

600
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:10,689
<i>The result will now be announced.</i>

601
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,692
BAND: 2

602
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:16,820
- Band, two people.
- Of course.

603
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:18,280
We knew that already.

604
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,407
I found an issue. Hear me out.

605
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,576
- An issue?
- Yes.

606
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:24,870
Seung-hyeon attended all three meetings.

607
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:28,290
Now, even Team KAIST would know
that he's a non-officer of the band.

608
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,833
Since that's the case,

609
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:33,128
we can only get 0.5 points each
when we take him out this round.

610
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:35,047
But only Team SNU in Medicine
knows about my identity,

611
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,465
so they can get one whole point.

612
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,717
Oh, I get it.

613
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,260
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE CAN WIN MORE POINTS

614
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:42,679
We are in an equal setting, but...

615
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:45,474
That's why they sent Seung-hyeon.

616
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:46,558
Listen, guys.

617
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:50,437
We could save Dong-yeon's life.

618
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,772
How?

619
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:53,148
- With the special item.
- No.

620
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:55,609
We can't do that
because they know his identity.

621
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:58,695
They'll know we used it
if he survives after their attack.

622
00:28:58,779 --> 00:28:59,738
That won't help us.

623
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:03,033
We can't waste it over half a point.
You should let me die.

624
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:06,536
But we need to make up for it
with another attack.

625
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,376
<i>We will now begin</i>
<i>the investigation phase of Round 2.</i>

626
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:19,049
ALL THREE TEAMS GATHER INFORMATION

627
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:22,636
Look, I wrote down all the possible cases.

628
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:25,931
I used A and B for the unconfirmed clubs,

629
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:28,642
and alpha and beta
for the unconfirmed ranks.

630
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:30,727
Let's say Min-seok is an alpha.

631
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:33,689
Then, Team KAIST's Ji-hoo
is definitely a beta.

632
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:37,442
<i>We had four possible cases at that point.</i>

633
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:40,654
<i>We couldn't distinguish the drama club</i>
<i>from the dance club,</i>

634
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:43,782
<i>and the same went</i>
<i>for the presidents and the secretaries.</i>

635
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,534
But thanks to the logic of the game,

636
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:48,453
we would be able to confirm everything
with just one more lead.

637
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:52,082
<i>We decided to look for that single lead.</i>

638
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:54,042
We can confirm this much.

639
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,420
- Once we know A and B, we're all set.
- Right.

640
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,714
We're almost there.

641
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,508
Team SNU and we are neck-and-neck.
The information we have is a mirror image.

642
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:03,677
I don't like how evenly matched we are.

643
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,929
We need to get ahead
by asking the right questions

644
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:09,433
and using the special items
at just the right time.

645
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,520
<i>We will now begin</i>
<i>the identity deduction phase of Round 2.</i>

646
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:17,190
Seung-hyeon kept attending the meetings
to become a target.

647
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:18,108
It looked like it.

648
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,360
He wants all enemies to get him
to lessen our points.

649
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:23,322
Then, we should score
on both Seung-hyeon and Tae-hun.

650
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:26,366
- We should keep Team SKKU from scoring.
- That's true.

651
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,785
I'll go take a shot at Seung-hyeon.

652
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:31,163
- We are attacking him, right?
- Seung-hyeon?

653
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,457
- Yes, of course.
- We'll brainstorm in the meantime.

654
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,376
Please select the student ID
of the person whose identity you deduced

655
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:40,339
and state the club
and the rank of that person.

656
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:43,550
Team SNU in Medicine's Lee Seung-hyeon
is a member of the band.

657
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:48,221
Team KAIST will take a swing
at Seung-hyeon.

658
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:49,306
We should target Team KAIST.

659
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:52,225
Team SNU in Medicine
would be done asking questions.

660
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:54,102
- Right.
- They won't need to ask more questions,

661
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:55,228
unlike Team KAIST.

662
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:56,938
If you're out,
you can't ask any questions.

663
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:59,900
I say we attack Team KAIST
and cut off their chances to ask more.

664
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:01,651
The results from this round...

665
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:02,903
They'll be important.

666
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,029
Pivotal.

667
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:08,283
- I hope they rip each other apart.
- What?

668
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:14,790
<i>The identity deduction result of Round 2</i>
<i>will now be announced.</i>

669
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:17,376
<i>Out of all the deductions</i>
<i>by the three teams,</i>

670
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:20,170
<i>only the successful ones</i>
<i>will be taken into account.</i>

671
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,714
<i>We will also announce the contestants</i>

672
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:25,801
<i>who lost their assigned lives</i>
<i>and cannot participate further.</i>

673
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:31,139
<i>Please note that the current scores</i>
<i>will not be shared at this point.</i>

674
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:33,809
Come on.

675
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:39,856
<i>The total number</i>
<i>of successful deductions in Round 2...</i>

676
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,237
<i>is eight.</i>

677
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,280
8 SUCCESSES OUT OF 9 ATTEMPTS

678
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:49,533
Does that mean we were right?

679
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:50,867
At any rate, we had successes.

680
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:51,993
1 FAILURE OUT OF 3 ATTEMPTS

681
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:54,371
That means everyone else was successful.

682
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,331
I guess Jae-han is dead.

683
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:57,833
Shoot, I'm sweating.

684
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:01,920
I guess the meetings in Round 1
were pretty helpful.

685
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:05,006
<i>The contestants who are out of life</i>
<i>due to the correct deductions</i>

686
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,384
<i>will now be revealed.</i>

687
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:09,761
<i>Team SNU in Medicine's Lee Seung-hyeon.</i>

688
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:11,471
- See? Good job.
- I'm good.

689
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:15,642
<i>- Team SKKU's Kim Dong-yeon.</i>
- As expected.

690
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:18,103
<i>Team KAIST's King Ji-hoo.</i>

691
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19,938
What the heck?

692
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,648
Why was I taken out?

693
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:22,983
We're in big trouble.

694
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:25,402
- Ji-min is out, too.
<i>- Lastly, Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min.</i>

695
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:26,820
WRONG STRATEGY CAUSED 2 LOSSES

696
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:29,739
Losing a member is critical
because it means one less question.

697
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:31,074
- Exactly.
- One less question.

698
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:33,410
We have to do all we can
not to lose them early on.

699
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:35,662
Let's wipe out
the other teams' members first.

700
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:36,580
Exactly.

701
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:38,081
How did this happen?

702
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:40,709
Give me a minute.
Let me figure out what went wrong.

703
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:42,919
The dead can't attend meetings, right?

704
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:43,837
Right.

705
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:47,215
I bet Team SNU in Medicine
took a gamble to take out Ji-min.

706
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:50,177
10 MINUTES AGO
Here's what I think.

707
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,762
Why don't we take a guess
on one of these people?

708
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:55,348
If we get a positive,
we get the lead we needed.

709
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:57,184
- We can determine which club is which.
- Right.

710
00:32:57,267 --> 00:33:00,437
Let's take two shots at Ji-hoo
as the secretary of the band.

711
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,855
- The band's secretary?
- Yes.

712
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:04,608
If he dies, he's the secretary.
If not, he's the president.

713
00:33:05,192 --> 00:33:07,527
- Then, we get the full picture.
- You're right.

714
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:10,572
As for Ji-min, let's say
he's a member of the dance club.

715
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:13,158
What's our plan?
How many shots do we take at Ji-hoo?

716
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,577
Let's take 2 shots at Ji-hoo
and 1 shot at Ji-u.

717
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,163
Okay, two shots
at Team KAIST's Kang Ji-hoo.

718
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:20,332
One shot at Kim Ji-u,
the band's president.

719
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,625
ROUND 2 IDENTITY DEDUCTION RESULT

720
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:25,086
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE AND TEAM SKKU
MADE 3 SUCCESSFUL DEDUCTIONS EACH

721
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:28,840
AS BOTH TEAMS TARGETED KANG JI-HOO,
THEY WIN 0.5 POINTS FOR EACH DEDUCTION

722
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:31,843
THEY WIN 1 POINT
FOR THE REMAINING SOLO DEDUCTION

723
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:35,931
1 FAILURE AND 2 SUCCESSFUL SOLO DEDUCTIONS
TEAM KAIST WON 2 POINTS IN TOTAL

724
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:39,726
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE: 2,
TEAM SKKU: 2, TEAM KAIST: 2

725
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:43,396
<i>We will have the first meeting</i>
<i>of Round 3 shortly.</i>

726
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,524
Does Team SNU in Medicine know everything?

727
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:48,443
- They do now because we took out Ji-hoo.
- Oh, you're right.

728
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:51,029
- They must've filled all the blanks.
- Right.

729
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,447
THE RESULT COMPLETED
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE'S TABLE

730
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:54,866
Let's recap.
We now have everyone's identity.

731
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,701
<i>Min-seok is the dance club's president.</i>

732
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:58,703
<i>Team SKKU's Ji-hu is a member there.</i>

733
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:03,083
<i>- Next, Seo-yeon and I are the same.</i>
<i>- You're members of the drama club.</i>

734
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:06,002
<i>- What about Tae-hun?</i>
<i>- He's the drama club's president.</i>

735
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:08,797
<i>- Okay, we're all set now.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

736
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,218
Team KAIST wouldn't have any leads on us,

737
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:14,344
- would they?
- Well...

738
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:17,055
That might actually harm our chances.

739
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:19,599
Suppose Team KAIST
only attacked Team SKKU.

740
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:21,851
Then, they would chip away
at the points we could gain.

741
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:25,647
Let's use the remaining time to figure out
what Team KAIST knows about us.

742
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,649
We'll think from their perspectives.

743
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,651
We need to give them clues about us.

744
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,695
They should at least know

745
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,238
- as much as Team SKKU.
- Exactly.

746
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,365
- We should give them clues.
- We've got to

747
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:38,868
so they can target us
and lower Team SKKU's point gain.

748
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:40,453
<i>First off,</i>

749
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:42,163
we determined that Team KAIST

750
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:45,458
had limited information
compared to us or Team SKKU.

751
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:49,170
<i>So we decided that our best option</i>
<i>was to feed them information about us</i>

752
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:52,340
<i>so that they would make</i>
<i>correct deductions on us</i>

753
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:54,509
<i>and diminish the points</i>
<i>Team SKKU could earn.</i>

754
00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:57,721
We should make them target us
before they go for Team SKKU.

755
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:01,266
I do agree that we should feed
Team KAIST information on us, but...

756
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,227
We have too little to go on.

757
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:07,564
MISSING THE MEETINGS IN ROUND 1
LEFT TEAM KAIST WITHOUT MUCH INFO

758
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,858
I'd say it's time for a curveball.

759
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,652
Let's lay everything bare
and become targets.

760
00:35:12,736 --> 00:35:15,614
Yes, why not? It doesn't matter
if we all died right now.

761
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:18,742
<i>Those of you attending the meeting</i>
<i>from Team SNU in Medicine,</i>

762
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:20,285
<i>please come out.</i>

763
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,455
What can we do
to make Team KAIST attack us?

764
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:26,583
Let's skip the first meeting
and join the third meeting only.

765
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,960
For the third meeting,
Team KAIST will be asked before us.

766
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:31,963
Let's see what they do
and match their number.

767
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,841
I'm sure that would give them
more than enough information.

768
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:37,844
- Jae-han is doomed for sure.
<i>- Your time is up.</i>

769
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:41,598
<i>Team SNU in Medicine has no attendees.</i>

770
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,642
This is bad. They're shutting us out.

771
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:47,562
<i>I felt devastated.</i>
<i>It seemed like the game was over for us.</i>

772
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,439
<i>We had almost no information,</i>

773
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:51,775
<i>while the others pieced out</i>
<i>almost everything.</i>

774
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,778
They had no incentive
to give us information,

775
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:57,822
so we couldn't exactly expect
to see them in meetings.

776
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:01,034
So I thought, "This is it for us."

777
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:03,662
We should've skipped meetings later on,

778
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:06,581
not in the early stages.

779
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:10,293
<i>Those of you attending the meeting</i>
<i>from Team SKKU, please come out.</i>

780
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:13,088
No one would come.

781
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,632
Absolutely no one.

782
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,175
<i>Team SKKU</i>

783
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:21,471
<i>has two attendees,</i>
<i>Lee Dong-jae and Kang Ji-hu.</i>

784
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:22,764
TEAM SKKU'S SURPRISING DECISION

785
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:26,768
<i>...has two attendees,</i>
<i>Lee Dong-jae and Kang Ji-hu.</i>

786
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:28,103
We still have a shot.

787
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,813
Things might not be so bad.

788
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,399
Why would they have come out?

789
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,361
Those two are likely in the same club.

790
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:39,698
Since that's the case,
their club will be revealed.

791
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:40,740
KIM JAE-HAN GROUPS THEM TOGETHER

792
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,951
- This fits the bill, right?
- I think so.

793
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:45,870
THEY DO INDEED BELONG TO THE DANCE CLUB

794
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:47,330
Let's send Jae-han.

795
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:55,088
<i>Team KAIST has one attendee, Kim Jae-han.</i>

796
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:57,132
<i>Please go to the Club Room.</i>

797
00:36:57,841 --> 00:36:59,592
They'll get, "dance club, two people."

798
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:01,136
Once that is announced,

799
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,847
Team KAIST will know
that those two are both in the dance club.

800
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,640
Right.

801
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:07,726
<i>The result will now be announced.</i>

802
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:08,852
DANCE CLUB: 2

803
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,772
- We're in the dance club.
- I told you, didn't I?

804
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:15,400
- That confirms this.
- Our scribbles turned out to be right.

805
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,277
We now have the full picture, too.

806
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,696
What matters now is
deciding who to take out and when.

807
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:22,031
- It's all about hits now.
- That and the special items.

808
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:25,118
<i>We will have the second meeting</i>
<i>of Round 3 shortly.</i>

809
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:27,162
Do we attend the rank meeting?

810
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,831
We do. We need to keep
dropping the breadcrumbs.

811
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,167
Right, we need to let
Team KAIST know about us.

812
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:36,337
<i>Team SKKU has one attendee, Lee Dong-jae.</i>

813
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,798
<i>They've sent the secretary.</i>

814
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:41,342
I need to go check out the result.

815
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:42,802
We need Dong-jae's rank.

816
00:37:43,136 --> 00:37:46,723
<i>Team KAIST has one attendee, Kim Jae-han.</i>

817
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:52,395
In this setup, it would be better
for us to send a non-officer.

818
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,355
Then, the result will say two members.

819
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:56,983
Jae-han won't learn about Dong-jae's rank.

820
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:59,360
But he'd figure out that you're a member.

821
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:01,905
<i>It's better for us</i>
<i>to hide Dong-jae's rank from Jae-han.</i>

822
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:05,116
Right, once he learns Dong-jae's rank,
he'll likely attack him.

823
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:10,205
<i>Team SNU in Medicine</i>
<i>has one attendee, Joo Min-seo.</i>

824
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:14,793
Judging by the attendance,
they don't seem to know everything.

825
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:18,213
Lee Dong-jae, Joo Min-seo.

826
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,632
I'll make a table

827
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:23,885
and work out how we ended up in this mess.

828
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,054
<i>The result will now be announced.</i>

829
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,764
2 MEMBERS

830
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:31,392
<i>We will have the third meeting</i>
<i>of Round 3 shortly.</i>

831
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,312
<i>Team KAIST has one attendee, Kim Jae-han.</i>

832
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:37,857
<i>Jae-han is bound to die anyway.</i>
<i>They know everything about him.</i>

833
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:40,443
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE AND TEAM SKKU
BOTH JOIN TO INFLUENCE THE RESULT

834
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:42,487
<i>The result will now be announced.</i>

835
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,322
DRAMA CLUB: 2

836
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,950
How did it go?

837
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:49,536
Drama club, two people.

838
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:52,038
So you're in the drama club.
That's decided.

839
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:53,998
- How so?
- There are no possible cases.

840
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:56,125
- He's right about that.
- Really?

841
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:58,294
You're in the drama club,
and I'm in the dance club.

842
00:38:58,378 --> 00:39:00,171
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

843
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:01,506
The dance club goes in here.

844
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,383
Two dance club members,
so the drama club goes here.

845
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,260
These two are drama club members.

846
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:08,471
If this person is a non-officer,
that person has to be an officer.

847
00:39:08,555 --> 00:39:11,015
If this person is an officer,
the rest are non-officers.

848
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:13,142
That's the only possible scenario.

849
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:17,480
<i>We will now begin</i>
<i>the investigation phase of Round 3.</i>

850
00:39:17,564 --> 00:39:19,899
If Min-seok is a member,
Seo-yeon is an officer.

851
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:21,442
Otherwise, Tae-hun is an officer.

852
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:24,946
NOW, TEAM KAIST ONLY HAS TO DETERMINE
THE RANKS OF THESE 3 PEOPLE

853
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:28,116
Won't it be best to have Jae-han
ask about Min-seok's rank?

854
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:29,284
INVESTIGATION

855
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,911
Team KAIST's Kim Jae-han.
Please ask a question.

856
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:35,874
Does Kim Min-seok
have the same rank as mine?

857
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:38,001
No, he doesn't.

858
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:42,046
That concludes your investigation.
Please leave the room.

859
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:46,551
Min-seok is definitely an officer.

860
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:49,012
That means Min-seok is
an officer of the dance club.

861
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:51,598
Ji-u now has to go
and find another president.

862
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:53,808
Why don't you go ask about Min-seok?

863
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:57,228
To see if he's the president? Got it.

864
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,690
We might still make a comeback.

865
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:04,694
- It's up to dividing our attacks right.
- Yeah, you can say that again.

866
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:06,863
Our original plan actually centers
on this point onward.

867
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:09,115
No one can ignore
the information discrepancy in Round 2.

868
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:11,284
Min-seok is the president.

869
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:12,827
It's great.

870
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:15,330
I think that eliminated
the slim margin of error.

871
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,873
- We know everything.
- He's the president.

872
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:18,917
We have all our puzzle pieces.

873
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,669
NO INVESTIGATIONS
FROM TEAM SKKU AND TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE

874
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:25,131
<i>We will now begin</i>
<i>the identity deduction phase of Round 3.</i>

875
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,801
Would Team SKKU use
the Dismiss Deductions card now?

876
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:30,053
I doubt Team KAIST would.

877
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:33,890
In that case, it'd be better to win
two points from Team KAIST.

878
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,683
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE MAKES DEDUCTIONS
ABOUT TEAM KAIST FIRST

879
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:39,979
Kim Jae-han is a member of the drama club.

880
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:42,941
Wait, let's think about this.

881
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:46,194
If Team SNU in Medicine
and Team SKKU target each other,

882
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,154
- it'll be like a ping-pong match.
- Right.

883
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:51,282
Since that's the case,
wouldn't they try to take us out first?

884
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:52,700
<i>From that perspective,</i>

885
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:56,037
<i>the most balanced approach</i>
<i>would be to attack us.</i>

886
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,164
Once someone is out,
you can't score with them.

887
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:00,208
You're right. That's a valid point.

888
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:03,002
Let's use
the Dismiss Deductions card on Ji-u.

889
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:05,755
Which team do you want to go up against?

890
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:08,424
- For the Deathmatch?
- Who would you rather face?

891
00:41:08,508 --> 00:41:10,927
- These guys.
- Is Team SNU weaker?

892
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:14,472
- Absolutely.
- I would rather face Team SNU.

893
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:17,850
- Okay, let's drag them with us.
- Team SKKU is intimidating.

894
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:19,185
Here's another idea.

895
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:20,979
We don't have that many lives left.

896
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:23,439
What if we went all-in on Team SNU?

897
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:25,316
We can finish off the whole team.

898
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,777
- Team SKKU won't get to score later.
- Exactly.

899
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,862
Once Team SNU is out of the picture,

900
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:31,656
we can win.

901
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,825
- That makes sense.
- Should we take three shots at Min-seok?

902
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:36,244
Wait, do we take out
Team SKKU or Team SNU?

903
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:39,038
If we're going to wipe out a whole team...

904
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,875
- Team SKKU is the better choice.
- Agreed.

905
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:46,254
Okay, why don't we assume
Team SNU in Medicine will attack me

906
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,214
and just take three shots at Tae-hun?

907
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:51,134
- I suggest 2 at Tae-hun and 1 at Ji-hu.
- Just like that?

908
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:54,804
<i>Do we all accept Ji-hoo's proposal?</i>

909
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:56,180
Then, the Dismiss Deductions card.

910
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:57,849
FOR KIM JI-U
Right.

911
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,600
Where were we again?

912
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:01,561
Team KAIST will likely shield
Ji-u this time, right?

913
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:02,478
Yes.

914
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:06,524
They will expect her to be a target
and use the Dismiss Deductions card.

915
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:10,278
I would like to use
the Dismiss Deductions card on Kim Ji-u.

916
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:13,448
Team KAIST used
the Dismiss Deductions card.

917
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:16,117
So we'll avoid attacking her entirely.

918
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,537
Instead, our targets are Jae-han,
Min-seo, and Min-seok.

919
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,705
- You with me?
- Sure.

920
00:42:20,997 --> 00:42:23,916
How do you feel about attacking Seo-yeon?

921
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,378
You'd rather secure two points safely
with Jae-han and Seo-yeon?

922
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:29,172
Seo-yeon won't be protected.

923
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:31,007
At worst,
we'd share the points with Team KAIST.

924
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:34,135
I'll go take a shot
at Seo-yeon, Min-seo, and Jae-han.

925
00:42:35,011 --> 00:42:37,388
TEAM SKKU'S DEDUCTIONS IN ROUND 3
ALL CORRECT

926
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:39,182
<i>Your time is up.</i>

927
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:42,560
<i>The identity deduction result of Round 3</i>
<i>will now be announced.</i>

928
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:44,187
ONLY THE SUCCESSFUL DEDUCTIONS COUNT

929
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:47,356
<i>The total number</i>
<i>of successful deductions...</i>

930
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:51,527
<i>is eight.</i>

931
00:42:51,611 --> 00:42:53,613
I guess someone made a mistake.

932
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,865
- One team must've missed things.
- That might be Team KAIST.

933
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:59,452
Or the Dismiss Deductions card
might have been used.

934
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:02,205
- Did our special item block a bullet?
- I suppose so.

935
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,584
<i>The contestants whose identities</i>
<i>have been correctly deduced</i>

936
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:08,377
<i>will now be revealed.</i>

937
00:43:08,461 --> 00:43:10,755
<i>They are Team KAIST's Kim Jae-han</i>

938
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:13,966
<i>and Team SNU in Medicine's Joo Min-seo.</i>

939
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:17,637
JOO MIN-SEO AND KIM JAE-HAN ARE OUT

940
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:22,100
<i>We will now begin</i>
<i>the identity deduction phase of Round 4.</i>

941
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:27,063
Let's target three people this time.
Tae-hun, Dong-jae, and Ji-hu.

942
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:28,898
- I like it.
- We'll earn three points.

943
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:30,441
Then, Team SKKU would be wiped out.

944
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:32,568
Team SNU would have no targets,
but we could still win points.

945
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:34,070
- Yeah.
- Good idea.

946
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:39,367
TEAM KAIST ATTACKS TEAM SKKU ONCE MORE

947
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,828
I don't think Ji-u will die this round.

948
00:43:41,911 --> 00:43:42,912
She might still survive.

949
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:46,040
Yes, we can still turn things around.

950
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:49,794
I don't think Team KAIST would've used
the Dismiss Deductions card.

951
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:52,505
I agree with Min-seok because...

952
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:55,299
If they hadn't already,
they could use it now.

953
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:57,677
Then, we can't score any points
by attacking Ji-u.

954
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,513
Of course.
They might not have expected two deaths,

955
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:01,889
so they could use it now.

956
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:04,225
In that case,
one shot per target might be better.

957
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:07,228
- So we're attacking Team SKKU only?
- Yes, one shot for each person.

958
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:09,313
Can't we shoot three targets?

959
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:12,191
One surefire shot
at Min-seok, Seo-yeon, and Ji-u.

960
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:15,611
- One shot each?
- At Min-seok, Seo-yeon, and Ji-u?

961
00:44:15,695 --> 00:44:18,197
All right, then. When do we use
the Dismiss Deductions card?

962
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,241
We should use it now on you or me.

963
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,617
I say we use it on Tae-hun.

964
00:44:21,701 --> 00:44:23,786
You can save me this time,
but I'll die in Round 5.

965
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:25,371
That doesn't matter.

966
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:26,747
You're welcome to die.

967
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:28,457
Come on, don't say that.

968
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:30,668
He's doomed anyway.

969
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:33,421
I'll use the Dismiss Deductions card
on myself.

970
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:37,592
<i>The identity deduction result</i>
<i>will now be announced.</i>

971
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:43,639
<i>The total number</i>
<i>of successful deductions in Round 4...</i>

972
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:47,768
<i>is five.</i>

973
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:50,521
- Five.
- Five? That's an awkward number.

974
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:52,857
<i>The contestants whose identities</i>
<i>have been correctly deduced</i>

975
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,275
<i>will now be revealed.</i>

976
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:57,278
ONLY THE PRESIDENTS SURVIVED

977
00:44:57,862 --> 00:44:59,238
I made it.

978
00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:01,616
- I survived somehow.
- Team SKKU must've shielded Tae-hun.

979
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,701
The same goes for Min-seok.

980
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:06,787
Both teams used the special item,
and Ji-u somehow survived without it.

981
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:08,623
Quick, let's do the tally.

982
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:11,375
I'm pretty excited I survived.

983
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:15,671
<i>We will now begin</i>
<i>the identity deduction phase of Round 5.</i>

984
00:45:16,297 --> 00:45:19,508
Only five successes means
someone used the special item.

985
00:45:19,592 --> 00:45:21,052
- That's for sure.
- Right?

986
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:23,346
Five successes means four blocked attacks.

987
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:26,974
That means at least two teams
must've used the special item.

988
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:30,394
They've probably used up
their Dismiss Deductions cards.

989
00:45:30,478 --> 00:45:32,563
Wouldn't they be gone by now?

990
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:34,190
- Of course.
- They're all gone.

991
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:35,441
- Right?
- Sure.

992
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:38,945
Let's see.
We attacked Min-seok only once, right?

993
00:45:39,028 --> 00:45:41,989
He'd have three lives left
if Team KAIST hasn't attacked him already.

994
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:43,991
Yeah, he has the most lives left.

995
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:46,452
Okay, so let's suppose
he has three lives left.

996
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:50,539
KIM MIN-SEOK ACTUALLY DOES HAVE
THE MOST LIVES LEFT

997
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,917
Shouldn't we take 1 shot at Ji-u
and 2 shots at Min-seok?

998
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,670
- Of course.
- If Min-seok dies after the three shots,

999
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:58,798
- the points will be divided.
- You're right.

1000
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:02,051
Kim Min-seok is...

1001
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:05,137
2 IDENTITY DEDUCTIONS ON KIM MIN-SEOK
He is the dance club's president.

1002
00:46:05,388 --> 00:46:07,598
She is the band's president.

1003
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:10,893
The crazy thing is that no one knows
how many lives Ji-u has left.

1004
00:46:10,977 --> 00:46:12,645
They would think
Team SNU used the special item.

1005
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:15,690
Both teams would believe
that we used the card in the last round.

1006
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:18,234
They'll all try to gun down Ji-u
from that misunderstanding.

1007
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:20,361
- And if they do...
- We may actually win.

1008
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,321
- You're laying it on thick.
- I think we have a shot.

1009
00:46:22,405 --> 00:46:24,949
That scenario isn't so hopeless
because I survived somehow.

1010
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:26,742
Yes, that makes it pretty possible.

1011
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:29,704
- Let's dig into the possibilities.
- Okay, will do.

1012
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:32,373
Five successes suggests
both teams used the item.

1013
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:33,666
- I'm sure of it.
- Me too.

1014
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:36,377
Should we divide the shots,
or fire all three at Min-seok?

1015
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,004
- We might win.
- The former is better.

1016
00:46:38,087 --> 00:46:40,214
DECIDES TO ATTACK SUNG TAE-HUN ONCE
AND KIM MIN-SEOK TWICE

1017
00:46:40,298 --> 00:46:41,882
Let's go submit our decision.

1018
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:45,177
TEAM KAIST'S DEDUCTIONS IN ROUND 5
ALL CORRECT

1019
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:47,221
We took a shot at Tae-hun once.

1020
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:49,849
- But we haven't attacked Ji-u yet.
- No, we haven't.

1021
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:51,475
Then, 1 at Tae-hun and 2 at Ji-u.

1022
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:54,729
TEAM SNU'S DEDUCTIONS IN ROUND 5
ALL CORRECT

1023
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:59,650
<i>The identity deduction result of Round 5</i>
<i>will now be announced.</i>

1024
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:01,736
- Ji-u has to die, right?
- Right.

1025
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:03,863
She has to die now.

1026
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:07,199
<i>The total number</i>
<i>of successful deductions in Round 5...</i>

1027
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:16,000
<i>is five.</i>

1028
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:19,170
ONLY 5 SUCCESSES OUT OF 9 ATTEMPTS

1029
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:22,089
- Why only five?
- Did someone use the item?

1030
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:24,425
<i>The contestants whose identities</i>
<i>have been correctly deduced</i>

1031
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:25,384
<i>will now be revealed.</i>

1032
00:47:25,468 --> 00:47:27,762
<i>They are Team SKKU's Sung Tae-hun</i>

1033
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:30,431
<i>and Team KAIST's Kim Ji-u.</i>

1034
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:37,813
SOLE SURVIVOR,
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE'S KIM MIN-SEOK

1035
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:41,317
- The special item...
- They saved it until now?

1036
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,568
That was smart.

1037
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:43,778
They fired four shots at him.

1038
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:46,489
Both teams attacked him twice
and her once.

1039
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:48,324
They were out of the special item,

1040
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:50,284
- so we were the only ones.
- Right.

1041
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:53,412
What do we do
about our Dismiss Deductions card?

1042
00:47:53,496 --> 00:47:55,122
Do we use it now?

1043
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:58,042
The other teams would've tried
to balance their attacks,

1044
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,794
so Min-seok would make it through.

1045
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:02,671
I think it'd be best to use
the Dismiss Deductions card

1046
00:48:02,755 --> 00:48:03,839
on Min-seok in the next round.

1047
00:48:03,923 --> 00:48:05,549
<i>Based on our analysis,</i>

1048
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:09,345
the other teams would use
the Dismiss Deductions card in Round 4.

1049
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:11,347
It was logical to think

1050
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:15,351
that the others would expect us
to use it in Round 4 as well.

1051
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,770
So my first thought was

1052
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:20,398
that it would be a waste
to use the special item

1053
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:22,441
when they wouldn't attack Min-seok.

1054
00:48:22,525 --> 00:48:23,734
And in Round 5,

1055
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:27,071
if the final and sole surviving member
of my team were Min-seok, the president,

1056
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:29,281
the other teams would have
no choice but to target him.

1057
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:32,451
If we used the special item then,
we could make it more worthwhile.

1058
00:48:32,535 --> 00:48:35,079
<i>That was the conclusion we reached.</i>

1059
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:39,792
I would like to use
the Dismiss Deductions card on myself.

1060
00:48:40,835 --> 00:48:42,878
- Did we get someone wrong?
- That must be it.

1061
00:48:42,962 --> 00:48:44,547
I think we made a wrong deduction.

1062
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:47,466
Otherwise, the result is inexplicable.

1063
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:52,263
<i>All contestants' club and rank</i>
<i>will now be revealed.</i>

1064

<i>Team SNU in Medicine's Kim Min-seok</i>

00:48:56,392 --> 00:49:00,396

00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:11,240
<i>- is a member of the dance club.</i>
- We got them mixed up.

1071
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:12,658
Did we have an alternative?

1072
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:14,660
- Yes, we did.
- Oh, man.

1073
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:18,122
<i>Now, the final results.</i>

1074
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,583

1077
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:29,550
Looking good. We should be fine.

1078
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:31,177
- They did great.
<i>- Team KAIST</i>

1079
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:34,305
<i>won 4.5 points.</i>

1080

<i>...won 8.16 points.</i>

1088
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:53,991
TEAM SKKU'S NARROW DEFEAT

1089
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:56,619
<i>Team SNU in Medicine won the match.</i>

1090
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:58,287
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE WON

1091
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:00,164
We won by a hair.

1092
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:01,999
What a bummer.

1093
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:05,669
- We did our best.
- We've got this.

1094
00:50:06,462 --> 00:50:08,297
Don't lose heart.
We're the Deathmatch champs.

1095
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:10,549
- The margin was so narrow.
- We won.

1096
00:50:10,633 --> 00:50:12,134
- We won!
- Good work.

1097
00:50:12,218 --> 00:50:14,220
- Thanks, guys.
- Everyone did so well.

1098
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:18,724
Honestly, we made the best decision
at every point of the game.

1099
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:21,393
FASTEST TO DETERMINE
EVERYONE'S CLUB AND RANK

1100
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:24,188
ANALYZED AND ANTICIPATED
THE OTHER TEAMS' SPECIAL ITEM USE

1101
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:28,234
USED THEIR OWN SPECIAL ITEM
AT JUST THE RIGHT TIME

1102
00:50:28,317 --> 00:50:30,653
The points we could win
would be affected substantially

1103
00:50:30,903 --> 00:50:34,198
<i>by the other teams' game decisions.</i>

1104
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:37,243
So we considered every angle
and weighed every possibility.

1105
00:50:37,326 --> 00:50:38,285
It'd be great for us.

1106
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:41,121
Team SKKU's 2 attacks
would only give them 1.33 points.

1107
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:44,208
It's better for us
to hide Dong-jae's rank from Jae-han.

1108
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:47,044
If we attack as well,
we can eat into their point gain.

1109
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:49,296
Let's take a shot
at a member of Team KAIST.

1110
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:53,676
I think we can attribute today's success
to everyone's tireless efforts

1111
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:55,928
to devise a plan to maximize our score.

1112
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:57,513
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE WON THE MAIN MATCH

1113
00:50:57,596 --> 00:50:59,557
That was pretty fun.

1114
00:51:01,517 --> 00:51:04,395
We definitely grew stronger.

1115
00:51:04,937 --> 00:51:07,439
<i>Team SNU in Medicine,</i>
<i>you secured your survival.</i>

1116
00:51:07,523 --> 00:51:09,817
<i>Please go to your base camp.</i>

1117
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:14,029
- I'm so jealous.
- Same.

1118
00:51:17,116 --> 00:51:18,909
<i>I knew that Team SKKU</i>
<i>was a formidable rival,</i>

1119
00:51:18,993 --> 00:51:21,620
<i>but we had to beat them at least once</i>
<i>to become the champions.</i>

1120
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:24,415
<i>It's my long-awaited face-off</i>
<i>against Ji-hu.</i>

1121
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:26,083
<i>I'm very excited.</i>

1122
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:30,337
<i>We'll defeat Team KAIST</i>
<i>in today's Deathmatch</i>

1123
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:33,507
<i>and face Team SNU in Medicine</i>
<i>in the finals.</i>

1124
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:35,050
What will be today's Deathmatch?

1125
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:37,386
<i>The Deathmatch for the semifinal is</i>

1126
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:39,805
<i>X-ray Vision Poker.</i>

1127
00:51:40,973 --> 00:51:42,141
It's a poker game.

1128
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:43,475
"X-ray Vision Poker"?

1129
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:45,561
Would it test our spatial awareness?

1130
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:47,187
<i>In X-ray Vision Poker,</i>

1131
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:49,815
<i>you will be shown tables</i>
<i>with numbers to memorize.</i>

1132
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:54,278
<i>You will then have to rely on your memory</i>
<i>to make a stronger hand.</i>

1133
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,655
<i>I felt confident.</i>

1134
00:51:57,448 --> 00:51:59,700
<i>The match comprises three rounds.</i>

1135
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:03,454
<i>In every round,</i>
<i>two players from each team will compete.</i>

1136
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:06,874
<i>Rounds 1 and 2 require different players,</i>

1137
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:09,960
<i>but anyone can participate in Round 3.</i>

1138
00:52:10,044 --> 00:52:11,170
Two players per team?

1139
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:13,380
That means everyone has to participate.

1140
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:14,923
<i>When the game begins,</i>

1141
00:52:15,007 --> 00:52:17,843
<i>the players will be shown</i>
<i>2 tables filled with 40 numbers</i>

1142
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:19,637
5 MINUTES TO MEMORIZE
<i>at the same time.</i>

1143
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:24,808
<i>The two tables have the same numbers</i>
<i>but in a different arrangement.</i>

1144
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:28,354
<i>You can use the five minutes</i>
<i>allotted to memorization</i>

1145
00:52:28,437 --> 00:52:30,105
<i>to memorize the table</i>
<i>assigned to your team</i>

1146
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:33,859
<i>as well as the one</i>
<i>designated to your opponents.</i>

1147
00:52:37,321 --> 00:52:39,239
They will have to take one each.

1148
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:43,452
<i>While you will be shown</i>
<i>40 numbers in each round,</i>

1149
00:52:43,786 --> 00:52:47,706
<i>their range will increase every round.</i>

1150
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:49,416
ROUND 1: 1-50,
ROUND 2: 1-60, ROUND 3: 1-70

1151
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:55,464
<i>Please note that the multiples of five</i>
<i>will be excluded in every round.</i>

1152
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:57,508
<i>After five minutes,</i>

1153
00:52:57,591 --> 00:53:00,886
<i>the numbers will be replaced</i>
<i>by coordinates.</i>

1154
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:05,140
<i>You will then use the 40 coordinate cards</i>

1155
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:08,977
<i>and two sets of the arithmetic symbols</i>

1156
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:12,564
3-MINUTE DEADLINE
<i>to complete an equation for your hand.</i>

1157
00:53:12,648 --> 00:53:15,984
<i>There will be three match-ups per round.</i>

1158
00:53:16,068 --> 00:53:19,822
<i>Once used, the coordinate cards</i>
<i>cannot be used again</i>

1159
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:22,866
<i>while the symbol cards can be reused.</i>

1160
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:25,369
<i>During this phase of the game,</i>

1161
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:28,831
<i>the numbers in the table</i>
<i>will not be shown again.</i>

1162
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:31,500
<i>You must rely on your memory</i>
<i>to build your equations</i>

1163
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:34,837
<i>and calculate them mentally.</i>

1164
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:37,423
What the... That's insane.

1165
00:53:37,506 --> 00:53:39,508
They'll need to be hyper-focused.

1166
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:43,429
<i>The completed equation's result</i>
<i>will be your hand for this poker game.</i>

1167
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:46,724
<i>The accepted hands are as follows.</i>

1168
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:49,977
<i>The first option is the triple.</i>

1169
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,979
<i>A triple is when your equation produces</i>

1170
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:54,189
<i>a three-digit number</i>
<i>with identical digits.</i>

1171
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:57,109
<i>The second option is the straight.</i>

1172
00:53:57,526 --> 00:53:59,027
<i>A straight is when your equation produces</i>

1173
00:53:59,111 --> 00:54:01,405
<i>a three-digit number</i>
<i>with consecutive digits.</i>

1174
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:05,367
<i>But please remember</i>
<i>that the reverse order is unacceptable.</i>

1175
00:54:05,993 --> 00:54:08,829
<i>The third option is the double.</i>

1176
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:12,583
<i>A double is when your equation produces</i>
<i>a two-digit number with identical digits.</i>

1177
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:17,379
<i>A 3-digit number with 2 identical digits</i>
<i>will not be considered a double.</i>

1178
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:20,299
So a number like 122 is not acceptable.

1179
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:22,092
<i>When ranked in order,</i>

1180
00:54:22,176 --> 00:54:25,304
<i>triple has the highest rank,</i>
<i>followed by straight and double.</i>

1181
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:29,391
<i>If the hands are of the same rank,</i>
<i>the larger number wins.</i>

1182
00:54:29,475 --> 00:54:30,893
TRIPLE 222 WINS OVER TRIPLE 111

1183
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:34,521
<i>However, there is one exception.</i>

1184
00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:39,359
<i>The triple 999 loses to the triple 111.</i>

1185
00:54:39,443 --> 00:54:41,111
- That's so hard.
- There's a cycle, then.

1186
00:54:41,195 --> 00:54:42,571
Right.

1187
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:44,448
<i>When the equations are submitted,</i>

1188
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:48,035
<i>calculate your opponent's equation</i>
<i>based on your memory,</i>

1189
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:51,038
<i>evaluate your chances,</i>
<i>and place a bet with your coins.</i>

1190
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:54,166
<i>The minimum amount is a single coin,</i>

1191
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:58,504
<i>and the maximum amount is the number</i>
<i>of coordinate cards in your equation.</i>

1192
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:03,175
You should use more cards
because that is tied to the bet.

1193
00:55:03,592 --> 00:55:06,512
They'll definitely have to try
to memorize the opponent's table.

1194
00:55:06,595 --> 00:55:10,933
You can't have success in bets
if you don't know their result.

1195
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:12,684
That's the best way.

1196
00:55:12,768 --> 00:55:14,394
Each person has to memorize a table.

1197
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:16,313
That makes their bets more profitable.

1198
00:55:17,064 --> 00:55:18,649
<i>Once all bets have been placed,</i>

1199
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:21,610
<i>the results will be announced.</i>

1200
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:24,530
<i>The team</i>
<i>with the higher-ranking hand wins,</i>

1201
00:55:24,613 --> 00:55:29,451
<i>and all the coins in the betting pool</i>
<i>will be awarded to the winner.</i>

1202
00:55:30,202 --> 00:55:33,121
<i>If the results are identical,</i>

1203
00:55:33,205 --> 00:55:35,874
<i>both parties can only receive</i>
<i>the coins they bet.</i>

1204
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:39,878
<i>If both teams' results</i>
<i>are not an acceptable hand,</i>

1205
00:55:39,962 --> 00:55:43,090
<i>the team with the larger result wins.</i>

1206
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:47,469
<i>Please note that if your equation</i>
<i>produces a four-digit number,</i>

1207
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:50,013
<i>your team will immediately</i>
<i>lose that match-up.</i>

1208
00:55:51,223 --> 00:55:53,141
<i>The winner of the Deathmatch</i>

1209
00:55:53,225 --> 00:55:57,229
<i>will be decided by the accumulated coins</i>
<i>from all three rounds.</i>

1210
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:58,897
So the coins decide the winner.

1211
00:55:58,981 --> 00:56:00,107
In that case,

1212
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,526
instead of wins and losses,
all three rounds must be played.

1213
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:04,862
<i>Both teams,</i>
<i>please start discussing your strategies.</i>

1214
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,573
<i>You'll be given 20 minutes.</i>

1215
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:11,743
Isn't this the most challenging
Deathmatch so far?

1216
00:56:11,827 --> 00:56:12,953
Absolutely.

1217
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:15,747
The team that makes it out of this
gets my respect.

1218
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:18,166
<i>It's pretty similar to Lucky 21.</i>

1219
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:19,626
<i>I feel good about this game.</i>

1220
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:22,421
The way I see it,
we need to keep producing triples.

1221
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:24,590
- Yes, three triples each round.
- Of course.

1222
00:56:24,673 --> 00:56:26,633
I thought about the general flow.

1223
00:56:26,842 --> 00:56:29,303
On average, 888 is a very potent hand.

1224
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:33,015
The relationship between 888, 999, and 111
is like rock-paper-scissors.

1225
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:34,391
- Rock-paper-scissors?
- Yes.

1226
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:35,601
It's the same thing.

1227
00:56:35,684 --> 00:56:37,936
Think about the relationship
between those hands.

1228
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:40,647
The game was virtually a variant
of rock-paper-scissors.

1229
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:43,859
While 999 loses against 111,
111 loses against 888.

1230
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:45,652
Then, 888 loses against 999.

1231
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:48,447
The game had a circular structure
just like rock-paper-scissors.

1232
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:50,032
- Oh, right.
- You bet it is.

1233
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:53,410
Let's come up with equations
that result in 111, 888, and 999.

1234
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:56,121
Then, we can use the ones
that use the most cards in the game.

1235
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:58,832
Round 1 will be the easiest.
Can Tae-hun and I handle it?

1236
00:56:58,916 --> 00:56:59,750
- Yes.
- Sure.

1237
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:02,085
You guys can take on Rounds 2 and 3.

1238
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:03,295
All right.

1239
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:05,172
If we stick to our game plan,

1240
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:07,299
we can win Round 1
even if we don't memorize well.

1241
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:10,677
The hands 111 and 999 can beat

1242
00:57:10,761 --> 00:57:13,305
all the other hands,

1243
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:17,893
so we decided to memorize equations
that result in 111 or 999.

1244
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:19,478
<i>In X-ray Vision Poker,</i>

1245
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:22,522
<i>the rank among the triples</i>
<i>is as shown on screen.</i>

1246
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:26,026
<i>Let us suppose</i>
<i>that your team excluded the hand 888</i>

1247
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:29,821
<i>and prepared the hands 111 and 999.</i>

1248
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,574
<i>If your opponent's hand is 888,</i>

1249
00:57:32,658 --> 00:57:34,493
<i>you can defeat them with 999.</i>

1250
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:36,787
<i>If your opponent's hand is 111,</i>

1251
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,789
<i>you can get a tie with 111.</i>

1252
00:57:39,373 --> 00:57:41,124
<i>If your opponent's hand is 999,</i>

1253
00:57:41,208 --> 00:57:44,169
<i>you can defeat them with 111.</i>

1254
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:47,089
<i>In other words, the hands 999 and 111</i>

1255
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:50,592
<i>can make sure you never lose.</i>

1256
00:57:50,676 --> 00:57:55,973
<i>But this strategy can only be utilized</i>
<i>if your team memorizes both tables.</i>

1257
00:57:58,642 --> 00:58:00,852
We need something like this, correct?

1258
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:01,979
That's good.

1259
00:58:02,062 --> 00:58:05,649
If you turn 27 into "27 times 1,"
you can use 1 more card.

1260
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:08,443
- Add that to increase the card count.
- Good idea.

1261
00:58:08,527 --> 00:58:09,903
I'll revise it like this.

1262
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:11,321
INCREASING THE MAXIMUM COINS THEY CAN BET

1263
00:58:11,405 --> 00:58:12,656
When we're out there...

1264
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:15,575
I guess I could make a phrase
like "food, AC, and deed."

1265
00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:17,786
MEMORIZING THE COORDINATES
NECESSARY FOR THE EQUATION

1266
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:19,663
- Then, the six numbers.
- That's it.

1267
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:20,747
I can do as much.

1268
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:23,375
Let's prepare equations
that would produce 111 or 999 now.

1269
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:26,378
When do we use the Update Equation card?

1270
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:27,754
<i>In X-ray Vision Poker,</i>

1271
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:31,008
<i>there is a special item</i>
<i>called the Update Equation card.</i>

1272
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:34,344
<i>This item allows you</i>
<i>to revise your equation</i>

1273
00:58:34,428 --> 00:58:38,015
<i>after checking your opponent's equation.</i>

1274
00:58:38,098 --> 00:58:41,309
3-MINUTE DEADLINE
<i>While the symbol cards are off-limits,</i>

1275
00:58:41,393 --> 00:58:44,563
<i>you can change</i>
<i>up to three coordinate cards.</i>

1276
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:49,234
<i>The Update Equation card</i>
<i>can only be used once per round.</i>

1277
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:52,279
Our initial strategy was
to use 888 at the outset.

1278
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:54,031
And if the opponent produced
a better hand,

1279
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:56,825
we would use the special item
to update our equation to secure coins.

1280
00:58:57,159 --> 00:58:59,453
To use the special item,
there should be room for update.

1281
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:04,207
What concerns me is that
the numbers could make it impossible.

1282
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:07,836
<i>While we agonized over this issue...</i>

1283
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:11,465
What if our equation is built
like a division theorem?

1284
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:14,551
We'll use a set number as the divisor
and update the quotient and remainder.

1285
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:15,719
In other words,

1286
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:18,555
we can fix one number
for the multiplication.

1287
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:21,349
A number in the 30s should be good.

1288
00:59:21,433 --> 00:59:23,685
With a number in the 30s as the divisor,

1289
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:27,272
a quotient, and a remainder?

1290
00:59:28,148 --> 00:59:31,985
Update the quotient and the remainder,
and you'll get a different result.

1291
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:34,863
- That's an excellent idea.
- Agreed.

1292
00:59:35,155 --> 00:59:38,033
<i>The numbers that work as hands</i>
<i>in X-ray Vision Poker</i>

1293
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:41,369
32: DIVISOR, 31: QUOTIENT, 7: REMAINDER
<i>can be expressed this way.</i>

1294
00:59:41,453 --> 00:59:42,996
<i>In summary,</i>

1295
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:45,999
<i>if you use a set number as the divisor</i>

1296
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:49,795
<i>and add a quotient and a remainder</i>

1297
00:59:49,878 --> 00:59:52,923
<i>so that the equations</i>
<i>would have an identical structure,</i>

1298
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:55,258
<i>you can easily change the result</i>

1299
00:59:55,342 --> 00:59:58,095
<i>by updating the quotient</i>
<i>and the remainder.</i>

1300
00:59:58,178 --> 01:00:01,014
Next is 31 times 3 plus 18...

1301
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:02,140
This first one is 888.

1302
01:00:02,224 --> 01:00:07,104
JI-MIN IS LISTING UP EQUATIONS WITH 31
EXPRESSED AS THE DIVISION THEOREM

1303
01:00:07,187 --> 01:00:08,188
This one is 999.

1304
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:10,690
We'll need a ton of numbers
to make changes.

1305
01:00:10,774 --> 01:00:12,526
You'll need to memorize loads.

1306
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:13,902
We need Team SKKU's table, too.

1307
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:15,904
This game is way too challenging.

1308
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:17,864
How about we memorize the tens place only?

1309
01:00:17,948 --> 01:00:20,784
I like it.
We can focus on the bigger numbers.

1310
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:24,746
Bigger numbers in the equation would imply
that the opponent's target was 999 or 888.

1311
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:28,041
Smaller numbers would suggest
that their target was 111.

1312
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:30,085
My memory hack was
to break Team SKKU's table

1313
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:32,170
into areas with the 10s,
the 20s, and the 30s.

1314
01:00:32,254 --> 01:00:34,589
That helped me gauge their result.

1315
01:00:34,673 --> 01:00:36,216
The first digit
gives you the general idea.

1316
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:38,051
The first digit is usually enough

1317
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:40,762
to tell if their target
is 111, 888, or 999.

1318
01:00:40,846 --> 01:00:43,723
Don't forget to memorize the ones places
in Team KAIST's table.

1319
01:00:43,807 --> 01:00:44,891
That's a given.

1320
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:47,269
When you memorize the ones places only,

1321
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:50,647
<i>you can reduce the burden of memorization.</i>

1322
01:00:51,106 --> 01:00:53,733
<i>Plus, the final digit would tell us</i>

1323
01:00:53,817 --> 01:00:58,530
<i>whether their hand was 999 or 888.</i>

1324
01:00:58,613 --> 01:01:00,824
That's why we decided to memorize
the ones place only.

1325
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:02,784
We'll split the table.
You can take the upper half.

1326
01:01:02,868 --> 01:01:04,536
- I'll take the lower half.
- Okay.

1327
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:08,206
If you find it too burdensome,

1328
01:01:08,290 --> 01:01:10,667
- tell me whenever.
- Got it.

1329
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:12,794
How are we going to place the bets?

1330
01:01:12,878 --> 01:01:15,422
Go all-in
if our hand is bigger than theirs.

1331
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:17,382
If smaller, bet one coin.

1332
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:18,842
Either maximum or minimum.

1333
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:20,468
Yeah, that's the best.

1334
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:22,929
Okay, then.

1335
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:24,931
Why don't you two play in Round 1?

1336
01:01:25,015 --> 01:01:26,850
Ji-hoo and I can take on Round 2.

1337
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:28,894
Memorization is
Ji-min and Ji-hoo's strengths,

1338
01:01:28,977 --> 01:01:32,647
but I think Jae-han will do a good job
building equations.

1339
01:01:32,731 --> 01:01:35,483
I want our stronger pair
to go win and secure a lead.

1340
01:01:35,567 --> 01:01:37,611
- How many numbers can you cover, Jae-han?
- Me?

1341
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:39,863
I honestly can't say.

1342
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:41,948
Memorization isn't your thing, is it?

1343
01:01:42,032 --> 01:01:43,867
It really isn't.

1344
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:45,410
I'm having trouble memorizing.

1345
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:47,704
<i>Jae-han was very worried,</i>

1346
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:50,582
<i>while I was quite ready to take</i>
<i>on the memorization challenge.</i>

1347
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:51,875
All right, Jae-han.

1348
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:54,878
Can you memorize the numbers
for making the equations we prepared?

1349
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:57,255
- Prioritize those special numbers.
- I'll give it a try.

1350
01:01:57,339 --> 01:01:59,799
<i>I knew I had to do whatever I could.</i>

1351
01:01:59,883 --> 01:02:03,386
If you take on our table,
you don't have to memorize that much.

1352
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:08,892
Focus on the numbers we can't do without,
like 37, 32, and 31.

1353
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:11,645
- I'll memorize Team SKKU's table. Deal?
- Deal.

1354
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:14,314
Tell me the key numbers.
Then, I'll memorize them

1355
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:16,650
after going over Team SKKU's table.

1356
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:19,402
- I'll give it a try.
- Okay.

1357
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:22,072
<i>The time for strategy meeting is up.</i>

1358
01:02:22,489 --> 01:02:25,408
- I've got a good feeling about this.
- Really? Go memorize the whole table.

1359
01:02:25,492 --> 01:02:27,911
- KAIST!
- Let's go!

1360
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:31,498
- Good luck.
- You've got this.

1361
01:02:33,208 --> 01:02:35,669
We will now begin the Deathmatch,
X-ray Vision Poker.

1362
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:39,089
In Round 1, Team SKKU's Sung Tae-hun
and Lee Dong-jae will compete

1363
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:42,592
against Team KAIST's Kim Jae-han
and Jeon Ji-min.

1364
01:02:43,677 --> 01:02:44,719
- Was it five minutes?
- What?

1365
01:02:44,803 --> 01:02:46,388
- The time for memorization.
- Yeah.

1366
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:48,807
You'll do fine. It's just 24 numbers.

1367
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:50,267
It should be enough.

1368
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:58,608
You're smart, Jae-han.
You'll probably have time to spare.

1369
01:02:58,942 --> 01:03:01,027
Let's play it safe, okay?

1370
01:03:01,361 --> 01:03:04,197
Here are your tables
for the X-ray Vision Poker.

1371
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:07,200
TEAM SKKU, TEAM KAIST

1372
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:25,176
This is brutal.

1373
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:30,265
You have one minute left.

1374
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:34,477
You have 30 seconds left.

1375
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:40,734
The time for memorization is over.

1376
01:03:41,276 --> 01:03:43,945
THE NUMBERS TURN INTO COORDINATES

1377
01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:46,781
Both teams,
please complete your equations.

1378
01:03:46,865 --> 01:03:48,950
Your three minutes start now.

1379
01:03:49,034 --> 01:03:51,578
- Dang, I can't memorize everything.
- It's all fuzzy for me.

1380
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:54,414
You need to memorize fixed numbers only.
You'll fail if you get greedy.

1381
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:56,041
I can't recall the numbers
in the top rows.

1382
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:58,543
Your three minutes start now.

1383
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:03,673
Make the equations we prepared.

1384
01:04:03,757 --> 01:04:05,759
I plan on doing that.

1385
01:04:06,718 --> 01:04:08,219
At the top, 7, 9, 8, 9, 4...

1386
01:04:08,303 --> 01:04:11,014
TEAM SKKU BUILDS EQUATIONS
THEY PREPARED IN ADVANCE

1387
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:13,266
Then, 3, 9, 3, 4, 9...

1388
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:15,060
So should I start with 888?

1389
01:04:15,143 --> 01:04:16,186
Yes, you can go first.

1390
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:20,482
Okay, here's 37, the times card, and 24.

1391
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:22,609
Then, we get 888.

1392
01:04:23,443 --> 01:04:26,988
AS PLANNED,
TEAM KAIST BUILDS THE EQUATION FOR 888

1393
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:33,036
JEON JI-MIN COMPLETES IT QUICKLY

1394
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:36,081
Tell me if you can't recall
where the necessary card is.

1395
01:04:36,164 --> 01:04:38,416
I have 11, 4, and 44.
I need the plus card.

1396
01:04:40,668 --> 01:04:42,212
Your time is up.

1397
01:04:43,254 --> 01:04:45,173
Please come to the center stage

1398
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:47,550
and place the cards on the table
one by one.

1399
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:50,261
Let's see what they came up with.

1400
01:05:03,441 --> 01:05:04,442
What on earth?

1401
01:05:07,362 --> 01:05:09,197
TEAM KAIST USED 8 CARDS
<i>Wow, so many cards.</i>

1402
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:10,407
Damn.

1403
01:05:10,949 --> 01:05:12,325
How did they manage so many?

1404
01:05:12,617 --> 01:05:14,536
They went that far?

1405
01:05:14,619 --> 01:05:17,205
Please discuss the amount to bet.

1406
01:05:17,497 --> 01:05:19,666
You'll be given two minutes.

1407
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:21,584
Hang on.

1408
01:05:21,668 --> 01:05:25,088
- The divisions make it so hard.
- What?

1409
01:05:25,171 --> 01:05:27,215
<i>We planned to determine</i>
<i>if their hand was 111</i>

1410
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:29,759
<i>using numbers in the ones place</i>
<i>as a guide.</i>

1411
01:05:29,843 --> 01:05:32,637
<i>But we hadn't considered</i>
<i>that they might use the division cards.</i>

1412
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:35,181
<i>That made it difficult for me</i>
<i>to gauge the result.</i>

1413
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:37,350
Divisions never occurred to us.

1414
01:05:38,226 --> 01:05:39,727
I can't determine the range.

1415
01:05:40,061 --> 01:05:41,855
I'd say they went with 111

1416
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:44,441
because they used
the division symbol twice.

1417
01:05:45,859 --> 01:05:48,361
TEAM SKKU

1418
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:50,905
Let's go all-in.

1419
01:05:50,989 --> 01:05:54,951
<i>I wanted to gain a huge lead</i>
<i>to grease the wheels for the team.</i>

1420
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:59,539
<i>If it's a tie, the coins</i>
<i>would be returned to each team.</i>

1421
01:05:59,914 --> 01:06:02,625
So I thought we needed to make
big bets to win.

1422
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:05,044
Let's bet eight coins, then.

1423
01:06:05,128 --> 01:06:06,588
How's five?

1424
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:08,131
- No.
- What about four?

1425
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:09,215
Four, it is.

1426
01:06:10,842 --> 01:06:13,678
Both teams, please place your bets.

1427
01:06:16,473 --> 01:06:18,266
Team SKKU bet three coins,

1428
01:06:18,349 --> 01:06:20,810
and Team KAIST bet eight coins.

1429
01:06:21,352 --> 01:06:23,730
- Why did they bet three coins?
- I don't get it, either.

1430
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:25,690
It should've been 1 or 6.

1431
01:06:25,773 --> 01:06:27,817
Maybe they weren't sure of the result?

1432
01:06:27,901 --> 01:06:30,945
I guess Team SKKU
couldn't calculate Team KAIST's hand.

1433
01:06:31,029 --> 01:06:33,323
- Oh, Team KAIST's hand?
- Yes.

1434
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:35,116
Team SKKU couldn't memorize our table.

1435
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,659
- We won 11 coins, then.
- Yes.

1436
01:06:36,743 --> 01:06:38,745
They should've bet
the minimum or the maximum.

1437
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:40,205
Three means they're not sure.

1438
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:42,916
I will now reveal both teams' results.

1439
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:48,004
DEATHMATCH
X-RAY VISION POKER

1440
01:06:53,301 --> 01:06:54,969
TEAM SKKU: 999, TEAM KAIST: 888

1441
01:06:55,053 --> 01:06:56,095
Damn it.

1442
01:06:57,847 --> 01:06:59,557
<i>I mistakenly judged</i>
<i>Team SKKU's hand as 888</i>

1443
01:06:59,641 --> 01:07:03,394
<i>because I only memorized</i>
<i>the tens place of Team SKKU's numbers.</i>

1444
01:07:03,937 --> 01:07:05,855
What a relief.

1445
01:07:09,984 --> 01:07:12,445
We won their eight coins. This is huge.

1446
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:16,074
That's a terrible blow.

1447
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:19,202
Team SKKU won with 999.

1448
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:23,039
The 11 coins will be awarded to Team SKKU.

1449
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:24,874
Just how...

1450
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:26,918
I'm sorry I missed their hand was 999.

1451
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:36,469
This is the hardest Deathmatch so far.

1452
01:07:36,553 --> 01:07:38,846
The most challenging one for sure.

1453
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:41,683
What was that Deathmatch
where Team SNU in STEM beat Team KAIST?

1454
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:43,560
Lucky 21 wasn't so bad.

1455
01:07:43,643 --> 01:07:44,561
I guess,

1456
01:07:44,644 --> 01:07:46,396
- but that was also memorization.
- Yeah.

1457
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:49,107
- But 21 and 999 are totally different.
- True.

1458
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:52,110
- This is a whole new ball game.
- You're right.

1459
01:07:52,193 --> 01:07:55,238
- Plus, this is also a mind game.
- So true.

1460
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:57,407
We will now begin the second match-up.

1461
01:07:57,615 --> 01:07:59,909
Both teams,
please complete your equations.

1462
01:08:00,451 --> 01:08:02,996
What will they make this time?
Will it be 111 or 999?

1463
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:05,415
Shoot, we're now
in the mind-reading territory.

1464
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:07,166
What do you want to do?

1465
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:09,460
- Let's focus on the mind-game.
- Sure.

1466
01:08:09,544 --> 01:08:11,629
Team KAIST doesn't know all the numbers.

1467
01:08:11,713 --> 01:08:13,965
- So their third hand...
- It wouldn't be 999, right?

1468
01:08:14,048 --> 01:08:15,466
It might not even be a triple.

1469
01:08:15,550 --> 01:08:16,759
- Right?
- Looks that way for now.

1470
01:08:16,843 --> 01:08:19,804
- We can use 111 at the end, then.
- What?

1471
01:08:19,887 --> 01:08:21,598
That will do nicely
if they can't get a triple.

1472
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:23,600
It's not easy to get a triple.
So how about it?

1473
01:08:23,683 --> 01:08:25,435
You'd think they must've memorized it all,

1474
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:27,353
but the way they're going
over the cards now...

1475
01:08:28,187 --> 01:08:29,981
- I'm so sorry to say this...
- What is it?

1476
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:31,691
I don't recall all that much.

1477
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:33,443
- It's okay.
- What's our goal now?

1478
01:08:33,526 --> 01:08:34,902
What do you have?

1479
01:08:36,237 --> 01:08:38,406
Can you tell me the numbers you remember?

1480
01:08:39,616 --> 01:08:40,825
I got 33 and 31.

1481
01:08:40,908 --> 01:08:43,036
What can we get with 33 and 31?

1482
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:45,788
We can put 33 times 31

1483
01:08:45,872 --> 01:08:47,290
before minus 24.

1484
01:08:47,373 --> 01:08:49,042
We can get 999 that way.

1485
01:08:49,917 --> 01:08:53,004
- Can you remember where 3 was?
- I can. It was next to 4.

1486
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:54,797
It's this card.

1487
01:08:54,881 --> 01:08:55,798
D3 and G1...

1488
01:08:55,882 --> 01:08:58,384
Okay, why don't we subtract these two?

1489
01:08:58,468 --> 01:08:59,552
In that case...

1490
01:09:00,094 --> 01:09:01,596
These cards together...

1491
01:09:02,055 --> 01:09:03,473
These are 33 and 31, so...

1492
01:09:03,931 --> 01:09:06,059
Do they match 999?
Good, we'll go with this.

1493
01:09:06,684 --> 01:09:08,853
Okay. Well done, kid.

1494
01:09:09,062 --> 01:09:10,605
Your time is up.

1495
01:09:10,688 --> 01:09:13,483
Both teams, please submit your cards.

1496
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:16,569
TEAM SKKU: H1 X C3 - B5 - E3 + F3 ÷ B3
TEAM KAIST: C4 X E4 - G1 - D3

1497
01:09:16,861 --> 01:09:19,364
Please discuss the amount to bet.

1498
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:20,657
Well...

1499
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:22,909
I think we can stake six coins.

1500
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:24,702
They can bet four at most.

1501
01:09:24,786 --> 01:09:26,371
Even if they won,
their total would be ten.

1502
01:09:26,454 --> 01:09:27,288
- But--
- We have 11.

1503
01:09:27,372 --> 01:09:29,582
I still want a wide margin.

1504
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:32,669
A one-point gap isn't so satisfactory.

1505
01:09:32,752 --> 01:09:35,380
Okay, then let's bet four to be safe.

1506
01:09:35,463 --> 01:09:37,590
All right. That would be for the best.

1507
01:09:38,091 --> 01:09:39,676
They have 888 or 999.

1508
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:42,470
The first 2 numbers are large.
One in the 30s, and the other in the 20s.

1509
01:09:42,887 --> 01:09:43,930
Let's try our luck.

1510
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:44,847
Bet the full amount.

1511
01:09:44,931 --> 01:09:46,015
- The maximum?
- Yeah.

1512
01:09:46,516 --> 01:09:48,476
Both teams, please place your bets.

1513
01:09:50,144 --> 01:09:53,564
Team SKKU and Team KAIST
both bet four coins each.

1514
01:09:54,232 --> 01:09:56,859
I will now reveal both teams' results.

1515
01:09:56,943 --> 01:10:00,071
TEAM SKKU: 999, TEAM KAIST: 999

1516
01:10:02,949 --> 01:10:05,451
The coins you bet will be returned to you.

1517
01:10:06,077 --> 01:10:09,455
We'll probably see
a mistake at least once.

1518
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:11,791
- Yeah, something like 998.
- Right?

1519
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:15,837
We'd see a blunder like that
at least once out of nine match-ups.

1520
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,046
I think so, too.

1521
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:20,216
- The cards get depleted, so...
- Exactly.

1522
01:10:20,299 --> 01:10:22,719
It will get more difficult
the further you go.

1523
01:10:22,802 --> 01:10:25,513
REMAINING CARDS
TEAM SKKU, TEAM KAIST

1524
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:28,391
We will now begin the third match-up.

1525
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:30,727
Both teams,
please complete your equations.

1526
01:10:31,436 --> 01:10:33,146
Your three minutes start now.

1527
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:39,485
Suppose they have
three numbers multiplied.

1528
01:10:39,569 --> 01:10:43,990
We should then assume
they prepared a large triple, right?

1529
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:45,825
We can't defeat that, can we?

1530
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:48,119
THEY ONLY HAVE THE EQUATION FOR 111
But this is all we have.

1531
01:10:48,202 --> 01:10:49,245
Let's see how it goes.

1532
01:10:49,328 --> 01:10:50,538
Let's bet one coin

1533
01:10:50,621 --> 01:10:52,999
- if they have many times cards.
- In that case, yes.

1534
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:55,376
- It's not such an irrecoverable loss.
- Sure.

1535
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:58,129
Okay, so...

1536
01:10:58,212 --> 01:10:59,672
Tell me what you remember.

1537
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:01,215
So that's 29?

1538
01:11:01,299 --> 01:11:02,925
Yes, I'm sure about that.

1539
01:11:03,384 --> 01:11:04,927
We can use 29 times...

1540
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:07,263
What do we get with 12?

1541
01:11:07,346 --> 01:11:08,890
That's 348.

1542
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:10,475
- Do you remember 15?
- I saw 16 somewhere.

1543
01:11:10,558 --> 01:11:11,768
That's 15.

1544
01:11:11,851 --> 01:11:13,853
- Which one?
- This is either 15 or 16.

1545
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:16,230
IF TEAM KAIST GETS 333, TEAM SKKU LOSES

1546
01:11:16,773 --> 01:11:19,942
Then, 348 minus 15 equals 333.

1547
01:11:20,026 --> 01:11:21,444
Good job.

1548
01:11:21,778 --> 01:11:23,196
Your time is up.

1549
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:25,156
Please submit your cards.

1550
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:28,326
TEAM SKKU: H2 X A3 + E4 - F4
TEAM KAIST: A2 X H1 - B1

1551
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:31,496
Both teams, please place your bets.

1552
01:11:33,873 --> 01:11:37,418
Team SKKU and Team KAIST
both bet one coin each.

1553
01:11:37,502 --> 01:11:39,587
I will now reveal both teams' results.

1554
01:11:40,546 --> 01:11:42,048
- What?
- Goodness.

1555
01:11:44,008 --> 01:11:45,676
Team SKKU's hand is 111,

1556
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:48,054
<i>and Team KAIST's hand is 332.</i>

1557
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:51,557
They messed up.

1558
01:11:52,016 --> 01:11:54,435
I knew we would see something like this.

1559
01:11:56,854 --> 01:11:58,940
We could've won.

1560
01:11:59,023 --> 01:12:01,275
So close.

1561
01:12:01,359 --> 01:12:02,652
See?

1562
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:04,320
We're bound to win this.

1563
01:12:04,403 --> 01:12:07,031
Ji-min is their strongest player,
and he's in Round 1.

1564
01:12:07,114 --> 01:12:09,575
I bet Ji-hoo will be shaking.

1565
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:14,330
Even Ji-min made a mistake.

1566
01:12:14,413 --> 01:12:19,210
Commit these five equations to memory.
Who says Ji-hu won't make a mistake?

1567
01:12:19,627 --> 01:12:22,505
The two coins
will be awarded to Team SKKU.

1568
01:12:23,381 --> 01:12:25,132
- Well done.
- Thanks.

1569
01:12:25,216 --> 01:12:27,218
- Good game, guys.
- Thank you.

1570
01:12:28,386 --> 01:12:29,929
If only...

1571
01:12:30,012 --> 01:12:32,807
If only we had won that 11-coin pot.

1572
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:36,143
<i>That concludes Round 1</i>
<i>of X-ray Vision Poker.</i>

1573
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:38,604
- Good job.
- You were amazing.

1574
01:12:38,688 --> 01:12:40,398
It must've been so stressful.

1575
01:12:40,481 --> 01:12:41,315
Great job.

1576
01:12:41,399 --> 01:12:43,025
We'll be using a different strategy.

1577
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:44,610
We'll memorize the whole table.

1578
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:49,407
Would it be better
if I memorized the first 20 numbers?

1579
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:52,493
And you can handle
the remaining 20 numbers.

1580
01:12:52,994 --> 01:12:54,245
- The whole thing?
- Yes.

1581
01:12:54,537 --> 01:12:55,997
- You up for it?
- I can do it.

1582
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:57,039
- Really?
- Sure.

1583
01:12:57,123 --> 01:12:58,624
- Shall we, then?
- Okay.

1584
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:01,419
Some numbers will be excluded
moving forward,

1585
01:13:01,502 --> 01:13:02,712
so we would need the whole table.

1586
01:13:03,129 --> 01:13:07,216
<i>As the range of numbers</i>
<i>goes up with each round,</i>

1587
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:09,802
<i>a few more numbers will be left out</i>
<i>on top of the multiples of five.</i>

1588
01:13:09,886 --> 01:13:10,845
8 MORE NUMBERS WILL BE REMOVED

1589
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:12,972
TEAM SKKU UPDATED THEIR STRATEGY
CONSIDERING THE EXCLUSION

1590
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:15,474
- We'll memorize the whole table.
- Good call.

1591
01:13:15,558 --> 01:13:19,061
We did okay with just the final digits
in Team KAIST's table.

1592
01:13:19,145 --> 01:13:22,023
But I think you should make a mental note
about where the larger numbers are.

1593
01:13:22,106 --> 01:13:24,025
For a rough comparison?

1594
01:13:24,108 --> 01:13:26,110
Should we just memorize the tens-places?

1595
01:13:26,193 --> 01:13:27,612
- That would work, too.
- Let's do that.

1596
01:13:27,695 --> 01:13:29,113
That might be a better choice

1597
01:13:29,196 --> 01:13:31,490
- to determine the general size.
- That's pretty important.

1598
01:13:31,908 --> 01:13:34,744
Let's do that and memorize
the 40 numbers in our table.

1599
01:13:34,827 --> 01:13:36,412
Okay, that seems to be the right choice.

1600
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:39,165
It's okay. You did well.

1601
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:40,958
- Sorry, guys.
- Don't worry.

1602
01:13:41,042 --> 01:13:42,835
I mistook their first hand as 888.

1603
01:13:42,919 --> 01:13:46,547
Our strategy is to play three
perfect rounds of rock-paper-scissors.

1604
01:13:46,631 --> 01:13:48,132
We'll only memorize ten numbers.

1605
01:13:48,215 --> 01:13:50,176
TEAM SKKU'S STRATEGY IN ROUND 1
Okay.

1606
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:51,761
I'll crush them in rock-scissors-paper.

1607
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:54,263
Once I've won three match-ups,
even Ji-hu will be helpless.

1608
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:56,307
LAST-MINUTE MEMORIZATION EFFORTS

1609
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:58,476
Way to go.

1610
01:13:58,559 --> 01:14:02,063
Three, three, seven. Two, four, eight.

1611
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:07,818
<i>Round 2 of the Deathmatch,</i>
<i>X-ray Vision Poker, will begin shortly.</i>

1612
01:14:12,865 --> 01:14:14,867
Take the upper rows.
I'll take the lower rows.

1613
01:14:15,326 --> 01:14:16,369
Hang on.

1614
01:14:19,664 --> 01:14:20,915
Let's do this.

1615
01:14:22,041 --> 01:14:23,334
It's Ji-hoo versus Ji-hu.

1616
01:14:23,417 --> 01:14:25,211
Yes, at long last.

1617
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:27,254
I can't wait.

1618
01:14:28,172 --> 01:14:30,383
Ji-hoo versus Ji-hu.

1619
01:14:31,634 --> 01:14:35,346
Here are your tables
for X-ray Vision Poker.

1620
01:14:35,638 --> 01:14:38,349
TEAM SKKU, TEAM KAIST

1621
01:14:50,027 --> 01:14:52,655
One of the key numbers is 37.
Do you see it in the tables?

1622
01:14:53,447 --> 01:14:54,865
No.

1623
01:14:55,282 --> 01:14:59,161
<i>The number 37 allows you to make</i>
<i>triples with simple multiplication.</i>

1624
01:14:59,245 --> 01:15:01,372
<i>As such, it is a highly important number.</i>

1625
01:15:02,456 --> 01:15:06,585
<i>But it has been excluded</i>
<i>from the tables for Round 2.</i>

1626
01:15:07,086 --> 01:15:08,838
I don't see 37.

1627
01:15:09,213 --> 01:15:11,632
- We don't have 37.
- Really?

1628
01:15:13,009 --> 01:15:14,719
- Hey, 37 isn't there.
- Okay.

1629
01:15:18,097 --> 01:15:19,640
Neither 13 nor 33.

1630
01:15:19,724 --> 01:15:21,475
- What?
- We don't have 13 or 33.

1631
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:24,603
<i>We memorized four equations only.</i>

1632
01:15:24,687 --> 01:15:27,898
<i>But when we saw the tables,</i>
<i>we realized we could make none of them.</i>

1633
01:15:28,274 --> 01:15:32,778
<i>I thought, "We're so screwed.</i>
<i>What do we do?"</i>

1634
01:15:33,821 --> 01:15:35,531
We still have 32, 27, and 29.

1635
01:15:35,614 --> 01:15:37,366
- What about 32, 27, and 29?
- We have them.

1636
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:39,827
- Memorize their positions.
- I see 32...

1637
01:15:40,286 --> 01:15:44,248
TEAM SKKU MEMORIZES THE WHOLE TABLE

1638
01:15:45,875 --> 01:15:47,668
- No troubles so far?
- None.

1639
01:15:50,421 --> 01:15:52,006
It's 16, 1, and 58.

1640
01:15:52,089 --> 01:15:53,716
Then, 28, 24, 27, 59, and 52.

1641
01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:55,509
Your time is up.

1642
01:15:56,135 --> 01:15:58,387
Both teams,
please complete your equations.

1643
01:15:58,471 --> 01:16:00,473
Your three minutes start now.

1644
01:16:01,432 --> 01:16:03,851
- F4 is 29?
- Yeah.

1645
01:16:03,934 --> 01:16:07,855
Wait, what is 32 times 27 plus 29?

1646
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:09,565
What's the total?

1647
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:12,568
That's 893.

1648
01:16:12,651 --> 01:16:14,111
We'd need to take out...

1649
01:16:14,779 --> 01:16:17,323
Do we know where 5 is?
The current total is 893.

1650
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:21,660
- G2 is 2, right?
- Yeah.

1651
01:16:21,744 --> 01:16:25,081
B1 is probably 3. Let's use these cards.

1652
01:16:25,748 --> 01:16:28,292
Our chances aren't so bad with 888.

1653
01:16:28,793 --> 01:16:30,294
Can we use 29 times 35?

1654
01:16:30,377 --> 01:16:31,837
But we don't have 35.

1655
01:16:31,921 --> 01:16:34,173
We have 38, though. B3 is 38.

1656
01:16:34,256 --> 01:16:35,966
What about 38 times 26?

1657
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:36,884
Do we have 26?

1658
01:16:36,967 --> 01:16:38,636
We've got 28, 24, and 27.

1659
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:39,595
Which is 27?

1660
01:16:39,678 --> 01:16:41,639
This one here.

1661
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:43,766
We'll multiply these two.

1662
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:45,059
All right. Good.

1663
01:16:45,142 --> 01:16:46,727
TEAM SKKU COMPLETED THE EQUATION

1664
01:16:47,061 --> 01:16:48,604
Your time is up.

1665
01:16:48,687 --> 01:16:50,815
Please submit the cards.

1666
01:16:52,691 --> 01:16:53,776
We need 27 next.

1667
01:16:55,903 --> 01:16:59,698
TEAM SKKU: D3 X B3 - C1 - F1
TEAM KAIST: B3 X G5 + F4 - G2 - B1

1668
01:16:59,782 --> 01:17:02,368
They used larger numbers.

1669
01:17:02,827 --> 01:17:05,579
I remember G5 being in the 20s.

1670
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:07,081
What's B3?

1671
01:17:07,164 --> 01:17:08,707
That's big. It's 40-something.

1672
01:17:09,041 --> 01:17:11,460
Let's bet the highest amount.
They can't have made 111.

1673
01:17:11,544 --> 01:17:14,213
- I'll bet four coins.
- Okay.

1674
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:17,967
Both teams, please place your bets.

1675
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:25,307
Team SKKU bet 4 coins,
and Team KAIST bet 5 coins.

1676
01:17:25,766 --> 01:17:27,852
I will now reveal both teams' results.

1677
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:28,978
What the heck?

1678
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:30,146
What's that?

1679
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:32,439
TEAM SKKU: 999, TEAM KAIST: 1320

1680
01:17:32,982 --> 01:17:34,859
What? Where did 48 come from?

1681
01:17:36,777 --> 01:17:38,988
We should've used C3.

1682
01:17:39,697 --> 01:17:40,739
Sorry.

1683
01:17:40,823 --> 01:17:42,783
C3 was 32, not B3.

1684
01:17:42,867 --> 01:17:45,744
<i>We used B3 instead of C3,</i>
<i>but I didn't get to double-check it.</i>

1685
01:17:45,828 --> 01:17:48,706
<i>In the end, that turned into an error.</i>

1686
01:17:48,789 --> 01:17:50,708
Team SKKU won.

1687
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:54,837
The nine coins
will be awarded to Team SKKU.

1688
01:17:55,296 --> 01:17:57,548
We will now begin the second match-up.

1689
01:17:57,631 --> 01:18:00,467
- Let's find numbers for 999.
- Okay, let's get to work.

1690
01:18:00,551 --> 01:18:02,011
This is 39. Let's use this.

1691
01:18:02,094 --> 01:18:03,304
What do we pair 39 with?

1692
01:18:03,596 --> 01:18:05,264
Oh, we have 28.

1693
01:18:05,347 --> 01:18:08,142
It's this one.

1694
01:18:08,225 --> 01:18:10,477
When multiplied by 28, it's 1092.

1695
01:18:10,561 --> 01:18:11,562
- It's 1092?
- Yes.

1696
01:18:11,645 --> 01:18:12,855
We need to subtract 93.

1697
01:18:13,189 --> 01:18:16,525
Where's 36? This is it.
Have you seen 3, by any chance?

1698
01:18:16,609 --> 01:18:18,068
Yes, it's here.

1699
01:18:18,152 --> 01:18:19,612
- Are we good?
- About 15...

1700
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:21,113
Yes, we need to add 15.

1701
01:18:21,197 --> 01:18:22,239
We need to add 15?

1702
01:18:23,407 --> 01:18:25,659
- We can use 9 plus 8 minus 2.
- Okay, that works.

1703
01:18:25,743 --> 01:18:27,286
- That works, right?
- Yes.

1704
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:28,454
This is it, isn't it?

1705
01:18:28,537 --> 01:18:31,123
The total of 9 plus 8 minus 2
equals 15, right?

1706
01:18:31,749 --> 01:18:34,710
- Let's go over the numbers again.
- Okay, we can do that.

1707
01:18:36,295 --> 01:18:37,588
Want to make a big bet?

1708
01:18:37,671 --> 01:18:39,632
Sure, we're going all-in.

1709
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:42,885
We're falling behind,
so our only way out is to win big.

1710
01:18:42,968 --> 01:18:45,179
Let's stake four coins, then.

1711
01:18:46,639 --> 01:18:48,807
They need to start narrowing down the gap

1712
01:18:48,891 --> 01:18:50,476
- one by one.
- Of course.

1713
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:52,895
Only then can they make
a comeback in Round 3.

1714
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:55,689
Both teams,
please come to the center stage

1715
01:18:55,773 --> 01:18:57,608
and place the cards on the table.

1716
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:14,416
TEAM SKKU USED 7 COORDINATE CARDS

1717
01:19:17,211 --> 01:19:19,296
- Could their hand be 111?
- Hang on.

1718
01:19:19,546 --> 01:19:20,506
Maybe.

1719
01:19:20,589 --> 01:19:21,757
TEAM SKKU LOSES
IF TEAM KAIST'S HAND IS 111

1720
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:23,092
We can't rule it out.

1721
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:26,595
F2 is a single-digit number.

1722
01:19:27,471 --> 01:19:28,347
Really?

1723
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:30,057
Then it might be 111.

1724
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:31,892
B5 is pretty small, too.

1725
01:19:31,976 --> 01:19:34,228
They used A5 and B5.

1726
01:19:34,311 --> 01:19:35,437
Both are small numbers.

1727
01:19:35,521 --> 01:19:37,231
They're both definitely under 20.

1728
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:39,316
Then, their hand would be 111.

1729
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:40,901
What if... Shoot.

1730
01:19:40,985 --> 01:19:41,819
What do we do?

1731
01:19:42,027 --> 01:19:44,113
Is C3 a big number?

1732
01:19:44,196 --> 01:19:45,322
TEAM SKKU ISN'T SURE OF C3

1733
01:19:49,076 --> 01:19:52,663
TEAM SKKU WILL LOSE
IF TEAM KAIST'S HAND IS INDEED 111

1734
01:19:58,335 --> 01:20:03,007
Both teams, please place your bets.

1735
01:20:04,550 --> 01:20:07,886
Team KAIST bet 4 coins,
and Team SKKU bet 2 coins.

1736
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:11,015
I guess they aren't sure.

1737
01:20:12,975 --> 01:20:15,185
Oh, please...

1738
01:20:18,772 --> 01:20:21,483
I will now reveal both teams' results.

1739
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:24,486
Team KAIST's hand is 888,

1740
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:27,281
and Team SKKU's hand is 999.

1741
01:20:28,532 --> 01:20:30,534
Team SKKU won.

1742
01:20:31,076 --> 01:20:33,787
The six coins
will be awarded to Team SKKU.

1743
01:20:41,086 --> 01:20:42,963
We will now begin the third match-up.

1744
01:20:43,047 --> 01:20:45,507
Both teams,
please complete your equations.

1745
01:20:48,469 --> 01:20:51,847
Seriously though,
unless you prepare equations early on,

1746
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:53,891
the third match-up is really tough.

1747
01:20:53,974 --> 01:20:55,809
Your memory isn't so clear.

1748
01:20:55,893 --> 01:20:59,146
Tell me all the numbers in this row.

1749
01:20:59,355 --> 01:21:00,481
This is 11.

1750
01:21:00,564 --> 01:21:02,900
- What's on F3?
- Oh, it's 12.

1751
01:21:02,983 --> 01:21:05,319
- What's on C4?
- That's 1.

1752
01:21:05,402 --> 01:21:07,363
TEAM SKKU'S MEMORY IS STILL SHARP

1753
01:21:07,738 --> 01:21:10,699
- What about this?
- D4? That's 59.

1754
01:21:10,783 --> 01:21:12,409
- What about C3?
- It's 16.

1755
01:21:12,493 --> 01:21:14,495
Yes, that's 16. I'm sure.

1756
01:21:15,329 --> 01:21:16,997
What's 59 times 18?

1757
01:21:17,081 --> 01:21:19,917
THEY NEED FLAWLESS MEMORY
AND PRECISE MENTAL MATH

1758
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,293
I know 59 times 17 is 1003.

1759
01:21:21,377 --> 01:21:22,836
Oh, I know where 17 is.

1760
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:24,213
- I need 1, Dong-yeon.
- You need 1?

1761
01:21:25,089 --> 01:21:26,465
- Let's end it here.
- Okay.

1762
01:21:27,633 --> 01:21:31,053
TEAM SKKU COMPLETED THE EQUATION

1763
01:21:31,929 --> 01:21:33,180
We have these two...

1764
01:21:33,263 --> 01:21:35,099
This should do it.

1765
01:21:35,182 --> 01:21:36,475
Which card is 1?

1766
01:21:39,603 --> 01:21:40,562
TEAM KAIST COMPLETED THE EQUATION

1767
01:21:40,646 --> 01:21:42,106
This would work.

1768
01:21:42,981 --> 01:21:46,485
Please come to the center stage
and place the cards on the table.

1769
01:21:55,869 --> 01:21:56,745
There we go.

1770
01:21:57,413 --> 01:21:59,164
E4 isn't in the 20s.

1771
01:21:59,623 --> 01:22:01,375
- A4 is on the smaller side.
- It's in the 10s.

1772
01:22:01,458 --> 01:22:03,085
I'm sure it's a smaller number.

1773
01:22:03,168 --> 01:22:04,837
E5 is in the 50s.

1774
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:07,131
Both C2 and D4 are big numbers.

1775
01:22:07,214 --> 01:22:08,799
I think D4 is...

1776
01:22:08,882 --> 01:22:11,593
If A4 is 13, the total can be 111.

1777
01:22:11,677 --> 01:22:12,970
Oh, you're right.

1778
01:22:13,053 --> 01:22:15,681
With a 50-something in there,
their equation can produce 111.

1779
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:16,765
IF SO, TEAM SKKU LOSES

1780
01:22:17,182 --> 01:22:18,517
Please let our predictions be right.

1781
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,436
Come on.

1782
01:22:20,978 --> 01:22:23,230
We need a win to turn the tables.

1783
01:22:25,732 --> 01:22:26,608
- How many?
- What?

1784
01:22:26,692 --> 01:22:28,277
How many coins do you want to bet?

1785
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:29,445
Just one.

1786
01:22:32,948 --> 01:22:34,658
Oh, please...

1787
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,035
Both teams, please place your bets.

1788
01:22:40,038 --> 01:22:42,708
Both teams bet one coin each.

1789
01:22:43,167 --> 01:22:45,169
I will now reveal both teams' results.

1790
01:22:46,712 --> 01:22:48,338
TEAM SKKU: 999, TEAM KAIST: 236

1791
01:22:49,756 --> 01:22:51,258
- The A4 was 1.
- That doesn't matter.

1792
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:55,179
They only bet 1 coin when they had 999?

1793
01:22:55,262 --> 01:22:59,349
They must've been worried
that Team KAIST could have had 111.

1794
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:03,687
Team SKKU won.

1795
01:23:04,271 --> 01:23:06,273
The two coins
will be awarded to Team SKKU.

1796
01:23:06,732 --> 01:23:08,942
Team KAIST lost every match-up.

1797
01:23:09,026 --> 01:23:11,528
- With a 30-point gap.
- What a crushing defeat.

1798
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:12,821
Hey, we're good.

1799
01:23:12,905 --> 01:23:16,325
We didn't lose
a single match-up out of six.

1800
01:23:16,408 --> 01:23:20,537
Team SNU in Medicine won't like it
when we return triumphant after all this.

1801
01:23:21,622 --> 01:23:23,415
Is making 999 a superior strategy?

1802
01:23:23,499 --> 01:23:27,252
Updating our hand
when the opponent's hand is 111 is better.

1803
01:23:27,336 --> 01:23:29,046
Looks like 999 is the safest choice.

1804
01:23:29,129 --> 01:23:31,507
Why don't we change our go-to hand to 999?

1805
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:32,424
Let's use 999.

1806
01:23:32,508 --> 01:23:34,468
I'll memorize the smaller numbers
in Team SKKU's board

1807
01:23:34,551 --> 01:23:36,637
so we can revise our equation
if their hand is 111.

1808
01:23:37,304 --> 01:23:38,972
Can you memorize the numbers
for 999 and 111?

1809
01:23:39,056 --> 01:23:41,058
Let's stick to 999 and 111 only.

1810
01:23:41,141 --> 01:23:42,309
Okay.

1811
01:23:42,601 --> 01:23:46,271
Let's make our last shot count.
We need to go big or go home later.

1812
01:23:46,730 --> 01:23:48,065
Ideally, we can get a tie.

1813
01:23:48,148 --> 01:23:49,858
And we can make that happen.

1814
01:23:50,275 --> 01:23:53,278
<i>That concludes Round 2</i>
<i>of X-ray Vision Poker.</i>

1815
01:23:54,655 --> 01:23:55,656
Welcome back.

1816
01:23:55,739 --> 01:23:58,158
- Oh, man.
- We win if we bet one coin from now on.

1817
01:23:58,242 --> 01:24:00,244
We're good as long as
we don't go crazy with the bets.

1818
01:24:00,327 --> 01:24:01,578
That's for sure.

1819
01:24:01,662 --> 01:24:03,872
We'll still do our best until the end.

1820
01:24:03,956 --> 01:24:05,040
Good luck.

1821
01:24:05,123 --> 01:24:06,166
We'll go crush them.

1822
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:07,292
Good.

1823
01:24:08,919 --> 01:24:10,671
Good work, guys.

1824
01:24:11,338 --> 01:24:12,798
- I'm sorry.
- Don't say that.

1825
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:14,049
We still did our best.

1826
01:24:14,132 --> 01:24:15,509
This may surprise you.

1827
01:24:15,592 --> 01:24:18,178
We can still make a tie.

1828
01:24:18,262 --> 01:24:20,389
You'll memorize
the smaller numbers in Team SKKU's table

1829
01:24:20,472 --> 01:24:22,849
and ones we can use with the times
or plus cards to add more cards.

1830
01:24:22,933 --> 01:24:24,935
It'd be amazing
if you could memorize two each.

1831
01:24:25,018 --> 01:24:26,937
We'll go get that tie.

1832
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:31,817
Okay, so 51, 19, 30, 51, 2, and 9.

1833
01:24:32,234 --> 01:24:37,864
<i>Round 3 of the Deathmatch,</i>
<i>X-ray Vision Poker, will begin shortly.</i>

1834
01:24:38,156 --> 01:24:39,658
- That's our cue.
- Good luck.

1835
01:24:39,950 --> 01:24:41,577
- You've got this.
- Go kill it.

1836
01:24:42,578 --> 01:24:43,662
Okay, Jae-han.

1837
01:24:43,745 --> 01:24:45,205
It's time to get that tie.

1838
01:24:45,289 --> 01:24:47,833
Let's go. We've got this.

1839
01:24:47,916 --> 01:24:48,917
Good luck.

1840
01:24:50,460 --> 01:24:51,378
Go get them!

1841
01:24:57,884 --> 01:24:59,344
All right.

1842
01:25:03,432 --> 01:25:06,393
- Target Team SKKU's smaller numbers.
- Yes, those and...

1843
01:25:06,476 --> 01:25:08,895
The numbers used in the 37 equation
and the bonus cards.

1844
01:25:08,979 --> 01:25:10,606
Memorize as many bonus cards as you can.

1845
01:25:10,689 --> 01:25:13,025
I have a lot on my plate.

1846
01:25:13,650 --> 01:25:16,778
<i>I was set on giving all I've got</i>
<i>because I didn't do so well in Round 1.</i>

1847
01:25:16,862 --> 01:25:18,822
<i>Giving up wasn't in my vocabulary.</i>

1848
01:25:20,657 --> 01:25:24,453
We will now begin Round 3
of the Deathmatch, X-ray Vision Poker.

1849
01:25:24,953 --> 01:25:27,039
Here are your tables.

1850
01:25:27,122 --> 01:25:30,876
ROUND 3 RANGE OF NUMBERS: 1-70

1851
01:25:37,215 --> 01:25:38,759
There's 7, 9, 2, 12, 16...

1852
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:41,011
So, 47, 32, 33...

1853
01:25:41,094 --> 01:25:44,014
No, 47, 32, 43, 31, and 44.

1854
01:25:49,686 --> 01:25:52,564
- We don't have 37.
- Okay.

1855
01:25:52,898 --> 01:25:54,941
- We also don't have 1.
- What? I see.

1856
01:25:55,025 --> 01:25:57,819
I covered Team KAIST's
single-digit numbers.

1857
01:25:58,236 --> 01:26:00,530
The time for memorization is over.

1858
01:26:00,822 --> 01:26:02,824
First off, we have 38 here.

1859
01:26:02,908 --> 01:26:04,910
- That's 38?
- Yes.

1860
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:06,787
We have 38, so...

1861
01:26:06,870 --> 01:26:08,372
Do we have 28?

1862
01:26:08,664 --> 01:26:10,957
- No.
- We don't have 28?

1863
01:26:11,041 --> 01:26:13,085
Then, we won't use 38.

1864
01:26:13,168 --> 01:26:14,961
Do we have something close to 33?

1865
01:26:16,463 --> 01:26:18,507
We have 22.

1866
01:26:18,757 --> 01:26:20,300
- Want to use 22?
- That's it.

1867
01:26:20,384 --> 01:26:21,510
- This card.
- Really?

1868
01:26:21,593 --> 01:26:22,511
This is 42, and that is 22.

1869
01:26:22,594 --> 01:26:24,262
- Multiply 42 by 22...
- Then...

1870
01:26:24,346 --> 01:26:25,222
Add 84 to 840...

1871
01:26:25,305 --> 01:26:27,349
Okay, it's 924.

1872
01:26:27,432 --> 01:26:28,475
What do we need now?

1873
01:26:28,558 --> 01:26:29,976
About 75, right?

1874
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:32,479
- We can use 8.
- Use 8?

1875
01:26:32,562 --> 01:26:34,064
I memorized its location.

1876
01:26:34,147 --> 01:26:35,315
Eight times...

1877
01:26:36,608 --> 01:26:39,027
- We have 9.
- All we need is 3.

1878
01:26:39,319 --> 01:26:41,863
- We have it here, actually.
- We do?

1879
01:26:42,114 --> 01:26:43,281
Let's use this, then.

1880
01:26:43,365 --> 01:26:44,366
- Like this?
- Yes.

1881
01:26:44,449 --> 01:26:47,411
TEAM SKKU'S EQUATION IS READY

1882
01:26:48,245 --> 01:26:49,746
How's 111 for the first match-up?

1883
01:26:49,996 --> 01:26:53,375
TEAM KAIST
D1 X C2 + B2 = ?

1884
01:26:53,458 --> 01:26:55,669
We have 44, and then...

1885
01:26:55,752 --> 01:26:58,255
Do you have anything
we can use as a special topping?

1886
01:26:58,338 --> 01:27:01,007
- A special topping?
- So far, we just have a bland 111.

1887
01:27:01,425 --> 01:27:04,386
You never know.
They can turn it around by betting big.

1888
01:27:04,469 --> 01:27:06,221
- Sure, they can do it.
- It's possible.

1889
01:27:06,304 --> 01:27:09,015
- You never know with the betting system.
- It can happen.

1890
01:27:09,433 --> 01:27:13,687
TEAM KAIST HAS TO ADD MORE CARDS
TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT THEY CAN BET

1891
01:27:17,274 --> 01:27:18,650
We have 3, 7, and 21.

1892
01:27:18,859 --> 01:27:21,653
That's 4. That one's 8.

1893
01:27:22,237 --> 01:27:23,238
I have 32 here.

1894
01:27:23,739 --> 01:27:25,323
Let's see.

1895
01:27:25,407 --> 01:27:27,659
I doubt we'll need this,
so I'll take this for my magic.

1896
01:27:27,993 --> 01:27:29,953
That's 61.

1897
01:27:30,036 --> 01:27:31,788
Your time is up.

1898
01:27:32,038 --> 01:27:36,418
Please come to the center stage
and place the cards on the table.

1899
01:27:43,633 --> 01:27:46,470
TEAM KAIST USED 9 COORDINATE CARDS,
THE MAXIMUM IN THEORY

1900
01:27:48,847 --> 01:27:51,767
- What do they have?
- What?

1901
01:27:51,850 --> 01:27:53,101
Are any of them small?

1902
01:27:53,185 --> 01:27:54,144
B1, C1...

1903
01:27:54,728 --> 01:27:56,354
- None of them is small.
- Really?

1904
01:27:56,438 --> 01:27:57,606
As far as I know, sure.

1905
01:27:57,689 --> 01:27:59,983
The ones used with the times card
aren't small numbers.

1906
01:28:00,275 --> 01:28:02,903
- That effectively rules out 111.
- Yeah.

1907
01:28:02,986 --> 01:28:03,945
In other words,

1908
01:28:04,029 --> 01:28:07,949
- their hand is most likely 999, correct?
- Yes.

1909
01:28:08,366 --> 01:28:09,284
Twenty...

1910
01:28:10,994 --> 01:28:12,871
- Their target is 111.
- It's not 111?

1911
01:28:12,954 --> 01:28:15,499
- I mean, that's likely 111.
- Oh, you think so?

1912
01:28:15,791 --> 01:28:17,209
Let's bet one coin.

1913
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:19,586
Both teams, please place your bets.

1914
01:28:19,669 --> 01:28:21,922
BETS ONLY 1 COIN THANKS TO THE FORESIGHT

1915
01:28:22,547 --> 01:28:24,132
Team KAIST bet nine coins,

1916
01:28:24,216 --> 01:28:26,802
and Team SKKU bet one coin.

1917
01:28:28,011 --> 01:28:30,430
- I'm dying to see the results.
- Same.

1918
01:28:31,223 --> 01:28:33,850
Regardless of the pot,
if we win this, it's over.

1919
01:28:33,934 --> 01:28:37,229
Virtually, yes.

1920
01:28:41,733 --> 01:28:44,069
I will now reveal both teams' results.

1921
01:28:44,152 --> 01:28:48,031
TEAM SKKU: 999, TEAM KAIST: 111

1922
01:28:48,281 --> 01:28:49,741
Hey, we won.

1923
01:28:54,162 --> 01:28:56,122
No sweat.

1924
01:28:56,206 --> 01:28:58,583
Props to them for building
a nine-card equation

1925
01:28:58,667 --> 01:29:00,126
in that short amount of time.

1926
01:29:00,210 --> 01:29:03,088
- Yeah, they did a fine job.
- Great work, Team KAIST.

1927
01:29:03,839 --> 01:29:06,216
Team KAIST won.

1928
01:29:06,299 --> 01:29:08,760
The ten coins
will be awarded to Team KAIST.

1929
01:29:09,261 --> 01:29:10,679
What if we get a tie?

1930
01:29:10,762 --> 01:29:12,222
- A tie?
- Yeah.

1931
01:29:12,556 --> 01:29:15,141
IF A TIE OCCURS,
THEY WILL HAVE AN EXTRA ROUND

1932
01:29:16,142 --> 01:29:19,521
Let's pull it off two more times.

1933
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:22,023
- We need to focus, all right?
- Okay.

1934
01:29:22,566 --> 01:29:23,859
We have 8 and 39...

1935
01:29:24,359 --> 01:29:26,570
We already prepared an equation for 999.

1936
01:29:27,445 --> 01:29:29,239
- What now?
- What if they get 111 again?

1937
01:29:29,322 --> 01:29:31,825
What if they get 111 again?

1938
01:29:32,158 --> 01:29:33,910
All right, then.

1939
01:29:33,994 --> 01:29:35,912
Considering what we have...

1940
01:29:36,413 --> 01:29:39,499
I think we'll have better odds with 111.

1941
01:29:39,833 --> 01:29:41,459
But can we get that?

1942
01:29:41,918 --> 01:29:45,380
- We have 7 here.
- That's 12.

1943
01:29:45,463 --> 01:29:46,631
- It's 12?
- Yes.

1944
01:29:46,715 --> 01:29:47,674
I see.

1945
01:29:47,757 --> 01:29:49,551
We have 48 now.

1946
01:29:49,885 --> 01:29:51,845
What's 48 plus 51?

1947
01:29:51,928 --> 01:29:53,263
We get 99.

1948
01:29:53,346 --> 01:29:55,807
Are we out of special ingredients
to spice things up

1949
01:29:55,891 --> 01:29:57,309
after the 3, 7, and 21 cards?

1950
01:29:57,392 --> 01:29:58,518
111 WILL LIKELY GET THEM A VICTORY

1951
01:29:58,894 --> 01:30:00,145
Want to use the special item?

1952
01:30:00,228 --> 01:30:02,105
Yes, after checking their cards.

1953
01:30:02,188 --> 01:30:03,607
All right.

1954
01:30:03,690 --> 01:30:07,068
Now, let's think
about how we can change our equation.

1955
01:30:07,527 --> 01:30:08,778
What's on A4 again?

1956
01:30:09,237 --> 01:30:10,780
- That's 14. I'm sure.
- It's 14?

1957
01:30:10,864 --> 01:30:12,282
- What about C5?
- That's 69.

1958
01:30:12,991 --> 01:30:14,326
We have 14 and 69, then.

1959
01:30:15,535 --> 01:30:20,790
THEY MUST BUILD A NEW EQUATION
WITH THE LIMITED CARDS AND FADING MEMORY

1960
01:30:21,917 --> 01:30:25,211
It's way too difficult
to go from 999 to 111.

1961
01:30:25,503 --> 01:30:27,297
Let me give it some thought.

1962
01:30:27,380 --> 01:30:29,132
We have 47 here...

1963
01:30:30,383 --> 01:30:32,093
Your time is up.

1964
01:30:32,636 --> 01:30:36,222
Please come to the center stage
and place the cards on the table.

1965
01:30:40,602 --> 01:30:43,271
EQUATIONS SUBMITTED

1966
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:44,856
- We're going all-in.
- Sure.

1967
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:46,524
That's what we'll do.

1968
01:30:46,608 --> 01:30:47,943
- Our course is set.
- Yes.

1969
01:30:48,568 --> 01:30:49,653
Do you remember them?

1970
01:30:49,736 --> 01:30:52,155
I'm not so sure about E3.

1971
01:30:52,238 --> 01:30:53,490
E3...

1972
01:30:54,658 --> 01:30:56,159
It's in the 20s.

1973
01:30:56,242 --> 01:30:57,661
E2 is 51.

1974
01:30:58,370 --> 01:31:00,956
- C1 is 69.
- What?

1975
01:31:01,039 --> 01:31:02,874
They went for 999.

1976
01:31:05,377 --> 01:31:07,295
We won't need to change anything, then.

1977
01:31:07,671 --> 01:31:09,965
Both teams, please place your bets.

1978
01:31:10,882 --> 01:31:12,384
Team KAIST bet one coin,

1979
01:31:12,467 --> 01:31:15,178
and Team SKKU bet three coins.

1980
01:31:15,553 --> 01:31:17,722
I will now reveal both teams' results.

1981
01:31:18,556 --> 01:31:21,184
Both teams have 999.

1982
01:31:23,103 --> 01:31:25,397
Oh, snap.

1983
01:31:25,647 --> 01:31:28,483
The coins you bet will be returned to you.

1984
01:31:29,109 --> 01:31:31,277
Team KAIST can't make a comeback now.

1985
01:31:31,361 --> 01:31:33,863
- Yeah, it's basically over.
- Right.

1986
01:31:34,823 --> 01:31:37,409
- Thanks for bearing with me.
- What?

1987
01:31:37,492 --> 01:31:40,120
Thanks for being chill
about my dumb jokes.

1988
01:31:40,912 --> 01:31:43,707
I've heard that one before.
You apologize whenever we get eliminated.

1989
01:31:44,124 --> 01:31:46,710
<i>The differences in the total coins</i>
<i>cannot be overcome</i>

1990
01:31:47,043 --> 01:31:50,296
<i>even if both teams bet the maximum amount.</i>

1991
01:31:50,380 --> 01:31:54,217
<i>As such, we will apply the mercy rule</i>
<i>and end the game.</i>

1992
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:55,218
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

1993
01:31:55,301 --> 01:31:56,344
- Make sure you win.
- Okay.

1994
01:31:57,053 --> 01:31:58,513
- Thank you.
- May I?

1995
01:31:58,596 --> 01:32:00,056
Of course.

1996
01:32:00,473 --> 01:32:02,684
- Good work.
- Thanks for the good game.

1997
01:32:05,353 --> 01:32:07,355
Aren't they adorable?
I'm so proud of our lovely kids.

1998
01:32:07,439 --> 01:32:08,606
They're amazing.

1999
01:32:09,107 --> 01:32:11,067
It's over.

2000
01:32:11,151 --> 01:32:14,154
Team SKKU is seriously good.

2001
01:32:14,738 --> 01:32:18,074
<i>That concludes the Deathmatch,</i>
<i>X-ray Vision Poker.</i>

2002
01:32:18,366 --> 01:32:22,162
<i>All contestants,</i>
<i>please gather at the main hall.</i>

2003
01:32:22,245 --> 01:32:25,373
Thanks, guys. You were amazing.

2004
01:32:25,790 --> 01:32:27,542
We pulled off a big one.

2005
01:32:27,876 --> 01:32:29,335
- Hey, join the group hug.
- Go on.

2006
01:32:29,419 --> 01:32:31,463
- Well done, guys.
- Good job, everyone.

2007
01:32:34,090 --> 01:32:36,801
That was definitely challenging.

2008
01:32:36,885 --> 01:32:38,845
- It was incredibly difficult.
- Hands down.

2009
01:32:38,928 --> 01:32:41,056
- Team KAIST did their best.
- Sure.

2010
01:32:41,139 --> 01:32:43,058
- The 888 earlier was a fine move, too.
- Totally.

2011
01:32:43,141 --> 01:32:45,310
I was dumbstruck
when Team KAIST pulled off

2012
01:32:45,393 --> 01:32:47,062
a 9-card equation for 111.

2013
01:32:47,562 --> 01:32:48,980
Ji-min was pretty awesome.

2014
01:32:49,230 --> 01:32:51,149
- He made the second 999, too.
- Sure.

2015
01:32:51,232 --> 01:32:53,359
It was pretty admirable

2016
01:32:53,443 --> 01:32:55,695
- how he kept fighting until the end.
- Totally.

2017
01:32:56,196 --> 01:33:01,076
<i>The final result of the Deathmatch,</i>
<i>X-ray Vision Poker, will be announced.</i>

2018
01:33:01,451 --> 01:33:04,537
<i>Team SKKU won.</i>

2019
01:33:04,621 --> 01:33:05,705
TEAM SKKU'S VICTORY

2020
01:33:11,628 --> 01:33:15,465
<i>The fourth team to be eliminated</i>
<i>from Elite League Season 3 is</i>

2021
01:33:15,965 --> 01:33:17,550
<i>Team KAIST.</i>

2022
01:33:19,636 --> 01:33:21,054
It's such a shame.

2023
01:33:22,597 --> 01:33:24,349
Ji-hoo put on the jacket
for our final moment.

2024
01:33:24,432 --> 01:33:25,934
You're so annoying.

2025
01:33:26,017 --> 01:33:27,644
I wanted to go out with a bang.

2026
01:33:27,727 --> 01:33:29,562
All alone, dude?

2027
01:33:29,813 --> 01:33:32,398
<i>Team KAIST, please exit the grounds.</i>

2028
01:33:32,482 --> 01:33:35,235
- No, we won't.
- Let's go.

2029
01:33:36,069 --> 01:33:36,903
This is it for us.

2030
01:33:40,990 --> 01:33:42,075
- Thanks.
- Good luck, Ji-hu!

2031
01:33:42,158 --> 01:33:44,202
- I'll do my best.
- Kudos, guys.

2032
01:33:44,285 --> 01:33:45,453
Best of luck to you.

2033
01:33:48,998 --> 01:33:51,084
TEAM KAIST ALONE IN THE EMPTY HALL

2034
01:33:51,376 --> 01:33:53,253
No other teams had
two elimination interviews, right?

2035
01:33:53,336 --> 01:33:55,755
It's a world record.

2036
01:33:56,297 --> 01:34:00,135
We got really close to being eliminated
multiple times on our journey.

2037
01:34:00,218 --> 01:34:01,970
All I needed was one more turn.

2038
01:34:02,053 --> 01:34:05,431
<i>We did get eliminated, actually.</i>

2039
01:34:05,723 --> 01:34:07,725
I'll go with Pixel Cards 1, 3, and 9.

2040
01:34:07,809 --> 01:34:10,812
<i>But somehow, we made it to the semifinal.</i>

2041
01:34:11,271 --> 01:34:13,731
<i>I badly wanted to advance</i>
<i>to the finals as well,</i>

2042
01:34:13,815 --> 01:34:17,819
<i>but we now have to leave</i>
<i>just one step before reaching that goal.</i>

2043
01:34:17,902 --> 01:34:20,822
<i>I can't express how sad I am.</i>

2044
01:34:21,823 --> 01:34:26,161
If I meet Ji-hoo or Ji-min on campus,
I'm going to ask them for a good meal.

2045
01:34:26,244 --> 01:34:29,122
JI-HOO AND JI-MIN ARE UPPERCLASSMEN,
JI-U IS A FELLOW FRESHMAN

2046
01:34:29,372 --> 01:34:32,167
<i>Even when we were faced</i>
<i>with a devastating situation,</i>

2047
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:34,836
<i>we stood our ground and did our best.</i>

2048
01:34:34,919 --> 01:34:35,753
<i>I have no regrets.</i>

2049
01:34:36,421 --> 01:34:40,633
<i>I'm grateful for the opportunity</i>
<i>to meet and work with such great friends.</i>

2050
01:34:40,717 --> 01:34:44,554
Signing up for this show is
probably the best decision I've ever made.

2051
01:34:48,057 --> 01:34:50,185
Before the redemption round,

2052
01:34:50,268 --> 01:34:53,855
I didn't get this emotional
even when we got eliminated.

2053
01:34:55,190 --> 01:34:57,901
<i>We spent a few more days together...</i>

2054
01:34:58,234 --> 01:35:01,029
B1 is probably 3. Let's use these cards.

2055
01:35:01,112 --> 01:35:05,992
<i>I've grown very attached to my teammates</i>
<i>along the twists and turns of our journey.</i>

2056
01:35:06,367 --> 01:35:09,913
Thank you for giving me the chance
to have such a wonderful experience

2057
01:35:09,996 --> 01:35:11,748
with the amazing people.

2058
01:35:15,251 --> 01:35:16,753
<i>When our elimination was determined,</i>

2059
01:35:16,836 --> 01:35:21,049
<i>I felt a pang of sadness</i>
<i>because that meant we would have to leave.</i>

2060
01:35:21,674 --> 01:35:24,552
<i>My teammates and I had</i>

2061
01:35:24,636 --> 01:35:28,389
<i>so many ups and downs along the way.</i>

2062
01:35:28,473 --> 01:35:30,934
<i>We're now thick as thieves.</i>

2063
01:35:31,017 --> 01:35:32,769
I'm sad that our journey has to end here.

2064
01:35:32,852 --> 01:35:34,812
<i>I wish I could've done more</i>

2065
01:35:35,396 --> 01:35:37,273
<i>to get the team to a higher place.</i>

2066
01:35:37,357 --> 01:35:39,734
I should have been reliable
as the eldest member,

2067
01:35:39,817 --> 01:35:41,319
but I'm afraid I was bumbling at times.

2068
01:35:41,402 --> 01:35:44,280
<i>Still, my teammates supported me</i>
<i>without a single complaint.</i>

2069
01:35:44,364 --> 01:35:46,115
<i>I'm very grateful to them.</i>

2070
01:35:46,574 --> 01:35:48,660
I just want to say I love them.

2071
01:35:53,248 --> 01:35:55,208
JI-U'S TEARY SOB

2072
01:35:55,291 --> 01:35:56,251
<i>Great work, guys.</i>

2073
01:35:56,834 --> 01:35:59,587
<i>This will be your worst photo here, Ji-u.</i>
<i>Put your arms around the others.</i>

2074
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:07,178
<i>And now,</i>

2075
01:36:07,262 --> 01:36:11,641
<i>we will begin the finals</i>
<i>of Elite League Season 3.</i>

2076
01:36:12,058 --> 01:36:13,685
<i>- We've got to win.</i>
<i>- Of course.</i>

2077
01:36:13,768 --> 01:36:16,020
<i>- Team SNU has to stay on top.</i>
<i>- You're right.</i>

2078
01:36:16,312 --> 01:36:18,815
<i>Team SNU held on</i>
<i>to that crown for too long.</i>

2079
01:36:18,898 --> 01:36:20,191
<i>It's about time they let it go.</i>

2080
01:36:20,275 --> 01:36:22,235
<i>Getting crowned</i>
<i>at Team SKKU's first entry.</i>

2081
01:36:22,443 --> 01:36:23,528
Are you nervous, Ji-hu?

2082
01:36:23,611 --> 01:36:24,445
No, not at all.

2083
01:36:24,529 --> 01:36:25,863
Ji-hu is unstoppable when he's relaxed.

2084
01:36:27,573 --> 01:36:29,450
<i>That's an insane speed. It makes no sense.</i>

2085
01:36:29,534 --> 01:36:31,536
- We covered that side!
- Come on, we did that.

2086
01:36:33,579 --> 01:36:35,748
<i>- That's just...</i>
<i>- That really ticked me off.</i>

2087
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:36,958
A neat takedown.

2088
01:36:37,041 --> 01:36:38,918
Let's take Ji-hu out.

2089
01:36:39,002 --> 01:36:41,921
<i>　We need to threaten the opponents.</i>
<i>"Come in here, and you could die."</i>

2090
01:36:43,464 --> 01:36:44,382
That was dope.

2091
01:36:44,924 --> 01:36:45,842
<i>You're pretty smart.</i>

2092
01:36:45,925 --> 01:36:47,552
<i>Team SNU in Medicine</i>
<i>loves outlandish moves.</i>

2093
01:36:47,635 --> 01:36:49,095
<i>- Nice and easy.</i>
<i>- We'll get that win.</i>

2094
01:36:49,178 --> 01:36:50,346
<i>That would doom us.</i>

2095
01:36:50,430 --> 01:36:51,431
<i>It's over.</i>

2096
01:36:51,514 --> 01:36:53,099
<i>One more twist until the end.</i>
