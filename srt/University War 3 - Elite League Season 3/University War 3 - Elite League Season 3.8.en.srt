00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:35,077
<i>Now that we've reached the finals,</i>
<i>we'll go home with the trophy.</i>

2
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,788
<i>We're going to thwart</i>
<i>Team SNU's three-peat bid.</i>

3
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,374
<i>You will see why the College of Medicine</i>
<i>and the School of Dentistry of SNU</i>

4
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:41,959
<i>are considered the nation's best.</i>

5
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:44,753
<i>We will defeat</i>
<i>whoever we have to go up against</i>

6
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:46,588
<i>and claim the trophy of our dreams.</i>

7
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:48,757
<i>Getting crowned</i>
<i>at Team SKKU's first entry.</i>

8
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,300
<i>We will crush Team SNU in Medicine.</i>

9
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:58,100
<i>The overall top scorer in the pre-test</i>
<i>is Team SKKU's pre-med, Kang Ji-hu.</i>

10
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,894
- Follow my lead.
- Cool.

11
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:02,354
<i>Did they have to cast a genius like him?</i>

12
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:03,438
It's not a prime.

13
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:05,399
- Nice!
- Let's go!

14
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,192
I covered Team KAIST's
single-digit numbers.

15

YOUNGEST ACE PLAYER
KANG JI-HU, TEAM SKKU

16
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,071
Just go with your intuition.

17
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,323
Gabriel is a physician.

18
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:14,366
That YouTuber is Jennifer.

19
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,868
My mind keeps gravitating to remainders.

20
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:19,204
SHARP INTUITION
SUNG TAE-HUN, TEAM SKKU

21
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:20,956
Well, how's this?

22
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,457
Did you apply it to all the samples?

23
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:23,584
It checked out so far.

24
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,919
I get it now. They're trying to avoid
losing anyone in Round 1.

25
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:27,838
PIERCING INSIGHT
LEE DONG-JAE, TEAM SKKU

26
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,256
Do we make a play for this game?

27
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,967
They used up from 0 to 12.

28
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,635
- Really?
- You have ten seconds left.

29
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:35,804
We have 38, though. B3 is 38.

30
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:37,681
- These are in the 50s.
- This is 22.

31
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:41,351
MASTER OF MEMORIZATION
KIM DONG-YEON, TEAM SKKU

32
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:44,104
We're strongest when we work together.

33
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:47,274
<i>Team SKKU's submission</i>
<i>on the culprit was correct.</i>

34
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:50,027
NEWCOMERS REACHED THE FINALS

35
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,654
BEST TEAMWORK, TEAM SKKU
I'm so freaking proud of you.

36
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:56,908
Hey, I recognize him.

37
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,410
The perfect scorer on the CSAT.

38
00:01:58,493 --> 00:01:59,911
It's Lee Seung-hyeon.

39
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:01,622
We achieved our goal,
and they took the bait.

40
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:04,082
- We have no reason to take risks.
- That's true.

41
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:07,669
We've got to so they can target us
and lower Team SKKU's point gain.

42
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:11,632
METICULOUS TACTICIAN
LEE SEUNG-HYEON, TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE

43
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:14,092
Go for it. But don't share anything.

44
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:16,219
- Let's sort out the cards.
- Agreed.

45
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:20,307
<i>Man, that's amazing.</i>

DARING CLUTCH PLAYER
HAN SEO-YEON, TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE

47
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:25,520
<i>Team SNU in Medicine succeeded</i>
<i>in mining one gold coin.</i>

48
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:27,981
What about the difference of two squares?

49
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:29,399
What a good find.

50
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,402
ALL-ROUNDER
JOO MIN-SEO, TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE

51
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:33,779
If you guys find it hard,

52
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,322
- it's worse for them.
- He's right.

53
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,323
I'll take on mining.

54
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,991
<i>I could probably last a while.</i>

55
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:43,580
We know our strategy best,
so they can't use it against us.

GAMEPLAY BASED ON PERFECT STRATEGIES

58
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:53,799
TEAM SNU VIES FOR THE CROWN
FOR 3 CONSECUTIVE YEARS

59
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:57,803
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE VS TEAM SKKU

60
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,971
<i>It's the finals at last.</i>

61
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:03,183
We'll end up on the throne
if we keep on avoiding defeat.

62
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,351
- Yeah.
- Of course.

63
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,228
- We've got this.
- You bet.

64
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:09,022
Team SNU held on
to that crown for too long.

65
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:10,357
They would feel the burden.

66
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,608
It's about time they let it go.

67
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:14,528
You can get herniated discs
with that crown.

68
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:15,821
Are you nervous, Ji-hu?

69
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:16,905
No, not at all.

70
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,615
- He's very chill today.
- I know.

71
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,535
Ji-hu is unstoppable when he's relaxed.

72
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,328
<i>Our opponents don't scare me.</i>

73
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:26,456
<i>This is it. It's the finals.</i>

74
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,500
Let's do our thing as usual.

75
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:29,793
Nice and easy.

76
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,003
Yeah, let's get that win nice and easy.

77
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:34,256
This will be our day.
Even the fortune-telling site said so.

78
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,341
It said the whole world would favor me.

79
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:39,010
Anyway, I love that we made it this far.

80
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:40,512
I'm so happy.

It's not about the prize money now.

93

I want to win for our school's honor.

94
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:23,013

<i>Team SNU in Medicine and Team SKKU,</i>

Let's do our best.

105
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:07,808
We sure will.

106
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,394
<i>The first match of the finals is...</i>

107
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:14,648
What will it be?

108
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,942
<i>...is Rainbow Chess.</i>

109
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:19,528
- What on earth is that?
- I'm puzzled, too.

110
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:20,487
What's this now?

111
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,155
I almost thought
it was "Rainbow Sequence."

112
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:24,032
- We crushed Block Connect Five.
- Sure.

113
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,159
- Let's use a similar approach.
- It's turn-based.

114
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,328
<i>In Rainbow Chess,</i>

115
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:32,415
<i>you will be presented with a 7-by-7 board.</i>

116
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:33,708
<i>To win,</i>

117
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,920
<i>you must capture</i>
<i>your opponents' four pieces first</i>

118
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:41,466
<i>or keep your piece alive</i>
<i>in the opponents' camp for four turns.</i>

119
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:45,929
<i>Both teams will be given</i>
<i>a set of seven pieces,</i>

120
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,348
<i>each in one of ROYGBIV.</i>

121
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,392
<i>You will assign a number to the pieces</i>

122
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:54,437
<i>so that the sum of the 7 numbers</i>
<i>reaches 15.</i>

123
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:58,942
<i>Please remember</i>
<i>that all numbers should be one or larger.</i>

124
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,696
<i>The number assigned to each piece</i>

125
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:06,449
<i>decides how many cells it can move</i>
<i>in a single turn.</i>

126
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,786
<i>Please write the numbers</i>
<i>on the bottom of the pieces</i>

127
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,580
<i>to keep them from your opponents' view.</i>

128
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:16,918
<i>You must observe your opponents' gameplay</i>
<i>to deduce their piece's assigned number.</i>

129
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,047
<i>When the match begins,</i>

130
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:25,135
<i>the first players will select</i>
<i>one of their pieces</i>

131
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,679
3-MINUTE DEADLINE
<i>and make a move.</i>

132
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,432
<i>The pieces can be moved</i>
<i>in one of the four directions.</i>

133
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:33,685
<i>In other words,</i>
<i>they can only be moved in a straight line</i>

134
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:36,438
<i>and never diagonally.</i>

135
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,650
<i>If your piece comes into contact</i>
<i>with your opponents' piece after the move,</i>

136
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,111
<i>the two pieces will have a match-up,</i>

137
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:48,450
<i>where the piece with a larger number</i>
<i>captures the one with a smaller number.</i>

138
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:51,453
<i>If the pieces have the same number,</i>

139
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:54,664
BOTH PIECES SURVIVE
<i>nothing will come out of the contact.</i>

140
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:57,167
<i>However, please remember that Piece 1</i>

141
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:01,212
<i>can capture the opponents' piece</i>
<i>assigned the largest number.</i>

142
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:07,469
<i>If your piece comes into contact</i>
<i>with two or more pieces of the opponents,</i>

143
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,846
<i>it will have multiple match-ups.</i>

144
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,849
<i>Please consider the example on screen.</i>

145
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,560
<i>While Piece 2 can capture Piece 1,</i>

146
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:17,854
<i>it cannot overcome Piece 7.</i>

147
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:21,358
<i>As a result,</i>
<i>only Piece 7 will remain afterward.</i>

148
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,322
WINNER DECIDED BY BEST OF 3 ROUNDS
<i>Rainbow Chess comprises 3 rounds.</i>

149
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:30,992
<i>Each round will be played</i>
<i>on a two-on-two basis.</i>

150
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:34,704
<i>Rounds 1 and 2 require different players,</i>

151
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:38,041
<i>but anyone can participate in Round 3.</i>

152
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,878
<i>Both teams,</i>
<i>please start discussing your strategies.</i>

153
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:44,798
<i>You'll be given 20 minutes.</i>

154

00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,217
With a solid strategy,

156
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,219
- we could breeze through it.
- Agreed.

157
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:52,180
The numbers will play a critical role.

158

Let's list up
all the possible combinations.

159
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,435
Shall we start with 2-2-7?

160
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,104
Right. Then, there's 2-3-6.

161
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,356
LISTING ALL COMBINATIONS
WHOSE SUM REACHES 15

162
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,273
Don't forget 2-4-5.

163
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:03,483

00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:09,114
THERE ARE 21 POSSIBLE CASES IN TOTAL

166
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:10,615

PIECES WITH NUMBERS LARGER THAN 1
<i>The trio here are all squad leaders.</i>

169
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:21,251
They won't try to move their Piece 1
past our squad leaders.

170
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,377
<i>In this setup,</i>

171
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,337
<i>any enemy Piece 1</i>
<i>will be captured in flash.</i>

172
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:25,296
<i>Sure thing.</i>

173
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:28,550
We will need
a good number of squad leaders.

174
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:32,178
SQUAD-LEADER-HEAVY SETUP
My favorite combination is 5-3-2-2-1-1-1.

175
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:33,638
I want our largest number

176
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,890
- to be bigger than six.
- Same.

177
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,267
Five is too weak.

178
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:41,312
Would it be better to use larger numbers
when we're going first?

179
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,773
THEY DECIDED THE ORDER
BEFORE THE STRATEGY MEETING

180
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,234
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE: 5, TEAM SKKU: 6

181
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,652
We would like to go first.

182
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,656
If our largest number is 5
and theirs is 6 like he suggested,

183
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,159
- it loses to both 6 and 1.
- You're right.

184
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:58,288
I'd like our largest number
to match or exceed theirs.

185
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,665
6 IS THE LARGEST POSSIBLE
So we need Piece 6?

186
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:04,210
RAINBOW CHESS
COMBINATIONS OF THE PIECES

187
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:08,381
Compared to 1-1-1-2-2-2-6,
1-1-1-1-2-3-6 is superior.

188
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:11,926
- Our Piece 3 can capture their Piece 2s.
- Of course.

189
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,555
As I said earlier,
what we need is a can't-lose strategy.

190
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,182
- We don't need a landslide win.
- Agreed.

191
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:20,518
TEAM SKKU'S CHOICE:
SECURE COMBINATION OF 6-3-2-1-1-1-1

192
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,228
Our gameplay is

193
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:25,523
to use Piece 8 to eliminate everything
that can capture our Piece 1s.

194
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:28,651
We'll use our Piece 1 as a probe
and eliminate a threat with Piece 8.

195
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,361
We'll repeat the process.

196
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:32,405
<i>With this strategy,</i>
<i>they would use Piece 1 as bait</i>

197
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:35,366
<i>to see if Team SKKU's piece</i>
<i>has a number larger than one.</i>

198
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:39,370
<i>Then, they would remove it with Piece 8</i>
<i>by leveraging its long traveling distance.</i>

199
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:41,790
If we only target pieces
that captured our Piece 1s,

200
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:43,333
- our Piece 8 should be safe.
- Sure.

201
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:47,837
With Piece 8 in our arsenal,
we won't lose any match-ups, at least.

202
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:53,384
One thing to consider is that Team SKKU
will start taking our pieces first.

203
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,845
So they can win
if they seize four pieces ahead of us.

204
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,222
We should note that possibility.

205
00:09:57,305 --> 00:10:01,184
Right. If we have too many Piece 1s,
they can use Piece 2 or Piece 3...

206
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,311
- To wipe out our Piece 1s.
- Exactly.

207
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:04,729
That's concerning.

208
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:08,650
We'll need to assess
which strategy is superior

209
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,111
between using a large number
to eliminate most of their pieces

210
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:14,823
and using numbers smaller than that
to take out their Piece 1s.

211
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:20,203
Our piece with the second-largest number
should also be able to pack a punch.

212
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,830
I'll give you an example.

213
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,874
<i>Let's say their lineup is 5-4-2-1-1-1-1</i>

214
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,044
<i>while ours is 5-2-2-2-2-1-1.</i>

215
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:31,673
<i>To take down their Piece 4,</i>
<i>we have no choice but to use Piece 5.</i>

216
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,842
<i>But I don't like the huge risk</i>

217
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:36,261
<i>of our strongest piece</i>
<i>venturing into the enemy camp.</i>

218
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:40,056
I suggest we assign large numbers
to at least two pieces.

219
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,142
How about 5-4-2-1-1-1-1?

220
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,727
TORN BETWEEN AN OFFENSIVE SETUP
AND A DEFENSIVE SETUP

221
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,688
Why don't we do trial runs?

222
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,940
We always picked up lessons
from mock games.

223
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:52,569
TEAM SKKU IS RUNNING MOCK GAMES

224
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:56,239
I wouldn't mind
sacrificing one of the squad leaders.

225
00:10:56,322 --> 00:11:00,577
I'm open to using Piece 1 as bait
to see if the opponent has Piece 6.

226
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,580
If this guy is removed,
that confirms my theory.

227
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,165
From that point onward,

228
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:08,960
the grunts can act
as our general's security detail.

229
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,545
If they give us an opening,

230
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,046
- let's get in there
- Sure.

231
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,090
even if we lose our squad leader.

232
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,508
<i>In the case shown on screen,</i>

233
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:19,929
<i>Team SKKU's piece</i>
<i>will have three match-ups at once,</i>

234
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:24,225
<i>giving the team information</i>
<i>on three of the opponents' pieces.</i>

235
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,769
- Let's avoid this formation.
- It's risky.

236
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,146
- Way too risky.
- It's a no-no.

237
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,023
Team SKKU can throw in
a couple of Piece 1s

238
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,983
- and hit the jackpot.
- Exactly.

239
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:34,319
This is a minor suggestion,

240
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:38,448
but consider placing our Piece 1s
behind our piece with the largest number.

241
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,533
Let's say our strongest is Piece 5.

242
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:42,285
Team SKKU could have Piece 6, right?

243
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,537
If Piece 5 and Piece 6 collide,
we'll lose our best piece.

244
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:46,998
But if we move our Piece 1 after that,
we can take their Piece 6.

245
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,459
- This setup might be useful.
- I see.

246
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,376
Our strongest piece...

247
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,254
I mean, about midway into the game,

248
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:56,799
we should be able to tell
whether our best piece overpowers theirs.

249
00:11:56,883 --> 00:12:00,428
If it feels like it doesn't,
we'll keep Piece 1 close by

250
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,639
to reduce the risks,
even if we lose our strongest.

251
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:06,309
<i>You have one minute left.</i>

252
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,978
- Why don't you play as a pair?
- Min-seo and me?

253
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,855
You can balance each other out.

254
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:13,316
Right, when I get fixated on details,

255
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,486
Min-seo makes good suggestions
to get me back on track.

256
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,321
THE YOUNGEST DUO WILL PLAY IN ROUND 2

257
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,572
Are you nervous?

258
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:22,450
Was that a nod?

259
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:23,701
YEAH...

260
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:25,453
Come on, relax.

261
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,330
DONG-YEON AND JI-HU WILL PLAY IN ROUND 1
Even if we lost,

262
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:30,250
- Tae-hun and Dong-jae could even it out.
- Sure.

263
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,961
<i>The time for strategy meeting is up.</i>

264
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:37,507
<i>Players competing in Round 1,</i>
<i>please come to the main hall.</i>

265
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,717
Okay, we're ready.

266
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:40,927
- Here we go.
- Let's do a chant.

267
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,428
- I have faith in you.
- We'll win.

268
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,264
- We can beat them.
- Of course.

269
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:45,556
We'll do our best. Let me know

270
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,684
- if I miss anything, Min-seok.
- We're a solid team.

271
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,311
- Take your time.
- Keep your cool, and you'll win.

272
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:51,229
One, two, three.

273
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,523
- Let's go, SNU!
- Let's go, SNU!

274
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,066
- Good luck.
- You've got this.

275
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,443
- We'll go get that win.
- All right.

276
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,624
Hello.

277
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,043
Goodness, hello.

278
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,297
In Round 1 of Rainbow Chess,

279
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,466
Team SNU in Medicine's Kim Min-seok
and Han Seo-yeon will compete...

280
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:25,805
<i>My team demonstrated great teamwork</i>
<i>and an edge in strategic analysis.</i>

281
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,391
<i>I'm ready to win Round 1</i>
<i>with a large margin</i>

282
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,852
<i>and set the tone of the match</i>
<i>in our favor.</i>

283
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:34,731
...against Team SKKU's Kim Dong-yeon
and Kang Ji-hu.

284
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,482
<i>From what we have observed so far,</i>

285
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:39,402
<i>the winner of Round 1</i>
<i>usually gained the upper hand.</i>

286
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:43,156
<i>That strengthened</i>
<i>our resolve to win Round 1.</i>

287
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,866
I hope they crush it.

288
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,367
I really want to win.

289
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:49,120
A defeat would make me angry
rather than sad.

290
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,664
It's a blow to our pride,
so it'd sour our mood.

291
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:54,709
Both teams, please place your pieces.

292
00:13:55,418 --> 00:14:00,631
EACH TEAM CAN PLACE THEIR PIECES FREELY
IN THE TWO COLUMNS CLOSEST TO THEIR SIDE

293
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:04,635
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE, TEAM SKKU

294
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:06,220
So that's what they went with.

295
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:08,556
I guess they prioritized maneuverability?

296
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,476
Suppose we went
with an initial setup like this.

297
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:14,020
If our four pieces
march forward like this,

298
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,105
- we can cover all rows.
- So true.

299
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:19,067
<i>Yes, with the zigzag formation.</i>

300
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,069
THIS LINEUP COVERS
ALL ENTRY POINTS INTO THEIR CAMP

301
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:23,571
Team SKKU will go first.

302
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,532
Please move your piece.

303
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:30,119
We should move the violet piece
to trick their violet piece into moving

304
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,288
and then take its place.

305
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:36,417
TEAM SKKU'S VIOLET PIECE MOVES 1 CELL

306
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:43,549
DEFENDS WITH THE RED PIECE

307
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:47,553
Let's veer off to avoid their red piece.

308
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:51,974
Let's send the green Piece 1 forward.
The orange Piece 6 can cover for it.

309
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:56,521
TEAM SKKU'S GREEN PIECE MOVES 1 CELL

310
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,065
Let's move the blue Piece 3 one cell

311
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:02,068
and then lodge it
between their three pieces.

312
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,111
Okay.

313
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,364
TEAM SNU ALSO TRIES
TO PENETRATE THE TRIANGULAR SETUP

314
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,449
- Okay, good.
- There we go.

315
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:11,160
If our piece can take out
just two of them,

316
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,704
that should give us a huge boost early on.

317
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:18,543
TEAM SKKU'S DEFENDS WITH THE YELLOW PIECE

318
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,044
They blocked the opening.

319
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:24,173
They could've thought letting it enter
would have been detrimental.

320
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:29,512
Let's get between
the green and the violet.

321
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,264
I think the green piece is 1.

322
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:32,598
Okay, then.

323
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,601
HAN SEO-YEON BOLDLY CHOOSES CONFRONTATION

324
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,022
Team SNU in Medicine's red piece
made contact

325
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:43,776
with Team SKKU's green and violet pieces.

326
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:47,572
<i>As a result,</i>
<i>Team SNU in Medicine's red piece</i>

327
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:50,992
<i>captured Team SKKU's green piece.</i>

328
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,035
TEAM SNU: 1, TEAM SKKU: 0

329
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,289
YOU CAN CHECK THE CAPTURED PIECE'S NUMBER

330
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,416
The contact
between Team SNU in Medicine's red piece

331
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,418
and Team SKKU's violet piece

332
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,920
THEY HAVE THE SAME NUMBER
had no repercussions.

333
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,673
- That gave them too much information.
- I know.

334
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,885
INFORMATION BOTH TEAMS GATHERED

335
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:12,930
TEAM SKKU TRIES TO CAPTURE
THE RED PIECE 2 WITH THEIR ORANGE PIECE

336
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:14,932
Team SKKU's orange piece

337
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:17,727
captured Team SNU in Medicine's red piece.

338
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:21,689
TEAM SNU: 1, TEAM SKKU: 1

339
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,279
HAN SEO-YEON MOVES THE GREEN PIECE 5 CELLS

340
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:35,912
TEAM SNU CREATED
ANOTHER DOUBLE-CONTACT SITUATION

341
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,288
Man, you're so bold.

342
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,499
That's the way to go

343
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:41,542
when we only need to claim four pieces.

344
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,711
Team SNU in Medicine's green piece

345
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:46,756
captured Team SKKU's violet piece.

346
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,549
TEAM SNU: 2, TEAM SKKU: 1

347
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:51,594
WHAT'S THE RESULT
OF THE GREEN VS ORANGE MATCH-UP?

348
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:52,970
Come on, now.

349
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:55,306
TEAM SNU CAN GAIN THE UPPER HAND
WITH A SUCCESSFUL CAPTURE

350
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,558
The contact had no repercussions.

351
00:16:57,642 --> 00:17:00,061
TEAM SNU LEARNS
TEAM SKKU'S THE LARGEST NUMBER

352
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,145
Great.

353
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:02,813
The sum of their remaining pieces is six.

354
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:05,858
Their combo would be
either 3-1-1-1 or 2-2-1-1.

355
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:09,237
- Our Piece 3 can go on a rampage.
- Yes, of course.

356
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:13,324
<i>Because the sum of the 7 numbers</i>
<i>is capped at 15 by the rule,</i>

357
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:17,119
<i>the numbers</i>
<i>on Team SKKU's remaining pieces</i>

358
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,121
<i>have to be one of the combinations</i>
<i>shown on screen.</i>

359
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:22,583
<i>The only threat</i>
<i>to Team SNU in Medicine's blue Piece 3</i>

360
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,627
<i>is Team SKKU's orange Piece 6.</i>

361
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,088
<i>The others will fall prey to Piece 3.</i>

362
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,214
We're in a great position.

363
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,424
It's time we moved our blue Piece 3.

364
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:32,552
Yes, that can take down
all their Piece 1s.

365
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:33,469
Exactly.

366
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,846
- It doesn't look good for us.
- No kidding.

367
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,975
Why don't we take out
their yellow and blue pieces?

368
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,768
Let's go get them.

369
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,064
TEAM SKKU MOVES THEIR PIECE 3 CELLS

370
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:47,149
Team SKKU's blue piece captured

371
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,402
Team SNU in Medicine's yellow piece.

372
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,946
The contact between Team SKKU's blue piece

373
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,407
and Team SNU in Medicine's blue piece

374
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,367
had no repercussions.

375
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,827
TEAM SNU: 2, TEAM SKKU: 2

376
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,453
Their blue is 3.

377
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:01,831
They have the same formation as ours.

378
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,960
TEAM SNU, TEAM SKKU

379
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,129
All we need now is two more pieces.

380
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,800
Wow, both teams
came up with the same plan.

381
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,386
- The 6-3-2 setup is by far the safest.
- For sure.

382
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:20,224
With Piece 8 in our arsenal,
we won't lose any match-ups, at least.

383
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,810
TEAM SNU CONSIDERED
8-2-1-1-1-1-1 AND 5-4-2-1-1-1-1

384
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:28,190
THEY THEN PLAYED MOCK GAMES
TO SEE WHICH SETUP WAS BETTER

385
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,026
- Both have 1 on them.
- They are 1?

386
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,279
I think 6-3-2-1-1-1-1
is the superior choice.

387
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:36,157
IN THE END, THEY CHOSE 6-3-2-1-1-1-1,
THE SAME SETUP AS TEAM SKKU

388
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,034
- It's almost a mirror image.
- Yeah.

389
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,243
We only need two more points.

390
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:41,037
We only need to capture four pieces first.

391
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:43,414
<i>Both teams had the same setup,</i>

392
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:46,042
<i>so whichever team lost</i>
<i>the second-best piece first</i>

393
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,044
<i>would be placed at a disadvantage.</i>

394
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,546
<i>So I decided to take</i>
<i>Team SKKU's Piece 3 first.</i>

395
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:57,011
- I love it. She's amazing.
- Way to go, Seo-yeon.

396
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,512
We lost our squad leader.

397
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:01,515
As a result,
Team SNU in Medicine's green piece

398
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:05,144
captured Team SKKU's blue piece.

399
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:08,773
TEAM SNU CAN SECURE VICTORY
WITH 1 MORE PIECE

400
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:11,275
Now, we need to return their favor.

401
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:14,612
If their Piece 3 takes out
our yellow or red pieces, it's over.

402
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,322
We've got to take it out.

403
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,698
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

404
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,788
TEAM SKKU TRIES TO TAKE OUT
THE BLUE PIECE 3 WITH THEIR ORANGE PIECE 6

405
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,831
Team SKKU's orange piece captured

406
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:29,085
Team SNU in Medicine's blue piece.

407
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,337
That was unavoidable.

408
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,589
<i>So each side has 6-1-1-1?</i>

409
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,549
THEY HAVE THE SAME NUMBERED PIECES

410
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,635
That leaves us with no choice

411
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,178
but to win by surviving.

412
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,221
SURVIVE 4 TURNS IN ENEMY CAMP

413
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:44,141
As long as we leave
the indigo Piece 1 in its place,

414
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:46,560
their green Piece 6
can't penetrate our camp.

415
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:50,815
TRYING TO BLOCK TEAM SNU'S PIECE 6
WITH THEIR BLUE PIECE 1

416
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,693
We have to survive
four turns in their camp.

417
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:56,153
We've got to send a Piece 1 there.

418
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:59,115
Right, their Piece 6 can't take it out.
It has to be Piece 1.

419
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,201
PIECE 6S HAVE TO STAY AWAY
FROM THE ENEMY PIECE 1S

420
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,954
TEAM SNU MOVES THE VIOLET PIECE 1 FORWARD

421
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,497
Should we send the yellow Piece 1?

422
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,833
That's our only option
to get their Piece 6 to move.

423
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,042
That's why I suggested it.

424
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:12,962
TEAM SKKU USES THEIR YELLOW PIECE 1
TO THREATEN TEAM SNU'S PIECE 6

425
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:17,758
TEAM SNU BRINGS PIECE 6 TO SAFETY

426
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,012
Let's send our red Piece 1.

427
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:28,602
BOTH TEAMS' PIECES APPROACH
EACH OTHER'S CAMP ONE CELL AT A TIME

428
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:30,980
Team SKKU, please move your piece.

429
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,566
We need to get our Piece 6 to safety.

430
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,609
Why don't we take it
all the way to the top row?

431
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:37,528
- Okay.
- You good with the idea?

432
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:42,700
MOVING THE ORANGE PIECE 6
TO THE UPPER CORNER

433
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,035
Shall we send our violet Piece 1 there?

434
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:47,455
Then, they have to move
the orange Piece 6.

435
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:49,331
Okay, let's go for it.

436
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:52,251
TEAM SNU USES THEIR VIOLET PIECE 1
TO THREATEN TEAM SKKU'S PIECE 6

437
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:56,172
We can draw their violet piece
further into their camp with our Piece 6.

438
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,923
- Then...
- Let's lure it.

439
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:03,554
THEIR GOAL IS TO LURE THE VIOLET PIECE 1
AWAY FROM TEAM SKKU'S CAMP

440
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:07,224
We can take Piece 6
close to the violet Piece 1.

441
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:09,977
That would corner their orange piece.

442
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:11,228
Okay.

443
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:14,899
TEAM SNU'S GOAL IS TO BLOCK
THE ORANGE PIECE 6'S ESCAPE ROUTES

444
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:18,152
Yes, they cut it off!

445
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,196
Our general has to run.

446
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,281
One, two, three, four...

447
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,160
There is no way out.

448
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:30,664
ORANGE PIECE 6 WILL BE CAPTURED
IF IT GOES INTO THE RED ZONE

449
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:32,333
TEAM SNU: 3, TEAM SKKU: 3

450
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,793
You have one minute left.

451
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:35,711
WHEN CAPTURED, IT WILL END THE GAME

452
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,756
Let's move it down one cell.

453
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,217
- That's the only option, right?
- Yeah.

454
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,929
IN THE END,
THEY MOVE THE PIECE DOWN 1 CELL

455
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,520
ORANGE PIECE 1 WILL CAPTURE IT
IF IT GOES INTO THE RED ZONE

456
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:55,564
Let's move it 2 cells down
and 4 cells toward home.

457
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,233
That's our only way out.

458
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:00,778
TEAM SKKU TRIES TO TAKE
THE ORANGE PIECE 6 OUT OF HARM'S WAY

459
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:07,368
<i>Team SKKU responded</i>
<i>just as we thought they would.</i>

460
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:11,831
<i>That gave me the confidence</i>
<i>that we would win.</i>

461
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:15,960
MOMENTS AGO, DURING TEAM SNU'S TURN

462
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:18,879
Okay, I see it now.

463
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:20,589
If we move our indigo Piece 1 here,

464
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:24,051
they can only take
their orange Piece 6 to this point, right?

465
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:25,553
Let's say we move the violet piece.

466
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:26,887
Won't that force them to back off?

467
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:29,098
- That opens the way for our violet piece.
- Great.

468
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:33,435
HAN SEO-YEON FORCED TEAM SKKU'S HAND
TO MOVE THEIR ORANGE PIECE 6

469
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:37,314
Okay, it's as good as won.

470
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:40,442
<i>Because Team SKKU had to use</i>
<i>their turn to move their orange piece,</i>

471
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:43,612
<i>they cannot prevent</i>
<i>Team SNU in Medicine's violet piece</i>

472
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:45,364
<i>from moving into their camp.</i>

473
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:50,035
- We can't make a comeback now. We lost.
- I know. It's over.

474
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,415
They can't keep that away.

475
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:55,958
You're pretty smart.

476
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,668
Our strategy worked out well.

477
00:22:58,002 --> 00:23:01,839
<i>I was amazed at their skills</i>
<i>and deeply disappointed at the same time.</i>

478
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:06,677
TEAM SKKU RELUCTANTLY MOVES
THEIR ORANGE PIECE 6

479
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:14,393
TEAM SNU WINS IF THE PIECE LASTS 4 TURNS

480
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,520
Team SKKU, please move your piece.

481
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:27,406
Seo-yeon and Min-seok had to go second,
but they initiated the fight and won.

482
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:30,659
- Yes, because of the order--
- They would've lost otherwise.

483
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:35,331
TEAM SNU MAKES THEIR FINAL MOVE

484
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:40,294
As Team SNU in Medicine's violet piece
survived four turns in Team SKKU's camp,

485
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:43,672
Round 1 ends
with Team SNU in Medicine's victory.

486
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:45,758
She'll finally forgive herself
for losing Block Connect Five.

487
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,639
What a shame.

488
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,016
Thank you for the good game.

489
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,354
Both teams, please prepare for Round 2.

490
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:03,025
- Great job.
- That was insane.

491
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,860
I'm so relieved, guys.

492
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:07,237
Let's think about the formation
they would use next.

493
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:09,406
- All right.
- I think they found 6-3-2-1-1-1-1 good...

494
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:11,784
Yes, that's probably
why they used it, too.

495
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:14,119
Shouldn't we reuse the formation?

496
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,666
- What a close game.
- Well done.

497
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:21,126
We should've gone with a better formation.

498
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,545
I think they will reuse the initial setup.

499
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:25,005
The formation had a part in it,

500
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:28,801
but we moved our orange piece forward
to take out their Piece 3.

501
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,179
<i>That's how they found out</i>
<i>that it was Piece 6.</i>

502
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:34,306
I think things went downhill from there.

503
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:37,309
We were going first,
but they somehow got the upper hand.

504
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:39,603
Was it because they found out
the orange piece was Piece 6?

505
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:41,689
<i>They snuck in their piece</i>
<i>between our Piece 1 and Piece 2.</i>

506
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:44,274
<i>- So they took a gamble?</i>
<i>- Yes, they captured our Piece 1.</i>

507
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:45,776
THIS IS THE MOMENT TEAM SNU TOOK OVER

508
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:48,904
- Damn, we needed the first round.
- It's a shame.

509
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:51,365
As for the formation,

510
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:55,202
I think the front-heavy version
is better than the zigzag one.

511
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:58,998
<i>Let's surround Piece 6</i>
<i>with 1 squad leader and 1 grunt.</i>

512
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:00,457
SAME NUMBERS, NEW FORMATION

513
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:03,877
Let's discuss the formation.
Does anyone have a suggestion?

514
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,379
Leave this point open.

515
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:08,882
It wasn't so comfortable
having the road blocked in Round 1.

516
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:10,801
Then, like this?

517
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,636
<i>Let's roll with this.</i>

518
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,013
TEAM SNU'S FORMATION IN ROUND 2

519
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:15,681
Let's finish it off with another win.

520
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,182
We'll go wrap it up.

521
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:18,851
Good luck, guys.

522
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:21,562
<i>The time for strategy meeting is up.</i>

523
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:23,105
- Don't get nervous.
- One, two, three.

524
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,149
- SKKU!
- SKKU!

525
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,027
Good luck. I have faith in you.

526
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:30,362
- Let's go, SNU!
- Let's go, SNU!

527
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:34,283
RAINBOW CHESS
ROUND 2

528
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:39,705
Let's do our best.

529
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:40,956
- Good luck.
- Sure.

530
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,583
May the best players win.

531
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:45,002
As Team SKKU lost Round 1,

532
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,379
their players will decide
which team goes first.

533
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,381
- We'll go first.
- We'll go first.

534
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:53,093
Team SKKU will go first.

535
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:55,471
Both teams, please place your pieces.

536
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:02,269
TEAM SNU, TEAM SKKU

537
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:03,687
So that's their new setup?

538
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:05,564
They made similar revisions.

539
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,316
So that's their new lineup?

540
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,859
What a daring decision.

541
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:11,612
Their formation is pretty striking.

542
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:14,031
Team SKKU will go first.

543
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:16,575
Please move your piece.

544
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,912
I think we should go
with the red or the violet Piece 1.

545
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,914
But I can't decide between the two.

546
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,126
- The red one.
- You have one minute left.

547
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,921
TEAM SKKU MOVES THE RED PIECE 1 FORWARD

548
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,714
They're inviting us to fight them.

549
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:33,550
- We have no reason to engage with them.
- How about the green Piece 1?

550
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:35,677
- Let's move that one.
- Okay.

551
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:38,764
ADVANCING THE GREEN PIECE 1 FOR DEFENSE

552
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,809
I think their indigo piece has 6 on it.

553
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:44,686
It's probably shielded by Piece 1s nearby.

554
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,022
- That's the vibe I'm getting.
- I see.

555
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:48,774
Why don't we advance our orange piece?

556
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,026
<i>The number on Team SKKU's orange piece</i>

557
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,569
<i>is none other than 3.</i>

558
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:56,365
<i>They plan to move it forward</i>
<i>to maintain the front line</i>

559
00:26:56,448 --> 00:27:00,202
<i>and attack the pieces</i>
<i>that likely have number 1 on them.</i>

560
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:03,413
Let's use the orange Piece 3.

561
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:05,958
TEAM SKKU ADVANCES THE ORANGE PIECE 3

562
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,126
That should be fine.

563
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,588
Let's use the indigo piece
to check their number.

564
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:13,924
If they send a piece
to pounce on our Piece 1,

565
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:15,843
that means their piece isn't Piece 1.

566
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:18,512
We can then take it out with our Piece 6.

567
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:22,266
MOVING THE INDIGO PIECE 1 AS A BAIT

568
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,518
Do you think they'll be on offense again?

569
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:27,604
If our pieces were arranged like that,

570
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:30,315
they might send in their blue piece
if it is Piece 3.

571
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:38,615
TEAM SNU DECIDES TO MOVE
THEIR VIOLET PIECE INSTEAD OF THE BLUE ONE

572
00:27:47,124 --> 00:27:49,626
The violet or the blue piece
seems like a big number, right?

573
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:53,922
They must've chosen the violet piece
to hold back our indigo Piece 1.

574
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,717
Why don't we advance our blue piece?

575
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,510
- Let's do that.
- You're fine with that?

576
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:00,470
REMOVING THE CHANCE OF DOUBLE CONTACT

577
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:14,359
BOTH TEAMS ARE ON DEFENSE

578
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,487
Team SNU in Medicine,
please move your piece.

579
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:19,740
All pieces will likely meet in the center.

580
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:20,699
Probably.

581
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:23,202
Both sides are being super cautious.

582
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:25,495
- Both teams are on the careful side.
- Yeah.

583
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:28,749
Team SKKU, please move your piece.

584
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,960
Do we press forward with the red Piece 1?

585
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:34,671
Hang on.

586
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,299
No, we can't do that.

587
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,926
If their red piece is Piece 3,

588
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:43,138
they would capture our Piece 1
and leave us helpless.

589
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:47,476
TEAM SKKU MOVES THEIR RED PIECE 1 BACK

590
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,645
I guess they want to play it very safe.

591
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:54,733
AS THE STANDOFF CONTINUES,
NEITHER SIDE HAS INTEL ON THE OTHER

592
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,448
LEE SEUNG-HYEON INITIATES AN ATTACK
The two pieces made contact.

593
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:04,952
- That's the Piece 3--
- It'd win.

594
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:07,162
In most cases, yes.

595
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:10,707
IF TEAM SNU'S RED PIECE CAPTURES IT,
IT IS LIKELY THEIR STRONGEST

596
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:13,252
Team SKKU's orange piece

597
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:16,755
captured Team SNU in Medicine's red piece.

598
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:20,384
TEAM SNU'S RED PIECE
TURNED OUT TO BE PIECE 2

599
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:22,594
TEAM SNU: 0, TEAM SKKU: 1

600
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:26,890
<i>It did cost us a piece,</i>
<i>but the sacrifice was worth it</i>

601
00:29:26,974 --> 00:29:29,351
<i>as it taught us</i>
<i>their second-largest number.</i>

602
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:32,479
Their orange piece
has either 3 or 4 on it.

603
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:34,398
Let's pull our green piece back.

604
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:38,318
TEAM SKKU IS PLAYING A DEFENSIVE GAME

605
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:39,736
- They're doing well.
- Yeah.

606
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,655
They're luring Team SNU in

607
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:43,865
- by pulling the green piece back.
- Right.

608
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:45,742
Let's push forward.

609
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:55,377
LEE SEUNG-HYEON MOVES THE PIECE
5 CELLS TO ATTACK

610
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,421
Both teams' pieces came into contact.

611
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:02,551
<i>I was thrown off by their daring moves.</i>

612
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:03,927
As a result...

613
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:05,929
Their orange piece must have six on it.

614
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:07,264
For sure.

615
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:09,349
Team SNU in Medicine's orange piece

616
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:11,893
captured Team SKKU's orange piece.

617
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:13,603
TEAM SNU: 1, TEAM SKKU: 1

618
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:15,480
We should've blocked its path.

619
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:17,774
I know. It's a shame we missed that.

620
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:19,776
What does it say?

621
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,195
TEAM SNU CONFIRMS THE NUMBER 3
ON TEAM SKKU'S ORANGE PIECE

622
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:24,531
It's safe to assume they used

623
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:27,367
- the same numbers from Round 1.
- Sure.

624
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:29,870
TEAM SKKU'S COMBINATION IDENTIFIED

625
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:32,873
<i>I thought we secured the high ground</i>
<i>with that knowledge.</i>

626
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:43,383
TEAM SKKU MOVES THEIR YELLOW PIECE 1

627
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:45,802
- We need to pull it back.
- Let's retreat.

628
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:47,971
You have one minute left.

629
00:30:48,055 --> 00:30:50,599
MOVES THE ORANGE PIECE 5 CELLS TO SAFETY

630
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,354
That orange piece must be 6.

631
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:57,898
I bet they used the same setup as earlier.

632
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:08,492
NEW INFORMATION MADE BOTH TEAMS
TREAD MORE CAREFULLY

633
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:13,497
Team SNU in Medicine,
please move your piece.

634
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,956
You can take care of it.

635
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:23,340
Team SNU in Medicine's blue piece

636
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:26,718
made contact
with Team SKKU's indigo piece.

637
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:28,053
As a result...

638
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:33,600
Team SNU in Medicine's blue piece

639
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:36,395
captured Team SKKU's indigo piece.

640
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:39,648
TEAM SNU: 2, TEAM SKKU: 1

641
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:42,359
- An eye for an eye?
- Return the favor.

642
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:45,570
TEAM SKKU MOVES A PIECE 4 CELLS TO ATTACK

643
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,572
We get the upper hand there.

644
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:49,324
That must be their strongest piece.

645
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:51,535
Team SKKU's green piece captured

646
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:54,830
Team SNU in Medicine's blue piece.

647
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,374
TEAM SKKU TOOK OUT THE BLUE PIECE 2

648
00:31:57,457 --> 00:32:00,544
BOTH TEAMS NOW KNOW
WHERE THE OTHER'S STRONGEST PIECE IS

649
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:03,713
TEAM SNU: 2, TEAM SKKU: 2

650
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:06,967
LEE SEUNG-HYEON PLACES
THE STRONGEST PIECE IN THE ENEMY CAMP

651
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,386
Team SKKU, please move your piece.

652
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,430
That's tricky to counter.

653
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:13,056
But our guys can force it out.

654
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:14,349
One.

655
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:17,310
Two.

656
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:19,896
Three.

657
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:23,400
TEAM SNU'S ORANGE PIECE HAS TO FLEE
BEFORE THE 4TH TURN

658
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:24,860
Yes, we can force it away.

659
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:35,537
- Why don't we use our green piece...
- Block their way with it?

660
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,622
We should approach from below.

661
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:41,168
- Green from below, and violet from above?
- Yeah.

662
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:43,712
CROWD THE TARGET WITH PIECE 6
AND CAPTURE IT WITH THE VIOLET PIECE 1

663
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:45,630
Okay, let's roll.

664
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,929
Team SKKU's green piece made contact

665
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:55,932
with Team SNU in Medicine's orange piece.

666
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:57,267
As a result...

667
00:32:58,602 --> 00:33:00,854
They have the same number anyway.

668
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,772
...Team SNU in Medicine's orange piece

669
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:05,525
captured Team SKKU's green piece.

670
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:08,612
What?

671
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:10,572
They had Piece 7?

672
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:14,409
TEAM SNU'S STRONGEST PIECE
HAD NUMBER 7 ON IT, NOT NUMBER 6

673
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:15,785
Okay, the round is ours.

674
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:17,704
- That puts us a mile ahead of them.
- You bet.

675
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:19,247
<i>It's the triumph of good planning.</i>

676
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:22,584
The setup we considered using initially

677
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,586
was the 6-3-2-1-1-1-1 combination.

678
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:27,047
It seemed like the safest choice.

679
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:29,174
AFTER ROUND 1
I think they found 6-3-2-1-1-1-1 good...

680
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:31,510
Yes, that's probably
why they used it, too.

681
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:33,637
Shouldn't we reuse the formation?

682
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,515
While it might not be the safest,

683
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:38,183
the 7-2-2-1-1-1-1 setup opened up

684
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,936
the chance of attacking
Team SKKU's strongest piece,

685
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:45,315
which would incapacitate that piece.

686
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:50,445
Basically, the new combination
could counter the tried-and-true one.

687
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:52,948
We'll be fine once their Piece 3 is out.

688
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:56,535
If you compare the alternatives,
the main difference is the Piece 3.

689
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:58,745
We win if we take out
their Piece 3 with our Piece 7.

690
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:00,497
Okay, let's use the new setup.

691
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,375
A BOLD SWITCH TO THE NEW COMBINATION

692
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:08,004
LEE SEUNG-HYEON USED THE PIECE 7
TO REMOVE TEAM SKKU'S PIECE 3 AS PLANNED

693
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:13,218
THE PIECE 3 IN THE LINEUP CONVINCED HIM
THAT TEAM SKKU REUSED THE SETUP

694
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:15,387
<i>Once we were sure</i>
<i>that Team SKKU reused the setup,</i>

695
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,389
<i>we wanted to trick them</i>
<i>into believing the same thing.</i>

696
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,392
<i>So I tried to present</i>
<i>our Piece 7 as Piece 6.</i>

697
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:24,896
TEAM SNU HAS LIMITED
THEIR PIECE 7'S TRAVEL DISTANCE

698
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:28,358
TO 6 CELLS OR LESS

699
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,695
TEAM SKKU FELL FOR THE RUSE

700
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:32,904
TEAM SNU: 3, TEAM SKKU: 2

701
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:34,739
- We didn't see this coming.
- That was...

702
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:35,740
- Yeah, we lost.
- Sure.

703
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:37,367
- Seriously...
- That was dope.

704
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:39,452
TEAM SKKU LOST THEIR STRONGEST PIECE
Damn, they're good.

705
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:42,664
TAKING THE YELLOW PIECE 1
AWAY FROM TEAM SKKU'S BLUE PIECE 2

706
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:44,249
What can we do now?

707
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,086
<i>Team SKKU's blue Piece 2</i>
<i>can travel within the red area,</i>

708
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,130
<i>which can be covered</i>
<i>by Team SNU in Medicine's Piece 7.</i>

709
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:53,174
<i>As such, the blue Piece 2</i>
<i>cannot avoid being captured.</i>

710
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,852
Team SNU in Medicine's orange piece

711
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,438
captured Team SKKU's blue piece.

712
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,818
Round 2 ends
with Team SNU in Medicine's victory.

713
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:13,111
Seriously...

714
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:15,280
<i>That concludes Rainbow Chess,</i>

715
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:18,283
<i>the first match of the finals.</i>

716
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:21,077
Man, I never imagined
they had Piece 7 up their sleeve.

717
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:24,372
- The 7-2-2 combo was a possibility.
- That never occurred to me.

718
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:26,124
Team SNU in Medicine
loves outlandish moves.

719
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:27,459
Great job keeping it secret.

720
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,961
They never thought we'd have Piece 7.

721
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:32,589
What's more,
I kept it secret until the end.

722
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:34,674
- I only moved it six cells at most.
- So true.

723
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:37,469
- It's a Deathmatch next.
- Damn straight.

724
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:40,513
The one where we're the only participants.

725
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:41,723
Good point.

726
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,516
<i>It's a shame we lost the first match...</i>

727
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:47,103
<i>But we'll make sure to win the next one</i>
<i>to take it back to square one.</i>

728
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:50,732
<i>Considering the landslide victory</i>
<i>we had in the first game...</i>

729
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:54,736
<i>I think the next match</i>
<i>should also be smooth sailing.</i>

730
00:35:55,028 --> 00:35:57,364
<i>Brainpower survival challenge,</i>
<i>Elite League Season 3.</i>

731
00:35:57,447 --> 00:35:58,531
<i>The finals.</i>

732
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,368
<i>The current score is 1-0,</i>

733
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:04,621
<i>with Team SNU in Medicine leading.</i>

734
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:08,625
<i>Brainpower survival challenge,</i>
<i>Elite League Season 3.</i>

735
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:13,880
<i>The second match of the finals</i>
<i>will now begin.</i>

736
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:16,800
What would it be?

737
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:20,178
<i>The second match of the finals is...</i>

738
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:27,352
<i>Equation Death Note.</i>

739
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:29,020
- Great.
- Equations.

740
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:31,106
- It covers equations.
- Yes, equations!

741
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:34,609
<i>I thought, "Our road to victory</i>
<i>won't be so bumpy after all."</i>

742
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,319
Why do they look delighted?

743
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:38,154
- They have no reason to be excited.
- Right?

744
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:41,449
<i>Equation formulation was the area</i>
<i>that we felt most confident in.</i>

745
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,827
<i>It was the game we had been waiting for.</i>

746
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,204
<i>I thought we were going to crush it</i>
<i>no matter what.</i>

747
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,415
<i>In Equation Death Note,</i>

748
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:50,583
<i>you will be given cards</i>
<i>with numbers and symbols</i>

749
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:52,711
<i>to create an equation</i>
<i>that produces the target number.</i>

750
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:57,215
<i>Your task is to eliminate</i>
<i>all contestants of the opposing team.</i>

751
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:58,633
"Death Note"?

752
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:00,677
This sounds interesting.

753
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,803
<i>Before the game begins,</i>

754
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:07,267
<i>both teams will use 2 sets of cards</i>
<i>with numbers ranging from 1 to 6</i>

755
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:10,395
<i>to assign a 3-digit code to all 4 members.</i>

756
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:13,440
<i>The digits in each code</i>
<i>must be arranged in ascending order,</i>

757
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:17,569
<i>and no two members</i>
<i>may have identical codes.</i>

758
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:19,863
<i>When the target number is revealed...</i>

759
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:20,780
TARGET NUMBER: 129

760
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:24,909
<i>...use the assigned cards with numbers</i>
<i>and symbols to make an equation</i>

761
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,662
<i>that produces the target number.</i>

762
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:31,124
<i>Then, you will be given a chance</i>
<i>to take a shot at one of your opponents.</i>

763
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:35,295
<i>But make sure that you have</i>
<i>the cards to match your target's code.</i>

764
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,046
<i>Only then can you attack them.</i>

765
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,383
We should use the fewest cards possible.

766
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:43,928
<i>Each contestant</i>
<i>will be assigned two lives.</i>

767
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:47,348
<i>When you lose both,</i>
<i>you will be eliminated from the game.</i>

768
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:49,476
<i>Once you're eliminated,</i>

769
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:53,605
<i>you cannot participate</i>
<i>in equation formulation.</i>

770
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:57,025
What? That's a tough blow.

771
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:00,069
<i>Both teams,</i>
<i>please start discussing your strategies.</i>

772
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:03,323
<i>You'll be given 20 minutes.</i>

773
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:05,825
Before we assign the code,
why don't we try a few trial runs?

774
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:07,660
- Trial runs?
- I mean...

775
00:38:07,744 --> 00:38:09,662
- Making equations for random numbers.
- Okay.

776
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:11,372
How's 4762?

777
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,707
What, 4762?

778
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,793
TARGET NUMBER: 4762

779
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:16,085
Seven hundred...

780
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:17,253
Two hundred...

781
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:23,384
I have the equation. This is it.

782
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:25,512
- You have it ready?
- Yes, this is it.

783
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:28,306
You see, 69 squared is 4761.

784
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:31,643
<i>So I wanted to add one to it.</i>

785
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,603
<i>That meant I had to come up with 69.</i>

786
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:39,567
EQUATION COMPLETED
USING ONLY THE AVAILABLE NUMBERS

787
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:41,903
I didn't know 69 squared
off the top of my head.

788
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,822
It'd definitely help
to have some numbers memorized.

789
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:45,114
You're so fast, anyway.

790
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:47,242
It'd boil down
to who can use exponents better.

791
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:51,454
We definitely need Ji-hu to survive
because he knows a lot of exponents.

792
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:52,789
He can be our equation guy.

793
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:54,457
This game was built for you.

794
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,794
Never exclaim
when Ji-hu finishes an equation.

795
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:00,588
That would tip them off
that he's making our equations.

796
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,715
They will then
try to take him out at all costs.

797
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:03,800
Okay, then.

798
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:06,636
Why don't I hand you my note
so you can put up the cards?

799
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:07,720
Here's an idea.

800
00:39:07,804 --> 00:39:09,931
I could exclaim
like I just finished an equation.

801
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,474
We could trick them that way.

802
00:39:11,558 --> 00:39:12,934
Okay, I like the idea.

803
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:17,730
I say we go for it
and keep on making equations.

804
00:39:17,814 --> 00:39:20,608
Especially early on.
Don't hesitate, and just keep at it.

805
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:22,485
Even if we can't take anyone out,
just brush it off.

806
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:25,572
It would be disappointing, but it's better
than getting our lives docked.

807
00:39:25,655 --> 00:39:26,489
Exactly.

808
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,700
Suppose we have the equation
ready on the board first.

809
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:30,577
Do we wait
until they start sifting the cards?

810
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:33,580
- Do we hit the buzzer then?
- Exactly.

811
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:37,458
We can then use that extra time
to tweak the equation.

812
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:40,503
Let's say we had 5 plus 5 initially.

813
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:43,631
But if we need 5 to take a shot,
we can revise that to 5 times 2.

814
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:45,800
Let's work out our codes.

815
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:47,135
Which numbers did you use the most?

816
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,887
I used five a lot.

817
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:51,180
- Same here.
- You need it everywhere.

818
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:53,433
- So 5 and 2 are important.
- Right.

819
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:57,270
ON THE OTHER HAND,
1 AND 4 WERE THE LEAST USED NUMBERS

820
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:59,939
- Let's assign two to you.
- Okay.

821
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,859
SEUNG-HYEON IS ASSIGNED CODE 122,
A HARD ONE TO CRACK

822
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,068
I've got this.

823
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,446
We need two pretty often, no?

824
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:08,323
For the squared numbers, sure.

825
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:11,242
- Let's assign 22 to you instead of 66.
- How does 226 sound?

826
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:12,660
Let's give you 226.

827
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:14,746
<i>Because we expected Ji-hu</i>
<i>to be our best player,</i>

828
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:17,790
<i>we used the key numbers</i>
<i>in his code for protection.</i>

829
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:19,500
Don't get stressed.

830
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:21,044
This is what we're best at.

831
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:23,671
Exactly, this is the game
we've been waiting for.

832
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:25,298
You can say that again.

833
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:27,967
This is what Ji-hu excels in.
The game is ours.

834
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,053
Let's place our name tags together.

835
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:31,179
We've got this.

836
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,764
- Let's go.
- Good luck.

837
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:35,975
KIM DONG-YEON, SUNG TAE-HUN,
LEE DONG-JAE, KANG JI-HU

838
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:38,728
<i>The time for strategy meeting is up.</i>

839
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:42,231
<i>Both teams, please gather at the main hall</i>

840
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:44,859
<i>for the second match of the finals.</i>

841
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:47,070
We've got this.

842
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:49,822
- It's a no-brainer. We're good at this.
- Of course.

843
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,075
- Let's go, SNU!
- Let's go, SNU!

844
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:53,409
We're going to win.

845
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,703
- SKKU!
- SKKU!

846
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,835
FINALS
EQUATION DEATH NOTE

847
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:07,215
<i>I believe it's my team's duty</i>
<i>to achieve Team SNU's three-peat.</i>

848
00:41:07,507 --> 00:41:12,053
<i>I prepared myself to carry the team</i>
<i>as the ace player.</i>

849
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:19,143
We will now begin Equation Death Note,
the second match of the finals.

850
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:22,146
Here is your target number.

851
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:25,817
TARGET NUMBER
86404

852
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:27,485
Here we go.

853
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:32,281
What are the special numbers
we can use for 86,404?

854
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:35,743
I say we throw in 300 squared
and use 90,000 as our baseline.

855
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,626
- Go for it.
- Go ahead. I'll help you.

856
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:51,759
KIM MIN-SEOK'S EQUATION

857
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:54,721
Min-seok, let's go with this.

858
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:58,099
Here you go.

859
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,852
They're nowhere near the board, right?

860
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,687
Let's take Ji-hu out.

861
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:03,688
His code is 226.

862
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,940
We need to take him out.

863
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:07,275
THEY NEED ONE MORE 2 TO ATTACK KANG JI-HU

864
00:42:10,403 --> 00:42:13,281
MEANWHILE, KANG JI-HU
BEGINS PUTTING UP CARDS

865
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:16,159
- Ji-hu started working on it.
- We're almost ready.

866
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:17,535
Do we hit the buzzer?

867
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:25,001
Team SNU in Medicine
presented their equation.

868
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:28,212
TARGET NUMBER: 86,404

869
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:29,464
Team SNU in Medicine.

870
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:30,715
That is correct.

871
00:42:31,174 --> 00:42:33,009
Please name your target.

872
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:34,594
TEAM SNU'S REMAINING CARDS

873
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:39,307
SUNG TAE-HUN: 445, KIM DONG-YEON: 336,
LEE DONG-JAE: 115, KANG JI-HU: 226

874
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:41,184
We can't take anyone out.

875
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:42,810
- It's fine.
- You did great.

876
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:44,228
- We defended ourselves.
- You bet.

877
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:47,065
We'll take a pass.

878
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:48,775
- Pass?
- They took a pass.

879
00:42:48,858 --> 00:42:51,194
- How quick.
- They're so good.

880
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:53,071
You can outpace them easily.

881
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:54,864
Don't sweat it.

882
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:58,367
Here's your target number
for Equation Death Note.

883
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,203
TARGET NUMBER
41773

884
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:18,888
- Do you have something?
- Not yet.

885
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:20,515
- Not sure.
- Let's put it up.

886
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:23,392
I need the times card. Then...

887
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:25,812
- I need one more times card.
- The times card?

888
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:27,021
- We're out.
- Oh, right.

889
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:29,232
- Help me figure out how to tweak this.
- Okay.

890
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:31,109
To the 4th power and 6 factorial...

891
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:32,735
Wait, we're out of plus cards.

892
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,905
BOTH TEAMS NEED MORE SYMBOL CARDS

893
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:39,659
How do we get 8 with the remaining cards?
Let's use the cube of 2.

894
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,494
- Hit the buzzer.
- I'll do it.

895
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:42,995
TEAM SKKU FINISHES FIRST

896
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:44,413
Team SKKU.

897
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:47,291
TARGET NUMBER: 41,773
Damn it.

898
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:49,794
Team SKKU. That is correct.

899
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:51,879
Please name your target.

900
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,966
- Can we get anyone with 1, 1, 4, and 5?
- No.

901
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:56,592
Seung-hyeon's code is 122.

902
00:43:56,676 --> 00:43:58,136
We'll take a pass.

903
00:43:58,553 --> 00:43:59,846
- It's okay.
- Thank goodness.

904
00:43:59,929 --> 00:44:01,097
Let's take it slow.

905
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,266
I got too worked up just now.

906
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:06,686
<i>I felt the importance of staying calm.</i>

907
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:09,605
Here is your target number.

908
00:44:09,689 --> 00:44:10,690
TARGET NUMBER
28566

909
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:18,322
What is it?

910
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:21,492
- I have it ready. Just like this.
- Okay.

911
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:28,291
I need 4 factorial first
and then minus 10.

912
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:30,543
FACTORIAL: MULTIPLICATION
OF ALL NUMBERS BETWEEN 1 AND N

913
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:33,880
- That should do it.
- Okay, hang on a minute.

914
00:44:33,963 --> 00:44:35,590
- Wait for it, okay?
- All right.

915
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:44,015
Dong-jae, put up minus and five factorial.

916
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:45,391
Two thousand... Two hundred...

917
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:47,059
Wait, we don't need these.

918
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:49,395
I can use four factorial squared instead.

919
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:51,355
SEUNG-HYEON CHANGES THE EQUATION
TO TAKE OUT A PERSON

920
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:52,857
- Are we ready to go?
- You ready?

921
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,317
- Are you sure?
- I'm ready.

922
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,943
- Hit it.
- You sure about minus ten?

923
00:44:56,027 --> 00:44:57,111
Go on.

924
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:58,863
TARGET NUMBER: 28,566

925
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:01,032
- All right.
- Team SNU in Medicine.

926
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:03,034
Great, we have 115.

927
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:08,164
IF THE EQUATION IS CORRECT,
THEY CAN TAKE A SHOT AT LEE DONG-JAE

928
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:10,708
Team SNU in Medicine. That is incorrect.

929
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:12,835
- I had another one ready.
- My bad.

930
00:45:12,919 --> 00:45:15,630
LEE SEUNG-HYEON'S MISTAKE
I got the numbers mixed up.

931
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:18,591
Guys, they got it wrong.

932
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:20,176
We do have one, but just a second.

933
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:22,637
- Isn't this 169 squared plus 5?
- Really?

934
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,722
Hang on. Let me check 169 squared.

935
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:26,349
169 SQUARED EQUALS 28,561

936
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:28,517
The difference is five. You got it right.

937
00:45:28,601 --> 00:45:29,769
- Plus card.
- I'll hit the buzzer.

938
00:45:32,021 --> 00:45:33,147
Team SKKU.

939
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:35,191
TARGET NUMBER: 28,566

940
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:36,651
That is correct.

941
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,986
Please name your target.

LEE SEUNG-HYEON: 122, JOO MIN-SEO: 334

944
00:45:45,493 --> 00:45:48,287
One, one, two, three, four, six, six...

945
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,414
Min-seok is our only option.

946
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:51,749
- Who are we targeting?
- Min-seok.

947
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:54,794
Our target is Kim Min-seok.
We have his code, 466.

948
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:57,880
1 SHOT FIRED AT TEAM SNU'S KIM MIN-SEOK

949
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:00,174
Team SNU in Medicine's Kim Min-seok.

950
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:02,593
You lost a life.

951
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:07,598
- No worries.
- Sorry. It's okay.

952
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:10,810
- We can do better. Let's stay calm.
- Sure.

953

REMAINING LIVES
TEAM SNU: 7, TEAM SKKU: 8

954
00:46:16,399 --> 00:46:19,026
Here is your target number.

955
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:21,612
We could use 200 squared.
Do we have 199 squared?

956
00:46:21,696 --> 00:46:24,490
- Use 8 factorial instead.
- Put up 8 factorial.

957
00:46:25,074 --> 00:46:26,575
THE DUO PREPARES 8! FIRST

958
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:27,994
Won't we need a plus card?

959
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:30,288
What's next?

960
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:32,623
A minus card, for sure.

961
00:46:32,957 --> 00:46:34,542
We can use 40,000 minus 729.

962
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:35,751
- That's right.
- Yeah.

963
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:39,046
Please get me 40,000.

964
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:42,258
- I have it ready.
- Oh, yeah?

965
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:45,052
We can use 3 to the 6th power.

966
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:47,179
- I'll swap the cards.
- Do it quickly, though.

967
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:48,723
Hang on.

968
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:49,932
- Hang on.
- Hit the buzzer.

969
00:46:50,016 --> 00:46:51,225
TEAM SKKU HITS THE BUZZER FIRST

970
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:52,351
Team SKKU.

971
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:56,439
TARGET NUMBER: 39,271

972
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:58,357
Team SKKU. That is incorrect.

973
00:46:58,441 --> 00:46:59,734
Damn it.

974
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,445
- Hit it.
- Shall I?

975
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:05,489
Team SNU in Medicine. That is correct.

976
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:07,992
Please name your target.

977
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:09,744
TEAM SNU'S REMAINING CARDS

978
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:15,333
We have code 115.
Our target is Lee Dong-jae.

979
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:17,835
Me.

980
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:19,837
This is brutal.

981
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,339
- They're good.
- You bet.

982
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:23,674
Let's do our best.

983
00:47:23,758 --> 00:47:24,842
It's 1-1 now.

984
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:28,554
Here is your target number.

985
00:47:29,305 --> 00:47:32,391
- That's familiar somehow.
- I think I recognize the number.

986
00:47:32,475 --> 00:47:33,934
It's 248 squared.

987
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:37,688
Wait, you need to add 43 to 248 squared.

988
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:40,566
I do have an equation, but...

989
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:43,235
Go put the cards up.
You could beat them to it.

990
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:45,738
- Complete it with minus four.
- Go hit it.

991
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:49,283
Team SKKU, please present your equation.

992
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:52,161
Team SKKU. That is correct.

993
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:54,163
Please name your target.

994
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:58,626
We can't take anyone out with 136.

995
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:01,045
- We'll take a pass.
- We'll take a pass.

996
00:48:01,504 --> 00:48:04,757
It's too big a challenge
to keep the numbers for the codes.

997
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:06,634
- I feel so rushed.
- Same.

998
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:07,927
TARGETING IS DIFFICULT

999
00:48:08,094 --> 00:48:10,388
- Thank goodness.
- What a relief.

1000
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:12,890
I get antsy
that they might beat us to the race.

1001
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:15,309
- The stress is too much.
- It's difficult to stay calm.

1002
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:17,603
- We need to keep our heads.
- Totally.

1003
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:21,315
Here is your target number.

1004
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:23,317
TARGET NUMBER
37586

1005
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:30,616
Put this equation up.

1006
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:33,452
It's 12 times 5 to the 5th power plus 86.

1007
00:48:34,203 --> 00:48:35,329
Here's the times card.

1008
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:39,708
How about 3 to the 4th power
plus 6 minus 1?

1009
00:48:42,086 --> 00:48:43,170
Team SKKU.

1010
00:48:44,797 --> 00:48:46,549
Team SKKU. That is correct.

1011
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:48,634
Please name your target.

1012
00:48:49,218 --> 00:48:55,141
KIM MIN-SEOK: 446, HAN SEO-YEON: 155,
LEE SEUNG-HYEON: 122, JOO MIN-SEO: 334

1013
00:48:55,224 --> 00:48:58,269
We have code 122.
Our target is Lee Seung-hyeon.

1014
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:03,941
- They kept 1 and 2?
- Seriously?

1015
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:05,359
- I'm the target?
- Yeah.

1016
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:06,735
SUCCEEDS IN TARGETING THE HARDEST CODE

1017
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,654
They had the cards for 122?

1018
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:11,824
They didn't use two? Mad respect.

1019
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:13,534
Nice, Ji-hu.

1020
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:14,952
We're on a roll.

1021
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:17,288
Let's keep working like this. I like it.

1022
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:20,124
Keep feeding us numbers, Ji-hu.
We'll tweak and present them.

1023
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:25,379
<i>Seung-hyeon's code had 22,</i>
<i>making it very difficult to target him.</i>

1024
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:27,840
But we managed to attack him once.

1025
00:49:28,257 --> 00:49:32,261
I thought we would win no problem
if we could do it again and eliminate him.

1026
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:34,305
Here is your target number.

1027
00:49:35,264 --> 00:49:37,266
Focus.

1028
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:40,019
- This won't take long.
- My thoughts exactly.

1029
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:43,105
- It's 3 to the 8th power.
- You got something?

1030
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:44,940
It's 118 squared plus 23.

1031
00:49:45,024 --> 00:49:48,486
Add 118 squared to...
Let me swap 188 with 5 factorial minus 2.

1032
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:49,862
For 5 factorial minus 2...

1033
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:50,988
Square the number...

1034
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:52,781
The superscript.

1035
00:49:52,865 --> 00:49:54,909
- Hit that buzzer.
- Do it.

1036
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:58,329
TARGET NUMBER: 13,947

1037
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:00,498
Team SKKU. That is correct.

1038
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:03,667
Can we take a shot at anyone?

1039
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:07,171
TEAM SKKU'S REMAINING CARDS

1040
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:10,549
THEY CAN TARGET
KIM MIN-SEOK OR JOO MIN-SEO

1041
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:12,885
It's better to take
one player out quickly.

1042
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:15,513
We have code 466.
Our target is Kim Min-seok.

1043
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:18,057
- Oh, my.
- It's okay.

1044
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:22,269
Team SKKU's attack was successful.

1045
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:26,106
- Team SNU in Medicine's Kim Min-seok.
- We'll do our best.

1046
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:31,028
You lost both your lives
and cannot compete anymore.

1047
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:33,155
Please return to your base camp.

1048
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:34,698
KIM MIN-SEOK IS EXCLUDED

1049
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:38,035
Hold up. This is a disaster.

1050
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:40,955
But we can take one player out

1051
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,123
- True.
- with one more successful attack.

1052
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:44,875
This is a huge gain.

1053
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:47,336
This is a major shift in our favor.

1054
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:50,839
REMAINING LIVES
TEAM SNU: 5, TEAM SKKU: 7

1055
00:50:51,257 --> 00:50:52,508
Here is your target number.

1056
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:53,884
TARGET NUMBER
18128

1057
00:50:57,346 --> 00:50:58,973
Can't we use this?

1058
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:00,516
Go for it if you have one.

1059
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:03,852
I'll put up the cards.
Wait, tell me if the numbers don't match.

1060
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:12,194
- Can we take a shot at anyone?
- I can't say.

1061
00:51:12,278 --> 00:51:13,362
Can't we use this?

1062
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:14,989
Six factorial times...

1063
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:19,118
BOTH TEAM DIVIDE THE TARGET NUMBER
INTO 18,000 AND 128

1064
00:51:19,535 --> 00:51:20,911
Can we get seven?

1065
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:22,204
- Seven?
- That's what bugs me.

1066
00:51:22,288 --> 00:51:23,372
We can get seven.

1067
00:51:23,664 --> 00:51:25,207
We're good, right? Hit it.

1068
00:51:25,958 --> 00:51:27,042
Hit it.

1069
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:30,004
No, we're too late. They beat us to it.

1070
00:51:30,588 --> 00:51:32,214
I like the number 18,128.

1071
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:34,633
Team SKKU. That is correct.

1072
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:38,053
Our target is Joo Min-seo.
We have code 334.

1073
00:51:38,137 --> 00:51:39,388
We have code 334.

1074
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:41,265
- Does it mean you're out?
- No.

1075
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:45,102
Team SNU in Medicine's Joo Min-seo.
You lost a life.

1076
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:47,104
A neat takedown.

1077
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:48,856
We're doing great.

1078
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:50,482
Seriously, we're killing it.

1079
00:51:50,566 --> 00:51:52,026
- Let's keep it up.
- Great.

1080
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:54,028
I'm dying to take Seung-hyeon down.

1081
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:56,155
- I want it so badly.
- Same here.

1082
00:51:56,572 --> 00:51:58,490
- Did we only attack once?
- Yes.

1083
00:51:58,574 --> 00:52:00,117
We're still early into the game.

1084
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:02,494
- Meanwhile, they took four hits on us.
- Oh, really?

1085
00:52:02,578 --> 00:52:05,039
- That's quite a lot.
- There's no denying it.

1086
00:52:05,331 --> 00:52:08,542
But we can still turn it around.
I know we can pull it off.

1087
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:12,171
REMAINING LIVES
TEAM SNU: 4, TEAM SKKU: 7

1088
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:15,299
Here's your target number
for Equation Death Note.

1089
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:16,842
TARGET NUMBER
29166

1090
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:24,475
Let's go with 171 squared minus 75.

1091
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:26,143
Wait, can't we make it simpler?

1092
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:29,396
I have 170 squared plus 266,
but not something with only exponents.

1093
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,815
- I'll give it more thought.
- Let's take a minute.

1094
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:34,902
- If we can't attack anyway...
- I get what you mean.

1095
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,904
I have an equation.

1096
00:52:37,321 --> 00:52:39,657
This is it. Can we attack anyone?

1097
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:42,034
- We got 445.
- Okay, hit it.

1098
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:43,369
Team SNU in Medicine.

1099
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:44,703
TARGET NUMBER: 29,166

1100
00:52:44,787 --> 00:52:46,080
That is correct.

1101
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:48,123
Please name your target.

1102
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:51,043
We submit code 445 for an attack.

1103
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:53,253
1 SHOT FIRED AT TEAM SKKU'S SUNG TAE-HUN

1104
00:52:53,754 --> 00:52:55,047
- It's Tae-hun.
- Tae-hun?

1105
00:52:57,549 --> 00:53:00,052
REMAINING LIVES

1106
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:02,346
TEAM SNU: 4, TEAM SKKU: 6

1107
00:53:02,805 --> 00:53:05,099
You guys can do it.

1108
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:08,352
I know you can win this.

1109
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:09,687
Let's not focus on attacks,

1110
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:12,314
and do it only when Team SNU
gets the equation wrong.

1111
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:17,403
- Otherwise, hit the buzzer.
- Right, we should defend ourselves.

1112
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:22,032
<i>I imagined that we'd easily take the game</i>
<i>the moment they lost a player.</i>

1113
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:26,286
<i>But Team SNU in Medicine stayed focused</i>
<i>on the game without wavering.</i>

1114
00:53:26,787 --> 00:53:29,289
That's when I realized
it wouldn't be so easy.

1115
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:32,543
Here is your target number
for the Equation Death Note.

1116
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:37,005
We can use 130 squared plus 29.

1117
00:53:37,089 --> 00:53:38,048
That checks out.

1118
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:42,136
Hang on. How do we get this?

1119
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:44,680
I'll go help Seo-yeon.

1120
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:47,099
I only need to tweak this part.
Can you make it work?

1121
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:49,476
- What, 7 to the 5th power?
- I'll use 3 times 3 minus 2.

1122
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,061
- Or 3 plus 4.
- I need 3 times 3 minus 2.

1123
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:53,313
- Dong-jae.
- Yeah?

1124
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:57,276
I think 5 to the 3rd power plus 5
would be better.

1125
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:01,321
- Take on the latter part.
- I'm on it.

1126
00:54:01,405 --> 00:54:03,407
Have you found it? I need the plus card.

1127
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:04,491
Five factorial...

1128
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:06,034
We need two here.

1129
00:54:06,118 --> 00:54:08,454
- Does it work?
- Hang on.

1130
00:54:08,537 --> 00:54:10,831
- I should...
- We have the equation, at least.

1131
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:11,957
Can't we swap any?

1132
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:15,753
Neither 446 nor 116 is a valid code.

1133
00:54:15,836 --> 00:54:17,629
We need a five.

1134
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:18,881
- Really?
- So...

1135
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:20,758
- Can we do it?
- Divide 6 factorial by 6.

1136
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:24,720
We should've gone with that.

1137
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:26,513
What a shame.

1138
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:27,848
The minus card...

1139
00:54:29,475 --> 00:54:31,226
- We got it.
- It's a match.

1140
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:33,061
TARGET NUMBER: 16,929

1141
00:54:33,604 --> 00:54:36,190
What a bummer.
We wanted to attack so badly...

1142
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:37,649
They'll get us instead.

1143
00:54:37,733 --> 00:54:39,735
I know. Instead of the hunter,
we became the hunted.

1144
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:40,986
- That is correct.
- Shoot.

1145
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:42,946
Please name your target.

1146
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:45,949
- We'll take a pass.
- We'll take a pass.

1147
00:54:46,158 --> 00:54:47,201
Thank goodness.

1148
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:48,452
- I'm so relieved.
- We survived.

1149
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:49,870
It doesn't matter which team answers

1150
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:51,997
- if no attacks can be made.
- So true.

1151
00:54:52,748 --> 00:54:54,416
We could've attacked them
if we had spared one.

1152
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,376
- It's okay.
- Wait, no. We need 1 and 2.

1153
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:57,336
How do we not use two?

1154
00:54:57,419 --> 00:55:00,923
If it looks like they have an answer,
we have to hit faster to defend.

1155
00:55:01,507 --> 00:55:03,342
Here is your target number.

1156
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:05,344
TEAM SKKU'S YET ANOTHER QUICK RESPONSE

1157
00:55:05,594 --> 00:55:07,262
Please name your target.

1158
00:55:07,346 --> 00:55:08,931
We'll take a pass.

1159
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:10,599
Here is your target number.

1160
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:12,518
ANOTHER PASS WITHOUT AN ATTACK
We'll take a pass.

1161
00:55:12,601 --> 00:55:14,019
Here is your target number.

1162
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:15,479
- We'll take a pass.
- We'll take a pass.

1163
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:17,231
- We'll take a pass.
- We'll take a pass.

1164
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:20,150
Let's just submit
if it looks like they're going to answer.

1165
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:22,569
We have more to lose
since we have fewer lives.

1166
00:55:22,653 --> 00:55:25,948
Yeah, we shouldn't get fixated
on dealing blows.

1167
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:31,245
1 HOUR GOES BY WITHOUT A SINGLE ATTACK

1168
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:38,001
27TH TARGET NUMBER REVEALED
Here is your target number.

1169
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:39,503
TARGET NUMBER
30302

1170
00:55:42,631 --> 00:55:43,966
It's 30,302 this time?

1171
00:55:47,636 --> 00:55:50,430
- Let me go work on something.
- Okay.

1172
00:55:50,514 --> 00:55:52,474
I have an equation for 78.

1173
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,018
I think this is better.

1174
00:55:55,102 --> 00:55:57,771
It's 8 factorial times 3
divided by 4 plus 62.

1175
00:55:57,855 --> 00:55:59,439
- Isn't it better?
- Okay, use it.

1176
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:00,524
Here, Tae-hun.

1177
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:02,276
KANG JI-HU DELIVERS HIS EQUATION

1178
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,862
- That's the simplest.
- Okay.

1179
00:56:05,112 --> 00:56:06,405
Eight factorial times...

1180
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:07,614
- Plus 62, was it?
- Yeah.

1181
00:56:07,698 --> 00:56:09,116
We'll use cube of 4 minus...

1182
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:11,994
I need an equation for 30,000.

1183
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:15,080
How do I break it down?
Isn't it 3 times 10 to the 4th power?

1184
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:16,915
We can replace 10 with 4 plus 6.

1185
00:56:16,999 --> 00:56:18,750
- I'm...
- Hit it.

1186
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:22,462
Team SKKU. Please present your equation.

1187
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:24,715
TARGET NUMBER: 30,302

1188
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:27,384
They probably got it. It was easy.

1189
00:56:29,553 --> 00:56:31,555
Team SKKU. That is correct.

1190
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:33,181
Please name your target.

1191
00:56:33,849 --> 00:56:35,434
We have 155.

1192
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:37,102
Let's take a shot at Seo-yeon.

1193
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:38,937
- All right.
- We can take a shot, no?

1194
00:56:39,313 --> 00:56:41,648
Our target is Han Seo-yeon.
We have code 155.

1195
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:44,192
1 SHOT FIRED AT TEAM SNU'S HAN SEO-YEON

1196
00:56:44,276 --> 00:56:45,569
It's okay. We all have one life left.

1197
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:46,945
- Really?
- Sure.

1198
00:56:47,029 --> 00:56:48,238
That's a relief.

1199
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,908
<i>Team SNU in Medicine's Han Seo-yeon.</i>

1200
00:56:50,991 --> 00:56:52,326
<i>You lost a life.</i>

1201
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:54,453
REMAINING LIVES
TEAM SNU: 3, TEAM SKKU: 6

1202
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:57,122
It's better to take out a player for good.

1203
00:56:57,205 --> 00:56:59,166
- Still, that was amazing.
- It's okay.

1204
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:01,126
We somehow fired that shot.

1205
00:57:01,209 --> 00:57:02,210
THANKS TO KANG JI-HU'S PERFORMANCE

1206
00:57:02,294 --> 00:57:03,420
Isn't it crazy?

1207
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:05,797
Here is your target number.

1208
00:57:05,881 --> 00:57:06,965
TARGET NUMBER
15932

1209
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:08,592
What, 15,932?

1210
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:10,177
What's the closest square?

1211
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,845
We can do 5 to the 6th power.
That's 15625.

1212
00:57:13,722 --> 00:57:15,557
Add 307 to that.

1213
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:17,726
Let's use 5 to the 6th power.

1214
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:19,478
Was it 5 to the 6th power?

1215
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:21,730
You need 307, too.

1216
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:23,899
- Hang on. Let's make it 300 plus 7.
- What?

1217
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:25,692
Can't we just throw in 300 plus 7?

1218
00:57:25,776 --> 00:57:27,194
We need 307.

1219
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:28,987
How do we get 307?

1220
00:57:29,071 --> 00:57:31,031
Didn't we make
an equation for 300 earlier?

1221
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,658
Can you remind me?

1222
00:57:32,741 --> 00:57:35,118
How did we get 300 earlier?
We had a number close to 300.

1223
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:37,245
Divide 5 factorial by 2

1224
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:39,456
- and multiply it by 5.
- Do I add times 5?

1225
00:57:40,082 --> 00:57:42,209
Wait, we have 5 to the 6th power.
We're out of 5.

1226
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,878
I don't think we can get it.
That 307 is nasty.

1227
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:47,881
Five factorial times...

1228
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:49,758
Wait, did we use five already?

1229
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:51,885
This won't work, then.

1230
00:57:52,344 --> 00:57:54,888
Hey, Seo-yeon.
Isn't it easier to dock 68 from 16,000?

1231
00:57:54,972 --> 00:57:55,806
Well...

1232
00:57:56,598 --> 00:57:59,267
- Do you have an equation?
- No, but just take out 68.

1233
00:57:59,351 --> 00:58:00,936
- Does this work?
- Probably not.

1234
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:03,689
- My idea is easier.
- Okay, let's go with that.

1235
00:58:03,772 --> 00:58:05,357
TEAM SNU CHOOSES AN ALTERNATIVE EQUATION

1236
00:58:06,066 --> 00:58:08,110
- Swap that with 6 minus 1.
- Okay.

1237
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:09,528
MEANWHILE, TEAM SKKU STICKS WITH 307

1238
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:11,238
Let's take our time.
Check if 6 plus 1 works.

1239
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:13,573
- Then, times 2 minus 1.
- Times 2 minus 1.

1240
00:58:13,657 --> 00:58:14,741
We're all set, right?

1241
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:16,284
- Hurry.
- Hit the buzzer.

1242
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:21,707
- That works, right?
- Sure.

1243
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:24,126
- Of course.
- We added 307, right?

1244
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:25,961
Team SKKU. That is correct.

1245
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:27,879
Please name your target.

1246
00:58:28,088 --> 00:58:29,881
We have the cards for 334.

1247
00:58:29,965 --> 00:58:32,217
- We can use code 334.
- We absolutely can.

1248
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,427
Yes, for sure.

1249
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:36,513
That was insane, Ji-hu.

1250
00:58:36,805 --> 00:58:39,433
- Nice one. I love you, Ji-hu.
- Team SKKU...

1251
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:41,768
- We have code 334.
- We have code 334.

1252
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:43,353
Our target is Joo Min-seo.

1253
00:58:43,437 --> 00:58:48,025
1 SHOT FIRED AT TEAM SNU'S JOO MIN-SEO

1254
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:54,072
Team SNU in Medicine's Joo Min-seo.

1255
00:58:54,156 --> 00:58:57,034
- You lost both your lives.
- Good luck, guys.

1256
00:58:57,242 --> 00:58:59,327
- You've got this.
- We'll do our best.

1257
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:00,620
Oh, no.

1258
00:59:01,121 --> 00:59:03,498
TEAM SNU HAS ONLY 2 MEMBERS LEFT

1259
00:59:03,582 --> 00:59:04,416
WHILE TEAM SKKU HAS ALL 4 MEMBERS

1260
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:05,584
Seriously, Ji-hu.

1261
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:07,878
That was freaking unreal, Ji-hu.

1262
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:09,171
We're all doing great.

1263
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:11,048
- Let's hang in there a little longer.
- Sure.

1264
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:13,633
- Let's keep this up.
- We're almost there.

1265
00:59:13,717 --> 00:59:17,387
REMAINING LIVES
TEAM SNU: 2, TEAM SKKU: 6

1266
00:59:17,846 --> 00:59:20,265
Here is your target number
for the Equation Death Note.

1267
00:59:20,474 --> 00:59:21,850
TARGET NUMBER
47166

1268
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:25,687
I have an idea.

1269
00:59:25,771 --> 00:59:27,814
- We can use 6 to the 6th power plus--
- Plus 500.

1270
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:29,733
Yes, 6 to the 6th power plus 500.

1271
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:33,028
- Wait, we need 5 to the 3rd power--
- I'll add times 2 in the end.

1272
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:34,654
Work on the first part.

1273
00:59:34,738 --> 00:59:36,656
- Okay.
- I'll handle the rest.

1274
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:39,201
Are we ready?
Let's see if we can attack anyone.

1275
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:40,535
What do we have left?

1276
00:59:45,874 --> 00:59:46,875
- Let's go.
- Hit it.

1277
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:51,963
But we can't attack anyone.
We don't have the right cards.

1278
00:59:52,047 --> 00:59:55,175
Don't worry about it.
We need to get it before they do.

1279
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:57,302
They can't take us out.

1280
00:59:57,385 --> 00:59:59,179
That's why they waited for so long.

1281
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:01,014
This checks out, right?

1282
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:02,432
TEAM SNU BELATEDLY COMPLETES THE EQUATION

1283
01:00:02,808 --> 01:00:05,185
- We managed to save so many cards.
- I know.

1284
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:08,480
What a shame. If only we had been quicker.

1285
01:00:09,231 --> 01:00:10,315
Couldn't we have tweaked it?

1286
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:11,900
- Guys.
- They started working on it.

1287
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:13,443
But we can see their progress--

1288
01:00:13,652 --> 01:00:15,821
Guys, we needed to add ten to that.

1289
01:00:15,904 --> 01:00:17,489
What the... We got it wrong?

1290
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:18,657
It's short of ten.

1291
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:19,699
- Really?
- Hang on.

1292
01:00:19,783 --> 01:00:21,618
Team SKKU. That is incorrect.

1293
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:23,495
Team SKKU. That is incorrect.

1294
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:25,455
- We get our shot now.
- Wait.

1295
01:00:25,539 --> 01:00:26,665
- Look.
- Okay.

1296
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:28,542
We can meet the target number this way.

1297
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:29,543
- Right?
- Yeah.

1298
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:31,419
- We have these cards, too.
- We can take a shot.

1299
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:33,547
Divide 5 factorial by 4...

1300
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:34,840
IF CORRECT, THEY CAN ATTACK LEE DONG-JAE

1301
01:00:34,923 --> 01:00:36,174
It's good. Hit it.

1302
01:00:36,675 --> 01:00:37,843
Team SNU in Medicine.

1303
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:42,681
Our equation is 6 to the 6th power
plus 5 factorial divided by 4

1304
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:47,435
times the result of 4 squared
plus 3 divided by 3.

1305
01:00:47,936 --> 01:00:49,980
Well done. That was amazing.

1306
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:54,442
- We'll get an edge with one person out.
- We'll get some breathing room.

1307
01:00:54,693 --> 01:00:58,655
Team SNU in Medicine. That is correct.
Please name your target.

1308
01:00:58,738 --> 01:01:01,366
SUNG TAE-HUN: 445, KIM DONG-YEON: 336,
LEE DONG-JAE: 115, KANG JI-HU: 226

1309
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:03,743
Our target is Team SKKU's Lee Dong-jae.

1310
01:01:04,119 --> 01:01:05,328
- They named you.
- Me?

1311
01:01:05,412 --> 01:01:06,580
Yeah, you.

1312
01:01:09,249 --> 01:01:11,376
- You did great.
- I'll be cheering for you.

1313
01:01:11,626 --> 01:01:14,504
Team SNU in Medicine's attack
was successful.

1314
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:16,798
Wow, they took out someone.

1315
01:01:16,882 --> 01:01:19,009
<i>I'm looking forward</i>
<i>to a come-from-behind victory.</i>

1316
01:01:19,092 --> 01:01:21,928
<i>Of course, they have it in them.</i>

1317
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:25,432
We can still win. We've got this.

1318
01:01:25,891 --> 01:01:28,143
- Let's focus, everyone.
- We need full focus.

1319
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:30,770
- We could still end up losing.
- That's a real possibility.

1320
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:34,274
<i>I reminded myself</i>
<i>not to let my guard down.</i>

1321

REMAINING LIVES
TEAM SNU: 2, TEAM SKKU: 5

1322
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:39,988
Here is your target number.

1323
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:41,740
TARGET NUMBER
18748

1324
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:45,285
- Check out the exponents.
- Okay.

1325
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:48,330
- We need to take away 935?
- Yes, we do.

1326
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:49,664
Let's work on the board.

1327
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:52,584
TEAM SKKU STARTS MAKING AN EQUATION

1328
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:53,877
So 3 to the 9th power...

1329
01:01:57,464 --> 01:01:58,882
I can break down the number.

1330
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:01,468
It's 6 times 5 to the 5th power minus 2.

1331
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:03,428
- Yes, that adds up.
- Great.

1332
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:10,060
So five factorial times...

1333
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:13,605
We can use 5 factorial times 8
minus 5 squared.

1334
01:02:17,943 --> 01:02:19,277
Team SNU in Medicine.

1335
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:24,532
Our equation is
6 times 5 to the 5th power minus 2.

1336
01:02:24,616 --> 01:02:26,785
TARGET NUMBER: 18,748

1337
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:29,037
Team SNU in Medicine. That is correct.

1338
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:30,956
Please name your target.

1339
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,376
- They have the cards to attack.
- They'll attack us.

1340
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:37,045
I'm going to be their target.

1341
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:40,215
We have code 336.

1342
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:44,219
Team SKKU's Kim Dong-yeon.
You lost a life.

1343
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:48,390
They might overtake us. Let's be careful.

1344
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:51,393
REMAINING LIVES
TEAM SNU: 2, TEAM SKKU: 4

1345
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:53,770
I think we're getting the hang of it.
Let's keep it up.

1346
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:55,814
- It's so hard to spare 2 and 5.
- I know.

1347
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:57,274
TEAM SNU SUCCEEDED IN DOUBLE ATTACKS

1348
01:02:58,108 --> 01:03:01,236
<i>It wasn't simply</i>
<i>about making an equation quickly.</i>

1349
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:07,117
We also needed to make it nice and elegant
to be able to attack the opponents.

1350
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:10,495
After realizing that,
I took a long look at the numbers.

1351
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:12,372
I can break down the number.

1352
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:14,582
It's 6 times 5 to the 5th power minus 2.

1353
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:18,128
<i>I then discovered a pattern</i>
<i>in the target numbers.</i>

1354
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:21,631
<i>They could be broken into the sum</i>
<i>or the multiplication of neat numbers.</i>

1355
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:24,092
We need to look for neat numbers.

1356
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:25,927
- It's a clean solution.
- I see.

1357
01:03:26,011 --> 01:03:28,305
They're not using this approach.

1358
01:03:28,388 --> 01:03:29,639
If we keep at it...

1359
01:03:29,723 --> 01:03:33,310
- We might gain the upper hand.
- Exactly.

1360
01:03:33,685 --> 01:03:36,104
Here is your target number
for the Equation Death Note.

1361
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:37,772
TARGET NUMBER
77498

1362
01:03:39,107 --> 01:03:41,067
We can use 78,125 as the baseline.

1363
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:42,319
So 78,125?

1364
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:45,989
- How much do we need to subtract?
- Exactly 627.

1365
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:48,325
- Take out 627.
- Got it.

1366
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:52,579
- I'll set up 627.
- Okay.

1367
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:59,336
- One more.
- I have 160.

1368
01:03:59,419 --> 01:04:00,628
All done. Hit it.

1369
01:04:01,421 --> 01:04:03,882
TEAM SKKU HITS THE BUZZER FIRST

1370
01:04:04,424 --> 01:04:07,177
TEAM SNU MISSES THEIR CHANCE BY A HAIR

1371
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:09,721
TARGET NUMBER: 77,498

1372
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:11,514
Please be wrong. We can take a shot, too.

1373
01:04:11,598 --> 01:04:13,475
- Let's review the result.
- We have 336.

1374
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:14,768
We're good.

1375
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:17,228
Team SKKU. That is incorrect.

1376
01:04:17,312 --> 01:04:18,355
We got it wrong?

1377
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:21,733
- Yes, we're right.
- From 78,125, right?

1378
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:23,651
- We can use either 336 or...
- Let's go for 336

1379
01:04:23,735 --> 01:04:25,612
- and take one player out.
- We can do that, right?

1380
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:26,738
- Shall I hit it?
- Do it.

1381
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:28,365
TARGET NUMBER: 77,498

1382
01:04:28,448 --> 01:04:29,532
Team SNU in Medicine.

1383

Please name your target.

1385
01:04:32,619 --> 01:04:34,913
We have code 336.

1386
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:38,249
Team SNU in Medicine's attack
was successful.

1387
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:42,087
- Wait, did that take you out?
- It did.

1388
01:04:43,046 --> 01:04:44,297
They pull that off.

1389
01:04:47,675 --> 01:04:50,011
They can turn the tables and win.

1390
01:04:50,095 --> 01:04:51,262
You never know.

1391
01:04:51,346 --> 01:04:53,181
Should we do a big cheer for them?

1392
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:54,599
One, two, three.

1393
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:56,393
- You've got this!
- You've got this!

1394
01:04:56,768 --> 01:04:58,478
- All right!
- We've got this!

1395
01:04:59,187 --> 01:05:02,107
We almost caught up to them.
They only have one more life than we do.

1396
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:04,317
We're doing great. The tide has shifted.

1397
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:05,944
We took shots back-to-back.

1398
01:05:06,027 --> 01:05:08,154
<i>Seung-hyeon was getting better and better.</i>

1399
01:05:08,238 --> 01:05:11,658
<i>I thought we needed to work quickly</i>
<i>and wrap up the match soon.</i>

1400
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:14,411
- No more mistakes from now on.
- Okay.

1401
01:05:14,494 --> 01:05:16,329
Focus, Ji-hu.

1402

01:05:26,131 --> 01:05:29,050
That's 110 squared plus 92.

1405
01:05:29,134 --> 01:05:32,220
- Work on 92.
- Are you sure we need 92 and not 192?

1406
01:05:32,512 --> 01:05:34,722
- You're right. Sorry.
- So it's 192, right?

1407
01:05:37,267 --> 01:05:39,602
Team SNU in Medicine.
Please present your equation.

1408
01:05:40,562 --> 01:05:41,604
Damn it.

1409
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:46,067
Our equation is
4 to the 6th power times 3 plus 4.

We have code 226.
Our target is Team SKKU's Kang Ji-hu.

1414

Team SKKU's Kang Ji-hu. You lost a life.

1415
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:08,339
It's okay. We're at a tie now.

1416
01:06:08,423 --> 01:06:09,549
- Do we have a tie?
- Yeah.

1417
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:12,010
Everyone has a life left,
and we're crushing it.

1418
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:13,428
Let's please keep it up.

1419
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:15,221
- We're better.
- We're in our top form.

1420
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:17,432
THERE ONCE WAS A HUGE GAP

1421
01:06:17,515 --> 01:06:18,349

Our target is Team SKKU's Kang Ji-hu.

1426

TEAM SNU IN MEDICAL MANAGED TO GET A TIE

1427
01:06:34,532 --> 01:06:35,950
We can't let them overtake us.

1428
01:06:36,034 --> 01:06:38,161
I'd be so upset if that happened.

1429
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:39,746
Shall we do a cheer?

1430
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:41,247
One, two, three.

1431
01:06:41,331 --> 01:06:43,791
- Good luck, Team SKKU!
- Good luck, Team SKKU!

1432
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:46,753
Go for it!

1433
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:51,174
- All right!
- We've got this!

1434
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:54,719
<i>It seemed like we could get</i>
<i>a comeback victory</i>

1435
01:06:54,802 --> 01:06:57,222
<i>and secure victory</i>
<i>without playing the third match.</i>

1436
01:06:57,889 --> 01:07:00,433
- We're tied now, aren't we?
- Yes.

1437
01:07:01,476 --> 01:07:02,644
They look glum.

1438
01:07:02,727 --> 01:07:05,355
That's not surprising.
We're on a roll here.

1439
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:10,235

Tae-hun.

1443
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,702
Let's use 8 factorial divided by 2
plus 6 to the 4th power plus 1.

1444
01:07:20,078 --> 01:07:22,163
- Take on 8 factorial.
- Make 8 factorial?

1445
01:07:22,664 --> 01:07:25,333
TEAM SKKU HAS A HEAD START

1446
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:30,838
- How's 10 cubed minus 4 factorial plus 1?
- I have 4 to the 6th power times 5.

1447
01:07:30,922 --> 01:07:31,756
Then, plus 10...

1448
01:07:32,131 --> 01:07:33,841
Wait, 10 cubed minus 4 factorial plus 1?

1449
01:07:33,925 --> 01:07:35,134
I need a factorial.

1450
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:37,387
- Come over here.
- Hey!

1451
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:39,389
I need a factorial.

1452
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:45,144
JI-HU HIT THE BUZZER
BEFORE THE EQUATION WAS COMPLETED

1453
01:07:45,228 --> 01:07:47,188
Team SKKU. That is incorrect.

1454
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:51,192
They didn't get it right.

1455
01:07:51,776 --> 01:07:54,153
- Let's change just this one.
- Please go ahead.

1456
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:56,114
You have ten seconds left.

1457
01:07:56,197 --> 01:07:57,907
Replace 2 with 3 minus 1
and add parentheses.

1458
01:07:57,991 --> 01:07:59,284
I'll make room for you.

1459
01:07:59,367 --> 01:08:01,703
We forgot to divide that by two.

1460
01:08:01,786 --> 01:08:02,870
We need that.

1461
01:08:02,954 --> 01:08:04,998
TEAM SKKU JUST NEEDS A SIMPLE REVISION

1462
01:08:05,665 --> 01:08:06,958
- We got it, right?
- Yes, we got it.

1463
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:07,959
Double-check for me.

1464
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:09,419
Take out the parentheses.

1465
01:08:09,502 --> 01:08:10,753
Your time is up.

1466
01:08:10,837 --> 01:08:11,838
We're good now.

1467
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:15,049
Your time is up.

1468
01:08:15,675 --> 01:08:16,759
Hit it.

1469
01:08:17,385 --> 01:08:18,511
Hit it.

1470
01:08:18,595 --> 01:08:21,514
Team SNU in Medicine.
Please present your equation.

1471
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:29,981
- We forgot the extra set of parentheses.
- The parentheses!

1472
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:31,107
LEFT OUT THE EXTRA PARENTHESES

1473
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:33,234
Team SNU in Medicine. That is incorrect.

1474
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:36,529
Team SKKU.

1475
01:08:36,613 --> 01:08:38,781
Our equation is
factorial of 2 times 4 divided by 2

1476
01:08:38,865 --> 01:08:40,908
plus 6 to the 4th power plus 1.

We have code 155.
Our target is Han Seo-yeon.

1481
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:57,008
I'll leave it in your hands.

1482
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:00,720
We should've used the original equation.

1483
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:02,889
- Right?
- It's a shame.

1484
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:03,806
I'm counting on you.

1485
01:09:04,307 --> 01:09:07,143
<i>It made me uneasy</i>
<i>to leave Seung-hyeon all alone,</i>

1486
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:10,188
<i>but if anyone could pull through,</i>
<i>I knew it would be Seung-hyeon.</i>

1487
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:13,316
- It's a struggle when you're alone.
- For sure.

1488
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:16,444
It's hard to run the numbers
and make an equation all alone.

1489
01:09:22,241 --> 01:09:25,495
Let's stay calm
and keep our heads in the game.

1490
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:29,040
We got to a point where one person
can just focus on the equation.

1491
01:09:29,123 --> 01:09:30,958
- Still, don't let your guard down.
- Of course.

1492
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:36,464
I've got this.

1493
01:09:36,547 --> 01:09:39,592
I can pull this off.

1494
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:43,304
Here is your target number
for the Equation Death Note.

1495
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:46,057
TARGET NUMBER
46629

1496
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:56,317
TEAM SKKU HITS THE BUZZER FIRST

1497
01:09:56,401 --> 01:09:57,318
Team SKKU.

1498
01:09:58,778 --> 01:09:59,946
Team SKKU.

1499
01:10:01,656 --> 01:10:04,200
MOMENTS AGO

1500
01:10:06,828 --> 01:10:08,496
Tae-hun, I've got it.

1501
01:10:08,579 --> 01:10:09,664
IT ONLY TOOK HIM 4 SECONDS

1502
01:10:09,747 --> 01:10:12,041
We need 6 to the 6th power minus 3 cubed.

1503
01:10:12,834 --> 01:10:14,168
Team SKKU.

1504
01:10:14,252 --> 01:10:16,379
Our equation is
6 to the power of 6 minus 3 cubed.

1505
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:27,223
Team SKKU. That is correct.

1506
01:10:27,306 --> 01:10:29,517
- Please name your target.
- You can do the honors.

1507
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:30,685
Let's put up 122.

1508
01:10:31,102 --> 01:10:33,563
Our target is Team SNU's Lee Seung-hyeon.
We have code 122.

1509
01:10:34,355 --> 01:10:38,359
Team SNU in Medicine's Lee Seung-hyeon,
you lost both lives.

1510
01:10:40,778 --> 01:10:43,698
All members of Team SNU in Medicine
are eliminated.

1511
01:10:43,781 --> 01:10:46,117
The game ends with Team SKKU's victory.

1512
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:47,910
TEAM SKKU WINS THE 2ND MATCH

1513
01:10:54,876 --> 01:10:56,419
- I freaking love you.
- Great work.

1514
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:58,463
- Come here, Ji-hu.
- I love you.

1515
01:10:58,546 --> 01:10:59,714
Good job. Let's give him a hug.

1516
01:10:59,797 --> 01:11:00,631
Thanks a bunch.

1517
01:11:00,715 --> 01:11:02,133
Seriously, you were amazing.

1518
01:11:02,216 --> 01:11:03,718
- Thanks.
- One more game now.

1519
01:11:04,051 --> 01:11:06,888
Team SNU in Medicine was defeated
by a hair's breadth just now,

1520
01:11:06,971 --> 01:11:08,514
so they must be pretty out of it.

1521
01:11:08,598 --> 01:11:10,433
We'll give them a crushing defeat
in Round 3.

1522
01:11:10,516 --> 01:11:11,934
I'll be brief.

1523
01:11:12,018 --> 01:11:14,145
We'll win the third match
and become the champions.

1524
01:11:14,228 --> 01:11:15,313
Let's win the third match.

1525
01:11:15,396 --> 01:11:16,898
Let's do that. We did great, though.

1526
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:19,734
- You sure did. I can't thank you enough.
- What a bummer.

1527
01:11:19,817 --> 01:11:23,821
<i>I honestly thought we had it in the bag,</i>
<i>so I'm very disappointed by the result.</i>

1528
01:11:23,905 --> 01:11:27,283
But I'll make sure we don't repeat
the mistake from the second match.

1529
01:11:27,533 --> 01:11:31,287
My resolve going in was
to win at all costs.

1530
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:34,332
<i>Brainpower survival challenge,</i>
<i>Elite League Season 3.</i>

1531
01:11:34,415 --> 01:11:35,249
<i>The finals.</i>

1532
01:11:36,167 --> 01:11:42,173
<i>Team SNU in Medicine and Team SKKU</i>
<i>are currently tied at 1-1.</i>

1533
01:11:42,381 --> 01:11:44,383
FINALS
TEAM SNU: 1, TEAM SKKU: 1

1534
01:11:45,343 --> 01:11:46,928
<i>Man, my nerves are killing me.</i>

1535
01:11:47,011 --> 01:11:49,597
What if it's something I'm not good at?
That gets me nervous.

1536
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:51,766
It's worse now
that we only have one game left.

1537
01:11:51,849 --> 01:11:54,477
You'll feel better
once the game is announced.

1538
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:57,230
It's always the most nerve-racking
the moment before the announcement.

1539
01:11:57,313 --> 01:12:00,358
But hey, we're good tacticians.

1540
01:12:00,691 --> 01:12:03,194
<i>Dang, this is the final game.</i>

1541
01:12:03,277 --> 01:12:05,488
The trophy would make
all our troubles worthwhile.

1542
01:12:05,571 --> 01:12:06,906
- So let's win.
- Of course.

1543
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:08,491
Let's do this.

1544
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:12,203
<i>Brainpower survival challenge,</i>
<i>Elite League Season 3.</i>

1545
01:12:12,745 --> 01:12:14,497
<i>The last match of the finals...</i>

1546
01:12:17,792 --> 01:12:19,919
<i>is Maze Craft.</i>

1547
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:23,631
- A maze?
- So we get a maze?

1548
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:25,675
GAME FROM SEASON 2
Like Three-layered Maze.

1549
01:12:26,092 --> 01:12:29,512
I read up on mazes.
I'm not sure how much I remember, though.

1550
01:12:29,595 --> 01:12:31,138
"Maze Craft"?

1551
01:12:31,222 --> 01:12:33,891
- So basically...
- We build a maze?

1552
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:35,601
<i>In Maze Craft,</i>

1553
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:40,022
<i>you will design a maze</i>
<i>for your opponents to memorize.</i>

1554
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:42,525
<i>The players will then memorize</i>
<i>the assigned map,</i>

1555
01:12:42,608 --> 01:12:44,777
<i>enter the empty board,</i>

1556
01:12:44,861 --> 01:12:47,238
<i>and find their way toward the target.</i>

1557
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:54,829
<i>There will be three rounds in total.</i>

1558
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:57,290
<i>Each round will be played</i>
<i>on a one-on-one basis.</i>

1559
01:12:57,957 --> 01:13:02,461
<i>The maze will be placed on a 9-by-9 board,</i>

1560
01:13:02,545 --> 01:13:04,839
<i>and you can use walls to shape it.</i>

1561
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:08,134
<i>You can use 45 walls in the first 2 rounds</i>

1562
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:11,971
<i>and 50 walls in the third round.</i>

1563
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:17,143
<i>Each team has to set up two points</i>
<i>as the destinations.</i>

1564
01:13:17,727 --> 01:13:20,730
<i>When the game begins,</i>

1565
01:13:20,813 --> 01:13:23,733
<i>both players will be given three minutes</i>

1566
01:13:23,816 --> 01:13:26,235
<i>to memorize the map of the maze</i>
<i>designed by their opponents.</i>

1567
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:30,948
<i>But please note that the destinations</i>
<i>will not be shown on the map.</i>

1568
01:13:34,118 --> 01:13:35,828
You can't memorize the route, then.

1569
01:13:38,873 --> 01:13:42,251
<i>After three minutes,</i>
<i>the destination will be presented.</i>

1570
01:13:42,335 --> 01:13:45,296
<i>The first player</i>
<i>will then go onto the board</i>

1571
01:13:45,379 --> 01:13:49,342
<i>where only the starting point</i>
<i>and the destination are marked.</i>

1572
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:51,344
<i>They must then head toward their goal.</i>

1573
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:53,763
<i>When the first player's turn ends,</i>

1574
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:57,433
<i>the second player will be given</i>
<i>an extra 20 seconds to study the map</i>

1575
01:13:57,516 --> 01:14:01,562
<i>and then go on to the board.</i>

1576
01:14:02,355 --> 01:14:05,733
<i>Each player's turn is completed</i>
<i>when they reach their first destination.</i>

1577
01:14:06,359 --> 01:14:10,321
<i>The second destination will be presented</i>
<i>at the start of their next turn.</i>

1578
01:14:11,030 --> 01:14:14,492
<i>You will be given ten seconds to complete</i>
<i>a move from one cell to the next.</i>

1579
01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:18,079
- Ten seconds?
- But that's too short.

1580
01:14:18,412 --> 01:14:21,415
<i>You can only move 1 cell every 10 seconds.</i>

1581
01:14:21,499 --> 01:14:23,501
<i>Once you make a move,</i>

1582
01:14:23,584 --> 01:14:26,253
<i>you cannot return to your original cell.</i>

1583
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:29,423
<i>If you fail to complete your move</i>
<i>within the time limit</i>

1584
01:14:29,507 --> 01:14:32,468
<i>or run into a wall,</i>

1585
01:14:32,551 --> 01:14:34,220
<i>your turn will be cut short.</i>

1586
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:37,932
<i>Your opponent</i>
<i>will then take their turn right away.</i>

1587
01:14:38,015 --> 01:14:41,394
<i>If you would like to review</i>
<i>the map of the maze,</i>

1588
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:44,105
<i>you can give up that turn</i>

1589
01:14:44,188 --> 01:14:47,400
<i>in exchange for 20 seconds to see the map.</i>

1590
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:50,403
<i>You gain one point</i>
<i>by reaching a destination.</i>

1591
01:14:50,611 --> 01:14:54,365
<i>The first player to obtain two points</i>
<i>wins the round.</i>

1592
01:14:55,908 --> 01:14:58,244
Reach two destinations, and you win.

1593
01:14:58,577 --> 01:15:02,498
<i>If both players win their second point</i>
<i>in the same turn,</i>

1594
01:15:02,581 --> 01:15:05,209
<i>the round will be considered a tie.</i>

1595
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:10,464
<i>Now, please start designing the maze</i>
<i>your opponent will have to memorize.</i>

1596
01:15:10,548 --> 01:15:13,467
<i>You'll be given 20 minutes.</i>

1597
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:15,886
We have two options.

1598
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:18,180
It's either A or B.
There's no middle ground.

1599
01:15:18,264 --> 01:15:19,974
First, a long and winding route.

1600
01:15:20,057 --> 01:15:21,183
Or the alternative is...

1601
01:15:21,267 --> 01:15:25,354
Well, we can add countless junctions
so they would be overwhelmed.

1602
01:15:25,438 --> 01:15:27,398
- The details matter in this game,
- True.

1603
01:15:27,481 --> 01:15:30,401
so a lot of junctions will make
a real challenge.

1604
01:15:30,484 --> 01:15:32,028
If we make the routes too clear,

1605
01:15:32,111 --> 01:15:35,114
- they'll memorize them no problem.
- They'll catch it right away.

1606
01:15:35,197 --> 01:15:37,783
Suppose the map looked like this.

1607
01:15:37,867 --> 01:15:40,870
Here's what I'll do for the three minutes.

1608
01:15:40,953 --> 01:15:42,455
I'll memorize this route.

1609
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:44,206
I can do it under three minutes.

1610
01:15:44,290 --> 01:15:46,500
- Of course.
- That's more than enough time.

1611
01:15:46,584 --> 01:15:47,460
ONLY ONE ROUTE IS OPEN

1612
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:49,503
In this case,
it's easy to guess the destinations.

1613
01:15:49,587 --> 01:15:53,340
Team SKKU could reach any of them
on the first try.

1614
01:15:53,424 --> 01:15:56,260
I think this design is better.

1615
01:15:56,343 --> 01:15:58,846
- I prefer a little chaos, too.
- A chaotic maze with winding routes.

1616
01:15:58,929 --> 01:16:00,056
That's the way to go.

1617
01:16:00,139 --> 01:16:02,767
- So we'll make a total mess
- Exactly.

1618
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:05,519
without any visible patterns
or recognizable routes?

1619
01:16:05,603 --> 01:16:06,771
That's exactly it.

1620
01:16:06,854 --> 01:16:09,273
Then, they have no choice
but to memorize the whole thing.

1621
01:16:09,356 --> 01:16:12,443
I want to plant a lot of false flags
for possible destinations as well.

1622
01:16:12,526 --> 01:16:15,488
Many C-shaped pockets
would give them trouble memorizing.

1623
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:17,823
Then, they would need
to review so many points

1624
01:16:17,907 --> 01:16:20,618
before they can reach their destination.

1625
01:16:20,701 --> 01:16:22,703
I doubt they could reach
both goals in one go.

1626
01:16:22,787 --> 01:16:25,039
Team SKKU could never crack a maze like
this.

1627
01:16:25,664 --> 01:16:28,000
Our strategy for Round 1 was

1628
01:16:28,084 --> 01:16:31,796
to make it difficult for Team SKKU
to predict the goal points.

1629
01:16:32,505 --> 01:16:34,799
<i>The randomly placed walls</i>

1630
01:16:34,882 --> 01:16:37,760
<i>might reduce</i>
<i>the total length of the routes,</i>

1631
01:16:37,843 --> 01:16:40,096
<i>but it would also impact predictability.</i>

1632
01:16:40,179 --> 01:16:42,556
Our goal was to design the maze

1633
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:45,768
<i>to force the opponent</i>
<i>to ask to see the map again.</i>

1634
01:16:46,519 --> 01:16:48,938
Hey, I love this.
The route goes on forever.

1635
01:16:49,105 --> 01:16:50,272
This is it.

1636
01:16:50,356 --> 01:16:51,482
2 SIDES OF THE ENTRY POINT
BLOCKED BY WALLS

1637
01:16:51,565 --> 01:16:52,817
So we go in here...

1638
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:56,445
THE WALLS WILL FORCE THE PLAYER
TO TAKE A LONG DETOUR

1639
01:16:57,196 --> 01:17:01,408
THE PLAYER WOULD HAVE TO MEMORIZE
A 37-CELL ROUTE TO REACH THE TARGET

1640
01:17:02,243 --> 01:17:06,789
We thought the chances of messing up
was tied to the traveling distance.

1641
01:17:06,872 --> 01:17:08,290
<i>As a result,</i>

1642
01:17:08,374 --> 01:17:11,252
<i>we tried to design the maze</i>
<i>to have long, winding paths.</i>

1643
01:17:11,335 --> 01:17:12,461
ROUTES EXTENDED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE

1644
01:17:12,545 --> 01:17:14,338
TEAM SNU: COMPLEX MAZE
WITH A LOT OF JUNCTIONS

1645
01:17:14,421 --> 01:17:16,048
TEAM SKKU: MAZE WITH ONE LONG ROUTE

1646
01:17:16,382 --> 01:17:18,467
- Let's seal the road midway.
- Good idea.

1647
01:17:18,551 --> 01:17:20,386
This point would be ideal.

1648
01:17:20,803 --> 01:17:23,347
<i>All we could do so far was</i>
<i>to cheer for the participants</i>

1649
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:25,057
<i>if you were not playing the game.</i>

1650
01:17:25,141 --> 01:17:27,893
But in Maze Craft, the maze designers

1651
01:17:27,977 --> 01:17:30,688
also had an important role,
though we never entered the maze.

1652
01:17:31,147 --> 01:17:33,440
<i>All four of us had to pull our weight.</i>

1653
01:17:33,524 --> 01:17:34,650
DESIGNERS: SUNG TAE-HUN, KIM DONG-YEON

1654
01:17:34,942 --> 01:17:36,652
It should be you and me.

1655
01:17:36,735 --> 01:17:37,736
PLAYERS: KANG JI-HU, LEE DONG-JAE

1656
01:17:38,237 --> 01:17:41,240
Here's how I'm going to memorize the maze.

1657
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:43,033
I'll imprint the map in my mind.

1658
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:45,411
<i>Simple memorization isn't my forte,</i>

1659
01:17:45,911 --> 01:17:49,039
but I'm good with figures and routes.

1660
01:17:49,498 --> 01:17:52,918
I felt certain
that this was the game I could shine in.

1661
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:55,045
Who's going to play for us?

1662
01:17:55,129 --> 01:17:57,923
- Someone with good memory.
- I don't feel good about mine.

1663
01:17:58,007 --> 01:18:00,092
If you guys are out,

1664
01:18:00,176 --> 01:18:02,011
it's up to Seung-hyeon and me.

1665
01:18:02,094 --> 01:18:04,096
I think I'd do better
as the second player.

1666
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:06,140
I'll tackle Round 1.
You can practice some more.

1667
01:18:06,223 --> 01:18:07,474
Would it be better to go second?

1668
01:18:07,558 --> 01:18:09,310
- Except for the 20 seconds--
- It's better for her.

1669
01:18:09,393 --> 01:18:11,645
I can refresh my memory during their turn.

1670
01:18:11,729 --> 01:18:13,606
- I see.
- Given the way I memorize,

1671
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:14,773
the memory doesn't fade.

1672
01:18:14,857 --> 01:18:17,735
- It only grows stronger with time.
- Really?

1673
01:18:17,818 --> 01:18:21,030
Seo-yeon can play in Round 1
because she can choose the order then.

1674
01:18:21,113 --> 01:18:22,281
Okay.

1675
01:18:23,032 --> 01:18:24,617
I'll do my best.

1676
01:18:24,992 --> 01:18:27,119
- You've got this.
- Of course.

1677
01:18:27,203 --> 01:18:28,037
If you find it rough,

1678
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:30,164
- they'll think it's hellish.
- For sure.

1679
01:18:30,956 --> 01:18:33,375
<i>Your time is up.</i>

1680
01:18:33,751 --> 01:18:35,419
<i>Players participating in Round 1,</i>

1681
01:18:35,502 --> 01:18:38,047
<i>please come to the main hall.</i>

1682
01:18:38,339 --> 01:18:40,382
- Good luck.
- I'll do my best.

1683
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:43,010
- You've got this.
- Thanks, guys.

1684
01:18:43,093 --> 01:18:44,053
You're a genius.

1685
01:18:44,136 --> 01:18:45,304
- Of course.
- One, two, three.

1686
01:18:45,596 --> 01:18:47,473
- Let's go, SNU!
- Let's go, SNU!

1687
01:18:47,806 --> 01:18:48,933
Show them what you've got!

1688
01:18:49,016 --> 01:18:50,392
- Show them!
- You've got this!

1689
01:18:50,476 --> 01:18:51,435
Wish me luck.

1690
01:18:51,518 --> 01:18:53,103
- Good luck, Ji-hu!
- Come here, Ji-hu.

1691
01:18:53,187 --> 01:18:54,897
- Let's do a cheer for him.
- You'll do fine.

1692
01:18:55,147 --> 01:18:57,441
- SKKU!
- SKKU!

1693
01:18:58,484 --> 01:18:59,360
No pressure. Good luck.

1694
01:18:59,443 --> 01:19:01,654
You placed first in the pre-test, Ji-hu.

1695
01:19:01,946 --> 01:19:04,114
<i>No one here is your match.</i>

1696
01:19:05,824 --> 01:19:07,701
Hello.

1697
01:19:08,118 --> 01:19:11,538
Memorization is one of my strengths.

1698
01:19:11,622 --> 01:19:15,000
<i>But it was a match for the finals</i>
<i>played in one-on-one basis.</i>

1699
01:19:15,084 --> 01:19:17,294
<i>So I felt more determined</i>

1700
01:19:17,378 --> 01:19:20,547
<i>to deliver a good performance</i>
<i>and defeat Ji-hu.</i>

1701
01:19:20,631 --> 01:19:23,926
<i>This is the last game</i>
<i>of Elite League Season 3.</i>

1702
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:26,845
<i>I'm going to lead my team to victory</i>
<i>no matter what.</i>

1703
01:19:28,472 --> 01:19:31,350
Before we begin,
Team SNU in Medicine's player will decide

1704
01:19:31,433 --> 01:19:35,229
on the player order
as you lost the second match.

1705
01:19:35,312 --> 01:19:37,898
Please make your choice.

1706
01:19:38,190 --> 01:19:40,484
I'll go second.

1707
01:19:40,943 --> 01:19:42,319
It's not bad to go first.

1708
01:19:42,403 --> 01:19:43,696
It's for the better.

1709
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:45,239
She'll do fine.

1710
01:19:45,698 --> 01:19:48,492
Seo-yeon is super brilliant.

1711
01:19:48,575 --> 01:19:50,911
You will now be given three minutes

1712
01:19:50,995 --> 01:19:53,872
to study the maps.

1713
01:19:56,083 --> 01:19:58,585
MAZE DESIGNED BY TEAM SKKU

1714
01:20:01,297 --> 01:20:04,174
MAZE DESIGNED BY TEAM SNU

1715
01:20:04,258 --> 01:20:07,594
DESTINATION WILL BE REVEALED
JUST BEFORE DEPARTURE

1716
01:20:07,678 --> 01:20:10,389
MAZE DESIGNED BY TEAM SKKU

1717
01:20:10,472 --> 01:20:12,725
<i>I divided the whole maze</i>
<i>into nine sections.</i>

1718
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:14,560
<i>After memorizing the walls in Section 1,</i>

1719
01:20:14,643 --> 01:20:16,353
<i>I moved on to Section 2.</i>

1720
01:20:16,437 --> 01:20:19,356
<i>That's how I covered the whole map.</i>

1721
01:20:20,399 --> 01:20:21,859
MAZE DESIGNED BY TEAM SNU

1722
01:20:21,942 --> 01:20:24,111
<i>One look at their maze told me</i>

1723
01:20:24,194 --> 01:20:26,947
<i>that there were</i>
<i>a lot of routes branching out.</i>

1724
01:20:27,031 --> 01:20:29,408
I tried to name the shapes
the routes formed.

1725
01:20:29,491 --> 01:20:31,493
If I found a route curving this way,

1726
01:20:32,036 --> 01:20:33,579
I memorized that part as number five.

1727
01:20:33,787 --> 01:20:35,622
<i>If I found a part</i>
<i>that looked like number three</i>

1728
01:20:35,706 --> 01:20:39,668
<i>or other particular shapes,</i>
<i>I tried to use them as a memory aid.</i>

1729
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:43,630
This won't give Ji-hu any problem.

1730
01:20:43,714 --> 01:20:46,300
But it's not the kind of map
I find comfortable memorizing.

1731
01:20:46,633 --> 01:20:48,093
Right, I see a mass of three-cell blocks.

1732
01:20:48,177 --> 01:20:50,679
And the trend continues
even in the upper rows.

1733
01:20:50,763 --> 01:20:53,307
This is exactly the kind of map
Ji-hu called easy to memorize, no?

1734
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:55,351
- It's a prime example.
- Right.

1735
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:57,770
- Did you reach the stop in one go?
- Yeah.

1736
01:20:57,853 --> 01:20:59,146
REACHED DESTINATION IN ONE GO
IN A MOCK MAZE

1737
01:20:59,229 --> 01:21:02,733
I'll tell you how I did it.
I went four cells to the right.

1738
01:21:02,816 --> 01:21:05,861
I moved up until I hit the fourth row
and then took a turn.

1739
01:21:05,944 --> 01:21:09,198
I stopped at the fourth column.
Then, I moved down four cells.

1740
01:21:09,281 --> 01:21:10,532
So many four-cell blocks.

1741
01:21:11,992 --> 01:21:14,912
<i>Ji-hu will crush it</i>
<i>since he's great at finding such patterns.</i>

1742
01:21:14,995 --> 01:21:16,372
KANG JI-HU FAVORS THIS TYPE OF MAP

1743
01:21:17,289 --> 01:21:19,541
- This doesn't look so bad.
- I agree.

1744
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:22,252
<i>The destination has to be</i>
<i>somewhere inside this box.</i>

1745
01:21:22,336 --> 01:21:25,214
<i>- I think so, too.</i>
<i>- So she can focus on this route</i>

1746
01:21:25,297 --> 01:21:27,257
<i>and leave out the outer sections.</i>

1747
01:21:27,341 --> 01:21:28,425
PRIORITIZING THE PATH
TO LIKELY DESTINATION

1748
01:21:28,509 --> 01:21:29,676
They took a different approach.

1749
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:31,553
Definitely. I can't say who will win.

1750
01:21:31,929 --> 01:21:33,430
<i>I still think Seo-yeon will do great.</i>

1751
01:21:33,514 --> 01:21:36,809
<i>She's more than capable of memorizing it.</i>

1752
01:21:38,435 --> 01:21:41,063
Your time is up.

1753
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:44,900
Team SKKU's Kang Ji-hu,
please head to the entry point.

1754
01:21:51,323 --> 01:21:53,534
Here is your first destination.

1755
01:21:56,662 --> 01:21:59,248
I'm sure he felt thrown off
when that place lit up.

1756
01:21:59,331 --> 01:22:01,458
RATHER THAN POCKET AREAS

1757
01:22:01,542 --> 01:22:04,920
AN OPEN CELL WAS SELECTED
AS THE DESTINATION

1758
01:22:05,003 --> 01:22:07,423
<i>You never know, though. He's very bright.</i>

1759
01:22:08,465 --> 01:22:12,886
Team SKKU's Kang Ji-hu,
please head into the maze.

1760
01:22:22,146 --> 01:22:24,773
So he memorized this path.

1761
01:22:29,987 --> 01:22:31,989
Great, he knows his way.

1762
01:22:33,115 --> 01:22:35,284
He's using that tactic
he used during practice runs.

1763
01:22:35,367 --> 01:22:39,246
USING THE CELL CLUSTER TACTICS
HE USED WHILE PRACTICING

1764
01:22:39,329 --> 01:22:40,831
3 CELLS, 3 CELLS

1765
01:22:40,914 --> 01:22:41,957
He's almost there.

1766
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:43,333
This is bad.

1767
01:22:43,959 --> 01:22:45,335
I can't believe he memorized it all.

1768
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:55,637
ONLY 2 CELLS REMAIN UNTIL HIS DESTINATION

1769
01:22:56,013 --> 01:22:58,390
You have five seconds left.

1770
01:23:08,150 --> 01:23:10,611
Team SKKU's Kang Ji-hu
reached his destination.

1771
01:23:10,694 --> 01:23:12,237
TEAM SKKU'S KANG JI-HU SUCCEEDED

1772
01:23:12,779 --> 01:23:16,617
<i>Team SNU in Medicine's maze</i>
<i>had a very different design from ours,</i>

1773
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:20,245
<i>but it was surprisingly easy</i>
<i>for me to memorize.</i>

1774
01:23:21,205 --> 01:23:22,998
Ji-hu sure is something else.

1775
01:23:23,081 --> 01:23:24,917
- We're good.
- You bet we are.

1776
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,127
We're really good. We can actually win.

1777
01:23:27,211 --> 01:23:29,838
There's no doubt about our skills.

1778
01:23:29,922 --> 01:23:31,590
It's all about how good they are.

1779
01:23:31,673 --> 01:23:32,508
If they are good,

1780
01:23:32,591 --> 01:23:34,635
- we have to step up our game.
- Of course.

1781
01:23:34,718 --> 01:23:36,970
- Let's make a beast of a maze.
- Yes.

1782
01:23:37,387 --> 01:23:39,848
Ji-hu is incredible.

1783
01:23:39,932 --> 01:23:43,435
How did he manage
to memorize such a messy maze

1784
01:23:43,519 --> 01:23:45,812
when there are no routes that stand out?

1785
01:23:46,438 --> 01:23:49,525
Team SNU in Medicine's Han Seo-yeon
will now take her turn.

1786
01:23:51,568 --> 01:23:54,696
You can study the map
for the next 20 seconds.

1787
01:23:54,947 --> 01:23:57,407
Please check the map in front of you.

1788
01:23:58,659 --> 01:24:01,954
MAZE DESIGNED BY TEAM SKKU

1789
01:24:07,334 --> 01:24:08,669
She can easily crush this.

1790
01:24:09,044 --> 01:24:11,338
The time for memorization is over.

1791
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:14,633
Please head to the entry point.

1792
01:24:17,886 --> 01:24:20,222
Here is your first destination.

1793
01:24:22,975 --> 01:24:26,478
EVEN THE SHORTEST PATH TO THE DESTINATION
TAKES HER 35 CELLS

1794
01:24:26,728 --> 01:24:28,814
Our maze looks pretty solid.

1795
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:31,733
Her only choice is
to take the long detour.

1796
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:35,904
Team SNU in Medicine's Han Seo-yeon,
please head into the maze.

1797
01:24:42,286 --> 01:24:44,788
<i>She must know</i>
<i>she has to move four cells at first.</i>

1798
01:24:55,382 --> 01:24:57,259
You have five seconds left.

1799
01:24:57,801 --> 01:24:59,052
I don't think she remembers it.

1800
01:24:59,136 --> 01:25:00,262
Maybe she forgot.

1801
01:25:00,345 --> 01:25:02,264
No, that can't be it.

1802
01:25:02,723 --> 01:25:04,725
- She can take her time.
- Of course.

1803
01:25:11,023 --> 01:25:12,107
You have five seconds left.

1804
01:25:18,947 --> 01:25:20,824
You have five seconds left.

1805
01:25:24,202 --> 01:25:26,788
<i>You would expect the memory to fade</i>

1806
01:25:26,872 --> 01:25:29,625
<i>and leave the player at a disadvantage</i>
<i>if their start is delayed.</i>

1807
01:25:29,708 --> 01:25:33,045
But in my case,
I usually review what I have memorized

1808
01:25:33,128 --> 01:25:37,799
to consolidate the memory, if you will.

1809
01:25:37,883 --> 01:25:41,386
<i>That's why I tried to take as much time</i>
<i>as I could while on the board.</i>

1810
01:25:45,724 --> 01:25:48,560
She must know the way.
She's just taking her sweet time.

1811
01:25:51,396 --> 01:25:53,857
- I think she's double-checking her route.
- Right.

1812
01:26:01,907 --> 01:26:03,283
You have five seconds left.

1813
01:26:06,870 --> 01:26:08,163
She's going that way?

1814
01:26:08,246 --> 01:26:10,957
I guess she's taking the shortest path.

1815
01:26:15,379 --> 01:26:16,838
You have five seconds left.

1816
01:26:20,258 --> 01:26:21,760
<i>She's almost there.</i>

1817
01:26:21,843 --> 01:26:23,970
- She has to make a big C, right?
- Yeah.

1818
01:26:24,054 --> 01:26:25,806
Man, she's good.

1819
01:26:25,889 --> 01:26:29,309
Damn, she's got skills.
Now I'm getting nervous.

1820
01:26:30,644 --> 01:26:32,354
You have five seconds left.

1821
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:49,746
I bet she'll reach the goal.
She's gotten this far.

1822
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:55,669
You have five seconds left.

1823
01:26:59,548 --> 01:27:02,926
Your time is up.

1824
01:27:10,976 --> 01:27:12,352
<i>Please return to your seat.</i>

1825
01:27:12,769 --> 01:27:15,439
That's a major mistake.

1826
01:27:15,522 --> 01:27:17,482
I'm worried she'll fall apart.

1827
01:27:17,566 --> 01:27:20,777
<i>I guess she was too cautious.</i>

1828
01:27:20,861 --> 01:27:22,571
- Nice. Come on, Ji-hu.
- Great.

1829
01:27:22,654 --> 01:27:25,073
If Ji-hu reaches his goal,
we win the round.

1830
01:27:25,157 --> 01:27:28,118
Team SKKU's Kang Ji-hu
will now take his turn.

1831
01:27:31,621 --> 01:27:35,125
<i>My gut told me the round was mine.</i>

1832
01:27:35,208 --> 01:27:37,377
Here is your second destination.

1833
01:27:40,005 --> 01:27:41,339
Please head into the maze.

1834
01:27:48,889 --> 01:27:51,683
He can basically reuse his earlier route.

1835
01:27:52,517 --> 01:27:55,270
Maybe he found our map too easy.

1836
01:27:55,562 --> 01:28:00,525
KANG JI-HU USES THE PATH
HE PREVIOUSLY USED AS A GUIDE

1837
01:28:07,908 --> 01:28:09,117
You have five seconds left.

1838
01:28:11,453 --> 01:28:12,579
TEAM SKKU'S KANG JI-HU FAILED

1839
01:28:12,662 --> 01:28:13,789
You took a wrong turn.

1840
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:18,251
KANG JI-HU CROSSED A WALL

1841
01:28:20,212 --> 01:28:21,421
- Great.
- Oh, my.

1842
01:28:21,505 --> 01:28:23,131
Lucky us.

1843
01:28:23,215 --> 01:28:25,509
You hit a dead end
and cannot proceed further.

1844
01:28:25,967 --> 01:28:27,636
Please return to your seat.

1845
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:30,305
What's nasty about this game

1846
01:28:30,388 --> 01:28:32,933
is that you can only see the map once.

1847
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:34,935
- Your memory fades.
- In the second turn, especially.

1848
01:28:36,853 --> 01:28:38,104
Did I get something wrong?

1849
01:28:39,648 --> 01:28:42,567
Team SNU in Medicine's Han Seo-yeon
will now take her turn.

1850
01:28:43,235 --> 01:28:45,028
I'd like to use the Review Map card.

1851
01:28:46,446 --> 01:28:49,741
You can study the map
for the next 20 seconds.

1852
01:28:50,367 --> 01:28:53,328
<i>I got flustered during my first turn,</i>

1853
01:28:53,411 --> 01:28:56,414
<i>and the details of the map</i>
<i>got a little fuzzy.</i>

1854
01:28:57,374 --> 01:29:00,126
<i>I felt that I had no choice</i>
<i>but to check the map again,</i>

1855
01:29:00,210 --> 01:29:01,837
<i>so I used the special item.</i>

1856
01:29:02,045 --> 01:29:05,006
In the end, she chose to spend 20 seconds
reviewing the map.

1857
01:29:05,090 --> 01:29:09,219
Team SKKU already won a point,
but we have nothing.

1858
01:29:09,302 --> 01:29:15,308
MAZE DESIGNED BY TEAM SKKU

1859
01:29:17,185 --> 01:29:18,895
Your time is up.

1860
01:29:21,314 --> 01:29:24,526
Team SKKU's Kang Ji-hu
will now take his turn.

1861
01:29:24,985 --> 01:29:26,903
I'd like to use the Review Map card.

1862
01:29:26,987 --> 01:29:30,615
KANG JI-HU MAKES THE SAME CHOICE
AS HAN SEO-YEON

1863
01:29:32,701 --> 01:29:34,077
He's checking the map, too.

1864
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:36,079
He's going to finish the game
in his next turn.

1865
01:29:36,746 --> 01:29:38,915
Even if he succeeds in his next turn,

1866
01:29:38,999 --> 01:29:42,919
Seo-yeon can still get us a tie
by reaching her destination back-to-back.

1867
01:29:43,003 --> 01:29:44,462
THIS IS BECAUSE HAN SEO-YEON
IS THE SECOND PLAYER

1868
01:29:44,671 --> 01:29:46,381
- Right.
- Since she went second.

1869
01:29:46,464 --> 01:29:48,133
Absolutely, it's not over yet.

1870
01:29:48,216 --> 01:29:50,635
She didn't lose just yet.
She can get us a tie.

1871
01:29:51,011 --> 01:29:54,347
You can study the map
for the next 20 seconds.

1872
01:29:59,311 --> 01:30:02,606
MAZE DESIGNED BY TEAM SNU

1873
01:30:05,191 --> 01:30:06,902
Your time is up.

1874
01:30:07,569 --> 01:30:11,114
Team SNU in Medicine's Han Seo-yeon
will now take her turn.

1875
01:30:15,785 --> 01:30:18,413
Here is your first destination.

1876
01:30:27,088 --> 01:30:30,884
HAN SEO-YEON HAS TO SUCCEED IN THIS TURN

1877
01:30:31,217 --> 01:30:33,345
I think she'll reach the goal this time.

1878
01:30:33,428 --> 01:30:34,387
I think so, too.

1879
01:30:36,556 --> 01:30:41,269
MAKING QUICK PROGRESS TOWARD THE GOAL

1880
01:30:43,813 --> 01:30:47,484
THIS IS THE POINT
SHE MADE THE ERROR EARLIER

1881
01:30:51,446 --> 01:30:54,574
HAN SEO-YEON PASSED THE POINT
AND PROCEEDS TO HER DESTINATION

1882
01:31:02,332 --> 01:31:04,417
- There we go.
- Looking good.

1883
01:31:04,501 --> 01:31:05,877
You're smart.

1884
01:31:05,961 --> 01:31:08,213
- You're the best, Seo-yeon.
- You're incredible.

1885
01:31:08,630 --> 01:31:10,966
You have five seconds left.

1886
01:31:15,929 --> 01:31:18,765
It looks like she'll have it easy
with the second destination.

1887
01:31:18,848 --> 01:31:19,849
DESTINATION 1, DESTINATION 2

1888
01:31:19,933 --> 01:31:22,227
<i>- Right.</i>
<i>- She'll probably get there in one go.</i>

1889
01:31:29,776 --> 01:31:31,903
- There we go.
- She'll take one more step, right?

1890
01:31:34,739 --> 01:31:36,700
ONLY 1 CELL REMAINS

1891
01:31:40,370 --> 01:31:43,581
Team SNU in Medicine's Han Seo-yeon
reached her destination.

1892
01:31:46,626 --> 01:31:48,753
<i>You're the best, Seo-yeon.</i>

1893
01:31:48,837 --> 01:31:50,005
<i>That's no mean feat,</i>

1894
01:31:50,088 --> 01:31:53,425
memorizing a whole route on the spot.

1895
01:31:53,508 --> 01:31:56,761
Team SKKU's Kang Ji-hu
will now take his turn.

1896
01:32:00,807 --> 01:32:03,018
Here is your second destination.

1897
01:32:09,649 --> 01:32:12,152
He looks so assured.
I bet he has the map in his memory.

1898
01:32:22,620 --> 01:32:25,457
THIS IS THE POINT
HE MADE THE ERROR EARLIER

1899
01:32:26,166 --> 01:32:27,917
KANG JI-HU PASSES THE POINT

1900
01:32:28,418 --> 01:32:29,711
<i>As long as he doesn't mess up...</i>

1901
01:32:40,013 --> 01:32:44,601
Team SKKU's Kang Ji-hu
reached his second destination.

1902
01:32:47,312 --> 01:32:49,022
<i>It was easier than I expected it to be.</i>

1903
01:32:49,105 --> 01:32:50,690
<i>That gave me the confidence.</i>

1904
01:32:51,816 --> 01:32:53,151
Ji-hu has mad skills.

1905
01:32:53,234 --> 01:32:55,904
The more I look at it,
the more satisfied I am with our map.

1906
01:32:55,987 --> 01:32:57,447
Yeah, we did a solid job.

1907
01:32:57,530 --> 01:32:58,615
We knew that was coming.

1908
01:32:58,698 --> 01:33:00,283
Imagine the pressure she must be under.

1909
01:33:00,366 --> 01:33:02,160
She crossed the board only recently.

1910
01:33:02,243 --> 01:33:03,995
I bet it's still fresh in her memory.

1911
01:33:04,079 --> 01:33:05,872
SHE CAN GET A TIE
Team SNU in Medicine's Han Seo-yeon

1912
01:33:05,955 --> 01:33:07,582
will now take her turn.

1913
01:33:09,167 --> 01:33:11,252
Here is your second destination.

1914
01:33:19,010 --> 01:33:20,553
- That's not too bad.
- It's here.

1915
01:33:21,096 --> 01:33:22,555
<i>She can reuse the path from earlier...</i>

1916
01:33:22,639 --> 01:33:23,556
<i>And remember this part.</i>

1917
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:25,517
<i>That's pretty distinctive,</i>
<i>so it won't be so hard.</i>

1918
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:26,851
2ND GOAL IS CLOSE TO THE 1ST GOAL

1919
01:33:27,227 --> 01:33:30,063
Team SNU in Medicine's Han Seo-yeon,
please head into the maze.

1920
01:33:37,195 --> 01:33:38,446
You have five seconds left.

1921
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:43,743
You have five seconds left.

1922
01:33:48,414 --> 01:33:53,044
Come on. We'd appreciate it
if you mistook a turn.

1923
01:34:07,934 --> 01:34:09,018
You took a wrong turn.

1924
01:34:09,102 --> 01:34:10,603
TEAM SNU'S HAN SEO-YEON FAILED

1925
01:34:17,110 --> 01:34:19,529
- I don't get why she went there, though.
- Same.

1926
01:34:19,612 --> 01:34:23,074
I don't think she expected
the second goal to be here.

1927
01:34:23,575 --> 01:34:26,369
- Seriously, though...
- Did we do a good job or what?

1928
01:34:26,452 --> 01:34:27,287
- You did.
- Dong-jae.

1929
01:34:32,917 --> 01:34:35,628
<i>The fact that Ji-hu reached</i>
<i>his second goal right away got to me,</i>

1930
01:34:35,712 --> 01:34:38,298
<i>and my memory had faded somewhat.</i>

1931
01:34:38,590 --> 01:34:41,801
<i>I didn't have a clear picture</i>
<i>of the map at that point.</i>

1932
01:34:42,427 --> 01:34:44,262
That concludes Round 1.

1933
01:34:44,345 --> 01:34:47,223
Team SKKU's Kang Ji-hu won.

1934
01:34:48,266 --> 01:34:49,601
<i>My team won Round 1.</i>

1935
01:34:49,684 --> 01:34:52,478
<i>So if we could keep the momentum going,</i>

1936
01:34:52,562 --> 01:34:55,857
I thought we could easily win Round 2
and become the final winners.

1937
01:34:57,400 --> 01:34:58,818
- Great job, dude.
- Hey, Ji-hu.

1938
01:34:58,902 --> 01:35:00,486
- Well done.
- You were amazing.

1939
01:35:00,570 --> 01:35:03,489
Our maze design turned out
to be pretty effective.

1940
01:35:03,573 --> 01:35:07,327
We realized the importance
of the maze design.

1941
01:35:07,410 --> 01:35:10,205
<i>We wanted to prepare</i>
<i>a terrifyingly difficult maze for Round 2</i>

1942
01:35:10,288 --> 01:35:14,083
<i>to lessen Dong-jae's burden.</i>

1943
01:35:15,084 --> 01:35:18,296
We're going in the right direction.
The path should be long.

1944
01:35:18,379 --> 01:35:20,632
Yes, we need longer routes.

1945
01:35:21,007 --> 01:35:25,136
TEAM SKKU'S STRATEGY STAYS THE SAME
With a wall here. And then...

1946
01:35:25,386 --> 01:35:26,763
Shoot, I'm so sorry.

1947
01:35:26,846 --> 01:35:28,223
- Don't say that.
- You did fine.

1948
01:35:28,306 --> 01:35:30,225
I should've prioritized the routes.

1949
01:35:30,308 --> 01:35:32,852
But I couldn't be sure
which points would be my destinations.

1950
01:35:32,936 --> 01:35:37,023
So I tried to take in the full picture
and then memorize the maze as a whole.

1951
01:35:37,106 --> 01:35:39,150
I should've divided up my time better.

1952
01:35:39,234 --> 01:35:40,818
- I guess we should look at routes.
- Yes.

1953
01:35:40,902 --> 01:35:44,197
If I had done that,
I would've reached my destinations.

1954
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:46,658
The right approach is
to focus on possible routes, then.

1955
01:35:47,408 --> 01:35:51,746
I thought it wouldn't be wise
to reuse the strategy that led to defeat.

1956
01:35:51,829 --> 01:35:55,959
So we decided to emulate Team SKKU's idea
of making a long and winding maze

1957
01:35:56,209 --> 01:36:01,005
<i>so that the opponent would make a mistake</i>
<i>while making their way through the maze.</i>

1958
01:36:02,632 --> 01:36:04,133
This looks complex enough.

1959
01:36:04,467 --> 01:36:06,427
This is the only path available
to reach this spot.

1960
01:36:06,511 --> 01:36:09,222
- It's a huge challenge.
- They will mess up for sure.

1961
01:36:09,555 --> 01:36:12,100
May the best player win.
There's no other way around it.

1962
01:36:12,183 --> 01:36:15,270
We have to turn it into a memory game
and hope that I win.

1963
01:36:15,353 --> 01:36:18,815
<i>My team is in a very precarious position.</i>

1964
01:36:18,898 --> 01:36:21,943
But I'm confident
I can beat anyone from Team SKKU.

1965
01:36:22,026 --> 01:36:23,820
I will return triumphant.

1966
01:36:24,779 --> 01:36:26,364
Please be our hero for the day.

1967
01:36:26,447 --> 01:36:27,949
Good luck.

1968
01:36:28,408 --> 01:36:30,410
<i>Your time is up.</i>

1969
01:36:30,493 --> 01:36:31,953
- Go crush them.
- Good luck.

1970
01:36:32,036 --> 01:36:32,954
Enjoy the game.

1971
01:36:33,037 --> 01:36:35,206
Have fun out there, Dong-jae.

1972
01:36:39,752 --> 01:36:41,879
- Good luck.
- You've got this.

1973
01:36:42,755 --> 01:36:44,132
<i>It's Seung-hyeon, all right.</i>

1974
01:36:44,215 --> 01:36:45,216
<i>As expected.</i>

1975
01:36:45,925 --> 01:36:47,719
BOTH ARE ALUMNI OF SEOUL SCIENCE HIGH
Dang, their pride is at stake.

1976
01:36:47,802 --> 01:36:50,096
Give him all you've got, Dong-jae.

1977
01:36:50,179 --> 01:36:51,514
<i>Show him what you're made of.</i>

1978
01:36:52,473 --> 01:36:55,560
We will now begin Round 2 of Maze Craft.

1979
01:36:56,978 --> 01:36:59,522
Before we begin,
Team SNU in Medicine's player will decide

1980
01:36:59,605 --> 01:37:03,359
on the player order
as you lost the previous round.

1981
01:37:03,443 --> 01:37:04,777
I'll go second.

1982
01:37:05,778 --> 01:37:09,490
You will now be given three minutes
to study the maps in front of you.

1983
01:37:14,912 --> 01:37:18,207
MAZE DESIGNED BY TEAM SNU

1984
01:37:18,708 --> 01:37:20,501
They made it too easy for us, no?

1985
01:37:20,585 --> 01:37:23,755
Guys, this is so similar
to the one we made in Round 1.

1986
01:37:23,838 --> 01:37:25,715
- Dong-jae has this in the bag.
- You bet.

1987
01:37:25,798 --> 01:37:27,091
This is the best-case scenario.

1988
01:37:27,175 --> 01:37:29,552
- He'll win no problem.
- You bet.

1989
01:37:30,553 --> 01:37:34,974
<i>I personally found it easier</i>
<i>to memorize a long and winding path.</i>

1990
01:37:35,058 --> 01:37:39,020
<i>The map gave me confidence</i>
<i>that I could really do well in Round 2.</i>

1991
01:37:40,104 --> 01:37:42,648
I'd like to know
Seung-hyeon's memorization method.

1992
01:37:42,732 --> 01:37:46,319
Both teams are using the same plan,
so I think he would be well-prepared.

1993
01:37:47,987 --> 01:37:50,615
<i>Instead of the walls,</i>
<i>I focused on the open sections.</i>

1994
01:37:50,698 --> 01:37:51,616
<i>For example,</i>

1995
01:37:51,699 --> 01:37:54,660
the puzzle pieces in Tetris
have four connected squares.

1996
01:37:54,952 --> 01:37:57,997
<i>I grouped the crossable cells</i>
<i>into four-cell blocks</i>

1997
01:37:58,081 --> 01:38:00,124
<i>and memorized their shapes and placements.</i>

1998
01:38:00,208 --> 01:38:02,377
<i>As long as I could remember</i>

1999
01:38:02,460 --> 01:38:05,380
<i>the points I could safely cross</i>
<i>to move from one shape to another,</i>

2000
01:38:05,463 --> 01:38:07,090
I could find my way easily.

2001
01:38:07,173 --> 01:38:09,217
That was my strategy.

2002
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:12,887
LEE SEUNG-HYEON MEMORIZES
THE SHAPES AND THE CONNECTING POINTS

2003
01:38:13,638 --> 01:38:15,515
It looks like a piece of cake
for Seung-hyeon.

2004
01:38:15,598 --> 01:38:18,017
It will be a walk in the park for him.

2005
01:38:18,559 --> 01:38:20,895
Your time is up.

2006
01:38:21,187 --> 01:38:22,980
Team SKKU's Lee Dong-jae.

2007
01:38:23,481 --> 01:38:25,066
Please head to the entry point.

2008
01:38:26,776 --> 01:38:29,070
Here is your first destination.

2009
01:38:29,487 --> 01:38:32,281
Team SKKU's Lee Dong-jae,
please head into the maze.

2010
01:38:36,911 --> 01:38:37,912
Good luck, Dong-jae.

2011
01:38:37,995 --> 01:38:39,163
You've got this, Dong-jae.

2012
01:38:39,247 --> 01:38:41,249
He won't let us down.

2013
01:38:54,595 --> 01:39:00,601
LEE DONG-JAE APPROACHES
HIS DESTINATION SPEEDILY

2014
01:39:03,438 --> 01:39:06,816
<i>He won't have any trouble</i>
<i>reaching the upper row.</i>

2015
01:39:18,161 --> 01:39:21,205
LEE DONG-JAE STOPS FOR THE FIRST TIME

2016
01:39:22,457 --> 01:39:24,417
Look, he has to stop and think.

2017
01:39:24,834 --> 01:39:26,794
Come on, just one more step upward.

2018
01:39:31,090 --> 01:39:34,218
TEAM SKKU'S LEE DONG-JAE FAILED

2019
01:39:34,302 --> 01:39:36,429
- Hey, he failed.
- Yes, he did.

2020
01:39:36,721 --> 01:39:38,347
- Oh, shoot.
- Such a shame.

2021
01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:40,099
He needed to take one more step.

2022
01:39:40,808 --> 01:39:43,186
You hit a dead end
and cannot proceed further.

2023
01:39:43,603 --> 01:39:45,354
Please return to your seat.

2024
01:39:47,482 --> 01:39:50,568
Let me think. What went wrong there?

2025
01:39:52,153 --> 01:39:53,863
- We did a fine job with the maze.
- Yeah.

2026
01:39:53,946 --> 01:39:55,156
- It's a good design.
- We did well.

2027
01:39:55,239 --> 01:39:57,783
It's the ultimate mind-boggling maze.

2028
01:39:57,867 --> 01:40:00,119
I'm relieved. I'm sure Seung-hyeon
will wrap this up in two turns.

2029
01:40:00,203 --> 01:40:01,370
- I know.
- Right?

2030
01:40:01,454 --> 01:40:04,957
Team SNU in Medicine's Lee Seung-hyeon
will now take her turn.

2031
01:40:05,791 --> 01:40:09,170
You can study the map
for the next 20 seconds.

2032
01:40:09,253 --> 01:40:11,422
SECOND PLAYER'S PERK

2033
01:40:12,882 --> 01:40:17,345
MAZE DESIGNED BY TEAM SKKU

2034
01:40:19,222 --> 01:40:21,641
Your time is up.

2035
01:40:23,434 --> 01:40:25,728
Here is your first destination.

2036
01:40:29,190 --> 01:40:30,691
Where is it?

2037
01:40:30,775 --> 01:40:32,360
- Right here.
- In the third row?

2038
01:40:32,443 --> 01:40:35,279
My gut tells me
he would've seen this coming.

2039
01:40:35,988 --> 01:40:37,740
<i>I think he'll breeze through this.</i>

2040
01:41:35,423 --> 01:41:38,301
Team SNU in Medicine's Lee Seung-hyeon,
you reached your destination.

2041
01:41:38,384 --> 01:41:40,636
You won one point.

2042
01:41:42,388 --> 01:41:45,766
- Thank goodness.
- Seung-hyeon is on fire.

2043
01:41:47,226 --> 01:41:50,146
- Wow, he's good.
- Tell me about it.

2044
01:41:50,229 --> 01:41:52,982
Was our maze that easy? What should we do?

2045
01:41:53,065 --> 01:41:56,444
Team SKKU's Lee Dong-jae
will now take his turn.

2046
01:41:56,986 --> 01:41:58,404
You've got this, Dong-jae.

2047
01:41:58,487 --> 01:42:00,156
Don't lose your cool, Dong-jae.

2048
01:42:00,239 --> 01:42:01,657
I know you've got this.

2049
01:42:02,533 --> 01:42:03,909
Please head into the maze.

2050
01:42:03,993 --> 01:42:07,288
LEE DONG-JAE TRIES AGAIN
WITHOUT CHECKING THE MAP AGAIN

2051
01:42:11,208 --> 01:42:13,377
<i>Because Seung-hyeon succeeded</i>
<i>reaching his goal in one go,</i>

2052
01:42:13,461 --> 01:42:17,590
<i>I assumed that he would have no trouble</i>
<i>finding his way to the next one.</i>

2053
01:42:17,673 --> 01:42:20,593
<i>I thought that I needed to succeed</i>
<i>on my second turn</i>

2054
01:42:20,676 --> 01:42:22,887
<i>without reviewing the map</i>

2055
01:42:23,304 --> 01:42:26,390
<i>to get on an equal footing</i>
<i>and seize a chance to win.</i>

2056
01:42:26,599 --> 01:42:28,267
This was where he slipped up, wasn't it?

2057
01:42:28,559 --> 01:42:31,520
LEE DONG-JAE'S FIRST TURN
MOMENTS LEADING TO HIS MISTAKE

2058
01:42:36,442 --> 01:42:38,361
SUCCESSFULLY PASSES THE POINT

2059
01:42:39,945 --> 01:42:41,238
Okay, he moved up.

2060
01:42:41,322 --> 01:42:42,281
He traveled upward.

2061
01:42:51,999 --> 01:42:54,835
He's chosen to move along the outer wall.

2062
01:42:54,919 --> 01:42:56,003
He can move down now.

2063
01:42:56,087 --> 01:42:58,673
<i>- That's a fine idea.</i>
<i>- Okay, you can come down now.</i>

2064
01:42:58,756 --> 01:43:00,508
<i>- Go on.</i>
<i>- One...</i>

2065
01:43:00,591 --> 01:43:01,592
<i>Two...</i>

2066
01:43:02,426 --> 01:43:03,344
<i>Three...</i>

2067
01:43:07,098 --> 01:43:10,309
LEE DONG-JAE HAS GOTTEN
VERY CLOSE TO HIS GOAL

2068
01:43:11,310 --> 01:43:13,521
- He knows his way, all right.
- Yeah.

2069
01:43:17,733 --> 01:43:19,276
You reached your destination.

2070
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:21,404
You won one point.

2071
01:43:21,487 --> 01:43:22,863
TEAM SNU: 1, TEAM SKKU: 1

2072
01:43:25,783 --> 01:43:27,284
Like I said, we can count on him.

2073
01:43:28,327 --> 01:43:31,539
Team SNU in Medicine's Lee Seung-hyeon
will now take his turn.

2074
01:43:32,415 --> 01:43:34,500
<i>We're good if he can succeed right away.</i>

2075
01:43:34,583 --> 01:43:37,294
IF HE SUCCEEDS, TEAM SNU WINS ROUND 2

2076
01:43:38,129 --> 01:43:40,214
Here is your second destination.

2077
01:43:41,298 --> 01:43:42,299
Please head into the maze.

2078
01:44:21,922 --> 01:44:23,966
Please take a wrong turn.

2079
01:44:38,147 --> 01:44:42,109
Team SNU in Medicine's Lee Seung-hyeon,
you reached your second destination.

2080
01:44:42,985 --> 01:44:45,946
<i>It seemed I made mistakes</i>
<i>in Equation Death Note</i>

2081
01:44:46,030 --> 01:44:47,907
<i>because I wasn't in control of myself.</i>

2082
01:44:47,990 --> 01:44:50,618
When I reached the goal in the third game,

2083
01:44:50,701 --> 01:44:54,413
I tried my best to control my emotions
rather than getting swept up in joy.

2084
01:45:01,587 --> 01:45:05,007
I'm so relieved.

2085
01:45:05,090 --> 01:45:06,717
How is he so good?

2086
01:45:06,801 --> 01:45:08,803
He's brilliant.

2087
01:45:09,220 --> 01:45:11,305
Round 2 ends
with Team SNU in Medicine's victory

2088
01:45:11,388 --> 01:45:14,600
as the team's Lee Seung-hyeon
reached the two goals first.

2089
01:45:14,767 --> 01:45:17,770
Both contestants,
please return to your base camps.

2090
01:45:20,272 --> 01:45:21,732
- Good job. You were amazing.
- Dude!

2091
01:45:21,816 --> 01:45:24,318
- Well done.
- You're an angel.

2092
01:45:24,401 --> 01:45:27,196
First off, I can't be sure,
but I doubt they'll update their strategy

2093
01:45:27,279 --> 01:45:28,989
just because of the additional five walls.

2094
01:45:29,448 --> 01:45:34,078
Team SKKU's route
became pretty simple midway,

2095
01:45:34,161 --> 01:45:35,663
but they added accents by the end.

2096
01:45:35,746 --> 01:45:37,832
On the other hand,
we went in the opposite direction.

2097
01:45:37,915 --> 01:45:39,250
<i>We broke the map down into three parts</i>

2098
01:45:39,333 --> 01:45:40,668
<i>and made the general journey long.</i>

2099
01:45:40,751 --> 01:45:42,086
<i>And that's more effective.</i>

2100
01:45:42,169 --> 01:45:43,921
TEAM SNU'S MAZE HAD A LONG DISTANCE
BETWEEN ENTRY POINT AND GOALS

2101
01:45:44,004 --> 01:45:45,714
TEAM SKKU'S MAZE HAD A LONG DISTANCE
BETWEEN THE TWO GOALS

2102
01:45:45,923 --> 01:45:49,176
When I actually started making my way
toward the second goal,

2103
01:45:49,260 --> 01:45:51,345
I couldn't recall the midsection clearly.

2104
01:45:51,428 --> 01:45:53,889
I think we can make it hard for them
with a long midsection.

2105
01:45:53,973 --> 01:45:55,516
We can make a better maze that way.

2106
01:45:55,766 --> 01:45:57,685
Let's make the paths as long as we can.

2107
01:45:57,768 --> 01:45:59,436
It's nastier if there is more to memorize.

2108
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:00,354
Okay.

2109
01:46:00,437 --> 01:46:01,522
- But anyhow,
- First off...

2110
01:46:01,605 --> 01:46:03,357
- if you ask me--
- We need to make it fresh.

2111
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:05,067
They would've gotten used to the idea.

2112
01:46:05,150 --> 01:46:07,069
Shall we make them
turn left instead of right?

2113
01:46:07,152 --> 01:46:09,154
Well, that's one possibility.

2114
01:46:09,238 --> 01:46:10,698
Let's try to make distinctions.

2115
01:46:10,781 --> 01:46:12,992
Even when the general setting is similar,

2116
01:46:13,075 --> 01:46:16,996
a familiar setup and a new one
can lead to vastly different experiences.

2117
01:46:17,746 --> 01:46:20,749
Want to make a maze
with a single long route like they did

2118
01:46:20,833 --> 01:46:22,251
or stick to our double-route version?

2119
01:46:22,334 --> 01:46:24,295
- With 50 walls--
- I prefer our version.

2120
01:46:24,378 --> 01:46:25,629
You do? Okay.

2121
01:46:25,963 --> 01:46:27,548
Why don't we modify this?

2122
01:46:27,882 --> 01:46:29,925
You want us to update the old map?

2123
01:46:30,634 --> 01:46:33,429
What do you think
is the main feature of our map?

2124
01:46:33,679 --> 01:46:34,930
The enclosed area here.

2125
01:46:35,014 --> 01:46:35,931
Hey, I got an idea.

2126
01:46:36,015 --> 01:46:39,435
Let's keep this area walled up
and lure them to walk into it.

2127
01:46:39,518 --> 01:46:40,352
Great idea.

2128
01:46:40,436 --> 01:46:42,271
Let's make them head to the sides
and then move in.

2129
01:46:42,354 --> 01:46:43,522
That's it.

2130
01:46:43,606 --> 01:46:45,024
I guess our map was easier in Round 2.

2131
01:46:45,107 --> 01:46:46,775
- Make them turn left.
- Okay.

2132
01:46:47,109 --> 01:46:50,446
<i>Because we had</i>
<i>extra walls to set up in Round 3,</i>

2133
01:46:50,529 --> 01:46:55,451
<i>we planned to take advantage of them</i>
<i>to make a really challenging maze.</i>

2134
01:46:55,743 --> 01:46:57,077
The team with a more awful maze

2135
01:46:57,161 --> 01:46:59,705
and a member with better memory
and sense of navigation will win.

2136
01:46:59,955 --> 01:47:02,708
To be honest,
I'd rather have Ji-hu and I just...

2137
01:47:02,791 --> 01:47:03,876
EXPECTING KANG JI-HU AS HIS OPPONENT

2138
01:47:03,959 --> 01:47:06,545
- ...go head-to-head with the worst mazes.
- I think so, too.

2139
01:47:06,629 --> 01:47:08,422
That could be better for me.

2140
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:11,008
<i>Your time is up.</i>

2141
01:47:12,092 --> 01:47:13,969
How about one last chant?

2142
01:47:14,970 --> 01:47:15,846
One, two, three.

2143
01:47:15,930 --> 01:47:17,681
- SKKU!
- SKKU!

2144
01:47:17,848 --> 01:47:20,726
Allow me to say a few words.

2145
01:47:20,809 --> 01:47:22,353
Let's crush Team SKKU!

2146
01:47:22,436 --> 01:47:24,688
- Let's go, SNU!
- Let's go, SNU!

2147
01:47:25,314 --> 01:47:26,565
Good luck.

2148
01:47:31,862 --> 01:47:34,949
TEAM SKKU'S LEE DONG-JAE
DECIDES TO COMPETE AGAIN IN ROUND 3

2149
01:47:35,032 --> 01:47:37,284
Hey, isn't that Dong-jae?

2150
01:47:37,368 --> 01:47:38,577
- Dong-jae?
- It's him.

2151
01:47:38,661 --> 01:47:39,495
Really?

2152
01:47:40,037 --> 01:47:41,872
Is this a revenge match or what?

2153
01:47:42,706 --> 01:47:44,917
Dong-jae can pull it off
if he doesn't make a mistake.

2154
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:46,335
- Sure.
- For real.

2155
01:47:46,961 --> 01:47:47,795
RIGHT AFTER ROUND 2

2156
01:47:47,878 --> 01:47:49,338
- Don't worry about it.
- Seriously!

2157
01:47:49,421 --> 01:47:51,674
I mean, it's so upsetting that I lost

2158
01:47:51,757 --> 01:47:53,342
- because it was easy.
- If you found it easy,

2159
01:47:53,425 --> 01:47:54,802
why don't you play in Round 3?

2160
01:47:55,219 --> 01:47:57,096
- Yeah, take on both rounds.
- What?

2161
01:47:57,179 --> 01:47:58,472
- You want me to compete again?
- Yes.

2162
01:47:58,722 --> 01:48:01,475
- I'd like to give Dong-jae one more shot.
- Same.

2163
01:48:02,768 --> 01:48:04,395
<i>The matter of fact was</i>

2164
01:48:04,478 --> 01:48:06,647
that Ji-hu and Dong-jae
had different strengths.

2165
01:48:07,064 --> 01:48:10,651
Dong-jae is amazing
when there is one set path to memorize.

2166
01:48:11,026 --> 01:48:13,862
When Team SNU in Medicine
came up with a new strategy,

2167
01:48:13,946 --> 01:48:16,740
<i>we thought that their map</i>
<i>was suited to Dong-jae's talent</i>

2168
01:48:16,824 --> 01:48:18,867
<i>and that he would get us a tie at least.</i>

2169
01:48:20,077 --> 01:48:23,288
We will now begin Round 3 of Maze Craft.

2170
01:48:23,998 --> 01:48:27,376
Before we begin, Team SKKU's player
will decide on the player order

2171
01:48:27,459 --> 01:48:29,795
as you lost the previous round.

2172
01:48:30,254 --> 01:48:32,423
I'll go second.

2173
01:48:32,506 --> 01:48:35,050
TEAM SNU'S LEE SEUNG-HYEON WILL GO FIRST

2174
01:48:35,592 --> 01:48:41,598
You will now be given three minutes
to study the maps.

2175
01:48:42,641 --> 01:48:45,102
They look pretty similar.
You have to start by turning left.

2176
01:48:45,436 --> 01:48:47,271
The similarity is striking.

2177
01:48:47,563 --> 01:48:49,732
This won't be easy.

2178
01:48:49,815 --> 01:48:51,942
I'd say our maze is more difficult.

2179
01:48:52,026 --> 01:48:55,904
- At least, you and I did our best.
- Agreed.

2180
01:48:55,988 --> 01:48:58,949
What's done is done,
so let's not dwell on it.

2181
01:48:59,033 --> 01:49:02,327
MAZE DESIGNED BY TEAM SNU

2182
01:49:04,580 --> 01:49:07,750
MAZE DESIGNED BY TEAM SKKU

2183
01:49:10,961 --> 01:49:13,297
You have one minute left.

2184
01:49:14,423 --> 01:49:16,008
<i>I was able to memorize the maze in one go</i>

2185
01:49:16,091 --> 01:49:19,845
<i>despite the fact that its structure</i>
<i>got more complicated.</i>

2186
01:49:19,928 --> 01:49:22,973
<i>I thought that I should be fine</i>
<i>if I made no mistakes.</i>

2187
01:49:23,432 --> 01:49:26,518
Come on, Dong-jae. Let's show them.

2188
01:49:27,227 --> 01:49:30,939
<i>By the time the host announced</i>
<i>that we had one minute left,</i>

2189
01:49:31,523 --> 01:49:33,984
I had the whole map memorized.

2190
01:49:34,234 --> 01:49:38,030
<i>I thought I could reach the goals</i>
<i>as long as I didn't make a random mistake.</i>

2191
01:49:41,325 --> 01:49:43,535
Please...

2192
01:49:43,994 --> 01:49:46,246
Your time is up.

2193
01:49:47,790 --> 01:49:49,833
Team SNU in Medicine's Lee Seung-hyeon.

2194
01:49:50,542 --> 01:49:51,877
Please head to the entry point.

2195
01:49:52,294 --> 01:49:54,296
Here is your first destination.

2196
01:49:56,173 --> 01:49:59,426
Team SNU in Medicine's Lee Seung-hyeon,
please head into the maze.

2197
01:50:15,651 --> 01:50:17,528
Next, move to your left.

2198
01:50:17,611 --> 01:50:20,114
What a smart guy. I love him.

2199
01:50:20,197 --> 01:50:22,533
Are you our own commentator?

2200
01:50:23,200 --> 01:50:25,744
- Amazing. Does he have a strategy?
- He's so good.

2201
01:50:25,828 --> 01:50:28,247
I'm genuinely curious now.

2202
01:50:35,587 --> 01:50:38,006
<i>He's moving along the outer walls now.</i>

2203
01:50:59,027 --> 01:51:01,572
Come on, now. You're almost there.

2204
01:51:10,455 --> 01:51:11,915
- Be careful.
- He's doing well.

2205
01:51:11,999 --> 01:51:13,750
- Watch out until the end.
- Yes, please.

2206
01:51:19,339 --> 01:51:21,550
You reached your destination.

2207
01:51:22,384 --> 01:51:24,511
You won one point.

2208
01:51:24,595 --> 01:51:26,346
TEAM SNU WON 1 POINT

2209
01:51:29,391 --> 01:51:31,977
- He's got skills.
- He sure does.

2210
01:51:32,060 --> 01:51:34,354
He won a medal
in the International Physics Olympiad.

2211
01:51:34,438 --> 01:51:36,106
<i>- He can't be a small fry.</i>
<i>- Guess not.</i>

2212
01:51:39,151 --> 01:51:42,112
The second player could review the map
and perfect their memory,

2213
01:51:42,196 --> 01:51:43,906
and I thought
it was a significant advantage.

2214
01:51:44,448 --> 01:51:48,785
<i>I wanted to make the most of it</i>
<i>to get a tie.</i>

2215
01:51:48,869 --> 01:51:53,874
MAZE DESIGNED BY TEAM SNU

2216
01:51:55,209 --> 01:51:57,711
Your time is up.

2217
01:52:00,255 --> 01:52:02,341
Here is your first destination.

2218
01:52:02,925 --> 01:52:05,761
Team SKKU's Lee Dong-jae,
please head into the maze.

2219
01:52:17,022 --> 01:52:18,732
I can't bear to watch.

2220
01:52:35,958 --> 01:52:38,252
Wow, he's so smart.

2221
01:52:38,835 --> 01:52:41,463
You're doing well, Dong-jae.

2222
01:52:50,931 --> 01:52:53,016
- He's almost there.
- Nearly there.

2223
01:52:53,100 --> 01:52:54,643
Move down in a straight line...

2224
01:52:55,310 --> 01:52:57,145
Dang, he's almost there.

2225
01:52:57,229 --> 01:52:59,606
I know.

2226
01:53:01,358 --> 01:53:07,114
<i>I knew what a fine player Dong-jae is,</i>
<i>so I knew I shouldn't let my guard down.</i>

2227
01:53:13,870 --> 01:53:15,247
You have five seconds left.

2228
01:53:15,664 --> 01:53:17,040
- He's not sure.
- He stopped.

2229
01:53:17,124 --> 01:53:18,125
- Goodness.
- I really hope

2230
01:53:18,208 --> 01:53:22,004
he'd fall into the trap
just as we designed it.

2231
01:53:27,217 --> 01:53:29,720
- No, wait.
- It's okay. He's following the walls.

2232
01:53:29,803 --> 01:53:30,929
One more step. Don't move up yet.

2233
01:53:33,390 --> 01:53:34,933
Nicely done. Don't go up yet.

2234
01:53:46,236 --> 01:53:47,487
All right, we're all set now.

2235
01:53:52,534 --> 01:53:54,661
You reached your destination.

2236
01:53:54,745 --> 01:53:56,663
TEAM SNU: 1, TEAM SKKU: 1
You won a point.

2237
01:54:00,500 --> 01:54:03,170
- Dong-jae is amazing.
- He's incredible.

2238
01:54:05,964 --> 01:54:09,259
<i>My teammates trusted me</i>
<i>even though I lost Round 2.</i>

2239
01:54:09,343 --> 01:54:12,679
<i>I was grateful for their trust</i>
<i>and support for me.</i>

2240
01:54:13,388 --> 01:54:16,308
Team SNU in Medicine's Lee Seung-hyeon
will now take his turn.

2241
01:54:20,270 --> 01:54:22,439
I'm sure Seung-hyeon will get us the win.

2242
01:54:27,194 --> 01:54:28,653
Please let him make a mistake.

2243
01:54:29,529 --> 01:54:30,781
Jeez, I'm tearing up.

2244
01:54:30,864 --> 01:54:32,616
I badly want to win.

2245
01:54:33,533 --> 01:54:35,827
Here is your second destination.

2246
01:54:37,662 --> 01:54:40,957
Team SNU in Medicine's Lee Seung-hyeon,
please head into the maze.

2247
01:55:14,366 --> 01:55:17,577
All right.
Feel free to follow the outer wall.

2248
01:55:17,661 --> 01:55:18,745
He's doing just that.

2249
01:55:18,829 --> 01:55:20,914
We know how much he likes the edges.

2250
01:55:21,331 --> 01:55:23,083
He's a wiz at this.

2251
01:55:24,835 --> 01:55:28,255
- Yeah, we have to give him that.
- Right?

2252
01:55:39,015 --> 01:55:40,767
It got fuzzy, didn't it?

2253
01:55:40,851 --> 01:55:42,060
Right, I bet your memory faded.

2254
01:55:42,394 --> 01:55:44,020
It looks like he's unsure.

2255
01:55:49,109 --> 01:55:50,777
<i>Actually, I had the maze all memorized.</i>

2256
01:55:50,861 --> 01:55:54,114
<i>I was merely going over the details</i>
<i>not to make a mistake.</i>

2257
01:55:55,657 --> 01:55:58,452
<i>There's definitely</i>
<i>something special about him.</i>

2258
01:56:31,818 --> 01:56:33,945
Is he a genius or what? Wait, he is one.

2259
01:56:34,029 --> 01:56:36,114
Damn straight.
He's the perfect scorer in the CSAT.

2260
01:56:44,581 --> 01:56:50,253
TRAVELED 47 CELLS IN TOTAL

2261
01:56:52,797 --> 01:56:54,841
You reached your second destination.

2262
01:56:54,925 --> 01:56:57,052
As such, you won one point.

2263
01:56:57,135 --> 01:56:58,053
TEAM SNU: 2, TEAM SKKU: 1

2264
01:57:02,349 --> 01:57:05,852
Okay, all we need now
is for Dong-jae to fail.

2265
01:57:06,228 --> 01:57:07,479
Dang, he's good.

2266
01:57:07,562 --> 01:57:10,106
This won't be helpful
for Dong-jae's confidence.

2267
01:57:10,774 --> 01:57:11,983
IF HE FAILS, TEAM SKKU LOSES

2268
01:57:12,067 --> 01:57:15,111
Team SKKU's Lee Dong-jae
will now take his turn.

2269
01:57:16,655 --> 01:57:18,949
Here is your second destination.

2270
01:57:21,076 --> 01:57:23,537
I hope he gets confused
somewhere in the middle.

2271
01:57:24,162 --> 01:57:27,832
I'd love to see Dong-jae
get there in one go and...

2272
01:57:27,916 --> 01:57:29,292
- And he will.
<i>- Team SKKU's Lee Dong-jae</i>

2273
01:57:29,376 --> 01:57:31,086
<i>will now take his turn.</i>

2274
01:57:32,546 --> 01:57:33,922
Please head into the maze.

2275
01:58:06,538 --> 01:58:08,415
Maybe we designed it wrong?

2276
01:58:08,498 --> 01:58:09,416
I don't think so.

2277
01:58:09,958 --> 01:58:11,835
<i>This is as difficult as it gets.</i>

2278
01:58:13,461 --> 01:58:16,172
<i>- Move in a straight line. Okay.</i>
<i>- Let's go, Dong-jae.</i>

2279
01:58:16,256 --> 01:58:19,342
Keep doing your own thing.

2280
01:58:21,595 --> 01:58:25,140
<i>I had to succeed at once to get a tie.</i>

2281
01:58:25,223 --> 01:58:28,226
<i>I desperately didn't want to mess up.</i>

2282
01:58:35,567 --> 01:58:37,277
At this rate, we might get a tie.

2283
01:58:37,360 --> 01:58:39,904
- He's so smart.
- I hope it doesn't come to that.

2284
01:58:41,489 --> 01:58:43,116
He's doing fine.

2285
01:58:43,700 --> 01:58:45,535
Great, actually.

2286
01:58:45,619 --> 01:58:46,494
He's got this.

2287
01:58:47,203 --> 01:58:53,209
LEE DONG-JAE HAS GOTTEN VERY CLOSE
TO HIS SECOND DESTINATION

2288
01:58:57,922 --> 01:58:59,799
<i>- He'll move toward the outer wall, right?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

2289
01:59:03,178 --> 01:59:04,846
LEE DONG-JAE MISSED THE WALL
IN FRONT OF HIM

2290
01:59:10,060 --> 01:59:11,269
<i>You hit a dead end...</i>

2291
01:59:12,729 --> 01:59:14,314
Hey, he made a mistake!

2292
01:59:17,233 --> 01:59:18,985
Dang, I had to go around it.

2293
01:59:19,361 --> 01:59:21,446
- You hit a dead end...
- Great job.

2294
01:59:22,238 --> 01:59:23,448
Please return to your seat.

2295
01:59:23,531 --> 01:59:24,491
Well done, you.

2296
01:59:25,075 --> 01:59:27,369
Wow, you have an amazing memory.

2297
01:59:30,830 --> 01:59:33,124
That concludes Round 3.

2298
01:59:34,167 --> 01:59:37,504
Team SNU in Medicine's Lee Seung-hyeon
won the round.

2299
01:59:37,587 --> 01:59:39,839
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE WON MAZE CRAFT

2300
01:59:42,384 --> 01:59:43,760
Good job.

2301
01:59:43,843 --> 01:59:45,220
You were amazing, Dong-jae.

2302
01:59:45,303 --> 01:59:48,598

2308
02:00:02,112 --> 02:00:06,783
When our victory was decided,
I was overwhelmed with joy.

2309
02:00:07,075 --> 02:00:09,911

Way to go, Seung-hyeon!

2320
02:00:53,455 --> 02:00:55,540
He didn't get the perfect score
in CSAT for no reason.

2321

Man, I would've loved to see
our school logo on that wall...

2322

I'm jealous, too.

2338
02:01:42,545 --> 02:01:45,799
<i>It's a special experience</i>

2341
02:01:51,429 --> 02:01:53,640

<i>I think I'll miss the high</i>

2344

<i>When I first got the call</i>

2345
02:02:07,362 --> 02:02:09,697
<i>I was conscious of the fact</i>
<i>that this was Team SKKU's first entry.</i>

2346
02:02:09,989 --> 02:02:14,202
<i>I was worried I might be left with regrets</i>
<i>after getting eliminated on Day 1.</i>

2347
02:02:14,285 --> 02:02:16,621
<i>But we somehow kept on surviving.</i>

2348
02:02:16,704 --> 02:02:19,624
<i>I'm happy that we got to enjoy</i>
<i>all the game the show had to offer.</i>

2349
02:02:22,252 --> 02:02:25,588
Now that I've gotten to know these guys

You couldn't recall our classes.

2354

Man, you're really on another level.
I don't know how I could beat you.

2355
02:02:40,687 --> 02:02:43,314
I'm in absolute awe. You're untouchable.

2356
02:02:43,398 --> 02:02:44,774
How does one beat you?

2357
02:02:44,858 --> 02:02:48,319
<i>I wondered if I should apply or not</i>
<i>for a very long time.</i>

2358
02:02:48,403 --> 02:02:52,198
<i>I felt frustrated early on</i>
<i>because I couldn't do well as I had hoped.</i>

2359
02:02:52,740 --> 02:02:54,784
What do I do? We're out of ideas.

2360
02:02:55,577 --> 02:03:00,039
<i>I think we finally achieved our victory</i>
<i>because I kept going without giving up.</i>

2361
02:03:01,082 --> 02:03:04,961
<i>I would like to continue</i>
<i>to persevere and grow as a person.</i>

2362
