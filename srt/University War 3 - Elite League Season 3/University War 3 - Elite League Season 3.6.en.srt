1
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:27,694
<i>- We will now begin a redemption round.</i>
- What?

2
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:28,904
Are you serious?

3
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,114
Team KAIST's Jeon Ji-min.

4
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:32,533
I'll go with Pixel Cards 3, 7, and 8.

5
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:35,410
- That is correct.
<i>- I'd hate to face Ji-min in another game.</i>

6
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:37,037
The answer is...

7
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,539
The answer is...

8
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:40,040
I'll go with Pixel Cards 2, 4, and 6.

9
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:42,000
I'll go with Pixel Cards 1, 3, and 9.

10
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:44,294
- That is correct.
- How is he pulling it off?

11
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:46,588
- He beat four people all by himself.
- He's amazing.

12
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:50,425
<i>As the winner of the redemption round,</i>
<i>Team KAIST secured a second chance.</i>

13
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:54,638
<i>They can rejoin the surviving teams</i>
<i>and compete in Elite League Season 3.</i>

14
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,349
<i>They really made it back from hell.</i>

15
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:05,857
Good luck, guys.

16
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:08,277
- Let's do this.
- Good luck to you, too.

17
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,029
- Should we wish the STEM guys good luck?
- Good luck!

18
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:12,698
Good luck, everyone.

19
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,616
It's like hearing our own echo.

20
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,035
Pull us through this.

21
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:19,037
Will do.

22
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:21,999
Oh, what's that?

23
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,626
I recognize this.
It's a lockbox for phones.

24
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,211
Oh, a lockbox for phones?

25
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:29,506
It's a phone jail.

26
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,841
- A phone jail?
- I see.

27
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:32,342
Does this button unlock it?

28
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,596
- Do we put our phones inside?
- Yes.

29
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:37,055
Put it inside...

30
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,225
Then, set the timer.

31
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:41,435
I'll select one hour.

32
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,145
Mine is locked now.

33
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:46,273
The case doesn't open
even if I press the button.

34
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:49,067
- Is it really locked?
- Yes, you can't open it now.

35
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:52,112
I would've gotten better grades
if I had had this back in high school.

36
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,614
Then, I could've gone to SNU...

37
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:56,241
- I could use it now.
- I'd still make it to SNU.

38
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:02,456
If I'd had this in my senior year,
I wouldn't have retaken the CSAT.

39
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:06,209
I had my phone locked away
back when I was studying for the CSAT.

40
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:09,796
I could've used such a smart product.

41
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,756
GEN-Z'S THROWBACK

42
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:13,133
You're an oldie.

43
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:14,468
BORN IN 2007, BORN IN 2003

44
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,804
What do you mean, "oldie"?

45
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:19,973
But your tone made you sound like one.

46
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:21,975
I feel pretty nervous today.

47
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:24,311
- I do, too.
- What with the revenants...

48
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,647
- Team KAIST made it back from hell twice.
- Right.

49
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,191
They had 2 Deathmatches
and 1 redemption round...

50
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,400
Hey, you're right.

51
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,402
They're as seasoned as you can get.

52
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:35,072
Want to know today's good news?

53
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,741
- That guy who shares your name...
- Yeah?

54
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,701
- Did he look off?
- He looked off today.

55
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,120
I feel amazing today.

56
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:43,622
- You do?
- My off-phase is over.

57
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,625
- I'm back to my best form.
- That's great.

58
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,044
- No other teams won a second chance.
- I know.

59
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,421
It's all thanks to Jae-han.

60
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:54,007
- It's a miraculous opportunity for us.
- For sure.

61
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:56,968
I hope we can avoid the Deathmatches
and play fewer games from now on.

62
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:58,303
- Hope for the minimum.
- Yes.

63
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:01,473
If we keep our current trend up,
we'll be shamed as attention seekers.

64
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:07,145
<i>All teams, please gather</i>
<i>at the main hall for the main match.</i>

65
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:08,230
Time for a glow-up.

66
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,648
- Here we go.
- To glow-up!

67
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:12,359
- With a new resolve...
- Exactly.

68
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,069
With a sharper look.

69
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,363
JACKETS FOR THE FINAL 4 TEAMS

70
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:19,741
Impress everyone with a swish.

71
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:21,118
Just like this?

72
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,788
Just like this?

73
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:29,251
Crisp and fine like K-pop idols.

74
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,589
- All right.
- Okay, let's go.

75
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,053
- How about a group photo?
- A group photo?

76
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,975
- Okay.
- Shall we hit every camera?

77
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,309
Hit all corners?

78
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:47,436
V for victory.

79
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,779
THAT'S IT
FOR THE FINAL 4 CELEBRATION PHOTOS

80
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,584
Everyone looks nice in the jacket.

81
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:12,627
The vibe's noticeably different.

82
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:14,296
Our jacket color stands out.

83
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:17,507
<i>Elite League Season 3.</i>

84
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,551
<i>The surviving teams are as follows.</i>

85
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:22,387
<i>Team SNU in Medicine,</i>

86
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:24,598
<i>Team SKKU,</i>

87
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,058
<i>Team SNU in STEM,</i>

88
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:30,270
<i>and an additional survivor</i>
<i>from the redemption round,</i>

89
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,897
<i>Team KAIST.</i>

90
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:33,732
Feels like a déjà vu.

91
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:34,858
Is it a revenge match?

92
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,152
We beat them once. We can do it again.

93
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:38,820
Exactly.

94
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:42,073
Only the strong contenders remain now.

95
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:43,658
<i>From this point on,</i>

96
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:45,410
<i>you will not team up by divisions.</i>

97
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:51,291
<i>We will have a competition</i>
<i>between the individual teams.</i>

98
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:53,752
No more teaming up? That's a shame.

99
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,754
Team SKKU is our rival now.

100
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,923
We have no allies now.

101
00:04:58,215 --> 00:04:59,633
We won't lose, at any rate.

102
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:03,220
Shoot, my nerves are getting to me.

103
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,514
<i>Today's main match is</i>

104
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:08,058
<i>Dilemma of the Mean.</i>

105
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,727
- Dilemma?
- Dilemma of the Mean?

106
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,063
- That's a mind game.
- It's a mind game.

107
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,981
<i>In Dilemma of the Mean,</i>

108
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:18,068
<i>your task is to win points</i>
<i>with a set of three cards.</i>

109
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,695
<i>It is a psychological strategy game.</i>

110
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:26,910
<i>Each round of Dilemma of the Mean</i>
<i>consists of three mini games.</i>

111
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,955
<i>The first one is the Maximum Match.</i>

112
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,124
<i>Each team will present an equation</i>
<i>with one card undisclosed.</i>

113
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:37,838
<i>The team with an equation that yields</i>
<i>the largest result wins one point.</i>

114
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:41,132
<i>If multiple teams have the same maximum,</i>

115
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:46,346
<i>the point will be awarded to the team</i>
<i>with the second-largest result instead.</i>

116
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,515
- Sounds like a mind game.
- It's a mind game.

117
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:51,142
It's an epic psychological warfare.

118
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:53,770
<i>The second mini game is the Minimum Match.</i>

119
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:57,065
<i>Again, you will present an equation</i>
<i>with one card undisclosed.</i>

120
00:05:57,148 --> 00:06:01,987
<i>The team with an equation that yields</i>
<i>the smallest result wins one point.</i>

121
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,699
<i>If multiple teams have the same minimum,</i>

122
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:10,662
<i>the point will be awarded to the team</i>
<i>with the second-smallest result instead.</i>

123
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:12,956
Are negative numbers out?

124
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:13,874
<i>However,</i>

125
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:18,545
<i>the smallest result</i>
<i>should be zero or larger.</i>

126
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:21,298
<i>The third mini game is the Mean Match.</i>

127
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,675
<i>Your target number in this game</i>

128
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:28,054
<i>is the mean of the winning numbers</i>
<i>from the previous two mini games.</i>

129
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:30,515
<i>The team that meets the target</i>
<i>wins two points.</i>

130
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:33,101
<i>In this mini game,</i>

131
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:36,813
<i>every team shows</i>
<i>all three cards at the same time.</i>

132
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,609
<i>If two teams' results</i>
<i>match the target mean,</i>

133
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:43,528
<i>they will win one point each.</i>

134
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:49,200
<i>If more than three teams meet the goal,</i>

135
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:52,120
<i>we will proceed to the next round</i>
<i>without awarding points.</i>

136
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,580
Oh, man.

137
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:57,083
<i>If none of the results</i>
<i>meets the target mean,</i>

138
00:06:57,167 --> 00:07:02,047
<i>the team with the closest number</i>
<i>will receive two points.</i>

139
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,131
Sounds interesting.

140
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:07,385
<i>All teams will receive 41 cards,</i>
<i>each with a number from 0 to 40.</i>

141
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:10,472
<i>They will also be given three cards</i>
<i>with different arithmetic symbols,</i>

142
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,098
<i>plus, minus, and multiplication.</i>

143
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:15,936
<i>Please use the cards to make an equation</i>

144
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:18,980
<i>that has 1 symbol between 2 numbers.</i>

145
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:24,361
<i>Once used,</i>
<i>the numbered cards cannot be reused.</i>

146
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:29,658
<i>But you may reuse the symbol cards</i>
<i>in the upcoming rounds.</i>

147
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:35,288
So numbered ones are discarded after use.
This won't be easy.

148
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,873
<i>We will have six rounds in total.</i>

149
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:40,627
<i>The two teams with the fewest total points</i>
<i>will compete in the Deathmatch.</i>

150
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,795
<i>If there is a tie,</i>

151
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:46,758
<i>the team with the larger sum</i>
<i>from the unused cards wins.</i>

152
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:49,469
<i>All teams,</i>
<i>please start discussing your strategies.</i>

153
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,930
<i>You'll be given 20 minutes.</i>

154
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:57,644
Okay, I'll get to the bottom of this game.

155
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,312
Let's close the door first.

156
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,816
We should give up the mean.

157
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:03,733
Here's why.

158
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,695
We get the mean by dividing the sum
of the minimum and the maximum by two.

159
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:07,988
The former will be close to zero,

160
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:10,407
so the mean will be
about half of the latter.

161
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,451
Unless we have another times card,
we can't win both the max and the mean.

162
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:17,330
<i>If the winning equation</i>
<i>from the Maximum Match is 40 times 39,</i>

163
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,124
<i>which yields 1,560,</i>

164
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,543
<i>and the winning equation</i>
<i>from the Minimum Match is 0 times 10,</i>

165
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:22,627
<i>which yields zero,</i>

166
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:27,048
<i>the mean value is 780,</i>
<i>the maximum divided in half.</i>

167
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:30,176
<i>You cannot make an equation</i>
<i>that yields 780</i>

168
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,929
<i>without an extra multiplication card.</i>

169
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:36,307
<i>In other words,</i>
<i>you would need two multiplication cards</i>

170
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:39,144
<i>to win both the Maximum Match</i>
<i>and the Mean Match.</i>

171
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,938
I saw the times card
as the most important one

172
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:47,277
because it decided whether we would win
the Maximum Match or the Mean Match.

173
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:48,862
If we give up the Mean Match,

174
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:51,948
we'll be yielding two points to others
every round.

175
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,576
No, no one gets anything
if three teams meet the target.

176
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:59,831
I think there's a high chance
they'll all go for the Mean Match.

177
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,208
- I've got a superb idea.
- Hit me.

178
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:06,171
In most mind games,
the players must hide their true goal.

179
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,923
But here, we have to be transparent.

180
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,300
- Right.
- Basically,

181
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,386
it's best to go first
in the Minimum Match.

182
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:17,098
When we do, we'll flash them
"zero times blank."

183
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:21,478
It is crucial that you make yourself
crystal clear to your opponents.

184
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,897
We can't exactly talk to each other,

185
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,775
<i>so our two cards</i>
<i>have to send a clear message.</i>

186
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:28,526
COMBINATIONS THAT MAKE THE STANCE CLEAR

187
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:32,113
Our cards should say,
"Try us if you want to tank with us."

188
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:37,452
I think we should reserve
the "zero times blank" option if possible.

189
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:41,498
If we use that combination,
we can't win that round's Maximum Match.

190
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,832
- That's right.
- Agreed.

191
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,960
We could be forced to give up
the Maximum Match and the Mean Match.

192
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:49,839
The safest option for us is
to save the times card for the Mean Match.

193
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:54,344
Suppose we need just one more point
to avoid today's Deathmatch.

194
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,888
- That's when we'll use this combo.
- I get it.

195
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,307
Here's another idea.

196
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,434
Why don't we hold back on the primes?

197
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:02,435
I like that.

198
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,729
We might need them for the Mean Matches.

199
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:05,730
For example,

200
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,857
<i>let's say we have to make 115.</i>

201
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,527
YOU NEED 2 PRIMES FOR CERTAIN NUMBERS

202
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,278
Okay, let's try to spare them.

203
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:16,658
In the earlier rounds, the other teams are
bound to aim high for the Maximum Matches.

204
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,661
- Both STEM teams are bold.
- Yes, they would go for them.

205
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:20,870
That's for sure.

206
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,748
- Go for huge numbers?
- I can see Team KAIST doing it.

207
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:26,960
- Team KAIST may try it in Round 1.
- They can just go for it.

208
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:30,922
Let's say the two STEM teams use
the times card to get a huge number.

209
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:34,634
That clearly means one of them
will win the Maximum Match.

210
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:38,388
But then they won't be
able to use the times card

211
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,098
for the Mean Match.

212
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:43,476
It's rather better for us
if they choose to go bold.

213
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:48,273
We'll need to save our times card
for the Mean Match of Round 1.

214
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,024
Let's be prudent in Round 1.

215
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,694
<i>The time for strategy meeting is up.</i>

216
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:58,241
<i>All teams, please gather</i>
<i>at the main hall for the main match.</i>

217
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:03,955
We need the cards out of their sight,
so keep them behind the platform.

218
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:05,999
They might see our cards.

219
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,751
I could block their gaze from here.

220
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,795
That may be for the better.

221
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:17,051
THE COMPETITION IS HEATED
THOUGH THE MATCH HASN'T EVEN BEGUN

222
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:22,891
Let us begin the main match,
Dilemma of the Mean.

223
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:25,560
Before we continue,
each team will roll a die twice.

224
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,562
You'll choose the submission order
based on the total,

225
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:30,481
from the highest to the lowest.

226
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,360
Don't touch this, though.

227
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:36,446
Not bad.

228
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,697
It's okay.

229
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:42,076
Team SNU in STEM has the largest total.

230
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:43,786
We'll go first.

231
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:45,997
We'll go last.

232
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,208
We'll go third.

233
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,710
INITIAL ORDER:
SNU IN STEM, SNU IN MEDICINE, KAIST, SKKU

234
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,462
THE ORDER WILL ROTATE WITH EACH GAME

235
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:56,216
Team SNU in STEM will regret
letting us go third.

236
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:57,133
Well, yes.

237
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:58,801
But they may have a bright idea

238
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,470
- and done it on purpose.
- True.

239
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:04,557
Do you want to have our cards set up
to show our confidence?

240
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:06,809
- That's a strategy, too.
- Yes.

241
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,564
We will now begin Round 1
of Dilemma of the Mean.

242
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,984
Let us begin Maximum Match of Round 1.

243
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:18,529
Team SNU in STEM,
please submit your equation.

244
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,534
DECLARING THEIR INTENT
WITH THE MULTIPLICATION CARD

245
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,496
I think they went for 40 times 39.

246
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,248
There they go.

247
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,375
They'll probably get the point.

248
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,961
Quick, let's think.
What cards can we throw away?

249
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:34,212
Let's not get involved.

250
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:37,548
This is a major make-or-break move.

251
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:39,050
We can win with our skills.

252
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,677
IF LEFT UNCHALLENGED,
TEAM SNU IN STEM WINS 1 POINT

253
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,512
I'm in tip-top shape today.

254
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:46,724
Even the die from earlier

255
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:48,559
- knew today's our day.
- Agreed.

256
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:53,856
The core idea behind "40 times blank"
was to intimidate the opponents

257
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,068
into using the plus card early on.

258
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:58,903
This is a bust, anyway.

259
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:01,364
- I'm sure they used 40 times 39.
- You bet.

260
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,865
Let's use smaller numbers.

261
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:05,034
- Go for the smallest we can spare.
- Let's do that.

262
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,288
You have 30 seconds left.

263
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,873
Everyone is tucking their tails.

264
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:13,334
What if their hidden number isn't 39?

265
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:15,628
We know them. They're no gamblers.

266
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,380
Right? I thought so, too.

267
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,133
Still...

268
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:23,845
- Okay with these cards?
- Sure.

269
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:27,932
TEAM SKKU USED THE 2 LARGEST NUMBERS

270
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:31,894
- Why would they...
- They must think Team SNU in STEM

271
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,646
- used 40 times 38.
- That must be it.

272
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,857
Those guys have the nerve of steel.

273
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,275
Who'd think to try that?

274
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,819
Kudos, guys.

275
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,655
1 MINUTE AGO
But guys...

276
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:47,327
Are we sure they used 39?

277
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:51,080
They could've used
something random like 40 times 3.

278
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:52,665
Want to get involved?

279
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,000
Let's go for it.

280
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,210
The others would've used their plus cards.

281
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,171
Let's use the times card
and meet them head-on.

282
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,714
- Do we go for it?
- Yeah.

283
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,257
You have 30 seconds left.

284
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:04,177
- It's sink-or-swim now.
- We'll drown with them,

285
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,470
- at least.
- We had to try it.

286
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,638
- I hope they go down together.
- I think they will.

287
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:10,391
We stand to gain
if they both used 40 times 39.

288
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:11,642
Let's hope we get the point.

289
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:14,437
We now have all four equations.

290
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,565
All teams, please reveal the secret card.

291
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:25,239
TEAM SKKU USED 40 TIMES 39
TO GET THE LARGEST POSSIBLE RESULT

292
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:28,534
All right. Team SKKU used the times card.

293
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,246
- What?
- Wait, what's going on?

294
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,838
TEAM SNU IN STEM WAS BLUFFING
WITH 40 TIMES 2

295
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,925
- See? They used two.
- We made the right call.

296
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,219
If Team SNU in STEM had used 40 times 39,

297
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,888
<i>they wouldn't have tried to mask 39.</i>

298
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,182
<i>That's why we felt sure</i>
<i>the hidden card couldn't be 39.</i>

299
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:55,436
By winning the first game
with 40 times 39,

300
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,565
we were able to get ahead
while turning their 40 card into a waste.

301
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:01,651
It was a sure win for us.

302
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,278
It felt like they used
a random number like two.

303
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,239
DURING STRATEGY MEETING
Let's say

304
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,782
the first team presents "40 times blank."

305
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:10,618
The others would expect
the blank to be something big.

306
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:14,205
Then, they would likely save
the times card for the Mean Match

307
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,707
and use the plus card
in the Maximum Match.

308
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:21,212
Suppose they all chose the plus card.
What's to stop us from using two?

309
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:24,340
You can't get 80 or larger
with the plus card.

310
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:28,010
And with a smaller mean,
we get a shot in the Mean Match, too.

311
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:31,973
I thought it was a clever strategy
because we could then aim for two points.

312
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,267
It'd be funny if anyone used 39.

313
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,853
I'll give it to them, then.

314
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,564
I'll give props to anyone
who saw through us.

315
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,066
How did they manage it?

316
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,569
They're good.

317
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,404
I bet that screwed up their plans.

318
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,239
- That's for sure.
- I know.

319
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,283
I don't think tricks work here.

320
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,243
We shouldn't use them at all.

321
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:57,039
<i>The winning result</i>
<i>of the Maximum Match in Round 1 is 1,560.</i>

322
00:15:57,123 --> 00:16:00,918
Team SKKU won a point.

323
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,588
Team SKKU can't win the Mean Match now.

324
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,173
No, they're out of the way.

325
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:07,341
- It's good for us.
- The same goes for Team SNU in STEM.

326
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:09,719
SYMBOLS CAN'T BE REUSED IN THE SAME ROUND
They used their times card.

327
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,095
This is our dream scenario.

328
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:13,806
Two teams used large numbers
and the times card,

329
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,017
but we only used small numbers
and the plus card.

330
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:18,644
We can score with our large numbers.

331
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,229
HOPING TO WIN THE MEAN MATCH
WITH THE MULTIPLICATION CARD

332
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,690
Two teams used the times card,
so we can win the Mean Match for sure.

333
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,108
- Let's go get it.
- All right.

334
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,903
Let us begin the Minimum Match of Round 1.

335
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:29,155
Team SNU in Medicine...

336
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,114
<i>Team KAIST...</i>

337
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:31,324
<i>Team SKKU...</i>

338
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:34,076
MINIMUM MATCH OF ROUND 1

339
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:38,206
I guess we can decide which team wins now.

340
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:42,251
Which team wins a point
is now up to Team SNU in STEM.

341
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:45,755
We should've tried to get
in Team SNU in STEM's good books.

342
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,798
We should back Team KAIST.

343
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:49,342
Team SKKU and Team SNU in Medicine

344
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,636
might be hoping
to reach the finals together.

345
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:55,056
EQUATION SUBMITTED

346
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:59,185
All teams, please reveal the secret card.

347
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:04,065
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE: 1, TEAM KAIST: 2

348
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:08,653
TEAM SKKU ALSO HAS 1,
SAME AS TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE

349
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:12,406
TEAM SNU IN STEM'S EQUATION ALSO YIELDS 1

350
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,116
Hey, they got us.

351
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,409
They're out to get us.

352
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,245
- They want us to go down?
- Why?

353
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:18,704
AS THE SOLE TEAM WITH 2,
TEAM KAIST WINS THE POINT

354
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,289
This is dope.

355
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:25,378
<i>The winning result</i>
<i>of the Minimum Match in Round 1 is 2.</i>

356
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:30,132
<i>Team KAIST won a point.</i>

357
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,678
The two teams with the times card
will win the Mean Match, right?

358
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:36,389
- Yes, they'll get a point each.
- With a point each?

359
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:39,433
<i>The target mean in Round 1 is 781.</i>

360
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:40,893
MAXIMUM: 1,560, MINIMUM: 2
MEAN: 781

361
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:43,020
- Our goal is 781...
- So we go for 782.

362
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:45,273
We can't get 781. We need 71 for that.

363
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:46,566
- So, 782...
- That's it.

364
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:49,110
Or we can go for 780
and use the equation we prepared.

365
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,821
Can we make an equation that yields 782?

366
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,906
That's 17 times 23 times 2.

367
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,450
We can get it with 34 times 23.

368
00:17:56,993 --> 00:18:00,288
NO MASKED CARDS THIS TIME
All teams, please submit your equations.

369
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:03,207
ROUND 1 TARGET MEAN: 781

370
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:07,420
+1 DIFFERENCE, -1 DIFFERENCE

371
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:12,800
<i>Team SNU in Medicine and Team KAIST</i>
<i>won a point each.</i>

372
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,470
- Team KAIST won 2 points this round.
- Yes, they won 2 games.

373
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:18,723
We can't just let them take the lead.

374
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,600
Of course not.

375
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,102
Let us begin the Maximum Match of Round 2.

376
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:26,939
- We don't need to gamble at all.
- Let's be conventional.

377
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,234
TEAM KAIST USES THE TWO LARGEST NUMBERS

378
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:33,446
We presented a set of surefire cards
whenever we went first

379
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,031
<i>so we could win points.</i>

380
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,491
Dang, they'll win another point.

381
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:41,037
Team KAIST must've used the times card.
It makes no sense otherwise.

382
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,956
They barely made it back
through the redemption round.

383
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,459
They wouldn't have thrown away
40 and 39 in a gamble.

384
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,336
- Especially when they have two points.
- That too.

385
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,921
Team KAIST already has two points.

386
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:52,965
- They have no reason to gamble.
- Right.

387
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:55,259
- Let's toss this game.
- They must've used the times card.

388
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,015
We're using the plus card no matter what.

389
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,185
USES THE PLUS SYMBOL
WITH DISPOSABLE NUMBERS

390
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,937
Let's throw in two useless cards
with the plus card now

391
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:09,065
and win the Mean Match.

392
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:11,442
That's upside down.

393
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:16,989
They put the secret card upside down.

394
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:22,578
We now have all four equations.

395
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,413
We'll probably win.

396
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,332
- I bet they all used the plus card.
- Agreed.

397
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,918
- What idiot would've used the times card?
- No one would've done that.

398
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,088
<i>The winning result is 1,560.</i>

399
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:36,801
<i>Team KAIST won a point.</i>

400
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,427
We'll win if we don't slip up.

401
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:39,387
HAS A 3-POINT LEAD

402
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,764
- Fingers crossed.
- We'll place second at least.

403
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,809
There's no guarantee
we can win the Mean Match.

404
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,602
Three teams have the times card.

405
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:47,645
NO POINTS IN A 3-WAY TIE

406
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,189
We have more to gain
if they all fight to get the mean.

407
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,233
There's a high chance no one will win.

408
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:53,567
- It's better for us.
- Sure.

409
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:55,903
If they all meet the target...

410
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,739
Let us begin the Minimum Match of Round 2.

411
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,117
- Team SNU in STEM has no points.
- Yeah.

412
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,744
- They'll use zero, then.
- They have to.

413
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:07,373
In case they don't go for 0,
let's make an equation that yields 1.

414
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:12,461
So they're going with one?

415
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,046
Wait, we can use zero this time.

416
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,589
We can't win two points with the mean.

417
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:17,925
I second Jong-yun's idea.
If we save the times card,

418
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:20,678
then three teams will go
into the Mean Match with it.

419
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,263
We're likely to get a tie, then.

420
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:27,351
TEAM SNU IN STEM
DECIDES TO WIN 1 SURE POINT

421
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:29,228
They used the zero.

422
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,230
They're getting a zero, right?

423
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:32,982
- Isn't it better for us?
- It doesn't matter.

424
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,693
- We and Team SKKU can win a point each.
- Of course.

425
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,403
Let them take a point.

426
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,904
We can win one later.

427
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:41,824
MINIMUM MATCH OF ROUND 2
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE

428
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,492
- We good?
- Team SNU in STEM will win anyway.

429
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:48,122
All teams, please reveal the secret card.

430
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:52,752
<i>The winning result</i>
<i>of the Minimum Match in Round 2 is zero.</i>

431
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:57,089
<i>Team SNU in STEM won a point.</i>

432
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:01,635
The target mean in Round 2 is 780.

433
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,765
Let's now win the guaranteed one point.

434
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,601
- We've got to get 780 now.
- What, 780?

435
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,603
We need 26 and 30.

436
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:14,190
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE AND TEAM SKKU
MET THE TARGET MEAN

437
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,775
Team SKKU used the same cards.

438
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,443
- They did?
- Yeah.

439
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:19,987
What we need to keep in mind now

440
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:24,450
is that if the maximum is 1560
and the minimum is 0 in any future round,

441
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,118
we can't meet the target mean.

442
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:29,413
<i>The two possible combinations for 780</i>

443
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:31,624
<i>are 20 times 29</i>

444
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:34,251
<i>or 26 times 30.</i>

445
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:39,882
<i>As Team SKKU already used 26, 30, and 39,</i>

446
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,968
<i>they can't make an equation</i>
<i>that yields 780.</i>

447
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:46,430
Isn't it the same for all others?

448
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:49,099
Not for Team SNU in STEM.
They still have 39.

449
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:53,270
We each took on a team
to check the cards they used.

450
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,022
I'll check Team SNU in Medicine.

451
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,398
I'll take on Team KAIST.

452
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:58,025
TEAM SNU IN STEM AS WELL
I'll handle Team KAIST.

453
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:00,486
Why don't you monitor the general trends?

454
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:01,570
Keep them in mind.

455
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:03,823
Let's take on a team each, Seung-hyeon.

456
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:05,699
Memorize the used cards, okay?

457
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,703
ALL FOUR TEAMS ARE TRACKING
EVERYONE ELSE'S REMAINING CARDS

458
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,248
Let us begin the Maximum Match of Round 3.

459
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:15,334
Why don't we mask a number?

460
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:18,879
We tried bluffing once.
I don't think it will work now.

461
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:20,923
Let's think of a way
to win the Mean Match instead.

462
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,926
I don't think it will hurt
to try our luck once more.

463
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:27,054
Team SNU in Medicine still has 39 and 40.

464
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:29,682
They can win the Maximum Match
in any other round.

465
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:32,434
- So they might not use them now?
- That's my point.

466
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:34,270
If our gamble fails again,

467
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,814
we'll lose another point
that we could've easily won.

468
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:38,065
That's true.

469
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,401
I don't know,
but I still think we should risk it.

470
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,570
- I agree with Myeong-su.
- Let's gamble.

471
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,363
<i>To go up to the second place,</i>

472
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:47,616
I thought we needed to take risks
by throwing curveballs

473
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,244
instead of sticking
with tried-and-true methods.

474
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,621
Come on, let's reach a decision.

475
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,415
What do you say?

476
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,547
We're gamblers, all right.

477
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:06,510
TEAM SNU IN STEM DECIDES
TO TAKE ON ANOTHER GAMBLE

478
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:11,223
<i>We thought that one successful bluffing</i>
<i>would help us overtake the others.</i>

479
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:13,851
The masked number has to be a large one.

480
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,686
That's likely a large number.

481
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:19,565
Then, Team SNU in Medicine
will counter with 40 times 39.

482
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:23,235
- How so?
- Otherwise, Team SNU in STEM wins.

483
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,487
Oh, they used the times card.

484
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:27,364
Their best set is 39 times 38.

485
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:29,408
Team SNU in Medicine
will go for 39 times 40.

486
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:32,786
- They have no reason not to, right?
- Exactly.

487
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:35,039
Team SNU in STEM used 39.

488
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:37,917
They might've used 39 times 38, right?

489
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:41,921
What? They didn't use 40.

490
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,505
What's going on?

491
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,507
Still, 40 times 38 is bigger.

492
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:48,135
- Oh, so that's bigger.
- What a smart move.

493
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:49,595
- They're good.
- How clever.

494
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:52,056
They managed to keep 39.

495
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,767
Can't we still beat them with 40 times 38?

496
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,978
- Well, yes.
- Then we can use 39 in the next turn.

497
00:23:58,062 --> 00:24:00,940
The others have 37 and 38 at most.

498
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:03,692
Let's fool them with 39 plus 37.

499
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:09,490
- The hidden card has to be 40.
- For sure.

500
00:24:11,742 --> 00:24:13,911
Their faces fell,
so it must have been a bluff.

501
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,205
- They could've used 39 times 3.
- Yes, something small.

502
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,540
We'll secure one point at a time.

503
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:20,709
- Do we just discard some?
- Of course.

504
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,629
TEAM KAIST LETS GO OF UNNECESSARY CARDS

505
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:26,966
TEAM SKKU DOES THE SAME

506
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,510
We now have all four equations.

507
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:33,013
All teams, please reveal the secret card.

508
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:40,229
TEAM SNU IN STEM'S BLUFF FAILED AGAIN

509
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,690
- They made sure to win that point.
- That's safer.

510
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:45,567
If you're angling to win a point,
you'd better make sure you get it.

511
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:48,737
Why did Team SNU in STEM do that?

512
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:51,615
I wonder why they keep bluffing that way.

513
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:54,159
They wasted a useful card
with 40 times 2 earlier.

514
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:55,494
Guess they didn't learn from it.

515
00:24:56,036 --> 00:25:00,499
We ended up giving everyone a lesson
that gambling only leads to ruin.

516
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:03,460
We'll need to focus on moves
and countermoves from now on.

517
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:08,007
<i>The winning result</i>
<i>of the Maximum Match in Round 3 is 1,520.</i>

518
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:12,720
<i>Team SNU in Medicine won a point.</i>

519
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:16,890
Let us begin the Minimum Match of Round 3.

520
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,144
What do you want us to go with?

521
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:22,312
It's either 1 or 2.

522
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:23,897
- Right.
- Wait, quick.

523
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:29,611
THEY MASK A NUMBER
TO HIDE WHETHER THE RESULT IS 1 OR 2

524
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:31,655
Our result will be two.
Do we let them know?

525
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:33,574
- It'd be better to hide it.
- Do as he says.

526
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:34,992
But why hide it?

527
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,744
Transparency would tempt them
to go for one.

528
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:37,703
That makes sense.

529
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:40,497
- No masking this time.
- Here's the minus card.

530
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:41,498
Here we go.

531
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:44,084
TEAM KAIST DISCLOSES ALL THEIR NUMBERS

532
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:46,211
Then, we must target one, no?

533
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:49,089
- Yes, we shouldn't take a loss.
- Let's avoid a loss.

534
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:53,802
What's Team SNU in STEM's choice?

535
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:57,097
Team SNU in STEM wouldn't mind
Team KAIST winning

536
00:25:57,181 --> 00:25:58,223
because they're in the lead.

537
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:01,018
Team SNU in STEM's current target
is the team in third place.

538
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:04,563
They can't have Team SKKU win.
They'd much rather let Team KAIST win.

539
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:07,191
- They would let Team KAIST win.
- It's the right choice.

540
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,614
- Why bother masking?
- Yeah, why?

541
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,616
- We're dying to know.
- Why, though?

542
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,201
I'm so curious.

543
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:21,497
All teams, please reveal the secret card.

544
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,957
TEAM SKKU: 1, TEAM KAIST: 2

545
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:25,167
Oh, they went for one.

546
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:28,378
TEAM SNU IN STEM: 1
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE: 2

547
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:29,630
NO POINTS THIS TIME

548
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:30,839
Great.

549
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,966
- That's the logical choice.
- Totally.

550
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,636
<i>No team won a point.</i>

551
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,722
WHEN THERE IS NO WINNER,
THE MINIMUM IS THE MEAN OF ALL 4 VALUES

552
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:42,601
The target mean in Round 3 is 760.75.

553
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:46,688
No one will try to hold us back
once we become untouchable.

554
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:49,817
- We should overpower them.
- They'll go for each other's throats.

555
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,777
Let's win points as fast as we can.

556
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:54,029
We should use 38 times 20.

557
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:55,030
Is it necessary?

558
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:56,156
But 38...

559
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,492
TEAM SKKU AIMS TO WIN A POINT
WITH 38 TIMES 20

560
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,911
We should use the smaller numbers first.

561
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,830
Save the cards
that will give us a larger sum.

562
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,666
Team SKKU hasn't used
many single-digit numbers.

563
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:09,044
There's a chance they're trying to keep
five consecutive numbers like us.

564
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:12,714
<i>In Dilemma of the Mean,</i>
<i>there is one additional rule.</i>

565
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:15,592
<i>After all six rounds are completed,</i>

566
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:19,721
<i>teams with five consecutive numbers</i>
<i>remaining in their possession</i>

567
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:22,891
<i>will be given one additional point.</i>

568
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:25,978
In a tie,
the team with a larger total wins.

569
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:28,647
- We can beat them with 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
- Okay.

570
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:31,066
DECIDES TO KEEP 4, 5, 6, 7, AND 8
FOR A LARGER TOTAL

571
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:35,195
All teams, please submit your equations.

572
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:39,491
TEAM SKKU AND TEAM KAIST
MET THE TARGET MEAN OF 760.75

573
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:43,495
MEAN MATCH IN ROUND 3
TEAM KAIST: 4, TEAM SKKU: 3

574
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,707
Let us begin the Maximum Match of Round 4.

575
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:51,920
What matters in the later rounds
is which team has better cards left.

576
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:54,256
We used cards in a random fashion.

577
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:57,843
We threw away many useless cards,
so we still have decent cards left.

578
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:03,182
To narrow down the 2-point gap,
we must win 2 points in 1 round twice.

579
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:06,393
- Don't give up yet. Let's keep going.
- Okay.

580
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:09,688
Team KAIST, please submit your equation.

581
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:13,275
Okay, we're going first
in the Maximum Match, right?

582
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:16,570
We can't win this game anyway
because of Team SNU in Medicine.

583
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:17,863
They still have 39.

584
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,740
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE HAS 39

585
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,867
- Give it up.
- We can discard a few.

586
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,076
Turn it around.

587
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:28,540
Which cards do we use?

588
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:29,958
Do we make a play for this game?

589
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,501
They wouldn't have wasted the times card.

590
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:33,295
Right, I'm sure that's the plus card.

591
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:37,424
Does either of Team SNUs still have 39?

592
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:39,218
Team SNU in STEM doesn't.

593
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:40,344
How about 38?

594
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:42,429
- Let me think. They have it.
- They do?

595
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,973
We can't use the times card anyway.

596
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:46,433
Shall we ditch a few cards?

597
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:48,435
- With the plus card, yes.
- All right.

598
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:50,979
- Make our sum bigger than Team KAIST's.
- Then...

599
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:56,443
I bet they both used the plus card.

600
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:58,320
Otherwise, they would've warned us

601
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:02,032
- with large numbers.
- Every single point matters to them.

602
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:04,451
I think they'll try to win
the Mean Match, too.

603
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:07,955
Since that's the case,
we don't have to go all-in here.

604
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:10,249
Let's use 32 and 23
and leave the symbol masked.

605
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:12,042
We've got to be bold.

606
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:14,461
Bold how?

607
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:15,754
With the times card?

608
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,339
Yes, go big or go home.

609
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,840
You have ten seconds left.

610
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:25,889
Things aren't going well
for Team SNU in STEM.

611
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:27,599
They must've used the times card.

612
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:30,060
They're desperate to win points.

613
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,895
It could really be the times card.

614
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:33,605
Looks like the times card.

615
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:36,984
Using the times card here
means they gave up the Mean Match.

616
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:40,404
All we need to do is win a point
every round using the times card.

617
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,411
All teams, please reveal the secret card.

618
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:50,872
TEAM SKKU, TEAM KAIST

619
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,795
Oh, come on.

620
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:02,926
TEAM SNU IN STEM'S EQUATION
HAS A PLUS CARD AND YIELDS 71

621
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,347
There we go.

622
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:08,849
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE USED THE PLUS CARD

623
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:11,601
I think there will come a time

624
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:16,189
when we need to win
the Maximum Match with the plus card

625
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:19,318
- and the Mean Match with the times card.
- Agreed.

626
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:21,194
We'll need that at least once...

627
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:22,571
- To secure a lead?
- Exactly.

628
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,574
I think we can take this game
with the plus card.

629
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:28,910
Team SKKU and Team SNU in STEM
could've both used the plus card.

630
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:30,495
Let's go with the plus card.

631
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:32,581
- Which cards do we use?
- Big numbers.

632
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:34,708
All right.

633
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,668
WON A POINT WITH THE PLUS CARD

634
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:43,592
<i>The winning result</i>
<i>of the Maximum Match in Round 4 is 72.</i>

635
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:48,430
<i>Team SNU in Medicine won a point.</i>

636
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:51,516
ROUND 4
MINIMUM MATCH

637
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,018
Which team still has the zero card?

638
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,604
Team SNU in STEM doesn't.
What about the other two?

639
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,397
- Team KAIST has zero.
- Really?

640
00:30:57,481 --> 00:30:59,816
- Same with Team SNU in Medicine.
- Oh, yeah?

641
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,276
Then, let's use it ahead of them.

642
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,072
We only have a couple of rounds left.
Let's use "zero times blank" now.

643
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:07,324
If everyone uses that pair,
we all go down together.

644
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,451
Team KAIST will use the Turn Update card.

645
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:12,371
TEAM KAIST USES THE TURN UPDATE CARD

646
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:15,665
<i>In Dilemma of the Mean,</i>
<i>there are two special items.</i>

647
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:18,377
<i>The first item is the Turn Update card.</i>

648
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,588
<i>If this card, you can select</i>
<i>when to submit your equation.</i>

649
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:24,591
<i>The second item is the Reveal Only 1 card.</i>

650
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:28,345
<i>You can use this to mask</i>
<i>two cards of your equation.</i>

651
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,347
<i>Among these two special items,</i>

652
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:33,266
<i>each team can only use one</i>
<i>throughout the game.</i>

653
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:36,228
Team KAIST will use the Turn Update card.

654
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:39,689
We knew the fight for the Mean Match
would be intense.

655
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:43,860
So rather than taking part in that,
we wanted to claim a sure-win point

656
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:46,530
and prevent Team SKKU
from winning a point.

657
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:49,032
TEAM SKKU WAS TO GO FIRST

658
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:51,618
That means they're using
"zero times blank" now.

659
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:53,620
That complicates things for us.

660
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:55,789
They predicted our move.
I can't believe this.

661
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:57,207
What do we do now?

662
00:31:57,666 --> 00:32:00,752
Team KAIST used the Turn Update card.

663
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:02,921
Which turn would you like to take?

664
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:04,756
We'd like to go first.

665
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,508
- For the "zero times blank."
- You bet.

666
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,510
Great.

667
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:12,681
Our target mean will be 36 now.

668
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,558
- We're in big trouble.
- Yeah, really.

669
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,852
We can't meet the target mean.

670
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,354
<i>To reach 36,</i>

671
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:22,816
<i>we needed 4 times 9 or 3 times 12.</i>

672
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:25,819
<i>But my team had already used 12.</i>

673
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:28,113
<i>And if we had chosen to use 4 and 9,</i>

674
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:32,951
<i>we would've had to give up</i>
<i>our chain of five consecutive cards.</i>

675
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:37,289
Team SKKU already used 9 and 18.
They can't meet the target mean, right?

676
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:39,666
What about 3 times 12?

677
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:42,919
You're right.
They can use them because they have both.

678
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:44,171
But the moment they do,

679
00:32:44,254 --> 00:32:47,132
- their five consecutive numbers are gone.
- That breaks their chain.

680
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,259
That in itself is a victory for us.

681
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,344
If they have to use the minus card...

682
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:54,514
SEO-YEON HAS BEEN MONITORING TEAM SKKU
They need to use 37 minus 1

683
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:56,099
or 3 times 12.

684
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,393
Either way, they lose their chain.

685
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:01,188
Team SKKU, please submit your equation.

686
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:03,690
Don't we have to get 36 in the Mean Match?

687
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:06,860
We can use 12 times 3,
but that will break our number chain.

688
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:08,737
Do we keep the number chain or not?

689
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:12,157
Let's review the remaining cards.
We've got to do it now.

690
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,577
Let's stay calm and lay them all out.

691
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,663
We already used 26.

692
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,833
We still have 30 and 31.

693
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:24,127
To keep our chain,
we have to give up the Mean Match.

694
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:27,881
I say we give up the chain
and use 12 times 3.

695
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:31,301
<i>If we had given up the Mean Match,</i>
<i>some other team could've won two points.</i>

696
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:33,970
<i>So I thought it was wiser</i>
<i>not to give them the edge.</i>

697
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:37,057
Let's use smaller numbers
in case we get tied.

698
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,517
Smaller numbers are better.

699
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,143
GIVES UP ON THE CHAIN TO USE 5 AND 6

700
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,479
- Pick the useless ones.
- We've got to.

701
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,731
OPTS TO WIN 1 POINT LATER WITH THE CHAIN

702
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,280
All teams, please reveal the secret card.

703
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,995
MINIMUM MATCH IN ROUND 4
TEAM KAIST: 5

704
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,288
We made the logical choice.

705
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:03,124
- All right. We killed it.
- The timing was crazy.

706
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:06,419
The target mean in Round 4 is 36.

707
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:10,215
We lose if we miss
the golden opportunity to score.

708
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:12,300
Why not go for it when we can?

709
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:15,345
About Team KAIST.

710
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:19,307
Can they subtract a small number
from a big number to get 36?

711
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:22,394
Something like 37 minus 1.
If they can, we can skip this.

712
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,563
- Something like 37 minus 1?
- Can they do it?

713
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:25,772
No, they can't.

714
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:28,650
They used up from 0 to 12.

715
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,318
- Really?
- You have ten seconds left.

716
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:34,656
What a shame. If they can take this game,
we don't have to bother.

717
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:38,368
All teams, please submit your equations.

718
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,371
TEAM SNU IN STEM, TEAM SKKU

719
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:46,751
<i>Team SKKU and Team SNU in STEM</i>
<i>won a point each.</i>

720
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:49,963
Let us begin the Maximum Match of Round 5.

721
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:53,216
- We only have two rounds left, right?
- Yes.

722
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,969
Let's make sure we score
in the Maximum Match.

723
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:57,512
And in the Minimum Match with the zero.

724
00:34:57,596 --> 00:35:00,015
We still have our number chain.

725
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,434
If we and Team SKKU keep obtaining
a point each, we win.

726
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:03,560
- Right?
- Absolutely.

727
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:05,395
We have no reason to take risks.

728
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:06,938
That's true.

729
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:08,940
We should look carefree.

730
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:11,568
If we take too long,
they'll think we've overthought it.

731
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:14,321
Let's make it look
like we're using the times card.

732
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:16,448
Yeah, this is necessary
to win more than two points.

733
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,950
- Is this right?
- Yes, we ran the numbers.

734
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:24,914
They used 37 and 38.

735
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:29,502
We've got to use the times card
in the Minimum Match this round.

736
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,087
We should use the minus card now.

737
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,302
- Let's use the minus card now.
- Why?

738
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:40,680
I feel like we might need the plus card
in the Mean Match.

739
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:47,812
Team SKKU, please submit your equation.

740
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:51,316
This is our best bet.
We can't win without it.

741
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,952
We now have all four equations.

742
00:36:03,036 --> 00:36:05,455
All teams, please reveal the secret card.

743
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,626
- The minus card?
- The minus card.

744
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,503
Everything depends on their symbol.

745
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:12,796
TEAM KAIST: 1

746
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:15,382
TEAM SNU IN STEM: 75

747
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:17,384
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE: 29

748
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:20,095
TEAM SNU IN STEM IS LIKELY TO WIN

749
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,721
We're good
as long as Team SKKU doesn't win.

750
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:24,474
They wouldn't have used
the times card, right?

751
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:27,143
- That's too risky even for them.
- Let's see.

752
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:28,269
...the secret card.

753
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:30,021
We can take our time.

754
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:35,985
TEAM SKKU USED THE MULTIPLICATION CARD

755
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:37,654
TEAM SKKU'S UNEXPECTED VICTORY

756
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,239
Team SKKU got that point.

757
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:43,952
Team SNU in Medicine seems to be
trying to keep a chain.

758
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,329
Why don't we take advantage of that?

759
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:50,166
Because I was monitoring the cards
used by Team SNU in Medicine,

760
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:53,253
I could see that they were keeping
numbers near ten for a chain.

761
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:56,589
We can use 12 times 3,
but that will break our number chain.

762
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:59,342
TEAM SKKU GAVE UP ON THEIR NUMBER CHAIN

763
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:03,012
IF THEY GET A TIE, TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE
WILL WIN FROM THEIR BONUS POINT

764
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,557
Let's make an equation
with a bigger result than theirs.

765
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:08,893
<i>We saw Team SNU in Medicine</i>
<i>as our main rival for survival.</i>

766
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:13,690
TO SECURE 1 POINT,
TEAM SKKU USED THE MULTIPLICATION CARD

767
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:16,276
Team SKKU must've gone with that
because they could get 56, no?

768
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:17,193
You bet.

769
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:20,905
Their equation looks too calculated.
They definitely planned it.

770
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:24,075
Can Team SNU in Medicine get 56?

771
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:28,413
- Team SNU in Medicine can't get 56.
- They can't?

772
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:30,999
- For real? Did you check all the numbers?
- Yeah.

773
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:34,794
- We have the next game in the bag.
- Of course, we can't lose.

774
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:39,591
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE CAN'T MEET 56
WITH THEIR REMAINING CARDS

775
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:43,595
<i>Out of all the cases</i>
<i>where you could get 56 with the plus card,</i>

776
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:47,265
<i>none were in our arsenal.</i>

777
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:52,145
Team SKKU can get 56 with 27 plus 29.

778
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,400
Let us begin the Minimum Match of Round 5.

779
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:01,029
Team SNU in Medicine,
please submit your equation.

780
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,698
- We can't help it. This is all we have.
- It's our only option.

781
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:06,409
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE
TRIES TO SECURE 1 POINT WITH 0

782
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:10,246
The winning result
of the Minimum Match in Round 5 is zero.

783
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:15,210
Team SNU in Medicine won a point.

784
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:18,588
The target mean in Round 5 is 56.

785
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:23,092
Can Team SNU in STEM
get 56 with the times card?

786
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:24,844
With the times card?

787
00:38:26,513 --> 00:38:28,890
We need both teams to get it
so each would win only one point.

788
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:31,893
- Team SKKU has 27 and 29--
- We're screwed if either wins 2 points.

789
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,895
Do they have 7 and 8?

790
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:36,189
- Do they?
- Give me a minute.

791
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:38,775
IF TEAM SKKU WINS 2 POINTS,
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE WILL LOSE

792
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:41,069
Can Team SNU in STEM meet the goal?

793
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,530
- They can. They still have 27 and 29.
- Really?

794
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:45,490
Won't this work?

795
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,245
Your time is up.

796
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:53,498
All teams, please submit your equations.

797
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:54,916
ROUND 5 TARGET MEAN: 56

798
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:55,959
For now...

799
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,670
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE: 57

800
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:01,047
What's up with them?

801
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:05,385
TEAM SNU IN STEM FAILS TO MEET THE TARGET

802
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:07,846
I thought they had the cards.

803
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:10,849
All teams, please submit your equations.

804
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:13,768
- What's with them?
- Why 6 times 8?

805
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:15,395
That's just 48.

806
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:18,690
- Oh, they used the plus card already.
- Oh, right!

807
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:24,404
TEAM SKKU WINS 2 POINTS
IF TEAM KAIST FAILS TO MEET THE TARGET

808
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:27,949
TEAM KAIST: 56

809
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,075
They did it.

810
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:32,704
- Hey, Team KAIST did it.
- Right, they have 56.

811
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,372
- We're good now.
- They used the minus card.

812
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:35,832
TEAM KAIST AND TEAM SKKU WINS 1 POINT EACH

813
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:37,667
- If Team KAIST won...
- We're good.

814
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,127
It's all good now.

815
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,503
There we go.

816
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:42,797
THANKS TO TEAM SNU IN STEM'S FAILURE,
TEAM KAIST AND TEAM SKKU WON A POINT

817
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:44,591
Thank goodness.

818
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:45,925
The mind game with Team SKKU...

819
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:47,969
We can beat them. We have our chain.

820
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:49,095
That's true.

821
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:51,180
We're really close to survival now.

822
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:53,016
We're almost there. Let's keep it up.

823
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:58,354
<i>Team SKKU and Team KAIST won a point each.</i>

824
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:03,192
We don't have to worry
about elimination now.

825
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:06,237
We can win the Minimum Match
with our "zero times blank."

826
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:08,489
I'll use the Turn Update card
the moment the next round begins.

827
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,784
Let us begin the Maximum Match of Round 6.

828
00:40:12,452 --> 00:40:16,414
Team SKKU would like
to use the Turn Update card.

829
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,751
Which turn would you like to take?

830
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,878
We would like to go last.

831
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:22,879
TO GO FIRST IN THE MINIMUM MATCH

832
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:25,632
So they want to end it all
with the Minimum Match.

833
00:40:25,882 --> 00:40:26,716
Team KAIST,

834
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,051
Team SNU in STEM,

835
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:29,218
Team SNU in Medicine,

836
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,387
and Team SKKU.

837
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:33,973
That is the order of submission
in the next game.

838
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:36,351
It's time we decided on our opponent
for the Deathmatch.

839
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,269
Yeah, we can't get an upset win now.

840
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:39,520
The gap is too big.

841
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:42,649
So do we go with Team SNU in Medicine?

842
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:47,111
We can't exactly make Team KAIST
drop to the bottom, can we?

843
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:50,323
There's no way
we can take Team KAIST down now.

844
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:54,327
We should smash Team SNU in Medicine.

845
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:57,914
I think Team SNU in Medicine
is the right choice.

846
00:40:57,997 --> 00:40:59,749
I was ready to take them down.

847
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,584
Do we go out swinging now?

848
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:03,086
Team SNU in STEM...

849
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:05,088
We'd like to use a special item.

850
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:08,883
The Reveal 1 Number?

851
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:11,135
- No, the Reveal Only 1 card.
- Reveal Only 1.

852
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:15,139
Team SNU in STEM used
the Reveal Only 1 card.

853
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:18,518
You can reveal only one card
when you submit your equation.

854
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:23,731
Team KAIST, please submit your equation.

855
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:28,403
- This is our best set.
- Understood.

856
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:32,073
TEAM KAIST USES THEIR MINUS CARD
IN THE MAXIMUM MATCH

857
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:34,158
- That means they've given up this game.
- Of course.

858
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:35,076
What do we do?

859
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,578
- Which cards do we mask?
- Everything except the times card.

860
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:40,748
Showing only the times card ensures
that we win the Maximum Match.

861
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:41,916
- Like this?
- Yeah.

862
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:49,215
- Which large numbers do they have?
- I don't think it matters...

863
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:50,508
Yes, I'm sure of it.

864
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:51,718
Now that the times card is out,

865
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:54,178
Team SNU in Medicine can't win
the two remaining games now.

866
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:56,723
Team SNU in STEM used the times card.

867
00:41:57,849 --> 00:41:59,475
They used the times card.

868
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:01,769
That means we have to use it, too.

869
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:03,354
They're forcing our hand.

870
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:04,981
- Yeah, we've got to use it now.
- Right.

871
00:42:06,149 --> 00:42:08,192
This is it. There's no other way for us.

872
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:09,318
We can't risk a defeat.

873
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:14,532
- Our worst-case scenario is a tie.
- Right, if they win two points--

874
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:15,992
The absolute worst case is a tie.

875
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:20,163
Since the total of the remaining cards
works as a tiebreaker,

876
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:22,123
- I'd like to use smaller numbers first.
- Good call.

877
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:24,459
- I have them lined up here--
- We can use four, no?

878
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,044
- Sure.
- In that case...

879
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:29,672
TEAM SKKU CHOOSES TO DISCARD
SMALLER NUMBERS

880
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:32,008
Please reveal the secret card.

881
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:33,426
TEAM SKKU, TEAM KAIST

882
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:35,970
TEAM SNU IN STEM USED
THE MULTIPLICATION CARD

883
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:39,390
It's smaller than ours.

884
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:43,144
Team SNU in Medicine won a point.

885
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,479
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE: 6

886
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:47,148
Let us begin the Minimum Match of Round 6.

887
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,442
TEAM SKKU GOES FIRST
THANKS TO THE TURN UPDATE CARD

888
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:56,991
The winning result
of the Minimum Match in Round 6 is zero.

889
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,786
We have a one-point lead on Team KAIST.

890
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:00,703
TEAM SKKU: 7

891
00:43:00,787 --> 00:43:04,499
The Mean Match will be a watershed point.

892
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:08,878
<i>The target mean in Round 6 is 487.5.</i>

893
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:12,465
All teams, please submit your equations.

894
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:16,052
ROUND 6 TARGET MEAN: 487.5

895
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:17,720
Check with Team KAIST.

896
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:19,680
IF YOU DON'T MIND ME ASKING...

897
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:20,598
CAN YOU MEET THE TARGET?

898
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:22,100
YES!

899
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:23,142
They have it.

900
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:25,186
- They've got it.
- Really?

901
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:29,148
TEAM KAIST WINS

902
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:32,485
- What's with that freaky equation?
- Their result is so close to the target.

903
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:34,946
- They won 2 points.
- They got 483.

904
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:37,824
None of them can score.
They all used the times card.

905
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:40,243
Do we use these from the number chain?

906
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:42,495
We had been holding on
to our number chain,

907
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:44,914
but we noticed that we could win
the Mean Match at the end.

908
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:49,127
So we decided to give up the number chain
and win two points in the Mean Match.

909
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:53,506
<i>Team KAIST won two points.</i>

910
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:56,676
TEAM KAIST SECURES FIRST PLACE
IN DILEMMA OF THE MEAN

911
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,262
<i>We just made our way</i>
<i>from the redemption round.</i>

912
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:02,140
It was inspiring that we placed first
right after our return.

913
00:44:02,515 --> 00:44:05,643
<i>I felt like we proved our skills.</i>

914
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:08,855
- Props to Team KAIST.
- They're so good.

915
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:11,315
They almost got eliminated twice
but came on top this time.

916
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:12,650
- So good.
- They're scary.

917
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:14,485
They're amazing.

918
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:18,739
That concludes Round 6
of Dilemma of the Mean.

919
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:21,409
If you have a set of consecutive numbers,

920
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:24,453
please present the set.

921
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:25,872
"No team qualified."

922
00:44:25,955 --> 00:44:27,957
I think all three teams have them.

923
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:31,377
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE
CHECKS THE REMAINING CARDS

924
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,174
They have 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11.

925
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:39,510
We'd have won
if we had been playing poker.

926
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:45,808
<i>Team SNU in STEM and Team SNU in Medicine</i>

927
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:48,352
<i>won a bonus point.</i>

928
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:52,064
Now, the tiebreaker
will be the total of the remaining cards.

929
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:53,441
Team SKKU would have big numbers.

930
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:56,152
But they look so down.
Do they have small numbers?

931
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:58,571
- I doubt it.
- We'd have to go against them.

932
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:01,532
Come on, they're pretty strategic guys.

933
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:07,413
<i>Team SNU in Medicine</i>
<i>and Team SKKU are currently tied.</i>

934
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:10,249
<i>Based on the total</i>
<i>of the remaining cards...</i>

935
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:18,382
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE'S
REMAINING CARDS: 7, 8, 9, 10, AND 11

936
00:45:18,466 --> 00:45:21,469
TEAM SKKU'S TOTAL OF REMAINING CARDS
MUST BE OVER 45 TO WIN

937
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:24,388
<i>Based on the total</i>
<i>of the remaining cards...</i>

938
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:28,976
<i>Team SKKU takes the higher rank.</i>

939
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:35,483
TEAM SKKU'S REMAINING CARDS
28, 34, 35, 36, AND 37

940
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,026
<i>The lowest-ranking two teams,</i>

941
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:40,696
<i>Team SNU in Medicine and Team SNU in STEM,</i>

942
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:43,532
<i>please prepare for the Deathmatch.</i>

943
00:45:44,033 --> 00:45:45,034
We've got this.

944
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:47,620
I'm so relieved.

945
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:48,663
My gosh.

946
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,456
Would you look at that?

947
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:52,708
That match-up is fire.

948
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:54,710
We're seeing the infighting of Team SNUs.

949
00:45:55,044 --> 00:45:57,088
Which team will prove themselves
as the true Team SNU?

950
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:59,715
- This should be worth watching.
- Of course.

951
00:46:00,091 --> 00:46:01,342
Which team do you think will win?

952
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,219
My money is on Team SNU in Medicine.

953
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:05,596
- That's the general vibe.
- Yes.

954
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,349
Based on the general vibe
and how today's game went...

955
00:46:08,641 --> 00:46:11,811
- I'm going to root for Team SNU in STEM.
- Same.

956
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:17,024
We'll finally be able to gauge
each med student's strengths.

957
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:20,361
Let's pull through this Deathmatch.

958
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:22,863
We've got this.

959
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:27,326
<i>The lowest-ranking two teams,</i>

960
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:30,830
<i>Team SNU in Medicine and Team SNU in STEM,</i>

961
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:34,125
<i>please prepare for the Deathmatch.</i>

962
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,918
We can win this. Let's do our best.

963
00:46:36,127 --> 00:46:37,211
Let's focus.

964
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:39,505
We can beat anyone when we're in the zone.

965
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:44,719
<i>Surviving two teams,</i>
<i>please go to your base camps.</i>

966
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:54,478
<i>I was hoping to see</i>
<i>a match-up between the two Team SNUs.</i>

967
00:46:54,562 --> 00:46:58,357
<i>We'll be the ones advancing,</i>
<i>not Team SNU in STEM.</i>

968
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:00,860
Look at those menacing forearms.

969
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:02,945
PRETTY INTIMIDATING

970
00:47:08,868 --> 00:47:12,413
<i>We had a Deathmatch anyway.</i>
<i>Why not stake the title of Team SNU?</i>

971
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,874
<i>Our pride was at risk.</i>

972
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:17,418
<i>I was determined to win at all costs.</i>

973
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:19,295
My money is on Team SNU in STEM.

974
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:20,838
I think they're going to win.

975
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:22,590
Team SNU in STEM
has a star-studded roster.

976
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:25,676
These 3 ranked
in the top 4 of STEM Division.

977
00:47:26,135 --> 00:47:28,179
Team SNU in STEM
might have the upper hand.

978
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:30,639
- Still...
- But then again...

979
00:47:30,723 --> 00:47:32,725
Team SNU in Medicine
isn't exactly outmatched.

980
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:35,227
- Seo-yeon...
- She placed third.

981
00:47:35,311 --> 00:47:37,188
- Seung-hyeon placed fourth.
- Seung-hyeon...

982
00:47:38,481 --> 00:47:41,567
<i>Today's Deathmatch is</i>

983
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,277
<i>Block Connect Five.</i>

984
00:47:45,738 --> 00:47:47,323
- Finally.
- We've been waiting for this.

985
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:48,449
We needed that.

986
00:47:48,908 --> 00:47:50,242
Connect Five.

987
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:51,744
I like it.

988
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:53,621
Connect Five with blocks?

989
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:55,122
<i>In Block Connect Five,</i>

990
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:57,500
<i>you will be given 3D pieces.</i>

991
00:47:57,583 --> 00:48:01,879
<i>The first to form a block of five cells</i>
<i>wins the game.</i>

992
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:04,632
It's three-dimensional.

993
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,342
It's three-dimensional Connect Five.

994
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:08,803
Oh, shoot. That looks like so much fun.

995
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:14,892
<i>The game will be played on a 5-by-5 board.</i>

996
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:20,189
<i>Each player will be given five pieces</i>
<i>in either black or white.</i>

997
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:21,941
<i>Among the five pieces,</i>

998
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:25,653
<i>one immovable piece will be in place</i>
<i>before the game begins.</i>

999
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,363
<i>When the game begins,</i>

1000
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:31,158
1-MINUTE DEADLINE
<i>you will take turns to place a piece.</i>

1001
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:34,078
<i>There are two ways</i>
<i>to place a piece on the board.</i>

1002
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:35,746
<i>First,</i>

1003
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:36,997
<i>you can place a piece</i>

1004
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:40,501
<i>so that its three-cell side</i>
<i>meets the board.</i>

1005
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:42,503
<i>Second,</i>

1006
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:46,674
<i>you can place your piece</i>
<i>on top of a piece already on the board.</i>

1007
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:52,179
<i>Please remember that the one-cell side</i>
<i>must meet the board.</i>

1008
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:54,682
They can't use the two-cell side.

1009
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:57,143
- This is out of the option.
- That's right.

1010
00:48:57,393 --> 00:48:58,978
To place your piece above another one,

1011
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:03,065
you need to find a perch
to fit in the reverse L shape.

1012
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:05,568
<i>Additionally, you cannot place your piece</i>

1013
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:08,779
<i>in the highlighted area</i>
<i>until your second turn.</i>

1014
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:13,451
<i>From the point where all five pieces</i>
<i>of both players are on the board,</i>

1015
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:17,079
<i>you may start moving your pieces.</i>

1016
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:22,293
<i>However, if your opponent's piece</i>
<i>is resting on top of yours,</i>

1017
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:24,295
<i>you cannot move it.</i>

1018
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:25,754
A stack like this

1019
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:28,591
can limit your opponent's movement
while securing two cells.

1020
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:30,759
Yes, you claim two cells.

1021
00:49:30,843 --> 00:49:33,053
It's no good to have it at the bottom.

1022
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:34,972
<i>In the bird's-eye view,</i>

1023
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:39,143
<i>the player who successfully connects</i>
<i>five cells in their color wins.</i>

1024
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:42,021
- The bird's-eye view is the guide.
- From the top?

1025
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:44,690
- It's going to be so confusing.
- I know.

1026
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:47,693
Wow, that's way too advanced.

1027
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:49,487
This tests your spatial awareness.

1028
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:51,280
Not just spatial awareness, though.

1029
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:53,157
Your strategic thinking, too.

1030
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:56,827
<i>There will be five rounds in total.</i>

1031
00:49:56,911 --> 00:49:59,580
<i>Each round will be played</i>
<i>on a one-on-one basis.</i>

1032
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:03,083
<i>Rounds 1 to 4 require different players,</i>
<i>but anyone can participate in Round 5.</i>

1033
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:04,835
Everyone has to participate.

1034
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:06,462
All four of us must compete.

1035
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:07,630
How stressful.

1036
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:10,132
Everyone gets to fight once,
and then the clash of Ace players.

1037
00:50:10,216 --> 00:50:12,051
Let's not play all five rounds.

1038
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:14,428
- Let's end it in three rounds.
- All right.

1039
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:17,806
- We'll be able to find the winning moves.
- I think so, too.

1040
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:21,560
- Is there something like a double-three?
- That's what I also wonder.

1041
00:50:21,936 --> 00:50:25,898
<i>As Team SNU in Medicine</i>
<i>won more points in the main match,</i>

1042
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:29,276
<i>they will decide</i>
<i>which team goes first in Round 1.</i>

1043
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,612
<i>Both teams,</i>
<i>please start discussing your strategies.</i>

1044
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:34,323
<i>You'll be given 20 minutes.</i>

1045
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:37,451
Team SNU in STEM has that tactician
in the top 0.6% in chess.

1046
00:50:37,535 --> 00:50:40,496
Let's say Gang-hyeon gets a win.

1047
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:44,124
But he won't get another shot
if the other three med guys win.

1048
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:47,086
What if he teaches the strategy
to his teammates?

1049
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:48,003
That could work.

1050
00:50:48,087 --> 00:50:49,713
- He could spoon-feed them.
- Right.

1051
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:52,049
SPOON-FEEDING NOW
The first player has to do this.

1052
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:55,094
We're working with the premise
that the first player does this.

1053
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:58,305
There's no way they wouldn't.
The center is way too valuable.

1054
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:01,892
<i>Since we can get</i>
<i>a diagonal five-cell block...</i>

1055
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:06,272
<i>We assumed that the first player</i>
<i>would claim the center cell first.</i>

1056
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:07,856
When we're going first...

1057
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:10,693
TARGETING THE CENTER
SAME AS TEAM SNU IN STEM

1058
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:14,321
It's because if we have the center,
we have four options to spread out.

1059
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:15,698
One, two, three, and four.

1060
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:17,992
If we claim a corner,
we only have three options.

1061
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:21,745
It's clear that we must claim the center
when we're going first.

1062
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:23,539
I think we should try to layer more.

1063
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:27,084
They become immovable.
The opponent can't move their own piece.

1064
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:29,336
Laying a piece flat on the board
is disadvantageous--

1065
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:33,799
We're virtually giving them a chance
to place their piece above it.

1066
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:35,342
It's better to layer our piece
above another

1067
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:36,969
because the opponent can't move it.

1068
00:51:37,303 --> 00:51:39,138
You can't cover up the second layer.

1069
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:41,765
Place a piece flat,
and we gain three cells.

1070
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:43,642
But place it upright,
and we gain two cells

1071
00:51:43,726 --> 00:51:44,977
while eliminating a cell for them.

1072
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:47,146
We can move our piece around,
whereas they're stuck.

1073
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:49,565
Exactly. We can hold them down.

1074
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:52,443
But placing our piece on top of theirs
might not always be good.

1075
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:53,444
<i>What if we remove a piece</i>

1076
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:55,613
<i>and end up completing</i>
<i>a five-cell block for them?</i>

1077
00:51:55,696 --> 00:51:57,781
YOUR OPPONENT WINS

1078
00:51:57,865 --> 00:52:00,618
We have to know what's underneath
before we decide to move a piece.

1079
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,078
Once you grab a piece,
there's no going back.

1080
00:52:03,162 --> 00:52:06,290
Think carefully in advance
because the first layer is invisible.

1081
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:08,709
It's pretty confusing
when you look at the board this way.

1082
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:10,085
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE PLAYS TRIAL GAMES

1083
00:52:10,169 --> 00:52:12,630
I think this is a pretty good move.

1084
00:52:12,713 --> 00:52:15,007
ALL PIECES HAVE BEEN PLACED

1085
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:17,176
We can now move them, right?

1086
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:19,136
What can I move now? Nothing much.

1087
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:21,764
Just these three, right?

1088
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:24,099
There's this term
called zugzwang in chess.

1089
00:52:24,183 --> 00:52:26,268
So basically,

1090
00:52:26,352 --> 00:52:29,355
it's a situation
where all your pieces are engaged.

1091
00:52:29,438 --> 00:52:33,317
No pieces are free to move,
so you end up making a bad move.

1092
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,987
I think we might see a similar moment
in Block Connect Five.

1093
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:41,116
What's the setup
that will guarantee me a win?

1094
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,160
- That's what I'm trying to find.
- We need it.

1095
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:44,411
Like the double-three--

1096
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:47,039
Yes, something
like the double-three in Connect Five...

1097
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:50,042
- We need to find that ultimate move.
- Exactly.

1098
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:52,419
We'll probably go second
in Rounds 1 and 3.

1099
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:55,422
It's as good as fixed.

1100
00:52:55,506 --> 00:52:58,717
- Gang-hyeon and I can take on one each.
- We could do that.

1101
00:52:59,218 --> 00:53:00,302
I'm feeling pretty good.

1102
00:53:00,386 --> 00:53:02,096
- Let's do as you say.
- Okay.

1103
00:53:02,805 --> 00:53:05,683
It's all about not slipping up.
Take time to think it through.

1104
00:53:05,766 --> 00:53:06,684
I trust you.

1105
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:08,394
Let me have at it.

1106
00:53:08,477 --> 00:53:09,895
ROUND 1: KIM DONG-GEON
ROUND 2: SONG MYEONG-SU

1107
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:11,355
ROUND 3: KIM GANG-HYEON
ROUND 4: HAN JONG-YUN

1108
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:12,898
ROUND 1: JOO MIN-SEO
ROUND 2: LEE SEUNG-HYEON

1109
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:14,316
ROUND 3: HAN SEO-YEON
ROUND 4: KIM MIN-SEOK

1110
00:53:14,775 --> 00:53:17,528
<i>The time for strategy meeting is up.</i>

1111
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:22,032
<i>Both teams, please gather</i>
<i>at the main hall for the Deathmatch.</i>

1112
00:53:22,116 --> 00:53:23,826
- SNU!
- For independence!

1113
00:53:24,118 --> 00:53:26,245
- Let's go, SNU!
- Let's go, SNU!

1114
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:28,831
We've got this.

1115
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:38,215
They'll probably feel uneasy
because we get to go first in Round 1.

1116
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:41,677
Let's relax.

1117
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,554
Why do I feel like we're going to win?

1118
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:45,264
You feel like we're going to win?

1119
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:48,058
Well, I'd say that's just normal

1120
00:53:48,142 --> 00:53:50,018
because we're obviously going to win.

1121
00:53:52,104 --> 00:53:53,522
FIRST-EVER TEAM SNU SHOWDOWN

1122
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:56,817
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE VS TEAM SNU IN STEM

1123
00:53:57,609 --> 00:54:01,864
We'll now begin Round 1
of the Deathmatch, Block Connect Five.

1124
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:04,408
<i>Which team will win</i>
<i>the battle of Team SNUs?</i>

1125
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:08,537
All four members have to battle it out.
We'll see what everyone is made of.

1126
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:11,415
It will decide which is the true Team SNU.

1127
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:14,710
Players competing in Round 1
are Team SNU in Medicine's Joo Min-seo

1128
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:18,213
and Team SNU in STEM's Kim Dong-geon.

1129
00:54:18,297 --> 00:54:20,090
One of them has to bear the dishonor

1130
00:54:20,174 --> 00:54:22,342
of being the first Team SNU
to be eliminated.

1131
00:54:23,469 --> 00:54:24,845
That sounds so crazy.

1132
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:26,764
What's more, they come in fourth.

1133
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:28,515
This decides fourth place?

1134
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:30,392
This is way too intense.

1135
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:33,812
As Team SNU in Medicine
held a higher rank in the main match,

1136
00:54:33,896 --> 00:54:36,148
their player will decide who goes first.

1137
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:38,150
We'll go first.

1138
00:54:40,194 --> 00:54:41,737
Are you sure about this?

1139
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:43,989
Of course.

1140
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:49,620
<i>I was sure I could beat the disadvantage.</i>
<i>I felt confident going in.</i>

1141
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:51,747
First player, please place a piece.

1142
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:53,248
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE'S TURN

1143
00:54:55,167 --> 00:54:57,836
She has to go for the center.

1144
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:03,217
That's a shocker.

1145
00:55:07,596 --> 00:55:11,517
AGAINST ALL EXPECTATION,
JOO MIN-SEO DIDN'T CLAIM THE CENTER

1146
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:16,605
<i>My team concluded that the first player</i>
<i>had to take the center at the outset.</i>

1147
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:19,942
<i>So Min-seo's first move was unexpected.</i>

1148
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:21,151
<i>It threw me off,</i>

1149
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:24,112
<i>but I still thought it was important</i>
<i>to take the center.</i>

1150
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:35,499
JOO MIN-SEO HAS A 4-CELL BLOCK

1151
00:55:35,958 --> 00:55:36,792
Hey, she won.

1152
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:39,419
What the heck?

1153
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:41,839
It's basically over, isn't it?

1154
00:55:42,631 --> 00:55:43,590
What?

1155
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:46,093
- She won.
- We won.

1156
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:47,511
He didn't come prepared.

1157
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:48,929
DURING STRATEGY MEETING

1158
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,931
What's the setup
that will guarantee me a win?

1159
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:53,433
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE FOCUSED
ON FINDING ULTIMATE MOVES

1160
00:55:53,517 --> 00:55:56,645
Because we'd be going first in Round 1...

1161
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:59,022
We tried to find ways
for the first player to secure victory.

1162
00:55:59,106 --> 00:56:03,527
While searching for the moves
that would allow us to win...

1163
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:05,571
Hey, the game's over.

1164
00:56:05,654 --> 00:56:06,947
- We start from here, right?
- Yes.

1165
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,365
Let's say...

1166
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:09,575
We place it like this.

1167
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:13,620
We learned that it was critical
to claim the 4-by-4 point.

1168
00:56:13,704 --> 00:56:16,039
Let's say we took it on our first move.

1169
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:18,792
<i>If the opponent didn't defend properly,</i>

1170
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:23,088
we could complete our five-cell block
with the pieces in the second layer.

1171
00:56:23,422 --> 00:56:27,426
<i>Even if the opponent places a piece</i>
<i>in the first layer as a defense,</i>

1172
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:30,429
<i>you can place your piece over it</i>
<i>to complete a five-cell block.</i>

1173
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:31,638
<i>If they don't,</i>

1174
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:35,642
<i>you can place your piece on the board</i>
<i>to get a five-cell block.</i>

1175
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:38,770
We now have one way to secure a win.

1176
00:56:38,854 --> 00:56:40,314
We can win with this.

1177
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:44,318
AS PLANNED,
JOO MIN-SEO CLAIMS THE 4-BY-4 POINT

1178
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:47,154
THE RED POINT MUST BE DEFENDED

1179
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:50,490
BUT KIM DONG-GEON DIDN'T GRASP
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE'S STRATEGY

1180
00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:01,084
Shoot, I missed that.

1181
00:57:05,631 --> 00:57:09,551
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE'S 5-CELL BLOCK

1182
00:57:09,635 --> 00:57:13,096
<i>It must've been</i>
<i>a huge surprise to Dong-geon.</i>

1183
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:15,724
Our plan worked. He didn't see it coming.

1184
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:20,312
<i>I realized that Team SNU in Medicine</i>
<i>came well-prepared.</i>

1185
00:57:21,021 --> 00:57:25,817
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE: 1,
TEAM SNU IN STEM: 0

1186
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:29,363
Kudos to your hard work.

1187
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:31,281
I can't believe I missed that.

1188
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,285
- That was a finisher.
- I know.

1189
00:57:35,911 --> 00:57:36,995
We can win when we go first.

1190
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:38,246
What do I do?

1191
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:39,873
- What?
- What should I lead with?

1192
00:57:39,957 --> 00:57:42,209
We have our strategy.

1193
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:43,669
You can follow the plan.

1194
00:57:44,044 --> 00:57:47,005
That was the fastest defeat on record.

1195
00:57:47,089 --> 00:57:47,923
Dong-geon lost...

1196
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:49,883
- I can't believe it.
- Me neither.

1197
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:52,344
- That was a given.
- It was perfect.

1198
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:54,137
Simply perfect, just as we planned.

1199
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:55,681
- Good luck.
- Great job.

1200
00:57:56,098 --> 00:57:58,850
We know our strategy best,
so they can't use it against us.

1201
00:57:58,934 --> 00:58:01,353
Of course. We've got this.

1202
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:03,689
How do we counter that strategy?

1203
00:58:03,772 --> 00:58:05,691
With good defense.

1204
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:08,068
Good. We won the first round.

1205
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:10,070
Yes, I bet their morale is crushed.

1206
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:15,200
Looks like Seung-hyeon is up next.

1207
00:58:16,118 --> 00:58:17,077
It's okay.

1208
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:18,954
Let's do our thing, okay?

1209
00:58:19,788 --> 00:58:21,707
BLOCK CONNECT FIVE
ROUND 2

1210
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:27,379
ROUND 2 PLAYER OF TEAM SNU IN STEM
SONG MYEONG-SU

1211
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:29,589
- You've got this. Get us the win.
- Good luck.

1212
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:31,591
ROUND 2 PLAYER OF TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE
LEE SEUNG-HYEON

1213
00:58:34,553 --> 00:58:38,807
<i>I saw Seung-hyeon as the best tactician</i>
<i>of Team SNU in Medicine.</i>

1214
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:42,728
<i>I thought defeating him</i>
<i>would turn the tide in my team's favor.</i>

1215
00:58:42,978 --> 00:58:47,315
As Team SNU in STEM lost Round 1,
their player will decide who goes first.

1216
00:58:47,399 --> 00:58:48,942
TEAM SNU IN STEM

1217
00:58:49,026 --> 00:58:50,318
I'll go first.

1218
00:58:51,403 --> 00:58:52,654
Please place your piece.

1219
00:58:52,738 --> 00:58:53,613
TEAM SNU IN STEM'S TURN

1220
00:58:53,697 --> 00:58:56,950
How would Seung-hyeon react
if Myeong-su used their previous tactic?

1221
00:58:57,034 --> 00:59:00,537
Would he go for a new hack
or nab the center cell?

1222
00:59:01,413 --> 00:59:04,124
<i>I did consider</i>
<i>using the opponent's strategy</i>

1223
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:06,376
<i>because it was incredible.</i>

1224
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:08,670
BEFORE ROUND 2
Should I copy their plan?

1225
00:59:08,754 --> 00:59:10,005
- From just now?
- Yes.

1226
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:12,758
But that's a tool
they know better than we do.

1227
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:17,596
<i>But it seemed too risky to try</i>
<i>a strategy that I didn't know well.</i>

1228
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:19,181
<i>So I went with our original plan.</i>

1229
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:22,392
CLAIMS THE CENTER AS PLANNED

1230
00:59:22,476 --> 00:59:23,852
Nice and easy.

1231
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:26,354
I don't think we can call it a bad choice.

1232
00:59:32,486 --> 00:59:33,695
<i>You have 30 seconds left.</i>

1233
00:59:33,779 --> 00:59:34,738
Guys.

1234
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:36,698
How do you defend against this?

1235
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:39,534
- You get a double-three.
- You can't counter that.

1236
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:43,955
<i>If Myeong-su places his piece</i>
<i>like the graphic on screen,</i>

1237
00:59:44,039 --> 00:59:46,249
<i>he can get a double-three in his color.</i>

1238
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:49,252
<i>Regardless of what Seung-hyeon does next,</i>

1239
00:59:49,336 --> 00:59:53,215
<i>Myeong-su can get a five-cell block</i>
<i>no matter what.</i>

1240
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:09,523
SONG MYEONG-SU PLACES HIS PIECE ELSEWHERE

1241
01:00:10,232 --> 01:00:13,819
<i>I was so relieved</i>
<i>to have narrowly escaped the danger.</i>

1242
01:00:13,902 --> 01:00:15,529
- That would've ended it.
- Sure.

1243
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:17,864
It's a pity Myeong-su didn't see this.

1244
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:21,076
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE'S 4-CELL BLOCK

1245
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:23,578
DEFENDS SUCCESSFULLY

1246
01:00:25,497 --> 01:00:27,374
ATTACKS WITH ANOTHER 4-CELL BLOCK

1247
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:29,960
Myeong-su should put a piece
on top of his own, no?

1248
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:31,128
Sure.

1249
01:00:31,211 --> 01:00:32,838
That puts Myeong-su at a disadvantage.

1250
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:36,091
<i>He lost the edge of going first.</i>

1251
01:00:39,511 --> 01:00:41,012
All right, good job.

1252
01:00:41,096 --> 01:00:43,807
Defense and offense at the same time.
Good call.

1253
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:46,268
<i>Seung-hyeon has to find a way</i>
<i>to counter it.</i>

1254
01:00:48,728 --> 01:00:50,856
There we go.

1255
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:53,984
All pieces have been placed.

1256
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:56,653
Song Myeong-su, please move a piece.

1257
01:01:04,452 --> 01:01:05,912
Leaving the center open?

1258
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:08,081
He can't do much, can he?

1259
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:11,334
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE'S 4-CELL BLOCK

1260
01:01:20,844 --> 01:01:23,054
Both of them are running a tight ship.

1261
01:01:23,138 --> 01:01:25,557
They'll have to wait
for the other to mess up.

1262
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:29,978
BOTH DEFEND WITHOUT A MISTAKE

1263
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:31,521
You have 30 seconds left.

1264
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:33,690
This is frustrating.

1265
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:36,151
<i>I don't see</i>
<i>any offense options for Myeong-su.</i>

1266
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:38,069
Song Myeong-su will now take his turn.

1267
01:01:38,153 --> 01:01:39,863
Lee Seung-hyeon will now take his turn.

1268
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:41,781
Song Myeong-su will now take his turn.

1269
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:44,075
Lee Seung-hyeon will now take his turn.

1270
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:45,952
Song Myeong-su will now take his turn.

1271
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:48,038
<i>I was forced to be on defense,</i>

1272
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:51,708
<i>so I kept thinking about ways</i>
<i>to turn the tables.</i>

1273
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:05,430
Isn't that cell indefensible?
You can't place one here.

1274
01:02:05,764 --> 01:02:09,267
<i>Lee Seung-hyeon just built</i>
<i>a four-cell block.</i>

1275
01:02:09,351 --> 01:02:14,105
<i>As a piece cannot be placed</i>
<i>on its one-cell side without a perch,</i>

1276
01:02:14,189 --> 01:02:17,859
<i>Myeong-su cannot place</i>
<i>a new piece in the highlighted spot.</i>

1277
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:21,404
He can't do anything
about that lower right corner.

1278
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,866
<i>Since I couldn't see</i>
<i>a suitable move for defense...</i>

1279
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:29,454
- An attack with a four-cell block.
- So that's his next move.

1280
01:02:29,663 --> 01:02:32,290
<i>- That calls for defense.</i>
<i>- Of course.</i>

1281
01:02:36,211 --> 01:02:38,046
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE'S 5-CELL BLOCK

1282
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:41,258
Oh, I didn't realize
he could cap it off with that piece.

1283
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:43,176
That never occurred to me.

1284
01:02:51,351 --> 01:02:52,769
It's 2 to 0 now.

1285
01:02:54,646 --> 01:02:55,855
That was fire.

1286
01:02:55,939 --> 01:02:58,358
- Props to him.
- That never crossed my mind.

1287
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:03,071
Team SNU in Medicine's Lee Seung-hyeon
won Round 2 of Block Connect Five.

1288
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:07,242
I kept telling myself
I shouldn't miss Myeong-su's mistake.

1289
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:10,120
<i>That mindset probably gave me the victory.</i>

1290
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:12,455
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE: 2
TEAM SNU IN STEM: 0

1291
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:15,583
He beat the second player's disadvantage.
Kudos, Seung-hyeon.

1292
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:17,002
Well done.

1293
01:03:17,252 --> 01:03:18,753
My bad. I didn't catch that.

1294
01:03:18,837 --> 01:03:19,921
I missed it.

1295
01:03:20,005 --> 01:03:23,258
There was no stopping his final move.

1296
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:25,885
<i>I felt terrible for my teammates</i>

1297
01:03:25,969 --> 01:03:29,180
<i>for adding to the pressure</i>
<i>with another defeat.</i>

1298
01:03:29,556 --> 01:03:31,016
- Going first?
- What?

1299
01:03:31,099 --> 01:03:33,226
- You'll go first, right?
- Of course.

1300
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:34,686
Win for us, Gang-hyeon.

1301
01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:36,730
All right.

1302
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:41,776
The two remaining players are solid.
It's Mr. Chess and Mr. Han Jong-yun.

1303
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:44,612
Anything can happen in Deathmatches.

1304
01:03:44,696 --> 01:03:46,823
Maybe they reserved their best players.

1305
01:03:46,906 --> 01:03:52,037
They could study the opponents' tactics
and crush them in the later rounds.

1306
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:54,456
Are we hoping to see
Jong-yun on a rampage?

1307
01:03:54,998 --> 01:03:58,710
Both teams, please decide
on who will compete in Round 3.

1308
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:02,589
<i>My victory would complete</i>
<i>a 3-0 clean sweep for my team,</i>

1309
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:05,133
<i>so I was determined to win.</i>

1310
01:04:05,633 --> 01:04:08,511
<i>I had to win to keep my team in the game,</i>

1311
01:04:08,595 --> 01:04:10,722
<i>so I felt more driven to concentrate.</i>

1312
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:12,098
Please come to the stage.

1313
01:04:12,766 --> 01:04:14,351
- Hello.
- Hello.

1314
01:04:17,645 --> 01:04:20,106
Team SNU in Medicine won
both rounds so far.

1315
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:21,024
You're right.

1316
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:23,193
This round could decide the match.

1317
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:24,736
He's got to step up his game.

1318
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:29,741
<i>We all knew how brilliant Gang-hyeon is,</i>
<i>so I felt certain he would get us the win.</i>

1319
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,993
<i>Because my team had done so well,</i>

1320
01:04:32,077 --> 01:04:35,246
<i>I expected to see</i>
<i>an overwhelming clean sweep.</i>

1321
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:40,251
As Team SNU in STEM lost Round 2,
their player will decide who goes first.

1322
01:04:40,335 --> 01:04:41,711
I'll go first.

1323
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:45,006
Please place a piece.

1324
01:04:50,512 --> 01:04:51,971
Going for the center again.

1325
01:04:52,055 --> 01:04:53,556
I bet Seo-yeon has a counter.

1326
01:04:54,099 --> 01:04:55,892
You have 30 seconds left.

1327
01:05:06,236 --> 01:05:08,947
HAN SEO-YEON'S DEFENSE

1328
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:12,409
I say Seo-yeon has a solid game plan,

1329
01:05:12,492 --> 01:05:14,744
and Gang-hyeon adapts his
to counter her moves.

1330
01:05:14,828 --> 01:05:17,414
Adaptability is
every STEM student's middle name.

1331
01:05:25,505 --> 01:05:29,509
It's all about rearranging pieces now
since they don't have any good openings.

1332
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:32,804
The more I watch the game,
the more important the second layer seems.

1333
01:05:38,977 --> 01:05:41,396
She has to defend that spot.

1334
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:48,778
All pieces have been placed.

1335
01:05:49,737 --> 01:05:51,489
Good, that's our only option.

1336
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:54,742
GANG-HYEON TURNS A PIECE UPRIGHT

1337
01:05:54,826 --> 01:05:56,619
Things are getting heated
for the second layer.

1338
01:05:56,703 --> 01:05:58,455
Nothing stands out to me.

1339
01:05:58,538 --> 01:06:00,331
I don't see anything, either.

1340
01:06:03,751 --> 01:06:06,171
She has to turn a piece.
There's no other choice.

1341
01:06:06,254 --> 01:06:07,881
That's her only option.

1342
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:09,674
She has to keep turning pieces.

1343
01:06:13,011 --> 01:06:17,015
Nothing strikes me as a compelling move,
but I feel hesitant to comment.

1344
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:19,184
What if one move turns out to be pivotal?

1345
01:06:19,267 --> 01:06:22,770
I think you need to look five moves ahead
before reaching a decision.

1346
01:06:39,204 --> 01:06:41,498
<i>I did consider making a change first,</i>

1347
01:06:41,581 --> 01:06:44,959
<i>but I couldn't risk losing,</i>
<i>so I opted for a conservative approach.</i>

1348
01:06:46,377 --> 01:06:47,712
He made the right choice.

1349
01:06:47,795 --> 01:06:49,255
He has to if he wants to win.

1350
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:51,132
If he loses, he's going home.

1351
01:06:51,216 --> 01:06:53,510
This could be it for his team.
He has to win.

1352
01:06:56,888 --> 01:06:59,265
<i>- Both are being cautious.</i>
<i>- It's a Deathmatch.</i>

1353
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:01,976
<i>We were just as cautious</i>
<i>in our Deathmatch.</i>

1354
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:04,604
She can keep at it
and wait for him to mess up.

1355
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:06,439
- She can strike then.
- Sure.

1356
01:07:06,523 --> 01:07:09,526
She's not moving any of the pieces
she placed on top of Gang-hyeon's.

1357
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:15,573
We can't afford to lose this time.

1358
01:07:16,491 --> 01:07:20,370
<i>It didn't seem like I could win</i>
<i>with the endless deadlock.</i>

1359
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:22,580
<i>So I decided to break it with a surprise.</i>

1360
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:24,123
He's trying something.

1361
01:07:29,963 --> 01:07:31,673
Gang-hyeon took a gamble.

1362
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:45,019
She can move the piece far up the board.
He can't try anything there.

1363
01:07:45,103 --> 01:07:48,314
- You're right.
- See? She's going to win in two turns.

1364
01:07:48,648 --> 01:07:52,819
<i>If Seo-yeon moves the highlighted piece</i>
<i>as shown on screen</i>

1365
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:55,196
<i>and lays the next piece flat</i>
<i>on her next turn,</i>

1366
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:58,116
<i>she can complete her five-cell block.</i>

1367
01:07:58,449 --> 01:08:01,244
- Come on.
- Please catch that.

1368
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:03,621
- Come on, girl.
- You have five seconds left.

1369
01:08:08,876 --> 01:08:09,961
She saw it.

1370
01:08:11,296 --> 01:08:12,171
There we go.

1371
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:24,976
TEAM SNU IN STEM'S 5-CELL BLOCK

1372
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:27,895
<i>I felt a rush of relief.</i>

1373
01:08:28,313 --> 01:08:32,483
Actually, I left the center open
at one point.

1374
01:08:32,567 --> 01:08:34,861
HAN SEO-YEON CLAIMED THE CENTER

1375
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:38,698
<i>And she never moved that piece afterward.</i>

1376
01:08:39,866 --> 01:08:43,995
<i>I thought I had to reclaim it to win,</i>

1377
01:08:45,038 --> 01:08:46,873
<i>so I lured her into taking it away.</i>

1378
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:48,666
Gang-hyeon took a gamble.

1379
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:49,834
HIS PLAN WORKED

1380
01:08:49,917 --> 01:08:53,921
<i>When my trick worked,</i>
<i>I felt convinced I could win.</i>

1381
01:08:54,005 --> 01:08:56,132
KIM GANG-HYEON TOOK THE CENTER RIGHT AWAY

1382
01:08:57,008 --> 01:09:00,219
Team SNU in STEM's Kim Gang-hyeon
completed a five-cell block.

1383
01:09:00,303 --> 01:09:02,221
Only he could've pulled off
that masterstroke.

1384
01:09:05,475 --> 01:09:07,644
As expected from the chess master.

1385
01:09:07,727 --> 01:09:09,270
How clever.

1386
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:13,941
Team SNU in STEM's Kim Gang-hyeon
won Round 3 of Block Connect Five.

1387
01:09:17,779 --> 01:09:19,405
We'll have to prime you for Round 5.

1388
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:21,866
- Get ready for another round.
- Of course.

1389
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:23,660
It's going as I planned.

1390
01:09:23,743 --> 01:09:26,412
Older members covering
for the younger members.

1391
01:09:26,621 --> 01:09:29,457
- I'm so sorry for missing the final move.
- It's okay.

1392
01:09:30,375 --> 01:09:31,834
<i>I was grateful that I won.</i>

1393
01:09:32,085 --> 01:09:35,880
<i>I hoped Jong-yun would win Round 4</i>
<i>so I could secure our survival in Round 5.</i>

1394
01:09:36,381 --> 01:09:37,840
I messed up.

1395
01:09:38,299 --> 01:09:40,885
<i>I got so caught up</i>
<i>in looking for possible attacks</i>

1396
01:09:40,968 --> 01:09:43,012
<i>that I missed the implication</i>
<i>of Gang-hyeon's move.</i>

1397
01:09:43,096 --> 01:09:44,722
<i>I was very disappointed.</i>

1398
01:09:45,098 --> 01:09:48,476
We'll now begin Round 4
of the Deathmatch, Block Connect Five.

1399
01:09:49,143 --> 01:09:51,896
Players competing in Round 4
are Team SNU in STEM's Han Jong-yun

1400
01:09:51,979 --> 01:09:54,691
and Team SNU in Medicine's Kim Min-seok.

1401
01:09:54,774 --> 01:09:56,025
Please come to the stage.

1402
01:09:59,779 --> 01:10:03,950
As Team SNU in Medicine lost Round 4,
their player will decide who goes first.

1403
01:10:04,242 --> 01:10:05,660
I'll go first.

1404
01:10:06,244 --> 01:10:08,996
Team SNU in Medicine's Kim Min-seok
will go first.

1405
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:10,289
Please place your piece.

1406
01:10:13,918 --> 01:10:16,713
- He needs to seal that spot.
- Yeah, then we're good.

1407
01:10:20,842 --> 01:10:22,260
Okay, so far, so good.

1408
01:10:31,811 --> 01:10:33,020
It's over, isn't it?

1409
01:10:33,104 --> 01:10:34,772
You bet. He's unstoppable now.

1410
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:36,607
He wins with a block over there.

1411
01:10:36,691 --> 01:10:37,900
Oh, it's over.

1412
01:10:37,984 --> 01:10:39,861
With a block here,

1413
01:10:39,944 --> 01:10:42,280
BECAUSE OF THE 4-CELL BLOCK
it's over.

1414
01:10:42,572 --> 01:10:46,617
<i>Suppose that Jong-yun built</i>
<i>a four-cell block in this turn.</i>

1415
01:10:46,701 --> 01:10:49,996
<i>If Min-seok places a piece</i>
<i>flat on the board for defense,</i>

1416
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:53,499
<i>Jong-yun can layer a piece over it</i>
<i>and complete his five-cell block.</i>

1417
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:59,297
<i>This is identical to the winning move</i>
<i>Min-seo used in Round 1.</i>

1418
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:02,341
JONG-YUN USED
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE'S TACTIC AGAINST THEM

1419
01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:08,598
TEAM SNU IN STEM'S 4-CELL BLOCK

1420
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:15,980
Wow, we're getting the fifth round.

1421
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:25,907
That was dynamite.

1422
01:11:26,407 --> 01:11:28,242
<i>I thought, "What a relief. I won."</i>

1423
01:11:29,035 --> 01:11:32,288
<i>Things were literally falling into place.</i>

1424
01:11:36,501 --> 01:11:38,795
They can use this to finish up
before we turn our pieces.

1425
01:11:38,878 --> 01:11:40,421
Let's say they tried this.

1426
01:11:40,505 --> 01:11:41,714
PREPARING FOR EVERY POSSIBILITY

1427
01:11:41,798 --> 01:11:43,633
- Right.
- How's this for defense?

1428
01:11:44,091 --> 01:11:45,802
- I see. A wall works.
- Right?

1429
01:11:45,885 --> 01:11:47,136
We can just build a wall.

1430
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:50,515
When it comes to the game plans
as the first player...

1431
01:11:50,598 --> 01:11:53,935
Unless our opponent chose
the best move ten times in a row,

1432
01:11:54,018 --> 01:11:56,854
we had a surefire way to defeat them.

1433
01:11:56,938 --> 01:11:59,440
I knew we wouldn't lose when going first.

1434
01:12:00,358 --> 01:12:02,235
- He needs to build a wall.
- Exactly.

1435
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:04,153
He needs that wall now.

1436
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:09,075
- What's this?
- That's insane.

1437
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:11,118
I can't believe it.

1438
01:12:11,202 --> 01:12:12,829
This was the sole viable move.

1439
01:12:12,912 --> 01:12:14,914
He survived that. He's not going down.

1440
01:12:14,997 --> 01:12:18,167
- So that's one way to defend it.
- Looks that way.

1441
01:12:18,251 --> 01:12:20,169
There we go.

1442
01:12:20,253 --> 01:12:22,046
Things are going as we practiced.

1443
01:12:22,129 --> 01:12:23,756
So far, so good.

1444
01:12:24,465 --> 01:12:27,426
Team SNU in STEM's Han Jong-yun
will now take his turn.

1445
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:37,395
You have 30 seconds left.

1446
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:47,321
He's basically declaring
that he will turn this next.

1447
01:12:47,405 --> 01:12:48,447
He has to turn this.

1448
01:12:48,531 --> 01:12:50,199
JONG-YUN'S SOLE MEANS OF DEFENSE

1449
01:12:50,283 --> 01:12:51,534
He can't just yet.

1450
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:52,994
He can't turn his piece.

1451
01:12:53,077 --> 01:12:54,495
- He can't.
- Right.

1452
01:12:54,745 --> 01:12:57,331
He hasn't placed all five pieces yet.

1453
01:12:57,582 --> 01:13:00,167
1 PIECE STILL REMAINS

1454
01:13:00,251 --> 01:13:02,545
Excellent use
of the first-player advantage.

1455
01:13:02,628 --> 01:13:04,088
Min-seok did a great job.

1456
01:13:04,171 --> 01:13:06,632
The first player moves a piece first, too.

1457
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:09,510
Okay, so we have
our four-cell block, right?

1458
01:13:09,844 --> 01:13:12,221
YOU CAN GET A 4-CELL BLOCK
BY ROTATING THE HIGHLIGHTED PIECE

1459
01:13:12,305 --> 01:13:14,932
- If they don't block here...
- What's our next play?

1460
01:13:15,016 --> 01:13:17,059
- Why not place a piece here?
- Good idea.

1461
01:13:17,143 --> 01:13:18,769
- It's over.
- We win.

1462
01:13:18,853 --> 01:13:20,187
Since we start turning first.

1463
01:13:20,271 --> 01:13:22,690
Take advantage
of that first-player premium.

1464
01:13:23,024 --> 01:13:25,318
Guys, we won.
Min-seok can turn a piece first.

1465
01:13:25,568 --> 01:13:29,739
ONCE JONG-YUN PLACES HIS PIECE,
MIN-SEOK CAN COMPLETE A 5-CELL BLOCK

1466
01:13:33,701 --> 01:13:34,744
<i>I realized I won.</i>

1467
01:13:34,827 --> 01:13:36,203
<i>I felt relieved</i>

1468
01:13:36,287 --> 01:13:40,124
<i>and glad that I managed the game well</i>
<i>according to our strategy.</i>

1469
01:13:40,207 --> 01:13:41,667
You have ten seconds left.

1470
01:13:41,751 --> 01:13:43,836
HAN JONG-YUN PLACES HIS FINAL PIECE

1471
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:46,464
Team SNU in Medicine's Kim Min-seok
will now take his turn.

1472
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:57,308
Team SNU in Medicine's Kim Min-seok
completed a five-cell block.

1473
01:13:57,391 --> 01:14:01,520
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE'S 5-CELL BLOCK

1474
01:14:04,941 --> 01:14:07,193
I messed up big time.

1475
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:15,368
- That was amazing.
- We might not have survived this.

1476
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:17,495
The med guys mastered strategies
for going first.

1477
01:14:17,578 --> 01:14:19,038
They had it in the bag.

1478
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:23,668
Team SNU in Medicine's Kim Min-seok
won Round 4 of Block Connect Five.

1479
01:14:28,381 --> 01:14:29,298
Good job.

1480
01:14:29,799 --> 01:14:30,633
Well done.

1481
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:32,176
You don't seem happy at all.

1482
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:35,012
<i>As a fellow SNU student,</i>
<i>I felt bad for the STEM team.</i>

1483
01:14:37,223 --> 01:14:38,557
I guess that was a killer.

1484
01:14:38,641 --> 01:14:41,102
The initial move they stuck with.

1485
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:44,647
We didn't see it coming, either.

1486
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:47,066
We thought you were going to win.

1487
01:14:48,734 --> 01:14:53,364
<i>I felt so terrible for my team.</i>

1488
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:57,785
<i>I couldn't help blaming myself.</i>

1489
01:14:58,953 --> 01:15:01,163
I couldn't quite believe...

1490
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:05,292
that our journey came to an end.

1491
01:15:07,878 --> 01:15:12,091
<i>That concludes the Deathmatch,</i>
<i>Block Connect Five.</i>

1492
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:16,387
<i>The third team to be eliminated</i>
<i>from Elite League Season 3 is</i>

1493
01:15:17,096 --> 01:15:19,432
<i>Team SNU in STEM.</i>

1494
01:15:20,641 --> 01:15:24,520
<i>Team SNU in STEM, please exit the grounds.</i>

1495
01:15:26,647 --> 01:15:29,400
Defeat them all in our place.

1496
01:15:29,483 --> 01:15:30,401
Good job, guys.

1497
01:15:34,405 --> 01:15:36,323
I planned on surviving
with Gang-hyeon as our MVP.

1498
01:15:36,407 --> 01:15:38,492
You did your part, but we didn't.

1499
01:15:38,576 --> 01:15:41,078
I felt so sure we won Round 4.

1500
01:15:47,668 --> 01:15:48,961
My heart started racing.

1501
01:15:49,462 --> 01:15:51,589
<i>Since the show's name is "Elite League,"</i>

1502
01:15:51,672 --> 01:15:53,632
<i>I braced myself</i>
<i>like an athlete in a competition.</i>

1503
01:15:53,716 --> 01:15:55,051
I'll log my tile set.

1504
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:57,219
<i>That was how I felt going in.</i>

1505
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:03,893
<i>The whole experience was closer</i>

1506
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:06,145
<i>to a celebration</i>
<i>rather than a competition.</i>

1507
01:16:06,687 --> 01:16:08,105
I was so happy here.

1508
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:11,192
<i>Honestly speaking,</i>
<i>I expected a better outcome.</i>

1509
01:16:11,275 --> 01:16:13,986
<i>I'm sad because it seems like</i>
<i>my mistake cost my team's survival.</i>

1510
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:18,240
<i>While we didn't get to be the champions,</i>
<i>we made invaluable friends on the show.</i>

1511
01:16:18,324 --> 01:16:19,366
That was amazing.

1512
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:21,243
- He delivered!
- Oh, man.

1513
01:16:21,327 --> 01:16:22,787
I'm getting a dopamine rush.

1514
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:27,666
I'd like to say I have no regrets
because I gave it my all.

1515
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:32,463
<i>I'll miss everything from the show.</i>

1516
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:35,466
<i>It's a shame we didn't get to go higher.</i>

1517
01:16:39,053 --> 01:16:43,516
<i>Still, my teammates and I made</i>
<i>great memories during the last four days.</i>

1518
01:16:44,266 --> 01:16:45,601
I'm glad for that.

1519
01:16:45,684 --> 01:16:51,023
<i>I'd like to thank the other teams</i>
<i>for the amazing and fun experience.</i>

1520
01:16:51,107 --> 01:16:52,566
I loved it.

1521
01:16:53,067 --> 01:16:54,068
Are you nervous?

1522
01:16:54,401 --> 01:16:55,653
I'm controlling it.

1523
01:16:55,903 --> 01:16:58,572
<i>I've never been</i>
<i>in a competition like this.</i>

1524
01:16:59,532 --> 01:17:05,371
STEM Division's Ace player is
Team SNU's Song Myeong-su.

1525
01:17:05,788 --> 01:17:09,917
<i>I had fun playing so many different games</i>
<i>with my teammates.</i>

1526
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:14,713
<i>I hope we can still be great friends</i>
<i>back on campus.</i>

1527
01:17:15,339 --> 01:17:16,507
That was hilarious.

1528
01:17:16,841 --> 01:17:18,467
Lastly,

1529
01:17:18,551 --> 01:17:21,470
we have Team KAIST
representing all STEM students.

1530
01:17:21,554 --> 01:17:23,639
I'll keep rooting for them until the end.

1531
01:17:23,722 --> 01:17:26,350
NO GOOD WISHES FOR TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE,
YOUR FELLOW SNU STUDENTS?

1532
01:17:26,684 --> 01:17:28,352
Good luck, Team SNU in Medicine!

1533
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:36,193
<i>We wanted to say goodbye</i>
<i>to Team KAIST at the very least.</i>

1534
01:17:37,069 --> 01:17:39,155
<i>Did you hear us cheering for you?</i>

1535
01:17:39,238 --> 01:17:40,781
<i>- We felt it.</i>
<i>- Good.</i>

1536
01:17:49,915 --> 01:17:54,128
<i>The surviving three teams,</i>
<i>please head to your base camps.</i>

1537
01:17:54,211 --> 01:17:55,921
What's this about, anyway?

1538
01:17:56,005 --> 01:17:57,673
What now?

1539
01:17:59,925 --> 01:18:01,427
- What have we got here?
- What on earth?

1540
01:18:01,594 --> 01:18:03,095
SPECIAL MEAL TO BOOST
THE SEMIFINALISTS' STAMINA

1541
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:05,097
They prepared extra healthy food for us.

1542
01:18:05,306 --> 01:18:06,765
Guys, look at this.

1543
01:18:06,974 --> 01:18:09,685
- These are meal kits.
- "Braised abalone and oxtail"?

1544
01:18:09,894 --> 01:18:12,313
"I would've gotten into SNU
if I'd eaten this before my CSAT."

1545
01:18:12,396 --> 01:18:14,315
That's possible. This is super healthy.

1546
01:18:17,318 --> 01:18:18,569
Let's dig in.

1547
01:18:18,903 --> 01:18:21,071
- Thank you for the meal.
- Thank you for the meal.

1548
01:18:21,155 --> 01:18:23,073
- Braised oxtail.
- I love this.

1549
01:18:23,157 --> 01:18:25,242
I've never tried this before.

1550
01:18:25,326 --> 01:18:26,452
It's your first-ever oxtail.

1551
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:28,913
FIRST BITE OF BRAISED OXTAIL

1552
01:18:34,501 --> 01:18:36,128
It's great.

1553
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:38,297
I can't wait to try the meat.

1554
01:18:38,631 --> 01:18:39,632
Seriously...

1555
01:18:41,091 --> 01:18:43,010
- It's unbelievable.
- They look tasty.

1556
01:18:43,093 --> 01:18:44,929
I can't believe these are meal kits.

1557
01:18:45,512 --> 01:18:47,056
Let me try the abalone.

1558
01:18:47,139 --> 01:18:48,349
Go ahead.

1559
01:18:48,432 --> 01:18:49,808
It's huge.

1560
01:18:50,059 --> 01:18:52,728
- It's gigantic.
- It's gigantic.

1561
01:18:52,811 --> 01:18:53,646
Jinx.

1562
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:01,195
It's crazy. The abalone tastes wonderful.

1563
01:19:01,445 --> 01:19:02,988
I'll try the perilla oil noodles.

1564
01:19:03,822 --> 01:19:06,617
- The perilla oil is so aromatic.
- It's insanely good.

1565
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:09,286
We need good fats
for our brains to function faster.

1566
01:19:09,370 --> 01:19:10,537
Foodie YouTubers always do this.

1567
01:19:15,125 --> 01:19:16,126
- He's enjoying it.
- Indeed.

1568
01:19:16,752 --> 01:19:17,962
It's actually good, though.

1569
01:19:18,045 --> 01:19:20,005
It's so good.

1570
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:22,633
I should ask my mom to get me these.

1571
01:19:22,967 --> 01:19:25,094
Buy it yourself with the prize money.

1572
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:28,430
There's no need to go to your mother.

1573
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:30,599
I'll do as you say.

1574
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:34,353
<i>The main match for the semifinal is</i>

1575
01:19:34,436 --> 01:19:36,230
<i>Secret Student Club.</i>

1576
01:19:36,313 --> 01:19:37,439
- What?
- A reasoning game?

1577
01:19:37,523 --> 01:19:39,191
Similar to Find My Personality Type
from Season 1?

1578
01:19:39,275 --> 01:19:40,276
Probably.

1579
01:19:40,359 --> 01:19:42,695
<i>Please go to the Club Rooms.</i>

1580
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:45,155
The whole setup makes me feel
like I'm on campus.

1581
01:19:45,239 --> 01:19:46,365
Will we get a talent show?

1582
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:48,242
- I'll dance if it's an option.
- Really?

1583
01:19:49,702 --> 01:19:50,828
Gosh, thank you.

1584
01:19:50,911 --> 01:19:53,163
I'm in a band,
a drama club, and a dance club.

1585
01:19:53,247 --> 01:19:54,206
- Seriously?
- Yes.

1586
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:55,833
You're the full package.

1587
01:20:03,424 --> 01:20:05,050
<i>Let's wipe out that club's members.</i>

1588
01:20:05,134 --> 01:20:08,971
Please state the club and the rank
of the person whose identity you deduced.

1589
01:20:09,054 --> 01:20:10,055
They are a member of the band.

1590
01:20:10,139 --> 01:20:11,140
What?

1591
01:20:11,515 --> 01:20:12,683
What are they doing?

1592
01:20:12,766 --> 01:20:15,227
<i>We might end up</i>
<i>with Team KAIST on the throne.</i>

1593
01:20:15,311 --> 01:20:18,939
Marking Team SKKU alone
might not be the best course of action.

1594
01:20:19,023 --> 01:20:21,734
Let's wait for the bodies to pile up
before we pounce.

1595
