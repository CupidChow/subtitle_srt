1
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:30,322
<i>Now, let us begin the Ace Match.</i>

2
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:37,829
Go get him. Good luck on the Ace Match.

3
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:41,124
Yes, that's what I'm talking about!

4
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,126
You've got this, A-in!

5
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:45,295
Thanks.

6
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:51,969
<i>Today's Ace Match is</i>

7
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,304
<i>Three-way Divide.</i>

8
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:55,681
I wonder what this is.

9
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:58,433
- Three-way split is Tae-hun's thing.
- Of course.

10
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:00,310
A 3-WAY SPLIT ROUTINE
Push-pull-legs.

11
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,732
<i>In Three-way Divide,</i>
<i>you will be given Hangul consonants</i>

12
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:08,694
<i>to make 3 words representing 3 numbers.</i>

13
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:12,990
<i>The sum of the three numbers</i>
<i>must match the target number.</i>

14
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,200
And they can make three numbers only?

15
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:17,661
Just three?
That's why it's called Three-way Divide.

16
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,872
- That sounds amazing!
- The game involves Hangul.

17
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:22,541
This should be fun.

18
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:26,211
<i>When the game begins,</i>
<i>a target number will be revealed.</i>

19
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:30,090
<i>The two contestants must use</i>
<i>the given deck of Hangul consonant cards</i>

20
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:34,928
<i>to make three numbers</i>
<i>whose sum matches the target number.</i>

21
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:40,183
<i>Their answer must involve all the cards,</i>
<i>with none remaining.</i>

22
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:43,979
- "With none remaining"?
- No leftovers? That's rough.

23
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:48,984
<i>The numbers the cards can represent</i>
<i>are based on the Sino-Korean numbers.</i>

24
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:52,279
<i>Let us consider the card with ieung.</i>

25
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:57,034
<i>You can only use it</i>
<i>to represent 1, 2, 5, or 6.</i>

26
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:03,123
<i>It alone cannot be used</i>
<i>to represent 0, 10, 100, or 1000.</i>

27
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:06,960
<i>The numbers that giyeok, bieup, siot,</i>
<i>chieut, and pieup can represent</i>

28
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:08,629
<i>are as follows.</i>

29
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:10,672
<i>GIYEOK</i>: 9, <i>BIEUP</i>: 100S, <i>SIOT</i>: 3, 4, 10S,
<i>CHIEUT</i>: 7, 1000S, <i>PIEUP</i>: 8

30
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:15,719
<i>Pieup</i>, <i>giyeok</i>, and <i>bieup </i>are fixed
as 8, 9, and multiples of 100 each.

31
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:19,056
- So we can't represent zero?
- No.

32
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,892
<i>The contestant</i>
<i>with the target number's combination</i>

33
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:26,104
<i>must name their 3 numbers</i>
<i>in under 30 seconds.</i>

34
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:29,399
<i>If your answer is correct,</i>
<i>you will win one point.</i>

35
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:34,488
<i>If not, your opponent will be given</i>
<i>20 seconds to answer.</i>

36
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:38,992
- That 20-second window is a big threat.
- Tell me about it.

37
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:41,745
- It looks fun to me.
- To me, too.

38
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,206
- It's so original.
- I agree.

39
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:47,250
<i>Three-way Divide is a best-of-five game.</i>

40
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,169
<i>The winner of the Ace Match</i>

41
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:51,963
<i>will be awarded a benefit</i>
<i>to be used in the upcoming main match.</i>

42
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,799
Let's win this, STEM Division.

43
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,468
- Medical Division has beaten us so far.
- Yeah.

44
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,387
- I bet A-in will do great.
- Sure.

45
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,972
<i>You will be given ten minutes</i>
<i>to strategize.</i>

46
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:04,184
<i>You can select one contestant</i>
<i>in your division</i>

47
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,478
<i>to discuss strategies with.</i>

48
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,314
<i>Please name one contestant</i>
<i>from your division</i>

49
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:11,358
<i>to discuss your strategy with.</i>

50
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:15,320
I'll go with Team Yonsei's Park Sang-yeon.

51
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:20,242
<i>I found his strategies on Day 1</i>
<i>very creative and helpful.</i>

52
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:24,287
My choice is
Team SNU in STEM's Kim Dong-geon.

53
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:28,083
<i>I went with Dong-geon for his experience</i>
<i>in mathematics as a math major</i>

54
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,544
<i>and his strategic mind.</i>

55
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:34,631
<i>Team Yonsei's Park Sang-yeon</i>

56
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:39,803
<i>and Team SNU in STEM's Kim Dong-geon,</i>
<i>please come to the Main Hall.</i>

57
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,097
- Look.
- Okay.

58
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,641
I found the optimal strategy for this.

59
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:47,394
- Look...
- I knew I could count on you.

60
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,980
<i>You'll be given ten minutes.</i>

61
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,276
<i>First things first.</i>

62
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,611
Break down the target number.

63
00:03:56,695 --> 00:04:00,449
Approach the target number by each digit
and combine your findings for the answer.

64
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:03,076
We thought that it was more efficient

65
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:07,205
to start from the thousands place
and tackle the others in descending order.

66
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:10,542
Consider 2500 and 3700, for example.

67
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,961
<i>Sum them up, and you get 6200.</i>

68
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:16,006
<i>But you can get the same result</i>
<i>by adding 2700 and 3500.</i>

69
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,301
<i>So you can build the answers</i>
<i>after the digit-by-digit analysis is done.</i>

70
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:23,305
Basically, I should break things down
by the digit from the start?

71
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:26,850
Yes, that's the best strategy.

72
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,602
The number of the cards matters.

73
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,562
Check if it's odd or even-numbered.

74
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:35,650
<i>Numbers 1,000, 100, and 10</i>
<i>only require a single card each.</i>

75
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:39,571
<i>But numbers like 2,000 or 3,000</i>
<i>require two cards.</i>

76
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,573
<i>In other words, even-numbered cards.</i>

77
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:46,119
In this sample question, we have 11 cards.

78
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:48,413
So one of the numbers
has odd-numbered cards.

79
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:50,123
ONE NUMBER HAS ODD-NUMBERED CARDS

80
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:53,251
<i>Here's your strategy.</i>

81
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:54,878
Count the number of <i>chieut</i>

82
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,506
and decide whether you'll use them
for multiples of 1,000 or 7.

83
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:59,966
- Initially, yes. That's my priority.
- Exactly.

84
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:05,055
<i>As the consonant chieut can be used</i>
<i>for either 7 or multiples of 1,000,</i>

85
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:10,101
<i>it has the widest gap between</i>
<i>representable numbers among all the cards.</i>

86
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:12,979
<i>Since that is the case,</i>

87
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:16,650
<i>it is crucial that you correctly decide</i>
<i>how to use the card.</i>

88
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,985
It'd be better to divide
the target number into two,

89
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:20,362
considering the <i>bieup </i>cards.

90
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,906
Oh, you're absolutely right.

91
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:26,493
The <i>bieup </i>cards could only be used
for the multiples of 100.

92
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:31,665
So our approach was to break down
the target number into two chunks.

93
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,166
It could be easier

94
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,336
to build numbers for the first 2 digits
and then the last 2 digits.

95
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,172
- Will they be allowed to take notes?
- I think so.

96
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:41,716
I doubt it. They'll probably
have to solve it mentally.

97
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,469
- Would they have to solve it mentally?
- Of course.

98
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,471
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

99
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,182
Try cracking this.

100
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:50,725
How would you build 2529?

101
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:55,105
TARGET NUMBER
2529

102
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,898
First off, 1,900.

103
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:57,983
Then, 500?

104
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,068
- With 1900 and 500--
- If you use 1,900 and 500,

105
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,237
- you need 129.
- Right.

106
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,323
We can get 129
with 3 <i>ieung </i>and 3 <i>siot</i>, right?

107
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,450
With 64 and 65?

108
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:09,077
That's right.

109
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,163
Your numbers can be 1964, 565, and 5.

110
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:14,207
Good work.

111
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,668
Okay, I've got this.

112
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:18,837
Hey, you can beat him no problem.

113
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,340
You flattened the STEM guy
in the Ace Selection, remember?

114
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:23,466
He took double the time.

115
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,885
- Really?
- You bet.

116
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,177
He did take a while.

117
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:29,139
That's right.
Your odds of winning are really good.

118
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,474
You'll do fine if you don't get nervous.

119
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,560
I'm not nervous at all.

120
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,479
I'll do my best to end it in three rounds.

121
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,273
I badly want Myeong-su to win.

122
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,275
Please let him win.

123
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:41,985
Oh, Myeong-su.

124
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,154
<i>The time for strategy meeting is up.</i>

125
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:45,280
Good luck!

126
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,576
You feel good, right? Go crush him, A-in.

127
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,119
You bet I will.

128
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,245
ACE SELECTION
3-WAY DIVIDE

129
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:02,255
<i>I told myself I had to win the game</i>
<i>and secure the benefit for my division.</i>

130
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:06,259
<i>I did far better than Myeong-su</i>
<i>in the Ace Selection.</i>

131
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:09,804
<i>Since I got off to a good start,</i>
<i>I wanted to flatten him.</i>

132
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:12,974
We will now begin the Ace Match,
Three-way Divide.

133
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:16,227
- This is going to be so much fun.
- Let's go.

134
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:18,104
Here we go, Three-way Divide.

135
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:20,231
I can't wait to see their strategies.

136
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:23,860
Here are your consonant cards for Round 1.

138
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,247
Let's give it a try.

139
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:39,167
I'll now reveal
the target number for Round 1.

140
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,127
TARGET NUMBER
3943

141
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,554
<i>IEUNG</i> AND <i>CHIEUT </i>FOR 2000
<i>GIYEOK </i>AND <i>BIEUP </i>FOR 900

142
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:58,937
Team SNU's Song Myeong-su.

143
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,314
He hit the buzzer already.

144
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:02,482
He's really fast.

145
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,567
- That only took him 10 to 15 seconds.
- That fast?

146
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,361
What are your numbers?

147
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:10,532
They are 3000, 915, and 28.

148
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,492
- Did the target number end with 43?
- Yes.

149
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,869
He got it right, then.
Wow, how is he so fast?

150
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,622
Team SNU in STEM's Song Myeong-su.
That is correct.

151
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:19,582
You won one point.

152
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,334
SONG MYEONG-SU: 1, CHOI A-IN: 0

153
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:31,094
I'm impressed by Myeong-su.
He's much better in the actual game.

154
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,596
Dang, this is the true worth of Myeong-su.

2 <i>CHIEUT</i>, 1 <i>BIEUP</i>, 1 <i>GIYEOK</i>

162
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:57,829
They got a lot to work with.

163
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:00,123
Hey, look at all those <i>ieung</i>.

164
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,876
I'll now reveal
the target number for Round 2.

165
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,712
TARGET NUMBER
5151

166
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:15,430
SONG MYEONG-SU USED ALL <i>CHIEUT</i>
TO BUILD MULTIPLES OF 1,000

167
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:20,060
CHOI A-IN USED ONLY 1 <i>CHIEUT</i>
TO MAKE 1 MULTIPLE OF 1,000

168
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,565
We're counting on you, Myeong-su.

169
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,240
Team SNU in STEM's Song Myeong-su.
What are your numbers?

170
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:44,209
They are 3022...

171
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,086
<i>SIOT</i>,<i> CHIEUT</i>,<i> IEUNG</i>,<i> IEUNG</i>,<i> IEUNG</i> FOR 3022

172
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:48,254
...2109, and 30.

173
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,757
Guys, what are we to make
of the trio of <i>ieung</i>?

174
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,467
Triple <i>ieung </i>won't do, right?

175
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:53,885
That is incorrect.

176
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,811
Team Yonsei's Choi A-in
will now be given 20 seconds.

177
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:05,772
It could work if he swaps
the <i>ieung </i>and the <i>siot</i>.

178
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,316
Yes, he only needs to swap those two.

179
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,069
IF MYEONG-SU SWITCHES
THE HIGHLIGHTED TWO CARDS

180
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,445
3022, 2109, 20

181
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:16,533
THE SUM OF THE NEW 3 NUMBERS
MATCHES THE TARGET NUMBER

182
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,956
You have ten seconds left.

183
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:29,254
You have five seconds left.

184
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,588
Just five seconds.

185
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:32,132
Oh, please...

186
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:35,135
Come on, A-in. You've got this.

187
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,596
Your time is up.

188
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:45,436
SWITCHES THE <i>SIOT </i>CARD AND THE <i>IEUNG </i>CARD

189
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:47,981
Team SNU in STEM's Song Myeong-su.

190
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,610
There we have it.

191
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:57,574
My numbers are 3022, 2109, and 20.

192
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:02,287
Team SNU in STEM's Song Myeong-su.
That is correct.

193
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,538
SONG MYEONG-SU: 2, CHOI A-IN: 0

194
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,123
I will now collect your cards.

195
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,625
Wow, he's damn good.

196
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:09,002
Myeong-su!

197
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,795
I'm getting a rush of dopamine.

198
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:13,381
Isn't this our team's
first good performance on the show?

199
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,049
Tell me about it.

200
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,886
All right.

201
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:21,347
Sir Myeong-su!

202
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,057
<i>The tide had turned in my favor.</i>

203
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:26,519
<i>So I wanted to finish the game</i>
<i>with three consecutive wins.</i>

204
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:29,105
Please get us a 3-0 victory. Come on!

205
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,940
You can do this, A-in!

206
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,359
<i>Don't get discouraged, A-in!</i>

207
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,946
<i>I thought, "Others might suffer</i>
<i>a breakdown at this point,</i>

208
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,990
<i>but I never fall apart."</i>

209
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:42,160
Here are your consonant cards for Round 3.

210
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,919
3 <i>BIEUP</i>, 4 <i>SIOT</i>,
4 <i>IEUNG</i>, 1 <i>CHIEUT</i>, 1 <i>PIEUP</i>

211
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:53,880
What's with all these <i>siot </i>and <i>ieung</i>?

212
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,423
They must make 3 multiples of 100.

213
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,884
That means all numbers
must be 100 or bigger.

214
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:00,720
I'll now reveal
the target number for Round 3.

215
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,472
TARGET NUMBER
1272

216
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:13,650
USING THE <i>CHIEUT </i>FOR 7
INSTEAD OF A MULTIPLE OF 1000

217
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:18,196
AFTER BUILDING 700
USING THE <i>CHIEUT </i>AND A <i>BIEUP</i>

218
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,823
HE SWAPS THE <i>CHIEUT </i>WITH THE <i>PIEUP</i>
TO GET 800 INSTEAD

219
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:23,785
- He needs either 800 or 700.
- That's right.

220
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,453
I'd try 800, 200, and 200.

221
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:26,788
TWO DIFFERENT APPROACHES

222
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,331
Or 700, 300, and 200.

223
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:38,424
MYEONG-SU'S 3 NUMBERS
SUM UP TO THE TARGET NUMBER

224
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:41,803
BUT HE HAS ONE <i>SIOT </i>CARD REMAINING

225
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:50,603
<i>I knew my initial approach had an error,</i>
<i>but I just couldn't think straight.</i>

226
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:53,356
<i>I kept racking my brain,</i>
<i>but I had no luck.</i>

227
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:01,114
If A-in loses again,
Myeong-su wins the match.

228
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,701
CHOI A-IN MUST WIN THIS ROUND

229
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,455
A-in, hit the buzzer first
and review the numbers later.

230
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:10,957
Hit it.

231
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,500
- Come on.
- Hit it already.

232
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:15,586
You've got to try your luck.
It's time you gambled.

233
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:21,676
Hey, she did it.

234
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:27,265
Team Yonsei's Choi A-in.
What are your three numbers?

235
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:35,398
They are 252, 740, and 280.

236
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,154
Team Yonsei's Choi A-in. That is correct.

237
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,405
SONG MYEONG-SU: 2, CHOI A-IN: 1

238
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,906
I will now collect your cards.

239
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:48,870
All right, A-in!

240
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,955
Way to go, A-in!

241
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:56,919
Our cheers are louder
than the STEM guys' cheers.

242
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,297
Wait, Team POSTECH went home.

243
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:07,221
<i>I thought, "That's more like it.</i>
<i>I have it in me to demonstrate my skills."</i>

244
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:11,851
Here are your consonant cards for Round 4.

245
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:20,443
2 <i>BIEUP</i>, 5 <i>SIOT</i>,
3 <i>IEUNG</i>, 2 <i>CHIEUT</i>, 2 <i>PIEUP</i>

246
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:22,987
That's crazy. They got five <i>siot</i>?

247
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:24,530
Why are there so many cards?

248
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:27,116
What's with all these cards?

249
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:30,078
I'll now reveal
the target number for Round 4.

250
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:32,538
TARGET NUMBER
1987

251
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:36,667
BOTH SET THE <i>CHIEUT </i>ASIDE
TO USE IT TO REPRESENT 1000

252
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,256
CHOI A-IN'S CURRENT ARRANGEMENTS
SUM UP TO 1800

253
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,216
That's a good idea.

254
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,051
Setting aside roughly 100 to 200

255
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:49,013
- for the sum of double-digit numbers.
- Totally.

256
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:51,099
She's on a roll.

257
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,479
Why did he put two <i>ieung</i> at the start?

258
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,189
Maybe that's for the better.

259
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:01,442
Will he use 200 and 500 and compensate
for the rest with the 2-digit numbers?

260
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,701
Hey, she's got it.

261
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:11,953
She cracked it.

262
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,457
1987, THE TARGET NUMBER

263
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,167
A-in is almost done.

264
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,628
This isn't the time to double-check.

265
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:24,507
- He has to swap the <i>siot </i>and the <i>ieung</i>.
- That should do it.

266
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:27,718
Come on, Myeong-su. Hurry!

267
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:31,264
BOTH PLAYERS ARE ON THE VERGE
OF GETTING A CORRECT ANSWER SET

268
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,230
Hit the buzzer.

269
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,815
- She has to.
- Go for it, A-in.

270
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:41,858
Go on, A-in.

271
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,320
SONG MYEONG-SU HIT THE BUZZER FIRST

272
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:49,615
Team SNU in STEM's Song Myeong-su.
What are your three numbers?

273
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,492
Myeong-su hit the buzzer first.

274
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,912
My numbers are 1048...

275
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:56,956
<i>CHIEUT</i>,<i> SIOT</i>,<i> SIOT</i>,<i> PIEUP</i> FOR 1048

276
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,208
...587...

277
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,585
<i>IEUNG</i>,<i> BIEUP</i>,<i> PIEUP</i>,<i> SIOT</i>,<i> CHIEUT</i> FOR 587

278
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,003
...and 352.

279
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,046
<i>SIOT</i>,<i> BIEUP</i>,<i> IEUNG</i>,<i> SIOT</i>,<i> IEUNG</i> FOR 352

280
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:07,175
Team SNU in STEM's Song Myeong-su.
That is correct.

281
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:13,055
SONG MYEONG-SU: 3, CHOI A-IN: 1

282
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:20,229
That was amazing.

283
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,482
- He delivered!
- Oh, man.

284
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,817
- Let's show them in the main match.
- Okay.

285
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,195
She did great,
cracking the difficult Round 3.

286
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:29,030
- I'm so glad Myeong-su won.
- I love it.

287
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,990
- We may avoid today's Deathmatch.
- Right.

288
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,200
The tide is on our side.

289
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,827
What a shame.
If this works in their favor,

290
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:36,120
today will be rough.

291
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:37,872
We can defeat them in the main match.

292
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,374
Let them take the benefit.
We'll crush them.

293
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,794
<i>It felt great to demonstrate my skills.</i>

294
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:47,548
<i>I also loved that I got to show the others</i>
<i>the strength of Team SNU in STEM.</i>

295
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,511
<i>I want another face-off with Myeong-su.</i>

296
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:54,931
<i>I'll defeat him then</i>
<i>and prove that I have the upper hand.</i>

297
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:59,602
<i>That concludes the Ace Match,</i>
<i>Three-way Divide.</i>

298
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:03,481
<i>Both contestants,</i>
<i>please return to your base camps.</i>

299
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,947
- Well done.
- Great job.

300
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,114
It was so close.

301
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,241
Shoot.

302
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:15,243
That really ruined my mood.

303
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:17,203
Hey, you aced the difficult Round 3.

304
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,497
- It was so hard.
- It just wasn't your day.

305
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,333
We can take them in the main match.

306
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:26,295
We're sending them to the Deathmatch.

307
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,049
You showed them, buddy!

308
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,176
- You were amazing.
- We knew you were going to win.

309
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,177
I'm so relieved.

310
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:36,806
We were so sure
that we didn't even fuss one bit.

311
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:40,226
See for yourself
when the episode is released.

312
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,852
DESPERATE
Come on, Myeong-su.

313
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:43,396
I'm sure he got it right.

314
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:45,606
EXCITED
I'm getting a dopamine rush.

315
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,693
DELIGHTED

316
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,696
EXHILARATED

317
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,448
We were so sure
that we didn't even fuss one bit.

318
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:56,701
ACCORDING TO DONG-GEON,
THEY DIDN'T MAKE A FUSS

319
00:17:57,243 --> 00:18:00,496
That benefit will hopefully keep us
out of the Deathmatch today.

320
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,623
- I love it.
- Things are going as I planned.

321
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,542
<i>I'm hungry.</i>

322
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,752
<i>Same here.</i>

323
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:09,505
- What are these?
- We've got snacks?

324
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:10,423
Let's have them.

325
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,801
Quail eggs? We could use some protein.

326
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,013
Can you find a tear notch?

327
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,223
Hey, we don't even need scissors.

328
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,517
- I've been feeling peckish.
- What a treat!

329
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:22,977
I'm starving.

330
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:27,398
Sitting for long periods studying
can cause muscle loss.

331
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:30,860
Don't forget to take enough protein
to remedy that.

332
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,403
Are they different products?

333
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:34,947
This has 3 quail eggs, and that one has 5.

334
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:37,033
Right, it's the perfect grab-and-go snack.

335
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:42,955
Isn't it good?

336
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,166
- It's good.
- I love that we don't have to touch food.

337
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,667
The eggs come out so easily.

338
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:48,669
I often get this
from the convenience store.

339
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:50,379
It's great for a quick snack.

340
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:54,216
I used to have this a lot
when I was on a diet and felt peckish.

341
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:56,469
I had a ton of these back in high school.

342
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,597
- Can I have some more?
- Of course.

343
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,307
- Would you like this one?
- Yes, please.

344
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,516
I want the bigger portion.

345
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,147
<i>All contestants,</i>

346
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:12,652
<i>please gather outside your base camps</i>
<i>for the main match.</i>

347
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:14,695
- Shall we, then?
- Let's go.

348
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,864
Let's get out there first.

349
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:20,618
- Let's go, Team KAIST.
- Good luck.

350
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,537
It feels empty with no one across from us.

351
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,414
You're right.

352
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,334
We used to look at the POSTECH guys
and wish each other good luck.

353
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:31,337
<i>Today's main match is...</i>

354
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,005
I wonder what it will be.

355
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:37,093
<i>...Exit Strategy 3.</i>

356
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,469
MAIN MATCH
EXIT STRATEGY 3

357
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:43,015
THIS TEAM-BASED STRATEGY GAME
HAS BEEN A STAPLE OF ELITE LEAGUE

358
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,519
WE HAVE THE ALL-NEW EXIT STRATEGY 3

359
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,022
- Hang on.
- Is this for real?

360
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:51,649
- Exit Strategy.
- For real.

361
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,067
I didn't see this coming.

362
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,735
This won't be easy.

363
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:56,946
<i>In Exit Strategy,</i>

364
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,032
<i>all contestants will act</i>
<i>as game pieces on the board.</i>

365
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:05,538
<i>The division that has two people</i>
<i>exit the board first wins the game.</i>

366
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:07,915
<i>For Exit Strategy 3,</i>

367
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:10,918
<i>we're introducing a new term</i>
<i>that you can meet to win.</i>

368
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,047
<i>Regardless of the exits,</i>

369
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:19,927
<i>the division that removes three people</i>
<i>on their opposing side wins the game.</i>

370
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:21,262
We're removing people?

371
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,013
We can remove a piece?

372
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:27,226
<i>Each division</i>
<i>will have eight participants.</i>

373
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,771
Some of us have to stay out of it.

374
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:33,232
No exemptions for the STEM teams.

375
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:36,736
<i>Assign 2 members as the leaders</i>
<i>and the 6 others as the game pieces</i>

376
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:39,196
<i>before going into the game.</i>

377
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:44,201
<i>The leaders will be given one minute</i>
<i>to choose which piece will make a move.</i>

378
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:47,621
<i>The chosen piece</i>
<i>will also be given one minute</i>

379
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:50,916
<i>to travel in the direction they see fit.</i>

380
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,795
<i>The pieces can only move</i>
<i>in a straight line</i>

381
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:59,467
<i>and must come to a stop</i>
<i>if they meet a piece or a wall.</i>

382
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:03,763
<i>We are also introducing</i>
<i>a new role to Exit Strategy 3.</i>

383
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:09,602
<i>One of the six game pieces</i>
<i>will be given the role of the hunter.</i>

384
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,188
What does the hunter do?

385
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:17,485
<i>The hunters can only move</i>
<i>one square in one of the four directions.</i>

386
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:22,323
<i>They can capture their opponent's piece</i>
<i>should they run into one.</i>

387
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,995
<i>The captured piece will be removed</i>
<i>from the board immediately.</i>

388
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,167
This sounds interesting.

389
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:38,672
<i>I decided to build our strategy</i>
<i>with the hunter as the central figure.</i>

390
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:42,259
<i>Please note that the hunters</i>
<i>cannot capture each other.</i>

391
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:48,724
<i>Also, they cannot move across the exit</i>
<i>or leave the board.</i>

392
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:53,020
<i>The two leaders</i>
<i>must stay in their Division Room</i>

393
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:56,232
<i>while the remaining six pieces</i>
<i>must stay on the game board.</i>

394
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,777
<i>There will be no communication</i>
<i>between the two separated groups.</i>

395
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,362
NO COMMUNICATION ALLOWED

396
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,739
<i>Once the game begins,</i>

397
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:06,408
<i>only the leaders</i>
<i>can communicate with each other,</i>

398
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,619
<i>while the pieces must stay silent.</i>

399
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:13,123
<i>Aside from the middle row and column,</i>

400
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:17,086
<i>you can place the five numbered pieces</i>
<i>in your camp freely.</i>

401
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,171
<i>On the other hand,</i>

402
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:23,008
<i>the hunter can only be placed</i>
<i>on one of the yellow squares in your camp.</i>

403
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:26,428
<i>You can request</i>
<i>up to two timeouts per round,</i>

404
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:31,141
<i>once by the leaders</i>
<i>and once by the hunter.</i>

405
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:32,852
<i>Out of a total of three rounds,</i>

406
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:35,604
<i>the division that secures two wins first</i>
<i>will be declared the winner.</i>

407
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:39,441
<i>The teams of the losing division</i>
<i>will compete in the Deathmatch.</i>

408
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,444
If they lose,
all three teams get the Deathmatch.

409
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:45,030
- We have three teams.
- All three must be competing.

410
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:46,448
<i>Medical Division</i>

411
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:50,160
<i>must select 8 contestants out of 12</i>
<i>as the participants.</i>

412
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:53,455
<i>The excluded four contestants</i>
<i>cannot join their division during timeouts</i>

413
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:56,750
<i>or substitute the participants.</i>

414
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,836
Not at all?

415
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:01,589
So the four people are basically excluded.

416
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:03,632
Those four will have nothing to do.

417
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:05,801
All they can do is watch the game.

418
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:09,555
<i>The benefit of this match</i>
<i>will now be revealed.</i>

419
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:13,809
<i>The team with the benefit</i>
<i>will decide which division goes first.</i>

420
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,353
- Not bad.
- It's great.

421
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:18,188
<i>I felt a surge of pride</i>

422
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:21,942
<i>thinking that the benefit I secured</i>
<i>would be a great help to my division.</i>

423
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:27,448
<i>As the winner of today's Ace Match,</i>

424
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:31,660
<i>Team SNU in STEM will decide</i>
<i>whether to go first or second.</i>

425
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:35,205
TRICKSTER
Won't going second be more advantageous?

426
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,874
What are we thinking?

427
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:37,791
Shouldn't we...

428
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:40,419
I think we should go first
and place the hunter in the center.

429
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:41,337
I agree.

430
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,923
It's better to go first
in turn-based games.

431
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:44,840
That's true.

432
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:47,885
<i>All we had to do was</i>
<i>get two pieces exit the board first.</i>

433
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,845
<i>So going first seemed advantageous.</i>

434
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:50,763
STEM DIVISION WILL GO FIRST

435
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:53,849
<i>Medical Division,</i>
<i>please go to your Division Room</i>

436
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:56,810
<i>and decide on the eight contestants</i>
<i>to participate in the game.</i>

437
00:23:56,894 --> 00:24:00,147
<i>You'll be given five minutes.</i>

438
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:04,151
We'll need to keep it brief
and reach a conclusion quickly.

439
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:07,446
Shouldn't everyone briefly pitch
their strategy--

440
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:11,450
- We don't have the time for that.
- We can't do that under five minutes.

441
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:12,743
Here's an idea.

442
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:16,914
Each team can nominate one member
that they want to include in the roster.

443
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:19,291
We want to make sure
that Ji-hu is included.

444
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,627
- He has to participate.
- Hands down.

445
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,421
Why don't we each select
1 or 2 members to exclude?

446
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:26,256
Yes, that's the right approach.

447
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:30,427
If you are good with turn-based games,
I'll bow out. I'm not good with them.

448
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:33,263
It should be me
if we have to exclude anyone.

449
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:36,266
- I can sit this one out.
- Okay.

450
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:39,979
THE FINAL NON-PARTICIPANT WILL BE DECIDED
BY A GAME OF ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS

451
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:41,313
Rock, paper, scissors.

452
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:42,982
YONSEI, SKKU: ROCK
SNU IN MEDICINE: SCISSORS

453
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:43,941
Who's also out?

454
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,526
TEAM SNU IN MEDICINE'S HAN SEO-YEON

455
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:49,571
<i>Both divisions,</i>
<i>please start discussing your strategies.</i>

456
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:52,408
Exit Strategy 3 is very different
from Exit Strategy 2.

457
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:56,829
In Exit Strategy 2, the game pieces
could roam the enemy territory freely.

458
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,915
But in Exit Strategy 3,
the enemy hunter restricts our movement.

459
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:01,917
- That's true.
- Since that's the case,

460
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:05,004
we'll have to rely on our hunter
to make way for our pieces.

461
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:08,507
The hunter's most important role
will be to act as a wall.

462
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:12,094
<i>The most important element</i>
<i>of Exit Strategy 3</i>

463
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,138
<i>are the two hunters.</i>

464
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,517
<i>While the numbered pieces must continue on</i>
<i>until they meet an obstacle,</i>

465
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,270
<i>the hunters can travel</i>
<i>toward their target,</i>

466
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:24,606
<i>moving one square at a time.</i>

467
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,568
<i>The hunters' special ability allows them</i>

468
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:31,613
<i>to serve as a wall for the others</i>
<i>in their course to exit the board.</i>

469
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:33,449
To use the hunter as our wall...

470
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,576
Check the column and the row
intersecting at the exit.

471
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:41,665
If we want to give the hunter
a defense-heavy role at the outset,

472
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:44,084
- our hunter should be here.
- Right.

473
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:47,004
<i>If STEM Division surrounds the exit</i>
<i>with pieces to use as their walls,</i>

474
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:49,548
<i>our hunter can eliminate them.</i>

475
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:52,593
<i>In case we need a wall,</i>
<i>the hunter can go here.</i>

476
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:56,263
<i>They can be our stepping stone</i>
<i>as they can stop after moving one square.</i>

477
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:59,349
The hunter should be
on one of the corner cells to the exit.

478
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:02,311
- They should go there if possible.
- They must get there at all costs.

479
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:05,856
Wouldn't STEM Division's hunter
also want the same corner cells?

480
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,649
STEM DIVISION ROOM
Here's what I think.

481
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:10,819
The hunter should take
one of these four corner cells

482
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:14,156
because the hunter can then
easily take out the enemy's walls.

483
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,240
SAME STRATEGY AS MEDICAL DIVISION

484
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:20,204
One concern about placing our hunter there
is that the opponent can sacrifice a piece

485
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,999
<i>- to get another to leave the board.</i>
<i>- Right.</i>

486
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:28,879
I think this is a game
where you can benefit from sacrifices.

487
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:31,423
I think we can secure a win
with this strategy.

488
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:34,676
We'll set up a wall in one of these cells
and have two pieces leave the board.

489
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,677
USE THE HUNTER AS A WALL

490
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:36,887
That seems to be the best.

491
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:39,973
So I suggest
that our hunter move toward the exit.

492
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:41,600
HAVE THE HUNTER MOVE QUICKLY TO THE EXIT

493
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:44,520
I agree that taking control
of the center region matters,

494
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,647
but we'll likely see
constant changes there.

495
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,774
So why don't we place our pieces

496
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,527
so we can quickly claim
the rows closer to the center?

497
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,613
Having them there
will restrict the enemy hunter's movement.

498
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,406
They will have a hard time.

499
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,910
If we have a piece here,
their hunter will be immobilized.

500
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,453
They can't come here, right?

501
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:02,538
Sure.

502
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:05,499
I think that should be our priority.

503
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:08,293
<i>Okay, then. STEM 1 will go here at first.</i>

504
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:09,753
<i>- All right.</i>
<i>- Let's do that.</i>

505
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:10,921
When we call our hunter,

506
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:14,216
their general goal should be
moving toward the center.

507
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,135
<i>- Yes, for our offense.</i>
<i>- Right.</i>

508
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:17,553
HUNTER MOVES TO THE CENTER

509
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,680
- Once we claim here--
- We're likely to win.

510
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:23,350
- Then, we can bring three pieces home.
- It will be very hard to stop us.

511
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:25,602
- That looks awesome.
- Great.

512
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:29,523
Since they're going first,
they'll claim the good spots first.

513
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:32,442
I think we should secure this cell.

514
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:34,736
- Yes, to cut the hunter off.
- The hunter can travel this way

515
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,406
and have their pieces
leave the board in seven turns.

516
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,325
Agreed. Let's secure here to cut them off.

517
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:43,745
Our initial focus should be
on reducing their first-mover advantage.

518
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:45,664
By sending our hunter after them? I see.

519
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:46,957
Since we were going second,

520
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,084
the enemy hunter
would always get one more turn

521
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:52,713
before our hunter could take a turn.

522
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:56,049
Only our hunter
could counter their hunter.

523
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:59,261
So the foundation of our defense strategy

524
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:03,098
was to have our hunter
trail after their hunter.

525
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:07,019
<i>You have three minutes left</i>
<i>to discuss your strategy.</i>

526
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:10,314
I think Ji-hu and Seung-hyeon
should be our leaders.

527
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:13,942
You're careful and analytical, Sang-yeon.
Why don't you be the hunter?

528
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:15,569
- You want me as the hunter?
- Yes.

529
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,487
- In that case...
- We need some caution.

530
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,531
But I'd like to point out one thing.

531
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:22,326
There's a big difference
between observing the game from afar

532
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:25,454
and being on the board
as one of the game pieces.

533
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:29,750
I knew I would make better decisions
as an observer than as an active player.

534
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,085
Because I knew that about myself,

535
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:35,130
I wanted to take
on the role of the leader.

536
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:37,674
- How about you, Ji-hu?
- Me?

537
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:39,593
- Ji-hu as the hunter?
- I bet he'll do great.

538
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,553
Ji-hu will do fine as the hunter,

539
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:44,640
considering his great analytical eye
and solid judgment.

540
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:46,266
So Ji-hu.

541
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:49,519
- Why don't you try it for this round?
- I'll give it a go.

542
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:51,897
LEADERS: TEAM SNU, LEE SEUNG-HYEON,
TEAM YONSEI, PARK SANG-YEON

543
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,981
HUNTER: TEAM SKKU, KANG JI-HU

544
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:57,361
We should decide
on our leaders and our hunter.

545
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:59,112
Gang-hyeon and I can be leaders.

546
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:02,741
Yes, let's leave the responsibility
in our chess players' capable hands.

547
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,953
I've been a die-hard chess player
even as a boy.

548
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:08,872
I probably was the best in the country
among my peers.

549
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:11,166
None of my peers were at my level
in elementary school,

550
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,460
so I competed against teenagers
and even won.

551
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:17,798
I'm in the top 0.6% of the players
on the world's biggest online chess site

552
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:20,008
with more than 100 million users.

553
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:22,427
<i>We had Gang-hyeon on our side.</i>

554
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:25,305
<i>I felt certain we could win</i>
<i>if we teamed up as the leaders.</i>

555
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:28,308
The leaders and the hunter
can request a timeout each.

556
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:29,226
How should we use that?

557
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,812
All the more reason
to select our hunter carefully.

558
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:35,774
They should have as good a grasp
of the game as the leaders.

559
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:38,110
We needed someone
with a solid understanding of the game

560
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,612
and the ability to think on their feet.

561
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:41,780
Dong-geon fit the bill.

562
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,865
You should do it, Dong-geon.

563
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:45,742
I'll be our hunter.

564
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:51,123
If I see that their piece has a way out,
I'll ask for a timeout right away.

565
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,083
Your requests shouldn't overlap.

566
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:55,919
The leaders can submit a request
after the 30-second mark.

567
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:57,504
- Okay.
- There's no rush, right?

568
00:29:57,587 --> 00:30:00,424
The hunter can make a request
before the 30-second mark.

569
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:01,550
TO SET UP A TIME DIFFERENCE

570
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:02,634
That's a great idea.

571
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,220
LEADERS: TEAM SNU, KIM GANG-HYEON,
TEAM KAIST, KANG JI-HOO

572
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:06,555
HUNTER: TEAM SNU, KIM DONG-GEON

573
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,932
<i>The time for strategy meeting is up.</i>

574
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:14,604
<i>Both divisions, please gather</i>
<i>at the main hall for the main match.</i>

575
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:18,066
- Medical Division!
- Let's go!

576
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:21,069
- Let's go, Medical Division!
- All right!

577
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:22,321
STEM Division!

578
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:25,365
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

579
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,712
My nerves are getting to me.

580
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:41,298
Don't let them. This is nothing big.

581
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,760
I hope we win.

582
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,179
Come on, I have faith in our guys.

583
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:52,184
All leaders,
please go to your Division Rooms.

584
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:55,020
That's our cue. Good luck, guys.

585
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,775
- Good luck.
- Let's do this.

586
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:00,901
You've got this.

587
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:01,818
All right!

588
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:08,158
It's so reassuring
to have two chess players with us.

589
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:13,538
All game pieces, please enter the board
when your assigned role is called.

590
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:16,041
Medical 1 and STEM 1,
please enter the board.

591
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:18,168
Keep your eyes peeled for this.

592
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:20,337
It's a mirror image.

593
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:21,880
A perfect symmetry.

594
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,466
MEDICAL 1 AND STEM 1 ARE PLACED
ON THE MATCHING SQUARE

595
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:25,842
Medical 2 and STEM 2.

596
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:27,260
MEDICAL 2, KIM MIN-SEOK
STEM 2, HAN JONG-YUN

597
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:29,596
Oh, that's pretty aggressive.

598
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:32,933
- We must cut him off.
- Yes, that's for sure.

599
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,434
Medical 3 and STEM 3.

600
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:36,561
MEDICAL 3, CHOI A-IN
STEM 3, KIM JAE-HAN

601
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:39,314
MEDICAL 3 AND STEM 3 FORM A SYMMETRY

602
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:42,025
Pretty similar.

603
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,321
Medical 4 and STEM 4.

604
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:47,739
MEDICAL 4, SUNG TAE-HUN
STEM 4, KIM JI-U

605
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:49,116
Medical 5 and STEM 5.

606
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:50,826
MEDICAL 5, KIM DONG-YEON
STEM 5, SONG MYEONG-SU

607
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,494
MEDICAL HUNTER, KANG JI-HU
Hunters, please enter the board.

608
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,037
STEM HUNTER, KIM DONG-GEON

609
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:56,373
ALL IN POSITION FOR ROUND 1

610
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:05,215
We will now begin Round 1
of the main match, Exit Strategy 3.

611
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,347
STEM Division will go first.

612
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:14,850
Please select a piece to make a move.

613
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:19,354
- STEM 1 is our obvious choice, no?
- I guess.

614
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:21,440
Yes, we need that column no matter what.

615
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,693
- Right, I'll press number one, then.
- Okay.

616
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:28,655
STEM 1, please make your move.

617
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:34,453
He went here.

618
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:35,787
- Are we calling our hunter?
- Yes.

619
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:39,207
Medical Hunter, please make your move.

620
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:41,960
MEDICAL HUNTER MOVES TOWARD THE CENTER

621
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:45,464
- Should we send our own hunter?
- Yes, let's do that.

622
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:52,679
- They moved their hunter.
- Our guy should close in.

623
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:58,101
MOVING CLOSER TO THE CENTER

624
00:32:58,185 --> 00:33:00,312
STEM HUNTER ALSO MOVES CLOSER
TO THE CENTER

625
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:02,272
We can now call Medical 3.

626
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:04,399
It works for us strategically
if she goes here

627
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:06,485
- or here, right?
- Sure.

628
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:08,820
If they send someone after her,
we take them.

629
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:12,157
Yes, she'll be our bait.

630
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:15,869
Medical 3, please make your move.

631
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:19,748
<i>She'll debate over two options,</i>
<i>though it works for us either way.</i>

632
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:26,421
MEDICAL 3 CAN EXIT THE BOARD
ON HER NEXT TURN

633
00:33:27,047 --> 00:33:28,632
- She went here.
- Right.

634
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:32,594
- They're just as smart as our guys.
- You bet.

635
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:33,553
So...

636
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:37,307
What's their angle here?

637
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,893
They'll end up losing this way.

638
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:43,980
STEM Hunter, please make your move.

639
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,943
MEDICAL 3 CAN USE HIM AS A WALL NOW
<i>Take one step away.</i>

640
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,696
All right. This is looking great.

641
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:55,408
- Isn't it over?
- I'd say it's almost over.

642
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:57,869
They're thrusting a checkmate
into our hands.

643
00:33:57,953 --> 00:33:59,454
We'll get it in four turns.

644
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:01,081
One, two, three, four.

645
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,125
Oh, I recognize this setup.

646
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:05,961
Me too. We have no way out of this.

647
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,379
- Wait.
- Do we block here?

648
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:11,967
We fell for the same trick
we wanted to use on them.

649
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:14,427
10 MINUTES AGO
If our piece goes here

650
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:16,096
and their hunter follows,
our guy can leave.

651
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,682
If they don't, our hunter can get here
so our piece can leave.

652
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:20,684
Nothing can stop our piece from exiting.

653
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:23,186
We should all bear this in mind.

654
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:26,106
- What do we do next?
- Right?

655
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:28,650
BLINDSIDED BY THE STRATEGY THEY PREDICTED

656
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:33,238
Should we still send our guy for defense
or request a timeout?

657
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,198
- The latter.
- The timeout?

658
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:40,036
<i>Since we discussed this pattern</i>
<i>during the strategy meeting,</i>

659
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,663
<i>we could've counteracted it.</i>

660
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:44,541
<i>It flustered me to realize</i>
<i>that we had missed that.</i>

661
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:49,546
Medical Division requested a timeout.

662
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:50,755
MEDICAL DIVISION'S FIRST TIMEOUT REQUEST

663
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:53,550
You'll be given five minutes.

664
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:56,136
Don't we get the same time
to go over strategies?

665
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,096
Shall we work on plans
for going second in Round 2?

666
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,306
CERTAIN OF THEIR VICTORY

667
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:00,932
- I don't think they have a way out.
- Right.

668
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,185
We have to accept
that STEM 1 will exit the board.

669
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:05,103
Right.

670
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:09,024
What concerns me is
that STEM 5 can follow suit.

671
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:11,860
IF 2 PIECES EXIT IN A ROW,
MEDICAL DIVISION LOSES

672
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:15,947
Let's go over this again.
Basically, these two can exit the board.

673
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:17,616
So...

674
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:19,618
Why don't we try this?

675
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:21,578
I mean, the best option for us

676
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:24,664
is to have the hunter block this area
to keep this guy from leaving.

677
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,000
<i>- One, two.</i>
<i>- Their hunter will go here.</i>

678
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,543
<i>- Our hunter will move in.</i>
<i>- Three...</i>

679
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:30,754
<i>Once STEM 1 goes out, we block.</i>
<i>That's our only option.</i>

680
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:33,173
SUCCESSFULLY FENDING OFF
STEM 5 FROM EXITING

681
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:34,549
That's all we've got.

682
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:36,426
- Or we'll lose.
- Right.

683
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:38,345
Only our hunter can block the way here.

684
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:39,846
- We've got to do this.
- Yes.

685
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:40,889
FOUND THE ONLY DEFENSE TACTIC

686
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:45,310
Their hunter can come around like this
and cut one of our pieces off

687
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,270
DONG-GEON PREDICTS MEDICAL DIVISION'S PLAN
if Ji-hu moves soon.

688
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,566
One, two, three, four, five.
That's the best defense they can use.

689
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,276
SECOND PIECE MAY NOT GET TO EXIT

690
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,528
It's pretty frustrating.

691
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:01,117
Your time is up.

692
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:03,411
- Nice timing for the timeout.
- Good luck.

693
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:05,538
- Let's go. We're in good shape.
- We've got this.

694
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:14,214
Medical Division,
please select a piece to make a move.

695
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:16,091
Their best defense strategy

696
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,051
- was to call the hunter, right?
- Yes.

697
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:19,386
Hunter.

698
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:20,762
SELECTING HUNTER AS DISCUSSED

699
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,434
STEM Division,

700
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:28,770
- please select a piece to make a move.
<i>- Hit hunter.</i>

701
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:34,526
STEM 1 CAN EXIT THE BOARD ON HIS NEXT TURN

702
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:37,028
They're rushing it to leave us no time.

703
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:38,405
I noticed that, too.

704
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:42,534
Medical Hunter, please make your move.

705
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:45,495
STEM 1, please make your move.

706
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:53,169
STEM Division's first piece
exited the board.

707
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:54,337
FIRST EXIT IN 6 TURNS

708
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:57,215
MEDICAL DIVISION: 0, STEM DIVISION: 1

709
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:58,883
Do we need to call
our hunter one more time?

710
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:00,301
Yes, he needs to get here.

711
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:03,221
PREVENTING STEM DIVISION'S PIECE
FROM EXITING

712
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:04,806
<i>They went for the hunter.</i>

713
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,766
We have no incentive to call STEM 5.

714
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,309
No, not really.

715
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:10,437
- Right?
- What do we do next?

716
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,897
Nothing stands out to me.

717
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:14,983
It's all complicated.

718
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:18,361
<i>I don't see a move</i>
<i>that will get us the win.</i>

719
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:21,614
- How about a timeout?
- Shall we?

720
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:24,117
- Medical 3 moving into our camp bugs me.
- Okay.

721
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:27,579
STEM Division requested a timeout.

722
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,999
You'll be given five minutes.

723
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:32,125
Hurry.

724
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,212
STEM DIVISION
TIMEOUT

725
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,465
We timed out
because we're short of a good move

726
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:40,550
and worried about Medical 3
getting into our camp.

727
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:41,468
Exactly.

728
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:44,429
Why don't we move STEM 4 first?

729
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:45,346
The line there...

730
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,348
- STEM 4?
- What if Medical 3 moves in?

731
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:50,268
Then, when she exits, Ji-u can follow.

732
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,645
EXIT THE BOARD FOLLOWING MEDICAL 3'S ROUTE

733
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:55,273
- STEM 4 is the best choice.
- Our next piece is STEM 4, then.

734
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:56,816
We'll call STEM 4 next.

735
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,526
If STEM 4 moves up like this,

736
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:01,446
we can send two pieces
to take control of the central row.

737
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,740
TAKING THE CENTRAL ROW
TO PREPARE FOR THE DOUBLE EXITS

738
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:06,826
<i>While our guys get lined up,</i>
<i>STEM 2 can go to the opposite side</i>

739
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:09,496
<i>and take advantage</i>
<i>of the setup we prepared.</i>

740
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:10,997
DANGER OF STEM DIVISION'S SECOND EXIT

741
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:14,584
<i>So Medical 2 has to wait</i>
<i>and cut STEM 2 off.</i>

742
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:17,086
So cut STEM 2 off...

743
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:20,465
Yes, we need to do that first
before bringing two pieces home.

744
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:23,301
Your time is up.

745
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,804
Let us resume the game.

746
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:34,354
STEM Division,
please select a piece to make a move.

747
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:36,606
So I'll go for STEM 4 right away.

748
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:40,276
STEM 4, please make your move.

749
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:45,448
Our plan was to take the central row.

750
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:48,910
- So our choice should be Medical 3.
- That's right.

751
00:38:54,207 --> 00:38:55,792
<i>STEM 2 will move in, right?</i>

752
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,669
<i>The way we see it, that's their best bet.</i>

753
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:02,340
STEM 5, please make your move.

754
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,843
STEM 5 SELECTED INSTEAD OF STEM 2

755
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:09,597
5 MINUTES AGO
If they call Medical 3,

756
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:10,598
we'll call STEM 2.

757
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:12,225
THEY AGREED TO CALL STEM 2
DURING THE TIMEOUT

758
00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:19,190
<i>I was expecting to hear Jong-yun's number,</i>

759
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:21,526
<i>so I was startled to hear mine.</i>

760
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:24,529
1 MINUTE AGO
We'll counter that with STEM 2.

761
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:25,572
READY TO FOLLOW THE PLAN

762
00:39:25,655 --> 00:39:26,531
That's the best.

763
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:27,532
Two, three.

764
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:32,036
They can use Medical 2 to cut off STEM 2
when he gets to the central row.

765
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:32,954
DEFENSIVE ACTION FOUND

766
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:33,872
Hang on.

767
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,416
Medical 2 and 3 can cut off both our guys?

768
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:38,209
That can put our plan at risk.

769
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:45,300
If Dong-geon doesn't call a timeout,
let's go with STEM 5.

770
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,970
STEM 5, please make a move.

771
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,680
STEM 5'S MOVE WASN'T PREPLANNED

772
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:53,725
Medical 2, please make your move.

773
00:39:57,437 --> 00:39:59,981
<i>The overall momentum</i>
<i>seems to shift at each move.</i>

774
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:02,650
It looks like we have the upper hand now.

775
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:06,195
- We can wait
<i>- STEM Division, please...</i>

776
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:09,032
for Dong-geon to request a timeout
after the 30-second mark.

777
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:12,452
What a mess.

778
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,954
<i>We're out of plans.</i>

779
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:16,039
<i>Tell me about it.</i>

780
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:21,377
<i>I found it strange that the leaders</i>
<i>weren't giving orders based on our plan.</i>

781
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:28,301
I'd like to request a timeout.

782
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:29,260
STEM HUNTER'S TIMEOUT REQUEST

783
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:30,803
He raised his hand.

784
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:34,432
STEM Division requested a timeout.

785
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:36,976
You'll be given five minutes.

786
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:43,483
We didn't see
STEM 2 could get intercepted.

787
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:45,360
Is calling STEM 3 still worth it?

788
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:46,569
NEW STRATEGY REQUIRED

789
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:48,404
How would STEM 3 move toward the exit?

790
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:49,322
He can't.

791
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:50,740
- Originally, like this.
- Right.

792
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:53,701
HAVING TROUBLE COMING UP WITH A NEW PLAN

793
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:57,830
This is the layout.

794
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:01,376
Their only countermove
is to get STEM 2 here.

795
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,252
Once we try this,

796
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:04,253
we're sure to win.

797
00:41:04,337 --> 00:41:06,214
<i>If STEM 2 doesn't get here</i>
<i>on his next turn,</i>

798
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,132
<i>we can send Medical 4 here.</i>

799
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:10,259
<i>Two more moves,</i>
<i>and our guys are ready to exit.</i>

800
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:12,345
BACK-TO-BACK EXITS LEAD TO VICTORY

801
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:14,597
This is a sure way to win.

802
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:17,266
Your time is up.

803
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,902
There's a high chance
they won't find a way.

804
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:31,406
STEM Division,
please select a piece to make a move.

805
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,866
I bet they'll call STEM 2.

806
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:38,997
STEM 3, please make your move.

807
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,790
STEM 3?

808
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:42,625
What for? Why?

809
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:44,752
STEM 3, please make your move.

810
00:41:51,134 --> 00:41:54,178
STEM 3 TAKES MEDICAL DIVISION BY SURPRISE

811
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,973
Hey, he got here.

812
00:41:57,682 --> 00:41:59,100
But why?

813
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:01,644
Even the two of us missed this.

814
00:42:01,728 --> 00:42:05,565
Only one member from our division
saw this was possible.

815
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:06,649
Could they have seen this?

816
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:10,570
This is a roundabout measure
Medical Division can't defend against.

817
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:13,948
We can have STEM 3 go here
and then move to the hunter.

818
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:15,533
Ji-hu has to stay to hold back STEM 5.

819
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:16,868
So if STEM 3 moves up...

820
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:20,204
Before any of that,
won't Medical 2 go here and block our way?

821
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:22,749
We'll set STEM 2 on him
and have the hunter go here.

822
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:24,625
- Then, STEM 2 can exit the board.
- Good idea.

823
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:26,711
We can come at them from both ends.

824
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:30,965
STEM 3 MOVED
ACCORDING TO JEON JI-MIN'S STRATEGY

825
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,550
I think we can prime our pieces.

826
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,552
- Okay, call Medical 2.
- Here we go.

827
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:35,928
FOLLOWING THEIR ORIGINAL PLAN

828
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:39,057
Medical 2, please make your move.

829
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:45,396
They blocked our way.
We can still use STEM 2.

830
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,274
STEM 2, please make your move.

831
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:52,070
What can they do now?

832
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:53,780
Why did STEM 2 move down?
Let's send Medical 4.

833
00:42:53,863 --> 00:42:55,281
- He's the right choice, right?
- Yes.

834
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:58,367
Medical 4, please make your move.

835
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:01,496
<i>Medical 4.</i>

836
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:03,414
He's no threat to our plan.

837
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:06,959
STEM Hunter, please make your move.

838
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,339
<i>- He's on a hunt.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

839
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:12,840
Do we dangle the bait?

840
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:15,009
Medical 4 can move closer.

841
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:18,429
Let's say he got here,
and their hunter decided to capture him.

842
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:21,182
Then, Medical 2 can leave,
followed by Medical 1.

843
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:23,434
- We're all set.
- Let me count the turns.

844
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:24,727
We've got time for this.

845
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:25,895
Their hunter moves.

846
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:28,523
Then, Medical 1. What if STEM 2 comes in?

847
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:30,566
You've got a point there.

848
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:32,443
MEDICAL 1'S ACCESS WILL BE CUT OFF

849
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:34,195
You have 30 seconds left.

850
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:41,035
Ji-hu needs to ask for a timeout.

851
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,621
If he doesn't,
we'll use Medical 4 as our bait.

852
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:45,665
<i>You have ten seconds left.</i>

853
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:47,583
<i>- Ask for a timeout.</i>
<i>- Call for a timeout.</i>

854
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:48,793
<i>Come on.</i>

855
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:50,044
<i>You have five seconds left.</i>

856
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:51,337
- Please.
- Hit the number.

857
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:57,260
Medical 4, please make your move.

858
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:01,472
Hang on.

859
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,393
What if their hunter steps back
after STEM 2's move?

860
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:06,477
Can you repeat that?

861
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:09,230
- With Medical 4 there...
- The hunter can pull back?

862
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,648
Won't these two leave? Wait.

863
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:12,817
MEDICAL 2 AND 3 CAN EXIT BACK-TO-BACK

864
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:16,571
Oh, man. This really is a headache.

865
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:20,116
Wait, I can't believe
we're going neck and neck.

866
00:44:23,286 --> 00:44:26,330
STEM 2, please make your move.

867
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:33,838
STEM 2 CAN EXIT THE BOARD ON HIS NEXT TURN

868
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,716
Let's have our hunter pull back.

869
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:40,845
Medical Hunter, please make your move.

870
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:47,602
Our hunter should capture
Medical 4 and run.

871
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,061
Capture and run?

872
00:44:49,312 --> 00:44:51,772
<i>I hope our hunter will make a clever move.</i>

873
00:44:52,732 --> 00:44:55,776
STEM Hunter, please make your move.

874
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:04,785
STEM Hunter captured
one of Medical Division's numbered pieces.

875
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:05,995
There we go.

876
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:08,581
- Hey, our plan worked.
- It's working.

877
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:10,333
- All right.
- Let's keep it cool.

878
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:12,460
We achieved our goal,
and they took the bait.

879
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,545
Call Medical 2 right away.
Don't give them time.

880
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:17,506
Medical 2, please make your move.

881
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:25,306
MEDICAL 2 CAN NOW EXIT THE BOARD

882
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:28,059
You have 30 seconds left.

883
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:32,313
Why won't he move?

884
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:35,900
- I clicked number two.
- Why won't he move? Leave already.

885
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:38,736
You have ten seconds left.

886
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,279
<i>When Min-seok didn't leave,</i>

887
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:43,199
<i>I thought it must be</i>
<i>because he had a message,</i>

888
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:45,534
<i>not because he couldn't make up his mind.</i>

889
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:47,620
I'd like to request a timeout.

890
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:48,621
HUNTER'S TIMEOUT REQUEST

891
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:51,582
Medical Division requested a timeout.

892
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:53,626
You'll be given five minutes.

893
00:45:57,213 --> 00:45:59,674
This is great for us.
Doesn't this mean we're going to win?

894
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:01,467
EXPECTING A VICTORY

895
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,094
- We're going to win.
- Really?

896
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:06,180
All we have to do now
is call our hunter next.

897
00:46:06,264 --> 00:46:07,265
That's all.

898
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:10,351
- STEM 2 will exit the board.
- Let's say he left.

899
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,603
Then, their hunter will move down.

900
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,941
If their hunter gets here,
we're going to win.

901
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:21,195
If he moves down instead,
Medical 1 will follow.

902
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:24,240
Medical 1 will be our bait,
allowing us to use their hunter as a wall.

903
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:25,908
LURE STEM HUNTER TO USE HIM AS A WALL

904
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:28,953
I'm worried they might try this.

905
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:30,121
Hold on.

906
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:31,914
DONG-GEON PREDICTS MEDICAL DIVISION'S PLAN

907
00:46:32,248 --> 00:46:34,333
It all ends, then. Let me think it over.

908
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:35,334
So...

909
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:36,919
You should go up or left.

910
00:46:37,003 --> 00:46:41,257
Yes, but I'd strongly suggest moving up
because Medical 1 bugs the hell out of me.

911
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,259
Why don't we keep him in check?

912
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:45,469
This is a raw analytic power battle.

913
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:47,471
Let's trust each other's skills.

914
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,141
Your time is up.

915
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:52,685
Let us resume the game.

916
00:46:54,854 --> 00:46:57,606
Medical 2, please make your move.

917
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:04,155
Medical Division's first piece
exited the board.

918
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:06,240
MEDICAL DIVISION: 1, STEM DIVISION: 1

919
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,368
- Let's call our hunter right away.
- Okay.

920
00:47:10,286 --> 00:47:12,997
STEM Hunter, please make your move.

921
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,124
<i>We'll call our hunter.</i>

922
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:17,877
Medical Hunter, please make your move.

923
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:22,673
Medical Hunter captured
one of STEM Division's numbered pieces.

924
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,886
Their hunter may travel up like this.

925
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:29,013
What can we do to stop him?

926
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:37,229
Let's wait for their hunter to move,

927
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:40,941
have STEM 2 move down,
and let our hunter take his place.

928
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:42,401
STEM 2 CAN THEN EXIT THE BOARD

929
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:46,072
That puts us ahead of them.

930
00:47:46,155 --> 00:47:47,740
- STEM 2 exits before their guy, right?
- Yes.

931
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:48,908
In that case...

932
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,493
- STEM 3?
- Shall we?

933
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:53,454
- We decided to rescue him anyway.
- Sure.

934
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:02,713
I expect we'll have a fierce battle
of attacks and counterattacks from now on.

935
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:04,799
MEDICAL 1'S MOVE

936
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:07,385
STEM 3'S DEFENSIVE MANEUVER

937
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:09,553
Medical Hunter, please make your move.

938
00:48:09,637 --> 00:48:12,556
MEDICAL HUNTER'S MOVE

939
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:15,226
STEM 3'S MOVE

940
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:17,186
Where are they trying to send him?

941
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:18,396
What's their play?

942
00:48:19,105 --> 00:48:21,941
Making the turn here might be
the most difficult option for him to see.

943
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:24,860
Look behind you. There's an open spot.

944
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:35,162
- Thank goodness.
- All right.

945
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:36,330
This is neat.

946
00:48:36,414 --> 00:48:39,125
When our hunter gets here,
the game's over.

947
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:41,043
- What if--
- Hold on.

948
00:48:41,127 --> 00:48:41,961
What's up?

949
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:44,964
<i>One, two, three, four.</i>

950
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:46,924
<i>It's over. We can't do anything.</i>

951
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:48,342
- You're right.
- We lose.

952
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:50,428
We're going to lose?

953
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:53,431
We'll finally get
our checkmate this time, right?

954
00:48:53,514 --> 00:48:55,850
They can't throw a curve now.

955
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,685
We've said we won like five times already.

956
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:58,853
From the start, yes.

957
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:01,188
I was so sure during our first timeout,
but they scored a point.

958
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:03,441
We celebrated like five times already.

959
00:49:03,524 --> 00:49:05,359
Are we out of options?

960
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:07,611
- Let me think.
<i>- You have ten seconds left.</i>

961
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,533
- Shall we use Medical 5 as a bait?
- Let's try that.

962
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:15,619
Then, their hunter must retreat, right?

963
00:49:15,703 --> 00:49:17,955
That will cost them a turn, too.

964
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:21,500
Medical 5, please make your move.

965
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:26,088
What's their plan?

966
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:29,341
Oh, shoot.

967
00:49:29,717 --> 00:49:32,303
MEDICAL 3 CAN EXIT
USING MEDICAL 5 AS A WALL

968
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:35,639
- Dong-geon has to back away. How's here?
- Let's go for it.

969
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:39,935
They are no pushovers.

970
00:49:40,186 --> 00:49:45,399
MEDICAL 3 PUTS STEM HUNTER UNDER PRESSURE

971
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:48,777
STEM Hunter, please make your move.

972
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,661
- What if the hunter captures our guy?
- Wait.

973
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:01,040
The following 4 turns will go like this.
Then, Ji-hu can capture STEM 3.

974
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:02,374
We should call him, no?

975
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:03,334
NEW DEFENSE FOUND

976
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:05,044
<i>I hope Ji-hu will get our idea.</i>

977
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:08,756
Medical Hunter, please make your move.

978
00:50:12,468 --> 00:50:13,928
- As expected.
- Of course.

979
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,597
- He's a clever guy.
- Somehow,

980
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,225
we keep managing to find
the sole solution to our problems.

981
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,728
STEM 3, please make your move.

982
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:30,277
<i>- We'll call Ji-hu next, right?</i>
<i>- Yes, he can capture their guy.</i>

983
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,363
Please go catch him.

984
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:34,031
Please do, Ji-hu. He won't miss this.

985
00:50:36,075 --> 00:50:38,994
Medical Hunter, please make your move.

986
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,967
KANG JI-HU MOVED
AGAINST HIS LEADERS' WISHES

987
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:54,260
- No.
- Oh, no!

988
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:56,595
- Damn.
- No...

989
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:02,142
- The hunter...
- Thank goodness he went there.

990
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:04,937
Once our STEM 3 moves,
the game's as good as won.

991
00:51:05,646 --> 00:51:08,774
One, two, three, four...

992
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:12,611
STEM 3 REMAINS VULNERABLE
TO MEDICAL HUNTER

993
00:51:12,695 --> 00:51:15,114
Wait a minute. That can happen?

994
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:17,783
It's not over yet. We can still get him.

995
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:19,743
Three, four. You're right.

996
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:22,288
- It's not over yet.
- It's still on.

997
00:51:22,538 --> 00:51:24,248
Shall we call our hunter first?

998
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:26,584
I think we can skip STEM 3.

999
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:29,712
STEM Hunter, please make your move.

1000
00:51:34,008 --> 00:51:35,301
What the heck?

1001
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,262
What's their angle?

1002
00:51:39,597 --> 00:51:43,392
They must want to position him
as STEM 2's stepping stone.

1003
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:46,228
How do we prevent that?

1004
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:48,480
Medical 5 should travel up.

1005
00:51:48,564 --> 00:51:51,442
He can then get into position
using their hunter and help A-in exit.

1006
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:52,985
<i>- You have 10 seconds left.</i>
- Hit number 5.

1007
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,863
Let's take a leap of faith.
There's no other way.

1008
00:51:56,614 --> 00:51:59,283
Medical 5, please make your move.

1009
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:02,161
<i>- Medical 5, at this point?</i>
<i>- Medical 5?</i>

1010
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:04,997
If I were Medical 5,
my brain would just freeze.

1011
00:52:06,874 --> 00:52:09,251
<i>I was thinking that our best bet</i>

1012
00:52:09,335 --> 00:52:12,504
<i>was to send our hunter after their piece</i>
<i>and engage in the battle of wits.</i>

1013
00:52:12,588 --> 00:52:15,132
<i>But I was called to move</i>
<i>all out of the blue.</i>

1014
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:18,594
You have ten seconds left.

1015
00:52:24,433 --> 00:52:28,771
KIM DONG-YEON MOVED
AGAINST HIS LEADERS' WISHES

1016
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:31,065
Why would you go there?

1017
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:33,359
But why?

1018
00:52:36,779 --> 00:52:39,323
- Our only safe choice is our hunter.
- Yeah.

1019
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:40,658
Right?

1020
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:43,661
STEM Hunter, please make a move.

1021
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:55,130
This is our only avenue for attack.

1022
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:58,425
But their piece can leave in two turns.

1023
00:53:05,641 --> 00:53:08,811
I can't see a way around this.

1024
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:11,647
<i>You have ten seconds left.</i>

1025
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,273
Do we go with our hunter?

1026
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:15,442
- He has the best maneuverability.
- That's true.

1027
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:16,527
A RELUCTANT CHOICE

1028
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:19,613
Medical Hunter, please make your move.

1029
00:53:20,114 --> 00:53:21,824
STEM Hunter...

1030
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:25,035
Medical Hunter, please make your move.

1031
00:53:25,494 --> 00:53:28,247
STEM Hunter, please make your move.

1032
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:32,751
STEM DIVISION CAN HAVE
THEIR SECOND PIECE EXIT NEXT

1033
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,587
Medical Hunter, please make your move.

1034
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:44,096
STEM Division,
please select a piece to make a move.

1035
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:46,306
Make sure to press number two.

1036
00:53:47,516 --> 00:53:49,393
"STEM Hunter, please make your move."

1037
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:51,395
Number two.

1038
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:52,646
- Got it.
- Two.

1039
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:55,816
STEM 2, please make your move.

1040
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:02,823
STEM Division's second piece
exited the board.

1041
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:09,955
That concludes Round 1 of Exit Strategy 3.

1042
00:54:10,456 --> 00:54:12,666
The round ends in STEM Division's victory.

1043
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:14,460
STEM DIVISION WINS ROUND 1

1044
00:54:14,543 --> 00:54:15,377
It's over.

1045
00:54:15,461 --> 00:54:16,795
- Such a shame.
- How upsetting.

1046
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:20,799
It's so sad.

1047
00:54:20,883 --> 00:54:22,134
Good work.

1048
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:23,594
That was rough.

1049
00:54:23,844 --> 00:54:26,180
At any rate, we won Round 1.

1050
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:28,557
- Unbelievable.
- We could've prevented that.

1051
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,482
Both divisions,
please return to your Division Rooms.

1052
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:47,117
Well done, guys.

1053
00:54:47,201 --> 00:54:48,035
I'm so glad.

1054
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,995
- How did you pull through this?
- It was so close.

1055
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:52,581
I knew we would win this round.

1056
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:57,753
<i>The leaders and I saw eye to eye</i>
<i>every step of the way,</i>

1057
00:54:57,836 --> 00:55:00,380
and our players moved
the way the leaders wanted.

1058
00:55:00,464 --> 00:55:03,926
I'm proud of the amazing teamwork
we showed in Round 1.

1059
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:05,803
It's such a shame.

1060
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:08,305
We did great, and it was really close.

1061
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:10,432
We have it in us to beat them
in the next rounds.

1062
00:55:10,516 --> 00:55:13,560
Let's fire up our good teamwork
and win the remaining rounds.

1063
00:55:13,644 --> 00:55:16,063
- Okay, let's get back to the game.
- We called Medical 5...

1064
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:19,441
MEDICAL DIVISION REVIEWS ROUND 1

1065
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:21,735
I don't blame you for not catching it.

1066
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:23,695
He might've
if we had called him one turn later.

1067
00:55:23,779 --> 00:55:26,073
We did call you
when their hunter was here.

1068
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:27,533
I guess we jumped the gun.

1069
00:55:27,616 --> 00:55:32,037
If we had called you when he was here,
you would've noticed and thought of a way.

1070
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:35,958
We were on par with STEM Division
despite conceding a point early on.

1071
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:40,462
That made me believe
that we could win the two coming rounds.

1072
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:45,509
<i>Round 2 of Exit Strategy 3 will now begin.</i>

1073
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:48,303
<i>You have 20 minutes to discuss strategies.</i>

1074
00:55:48,929 --> 00:55:51,849
It just dawned on me
that we can place multiple pieces here

1075
00:55:51,932 --> 00:55:54,434
and have them wait.

1076
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:56,979
If their hunter approaches,

1077
00:55:57,062 --> 00:55:59,314
we can set up STEM 2 against him
and have STEM 3 exit.

1078
00:55:59,398 --> 00:56:02,276
LINING UP IN THE CENTRAL ROW
FOR AN IMMEDIATE EXIT

1079
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:07,030
Pieces lined up in the central row alone
was pretty intimidating to me.

1080
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:09,491
Looking back on our moves in Round 1,

1081
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:13,704
we mostly used our numbered pieces
to build set pieces early on.

1082
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:16,123
But STEM Division
mostly used their hunter.

1083
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:18,625
- That's true.
- Early on, they relied on their hunter.

1084
00:56:18,709 --> 00:56:22,087
I think that will remain
as their core strategy.

1085
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:24,464
We should consider
involving our hunter in attacks

1086
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:25,632
since we're going first.

1087
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:26,967
<i>At the start...</i>

1088
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,677
<i>One, two, three, four.</i>

1089
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,971
<i>We'll call our hunter</i>
<i>for four turns straight.</i>

1090
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:33,599
Let's say Ji-hu moves here.

1091
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:37,019
- We can set up Medical 4 here.
- Oh, that's your goal?

1092
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:41,231
We need to make preparations
to score twice in minimal steps.

1093
00:56:42,024 --> 00:56:45,444
<i>You have two minutes left.</i>

1094
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:47,362
Shouldn't we decide on our roles?

1095
00:56:47,696 --> 00:56:49,531
- Any volunteers for the hunter?
- You're it, dude.

1096
00:56:49,615 --> 00:56:50,699
Understood.

1097
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:52,242
GOING INTO ROUND 2 WITHOUT CHANGES

1098
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:53,452
<i>We worked well together,</i>

1099
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:55,537
<i>so I wanted everyone</i>
<i>to keep their positions.</i>

1100
00:56:56,038 --> 00:56:58,165
Let's win the next round
and wrap this up quickly.

1101
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:01,543
- We're not changing the leaders, right?
- No.

1102
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:04,963
<i>Our defeat wasn't</i>
<i>due to anyone's weak performance.</i>

1103
00:57:05,047 --> 00:57:07,507
<i>We decided to keep everyone</i>
<i>in their original position</i>

1104
00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:09,426
so they could draw on their experience.

1105
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:14,765
<i>Both divisions, please gather</i>
<i>at the main hall for the main match.</i>

1106
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:17,643
Let's do our chant.

1107
00:57:17,726 --> 00:57:18,560
Come on.

1108
00:57:18,644 --> 00:57:19,561
Medical Division!

1109
00:57:19,645 --> 00:57:21,605
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1110
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:23,440
- How about a chant?
- Let's do it.

1111
00:57:24,316 --> 00:57:25,192
STEM Division!

1112
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:26,985
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1113
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:30,822
Pieces of both divisions,
please go to your positions.

1114
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:35,953
ALL THE NUMBERED PIECES ARE IN PLACE

1115
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:39,039
Hunters, please enter the board.

1116
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:48,757
What's this? They tweaked their placement.

1117
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:51,385
What's this?

1118
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:53,136
Why did they put their hunter here?

1119
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:55,263
- He's standing far in the back.
- He's here, isn't he?

1120
00:57:55,347 --> 00:57:57,808
<i>- Can you double-check for me?</i>
<i>- He's here.</i>

1121
00:57:58,684 --> 00:58:02,187
<i>STEM Division's new placement</i>
<i>took us by surprise.</i>

1122
00:58:03,397 --> 00:58:05,524
Fortunately,
they don't have any surprises.

1123
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:07,609
Our hunter will handle
most of the traveling.

1124
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:09,903
- We have it all mapped out.
- Sure.

1125
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:15,742
We're going second, so why don't we
let them take this and run up this way?

1126
00:58:16,535 --> 00:58:17,953
<i>- I'll be here--</i>
<i>- At the start?</i>

1127
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:20,330
<i>- Yes, I'll head to the central column.</i>
<i>- With STEM 5 here?</i>

1128
00:58:20,414 --> 00:58:21,790
<i>Yes, exactly.</i>

1129
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:24,543
<i>Then, Medical 4 will get here.</i>
<i>Why don't I take him out?</i>

1130
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:26,962
THE HUNTER WILL MOVE
TO SHUT DOWN THE OPPONENT'S PLAY

1131
00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:29,589
- Let's think.
- Okay.

1132
00:58:30,716 --> 00:58:34,136
We will now begin Round 2
of the main match, Exit Strategy 3.

1133
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:35,053
EXIT STRATEGY 3
ROUND 2

1134
00:58:35,137 --> 00:58:38,640
Medical Division,
please select a piece to make a move.

1135
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:41,601
I think they'll attack this way.

1136
00:58:41,685 --> 00:58:42,978
Oh, I get it.

1137
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:44,271
Using these two, right?

1138
00:58:46,982 --> 00:58:50,193
What can they do if Medical 4 blocks that?

1139
00:58:51,153 --> 00:58:54,072
Medical 4, please make your move.

1140
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:58,744
<i>We agreed to utilize</i>
<i>the hunter at the outset.</i>

1141
00:58:58,827 --> 00:59:00,954
<i>So I wondered why they called my number.</i>

1142
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,879
<i>Okay, great.</i>

1143
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:12,632
- I think we can call our hunter.
- Agreed.

1144
00:59:13,592 --> 00:59:15,469
<i>That's a prime spot.</i>

1145
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:17,220
<i>- I'll call our hunter.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

1146
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:21,308
STEM HUNTER'S MOVE

1147
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:26,605
- What is it?
- Doesn't this row here

1148
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:29,066
- look promising?
- I see what you mean.

1149
00:59:29,149 --> 00:59:30,859
Shall we just send Medical 3 over?

1150
00:59:31,777 --> 00:59:34,738
Medical 3, please make your move.

1151
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:35,822
MEDICAL 3'S MOVE

1152
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:45,332
How would they respond
if our hunter got here?

1153
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:47,959
I guess Medical 4 can retreat
and waste his turn.

1154
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:49,920
<i>I'll call our hunter, then.</i>

1155
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:53,173
STEM Hunter, please make your move.

1156
00:59:56,051 --> 00:59:58,512
<i>- Hit number 4.</i>
<i>- Let's roll with Medical 4.</i>

1157
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:01,807
MEDICAL 4'S MOVE

1158
01:00:02,057 --> 01:00:03,016
<i>Hunter, of course.</i>

1159
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:05,519
When he approaches, Medical 4 will run.

1160
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:08,355
Isn't it better for us
to have Medical 4 here?

1161
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:09,439
For sure.

1162
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:12,275
STEM Hunter, please make your move.

1163
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:13,485
STEM HUNTER'S MOVE

1164
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:18,031
Medical 4 has to get back here.

1165
01:00:18,115 --> 01:00:20,617
Then, we can't utilize our hunter.

1166
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:22,828
Things got a little crazy for us.

1167
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:25,288
You have ten seconds left.

1168
01:00:26,373 --> 01:00:29,167
- But we need Medical 4. Let's save him.
- Go for it.

1169
01:00:29,251 --> 01:00:30,836
MEDICAL 4'S MOVE

1170
01:00:36,133 --> 01:00:40,095
STEM Division,
please select a piece to make a move.

1171
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:42,305
Let's think this over.

1172
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:47,644
You have 30 seconds left.

1173
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:51,773
A timeout, please.

1174
01:00:51,982 --> 01:00:53,358
A timeout, please.

1175
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:55,152
STEM HUNTER'S TIMEOUT A REQUEST

1176
01:00:58,029 --> 01:00:59,906
Did he catch something just now?

1177
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,199
He must've.

1178
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:03,910
Otherwise,
he wouldn't have called a timeout.

1179
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:07,622
- I guess he has a plan.
- Yeah.

1180
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:11,418
STEM Division requested a timeout.

1181
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:15,589
I'm worried about their hunter
coming into our camp.

1182
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:16,965
If he positions himself here--

1183
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:19,676
Then, two guys can leave. It's really bad.

1184
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:22,470
What are the odds
of their hunter not moving?

1185
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:26,141
- Very low. They don't have many options.
- Their biggest swing for now

1186
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:27,726
is sending the hunter here.

1187
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:29,936
TIMEOUT ENDS

1188
01:01:30,604 --> 01:01:32,480
Let us resume the game.

1189
01:01:34,983 --> 01:01:37,861
STEM 1, please make your move.

1190
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:38,904
STEM 1'S MOVE

1191
01:01:39,196 --> 01:01:40,030
What?

1192
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:41,907
MEDICAL DIVISION PREDICTED
STEM HUNTER WOULD MOVE

1193
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,619
See? They want to take the central column.

1194
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:49,831
TIMEOUT
Listen, guys.

1195
01:01:50,582 --> 01:01:51,791
Call STEM 1 first.

1196
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:54,127
KIM DONG-GEON REQUESTED A TIMEOUT
FOR THIS MOVE

1197
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:56,046
If I move here,
Medical 4 becomes an issue.

1198
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:57,464
They might score first.

1199
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:59,007
MEDICAL 4 CAN TAKE THE CENTRAL ROW

1200
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:01,968
I think we should have STEM 1 move first.

1201
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:03,053
TO SECURE THE CENTRAL COLUMN

1202
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:06,640
So you want the threat neutralized
before moving on to scoring.

1203
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:07,682
All right.

1204
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:13,188
AS PLANNED,
STEM DIVISION TOOK THE CENTRAL COLUMN

1205
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:15,732
What we can do now is call Medical 1

1206
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:18,652
so he can exit the board
right after their piece leaves.

1207
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:19,653
You're right.

1208
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:21,780
<i>- We've got to, right?</i>
<i>- Yes, go for it.</i>

1209
01:02:21,863 --> 01:02:24,783
MEDICAL 1'S MOVE

1210
01:02:28,036 --> 01:02:30,330
<i>We can roll with STEM 1, no?</i>

1211
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:33,541
STEM 1'S MOVE

1212
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:37,671
Shouldn't we get Medical 4 out of the way?

1213
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:40,257
We should make way for our hunter,
just in case.

1214
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:41,675
- You want Medical 4 here?
- Yes.

1215
01:02:42,133 --> 01:02:45,053
<i>Okay, let's call him</i>
<i>and clear the road for our hunter.</i>

1216
01:02:45,971 --> 01:02:48,682
I think they're trying
to make way for their hunter.

1217
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:50,350
<i>Still, our guys can exit the board.</i>

1218
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:51,434
<i>- I'll call our hunter.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

1219
01:02:51,518 --> 01:02:52,852
<i>- That's for the best, right?</i>
<i>- Sure.</i>

1220
01:02:54,896 --> 01:02:56,731
Our hunter should also approach the exit.

1221
01:02:56,815 --> 01:02:58,608
- Agreed?
- Yes, let's call him.

1222
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:02,070
<i>Our hunter has to move closer</i>
<i>to seize the exit area.</i>

1223
01:03:02,153 --> 01:03:04,990
<i>- We've actually been delayed.</i>
<i>- Okay, I get your point.</i>

1224
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:07,284
We'd need our hunter here, right?

1225
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:08,994
I suggest STEM 5.

1226
01:03:09,077 --> 01:03:10,203
- For the next move?
- Yes.

1227
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:12,122
STEM 1 can hold Medical 1 back.

1228
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:13,665
Then, we can get these two to exit.

1229
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:14,833
USING THE CENTRAL ROW

1230
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:16,835
Without moving the hunter? Okay.

1231
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:19,087
<i>STEM 5, it is.</i>

1232
01:03:21,256 --> 01:03:22,424
Why STEM 5?

1233
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,092
So no exits for now?

1234
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:27,595
We could send our hunter
to press STEM 1 to exit the board.

1235
01:03:27,846 --> 01:03:29,681
- Okay, we'll call our hunter
- Okay.

1236
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:30,932
to force STEM 1's hand.

1237
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:34,853
Medical Hunter, please make your move.

1238
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:37,772
- Maybe--
- Hang on!

1239
01:03:37,856 --> 01:03:38,857
What's the matter?

1240
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:39,816
We're going to lose.

1241
01:03:39,899 --> 01:03:43,111
- What? How come?
- Because we can't stop them.

1242
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:44,029
There's no way.

1243
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:50,869
I'd like to request a timeout.

1244
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:53,246
MEDICAL HUNTER'S TIMEOUT REQUEST

1245
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:56,207
Medical Division requested a timeout.

1246
01:03:57,125 --> 01:03:59,252
You'll be given five minutes.

1247
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:02,130
Isn't it basically over?

1248
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:05,550
- We're about to lose.
- No matter where I choose to go...

1249
01:04:05,633 --> 01:04:08,053
If I go here,
we're going to lose for sure.

1250
01:04:08,136 --> 01:04:10,013
It's the same even if I go elsewhere.

1251
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:14,768
Great work, guys.

1252
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:16,227
We're on the same page, no?

1253
01:04:16,311 --> 01:04:18,229
I liked that you didn't call STEM 1.

1254
01:04:18,313 --> 01:04:20,815
- My only concern now is
- Good job.

1255
01:04:20,899 --> 01:04:23,109
that Ji-hu requested a timeout.

1256
01:04:23,193 --> 01:04:24,736
He might have a way out of this.

1257
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:26,738
I think he did it because he had none.

1258
01:04:26,821 --> 01:04:30,033
Given our situation,
our hunter has to make a move.

1259
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:31,368
- He can't go here.
- No.

1260
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:33,828
Is there no way to stop them in two turns?

1261
01:04:34,412 --> 01:04:35,872
What if he went to the right?

1262
01:04:36,206 --> 01:04:38,541
<i>Once STEM 1 exits,</i>
<i>Ji-hu can close in on Dong-geon.</i>

1263
01:04:38,625 --> 01:04:40,001
<i>Then, Dong-geon can't move left.</i>

1264
01:04:40,085 --> 01:04:42,128
BRINGS 2 PIECES HOME
AFTER HOLDING STEM HUNTER IN PLACE

1265
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:45,131
- You're right!
- That's incredible.

1266
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:46,549
To get to this point,

1267
01:04:46,633 --> 01:04:49,302
we'll have to pray
that they call STEM 1 home.

1268
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:52,097
It's our only option.
We lose otherwise, right?

1269
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:54,349
<i>- Your time is up.</i>
- Let's go.

1270
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:55,892
- Good luck.
- We've got this!

1271
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:00,980
Let us resume the game.

1272
01:05:01,064 --> 01:05:03,775
Medical Hunter, please make your move.

1273
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:07,237
AS PLANNED,
MEDICAL HUNTER TAKES A STEP TO HIS RIGHT

1274
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:11,282
STEM Division,
please select a piece to make a move.

1275
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:13,410
Please bring STEM 1 home.

1276
01:05:13,493 --> 01:05:14,953
Then, we get our way out.

1277
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:17,205
- Call STEM 1.
- Leave the board, STEM 1.

1278
01:05:17,288 --> 01:05:18,540
Come on, STEM 1.

1279
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:20,250
Please forget the hunter's button.

1280
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:21,167
<i>Hit number one.</i>

1281
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:22,210
A CRITICAL DECISION

1282
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:25,088
- Let's get right to it.
- Okay.

1283
01:05:25,547 --> 01:05:26,881
STEM...

1284
01:05:31,094 --> 01:05:33,054
- Please...
<i>- STEM Hunter,</i>

1285
01:05:33,138 --> 01:05:34,472
<i>please make your move.</i>

1286
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:38,810
Let's review this.

1287
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:45,233
<i>That's when I felt sure the game was ours.</i>

1288
01:05:45,316 --> 01:05:48,736
Medical Division,
please select a piece to make a move.

1289
01:05:50,238 --> 01:05:51,614
<i>You have ten seconds left.</i>

1290
01:05:52,323 --> 01:05:54,534
What do I do? We're out of ideas.

1291
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:58,329
Medical 4, please make your move.

1292
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:04,669
STEM Hunter, please make your move.

1293
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:09,966
STEM DIVISION'S 3 PIECES ARE READY TO EXIT

1294
01:06:10,508 --> 01:06:12,385
- Oh, no. It's over.
- What a shame.

1295
01:06:13,428 --> 01:06:15,430
This is just...

1296
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:21,102
I can't believe we got
a crushing defeat like this.

1297
01:06:22,145 --> 01:06:24,898
Medical Hunter, please make your move.

1298
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:30,820
Let's line up two pieces
and have them exit back-to-back

1299
01:06:30,904 --> 01:06:33,072
- for some thrill.
- For some thrill?

1300
01:06:33,364 --> 01:06:36,117
STEM 3, please make your move.

1301
01:06:36,201 --> 01:06:37,202
STEM 3'S MOVE

1302
01:06:38,286 --> 01:06:41,122
Medical Hunter, please make your move.

1303
01:06:42,957 --> 01:06:45,210
STEM 3, please make your move.

1304
01:06:47,086 --> 01:06:50,548
STEM Division's first piece
exited the board.

1305
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:55,637
STEM 5, please make your move.

1306
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:03,853
STEM Division's second piece
exited the board.

1307
01:07:06,564 --> 01:07:09,150
That concludes Round 2 of Exit Strategy 3.

1308
01:07:09,234 --> 01:07:11,361
The round ends in STEM Division's victory.

1309
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:12,779
STEM DIVISION WINS EXIT STRATEGY 3

1310
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:16,866
They're so good.

1311
01:07:17,742 --> 01:07:19,035
Annoyingly so.

1312
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:21,246
Seriously, it bugs me how good they are.

1313
01:07:21,913 --> 01:07:25,083
We've been on the same wavelength
the whole time. I loved it.

1314
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:30,296
<i>The devastating loss in Mine and Trade</i>
<i>made me fear Medical Division.</i>

1315
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:33,758
But today's game taught me
that they weren't so invincible.

1316
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:36,261
It looks like we can keep winning
going forward.

1317
01:07:36,344 --> 01:07:38,304
<i>My team and Team SNU in STEM</i>
<i>clicked so well.</i>

1318
01:07:38,388 --> 01:07:40,890
I think our division can win
if we can keep it up.

1319
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:42,767
I gained that confidence today.

1320
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:46,271
I'm upset that we gave them
a landslide victory in Round 2.

1321
01:07:47,105 --> 01:07:50,191
<i>Maybe we should've been bold</i>
<i>and called a timeout early on.</i>

1322
01:07:50,275 --> 01:07:51,818
<i>That's my biggest regret.</i>

1323
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:54,404
<i>By the game's design,</i>

1324
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:59,993
<i>our decisions as leaders</i>

Let's make sure

01:08:43,453 --> 01:08:45,788
<i>All the winners experienced</i>

<i>We will now begin today's Deathmatch.</i>

1341
01:08:51,628 --> 01:08:53,630
Go for it. But don't share anything.

1342
01:08:53,713 --> 01:08:55,131
That was a killer.

01:08:55,214 --> 01:08:57,592
<i>You have to be that bold</i>

If Team SKKU goes home,
we'll be in a better position.

1346
01:09:02,013 --> 01:09:03,097
Run it quickly.

1347
01:09:03,181 --> 01:09:04,265

- That's 89?

1348
01:09:04,349 --> 01:09:05,892
Hit that buzzer.

1349
01:09:06,893 --> 01:09:07,852
You again, Ji-hu?

1350
01:09:07,935 --> 01:09:10,355
- This seems impossible.
- I'm in utter awe.

1351
01:09:10,438 --> 01:09:11,814
<i>Team SKKU is the biggest threat.</i>

1352
01:09:11,898 --> 01:09:13,149
<i>Why are they targeting Team Yonsei?</i>
