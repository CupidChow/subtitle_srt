1
00:00:15,133 --> 00:00:17,766
I have a message to Freya.
Can you deliver it?

2
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:19,167
It's us who have a message for you.

3
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:22,605
Jay!

4
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:24,148
Take the fall for this
incident with Section D.

5
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,276
Because Keifer can't be
implicated in anymore trouble.

6
00:00:26,746 --> 00:00:27,746
[Jay-jay screams]

7
00:00:28,463 --> 00:00:29,505
On the count of three...

8
00:00:29,828 --> 00:00:30,870
Three!

9
00:00:33,632 --> 00:00:34,550
Where exactly are we?

10
00:00:34,633 --> 00:00:36,969
This is not a house. It's a building!

11
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:38,262
I know.

12
00:00:38,387 --> 00:00:40,221
Who is this girl with you?

13
00:00:40,222 --> 00:00:42,182
Why did you bring her here?

14
00:00:42,516 --> 00:00:43,996
We're having a sleepover.
Just us two.

15
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:45,936
What the hell!

16
00:00:46,145 --> 00:00:47,895
We were suddenly attacked by that girl!

17
00:00:47,896 --> 00:00:49,647
We tried fighting her off, but...

18
00:00:49,648 --> 00:00:50,815
She's a girl.

19
00:00:50,816 --> 00:00:51,983
Stop it!

20
00:00:51,984 --> 00:00:53,777
I was the one who started it.

21
00:00:53,861 --> 00:00:54,612
Let's toast.

22
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:55,487
To Jay-jay.

23
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:56,779
And the downfall of Aries.

24
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,657
Cheers!

25
00:01:00,451 --> 00:01:01,535
Jay-jay!

26
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:06,331
Come.

27
00:01:17,134 --> 00:01:19,470
Bok, bok, bok... Bok!

28
00:01:19,762 --> 00:01:22,723
Bok... Bok... Bok, bok!

29
00:01:23,766 --> 00:01:27,311
Bok... Bok... Bok! Bok! Bok!

30
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:28,770
Stop!

31
00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:30,356
What's your problem?

32
00:01:30,606 --> 00:01:31,523
Tss!

33
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:32,775
Playing while walking?

34
00:01:33,108 --> 00:01:34,150
What if you trip?

35
00:01:34,151 --> 00:01:35,819
So what? Why do you care?

36
00:01:37,988 --> 00:01:38,989
[Jay-jay exclaims]

37
00:02:08,102 --> 00:02:12,314
When did the King of Assholes
learn to smile like this?

38
00:02:13,649 --> 00:02:14,942
What if you got hurt?

39
00:02:15,192 --> 00:02:16,568
You would cry silly.

40
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:18,487
Then we would have
to take care of you.

41
00:02:19,363 --> 00:02:20,906
I could kick you, you know.

42
00:02:23,242 --> 00:02:27,287
What the hell... What did this guy eat?
He's been weird all week.

43
00:02:33,085 --> 00:02:34,670
Has he accepted me?

44
00:02:34,962 --> 00:02:36,255
Are we okay now?

45
00:02:36,755 --> 00:02:38,716
Should I give him another chance?

46
00:04:13,352 --> 00:04:15,728
Here. Quickly before
anyone could see you.

47
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:17,647
Thank you, Ms. Lylia.
You know, you're super nice.

48
00:04:17,648 --> 00:04:19,232
I can still buy water from you
even though it's not allowed.

49
00:04:19,233 --> 00:04:20,817
That's okay. It's still extra
income for me.

50
00:04:20,818 --> 00:04:23,570
- Thank you really. Until next time!
- Okay, okay.

51
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,663
Hey!

52
00:04:39,962 --> 00:04:41,255
Who's there?

53
00:04:47,594 --> 00:04:48,887
[Jay-jay exclaims]

54
00:04:49,346 --> 00:04:51,223
[Mica softly crying]

55
00:04:52,307 --> 00:04:53,307
Miss?

56
00:04:54,351 --> 00:04:55,394
Please...

57
00:04:55,686 --> 00:04:57,312
Don't tell Aries...

58
00:04:57,896 --> 00:04:59,565
That I'm hiding here.

59
00:05:04,611 --> 00:05:06,362
Please...

60
00:05:06,363 --> 00:05:07,738
Hey, stand up.

61
00:05:07,739 --> 00:05:09,908
I'm begging you, Jay.

62
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,450
Please...

63
00:05:11,952 --> 00:05:14,496
Yes, I won't tell him. Just stand up.

64
00:05:15,163 --> 00:05:16,373
Get on your feet.

65
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:21,128
[Mica sobbing]

66
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,339
Mica?

67
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,341
You're Mica, right?

68
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:33,639
What happened to you?

69
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,642
[Mica sobbing]

70
00:05:39,187 --> 00:05:40,606
Don't worry.

71
00:05:40,898 --> 00:05:43,525
I won't tell Aries a thing.
We're not that close anyway.

72
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:49,615
It was Section D...

73
00:05:50,574 --> 00:05:52,784
They did this to me.

74
00:05:54,786 --> 00:05:55,786
Why?

75
00:05:57,873 --> 00:05:58,957
I don't know.

76
00:06:02,002 --> 00:06:05,047
But I'm sure Aries told them to.

77
00:06:08,508 --> 00:06:10,028
When did they start doing this to you?

78
00:06:10,844 --> 00:06:11,970
Right after...

79
00:06:13,055 --> 00:06:15,098
Right after you and
Freya got into a fight.

80
00:06:16,558 --> 00:06:18,101
And no one helped you?

81
00:06:18,352 --> 00:06:20,395
Your classmates just let it happen?

82
00:06:21,355 --> 00:06:22,355
No one...

83
00:06:23,315 --> 00:06:25,859
Ella could have, but... she hasn't
come back to school yet.

84
00:06:27,527 --> 00:06:29,404
Come with me to Section E for now.

85
00:06:29,863 --> 00:06:31,489
I can't leave you here.

86
00:06:31,577 --> 00:06:33,541
Those jerks from Section D might come back.

87
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,910
I can't.

88
00:06:35,535 --> 00:06:38,288
Why? Don't worry.
I won't take you to Aries.

89
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,499
It's not that.

90
00:06:41,917 --> 00:06:43,126
It's because...

91
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:45,169
It's...

92
00:06:46,713 --> 00:06:48,757
To Calix, From Mica?

93
00:06:49,216 --> 00:06:50,592
[Jay-jay gasps]

94
00:06:53,261 --> 00:06:54,596
Is it Calix?

95
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:05,232
Here.

96
00:07:05,816 --> 00:07:07,150
Come, we're safe here.

97
00:07:07,401 --> 00:07:08,777
There's no Section D.

98
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:11,113
Come, I'll help you clean up.

99
00:07:11,822 --> 00:07:14,574
Then I'll fix your hair. It's so messy.

100
00:07:31,758 --> 00:07:32,758
Let me have a look.

101
00:07:33,427 --> 00:07:34,427
Show me.

102
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:38,432
Sorry, sorry.

103
00:07:43,145 --> 00:07:44,187
You're a mess.

104
00:07:45,355 --> 00:07:46,355
Want me to bathe you?

105
00:07:46,356 --> 00:07:47,356
Huh?

106
00:07:47,816 --> 00:07:49,192
Oh. Nothing.

107
00:07:52,154 --> 00:07:54,448
Oh... Can you try saying this?

108
00:07:55,365 --> 00:07:57,451
"Ella is a whore."

109
00:07:58,452 --> 00:07:59,452
Why?

110
00:07:59,911 --> 00:08:01,997
Just do it. Make it sound
overly dramatic.

111
00:08:02,497 --> 00:08:04,124
How does it go again?

112
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:05,959
It goes like...

113
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:08,045
"Ella is a whore."

114
00:08:08,462 --> 00:08:09,462
Like that.

115
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:12,591
Ella is a whore.

116
00:08:12,632 --> 00:08:14,342
See? Confirmed.

117
00:08:14,801 --> 00:08:15,801
Huh?

118
00:08:16,219 --> 00:08:17,888
Freya said that, not you.

119
00:08:18,305 --> 00:08:21,140
Even when you try to be dramatic,
your voice is low. Demure.

120
00:08:21,141 --> 00:08:25,353
I remember the voice of that person,
it's too high and exaggerated.

121
00:08:25,937 --> 00:08:26,937
It was really Freya.

122
00:08:27,022 --> 00:08:28,899
"Uh." She even does that.

123
00:08:30,192 --> 00:08:31,192
Jay...

124
00:08:31,234 --> 00:08:33,445
Even if you're sure of who it was...

125
00:08:34,154 --> 00:08:38,116
it won't matter if Aries
refuses to listen to you.

126
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:42,788
Don't worry about it.
I'll think of a way somehow.

127
00:08:42,871 --> 00:08:43,871
Promise.

128
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:49,273
You really don't want to take a bath?

129
00:08:51,213 --> 00:08:53,006
Okay, then. I'll just wipe you down.

130
00:08:54,132 --> 00:08:55,175
Does this hurt?

131
00:08:56,093 --> 00:08:58,261
Sorry, sorry. Does it hurt?

132
00:08:59,012 --> 00:08:59,721
What a mess.

Hey, Jay!

135
00:09:03,475 --> 00:09:04,935
- Where were you—
- Why is she here?

136
00:09:05,227 --> 00:09:06,311
Why is that girl here?

137
00:09:08,021 --> 00:09:09,021
It's Mica.

138
00:09:11,066 --> 00:09:12,275
Why is she with you?

139
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,562
Mica?

140
00:09:16,238 --> 00:09:18,448
Uh-uh-uh! Stay there!

141
00:09:18,698 --> 00:09:20,407
You should be 10 feet away from her!

142
00:09:20,408 --> 00:09:22,535
Move back! Move back!

143
00:09:22,536 --> 00:09:23,954
Over there!

144
00:09:25,038 --> 00:09:27,832
One more step. Go further back!

145
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,084
Stay right there.

146
00:09:29,209 --> 00:09:30,460
Go ahead, sit down.

What happened?

148
00:09:34,631 --> 00:09:35,924
Tell me what happened.

- Ouch!
- Jay, be careful! Mica's getting hurt!

aren't bleeding yet!

he sees that girl here?

- No!

you don't even think twice?

Why can't you do the same for Mica?

00:11:12,395 --> 00:11:15,649
I'm only gonna say this once.
So get this in your head.

188
00:11:17,651 --> 00:11:18,902
If it's not you...

189
00:11:19,319 --> 00:11:20,320
then I don't care.

190
00:11:24,324 --> 00:11:26,117
[teasing continues]

191
00:11:30,872 --> 00:11:32,332
Whatever. She stays here.

192
00:11:34,834 --> 00:11:36,418
Let him be. Just ignore him.

193
00:11:36,419 --> 00:11:37,796
- Tss!
- He's just being a dumbass.

194
00:11:49,849 --> 00:11:53,770
"If it's not you, I don't care?"
What was that?

195
00:11:54,104 --> 00:11:55,563
- Jay...
- Huh?

196
00:11:56,147 --> 00:11:59,567
I'm sorry. You had to cut
classes because of me.

197
00:12:00,694 --> 00:12:05,030
You know, if you pay me every time
you apologize, I could buy a pair of shoes.

198
00:12:05,031 --> 00:12:06,199
You say it too much.

199
00:12:06,574 --> 00:12:07,659
I'm really sorry.

200
00:12:07,909 --> 00:12:09,953
That's nothing.
Don't worry about it.

201
00:12:10,245 --> 00:12:12,372
My conscience won't
let me leave you behind.

202
00:12:12,831 --> 00:12:16,835
Thank you, Jay. But you don't need
to take me home.

203
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:19,003
Jay...

204
00:12:19,129 --> 00:12:20,964
you think they're still following us?

205
00:12:23,883 --> 00:12:26,593
Shh! 10 feet away! 10 feet!

206
00:12:26,594 --> 00:12:28,221
Is that hard to understand?

207
00:12:28,847 --> 00:12:29,847
Calix.

208
00:12:29,973 --> 00:12:31,182
So hard-headed.

209
00:12:33,685 --> 00:12:34,685
Mica...

210
00:12:35,312 --> 00:12:38,023
Is it okay if I ask something
about you and Calix?

211
00:12:38,398 --> 00:12:40,233
What's the real deal
between the two of you?

212
00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:46,363
It all started with...

213
00:12:46,364 --> 00:12:47,699
Why don't you sit down?

214
00:12:47,991 --> 00:12:48,991
Quick.

215
00:12:51,536 --> 00:12:53,038
Should we approach them?

216
00:12:54,164 --> 00:12:55,206
Let's go.

217
00:12:55,915 --> 00:12:57,250
Let’s not go near yet.

218
00:12:58,084 --> 00:12:59,085
Quit pushing it!

219
00:13:02,589 --> 00:13:03,589
Tell me.

220
00:13:04,674 --> 00:13:07,302
It all started with a love letter.

221
00:13:08,345 --> 00:13:09,387
Calix.

222
00:13:09,763 --> 00:13:10,804
What's up?

223
00:13:10,805 --> 00:13:11,972
I hope you will read this.

224
00:13:11,973 --> 00:13:13,808
I had a huge crush on him.

225
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,394
So I mustered up the
courage to let him know.

226
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:18,355
Hey, Calix.

227
00:13:19,647 --> 00:13:22,484
Don't throw that love letter away.
She's my friend.

228
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,027
I'll get mad at you.

229
00:13:24,361 --> 00:13:26,363
She's been crushing on you for a long time.

230
00:13:26,946 --> 00:13:30,200
I tried stopping her
because you're a playboy.

231
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,118
I'm not a playboy.

232
00:13:33,119 --> 00:13:35,121
It's not my fault that girls love me.

233
00:13:37,415 --> 00:13:38,833
You're a playboy.

234
00:13:39,042 --> 00:13:41,168
- Really, playboy?
- I'm just joking!

235
00:13:41,169 --> 00:13:42,420
I don't know.

236
00:13:42,587 --> 00:13:44,714
No matter how much Ella warned me...

237
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,257
I still pushed through.

238
00:13:47,717 --> 00:13:50,386
Until we became an official couple.

239
00:13:50,387 --> 00:13:52,055
[Jay-jay reacts excitedly]

240
00:13:53,723 --> 00:13:54,808
What did she say?

241
00:13:57,394 --> 00:13:59,437
We even called each other "baby."

242
00:13:59,729 --> 00:14:01,146
"Baby." That's cute.

243
00:14:01,147 --> 00:14:03,566
But we didn't tell anyone about it.

244
00:14:04,609 --> 00:14:06,861
Until Ella eventually found out.

245
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,201
Mica.

246
00:14:13,576 --> 00:14:15,245
Are you here alone?

247
00:14:16,663 --> 00:14:18,540
Calix stood me up.

248
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:20,875
Want me to join you?

249
00:14:21,835 --> 00:14:23,837
Alright. Thank you.

250
00:14:31,428 --> 00:14:32,887
Hey... are you okay?

251
00:14:35,849 --> 00:14:38,017
Did you know that Keifer confessed to me?

252
00:14:38,768 --> 00:14:39,978
Are you serious?

253
00:14:40,395 --> 00:14:41,646
Do you like him?

254
00:14:42,856 --> 00:14:43,898
Yeah.

255
00:14:45,108 --> 00:14:46,693
Then why are you sad about it?

256
00:14:47,902 --> 00:14:49,779
Because Yuri confessed to me too.

257
00:14:50,947 --> 00:14:54,284
So I guess... that's why they don't
seem to talk to each other.

258
00:14:55,785 --> 00:14:56,995
What's your plan?

259
00:14:59,789 --> 00:15:00,874
I don't know.

260
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,168
I like Keifer.

261
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:05,753
But I don't want to hurt Yuri.

262
00:15:07,338 --> 00:15:08,548
So, you...

263
00:15:08,882 --> 00:15:10,675
be cautious when it comes to love.

264
00:15:11,468 --> 00:15:14,429
Because I've been hearing that
Calix has another girlfriend.

265
00:15:14,888 --> 00:15:15,888
What?

266
00:15:16,264 --> 00:15:18,808
I'm just letting you know
because I'm concerned.

267
00:15:19,142 --> 00:15:20,727
Be careful with Calix.

268
00:15:23,104 --> 00:15:27,400
Since then, what Ella
told me never left my mind.

269
00:15:29,277 --> 00:15:31,070
Calix also changed.

270
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,780
He's not going to our
meeting place anymore.

271
00:15:33,781 --> 00:15:34,781
Oh?

272
00:15:35,116 --> 00:15:37,243
And then one day...

273
00:15:37,785 --> 00:15:39,703
I saw her kissing another girl.

274
00:15:39,704 --> 00:15:41,206
Son of a...

275
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,461
But he tried after that.

276
00:15:46,794 --> 00:15:49,297
He did a lot to win me back.

277
00:15:49,964 --> 00:15:51,216
To say sorry.

278
00:15:51,966 --> 00:15:53,218
But...

279
00:15:54,427 --> 00:15:57,679
It's hard giving another chance, Jay.
Especially when...

280
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,348
You know.
Your trust has been broken.

281
00:15:59,349 --> 00:16:00,892
Yeah. I get where you're coming from.

282
00:16:01,935 --> 00:16:02,935
Jay...

283
00:16:03,561 --> 00:16:06,523
Do you think I should give
him another chance?

284
00:16:14,489 --> 00:16:15,948
What's your plan for tomorrow?

285
00:16:15,949 --> 00:16:19,035
I'm sure those Section D-emons
will come back for you.

286
00:16:19,369 --> 00:16:21,412
Don't worry. Ella's gonna
be at school tomorrow.

287
00:16:22,288 --> 00:16:25,583
I'm sure she has no idea
what Aries did to me.

288
00:16:28,294 --> 00:16:29,629
Do you plan to tell her?

289
00:16:30,004 --> 00:16:30,880
No.

290
00:16:31,005 --> 00:16:33,507
Besides, I don't want them
to fight because of me.

291
00:16:33,508 --> 00:16:36,761
Ella has enough problems.
I don't wanna add to it.

292
00:16:39,931 --> 00:16:42,058
Don't worry. I'm also here for you.

293
00:16:45,645 --> 00:16:46,854
Thank you, Jay.

294
00:16:48,398 --> 00:16:50,315
Let's go. I'll walk you home.

295
00:16:50,316 --> 00:16:51,316
Alright.

296
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:53,277
Let's go.

297
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,550
Wait... why are we
walking home again?

298
00:16:56,614 --> 00:16:57,614
So tiring.

299
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,327
But you need this so you can give
yourself time to think, you know.

300
00:17:02,328 --> 00:17:04,330
You went through so much today.

301
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:06,081
Have you thought things through?

302
00:17:06,082 --> 00:17:07,292
Yeah... A little bit.

303
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,127
I hope your heart and mind
are now at ease.

304
00:17:14,632 --> 00:17:15,632
Aries!

305
00:17:15,967 --> 00:17:16,967
What?

306
00:17:17,468 --> 00:17:20,013
Aries. I'll get straight to the point.

307
00:17:20,388 --> 00:17:23,182
Will you stop Section
D from attacking Mica?

308
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:25,184
I know you were the one
who told them to do it.

309
00:17:25,268 --> 00:17:27,477
- Let's talk about that next time.
- No, no.

310
00:17:27,478 --> 00:17:29,062
Let's talk about it now!

311
00:17:29,063 --> 00:17:30,480
Why are you so pushy?

312
00:17:30,481 --> 00:17:32,358
You want Angelo to see us fighting?

313
00:17:32,734 --> 00:17:35,569
Well, I should be pushy.
Stop bullying Mica.

314
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:37,529
I'm sure she's not the one
who said Ella was a whore.

315
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:38,823
It was another person.

316
00:17:39,824 --> 00:17:42,327
Jay-jay, I don't care who said it.

317
00:17:42,577 --> 00:17:46,331
Mica was still there. And she let
those girls bad mouth her friend.

318
00:17:46,998 --> 00:17:49,292
Knowing Mica, do you think
she can argue with Freya?

319
00:17:50,126 --> 00:17:52,337
Why is Mica getting bullied by Section D?

320
00:17:52,712 --> 00:17:54,631
What did Section D do to Mica?

321
00:17:57,634 --> 00:17:58,634
Ella...

322
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,180
Ella!

323
00:18:03,598 --> 00:18:04,598
Ella!

324
00:18:04,682 --> 00:18:05,725
I can explain.

325
00:18:12,023 --> 00:18:13,441
You're awake today, bro!

326
00:18:15,276 --> 00:18:16,276
Why isn't she here yet?

327
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:19,405
Maybe because you
kicked them out yesterday.

328
00:18:19,697 --> 00:18:21,115
I only asked Mica to leave.

329
00:18:21,824 --> 00:18:23,283
You know how Jay-jay is.

330
00:18:23,284 --> 00:18:25,870
Do you think she can
just leave Mica alone?

331
00:18:29,499 --> 00:18:30,499
[Jay-jay exhales]

332
00:18:32,335 --> 00:18:33,877
- Speaking of.
- Good thing I'm not late.

333
00:18:33,878 --> 00:18:35,462
My bike was transfered
to the parking lot.

334
00:18:35,463 --> 00:18:36,673
- Really?
- Yeah.

335
00:18:40,343 --> 00:18:42,219
Hi, baby!

336
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,263
Hello, baby!

337
00:18:45,056 --> 00:18:46,556
You think that's funny?

338
00:18:46,557 --> 00:18:47,642
Of course.

339
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:50,895
Baby, baby, baby.

340
00:18:55,358 --> 00:18:58,276
Hi, David... baby.

[Ci-N and Jay-jay chuckling together]

343
00:19:10,081 --> 00:19:11,874
Hi, Felix...

344
00:19:15,211 --> 00:19:16,211
Me!

345
00:19:23,052 --> 00:19:24,720
Maybe you wanna call me baby as well?

346
00:19:24,721 --> 00:19:25,346
Yeah, bro!

347
00:19:25,347 --> 00:19:28,224
[boys cheering]

348
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,600
Baby your face!

349
00:19:30,601 --> 00:19:31,601
My face?

350
00:19:32,478 --> 00:19:33,438
Handsome.

351
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:35,273
[boys cheering]

352
00:19:36,482 --> 00:19:38,106
Yes, but...

353
00:19:38,151 --> 00:19:39,902
Yes means no! In your dreams!

354
00:19:42,238 --> 00:19:43,238
Alright.

355
00:19:44,157 --> 00:19:45,324
That's what you said.

356
00:19:46,242 --> 00:19:47,242
Really.

357
00:19:54,917 --> 00:19:56,085
Progress, right?

358
00:19:56,753 --> 00:19:57,753
Right.

359
00:20:00,757 --> 00:20:01,757
Jay-jay.

360
00:20:12,435 --> 00:20:14,395
You guys don't have
a teacher yet, right?

361
00:20:15,396 --> 00:20:16,731
Can I talk to you?

362
00:20:28,034 --> 00:20:29,034
Let's go.

363
00:20:39,337 --> 00:20:41,130
Go on, tell me.
No one followed us.

364
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:44,842
Jay... I just wanna thank you.

365
00:20:45,051 --> 00:20:46,051
For helping Mica.

366
00:20:47,345 --> 00:20:48,471
No worries.

367
00:20:48,805 --> 00:20:51,099
Those Section D-emons
are such a pain, right?

368
00:20:52,683 --> 00:20:54,519
And... I talked to Aries.

369
00:20:56,896 --> 00:20:59,482
So... he's not gonna punish me?

370
00:21:00,316 --> 00:21:01,316
No.

371
00:21:03,778 --> 00:21:04,904
Umm, Jay...

372
00:21:06,739 --> 00:21:08,574
I just wanted to ask you a favor.

373
00:21:08,699 --> 00:21:09,699
Sure.

374
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:11,159
Uhm...

375
00:21:12,078 --> 00:21:15,915
I hope you keep on helping Mica
whenever I'm not around.

376
00:21:16,165 --> 00:21:17,208
Of course.

377
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:18,959
And I hope...

378
00:21:20,253 --> 00:21:22,630
I hope you keep Calix away from Mica.

379
00:21:25,341 --> 00:21:26,341
Why?

380
00:21:27,426 --> 00:21:28,886
Cause she was so hurt.

381
00:21:29,178 --> 00:21:30,887
She was so devastated.

382
00:21:30,888 --> 00:21:34,015
I can't bear to see my friend
go through that pain again.

383
00:21:34,016 --> 00:21:35,309
Not with Calix.

384
00:21:36,644 --> 00:21:38,271
But she's almost moved on.

385
00:21:39,313 --> 00:21:42,859
So, I hope you can help keep
Calix away from Mica, please?

386
00:21:45,862 --> 00:21:47,070
But...

387
00:21:47,071 --> 00:21:50,241
if Mica wants to talk to him...

388
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:51,868
I won't stop her.

389
00:21:53,369 --> 00:21:56,956
I don't think it's right to interfere
with what Mica wants to do.

390
00:22:00,167 --> 00:22:01,210
Jay.

391
00:22:02,295 --> 00:22:04,130
Please, I'm begging you.

392
00:22:04,422 --> 00:22:06,798
I hope you do me this favor, please.

393
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,010
Please, do my favor.

394
00:22:10,636 --> 00:22:11,636
Uhh...

395
00:22:13,389 --> 00:22:15,266
I can do your first favor.

396
00:22:16,267 --> 00:22:17,643
But the second one...

397
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:19,854
I can't promise that.

398
00:22:20,938 --> 00:22:25,234
If Mica says she's ready to talk to Calix,
we should let her be.

399
00:22:25,735 --> 00:22:28,295
Because who knows, maybe that's where
she'll find closure, right?

400
00:22:30,865 --> 00:22:35,453
Okay. If that's what you think
what's best for Mica.

401
00:22:40,207 --> 00:22:41,334
Thank you, Jay.

402
00:22:57,308 --> 00:22:58,684
Jay, what did you talk about?

403
00:22:59,143 --> 00:23:00,143
Ah.

404
00:23:00,227 --> 00:23:02,730
She just thanked me
for helping Mica, and...

405
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:05,900
She asked for a favor.

406
00:23:06,817 --> 00:23:07,817
What favor?

407
00:23:10,821 --> 00:23:13,991
Hey, guys. The teacher said
we should answer these.

408
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:15,909
[boys groaning]

409
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:17,203
Damn it!

410
00:23:18,955 --> 00:23:21,624
Oh, right. The periodical exam's
just around the corner.

411
00:23:23,292 --> 00:23:26,462
Yeah... Another addition
to Section E's shame.

412
00:23:27,171 --> 00:23:28,171
Shame?

413
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:32,509
When the periodical
exam grades come out,

414
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:35,136
they post the results at the Main Building.

415
00:23:35,137 --> 00:23:36,138
What?

416
00:23:36,389 --> 00:23:37,640
For what reason?

417
00:23:38,307 --> 00:23:40,351
To motivate the students
to study, supposedly.

418
00:23:43,562 --> 00:23:44,397
Shit!

419
00:23:44,563 --> 00:23:45,814
No! No! No!

420
00:23:45,815 --> 00:23:46,982
What happened to him?

421
00:23:46,983 --> 00:23:47,942
Follow Calix!

422
00:23:47,942 --> 00:23:48,526
Dude!

423
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:50,152
[boys muttering]

424
00:23:52,405 --> 00:23:53,655
Calix!

425
00:23:53,656 --> 00:23:54,782
Come back here!

426
00:23:55,324 --> 00:23:56,117
Calix!

427
00:23:56,325 --> 00:23:59,370
Mica, since the day we met...

428
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,205
It was love at first sight.

429
00:24:02,206 --> 00:24:03,206
Move over!

430
00:24:03,207 --> 00:24:04,458
I really like you, Mica.

431
00:24:05,209 --> 00:24:07,670
I would go through
hell and back for you.

432
00:24:08,713 --> 00:24:09,713
So...

433
00:24:10,172 --> 00:24:12,049
I only have one question for you.

434
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,552
- Mica.
- Can you be my girlfriend?

435
00:24:15,553 --> 00:24:16,887
Forever!

436
00:24:17,513 --> 00:24:19,931
- Answer him!
- Yeah!

437
00:24:19,932 --> 00:24:21,684
Mykel is so handsome!

438
00:24:22,977 --> 00:24:23,977
Mica.

439
00:24:30,651 --> 00:24:32,278
Are you going to meddle again?

440
00:24:34,989 --> 00:24:36,032
Mica.

441
00:24:37,491 --> 00:24:38,993
Is this really what you want?

442
00:24:39,243 --> 00:24:40,536
Will you shut up?

443
00:24:41,537 --> 00:24:42,746
Is this really it?

444
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:45,207
Aren't you being dictated upon
or put under pressure?

445
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,960
Jay-jay.

446
00:24:49,545 --> 00:24:52,298
Stop it. Mica doesn't love Calix.

447
00:24:53,424 --> 00:24:54,008
Jay-jay.

448
00:24:54,383 --> 00:24:55,634
Stay out of this.

449
00:24:56,927 --> 00:24:58,012
Mica?

450
00:24:58,554 --> 00:24:59,971
- Can you be my girlfriend?
- Mica!

451
00:24:59,972 --> 00:25:02,807
Think really hard about it.
Who do you really love?

452
00:25:02,808 --> 00:25:04,350
- Think about it!
- Hey! Fuck!

453
00:25:04,351 --> 00:25:04,935
Think...

454
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:06,352
- Hey! What's your problem?!
- What the...

455
00:25:06,353 --> 00:25:07,438
Hey, asshole!

456
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,439
Hey! Stop it right there!

457
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,524
You're seriously choosing
that asshole over Calix?

458
00:25:11,525 --> 00:25:12,942
- She hurts women.
- That's right.

459
00:25:12,943 --> 00:25:13,819
This is ridiculous.

460
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,404
Go on. Do your thing.

461
00:25:16,947 --> 00:25:17,947
Mica.

462
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,259
Mica... I know...

463
00:25:38,719 --> 00:25:40,429
I know I caused you a lot of pain.

464
00:25:45,434 --> 00:25:48,937
But I hope you can give me a chance
to talk to you even for a while.

465
00:25:48,938 --> 00:25:51,816
Even five, ten, twenty minutes.

466
00:25:58,447 --> 00:26:00,866
I just want to tell you
how much I love you.

467
00:26:03,536 --> 00:26:04,954
I hope you can consider.

468
00:26:07,373 --> 00:26:08,707
Promise, I'll stop bugging you.

469
00:26:18,968 --> 00:26:20,427
- No.
- Don't

470
00:26:32,273 --> 00:26:33,524
Fine.

471
00:26:35,276 --> 00:26:36,694
But not here.

472
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:39,363
[boys cheering]

473
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,573
Show's over.

474
00:26:41,275 --> 00:26:43,569
- Time to change the channel, losers.
- Whatever!

475
00:26:44,952 --> 00:26:45,952
Loser!

476
00:26:49,623 --> 00:26:50,623
Fuck.

477
00:26:52,293 --> 00:26:54,127
Good job, Meddler.

478
00:26:54,128 --> 00:26:55,546
Turned out good, right?

479
00:27:05,639 --> 00:27:07,183
The letter!

480
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:14,231
Calix.

481
00:27:17,318 --> 00:27:18,694
Can I sit with you?

482
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:30,039
Actually, I owe you an explanation.

483
00:27:31,957 --> 00:27:35,711
It's been a while since I stumbled upon
this. I just didn't want to meddle, really.

484
00:27:36,378 --> 00:27:38,588
But when I saw what happened earlier,

485
00:27:38,589 --> 00:27:41,133
I realized how important it is...

486
00:27:43,469 --> 00:27:44,970
for you to read this.

487
00:27:49,892 --> 00:27:51,644
Sorry... I already opened it.

488
00:28:05,699 --> 00:28:08,285
Dear Calix, happy monthsary.

489
00:28:08,619 --> 00:28:12,122
Forgive me if this is the only thing
I can do for our monthsary.

490
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:14,916
I'm already saving up for
those shoes you wanted.

491
00:28:14,917 --> 00:28:18,796
And I promise, that's what I'm
giving you for your birthday.

492
00:28:19,171 --> 00:28:23,132
I wanted to say this in person but
I somehow feel uncomfortable

493
00:28:23,133 --> 00:28:26,679
because you always seem angry,
so I decided to write to you instead.

494
00:28:27,137 --> 00:28:32,601
Calix, I want to thank you for choosing
me out of all the girls chasing you.

495
00:28:32,935 --> 00:28:35,854
Even if our relationship is a secret,
I am truly very happy.

496
00:28:36,272 --> 00:28:40,149
Don't worry. I don't believe the rumors.

497
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:43,570
That you have another girlfriend
and that you are a playboy.

498
00:28:43,779 --> 00:28:46,991
I love you very much
and I trust you with my heart.

499
00:28:47,658 --> 00:28:50,785
Honestly, sometimes I get a little
mad at you because...

500
00:28:50,786 --> 00:28:54,581
we rarely see each other,
but still you choose to ignore me.

501
00:28:54,748 --> 00:28:57,375
Happy monthsary. I love you.

502
00:28:57,376 --> 00:28:58,961
Love, Mica.

503
00:29:16,312 --> 00:29:17,646
I'm such a jerk.

504
00:29:19,273 --> 00:29:20,691
But I regretted it all.

505
00:29:21,692 --> 00:29:23,193
You know what, Jay?

506
00:29:25,571 --> 00:29:27,489
I am willing to change for her.

507
00:29:29,074 --> 00:29:31,910
But I just don't know how to tell her
how much I love her.

508
00:29:42,504 --> 00:29:44,089
I'm so stupid!

509
00:29:45,466 --> 00:29:46,966
I'm such a jerk!

510
00:29:46,967 --> 00:29:47,967
Hey.

511
00:29:48,719 --> 00:29:50,888
I'm horrible...

512
00:29:51,388 --> 00:29:53,390
Hey... get a hold of yourself!

513
00:29:53,766 --> 00:29:55,267
Will you calm down?

514
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:57,978
Can't you read?

515
00:29:58,771 --> 00:29:59,813
Look at this.

516
00:30:00,189 --> 00:30:01,230
Look at what it says.

517
00:30:01,231 --> 00:30:02,900
P.S. Read it.

518
00:30:03,317 --> 00:30:08,238
"Just shout your love for me,
and all the bad will go away."

519
00:30:08,781 --> 00:30:09,781
Oh?

520
00:30:17,539 --> 00:30:18,539
See?

521
00:30:19,708 --> 00:30:20,626
That's it, Jay.

522
00:30:20,626 --> 00:30:21,626
Here.

523
00:30:22,336 --> 00:30:23,670
- I'll go ahead!
- Oh...

524
00:30:24,755 --> 00:30:26,256
Mica!

525
00:30:27,716 --> 00:30:30,969
Oh my, I did it again.

526
00:30:31,303 --> 00:30:33,180
You're so good, Jay-jay.

527
00:30:33,764 --> 00:30:35,599
Very good. Very good.

528
00:30:37,017 --> 00:30:38,185
Meddler.

529
00:30:41,814 --> 00:30:43,065
You've been there all along?

530
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:46,652
You love gossip, huh?

531
00:30:47,361 --> 00:30:48,361
Do you own this place?

532
00:30:48,362 --> 00:30:49,905
[Jay-jay mocking]

533
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:50,989
Tss.

534
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:53,909
If you get into fights,
you'll call on me again.

535
00:30:54,243 --> 00:30:56,578
Excuse me. You butted in yourself,
I didn't call for you.

536
00:30:56,995 --> 00:30:59,248
"Just shout your love for me,"

537
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,250
"and all the bad will go away."

538
00:31:01,959 --> 00:31:03,919
You even read the letter
before Calix, huh?

539
00:31:06,255 --> 00:31:07,339
I'll be leaving now.

540
00:31:07,714 --> 00:31:08,714
Wait!

541
00:31:09,425 --> 00:31:11,385
How's Calix?
What's gonna happen?

542
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:14,221
Mica and him are going to talk.
Just let them be.

543
00:31:14,972 --> 00:31:15,972
Where?

544
00:31:16,765 --> 00:31:18,165
Most likely at their meeting place.

545
00:31:20,269 --> 00:31:21,269
We gotta go.

546
00:31:22,521 --> 00:31:23,564
Oh.

547
00:31:24,314 --> 00:31:26,191
Who's the Meddler now, huh?

Stop it, stop it! Shh!

727
00:41:28,168 --> 00:41:31,421
Somebody could
hear you again. Stop it.

728
00:41:34,883 --> 00:41:37,051
What's the purpose of that?
Why do you need to show me that?

729
00:41:37,052 --> 00:41:38,094
Proof!

730
00:41:38,344 --> 00:41:40,554
That Mica never called Ella a whore.

731
00:41:40,555 --> 00:41:42,974
And to add to that.
She said it again.

732
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:44,893
What do you want me to do?

733
00:41:46,227 --> 00:41:47,312
Leave Mica alone.

734
00:41:47,645 --> 00:41:48,645
Done.

735
00:41:49,397 --> 00:41:50,647
Hey, wait up!

736
00:41:50,648 --> 00:41:51,857
What do you want now?

737
00:41:51,858 --> 00:41:54,401
Aren't you gonna
punish Freya for this?

738
00:41:54,402 --> 00:41:56,154
She needs to be taught a lesson.

739
00:41:56,446 --> 00:41:57,446
That's it.

740
00:41:57,906 --> 00:41:59,866
You just want to
get back at Freya. Right?

741
00:42:00,492 --> 00:42:01,492
Huh?

742
00:42:01,951 --> 00:42:02,619
But...

743
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:05,622
You're trying to use me
for your revenge against Freya.

744
00:42:06,623 --> 00:42:10,001
You want me to get mad at Freya, that's
why you had me watch the video. Correct?

745
00:42:10,376 --> 00:42:11,419
That's not true!

746
00:42:13,963 --> 00:42:17,008
Cause if that's what you want,
then I'm not gonna punish Freya.

747
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:20,804
And don't ever... ever try to
use me again. Okay?

748
00:42:40,448 --> 00:42:43,201
If Calix and Mica
got their second chance...

749
00:42:43,785 --> 00:42:47,747
is it possible for me and Aries
to fix our relationship as well?

750
00:42:51,918 --> 00:42:53,461
Hey. Miss.

751
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:04,931
Do you need anything?

752
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:07,224
Umm... yeah.

753
00:43:07,225 --> 00:43:08,642
I'm actually lost.

754
00:43:08,643 --> 00:43:11,563
You know where Eastwood Street is?

755
00:43:12,272 --> 00:43:13,480
Ahhh...

756
00:43:13,481 --> 00:43:15,316
This might put me in a pickle.

757
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:16,901
Ehem...

758
00:43:18,903 --> 00:43:20,155
You go straight.

759
00:43:20,864 --> 00:43:22,115
Then you turn right.

760
00:43:22,782 --> 00:43:27,745
Then you go round and round, then
after three corners, you see the guard.

761
00:43:27,954 --> 00:43:30,248
Then you ask the guard, "Guard, where's..."

762
00:43:30,707 --> 00:43:31,666
What's the..?

763
00:43:31,666 --> 00:43:32,625
Eastwood Street.

764
00:43:32,626 --> 00:43:34,878
"Guard, where is Eastwood Street?"

765
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:35,712
Uh-huh.

766
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:37,088
Then you'll know the answer.

767
00:43:41,676 --> 00:43:42,676
Okay.

768
00:43:44,429 --> 00:43:45,305
Wait...

769
00:43:45,306 --> 00:43:46,598
I forgot to ask your name.

770
00:43:48,349 --> 00:43:50,059
I'm Jasper Jean...

771
00:44:08,912 --> 00:44:10,038
Who were you talking to?

772
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:12,415
I don't know. He just asked
for directions.

773
00:44:12,749 --> 00:44:13,917
Do you have a hanky?

774
00:44:14,083 --> 00:44:15,167
No, why?

775
00:44:15,168 --> 00:44:18,129
I think my nose is bleeding.
He spoke with an American accent.

776
00:44:19,964 --> 00:44:20,798
Get off!

777
00:44:20,798 --> 00:44:21,549
Huh, why?

778
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:22,634
Just get off!

779
00:44:25,512 --> 00:44:26,888
Hey! Hey, wait!

780
00:44:27,931 --> 00:44:30,934
Oh, that's how you wanna play.
You ride that bike, I'll ride this!

781
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:32,310
Sir, let's go.

782
00:44:32,727 --> 00:44:33,727
Follow him.

783
00:44:36,522 --> 00:44:37,774
This is fun.

784
00:44:48,576 --> 00:44:49,619
And down.

785
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:51,620
Hey, Yuri!

786
00:44:52,705 --> 00:44:54,581
You already got back at me.
Don't push your luck.

787
00:44:54,582 --> 00:44:56,742
It was not enough.
Let's even it out on the other side!

788
00:44:56,834 --> 00:44:57,918
I love you, my David.

789
00:44:57,919 --> 00:44:59,587
- I love you too. Bye.
- So troublesome.

790
00:45:00,713 --> 00:45:01,589
Oh?

791
00:45:01,714 --> 00:45:02,799
You have a girlfriend?

792
00:45:03,883 --> 00:45:04,883
That's right.

793
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:07,887
So you're a Casanova too, huh?

794
00:45:08,179 --> 00:45:10,180
Wait, dude. I have to go pee.
Just a minute.

795
00:45:10,181 --> 00:45:11,181
Sure.

796
00:45:11,641 --> 00:45:12,849
Is it okay not to stretch?

797
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:14,811
- Yeah.
- My body is already in pain.

Keif.

799
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:24,362
I think I saw Percy.

800
00:45:24,946 --> 00:45:27,115
Let him rest in peace, Yuri.

801
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:30,159
Guys! Miss Asunta is here!

802
00:45:30,368 --> 00:45:32,411
- Good morning, ma'am.
- Good morning!

803
00:45:32,412 --> 00:45:36,291
Section E, what's up?
Have you guys stretched?

804
00:45:36,666 --> 00:45:38,000
Yes, Ma'am.

805
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:39,001
That's good.

806
00:45:39,043 --> 00:45:41,753
We're gonna do a 500-meter run today.

807
00:45:41,754 --> 00:45:42,754
It's your warm-up.

808
00:45:43,131 --> 00:45:47,718
When I come back, make sure your
bodies are already conditioned to run.

809
00:45:47,719 --> 00:45:49,554
- Are we okay with that?
- Yes!

810
00:45:49,762 --> 00:45:51,764
Good. See you later.

811
00:45:52,932 --> 00:45:53,933
Sir John!

812
00:45:54,434 --> 00:45:55,434
Yes?

813
00:45:55,643 --> 00:45:57,520
We're summoned to the Principal's Office.

814
00:45:57,687 --> 00:46:00,648
Alright, coming.
Freya, take the lead.

815

- Catch me!
- Hey, kid! Give it back!

820

Damn it, give it here!

Hey! Move over,
out of the way!

quick enough, Jay-jay!

- She's done for.
- Damn, dude.

830
00:46:42,398 --> 00:46:43,649
You made a bad mistake.

831
00:46:43,733 --> 00:46:45,026
A lover's quarrel is coming!

832
00:46:45,401 --> 00:46:47,195
- What happened?
- What's wrong with him?

833
00:46:47,904 --> 00:46:50,197
- Yuri, calm him down.
- He's gonna be mad again.

834

- How much do you wanna bet?
- Five thousand.

It was your fault!

No, I didn't!

855
00:48:00,476 --> 00:48:02,228
Jay-jay! Is there a problem?

856
