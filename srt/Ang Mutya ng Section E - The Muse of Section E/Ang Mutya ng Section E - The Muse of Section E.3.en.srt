1
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:18,350
You can't run away
just because you can't stand...

2
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:19,018
Jay-jay!

3
00:00:19,043 --> 00:00:20,169
Good evening, Aries.

4
00:00:21,717 --> 00:00:24,678
I know you're mad at me.
I just want to apologize for...

5
00:00:24,703 --> 00:00:25,662
Jay.

6
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:27,401
Your sorry won't change anything.

7
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:30,572
Jasper Jean Fernandez Mariano.

8
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:31,780
Fernandez?

9
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:33,950
Are you related to Aries Fernandez?

10
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:34,951
Yes.

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,320
How are you related to Aries?

12
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:37,746
We're cousins.

13
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:40,131
Guys, I got her school records.

14
00:00:40,298 --> 00:00:41,924
Stabbed a classmate with a pencil?

15
00:00:41,925 --> 00:00:45,052
I found out Aries' and Jay-jay's
mothers were half-sisters.

16
00:00:45,053 --> 00:00:47,556
She was taken in by Aries' mother.

17
00:00:47,722 --> 00:00:49,723
It's possible that she's
spying on us for Aries.

18
00:00:49,724 --> 00:00:52,226
It's time for the re-election!

19
00:00:52,227 --> 00:00:54,771
[boys cheering]

20
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:56,898
Yeah! Hit him again!

21
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:01,486
Keifer!

22
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,320
Mariano!

23
00:01:03,738 --> 00:01:05,198
You know how to receive a serve?

24
00:01:05,824 --> 00:01:07,534
Let's see if you can catch this!

25
00:01:11,496 --> 00:01:12,539
No more!

26
00:01:12,914 --> 00:01:13,623
Please stop!

27
00:01:13,623 --> 00:01:14,623
What happened here?!

28
00:01:21,339 --> 00:01:24,718
It's been a week.
It feels so nice to just lay here.

29
00:01:27,679 --> 00:01:29,889
Can I just drop out of school?

30
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:40,483
Jay-jay, this is too much.

31
00:01:41,151 --> 00:01:42,611
You need to get up.

32
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:48,073
Jay-jay.

33
00:01:50,035 --> 00:01:51,161
Are you feeling okay?

34
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:53,538
Eat up.

35
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,458
Auntie, I'm sorry for troubling you.

36
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:59,544
That's alright. I don't
want you getting hungry.

37
00:02:00,295 --> 00:02:01,295
Go ahead and eat.

38
00:02:02,672 --> 00:02:04,132
- Auntie…
- Yes?

39
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:07,552
Can I quit going to school now?

40
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:11,014
Is it because of your bullies?

41
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:14,475
Honestly, I don't like getting into fights.

42
00:02:14,476 --> 00:02:16,728
Besides, I promised I will change my ways.

43
00:02:17,062 --> 00:02:20,564
You know, Jay-jay, there are lots of ways
to fight your bullies.

44
00:02:20,565 --> 00:02:23,693
You don't need to resort
to fighting all the time.

45
00:02:24,861 --> 00:02:25,861
But…

46
00:02:26,655 --> 00:02:28,365
if you really have to…

47
00:02:29,324 --> 00:02:30,324
Go.

48
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:31,993
It's okay.

49
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:33,786
It's fine.

50
00:02:34,704 --> 00:02:36,538
It's really okay if
that's what you have to.

51
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:38,499
Are you sure? Is it really okay?

52
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,500
Yes!

53
00:02:40,043 --> 00:02:41,378
Just not too often, okay?

54
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:43,546
Promise?

55
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:46,340
I'll go ahead. You eat up.

56
00:02:46,341 --> 00:02:48,092
If you need anything, just call the maids.

57
00:02:48,093 --> 00:02:49,093
- Okay.
- Eat now, okay?

58
00:02:49,094 --> 00:02:50,095
Thank you.

59
00:02:50,428 --> 00:02:51,888
Auntie, do you swear?

60
00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:54,349
Slightly. Don't do it often.

61
00:03:00,438 --> 00:03:01,439
Ouch.

62
00:03:19,082 --> 00:03:21,376
Haven't you seen someone
with a broken nose before?

63
00:03:22,043 --> 00:03:23,043
Does it look funny?

64
00:03:24,754 --> 00:03:25,754
I better check it.

65
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:28,674
Boom!

66
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:30,217
- Ay! Shit!
- You should be more careful!

67
00:03:30,218 --> 00:03:32,011
What the hell! My nose!

68
00:03:33,096 --> 00:03:34,431
Your nose is so red!

69
00:03:35,432 --> 00:03:36,516
You look stupid!

70
00:03:37,058 --> 00:03:39,561
You better stop mocking me.
This was all your fault.

71
00:03:40,228 --> 00:03:41,521
Come with us.

72
00:03:41,813 --> 00:03:43,355
- I don't want to.
- Yeah, let's go.

73
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:45,024
- Come on, Jay. Go with us.
- I said no!

74
00:03:45,442 --> 00:03:47,609
- Don't make it difficult. Just come with us.
- I don't want to!

75
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,863
- Hey! Stop it!
- Just come with us!

76
00:03:53,116 --> 00:03:54,367
Come with me.

77
00:03:55,952 --> 00:03:59,038
No! Do you think I've forgotten
what you did to me?

78
00:03:59,581 --> 00:04:01,124
Tss! Childish!

79
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:04,002
Childish? I'm supposed to be
the childish one here?

80
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:06,795
What the heck! I'm going home!

81
00:04:06,796 --> 00:04:08,882
I swear, you're getting on my nerves!

82
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,258
You're being so annoying!

83
00:04:11,259 --> 00:04:12,051
Hey!

84
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:13,051
Sit.

85
00:04:13,136 --> 00:04:15,856
The nerve of you to tell me to "sit."
What do you think of me, a dog?

86
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:17,514
What do you need? I'm gonna go home.

87
00:04:17,515 --> 00:04:18,955
Is it difficult for you to sit down?

88
00:04:25,106 --> 00:04:26,274
Fine, I'll sit.

89
00:04:27,108 --> 00:04:29,110
Go sit down, guys. I'll pay for these.

90
00:04:30,195 --> 00:04:32,529
Go get what ever you like.
That one tastes good.

91
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:33,530
Hey, Kit!

92
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,201
Order for me.
Whatever's your specialty.

93
00:04:36,493 --> 00:04:37,660
Alright, bro. You got it.

94
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,996
So that's his name. Kit.

95
00:04:40,997 --> 00:04:43,415
Wait... "your specialty?"

96
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,585
Wow! They own this place?

97
00:04:46,044 --> 00:04:47,420
So rich.

98
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:56,137
Ouch! What the hell! That hurts!

99
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:58,096
It still hurts?

100
00:04:58,348 --> 00:04:59,432
Is that even a question!

101
00:04:59,682 --> 00:05:01,350
I'm getting really pissed at you!
This hurts a lot!

102
00:05:01,351 --> 00:05:03,019
I'm seriously asking you a question.

103
00:05:03,353 --> 00:05:05,855
You can see it. Why are you even
asking me? Are you blind?

104
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:09,233
It hurts! If I end up looking like
Voldemort, you should pay to fix my nose...

105
00:05:09,234 --> 00:05:10,234
Don't move.

106
00:05:27,418 --> 00:05:28,418
Hold still.

107
00:05:29,337 --> 00:05:30,463
Do it properly.

108
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,047
I'm really gonna get mad if you mess it up.

109
00:05:32,048 --> 00:05:33,048
Hold still.

110
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,034
Tss!

111
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,372
What are you rolling your eyes for?

112
00:06:08,543 --> 00:06:10,044
Here's your order.

113
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:12,714
Yogorino's popular Froyo with Strawberries.

114
00:06:14,215 --> 00:06:15,215
Thank you.

115
00:06:15,967 --> 00:06:16,967
This is for you.

116
00:06:18,094 --> 00:06:19,387
What is that, a bribe?

117
00:06:19,637 --> 00:06:22,599
If that's what you would like to call it,
then yeah. Fine.

118
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:24,182
That's a bribe.

119
00:06:25,727 --> 00:06:27,367
Do you think you can
appease me with that?

120
00:06:27,437 --> 00:06:28,437
Yeah.

121
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:29,898
It's every girl's weakness.

122
00:06:30,565 --> 00:06:31,149
No.

123
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,109
Not me. I don't even like that.

124
00:06:33,651 --> 00:06:34,652
What do you want?

125
00:06:36,613 --> 00:06:38,656
A simple sorry from "here."

126
00:06:39,782 --> 00:06:42,452
And an explanation
for why you did that to me.

127
00:06:42,994 --> 00:06:44,495
Apologizing is not my thing.

128
00:06:45,246 --> 00:06:46,372
So is explaining.

129
00:06:46,748 --> 00:06:48,833
Then we're just wasting our time here.

130
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:50,752
I'm going home.

131
00:06:56,257 --> 00:06:57,758
- What happened?
- I don't know what her problem is.

132
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,052
She's coming back.

133
00:06:59,677 --> 00:07:00,970
Let's not waste this.

134
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:03,014
She's taking her frozen yogurt.

135
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:35,106
Don't mind those assholes and fight back
only when provoked. Repeat.

136
00:08:35,231 --> 00:08:38,775
Don't mind those assholes and fight back
only when provoked. Repeat.

137
00:08:38,776 --> 00:08:39,444
Don't mind those assholes...

138
00:08:39,444 --> 00:08:40,444
Jay-jay!

139
00:08:41,738 --> 00:08:42,780
How's your nose?

140
00:08:43,406 --> 00:08:45,700
Yeah. I think my nose bridge
looks even better now.

141
00:08:45,867 --> 00:08:48,107
What did your mom say
when you went home with a red nose?

142
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:51,163
Nothing. We don't live together.

143
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:53,041
I'm staying at Aries' house.

144
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:56,335
Uhh.. Jay..

145
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:57,502
Yeah?

146
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,589
- Why?
- Are you scared of blood?

147
00:09:00,214 --> 00:09:03,301
Back there at the gym,
when you saw your blood, you froze.

148
00:09:04,093 --> 00:09:05,428
As if you transformed.

149
00:09:09,891 --> 00:09:10,891
Really?

150
00:09:12,727 --> 00:09:13,727
I can't remember.

151
00:09:14,729 --> 00:09:15,855
Is that possible?

152
00:09:16,314 --> 00:09:17,314
Of course.

153
00:09:17,732 --> 00:09:20,612
Can you remember all the things
you did 10 years ago? Every single thing?

154
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:21,819
No.

155
00:09:21,986 --> 00:09:22,986
See?

156
00:09:25,281 --> 00:09:27,033
But that was just last week.

157
00:09:28,451 --> 00:09:30,119
It's the same thing. Get over it.

158
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:33,289
Jay, are you going that way?

159
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:35,123
You know how the
people there are like.

160
00:09:35,124 --> 00:09:36,417
I know a shortcut. Let's go.

161
00:09:36,626 --> 00:09:38,086
It's all right. I'll go this way.

162
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,046
Wait a minute...

163
00:09:40,838 --> 00:09:42,278
Did you transfer to another section?

164
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:44,008
You're leaving me?

165
00:09:44,967 --> 00:09:46,009
You're so dramatic.

166
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:48,179
I'm just going to the restroom!

167
00:09:48,638 --> 00:09:49,889
Oh. Is that it?

168
00:09:50,306 --> 00:09:53,351
Then just use the boys' restroom
at Section E. It's just the same.

169
00:09:54,143 --> 00:09:55,645
- Ouch!
- You're so annoying.

170
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:58,189
Hold on, I have a question.

171
00:09:58,481 --> 00:09:59,065
Yeah?

172
00:09:59,482 --> 00:10:01,317
Why are you guys so afraid of Keifer?

173
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,197
Because... I owe him a lot.

174
00:10:06,489 --> 00:10:08,199
He did a lot of things for me.

175
00:10:08,866 --> 00:10:11,077
And besides, you know he's
so much bigger than I am.

176
00:10:11,869 --> 00:10:12,869
So tall...

177
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:16,457
Then you're weak. All of you.

178
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,127
Go ahead. You can go first to Section E.

179
00:10:19,627 --> 00:10:20,919
- Alright,
- Okay.

180
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,130
I'll go to the other restroom.
My tummy hurts.

181
00:10:23,131 --> 00:10:24,924
What's your deal, Keifer?

182
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:28,511
You'll get what's coming
for you one day! So irritating!

183
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,189
Mica!

184
00:10:40,481 --> 00:10:42,233
Why are you so quiet?

185
00:10:43,025 --> 00:10:45,319
Huh? Nothing.

186
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,948
It's because Calix approached her.

187
00:10:49,824 --> 00:10:50,824
Again?

188
00:10:51,701 --> 00:10:54,787
Anyway, I cannot believe Kiko.

189
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:57,706
Girl, he won't shut up
about that new transferee.

190
00:10:57,707 --> 00:10:58,748
That...

191
00:10:58,749 --> 00:11:00,376
Jay-jay something?

192
00:11:01,043 --> 00:11:02,170
Whatever.

193
00:11:02,378 --> 00:11:03,795
So annoying.

194
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:06,506
She's like... not even that pretty.

195
00:11:06,507 --> 00:11:08,384
- Yeah.
- True.

196
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:10,887
And... she's in Section E.

197
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:12,722
Girl, exactly.

198
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:14,849
I don't get what's so special about her.

199
00:11:15,099 --> 00:11:18,436
I heard she's Baby Aries' cousin.

200
00:11:18,603 --> 00:11:19,437
Shh!

201
00:11:19,438 --> 00:11:22,732
Don't call him Baby Aries.
Ella might hear you.

202
00:11:23,107 --> 00:11:24,275
Ella?

203
00:11:24,901 --> 00:11:25,942
The whore?

204
00:11:25,943 --> 00:11:26,944
Yeah.

205
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:29,739
Imagine getting all the guys.

206
00:11:30,031 --> 00:11:31,031
Keifer,

207
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:32,241
Yuri,

208
00:11:32,242 --> 00:11:33,451
And now, Aries.

209
00:11:34,035 --> 00:11:36,454
- Girl, she flirts with everyone.
- I know.

210
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:39,248
- Right, Mica?
- Huh?

211
00:11:39,957 --> 00:11:41,333
Why are you so quiet?

212
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:42,710
Yeah, what's up?

213
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,128
Nothing really.

214
00:11:44,754 --> 00:11:46,797
And also... Ella's not that bad.

215
00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:48,507
She's actually pretty nice.

216
00:11:48,716 --> 00:11:50,343
Girl, don't defend her.

217
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:53,887
You really like sympathizing
with people who are not on our level.

218
00:11:53,888 --> 00:11:54,555
Right.

219
00:11:54,722 --> 00:11:56,641
Just like with that Calix.

220
00:11:57,725 --> 00:12:00,228
But... Ella's already in Section A.

221
00:12:00,645 --> 00:12:02,563
Isn't she already on our level?

222
00:12:03,147 --> 00:12:04,690
Oh, please.

223
00:12:05,149 --> 00:12:08,527
Even if she made it to our section,
the fact remains.

224
00:12:08,986 --> 00:12:10,780
Once a Section E...

225
00:12:11,072 --> 00:12:13,324
Always a Section E.

226
00:12:13,824 --> 00:12:15,034
She's a whore.

227
00:12:15,993 --> 00:12:17,662
Just like that Jay-jay.

228
00:12:18,329 --> 00:12:20,372
For sure, she's also a flirt.

229
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:23,833
Yeah. A whore that's not even pretty.

230
00:12:23,834 --> 00:12:25,044
I agree.

231
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:35,304
Do you think she heard us?

232
00:12:38,182 --> 00:12:40,851
Are there no restrooms
in Section E's building?

233
00:12:44,272 --> 00:12:46,565
Why are you here?

234
00:12:47,942 --> 00:12:50,236
These girls' faces look like canvasses.

235
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:52,405
The paint is so thick.

236
00:12:54,198 --> 00:12:55,783
Who's the ugly one again?

237
00:13:06,335 --> 00:13:07,502
Oh, my God.

238
00:13:07,503 --> 00:13:08,838
Get back here, you freak!

239
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,550
Oh, my gosh.

240
00:13:13,676 --> 00:13:14,676
Oh, my god.

241
00:13:15,052 --> 00:13:16,721
Oh, my gosh.

242
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:19,849
This is not it!

243
00:13:21,017 --> 00:13:22,893
David! Get up from there!

244
00:13:23,311 --> 00:13:24,812
Sit down, sit down.

245
00:13:25,187 --> 00:13:25,980
Raise your arms up.

246
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:26,980
What are you doing?

247
00:13:27,148 --> 00:13:28,190
Just hold still.

248
00:13:30,735 --> 00:13:32,069
Wanna hear some spoilers, bro?

249
00:13:33,863 --> 00:13:35,114
What did you do?

250
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,740
Shhh.

251
00:13:41,871 --> 00:13:45,166
Where is that freak, Jay-jay?

252
00:13:45,499 --> 00:13:48,002
- Hi, Freya!
- Tell her to come out!

253
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:51,047
[boys indistinct chatter]

254
00:13:51,672 --> 00:13:53,049
I said, tell her to come out!

255
00:13:53,257 --> 00:13:54,300
Where is she?

256
00:13:56,177 --> 00:13:57,511
I said, where is she?

257
00:13:58,179 --> 00:13:59,179
Welcome back.

258
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,431
Now face your mess.

259
00:14:02,099 --> 00:14:05,060
You freak! Get your ass over here!

260
00:14:05,061 --> 00:14:05,644
Ouch!

261
00:14:05,936 --> 00:14:06,896
You think you're so brave, huh?

262
00:14:06,897 --> 00:14:08,105
So cocky.

263
00:14:10,524 --> 00:14:11,941
That hurts! Stop it!

264
00:14:11,942 --> 00:14:15,029
You have the nerve to fight? Come here!

265
00:14:18,574 --> 00:14:20,868
- Stop dragging me!
- You're still going to run, huh!

266
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:22,327
Stay here!

267
00:14:25,373 --> 00:14:28,793
You... you're so full of yourself.

268
00:14:29,293 --> 00:14:30,419
You're too much.

269
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:34,298
I just splashed your faces with water
to tone down all that make-up.

270
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:35,633
How dare you?

271
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:37,343
That hurts!

272
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:40,679
You're gonna get hurt even worse later.

273
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:42,847
Everyone!

274
00:14:43,933 --> 00:14:45,643
This girl right here...

275
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:49,855
I was harassed in the restroom.

276
00:14:50,231 --> 00:14:54,318
Me. The Freya Hidalgo.

277
00:14:54,568 --> 00:14:56,737
- The nerve this girl has.
- Ouch!

278
00:14:57,613 --> 00:14:58,322
What?

279
00:14:58,323 --> 00:15:00,825
Serves you right because
you didn't show us respect.

280
00:15:01,283 --> 00:15:03,369
That's right. Don't you know who we are?

281
00:15:03,577 --> 00:15:04,161
No!

282
00:15:04,328 --> 00:15:05,328
Huh!

283
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:14,922
And that's why you have the audacity
to harass us. To harass me!

284
00:15:15,131 --> 00:15:17,466
The Queen Bee of Section A.

285
00:15:18,092 --> 00:15:19,218
You're from Section A?

286
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:20,594
Doesn't look like it.

287
00:15:21,637 --> 00:15:22,804
Can we go back inside the room?

288
00:15:22,805 --> 00:15:23,805
Not yet!

289
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:25,641
You stay here.

290
00:15:26,016 --> 00:15:27,184
You should be punished.

291
00:15:27,435 --> 00:15:29,144
You disrespected the Queen Bee.

292
00:15:29,145 --> 00:15:30,563
Aren't you too big to be a bee?

293
00:15:35,109 --> 00:15:38,028
Freya. Before you punish her,
I think there's something you should know.

294
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:40,238
And so?

295
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:41,991
Please enlighten me.

296
00:15:42,116 --> 00:15:43,701
She's just a mere transferee.

297
00:15:44,493 --> 00:15:45,619
She's my cousin.

298
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:55,379
But that doesn't mean she has immunity
against whatever you want to do with her.

299
00:15:59,618 --> 00:16:01,745
Wow! Just wow!

300
00:16:05,181 --> 00:16:06,307
OMG!

301
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,641
OMG!

302
00:16:08,017 --> 00:16:09,310
Did you see that, girls?

303
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:12,104
Even if she's Aries' cousin...

304
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:14,148
It's still no use.

305
00:16:15,483 --> 00:16:17,443
Okay, look... freak.

306
00:16:18,861 --> 00:16:22,907
Since we've already gathered here,
I'm gonna teach you a lesson.

307
00:16:23,824 --> 00:16:26,660
How about a small orientation?

308
00:16:29,205 --> 00:16:33,334
This is HVIS' heirarchy.
We have a system here.

309
00:16:33,918 --> 00:16:35,669
The first thing you should know.

310
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:38,714
Section A is the royalty section.

311
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:44,595
We rule this school.
Because we're the best at everything.

312
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:47,223
That's why disrespecting us...

313
00:16:48,182 --> 00:16:50,726
is a big mistake.

314
00:16:53,229 --> 00:16:54,605
What is she talking about?

315
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:57,608
Section B...

316
00:16:58,359 --> 00:16:59,776
They're good, but...

317
00:16:59,777 --> 00:17:01,110
not that good.

318
00:17:01,111 --> 00:17:02,320
You can say...

319
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:04,240
they make it up with diligence.

320
00:17:04,657 --> 00:17:07,243
But cross them... and you're dead.

321
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:10,746
Section C...

322
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:15,459
They're known for their kindness,
but treat them like a bitch...

323
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:17,378
And they'll give you hell.

324
00:17:18,879 --> 00:17:20,047
Section D...

325
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:26,971
They're kinda like your section,
but their lives still have direction.

326
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,140
And... they're our slaves.

327
00:17:30,808 --> 00:17:32,393
Whatever we say...

328
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:33,936
They will do.

329
00:17:34,728 --> 00:17:37,982
And of course... last and definitely...

330
00:17:38,482 --> 00:17:39,482
The least.

331
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:40,692
Section E.

332
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:42,945
That's you.

333
00:17:43,487 --> 00:17:46,866
The dirt of HVIS.

334
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,537
I mean no one cares about you,
not even the school board.

335
00:17:53,455 --> 00:17:55,124
Useless.

336
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,085
Worthless.

337
00:17:58,669 --> 00:18:00,712
That's where you belong.

338
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:01,797
Shhhhh!

339
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:03,382
You're too noisy!

340
00:18:04,008 --> 00:18:05,050
Are you done?

341
00:18:05,342 --> 00:18:09,013
You talk too much. You even stood up there
when you can just say it here.

342
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:11,055
Oh?

343
00:18:12,641 --> 00:18:15,436
You know what? Such a
waste of time. Oh, well...

344
00:18:16,353 --> 00:18:18,022
Since I am pretty good-hearted.

345
00:18:18,814 --> 00:18:19,940
I'll let you go.

346
00:18:20,774 --> 00:18:21,774
If...

347
00:18:23,027 --> 00:18:25,154
You kneel before me.

348
00:18:25,863 --> 00:18:27,197
And say sorry.

349
00:18:27,656 --> 00:18:30,533
And then you're gonna
kiss my ruby red shoes.

350
00:18:30,534 --> 00:18:31,619
Freya, enough!

351
00:18:33,454 --> 00:18:34,663
What are you waiting for?

352
00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:36,539
Kneel.

353
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,882
In your dreams!

354
00:18:45,341 --> 00:18:47,661
Why would I kneel when it's you
who started badmouthing me?

355
00:18:48,344 --> 00:18:53,515
Ahh... why don't you tell everyone here the
things you were saying in the rest room?

356
00:18:54,391 --> 00:18:57,269
What did you say again about...

357
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:00,648
About Ella?

358
00:19:06,195 --> 00:19:07,904
Stop lying, you freak!

359
00:19:07,905 --> 00:19:11,574
Didn't you say Ella's a whore who flirts
with everyone? You said that, right?

360
00:19:11,575 --> 00:19:13,284
- What is she saying?
- You said that.

361
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:14,494
You're making up stories.

362
00:19:14,495 --> 00:19:15,495
Is that true?

363
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:19,541
You called Ella a whore?

364
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,795
That wasn't me, Aries!

365
00:19:23,504 --> 00:19:26,255
Jay-jay didn't even see who said it.

366
00:19:26,256 --> 00:19:27,341
Exactly!

367
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:30,219
You were inside the cubicle
when somebody said that.

368
00:19:31,261 --> 00:19:33,430
If it wasn't you, then who?!

369
00:19:34,348 --> 00:19:35,432
Who?!

370
00:19:36,934 --> 00:19:38,018
It was Mica.

371
00:19:39,186 --> 00:19:40,687
- Mica said it.
- That's right.

372
00:19:40,688 --> 00:19:41,772
That was her!

373
00:19:42,022 --> 00:19:43,273
It was you!

374
00:19:44,733 --> 00:19:45,733
You said that?

375
00:19:45,734 --> 00:19:46,734
No.

376
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,278
It was really her, Aries.

377
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:50,406
She was with us inside the rest room.

378
00:19:50,531 --> 00:19:51,656
- No!
- It was you!

379
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:53,200
Aries, it wasn't us.

380
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,660
Right? You saw her too, didn't you?

381
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:56,537
Yeah, but she was not...

382
00:19:56,538 --> 00:19:57,912
She should be punished!

383
00:19:57,913 --> 00:19:59,665
Yeah! Punish her!

384
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:03,043
Calix! Calix, no!

385
00:20:04,628 --> 00:20:06,088
No one can lay a finger on Mica!

386
00:20:06,463 --> 00:20:08,589
No one can hurt Mica! Fuck you!
You son of a bitch!

387
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,384
Don't meddle here!

388
00:20:10,634 --> 00:20:11,635
Oh my God!

389
00:20:12,136 --> 00:20:15,055
- Stop getting in our way!
- Fuck you all!

390
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,558
So, what?! You want this to get messy?

391
00:20:17,808 --> 00:20:19,727
You really like getting
your hands dirty, huh?

392
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:21,729
That's right. We're Section E, remember?

393
00:20:21,937 --> 00:20:23,772
We don't back down from a fight.

394
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:26,843
If you wanna get to Calix,
you gotta get through me, first.

395
00:20:28,736 --> 00:20:30,737
Alright. Let's fight one-on-one.

396
00:20:30,738 --> 00:20:31,238
Let's go.

397
00:20:31,238 --> 00:20:32,030
Come on!

398
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:33,323
Fight!

399
00:20:34,074 --> 00:20:35,451
This is all your fault!

400
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:41,080
My boob!

401
00:20:41,081 --> 00:20:44,251
Mykel, throw the pail
of earthworms at her!

402
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,839
[students fighting]

403
00:21:04,688 --> 00:21:05,689
Now we're even.

404
00:21:07,107 --> 00:21:08,734
Let's get out of here.

405
00:21:15,866 --> 00:21:17,116
Miss, is the doctor in?

406
00:21:17,117 --> 00:21:20,537
He's on lunch break. Excuse me,
I'll go to the rest room. Just sit there.

407
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:26,585
This migraine is killing me.

408
00:21:29,338 --> 00:21:30,380
Just take it off.

409
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:34,885
"Take it off?"

410
00:21:35,469 --> 00:21:37,221
How can I have a good look at it?

411
00:21:37,387 --> 00:21:40,014
- Don't move too much.
- Don't move?

412
00:21:40,015 --> 00:21:41,682
Ouch... Let's not do it.

413
00:21:41,683 --> 00:21:43,810
Fix your position.
It's getting hard for me.

414
00:21:43,811 --> 00:21:45,062
Turn him down Jay!

415
00:21:47,481 --> 00:21:48,649
It's too wet.

416
00:21:49,191 --> 00:21:51,902
- The wetter, the better.
- Good Lord, what's wet?

417
00:21:52,653 --> 00:21:54,029
What the hell is wet?

418
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:57,407
Ouch... It hurts.

419
00:21:57,741 --> 00:21:58,866
Wait.

420
00:21:58,867 --> 00:21:59,951
- Wait...
- Ouch...

421
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:00,952
Wait...

422
00:22:01,078 --> 00:22:02,329
Are you finished?

423
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:05,082
- Do it faster.
- I'm done.

424
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:07,041
Jay-jay!

425
00:22:09,002 --> 00:22:09,753
Oh.

426
00:22:09,754 --> 00:22:11,420
Why is your face like that?

427
00:22:11,421 --> 00:22:12,798
Looks like you saw a ghost.

428
00:22:13,757 --> 00:22:16,677
It's intense how you two "wet" each other.

429
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:19,971
You're thinking of
the wrong thing! Look!

430
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:20,972
Really?

431
00:22:21,932 --> 00:22:22,974
You really have a dirty mind!

432
00:22:22,975 --> 00:22:24,475
- You're gonna get it from me this time!
- No, don't!

433
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:25,269
Come back here!

434
00:22:25,352 --> 00:22:27,687
- Catch me if you can!
- I'm really going to hit you!

435
00:22:27,688 --> 00:22:29,106
What were you doing back there?

436
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:31,065
- Gross!
- Come back here! Hey!

437
00:22:31,066 --> 00:22:32,359
- You're so slow Jay!
- Ci-N!

438
00:22:34,528 --> 00:22:35,528
Are you alright?

439
00:22:35,529 --> 00:22:36,529
Of course.

440
00:22:39,908 --> 00:22:41,285
You lost your cool there.

441
00:22:46,206 --> 00:22:48,000
And your plan didn't even work.

442
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:52,504
Let's double down on the plan
now that she's back.

443
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:05,570
Good thing he didn't have an extreme
allergic reaction to the worms.

444
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,730
Fight!

445
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:16,403
Let's go! Let's go!

446
00:23:32,085 --> 00:23:33,712
She's been absent for a week.

447
00:23:37,466 --> 00:23:38,675
Is this guilt?

448
00:23:40,093 --> 00:23:41,178
There's no way.

449
00:23:45,432 --> 00:23:47,059
That girl is Aries' cousin.

450
00:23:47,142 --> 00:23:48,142
My enemy.

451
00:23:50,145 --> 00:23:50,812
Jay-jay!

452
00:23:50,813 --> 00:23:52,314
- Jay-jay!
- Jay!

453
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:54,483
Jay-jay!

454
00:24:06,203 --> 00:24:07,454
We can use her, you know.

455
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:09,330
That Jay-jay?

456
00:24:09,831 --> 00:24:10,415
How?

457
00:24:10,707 --> 00:24:12,376
We can get back at Aries through her.

458
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,336
And how do we do that?

459
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:17,965
Aries obviously cares for Jay-jay.
He'll hurt if she's hurt.

460
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:22,636
Is that because...

461
00:24:22,886 --> 00:24:24,513
You want to get back together with Ella?

462
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:31,936
I don't know.

463
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:34,106
Then why would we do this?

464
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:35,272
I have to know.

465
00:24:36,233 --> 00:24:37,401
Because I want to hurt him.

466
00:24:38,694 --> 00:24:39,945
Like he hurt us.

467
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:42,280
He made us look like fools!

468
00:24:43,907 --> 00:24:44,907
What's your plan?

469
00:24:51,248 --> 00:24:53,291
I'll make her fall in love with me.

470
00:24:58,714 --> 00:24:59,714
Are you sure about that?

471
00:25:00,882 --> 00:25:06,555
I'll take something so important from him
and watch him as he can't do anything.

472
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:08,472
Then...

473
00:25:08,724 --> 00:25:09,933
I'll break her heart.

474
00:25:10,392 --> 00:25:11,392
Mess her up.

475
00:25:12,019 --> 00:25:13,311
Then she'll leave the section.

476
00:25:13,603 --> 00:25:14,603
Two birds.

477
00:25:20,902 --> 00:25:22,529
Just keep it between us for now.

478
00:25:23,613 --> 00:25:25,240
I'll tell the rest of the boys soon.

479
00:25:32,414 --> 00:25:33,456
Where is she?

480
00:25:33,457 --> 00:25:34,457
Wait.

481
00:25:38,295 --> 00:25:39,463
Anytime now.

482
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,800
Bullseye.

483
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:47,304
As always Rory, you never fail.

484
00:25:47,888 --> 00:25:49,514
Always got your back, Keifer.

485
00:25:50,932 --> 00:25:52,434
Let's go!

486
00:25:53,935 --> 00:25:54,935
Come on!

487
00:25:55,479 --> 00:25:56,229
Boom!

488
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,981
Ay! Shit!

489
00:25:58,565 --> 00:25:59,858
Game on.

490
00:26:01,777 --> 00:26:03,444
Just come with us!

491
00:26:03,445 --> 00:26:05,280
Don't fight, just come with us!

492
00:26:11,912 --> 00:26:15,165
But first, make sure she
forgives you for hurting her.

493
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:17,041
Come with me.

494
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,718
How does one apologize
without saying sorry?

495
00:26:29,221 --> 00:26:34,184
Ouch! That hurts a lot!
I'm getting really pissed at you!

496
00:26:34,434 --> 00:26:35,435
Don't move.

497
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:42,776
How can I use someone so pure for revenge?

498
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:52,076
Hold still.

499
00:26:59,793 --> 00:27:02,754
How do I hurt someone
I'm slowly being drawn to?

500
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:18,435
Stop, Keifer.

501
00:27:21,982 --> 00:27:23,382
What are you rolling your eyes for?

502
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:25,402
Don't lose sight of the goal.

503
00:27:26,736 --> 00:27:28,196
Here's your order.

504
00:27:28,572 --> 00:27:30,824
Yogorino's Popular
Froyo with strawberries.

505
00:27:32,534 --> 00:27:33,534
Thank you.

506
00:27:34,327 --> 00:27:35,327
This is for you.

507
00:27:35,871 --> 00:27:36,955
What is that, a bribe?

508
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:38,540
You think you can get me with that?

509
00:27:38,999 --> 00:27:39,999
Yeah.

510
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,310
It's every girl's weakness.

511
00:27:41,334 --> 00:27:42,751
No, not me.

512
00:27:42,752 --> 00:27:43,795
I don't even like that.

513
00:27:45,505 --> 00:27:46,505
What do you want?

514
00:27:47,382 --> 00:27:49,134
A simple sorry from "here."

515
00:27:50,594 --> 00:27:53,180
And an explanation why you did that to me.

516
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:55,557
Don't give in to your guilt.

517
00:27:56,391 --> 00:27:57,726
Apologizing is not my thing.

518
00:27:58,602 --> 00:27:59,644
So is explaining.

519
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:02,063
Then we're just wasting our time here.

520
00:28:03,106 --> 00:28:04,106
I'm going home.

521
00:28:09,529 --> 00:28:11,239
But how do you win her over?

522
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:12,489
Tss!

523
00:28:13,617 --> 00:28:14,492
Keif...

524
00:28:14,493 --> 00:28:15,660
Look... it's Jay-jay.

525
00:28:16,244 --> 00:28:16,786
Hmm!

526
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:17,995
So irritating!

527
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:19,372
By being playful?

528
00:28:19,915 --> 00:28:21,675
You really like throwing
garbage around huh?

529
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:25,003
What is it to you?

530
00:28:25,378 --> 00:28:26,171
What's your problem?

531
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:27,171
You!

532
00:28:29,925 --> 00:28:32,260
You're so full of yourself.

533
00:28:32,552 --> 00:28:36,223
I just splashed your faces
with water to tone down all that make-up.

534
00:28:36,932 --> 00:28:37,974
By rooting for her?

535
00:28:38,683 --> 00:28:40,977
No! You stay here.

536
00:28:44,564 --> 00:28:48,193
It's not easy when you're always reminded
of the pain that your enemy caused.

537
00:28:51,488 --> 00:28:52,948
And of the heartache...

538
00:28:53,323 --> 00:28:54,783
that turned into hate.

539
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:56,993
She's my cousin.

540
00:28:57,535 --> 00:29:01,539
But that doesn't mean she has immunity
against whatever you want to do with her.

541
00:29:02,832 --> 00:29:05,293
Do not buy into the charade.
She's your enemy.

542
00:29:06,294 --> 00:29:08,713
What did you say again about...

543
00:29:09,339 --> 00:29:10,840
About Ella?

544
00:29:11,378 --> 00:29:12,962
Stop lying, you freak!

545
00:29:12,987 --> 00:29:16,574
Didn't you say Ella's a whore who flirts
with everyone? You said that, right?

546
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:17,389
Is that true?

547
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:19,224
You called Ella a whore?

548
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:22,477
Yeah, punish her!

549
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:24,437
Calix!

550
00:29:24,438 --> 00:29:26,981
No one can hurt Mica!
Fuck you! You son of a bitch!

551
00:29:26,982 --> 00:29:28,482
Stop getting in our way!

552
00:29:28,483 --> 00:29:31,486
You really like getting
your hands dirty, huh?

553
00:29:31,987 --> 00:29:33,321
You started the battle...

554
00:29:34,406 --> 00:29:36,726
If you wanna get to Calix,
you gotta get through me, first.

555
00:29:36,825 --> 00:29:38,367
- Alright. Let's fight one-on-one.
- Let's go.

556
00:29:38,368 --> 00:29:39,661
But I'll be the one to end it.

557
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,048
Always remember...

558
00:29:58,346 --> 00:30:00,890
That all is fair in love and war.

559
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:02,976
Sorry, David.

560
00:30:06,229 --> 00:30:08,440
Go ahead and sleep.

561
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:11,608
Get a room.

562
00:30:14,328 --> 00:30:17,582
You have a nasty attitude,
that's why you don't appreciate kindness.

563
00:30:19,868 --> 00:30:22,829
You know what? Since this is your fault,
get me some water.

564
00:30:25,665 --> 00:30:27,124
You're not even injured, right?

565
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:28,668
See? You can still stand up.

566
00:30:29,044 --> 00:30:30,128
Get it yourself.

567
00:30:32,255 --> 00:30:33,506
Give me your water first then.

568
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:38,510
Ouch.

569
00:30:38,553 --> 00:30:41,056
You're making Freya's scratches worse!

570
00:30:41,348 --> 00:30:42,432
You got them wet!

571
00:30:42,557 --> 00:30:45,277
As if my back isn't sore enough.
You're really something, aren't you?

572
00:30:46,186 --> 00:30:48,104
Let me clean it with
the antiseptic solution.

573
00:30:49,105 --> 00:30:50,105
No thanks.

574
00:30:52,067 --> 00:30:52,942
I'll do it.

575
00:30:52,942 --> 00:30:53,942
Like you can.

576
00:30:58,448 --> 00:30:59,448
Let me see.

577
00:31:04,037 --> 00:31:05,037
Okay, fine.

578
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:06,163
Do it properly.

579
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:08,332
There.

580
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:10,085
You splashed water over here.

581
00:31:11,211 --> 00:31:12,962
There. Peek inside.

582
00:31:13,088 --> 00:31:13,421
Oh.

583
00:31:14,089 --> 00:31:15,131
Just take it off.

584
00:31:18,927 --> 00:31:19,928
Alright.

585
00:31:30,855 --> 00:31:31,940
I'll go slowly.

586
00:31:36,486 --> 00:31:37,486
Here.

587
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:46,246
Go slowly, okay?

588
00:31:46,579 --> 00:31:47,622
I'll be gentle.

589
00:31:47,956 --> 00:31:48,998
Ouch...

590
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:50,875
How can I have a good look at it?

591
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Don't move too much.

592
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,336
Just wait a minute.

593
00:31:56,589 --> 00:31:57,674
Ouch, it stings.

594
00:31:57,882 --> 00:31:59,300
I'll go slowly.

595
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:02,386
Ouch.

596
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,640
Are you done?

597
00:32:06,641 --> 00:32:07,641
Just wait.

598
00:32:07,934 --> 00:32:09,060
Do it quickly.

599
00:32:12,021 --> 00:32:14,065
Ouch! It hurts! Let's not do it!

600
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:15,399
Don't move.

601
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:18,486
Fix your position. It's
getting hard for me.

602
00:32:22,615 --> 00:32:24,701
It's too wet. Let's not do it.

603
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,161
The wetter, the better.

604
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:31,748
Ouch...

605
00:32:32,208 --> 00:32:33,334
Ouch, it stings!

606
00:32:33,376 --> 00:32:33,793
Ouch.

607
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:35,044
Are you done?

608
00:32:35,128 --> 00:32:36,128
Wait.

609
00:32:36,296 --> 00:32:36,671
Wait.

610
00:32:36,671 --> 00:32:37,088
Ouch.

611
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:38,130
Wait.

612
00:32:39,382 --> 00:32:39,924
Do it quickly.

613
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:40,924
I'm done.

614
00:32:43,511 --> 00:32:44,511
Gee, thanks.

615
00:32:45,847 --> 00:32:46,847
It's over now.

616
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,640
Jay-jay!

617
00:32:49,601 --> 00:32:50,601
Oh?

618
00:32:50,727 --> 00:32:51,935
Why is your face like that?

619
00:32:51,936 --> 00:32:53,229
Looks like you saw a ghost.

620
00:32:54,314 --> 00:32:57,484
It's intense how you two "wet" each other.

621
00:32:57,901 --> 00:33:00,819
You're thinking of the
wrong thing! Look! Look!

622
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,030
Really?

623
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:03,530
You really have a dirty mind!

624
00:33:03,531 --> 00:33:04,948
- You're gonna get it from me this time!
- No, don't!

625
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:05,867
Come back here!

626
00:33:05,867 --> 00:33:06,451
Hey!

627
00:33:06,452 --> 00:33:08,494
- Catch me if you can!
- I'm really going to hit you!

628
00:33:08,495 --> 00:33:09,912
What were you doing back there?

629
00:33:09,913 --> 00:33:11,663
- Gross!
- Come back here! Hey!

630
00:33:11,664 --> 00:33:13,333
- You're so slow Jay!
- Ci-N!

631
00:33:20,632 --> 00:33:22,509
Guys, it's our monthly assembly.

632
00:33:22,592 --> 00:33:23,635
You know the drill.

633
00:33:24,219 --> 00:33:25,345
Let's go.

634
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:27,096
Let's go.

635
00:33:27,096 --> 00:33:27,764
Come on.

636
00:33:28,014 --> 00:33:29,307
What are we gonna do?

637
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:30,767
What is the monthly assembly?

638
00:33:30,934 --> 00:33:31,934
Monthly assembly?

639
00:33:32,393 --> 00:33:33,477
You don't know?

640
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:34,478
No. What's with it?

641
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:36,689
To those who have no
idea what's going on...

642
00:33:37,106 --> 00:33:38,525
AKA Jay-jay.

643
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:41,527
This is the time we discuss
our concerns with the admin.

644
00:33:41,528 --> 00:33:45,531
Perfect! They can finally fix
the girls' restroom! It's very dirty.

645
00:33:45,532 --> 00:33:46,783
Let's go! Come on!

646
00:33:46,908 --> 00:33:48,117
But you're not coming with us.

647
00:33:49,035 --> 00:33:50,578
You don't really belong.

648
00:33:51,204 --> 00:33:52,204
You stay here.

649
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:53,830
Why am I not allowed?

650
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:56,751
Stay here. Look after our things.

651
00:33:57,293 --> 00:33:58,628
I'm also in Section E.

652
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:01,735
Do you remember the fuss you made?

653
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:04,667
You really think it's a good idea
for you to see Section A?

654
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:10,669
Clean the room while we're gone.

655
00:34:13,476 --> 00:34:15,352
We'll update you, Jay.

656
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:16,353
Alright, fine.

657
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:23,236
The girls' restroom, okay?

658
00:34:27,282 --> 00:34:28,449
You're in a good mood.

659
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:31,828
Is it because Jay-jay's
not mad at you anymore?

660
00:34:31,995 --> 00:34:32,995
Yeah.

661
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:34,122
I mean...

662
00:34:34,122 --> 00:34:35,122
Yes.

663
00:34:35,248 --> 00:34:37,041
It only means our plan is slowly working.

664
00:34:38,126 --> 00:34:39,126
I see.

665
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:54,851
I'm still hungry until now.

666
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:58,438
I'm still hungry.

667
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:02,098
Jay-jay? What happened to you?

668
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,400
Jay-jay?

669
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:04,694
What happened to you?

670
00:35:05,445 --> 00:35:06,445
Jay?

671
00:35:08,031 --> 00:35:09,616
Hey, are you okay?

672
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:11,408
Jay?

673
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,411
I'm fine...

674
00:35:15,204 --> 00:35:16,331
I just feel like...

675
00:35:16,664 --> 00:35:17,707
doing some planks.

676
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:19,792
Planks? Those are push ups!

677
00:35:20,043 --> 00:35:21,794
For real, Jay-jay. Are you hurt?

678
00:35:22,837 --> 00:35:24,172
Don't worry, Im fine.

679
00:35:24,881 --> 00:35:26,299
Jay, who did this to you?

680
00:35:26,549 --> 00:35:27,508
You want us to beat them up?

681
00:35:27,508 --> 00:35:28,134
Yeah.

682
00:35:28,468 --> 00:35:29,636
No need for that.

683
00:35:30,345 --> 00:35:31,429
I'll just go to the clinic.

684
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:33,556
- I'll come with you, Jay.
- I'll go with you.

685
00:35:33,723 --> 00:35:34,723
Come on.

686
00:35:36,225 --> 00:35:37,643
Just take it slow.

687
00:35:37,644 --> 00:35:38,644
It's alright.

688
00:35:39,479 --> 00:35:40,521
I can go by myself.

689
00:35:40,688 --> 00:35:41,731
Maybe she's on her period?

690
00:35:49,197 --> 00:35:50,323
Does she have period cramps?

691
00:35:52,408 --> 00:35:54,702
She looked like a mermaid
washed ashore.

692
00:36:08,091 --> 00:36:09,300
Are you sure you're okay?

693
00:36:10,134 --> 00:36:13,221
What was causing you pain yesterday?
Was it dysmennorhea?

694
00:36:14,097 --> 00:36:17,266
Ahh… yes. It suddenly hurt,
but I'm okay now.

695
00:36:17,725 --> 00:36:18,685
You're not gonna eat?

696
00:36:18,685 --> 00:36:19,268
No.

697
00:36:19,268 --> 00:36:19,727
Sure?

698
00:36:19,727 --> 00:36:20,727
Yes, yes.

699
00:36:21,062 --> 00:36:22,938
- Take care, okay?
- Yes, thank you.

700
00:36:22,939 --> 00:36:23,939
- Thank you.
- Bye.

701
00:36:25,233 --> 00:36:26,233
Oh!

702
00:36:28,236 --> 00:36:29,404
What are you doing here?

703
00:36:29,737 --> 00:36:30,857
Let's go to school together.

704
00:36:31,948 --> 00:36:32,948
Come quick.

705
00:36:33,783 --> 00:36:36,284
This young troublemaker loves me.

706
00:36:36,285 --> 00:36:37,120
You love me.

707
00:36:37,121 --> 00:36:38,329
Don't treat me like a kid.

708
00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:40,331
You love me, don't you?

709
00:36:41,624 --> 00:36:43,042
Bro. Keifer, it's confirmed.

710
00:36:43,376 --> 00:36:45,670
The people who hurt
Jay-jay are from Section D.

711
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:48,297
And it's possible that Freya
asked them to do it, bro.

712
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:52,435
What do you think?
Shall we get back at them?

713
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:54,887
What do you care about her?

714
00:36:56,889 --> 00:36:59,609
It's protecting one of our own.
That's why we're Section E, remember?

715
00:37:06,482 --> 00:37:07,066
Damn!

716
00:37:07,067 --> 00:37:08,358
Give me back my bag!

717
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:09,839
- Give me my bag!
- Here, dude! Catch!

718
00:37:10,987 --> 00:37:11,987
Give it to me!

719
00:37:12,238 --> 00:37:13,238
Pass it to me!

720
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:16,367
I told you to give it back!
I'm getting annoyed now!

721
00:37:16,784 --> 00:37:18,619
[boys cheering]

722
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:22,248
Give it to me! Now!

723
00:37:22,582 --> 00:37:23,707
Go, pass it on! Pass it!

724
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:24,708
Felix.

725
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:29,130
I'm telling you,
I'm really getting pissed at you!

726
00:37:31,007 --> 00:37:33,718
[boys cheering]

727
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:35,051
Stop it!

728
00:37:35,344 --> 00:37:36,970
Guys, I'm getting annoyed now!

729
00:37:36,971 --> 00:37:38,555
[boys cheering]

730
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:39,640
Hey!

731
00:37:39,766 --> 00:37:41,141
What are you doing, man? Hold her!

732
00:37:41,142 --> 00:37:42,225
Guys, stop it.

733
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:44,061
Hold her, bro!

734
00:37:44,353 --> 00:37:45,146
Don't let her go!

735
00:37:45,147 --> 00:37:47,027
- What are you planning to do?!
- Do it quickly!

736
00:37:48,816 --> 00:37:49,858
Here we go!

737
00:37:49,859 --> 00:37:51,778
What are you gonna do to my bag?!

738
00:37:58,868 --> 00:38:02,497
Respect the flag! Section E...

739
00:38:03,122 --> 00:38:04,831
salute...

740
00:38:04,832 --> 00:38:05,832
Now!

741
00:38:23,851 --> 00:38:25,895
What the hell are you doing?
Put my bag down!

742
00:38:26,354 --> 00:38:29,315
Don't be disrespectful.
We're honoring the flag.

743
00:38:30,066 --> 00:38:31,484
Jerk! What do you mean "flag?!"

744
00:38:31,901 --> 00:38:32,901
Wait.

745
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:34,820
Wait.

746
00:38:35,071 --> 00:38:36,280
Respect... the bag!

747
00:38:39,242 --> 00:38:41,661
You! You're joining in on the fun, huh?!

748
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:46,706
I'm telling you, guys!
The chocolate might melt!

749
00:38:46,707 --> 00:38:47,333
Chocolate?

750
00:38:47,334 --> 00:38:49,251
Hey! Did she say chocolate?

751
00:38:49,252 --> 00:38:50,878
Get it down! Get it down!

752
00:38:53,422 --> 00:38:54,965
Faster! Get it!

753
00:38:54,966 --> 00:38:56,341
Hey the chocolate!

754
00:38:56,342 --> 00:38:58,760
- Hey, Ci-N! Dude!
- Ci-N! Give it to me!

755
00:38:58,761 --> 00:39:00,388
- Get it!
- Give it to me!

756
00:39:02,223 --> 00:39:03,099
No! Get the bag from her!

757
00:39:03,099 --> 00:39:04,099
Attack!

758
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:05,475
Faster!

759
00:39:06,018 --> 00:39:07,018
Chase her!

760
00:39:08,354 --> 00:39:10,106
- I'm getting really pissed!
- Jay-jay!

761
00:39:10,565 --> 00:39:11,565
Jay-jay!

762
00:39:12,608 --> 00:39:13,608
Attack!

763
00:39:14,402 --> 00:39:16,111
- Hurry!
- Go get her!

764
00:39:16,112 --> 00:39:17,113
Faster!

765
00:39:29,625 --> 00:39:31,419
I think it's time we tell the boys.

766
00:39:40,136 --> 00:39:41,136
Keifer!

767
00:39:41,387 --> 00:39:42,054
What's up?

768
00:39:42,388 --> 00:39:43,388
It's Jay-jay!

769
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:45,850
She's fighting the boys who hurt her!

770
00:39:46,267 --> 00:39:47,518
Huh?! Where are they?!

771
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:06,787
You got some nerve.

772
00:40:08,664 --> 00:40:09,664
Who do you think you are?

773
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:12,585
I have a message to Freya.
Can you deliver it?

774
00:40:12,835 --> 00:40:14,235
It's us who have a message for you.

775
00:40:15,004 --> 00:40:16,004
[struggling]

776
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:22,428
What's the King of Assholes doing here?

777
00:40:26,015 --> 00:40:27,016
Dude, get up!

778
00:41:14,313 --> 00:41:16,022
There's an announcement in the group chat.

779
00:41:16,023 --> 00:41:17,108
Classes are suspended!

780
00:41:19,527 --> 00:41:20,361
You're staying here?

781
00:41:20,362 --> 00:41:23,322
Yuri, are you related to Keifer?
You have the same attitude.

782
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:25,574
Whatever.

783
00:41:25,575 --> 00:41:27,076
Stupid comparison.

784
00:41:28,244 --> 00:41:31,997
I'm gonna die!

785
00:41:31,998 --> 00:41:35,126
One, two, three!

786
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:40,214
Where are we?

787
00:41:40,506 --> 00:41:43,009
This is not a house. It's a building!

788
00:41:43,217 --> 00:41:44,801
Is this your real hair?

789
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:45,845
It suits you.

790
00:41:46,095 --> 00:41:48,013
You know, I take back what I said.

791
00:41:48,014 --> 00:41:49,389
You're different from Keifer.

792
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:52,351
You're easier to approach and talk to.

793
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,227
We were suddenly attacked by that girl!

794
00:41:54,228 --> 00:41:56,104
We tried fighting her off,

795
00:41:56,105 --> 00:41:59,108
but Keifer arrived and did this to us!

796
00:41:59,275 --> 00:42:00,400
Not all he said was true!

797
00:42:00,401 --> 00:42:01,736
So who's at fault here?

798
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:02,611
It's Keifer!

799
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,404
It's not Keifer's fault.

800
00:42:04,405 --> 00:42:06,157
I was the one who started it.

801
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:08,534
How are we gonna use
Jay-jay against Aries?

802
00:42:08,784 --> 00:42:10,494
I'm gonna make her
fall in love with me.
