1
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:17,641
Jay-jay. Are you feeling okay?

2
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:20,728
You don't need to resort
to fighting all the time.

3
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:23,522
But… if you really have to… Go!

4
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:24,773
- If that's what you have to.
- Are you sure?

5
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:25,774
Is it really okay?

6
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:26,860
Yes!

7
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:28,570
Your nose is so red!

8
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:30,947
You look stupid!

9
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,783
You better stop mocking me.
This was all your fault.

10
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,536
- Come with us.
- Yeah, let's go.

11
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,789
Do you think I've forgotten
what you did to me?

12
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:41,790
Childish!

13
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,585
- Childish?
- Ouch!

14
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:45,646
I'm getting really pissed at you!
This hurts a lot!

15
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,171
I'm asking you a serious question.

16
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,256
If I end up looking like Voldemort,
you should pay to fix my nose...

17
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:50,257
Don't move.

18
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,343
Do it properly.

19
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:53,385
Hold still.

20
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,974
I cannot believe Kiko.

21
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:02,352
And he won't shut up about
that new transferee, Jay-jay.

22
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:04,189
She's not even that pretty.

23
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,690
Who's the ugly one again?

24
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:07,858
[girls screaming]

25
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,234
Give me back my bag!

26
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,069
What are you gonna do to my bag?

27
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,405
The chocolate will melt!

28
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:12,864
Chocolate?

29
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,031
I'm getting really annoyed at you all!

30
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,284
- Get her bag!
- Jay-jay!

31
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:18,953
You have guts.

32
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:20,538
Who do you think you are?

33
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,458
I have a message to Freya.
Can you deliver it?

34
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,066
It's us who have a message for you.

35
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:31,758
Beat it.

36
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,136
Dude, get up!

37
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,351
Fight!

38
00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:12,757
What?

39
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:14,050
Did you die over there?

40
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,890
What would you do without me?

41
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,228
Wow... So cocky.

42
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:29,022
Jay...

43
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:32,485
Are you okay?

44
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,532
Yeah.

45
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:18,990
We got to go.

46
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,619
You go ahead. I'll follow in a while.

47
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,162
We gotta go now!

48
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,501
Tss.

49
00:03:30,964 --> 00:03:31,965
Suit yourself.

50
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:39,868
I should post you on Social Media.
Caption it with "Ungentlemanly!"

51
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,973
You move like a turtle.

52
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:48,603
If only his personality
was as pretty as his face.

53
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,230
I might get bashed, though.

54
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:54,858
Jay!

55
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:57,570
Where are they?!

56
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,281
Where's Keifer?

57
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,160
He already left.

58
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,454
Find him.

59
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:13,419
Where are you hurt?

60
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,424
Behind you!

61
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,353
What are you doing?

62
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:33,022
It'll take too long if I don't carry you.

63
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:37,068
There's something
different about Yuri today.

64
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,320
He seems nice.

65
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:42,114
Far from the Yuri that
I've always clashed with.

66
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,783
Can I ask you a favor?

67
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:50,415
Take the fall for this
incident with Section D.

68
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,250
If you're wondering why...

69
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:55,420
Because Keifer can't be
implicated in anymore trouble.

70
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:58,964
Fine.

71
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:00,800
I'll take the fall.

72
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,610
[thunder rumbles]

73
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:44,946
What the fuck?

74
00:06:52,972 --> 00:06:58,351
Why is the King of Assholes ignoring me,
after he helped with those demons?

75
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,180
Guys, guys.

76
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,611
There's an announcement in the group chat.

77
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,226
Classes are suspended.

78
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,727
Most of the students went home already.

79
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:23,651
[boys cheering]

80
00:07:26,832 --> 00:07:29,668
Aries, can I ride back home with you?

81
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,576
- Ci-N wanna share a ride?
- Let's go.

82
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:33,828
Jay, we're going ahead.

83
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:35,203
Bye, Jay.

84
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:37,957
Wake up bro.

85
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,560
You're staying?

86
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,188
Maybe you enjoy being alone here.

87
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,107
Hey... wait.

88
00:08:03,482 --> 00:08:04,482
Tss.

89
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:07,737
What are you scoffing for?

90
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,072
When you scoff like that,
you're kinda like Keifer.

91
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,043
I just scoffed and I'm already like Keifer?

92
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,618
Aren't you too obsessed with him?

93
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,879
Hey!

94
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:27,673
What the hell?

95
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:28,798
I'm sorry.

96
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,133
Just go home.

97
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:33,679
Yuri... are you related to Keifer?

98
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,181
No. Why?

99
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,476
You have the same attitude.
As if you're possessed.

100
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:39,976
Possessed?

101
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,895
- That's the term you chose?
- Uh-huh.

102
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,355
Tss.

103
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:44,524
Whatever.

104
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,874
See! You're practically the same!

105
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:47,899
Hey, wait up!

106
00:08:48,234 --> 00:08:50,653
Keifer 2.0! Wait a minute!

107
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,657
Stupid comparison.

108
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:58,703
You know it's my first
time taking this shortcut.

109
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:01,165
Why won't you wait for me, Keifer 2.0?

110
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:04,961
So I'm Keifer 2.0 huh?
Let's see how you can handle this!

111
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,713
How do I cross now?!

112
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,257
Swim!

113
00:09:13,968 --> 00:09:15,927
[Jay-jay screams]

114
00:09:16,001 --> 00:09:18,807
Mud! It got on my shoes!

115
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:22,937
I'm stuck in the mud! Please help me!

116
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:31,779
I'm gonna die here!

117
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,157
Quicksand! Quicksand, help!

118
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:40,246
I'm gonna die! I'm really gonna die!

119
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:45,459
Gosh, it's so muddy!

120
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:46,835
Hold this.

121
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:48,504
Why did you come back?

122
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:49,922
You look so stupid.

123
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:51,673
Here, hold this.

124
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,258
Just admit you were
bugged by your conscience.

125
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,259
Hold it!

126
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:55,385
Alright.

127
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,057
Wait, what are you gonna do?

128
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,401
I'll carry you.
 Stupid.

129
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,102
Where?

130
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:05,354
Where's the cow?

131
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,231
On the count of three...

132
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:08,898
Ready.

133
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,108
One.

134
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:10,860
Two.

135
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:11,652
Three.

136
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:12,862
[Yuri screams]

137
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,281
[Jay-jay screams]

138
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,668
I'm sorry. Are you hurt?

139
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,879
No, but we have to get up now.

140
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,214
It's so disgusting.

141
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,725
Oh no, I didn't mean it! Sorry!

142
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:43,809
[Yuri groans in pain]

143
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,227
I'm really sorry.

144
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:46,436
Just...

145
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:47,980
Just don't move, okay?

146
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,487
Why are you walking funny?

147
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:56,197
You'll never understand.

148
00:11:00,394 --> 00:11:01,646
Can it get any worse?!

149
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:03,738
This is Aries' fault.

150
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,377
What the hell.

151
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:17,426
What the hell.

152
00:11:25,444 --> 00:11:26,444
Let's go.

153
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,019
Huh?

154
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,316
I'm not asking for your help.

155
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:37,154
Come on, get in. So we're even.

156
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:43,702
Works for me.

157
00:12:10,277 --> 00:12:12,289
Here. Wear this.

158
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:13,816
You might die due to the cold.

159
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:36,671
All set?

160
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,596
Yeah. Thanks.

161
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,647
- Put on your seatbelt.
- Oh, yeah. Sorry.

162
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:40,735
Jay?

163
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:43,112
Jay?

164
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,242
Wake up. We're here.

165
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,078
Where are we?

166
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,873
The roads to your place
are all flooded, that's why…

167
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:56,274
I thought it's better for us
to stay here at our place first.

168
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,378
Let's go.

169
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:00,673
To my place?

170
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:09,431
How did you know the way to my place?
I didn't even tell you where I live.

171
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,310
Uh... Ci-N told me.

172
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,145
I still don't know the exact address,
but you were sleeping like a baby.

173
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:17,314
I didn't want to wake you up.

174
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,107
Oh.

175
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,025
Alright.

176
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,071
Good afternoon.

177
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:26,573
Wait…

178
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,367
Where exactly are we?

179
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:31,203
This is not a house. It's a building!

180
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:32,704
I know.

181
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:33,956
This is where I live.

182
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,207
Really?

183
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,794
Mr. Hanamitchi, do you need anything?

184
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,044
No, thank you.

185
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,129
Let's go.

186
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:44,174
Hey!

187
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,553
Are you seriously saying
this is where you live?

188
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:49,888
Big time Mr. Hanamitchi.

189
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,809
Woah… this is massive.

190
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,812
Are you for real? This is not a joke?

191
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,981
[Jay-jay gasps]

192
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,817
You have elevators in your house?!

193
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:04,611
That's so cool.

194
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,698
Even Section E's building
doesn't have one of these.

195
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:08,365
Thank you.

196
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,575
Well, when you think about it,
we're in a building anyway.

197
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,576
Let's go.

198
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:16,539
Come in.

199
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,462
[in Japanese]
Welcome Home, Young Master.

200
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:22,837
What was that?

201
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,466
They call you "Young Master?"

202
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:26,508
Mind your own business.

203
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,917
I just brought you here
because I didn't have a choice.

204
00:15:30,112 --> 00:15:31,112
You're so cranky.

205
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,681
I also didn't have a choice.

206
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,390
Sit down.

207
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:37,519
Are you sure?

208
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:38,395
I'm still dripping…

209
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:39,395
Sit.

210
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:43,358
Are you sure? If this couch gets ruined
I don't have money to replace it.

211
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,069
Young Master, your
grandfather is looking for you.

212
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,070
Tss.

213
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,864
Tell him to go back to Japan.

214
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,494
You jerk. Learn how to respect your elders.

215
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,538
Was hitting my head necessary?

216
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,750
I'll take a shower first.

217
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,461
Don't tell him I'm with someone.

218
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,047
Let's go.

219
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:06,255
Huh?

220
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:07,924
Let's go!

221
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:20,771
Take it off now.

222
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:21,938
What?!

223
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,483
My jacket. Take it off.

224
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:25,608
I'll have it washed.

225
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,652
Ahh.

226
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,531
I thought you were...

227
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,156
Take a bath.

228
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,534
Just find something you can wear.

229
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:35,368
How about you?

230
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:37,430
I'll shower in the guest room.
You want us to go together?

231
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:38,454
Hmm?

232
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:43,627
What I mean is, I'll use the guest room
so you'll feel comfortable here.

233
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:46,587
Alright.

234
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,134
Thank you.

235
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,144
That bath was nice.

236
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:03,855
Oh?

237
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:06,734
Where is my bag?

238
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,320
Well, I don't think it's
gonna get lost in here.

239
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:13,073
Wait... what's the view like up here?

240
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,701
Let's go see it.

241
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:16,909
Ouch...

242
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:26,879
Wow!

243
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,965
So beautiful!

244
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:31,717
Woah...

245
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,219
You can see everything up here.

246
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:35,846
The lights are so pretty.

247
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:38,682
How can you even sleep here?
It's so nice to look at.

248
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,394
So beautiful...

249
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,938
Wow, you can see everything here.

250
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,066
So pretty.

251
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:51,945
Enjoying the view?

252
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:54,655
Oh.

253
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:57,451
Don't you have any other color to wear?

254
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,286
We look like we're in a dance group.

255
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,296
You're the one borrowing my clothes,
but you have the nerve to compain.

256
00:18:04,082 --> 00:18:07,419
The maid took my dirty clothes.
I was gonna head out, actually.

257
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:10,964
But how can I step out
in these baggy clothes?

258
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:12,716
You can wear it for now.

259
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,509
It's gonna be quick to clean.
There's a dryer here.

260
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:18,763
The rain stopped.

261
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,349
But the streets may still be flooded.

262
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:23,852
Unbelievable...

263
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,270
You're so rich.

264
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:26,980
You own this whole building.

265
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,191
Who had this building constructed?

266
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:32,109
The Old Man.

267
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:34,403
He wants to feel like...

268
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:35,989
He's not far away from his hometown.

269
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:37,783
That's why he had this built.

270
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:39,951
Hmm.

271
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,164
But where are your parents?

272
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,461
In Japan.

273
00:18:50,128 --> 00:18:51,880
They're running our business there.

274
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:55,467
Why don't I hear you speak Japanese
if you're Japanese?

275
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:57,261
I'm in the Philippines, right?

276
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:58,846
Why would I speak Japanese here?

277
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:02,850
Is this really your hair color?

278
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,768
It probably isn't, right?

279
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:06,103
But it suits you.

280
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:09,773
Maybe you're imitating
Sakuragi from Slam Dunk.

281
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:11,482
Maybe...

282
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,693
Are you related?

283
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,278
You're both called Hanamitchi.

284
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,405
Sakuragi's not even real.

285
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:17,990
Ah.

286
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,365
You're right.

287
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:24,413
You know what, I take back what I said.

288
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,832
You're different from Keifer.

289
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,042
What do you mean?

290
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:34,173
You're easier to approach and talk to.

291
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,608
I like it better when you're like this.

292
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:05,162
Young Master. Your
grandfather is calling for you.

293
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:06,663
Just wait for me here.

294
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:09,541
He wants your friend to join you.

295
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:24,639
Yuri,

296
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,183
Who is this girl?

297
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,227
Speak in Tagalog.

298
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,104
We're in the Philippines.

299
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:34,066
Who is this girl with you?

300
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,444
Why did you bring her here?

301
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,905
Are you going to sleep already?

302
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,200
What are you gonna do?

303
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:44,952
We're having a sleepover.

304
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:46,494
Just us two.

305
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:48,664
What the hell!

306
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:52,709
She's my classmate.

307
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,585
We got caught in the rain. Got drenched.

308
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:55,671
So I brought her here.

309
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:57,839
A classmate?

310
00:20:58,545 --> 00:21:00,380
Don't lie to me, Yuri.

311
00:21:01,183 --> 00:21:03,637
It's the first time you
brought a girl home.

312
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:20,988
What is your name?

313
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,494
I'm Jasper Jean Mariano.

314
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,496
Jay-jay for short.

315
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:31,373
Who are your parents?

316
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:35,544
I'm not acquainted with any Mariano.

317
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:37,170
Ahh...

318
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:39,423
I don't know who my father is.

319
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,258
My mother, however...

320
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,552
She lives with the Fernandez clan.

321
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,013
Fernandez?

322
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:52,477
You're related to Michael Angelo Fernandez?

323
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:56,148
Fer Corp's new CEO?

324
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,775
Yes. He's my cousin.

325
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:03,839
Hey!

326
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:05,717
I thought I was late.

327
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:06,926
Not yet.

328
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,515
How are you and your grandfather?

329
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:14,434
It's nothing to worrry about.

330
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:18,563
What's funny?

331
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:22,984
Nothing. I just remembered
what you were doing there yesterday.

332
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,508
How was it again? When you were
clenching your legs like this.

333
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:29,199
- See? You remembered it too.
- "Crazy!"

334
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,493
Was it really painful? As in?

335
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:34,955
From 1 to 10? Was it 9?

336
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,164
Because it looked like
you were in real pain.

337
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:38,165
You're pushing it.

338
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,043
And your face became so flushed!

339
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:50,636
What was your face again like?
Just tell me. 1 to 10.

340
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:52,638
Why won't you let the topic go, Jay-jay?

341
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:53,765
Come on, 1 to 10?

342
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:57,352
Spill it! Maybe it's up to 20
that's why your face got all contorted.

343
00:23:58,061 --> 00:23:59,061
Hey!

344
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:00,479
Hey, why are you ignoring me?

345
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,480
Hi, Jay-jay.

346
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,113
Move over.

347
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:13,701
Where were you?

348
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:16,621
At home. Where else?

349
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,332
What's up with the two of you?

350
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:24,880
Ahh. Jay-jay was stranded at our place.

351
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:28,967
At your place? How?

352
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:30,510
What do you mean how?

353
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,095
It rained, and then...

354
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,681
We went to our place
and got stranded there.

355
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,936
One more time.

356
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:44,941
But don't worry.

357
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:47,319
Nothing changed.

358
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:49,070
Your plan is still intact.

359
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,289
Jasper Jean Mariano?

360
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,541
And Mark Keifer Watson.

361
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,294
Come with me to the Guidance Office.

362
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:11,133
[students teasing]

363
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:12,593
You're in trouble.

364
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:17,599
[students continue teasing]

365
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:25,023
Ma'am, we were just hanging out in the gym.

366
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,275
When Jay suddenly went to us.

367
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:30,194
We asked her what she's doing there.

368
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,029
And we told her to go.

369
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,114
That's right, Ma'am.

370
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:35,742
We were suddenly attacked by that girl!

371
00:25:36,237 --> 00:25:38,697
We tried fighting her off, but...

372
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,288
She's a girl.

373
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,290
We can't just hurt her.

374
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:47,629
We tried stopping her amidst
the flurry of her kicks and punches.

375
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:48,463
But then...

376
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:51,174
Keifer arrived and did this to us.

377
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:56,721
Is there something funny Miss Mariano?

378
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:00,350
Are all of these true?

379
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:03,979
Ma'am.

380
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:05,563
Not all he said was true.

381
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:08,817
Yes, we were in a fight.
But it was their fault in the first place.

382
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,278
He was the first to throw a punch.

383
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:13,714
Yeah. And then he fell on his face.

384
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,031
This one started it.

385
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:16,782
And this one also tripped.

386
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:17,617
That's not true at all!

387
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:18,784
Ma'am, that's not the truth.

388
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:19,536
It's true! It's true!

389
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:21,287
[students bickering]

390
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,830
So who's at fault here?

391
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:23,831
It's Keifer!

392
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,210
Keifer,

393
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:29,963
I'm so tired of your shenanigans.

394
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:32,173
I already warned you about it.

395
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:35,010
One more offense and you're expelled.

396
00:26:35,103 --> 00:26:38,126
I thought you already learned your lesson
after what you did at the canteen.

397
00:26:38,151 --> 00:26:41,780
You know it will be difficult to defend you
from the school board this time.

398
00:26:42,076 --> 00:26:43,076
I hope...

399
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:44,686
Can I ask you a favor?

400
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,314
Take the fall for the
incident with Section D.

401
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,107
If you're wondering why...

402
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:51,942
Because Keifer can't be implicated
in any more trouble.

403
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,694
What's your defense, Mr. Watson?

404
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:54,695
Stop it!

405
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:57,032
It's not Keifer's fault.

406
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,202
I was the one who started it.

407
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:02,578
It was me alone.

408
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:05,623
These jerks are just ashamed
to admit they lost to a girl.

409
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,169
Miss Mariano, what are you talking about?

410
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:14,257
I'm telling you that it
was my fault, Ma'am.

411
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,258
I wasn't just caught in it.

412
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:18,845
I actually attacked these
students from Section D.

413
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:23,058
You're aware of my records
from my old school, right?

414
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:25,268
Miss Mariano...

415
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,063
This is serious.

416
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,690
You can be expelled.

417
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,125
You'll expel me for this incident, Ma'am?

418
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:40,116
That is why, if you are tying
to cover up for Mr. Watson,

419
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,578
this should stop now.

420
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,043
But it's true.

421
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:53,338
It was all my fault.

422
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,091
Okay.

423
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:59,052
Then call your guardian.

424
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,344
Now.

425
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:12,023
Are you sure about what you're doing?

426
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:14,274
You're welcome.

427
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:16,611
Don't blame me for it.

428
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:19,322
You helped me, didn't you?

429
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:23,429
If you know you're gonna be
expelled for it, why did you do it?

430
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:24,701
No particular reason.

431
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:26,538
Do you want to get expelled?

432
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,790
I knew it.

433
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,490
Should I retract my statement?

434
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:36,506
If you want to... it's okay.

435
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,300
No need.

436
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,303
It really was my fault anyway.

437
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,433
Jay-jay!

438
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,459
What the hell did you do this time?

439
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:03,449
Unbelievable!

440
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,075
Promise?

441
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:06,661
Promise, my ass.

442
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,963
You're lucky I was
able to pull some strings.

443
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:13,545
But now, do you know you lost your chance
to transfer to another section?

444
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:15,420
Of course you know it.

445
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,421
Or maybe not.

446
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:17,338
I don't know.

447
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,630
You don't know.

448
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:20,842
You weren't expelled,

449
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:24,179
but the school guidance will monitor you
just like Keifer and Yuri.

450
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,347
You know Yuri?

451
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:27,849
Don't fucking change the topic.

452
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,481
You promised you won't
get into fights anymore.

453
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:32,770
But fuck, I forgot.

454
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:34,856
Promises are meant to be broken.

455
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:36,649
What would Mom say?

456
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:37,567
Auntie?

457
00:29:37,775 --> 00:29:38,775
And even Grandma.

458
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,737
And then there's Dad!

459
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:44,699
I should probably chain you to Aries,
so he can keep an eye on you.

460
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,785
I pulled strings to get
you into this school.

461
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,163
Ending, another record.

462
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:56,376
What's your plan?

463
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:58,337
Nothing of course.

464
00:29:58,505 --> 00:29:59,585
I already fixed it for you.

465
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,680
Jay-jay.

466
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:11,168
I hope you are aware of the
repercussions of your actions.

467
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,269
I'm sorry, Angelo.

468
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,897
I know you're covering up for Keifer.

469
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:16,940
Why?

470
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,691
Is he doing something to you?

471
00:30:18,816 --> 00:30:19,943
Is he threatening you?

472
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:21,527
No, Angelo.

473
00:30:21,819 --> 00:30:22,819
Then tell me the truth.

474
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:24,781
I know that Keifer.

475
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:27,909
It's true!

476
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:29,577
He actually helped me out.

477
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:37,502
I'm sorry...

478
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,920
Alright.

479
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:41,214
Let's just eat together.

480
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:42,874
Where you do you want to eat?

481
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,301
It's okay, Angelo. I'll eat at home.

482
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:46,802
No, let's go.

483
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:53,725
Sir, we have an urgent
meeting in 10 minutes.

484
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:55,769
You are needed at the office,

485
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,897
There's just an issue with the Macao team.
Can you make it Sir?

486
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:00,190
Okay, got it.

487
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,525
I'll go now.

488
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:05,946
Thank you, sir. We scheduled it
without you because it's urgent.

489
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:06,781
Okay.

490
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:07,740
I'll be there.

491
00:31:08,248 --> 00:31:12,657
I'm also still working on
the Hanamitchi appointment schedule, sir.

492
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:14,872
Close it immediately.

493
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:22,797
Jay-jay. I don't think we can go after all.
I have an urgent meeting to attend.

494
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:24,465
It's alright, Angelo.

495
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:28,845
I'm sorry. You're so busy
but you still went and helped me.

496
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:30,722
Alright. How about this?

497
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,015
I know you're hungry.

498
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,268
So I'll just drop you off at the
nearest mall. You can eat there.

499
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:37,145
It's fine, Angelo.

500
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:38,187
Really?

501
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:40,481
But you gotta eat. You're skin and bones.

502
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:42,317
But promise me.

503
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,527
Don't give us any more trouble.

504
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:45,694
Okay?

505
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:47,947
Avoid getting involved in fights.

506
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,074
Your studies is what's important.

507
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,410
Yes, Angelo. I promise.

508
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:55,746
Alright.

509
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,291
Here. Buy whatever you want.

510
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:00,877
You know how to use a credit card?

511
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,210
Yes.

512
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:04,129
Thank you, Angelo.

513
00:32:04,922 --> 00:32:05,922
Okay.

514
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,099
Mom, I'll just meet up with Ella.

515
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,769
Okay. Take care of yourself.

516
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,269
Oh. Hello, Auntie.

517
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:20,396
Jay-jay.

518
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:21,773
You went on a shopping spree?

519
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:22,857
And a new bike to boot.

520
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:25,902
Oh, yeah. So you don't
have to bring me to school.

521
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,113
How did you afford all that?

522
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:33,076
Angelo let me borrow his credit card.

523
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,327
He told me to buy whatever I want.

524
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,621
And you abused it.

525
00:32:40,428 --> 00:32:42,973
How did you and Angelo see each other?

526
00:32:43,978 --> 00:32:45,479
I was suspended.

527
00:32:46,964 --> 00:32:48,633
You got suspended and then went shopping?

528
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:51,302
I'm sorry...

529
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:54,888
But I bought the bike so
I can get to school easier.

530
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:57,892
It was the only thing I bought for myself.
All of these, I bought for you.

531
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,894
Bought with someone else's money?

532
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:07,484
Jay...

533
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:09,612
next time, ask permission properly.

534
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:10,988
I'm sorry, Auntie.

535
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,990
But Aries was right.

536
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:16,119
I was suspended, and then
I spent Angelo's money as if it was mine.

537
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:18,746
Why did you get suspended, by the way?

538
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:22,207
They started it! I was
just defending myself!

539
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:24,293
- Remember, you told me to.
- Alright!

540
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:27,088
It's okay. I understand.

541
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:29,257
But be careful.

542
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:31,758
Okay, Auntie.

543
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:33,928
Oh. Look at this, Auntie. It's so pretty.

544
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,846
- Is this mine?
- Yes, it's for you!

545
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,515
Oh my gosh, really?

546
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,392
- It's lovely, right?
- Wow!

547
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:41,853
Young master.

548
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,106
Hey.

549
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:46,106
Yuri.

550
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:48,443
What is this, a celebration
for your suspension?

551
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:49,776
Let's just drink.

552
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:52,572
Let's celebrate Jayjay
going along with our plan.

553
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:54,197
What happened?

554
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,365
Nothing.

555
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:01,122
Why did she take the blame at the
Guidance Office? What did you tell her?

556
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,289
I don't know.

557
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,042
The risk for expulsion paid off.

558
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,962
Or maybe, she's returning
the favor because...

559
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:10,798
I helped her fight those
boys from Section D.

560
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:12,674
Is it worth it?

561
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:17,263
If she didn't take the fall,
you could have been expelled.

562
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,390
But she took the blame, right?

563
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:23,436
And if it's against Aries,

564
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:24,979
it will all be worth it.

565
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:29,275
Now that we've tested
Jay-jay's loyalty to Section E,

566
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,486
We can use her against him.

567
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:34,071
Loyalty to Section E...

568
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:35,782
Or loyalty to you?

569
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:37,908
Why?

570
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:40,368
How about you?

571
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,121
You're doing things on your own.

572
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:45,750
You still haven't answered
why she was stranded at your place.

573
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,211
I have nothing to explain, right?

574
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:49,711
It rained.

575
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:50,754
It just happened.

576
00:34:54,091 --> 00:34:55,718
It probably helped our cause.

577
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,929
She did that little favor I asked of her.

578
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:00,014
All your faults...
she took the blame for it.

579
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:02,058
Without you even saying a thing to her.

580
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:04,267
I don't know.

581
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:07,864
It's just that you guys were laughing
when you entered the classroom.

582
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:10,191
Aren't we getting her loyalty?

583
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,794
It's party time!

584
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:33,421
[boys cheering]

585
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:35,091
Yes, sir!

586
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:39,762
- Yes, sir!
- Yuri, Keifer.

587
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,472
- Let's get drunk!
- Let's go.

588
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,683
Unlimited shots tonight,
bro. Unlimited shots!

589
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,685
Unli shots tonight.

590
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:47,102
Let's shot, dude!

591
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,103
Shot, shot, shot!

592
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:48,604
Let's go!

593
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:50,522
Alright, guys. Everyone. Wait up.

594
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:51,690
That one's vodka, bro.

595
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,317
Hey, listen. Listen, listen.

596
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:54,776
- Guys, guys, guys.
- Yo, he said listen.

597
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:55,777
Let's toast.

598
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,572
To Jay-jay.

599
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:59,407
And the downfall of Aries.

600
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:03,244
Cheers!

601
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:05,246
So bro, what's the plan?

602
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:07,665
How are we gonna use Jay-jay against Aries?

603
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:12,711
Well...

604
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:17,049
I've noticed how protective Aries
gets when Jay-jay gets hurt.

605
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,444
You saw how he acted
during that PE class, right?

606
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:21,804
- Yeah, that's right.
- It's a weak spot.

607
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:22,889
They're family.

608
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:25,016
We can use her against him.

609
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:28,352
So you're actually saying
na we're gonna hurt her?

610
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,438
What do you mean "hurt?"

611
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:35,958
I'm gonna make her fall in love with me.

612
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:38,905
That sounds new.

613
00:36:38,906 --> 00:36:40,823
And when she thinks I can protect her...

614
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,909
Aries won't stand a chance.

615
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,035
Then...

616
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:46,953
We can use her.

617
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,038
To destroy him.

618
00:36:48,205 --> 00:36:50,791
Woah. That's fire bro, huh.

619
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:52,335
Dope.

620
00:36:52,336 --> 00:36:54,587
It's getting spicy! Nice one.

621
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:56,505
What should I be doing?

622
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:58,215
I'll make her fall for me.

623
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:00,258
Dude...

624
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,553
It's all about the big gestures.

625
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:04,388
With girls...

626
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:07,892
They love the corny stuff.
The cheesier, the better.

627
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:09,977
They get butterflies.

628
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,355
I'm an expert at that.
You know, last week...

629
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:15,566
Hey, listen up! Last week, I had a date...

630
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:18,736
She got giddy at my corny
jokes and cheesy lines.

631
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:20,737
I swear to God, it worked.

632
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:23,073
You're just naturally corny.
What are you talking about?

633
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,282
But it really works!

634
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:24,951
No, no.

635
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:26,243
I know, I know.

636
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:29,830
Become a knight in shining armor.

637
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,375
Set up a fake problem,

638
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,919
and then save her and become her hero.

639
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:37,964
- Gotta flex your muscles, bro!
- Yeah!

640
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:41,216
Or! Or!

641
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,343
What is it this time?!

642
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,096
Buy her a bouquet of flowers.

643
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,680
- You really are corny.
- Nice, nice, nice.

644
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:47,723
Then put it in her bag.

645
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,642
I swear to God.

646
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:51,643
She'll get butterflies.

647
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:52,686
I swear.

648
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:54,562
Give me more ideas!

649
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:55,731
I have one.

650
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,940
Listen...

651
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:01,278
Put some sexual tension between
the two of you when you're together.

652
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,048
Only when you're alone with each other.

653
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:05,240
Or use the push-and-pull method.

654
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,367
Yeah, that's a great idea! I know that one!

655
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:10,036
- That's not what he meant!
- Oh, sorry.

656
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:14,040
What I mean by that is be sweet to her...

657
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:16,127
then pull back from time to time.

658
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:18,297
I swear, she won't be
able to get enough of you!

659
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:19,588
She'll go crazy for you.

660
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:20,755
It works.

661
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,008
I'm manipulative.

662
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:25,011
What else? Give me.

663
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:26,886
Suggestions, boys. Suggestions.

664
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:28,179
I was thinking...

665
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,640
maybe instead of just pretending...

666
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:32,393
What if... we doing
something really nice for her?

667
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:35,104
Show her we're on her side.

668
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:35,730
Right?

669
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:36,522
Simp!

670
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:38,398
[boys teasing]

671
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,900
- That's embarrassing.
- You're so corny.

672
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:42,361
No, no.

673
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:43,946
He's actually right.

674
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:47,074
I'll make her fall for me.
And then I'll break her heart.

675
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:49,868
Ohhh.

676
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:50,869
I told you, guys.

677
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,830
You're really on fire, bro.

678
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:55,874
Actually, bro.

679
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,904
I read somewhere that it's
"the little things that matter."

680
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:02,465
Like cleaning her
table or fixing her chair.

681
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:05,384
Bro, things like that get noticed more.

682
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,696
Sometimes, it difficult
to put things into words, right?

683
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,720
Just like you!

684
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:14,226
[boys teasing]

685
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:18,189
Cheers.

686
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,397
Let's get drunk tonight, boys!

687
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:21,025
Yeah, unli shots!

688
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:23,277
[Boys chattering]

689
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:36,373
Jay-jay!

690
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,667
Jay!

691
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:42,045
[Ci-N and David cheering]

692
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,423
- It's Jay-jay, bro!
- Jay-jay!

693
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:45,632
We miss you, Jay!

694
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:48,427
You're so pretty today, Jay.
Can I borrow money?

695
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:52,473
Did these jerks eat something funny today?
Why are they so friendly to me?

696
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:54,767
Missed you.

697
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,852
Am I seeing things right?

698
00:39:58,346 --> 00:40:01,057
The King of Assholes, smiling at me?

699
00:40:01,728 --> 00:40:02,812
What's he doing here?

700
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:04,317
Hey.

701
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:06,152
Hey.

702
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,114
What a mess.

703
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,493
- Give that to me.
- Oh... Ouch, it hurts.

704
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:14,452
My wallet is hurting.

705
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:16,247
- Your wallet?
- Yeah.

706
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:18,707
[groaning]

707
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:27,675
This seat's taken.

708
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,385
Find another one.

709
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,309
What's your problem?

710
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:39,727
Sit with me.

711
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:43,356
Come.

712
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,278
Huh?

713
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,005
Thanks.

714
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:28,360
Get that off.

715
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:09,420
Hey! Who's there?!

716
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:11,462
Ay!

717
00:43:11,786 --> 00:43:15,415
Don't tell Aries that I'm here.

718
00:43:15,708 --> 00:43:17,251
Oh... can you say this?

719
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:20,306
"Ella is a bitch."

720
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,970
Ella is a bitch.

721
00:43:21,995 --> 00:43:23,496
Oh! Confirmed!

722
00:43:23,731 --> 00:43:25,358
It was Freya who said it, not you.

723
00:43:26,128 --> 00:43:26,962
Why are you with her?

724
00:43:27,115 --> 00:43:28,115
Mica?

725
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:29,522
Uh-uh-uh!

726
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:30,860
Stay there!

727
00:43:30,969 --> 00:43:32,428
You must be 10 feet away from Mica.

728
00:43:32,808 --> 00:43:34,685
Step back! Step back!

729
00:43:34,866 --> 00:43:36,363
Move some more! Over there!

730
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:38,032
She can't stay here.

731
00:43:38,954 --> 00:43:40,200
Are you out of your mind?

732
00:43:40,617 --> 00:43:42,786
I can't let Section D
have their way with Mica!

733
00:43:42,811 --> 00:43:44,647
We can't meddle in their mess.

734
00:43:45,078 --> 00:43:46,078
Jay-jay?

735
00:43:47,213 --> 00:43:49,131
I just wanted to ask you a favor.

736
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,629
Don't let Calix get closer to Mica anymore.

737
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:53,838
Why?

738
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,174
I'm horrible...

739
00:43:55,175 --> 00:43:56,675
I'm such a jerk!

740
00:43:56,833 --> 00:43:57,593
Hey!

741
00:43:57,736 --> 00:43:58,779
What's wrong?

742
00:43:58,804 --> 00:44:01,265
We're doing a 500-meter run today, okay?

743
00:44:01,575 --> 00:44:02,701
Catch me!

744
00:44:03,136 --> 00:44:04,818
What is wrong with you?

745
00:44:05,678 --> 00:44:07,978
Spin her around until
her face turns violet!
