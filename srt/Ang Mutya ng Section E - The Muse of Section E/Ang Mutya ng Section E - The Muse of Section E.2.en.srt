1
00:00:14,563 --> 00:00:16,481
This is it. Our new beginning.

2
00:00:17,232 --> 00:00:19,568
I'm not gonna cause any trouble here.

3
00:00:20,444 --> 00:00:21,590
Excuse me?

4
00:00:21,903 --> 00:00:23,103
Is this the room of Section E?

5
00:00:25,115 --> 00:00:27,284
- But the guy said...
- Are you deaf?

6
00:00:27,576 --> 00:00:28,160
Leave!

7
00:00:28,452 --> 00:00:29,827
Someone pointed me to the wrong direction.

8
00:00:29,828 --> 00:00:31,163
I'm Jasper Jean Mariano.

9
00:00:31,413 --> 00:00:32,413
You can call me Jay-jay.

10
00:00:32,623 --> 00:00:36,043
Mr. President, don't you have anything
to ask about our new transferee?

11
00:00:36,168 --> 00:00:37,168
Are you still a virgin?

12
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:39,546
The teacher is asking
for appropriate questions.

13
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:40,630
Your IQ is probably low.

14
00:00:41,673 --> 00:00:43,550
Who keeps throwing things at me?

15
00:00:43,634 --> 00:00:45,135
3, 2, 1!

16
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:49,306
How's Section E treating you so far?

17
00:00:49,723 --> 00:00:51,725
They're okay. They're being nice to me.

18
00:00:51,975 --> 00:00:53,226
You'll fit right in Section E.

19
00:00:53,894 --> 00:00:54,269
Hey.

20
00:00:54,603 --> 00:00:55,687
Yuri...

21
00:00:55,896 --> 00:00:57,736
Why are you treating
my classmates like dogs?

22
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:00,301
You're glued.

23
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,652
You'll regret not following me.

24
00:01:01,818 --> 00:01:03,654
1... 2... 3!

25
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,030
Hey, Keifer!

26
00:01:06,323 --> 00:01:08,492
Do you think you can just
kick me out of your section?

27
00:01:08,742 --> 00:01:09,742
You wish.

28
00:01:11,453 --> 00:01:12,954
Game on!

29
00:01:17,292 --> 00:01:18,542
"Game on?"

30
00:01:18,543 --> 00:01:20,212
Really, Jay-jay?

31
00:01:20,504 --> 00:01:22,464
Why did you have to say that?

32
00:01:22,881 --> 00:01:25,467
The King of Assholes will
surely strike back at you.

33
00:01:26,176 --> 00:01:27,552
What are you gonna do now?

34
00:01:29,054 --> 00:01:30,054
Jay-jay?

35
00:01:30,806 --> 00:01:31,348
Jay-jay!

36
00:01:31,682 --> 00:01:32,099
Oh.

37
00:01:32,474 --> 00:01:33,474
Are we here?

38
00:01:33,642 --> 00:01:34,642
I'm sorry...

39
00:01:35,102 --> 00:01:36,102
Oh.

40
00:01:36,645 --> 00:01:40,023
Thank you, Ci-N. Good
thing you have an extra jacket.

41
00:01:41,149 --> 00:01:42,749
Wait for me here. I'll just get changed.

42
00:01:42,776 --> 00:01:44,462
No, it's fine. I just
wanted to take you home.

43
00:01:44,486 --> 00:01:45,486
How about your jacket?

44
00:01:45,654 --> 00:01:46,654
I have lots at home.

45
00:01:48,073 --> 00:01:49,073
Thank you, Ci-N.

46
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,700
Alright.

47
00:01:50,992 --> 00:01:52,352
-Take care.
- Go inside.

48
00:01:53,245 --> 00:01:53,954
Thanks again!

49
00:01:54,246 --> 00:01:55,678
- Just get inside already!
- Alright.

50
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:57,910
Take care.

51
00:01:58,417 --> 00:01:59,417
See you!

52
00:02:00,377 --> 00:02:02,753
Oh, I didn't see you there.
Are they here already?

53
00:02:02,754 --> 00:02:04,423
Yes, they're already eating.

54
00:02:06,508 --> 00:02:08,092
Yeah, that's the guy. Definitely him.

55
00:02:08,093 --> 00:02:09,094
So, that's him, huh?

56
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:11,929
Hey.

57
00:02:12,556 --> 00:02:15,116
You think we'll let you get away
with what you did to our friend?

58
00:02:15,972 --> 00:02:16,643
Not really.

59
00:02:16,852 --> 00:02:17,995
Wipe that smirk off your face

60
00:02:18,019 --> 00:02:20,522
I don't think you'll be able to smile
when we're done with you.

61
00:02:20,647 --> 00:02:22,064
Even the toothless can smile.

62
00:02:22,065 --> 00:02:23,817
What more for a guy with all his teeth?

63
00:02:24,109 --> 00:02:25,610
The girl you were with earlier...

64
00:02:26,361 --> 00:02:27,361
She's pretty.

65
00:02:27,988 --> 00:02:29,788
When we're through
with you, is it cool if...

66
00:02:30,323 --> 00:02:31,408
we get her next?

67
00:02:36,663 --> 00:02:37,663
You talk too much.

68
00:02:38,206 --> 00:02:39,249
Where do we take this?

69
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:41,709
Shut up!

70
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:44,296
Don't ever do that again.

71
00:02:44,713 --> 00:02:46,590
Or else I'll take drastic measures.

72
00:02:48,383 --> 00:02:51,010
You can't run away from home
just because you can't stand...

73
00:02:51,011 --> 00:02:52,011
Jay-jay!

74
00:02:52,637 --> 00:02:54,014
Come, let's eat.

75
00:02:54,556 --> 00:02:55,556
There's lots of food.

76
00:02:55,891 --> 00:02:57,641
- Good evening, Auntie.
- Good evening.

77
00:02:57,642 --> 00:02:58,727
Good evening, Angelo.

78
00:03:01,062 --> 00:03:02,189
Good evening, Aries...

79
00:03:04,232 --> 00:03:05,232
Sit down.

80
00:03:05,942 --> 00:03:06,942
Go ahead.

81
00:03:08,153 --> 00:03:09,362
Look. There's so much chicken.

82
00:03:09,946 --> 00:03:12,407
Starting tomorrow,
you'll drive Jay-jay to school.

83
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:20,039
I think I'd rather walk...

84
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,040
No!

85
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:22,368
You'll go to school together.

86
00:03:24,002 --> 00:03:27,380
Since it's decided now,
let's go ahead and eat.

87
00:03:28,089 --> 00:03:29,089
Dig in.

88
00:03:29,341 --> 00:03:30,341
Chicken?

89
00:03:31,134 --> 00:03:32,219
Come, eat up.

90
00:03:33,178 --> 00:03:33,845
Thank you.

91
00:03:34,179 --> 00:03:35,179
Here, son.

92
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,934
The food's delicious.

93
00:03:40,018 --> 00:03:41,018
Want some rice?

94
00:03:41,102 --> 00:03:42,102
No, Ma. Thanks.

95
00:03:53,073 --> 00:03:54,073
Aries?

96
00:03:56,034 --> 00:03:57,493
I know you're mad at me.

97
00:03:57,494 --> 00:03:59,078
I just want to apologize for...

98
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:01,498
Jay-jay. Your sorry won't change anything.

99
00:04:02,749 --> 00:04:05,251
I know that. But I just
want to say sorry...

100
00:04:05,252 --> 00:04:06,252
Just get in the car.

101
00:04:06,503 --> 00:04:07,503
Get in!

102
00:04:26,147 --> 00:04:28,108
Aries... I can just walk to school.

103
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,569
You should know,
anger takes time to heal.

104
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:32,979
Just follow everything Angelo says.

105
00:04:33,462 --> 00:04:34,880
Maybe he'll change his mind.

106
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:39,494
I hope so.

107
00:04:42,873 --> 00:04:45,708
[students chatter]

108
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:48,670
- Why is the liver unbeatable?
- Why?

109
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:51,423
Because it's a tie!

110
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,305
God, I'm reminded by it again.

111
00:05:01,048 --> 00:05:02,601
Where's that kid?

112
00:05:04,436 --> 00:05:05,728
Woah! There's chocolate!

113
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:06,605
Thank you!

114
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:07,647
Have you got no shame?

115
00:05:08,106 --> 00:05:10,150
Why? I helped you yesterday, didn't I?

116
00:05:10,859 --> 00:05:11,939
Alright. You can have that.

117
00:05:12,193 --> 00:05:13,444
How about me?

118
00:05:13,445 --> 00:05:14,445
You don't get to have one.

119
00:05:14,446 --> 00:05:17,406
He's the only one who helped me.
And I saw you laughing at me.

120
00:05:17,407 --> 00:05:19,075
You really like bringing food.

121
00:05:19,451 --> 00:05:20,451
And so?

122
00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:22,537
Then I have a task for you.

123
00:05:28,877 --> 00:05:29,877
What's this?

124
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:32,464
Our order.

125
00:05:34,716 --> 00:05:35,716
This is neat!

126
00:05:36,176 --> 00:05:37,636
It's even longer than a loan list!

127
00:05:37,886 --> 00:05:40,639
- What? Is she for real?
- Hey Drew, she's taking a swipe at you!

128
00:05:52,108 --> 00:05:53,360
I already told you, "no."

129
00:05:54,069 --> 00:05:55,069
What did you say?

130
00:05:55,278 --> 00:05:57,447
What makes you think
that I will follow you? Huh?

131
00:05:59,407 --> 00:06:00,407
Simple.

132
00:06:02,577 --> 00:06:04,871
You won't like it when we get hungry.

133
00:06:05,622 --> 00:06:06,998
We bite.

134
00:06:07,374 --> 00:06:09,334
And... if we get hungry...

135
00:06:11,211 --> 00:06:12,796
We might just feast on you.

136
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,560
What?

137
00:06:29,062 --> 00:06:30,062
Are you game?

138
00:06:31,815 --> 00:06:32,899
Game...

139
00:06:35,986 --> 00:06:39,906
[students teasing]

140
00:06:43,163 --> 00:06:44,873
Hey! You're spitting all over me!

141
00:06:44,995 --> 00:06:46,162
One-five.

142
00:06:46,871 --> 00:06:47,871
Pay up!

143
00:06:47,956 --> 00:06:49,124
I'll give it later.

144
00:08:15,126 --> 00:08:16,585
Get out of the way!

145
00:08:16,586 --> 00:08:17,712
I'm sorry.

146
00:08:18,129 --> 00:08:20,049
This is only for today,
Jay-jay. Just for today.

147
00:08:20,256 --> 00:08:23,051
We're not supposed
to give up easily, right?

148
00:08:24,677 --> 00:08:25,678
[irritated groan]

149
00:08:26,262 --> 00:08:27,263
What a mess.

150
00:08:28,348 --> 00:08:31,101
Why did he have to
give me such a large bill?

151
00:08:31,267 --> 00:08:33,228
She's so lucky to be around Keifer.

152
00:08:33,353 --> 00:08:35,105
I bet she'll ask to be transferred.

153
00:08:35,313 --> 00:08:37,398
I actually saw her with Ci-N too.

154
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:38,817
What a slut.

155
00:08:39,901 --> 00:08:41,819
Hey, you wanna watch a movie after school?

156
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,820
Sure, babe!

157
00:08:44,906 --> 00:08:46,532
That asshole just had to flex his cash.

158
00:08:46,533 --> 00:08:48,201
Jay-jay. What is that?

159
00:08:52,122 --> 00:08:53,122
Uh... this is...

160
00:08:53,581 --> 00:08:55,250
Is that for Section E?

161
00:08:58,253 --> 00:08:59,878
Sorry, Aries, but I have to go.

162
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:00,879
Put it back.

163
00:09:02,257 --> 00:09:03,257
I said, put it back!

164
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:04,299
Sorry.

165
00:09:04,467 --> 00:09:05,467
Jay-jay!

Keifer!

167
00:09:14,869 --> 00:09:16,329
Your food's here.

168
00:09:16,813 --> 00:09:17,813
And here's your change.

Come here. Let's all eat together.

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,151
Time to eat. I'll share with you.

188
00:10:34,307 --> 00:10:35,350
You don't like this?

189
00:10:39,062 --> 00:10:40,980
Have this instead if you
don't want a sandwich.

190
00:10:49,697 --> 00:10:51,574
Thank you bro, this is so good!

191
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,083
What's his problem?

192
00:11:01,793 --> 00:11:04,254
Go on, eat up.
You have training later, right?

193
00:11:05,421 --> 00:11:06,421
Felix.

194
00:11:07,215 --> 00:11:08,495
Do you have Ci-N's phone number?

195
00:11:08,633 --> 00:11:09,633
Yes, why?

196
00:11:10,134 --> 00:11:12,387
Give it to me. Here.

197
00:11:16,391 --> 00:11:18,518
- Here you go.
- Put yours in as well.

198
00:11:18,977 --> 00:11:20,687
Oh. Alright.

199
00:11:24,482 --> 00:11:26,442
Wait... let me get your number.

200
00:11:27,235 --> 00:11:28,444
It's there in the phone.

201
00:11:31,572 --> 00:11:32,572
Thank you.

202
00:11:32,573 --> 00:11:33,783
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

203
00:11:35,618 --> 00:11:38,288
[students chattering]

204
00:11:40,373 --> 00:11:41,456
This is mine.

205
00:11:41,457 --> 00:11:44,627
My goodness. Why don't
you know the answers?

206
00:11:46,337 --> 00:11:47,839
John Felix Collins?

207
00:11:49,052 --> 00:11:51,138
- That's you, man.
- Stand up.

208
00:11:52,719 --> 00:11:55,763
Uh... I'm sorry, ma'am.
I also don't know the answer.

209
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,057
You too don't know the answer?

210
00:11:59,058 --> 00:12:00,059
Remain standing.

211
00:12:03,229 --> 00:12:06,357
Jasper Jean Fernandez - Mariano.

212
00:12:08,609 --> 00:12:09,819
Fernandez?

213
00:12:14,157 --> 00:12:15,157
Ma'am...

214
00:12:15,617 --> 00:12:18,036
Are you related to Aries Fernandez?

215
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:24,541
Yes, ma'am.

216
00:12:28,254 --> 00:12:29,297
What?

217
00:12:29,669 --> 00:12:31,629
How are you related to Aries?

218
00:12:34,385 --> 00:12:35,845
He's my cousin.

219
00:12:46,539 --> 00:12:49,458
So, Miss Mariano,
you don't know the answer as well?

220
00:12:50,568 --> 00:12:51,569
No I don't, maam.

221
00:12:55,981 --> 00:12:58,734
You are all hopeless, guys.

222
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,415
How about Joshua Venites?

223
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,418
I also don't know, ma'am...

224
00:13:09,128 --> 00:13:11,339
Andrew Klondike Mercado.

225
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,418
I don't know the answer, ma'am.

226
00:13:15,551 --> 00:13:17,178
Why don't you know?

227
00:13:18,471 --> 00:13:19,721
Rory Abejar.

228
00:13:19,722 --> 00:13:21,224
I don't know the answer, ma'am.

229
00:13:26,312 --> 00:13:27,897
Dude, let's go. Quick!

230
00:13:28,606 --> 00:13:29,857
Game, game, game!

231
00:13:29,941 --> 00:13:31,192
Let me join.

232
00:13:33,736 --> 00:13:34,903
He said he's joining.

233
00:13:35,154 --> 00:13:35,655
Why?

234
00:13:35,905 --> 00:13:37,203
Guys, I'm heading out. Bye!

235
00:13:37,448 --> 00:13:38,448
Alright, take care.

236
00:13:38,512 --> 00:13:40,367
Losers can't join this game.

237
00:13:40,368 --> 00:13:41,661
What do you mean "loser?"

238
00:13:44,497 --> 00:13:46,249
What's happening here?

239
00:13:49,168 --> 00:13:50,461
I don't stink.

240
00:13:50,628 --> 00:13:51,628
Felix.

241
00:13:51,671 --> 00:13:52,671
Hey, Felix.

242
00:13:52,797 --> 00:13:53,798
Hey! Felix.

243
00:13:54,507 --> 00:13:57,218
Felix, do you want some?
Don't want my chocolate to go to waste.

244
00:13:57,593 --> 00:13:58,593
Hey, Felix, hurry up.

245
00:13:59,137 --> 00:14:00,680
Let's go outside.

246
00:14:02,974 --> 00:14:05,101
Move quickly. The game's about to begin.

247
00:14:05,309 --> 00:14:06,869
Let's do it outside, it's much quicker.

248
00:14:07,937 --> 00:14:09,272
What's going on?

249
00:14:10,314 --> 00:14:11,858
Why did the tides suddenly turn?

250
00:14:14,193 --> 00:14:16,278
- That's insane, bro. He's good.
- Yes bro.

251
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:18,156
You know, I admit I
can't do that. Impressive.

252
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:30,167
That's it?

253
00:14:30,751 --> 00:14:31,919
He's not going to bully me?

254
00:14:33,171 --> 00:14:34,589
What is happening?

255
00:14:35,381 --> 00:14:37,758
Why did they stop caring all of a sudden?

256
00:14:43,764 --> 00:14:46,100
Hello! Ci-N! It's me!

257
00:14:46,392 --> 00:14:47,392
And who are you?

258
00:14:47,602 --> 00:14:50,562
It's Jay-jay! What's up with you?
Why are you skipping classes?

259
00:14:50,563 --> 00:14:52,940
Excuse me. Could you please
not scream on the phone?

260
00:14:53,274 --> 00:14:56,026
I'm sorry. What happened to you?

261
00:14:56,027 --> 00:14:57,611
I'm not feeling very well.

262
00:14:57,612 --> 00:14:59,988
- Huh?
- Why? Are you missing me so much?

263
00:14:59,989 --> 00:15:01,699
No, are you crazy?

264
00:15:01,908 --> 00:15:03,116
Oh, really?

265
00:15:03,117 --> 00:15:04,159
Okay then. Bye.

266
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,538
Wait! I just wanted to know if you're okay.

267
00:15:07,914 --> 00:15:09,373
When will you go back to school?

268
00:15:09,624 --> 00:15:11,375
So you admit that you missed me?

269
00:15:11,751 --> 00:15:13,461
I'll probably go back to school next week.

270
00:15:13,878 --> 00:15:16,464
Huh? What happened to you?

271
00:15:17,298 --> 00:15:18,298
Nothing.

272
00:15:18,508 --> 00:15:20,551
I just don't feel well.

273
00:15:20,635 --> 00:15:21,719
Why are you pushing it?

274
00:15:21,802 --> 00:15:24,262
What do you mean by
"not feeling very well?"

275
00:15:24,263 --> 00:15:26,891
Next week is too long. What's your illness?

276
00:15:27,183 --> 00:15:28,851
My ingrown is hurting.

277
00:15:29,018 --> 00:15:31,646
It's hopeless talking to you,
Ci-N! Annoying!

278
00:15:32,313 --> 00:15:33,497
I'll just see you
when I see you, Jay.

279
00:15:33,522 --> 00:15:36,108
Wait, it's because Keifer
and the others were...

280
00:15:46,369 --> 00:15:47,036
Oh, Aries!

281
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:48,370
What?

282
00:15:48,871 --> 00:15:49,871
Umm...

283
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,290
What?

284
00:15:53,334 --> 00:15:55,044
Did you do something against Section E?

285
00:15:56,504 --> 00:15:58,673
Me? Do something against Section E?

286
00:15:59,048 --> 00:16:00,048
Are you serious?

287
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,426
Then why aren't they talking to me?

288
00:16:02,802 --> 00:16:06,347
I'm not the one to ask
why there are rotten apples out there.

289
00:16:07,765 --> 00:16:08,933
It's because...

290
00:16:10,184 --> 00:16:13,896
they've started treating me differently
when they learned that I'm a Fernandez.

291
00:16:14,605 --> 00:16:15,398
I don't know.

292
00:16:15,398 --> 00:16:16,357
Maybe it's because of Angelo.

293
00:16:16,358 --> 00:16:17,733
He's a Fernandez too.

294
00:16:19,527 --> 00:16:21,319
But you were the one
they were asking me about.

295
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,531
If you and I are related.

296
00:16:23,864 --> 00:16:25,324
Jay-jay, I have no idea.

297
00:16:25,741 --> 00:16:28,201
Why don't you ask them directly
what their problem is with you?

298
00:16:28,202 --> 00:16:29,203
Don't bother me.

299
00:16:40,423 --> 00:16:43,342
Guys, I got her school records.

300
00:16:43,718 --> 00:16:45,261
The first was from the principal.

301
00:16:45,761 --> 00:16:47,597
The other was from her previous school.

302
00:16:48,222 --> 00:16:51,726
There's not much information about her
from HVIS as of late...

303
00:16:52,059 --> 00:16:53,819
because she just
started here, of course.

304
00:16:54,312 --> 00:16:57,315
But if you check her
previous school records...

305
00:16:58,441 --> 00:16:59,441
Damn!

306
00:17:01,068 --> 00:17:02,570
Stabbed a classmate with a pencil?

307
00:17:02,945 --> 00:17:03,945
Seriously?

308
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,364
Punched another student?

309
00:17:07,325 --> 00:17:08,325
Wow.

310
00:17:08,367 --> 00:17:10,202
She really fits right in Section E.

311
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:12,622
So far, that's all I saw.

312
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,070
Check if there's anything else.

313
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:19,253
Guys, guys. Guess what?

314
00:17:20,254 --> 00:17:23,466
I found out that Aries' and Jay-jay's
mothers are half-sisters.

315
00:17:24,133 --> 00:17:25,384
They have a broken family.

316
00:17:25,843 --> 00:17:27,428
Her father is nowhere to be found.

317
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,847
And her mother has been
married multiple times.

318
00:17:30,056 --> 00:17:31,376
She grew up with her grandmother.

319
00:17:31,807 --> 00:17:33,434
But this is the most important part.

320
00:17:33,726 --> 00:17:37,313
Recently, she has been
taken in by Aries' mother.

321
00:17:38,481 --> 00:17:41,108
So it's possible that she's
spying on us for Aries.

322
00:17:41,943 --> 00:17:43,194
Bro, what the fuck.

323
00:17:43,611 --> 00:17:44,611
Possible.

324
00:17:44,654 --> 00:17:49,158
Do you really think it was his idea to
put his troublemaker cousin in our section?

325
00:18:00,753 --> 00:18:05,675
Okay, everyone. On our next session,
we will be applying the lectures.

326
00:18:06,175 --> 00:18:07,175
Yes, ma'am.

327
00:18:07,176 --> 00:18:08,010
Okay, ma'am.

328
00:18:08,011 --> 00:18:10,179
They've been ignoring me for a week.

329
00:18:10,781 --> 00:18:13,407
- I wonder what these assholes have been planning for me?
- By the way, class.

330
00:18:13,432 --> 00:18:15,476
Don't forget to clean up before you go.

331
00:18:15,768 --> 00:18:17,812
Sir Alvin asked me to
remind you. Or else...

332
00:18:18,604 --> 00:18:20,231
So, clean up this room.

333
00:18:21,065 --> 00:18:22,108
See you tomorrow.

334
00:18:22,483 --> 00:18:24,402
- Okay, ma'am.
- See you.

335
00:18:29,365 --> 00:18:31,534
I'll go home now.

336
00:18:33,911 --> 00:18:35,955
- Where do we go tonight?
- Dinner?

337
00:18:37,248 --> 00:18:39,041
Seems like nobody is planning to clean.

338
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:40,543
Everybody's going out.

339
00:18:42,586 --> 00:18:44,295
Hey. We were told to clean up.

340
00:18:44,296 --> 00:18:45,672
Are you expecting me to do it alone again?

341
00:18:45,673 --> 00:18:46,673
What's wrong with you?!

342
00:18:48,384 --> 00:18:49,426
Go ahead, lock her up.

343
00:18:49,427 --> 00:18:52,138
[students chuckling]

344
00:18:52,471 --> 00:18:55,808
If you will force me to clean,
you could at least stop ignoring me!

345
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:58,310
Just clean up so you can leave.

346
00:19:00,688 --> 00:19:03,107
I'm getting bullied on
top of being ignored.

347
00:19:07,611 --> 00:19:09,739
So, what are we gonna do with Jay-jay?

348
00:19:10,281 --> 00:19:11,490
We need to get rid of her.

349
00:19:12,742 --> 00:19:13,742
But how?

350
00:19:14,326 --> 00:19:16,704
Your "pretend she doesn't exist"
plan didn't seem to work.

351
00:19:17,288 --> 00:19:19,874
She's such a badass.
You're no match for her.

352
00:19:20,082 --> 00:19:21,333
No fucking way!

353
00:19:22,334 --> 00:19:25,463
We just have to make her life miserable
until she decides to leave on her own.

354
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:32,970
Oh, really? Then they will wait in vain.

355
00:19:34,472 --> 00:19:36,348
They think they can get rid of me easily?

356
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,640
Watch me.

357
00:19:39,685 --> 00:19:41,145
So full of themselves.

358
00:19:43,939 --> 00:19:44,939
Oops.

359
00:19:46,192 --> 00:19:47,193
Still dirty here.

360
00:19:49,195 --> 00:19:50,946
You forgot the trash.

361
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:53,783
Was that funny to you?

362
00:19:54,241 --> 00:19:55,034
Are you amused?

363
00:19:55,242 --> 00:19:55,826
Yeah.

364
00:19:56,202 --> 00:19:57,202
It's funny.

365
00:20:00,372 --> 00:20:01,373
Clean it.

366
00:20:10,007 --> 00:20:11,258
Do you think you're cool?

367
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,886
Is this what you want?

368
00:20:14,762 --> 00:20:17,889
Come on!

369
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:22,769
There! Trash! Go clean it up!

370
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:23,938
Stop it!

371
00:20:24,104 --> 00:20:25,563
He's the only one who can make a scene?

372
00:20:25,564 --> 00:20:27,608
I refuse! You all have to clean!

373
00:20:28,108 --> 00:20:29,108
Alright.

374
00:20:30,069 --> 00:20:31,403
We're gonna clean up too.

375
00:20:31,529 --> 00:20:32,529
Wait...

376
00:20:32,655 --> 00:20:34,090
Why are we getting dragged into this?

377
00:20:34,114 --> 00:20:35,574
We're not involved in that mess.

378
00:20:35,699 --> 00:20:37,909
I'm the class president.
I don't clean.

379
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:39,953
And so what if you're the class president?

380
00:20:39,954 --> 00:20:42,580
That doesn't exempt you from cleaning!

381
00:20:42,581 --> 00:20:43,123
What the f...

382
00:20:43,124 --> 00:20:45,291
A class president that is
exempted from cleaning?

383
00:20:45,292 --> 00:20:46,876
Wow. Dictator much?

384
00:20:46,877 --> 00:20:48,586
You're the one who made
this mess in the first place!

385
00:20:48,587 --> 00:20:50,713
Yes, I made this mess! So what?

386
00:20:50,714 --> 00:20:52,216
Want more?

387
00:20:52,675 --> 00:20:53,884
Here you go!

388
00:20:54,385 --> 00:20:57,012
Alright. Make a mess. Go ahead.

389
00:20:57,137 --> 00:20:59,138
You think I won't stand up to you?

390
00:20:59,139 --> 00:21:00,306
In your face, Mr. Class President.

391
00:21:00,823 --> 00:21:03,726
Go ahead, make a mess! Do it!

392
00:21:03,727 --> 00:21:05,139
You think I'm scared of you?

393
00:21:06,021 --> 00:21:07,022
Just clean up too.

394
00:21:07,064 --> 00:21:08,064
Why?

395
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:13,570
We don't know yet what
that girl is scheming.

396
00:21:13,571 --> 00:21:16,657
Aries might have sent her to mess with us.

397
00:21:20,244 --> 00:21:21,745
David's coming back, right?

398
00:21:35,259 --> 00:21:36,385
Start cleaning!

399
00:21:46,145 --> 00:21:47,229
So fun, isn't it?

400
00:21:51,901 --> 00:21:52,901
Fun?

401
00:21:53,193 --> 00:21:56,071
I wouldn't exactly say being
locked in here with you is fun.

402
00:21:56,614 --> 00:21:58,198
But isn't this your fault?

403
00:21:59,533 --> 00:22:00,533
My fault?

404
00:22:01,285 --> 00:22:03,370
You're the one who threw trash at me.

405
00:22:03,746 --> 00:22:04,413
And why?

406
00:22:04,747 --> 00:22:05,747
Who did it first?

407
00:22:05,915 --> 00:22:07,791
That was you, Mr. Class President.

408
00:22:17,885 --> 00:22:19,345
Who is David, anyway?

409
00:22:25,476 --> 00:22:26,518
David was...

410
00:22:28,854 --> 00:22:30,689
the original class president.

411
00:22:31,982 --> 00:22:33,734
Ah, original.

412
00:22:34,193 --> 00:22:36,153
So, you stole that position from him?

413
00:22:41,033 --> 00:22:42,033
I have a question.

414
00:22:45,788 --> 00:22:46,788
What is it now?

415
00:22:48,207 --> 00:22:51,043
Why did you avoid me when you learned
that Aries is my cousin?

416
00:23:09,728 --> 00:23:10,980
Aries, stop the car!!!

417
00:23:11,146 --> 00:23:11,730
What?

418
00:23:11,939 --> 00:23:12,982
Is that Ci-N?

419
00:23:13,399 --> 00:23:14,441
It is him.

420
00:23:14,525 --> 00:23:15,818
I'm gonna get off here.

421
00:23:16,318 --> 00:23:19,028
Make sure Angelo
knows I took you to school.

422
00:23:19,029 --> 00:23:19,905
Of course!

423
00:23:19,905 --> 00:23:20,905
Ci-N!

424
00:23:21,532 --> 00:23:22,532
Ci-N!

425
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:25,828
What are you up to?

426
00:23:26,662 --> 00:23:28,622
- Good thing you're coming back to school!
- Ouch.

427
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,541
Take care!

428
00:23:33,043 --> 00:23:34,628
You seem wrecked.

429
00:23:35,462 --> 00:23:37,089
You got so many wounds and bruises.

430
00:23:37,464 --> 00:23:38,465
This is nothing.

431
00:23:38,757 --> 00:23:39,757
I fell on my face.

432
00:23:40,009 --> 00:23:42,803
Fell? What did the pavement do, punch you?

433
00:23:44,096 --> 00:23:45,096
Here.

434
00:23:45,264 --> 00:23:47,306
I always have this in my bag. Use it.

435
00:23:47,307 --> 00:23:49,351
No need for that.

436
00:23:49,893 --> 00:23:50,894
Jay-jay, this is nothing.

437
00:23:51,186 --> 00:23:52,604
You're worrying too much.

438
00:23:53,063 --> 00:23:54,064
You're overacting.

439
00:23:54,898 --> 00:23:55,898
Then don't.

440
00:23:58,277 --> 00:23:59,528
By the way, Ci-N.

441
00:24:00,154 --> 00:24:01,864
Something happened with Section E.

442
00:24:02,239 --> 00:24:03,824
That's not news to me.

443
00:24:04,366 --> 00:24:05,868
No. This is different.

444
00:24:06,744 --> 00:24:07,995
It's Keifer...

445
00:24:08,871 --> 00:24:09,871
What happened?

446
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:12,708
I'm a Fernandez.

447
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:16,045
Jasper Jean Fernandez Mariano.

448
00:24:17,296 --> 00:24:18,672
Aries and I are cousins.

449
00:24:19,214 --> 00:24:20,214
So I've heard.

450
00:24:21,735 --> 00:24:23,485
Then will you...

451
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,012
avoid me now too?

452
00:24:30,768 --> 00:24:31,769
Of course not.

453
00:24:32,686 --> 00:24:33,729
Why would I do that?

454
00:24:35,522 --> 00:24:36,690
Thank you, Ci-N.

455
00:24:37,941 --> 00:24:40,652
But what if the others see
that you're talking to me?

456
00:24:41,195 --> 00:24:43,739
I'll just tell them I was not
aware you're a Fernandez.

457
00:24:43,906 --> 00:24:44,531
Easy.

458
00:24:44,532 --> 00:24:47,785
- You're so good.
- Of course.

459
00:24:48,035 --> 00:24:49,161
You're my idol.

460
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:54,707
[students screaming]

461
00:24:54,708 --> 00:24:56,085
What's going on here?

462
00:24:57,961 --> 00:24:59,922
Yeah! Go punch him in the face!

463
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:03,550
I didn't recognize him.
It's just David.

464
00:25:07,513 --> 00:25:08,847
Why is there a girl here?

465
00:25:09,014 --> 00:25:10,848
Go on! Fight!

466
00:25:10,849 --> 00:25:14,268
[continuous cheering]

467
00:25:14,269 --> 00:25:15,269
You know, I think we
better get out of here.

468
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,270
You're still full of wounds.

469
00:25:16,271 --> 00:25:19,024
- Get out of here.
- Wait, let's finish watching this first.

470
00:25:19,358 --> 00:25:22,736
Shouldn't we get out of the way?
Or at least stop them?

471
00:25:22,986 --> 00:25:24,822
They wouldn't listen to us anyway.

472
00:25:25,114 --> 00:25:25,948
Wanna try?

473
00:25:26,073 --> 00:25:26,865
Go and stop them.

474
00:25:26,949 --> 00:25:27,949
Fight!!!

475
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:30,159
Punch him!

476
00:25:31,495 --> 00:25:33,288
Will you please stop this?!

477
00:25:34,289 --> 00:25:35,457
- Ouch!
- What the hell?

478
00:25:36,125 --> 00:25:37,417
No stopping!

479
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,310
What the fuck?

480
00:26:00,899 --> 00:26:01,899
Did you throw that?

481
00:26:01,942 --> 00:26:02,942
Yes, she did!

482
00:26:03,777 --> 00:26:04,777
Don't you dare meddle!

483
00:26:05,058 --> 00:26:07,632
If I get injured, will you take me
to the hospital, huh?

484
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:09,401
Aren't I your opponent?

485
00:26:09,491 --> 00:26:10,784
Stop it!

486
00:26:13,537 --> 00:26:14,830
Let's have a re-election.

487
00:26:15,122 --> 00:26:17,541
Where it's more organized
and no one will cheat.

488
00:26:17,749 --> 00:26:18,876
Whoever wins...

489
00:26:19,001 --> 00:26:20,627
will be the class president.

490
00:26:21,295 --> 00:26:22,421
Fair and square.

491
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:24,423
I'm game with that.

492
00:26:25,424 --> 00:26:28,135
As long as no one will
throw chairs, or garbage.

493
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,386
Game.

494
00:26:29,595 --> 00:26:31,930
And why would I throw things
during class elections?

495
00:26:33,056 --> 00:26:35,475
Alright. Later, after class.

496
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:38,604
Let's arrange the room
before Sir Alvin gets here.

497
00:26:40,314 --> 00:26:42,232
How lame. It was already getting exciting.

498
00:26:42,733 --> 00:26:44,526
It's a waste of money.

499
00:26:48,238 --> 00:26:49,573
Hey, Ci-N.

500
00:26:50,324 --> 00:26:52,618
What's up with that re-election thing?

501
00:26:52,951 --> 00:26:53,951
Just you wait.

502
00:26:54,286 --> 00:26:55,745
It's better when it's a surprise.

503
00:26:55,746 --> 00:26:57,372
Just tell me.

504
00:26:57,998 --> 00:26:58,665
Fine.

505
00:26:58,916 --> 00:26:59,916
It's just...

506
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:01,125
a fair match.

507
00:27:01,543 --> 00:27:02,836
Just see for yourself later.

508
00:27:03,545 --> 00:27:05,464
The only thing you need to know...

509
00:27:05,756 --> 00:27:07,758
David was the original president.

510
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,510
Just watch it later, okay?

511
00:27:09,718 --> 00:27:11,261
Poor David.

512
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:14,056
Oh! By the way...

513
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,974
How did you end up in Section E?

514
00:27:16,975 --> 00:27:19,061
I hope this time you
can answer this honestly.

515
00:27:21,647 --> 00:27:23,732
I also had a fistfight incident back then.

516
00:27:24,358 --> 00:27:25,734
It's a bit complicated.

517
00:27:26,568 --> 00:27:28,487
There's also a little kiss in the mix.

518
00:27:30,697 --> 00:27:32,823
Aren't you too young to be kissing anyone?

519
00:27:32,824 --> 00:27:34,493
You act as if you're an old woman.

520
00:27:35,118 --> 00:27:36,703
So, how did it actually happen?

521
00:27:37,204 --> 00:27:38,497
Did you make the first move?

522
00:27:40,123 --> 00:27:41,250
Something like that.

523
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,627
It hurts, Jay.

524
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:45,671
You foolish child.

525
00:27:46,922 --> 00:27:47,922
Tell the story.

526
00:27:48,382 --> 00:27:49,216
- How did you kiss?
- No.

527
00:27:49,216 --> 00:27:49,841
I don't wanna.

528
00:27:49,842 --> 00:27:53,136
- Come on, spill it!
- You're too pushy, Jay!

529
00:27:53,303 --> 00:27:57,432
Jasper Jean Mariano,
you and the entire Section E are banned...

530
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:01,394
from entering the HVIS Cafeteria
by order of the student council.

531
00:28:01,395 --> 00:28:02,395
Seriously?

532
00:28:02,638 --> 00:28:03,998
I am banned from the canteen too?

533
00:28:04,356 --> 00:28:05,399
What kind of joke is this?

534
00:28:08,277 --> 00:28:09,637
You're from Section E, aren't you?

535
00:28:10,028 --> 00:28:11,405
How are we gonna get food now?

536
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:14,490
You're right.

537
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:18,161
How annoying! The worms in
my tummy are getting riled up now.

538
00:28:19,496 --> 00:28:21,915
I will just bring my own food from now on.

539
00:28:22,499 --> 00:28:23,979
Why don't you bring some for me too?

540
00:28:24,334 --> 00:28:25,376
Aren't you pushing your luck too much?

541
00:28:25,377 --> 00:28:26,461
Come on.

542
00:28:26,753 --> 00:28:27,921
Everyone's busy at home.

543
00:28:29,256 --> 00:28:29,923
Please...

544
00:28:29,924 --> 00:28:31,717
I'll share my food with you then.

545
00:28:32,175 --> 00:28:33,175
Yes!

546
00:28:35,971 --> 00:28:36,971
Hi, Rakki!

547
00:28:39,558 --> 00:28:40,599
You girls go ahead.

548
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,185
Bye. See you later.

549
00:28:42,436 --> 00:28:43,436
Jay-jay, how are you?

550
00:28:43,937 --> 00:28:44,937
You doing okay?

551
00:28:45,564 --> 00:28:46,523
It's just...

552
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:48,108
I'm famished. You?

553
00:28:48,817 --> 00:28:49,817
How about me?

554
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:51,796
Aren't you gonna ask how I've been?

555
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:54,197
No need. It's obvious
you've been in a fight.

556
00:28:55,866 --> 00:28:56,866
Dummy.

557
00:28:57,075 --> 00:28:58,577
Why, haven't you eaten anything?

558
00:28:58,994 --> 00:29:01,204
Not yet. I'm banned from the canteen too.

559
00:29:01,413 --> 00:29:02,413
Is that so?

560
00:29:02,622 --> 00:29:03,332
How about this?

561
00:29:03,623 --> 00:29:04,750
Just give me your money.

562
00:29:04,875 --> 00:29:06,543
I'll see what I can do.

563
00:29:07,461 --> 00:29:08,837
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

564
00:29:09,963 --> 00:29:10,963
Give it, quick.

565
00:29:13,342 --> 00:29:15,802
I'll have rice and menudo. You, Ci-N?

566
00:29:16,553 --> 00:29:17,763
I'll have the special order.

567
00:29:18,388 --> 00:29:19,598
It's called "Rakki."

568
00:29:19,806 --> 00:29:21,558
Really. What's your order?

569
00:29:22,184 --> 00:29:23,685
I'll have the same as Jay-jay.

570
00:29:24,019 --> 00:29:26,271
- Okay. I'll go ahead.
- Thank you, Rakki.

571
00:29:32,861 --> 00:29:34,529
Hey... what's up with you two?

572
00:29:35,322 --> 00:29:36,322
Nothing.

573
00:29:36,782 --> 00:29:37,782
That's nothing.

574
00:29:39,826 --> 00:29:44,998
Ahhhh, so the kiss you
were telling me about is with...

575
00:29:46,875 --> 00:29:48,125
With Rakki?

576
00:29:48,126 --> 00:29:49,126
Yeah.

577
00:29:49,419 --> 00:29:51,755
Wow. I didn't expect that.
You really kissed?

578
00:29:52,923 --> 00:29:53,924
I kissed her.

579
00:29:54,424 --> 00:29:55,424
How?

580
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,219
It just happened.

581
00:29:57,427 --> 00:29:59,554
Our faces got closer and then...

582
00:30:00,472 --> 00:30:01,723
I kissed her.

583
00:30:02,849 --> 00:30:04,101
She punched me after, though.

584
00:30:04,976 --> 00:30:06,478
You really are sneaky.

585
00:30:12,526 --> 00:30:13,901
Rakki's so nice, isn't she?

586
00:30:13,902 --> 00:30:16,530
We got to eat because of her,
now I get why you like her.

587
00:30:16,822 --> 00:30:17,906
Tell me about it.

588
00:30:18,407 --> 00:30:22,035
Wait, why are we down here?
Aren't we heading to the re-election?

589
00:30:23,745 --> 00:30:25,621
Come on, place your big bets right here!

590
00:30:25,622 --> 00:30:27,249
I'll bet on Keifer!

591
00:30:27,749 --> 00:30:30,585
Keifer! Keifer! Keifer!

592
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,012
Alright, guys. Listen up!

593
00:30:43,265 --> 00:30:47,060
It's now time for the re-election!

594
00:30:50,647 --> 00:30:52,983
It's so fun, see?
We even have an announcer.

595
00:30:53,525 --> 00:30:55,443
- Your re-election's like this?
- Let's go, Keifer!

596
00:30:55,444 --> 00:30:56,944
Are you serious?!

597
00:30:56,945 --> 00:30:58,029
The rules are simple...

598
00:30:59,156 --> 00:31:00,532
It's a fight until the end.

599
00:31:00,991 --> 00:31:03,701
David versus Keifer.

600
00:31:03,702 --> 00:31:05,537
Last one standing...

601
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,079
gets to be president!

602
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:10,958
[cheering]

603
00:31:10,959 --> 00:31:14,503
Keifer!

604
00:31:14,504 --> 00:31:16,839
- David! David! David!
- Keifer, let's go!

605
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,466
Keifer, let's go!

606
00:31:17,467 --> 00:31:21,594
Beat him up, David!
He's nothing but a pretty face!

607
00:31:21,595 --> 00:31:24,221
You can do it, David, go!

608
00:31:24,222 --> 00:31:25,931
David!

609
00:31:25,932 --> 00:31:28,101
Alright go ahead and stretch.

610
00:31:29,686 --> 00:31:30,686
What?

611
00:31:30,687 --> 00:31:32,980
You gotta win, dude.
I bet a lot of money on you.

612
00:31:32,981 --> 00:31:35,734
- David, you gotta win!
- Let's go!

613
00:31:37,027 --> 00:31:38,487
David!

614
00:31:39,863 --> 00:31:42,866
Keifer!

615
00:31:44,284 --> 00:31:46,244
- Come on, Keifer!
- I said David!

616
00:31:48,246 --> 00:31:50,415
Go, David!

617
00:31:54,419 --> 00:31:56,213
Okay, guys, before you start...

618
00:31:56,505 --> 00:31:57,756
let's do a fist bump.

619
00:31:59,466 --> 00:32:00,466
Okay.

620
00:32:00,967 --> 00:32:03,303
Let's get ready to rumble!

621
00:32:11,102 --> 00:32:12,187
Let's go, Keifer!

622
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:15,940
Go on, punch him!

623
00:32:16,816 --> 00:32:18,109
Give him another!

624
00:32:20,779 --> 00:32:21,779
David?

625
00:32:24,032 --> 00:32:24,783
Easy!

626
00:32:24,784 --> 00:32:25,784
Let's go!

627
00:32:32,624 --> 00:32:34,918
Come on, man! I bet a lot on this.

628
00:32:38,547 --> 00:32:39,798
Come on, David!

629
00:32:41,466 --> 00:32:42,759
Get up, David!

630
00:32:44,427 --> 00:32:47,346
Keifer!

631
00:32:47,347 --> 00:32:49,432
Get up, David! Beat him up!

632
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:51,560
Beat him up!

633
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,608
Punch him!

634
00:32:59,859 --> 00:33:01,236
Go! Beat his ass!

635
00:33:10,537 --> 00:33:12,247
- David!
- Let's go, Keifer!

636
00:33:21,756 --> 00:33:28,221
Keifer!

637
00:33:29,347 --> 00:33:32,100
The winner and still our class president!

638
00:33:32,934 --> 00:33:35,561
Mark Keifer Watson!

639
00:33:35,562 --> 00:33:38,272
[cheering]

640
00:33:38,273 --> 00:33:44,570
Keifer!

641
00:33:44,571 --> 00:33:52,571
Keifer!

642
00:33:57,477 --> 00:33:59,797
Keifer!

643
00:34:01,004 --> 00:34:03,965
I'm so sorry, my friend.

644
00:34:06,468 --> 00:34:07,677
Hey, David.

645
00:34:08,678 --> 00:34:09,929
Just leave.

646
00:34:10,138 --> 00:34:11,431
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

647
00:34:12,557 --> 00:34:14,016
Just leave me be.

648
00:34:14,017 --> 00:34:15,100
I'm alright.

649
00:34:15,101 --> 00:34:17,771
You are not alright. Look at you.
You're injured.

650
00:34:17,979 --> 00:34:19,521
Do you want to report this to the school?

651
00:34:19,522 --> 00:34:21,362
I'm the one who got
involved in a fight, right?

652
00:34:21,566 --> 00:34:23,484
Do you think I have the
nerve to tell on them?

653
00:34:23,485 --> 00:34:24,486
Fine then.

654
00:34:25,278 --> 00:34:26,946
Just let me help you.

655
00:34:27,572 --> 00:34:28,572
I'll do it...

656
00:34:28,615 --> 00:34:30,033
No, just stay there.

657
00:34:33,286 --> 00:34:35,121
Don't try to act cool. Here.

658
00:34:35,747 --> 00:34:38,541
Wear this. So nobody
will see you all bruised up.

659
00:34:40,251 --> 00:34:41,544
Why are you helping me?

660
00:34:43,296 --> 00:34:44,756
Do I need a reason to help?

661
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:46,090
Come.

662
00:34:47,133 --> 00:34:48,677
Fix yourself up.

663
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,060
Come.

664
00:34:58,853 --> 00:34:59,854
Get up now.

665
00:35:15,203 --> 00:35:18,832
Class... see you tomorrow.

666
00:35:19,082 --> 00:35:20,709
Sir, maybe next year?

667
00:35:23,211 --> 00:35:25,838
- Alright. I'll see you next year.
- Bye, sir.

668
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:27,047
See you, sir!

669
00:35:27,048 --> 00:35:28,800
- Take care.
- Slow down, sir.

670
00:35:29,926 --> 00:35:31,553
- Goodbye, sir.
- Take care.

671
00:35:32,011 --> 00:35:33,096
Did you bring any food?

672
00:35:33,179 --> 00:35:34,859
Of course. I brought some for you as well.

673
00:35:34,889 --> 00:35:36,182
- Yes!
- Wanna eat it?

674
00:35:36,474 --> 00:35:37,474
Of course.

675
00:35:39,144 --> 00:35:40,145
Thank you, Jay.

676
00:35:42,564 --> 00:35:43,564
Want some?

677
00:35:44,399 --> 00:35:44,941
Yeah.

678
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:47,902
Next time, I'll bring some
for you as well. For now, eat this.

679
00:35:48,528 --> 00:35:49,195
Tss.

680
00:35:49,195 --> 00:35:50,071
Thank you, Jay-jay.

681
00:35:50,072 --> 00:35:51,352
- Are you feeling better?
- Yeah.

682
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:54,950
Hey, David.

683
00:35:55,076 --> 00:35:56,161
Welcome back.

684
00:35:56,369 --> 00:35:57,569
- Thanks, man.
- I missed you.

685
00:35:57,746 --> 00:35:58,746
Let's eat.

686
00:35:59,038 --> 00:36:00,080
Eat everything, okay.

687
00:36:00,081 --> 00:36:01,582
- I'm so hungry.
- You eat too.

688
00:36:01,583 --> 00:36:03,585
- Go ahead, I'm good.
- Thank you.

689
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:06,670
Is it tasty?

690
00:36:06,963 --> 00:36:07,963
Mmm.

691
00:36:09,507 --> 00:36:10,592
Guys!

Miss Assunta sent a
message to the group chat.

693
00:36:14,669 --> 00:36:16,546
We'll be having PE class at the gym.

694
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,432
- Right now?
- Yeah.

695
00:36:18,433 --> 00:36:19,225
- Come on.
- Let's go.

696
00:36:19,226 --> 00:36:21,143

- Did you bring your uniform?

697
00:36:21,144 --> 00:36:23,730
Umm, yeah.
I got it. I'll go change.

Can't you see there's a girl?

701
00:36:39,204 --> 00:36:40,371
What the hell?

00:36:44,167 --> 00:36:46,377
My God, you're all so nasty!

703
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:24,122
You look like you're enjoying yourself.

704
00:37:24,123 --> 00:37:25,123
Nice view?

705
00:37:25,291 --> 00:37:27,292
God, no! What do you think I am, thirsty?

706
00:37:27,293 --> 00:37:28,293
You're all so skinny!

707
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:30,839
Is that why you're staring at...

708
00:37:31,506 --> 00:37:32,257
Shut your mouth.

709
00:37:32,258 --> 00:37:33,258
I'll go get changed.

710
00:37:35,385 --> 00:37:37,344
Move! Get out of the way!

711
00:37:37,345 --> 00:37:38,345
Move! Move!

712
00:37:49,357 --> 00:37:50,717
Look where you're going, will you?

713
00:37:51,401 --> 00:37:55,362
[students teasing]

714
00:37:55,363 --> 00:37:56,656
Busted!

Busted!

716
00:38:03,872 --> 00:38:05,039
Come girls, coffee?

717
00:38:05,331 --> 00:38:06,790
Hey, I'll see you later, okay?

718
00:38:06,791 --> 00:38:08,209
Bye, see you.

719
00:38:08,376 --> 00:38:09,752
We're gonna have coffee.

720
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:12,170
Yo!

Aries!

722
00:38:13,715 --> 00:38:14,715
What's up?

723
00:38:14,799 --> 00:38:17,468
Wanna see what shenanigans
Section E is up to today?

724
00:38:18,011 --> 00:38:19,011
It's their PE right now.

725
00:38:19,429 --> 00:38:20,429
Why me?

726
00:38:20,597 --> 00:38:22,849
And why would we bother
watching their PE class?

727
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:26,769
Aries, let's go. It's gonna be fun.

728
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:30,064
And also... your cousin's there, right?

729
00:38:30,481 --> 00:38:32,275
Hey! She's my cousin.

730
00:38:32,483 --> 00:38:33,693
Don't even think about it.

731
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:35,214
Alright. Chill.

732
00:38:35,667 --> 00:38:38,128
Come on, Aries. Don't you wanna
keep an eye on your cousin?

733
00:38:38,452 --> 00:38:40,579
You know how Section
E does their PE, right?

734
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,444
I'll call you guys later, okay? See you.

735
00:38:45,121 --> 00:38:46,121
Excuse me.

736
00:38:46,456 --> 00:38:47,123
Hi, Mykel.

737
00:38:47,123 --> 00:38:48,123
Hi, Kiko.

738
00:38:48,374 --> 00:38:49,918
- Hi, babe!
- Hi, babe!

739
00:38:51,586 --> 00:38:54,213
I won't be too long.
We have gym practice later.

740
00:38:55,131 --> 00:38:56,131
Wanna come?

741
00:38:58,635 --> 00:38:59,635
Alright, babe. Sure.

742
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:00,720
Your ex is there.

743
00:39:01,804 --> 00:39:03,973
Hey, you mean "exes."

744
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,600
Aren't Keifer and Yuri your exes?

745
00:39:05,767 --> 00:39:06,767
Only Keifer.

746
00:39:08,311 --> 00:39:10,463
You know, you two are jerks.

747
00:39:10,688 --> 00:39:12,408
I'm just letting her know who's at the gym.

748
00:39:15,193 --> 00:39:17,903
Alright, class. Let's do the stretching.

749
00:39:17,904 --> 00:39:20,531
All you have to do is to follow me. Okay?

750
00:39:20,782 --> 00:39:21,782
Ready?

751
00:39:21,991 --> 00:39:22,992
Shake your hands.

752
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:24,869
There.

753
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:26,579
So we can release our tension. Okay.

754
00:39:26,871 --> 00:39:27,372
Okay?

755
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:30,430
You hold your ears like this.
Let's stretch it out.

756
00:39:30,625 --> 00:39:36,297
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

757
00:39:36,673 --> 00:39:41,635
Eight, seven, six, five, four,
three, two, one.

758
00:39:41,636 --> 00:39:42,261
Okay, next.

759
00:39:42,262 --> 00:39:43,262
Stretch.

760
00:39:43,471 --> 00:39:47,558
One, two, three, four, five, six

761
00:39:47,809 --> 00:39:50,019
Stay here with me for a bit.
Go to practice later.

762
00:39:50,228 --> 00:39:54,774
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.

763
00:39:54,983 --> 00:39:56,234
Shake your hands, guys.

764
00:39:56,526 --> 00:39:57,526
Good.

765
00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:58,695
There you go.

766
00:39:58,945 --> 00:40:00,821
Alright, now let's do the upper part.

767
00:40:00,822 --> 00:40:04,074
Hey. Aries, Ella. Come here,
we saved you a seat.

768
00:40:04,075 --> 00:40:04,951
Okay, let's do this.

769
00:40:04,952 --> 00:40:06,577
- Ella Dianne Hyun.
- Okay, guys...

770
00:40:08,705 --> 00:40:09,705
This is off-limits!

771
00:40:09,706 --> 00:40:12,000
Alright. Now second stretching.

772
00:40:12,166 --> 00:40:14,252
There was this girl.
Keifer and her became a couple.

773
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,087
That's... Ella, right?

774
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:18,380
Let's keep stretching, okay?

775
00:40:19,215 --> 00:40:27,097
- One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,
- Ooh, so that's Ella!

776
00:40:27,098 --> 00:40:33,145
Eight, seven, six, five,
four, three, two, one.

777
00:40:33,146 --> 00:40:34,647
- Wait. Yuri too?
- Perfect!

778
00:40:34,981 --> 00:40:36,941
Okay. Third one.

779
00:40:37,525 --> 00:40:39,527
- Do it like this.
- Hi, Jay-jay!

780
00:40:39,944 --> 00:40:40,944
Okay next!

781
00:40:41,195 --> 00:40:42,195
Follow me.

782
00:40:42,905 --> 00:40:44,740
- She's looking at you, man.
- She's looking at me.

783
00:40:44,741 --> 00:40:46,159
Chin up!

784
00:40:46,993 --> 00:40:48,369
Good job.

785
00:40:48,619 --> 00:40:54,917
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.

786
00:40:55,251 --> 00:41:01,132
Eight, seven, six, five, four,
three, two, and one.

787
00:41:02,091 --> 00:41:03,091
Good job.

788
00:41:03,926 --> 00:41:08,598
Well, everyone. I want you
to practice your serves. Okay?

789
00:41:08,723 --> 00:41:13,519
I will come back later
and grade you individually.

790
00:41:13,811 --> 00:41:17,565
So please make sure to help each other out.

791
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,650
- Can we do that?
- Yes, ma'am.

792
00:41:19,817 --> 00:41:21,069
- Good.
- Hey, help me.

793
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:23,946
Help me!

794
00:41:25,031 --> 00:41:27,115
- What are you laughing for?
- Start praying, Jay-jay.

795
00:41:27,116 --> 00:41:30,035
You know, David, you better move to
the side. Your face is already bruised.

796
00:41:30,036 --> 00:41:32,079
- How is it again?
- Like this...

797
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,640
- I said, move to the side.
- Listen to me.

798
00:41:33,664 --> 00:41:35,165
Your hand has to be like this...

799
00:41:35,166 --> 00:41:36,166
Mariano!

800
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:41,130
Do you know how to receive a serve?

801
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,220
What the hell?

802
00:41:48,888 --> 00:41:49,888
Attack!

803
00:41:50,765 --> 00:41:52,725
Hey, stop it! Just leave me alone!

804
00:41:53,142 --> 00:41:55,018
- I told you to stop!
- Guys, stop it.

805
00:41:55,019 --> 00:41:56,179
Guys, stop doing that to her.

806
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:57,521
Stop it already, guys.

807
00:41:58,606 --> 00:42:00,817
Stop!

808
00:42:02,944 --> 00:42:04,278
Stop, stop, stop.

809
00:42:05,613 --> 00:42:08,116
- I told you! Stop it!
- No, don't.

810
00:42:08,491 --> 00:42:09,700
Stop!

811
00:42:14,872 --> 00:42:16,624
Let's see if you can catch this.

812
00:42:20,837 --> 00:42:21,879
Keifer!

813
00:42:24,048 --> 00:42:24,674
Jay-jay!

814
00:42:25,007 --> 00:42:26,007
Jay-jay!

815
00:42:26,384 --> 00:42:27,426
Jay-jay!

816
00:42:30,096 --> 00:42:31,139
Jay-jay!

817
00:42:31,597 --> 00:42:32,849
Jay-jay!

818
00:42:34,016 --> 00:42:35,017
Hey, give her space.

819
00:42:35,977 --> 00:42:37,186
- Jay-jay?
- Oh, shit.

820
00:42:38,062 --> 00:42:39,355
You're all good for nothing!

821
00:42:40,273 --> 00:42:41,273
Fuck you!

822
00:42:43,276 --> 00:42:44,276
Jay-jay?

823
00:42:44,527 --> 00:42:45,778
Please! Just calm down.

824
00:42:46,404 --> 00:42:48,947
You're so hard-headed!
Just listen to what I say!

825
00:42:48,948 --> 00:42:51,324
You're useless. Just die!

826
00:42:51,325 --> 00:42:52,576
Your mother's not here...

827
00:42:52,577 --> 00:42:54,620
Enough! Please, no more.

828
00:42:54,871 --> 00:42:56,788
- No more!
- Relax. Just breathe.

829
00:42:56,789 --> 00:42:59,374
- No more!
- Hey, Jay-jay.

830
00:42:59,375 --> 00:43:01,376
- Jay-jay.
- No more!

831
00:43:01,377 --> 00:43:04,087
- Class? What happened to her?
- Miss Asunta, do you have nothing to do?

832
00:43:04,088 --> 00:43:05,798
No more!

833
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:07,175
No more!

834
00:43:07,508 --> 00:43:08,843
- No more!
- Jay-jay?

835
00:43:09,302 --> 00:43:10,970
- Relax.
- No more!

836
00:43:11,721 --> 00:43:13,514
- No more!
- Jay-jay?

837
00:43:13,848 --> 00:43:14,557
Relax!

838
00:43:14,558 --> 00:43:16,767
Breathe, Jay-jay. Focus!

839
00:43:17,059 --> 00:43:18,059
David!

840
00:43:18,352 --> 00:43:20,729
- Go to the clinic, please!
- Jay-jay— breathe.

841
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:21,856
- Get a nurse!
- Please!

842
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:23,357
- Go ahead!
- Jay-jay!

843
00:43:24,734 --> 00:43:26,277
Keep looking into my eyes.

844
00:43:27,486 --> 00:43:29,030
Just look into my eyes.

845
00:43:31,908 --> 00:43:33,451
Jay-jay!

846
00:43:33,868 --> 00:43:35,786
Jay-jay— breathe.

847
00:43:36,787 --> 00:43:38,456
Jay-jay!

848
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:44,670
Breathe, Jay-jay. Relax!

849
00:44:41,185 --> 00:44:44,230
You don't need to punch your way
through everything.

850
00:44:44,563 --> 00:44:46,482
But if you really need to, go!

851
00:44:46,649 --> 00:44:48,734
Are you sure? It's really alright with you?

852
00:44:49,235 --> 00:44:50,069
It's okay.

853
00:44:50,194 --> 00:44:51,779
Your nose is so red!

854
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:53,780
Ouch!

855
00:44:53,823 --> 00:44:55,448
I'm getting really pissed at you.
It hurts so bad!

856
00:44:55,449 --> 00:44:57,242
I'm asking you a serious question.

857
00:44:57,243 --> 00:44:58,368
Do it properly.

858
00:44:58,369 --> 00:44:59,495
Hold still.

859
00:45:03,749 --> 00:45:05,542
I cannot believe Kiko.

860
00:45:05,543 --> 00:45:09,462
He won't shut up about
that new transferee, Jay-jay.

861
00:45:09,463 --> 00:45:11,799
- She's not even that pretty.
- I agree.

862
00:45:12,758 --> 00:45:14,635
Who's not pretty again?

863
00:45:14,844 --> 00:45:16,052
Oh!

864
00:45:16,053 --> 00:45:17,262
Wanna get back at them?

865
00:45:17,263 --> 00:45:18,514
Why do you even care?

866
00:45:18,681 --> 00:45:19,921
It's protecting one of our own.

867
00:45:20,683 --> 00:45:21,392
Damn.

868
00:45:21,434 --> 00:45:22,600
Give me back my bag!

869
00:45:22,601 --> 00:45:23,685
Hold her still!

870
00:45:23,686 --> 00:45:26,272
Hey! What are you doing with my bag?

871
00:45:26,689 --> 00:45:28,189
Respect the flag!

872
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:30,693
Salute... now!

873
00:45:32,111 --> 00:45:33,445
What if the chocolate melts?

874
00:45:33,446 --> 00:45:34,196
Chocolate?

875
00:45:34,447 --> 00:45:35,364
Did she say chocolate?

876
00:45:35,365 --> 00:45:36,991
You're really testing my temper!

877
00:45:37,533 --> 00:45:40,244
- Jay-jay!
- Get the chocolate!
