willing to do everything for his love.

Mr. Jasfher Mariano be?

This is him. I'm Jasper Jean Mariano.

29

He already left. He already
boarded the airplane.

about what you feel for Keifer.

31

32

Three hours.

33
00:01:24,544 --> 00:01:27,047
I've been staring at
this ring for three hours.

43
00:01:59,145 --> 00:02:01,289
This looks like an engagement ring.

Jay, what's the matter with you?

52

Learn to read people's
emotions. Don't be insensitive.

I just don't want to
assume too much, Auntie.

Not really. He asked about you, but...

first week on the wrong foot,

they made it up to me.

202

They accepted me as one of them.

But in exchange, you got to
give up what you have now?

I mean, it depends.

more than what I'm losing,

Wow! Look how Ci-N go!

366
00:22:03,016 --> 00:22:05,810
1, 2, 3... Stop!

367
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,021
Stop!

368
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:11,691
Who's the first to be "out"?

369
00:22:14,736 --> 00:22:16,237
Out, out, out!

370
00:22:16,404 --> 00:22:19,407
Mayo! You're out!

371
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:23,870
That was so good! So good!

372
00:22:24,537 --> 00:22:27,374
Okay, okay. Up next!

373
00:22:27,749 --> 00:22:29,792
Animal pose!

374
00:22:29,793 --> 00:22:32,113
- Music!
- Just watch them, Mica. That's gonna be so funny.

375
00:22:32,295 --> 00:22:35,298
Go, dance it out, dude!

376
00:22:36,758 --> 00:22:37,884
Is that an animal?

377
00:22:44,474 --> 00:22:45,474
Jay.

378
00:22:45,892 --> 00:22:47,143
I have a question for you.

379
00:22:47,894 --> 00:22:49,187
But don't get offended.

380
00:22:50,105 --> 00:22:51,105
What is it?

381
00:22:54,275 --> 00:22:56,275
Is there something going
on between you and Keifer?

382
00:22:56,403 --> 00:22:57,403
Huh?

383
00:22:58,905 --> 00:23:01,032
Have you fallen for Keifer?

384
00:23:02,909 --> 00:23:04,035
Stop!

385
00:23:04,327 --> 00:23:05,578
Oh, shit.

386
00:23:08,289 --> 00:23:10,500
Keifer...

387
00:23:12,168 --> 00:23:13,545
What is that, huh?!

388
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,839
Keifer, why are you blinking?

389
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,339
Out!

390
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:22,721
[cheering]

391
00:23:23,304 --> 00:23:25,764
If nothing's going on,
then why is your smile so wide?

392
00:23:25,765 --> 00:23:28,985
There really is nothing!
The game's hilarious, that's all.

393
00:23:29,853 --> 00:23:32,439
- Is that so?
- Stop pushing it.

394
00:23:32,647 --> 00:23:33,647
Get down low! Low!

395
00:23:34,524 --> 00:23:36,526
Ready. 1, 2, 3. Stop!

396
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,028
Uy!

397
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,364
Gyatt! Show that gyatt!

398
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:44,409
- Mica, what is it?
- Hey, Calix! What are you mouthing there?

399
00:23:44,701 --> 00:23:46,994
Calix, you're out!

400
00:23:46,995 --> 00:23:49,371
[teasing]

401
00:23:49,372 --> 00:23:51,707
- Go over there!
- You're out already, dude!

402
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:53,418
You son of a bitch!

403
00:23:54,502 --> 00:23:55,795
Okay, next.

404
00:23:56,421 --> 00:23:57,421
Get out of here!

405
00:23:58,576 --> 00:23:59,883
Everything okay?

406
00:24:00,413 --> 00:24:01,455
I got this.

407
00:24:02,635 --> 00:24:04,554
Olympic pose?

408
00:24:04,804 --> 00:24:08,266
Alright! Move it! For the money!

409
00:24:09,184 --> 00:24:11,311
Go dude! I'm betting on you!

410
00:24:14,814 --> 00:24:17,025
Just remember, Jay.
Stay cautious.

411
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:21,988
You know you're in the
same situation as Ella before.

412
00:24:23,226 --> 00:24:26,743
You are aware of what
went down in the past, right?

413
00:24:27,994 --> 00:24:29,788
Calix and I are just worried for you.

414
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:33,083
No, there's really nothing going on.
Don't worry.

415
00:24:37,545 --> 00:24:40,757
Yes, like that!

416
00:24:41,841 --> 00:24:43,510
There you go again!

417
00:24:44,094 --> 00:24:45,094
Stop!

418
00:24:47,222 --> 00:24:50,266
- Hi, Rakki!
- Oh, Rakki's here.

419
00:24:50,517 --> 00:24:53,061
Ci-N, you're out!

420
00:24:53,186 --> 00:24:54,186
Out!

421
00:24:54,354 --> 00:24:57,357
Ci-N, the Troublemaker Kid, out!

422
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,817
Music.

423
00:25:04,739 --> 00:25:05,739
Stop!

424
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:08,326
Who's gonna move?

425
00:25:08,535 --> 00:25:11,328
- That's not a pop and lock.
- Yeah. That's not even close.

426
00:25:11,329 --> 00:25:13,123
Denzel, you're out! The Young Dad!

427
00:25:13,498 --> 00:25:16,083
- That's a macho dancer move.
- You're out!

428
00:25:16,084 --> 00:25:19,336
- Bye!
- Don't you feel sorry for him? He's starting a family!

429
00:25:19,337 --> 00:25:21,338
And the winner is...

430
00:25:21,339 --> 00:25:23,090
Blaster!

431
00:25:23,091 --> 00:25:26,469
[cheering]

432
00:25:33,268 --> 00:25:35,602
Wait a sec! Will you stop pushing?!

433
00:25:35,603 --> 00:25:36,312
Stop pushing!

434
00:25:36,354 --> 00:25:37,354
Ouch!

435
00:25:38,523 --> 00:25:41,568
I can handle this.
One, two, three, four, five.

436
00:25:42,861 --> 00:25:44,987
- What?
- Look at Yuri. What's going on with him?

437
00:25:44,988 --> 00:25:46,406
Does he have a problem?

438
00:25:47,866 --> 00:25:49,033
Is he okay?

439
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,659
- Will you hurry up?
- That's mine.

440
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,953
- Go quickly!
- Just wait!

441
00:25:53,371 --> 00:25:55,291
What is this? You're not gonna
leave some for me?

442
00:25:57,584 --> 00:25:59,085
[students chattering]

443
00:26:02,213 --> 00:26:03,298
Calm down!

444
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,592
You're just jealous
because you're single!

445
00:26:10,346 --> 00:26:11,346
Eat up.

446
00:26:13,266 --> 00:26:15,018
Let's just share?

447
00:26:16,603 --> 00:26:18,438
Do you have a problem?

448
00:26:18,688 --> 00:26:19,688
Are you okay?

449
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,614
The ring's beautiful.

450
00:26:32,702 --> 00:26:33,702
Yuri…

451
00:26:33,828 --> 00:26:34,828
Did you like it?

452
00:26:37,373 --> 00:26:38,373
Yeah.

453
00:26:38,958 --> 00:26:40,835
But why did you give it to me?

454
00:26:42,086 --> 00:26:43,504
Do you trust me, Jay?

455
00:26:44,505 --> 00:26:45,505
Of course.

456
00:26:50,486 --> 00:26:53,197
Can I explain it some other time?

457
00:26:55,016 --> 00:26:56,476
You're making me nervous.

458
00:26:57,977 --> 00:26:58,977
Promise.

459
00:26:59,229 --> 00:27:01,064
I'll explain everything to you.

460
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:04,901
You owe me another explanation.

461
00:27:09,656 --> 00:27:11,199
Just ask me about something else.

462
00:27:17,914 --> 00:27:19,040
Okay, I have one.

463
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:21,709
Why are you wearing costumes?

464
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,129
It's a joke we played before.

465
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:29,008
We forced the former president
to wear a Santa costume.

466
00:27:29,425 --> 00:27:32,344
Then, he'd choose two others who
will wear elf costumes.

467
00:27:32,345 --> 00:27:33,680
It's like a tradition.

468
00:27:34,389 --> 00:27:36,683
But karma caught up to Keifer and I.

469
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,685
Serves you right.

470
00:27:39,269 --> 00:27:40,186
You look cute.

471
00:27:40,187 --> 00:27:41,396
Stupidly cute.

472
00:27:42,897 --> 00:27:43,897
It's a joke.

473
00:27:44,148 --> 00:27:45,525
[chattering]

474
00:27:47,026 --> 00:27:49,529
Just kidding. But it looks good.

475
00:27:49,612 --> 00:27:50,738
- Really?
- Yeah.

476
00:27:50,822 --> 00:27:51,864
Suits you well.

477
00:27:52,407 --> 00:27:53,407
Damn!

478
00:27:54,117 --> 00:27:55,917
It seems we're gonna
run out of food quickly!

479
00:27:56,035 --> 00:27:57,035
But...

480
00:27:58,788 --> 00:27:59,788
Hold on…

481
00:28:01,165 --> 00:28:02,875
Where's the roasted chicken I bought?

482
00:28:03,501 --> 00:28:05,294
- Yeah, I bought that.
- That's right.

483
00:28:05,295 --> 00:28:07,505
There was chicken earlier.

484
00:28:07,922 --> 00:28:09,548
Stop hiding the chicken!

485
00:28:09,549 --> 00:28:10,882
Get that chicken out now!

486
00:28:10,883 --> 00:28:12,176
Not Yuri, alright?!

487
00:28:12,343 --> 00:28:15,595
I didn't get a piece! I'm hosting
this party, and it's not even a paid gig.

488
00:28:15,596 --> 00:28:16,805
Please show some respect!

489
00:28:16,806 --> 00:28:18,598
That's payment for all your debts!

490
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:22,103
Oh, really, Denzel? Well, at
least I don't have "responsibilities."

491
00:28:22,228 --> 00:28:24,939
Hey! Shut up! Enough already!

492
00:28:25,231 --> 00:28:28,191
Let's do a roll call.
One at a time, raise your plates.

493
00:28:28,192 --> 00:28:29,110
- Alright!
- Fine.

494
00:28:29,111 --> 00:28:31,153
- Jay-jay!
- Drew. Drew.

495
00:28:31,154 --> 00:28:32,280
Eren.

496
00:28:32,655 --> 00:28:34,407
Blaster doesn't have any.

497
00:28:34,532 --> 00:28:35,574
Nothing on Rory.

498
00:28:35,575 --> 00:28:37,075
Calix, no. Neither Mica.

499
00:28:37,076 --> 00:28:38,661
None for Felix.

500
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:40,204
See, nothing.

501
00:28:40,455 --> 00:28:41,455
David.

502
00:28:41,664 --> 00:28:42,874
Nothing. No chicken.

503
00:28:44,375 --> 00:28:45,084
We don't have any.

504
00:28:45,085 --> 00:28:46,918
- You jerks.
- Maybe it's you?

505
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:49,338
- Are you sure?
- I really didn't get any.

506
00:28:49,339 --> 00:28:50,590
Thieves say that.

507
00:28:50,882 --> 00:28:53,425
Wait. Where are Kit and Eman?

508
00:28:53,426 --> 00:28:54,802
- Yeah.
- Oh!

509
00:28:55,303 --> 00:28:56,928
And the Troublemaker Kid?! Where's Ci-N!

510
00:28:56,929 --> 00:28:58,931
- Yeah!
- Where's that punk?

511
00:28:59,223 --> 00:29:00,223
[Jay-jay screams]

512
00:29:01,851 --> 00:29:02,851
What the?!

513
00:29:05,521 --> 00:29:06,689
[Section E complaining]

514
00:29:08,566 --> 00:29:10,068
[Section E complaining]

515
00:29:11,695 --> 00:29:12,862
[Section E complaining]

516
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:17,158
The Troublemaker Kid strikes again!

517
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,078
Why did you eat it all by yourself?

518
00:29:21,412 --> 00:29:22,580
Wait, wait…

519
00:29:23,081 --> 00:29:24,122
Hold on!

520
00:29:24,123 --> 00:29:26,917
Have mercy on the kid. He's still growing.

521
00:29:26,918 --> 00:29:29,711
You know what, Jay, don't play favorites.

522
00:29:29,712 --> 00:29:32,715
[argument ensues]

523
00:29:33,216 --> 00:29:35,842
Don't fight over that
chicken because we have…

524
00:29:35,843 --> 00:29:37,636
Roasted pig!

525
00:29:37,637 --> 00:29:40,390
[cheering]

526
00:29:46,946 --> 00:29:48,441
That's mine! That's mine!

527
00:29:48,466 --> 00:29:50,625
These jerks exhaust me.

528
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:53,653
- Let me have a bite!
- Don't mess up the pig!

529
00:30:00,326 --> 00:30:01,326
What's that?

530
00:30:01,536 --> 00:30:02,536
Still have energy?

531
00:30:04,372 --> 00:30:05,039
Whatever.

532
00:30:05,272 --> 00:30:06,440
What's this?

533
00:30:08,584 --> 00:30:09,585
Merry Christmas.

534
00:30:14,549 --> 00:30:16,217
Thank you, but…

535
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:17,574
what is this for?

536
00:30:18,886 --> 00:30:20,179
It's not from me.

537
00:30:20,888 --> 00:30:21,806
Then who?

538
00:30:21,807 --> 00:30:23,975
I don't know. Saw it by the door.

539
00:30:24,392 --> 00:30:25,726
- Huh?
- Mm-hmm.

540
00:30:27,228 --> 00:30:28,312
[Jay-Jay smiles]

541
00:30:28,813 --> 00:30:29,813
Alright.

542
00:30:38,972 --> 00:30:40,223
Hello. David.

543
00:30:40,992 --> 00:30:41,992
Did you give it to her?

544
00:30:42,266 --> 00:30:43,851
Yeah, I gave it already.

545
00:30:44,423 --> 00:30:46,103
But why did you approach me of all people?

546
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:50,251
Sorry, I couldn't trust anybody else.

547

Let's go back inside.

733
00:44:37,244 --> 00:44:38,245
Hold my hand.

734
00:44:39,413 --> 00:44:40,414
No. Like this.

735
00:44:41,832 --> 00:44:43,125
See? You feel nothing.

736
00:44:43,667 --> 00:44:44,710
Did anything change?

737
00:44:45,127 --> 00:44:46,586
- Nothing.
- Told you so.

738
00:44:47,879 --> 00:44:48,963
Bring me...

739
00:44:48,964 --> 00:44:50,589
something...

740
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:51,425
sweet.

741
00:44:51,426 --> 00:44:54,594
Sweet?! Where's my bag?!
There's chocolate there!

742
00:44:54,595 --> 00:44:55,720
I have chocolates in my bag!

743
00:44:55,721 --> 00:44:57,888
Here. Stand over here.

744
00:44:57,889 --> 00:45:00,266
- What is that?
- They were first.

745
00:45:00,267 --> 00:45:01,475
Go back to your seats.

746
00:45:01,476 --> 00:45:03,603
- What's the "sweet" in that?
- Yeah, that's right!

747
00:45:03,604 --> 00:45:05,272
Is that even counted?!

748
00:45:05,355 --> 00:45:07,732
- Ever their pet name is corny too.
- You're just jealous!

749
00:45:07,733 --> 00:45:10,109
- Just give them their prizes.
- If you're really sweet, then kiss!

750
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:13,279
Kiss, kiss.

751
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,824
[cheering]

752
00:45:16,825 --> 00:45:19,118
- Alright. Moving on.
- You make me sick!

753
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:21,287
Move along, quickly.

754
00:45:21,288 --> 00:45:22,455
Okay.

755
00:45:22,456 --> 00:45:23,873
Bring me...

756
00:45:23,874 --> 00:45:25,751
Wait up, he hasn't said anything yet!

757
00:45:26,877 --> 00:45:28,044
Bring me...

758
00:45:28,045 --> 00:45:29,420
Something cute!

759
00:45:29,421 --> 00:45:32,007
- He said cute!
- I could be one!

760
00:45:32,966 --> 00:45:34,468
What?! Hey!

761
00:45:36,345 --> 00:45:38,220
Hey! Wait a minute!

762
00:45:38,221 --> 00:45:39,431
Here's something cute!

763
00:45:40,307 --> 00:45:41,433
Skedaddle.

764
00:45:41,558 --> 00:45:43,560
- Something cute.
- Why me?!

765
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:45,187
Your pigtails are cute.

766
00:45:45,395 --> 00:45:48,440
Ahhh. Ahhh.

767
00:45:48,899 --> 00:45:50,108
Guys,

768
00:45:50,192 --> 00:45:51,568
We have a winner.

769
00:45:51,651 --> 00:45:53,486
Give them the prizes!

770
00:45:53,487 --> 00:45:55,447
Here, boss.

771
00:45:57,366 --> 00:45:58,574
I'm sorry. Sorry.

772
00:45:58,575 --> 00:45:59,575
It's yours.

773
00:45:59,785 --> 00:46:01,370
Open it. Maybe there's money.

774
00:46:06,583 --> 00:46:08,627
[laughing]

775
00:46:09,169 --> 00:46:10,128
This is it?

776
00:46:10,158 --> 00:46:12,081
- Surprise!
- Instant noodles?!

777
00:46:12,631 --> 00:46:13,548
Hey.

778
00:46:13,549 --> 00:46:15,675
We put in effort into wrapping that.

779
00:46:16,510 --> 00:46:18,928
Just have Eman cook it for you.

780
00:46:18,929 --> 00:46:20,138
Come, Jay. Sit here.

781
00:46:20,389 --> 00:46:22,641
Uh, there. He's asking to sit together.

782
00:46:25,769 --> 00:46:29,022
Alright, next one!
This is my most favorite of them all.

783
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:34,152
Bring me... something... you...

784
00:46:34,778 --> 00:46:35,903
Love.

785
00:46:35,904 --> 00:46:37,406
Jay,

786
00:46:37,989 --> 00:46:39,491
Love! Something you love!

787
00:46:40,367 --> 00:46:42,119
Oh. It's you again?

788
00:46:45,414 --> 00:46:45,956
Love?

789
00:46:45,957 --> 00:46:47,164
Hey... Wait.

790
00:46:47,165 --> 00:46:48,290
He said to bring something you love.

791
00:46:48,291 --> 00:46:49,918
Why am I getting carried all the time?

792
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:51,480
He said "bring me something you love."

793
00:46:51,711 --> 00:46:54,005
- Something you love?
- Why did you bring Jay?

794
00:47:01,888 --> 00:47:03,348
Cause I'm in love with Jay-jay.

795
00:47:08,437 --> 00:47:09,438
What?

796
00:47:13,191 --> 00:47:14,359
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

797
00:47:18,697 --> 00:47:20,240
That's fine.

798
00:47:22,409 --> 00:47:23,493
That's okay.

799
00:47:23,827 --> 00:47:24,870
Ci-N...

800
00:47:25,743 --> 00:47:26,870
Ella 2.0.

801
00:47:27,015 --> 00:47:28,141
I know, right?

802
00:47:31,564 --> 00:47:33,086
What's up with that, Jay?

803
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,882
Yeah, okay. That's okay.

804
00:47:37,132 --> 00:47:38,132
Boss...

805
00:47:38,619 --> 00:47:41,195
No, I can't let that happen to us again.

806
00:47:41,219 --> 00:47:42,970
- Yeah, okay. That's okay.
- What am I gonna do?

807
00:47:42,971 --> 00:47:47,516
You see, Jay-jay gets carried all the
time because she's gonna be roasted later!

808
00:47:47,517 --> 00:47:51,146
[laughing]

809
00:47:51,688 --> 00:47:53,105
Okay, okay, okay.

810
00:47:53,106 --> 00:47:54,315
I'm hyped up again!

811
00:47:54,316 --> 00:47:55,859
Let's move on to the next game!

812
00:47:56,067 --> 00:47:57,611
Alright!

813
00:47:57,944 --> 00:48:00,112
It's time for exchanging gifts!

814
00:48:00,113 --> 00:48:03,116
[cheering]

815
00:48:04,034 --> 00:48:06,244
- Ouch.
- Oh, sorry.

816
00:48:07,579 --> 00:48:08,579
What's inside?

817
00:48:09,039 --> 00:48:09,873
Jon Snow?

818
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:12,000
- Sounds cold.
- Who is this Jon Snow?

819
00:48:14,503 --> 00:48:15,921
So handsome!

820
00:48:18,507 --> 00:48:19,591
So Latina!

821
00:48:19,799 --> 00:48:22,052
The next one, let me see!

822
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:24,763
I'll throw this at you.

823
00:48:26,181 --> 00:48:27,306
Oh, this one's my favorite.

824
00:48:27,307 --> 00:48:30,559
Boy Logro!

825
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:32,687
Boy what?

826
00:48:33,146 --> 00:48:35,386
I'm amazed by this guy.
He's so good at beating his eggs.

827
00:48:35,857 --> 00:48:37,692
Nice one, dude.
Go back to your seat.

828
00:48:38,693 --> 00:48:39,945
Alright, next one!

829
00:48:40,779 --> 00:48:42,696
- The Muse.
- The Muse?

830
00:48:42,697 --> 00:48:44,198
No one came. Maybe it means.

831
00:48:44,199 --> 00:48:45,616
"eye booger?"

832
00:48:45,617 --> 00:48:46,952
- It says Muse!
- Muse...

833
00:48:47,869 --> 00:48:48,869
The Muse.

834
00:48:49,162 --> 00:48:50,162
Muse...

835
00:48:52,332 --> 00:48:53,375
Oh right! Muse!

836
00:48:53,875 --> 00:48:54,668
Oh?
- It's Jay-jay!

837
00:48:54,669 --> 00:48:55,752
Don't act dumb.

838
00:48:56,002 --> 00:48:57,128
Is that my code name?

839
00:48:57,337 --> 00:49:00,422
- Yes, it's you.
- But that's not what I wrote.

840
00:49:00,423 --> 00:49:03,218
Jay, we changed it.
Because you truly are our muse.

841
00:49:03,468 --> 00:49:07,430
[cheering]

842
00:49:08,348 --> 00:49:10,015
Go on, get your gift!

843
00:49:10,016 --> 00:49:12,870
- Stop staring like an idiot, come here!
- Who are you calling idiot, huh?!

844
00:49:12,894 --> 00:49:14,437
Give it to me!

845
00:49:14,729 --> 00:49:16,731
Alright, alright.

846
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:19,150
What's next?

847
00:49:21,570 --> 00:49:22,570
Bluetooth?

848
00:49:24,823 --> 00:49:25,991
Who's Bluetooth?

849
00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:29,536
What, does he have a
wireless receptor for gossip?

850
00:49:30,453 --> 00:49:32,289
Oh, it's Keifer.

851
00:49:33,290 --> 00:49:38,044
Keifer... Yeah, we need Bluetooth,
right? Bluetooth's essential, dude.

852
00:49:38,837 --> 00:49:39,588
I'm sorry.

853
00:49:39,589 --> 00:49:40,589
Oh no!

854
00:49:40,922 --> 00:49:43,758
Keifer's gonna get my
"something naughty" gift.

855
00:49:46,678 --> 00:49:48,013
Ci-N!

856
00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:49,556
Cheese!

857
00:49:51,349 --> 00:49:52,475
Techie Boy!

858
00:49:53,101 --> 00:49:54,227
Daddy!

859
00:49:54,477 --> 00:49:55,957
- Daddy chill!
- Give it to me, asshole!

860
00:49:59,899 --> 00:50:01,151
Goliath!

861
00:50:01,526 --> 00:50:03,068
Are you guys ready?

862
00:50:03,069 --> 00:50:05,613
[cheering]

863
00:50:05,614 --> 00:50:06,614
Let's go!

864
00:50:07,490 --> 00:50:12,579
We're gonna open up our gifts!

865
00:50:12,871 --> 00:50:15,624
[cheering]

866
00:50:18,501 --> 00:50:20,128
Wow! It's so nice!

867
00:50:20,503 --> 00:50:22,213
You jerks. Who gave me a condom?

868
00:50:23,006 --> 00:50:23,715
Condom!

869
00:50:23,716 --> 00:50:26,092
Just give it to Denzel. He needs it.

870
00:50:27,218 --> 00:50:28,637
He might create another one.

871
00:50:34,142 --> 00:50:36,353
What if I hit you with this?

872
00:50:36,936 --> 00:50:38,063
Viva Beauty!

873
00:50:38,396 --> 00:50:39,522
But this isn't naughty.

874
00:50:41,107 --> 00:50:42,107
It's naughty.

875
00:50:42,609 --> 00:50:43,777
What's yours?

876
00:50:44,402 --> 00:50:45,402
Jackstone?

877
00:50:45,612 --> 00:50:46,780
Hey, that's fun!

878
00:50:46,905 --> 00:50:47,905
Let me see.

879
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:49,740
What the hell is this?

880
00:50:51,576 --> 00:50:53,369
A plank? Some wood? A stick.

881
00:50:53,370 --> 00:50:55,455
What's naughty about a belt?

882
00:50:56,373 --> 00:50:58,625
If you're naughty, you're gonna
get beaten with a belt.

883
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,085
Yeah, that's what you get.

884
00:51:01,086 --> 00:51:02,921
That doesn't make any sense!

885
00:51:03,046 --> 00:51:04,046
No!

886
00:51:04,506 --> 00:51:05,548
No!

887
00:51:05,757 --> 00:51:08,426
This one too. What do I
do with these slippers?

888
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,387
- No!
- To play tumbang-preso.

889
00:51:10,637 --> 00:51:11,513
Even this.

890
00:51:11,513 --> 00:51:12,263
Even this.

891
00:51:12,264 --> 00:51:13,598
Look what I got. An eggplant.

892
00:51:13,932 --> 00:51:14,932
Wait.

893
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:16,601
That's from the restaurant.

894
00:51:17,852 --> 00:51:18,895
Is this from your resto?

895
00:51:21,147 --> 00:51:22,941
- Jerks...
- Someone swiped it then.

896
00:51:23,733 --> 00:51:24,526
Why me?

897
00:51:24,527 --> 00:51:25,693
Who stole this?

898
00:51:25,694 --> 00:51:27,278
What will I do with this?

899
00:51:27,654 --> 00:51:29,655
When did hangers become naughty?

900
00:51:29,656 --> 00:51:31,658
To hit you with it when
you're being naughty.

901
00:51:34,828 --> 00:51:36,413
So, what's naughty?

902
00:51:43,211 --> 00:51:44,211
There.

903
00:51:46,089 --> 00:51:47,424
So pretty.

904
00:51:48,925 --> 00:51:50,218
Can we use this tonight?

905
00:51:51,219 --> 00:51:52,219
Naughty!

906
00:51:52,971 --> 00:51:55,098
- Oh, son of a bitch...
- You're being naughty.

907
00:51:56,891 --> 00:51:57,891
What's this?

908
00:52:01,938 --> 00:52:04,649
Hey! Stop! Don't!

909
00:52:05,483 --> 00:52:07,152
Who gave this to the kid, huh?!

910
00:52:08,278 --> 00:52:09,946
What? Think it's funny?

911
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:12,823
He's not a kid anymore!
He already knows how to play jackstone.

912
00:52:12,824 --> 00:52:14,575
Ci-N, I'll just give you a new gift.
Just not this one.

913
00:52:14,576 --> 00:52:16,296
- Give it to me, Jay.
- Just let us have it!

914
00:52:16,327 --> 00:52:18,246
No! Not possible!

915
00:52:18,997 --> 00:52:20,582
Such a buzzkill!

916
00:52:21,207 --> 00:52:22,542
- Shut it!
- Jay, what a waste.

917
00:52:22,625 --> 00:52:24,252
What do you mean waste?

918
00:52:24,961 --> 00:52:25,962
What is that?

919
00:52:26,045 --> 00:52:27,045
Shhh.

920
00:52:34,471 --> 00:52:35,513
Boxers?

921
00:52:35,722 --> 00:52:39,434
[laughing]

922
00:52:42,145 --> 00:52:43,730
Fits you perfectly!

923
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:45,565
Now that's something naughty!

924
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:49,651
- Wear it, Keifer!
- Should I?

925
00:52:49,652 --> 00:52:51,945
[cheering]

926
00:52:51,946 --> 00:52:54,323
- Yo those are some nice boxers!
- Wear it, Keif!

927
00:52:54,324 --> 00:52:56,534
Try it, Keifer.

928
00:52:58,286 --> 00:52:59,454
Game.

929
00:52:59,654 --> 00:53:02,457
It's my turn! I'm gonna open mine!

930
00:53:02,624 --> 00:53:05,043
- Jay-jay's gonna open hers.
- My turn.

931
00:53:06,294 --> 00:53:07,045
Wow!

932
00:53:07,295 --> 00:53:09,130
Wow. So sexy.

933
00:53:10,048 --> 00:53:11,632
What the hell is this?

934
00:53:11,633 --> 00:53:12,759
So sexy.

935
00:53:13,051 --> 00:53:14,344
So sexy!

936
00:53:17,889 --> 00:53:19,557
You know, it kinda suits you.

937
00:53:19,766 --> 00:53:22,143
- Wear it!
- Try it on!

938
00:53:23,269 --> 00:53:25,438
Fuck! You probably gave
this to me, didn't you?!

939
00:53:25,688 --> 00:53:26,940
No, it was Ci-N.

940
00:53:31,152 --> 00:53:32,152
You're dead.

941
00:53:32,556 --> 00:53:35,281
- Sorry.
- Hey, Ci-N! Come back here!

942
00:53:35,657 --> 00:53:38,159
- Try to catch up Jay!
- Come back here you scumbag!

943
00:53:38,785 --> 00:53:40,744
Yuri, dude. What did you get?

944
00:53:40,745 --> 00:53:42,246
Will that beat my hollow blocks?

945
00:53:42,247 --> 00:53:43,289
I'll smack you with this.

946
00:53:47,836 --> 00:53:55,836
[Section E chattering]

947
00:54:19,386 --> 00:54:24,163
They say you're all good-for-nothing.
Not accepted anywhere else.

948
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:29,636
Maybe that's why it was difficult
for you to accept me in the beginning.

949
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:36,860
But now, you all embraced me
completely as I am.

950
00:54:43,141 --> 00:54:44,726
Because I'm also one of you...

951
00:55:07,081 --> 00:55:10,126
I know that even if the
whole world gives up on us...

952
00:55:11,127 --> 00:55:13,379
We will never give up on each other.

953
00:55:21,012 --> 00:55:22,889
You wanna put up your picture here?

954
00:55:23,806 --> 00:55:24,390
Me?

955
00:55:24,557 --> 00:55:25,683
You're Section E.

956
00:55:26,643 --> 00:55:27,643
I'm Section E.

957
00:56:09,102 --> 00:56:10,228
That's the second time.

958
00:56:11,229 --> 00:56:12,229
Why are you crying?

959
00:56:14,565 --> 00:56:15,608
I'm just happy.

960
00:56:16,234 --> 00:56:18,069
Is it about what you asked earlier?

961
00:56:23,157 --> 00:56:24,325
If it is...

962
00:56:25,284 --> 00:56:26,284
I'll be here.

963
00:56:30,289 --> 00:56:31,874
Ready to tease you.

964
00:56:56,232 --> 00:56:58,401
I'm not gonna give up on this family.

965
00:57:09,495 --> 00:57:13,583
[text message]
I'm not leaving Section E.

966
00:57:15,793 --> 00:57:17,503
Picture! Picture!

967
00:57:27,581 --> 00:57:29,057
Hey, let me join!

968
00:57:30,141 --> 00:57:31,224
Come on!

969
00:57:31,225 --> 00:57:32,435
Go to the front, Jay!

970
00:57:33,019 --> 00:57:35,729
Section E on 3.1, 2, 3.

971
00:57:35,730 --> 00:57:38,941
Section E!

972
00:58:56,352 --> 00:58:57,603
What the hell is happening?

973
00:58:57,728 --> 00:58:58,896
I'm starting to recall...

974
00:58:59,147 --> 00:59:01,732
We were celebrating at Keifer's house.

975
00:59:01,816 --> 00:59:03,776
Jay-jay, what a drinker!

976
00:59:04,235 --> 00:59:05,862
Hey... what are you doing?

977
00:59:06,028 --> 00:59:08,613
Jasper Jean Mariano. I, Yuri Hanamitchi.

978
00:59:08,614 --> 00:59:09,532
I'm asking you.

979
00:59:09,532 --> 00:59:10,366
Will you marry me?

980
00:59:10,449 --> 00:59:11,491
Ta-da!

981
00:59:11,492 --> 00:59:13,511
Ci-N? What are you doing here?

982
00:59:13,536 --> 00:59:14,512
Is he your boyfriend?

983
00:59:14,537 --> 00:59:15,954
Keifer's the name of her boyfriend.

984
00:59:15,955 --> 00:59:16,955
What are you saying?!

985
00:59:17,415 --> 00:59:19,125
Merry Christmas, everyone!

986
00:59:19,417 --> 00:59:21,127
Time to open our gifts!

987
00:59:22,461 --> 00:59:23,379
Open it.

988
00:59:23,379 --> 00:59:24,255
Do you wear things like that?

989
00:59:24,256 --> 00:59:25,776
What would I do with this white dress?

990
00:59:26,090 --> 00:59:27,234
My debut is still a long time from now.

991
00:59:27,258 --> 00:59:28,718
Why do I need to wear this dress?

992
00:59:29,302 --> 00:59:30,303
Hanamitchi Hotel.

993
00:59:30,636 --> 00:59:32,276
Angelo, maybe I can change clothes first.

994
00:59:32,388 --> 00:59:34,223
I know the owner of this hotel. It's Yuri.

995
00:59:34,515 --> 00:59:36,934
Whatever happens, we will explain it later.

996
00:59:37,101 --> 00:59:40,270
Allow me to also formally
announce to everybody here.

997
00:59:40,271 --> 00:59:44,900
The partnership between Fernandez
and Hanamitchi's corporation.

998
00:59:44,901 --> 00:59:46,526
Big round of applause.

999
00:59:46,527 --> 00:59:49,404
Everything is in chaos. So much
is happening, still you act this way.

1000
00:59:49,431 --> 00:59:51,664
Why can't you just answer my question?

1001
00:59:51,893 --> 00:59:52,893
Do you like Yuri?
