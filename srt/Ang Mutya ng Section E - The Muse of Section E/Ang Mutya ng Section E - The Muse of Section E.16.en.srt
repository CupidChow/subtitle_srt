1
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:18,143
This is it. Our new beginning.

2
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:19,561
- Is this Section E?
- Not here.

3
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:21,521
- But the guy said...
- Are you deaf?

4
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:22,564
Leave!

5
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:23,565
Hey.

6
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:24,858
Yuri!

7
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:26,608
Why are you treating
my classmates like dogs?!

8
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:29,654
Jasper Jean Fernandez Mariano.

9
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:33,199
Fernandez? Are you
related to Aries Fernandez?

10
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,616
Ouch!

11
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:36,076
I'm getting pissed at you! It hurts a lot!

12
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:38,036
If I end up looking like
Voldemort, you better...

13
00:00:38,037 --> 00:00:39,037
Don't move.

14
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:40,582
[boys reacting]

15
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,333
What is wrong with you?!

16
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,543
It's your fault!

17
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:46,504
You crazy woman!

18
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:47,629
- No!
- Ouch!

19
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:51,718
I will pay this cafe's
earnings for the whole day.

20
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,553
Just make every one of them leave.

21
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,305
Especially the judgmental ones.

22
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:56,639
Is he your boyfriend?

23
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:58,391
He's not her boyfriend.

24
00:00:58,475 --> 00:00:59,517
He's my classmate.

25
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:02,145
I'm gonna fuck them up
if they touch her. I swear.

26
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,063
Wait. Let me ask you first.

27
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,561
- Do you like Jay-jay?
- I think I'm falling for her.

28
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:10,653
Keifer is so handso...
They are so handsome!

29
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:13,281
Who is that unlucky guy you're falling for?

30
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,159
You see how that Keifer treats me.

31
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:19,370
Jay, I have a secret too.
You're the coolest girl I have ever met.

32
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,039
Keifer, you're too tense!

33
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,360
You were having fun, weren't you?

34
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,506
You're joining in too, Yuri, huh?

35
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:30,831
Are those two in love with me?

36
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,134
Yuri, do you really have to do this?

37
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:34,552
I need to fight.

38
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:35,553
Jay!

39
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,889
- Keifer?
- Just shut up. Hold my hand.

40
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,682
And get ready to run.

41
00:01:41,155 --> 00:01:43,199
We have to declare bankruptcy in Guam.

42
00:01:43,324 --> 00:01:44,784
I remember the Hanamitchis.

43
00:01:45,368 --> 00:01:47,328
They offered a business deal before, but...

44
00:01:47,537 --> 00:01:48,537
It's complicated.

45
00:01:48,913 --> 00:01:51,958
I want you to think about
what you feel for Keifer.

46
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:54,252
Jay, I'll never hurt you.

47
00:01:54,335 --> 00:01:55,335
Is that a ring?

48
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,060
Where did you get it? Who gave it to you?

49
00:01:57,213 --> 00:02:00,091
From someone whose thoughts
I don't really understand.

50
00:02:00,216 --> 00:02:01,968
- The ring is so pretty.
- Did you like it?

51
00:02:02,051 --> 00:02:03,428
Why did you give it to me?

52
00:02:03,594 --> 00:02:04,679
Bring me...

53
00:02:05,054 --> 00:02:06,139
something...

54
00:02:06,347 --> 00:02:07,348
you...

55
00:02:07,557 --> 00:02:08,599
love.

56
00:02:09,851 --> 00:02:11,394
Why am I getting carried all the time?

57
00:02:11,561 --> 00:02:12,841
'Cause I'm in love with Jay-jay.

58
00:02:20,695 --> 00:02:21,348
Shit!

59
00:02:21,654 --> 00:02:23,031
What the hell is happening?

60
00:02:27,535 --> 00:02:30,299
There are things I can't
remember clearly from last night.

61
00:02:30,662 --> 00:02:31,997
And one of those is...

62
00:02:37,128 --> 00:02:38,212
Come here!

63
00:02:39,172 --> 00:02:40,256
I'm starting to recall...

64
00:02:41,382 --> 00:02:43,760
We were celebrating at Keifer's house.

65
00:02:44,594 --> 00:02:46,971
The rest of the boys went home,
so we weren't complete.

66
00:02:47,346 --> 00:02:48,347
But still, it was fine.

67
00:02:52,185 --> 00:02:53,853
Let's summon it!

68
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,188
Summon it!

69
00:02:55,229 --> 00:02:56,397
Come out!

70
00:02:56,647 --> 00:02:58,065
[cheering]

71
00:02:58,816 --> 00:03:00,151
Come out now!

72
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:01,652
Hey! Join us!

73
00:03:14,874 --> 00:03:16,793
[chanting gibberish]

74
00:03:18,211 --> 00:03:22,840
Shit! So embarrassing!
How did I end up doing that?

75
00:03:25,092 --> 00:03:26,092
But it's not just that...

76
00:03:26,844 --> 00:03:28,204
Something more important happened.

77
00:03:29,722 --> 00:03:30,973
Before I got drunk...

78
00:03:34,852 --> 00:03:35,436
Damn!

79
00:03:35,812 --> 00:03:36,812
It's too cold.

80
00:03:37,855 --> 00:03:40,191
Jay, I'm freezing here.
Will you warm me up?

81
00:03:40,483 --> 00:03:41,733
Something to fire me up.

82
00:03:41,734 --> 00:03:43,152
Anyone got a lighter?

83
00:03:43,277 --> 00:03:45,237
I'll just set this one on fire.
Said he's freezing.

84
00:03:45,238 --> 00:03:46,739
[laughing]

85
00:03:47,281 --> 00:03:49,158
- Here. Just eat this.
- No, thanks.

86
00:03:52,453 --> 00:03:53,620
- Felix!
- Hey!

87
00:03:53,621 --> 00:03:54,497
Merry Christmas!

88
00:03:54,498 --> 00:03:55,790
That's what I'm talking about!

89
00:03:55,998 --> 00:03:57,250
Here we go!

90
00:03:57,667 --> 00:03:59,126
Woo-hoo!

91
00:03:59,877 --> 00:04:00,878
Let's go!

92
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:03,047
This will fire up this party!

93
00:04:03,381 --> 00:04:04,381
What do you want, Jay?

94
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:06,299
Cheers!

95
00:04:09,136 --> 00:04:10,263
Give me a bottle.

96
00:04:13,683 --> 00:04:16,059
- You got wet.
- One bottle, not one bath.

97
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,353
[laughing]

98
00:04:20,565 --> 00:04:21,816
Wait, I'll just eat a bit.

99
00:04:22,441 --> 00:04:24,193
Jay-jay, what a drinker!

100
00:04:24,485 --> 00:04:25,486
[laughing]

101
00:04:26,404 --> 00:04:27,404
What's so funny?

102
00:04:27,655 --> 00:04:30,295
It's just my first bottle,
and you're already calling me a drinker?

103
00:04:32,952 --> 00:04:34,036
Cheers!

104
00:04:34,871 --> 00:04:35,871
Hey! Hey! Hey!

105
00:04:36,038 --> 00:04:37,164
Don't even think about it!

106
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,915
- Why?
- Jay, he can drink, you know.

107
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:39,834
What do you mean "why?"

108
00:04:39,835 --> 00:04:40,918
Let him be a man.

109
00:04:41,085 --> 00:04:42,085
Let him drink.

110
00:04:42,295 --> 00:04:43,629
Yeah, Jay. Allow him to drink.

111
00:04:43,963 --> 00:04:46,089
How will he turn into a real man
if you stop him from drinking?

112
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,967
So, drinking turns you
into a real man, huh?

113
00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:49,427
What kind of thinking...

114
00:04:51,554 --> 00:04:52,554
What's with you guys.

115
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:53,681
Hey!

116
00:04:53,764 --> 00:04:55,975
Go, Jay! Chug! Chug! Chug!

117
00:04:56,726 --> 00:04:57,727
Take it slow!

118
00:04:59,145 --> 00:05:00,021
Let's go, Jay!

119
00:05:00,146 --> 00:05:01,146
What the hell!

120
00:05:01,814 --> 00:05:02,899
She finished it all?

121
00:05:05,276 --> 00:05:06,276
Cheers to that!

122
00:05:10,206 --> 00:05:11,165
You stupid jerk.

123
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:12,291
You're drunk again.

124
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:13,792
- Hey.
- Oh?

125
00:05:13,793 --> 00:05:14,835
Where are you going?

126
00:05:15,085 --> 00:05:16,085
He's drunk.

127
00:05:16,128 --> 00:05:17,838
I'm gonna let him
rest in the bedroom.

128
00:05:19,173 --> 00:05:20,257
Is there any food left?

129
00:05:20,382 --> 00:05:21,383
Just check over there.

130
00:05:21,592 --> 00:05:22,632
I think there's some left.

131
00:05:39,026 --> 00:05:40,026
Jay...

132
00:05:41,821 --> 00:05:42,821
Yeah?

133
00:05:44,654 --> 00:05:46,656
Are you mad at me for
what I did at the party?

134
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,008
- When I admitted that I...
- No.

135
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:52,470
Sorry, Jay.

136
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,271
I told you, I'm not mad.

137
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:58,984
Or maybe you got upset because
I didn't take your side earlier.

138
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,946
Listen to your tone of voice...

139
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,716
and the way you
furl your eyebrows.

140
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,908
It's furrowing.

141
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:10,036
You're upset, aren't you?

142
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,037
No.

143
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:12,914
I'm sorry, Jay.

144
00:06:13,082 --> 00:06:14,833
I should've taken your side.

145
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:17,919
Whatever.

146
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:20,964
I'm more annoyed
at how you view life.

147
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:22,508
You're all sexist.

148
00:06:24,802 --> 00:06:25,802
And besides...

149
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,943
You don't have any
obligations towards me.

150
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,765
Jay, don't ever speak that way.

151
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:33,227
I already told you how
I feel about you, didn't I?

152
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,770
So, from now on...

153
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:36,688
You're my obligation.

154
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:38,981
Huh?

155
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:43,362
Obligation as what?

156
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:47,908
Hey...

157
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:49,201
what are you doing?

158
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:52,495
Jay,

159
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:59,878
This is me trying to take
control of the situation, okay?

160
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:04,758
What situation?
What are you trying to say?

161
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:07,343
Jay...

162
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,929
I want you to know that...

163
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:11,514
I like you.

164
00:07:12,555 --> 00:07:13,597
That I want this.

165
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,980
I want it to come from me.
That I like you.

166
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:21,692
Yuri, please.

167
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:30,909
Jasper Jean Mariano.

168
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:35,581
I, Yuri Hanamitchi.

169
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:37,541
I'm asking you.

170
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,047
Will you marry me?

171
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:52,096
Yuri...

172
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,807
Marriage?

173
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:55,766
Already?

174
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,353
You said you don't want a boyfriend yet.

175
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:00,855
So here.

176
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:03,901
Instead of asking you
to be my girlfriend...

177
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,069
I'm asking you to be my wife.

178
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:10,991
You only drank one bottle,
but it seems you're already drunk.

179
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:13,701
Jay...

180
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:16,288
I'm serious. I'm not drunk.

181
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:19,041
Starting today,

182
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,500
you're my obligation.

183
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:23,378
And I'm gonna be on your
side against anything.

184
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,381
It's too sudden, Yuri.

185
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,090
I can't...

186
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,969
I can't give you an answer right now.

187
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:37,517
I'm sorry if I overwhelmed you.

188
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:40,603
Yuri...

189
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:43,523
I was just taken aback.

190
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,568
We're still so young,
but you're asking for marriage?

191
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,615
But I won't take back my proposal.

192
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:53,616
Please, Jay.

193
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:55,744
Really think about it.

194
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:58,205
It's fine even if
you don't answer now.

195
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:02,000
But let me know, okay?

196
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:03,125
I'll be waiting.

197
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:04,126
Please, Jay.

198
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:05,545
Think about it.

199
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:19,893
Yuri proposed to me.

200
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:31,029
But before Yuri's proposal...

201
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:35,367
I'm sure I saw Yuri
and Keifer talking last night.

202
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:48,672
They look so serious over there.
What could it be about?

203
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:53,468
Does that have something
to do with Yuri's proposal to me?

204
00:09:58,307 --> 00:10:01,018
Jay, your grandma's here.

205
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,063
Alright. I'm coming down in a bit.

206
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:37,863
Grandma's here.

207
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:39,157
Mom!

208
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:39,699
Grandma.

209
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:40,575
Hi, Mom!

210
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:41,201
Oh, Ma!

211
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:42,451
Grandma.

212
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:44,704
Jay-jay, how are you?

213
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:45,914
I'm doing okay.

214
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,418
Ta-da!

215
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,960
Ci-N?

216
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,130
It took you so long to fetch me.

217
00:11:53,255 --> 00:11:55,424
Good thing your friend arrived.

218
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,675
It was scorching hot out there.
He accompanied me.

219
00:11:57,968 --> 00:11:59,594
I'm glad I saw her.

220
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,346
Oh. He's nice.

221
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:03,348
What are you doing here?

222
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:05,517
Your boyfriend?

223
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:06,810
No!

224
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:07,436
I'm not.

225
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,145
Keifer's the name of her boyfriend.

226
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:10,146
What are you saying?

227
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,983
[Ci-N screams in pain]

228
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,735
Jay... you can be so rough, huh?

229
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:16,653
Huh?

230
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:17,612
That's enough.

231
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:20,073
Mom, come. Let's go over there.

232
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:21,867
I know you're tired.

233
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:24,661
You.

234
00:12:24,662 --> 00:12:26,287
- [Jay-jay screaming]
- What did he mean "boyfriend"?

235
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:28,164
- Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!
- You're prioritizing that over studying?

236
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:29,499
That's not true, Angelo!

237
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,751
Angelo, stop.

238
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:34,336
Did you take after me?

239
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,715
Is pinching a normal thing here?

240
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:38,800
It's happening one after another.

241
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:41,052
Come. Let's talk over there.

242
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:42,136
We're just gonna get snacks.

243
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:43,638
Yeah, yeah.

244
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:45,139
Hi, Grandma.

245
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,183
Ohh.

246
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:48,434
CNN, my dear!

247
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:49,435
It's Ci-N, ma'am.

248
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,063
- Ci-N?
- Yes, it's Ci-N.

249
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:53,397
- Ci-N.
- Yes.

250
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:54,900
- Ci-N.
- Okay.

251
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,986
Angelo, did you really have to do that?

252
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:00,530
Look at Jay-jay's ears.
They're so red!

253
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:02,449
It's her fault anyway.

254
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:06,285
You know, I'm letting you
discipline your cousin.

255
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:10,207
But don't be so harsh to the point
that her ears would fall off.

256
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,668
And why not? We can't even
be sure if she's telling the truth.

257
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:16,587
Jay.

258
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:20,175
The one who gave you the ring,
is he your boyfriend?

259
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:21,949
Then who?

260
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:23,053
What?

261
00:13:23,054 --> 00:13:24,304
Someone gave you a ring?

262
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:25,889
Keifer gave you a ring?

263
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:27,848
No.

264
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:30,309
Could you please shut up?
Get out of here.

265
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,910
You keep running your mouth.
You're gonna get me in trouble again.

266
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,899
Grandma! Jay-jay's
being mean to me!

267
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:37,024
So what is it?

268
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:38,360
Who gave you the ring?

269
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,239
It was Yuri.

270
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:54,000
But really, I don't
have a boyfriend.

271
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:58,379
Okay.

272
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:01,131
Okay?

273
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:03,134
Are we done here?

274
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:08,264
Jay, bring this juice to your Grandma.

275
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:09,848
Go on. Angelo and I are gonna talk.

276
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:10,849
Alright.

277
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:19,733
You know, Grandma.
I'm pretty good at giving massages.

278
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:20,527
Massage?

279
00:14:20,528 --> 00:14:21,945
Grandma, here's your juice.

280
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,362
Your juice.

281
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,824
- Give it to me.
- Alright, alright.

282
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:27,700
- Let's sit down.
- You're getting this?

283
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:30,453
- Yes, leave it to me.
- Oh, really. Alright then.

284
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,914
But you'll still give me the massage?

285
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:35,332
Yes, of course.

286
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,876
You'll probably fall asleep.

287
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:38,461
What's that kid doing here?

288
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,381
I don't know.
He came here with Grandma.

289
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,299
Tell him to go home.

290
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,550
I'll take care of it for you.

291
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:47,721
You're quite good at
giving massages. Feels nice.

292
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:50,515
- Do that later.
- Sure thing.

293
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:53,059
You're rushing through it.

294
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:55,811
Are you sure about your decision?

295
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:57,188
About what I told you?

296
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,400
Wait, Grandma.
I'll just grab some juice.

297
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:03,069
Don't regret it.
I gave you a choice.

298
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:03,903
What's that?

299
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:05,112
What choice?

300
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:07,906
Nothing.

301
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,408
What is it?

302
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:11,703
Nothing! What do you need?

303
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,913
- Hi, Grandma.
- You didn't give me juice.

304
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,400
You're really obsessed with food.

305
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:17,167
Why are you even here?

306
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:20,626
How did you know we're gonna fetch Grandma?
You even went there ahead of us.

307
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:22,464
You told me at the Christmas Party.

308
00:15:22,631 --> 00:15:24,089
- When you were drunk...
- Shh!

309
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,215
You even showed me the...

310
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:27,217
Uh-uh. What are you talking about?

311
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:28,218
[Jay-jay chuckles]

312
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:29,179
Nothing, Grandma.

313
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:30,138
What's happening there?

314
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:31,680
Nothing. We're just fooling around.

315
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,057
But you're choking him, aren't you?

316
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:35,684
- What a strange way to joke around.
- No. We're just so close.

317
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:37,102
Oh, goodness.

318
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,397
Don't tell Grandma I got drunk.

319
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:41,732
Wait.

320
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:43,943
Are you really classmates?

321
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:45,027
Yes.

322
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:46,863
I'm just younger than Jay-jay.

323
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,405
I was accelerated.

324
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:49,199
Show-off.

325
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,116
Fine, you're smart.

326
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,118
Oh, I see.

327
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:56,414
But why are you roaming
around on Christmas Day?

328
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:58,458
Where are your parents?

329
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:02,295
Oh... they're at... work.

330
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,420
All the time.

331
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:05,423
Ahh.

332
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:10,094
Grandma,

333
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:13,264
maybe Ci-N can celebrate
Christmas here with us?

334
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:14,933
- Thank you, Jay!
- Ouch!

335
00:16:14,986 --> 00:16:17,786
- Thank you! Thank you!
- Wait a minute!

336
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:19,520
Grandma hasn't said anything yet.

337
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:21,689
No matter, Jay.
Still thank you so much.

338
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,023
Grandma, thank you.

339
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:24,984
You don't want to
wait for my answer?

340
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:27,070
Well, here's my answer.

341
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,156
Just live here.
We have so many rooms.

342
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,659
[Ci-N and Jay-jay cheering]

343
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:34,619
Thank you Grandma!

344
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:36,203
Thank you so much!

345
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:39,165
What room do you want?
Left or right?

346
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,499
How about the middle?

347
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,334
There, in the stairs?

348
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:42,377
Choose the middle.

349
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,754
- Don't be like that.
- No, I'm kidding.

350
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:47,298
Who will give me a massage otherwise?

351
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,675
Angelo...

352
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,303
Jay-jay's too young to get married.
Is there no other way?

353
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,014
That's our deal.

354
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,433
We have no choice.

355
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:57,767
And besides,

356
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,774
I made sure they
won't get married immediately.

357
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:01,646
It can be a long engagement.

358
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:04,023
They just need an assurance.

359
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:07,193
I'm not sure how
Jay-jay will react.

360
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:09,237
Huh? Me?

361
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:11,656
They're talking about me?

362
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:13,867
[clears throat]

363
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:16,578
What is it, Jay?

364
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:25,837
Can Ci-N celebrate
Christmas here in your house?

365
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:28,715
Grandma already approved.

366
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:31,301
Our house, Jay.
This is your house too.

367
00:17:31,843 --> 00:17:32,843
Our house.

368
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:36,806
Did he ask permission from home?

369
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,851
There's no one at their house.

370
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:43,438
Sure, it's fine.

371
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:44,689
Really?

372
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:45,814
Mm-hmm.

373
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:49,110
Thank you, Auntie Gemma.

374
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:52,822
See?

375
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:54,365
The more, the merrier.

376
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:57,786
We have another
guest apart from Ella.

377
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:04,584
That's right. Ella's gonna be
here for Christmas dinner.

378
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:09,964
- I'll go ahead. I'll give Ci-N his juice.
- Go ahead.

379
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:37,783
Rosario!

380
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:38,910
It's your turn!

381
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,203
Ta-da!

382
00:18:40,204 --> 00:18:41,371
[clapping]

383
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:43,497
Thank you. Merry Christmas.

384
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:44,374
Okay.

385
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:45,374
Ruth!

386
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:49,170
- Thank you so much!
- Okay. Merry Christmas!

387
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,592
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.

388
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,719
- Is there a magnet on your nose?
- Yeah, inside.

389
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,264
- Oh my gosh. It's really sticking?
- Yeah! I told you.

390
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:01,182
- So cool.
- It's not gonna fall off.

391
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:03,434
- You have a very high nose.
- Oh, you just arrived?

392
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:05,228
What are you doing?

393
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,064
That's the latest edition.

394
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:09,691
Hey, listen up.

395
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,611
Jay-jay, your sweater
looks just like my cat.

396
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:16,488
Look, I have a picture of it.

397
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,324
You wanna see the picture?

398
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:20,325
Here it is. Look. My cat.

399
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:21,077
Can I see?

400
00:19:21,078 --> 00:19:22,744
- Ohhh.
- Exactly alike.

401
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:24,080
She's right.

402
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:26,457
How about you?
Do you guys like cats?

403
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:27,583
I can't have cats.

404
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:30,002
They scratch a lot.

405
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:35,592
Merry Christmas, Jay.
Thank you for that talk.

406
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,802
Even though my Christmas is a little blue,

407
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,804
I felt better because of our talk.

408
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:46,394
Merry Christmas, Kit.

409
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:49,188
I still believe that love wins in the end.

410
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,024
#MayoKit.

411
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,819
He can't even do that.

412
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,155
But he's got a good nose.

413
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:59,324
Grandma, do you like cats?

414
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:02,827
I guess so, why?

415
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,119
[Ci-N clears throat]

416
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:05,914
[Ci-N meows like a cat]

417
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,126
Oh, he's kinda like...

418
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:18,009
Merry Christmas, Jay.

419
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:23,264
You know my Christmas wouldn't
be merry if you didn't help me with Mica.

420
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:26,976
Thank you for being our blessing, Jay!

421
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:33,524
Merry Christmas to you love birds!

422
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,819
I hope everybody has
a lovelife this season.

423
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,031
Oh, so sweet.

424
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:42,324
This cat is too cute.

425
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:45,745
- I'm just naturally sweet.
- You two are too sweet to each other.

426
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,167
Merry Christmas.

427
00:20:56,714 --> 00:21:00,173
Merry Christmas in Japan!
Bring home some snow for me.

428
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:04,555
By the way, we ordered food from Botejyu.
My favorite. The one you gave me.

429
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:09,894
[family chattering]

430
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:15,817
[family continues laughter and chatter]

431
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:17,735
My battery's almost dead.

432
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:19,821
I'm still waiting for the greeting of...

433
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:24,909
Maybe he won't say a thing.
What could he be up to?

434
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,707
Merry Christmas, Jay.

435
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:35,920
What's up with him? His text is so dry.

436
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:37,797
Not even a smiley?

437
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:44,971
Merry Christmas to you too.

438
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:10,746
Okay, time to open our gifts!

439
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:12,665
- Quickly!
- Okay!

440
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,753
Oh my God!

441
00:22:16,754 --> 00:22:18,462
Oh, that's beautiful!

442
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:20,631
- Thank you so much, babe!
- That is really pretty.

443
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:25,260
[Ci-N cheering]

444
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:26,803
Thank you, Jay!

445
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:27,764
Thank you, Jay!

446
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:28,764
Of course!

447
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:30,223
I love it.

448
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:34,728
Wow!

449
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:36,529
- Wow, this is beautiful.
- Thank you so much.

450
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,317
- Are you happy?
- Yeah. Super.

451
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:41,694
- Let me see.
- Thank you, Jay.

452
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,654
It's so fun here, right?

453
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:46,240
It's so fun being Grandma's grandkid.

454
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:47,992
You're such a joker.

455
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:50,203
What did you get?

456
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:52,704
Open it.

457
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:54,665
- Wait a minute.
- You're so slow.

458
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:57,335
Does it suit me, Mom?

459
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:01,165
I think Santa didn't know
what you want for Christmas.

460
00:23:01,631 --> 00:23:02,791
Do you wear things like that?

461
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:04,257
What do you mean "Santa?"

462
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:06,121
You really are a kid, aren't you?

463
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:07,720
You still believe in Santa.

464
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,556
It's either Auntie Gemma
bought it or Angelo.

465
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:13,269
Why would your aunt give
you something like that?

466
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:14,811
Aren't you happy?

467
00:23:14,811 --> 00:23:15,811
I'm not sure...

468
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:18,064
Maybe it's for your 18th birthday.

469
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:20,440
What would I do with this
white dress? And besides...

470
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:22,001
My debut is still a long time from now.

471
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:23,027
Well, anyway.

472
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:25,737
- Merry Christmas, Ci-N.
- Merry Christmas, Jay!

473
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:27,740
Merry Christmas, everyone!

474
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:30,159
Merry Christmas.

475
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:32,619
This is so fun.

476
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:35,581
What is this? Does it even fit?

477
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,297
- Pretty.
- It's so long.

478
00:23:44,382 --> 00:23:45,758
Like a ghost's dress...

479
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:47,802
Just kidding.

480
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,888
[family chattering]

481
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:53,975
Merry Christmas. It's so nice.

482
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:55,268
Look at this, Grandma.

483
00:24:11,993 --> 00:24:14,162
One week passed in the blink of an eye.

484
00:24:14,801 --> 00:24:16,261
New year's eve is approaching.

485
00:24:17,406 --> 00:24:19,700
I don't even know why we're here.

486
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:28,885
Jay-jay, stop pulling on it. You look fine!
There's no need to be conscious.

487
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:31,818
I just don't feel comfortable wearing this.

488
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:33,639
Is it required to wear a dress?

489
00:24:34,015 --> 00:24:35,391
Just hold on for a bit, Jay-jay.

490
00:24:40,021 --> 00:24:41,181
Angelo, what happened to you?

491
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:43,399
Is something wrong?

492
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:46,694
Why are we celebrating New Year here?

493
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:49,238
Why did you allow Aries
not to celebrate with us?

494
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:50,948
Aries went ahead of us.

495
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:52,199
He will be here.

496
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:54,159
Okay.

497
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:56,703
Hanamitchi Hotel...

498
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:01,584
Yuri's really something, huh?
They have so many hotel branches.

499
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:03,724
Angelo, maybe I can change clothes first.

500
00:25:03,753 --> 00:25:05,730
I know the owner of this hotel. It's Yuri.

501
00:25:05,755 --> 00:25:07,155
Though he's not in the country now.

502
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:09,634
Jay, your friend Yuri...

503
00:25:10,051 --> 00:25:12,178
Did he say something
to you before he travelled?

504
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:16,557
Nothing really. Why?

505
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:19,184
Do you like him?

506
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:20,019
Huh?!

507
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:21,020
Uh...

508
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:22,312
Jay-jay,

509
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,106
whatever happens...

510
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:27,610
Just...

511
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:30,570
Don't get mad, okay?

512
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:32,365
We will explain everything later.

513
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:35,325
I don't understand, Grandma.

514
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:37,453
Later. We will explain it.

515
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:40,665
What's happening? Why later?

516
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:42,749
Maybe it's better to
tell me now, because...

517
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,230
- I'm getting anxious already.
- No...

518
00:25:44,502 --> 00:25:46,712
Mr. Fernandez? This way, please.

519
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:49,257
Come on.

520
00:25:52,677 --> 00:25:54,303
- What was that?
- Oh, nothing.

521
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:57,723
- Did you step on your dress?
- Yes, Grandma.

522
00:26:07,288 --> 00:26:08,581
Hello, Mr. Fernandez.

523
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:11,988
Good evening, Mrs. Fernandez.

524
00:26:13,051 --> 00:26:14,301
Madam, this way.

525
00:26:14,581 --> 00:26:15,581
Thank you.

526
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:17,910
Hi!

527
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:20,036
Hello!

528
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:21,788
Sir.

529
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:23,582
- Happy New Year!
- Good to see you.

530
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:25,918
Good to see you.

531
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:31,089
Happy New Year!

532
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:33,425
Hello.

533
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:36,846
- Hello.
- Good to see you.

534
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:38,346
Hello.

535
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:41,100
Jay.

536
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:43,977
I'd like you to meet Mr. Yumori Hanamitchi.

537
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:45,770
And Mrs. Yakito Hanamitchi.

538
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:46,897
Hello.

539
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,525
- [in Japanese] Hello.
- [in Japanese] Hello.

540
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:51,027
Father is right.

541
00:26:51,736 --> 00:26:52,945
You are very pretty.

542
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:54,572
[speaking Japanese]

543
00:26:55,156 --> 00:26:55,990
Thank you.

544
00:26:55,991 --> 00:26:58,074
Hello, Jay. It's nice to finally meet you.

545
00:26:58,075 --> 00:26:58,951
Hello!

546
00:26:58,951 --> 00:26:59,951
I like your hair.

547
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,038
Thank you.

548
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:04,248
- Say hi to them.
- Hello.

549
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:07,376
Anyway, make yourself comfortable.

550
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,669
Please enjoy the party.

551
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:10,713
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

552
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:12,798
Enjoy.

553
00:27:13,341 --> 00:27:14,425
Let's talk again later.

554
00:27:14,717 --> 00:27:15,176
Sure.

555
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:16,761
Let's talk later.

556
00:27:17,345 --> 00:27:18,345
Enjoy.

557
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:19,804
Here's your bag.

558
00:27:26,912 --> 00:27:28,914
Good thing Keifer's here too.

559
00:27:28,957 --> 00:27:30,124
Would you believe it?

560
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:33,029
Even with his back turned towards me,
I can't mistake him for anyone else.

561
00:27:45,054 --> 00:27:47,390
So they're talking again, huh?

562
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:49,877
Where is Aries?

563
00:27:50,211 --> 00:27:51,253
What is happening?

564
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:04,765
- Waiter... can I have some water?
- Okay.

565
00:28:05,992 --> 00:28:06,620
Here Ma'am.

566
00:28:06,644 --> 00:28:10,314
Let's enjoy a beautiful performance
from our guest singer

567
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:12,900
rendering an equally beautiful song.

568
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:15,778
[applause]

569
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:35,339
This song... It has always
been close to my heart.

570
00:28:35,506 --> 00:28:37,800
But it became more special because...

571
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:50,855
It should've been us.
The two of us, Keifer...

572
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,492
Alright. Thank you so much
for that lovely rendition.

573
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:07,037
Please, a round of applause, everybody.

574
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:11,959
It was breathtaking
and spellbinding indeed.

575
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:14,169
Of course the night is still young.

576
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:16,296
And the festivities don't end there.

577
00:29:16,297 --> 00:29:20,508
So at this juncture in the program,
I would like to invite everybody...

578
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:23,511
to take center stage
and dance the night away.

579
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:24,763
By all means!

580
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:26,431
Alright.

581
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:27,765
Let's go.

582
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:40,488
Jay.

583
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:41,739
Let's dance.

584
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,450
Oh?

585
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:46,868
Didn't know you're back already.

586
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:47,661
Yeah.

587
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:48,870
Where's my souvenir?

588
00:29:48,913 --> 00:29:50,079
Happy New Year.

589
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,748
- I'll give it to you later, okay?
- Mine too.

590
00:29:51,749 --> 00:29:53,375
- Let's dance first.
- My souvenir!

591
00:29:53,501 --> 00:29:55,544
Like this. One, two, three. Go.

592
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:05,712
Four, three, two, one.

593
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:06,888
Am I doing it right?

594
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:07,972
Go ahead.

595
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:09,307
Just dance.

596
00:30:09,934 --> 00:30:10,934
There.

597
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:15,271
It's hard!

598
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:16,731
You don't know how.

599
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:30,663
Just move. You can do it.

600
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:31,871
Like this.

601
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:34,749
Here, here, here.

602
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:36,167
There you go.

603
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:37,710
Like that.

604
00:30:40,965 --> 00:30:41,966
See? You got it.

605
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:45,468
Move it, Jay!

606
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:47,428
There.

607
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:48,973
There you go.

608
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,393
Now you can do it!

609
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:29,138
Let's take a seat.

610
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:30,723
Hold on. Let's stay here.

611
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:36,895
Good evening, everybody!
And a Happy, Happy New Year!

612
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:39,897
Outside of the New Year Festivities...

613
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:42,108
we're also celebrating something else.

614
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:46,195
The birthday of our very own,
Mr. Yuri Hanamitchi!

615
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:48,281
- It's your birthday?
- Come up on stage!

616
00:31:48,282 --> 00:31:50,784
- Happy birthday!
- Yuri, come here!

617
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,081
Come up with me.

618
00:31:56,457 --> 00:31:58,334
- Happy birthday!
- Come on.

619
00:31:59,335 --> 00:32:00,335
Are you sure?

620
00:32:00,336 --> 00:32:01,586
- Alright.
- Just trust me, okay?

621
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:03,296
Come here, Yuri.

622
00:32:03,297 --> 00:32:04,672
Let's see what you got. Come here.

623
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:06,717
So we can have a better look at him, right?

624
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:08,093
Hi there, Yuri.

625
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:13,974
Happy birthday to you. And on my count,
let's sing him a happy birthday, shall we?

626
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:15,768
One, two, three!

627
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:21,689
[singing Happy Birthday Song]

628
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:22,690
That's the spirit.

629
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:24,192
[singing Happy Birthday Song]

630
00:32:24,193 --> 00:32:24,902
Louder!

631
00:32:24,903 --> 00:32:32,903
[singing Happy Birthday Song]

632
00:32:33,786 --> 00:32:36,413
Alright, happy birthday once again, Yuri!

633
00:32:38,749 --> 00:32:42,961
So much smiles for Yuri. We heard
there so much to be celebrating about.

634
00:32:43,087 --> 00:32:47,257
In fact, allow me to also formally\
announce to everybody here.

635
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:52,303
The partnership between
the Fernandez and Hanamitchi corporation.

636
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:55,599
Big round of applause!
And let's toast to that!

637
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:02,106
That deserves some adulation.

638
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,149
Cause for celebration.

639
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:08,612
Congratulations.

640
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:11,072
And lastly, but not to be outdone.

641
00:33:11,073 --> 00:33:15,618
As a symbol of this brand
new partnership to be forged...

642
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:19,247
Allow me to be the one to,
of course, tell everybody...

643
00:33:19,248 --> 00:33:21,332
About the engagement of these two.

644
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:28,340
Mr. Yuri Hanamitchi and none other than,
Jasper Jean Fernandez Mariano!

645
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:31,176
Beautiful couple, these two, right?

646
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:41,812
Let's raise a toast!

647
00:33:43,147 --> 00:33:46,734
Let's raise a toast to
the newly-engaged couple.

648
00:33:49,987 --> 00:33:51,320
Big, big hand.

649
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:53,741
- What do they mean, Yuri?
- Let's raise a toast!

650
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,500
- [in Japanese] Cheers!
- [in Japanese] Cheers!

651
00:34:01,415 --> 00:34:05,377
- And a big, big hand!
- Cheers!

652
00:34:11,133 --> 00:34:15,052
Alright. And now with that said, its's
time to dance the night away even more

653
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:18,515
with yet another
performance from Miss Mitch.

654
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:26,857
Congratulations.

655
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:31,152
Come on.

656
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:32,862
Let's dance, Jay.

657
00:35:41,348 --> 00:35:44,351
They know... they all know.

658
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:04,580
Does he know as well?

659
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:20,721
Is this a dream?

660
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:22,222
Marriage?

661
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:26,355
And it seems like all of them knew.
That's why they're acting strangely.

662
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:29,897
Angelo, Auntie Gemma, even Grandma.

663
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:33,275
Yuri... he knew about it
when he gave me that ring.

664
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:37,112
He knew already when he gave me that ring.

665
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:39,489
I'm the only one left in the dark.

666
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:43,226
Me, the one who got engaged.
I was made to look like a fool.

667
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:53,377
Jay...

668
00:36:56,173 --> 00:36:58,592
Just leave me alone, Angelo, please.

669
00:37:00,302 --> 00:37:02,429
I wanted to explain to you for a long time.

670
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:05,015
But I just can't get the right opportunity.

671
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:08,517
I'm sorry.

672
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:11,188
I had to do this to you.

673
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,357
But we had no choice.

674
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:18,987
You had the choice to tell me.

675
00:37:19,947 --> 00:37:23,575
Why didn't you tell me?
I had to learn about it here!

676
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,036
We really didn't know how to say this.

677
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:28,956
And we trust that you have
a good relationship with Yuri.

678
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:30,791
He gave you a ring.

679
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:32,167
So we assumed.

680
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:33,167
Assumed?!

681
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:36,212
Jay, the company's going bankrupt...

682
00:37:36,213 --> 00:37:38,006
But why me?!

683
00:37:40,092 --> 00:37:42,343
Yes, I owe your family.

684
00:37:42,344 --> 00:37:45,180
But that doesn't mean
you can control everything about me.

685
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:47,933
That you're gonna decide for me.

686
00:37:48,642 --> 00:37:52,145
Angelo, you didn't even
ask for my say in this.

687
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:55,565
We talked to Auntie Jeana about this.

688
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:58,527
And why did you talk to her instead of me?

689
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:00,237
Because she's your mother.

690
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:01,697
She's still your parent.

691
00:38:01,722 --> 00:38:04,116
You talked to my mother,
but how about Dad?!

692
00:38:05,445 --> 00:38:07,619
Did you ask for his permission?

693
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:18,672
Angelo...

694
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:24,094
I know I did a lot of wrong things.

695
00:38:24,678 --> 00:38:26,722
I messed up a lot.

696
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,853
But I'm trying my best to fix everything.

697
00:38:35,731 --> 00:38:39,860
Angelo, we're talking about marriage here.
This is my life at stake!

698
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:43,321
There's no one else we can hold on to, Jay.

699
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:45,614
You're our only hope.

700
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,995
When Mr. Hanamitchi
asked for your hand for Yuri...

701
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:51,955
I initially said no.

702
00:38:52,706 --> 00:38:55,208
But he said he doesn't want anything else.

703
00:38:57,794 --> 00:39:00,797
And besides, you have a
good relationship with Yuri.

704
00:39:01,131 --> 00:39:02,131
Right?

705
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:04,801
But Angelo, we're not together.

706
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,179
You're gonna have a comfortable life.

707
00:39:07,888 --> 00:39:09,431
This isn't just about the company.

708
00:39:10,057 --> 00:39:11,224
It's also about you.

709
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:14,895
A beautiful life awaits
you with the Hanamitchis.

710
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:17,647
You can just develop
your relationship with Yuri.

711
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:19,232
I know you can.

712
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:21,443
Angelo...

713
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:24,738
I don't want to get married.

714
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:30,077
I'm so young. I want to study.
I want to work.

715
00:39:32,329 --> 00:39:36,208
I want to get the things
I want through my own hard work.

716
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,140
You don't have to get married right away.

717
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,046
You still have a lot of
time to grow together.

718
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:54,351
Just think about it, Jay.

719
00:39:59,815 --> 00:40:00,815
For us.

720
00:40:03,944 --> 00:40:04,944
For you.

721
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:16,790
[Gemma] Is Jay-jay there?

722
00:40:19,251 --> 00:40:20,252
Jay?

723
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:24,631
Sorry we didn't tell you immediately.

724
00:40:26,967 --> 00:40:29,969
If you really don't
want to, let's tell them.

725
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:32,180
We'll find a way to fix everything.

726
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:36,518
Will it still be possible?

727
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:41,314
The whole world already
knows about this engagement.

728
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:46,111
If you don't want to, no one can force you.

729
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:50,532
But don't get angry at Angelo, because...

730
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:54,828
He's doing everything
for the sake of everyone.

731
00:40:56,538 --> 00:41:00,167
He has a huge responsibility
thrusted upon him.

732
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:04,337
Is it for everyone's sake or for himself?

733
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:09,968
Jay, the company has crumbled down.

734
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:15,724
Angelo's just thinking about...

735
00:41:16,725 --> 00:41:18,977
how he can support us all.

736
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:21,938
This is the only way he found.

737
00:41:23,273 --> 00:41:25,816
If you marry Yuri...

738
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:28,028
it will save the company.

739
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:34,075
He did what he thought he could.

740
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:40,707
What will happen if I refuse?

741
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:44,294
You will not get married.

742
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:48,381
What will happen to Fer Corp?

743
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:35,804
Jay, are you sure?

744
00:43:17,262 --> 00:43:19,723
Oh. My grandchild's back.

745
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:38,742
Jay-jay.

746
00:43:40,327 --> 00:43:41,661
I'm so sorry.

747
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:45,081
That we didn't tell you immediately.

748
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,334
I'm really truly sorry.

749
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:50,378
It's alright, Grandma.
I understand the situation now.

750
00:43:57,135 --> 00:43:58,762
I had no other choice.

751
00:44:04,434 --> 00:44:05,810
Excuse me for a bit.

752
00:44:09,773 --> 00:44:10,773
Jay.

753
00:44:22,118 --> 00:44:24,496
I'm sorry if you were taken
aback by what happened.

754
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:27,165
It's not my intention
to put you through this.

755
00:44:30,752 --> 00:44:31,795
It's okay, Yuri.

756
00:44:38,051 --> 00:44:41,471
Jay, if you're against this engagement, I
could talk to all of them right this moment.

757
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:44,265
I told you when I proposed, didn't I?

758
00:44:44,724 --> 00:44:46,518
That no matter what your answer might be,

759
00:44:46,893 --> 00:44:48,186
I will accept it.

760
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:52,273
Yuri... it's okay.

761
00:44:52,399 --> 00:44:53,650
I understand.

762
00:44:54,526 --> 00:44:55,526
Is that true?

763
00:45:19,259 --> 00:45:20,259
Jay...

764
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:23,304
I know you got overwhelmed
with what happened.

765
00:45:24,556 --> 00:45:25,807
But one day,

766
00:45:27,058 --> 00:45:29,894
you will realize why I had to do all this.

767
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:41,968
I'll just use the restroom for a bit.

768
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:45,275
Do you want me to go with you?

769
00:45:45,493 --> 00:45:48,329
Grandma... Auntie Gemma..
Excuse me for a bit.

770
00:46:24,741 --> 00:46:25,742
Keifer...

771
00:46:28,002 --> 00:46:29,002
Keifer...

772
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:45,094
It takes all of my being to be here...

773
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:47,305
To be with you, Jay.

774
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:55,395
Keifer...

775
00:46:56,731 --> 00:46:58,483
I will propose to Jay-jay tonight.

776
00:46:59,192 --> 00:47:00,193
Yeah. Right.

777
00:47:00,527 --> 00:47:02,320
I'm gonna fly to the moon.

778
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:04,154
Keifer...

779
00:47:06,449 --> 00:47:07,909
Oh. You're serious?

780
00:47:08,618 --> 00:47:09,869
Yes, I'm serious.

781
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:12,830
We're friends, that's
why I'm telling you this.

782
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:17,001
I'm gonna ask Jay-jay to marry me.

783
00:47:18,253 --> 00:47:19,253
What?

784
00:47:20,296 --> 00:47:21,756
What are you even talking about?

785
00:47:22,311 --> 00:47:23,590
You're not even together.

786
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:24,842
Because I love her.

787
00:47:29,013 --> 00:47:30,014
How about you, Keifer?

788
00:47:31,558 --> 00:47:33,518
Can you even admit that you love Jay-jay?

789
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:37,312
Be honest.

790
00:47:37,939 --> 00:47:39,190
Tell me the truth.

791
00:47:39,399 --> 00:47:40,399
Can you?

792
00:47:45,572 --> 00:47:46,573
Okay, yes.

793
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:47,739
Yes?

794
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:51,286
Yes. I have feelings for Jay-jay.

795
00:47:51,953 --> 00:47:53,246
So now you know.

796
00:47:53,788 --> 00:47:55,748
You know why I can't just lose.

797
00:47:56,291 --> 00:47:57,375
Propose?

798
00:47:58,918 --> 00:47:59,918
Yuri...

799
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:01,921
Aren't you afraid if she says no?

800
00:48:04,299 --> 00:48:06,259
Keifer, you're just worried she'll say yes.

801
00:48:07,176 --> 00:48:08,886
You don't have to do this.

802
00:48:10,138 --> 00:48:11,306
But I have to.

803
00:48:13,266 --> 00:48:14,642
I need to keep her away from you.

804
00:48:15,852 --> 00:48:16,436
Because...

805
00:48:16,728 --> 00:48:17,729
Right from the start...

806
00:48:17,854 --> 00:48:19,063
You wanted to hurt her, right?

807
00:48:20,064 --> 00:48:21,664
You were planning on breaking her heart.

808
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:25,193
Yuri.

809
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,405
I'm already past that.

810
00:48:27,572 --> 00:48:28,448
You know that.

811
00:48:28,449 --> 00:48:29,532
But you did plan it.

812
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:31,707
And that's why you're
capable of hurting her.

813
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:37,415
Jay-jay doesn't deserve to be hurt.

814
00:48:39,751 --> 00:48:41,961
We've been together since we're kids.

815
00:48:43,129 --> 00:48:46,507
I know you saw how your dad
hurt the ones you love.

816
00:48:47,342 --> 00:48:49,092
That's why it's easy for
you to hurt others as well.

817
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:50,720
Don't fucking compare me to him!

818
00:48:51,054 --> 00:48:52,334
What, you're gonna hurt me too?!

819
00:49:04,734 --> 00:49:05,734
Keifer...

820
00:49:07,236 --> 00:49:09,364
You're well aware that
I couldn't hurt Jay-jay.

821
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:13,201
Unlike you, the one who plotted
to hurt her since the beginning.

822
00:49:15,828 --> 00:49:17,348
You know I deserve to be with Jay-jay.

823
00:49:17,747 --> 00:49:19,290
That's why I'll protect her from you.

824
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,251
Yes, we're best friends.

825
00:49:22,794 --> 00:49:23,794
But now?

826
00:49:24,587 --> 00:49:26,422
I'd rather choose myself instead.

827
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,301
I'll fight for Jay-jay.

828
00:49:42,647 --> 00:49:45,274
Aren't you gonna invite
your girlfriend here?

829
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:51,572
Yuri's right.

830
00:49:52,615 --> 00:49:54,534
It was so easy for me to hurt Jay-jay.

831
00:49:55,702 --> 00:49:58,579
To make her fall in love with me
just to hurt her in the end.

832
00:49:59,622 --> 00:50:03,543
I resorted to violence because
that's what we saw in this household.

833
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:06,212
That's how my father was.

834
00:50:06,838 --> 00:50:08,756
Invite your girlfriend here.

835
00:50:09,298 --> 00:50:11,008
Stop calling her his girlfriend.

836
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,302
She's going to be engaged to Yuri.

837
00:50:15,596 --> 00:50:17,223
I heard everything last night.

838
00:50:17,724 --> 00:50:19,892
I think she's better off with Yuri.

839
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:28,568
It's a cycle.

840
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:32,905
And fighting for Jay means
pulling her into my lonely life.

841
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:35,450
I will just hurt her...

842
00:50:36,075 --> 00:50:37,075
even more.

843
00:50:37,744 --> 00:50:41,122
I would only scar Jay-jay,
the way my father scarred us.

844
00:50:42,165 --> 00:50:43,249
Especially Keigan.

845
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:10,817
Keifer...

846
00:51:12,111 --> 00:51:14,572
While Aries is in the men's room,

847
00:51:14,989 --> 00:51:17,033
I just need to tell you this.

848
00:51:18,618 --> 00:51:20,661
Aries told me something...

849
00:51:22,121 --> 00:51:24,040
I think you need to know as well.

850
00:51:26,667 --> 00:51:28,669
Because I know
there's something going on...

851
00:51:31,005 --> 00:51:32,673
between you and Jay-jay.

852
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:39,055
This party's not just a
New Year's Eve countdown.

853
00:51:39,305 --> 00:51:41,516
Or Yuri's birthday celebration.

854
00:51:42,725 --> 00:51:44,644
- It's the engagement...
- I know.

855
00:51:46,604 --> 00:51:47,604
You're aware?

856
00:51:48,272 --> 00:51:49,272
Yeah.

857
00:51:50,691 --> 00:51:52,276
And it's fine with you?

858
00:51:53,402 --> 00:51:56,822
The main reason why we wanted
Jay-jay out of Section E

859
00:51:56,823 --> 00:51:59,533
is for her to not be another Ella.

860
00:51:59,534 --> 00:52:02,411
Someone who could ruin
my friendship with Yuri.

861
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:08,960
But here we are.

862
00:52:09,377 --> 00:52:10,628
And here I am.

863
00:52:11,295 --> 00:52:12,755
Backing down from the fight.

864
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:21,889
That's...

865
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,058
That's our song.

866
00:52:32,608 --> 00:52:34,068
Are you okay?

867
00:52:39,991 --> 00:52:44,287
All this time, I've been so afraid
to be like my father.

868
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:47,248
That I forgot that I too...

869
00:52:47,874 --> 00:52:51,210
could love someone
unconditionally like my mother.

870
00:52:56,591 --> 00:52:57,591
No.

871
00:52:58,050 --> 00:52:59,343
It's not okay with me.

872
00:53:02,597 --> 00:53:04,265
This engagement is not okay.

873
00:53:09,061 --> 00:53:10,396
I will fight for her.

874
00:53:11,564 --> 00:53:13,024
I will fight for Jay-jay.

875
00:53:27,747 --> 00:53:28,747
I see.

876
00:53:29,916 --> 00:53:31,042
Excuse me.

877
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:48,476
Do you like Yuri?

878
00:53:53,606 --> 00:53:55,107
Do you like him?

879
00:53:56,651 --> 00:53:57,860
Keifer...

880
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:00,780
It's just...

881
00:54:02,657 --> 00:54:05,618
If you don't answer my question,
I will kiss you.

882
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:08,871
Keifer, let go of me.

883
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:13,042
Jay, why can't you just
answer my question.

884
00:54:14,585 --> 00:54:16,212
Do you like Yuri?

885
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:50,079
Damn it, Keifer.

886
00:54:51,414 --> 00:54:55,001
Everything is in chaos. So much
is happening, still you act this way.

887
00:54:58,587 --> 00:54:59,839
Profanity.

888
00:55:16,689 --> 00:55:18,106
I'm excited to see the fireworks.

889
00:55:18,107 --> 00:55:20,192
Yes, girl. I'm sure it's
gonna be so fantastic.

890
00:55:32,038 --> 00:55:33,414
I'm so close to you...

891
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:36,500
but there's so much in between us.

892
00:55:41,589 --> 00:55:42,589
My family...

893
00:55:43,299 --> 00:55:45,176
the family that took me in.

894
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:46,427
My secret.

895
00:55:47,386 --> 00:55:49,972
The plan to make you
fall that backfired on me.

896
00:55:52,016 --> 00:55:54,060
Yuri... My...

897
00:55:54,852 --> 00:55:56,395
My fiance.

898
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:57,897
My best friend.

899
00:56:16,207 --> 00:56:17,207
Jay-jay?

900
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:25,257
Where have you been?

901
00:56:25,258 --> 00:56:26,759
We were looking for you.

902
00:56:29,303 --> 00:56:30,554
I just needed some fresh air.

903
00:56:32,932 --> 00:56:34,058
Is that so?

904
00:56:34,558 --> 00:56:36,352
You could've asked me to join you.

905
00:56:39,021 --> 00:56:40,021
Shall we?

906
00:56:40,064 --> 00:56:41,398
Let's go up the roof deck.

907
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:43,317
They've been waiting for us there.

908
00:56:58,207 --> 00:57:00,376
- Cheers!
- Kampai!

909
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:07,633
You're both here.

910
00:57:09,552 --> 00:57:12,471
Yuri, I'll just take
Jay-jay for a while, okay?

911
00:57:13,013 --> 00:57:14,097
We'll come right away.

912
00:57:14,098 --> 00:57:15,098
Okay.

913
00:57:16,058 --> 00:57:17,058
Thank you.

914
00:57:18,853 --> 00:57:20,020
- Jay...
- Yes?

915
00:57:20,146 --> 00:57:23,357
I told you earlier,
we have to be pretty, especially you.

916
00:57:23,816 --> 00:57:26,735
Let's freshen up. I'll fix your make-up.

917
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:37,537
See? No one would notice you cried earlier.

918
00:57:37,538 --> 00:57:40,082
You gotta stay pretty, okay?

919
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:41,500
Smile.

920
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,500
Okay?

921
00:57:45,045 --> 00:57:46,005
Ready?

922
00:57:46,005 --> 00:57:47,005
Ready.

923
00:57:47,756 --> 00:57:48,756
Let's go.

924
00:57:58,434 --> 00:57:59,143
Cheers!

925
00:57:59,144 --> 00:58:00,186
To Jay-jay and Yuri.

926
00:58:04,398 --> 00:58:05,733
Hi!

927
00:58:06,025 --> 00:58:07,359
Welcome to the family.

928
00:58:08,652 --> 00:58:09,652
Thank you.

929
00:58:10,196 --> 00:58:14,033
We're very happy that you
accepted our son's proposal.

930
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:18,162
Soon, you'll be Mrs. Hanamitchi.

931
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:23,708
Cheers for them, [in Japanese] cheers!

932
00:58:23,709 --> 00:58:25,336
[in Japanese] Cheers!

933
00:58:25,628 --> 00:58:27,129
[chattering]

934
00:58:35,804 --> 00:58:37,556
Your daughter is very beautiful.

935
00:58:39,683 --> 00:58:40,683
Thank you.

936
00:58:40,768 --> 00:58:41,768
She's also smart.

937
00:58:41,936 --> 00:58:43,896
Excuse me. I'll just go to the washroom.

938
00:58:44,772 --> 00:58:45,772
Go ahead.

939
00:58:48,609 --> 00:58:49,777
I'll be in the washroom.

940
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:52,987
You might miss the fireworks.

941
00:58:52,988 --> 00:58:54,490
It will be so pretty.

942
00:58:56,408 --> 00:58:57,408
Just be quick.

943
00:58:57,785 --> 00:58:58,953
You're good?

944
00:59:08,796 --> 00:59:09,956
Keifer, what is it this time?

945
00:59:11,507 --> 00:59:12,507
Ouch.

946
00:59:13,926 --> 00:59:15,970
Why are you doing this to me?

947
00:59:18,222 --> 00:59:19,765
I am so confused, Keifer!

948
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:23,351
About the engagement, what's
going on with my family, and then you!

949
00:59:23,352 --> 00:59:24,519
You're flirting with me even though...

950
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:25,688
I'm not a flirt.

951
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:31,651
You're just too numb to
notice what I truly want to say.

952
00:59:31,652 --> 00:59:33,070
I'm not numb.

953
00:59:34,196 --> 00:59:36,740
I just don't want to assume
why you're acting this way.

954
00:59:37,032 --> 00:59:40,327
If I would assume that you like me,
but then you don't, what's the ending?

955
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:42,288
What if you assume that I like you?

956
00:59:43,455 --> 00:59:44,455
And then...

957
00:59:45,165 --> 00:59:46,208
you're right.

958
00:59:47,209 --> 00:59:48,209
Hmm?

959
00:59:48,377 --> 00:59:49,377
What's the ending?

960
00:59:56,176 --> 00:59:57,176
You see?

961
00:59:57,553 --> 01:00:01,265
You're too scared to assume even if
the truth slapped you in the face.

962
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:07,061
You keep thinking that
I'm still in love with someone else.

963
01:00:07,062 --> 01:00:10,982
So you close your mind to the fact
that I might really like you.

964
01:00:10,983 --> 01:00:11,984
Why?

965
01:00:12,151 --> 01:00:13,234
Am I wrong?

966
01:00:13,235 --> 01:00:15,070
And what if I answered
yes to that question?

967
01:00:16,655 --> 01:00:17,990
Since you started it,

968
01:00:19,241 --> 01:00:20,951
I'll clear things between us now.

969
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:23,662
Stop thinking that I might
still love someone else.

970
01:00:24,538 --> 01:00:27,291
And start thinking that
I might really like you.

971
01:00:28,167 --> 01:00:32,463
No! That I love you, to be exact.

972
01:00:40,179 --> 01:00:41,263
Everybody!

973
01:00:41,347 --> 01:00:43,140
Excuse me, the countdown's about to begin!

974
01:00:43,349 --> 01:00:44,349
Gather around!

975
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:47,603
And I'd like to say a few things.

976
01:00:50,731 --> 01:00:51,899
But how about me?

977
01:00:53,317 --> 01:00:54,860
And Yuri? We're already engaged.

978
01:00:55,611 --> 01:00:56,653
I'm telling you.

979
01:00:58,072 --> 01:00:59,406
I'll fight for you.

980
01:01:01,408 --> 01:01:03,160
Keifer, how about Ella?

981
01:01:03,369 --> 01:01:04,369
She doesn't matter.

982
01:01:05,204 --> 01:01:06,244
Ella doesn't matter to me.

983
01:01:09,208 --> 01:01:10,208
Because...

984
01:01:12,252 --> 01:01:13,252
You're the one I want.

985
01:01:17,049 --> 01:01:18,258
And away we go!

986
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:19,300
Ten!

987
01:01:19,385 --> 01:01:20,552
Nine!

988
01:01:21,512 --> 01:01:22,512
Eight!

989
01:01:23,806 --> 01:01:24,640
But Jay...

990
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:25,640
Seven!

991
01:01:26,183 --> 01:01:28,183
- I still have something I need to tell you.
- Six!

992
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:29,269
Five!

993
01:01:29,937 --> 01:01:32,137
- Something that I really need to say sorry for.
- Four!

994
01:01:32,523 --> 01:01:33,690
Three!

995
01:01:34,858 --> 01:01:36,276
- Two!
- I'm sorry for...

996
01:01:36,318 --> 01:01:37,444
One!

997
01:01:44,535 --> 01:01:46,787
Happy New Year!

998
01:01:50,374 --> 01:01:51,374
Cheers!

999
01:02:11,812 --> 01:02:13,105
I'm sorry, Jay...

1000
01:02:17,609 --> 01:02:18,652
I love you.

1001
01:03:54,790 --> 01:03:56,166
Why don't we take a picture?

1002
01:03:57,209 --> 01:03:57,793
Guys!

1003
01:03:57,960 --> 01:03:58,960
Guys, picture!

1004
01:04:01,672 --> 01:04:02,672
Smile!

1005
01:05:33,597 --> 01:05:34,597
Action!

1006
01:05:35,974 --> 01:05:36,433
Cut!

1007
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:37,767
[laughing]

1008
01:05:40,729 --> 01:05:43,315
Where is that freak... Freya!

1009
01:05:43,565 --> 01:05:44,900
[Director] It's Jay-jay.

1010
01:05:46,652 --> 01:05:48,654
Oh, gosh! I called myself!

1011
01:05:52,407 --> 01:05:53,408
Are you insane?!

1012
01:05:53,992 --> 01:05:55,285
I can't just let...

1013
01:05:55,346 --> 01:05:56,703
Mica... with Section D.

1014
01:05:56,828 --> 01:05:57,828
Sorry!

1015
01:06:01,124 --> 01:06:02,626
[Director] Look at Keifer.

1016
01:06:02,668 --> 01:06:03,877
Why are you smiling?

1017
01:06:04,002 --> 01:06:06,046
I walked to the wrong way.

1018
01:06:09,633 --> 01:06:10,801
Carry her, carry her.

1019
01:06:16,598 --> 01:06:17,598
Change your clothes.

1020
01:06:17,724 --> 01:06:21,060
Don't involve... HVIS... with...

1021
01:06:21,061 --> 01:06:21,728
Sorry.

1022
01:06:21,728 --> 01:06:22,728
[laughing]

1023
01:06:25,649 --> 01:06:26,400
Go change!

1024
01:06:26,401 --> 01:06:28,694
Don't bring shame to... HVIS.

1025
01:06:29,152 --> 01:06:30,152
Shame.

1026
01:06:30,487 --> 01:06:31,780
[Jay-jay laughing]

1027
01:06:34,032 --> 01:06:35,283
[Assistant director] Rolling!

1028
01:06:35,575 --> 01:06:36,775
[Assistant director] One more!

1029
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:38,286
[Director] There! There!

1030
01:06:38,453 --> 01:06:39,204
Okay?

1031
01:06:39,204 --> 01:06:39,955
Ready!

1032
01:06:39,955 --> 01:06:40,955
Wow!

1033
01:06:41,665 --> 01:06:43,458
I haven't said anything yet!

1034
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:45,377
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

1035
01:06:47,254 --> 01:06:49,255
[Director] One more
time, Keifer. It didn't hit her.

1036
01:06:49,256 --> 01:06:50,757
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1037
01:06:54,594 --> 01:06:55,011
Cut!

1038
01:06:55,262 --> 01:06:56,262
When I arrived...

1039
01:06:56,263 --> 01:06:58,056
he was taking off.. Jay's...

1040
01:06:58,724 --> 01:06:59,891
[laughing]

1041
01:07:03,353 --> 01:07:04,353
Are you alright?

1042
01:07:04,479 --> 01:07:05,646
[laughing]

1043
01:07:05,647 --> 01:07:06,481
Damn!

1044
01:07:06,648 --> 01:07:07,649
[laughing]

1045
01:07:09,151 --> 01:07:11,027
Why did he say that he knows my brother?

1046
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,030
Sorry.

1047
01:07:19,536 --> 01:07:20,162
Oh. Wait a minute.

1048
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:21,747
He peeped out.

1049
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:29,420
Action!

1050
01:07:29,421 --> 01:07:30,421
Exactly.

1051
01:07:31,506 --> 01:07:32,174
Okay. Bye.

1052
01:07:32,507 --> 01:07:34,009
[laughing]

1053
01:07:37,262 --> 01:07:38,722
Self?

1054
01:07:39,556 --> 01:07:41,224
What did really happen to him?

1055
01:07:43,727 --> 01:07:44,727
Why?

1056
01:07:44,936 --> 01:07:46,021
[laughing]

1057
01:07:59,201 --> 01:08:00,201
It's too hard!

1058
01:08:05,791 --> 01:08:06,791
Cut! One more!

1059
01:08:07,501 --> 01:08:08,001
[Director] And!

1060
01:08:08,168 --> 01:08:09,168
Talents to enter.

1061
01:08:09,294 --> 01:08:10,086
Oh!

1062
01:08:10,295 --> 01:08:11,546
Cut! Cut!

1063
01:08:14,716 --> 01:08:15,716
[Jay-jay screaming]

1064
01:08:18,053 --> 01:08:19,721
She fell. She fell down.

1065
01:08:20,514 --> 01:08:21,973
You punk. I tripped.

1066
01:08:22,182 --> 01:08:23,850
[Director] This is okay. It's a wrap!

1067
01:08:23,892 --> 01:08:25,393
[cheering]
