1
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,873
Ah, Jay. I wanna court you.

2
00:00:16,957 --> 00:00:18,040
Kiko, the thing is…

3
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:19,083
Everything alright?

4
00:00:19,084 --> 00:00:21,044
Jay. I'll wait for your answer.

5
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,464
We need to make sure
that his plan doesn't succeed.

6
00:00:24,631 --> 00:00:27,675
After two weeks of helping me out,
my dad finally recovered.

7
00:00:27,676 --> 00:00:29,218
Which means I can go
back to school again.

8
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:31,847
[Section E cheering]

9
00:00:32,014 --> 00:00:33,682
Oh no. What happened to you?

10
00:00:33,849 --> 00:00:34,516
Fuck Kiko!

11
00:00:34,641 --> 00:00:36,350
Jay, are you really letting Kiko court you?

12
00:00:36,351 --> 00:00:38,352
He's bragging it to all his friends.

13
00:00:38,353 --> 00:00:39,645
That you're gonna be his girlfriend.

14
00:00:39,646 --> 00:00:43,024
We're not telling you anything,
out of our concern for you.

15
00:00:43,025 --> 00:00:45,443
I don't want any of you to
get hurt because of me.

16
00:00:45,444 --> 00:00:47,486
What are you planning to do with Kiko?
You're not even telling me!

17
00:00:47,487 --> 00:00:49,031
So you're concerned about Kiko?!

18
00:00:49,156 --> 00:00:50,489
So what, you're really
not gonna tell me?

19
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:51,991
You're not allowed, Jay.

20
00:00:51,992 --> 00:00:53,284
Why can't you just take me with you?!

21
00:00:53,285 --> 00:00:54,869
You can't be there.

22
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,913
Is it because you're gonna
fight? Even you, Ci-N?

23
00:00:57,331 --> 00:00:58,372
Don't be so hard-headed.

24
00:00:58,373 --> 00:00:59,499
Ready for Round 2?

25
00:01:00,792 --> 00:01:04,379
Keifer Watson and the gang.
I have a surprise for all of you.

26
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:05,589
[Jay struggling]

27
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:06,590
Jay!

28
00:01:06,591 --> 00:01:09,384
You're so hard-headed!
You even followed us here!

29
00:01:13,055 --> 00:01:14,139
Jay!

30
00:01:17,726 --> 00:01:19,061
Am I dead?

31
00:01:23,398 --> 00:01:25,192
I really jumped that high.

32
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:26,902
[muffled]
Jay!

33
00:01:27,027 --> 00:01:28,027
Jay!

34
00:01:28,362 --> 00:01:29,362
Jay!

35
00:01:29,696 --> 00:01:30,696
Jay!

36
00:01:30,781 --> 00:01:31,781
Jay!

37
00:01:32,449 --> 00:01:33,449
Jay!

38
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:35,327
Are you crazy?

39
00:01:35,327 --> 00:01:36,447
What if we didn't catch you?

40
00:01:38,872 --> 00:01:39,872
Ram's running away!

41
00:01:40,457 --> 00:01:41,041
Chase them!

42
00:01:41,124 --> 00:01:42,167
- Let's go!
- Run, quickly!

43
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:42,793
You son of a bitch!

44
00:01:42,793 --> 00:01:43,793
Man up, asshole!

45
00:01:43,877 --> 00:01:44,877
Hey, get back here!

46
00:01:47,089 --> 00:01:48,089
Are you okay?

47
00:01:48,298 --> 00:01:49,299
Jay-jay, are you okay?

48
00:01:50,092 --> 00:01:51,092
Let me get you water.

49
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:52,259
What she needs is space.

50
00:01:54,346 --> 00:01:55,681
Can you please take this off?

51
00:01:56,807 --> 00:01:58,141
Is your head hurt?

52
00:02:06,274 --> 00:02:08,776
- Damn it, we let Ram get away.
- Are you really okay?

53
00:02:08,777 --> 00:02:10,569
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- You want some painkillers?

54
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:12,864
This is nothing, really.
Quit worrying about me.

55
00:02:13,407 --> 00:02:14,407
Stubborn!

56
00:02:17,202 --> 00:02:18,662
Here. Put it on your head.

57
00:02:21,915 --> 00:02:22,915
Tss.

58
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:24,167
Got the nerve to jump, huh?

59
00:02:24,751 --> 00:02:25,751
Jay-jay, are you okay?

60
00:02:27,504 --> 00:02:28,839
Yeah. Thank you.

61
00:02:31,133 --> 00:02:32,133
Jay.

62
00:02:32,509 --> 00:02:33,593
Don't ever do that again.

63
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,886
You made us all anxious.

64
00:02:35,971 --> 00:02:37,471
But what you did was so cool, Jay.

65
00:02:37,472 --> 00:02:39,141
"I believe I can fly" was the vibe.

66
00:02:39,933 --> 00:02:42,120
- [Ci-N laughing]
- Asshole, will you quit messing around?

67
00:02:42,144 --> 00:02:43,145
I'm sorry.

68
00:02:44,187 --> 00:02:46,440
I just wanted to escape Ram.

69
00:02:46,565 --> 00:02:47,941
Who is he anyway?

70
00:02:48,233 --> 00:02:49,860
He's the leader of another school gang.

71
00:02:50,527 --> 00:02:51,820
We had fights before.

72
00:02:52,779 --> 00:02:54,156
That's why he targeted you.

73
00:02:54,614 --> 00:02:55,949
Because you can't listen.

74
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:57,799
You get dragged into
other people's mess.

75
00:02:58,577 --> 00:02:59,661
I said I'm sorry.

76
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:03,289
Wait...

77
00:03:03,457 --> 00:03:05,667
It was your fault that
I followed you there!

78
00:03:14,676 --> 00:03:16,094
Ah. Kiko…

79
00:03:16,928 --> 00:03:18,346
Can I talk to you?

80
00:03:19,973 --> 00:03:21,641
Just… the two of us.

81
00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:23,393
Okay.

82
00:03:25,729 --> 00:03:26,980
Don't you have to go home?

83
00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:29,232
No, I can stay for Jay.

84
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,906
Yuri, let's buy chocolates.

85
00:03:36,573 --> 00:03:37,574
You too, David. Let's go.

86
00:03:38,492 --> 00:03:39,993
You come too. Let's buy chocolates.

87
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:42,829
Come on. Chocolate. Yuri.

88
00:04:03,308 --> 00:04:04,434
Hey, Jay. What's up?

89
00:04:08,814 --> 00:04:09,523
Kiko...

90
00:04:09,524 --> 00:04:12,984
Well, listen.
If David said anything...

91
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:15,612
Believe me... it's not what I meant.

92
00:04:16,404 --> 00:04:17,989
Kiko, I'll be straight to the point.

93
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:21,993
I really don't want to have
a boyfriend right now.

94
00:04:23,245 --> 00:04:24,871
It's not that I don't like you.

95
00:04:26,581 --> 00:04:28,124
I'm just not interested in anyone.

96
00:04:30,544 --> 00:04:31,878
I hope you understand.

97
00:04:33,755 --> 00:04:34,755
I understand.

98
00:04:35,465 --> 00:04:36,925
I'll still be here for you, Jay.

99
00:04:38,385 --> 00:04:39,385
Thank you, Kiko.

100
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:40,761
I'm really sorry.

101
00:04:42,764 --> 00:04:43,764
It's okay.

102
00:04:49,437 --> 00:04:50,897
I should go.

103
00:04:52,858 --> 00:04:53,858
Bye, Jay.

104
00:04:55,527 --> 00:04:56,987
Chocolate's really delicious, right?

105
00:04:58,738 --> 00:04:59,823
It's so good.

106
00:05:00,907 --> 00:05:02,075
Hey. Where is he?

107
00:05:03,159 --> 00:05:04,286
You rejected him?

108
00:05:04,953 --> 00:05:05,953
Mm-hmm.

109
00:05:06,246 --> 00:05:07,455
You're really something else.

110
00:05:08,164 --> 00:05:09,499
You're amazing, Jay.

111
00:05:13,962 --> 00:05:15,630
Jay, go straight home.

112
00:05:16,006 --> 00:05:16,798
Get some rest.

113
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:18,466
So many things happened today.

114
00:05:19,342 --> 00:05:20,342
Yeah, sure.

115
00:05:22,929 --> 00:05:23,597
Oh!

116
00:05:23,805 --> 00:05:25,223
I'll do it. I can handle this.

117
00:05:26,558 --> 00:05:27,851
Jay, I'll take you home.

118
00:05:29,352 --> 00:05:30,352
I'm okay.

119
00:05:31,021 --> 00:05:32,021
I insist.

120
00:07:14,332 --> 00:07:15,332
[David coughs]

121
00:07:18,003 --> 00:07:20,839
David, I know you have
something to say. Just spill it.

122
00:07:24,342 --> 00:07:25,342
Jay...

123
00:07:25,802 --> 00:07:27,762
I know you feel bad about what we did.

124
00:07:28,847 --> 00:07:29,847
And so?

125
00:07:31,182 --> 00:07:32,182
I'm sorry.

126
00:07:32,517 --> 00:07:35,145
But you have to understand that
we don't want you to get hurt.

127
00:07:36,563 --> 00:07:38,231
I understand where you're coming from.

128
00:07:39,065 --> 00:07:40,649
But I just hoped you told me the truth.

129
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:43,403
And tell me what's going on because
I was clueless the whole time.

130
00:07:43,611 --> 00:07:44,779
You know our story.

131
00:07:45,572 --> 00:07:47,073
What else do you want me to say?

132
00:07:48,616 --> 00:07:49,951
Your rift with Kiko.

133
00:07:50,493 --> 00:07:51,813
What's the reason for your fight?

134
00:07:55,623 --> 00:07:57,000
I was the president then.

135
00:07:58,043 --> 00:08:01,171
Kiko and Mykel were the reason why
Section E was banned from the canteen.

136
00:08:01,629 --> 00:08:04,549
One day, Kiko bullied Kit and Eren.

137
00:08:05,133 --> 00:08:06,133
Then...

138
00:08:06,593 --> 00:08:08,178
I told Kiko to face me.

139
00:08:09,262 --> 00:08:10,262
And then?

140
00:08:10,722 --> 00:08:12,223
He didn't play fair.

141
00:08:13,266 --> 00:08:16,102
He arrived with backup,
and attacked me with a pipe.

142
00:08:17,812 --> 00:08:19,252
I can't remember what happened next.

143
00:08:19,689 --> 00:08:21,983
I just woke up in the hospital with Keifer.

144
00:08:23,234 --> 00:08:25,320
Is that why you don't
want Kiko to court me?

145
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:27,572
We really don't trust him, Jay.

146
00:08:28,907 --> 00:08:31,076
So that's why your
stricter than Angelo, huh?

147
00:08:35,163 --> 00:08:36,163
Thank you.

148
00:08:36,623 --> 00:08:37,623
For what?

149
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,376
Because you're all concerned for me.

150
00:08:40,794 --> 00:08:41,794
That's nothing.

151
00:08:43,755 --> 00:08:44,923
You're special to us, Jay.

152
00:08:50,595 --> 00:08:52,138
And yes, I'll admit to you.

153
00:08:53,515 --> 00:08:57,393
We planned on taking out Kiko
if ever he pursued you.

154
00:08:57,811 --> 00:09:00,688
I already turned him down.
Don't you guys worry.

155
00:09:01,147 --> 00:09:05,026
But… what if someone else
wants to court you?

156
00:09:06,319 --> 00:09:07,445
Will you accept?

157
00:09:08,238 --> 00:09:10,364
David, you already have a girlfriend.
Shame on you!

158
00:09:10,365 --> 00:09:11,407
It's not me.

159
00:09:11,574 --> 00:09:13,576
No one else's gonna court me.
You must be kidding.

160
00:09:14,661 --> 00:09:16,161
- You're not sure.
- Then who could it be?

161
00:09:16,162 --> 00:09:17,414
Keifer.

162
00:09:19,415 --> 00:09:20,625
Will you let him court you?

163
00:09:24,129 --> 00:09:25,129
Really?

164
00:09:25,338 --> 00:09:26,548
That's impossible.

165
00:09:26,923 --> 00:09:27,923
I'll get going.

166
00:09:28,883 --> 00:09:29,967
Calm down.

167
00:09:29,968 --> 00:09:33,012
He's not gonna court you.
Why am I panicking?

168
00:09:45,733 --> 00:09:46,818
Why are you late?

169
00:09:47,235 --> 00:09:48,695
What happened to your forehead?

170
00:09:50,864 --> 00:09:51,864
Ah…

171
00:09:52,615 --> 00:09:54,534
I bumped into a wall.

172
00:09:54,659 --> 00:09:57,704
And we had a group project.
That's why I was late.

173
00:10:00,999 --> 00:10:02,208
Did something happen?

174
00:10:03,042 --> 00:10:04,042
Mom just left.

175
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,252
She went to Guam.

176
00:10:05,253 --> 00:10:07,297
There's been a problem
with a business partner.

177
00:10:07,881 --> 00:10:09,681
Same goes for me.
I won't be home for a while.

178
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:12,343
It's just gonna be you and Aries at home.

179
00:10:12,719 --> 00:10:13,719
Behave!

180
00:10:15,597 --> 00:10:16,597
Yes, Angelo.

181
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:18,933
By the way, your bike's fixed.
You can use it now.

182
00:10:19,392 --> 00:10:20,392
Thanks a lot, Angelo.

183
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,560
Don't fight.

184
00:10:23,563 --> 00:10:24,563
Yes.

185
00:10:26,649 --> 00:10:28,026
[phone ringing]

186
00:10:28,985 --> 00:10:30,320
Oh. Where is that?

187
00:10:32,363 --> 00:10:32,989
Where is it?

188
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:34,949
My bag's all messed up
because of what happened.

189
00:10:37,118 --> 00:10:40,246
Because it's just gonna be the
two of us here, I will set some rules.

190
00:10:41,206 --> 00:10:43,499
You can't leave without
asking for permission.

191
00:10:44,334 --> 00:10:47,170
And you'll inform me about
who you're hanging out with.

192
00:10:49,464 --> 00:10:50,590
And you're not allowed to...

193
00:10:56,262 --> 00:10:57,262
I...

194
00:10:57,347 --> 00:10:59,098
Jasper Jean Mariano.

195
00:10:59,432 --> 00:11:00,432
That's not mine.

196
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,600
Who's the father?

197
00:11:01,768 --> 00:11:04,354
I'm not pregnant!
It's not mine! Believe me!

198
00:11:04,521 --> 00:11:05,939
Is it Yuri or Keifer?

199
00:11:17,116 --> 00:11:18,284
Pregnancy kit?

200
00:11:19,077 --> 00:11:20,662
Why is it here?

201
00:11:21,287 --> 00:11:22,287
And here's the thing...

202
00:11:22,622 --> 00:11:23,665
Two red lines.

203
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,041
Positive.

204
00:11:26,376 --> 00:11:27,877
Denzel's pregnant?!

205
00:11:29,337 --> 00:11:30,046
Oh!

206
00:11:30,047 --> 00:11:31,297
Of course not, right.

207
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,258
This could only mean...

208
00:11:33,675 --> 00:11:35,051
Denzel got someone pregnant!

209
00:11:36,219 --> 00:11:37,262
Answer me, Jay!

210
00:11:38,263 --> 00:11:40,306
I told you it's not mine!

211
00:11:41,099 --> 00:11:43,935
That's the answer of a pregnant
girl who won't admit to it!

212
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:45,144
[Jay-jay grunts in frustration]

213
00:11:45,145 --> 00:11:46,771
But it's the truth!

214
00:11:47,063 --> 00:11:48,355
Who's that child's father?!

215
00:11:48,356 --> 00:11:51,276
No one! Why won't you listen?!

216
00:11:51,484 --> 00:11:53,778
If that pregnancy kit's not yours,
then whose is it?

217
00:11:53,903 --> 00:11:55,029
It's my classmate's!

218
00:11:55,238 --> 00:11:57,282
Jay-jay, you don't have
a female classmate.

219
00:11:57,699 --> 00:11:59,742
It's my classmate's,
because he is the father.

220
00:11:59,867 --> 00:12:01,160
So, who's the father?!

221
00:12:01,661 --> 00:12:02,661
Is it Yuri or Keifer?!

222
00:12:03,579 --> 00:12:04,579
Ah, sir.

223
00:12:12,547 --> 00:12:14,299
You made them come here?!

224
00:12:18,136 --> 00:12:19,595
Who's the father of the child?!

225
00:12:20,263 --> 00:12:22,015
Angelo, I'm not pregnant!

226
00:12:22,557 --> 00:12:23,557
Just admit it.

227
00:12:23,891 --> 00:12:24,892
That was fast.

228
00:12:25,018 --> 00:12:26,311
We already made a baby?

229
00:12:27,562 --> 00:12:28,563
What did you say?

230
00:12:28,813 --> 00:12:29,813
Yeah.

231
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,566
Best day ever.

232
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:34,610
Asshole!

233
00:12:35,111 --> 00:12:37,905
Just bring me to the hospital
and this will all be over!

234
00:12:38,031 --> 00:12:39,239
Change your clothes!

235
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,908
Don't bring shame upon HVIS!

236
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:42,159
Go on!

237
00:12:47,332 --> 00:12:49,709
You and you, you're going with us.

238
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:02,262
You're gonna get married once you turn 18.

239
00:13:02,263 --> 00:13:03,263
Sure.

240
00:13:03,389 --> 00:13:04,724
I'm excited to see our baby.

241
00:13:05,975 --> 00:13:06,975
Asshole.

242
00:13:08,644 --> 00:13:10,521
Why won't they believe me?

243
00:13:11,272 --> 00:13:12,982
It even went this far!

244
00:13:14,692 --> 00:13:18,029
And this asshole probably have
a nut loose or something.

245
00:13:19,655 --> 00:13:22,450
And this one has been quiet all this time.
Didn't even back me up.

246
00:13:24,327 --> 00:13:25,620
I just want this to be over.

247
00:13:26,037 --> 00:13:27,621
I'll talk to your dad tomorrow.

248
00:13:27,622 --> 00:13:28,164
Sure.

249
00:13:28,164 --> 00:13:29,164
Whenever you want.

250
00:13:29,999 --> 00:13:31,334
When did you become a couple?

251
00:13:32,752 --> 00:13:34,003
Is that a requirement?

252
00:13:34,462 --> 00:13:35,755
We just got carried away.

253
00:13:36,255 --> 00:13:37,255
She was so good.

254
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:40,384
Ah! Mr. Fernandez.

255
00:13:40,385 --> 00:13:41,385
Hello.

256
00:13:43,471 --> 00:13:47,100
I have the lab results for...

257
00:13:47,558 --> 00:13:48,851
Jasper Jean Mariano.

258
00:13:53,106 --> 00:13:55,817
So, the test results came back negative.

259
00:14:01,239 --> 00:14:03,199
Which means, she's not pregnant.

260
00:14:13,334 --> 00:14:15,044
Do you have any questions?

261
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,381
I'm so sorry for making
this urgent request.

262
00:14:19,549 --> 00:14:20,549
Thank you for your help.

263
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,050
Alright.

264
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,300
You're welcome.

265
00:14:22,593 --> 00:14:24,261
If you need anything, I'll be outside.

266
00:14:24,262 --> 00:14:25,470
Thank you so much, Doc.

267
00:14:25,471 --> 00:14:26,471
You're welcome.

268
00:14:29,225 --> 00:14:31,602
[Keifer laughing]

269
00:14:32,186 --> 00:14:33,229
Your faces!

270
00:14:34,647 --> 00:14:36,399
I should've taken a video.

271
00:14:36,774 --> 00:14:38,443
Oh my God. That was funny.

272
00:14:40,314 --> 00:14:41,486
You think this is funny?

273
00:14:41,487 --> 00:14:42,822
Yeah. It's pretty funny.

274
00:14:47,493 --> 00:14:48,494
You need help.

275
00:14:49,036 --> 00:14:50,036
Okay.

276
00:14:50,538 --> 00:14:51,247
Gotcha.

277
00:14:51,456 --> 00:14:52,081
Thank you.

278
00:14:52,457 --> 00:14:53,958
[Keifer laughing]

279
00:14:57,128 --> 00:14:58,128
Jay.

280
00:14:58,212 --> 00:14:59,212
Jay!

281
00:15:01,841 --> 00:15:03,551
I'll apologize in behalf of Keifer.

282
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:04,886
I don't need your apology.

283
00:15:05,845 --> 00:15:08,848
Keifer's horrible. But his enablers
are just as bad as him!

284
00:15:11,142 --> 00:15:12,142
I'm sorry.

285
00:15:12,768 --> 00:15:14,812
Not for Keifer, but for me.

286
00:15:15,605 --> 00:15:17,190
I'm sorry because
I let it happen, Jay.

287
00:15:18,524 --> 00:15:20,818
[Keifer chuckling]

288
00:15:25,406 --> 00:15:26,406
Tss.

289
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,501
[Jay-jay punches Keifer]

290
00:15:36,793 --> 00:15:37,793
Jay-jay...

291
00:15:49,263 --> 00:15:50,765
Keifer really did that?

292
00:15:51,349 --> 00:15:52,349
Hmm.

293
00:15:52,433 --> 00:15:54,313
But where did you get
that pregnancy test, Jay?

294
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,524
I saw it outside.

295
00:16:00,525 --> 00:16:01,901
I got curious, so I picked it up.

296
00:16:03,277 --> 00:16:07,114
You really enjoy picking up
other people's trash, don't you?

297
00:16:08,282 --> 00:16:08,950
So what?

298
00:16:09,158 --> 00:16:11,744
If I hadn't kept Mica's letter,
you'd still be heartbroken now.

299
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:13,704
Tss.

300
00:16:14,038 --> 00:16:15,164
You're just a meddler.

301
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:16,790
That's true.

302
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:19,168
Huh? Did you guys
hear something?

303
00:16:19,627 --> 00:16:21,629
He said you're a meddler.

304
00:16:23,631 --> 00:16:24,715
Oh! Nothing.

305
00:16:25,174 --> 00:16:25,925
Who said that?

306
00:16:26,133 --> 00:16:27,133
Childish.

307
00:16:28,052 --> 00:16:29,052
Asshole!

308
00:16:31,556 --> 00:16:32,974
It was a prank!

309
00:16:33,224 --> 00:16:34,517
On my family?!

310
00:16:34,934 --> 00:16:36,310
Well, it wasn't funny.

311
00:16:41,774 --> 00:16:42,567
Guys.

312
00:16:42,692 --> 00:16:45,861
They said we need five representatives
for the assembly later.

313
00:16:46,988 --> 00:16:47,988
Yuri,

314
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:49,990
Rory,

315
00:16:50,449 --> 00:16:50,992
Edrix...

316
00:16:51,325 --> 00:16:52,325
Let's go!

317
00:16:52,368 --> 00:16:53,368
Fuck yeah!

318
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:55,078
And Jay-Jay.

319
00:16:55,413 --> 00:16:56,413
Come with us.

320
00:16:57,623 --> 00:16:59,250
Me? To the assembly?

321
00:16:59,792 --> 00:17:01,252
Yeah. Come on.

322
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:02,919
Let's go.

323
00:17:03,713 --> 00:17:04,713
What was that?

324
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:07,466
He's mad at me, but he wants me
at the assembly?

325
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,093
He's nuts.

326
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,261
Take care, take care.

327
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,307
You belong in Section E, right?

328
00:17:15,266 --> 00:17:16,266
Let's go.

329
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,560
Edrix.

330
00:17:24,692 --> 00:17:27,695
What's going on with the King of Assholes?

331
00:17:27,903 --> 00:17:29,779
Maybe he's trying to apologize?

332
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,742
Whatever! I'm still mad at him!

333
00:17:36,746 --> 00:17:37,622
Hi, Jay.

334
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:38,789
Eyes in front.

335
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,586
Is everyone here for the assembly?

336
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:46,505
Okay.

337
00:17:46,631 --> 00:17:47,631
Then, let's begin.

338
00:17:48,966 --> 00:17:50,176
Section A.

339
00:17:50,426 --> 00:17:52,011
Section A representative.

340
00:17:52,511 --> 00:17:53,888
Freya Hidalgo.

341
00:17:54,263 --> 00:17:58,225
Student Report: Zero suspensions,
no violations.

342
00:17:58,476 --> 00:18:01,979
Homeroom Report: Airconditioning unit,
needs replacement.

343
00:18:02,188 --> 00:18:06,567
And suggestions: a
brand-new room for Section A.

344
00:18:07,318 --> 00:18:08,318
Ain't that right?

345
00:18:09,904 --> 00:18:10,988
Section B?

346
00:18:11,906 --> 00:18:13,282
Section B representative.

347
00:18:13,532 --> 00:18:14,784
I'm Ashley Santarina.

348
00:18:15,284 --> 00:18:18,913
No suspensions, two violations.
And for suggestions:

349
00:18:19,372 --> 00:18:20,790
Deeper of our comfort.

350
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:22,791
Section C?

351
00:18:23,793 --> 00:18:27,296
Section C representative,
Rakki San Diego, myself.

352
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:31,133
Student report: One
suspension, no violations.

353
00:18:31,425 --> 00:18:34,470
Homeroom Report: Our
ceiling fan needs repair.

354
00:18:34,845 --> 00:18:37,390
As for the suggestions,
right now we have none.

355
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:38,890
Section D.

356
00:18:39,308 --> 00:18:40,518
Section D representative...

357
00:18:40,601 --> 00:18:44,605
Yuri, what does the school do with the
homeroom report and suggestions?

358
00:18:44,897 --> 00:18:46,439
They prioritize the homeroom report.

359
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,651
They ignore the
suggestions most of the time.

360
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,613
Section E representative,
Mark Keifer Watson.

361
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,741
Four suspensions, two violations.

362
00:18:56,117 --> 00:18:57,785
Homeroom report: None.

363
00:18:59,203 --> 00:19:00,788
Suggestions: None.

364
00:19:01,747 --> 00:19:02,747
Hey.

365
00:19:02,832 --> 00:19:03,457
What?

366
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:06,669
Why didn't you mention the girl's
restroom of our building?

367
00:19:07,003 --> 00:19:08,337
They don't care about us.

368

00:28:21,014 --> 00:28:22,014
Not happening.

551
00:28:22,266 --> 00:28:23,626
Why are you only taking David out?

552
00:28:24,434 --> 00:28:25,434
You've changed, Jay.

553
00:28:28,146 --> 00:28:29,398
Alright, fine.

554
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:32,900
Yes!

555
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:34,653
Then it's settled.

556
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,070
It's a triple date.

557
00:28:36,446 --> 00:28:37,781
Good thing too. I know a place.

558
00:28:38,031 --> 00:28:39,031
Leave it to me.

559
00:28:58,176 --> 00:29:02,180
[Jay-jay and Ci-N happily screaming]

560
00:29:06,977 --> 00:29:08,937
Ouch, Jay. That hurts.

561
00:29:09,229 --> 00:29:12,190
[Jay-jay and Ci-N happily screaming]

562
00:29:26,163 --> 00:29:26,955
One more time!

563
00:29:27,122 --> 00:29:28,415
- I can't do it anymore!
- More!

564
00:29:30,375 --> 00:29:31,835
[Ci-N cheering]

565
00:29:33,628 --> 00:29:35,047
The things you do to me.

566
00:29:35,297 --> 00:29:36,048
Did you enjoy it?

567
00:29:36,131 --> 00:29:37,341
I'm dizzy.

568
00:29:37,632 --> 00:29:38,467
Wanna ride one more time?

569
00:29:38,467 --> 00:29:39,467
I don't want to!

570
00:29:39,718 --> 00:29:42,387
Sir! Jay-jay said she wants to ride again.

571
00:29:45,724 --> 00:29:48,100
What else do you want?
Let's ride one more time.

572
00:29:48,101 --> 00:29:48,769
Over there.

573
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:50,103
My head's spinning here.

574
00:29:51,063 --> 00:29:52,606
Jay, let's go over there.

575
00:29:53,774 --> 00:29:55,734
- One more! One more, Jay!
- No more!

576
00:29:56,026 --> 00:29:57,235
Come on. Let's ride again.

577
00:29:57,361 --> 00:29:58,403
Let's take a break.

578
00:29:59,404 --> 00:30:00,404
You're weak, huh?

579
00:30:01,031 --> 00:30:03,116
Alright. I'll get some food.

580
00:30:04,785 --> 00:30:05,952
Where is David, by the way?

581
00:30:06,661 --> 00:30:07,661
Jay!

582
00:30:10,248 --> 00:30:11,248
Water?

583
00:30:11,875 --> 00:30:12,875
Here.

584
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,760
I said I wanted to talk.

585
00:30:22,135 --> 00:30:24,471
Didn't know that you would bring
me to an amusement park.

586
00:30:24,763 --> 00:30:26,973
I have extra tickets.
Can't let it go to waste.

587
00:30:27,641 --> 00:30:28,641
Oh.

588
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:33,313
What do you want to talk about?

589
00:30:38,902 --> 00:30:39,902
David...

590
00:30:40,695 --> 00:30:43,015
what if you got your girlfriend
pregnant? What will you do?

591
00:30:43,156 --> 00:30:44,491
I'll take full responsibility.

592
00:30:45,075 --> 00:30:46,075
Of course.

593
00:30:47,828 --> 00:30:48,829
Why do you ask?

594
00:30:50,622 --> 00:30:51,665
The thing is...

595
00:30:53,667 --> 00:30:55,292
Just don't say that you heard it from me.

596
00:30:55,293 --> 00:30:59,881
But when you do talk to him,
it didn't come from me...

597
00:31:01,675 --> 00:31:02,967
How should I put this?

598
00:31:02,968 --> 00:31:04,385
The truth is...

599
00:31:04,386 --> 00:31:05,386
You know...

600
00:31:05,429 --> 00:31:06,221
It's...

601
00:31:06,222 --> 00:31:07,264
It's Denzel.

602
00:31:08,223 --> 00:31:09,932
He doesn't want to take
responsibility for Grace.

603
00:31:09,933 --> 00:31:10,933
You know already?

604
00:31:11,435 --> 00:31:12,811
I heard them fighting.

605
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,231
Oh my goodness.
I thought I was the only one who knew.

606
00:31:16,356 --> 00:31:17,356
Good thing you know.

607
00:31:17,691 --> 00:31:20,110
I told you. I heard them fighting.

608
00:31:22,195 --> 00:31:25,449
Can you talk to him?
Grace is in a tough spot.

609
00:31:27,492 --> 00:31:28,827
Denzel has his reasons.

610
00:31:29,411 --> 00:31:31,037
He's not that type of person.

611
00:31:31,538 --> 00:31:33,178
That's why I'm asking you to talk to him.

612
00:31:33,874 --> 00:31:36,626
Maybe it's better if it's you.
'Cause you're a man.

613
00:31:38,795 --> 00:31:41,089
Alright. I'll talk to him.

614
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,635
But I can't make any promises
that he will change his mind. Okay?

615
00:31:47,095 --> 00:31:51,099
If you can't, maybe Yuri can
convince him. Or Keifer.

616
00:31:51,308 --> 00:31:52,767
Or anyone that's close to him.

617
00:31:55,395 --> 00:31:56,646
Wanna do it now?

618
00:31:57,272 --> 00:31:57,772
Huh?

619
00:31:57,773 --> 00:31:59,023
They're here anyway.

620
00:31:59,024 --> 00:32:00,024
Who's they?

621
00:32:00,275 --> 00:32:01,443
Our classmates.

622
00:32:03,945 --> 00:32:05,989
Really? I don't see them.

623
00:32:08,116 --> 00:32:09,618
Want them to come out?

624
00:32:11,411 --> 00:32:12,411
Close your eyes.

625
00:32:15,123 --> 00:32:16,458
Close your eyes.

626
00:32:16,541 --> 00:32:18,811
I know we're in an amusement park.
But what is this, magic?

627
00:32:18,835 --> 00:32:19,835
Appear, disappear?

628
00:32:20,587 --> 00:32:21,587
Close your eyes.

629
00:32:31,389 --> 00:32:32,516
What's taking so long?

630
00:32:35,101 --> 00:32:36,311
What are you doing?!

631
00:32:38,647 --> 00:32:39,647
Hey.

632
00:32:45,362 --> 00:32:45,987
Hoy!

633
00:32:45,988 --> 00:32:47,905
Hey! Asshole! Don't you have a girlfriend?!

634
00:32:47,906 --> 00:32:48,949
Are you insane?

635
00:32:50,367 --> 00:32:51,952
Are you out of your mind?

636
00:32:52,744 --> 00:32:53,744
Maybe.

637
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:55,080
Maybe your face.

638
00:32:55,288 --> 00:32:57,123
This popcorn's really good.

639

Hey. You're all here.

640
00:33:01,294 --> 00:33:01,962
What's up?

641
00:33:01,962 --> 00:33:03,082
You really prioritized that?

642
00:33:03,213 --> 00:33:04,798
Why did you leave them unsupervised?

643
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:08,218
What are you guys doing here?
Are you following us?

644
00:33:08,843 --> 00:33:11,804
You're too much.
You asked them on a date without us.

645
00:33:11,805 --> 00:33:14,015
That's right. You know that's so uncool.

646
00:33:14,266 --> 00:33:16,851
Should we be side chicks first
before we can hang out with you?

647
00:33:17,352 --> 00:33:18,394
That's it?

648
00:33:18,395 --> 00:33:21,106
And to make sure this asshole
won't do anything stupid!

649
00:33:21,314 --> 00:33:22,940
What? I didn't do anything.

650
00:33:22,941 --> 00:33:24,233
You almost kissed her!

Why are you getting angry?

to shit your pants.

- Sorry.
- Hey, be careful. I don't want to die yet.

917
00:46:02,116 --> 00:46:03,116
Let's take a picture.

918
00:46:03,784 --> 00:46:04,827
- Picture?
- Yeah.

919
00:46:04,994 --> 00:46:07,755
- Just look at it, Jay. I swear, you'd like it.
- Alright, let me see.

920
00:46:09,498 --> 00:46:11,018
All right, guys. I'm taking the photo.

921
00:46:12,418 --> 00:46:14,587
3, 2, 1. Smile!

922
00:46:16,672 --> 00:46:17,506
One more time.

923
00:46:17,632 --> 00:46:19,592
3, 2, 1. Smile!

924
00:46:25,765 --> 00:46:27,600
- Let's do one standing!
- Standing?

925
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:31,979
[screams]

926
00:46:32,813 --> 00:46:33,813
What happened?!

927
00:46:40,905 --> 00:46:43,074
You're being too rowdy!
This is your fault!

928
00:46:43,282 --> 00:46:45,409
Wow. Am I that strong?

929
00:46:49,121 --> 00:46:50,205
Oh no...

930
00:46:50,206 --> 00:46:52,208
can't you check what's happening below?

931
00:46:52,375 --> 00:46:54,001
Now's the time to use your energy.

932
00:47:02,593 --> 00:47:03,469
What happened?

933
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:05,012
Mechanical failure, Sir.

934
00:47:05,346 --> 00:47:06,514
So, we're stuck here?

935
00:47:06,806 --> 00:47:07,806
Yes, sir.

936
00:47:11,185 --> 00:47:12,269
Fix it now.

937
00:47:12,395 --> 00:47:13,437
Right away, Sir.

938
00:47:14,522 --> 00:47:15,689
Technical issues?

939
00:47:17,024 --> 00:47:17,691
Yeah.

940
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:20,277
How long are we gonna be here?

941
00:47:21,779 --> 00:47:22,779
Who knows?

942
00:47:25,491 --> 00:47:27,618
[phone ringing]

943
00:47:27,785 --> 00:47:29,120
My cellphone! My cellphone!

944
00:47:32,039 --> 00:47:33,124
Hello, Aries.

945
00:47:33,666 --> 00:47:34,708
Where the hell are you?

946
00:47:35,042 --> 00:47:36,645
Why aren't you home yet?
You're making Angelo worried again.

947
00:47:36,669 --> 00:47:38,295
You're making Angelo worried again.

948
00:47:38,546 --> 00:47:39,546
Umm...

949
00:47:39,755 --> 00:47:40,995
I'm here at the amusement park.

950
00:47:41,382 --> 00:47:43,676
Great. Where is that?

951
00:47:44,093 --> 00:47:47,388
- Is that the one near our house?
- Oh, Jay. That tickles.

952
00:47:48,389 --> 00:47:50,223
Is that Keifer?!
Where are you, really?!

953
00:47:50,224 --> 00:47:52,393
- Oh, Jay...
- I'm in the Ferris Wheel!

954
00:47:52,768 --> 00:47:53,310
Hey...

955
00:47:53,477 --> 00:47:55,104
Can you call later?

956
00:47:55,271 --> 00:47:56,272
You're disturbing us!

957
00:47:56,981 --> 00:47:57,982
[Keifer groans]

958
00:47:58,315 --> 00:48:00,150
Don't stop... Oh, you...

959
00:48:00,151 --> 00:48:01,944
- You like it rough?
- Give me that!

960
00:48:02,069 --> 00:48:03,422
- Don't stop.
- Stop.

961
00:48:03,446 --> 00:48:04,488
Give me my phone.

962
00:48:04,613 --> 00:48:07,032
- [Keifer groans]
- Give it to me!

963
00:48:07,366 --> 00:48:08,409
Answer me.

964
00:48:08,742 --> 00:48:10,422
- Who's that?
- Don't stop... Don't stop...

965
00:48:10,453 --> 00:48:12,663
I'll come and get you.

966
00:48:14,123 --> 00:48:15,124
You're such an asshole.

967
00:48:15,875 --> 00:48:19,044
[Keifer laughing]

968
00:48:19,962 --> 00:48:23,132
[Keifer and Ci-N laughing]

969
00:48:27,011 --> 00:48:28,053
Was that funny?

970
00:48:29,722 --> 00:48:30,389
[David laughing]

971
00:48:30,390 --> 00:48:32,099
[boys having fun]

972
00:48:39,106 --> 00:48:40,106
Stop!

973
00:48:40,316 --> 00:48:41,567
We need to get unstuck!

974
00:48:42,651 --> 00:48:46,197
This is the new ride they're building.

975
00:48:46,363 --> 00:48:48,532
Go get it, Calix, so you can
bring it home to Mica.

976
00:48:48,657 --> 00:48:50,817
- This one looks like Mykel.
- That's your mom, stupid.

977
00:48:53,329 --> 00:48:54,830
See? You didn't shoot anything.

978
00:48:55,247 --> 00:48:56,749
Party! Party!
[cheering]

979
00:48:59,668 --> 00:49:02,379
I'm scared of the Carousel.
Mica, I love you.

980
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:04,047
- I have a question for you.
- Yeah?

981
00:49:04,048 --> 00:49:06,759
Is this how it feels like
whenever you spin Mica's head?

982
00:49:07,718 --> 00:49:09,010
Are you happy about that, huh?

983
00:49:09,011 --> 00:49:10,011
[laughing]

984
00:49:11,138 --> 00:49:12,306
Giddy up. Giddy up.

985
00:49:12,473 --> 00:49:13,516
Wooh!

986
00:49:15,309 --> 00:49:16,685
Mama!

987
00:49:16,977 --> 00:49:17,686
[boys screaming]

988
00:49:17,687 --> 00:49:18,771
You son of a bitch!

989
00:49:18,938 --> 00:49:20,397
My poop's coming out!

990
00:49:20,814 --> 00:49:23,150
So this is how it feels to fall!

991
00:49:23,526 --> 00:49:24,651
For you.

992
00:49:24,652 --> 00:49:26,195
[screaming]

993
00:49:26,612 --> 00:49:28,947
- I wanna get off!
- You son of a bitch!

994
00:49:28,948 --> 00:49:30,366
[screaming]

995
00:49:33,702 --> 00:49:36,872
76, 77...

996
00:49:38,457 --> 00:49:39,457
78...

997
00:49:41,544 --> 00:49:42,962
79...

998
00:49:44,421 --> 00:49:46,172
There's fireworks!

999
00:49:46,173 --> 00:49:47,258
So cool.

1000
00:49:48,968 --> 00:49:49,969
Amazing.

1001
00:49:50,553 --> 00:49:52,930
Look at it! So pretty.

1002
00:49:54,348 --> 00:49:55,391
Yeah, so pretty indeed.

1003
00:49:59,395 --> 00:50:00,395
Cliché

1004
00:50:05,693 --> 00:50:07,152
What a pretty sight.

1005
00:50:10,322 --> 00:50:11,615
So cool!

1006
00:50:12,199 --> 00:50:13,909
Did you see that?

1007
00:50:20,916 --> 00:50:23,294
Hey. We're moving again.

1008
00:50:24,044 --> 00:50:25,129
Shit!

1009
00:50:26,922 --> 00:50:28,340
Don't you want to go down?

1010
00:50:28,591 --> 00:50:30,341
I wasn't able to take a
video of the fireworks!

1011
00:50:30,342 --> 00:50:31,342
Because of you.

1012
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:36,220
- Give that to me!
- Uh-uh.

1013
00:50:37,683 --> 00:50:38,809
- Give it to me.
- No.

1014
00:50:39,059 --> 00:50:40,311
I told you to give it back!

1015
00:50:40,936 --> 00:50:42,145
What if I fall off?

1016
00:50:42,146 --> 00:50:43,606
Now you're scared of falling.

1017
00:50:44,189 --> 00:50:45,441
Last time, you jumped, right?

1018
00:50:46,025 --> 00:50:48,736
Hello? This is too high. I could die.

1019
00:50:48,902 --> 00:50:49,902
Don't worry.

1020
00:50:50,613 --> 00:50:52,031
I'll catch you again if you fall.

1021
00:50:52,823 --> 00:50:53,824
So cliché.

1022
00:50:56,619 --> 00:50:57,494
- Give it to me.
- No.

1023
00:50:57,495 --> 00:50:59,705
I'm getting really pissed.
I said, give it back.

1024
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,206
- Give it here!
- No.

1025
00:51:01,415 --> 00:51:02,249
Give it to me!

1026
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:03,584
[Jay-jay screams]

1027
00:51:04,585 --> 00:51:05,585
[Ci-N laughs]

1028
00:51:07,004 --> 00:51:08,004
See?

1029
00:51:08,255 --> 00:51:10,049
I told you I'll still catch you.

1030
00:51:14,094 --> 00:51:15,094
Get off.

1031
00:51:15,721 --> 00:51:16,721
Stop.

1032
00:51:18,015 --> 00:51:19,350
Yuri, will you help me?

1033
00:51:20,059 --> 00:51:21,059
This guy...

1034
00:51:21,393 --> 00:51:22,144
Keifer!

1035
00:51:22,311 --> 00:51:23,937
- Jay...
- Don't! Don't!

1036
00:51:24,271 --> 00:51:24,772
Don't!

1037
00:51:25,022 --> 00:51:26,273
- Help me.
- Do not.

1038
00:51:26,357 --> 00:51:27,357
- Don't.
- Please.

1039
00:51:27,691 --> 00:51:28,233
Don't!

1040
00:51:28,525 --> 00:51:29,525
[Jay-jay grunts]

1041
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,547
What the hell is wrong with you?!

1042
00:51:32,571 --> 00:51:32,946
Come here.

1043
00:51:33,072 --> 00:51:34,198
[screaming]

1044
00:51:34,281 --> 00:51:35,281
[Ci-N laughs]

1045
00:51:35,699 --> 00:51:37,493
Ouch! You're so heavy!

1046
00:51:38,994 --> 00:51:40,411
What the hell?!

1047
00:51:40,412 --> 00:51:42,790
Ouch, Yuri. I said help me!

1048
00:51:43,707 --> 00:51:45,041
What's with the face?

1049
00:51:45,042 --> 00:51:46,709
Ouch! My feet, Jay!

1050
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:48,504
Why are you laughing?!
Come and help me!

1051
00:51:49,254 --> 00:51:49,755
What the...

1052
00:51:49,756 --> 00:51:50,838
Ouch...

1053
00:51:50,839 --> 00:51:52,508
Jasper Jean Mariano!

1054
00:51:53,258 --> 00:51:54,258
Get off!

1055
00:51:56,136 --> 00:51:57,136
It's your fault!

1056
00:52:09,233 --> 00:52:11,068
I'll tell Angelo to ground you!

1057
00:52:11,819 --> 00:52:14,071
Hey! I'm still talking to you.
Where are you going?

1058
00:52:14,154 --> 00:52:15,154
Upstairs!

1059
00:52:15,656 --> 00:52:18,158
Stop hanging out with that Keifer!

1060
00:52:18,325 --> 00:52:19,827
He'll just pull you down with him!

1061
00:52:19,993 --> 00:52:22,996
It was just a coincidence.
I was really with Ci-N and David.

1062
00:52:23,163 --> 00:52:26,166
No matter who it is, you're not gonna
hang out with anyone from Section E.

1063
00:52:26,625 --> 00:52:28,584
You too much. You're acting
stricter than Angelo.

1064
00:52:28,585 --> 00:52:29,585
I'll tell on you.

1065
00:52:30,003 --> 00:52:31,088
I said I'm sorry.

1066
00:52:31,463 --> 00:52:33,343
Maybe you already have
feelings for that Keifer.

1067
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:42,641
I won't let go.

1068
00:52:46,228 --> 00:52:47,228
Jay!

1069
00:52:57,072 --> 00:52:58,365
[Jay-jay screams]

1070
00:52:58,824 --> 00:53:00,409
I told you I'll still catch you.

1071
00:53:02,202 --> 00:53:03,203
Why can't you answer?

1072
00:53:03,662 --> 00:53:05,873
Did you really catch feelings for Keifer?

1073
00:53:06,457 --> 00:53:08,208
Are you crazy? I don't even like him!

1074
00:53:08,834 --> 00:53:09,834
Jay-jay!

1075
00:53:38,781 --> 00:53:43,535
I didn't expect that Denzel would
be living in a place like this.

1076
00:53:44,495 --> 00:53:45,495
David!

1077
00:53:45,954 --> 00:53:47,247
Thanks for taking me here.

1078
00:53:47,456 --> 00:53:48,456
Sure.

1079
00:53:48,582 --> 00:53:51,782
I already told the others, so we can come
up with a solution to Denzel's problem.

1080
00:53:52,461 --> 00:53:54,797
I just don't know if they
can make it this early.

1081
00:53:57,549 --> 00:53:58,549
Excuse me?

1082
00:53:59,468 --> 00:54:01,135
- Oh. It's you.
- Is Denzel here?

1083
00:54:01,136 --> 00:54:02,136
He's inside.

1084
00:54:02,554 --> 00:54:03,554
Wait, I'll just call him.

1085
00:54:03,639 --> 00:54:04,639
Thank you.

1086
00:54:08,143 --> 00:54:09,686
Denzel, someone's looking for you.

1087
00:54:20,739 --> 00:54:21,782
Why are you here?

1088
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:27,996
Jay-jay needs to talk to you.

1089
00:54:31,208 --> 00:54:32,209
Go. Talk to him.

1090
00:54:35,379 --> 00:54:36,630
[Jay-jay smiles awkwardly]

1091
00:54:38,298 --> 00:54:41,552
I understand if you would
judge me after hearing the truth.

1092
00:54:44,972 --> 00:54:46,390
I just used Grace.

1093
00:54:48,851 --> 00:54:50,644
You see our place, right?

1094
00:54:54,189 --> 00:54:55,482
How did you use her?

1095
00:54:56,650 --> 00:54:58,861
My mom works at their house.

1096
00:54:59,611 --> 00:55:01,738
She lives with her aunt and they're rich.

1097
00:55:02,531 --> 00:55:04,658
I'm envious of rich people, that's why...

1098
00:55:05,075 --> 00:55:07,911
I told myself I'll do anything
to be like them.

1099
00:55:10,372 --> 00:55:11,999
And you used Grace as a tool?

1100
00:55:12,457 --> 00:55:13,457
I befriended her.

1101
00:55:15,168 --> 00:55:18,505
I tried being playful with her, even
though she was always snarky towards me.

1102
00:55:19,756 --> 00:55:21,508
Until she got comfortable with me.

1103
00:55:23,093 --> 00:55:25,596
I tricked her into getting
me enrolled at HVIS.

1104
00:55:26,179 --> 00:55:28,390
When I got into the school,

1105
00:55:29,808 --> 00:55:31,143
I started ignoring Grace.

1106
00:55:33,687 --> 00:55:34,730
I felt guilty.

1107
00:55:36,899 --> 00:55:38,275
She kept talking to me.

1108
00:55:38,901 --> 00:55:40,986
Kept giving me nice things.

1109
00:55:41,403 --> 00:55:43,572
Cellphone. Shoes.

1110
00:55:45,157 --> 00:55:47,618
I thought she'll get tired of me
that's why I just let her be.

1111
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:50,245
I'm reaping all the benefits after all.

1112
00:55:52,497 --> 00:55:55,417
We became a couple, but kept it secret.

1113
00:55:57,502 --> 00:55:59,755
I tried breaking up with her but...

1114
00:56:01,632 --> 00:56:02,716
I can't do it.

1115
00:56:03,508 --> 00:56:04,508
Because...

1116
00:56:06,553 --> 00:56:07,553
Because...

1117
00:56:08,096 --> 00:56:09,306
Because you finally loved her?

1118
00:56:16,605 --> 00:56:18,357
I'm afraid of losing her.

1119
00:56:24,237 --> 00:56:26,657
She won't forgive me
once she finds out the truth.

1120
00:56:31,078 --> 00:56:33,705
I will do anything to
take responsibility, but...

1121
00:56:34,164 --> 00:56:35,164
But Grace?

1122
00:56:40,963 --> 00:56:41,963
Grace?

1123
00:56:47,844 --> 00:56:49,721
I understand Grace's feelings.

1124
00:56:50,472 --> 00:56:54,142
It hurts so much more when the words...

1125
00:56:54,601 --> 00:56:56,478
are uttered by the person you love.

1126
00:57:02,526 --> 00:57:04,194
You're a liar.

1127
00:57:22,921 --> 00:57:24,089
Grace!

1128
00:57:24,381 --> 00:57:25,549
Grace!

1129
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,451
- Grace!
- Grace!

1130
00:58:34,576 --> 00:58:35,868
Please, let's talk about this!

1131
00:58:35,869 --> 00:58:37,370
Don't come near me!

1132
00:58:37,537 --> 00:58:39,538
I will jump if you come near me.

1133
00:58:39,539 --> 00:58:41,165
I know you're used to hurting others.

1134
00:58:41,166 --> 00:58:43,710
But even the ones you love,
you wanna hurt?

1135
00:58:44,294 --> 00:58:46,880
They killed him, Jay. He died!

1136
00:58:47,130 --> 00:58:49,216
All of you wants to save Grace!

1137
00:58:49,299 --> 00:58:51,551
But how about my brother? Huh?

1138
00:58:51,718 --> 00:58:53,637
No one dared to save him!

1139
00:58:53,845 --> 00:58:55,679
You really went out of your
way to come here, huh?

1140
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:58,307
Talk to me. Okay, you're mad at Aries.

1141
00:58:58,308 --> 00:59:00,602
But why do you have to
get mad at me too?

1142
00:59:00,769 --> 00:59:03,422
Could you stop meddling
in other people's lives?

1143
00:59:03,447 --> 00:59:05,366
Keifer! Keifer!

1144
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,983
What the hell are you shouting about?

1145
00:59:07,275 --> 00:59:09,193
- It's Jay-jay!
- What happened to Jay-jay?

1146
00:59:09,194 --> 00:59:11,613
It's Ram. I didn't see them, but I'm sure!

1147
00:59:11,696 --> 00:59:13,240
Jay!

1148
00:59:13,448 --> 00:59:14,616
Hi, boys!

1149
00:59:15,075 --> 00:59:17,494
What? Missed me?

1150
00:59:17,953 --> 00:59:19,079
Where is Jay-jay?!

1151
00:59:19,412 --> 00:59:20,956
Ram called Kiko!

1152
00:59:21,123 --> 00:59:23,332
I'm sure she got caught up
in your troubles again!

1153
00:59:23,333 --> 00:59:25,961
I'm gonna fuck them up
if they touch her! I swear!

1154
00:59:26,128 --> 00:59:27,878
Wait, let me ask you first.

1155
00:59:27,879 --> 00:59:29,131
Do you like Jay-jay?

1156
00:59:29,548 --> 00:59:30,882
I think I'm falling for her.
