1
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:21,062
Jay!

2
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:22,665
We fetched you,
but then you ditched us?

3
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,149
I'm sorry. I got too excited.

4
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:25,232
Having fun without me?

5
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,475
You're making fun of me again.

6
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:27,606
I'll win this game for you.

7
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:29,611
You're a sore loser.

8
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:31,114
He thought about it...

9
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:32,407
passed it to Collins.

10
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:35,577
Three, two— Collins for the win!

11
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,246
Yeah! What a shot!

12
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,915
If you're interested,
maybe you'd like to join us.

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,751
We're celebrating our victory.

14
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,377
- Yeah, I can go.
- Yes!

15
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:47,589
Okay, let's give it up for Jay's Warriors!

16
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,720
He's so handsome, Keif...

17
00:00:54,053 --> 00:00:55,053
I mean, all of them.

18
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:55,805
What's that?

19
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,014
We played your song.

20
00:00:57,056 --> 00:00:58,176
Aren't you gonna say thanks?

21
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,810
Who's that unlucky guy
you're having feelings for?

22
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:03,313
You see how that Keifer treats me.

23
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,482
What did I really do to Cyrus?

24
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:09,027
You beat him up, Jay-jay.
He was unconscious for months!

25
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,945
What could be more important than us?!

26
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:11,863
Me!

27
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:14,157
Just like you, I have my own problems!

28
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:15,593
Jay-jay, I have a secret too.

29
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,702
You're the coolest girl I've ever known.

30
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,394
My head hurts.

31
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:46,523
Even my skull is throbbing.

32
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,378
When did my room get bigger?

33
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,797
Shit! Did I sleep in a different house?

34
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,050
Fuck!

35
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,095
Wait… it was Kiko!

36
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:27,021
Why is my shirt inside out?

37
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:41,369
I'm not getting senile,
am I? I'm not yet 70.

38
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,707
But why can't I remember anything?

39
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,289
I'll win the battle of the bands.

40
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:07,228
I remember going to the
victory party with Felix.

41
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,857
The basketball team's victory party.

42
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,151
What the hell happened then?

43
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,987
I remember there were a lot of people.

44
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:19,365
But something's not right.

45
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,998
There's something else
that escapes my memory.

46
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,579
Something important
happened before the party.

47
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,177
Did that really happen?

48
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,930
Maybe it's just a false memory.

49
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,347
False feelings?

50
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,058
I don't know.

51
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,025
Yuri.

52
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,037
Did that also happen?

53
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,413
Or was it a dream?

54
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:10,583
Oh, shit! Now what?!

55
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,172
Yuri.

56
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,594
Hey, Jay. Are you okay?

57
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:25,515
Isn't this place too wild?

58
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:28,184
The people are weird.

59
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:30,143
Yeah, I agree.

60
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,356
Maybe we should go in a bit later?

61
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,066
I'm a bit uncomfortable.

62
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,613
Oh. By the way…

63
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,481
Where did you learn the piano?

64
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,117
Oh.

65
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,621
My stepbrother Percy taught me.

66
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:52,260
- Sorry.
- No worries. It's okay.

67
00:04:52,587 --> 00:04:54,267
Actually, I really look up to him a lot.

68
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,307
Everything he knew, I wanted to learn too.

69
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,715
That's why I studied piano.

70
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,408
The two of you are probably close.

71
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:02,551
Super.

72
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:07,306
Then when we went to school,
he introduced me as his real brother.

73
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,601
He didn't like seeing me get bullied.

74
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,440
He's also the one who introduced me
to Keifer and everyone else.

75
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:21,112
They are close even though
they are not siblings by blood.

76
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,740
I suddenly remember my own brother.

77
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:27,443
What could his life be with his new family?

78
00:05:28,197 --> 00:05:30,872
Does he have stepsiblings too?

79
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,649
Does he know that he has a sister
from his biological family?

80
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,591
But as time went on…

81
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:45,887
He hung out with Keifer more than me.

82
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:48,764
And then...

83
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,308
the accident happened.

84
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:54,896
You know what, let's not attend that party.

85
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:57,523
I was just a substitute anyway.

86
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:00,735
What do you mean? You're the
reason the team won!

87
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,445
Every time, yeah yeah yeah.

88
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,990
Same address, 448 King Street.

89
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,204
Felix!

90
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,122
What's good, man?

91
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:15,403
I'm glad you guys could make it.

92
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,586
Smells bad. Like alcohol left for days.

93
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,170
Let's go.

94
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,047
Get him a beer.

95
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,130
Bro, come on.

96
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,550
Ouch, hold on!

97
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:29,055
And look, there's a pool and then a bar.

98
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,639
Sick, right?

99
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:31,681
You got a pool.

100
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,768
We got music, bro.

101
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:35,436
The team is here.

102
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,730
Man, enjoy yourself, bro.

103
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:39,107
We got girls.

104
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,525
Let's get you a drink, brother.

105
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:42,568
And let's party all night.

106
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,319
Felix!

107
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:46,029
Felix!

108
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,239
What's up, man?

109
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:48,783
So happy to see you, bro.

110
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:49,783
Go get some drinks there.

111
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:50,660
What's good?

112
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,912
Hey! Come and dance.

113
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,169
What are you doing?
Just dance. Move like this.

114
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:04,340
Jay, stop that. You look like an idiot!

115
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:05,967
What do you mean? Let's go!

116
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:08,260
Guys, guys, guys, guys.

117
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,262
Wait, wait, wait.

118
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:13,266
First of all, thank you
to everyone who came.

119
00:07:13,446 --> 00:07:17,520
And of course, thanks for all
your cheers during the game.

120
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:26,528
And so we promise to bring home the gold
year after year and…

121
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:27,421
After year.

122
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:28,822
Thank you so much.

123
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:32,118
That was so fucking boring.

124
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:37,448
But we're here to celebrate
and welcome Felix Collins!

125
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:39,708
The one who led the
Shark Slayers into victory!

126
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,044
Let's fucking party!

127
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:47,592
Felix! Felix! Felix!

128
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,011
Felix! Felix! Felix!

129
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,136
Hey!

130
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:52,762
Watch it!

131
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:59,353
[crowd chanting "Felix"]

132
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:04,233
[cheering continues]

133
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,651
Yeaaahhh!

134
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,029
He already has a fandom!

135
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:09,655
That's my friend!

136
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,575
Felix!

137
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:14,993
I'm getting hungry.

138
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,385
There's really nothing but alcohol here?

139
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,875
[crowd cheering]

140
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,882
Great, no food! Just everyone
gobbling each other up!

141
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:30,634
Oh!

142
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,429
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

143
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:34,013
Yeah,

144
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:36,307
go ahead. I'll just have some, okay?

145
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:38,619
- Alright.
- Thanks. Just enjoy.

146
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:39,894
- Enjoy.
- Jay-jay!

147
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,065
Mica!

148
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:46,901
- Mica?
- Shhh.

149
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:48,069
Who are you with? Where's…

150
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,445
[in Spanish] Hello, my friend.

151
00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:52,406
How are you? Thank you.
One, two, three, four, five.

152
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,158
- Calix?
- Oh?

153
00:08:54,602 --> 00:08:56,479
What the hell are you saying?
Why are you dressed like that?

154
00:08:56,504 --> 00:08:57,944
- That's all I know.
- How about you?

155
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,884
What are you doing here? Who are you with?

156
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,167
Oh, I'm with Felix. But we got separated.

157
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,919
Do Keifer and Yuri know that you're here?

158
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:05,753
No.

159
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,254
How about you? Why are
you here dressed like that?

160
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:11,514
He doesn't want me to go without him.

161
00:09:11,953 --> 00:09:13,844
But you know he's not allowed here because…

162
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,345
he's Section E.

163
00:09:15,496 --> 00:09:17,540
Oh, so Section E is prohibited here.

164
00:09:17,967 --> 00:09:20,226
That's why Felix doesn't
want the others to know.

165
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,329
You know what? Let's just get out of here.

166
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:25,233
If Keifer finds out we're here,
the three of us are gonna get in trouble.

167
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,636
Then call Felix. Go on. Quickly.

168
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,694
Nah, maybe later. Let him be for now.

169
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,396
Let him enjoy the moment.
He just got back to the team.

170
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,738
30 minutes.

171
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,716
Then after that, we'll get out of here.

172
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:36,890
Deal, 30 minutes.

173
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,244
Where's the toilet, by the way?

174
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:39,578
Outside. Just be quick, okay?

175
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,619
Alright, hold this for me.

176
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,540
30 minutes. Do everything you
want within that time.

177
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,042
Fine. Move away from here.

178
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,007
What's taking so long?

179
00:09:53,592 --> 00:09:54,593
Just be calm.

180
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,012
Hi, miss.

181
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:58,681
Let go of me.

182
00:09:58,764 --> 00:09:59,223
Come on.

183
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:00,724
- I said let me go!
- Hey!

184
00:10:01,662 --> 00:10:03,477
Mykel, get rid of this clown.

185
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,146
Hey, come with me.

186
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,356
- What the hell are you doing?
- You okay?

187
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:08,857
Thanks.

188
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:10,346
You shouldn't be out here alone.

189
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:12,124
It's dangerous. What if I didn't see you?

190
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:15,314
Thanks, but I can take care of myself.
I was just caught off guard by that guy.

191
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,868
Wait, I have to get back to
Felix. Where could he be?

192
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,287
Felix. He's over there,

193
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:22,496
with our teammates.

194
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:23,496
Ah.

195
00:10:24,488 --> 00:10:25,697
Come on, I'll accompany you.

196
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,960
Oh, but drink first.

197
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,253
No, thanks. I'm not in the mood to drink.

198
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:31,339
Please. Just one sip.

199
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:32,505
One sip.

200
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,979
- Too strong!
- It's good though, right?

201
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:48,814
More, more, more, more, more.

202
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:49,814
Hold on.

203
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:56,572
Where could Felix be?

204
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,308
- Jay…
- What the hell are you doing?!

205
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,084
Jay-jay… get out of here, please.

206
00:11:09,492 --> 00:11:11,160
You're their target.

207
00:11:12,055 --> 00:11:13,055
Huh?

208
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,310
Kiko...

209
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,295
Where are you, guys?

210
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,262
What happened to me?

211
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:26,346
Where's Felix?

212
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:40,945
Uh, miss?

213
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:41,945
Oh, crap!

214
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,971
Is there something on my face?

215
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:52,956
Huh?

216
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:54,500
'Cause you're staring at me.

217
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,293
Ah, sorry.

218
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,754
You look just like Keif…

219
00:13:59,263 --> 00:14:00,422
Mark Keifer Watson?

220
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,216
You're his sibling?

221
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,218
I'm his younger brother.

222
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,392
Please stop staring.

223
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:13,643
Sorry.

224
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,855
I can't believe Keifer
has a younger brother.

225
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,733
That's what they all
say. Even his classmates.

226
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:21,443
Hold on,

227
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,572
I have to go. Where's the exit?

228
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:28,784
Miss, if you're looking for my brother
and his friends, they're by the pool.

229
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,158
Come, I'll take you there.

230
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,537
Wait a minute.

231
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,160
If you're Keifer's brother…

232
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,377
Does that mean I'm in Keifer's house?!

233
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:39,837
Shit.

234
00:14:42,183 --> 00:14:44,418
Oh, sorry. I was just
realizing it now. Sorry, sorry.

235
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:47,428
But is this Keifer's house?

236
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,847
Yeah, I'm Keigan. And you are?

237
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:53,976
Jasper Jean— just call me Jay-jay.

238
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,393
Nice name.

239
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,728
Come, let's go.

240
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,318
Is this a resort?

241
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,029
Jay!

242
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:12,869
Felix?

243
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,455
What happened?!

244
00:15:15,597 --> 00:15:17,426
- Hello, Jay.
- Why did they do this to you?

245
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:19,918
They used Felix.

246
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:22,212
What do you mean?

247
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,786
You're the target of Kiko
and the other varsity players.

248
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,695
Felix discovered their plans.
That's why they ganged up on him.

249
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,302
Thank you.

250
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,431
But what happened last night?

251
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:34,683
And how did I end up here?

252
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,631
Calix texted me.

253
00:15:36,785 --> 00:15:39,844
He said you were at the party
and he couldn't find you and Felix.

254
00:15:40,296 --> 00:15:42,239
So at that moment I knew
something was wrong.

255
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,817
I called the boys to be there.

256
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:46,945
We caught Kiko in the act.

257
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,397
Before he could do anything,
we were able to stop him.

258
00:15:52,322 --> 00:15:54,078
He really had bad intentions.

259
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:58,457
What could've happened to me if
he was able to get away with it?

260
00:15:58,988 --> 00:16:01,366
I would have gotten pregnant!
Like Denzel and Grace 2.0!

261
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,799
If you caught us in the room.

262
00:16:08,832 --> 00:16:10,917
And my shirt's inside out…

263
00:16:11,045 --> 00:16:12,846
Does that mean you saw me naked?!

264
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:14,056
Did you change my clothes?

265
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,502
We saw nothing, Jay.

266
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:16,350
But my clothes…

267
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,018
You're being paranoid.
We saw nothing.

268
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,107
What do you remember?

269
00:16:24,433 --> 00:16:27,111
I know that something
bad almost happened to me.

270
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:28,778
But why...

271
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,532
why do I remember differently?

272
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:32,859
I promise you, I'm gonna win.

273
00:16:37,384 --> 00:16:40,958
Maybe this is how my brain
copes. It tends to forget.

274
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,628
It focuses on other things. Other emotions.

275
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,011
- You're such a cheater.
- Hey.

276
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,305
- It's obvious you're hiding cards.
- Ci-N.

277
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:56,348
Ci-N!

278
00:16:56,652 --> 00:17:00,102
Ci-N, stop that. You know what happens
when you get too rowdy.

279
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,731
- He's cheating.
- Can't take a joke?

280
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,977
What are you doing anyway?
Why are you getting upset?

281
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:06,567
Eh!

282
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,192
What is that?

283
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,575
This is the first time
we listened to Aries.

284
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:19,038
The order is for Jay-jay to
stay the night. This is better.

285
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,585
- If it's a pair, it must be the same.
- How?

286
00:17:24,884 --> 00:17:25,513
What?

287
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,958
Whatever's the same,
those are the ones you put down.

288
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,090
Calix said they're inside. Let's go!

289
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,962
Shit, Felix is gone! Where's Keifer?!

290
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,224
- What? Did you find them?
- Keifer, Keifer, Keifer!

291
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,287
We didn't find Felix,

292
00:17:44,527 --> 00:17:46,092
now we can't find Jay-Jay either!

293
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:54,990
But I saw Kiko.

294
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:56,784
He's drunk and...

295
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:58,327
he was carrying a girl.

296
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,662
I'm not sure but it looks like… Jay-jay!

297
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:01,830
That son of a bitch!

298
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:03,599
He's planning something bad with Jay-jay.

299
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,085
Calix, take Mica home.

300
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,253
Alright. Let's go.

301
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,005
Search all the rooms!

302
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,146
Hey, Aries!

303
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,386
What's happening here?

304
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:17,386
A... Aries...

305
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,226
Felix, what the fuck?

306
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,228
Why are there Section E in here?!

307
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,771
He's just a gatecrasher!

308
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:27,563
Jay...

309
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:28,273
Jay...

310
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:29,482
Jay!

311
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:37,865
Jay-Jay!

312
00:18:37,968 --> 00:18:39,177
Where is she?

313
00:18:40,918 --> 00:18:41,918
Kiko!

314
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:45,414
- Bro, don't listen to him.
- Kiko… it's Kiko.

315
00:18:45,439 --> 00:18:46,764
He's hallucinating, bro.

316
00:18:51,129 --> 00:18:52,256
Where the hell is Kiko?!

317
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:53,632
Where is Jay-jay?!

318
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:54,716
Aries, chill.

319
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:56,885
They're in the room upstairs.

320
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,763
Babe, go back in the car.

321
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:00,848
I have to find Jay-jay.

322
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,647
Where's Kiko?

323
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:10,573
Felix!

324
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:11,713
- Felix!
- You assholes!

325
00:19:11,738 --> 00:19:13,007
- What the hell did you do to Felix?!
- Felix!

326
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,110
He's still conscious.

327
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,447
- What nonsense is this?!
- He gatecrashed this party!

328
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,717
He's not the type who will gatecrash,
you fucking liar!

329
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:20,861
Eman, get Felix out of here.

330
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,788
Make sure that none of these fuckers
ever play basketball again!

331
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:41,555
Yuri! Keifer! Find Jay-jay.
We'll handle things here.

332
00:19:45,183 --> 00:19:46,183
Hurry up!

333
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,311
Let's go, Keifer!

334
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:49,730
Jay!

335
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,063
Jay!

336
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:51,106
Jay!

337
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:51,607
Jay!

338
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:52,482
Jay!

339
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:53,817
- Not here.
- She's not here!

340
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:56,235
Jay!

341
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,030
- Oh, sorry.
- Excuse us.

342
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,364
You fucking asshole!

343
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:00,157
Huh?

344
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,490
What?!

345
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:02,326
Let's get out of here.

346
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:03,534
Hey!

347
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,575
Didn't I tell you to stay
away from my cousin?!

348
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:09,864
- What?!
- Do not touch Jay-jay!

349
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,375
Fuck you!

350
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:15,589
- Where is Jay-jay?!
- Don't come in. I'll put her clothes back on.

351
00:20:18,867 --> 00:20:21,303
Fuck you! What did you do to Jay-jay?!

352
00:20:21,802 --> 00:20:22,471
Answer me!

353
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,597
You motherfucker!

354
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,016
Fuck.

355
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:31,690
Dammit!

356
00:20:34,088 --> 00:20:35,088
Jay-jay...

357
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,985
Where the hell is Jay-jay?

358
00:20:40,238 --> 00:20:42,199
Come inside. We need to talk.

359
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:43,825
Jay!

360
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:44,952
Jay!

361
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:45,744
- Jay!
- Jay!

362
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:46,286
Jay-jay!

363
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:47,746
What did Kiko do?!

364
00:20:47,771 --> 00:20:50,540
Nothing yet. But he was taking Jay's
shirt off when I got here.

365
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,751
I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch!

366
00:20:53,297 --> 00:20:56,397
Wait, we'll take Jay-jay to your place.
Then we're going back to punish Kiko!

367
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:56,838
No!

368
00:20:57,172 --> 00:21:00,412
She's gonna ask me questions when she wakes
up. And I don't know what to tell her.

369
00:21:02,445 --> 00:21:04,030
Can you just take her with you instead?

370
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:05,055
Really?

371
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,226
Come on, Jay. It's okay, let's go.

372
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:10,309
Wait, go slowly.

373
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,301
Just please...

374
00:21:11,326 --> 00:21:13,476
Don't tell her that I was here.

375
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,336
And take care of Jay-jay.

376
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,531
You know everything
went out of control, right?

377
00:21:23,113 --> 00:21:25,473
Jay-jay has been put in danger
too many times because of us.

378
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,413
One, two, three.

379
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,123
Four, five, six.

380
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,630
You know, you're too obvious, Keif.

381
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:41,675
You're falling for Jay-jay.

382
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,217
What did you say?

383
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:46,888
I know deep down how
you truly feel for Jay-jay.

384
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,375
And I know that you're just
gonna let her fall into a trap.

385
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,852
You're just gonna hurt her.

386
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:54,185
Whatever's the same,
that's the thing you put down.

387
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,150
What are you talking about?

388
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:01,194
At least I confessed
what I feel for Jay-jay.

389
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:06,181
That's why I'm begging you, Keifer.

390
00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:08,325
Can you please stop it?

391
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:09,953
Will you quit your plan?

392
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:16,918
Just because you went soft on Jay-jay,
doesn't mean the plan should change.

393
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,783
If you're still insisting that
this is part of your plan,

394
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,883
Keifer, just stop it already.

395
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,885
Even if it's not for Jay-jay.

396
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,597
Just do it for me, as your best friend.

397
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:44,153
Keif...

398
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:03,339
One... two...

399
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,590
What a cheater.

400
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:20,398
Yuri, about earlier…

401
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,528
I thought you're never gonna ask.

402
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:28,073
So, you're just waiting
for me to say something?

403
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:32,786
You're the one who kissed me,
but you expect me to approach you first?

404
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:37,332
I just want to hear what you think.

405
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:40,460
It's just…

406
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:44,714
people don't kiss others
without reason, right?

407
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:47,592
It depends.

408
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,427
What do you think that kiss means?

409
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:53,140
I don't know. That's why I'm asking you.

410
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:59,563
You know, if you're assuming
I like you, I won't deny it.

411
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:02,023
But I also won't confirm it.

412
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:03,774
What?

413
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:06,444
Then what is it? I don't understand.

414
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:10,448
Because if I deny it, you're
just gonna say I'm lying.

415
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:14,327
But if I confirm it, you'll push me away.

416
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:17,453
That's why I just won't
answer your question, Jay.

417
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:19,248
What?

418
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:25,881
- I don't wanna do this anymore.
- Come on.

419
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:28,091
Felix.

420
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:29,425
Hey.

421
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,011
You need something?

422
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,303
Nothing,

423
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:35,015
Jay. I'm really sorry.

424
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:40,562
Why are you apologizing?
I'm the one who should say sorry.

425
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:46,526
No, Jay. I shouldn't
have brought you there.

426
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,832
Then that incident wouldn't have happened.

427
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,365
Felix, look at me.

428
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,076
Stop thinking about it.

429
00:24:55,785 --> 00:25:01,249
Keifer and the others arrived and helped
us. What's important is that you're okay.

430
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:04,669
Thank you, Jay.

431
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:12,177
Keifer, breakfast is ready and I would like
to invite your friends to come and join us.

432
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:13,970
Keifer, your palm.

433
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:17,974
Keif, what happened?

434
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,321
I'll take that as a yes.

435
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:32,696
Follow me.

436
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:37,744
Keigan, Felix can't come with us.

437
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,413
He still can't walk properly.

438
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:43,750
I'll send the doctor and my
butler to come and help him.

439
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,210
Let's go.

440
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:46,878
Excited to eat.

441
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:48,254
Are you okay?

442
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:50,173
Thank you, Jay.

443
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:51,715
We'll go ahead, Jay.

444
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,092
Okay.

445
00:25:56,388 --> 00:26:00,475
Yuri, aren't you coming with them?

446
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:02,560
No, I'll stay here with you.

447
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:07,607
What happened to Keifer's
hand? Why is it bloody?

448
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:11,861
I said something he didn't like.
He took it out on the glass.

449
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:14,864
What did you say?

450
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,495
It's nothing, Jay.
Don't burden your mind with it.

451
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:22,122
Let's go to Keigan.

452
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,791
How old is Keigan, by the way?

453
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,041
14.

454
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:30,338
- He's so young.
- Don't ever trust that kid.

455
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:31,965
Why not?

456
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,340
He's a psychopath.

457
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,343
Is he crazy?

458
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:38,638
He's not really psychotic.
He just acts like it.

459
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:42,809
To make it easier for you.
He's worse than Keifer.

460
00:26:43,494 --> 00:26:44,494
Huh?

461
00:26:44,773 --> 00:26:48,861
So there's someone worse than him?
I thought he's the worst of the worst.

462
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:52,027
- Really?
- Yeah.

463
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:53,945
Should we go ahead?

464
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:58,825
- How about Felix?
- I'm alright here. Go ahead and eat.

465
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:03,746
- Yes, ma'am?
- Mr. Butler, please take care of Felix.

466
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:05,790
- Sure, okay.
- Thank you.

467
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,625
- Felix, we're just gonna eat.
- Are you okay?

468
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:10,754
Yes, I'm alright.

469
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:17,927
Jay!

470
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,136
Have a seat.

471
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:26,603
He seems like a gentleman.
Doesn't look worse than Keifer to me.

472
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,891
He actually looks like a
good boy version of Keifer.

473
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:30,648
Alright.

474
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:31,857
Thank you.

475
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,986
You woke up early today, Keiren.

476
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:36,528
Shut up.

477
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:40,533
Very stingy. So, Keiren's his name, huh?

478
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:44,579
I'll bet 25 cents, he's
also Keifer's brother.

479
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,627
Keifer, your hand…

480
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,960
Huh?

481
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:55,673
You gave me a handkerchief
for my wound before, right?

482
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:58,134
That's not sanitary.

483
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:04,349
So, Keifer's not really gay, huh?

484
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:11,481
He keeps bringing boys instead of girls.
So I thought he was gay.

485
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:17,445
Coming from someone
who can't even look Yoichi in the eyes.

486
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:23,868
Speaking of Yoichi, she called last night.
Said she's missing you.

487
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:29,623
- Who's Yoichi?
- Yuri's younger sister. Keiren's crush.

488
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:31,584
Shut up! She's not my crush!

489
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:34,913
Really? Why are you blushing?

490
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:37,382
I think I can see Keiren's future.

491
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,926
He's so similar to Keifer.

492
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:43,387
I just hope he doesn't grow up
to be an asshole like his brother.

493
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,597
What time is it, anyway?

494
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:46,808
It's 9:58.

495
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:49,602
9:58? Thanks.

496
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,771
I think I'll go home after eating.

497
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,023
Why? Are you going somewhere?

498
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:55,482
No.

499
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:59,112
Angelo is not aware I didn't go home.
He might look for me.

500
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,322
Angelo knows you're here.

501
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,450
Really?

502
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:07,912
We called him last night.
We also explained what happened.

503
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:09,441
So, you don't need to worry, Jay.

504
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:10,999
What did you tell him?

505
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,169
So, you have an older brother?

506
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,674
No, he's my cousin. He's older than me.

507
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,551
Oh, really?

508
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,010
What's his name?

509
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,889
Angelo. Michael Angelo Fernandez.

510
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,264
Boss is your cousin?!

511
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:30,059
Boss? Do you know him?

512
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:33,021
That's how Keifer and Yuri call him.

513
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:34,354
Didn't you know?

514
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:36,608
- They were always together before.
- Keigan.

515
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:44,365
Oh, sorry.

516
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:45,533
I keep asking questions.

517
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,700
It's okay.

518
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,454
Oh, Keiren. Someone's calling.

519
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,998
Hi, Yoichi!

520
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:54,459
Wanna talk to her?

521
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:58,087
[boys teasing Keiren]

522
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:00,923
Shut up!

523
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:05,428
Chill, alright?

524
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:09,474
Okay, class.
This will be the last one.

525
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:17,147
And as usual your grades
will be posted in the main building.

526
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:17,857
What?

527
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,651
Enjoy your sembreak.

528
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:21,026
Class dismissed.

529
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:22,320
See you next sem.

530
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:27,909
[Section E cheering]

531
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:30,286
- It's our break.
- Okay, okay.

532
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:34,666
Hey, Ci-N. What's up? Did you review?

533
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:37,041
You almost failed last exam.

534
00:30:37,066 --> 00:30:39,273
What are you gonna
do if I get a score of 100?

535
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,548
Nothing, because you wouldn't
get 100 on the exam.

536
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:44,092
But what if I do get 100?

537
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,595
- You wish.
- Just bet!

538
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:52,642
I will treat you…
to that coffee shop near our place.

539
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:54,519
That's horrible. Think of another one.

540
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:57,897
I will color my hair.

541
00:30:58,606 --> 00:30:59,232
Go.

542
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,025
You won't be allowed in here anymore.

543
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:04,404
- Then why does Yuri have red hair?
- That's his natural hair color.

544
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:07,699
Natural hair color, my ass.
What is he, a rooster?

545
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:12,369
So, what then? You're asking
but you don't agree to anything I say.

546
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,371
You think about it.

547
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:16,248
Ah.

548
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,336
You'll say your type among us.

549
00:31:20,878 --> 00:31:22,046
And you'll kiss him.

550
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:24,591
- Are you insane? No way!
- Why, you're scared?

551
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:25,757
I'm not scared.

552
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:27,593
You are.

553
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:31,097
Just admit that I can get a 100 score.

554
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:34,601
No, you can't. 100? You're dreaming.

555
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,727
Do you accept the deal then?

556
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:37,728
Deal.

557
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:41,899
But if you got 0, you gotta
review seriously, okay?

558
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:46,948
- You're too cocky.
- You have to keep your word.

559
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:48,989
Sure! You won't get 100 anyway.

560
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,241
You know what this is called?

561
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:53,577
- Hubris.
- No. It's natural… Natural genius.

562
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:54,938
- No, it's your hubris.
- Easy 100.

563
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,004
It's sem break. Finally!

564
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:05,423
A break from all the drama at school.

565
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,260
We're with kids.

566
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:11,054
I think it's safe here.

567
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:15,224
- Jay, let's go here.
- Ci-N, what's this?

568
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:17,851
Kids' halloween party?

569
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:18,603
Yeah.

570
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:21,356
They say I need a guardian,
that's why I brought you.

571
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:22,732
Guardian?

572
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:27,111
These kids need guardians,
sure, but you? You don't!

573
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:31,282
You're too old for parties like this.

574
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:33,200
I don't like adult parties.

575
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,911
No candies and chocolates.

576
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:37,579
Just let me go this once.

577
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,581
This is my last chance.

578
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:42,251
I don't have anyone else before
that's why I couldn't attend.

579
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:44,628
Alright.

580
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,713
Go and enjoy your party.
I'll be right here.

581
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:48,216
- Alright! Thank you!
- Ouch.

582
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:49,424
Zea?

583
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:50,551
Come here! Zea!

584
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,474
Is that Keiren?

585
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:58,183
What's your name?

586
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:00,269
Happy Halloween!

587
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,021
What's this?

588
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:04,148
A giveaway. Everybody gets one.

589
00:33:05,983 --> 00:33:08,027
Thank you. Happy Halloween.

590
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:09,861
Childish. That's not for you.

591
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:10,862
Keiren?!

592
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:13,116
It is you.

593
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:14,908
Don't call me by my first name.

594
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:16,160
We're not close.

595
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,704
Why are you taking it?
That's mine.

596
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:20,498
This is for kids.

597
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,793
- Keifer?
- Give it to me!

598
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:25,795
What are you doing?

599
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:28,422
Keiren, this is not yours.

600
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,091
You can't take what's not yours.

601
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:37,348
Fine. Here you go.

602
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:38,932
Alright!

603
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:43,603
- Jay-jay!
- What?

604
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,463
- Hey! Hey!
- What is it this time?!

605
00:33:46,023 --> 00:33:47,400
Are you with that kid?

606
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:48,359
Yeah.

607
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,319
He stole my niece's candy.

608
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:52,864
That's not nice. Give it back.

609
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,867
Give it to me! Here. I apologize.

610
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:02,081
Oh, no worries.

611
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,958
Let that kid have it back.

612
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:08,129
It's fine, as long as you agree
to have a date with me.

613
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:09,713
What?!

614
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,382
Keep your candy.
She'll never have a date with you.

615
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:13,884
You can't decide for her.

616
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,303
She's the one I'm asking.

617
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,221
Keifer, don't bother.
I'll talk to him.

618
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:21,267
- Sir, I'm really sorry…
- If I say no, it's a no.

619
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:24,102
Who are you anyway her dad?

620
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:26,355
No, but I'm much worse than her dad.

621
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,276
Keifer, stop it. Everyone's looking.

622
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,197
Who is this, Miss?
Your boyfriend?

623
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:38,867
No, but I'm really sorry.
I can't really go on a date.

624
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:40,076
I'll just return the candy.

625
00:34:40,077 --> 00:34:42,246
You're nothing to her after all, huh?

626
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:45,917
She's my wife.

627
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:50,630
Now, leave.

628
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,257
Let's go.

629
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,600
Is that Keiren?

630
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,019
Oh yeah, it is!

631
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,988
I'll just go over there, okay?
Wait a minute.

632
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:08,647
Keiren!

633
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:09,815
High-five!

634
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:11,943
It so fun here, right?

635
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,491
So many troublemakers lately.

636
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:22,453
Did you hear what happened to Kiko?

637
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:23,996
He got expelled.

638
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:25,372
Really?!

639
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:28,960
See? What did I tell you?
I told you to stay away from him, right?

640
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:30,628
I was right.

641
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:35,508
That's why Aries told me
to stay away from Kiko.

642
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:41,347
And that's why you always
listen to your husband.

643
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:46,434
Jerk.

644
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,482
It's kind of boring here.

645
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,484
Let's go.

646
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:55,736
I know another place.

647
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:58,363
Come on.

648
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:04,036
Hey, unfair! Don't leave without us.

649
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:08,374
- Slow down, you guys!
- We'll go ahead.

650
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,166
It feels like I suddenly
have three children.

651
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:11,209
Hey, you dropped something!

652
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,671
It's like we're a big happy family.

653
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:32,440
Come on, Keiren. Let's go over there!
Jay, will you hold on to this?

654
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:35,358
- Look at this kid.
- Hi girls.

655
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,985
-Said he doesn't want to be left alone,
- Can we dance with you?

656
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,111
- But goes off on his own.
- Yeah!

657
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:38,821
Of course!

658
00:36:38,822 --> 00:36:40,239
What are we gonna do here?

659
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:41,698
I'm bored.

660
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:43,284
I'll just grab some drinks.

661
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,870
Sure, I'll stay here.

662
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:52,959
Hi, miss.

663
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:54,336
You alone?

664
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:56,379
I'm with someone.

665
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,341
Come on, it's just one night.

666
00:36:58,591 --> 00:36:59,591
Hey.

667
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:01,010
She's not.

668
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:02,511
She's with me.

669
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:04,889
Mr. Blue Eyes!

670
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:06,097
My bad.

671
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:09,393
You again?

672
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:12,230
We always bump into each other.
What's your name?

673
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:14,649
You wanna know my name?

674
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:15,815
Yeah.

675
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,321
I'm Percy.

676
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,198
Percy Mariano.

677
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,450
Mariano?

678
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:27,870
We have the same surname.

679
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:31,415
But Percy… Percy! You're the…

680
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:35,503
- Percy? You're…
- I know.

681
00:37:36,306 --> 00:37:40,424
You probably have a lot of questions
but save it. For the future.

682
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,843
I can't say anything right now.

683
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:44,679
Why not?

684
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,098
I can't tell.

685
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:51,185
But here, put your number in.

686
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:53,562
I'll call you if I can.
As soon as possible.

687
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:58,985
Once I can, I'll call you.

688
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:06,408
Hey.

689
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:07,575
Who was that guy?

690
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:11,998
No one. I thought I knew him.

691
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:13,916
Let's stay here.

692
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,170
Look at that jerk.

693
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:21,215
He used your brother to flirt with girls.

694
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:22,758
Should I expose him to Rakki?

695
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,682
Why are you laughing?

696
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:31,684
Aren't you gonna go to your brother?

697
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:34,811
No.

698
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:37,481
Even though it looks fun there,

699
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:39,567
I'll stay here.

700
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:42,027
Why?

701
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,822
Just go. It looks fun to you, right?

702
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:46,823
Are you sure?

703
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,492
Because I'm really gonna go.

704
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,162
I'm starting to get jealous of Keiren.

705
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:53,831
Then, go!

706
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,292
Work your way with those bunny girls.

707
00:38:58,252 --> 00:38:59,252
I won't.

708
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:01,672
You're getting mad already.

709
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:05,134
No way. Why would I get mad?

710
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:08,554
Asshole!

711
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:12,766
Hi.

712
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:16,479
I've been eyeing you for a while now.
I just want to say hi.

713
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:18,481
Sure, I'm Keifer.

714
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:21,400
Hi, Keifer. Come on, let's dance!

715
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:24,862
Let's go, Jay. Let's dance.

716
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:26,447
No, thanks.

717
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,031
Come now, let's go.

718
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:30,493
Come, let's go!

719
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,203
Come on.

720
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:33,995
Let's go.

721
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:41,127
This jerk. Why did he drag me here?

722
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:42,379
What am I, a post?!

723
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:44,173
So fun, right?

724
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,258
I could do that too.

725
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:48,134
So fun, right?

726
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:49,178
Right? Fun?

727
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:52,972
Keifer, you're too stiff.

728
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:54,350
Just relax.

729
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,978
I feel like slapping a bunny right now.

730
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:05,026
Oh, excuse me.

731
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:06,403
Sorry, sorry. Excuse me.

732
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:16,455
Why are you here?

733
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,291
There's your partner.
You two look so happy, didn't you?

734
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:21,377
You don't wanna dance with me?

735
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,629
No, you were already dancing with someone.

736
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:29,135
Come on. Let's dance, come on. Let's dance.

737
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,053
What the hell.

738
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:38,601
Enough! We look stupid.

739
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:39,979
Let's dance properly.

740
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:42,147
Will you dance normally if I stop dancing?

741
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:44,023
Yeah, as long as you do it properly.

742
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:45,234
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.

743
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:48,778
This is so corny.

744
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,614
Shit, corny!

745
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,908
Let's go. My God, girl.

746
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:54,701
Oh my God.

747
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:07,173
Can I have this dance with you?

748
00:42:26,543 --> 00:42:28,212
I don't want to look into his eyes.

749
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:30,214
I'm scared.

750
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:34,008
Because I might not be
able to take my eyes off him.

751
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:36,303
Jay... eyes here.

752
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:44,728
We're here.

753
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:47,189
Let's make the most of it.

754
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:11,171
It wasn't a false memory.

755
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,924
What happened that night was all true.

756
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:25,394
The feeling I feel right until this moment.

757
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:31,775
I like him.

758
00:45:55,307 --> 00:45:56,347
Thanks for taking me home.

759
00:45:56,552 --> 00:45:57,552
Good night.

760
00:45:57,861 --> 00:45:58,861
What?

761
00:45:59,375 --> 00:46:00,924
I thought you said something.

762
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,050
Gotcha! Jay!

763
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:04,011
Let me borrow money. I just need it.

764
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:05,261
Five thousand.

765
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:07,507
Where are you going?
Are you avoiding me because of...

766
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:09,475
Jay-jay's gonna announce something.

767
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:10,559
Wow! What is it?

768
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:14,563
If I get 100 in the exams,
she'll admit who she likes among us.

769
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:17,357
Alright! Alright! I'll tell you.

770
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:20,152
[Section E chattering]

771
00:46:22,097 --> 00:46:25,491
Class announcement. University
of Hemilton is inviting us.

772
00:46:25,516 --> 00:46:27,016
Please, be ready with your requirements.

773
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:29,369
Hey, Drew. You're absent
again. Where are you?

774
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:30,662
I'm here at Kingsground.

775
00:46:30,838 --> 00:46:32,132
Kingsground? What's that?

776
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:32,831
Who are you talking to?

777
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:35,334
It's Drew. He said he's at Kingsground.

778
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:37,336
- Yuri.
- Where's Drew?

779
00:46:37,499 --> 00:46:38,003
Jay.

780
00:46:38,028 --> 00:46:38,529
Damn!

781
00:46:38,757 --> 00:46:39,301
What?

782
00:46:39,703 --> 00:46:40,880
She's at Kingsground!

783
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:42,256
Kingsground?!

784
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:43,425
Do you gamble here?

785
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:45,385
That fight's annoying.

786
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:46,678
Yuri, you know what to do.

787
00:46:46,703 --> 00:46:47,703
Yuri.

788
00:46:47,728 --> 00:46:49,507
Did you really have to do that?

789
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:50,681
Yes, Jay.

790
00:46:51,397 --> 00:46:52,523
I need to fight.
