1
00:00:15,512 --> 00:00:18,680
What do you mean Freya's the reason
why Ci-N is in Section E?

2
00:00:18,681 --> 00:00:19,516
Ci-N kissed me.

3
00:00:19,517 --> 00:00:21,308
And Freya got mad because…

4
00:00:21,309 --> 00:00:22,643
apparently, she likes Ci-N too.

5
00:00:22,644 --> 00:00:25,395
So, we got into a fight and
she made stories about Ci-N.

6
00:00:25,396 --> 00:00:28,232
After that, everyone accused
Ci-N of being a thief.

7
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:30,609
Ci-N, a thief? He's too childish for that.

8
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:31,444
Hey, he's not childish.

9
00:00:31,444 --> 00:00:32,195
You want pancakes?

10
00:00:32,362 --> 00:00:36,156
You offered, but it's not cooked.
You're really something else, kid.

11
00:00:36,157 --> 00:00:37,241
Then just cook it.

12
00:00:37,242 --> 00:00:38,034
Is that him?

13
00:00:38,035 --> 00:00:39,451
He stole it!

14
00:00:39,452 --> 00:00:40,994
Are you sure? You have proof?

15
00:00:40,995 --> 00:00:42,329
Don't butt in!

16
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,164
What if I punch you in the mouth?!

17
00:00:44,165 --> 00:00:46,458
- I will really do it!
- Jay-jay, just let them be!

18
00:00:46,459 --> 00:00:47,418
Oh my…

19
00:00:47,419 --> 00:00:49,712
Ci-N. You did it again?

20
00:00:50,213 --> 00:00:51,505
Why didn't you tell me?!

21
00:00:51,506 --> 00:00:53,590
I'm scared you'll look at me differently.

22
00:00:53,591 --> 00:00:56,552
It's as if you're proving
that what they're saying is true!

23
00:00:56,553 --> 00:00:57,595
Jay-jay!

24
00:00:57,887 --> 00:00:59,055
Why did you do that?

25
00:00:59,389 --> 00:01:01,848
I miss my friends from Section E.

26
00:01:01,849 --> 00:01:03,184
And Ci-N is one of them.

27
00:01:03,518 --> 00:01:05,102
That's the money you paid that bitch!

28
00:01:05,103 --> 00:01:06,728
Ci-N didn't steal that!

29
00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:07,729
I did!

30
00:01:08,481 --> 00:01:11,066
I'll pay for the cafe's entire
earnings for the day.

31
00:01:11,067 --> 00:01:13,026
Just get rid of all the customers here.

32
00:01:13,027 --> 00:01:14,779
Most especially the judgmental ones.

33
00:01:17,657 --> 00:01:18,741
Here it comes.

34
00:01:19,492 --> 00:01:20,994
Excuse me, Ma'am, Sir.

35
00:01:21,286 --> 00:01:22,328
Here's your order.

36
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:26,540
Coffee.

37
00:01:27,834 --> 00:01:28,918
Iced tea.

38
00:01:30,211 --> 00:01:31,462
Enjoy your meal.

39
00:01:31,963 --> 00:01:33,131
Thank you.

40
00:01:37,885 --> 00:01:39,387
Here. Eat up.

41
00:01:40,138 --> 00:01:42,181
About time.
I'm so famished.

42
00:01:42,348 --> 00:01:43,850
I've been biking a long way.

43
00:01:53,693 --> 00:01:56,863
I'm drenched in sweat.
I'm so hungry.

44
00:01:58,364 --> 00:01:59,282
Mmmm.

45
00:01:59,283 --> 00:02:00,450
It's so tasty!

46
00:02:02,827 --> 00:02:03,827
Why?

47
00:02:04,162 --> 00:02:04,787
Hmm?

48
00:02:04,788 --> 00:02:06,497
Why did you do that for Ci-N?

49
00:02:11,669 --> 00:02:13,254
Ci-N is like a brother to me.

50
00:02:14,547 --> 00:02:15,882
You know that feeling when...

51
00:02:16,299 --> 00:02:19,051
an older sister can't bear
to see her brother get hurt?

52
00:02:19,052 --> 00:02:20,219
That's how it felt.

53
00:02:21,804 --> 00:02:23,097
Don't you have any siblings?

54
00:02:23,806 --> 00:02:25,682
Why do you care so much for Ci-N?

55
00:02:25,683 --> 00:02:27,852
I wasn't informed this is
gonna be an interview.

56
00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:29,145
I'm just curious.

57
00:02:32,982 --> 00:02:34,691
My Auntie told me
I had an older brother.

58
00:02:34,692 --> 00:02:37,362
But my mom put him up for adoption.

59
00:02:37,612 --> 00:02:38,821
I never met him.

60
00:02:46,704 --> 00:02:49,165
What's up? Have you told Jay yet?

61
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,196
How about you?
Don't you have any siblings?

62
00:03:20,405 --> 00:03:23,032
I do. She's in Japan.
With my parents.

63
00:03:23,241 --> 00:03:24,909
She's eight years younger than me.

64
00:03:29,205 --> 00:03:30,539
Edrix, where are you?

65
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,335
We just finished playing basketball.
We're starving. Let's go eat!

66
00:03:34,711 --> 00:03:35,795
I'll be there.

67
00:03:40,216 --> 00:03:41,259
[Yuri laughs]

68
00:03:42,218 --> 00:03:43,469
It's delicious.

69
00:03:49,642 --> 00:03:50,642
This is so good!

70
00:03:54,814 --> 00:03:58,025
I shouldn't be feeling this way.
I'm confused...

71
00:03:58,735 --> 00:04:01,571
All this time, I thought I loved Ella.

72
00:04:06,387 --> 00:04:09,219
But fuck. I will no longer deny it.

73
00:04:14,336 --> 00:04:16,713
I'm starting to feel something for Jay-jay.

74
00:04:19,172 --> 00:04:20,172
Delicious!

75
00:04:20,173 --> 00:04:21,466
I've finished it.

76
00:04:22,383 --> 00:04:25,136
But why her of all people?

77
00:04:26,512 --> 00:04:28,890
Why did I fall for the person Keifer hates?

78
00:04:31,559 --> 00:04:33,686
I'm the only one eating.
You might say I'm a glutton.

79
00:04:35,438 --> 00:04:36,606
Here's some more.

80
00:04:38,024 --> 00:04:39,192
Don't you want some?

81
00:04:46,073 --> 00:04:48,116
Keifer's just gonna use her.

82
00:04:48,117 --> 00:04:51,996
I don't know how, but I don't want
to see it nor imagine it.

83
00:04:53,915 --> 00:04:56,709
I don't think I can bear
seeing Jay-jay in tears.

84
00:05:02,465 --> 00:05:06,344
This tastes similar to the muffins
Auntie Gemma makes.

85
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:10,931
Have you ever had a boyfriend?

86
00:05:10,932 --> 00:05:11,932
Huh?!

87
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,143
Why the sudden question?

88
00:05:14,266 --> 00:05:15,642
I'm just asking.

89
00:05:17,855 --> 00:05:18,856
I have.

90
00:05:19,065 --> 00:05:20,066
Really?

91
00:05:20,733 --> 00:05:22,360
Why do you sound so surprised?

92
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:25,279
As if I'm too ugly
to have a relationship.

93
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:26,613
It's not that. What I mean is...

94
00:05:26,614 --> 00:05:28,304
But it's true. I had two.

95
00:05:29,659 --> 00:05:31,536
What happened?
Why did you break up?

96
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,289
The first one...

97
00:05:35,998 --> 00:05:38,251
he came out. Apparently,
he's actually gay.

98
00:05:38,376 --> 00:05:39,460
The second one...

99
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,547
he's in the hospital.

100
00:05:42,797 --> 00:05:43,840
Comatose.

101
00:05:44,841 --> 00:05:46,259
Why? What happened?

102
00:05:48,553 --> 00:05:49,929
I don't remember anymore.

103
00:05:50,221 --> 00:05:51,973
Anyway. Let's not talk about it.

104
00:05:52,181 --> 00:05:54,559
How about you?
Share something about your love life.

105
00:05:54,809 --> 00:05:55,852
Oh, me?

106
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,520
Nothing serious.

107
00:05:57,895 --> 00:05:59,480
But I fell in love once.

108
00:06:00,189 --> 00:06:01,858
And she didn't love me back.

109
00:06:02,233 --> 00:06:03,233
Was it Ella?

110
00:06:03,985 --> 00:06:04,902
Oh...

111
00:06:04,902 --> 00:06:05,902
sorry.

112
00:06:07,363 --> 00:06:09,155
That's okay. It's all in the past.

113
00:06:09,156 --> 00:06:11,032
Really? Is that so?

114
00:06:11,033 --> 00:06:12,076
You're annoying.

115
00:06:12,368 --> 00:06:13,619
There's Ella!

116
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,789
[Jay-jay chuckles]

117
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,207
You're so annoying, Jay.

118
00:06:20,042 --> 00:06:21,252
Eat something too.

119
00:06:21,961 --> 00:06:23,920
Go on. I don't really eat those.

120
00:06:23,921 --> 00:06:25,256
Then why did you order them?

121
00:06:25,756 --> 00:06:26,799
No idea.

122
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:29,427
You're really out of it!

123
00:06:33,973 --> 00:06:35,641
How will you go home later?

124
00:06:37,143 --> 00:06:39,686
I'll ride my bike.
It's too tiring, honestly.

125
00:06:39,687 --> 00:06:41,521
It's too far away.
I got drenched in sweat.

126
00:06:41,522 --> 00:06:42,522
Shall I take you home?

127
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,940
Mmm?

128
00:08:14,782 --> 00:08:15,782
Keif.

129
00:08:18,077 --> 00:08:18,786
Hey.

130
00:08:19,036 --> 00:08:20,036
Damn.

131
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:21,789
What's his problem?

132
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,374
You're in a bad mood, Keif?

133
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:24,917
That's why I followed.

134
00:08:25,126 --> 00:08:26,669
It's the Jay-jay situation.

135
00:08:27,622 --> 00:08:28,622
It's a mess.

136
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,423
So...

137
00:08:30,881 --> 00:08:31,881
what's the plan?

138
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:35,636
Hopefully, Edrix can hack the CCTV records.

139
00:08:35,803 --> 00:08:37,930
Find proof that Ci-N didn't steal anything.

140
00:08:38,889 --> 00:08:40,391
Almost done bypassing the firewall.

141
00:08:40,933 --> 00:08:42,935
And then, I just need to
decrypt the storage files.

142
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,270
Wait...

143
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,440
Someone blocked my access!

144
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:48,399
Huh?

145
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,276
I can't get in! What the hell!

146
00:08:50,526 --> 00:08:52,444
- I need to re-route.
- I'm too dumb for this stuff.

147
00:08:52,445 --> 00:08:53,445
Hold on, hold on.

148
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:54,530
Damn!

149
00:08:54,822 --> 00:08:55,822
What?!

150
00:08:56,115 --> 00:08:57,658
The system locked me out!

151
00:09:00,661 --> 00:09:01,829
Sorry, Keif.

152
00:09:02,621 --> 00:09:03,873
Can't get it this time around.

153
00:09:04,331 --> 00:09:06,876
I still can't get inside
the CCTV record archives.

154
00:09:07,168 --> 00:09:08,293
You did your best.

155
00:09:08,294 --> 00:09:10,212
Why don't we just get
a copy from the admin?

156
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:11,297
That's right.

157
00:09:11,298 --> 00:09:12,630
Are you guys thinking straight?

158
00:09:12,631 --> 00:09:13,757
We're Section E.

159
00:09:13,758 --> 00:09:15,759
Do you really think
that'll work? Good lord.

160
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,053
That makes sense.

161
00:09:18,596 --> 00:09:20,139
Well that's something else.

162
00:09:21,015 --> 00:09:22,640
You look genuinely
concerned for Jay-jay.

163
00:09:22,641 --> 00:09:23,267
Hey!

164
00:09:23,268 --> 00:09:24,601
- Dumbass!
- Bad joke.

165
00:09:24,602 --> 00:09:26,270
Just kidding.
It was a joke, dude.

166
00:09:26,687 --> 00:09:28,064
Can't you take a joke?

167
00:09:29,607 --> 00:09:31,025
Oh? What now?

168
00:09:32,193 --> 00:09:33,193
Now...

169
00:09:33,569 --> 00:09:34,695
we move to Plan X.

170
00:09:35,071 --> 00:09:36,112
Let's go!

171
00:09:36,113 --> 00:09:37,739
That's in English, guys.
You got nothing on me.

172
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,740
This is fun.

173
00:09:39,658 --> 00:09:40,658
Hold on...

174
00:09:41,035 --> 00:09:42,285
Where is Yuri, by the way?

175
00:09:42,286 --> 00:09:43,995
- Why isn't he here?
- Yeah, you're right.

176
00:09:43,996 --> 00:09:44,997
Where is he?

177
00:09:45,164 --> 00:09:46,790
His hair is stark red and yet
you can't find him?

178
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:47,957
He looks like a rooster
for god's sake!

179
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:48,834
He's gone missing again.

180
00:09:48,835 --> 00:09:51,252
- Maybe he's in their shop.
- You asked about it, didn't you? Are you stupid?

181
00:09:51,253 --> 00:09:52,004
I'll beat your ass.

182
00:09:52,005 --> 00:09:53,005
Let's do one game?

183
00:09:53,006 --> 00:09:54,799
Huh? One more game?

184
00:09:55,049 --> 00:09:55,966
Let's go.

185
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,727
- I don't really feel like it.
- Another one?

186
00:09:57,843 --> 00:09:59,260
All of you are soft.

187
00:09:59,261 --> 00:10:00,637
- Let me just get my things.
- Wow...

188
00:10:00,638 --> 00:10:01,597
Game, let's go!

189
00:10:01,598 --> 00:10:03,307
- But I was game.
- Did you hear that?

190
00:10:03,557 --> 00:10:04,641
- Soft.
- Let's play, guys.

191
00:10:04,642 --> 00:10:05,642
What does he mean?

192
00:10:07,186 --> 00:10:08,186
You asshole.

193
00:10:08,729 --> 00:10:11,774
When you said you're gonna take me home,
I thought you had a car.

194
00:10:14,735 --> 00:10:17,113
Hey! Don't hold me there!
I'm getting ticklish!

195
00:10:17,363 --> 00:10:20,782
- What's the problem?! The backseat is tiny!
- Just grab onto something else! Not there!

196
00:10:20,783 --> 00:10:21,700
Huh?!

197
00:10:21,701 --> 00:10:22,784
Here!

198
00:10:22,785 --> 00:10:25,036
Not there! On my shoulders!
Hold on to my shoulders!

199
00:10:25,037 --> 00:10:25,871
On your shoulders?

200
00:10:25,872 --> 00:10:27,998
- On my shoulders!
- [Jay-jay screams]

201
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,660
- Jay, are you okay?
- Ouch...

202
00:10:35,131 --> 00:10:36,549
Oh shit, you got hurt!

203
00:10:40,469 --> 00:10:41,469
Are you okay, Jay?

204
00:10:44,098 --> 00:10:45,432
Just a moment.
[Jay-jay flinches]

205
00:10:48,144 --> 00:10:49,727
- Slow down!
- You didn't listen to me!

206
00:10:49,728 --> 00:10:51,063
Be gentle with it!

207
00:10:52,022 --> 00:10:53,566
Come on, are you okay?

208
00:10:54,191 --> 00:10:56,277
- This is your fault.
- Hop in. Let's just go.

209
00:10:57,361 --> 00:10:58,403
Let's just walk from here.

210
00:10:58,404 --> 00:10:59,405
No, ride the bike.

211
00:11:00,281 --> 00:11:01,406
What if we fall again?!

212
00:11:01,407 --> 00:11:03,492
You're not gonna fall.
Just hop on.

213
00:11:05,828 --> 00:11:06,912
So pushy.

214
00:11:07,955 --> 00:11:09,581
You're so stubborn.
You can't stay still.

215
00:11:09,582 --> 00:11:11,249
- It's you who's stubborn.
- No, it's you.

216
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,251
You are!

217
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,002
Am I the one driving?!

218
00:11:14,003 --> 00:11:15,171
Just get on it!

219
00:11:15,921 --> 00:11:17,465
My helmet!

220
00:11:21,385 --> 00:11:22,677
[Jay-jay groans]

221
00:11:22,678 --> 00:11:23,928
You're so slow. Just get on!

222
00:11:23,929 --> 00:11:25,014
Can't you wait?

223
00:11:26,098 --> 00:11:26,724
You good?

224
00:11:26,724 --> 00:11:27,724
Yeah.

225
00:11:28,058 --> 00:11:30,101
You're gonna walk?
Our house is still far from here.

226
00:11:30,102 --> 00:11:31,812
I can handle it, Jay. Just stay still.

227
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:33,981
Alright then.

228
00:11:33,981 --> 00:11:34,981
Yeah.

229
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,320
Are you okay, Jay?

230
00:11:39,653 --> 00:11:40,988
I should be asking you that.

231
00:11:41,614 --> 00:11:43,198
I told you I can walk.

232
00:11:43,199 --> 00:11:45,743
Just don't argue
anymore, Jay. Please.

233
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,538
Hey. It's here!

234
00:11:49,914 --> 00:11:50,414
Here?

235
00:11:50,415 --> 00:11:51,873
- Yeah. Here.
- Wait...

236
00:11:51,874 --> 00:11:52,917
Just stay still, alright?

237
00:11:56,253 --> 00:11:58,088
Hold on...

238
00:11:58,964 --> 00:12:00,131
What are you doing?

239
00:12:00,132 --> 00:12:02,384
Jay, don't be stubborn.
You can't even walk right now.

240
00:12:09,433 --> 00:12:10,476
Jay-jay!

241
00:12:11,143 --> 00:12:12,143
Jay...

242
00:12:13,938 --> 00:12:14,938
What's the matter?

243
00:12:15,689 --> 00:12:17,857
I'm sorry. I got her injured.

244
00:12:17,858 --> 00:12:19,151
Get down from there.

245
00:12:19,485 --> 00:12:21,195
It's embarrassing to your companion.

246
00:12:21,403 --> 00:12:23,197
But Grandma, he insists on carrying me.

247
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,908
Grandma, do you have
a first-aid kit?

248
00:12:26,909 --> 00:12:29,203
Of course we do. Come on inside.

249
00:12:29,495 --> 00:12:30,913
Hurry up. Go on.

250
00:12:31,121 --> 00:12:33,582
Your wound needs to be treated.

251
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:35,209
Sorry...

252
00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:36,085
Quickly!

253
00:12:36,086 --> 00:12:37,253
You can put me down here.

254
00:12:37,419 --> 00:12:40,547
Come on. Here.
Over here.

255
00:12:41,465 --> 00:12:42,758
What on Earth happened to you?

256
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:44,760
What happened?

257
00:12:46,387 --> 00:12:47,554
Put me down here.

258
00:12:48,055 --> 00:12:49,890
- Sorry, sorry.
- There, there, there.

259
00:12:50,266 --> 00:12:51,266
Thank you.

260
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,895
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

261
00:12:55,896 --> 00:12:57,273
- I'll do it.
- Just let me, Jay.

262
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:10,995
Where are you hurting?

263
00:13:19,211 --> 00:13:20,629
[Grandma reacts]

264
00:13:21,046 --> 00:13:23,882
He's gonna put an ointment.
That would sting.

265
00:13:26,677 --> 00:13:27,677
[Jay-jay flinches]

266
00:13:28,053 --> 00:13:29,847
Sorry, Jay. Sorry...

267
00:13:30,973 --> 00:13:32,266
Just a little more, Jay.

268
00:13:32,641 --> 00:13:33,808
What happened?

269
00:13:33,809 --> 00:13:34,977
I have no idea.

270
00:13:37,771 --> 00:13:38,938
Here it goes, Jay.

271
00:13:38,939 --> 00:13:40,023
I'll cover your wound.

272
00:13:40,024 --> 00:13:41,442
Hold on for a little longer.

273
00:13:48,282 --> 00:13:49,282
There.

274
00:13:52,995 --> 00:13:53,995
It's done, Jay.

275
00:13:54,204 --> 00:13:55,039
Thank you.

276
00:13:55,205 --> 00:13:56,205
This should do it.

277
00:13:58,626 --> 00:14:00,002
Is he your boyfriend?

278
00:14:03,797 --> 00:14:05,132
He's not her boyfriend.

279
00:14:07,593 --> 00:14:08,927
Are you courting her?

280
00:14:09,636 --> 00:14:12,043
No, Grandma.

281
00:14:12,139 --> 00:14:13,349
He's my classmate.

282
00:14:13,807 --> 00:14:14,475
Yes.

283
00:14:14,476 --> 00:14:16,518
Oohh... classmate.

284
00:14:17,311 --> 00:14:19,980
Alright. Thank you very much for your help.

285
00:14:20,397 --> 00:14:22,440
I'm done using this too.
Thank you.

286
00:14:22,441 --> 00:14:23,817
What are you doing here?

287
00:14:24,651 --> 00:14:26,070
It's none of your business.

288
00:14:28,864 --> 00:14:31,200
Grandma, my apologies.
I'll get going now.

289
00:14:31,992 --> 00:14:33,285
Wait. Do not go yet.

290
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:35,179
Have dinner with us.

291
00:14:35,204 --> 00:14:36,955
Granda, just let him leave.

292
00:14:37,206 --> 00:14:39,041
He's not welcome in this house.

293
00:14:44,046 --> 00:14:45,171
Aries...

294
00:14:45,172 --> 00:14:46,172
Grandma?

295
00:14:47,716 --> 00:14:48,801
Grandma?

296
00:14:49,385 --> 00:14:50,469
[Grandma scoffs]

297
00:14:51,303 --> 00:14:53,596
[Aries flinches in pain]

298
00:14:53,597 --> 00:14:54,056
Ouch!

299
00:14:54,181 --> 00:14:56,475
That's not even my full strength.

300
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,059
[Grandma chuckles]

301
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,104
When did you become disrespectful?

302
00:15:00,646 --> 00:15:03,941
We don't treat our guests that way.

303
00:15:04,441 --> 00:15:05,441
You understand?

304
00:15:05,526 --> 00:15:06,860
He's a guest.

305
00:15:11,657 --> 00:15:13,075
Don't leave yet.

306
00:15:13,409 --> 00:15:15,577
Please have dinner here.

307
00:15:16,829 --> 00:15:18,205
Rosario!

308
00:15:18,914 --> 00:15:19,914
Ruth!

309
00:15:23,085 --> 00:15:24,128
Oh, dear.

310
00:15:25,295 --> 00:15:28,424
You two are so slow!
Watching a TV drama again?

311
00:15:29,716 --> 00:15:32,469
Set the table.
We're gonna have dinner.

312
00:15:32,761 --> 00:15:34,054
You, Jay-jay.

313
00:15:34,263 --> 00:15:34,805
Yes?

314
00:15:34,806 --> 00:15:36,264
- Change clothes.
- Oh, alright.

315
00:15:36,265 --> 00:15:38,183
Aren't you embarrassed
in front of your friend?

316
00:15:38,434 --> 00:15:40,394
- Go on. Fix yourself.
- Yes, Grandma.

317
00:15:41,478 --> 00:15:42,438
[Jay-jay reacts in pain]

318
00:15:42,439 --> 00:15:43,980
Go on, boy.

319
00:15:43,981 --> 00:15:46,336
You go ahead to the
dining room. I'll help her.

320
00:15:46,733 --> 00:15:48,068
- Oh, okay.
- Okay.

321
00:15:49,736 --> 00:15:50,612
Grandma, let's go.

322
00:15:50,613 --> 00:15:51,738
- Okay.
- Let's eat.

323
00:15:52,072 --> 00:15:53,072
Come here.

324
00:15:53,365 --> 00:15:54,783
Slowly.

325
00:15:56,827 --> 00:16:00,831
Just because your Aunt Gemma isn't around,
you have the nerve to bring a boy here.

326
00:16:01,165 --> 00:16:03,417
It's not like that.
He's just a classmate.

327
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:06,794
After what happened to your ex,
you have the nerve to flirt again?

328
00:16:06,795 --> 00:16:08,005
It's not like that.

329
00:16:08,297 --> 00:16:09,965
Did you know he woke up?

330
00:16:11,175 --> 00:16:12,634
And he was looking for you.

331
00:16:15,929 --> 00:16:18,056
I'm leaving. You better behave yourself.

332
00:16:18,682 --> 00:16:19,683
Come on.

333
00:16:21,185 --> 00:16:22,728
Move now.

334
00:16:23,187 --> 00:16:24,021
Slowly.

335
00:16:24,022 --> 00:16:25,063
[Jay-jay reacts in pain]

336
00:16:26,732 --> 00:16:28,692
Who are your parents again, Yuri?

337
00:16:30,652 --> 00:16:32,446
Yumori and Yakito Hanamitchi.

338
00:16:32,738 --> 00:16:35,115
Oh, Japanese.

339
00:16:35,282 --> 00:16:36,282
Grandma.

340
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,535
He's the grandson of Yuori Hanamitchi.

341
00:16:38,952 --> 00:16:40,952
The owner of the company
we're closing a deal with.

342
00:16:41,747 --> 00:16:43,499
Ahh, I see.

343
00:16:43,957 --> 00:16:45,037
[In Japanese]
Good evening.

344
00:16:45,542 --> 00:16:46,752
[In Japanese]
Thank you.

345
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:48,504
You know how to speak Japanese?

346
00:16:48,629 --> 00:16:49,880
I'm just imitating the words.

347
00:16:49,963 --> 00:16:50,963
[Yuri chuckles]

348
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,133
How is your grandfather now?

349
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,927
He's currently in Japan.

350
00:16:59,264 --> 00:17:02,183
- After you eat, tell him to go home.
- Wait a minute…

351
00:17:02,184 --> 00:17:03,309
have you been to Japan?

352
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:05,394
- After you eat, tell him to go home!
- Not yet.

353
00:17:05,395 --> 00:17:06,395
Not yet?

354
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:09,607
- You should go to Japan.
- I'm planning to.

355
00:17:09,608 --> 00:17:12,319
- I will.
- My most favorite is there.

356
00:17:12,444 --> 00:17:14,487
- If you don't want that, I'll have it.
- It's not yucky.

357
00:17:14,488 --> 00:17:16,155
- But it's sukiyaki.
- What these?

358
00:17:16,156 --> 00:17:17,282
Sure!

359
00:17:17,616 --> 00:17:20,452
Alright, let's continue eating.

360
00:17:20,953 --> 00:17:22,073
You can have the rest of it.

361
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,580
Jay-jay.

362
00:17:25,123 --> 00:17:27,124
You don't seem too keen on vegetables.

363
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:30,169
You should train yourself to eat them.

364

Why are you pressuring me?

your turn.

553
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:58,094
You're so good! Alright!

00:25:59,429 --> 00:26:01,681
- Alright.
- You're okay now?

Well, duh? Are you dumb?
Hell yeah, it's mine.

There's my face on the DP.
It's so, so pretty.

563

will post trash like this?!

Are you taking me to school because
you don't have a bike to steal?

706
00:33:08,065 --> 00:33:09,065
Get it.

707

Okay.

You know, good thing
you gave me a ride.

713
00:33:27,064 --> 00:33:28,613
Why are you in our village again?

714

Ah... I went somewhere nearby.

Yeah.

lunch for Keifer too?

- Payment—
- Because she wants to.

00:33:47,688 --> 00:33:49,500
That's not true!
This is payment for my debt!

Debt?

hear an earful from you!

00:34:00,076 --> 00:34:01,284
I said, give it back!

729
00:34:01,285 --> 00:34:02,954
- Huh?
- Give it back now!

730
00:34:03,287 --> 00:34:04,287

You're so annoying!

732

Give it back, Keifer!
Stop treating me like a kid!

733
00:34:09,001 --> 00:34:10,294
My arms are getting tired.

734
00:34:10,628 --> 00:34:12,129
I'm getting tired!

735

There.

736
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,926
Look what you did.

737
00:34:17,802 --> 00:34:18,802
Give it to me.

738
00:34:20,638 --> 00:34:22,265
Give us some!

739

- Hey! That's mine!
- Share this with us!

740
00:34:24,892 --> 00:34:26,686
- Give us some too!
- Take it here!

[Section E boys clamoring]

742
00:34:32,441 --> 00:34:33,442
It's all your fault!

743
00:34:36,404 --> 00:34:37,572
Class.

744
00:34:39,282 --> 00:34:40,575
Settle down.

745
00:34:41,617 --> 00:34:42,743
Go back to your seats.

746
00:34:43,536 --> 00:34:45,037
Let's talk about the festival.

747
00:34:47,248 --> 00:34:50,334
Aren't we far ahead of time?
Why are we discussing it this early?

748
00:34:50,668 --> 00:34:52,294
There is a chance that
it will be held earlier.

749
00:34:52,295 --> 00:34:54,422
So, it's better to discuss it
as early as possible.

750
00:34:55,798 --> 00:34:57,592
Yuri, what's with that festival?

751
00:34:59,135 --> 00:35:02,722
David. Will you please explain
to Jay-jay what the festival is?

752
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:03,931
Yes, sir.

753
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:07,560
So, the school festival.
It's a week-long celebration.

754
00:35:08,144 --> 00:35:12,648
There's a sports fest,
food stalls, booths, and a program.

755
00:35:13,357 --> 00:35:16,527
Whatever happens depends
on the rules of the school.

756
00:35:17,278 --> 00:35:18,195
There are rules?

757
00:35:18,196 --> 00:35:21,824
The number of booths depends
on the number of section representatives.

758
00:35:21,991 --> 00:35:24,535
As for the program, as usual,
it's going to be a pageant.

759
00:35:24,744 --> 00:35:26,077
Another pageant?

760
00:35:26,078 --> 00:35:27,830
Freya's gonna win again.

761
00:35:28,789 --> 00:35:32,043
When it comes to tasks,
A is in charge of the program.

762
00:35:32,251 --> 00:35:33,502
B for sports.

763
00:35:33,669 --> 00:35:34,711
C for booths.

764
00:35:34,712 --> 00:35:36,838
And D is tasked with security.

765
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:38,382
And your section is night duty.

766
00:35:38,841 --> 00:35:40,509
What do you mean by "night duty?"

767
00:35:40,843 --> 00:35:42,595
The festival runs for a whole week.

768
00:35:42,845 --> 00:35:44,722
Security is also needed at night.

769
00:35:45,056 --> 00:35:46,515
To watch the equipment.

770
00:35:47,183 --> 00:35:49,225

You know the rules.

779
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:08,203
You won't be allowed at the
festival if you don't do it.

780
00:36:08,204 --> 00:36:09,497
That's the old rule.

I'm the class president now,
so it's going to change.

782
00:36:13,542 --> 00:36:15,336
Then what are you suggesting?

783
00:36:15,503 --> 00:36:16,879
We don't do any task.

784
00:36:17,254 --> 00:36:19,131
But then, you won't be
allowed to the festival.

785
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,883
That's too much.

910
00:41:17,888 --> 00:41:20,307
He's our classmate,
but he's been skipping school.

911
00:41:21,725 --> 00:41:23,285
Where is he? Why is he
skipping classes?

912
00:41:23,894 --> 00:41:24,937
He's at their restaurant.

913
00:41:25,312 --> 00:41:26,312
I heard…

914
00:41:26,438 --> 00:41:28,899
I heard that their business is failing,
so he has to work.

915
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,318
Why him? Where are his parents?

916
00:41:31,902 --> 00:41:32,902
God,

917
00:41:33,112 --> 00:41:34,912
his mother is a
good-for-nothing spendthrift.

918
00:41:34,947 --> 00:41:36,615
His father got into an accident.

919
00:41:36,991 --> 00:41:38,659
Burned his arm while cooking.

920
00:41:39,076 --> 00:41:40,119
That's unfortunate.

921
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:42,620
Shall we visit him?

922
00:41:42,746 --> 00:41:43,497
Tss!

923
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:44,580
You're meddling again.

924
00:41:45,165 --> 00:41:46,500
Sure. I'll come with you later.

925
00:41:46,792 --> 00:41:47,792
Me too.

926
00:41:47,835 --> 00:41:48,835
Okay, I'll go too.

927
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,462
Let's go as well, baby.

928
00:41:50,629 --> 00:41:51,629
Mmhm.

929
00:42:05,853 --> 00:42:06,854
Are we here?

930
00:42:09,148 --> 00:42:10,649
Does Eman's family really own this?

931
00:42:11,025 --> 00:42:12,109
So cool.

932
00:42:12,443 --> 00:42:14,695
Have you been here?
Looks like their food's delicious.

933
00:42:16,322 --> 00:42:17,656
I wonder what their specialty is.

934
00:42:21,785 --> 00:42:24,038
See? You can't say no to us.

935
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:27,057
- Five more minutes, sir.
- Are you serious?

936
00:42:27,082 --> 00:42:29,043
I'm really sorry. Wait just a moment.

937
00:42:30,461 --> 00:42:31,461
Welcome.

938
00:42:32,046 --> 00:42:33,775
Good morning. Are you open?

939
00:42:34,173 --> 00:42:35,941
Yes. Table for how many?

940
00:42:35,966 --> 00:42:36,966
He's asking us.

941
00:42:37,843 --> 00:42:39,423
We're not here to eat. Remember?

942
00:42:40,971 --> 00:42:41,972
Is Eman here?

943
00:42:42,473 --> 00:42:44,473
He's in the kitchen.
Do you need anything from him?

944
00:42:44,683 --> 00:42:46,477
Tell him Section E is here.

945
00:42:46,727 --> 00:42:48,854
Tell him to come out
and don't keep us waiting.

946
00:42:49,146 --> 00:42:50,146
Please.

947
00:42:54,485 --> 00:42:55,485
I'll handle this.

948
00:42:55,694 --> 00:42:56,694
Alright.

949
00:42:57,946 --> 00:42:58,946
What do you need?

950
00:42:59,281 --> 00:43:00,601
We want to know how you're doing.

951
00:43:00,691 --> 00:43:02,109
Then you can feed us after.

952
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:04,553
Is that really why you're here?

953
00:43:04,661 --> 00:43:08,122
No. I want to ask permission
to use your things back at school.

954
00:43:08,123 --> 00:43:09,569
Maybe we can borrow them.

955
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Use them.

956
00:43:11,126 --> 00:43:12,127
Do what you want.

957
00:43:12,595 --> 00:43:14,938
I'm gonna quit school
so… you can have those.

958
00:43:15,714 --> 00:43:16,714
Is that true?

959
00:43:17,007 --> 00:43:18,312
You're really gonna quit?

960
00:43:18,717 --> 00:43:20,039
You see my situation here.

961
00:43:20,719 --> 00:43:22,599
I'm needed at the restaurant.

962
00:43:23,347 --> 00:43:24,869
Only three of us are left here.

963
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:26,855
Are you managing the restaurant?

964
00:43:28,435 --> 00:43:30,105
Your dad was the chef here, right?

965
00:43:30,729 --> 00:43:31,729
Who's cooking?

966
00:43:32,064 --> 00:43:32,826
Now?

967
00:43:33,023 --> 00:43:33,706
It's me.

968
00:43:33,941 --> 00:43:34,941
What's taking so long?!

969
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,400
I apologize, sir.

970
00:43:37,027 --> 00:43:39,107
I have to go back to the
kitchen. We have customers.

971
00:43:39,363 --> 00:43:40,363
Hey, Eman!

972
00:43:41,782 --> 00:43:43,158
We're not done talking to you.

973
00:43:44,034 --> 00:43:45,034
Please.

974
00:43:45,327 --> 00:43:46,327
I have work to do.

975
00:43:46,662 --> 00:43:47,662
So, what's your plan?

976
00:43:48,455 --> 00:43:49,455
Right now?

977
00:43:49,581 --> 00:43:50,582
Go back to work.

978
00:43:53,127 --> 00:43:57,548
Ma'am, sir. Please take a seat and wait.
We apologize.

979
00:44:01,301 --> 00:44:02,302
What are you doing?

980
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:04,720
Here's our menu.

981
00:44:05,097 --> 00:44:06,097
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

982
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:07,890
We're gonna help here.

983
00:44:07,933 --> 00:44:08,933
What?

984
00:44:10,811 --> 00:44:13,290
We're gonna help until
your restaurant recovers.

985
00:44:13,355 --> 00:44:14,522
Until you're able to hire more crew.

986
00:44:14,523 --> 00:44:16,191
And who's "we"?

987
00:44:17,484 --> 00:44:18,484
Calix and I will help.

988
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:21,455
And me. I'll help out too.

989
00:44:21,822 --> 00:44:22,823
Alright, me too.

990
00:44:23,532 --> 00:44:25,242
We can do shifting amongst ourselves.

991
00:44:26,285 --> 00:44:27,786
Yeah, and then just pay us with food.

992
00:44:29,538 --> 00:44:31,582
It's obvious I can't stop you.

993
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,169
Brother… please guide them.

994
00:44:35,794 --> 00:44:37,674
Make sure they're not
gonna cause any problems.

995
00:44:38,881 --> 00:44:40,465
Bro, I'll handle that.

996
00:44:42,676 --> 00:44:43,177
Tss.

997
00:44:43,427 --> 00:44:45,429
Miss Meddler strikes again.

998
00:44:45,721 --> 00:44:47,264
Ma'am, sir. Here's your order.

999
00:44:49,016 --> 00:44:50,016
Oh, thank you.

1000
00:44:50,058 --> 00:44:51,101
Are you ready to order?

1001
00:44:51,435 --> 00:44:52,685
Baby, there's a customer.

1002
00:44:52,686 --> 00:44:54,353
We have all meat pizza…

1003
00:44:54,354 --> 00:44:55,647
standard pizza...

1004
00:44:57,149 --> 00:44:58,192
Do you have extra aprons?

1005
00:44:58,497 --> 00:44:59,843
Ma'am, What's your order?

1006
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,445
Do you want to try this?

1007
00:45:01,486 --> 00:45:02,486
Calix.

1008
00:45:03,322 --> 00:45:05,616
You're gonna try everything?
Here's our bestseller.

1009
00:45:05,639 --> 00:45:06,593
That soup.

1010
00:45:06,617 --> 00:45:10,037
For drinks, we have juices,
hot drinks, soft drinks…

1011
00:45:11,278 --> 00:45:11,955
Everything.

1012
00:45:12,206 --> 00:45:13,206
Everything?

1013
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:15,375
I'll tell the rest of the class myself.

1014
00:45:16,919 --> 00:45:18,855
- Oh, alright.
- Have you dined here before, Miss?

1015
00:45:18,879 --> 00:45:19,879
You know our menu!

1016
00:45:26,637 --> 00:45:28,304
- Here's your order, Sir.
- Thank you.

1017
00:45:28,305 --> 00:45:29,264

- Yeah.

Look at Yuri.

1056
00:46:49,886 --> 00:46:51,054
Do what he's doing.

1057
00:46:53,682 --> 00:46:54,366
Just stay here, okay?

1058
00:46:54,391 --> 00:46:56,685
Okay, we're really not going anywhere.

00:49:29,588 --> 00:49:31,339
Because of my meddling,

1094
00:49:33,258 --> 00:49:38,054
we were able to help Eman and his family.

1095
00:49:44,728 --> 00:49:47,939
I hope they all stay like this.

1096
00:49:56,156 --> 00:49:57,282
Oh! Hey!

1097
00:49:58,617 --> 00:49:59,617
Ouch!

1098
00:49:59,743 --> 00:50:01,328
Ci! Ci! Wipe the floor, please.

1099
00:50:02,178 --> 00:50:02,929
What happened?

1100
00:50:03,007 --> 00:50:03,800
Go sit over here.

1101
00:50:03,954 --> 00:50:04,954
Just sit down.

1102
00:50:05,123 --> 00:50:06,670
Put it down. Sit over here.

1103
00:50:07,417 --> 00:50:08,417
Go on, sit.

1104
00:50:08,752 --> 00:50:10,504
Eman, do you have a first aid kit?

1105
00:50:16,443 --> 00:50:17,772
Thank you.

1106
00:50:18,426 --> 00:50:19,426
Let me see it.

1107
00:50:27,228 --> 00:50:28,229
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1108
00:50:31,942 --> 00:50:33,527
You know this is your fault, right?

1109
00:50:34,778 --> 00:50:35,779
Okay, already.

1110
00:50:36,071 --> 00:50:37,906
I'm treating your wound now, right?

1111
00:50:38,657 --> 00:50:40,158
Why do you have to meddle in things?

1112
00:50:40,951 --> 00:50:42,271
Why don't you just let things be?

1113
00:50:43,745 --> 00:50:44,745
Give it to me.

1114
00:51:07,602 --> 00:51:08,645
What's the reason?

1115
00:51:10,313 --> 00:51:11,313
Huh?

1116
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,360
Why can't stay away from
other people's problems?

1117
00:51:18,863 --> 00:51:19,863
Sorry, sorry.

1118
00:51:23,827 --> 00:51:25,078
I just can't help it.

1119
00:51:29,708 --> 00:51:30,917
I can't just do nothing...

1120
00:51:32,627 --> 00:51:34,421
when I know things can change.

1121
00:51:36,523 --> 00:51:37,799
But nobody even tries.

1122
00:51:38,258 --> 00:51:39,426
Nobody believes.

1123
00:51:41,845 --> 00:51:44,085
If things can get better, why
not do something about it?

1124
00:51:47,559 --> 00:51:49,102
You know you can't change everyone.

1125
00:51:49,936 --> 00:51:50,936
It's okay.

1126
00:51:52,188 --> 00:51:53,188
At least I tried.

1127
00:51:56,693 --> 00:51:57,693
Hmm.

1128
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,487
We're even now.

1129
00:52:16,691 --> 00:52:17,691
Thank you.

1130
00:53:56,229 --> 00:53:57,772
OMG.

1131
00:53:58,523 --> 00:54:01,233
So it's true. You're also
a waitress now.

1132
00:54:01,234 --> 00:54:03,074
Keifer Watson. Is your family
getting poor now?

1133
00:54:03,236 --> 00:54:04,778
How did Aries know we're here?

1134
00:54:04,779 --> 00:54:06,071
Will they cause a scene here?

1135
00:54:06,072 --> 00:54:07,574
Why would Kiko suddenly court you?!

1136
00:54:07,824 --> 00:54:08,949
And you're letting him?!

1137
00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:09,743
The thing is…

1138
00:54:09,743 --> 00:54:10,368
You like him.

1139
00:54:10,702 --> 00:54:12,996
No. I'm not letting
him court me.

1140
00:54:13,121 --> 00:54:15,414
You were smitten by his
American accent and sweet smiles.

1141
00:54:15,415 --> 00:54:16,040
That's not true.

1142
00:54:16,041 --> 00:54:17,332
You don't like English-speaking guys?

1143
00:54:17,333 --> 00:54:18,001
No.

1144
00:54:18,001 --> 00:54:19,001
How about Keifer?

1145
00:54:19,294 --> 00:54:20,128
[Ci-N teasing Jay-jay]

1146
00:54:20,129 --> 00:54:21,129
Will you stop that?!

1147
00:54:21,296 --> 00:54:22,376
Do you really like Jay-jay?

1148
00:54:22,756 --> 00:54:24,673
Jay-jay is not allowed
to have a boyfriend.

1149
00:54:24,674 --> 00:54:25,799
What is wrong with you?

1150
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:26,634
You know me.

1151
00:54:26,634 --> 00:54:27,343
Exactly.

1152
00:54:27,344 --> 00:54:28,385
- Hey!
- [ Jay-jay gets startled]

1153
00:54:28,386 --> 00:54:29,137
What are you doing here?

1154
00:54:29,304 --> 00:54:29,846
Get in.

1155
00:54:30,263 --> 00:54:31,305
Why do you need to fetch me?

1156
00:54:31,306 --> 00:54:32,348
You want some?

1157
00:54:33,141 --> 00:54:34,142
I know you do.

1158
00:54:39,063 --> 00:54:40,543
There's something
different about you.

1159
00:54:41,024 --> 00:54:42,025
Are you wearing contacts?

1160
00:54:43,693 --> 00:54:45,277
Oh no… what happened to you?

1161
00:54:45,278 --> 00:54:46,129
Fuck them!

1162
00:54:46,154 --> 00:54:48,131
We should retaliate.
Who's with me?

1163
00:54:48,156 --> 00:54:49,740
You can't come, Jay.

1164
00:54:49,741 --> 00:54:50,909
And why not?

1165
00:54:50,992 --> 00:54:52,493
Because you're gonna
fight again, don't you?

1166
00:54:52,494 --> 00:54:54,579
You're putting yourselves
in danger because of me.
