Bok, bok, bok... Bok!

2
00:00:17,145 --> 00:00:18,645
Stop. Playing while walking?

3
00:00:18,646 --> 00:00:19,646
Why do you care?

4
00:00:20,064 --> 00:00:21,107
Ah!

5
00:00:25,195 --> 00:00:27,237
I'm begging you, Jay.

6
00:00:27,238 --> 00:00:27,822
Why?

7
00:00:27,823 --> 00:00:29,991
Don't worry. I won't tell Aries a thing.

8
00:00:30,283 --> 00:00:31,409
It's not that.

9
00:00:31,743 --> 00:00:32,911
Is it Calix?

10
00:00:33,286 --> 00:00:33,703
Mica?

11
00:00:33,703 --> 00:00:34,662
Uh-uh-uh!

12
00:00:34,663 --> 00:00:36,580
Move back! Move back!

13
00:00:36,581 --> 00:00:37,581
What is she doing here?

14
00:00:37,582 --> 00:00:39,250
We can't meddle in their mess.

15
00:00:39,459 --> 00:00:41,211
Mica... I know I caused you a lot of pain.

16
00:00:41,461 --> 00:00:44,254
But I hope you can give me
a chance to talk to you.

17
00:00:44,255 --> 00:00:47,966
- I love you very much, Mica!
- Hey, will you stop it?

18
00:00:47,967 --> 00:00:48,593
So corny.

19
00:00:48,594 --> 00:00:49,885
You might experience a love just like that.

20
00:00:49,886 --> 00:00:51,763
Maybe... with you.

21
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,515
That would be horrible.

22
00:00:53,932 --> 00:00:54,932
Move, out of the way!

[Jay-jay screams]

24
00:01:01,523 --> 00:01:03,023
What is wrong with you?

25
00:01:03,024 --> 00:01:04,024
It was your fault!

26
00:01:04,025 --> 00:01:07,153
You crazy woman!

27
00:01:07,278 --> 00:01:08,988
Jay, run!

28
00:01:10,698 --> 00:01:11,740
What the hell?

29
00:01:11,741 --> 00:01:13,367
It's none of your business!
She belongs to Section E!

30
00:01:13,368 --> 00:01:14,536
- No!
- Ouch!

31
00:01:16,955 --> 00:01:18,289
Fuck!

33
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:21,333
What are you gonna do?

34
00:01:21,793 --> 00:01:23,085
Damn, dude. You made me scream!

35
00:01:23,086 --> 00:01:24,295
I just got some ice.

36
00:01:27,048 --> 00:01:28,131
You're easily startled now?

37
00:01:28,132 --> 00:01:29,132
Hell no.

38
00:01:30,552 --> 00:01:33,346
I just actually didn't expect Jay-jay's
punch to be that quick.

39
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,181
Why did you kiss her?

40
00:01:39,018 --> 00:01:39,936
[Aries]
I'm concerned!

41
00:01:39,937 --> 00:01:41,562
What's wrong with you two? Let go!

42
00:01:41,563 --> 00:01:43,415
It's none of your business!
She belongs to Section E!

43
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,440
- No!
- Aw!

44
00:01:50,488 --> 00:01:52,141
They kissed for real, dude!

[boys reacting]

48
00:02:04,627 --> 00:02:06,227
This is what we talked about, remember?

49
00:02:06,504 --> 00:02:07,504
That you would kiss her?

50
00:02:08,089 --> 00:02:08,773
Right away?

51
00:02:08,798 --> 00:02:10,049
This is part of the plan.

52
00:02:10,466 --> 00:02:11,384
To make her...

53
00:02:11,467 --> 00:02:12,467
fall for me.

54
00:02:12,594 --> 00:02:13,428
Then break her.

55
00:02:13,648 --> 00:02:15,488
You think all of this
will still affect Aries?

56
00:02:15,513 --> 00:02:16,764
I don't see how it's not.

57
00:02:16,931 --> 00:02:18,516
We talked about this, didn't we?

58
00:02:18,683 --> 00:02:19,726
We stick to the plan.

59
00:02:19,809 --> 00:02:21,518
No backing out now.
This is progress.

60
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:22,437
Progress?

61
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,960
You already got punched in the face.

62
00:02:24,105 --> 00:02:25,732
You think Jay-jay's gonna fall for this?

63
00:02:25,982 --> 00:02:26,983
Is that a dare?

64
00:02:28,401 --> 00:02:31,571
Uh… hello, guys?
Aren't we going home yet?

65
00:02:31,946 --> 00:02:33,508
I'm getting hungry.

66
00:02:34,115 --> 00:02:35,742
You're always hungry, aren't you?

67
00:02:36,784 --> 00:02:38,453
You're skinny but you eat a lot.

68
00:02:38,578 --> 00:02:39,579
Just treat us then.

69
00:02:39,871 --> 00:02:40,580
Yeah, that's right.

70
00:02:40,581 --> 00:02:43,821
- You're the one who wants to eat after all.
- Cut it out. You're all bullying me.

71
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,254
I don't feel so great.

72
00:04:12,171 --> 00:04:15,007
I slept too late because
of all the studying I did.

73
00:04:18,678 --> 00:04:19,971
[Jay-jay gasps]

74
00:04:22,932 --> 00:04:24,308
But the truth is…

75
00:04:25,476 --> 00:04:28,563
I stayed up all night thinking
about what Keifer did.

76
00:04:30,356 --> 00:04:32,650
Until now, my head gets messed up about it.

77
00:04:39,532 --> 00:04:40,950
Damn it!

78
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:44,036
But…

79
00:04:44,579 --> 00:04:45,579
It felt good?

80
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,956
Yeah.

81
00:04:46,957 --> 00:04:48,874
No! Never! My goodness!

82
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,460
What the hell is wrong with my brain?

83
00:04:50,835 --> 00:04:52,086
Are you okay, Jay?

84
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:53,879
Huh?

85
00:04:54,046 --> 00:04:55,046
Me?

86
00:04:55,757 --> 00:04:57,175
Of course, I'm okay.

87
00:04:57,467 --> 00:04:58,968
I didn't think much of it.

88
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,137
That kiss was nothing to me.

89
00:05:01,971 --> 00:05:03,055
Really?

90
00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:05,099
What I mean is you look sick.

91
00:05:08,227 --> 00:05:09,353
See? You're feverish.

92
00:05:09,562 --> 00:05:10,688
Did you take any medicine?

93
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:16,986
Blame it on the pitcher of iced tea
I drank last night while reviewing.

94
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,280
Oh…

95
00:05:20,323 --> 00:05:21,364
Maybe you just need…

96
00:05:21,365 --> 00:05:22,365
a kiss.

97
00:05:22,408 --> 00:05:23,719
Or a hug to make you feel better.

98
00:05:23,743 --> 00:05:24,952
Let's go to Section E.

99
00:05:25,203 --> 00:05:27,288
Asshole. What I need is a good
splash to my face.

100
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:28,830
See you.

Hey…

106
00:05:48,935 --> 00:05:49,935
Are you alright?

107
00:05:50,102 --> 00:05:51,354
You're so pale.

108
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,024
Oh no. You're burning up.
Have you been to the clinic?

109
00:05:55,483 --> 00:05:58,027
Maybe later.
We have exams today.

110
00:05:58,861 --> 00:06:01,489
I hope it gets better later,
so I wouldn't need to go.

111
00:06:01,739 --> 00:06:03,019
But did you take any medication?

112
00:06:03,491 --> 00:06:04,491
Mm.

113
00:06:07,119 --> 00:06:08,119
Why?

114
00:06:08,329 --> 00:06:09,729
Is there something you want to say?

116
00:06:11,707 --> 00:06:12,708
The thing is…

117
00:06:14,335 --> 00:06:16,211
I've been meaning to
talk to you for a while,

118
00:06:16,212 --> 00:06:18,256
but I got busy with tennis practice.

119
00:06:18,798 --> 00:06:19,757
But when…

120
00:06:19,758 --> 00:06:21,467
you and Freya got in a fight…

121
00:06:21,926 --> 00:06:22,969
How were you?

122
00:06:24,887 --> 00:06:26,096
Not really great.

123
00:06:26,097 --> 00:06:27,097
I knew it.

124
00:06:27,473 --> 00:06:28,516
I know Freya.

125
00:06:28,891 --> 00:06:30,893
She's gonna get back at you
in many different ways.

126
00:06:31,435 --> 00:06:35,064
As long as she's not satisfied yet,
she'll keep doing it over and over.

127
00:06:35,314 --> 00:06:36,774
She's already done that to me.

128
00:06:37,191 --> 00:06:40,778
All along I thought we were fine.
But I was wrong.

129
00:06:41,028 --> 00:06:42,655
She even involved other people.

130
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,198
She dragged Ci-N into the mess.

131
00:06:44,657 --> 00:06:46,617
Freya got Ci-N into Section E,

132
00:06:46,951 --> 00:06:48,411
just to get back at me.

133
00:06:49,078 --> 00:06:50,078
Ci-N?

134
00:06:50,913 --> 00:06:51,497
Yeah.

135
00:06:51,581 --> 00:06:52,498
And get this.

136
00:06:52,499 --> 00:06:54,208
Aries didn't even lift a finger.

137
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:56,710
Of course! Because there's something
between him and Freya.

138
00:06:56,711 --> 00:06:57,545
I caught them.

139
00:06:57,587 --> 00:06:58,587
Something?

140
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,590
Aren't he and Ella together?

141
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:04,844
Umm…

142
00:07:05,052 --> 00:07:07,388
I actually have to go. Sorry…

143
00:07:09,473 --> 00:07:10,808
Please, tell me.

144
00:07:12,602 --> 00:07:14,185
- This stays between us, okay?
- Yes.

145
00:07:14,186 --> 00:07:15,813
No one must know it came from me.

146
00:07:15,938 --> 00:07:17,148
- Promise.
- Okay.

147
00:07:18,524 --> 00:07:20,568
Ella wasn't in Section A yet at that time.

148
00:07:21,611 --> 00:07:24,070
I caught them kissing at Mykel's party.

149
00:07:24,071 --> 00:07:25,071
Kissing?

150
00:07:25,573 --> 00:07:26,282
Freya and Aries?

151
00:07:26,282 --> 00:07:27,282
Yeah.

152
00:07:27,533 --> 00:07:30,335
And I think, Freya
is just using that as

153
00:07:30,359 --> 00:07:33,956
leverage against Aries
to get whatever she wants.

154
00:07:34,165 --> 00:07:36,045
Because there's something
going on between them.

155
00:07:36,584 --> 00:07:37,584
Wait a minute…

156
00:07:37,877 --> 00:07:41,047
Wait. Can we — talk about
that thing you said earlier?

157
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:45,009
What do you mean Freya's the reason
why Ci-N is in Section E?

158
00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:45,885
Wait.

159
00:07:46,218 --> 00:07:48,095
So, Ci-N haven't told you about it?

160
00:07:48,721 --> 00:07:49,889
Here's what happened.

161
00:07:50,389 --> 00:07:52,433
When we were in second year high school,

162
00:07:52,683 --> 00:07:53,559
Ci-N kissed me.

163
00:07:53,684 --> 00:07:54,684
That I did know.

164
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:55,810
Huh.

165
00:07:56,812 --> 00:07:59,796
And Freya got mad because…

166
00:07:59,971 --> 00:08:03,152
Apparently, she likes Ci-N too.

167
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:06,697
So, we got into a fight and
she made stories about Ci-N.

168
00:08:07,031 --> 00:08:09,992
After that, everyone accused
Ci-N of being a thief.

169
00:08:10,326 --> 00:08:11,898
That sounds impossible.

170
00:08:12,161 --> 00:08:14,662
Ci-N, a thief? He's too childish for that.

171
00:08:14,997 --> 00:08:16,165
Hey, he's not childish.

172
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:17,917
[teasing]

173
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:20,710
Anyway…

174
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:24,507
Freya was the one behind it all.
Everyone knows that.

175
00:08:24,966 --> 00:08:28,552
But of course, it ruined Ci-N's reputation.

176
00:08:32,181 --> 00:08:33,349
It's exam time.

179
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,527
Yeah, I'm all good.

- Just look at it on your own!
- Come on.

365
00:18:35,617 --> 00:18:36,617
Come on.

366
00:18:43,417 --> 00:18:44,417
Huh?

367
00:18:52,467 --> 00:18:53,885
Am I still sick?

368
00:19:04,104 --> 00:19:05,147
Woah.

369
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:10,277
99.9? What is he, a germ-killing alcohol?
Didn't know he's smart.

370
00:19:19,828 --> 00:19:21,413
Here's another germ-killing grade.

371
00:19:21,622 --> 00:19:24,791
So smart! How did they
get grades like these?

372
00:19:32,382 --> 00:19:34,384
I need to talk to this kid.

373
00:19:34,718 --> 00:19:36,678
It's as if he didn't even
make an effort to pass.

374
00:20:05,624 --> 00:20:06,624
Oh.

375
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,503
Your fashion style's cool. It suits you.

376
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,920
This isn't mine.

377
00:20:11,171 --> 00:20:12,714
Someone handed it to me earlier.

378
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:13,882
Earlier?

379
00:20:14,174 --> 00:20:14,800
Yeah.

380
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:15,676
I was weirded out.

381
00:20:15,842 --> 00:20:16,842
Hey!

382
00:20:16,927 --> 00:20:17,927
That's my bag!

383
00:20:18,887 --> 00:20:19,513
Huh?

384
00:20:19,721 --> 00:20:21,848
You gave it to me. Didn't say it's mine.

385
00:20:22,516 --> 00:20:23,516
Gave it?

386
00:20:24,851 --> 00:20:25,644
What's up with that?

387
00:20:25,852 --> 00:20:26,852
So weird.

388
00:20:28,313 --> 00:20:28,897
Come.

389
00:20:29,106 --> 00:20:29,898
I'm hungry.

390
00:20:29,899 --> 00:20:32,984
Come with me to Miss
Lylia to buy food. Let's go.

391
00:20:33,735 --> 00:20:34,444
Is that him?

392
00:20:34,445 --> 00:20:35,570
Yeah, that's him.

393
00:20:35,904 --> 00:20:37,239
He stole it!

394
00:20:37,948 --> 00:20:38,948
Kid…

395
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,368
Where's my girlfriend's money?

396
00:20:41,785 --> 00:20:43,345
I don't know what you're talking about.

397
00:20:43,578 --> 00:20:44,246
You don't know?

398
00:20:44,247 --> 00:20:46,122
Hey, hey, hey! Let go of Ci-N!

399
00:20:46,123 --> 00:20:47,416
Don't butt in!

400
00:20:47,582 --> 00:20:49,500
That guy stole my money!

401
00:20:49,501 --> 00:20:51,168
Are you sure? You have proof?

402
00:20:51,169 --> 00:20:52,586
He's the only one who touched it!

403
00:20:52,587 --> 00:20:53,880
You were there!

404
00:20:54,047 --> 00:20:56,800
Yeah, but you gave your bag to him!

405
00:20:57,092 --> 00:20:58,218
Liar!

406
00:20:58,385 --> 00:21:01,011
Don't call me a liar!
Ci-N didn't even move an inch.

407
00:21:01,012 --> 00:21:02,221
How could he steal it?

408
00:21:02,222 --> 00:21:02,973
I don't care!

409
00:21:02,974 --> 00:21:05,767
Did you see him take your bag and run?

410
00:21:05,934 --> 00:21:09,061
He got my bag and he took my money!

411
00:21:09,062 --> 00:21:10,521
What if I punch you in the mouth?

412
00:21:10,522 --> 00:21:11,522
Go ahead!

413
00:21:11,523 --> 00:21:13,065
- I will really do it!
- Jay-jay, just let them be!

414
00:21:13,066 --> 00:21:13,817
Let go of me!

415
00:21:13,818 --> 00:21:15,736
This one deserves a beating! Bitch!

416
00:21:15,819 --> 00:21:17,038
What's happening here?

417
00:21:17,195 --> 00:21:19,812
This guy stole the money in my bag!

418
00:21:19,837 --> 00:21:20,379
Yuri…

419
00:21:20,491 --> 00:21:23,200
Lies! He didn't steal anything!

420
00:21:23,201 --> 00:21:25,620
- Why, did you see him?
- How about you?

421
00:21:25,871 --> 00:21:27,621
Oh my…

422
00:21:27,622 --> 00:21:30,709
Ci-N. You did it again?

423
00:21:31,418 --> 00:21:32,669
I didn't do anything.

424
00:21:33,628 --> 00:21:36,630
You were a proven thief,
back when you were still in our section.

425
00:21:36,631 --> 00:21:38,175
You did it again?

426
00:21:39,634 --> 00:21:42,189
So, you're really a thief, huh?

427
00:21:42,214 --> 00:21:44,174
One more word and I'll destroy your face!

428
00:21:44,389 --> 00:21:44,931
What?

429
00:21:45,015 --> 00:21:46,015
Ci-N.

430
00:21:46,099 --> 00:21:47,099
Is this true?

431
00:21:47,893 --> 00:21:48,685
It's not.

432
00:21:48,686 --> 00:21:49,770
Bullshit.

433
00:21:50,061 --> 00:21:52,992
Ci-N didn't steal anything
and he doesn't need to.

434
00:21:53,106 --> 00:21:54,774
He's the only one who touched my bag.

435
00:21:54,775 --> 00:21:56,150
There was money inside it.

436
00:21:56,151 --> 00:21:58,527
Only my boyfriend and I know about it.

437
00:21:58,528 --> 00:21:59,987
Then maybe your boyfriend stole it?

438
00:21:59,988 --> 00:22:00,781
Fuck you!

439
00:22:00,781 --> 00:22:01,573
Fuck you!

440
00:22:01,574 --> 00:22:02,574
Impossible.

441
00:22:02,575 --> 00:22:04,867
He stole it for sure. He's the one!

442
00:22:04,868 --> 00:22:07,912
You know, I'm getting really pissed at you.
Let me punch you just one time.

443
00:22:07,913 --> 00:22:08,913
Jay…

444
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,040
You instigated this, didn't you?

445
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:12,249
Are you accusing me?

446
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:15,337
Wait, wait. This is getting nowhere.

447
00:22:15,712 --> 00:22:17,072
How much money did you lose, miss?

448
00:22:18,673 --> 00:22:19,716
Twenty thousand.

449
00:22:24,888 --> 00:22:26,056
Inform Keifer.

450
00:22:28,099 --> 00:22:32,062
Twenty five thousand. I added a bit more.
For the inconvenience.

451
00:22:32,604 --> 00:22:33,939
Let's go, babe.

452
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,191
Why are you meddling?

453
00:22:36,858 --> 00:22:37,858
And you.

454
00:22:38,109 --> 00:22:40,987
If you need money, just ask your mother.

455
00:22:43,031 --> 00:22:44,240
Don't steal.

456
00:22:44,241 --> 00:22:46,200
- You asshole! Who do you think you are?
- Jay, stop it!

457
00:22:46,201 --> 00:22:47,493
- What the hell?
- Let's go!

458
00:22:47,494 --> 00:22:48,536
Let me go, Yuri!

459
00:22:48,537 --> 00:22:50,579
Put me back! I'm so pissed!

460
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,749
Yuri! What the hell?

461
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:55,794
What's wrong with you, Yuri?
I just want to punch him!

462
00:22:56,127 --> 00:22:57,294
Yuri!

463
00:22:57,295 --> 00:22:58,505
Stop!

464
00:22:58,713 --> 00:22:59,713
Hey!

465
00:23:00,215 --> 00:23:02,883
They were saying Ci-N stole something.
Jay-jay defended him.

466
00:23:02,884 --> 00:23:05,011
- I'm going to hurt that bitch!
- They're here.

467
00:23:05,262 --> 00:23:06,263
Stop!

468
00:23:07,138 --> 00:23:08,849
- Move!
- Jay-jay, will you please stop?

469
00:23:11,893 --> 00:23:13,395
Why didn't you tell me?

470
00:23:13,562 --> 00:23:15,856
He has nothing to say.
He didn't steal anything.

471
00:23:16,273 --> 00:23:19,734
You know Rakki already told me
about this stealing incident of yours.

472
00:23:19,985 --> 00:23:23,697
- But I shrugged it off, thinking it wasn't a big deal!
- Jay!

473
00:23:23,905 --> 00:23:27,200
- You should've told me! I could've helped you!
- Jay!

474
00:23:28,034 --> 00:23:32,539
I thought you trusted me! Aren't we ST?

475
00:23:35,917 --> 00:23:36,917
Because…

476
00:23:38,795 --> 00:23:41,006
I'm scared you'll look at me differently.

477
00:23:43,508 --> 00:23:44,801
It's like that, isn't it?

478
00:23:48,138 --> 00:23:50,140
Your first impression of a person…

479
00:23:51,057 --> 00:23:52,434
It's hard to change.

480
00:23:58,607 --> 00:24:03,278
Don't you realize that keeping
the truth from me is much worse?

481
00:24:05,822 --> 00:24:08,532
It's as if you're proving
that what they're saying is true!

482
00:24:08,533 --> 00:24:09,951
Jay-jay!

483
00:24:23,715 --> 00:24:24,758
Sorry…

484
00:24:25,383 --> 00:24:26,376
Sorry, sorry.

485
00:24:26,401 --> 00:24:28,598
I didn't mean mean what I said.

486
00:24:30,889 --> 00:24:34,976
Maybe I'm just mad at myself because
I wasn't able to help you.

487
00:24:36,937 --> 00:24:41,024
Because I know how it feels to be judged.

488
00:24:43,485 --> 00:24:44,903
It's alright, just cry it out.

489
00:24:46,947 --> 00:24:47,989
I'm here.

490
00:24:48,782 --> 00:24:49,782
We're here.

491
00:24:51,201 --> 00:24:52,494
We're all here for you.

492
00:24:55,622 --> 00:24:57,290
I didn't steal anything.

493
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:00,543
Please believe me.

494
00:25:00,794 --> 00:25:02,629
I believe you.

495
00:25:03,129 --> 00:25:05,799
I know you can't do something like that.

496
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,225
Sorry…

497
00:25:20,939 --> 00:25:22,524
It would be best if you take Ci home.

498
00:25:32,742 --> 00:25:34,244
Don't put your head down.

499
00:25:36,287 --> 00:25:38,607
You didn't do anything wrong.
You don't have to be ashamed.

500
00:26:04,274 --> 00:26:04,816
Jay…

501
00:26:04,941 --> 00:26:05,442
Oh?

502
00:26:05,608 --> 00:26:07,402
Don't tell my mom what happened earlier.

503
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:08,318
Huh?

504
00:26:08,403 --> 00:26:10,071
Of course. We're not that close.

505
00:26:11,781 --> 00:26:12,365
No,

506
00:26:12,532 --> 00:26:14,116
Absolutely not.

507
00:26:14,117 --> 00:26:16,202
It would trigger a hemolytic reaction.

508
00:26:17,203 --> 00:26:18,203
That's your mom?

509
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:19,664
She's beautiful!

510
00:26:19,789 --> 00:26:22,125
Of course she's pregnant.
It's too dangerous.

511
00:26:23,209 --> 00:26:24,209
You look alike.

512
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:29,548
Monitor her hemoglobin
and haptoglobin levels closely.

513
00:26:29,549 --> 00:26:31,468
- Hemoglobin? What did she say?
- Yes.

514
00:26:32,427 --> 00:26:33,553
I'll be there soon.

515
00:26:34,971 --> 00:26:36,306
- Ci-N.
- Mom.

516
00:26:36,848 --> 00:26:38,931
- Why are you going home so late?
- Hi.

517
00:26:38,956 --> 00:26:42,126
- Umm, 'cause...
- Oh. Sorry. Dr. Peralta, speaking.

518
00:26:42,854 --> 00:26:43,854
Okay.

519
00:26:44,939 --> 00:26:48,568
Okay. Page Dr. Santos to prep
for an emergency C-section.

520
00:26:51,071 --> 00:26:52,489
Good. Good. I'll be there in 10.

521
00:26:53,406 --> 00:26:56,659
Listen, I have to run.
It is an emergency at the hospital.

522
00:26:57,327 --> 00:26:59,995
If anything happens,
just talk to your brother, okay?

523
00:26:59,996 --> 00:27:01,414
- Bye.
- Ba-bye.

524
00:27:06,169 --> 00:27:07,170
Okay, go, go, go.

525
00:27:09,172 --> 00:27:10,172
Bye, Mom.

526
00:27:17,222 --> 00:27:18,222
I'm sorry, Jay.

527
00:27:18,723 --> 00:27:20,112
I didn't get to introduce you.

528
00:27:20,391 --> 00:27:21,059
It's okay.

529
00:27:21,309 --> 00:27:23,269
Your mom seems busy.
Is she a doctor?

530
00:27:23,686 --> 00:27:25,563
Mm-hmm. Same with Dad.

531
00:27:27,398 --> 00:27:28,942
Is your family always like this?

532
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:30,359
Busy all the time?

533
00:27:31,194 --> 00:27:32,320
I told you.

534
00:27:33,113 --> 00:27:34,781
They wouldn't even notice me.

535
00:27:36,407 --> 00:27:38,660
Your mom mentioned earlier.
You have a brother?

536
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:39,536
Yeah.

537
00:27:39,702 --> 00:27:41,496
Cane, and my sister Cherry.

538
00:27:41,955 --> 00:27:43,665
They're not around much as well.

539
00:27:46,793 --> 00:27:48,503
Aren't you gonna invite me inside?

540
00:27:48,962 --> 00:27:50,254
Come on. I need to poop.

541
00:27:50,255 --> 00:27:51,922
[Ci-N chuckles]

542
00:27:51,923 --> 00:27:53,550
- What's so funny?
- You're disgusting.

543
00:27:53,967 --> 00:27:54,676
Don't you poop?

544
00:27:54,677 --> 00:27:56,218
[Ci-N chuckles]

545
00:27:56,219 --> 00:27:56,970
Come on.

546
00:27:57,178 --> 00:27:58,762
Wow, it's beautiful here.

547
00:27:58,763 --> 00:27:59,763
Of course.

548
00:28:00,473 --> 00:28:02,058
Your toilet's probably nice too.

549
00:28:15,113 --> 00:28:16,156
Are you avoiding me?

550
00:28:18,032 --> 00:28:19,409
Why would I do that?

551
00:28:23,872 --> 00:28:25,540
Anyway. How's Ci-N?

552
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,000
I haven't talked to him since that day.

553
00:28:28,001 --> 00:28:29,836
He's not answering my calls or texts.

554
00:28:30,211 --> 00:28:31,421
Let Ci-N be.

555
00:28:32,255 --> 00:28:33,255
He'll come around.

556
00:28:33,548 --> 00:28:34,548
I just don't know when.

557
00:28:35,425 --> 00:28:36,509
How did you know?

558
00:28:38,511 --> 00:28:40,511
He was like that when he
first came into Section E.

559
00:28:43,766 --> 00:28:44,976
Do you have 25 thousand?

560
00:28:45,935 --> 00:28:47,415
You sure you just wanna pay them off?

561
00:28:48,021 --> 00:28:49,861
Don't you wanna know
who's behind all of this?

562
00:28:50,481 --> 00:28:52,525
Are you saying Ci-N was set-up?

563
00:28:52,859 --> 00:28:53,859
Yeah!

564
00:28:54,027 --> 00:28:55,028
It was a frame-up.

565
00:28:55,153 --> 00:28:56,362
It's too obvious for me.

566
00:28:56,654 --> 00:28:59,490
The girl was overconfident.
Even without any proof.

567
00:29:00,658 --> 00:29:03,703
So, what's your plan?
How do we find out who's behind this?

568
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:06,915
If I tell you, will you help me?

569
00:29:07,707 --> 00:29:08,707
Of course.

570
00:29:09,042 --> 00:29:10,210
Anything for Ci-N.

571
00:29:11,836 --> 00:29:12,836
Alright.

572
00:29:13,338 --> 00:29:14,338
We're leaving now.

573
00:29:14,756 --> 00:29:15,756
Now?

574
00:29:15,924 --> 00:29:16,924
Yeah.

575
00:29:17,175 --> 00:29:19,010
I thought you'll do anything for Ci-N?

576
00:29:19,552 --> 00:29:20,595
Not up to it?

577
00:29:22,096 --> 00:29:23,097
Of course, I'm in.

578
00:29:23,556 --> 00:29:24,557
Let's go!

579
00:29:29,604 --> 00:29:30,897
So I have two suspects.

580
00:29:31,689 --> 00:29:33,858
Freya Hidalgo and Mykel Mitchell.

581
00:29:34,025 --> 00:29:36,653
If you think about it,
they both hate you.

582
00:29:36,819 --> 00:29:39,489
And they probably thought
of using Ci-N to get back at you.

583
00:29:39,948 --> 00:29:41,157
They're not the only ones.

584
00:29:41,491 --> 00:29:42,491
There's Aries too.

585
00:29:42,909 --> 00:29:43,993
Aries is your cousin.

586
00:29:45,036 --> 00:29:46,246
How about Ella?

587
00:29:48,164 --> 00:29:50,564
Ella is out of the picture.
She can't do something like that.

588
00:29:51,251 --> 00:29:54,629
But she's also mad at me because
I meddled with Mica and Calix.

589
00:29:54,963 --> 00:29:56,005
She can't do that.

590
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:57,799
[Jay-jay scoffs]

591
00:29:58,049 --> 00:29:59,467
And I know Ella. Okay?

592
00:29:59,592 --> 00:30:00,592
Okay.

593
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,760
If you say so.

594
00:30:02,595 --> 00:30:04,013
So, what's your plan?

595
00:30:05,515 --> 00:30:06,515
Honestly,

596
00:30:06,641 --> 00:30:07,684
I don't have one yet.

597
00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:09,435
You jerk.

598
00:30:09,686 --> 00:30:11,229
You don't even have a plan in mind?

599
00:30:11,729 --> 00:30:12,772
Do you have one?

600
00:30:13,898 --> 00:30:14,941
None either.

601
00:30:16,442 --> 00:30:17,527
Anyway.

602
00:30:18,027 --> 00:30:20,738
Why did you say that Aries is mad at you?

603
00:30:21,781 --> 00:30:22,781
Well…

604
00:30:22,865 --> 00:30:25,451
maybe you have some familial issues?

605
00:30:25,702 --> 00:30:26,702
Umm…

606
00:30:27,287 --> 00:30:28,327
it's because of the video.

607
00:30:28,746 --> 00:30:29,746
What video?

608
00:30:29,914 --> 00:30:34,002
I got a video exposing that it was indeed
Freya who called Ella a whore.

609
00:30:34,127 --> 00:30:35,628
But Aries got furious.

610
00:30:35,837 --> 00:30:38,714
He said I was just using the video
to spread hate towards Freya.

611
00:30:38,715 --> 00:30:40,008
He got mad at me instead!

612
00:30:40,383 --> 00:30:41,925
Did Freya really say that about Ella?

613
00:30:41,926 --> 00:30:43,303
Yeah. Wanna see the video?

614
00:30:45,013 --> 00:30:46,013
No need.

615
00:30:49,517 --> 00:30:50,517
Fine.

616
00:30:50,727 --> 00:30:51,727
I agree with you.

617
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:53,855
What Aries did was unfair.

618
00:30:55,231 --> 00:30:56,357
You agree with me?

619
00:30:57,734 --> 00:30:58,734
Really?

620
00:30:59,402 --> 00:30:59,861
Mm-hmm.

621
00:30:59,861 --> 00:31:00,695
That's nice.

622
00:31:00,696 --> 00:31:03,406
Can you repeat that again
so I can be sure you really agree with me?

623
00:31:03,906 --> 00:31:05,240
Come on, say it again!

624
00:31:05,241 --> 00:31:06,241
Nope.

625
00:31:06,284 --> 00:31:07,284
Then don't!

626
00:31:07,285 --> 00:31:09,245
Your car's really cool, huh?

627
00:31:09,996 --> 00:31:10,996
Awesome.

628
00:31:16,044 --> 00:31:17,462
What are you getting?

629
00:31:22,091 --> 00:31:23,801
Here.

630
00:31:24,969 --> 00:31:26,369
So what's your plan with the money?

631
00:31:27,013 --> 00:31:28,348
Ahh…

632
00:31:28,973 --> 00:31:30,391
I'm gonna give it back to Mykel.

633
00:31:31,142 --> 00:31:33,742
But if you do that, you're basically
admitting that Ci-N stole it.

634
00:31:34,479 --> 00:31:35,605
Oh, shit.

635
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,190
I haven't thought of that.

636
00:31:37,899 --> 00:31:40,568
I really didn't realize that.
You're really good.

637
00:31:41,235 --> 00:31:42,235
Tss.

638
00:31:42,487 --> 00:31:43,529
Stupid.

639
00:31:47,492 --> 00:31:48,493
Alright. I'll go ahead.

640
00:31:48,701 --> 00:31:50,370
- Thanks for this.
- Wait, wait, wait.

641
00:31:50,495 --> 00:31:51,621
What do you mean "thanks?"

642
00:31:52,163 --> 00:31:53,163
You owe me.

643
00:31:54,207 --> 00:31:55,291
You have to pay me back.

644
00:31:58,127 --> 00:31:59,628
Yeah, I'll pay you back.

645
00:31:59,629 --> 00:32:01,130
Ohhhh!

646
00:32:01,798 --> 00:32:02,798
I have an idea.

647
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,802
I know where we can spend that money.

648
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:06,511
Huh?

649
00:32:06,719 --> 00:32:09,847
Get in the car. Get in the car!

650
00:32:12,642 --> 00:32:14,435
- He's here mam.
- Thank you po.

651
00:32:18,481 --> 00:32:19,690
What's up, babe?

652
00:32:25,029 --> 00:32:26,322
Why did you do that?

653
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:28,490
What do you mean?

654
00:32:29,367 --> 00:32:30,742
I know you too well, Ella.

655
00:32:30,743 --> 00:32:33,704
I know when you've done
something against your will.

656
00:32:39,335 --> 00:32:40,335
Is she here?

657
00:32:49,053 --> 00:32:50,430
I just hate your cousin.

658
00:32:52,432 --> 00:32:54,809
Mica doesn't listen to me
anymore because of her.

659
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,812
Although I'm happy for her.

660
00:32:59,188 --> 00:33:01,566
I still hate the fact that
she did not listen to me.

661
00:33:03,443 --> 00:33:05,069
Why did you have to drag Ci-N into this?

662
00:33:05,653 --> 00:33:07,530
I thought he was your friend before.

663
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:10,074
I'll admit…

664
00:33:11,284 --> 00:33:13,870
I miss my friends from Section E.

665
00:33:15,371 --> 00:33:16,706
And Ci-N is one of them.

666
00:33:18,833 --> 00:33:21,002
Although he doesn't greet me
as much these days.

667
00:33:22,128 --> 00:33:23,296
Are we still friends?

668
00:33:25,715 --> 00:33:26,757
Maybe...

669
00:33:27,133 --> 00:33:28,301
it's because of me.

670
00:33:29,177 --> 00:33:32,722
Or maybe it's because of the incident
that happened between me and Keifer.

671
00:33:33,431 --> 00:33:35,224
But it's not because of you.

672
00:33:37,393 --> 00:33:39,312
I hope that's the only reason.

673
00:33:41,481 --> 00:33:43,232
But when Jay-jay came into the picture,

674
00:33:44,567 --> 00:33:46,235
they became instant best friends.

675
00:33:47,153 --> 00:33:48,237
And you know…

676
00:33:49,697 --> 00:33:50,865
They weren't like that.

677
00:33:52,283 --> 00:33:54,535
They weren't that close with me.

678
00:33:56,454 --> 00:33:57,454
So there…

679
00:33:59,123 --> 00:34:03,294
I know that targeting Ci-N
will hit Jayjay where it hurts the most.

680
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,589
You know...

681
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:08,966
you didn't have to do that, right?

682
00:34:14,222 --> 00:34:16,140
There's nothing to be insecure about.

683
00:34:16,933 --> 00:34:18,392
Especially towards Jay.

684
00:34:19,435 --> 00:34:21,646
People are not turning
their backs against you.

685
00:34:22,688 --> 00:34:23,688
And if they do...

686
00:34:24,982 --> 00:34:26,692
I'm here for you always.

687
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:33,074
It's okay, babe.

688
00:34:34,492 --> 00:34:35,492
It's okay.

689
00:34:38,454 --> 00:34:39,830
I'll handle all of this.

690
00:34:47,505 --> 00:34:49,882
We even cut classes for this plan of yours.

691
00:34:50,091 --> 00:34:52,260
We drove the whole day!
This place is too far.

692
00:34:53,511 --> 00:34:56,097
Are you sure that girl lives here?
What was her name again?

693
00:34:56,847 --> 00:34:58,099
Yeah. Imelda.

694
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,432
She's here.

695
00:34:59,517 --> 00:35:00,851
She skipped school today.

696
00:35:01,143 --> 00:35:02,562
Rory told me about it.

697
00:35:02,812 --> 00:35:04,981
How did you know Imelda lives here?

698
00:35:05,189 --> 00:35:06,232
Rory told me too.

699
00:35:07,066 --> 00:35:08,693
How does Rory get all these info?

700
00:35:08,985 --> 00:35:10,861
Whatever Rory wants to find out...

701
00:35:11,696 --> 00:35:12,696
Rory gets.

702
00:35:12,822 --> 00:35:13,822
Hmm?

703
00:35:31,924 --> 00:35:32,924
She's coming out.

704
00:35:34,677 --> 00:35:35,677
What the heck?

705
00:35:39,682 --> 00:35:41,142
What are you doing here?

706
00:35:41,767 --> 00:35:43,060
Are you guys a stalker?

707
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:45,271
How did you know where I live?

708
00:35:45,771 --> 00:35:48,274
Correction. Stalkers.
There's two of us.

709
00:35:50,151 --> 00:35:51,861
And that's not the only thing we know.

710
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,320
Imelda, right?

711
00:35:55,114 --> 00:35:56,657
We also know what you did.

712
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:58,450
And what is that?

713
00:35:59,243 --> 00:36:01,483
We're willing to pay you
to tell us who put you up to it.

714
00:36:01,787 --> 00:36:02,947
You think you can buy me off?

715
00:36:03,956 --> 00:36:05,166
So shameless.

716
00:36:05,333 --> 00:36:06,333
What do you take me for?

717
00:36:06,626 --> 00:36:07,626
Money-hungry?

718
00:36:07,752 --> 00:36:09,353
It's you who's friends with a thief.

719
00:36:09,378 --> 00:36:10,795
Oh, could you repeat what you just said?

720
00:36:10,796 --> 00:36:11,547
Jay...

721
00:36:11,548 --> 00:36:12,964
It's you who's friends with a thief.

722
00:36:12,965 --> 00:36:14,799
- Jay-jay...
- There. I repeated it.

723
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,760
Happy?

724
00:36:15,761 --> 00:36:18,303
You know, Imelda?
Your name sounds so bitchy.

725
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:20,472
- That's why you're one!
- You won't get anything out of me!

726
00:36:20,473 --> 00:36:21,806
- Jay-jay, please!
- Will you let me go?

727
00:36:21,807 --> 00:36:23,475
Let go! I'm gonna punch her on the face!

728
00:36:23,476 --> 00:36:24,185
Will you please stop.

729
00:36:24,186 --> 00:36:25,226
I won't!

730
00:36:25,227 --> 00:36:27,021
Get in the car. I'll do the talking.

731
00:36:27,313 --> 00:36:29,482
Don't you wanna help
Ci-N bury all this mess?

732
00:36:30,483 --> 00:36:31,483
Calm down!

733
00:36:33,819 --> 00:36:35,321
[frustrated grunt]

734
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,700
[Keifer sighs]

735
00:36:46,707 --> 00:36:47,833
[Jay-jay exhales]

736
00:37:06,394 --> 00:37:07,394
Fucking shit.

737
00:37:08,312 --> 00:37:09,855
Wow.

738
00:37:10,481 --> 00:37:11,941
Calm down.

739
00:37:12,191 --> 00:37:13,650
See? You failed too.

740
00:37:13,651 --> 00:37:15,610
I've been telling you.
Just one hit, then I'll be happy.

741
00:37:15,611 --> 00:37:17,154
You didn't give me the satisfaction.

742
00:37:17,321 --> 00:37:19,115
Shhhhh.

743
00:37:20,116 --> 00:37:21,492
Can you stop laughing?

744
00:37:23,327 --> 00:37:25,579
You're too full of yourself
and now your blood's boiling.

745
00:37:29,792 --> 00:37:32,252
I'm so annoyed right now.
Can you tell me something? Distract me.

746
00:37:32,253 --> 00:37:33,253
Tell me something.

747
00:37:33,629 --> 00:37:34,714
What something?

748
00:37:34,964 --> 00:37:35,964
Anything!

749
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,425
Okay, okay!

750
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:39,050
Uhm.

751
00:37:40,428 --> 00:37:41,929
Ah! How about this?

752
00:37:43,389 --> 00:37:44,682
I have something to ask.

753
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:47,893
Did you notice anything on my test paper
when you submitted it?

754
00:37:49,353 --> 00:37:50,353
Ah.

755
00:37:50,521 --> 00:37:51,521
I did that.

756
00:37:52,732 --> 00:37:53,732
What did you do?

757
00:37:55,025 --> 00:37:56,360
Your exam. I answered it.

758
00:37:56,736 --> 00:37:57,736
What?

759
00:39:16,148 --> 00:39:17,148
Shit!

760
00:39:17,817 --> 00:39:18,817
Are you insane?

761
00:39:18,901 --> 00:39:20,694
You're gonna get me in trouble for that!

762
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:24,239
On the contrary,
you're in a better situation now.

763
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,533
Why are you even mad?

764
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:27,117
Are you thinking straight?

765
00:39:27,368 --> 00:39:29,911
What if someone finds out? I'll be screwed!

766
00:39:29,912 --> 00:39:30,955
No one will know.

767
00:39:31,956 --> 00:39:33,541
So can you please just shut up.

768
00:39:34,041 --> 00:39:35,041
And relax.

769
00:39:36,126 --> 00:39:38,587
What went into your head?
Why did you do that?

770
00:39:39,255 --> 00:39:41,006
Ahhh...

771
00:39:41,257 --> 00:39:44,051
You wanted to do something nice
for me because of what you did.

772
00:39:45,386 --> 00:39:48,180
Apologizing is not my thing.
So is explaining.

773
00:39:48,556 --> 00:39:49,765
But I'm right, ain't I?

774
00:39:52,226 --> 00:39:54,812
I knew it!

775
00:39:55,145 --> 00:39:57,564
Is it so difficult to say sorry?
Didn't you learn about it?

776
00:39:57,565 --> 00:39:58,941
Just apologize to me.

777
00:39:59,608 --> 00:40:00,276
Tss.

778
00:40:00,526 --> 00:40:01,526
No.

779
00:40:01,735 --> 00:40:04,154
I don't apologize. It's beneath me.

780
00:40:07,324 --> 00:40:08,450
Whatever.

781
00:40:18,127 --> 00:40:19,211
I need to talk to you.

782
00:40:22,047 --> 00:40:23,047
Ah.

783
00:40:26,176 --> 00:40:27,219
About what?

784
00:40:29,054 --> 00:40:30,494
You skipped your class this morning.

785
00:40:30,681 --> 00:40:31,681
Didn't you?

786
00:40:32,975 --> 00:40:35,185
Do you think I don't
have eyes at your school?

787
00:40:37,354 --> 00:40:38,354
And you're with Keifer?

788
00:40:38,939 --> 00:40:39,939
Angelo...

789
00:40:40,274 --> 00:40:42,568
If you get in trouble one more time.

790
00:40:42,985 --> 00:40:44,505
You're really going to get it from me.

791
00:40:44,945 --> 00:40:46,155
And just a reminder.

792
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,920
Grandma will be coming home next weekend.

793
00:40:50,576 --> 00:40:51,576
Angelo...

794
00:40:51,911 --> 00:40:52,911
do you think it's okay?

795
00:40:54,038 --> 00:40:55,664
Maybe Grandma is still mad at me.

796
00:40:57,082 --> 00:40:58,500
Does she even want to see me?

797
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:02,046
Honestly, I really miss her a lot.

798
00:41:02,713 --> 00:41:05,341
I'm just scared of what
she's gonna say to me.

799
00:41:06,342 --> 00:41:08,102
After all, her heart
attack's because of me.

800
00:41:08,302 --> 00:41:09,302
That's in the past.

801
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:10,790
So just be on your best behavior.

802
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,524
I experienced my own family
turning their backs on me.

803
00:41:23,275 --> 00:41:25,694
Until now, they don't trust me.

804
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,447
I don't want that to
happen to a friend like Ci-N.

805
00:41:29,073 --> 00:41:30,233
Even with this small thing...

806
00:41:30,407 --> 00:41:32,117
I hope I can make it a little bit better.

807
00:41:41,251 --> 00:41:44,129
Don't you already know?
Section E is not allowed in here.

808
00:41:45,339 --> 00:41:47,048
There! 25,000 pesos!

809
00:41:47,049 --> 00:41:48,092
What the fuck?

810
00:41:48,968 --> 00:41:50,803
That's the money you paid that bitch!

811
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:52,512
Why are you giving it back to me?

812
00:41:52,513 --> 00:41:54,390
Maybe they felt guilty?

813
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,183
And Ci-N returned it?

814
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,600
No!

815
00:41:58,227 --> 00:42:00,104
Ci-N didn't steal that!

816
00:42:01,188 --> 00:42:02,188
I did!

817
00:42:03,691 --> 00:42:04,900
Oooh.

818
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:09,196
Trying to be the hero again for Section E.

819
00:42:09,738 --> 00:42:11,407
Jay, I know he's your friend but...

820
00:42:11,907 --> 00:42:13,283
Dont' take the blame for him.

821
00:42:13,575 --> 00:42:15,160
Imelda said that Ci-N did it.

822
00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:17,412
But it really wasn't Ci-N.

823
00:42:17,413 --> 00:42:20,457
It was me who took
the bag and gave it to Ci-N.

824
00:42:20,666 --> 00:42:23,544
I don't know why he didn't notice
that I was the one giving it to him.

825
00:42:23,794 --> 00:42:26,046
How did you know there was money inside?

826
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:31,719
I heard... the two of
them talking about it.

827
00:42:33,262 --> 00:42:36,348
Why did you steal it?
You can just ask Angelo for money.

828
00:42:39,184 --> 00:42:40,727
I don't want to burden Angelo any more.

829
00:42:40,728 --> 00:42:41,728
Also...

830
00:42:41,979 --> 00:42:43,230
I got blinded by the money.

831
00:42:45,983 --> 00:42:47,192
I don't know, guys.

832
00:42:47,985 --> 00:42:49,445
You sound defensive.

833
00:42:50,404 --> 00:42:52,238
Well then. If you want to be the culprit,

834
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:53,449
then so be it.

835
00:42:53,782 --> 00:42:54,782
You were the thief.

836
00:42:55,242 --> 00:42:56,242
That's right!

837
00:43:00,372 --> 00:43:02,374
Oh my gosh.

838
00:43:02,916 --> 00:43:03,959
That was juicy.

839
00:43:10,174 --> 00:43:11,216
What were you thinking?

840
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:14,010
Why?

841
00:43:17,848 --> 00:43:19,516
You were live on Facegram.

842
00:43:19,933 --> 00:43:22,018
But it really wasn't Ci-N.

843
00:43:22,019 --> 00:43:25,039
It was me who took
the bag and gave it to Ci-N.

844
00:43:25,064 --> 00:43:28,192
I don't know why he didn't notice
that I was the one giving it to him.

845
00:43:29,276 --> 00:43:31,528
How did you know there was money inside?

846
00:43:32,071 --> 00:43:33,906
That Freya's really sneaky.

847
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,575
Why did you do that, Jay?

848
00:43:37,701 --> 00:43:39,036
You got yourself into trouble.

849
00:43:39,828 --> 00:43:41,789
I just want you to go
back to your old self.

850
00:43:42,581 --> 00:43:43,581
But how about you?

851
00:43:44,833 --> 00:43:46,418
What about the things people would say?

852
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,545
Jay, internet is forever.

853
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:51,215
I don't care about them.

854
00:43:51,465 --> 00:43:53,065
We're talking about me. I can handle it.

855
00:43:53,634 --> 00:43:56,053
I went through tougher things before.

856
00:43:56,929 --> 00:43:59,348
This thing's a walk in the park.
So smile again, Ci.

857
00:44:07,397 --> 00:44:08,732
Thank you, Jay!

858
00:44:18,367 --> 00:44:20,077
Super thank you, Jay!

859
00:44:22,538 --> 00:44:23,955
[Jay-jay and Ci-N laugh]

860
00:44:23,956 --> 00:44:25,165
Smile again, okay?

861
00:44:25,541 --> 00:44:26,792
It's all fine now.

862
00:44:27,584 --> 00:44:28,877
I'm touched.

863
00:44:35,968 --> 00:44:37,761
Successfully deleted!

864
00:44:38,887 --> 00:44:40,222
Alright. I have to admit.

865
00:44:41,056 --> 00:44:42,223
You're really good at this, Edrix.

866
00:44:42,224 --> 00:44:43,224
Yes, sir.

867
00:44:44,101 --> 00:44:47,396
Freya's for sure freaking out right
now because her upload's been deleted.

868
00:44:48,814 --> 00:44:49,314
So?

869
00:44:49,731 --> 00:44:51,524
Are you planning on telling Jay-jay that...

870
00:44:51,525 --> 00:44:53,152
you were the one who deleted the video?

871
00:44:53,402 --> 00:44:53,861
Bro...

872
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:58,699
for sure that's additional points
for your plans on making her fall for you.

873
00:44:59,616 --> 00:45:01,076
I mean, think about it.

874
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:08,300
What the hell went
into that head of yours?

875
00:45:08,709 --> 00:45:09,709
Huh?

876
00:45:11,086 --> 00:45:12,086
Answer me!

877
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:14,380
What?

878
00:45:15,841 --> 00:45:16,841
Angelo...

879
00:45:17,885 --> 00:45:22,264
Jay-jay, if you need money,
you can always ask from us.

880
00:45:23,265 --> 00:45:25,305
All you do is trouble.
And you call yourself a lady?

881
00:45:26,977 --> 00:45:28,187
Mom, Aries.

882
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:31,648
If you're done eating,
I'd like to talk to Jay-jay. Alone.

883
00:45:47,456 --> 00:45:49,124
You! Tell me the truth!

884
00:45:49,374 --> 00:45:51,134
Or do you want me to
know from other people?

885
00:45:53,378 --> 00:45:54,378
Okay, fine.

886
00:46:00,886 --> 00:46:02,595
- Hello, Keifer.
- Angelo?

887
00:46:02,596 --> 00:46:04,388
Huh? Keifer? Why does he have his number?

888
00:46:04,389 --> 00:46:05,973
- I know this is out of the blue.
- Is this about Jay-jay?

889
00:46:05,974 --> 00:46:06,516
Yeah.

890
00:46:06,934 --> 00:46:08,685
I just wanna know.
Can you explain it to me?

891
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:10,020
Is this about the video?

892
00:46:10,938 --> 00:46:13,565
Jay-jay tried to be the hero again
to clear Ci-N's name.

893
00:46:14,566 --> 00:46:15,359
But I'll handle it.

894
00:46:15,525 --> 00:46:17,110
I had the video taken down already.

895
00:46:17,569 --> 00:46:18,278
Is that all?

896
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:19,112
Okay.

897
00:46:19,154 --> 00:46:20,154
No, that's all.

898
00:46:25,202 --> 00:46:26,411
I will let this pass.

899
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:28,121
But never do it again!

900
00:46:28,872 --> 00:46:30,082
You're not a hero.

901
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:32,668
Grandma!

902
00:46:32,669 --> 00:46:33,919
Oh!

903
00:46:34,127 --> 00:46:35,587
You've gotten so tall.

904
00:46:38,924 --> 00:46:40,591
- Hi! How are you?
- Did you miss me?

905
00:46:40,592 --> 00:46:42,134
Of course. Come in, come inside.

906
00:46:42,135 --> 00:46:43,511
Weren't you bored on the way here?

907
00:46:43,512 --> 00:46:44,804
Oh no, it was quite lovely.

908
00:46:44,805 --> 00:46:46,473
- Grandma.
- I was fine the whole time.

909
00:46:46,807 --> 00:46:49,225
- Oh, how are you, grandson?
- Hi, Grandma.

910
00:46:49,226 --> 00:46:51,812
- You've gotten quite tall.
- Hello, Auntie.

911
00:46:54,147 --> 00:46:55,606
Jenny, where are the twins?

912
00:46:55,607 --> 00:46:58,610
Oh, we didn't let them tag along.
They're too rowdy.

913
00:46:59,027 --> 00:47:03,448
Good thing those twins aren't here.
They're just gonna be a pain in my ass.

914
00:47:06,451 --> 00:47:07,786
Where is Jay-jay?

915
00:47:08,453 --> 00:47:10,205
Does Grandma miss me too?

916
00:47:10,664 --> 00:47:12,791
Oh yeah. Where's that girl?

917
00:47:13,875 --> 00:47:15,245
What's with that tone?

918
00:47:16,211 --> 00:47:18,463
So, Auntie Jenny's mad at me too.

919
00:47:18,797 --> 00:47:21,300
She thinks I'm a burden, just like my mom.

920

922

- Call her please.
- Okay sir.

923
00:47:27,848 --> 00:47:32,059
Allan and Allen told me that Jayjay
has a video circulating around.

924
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:34,438
She admitted to stealing money.

925
00:47:36,273 --> 00:47:39,150
- Jay-jay, Sir Angelo is looking for you.
- I'll go later.

926
00:47:39,151 --> 00:47:40,276
- Come on.
- Later.

927
00:47:40,277 --> 00:47:42,779
Maybe she can explain it to us.

928
00:47:43,655 --> 00:47:46,867
Don't take her side, Mother.

929
00:47:47,326 --> 00:47:51,246
I've been telling you
to return her to Jenna.

930

932
00:47:56,793 --> 00:47:58,920
That child is troubled.

933
00:47:59,254 --> 00:48:00,422
Exactly.

934
00:48:00,672 --> 00:48:03,383
If she's that troubled,
then let her seek mental help.

935

Jay-jay is not mentally disturbed.

936

She is violent and destructive.

942
00:48:18,523 --> 00:48:20,192
Her actions are all too violent.

943

I'm fine. I'm happy that
you're all better now.

949

I'll go ahead now.

Yes.

952
00:49:11,743 --> 00:49:15,705
She's not just a freeloader,
but a spendthrift too. Shameful.

953

Let her be.

954

Why do they talk to me that way?

963

Why are you pressuring me?

1085
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:24,258
You have rice cooker here, don't you?

1086
00:56:24,259 --> 00:56:25,343
Don't touch those.

1087
00:56:25,677 --> 00:56:26,511
Whose are those?

1088
00:56:26,636 --> 00:56:27,303
It's Eman's.

1089
00:56:27,387 --> 00:56:29,054
Where is he? Why isn't he coming to school?

1090
00:56:29,055 --> 00:56:30,138
There at their restaurant.

1091
00:56:30,139 --> 00:56:33,308
I heard their business went bankrupt,
that's why he had to work.

1092
00:56:33,309 --> 00:56:34,309
What are you doing?

1093
00:56:34,435 --> 00:56:35,435
Thank you.

1094
00:56:36,062 --> 00:56:37,122
We're gonna help around here.

1095
00:56:37,146 --> 00:56:38,146
What?
