1
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:17,517
Sorry, I had to drop Keiren off first.

2
00:00:17,535 --> 00:00:18,703
Thank you for taking me home.

3
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,390
You're joining in too, Yuri?

4
00:00:23,415 --> 00:00:24,714
Do these two like me?

5
00:00:24,876 --> 00:00:26,261
Jay, you didn't reply.

6
00:00:27,253 --> 00:00:28,546
Ci-N, wait for me!

7
00:00:29,506 --> 00:00:30,548
Class announcement.

8
00:00:30,757 --> 00:00:32,884
University of Hemilton is inviting us.

9
00:00:33,134 --> 00:00:35,595
What's with the University of Hemilton?

10
00:00:35,762 --> 00:00:38,848
Those who want to enroll,
they pass their requirements on the tour.

11
00:00:38,932 --> 00:00:39,349
Jay?

12
00:00:39,391 --> 00:00:41,518
Drew, you're absent again.
Where the hell are you?

13
00:00:41,726 --> 00:00:43,019
I'm here at Kingsground.

14
00:00:43,103 --> 00:00:43,728
Kingsground?

15
00:00:43,812 --> 00:00:45,313
- Yuri Boy.
- Is Tiger there?

16
00:00:45,397 --> 00:00:46,022
Yuri!

17
00:00:46,231 --> 00:00:46,773
Jay!

18
00:00:46,774 --> 00:00:47,816
Drew, are you okay?

19
00:00:47,982 --> 00:00:50,335
You fight. Just like old times.

20
00:00:50,402 --> 00:00:51,708
Do you gamble here?

21
00:00:51,736 --> 00:00:52,629
Sorry, Jay.

22
00:00:52,654 --> 00:00:54,005
I shouldn't have called you.

23
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,365
That fight was horrible.

24
00:00:55,448 --> 00:00:56,700
You know what to do, Yuri.

25
00:00:56,783 --> 00:00:59,052
Yuri, do you really have to do it?

26
00:00:59,077 --> 00:01:00,412
I need to fight.

27
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,124
I'm sorry, Jay. Promise,
I won't come back here again.

28
00:01:04,582 --> 00:01:05,125
Jay!

29
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:05,667
Keif!

30
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:08,503
Just shut up. Hold my
hand, and get ready to run.

31
00:01:08,878 --> 00:01:09,878
Huh?

32
00:01:16,928 --> 00:01:19,180
So for now, just shut up,

33
00:01:19,889 --> 00:01:21,891
hold my hand,
and get ready to run.

34
00:01:22,392 --> 00:01:23,392
Huh?

35
00:02:31,878 --> 00:02:32,878
Hi.

36
00:02:33,588 --> 00:02:34,588
Hi, girls.

37
00:02:35,298 --> 00:02:37,050
Can I ask a favor from you, guys.

38
00:02:38,301 --> 00:02:39,301
What's that?

39
00:02:39,594 --> 00:02:41,596
I want to propose to my girlfriend tonight.

40
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:42,930
What is he saying?

41
00:02:43,348 --> 00:02:44,668
Her favorite is the ferris wheel.

42
00:02:44,891 --> 00:02:46,559
But I think we won't make it anymore.

43
00:02:48,186 --> 00:02:49,270
Maybe we can...

44
00:02:50,104 --> 00:02:51,564
Yeah, you may cut in line.

45
00:02:51,731 --> 00:02:52,731
- Really?
- Mmhm.

46
00:02:52,899 --> 00:02:53,899
Thanks!

47
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:54,818
Shhh.

48
00:02:55,026 --> 00:02:56,027
I told you!

49
00:02:56,528 --> 00:02:57,528
Good luck.

50
00:02:57,654 --> 00:03:00,698
She's so lucky to have someone that
is willing to do everything for his love.

51
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:04,828
Even though I don't know you...
I'm sure you'll be a good husband.

52
00:05:39,857 --> 00:05:41,693
I have a huge problem.

53
00:05:41,943 --> 00:05:46,406
I hope Angelo could forgive me for
faking his signature on my permit.

54
00:05:46,656 --> 00:05:49,574
Why won't he agree to let
me go to Hemilton University?

55
00:05:49,575 --> 00:05:51,744
This is a school activity and not leisure—
Hey!

56
00:05:51,869 --> 00:05:54,038
Jerk! He's acting like a kid, let's go.

57
00:05:54,162 --> 00:05:55,498
What the... Mayo?

58
00:05:56,207 --> 00:05:58,667
What are you doing? Why
did you jump suddenly?

59
00:05:58,668 --> 00:05:59,668
Uhm… Kapour .

60
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:01,504
Ka… what?

61
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:04,340
Kapour. It's an activity
where you jump across walls.

62
00:06:05,633 --> 00:06:06,968
Is it really called Kapour?

63
00:06:07,093 --> 00:06:08,886
I think I remember it differently.

64
00:06:09,053 --> 00:06:10,948
Of all places, you thought
of doing it here, huh?

65
00:06:10,972 --> 00:06:11,972
Look at this.

66
00:06:12,849 --> 00:06:13,725
I'll do a cartwheel.

67
00:06:13,725 --> 00:06:14,725
Let me see.

68
00:06:17,145 --> 00:06:18,855
- Cool, right?
- Yeah, nice.

69
00:06:30,283 --> 00:06:31,283
What?

70
00:06:32,201 --> 00:06:33,201
What?

71
00:06:34,245 --> 00:06:35,245
What?

72
00:06:36,414 --> 00:06:37,414
What?

73
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:39,791
Tss!

74
00:06:40,793 --> 00:06:41,793
Tss your face.

75
00:06:55,099 --> 00:06:56,517
Quit staring.

76
00:07:02,106 --> 00:07:03,106
Are you blushing?

77
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:04,900
Huh?

78
00:07:08,946 --> 00:07:09,946
You are blushing.

79
00:07:10,865 --> 00:07:12,200
Fuck off! I'm not!

80
00:07:13,242 --> 00:07:15,036
Can you stop cursing?

81
00:07:15,953 --> 00:07:17,747
I want to curse, so I will.

82
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:18,914
Fuck you! Damn it! Jerk!

83
00:07:18,915 --> 00:07:20,457
Stupid! Asshole! Animal!

84
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,752
You motherfucking fuckhead!

85
00:07:23,002 --> 00:07:24,462
Shit! You son of a bitch!

86
00:07:24,564 --> 00:07:26,547
Uhhh... damn!

87
00:07:28,674 --> 00:07:30,134
Your mouth's truly dirty.

88
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,138
You want me to clean it for you?

89
00:07:37,016 --> 00:07:39,852
Why? Is yours clean? You don't curse?

90
00:07:40,394 --> 00:07:42,271
Then clean my mouth too.

91
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,733
We can clean it together.

92
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,620
Huh?

93
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:00,607
What do you mean by that?

94
00:08:01,332 --> 00:08:02,332
You don't want to?

95
00:08:03,543 --> 00:08:05,463
Why does it seem like
you're blushing even more?

96
00:08:07,797 --> 00:08:08,797
I'm not.

97
00:08:10,299 --> 00:08:11,318
It's just because of the heat.

98
00:08:11,342 --> 00:08:12,342
Ahhh.

99
00:08:12,844 --> 00:08:14,178
So you're in heat?

100
00:08:16,055 --> 00:08:17,055
Asshole!

101
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:18,766
I'll smack you.

102
00:08:20,476 --> 00:08:22,103
If you use profanity

103
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,355
one more time...

104
00:08:25,565 --> 00:08:26,607
I will kiss you.

105
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,610
Do you understand?

106
00:08:31,821 --> 00:08:32,821
Huh?

107
00:08:34,198 --> 00:08:35,198
Do...

108
00:08:35,241 --> 00:08:36,241
you...

109
00:08:36,742 --> 00:08:37,785
understand?

110
00:08:40,037 --> 00:08:41,037
Y-yeah.

111
00:08:42,498 --> 00:08:43,498
Good.

112
00:08:46,043 --> 00:08:47,043
Okay.

113
00:08:59,348 --> 00:09:00,348
Shit!

114
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:03,155
Can't I curse in front of him from now on?

115
00:09:14,989 --> 00:09:15,989
Guys, guys!

116
00:09:16,866 --> 00:09:17,866
Serious announcement.

117
00:09:18,075 --> 00:09:19,823
We need to fix ourselves
up right now or else

118
00:09:19,847 --> 00:09:21,555
we won't be able to
get to the university.

119
00:09:21,954 --> 00:09:22,954
Okay, let's go!

120
00:09:23,497 --> 00:09:24,497
Come on!

121
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:25,583
Fix yourselves.

122
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:26,826
- I'm all set.
- Your necktie!

123
00:09:27,502 --> 00:09:28,502
Jay, how do you do this?

124
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,420
Me too, bro.

125
00:09:30,504 --> 00:09:31,504
Let me see.

126
00:09:32,924 --> 00:09:33,924
That's nice!

127
00:09:35,134 --> 00:09:36,134
Oh yeah.

128
00:09:37,428 --> 00:09:38,428
There.

129
00:09:39,305 --> 00:09:40,305
It's okay.

130
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,068
Thank you, Jay.

131
00:09:42,141 --> 00:09:45,489
- Fix ours too, Jay. Please.
- Us too, if it's okay?

132
00:09:45,576 --> 00:09:48,231
Oh, God. Come here.

133
00:09:48,606 --> 00:09:49,815
Chill, chill.

134
00:09:49,982 --> 00:09:53,903
Good thing Auntie Gemma taught me
how to do this before school started.

135
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,070
Oh, okay!

136
00:09:55,742 --> 00:09:56,656
This one? This too?

137
00:09:56,864 --> 00:09:58,157
No need, you're fine.

138
00:09:58,908 --> 00:09:59,908
Thank you, Jay.

139
00:10:00,368 --> 00:10:04,062
Why don't you guys fix your uniforms
before going to school?

140
00:10:04,087 --> 00:10:05,915
- Sorry.
- Gosh.

141
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:09,085
Don't dress yourselves
just for the sake of it.

142
00:10:09,502 --> 00:10:10,502
Make it tidy!

143
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:14,048
Your necktie's all crooked. And you
don't even know how to tie it properly.

144
00:10:19,053 --> 00:10:21,097
Yeah, that's it.

145
00:10:21,347 --> 00:10:23,391
We're looking good, looking formal.

146
00:10:24,517 --> 00:10:25,517
Good enough, huh.

147
00:10:25,643 --> 00:10:26,269
That's fine.

148
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:27,269
You're already sweating.

149
00:10:28,104 --> 00:10:29,605
Your ID bro, fix it up.

150
00:10:29,939 --> 00:10:33,150
Cool! The King of Assholes knows
how to wear a necktie.

151
00:10:33,317 --> 00:10:34,986
- You need help?
- Yes, please.

152
00:10:35,987 --> 00:10:37,071
Come here.

153
00:10:38,322 --> 00:10:40,866
Hey Blaster, the logo should be seen.

154
00:10:42,589 --> 00:10:44,244
Hey, Mayo! Is that a kiss mark?

155
00:10:44,245 --> 00:10:45,245
No!

156
00:10:45,705 --> 00:10:47,163
That's a kiss mark, isn't it?

157
00:10:47,164 --> 00:10:48,291
I told you it's not, Jay.

158
00:10:49,855 --> 00:10:50,855
Sorry.

159
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:54,463
I'm not gonna look at your… insect bite.

160
00:10:55,001 --> 00:10:58,301
Fix your uniform. You look like
you came from the morgue.

161
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:00,719
You can do it yourself.

162
00:11:02,229 --> 00:11:03,105
Is this okay?

163
00:11:04,223 --> 00:11:06,892
Wow! You're very good.

164
00:11:07,351 --> 00:11:08,351
You know how to do it.

165
00:11:08,686 --> 00:11:09,897
Of course. Just look at this.

166
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,233
It's not fully done.

167
00:11:14,483 --> 00:11:15,483
Why?

168
00:11:15,943 --> 00:11:18,779
Look at your collar. It's folded upwards.

169
00:11:19,738 --> 00:11:20,905
Come here. (Watch on www.kisskh.la or www.kisskh.co to support Admin)

170
00:11:23,659 --> 00:11:25,953
There. You just have to fix it.

171
00:11:26,412 --> 00:11:30,082
Maybe it's better to have a regular
university visit for you to look your best.

172
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:31,978
You look like decent human beings now.

173
00:11:32,081 --> 00:11:33,081
Come on now.

174
00:11:33,106 --> 00:11:34,378
I always look decent!

175
00:11:37,214 --> 00:11:38,299
I'm so excited.

176
00:11:39,925 --> 00:11:40,968
- But it's good, bro.
- It's good.

177
00:11:41,223 --> 00:11:42,223
Damn!

178
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:44,490
The students made it to the bus already.

179
00:11:45,056 --> 00:11:45,431
Let's go!

180
00:11:45,848 --> 00:11:46,848
They're waiting for us!

181
00:11:47,184 --> 00:11:47,725
Let's go!

182
00:11:47,725 --> 00:11:48,725
Let's go!

183
00:11:50,998 --> 00:11:52,103
Come on, let's go!

184
00:11:53,314 --> 00:11:54,314
Wait a sec.

185
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:56,965
I don't know how to tie this.

186
00:11:59,401 --> 00:12:00,693
- Well, f...
- Oops.

187
00:12:05,409 --> 00:12:09,371
F-fortunately my uniform is white,
it's the color of our uniform.

188
00:12:09,372 --> 00:12:11,248
We're going to Hemilton...

189
00:12:12,792 --> 00:12:14,627
It was alright earlier, right? I saw it.

190
00:12:15,002 --> 00:12:15,336
Huh?

191
00:12:15,961 --> 00:12:17,171
You haven't checked mine.

192
00:12:22,715 --> 00:12:23,715
Come here, then!

193
00:12:27,306 --> 00:12:28,349
What happened here?

194
00:12:29,619 --> 00:12:30,976
Looks like you went to war.

195
00:12:57,336 --> 00:12:58,627
Are you trying to kill me?

196
00:12:58,921 --> 00:12:59,921
Sorry.

197
00:13:01,715 --> 00:13:02,216
It's your fault.

198
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:03,175
Come on, let's go.

199
00:13:03,467 --> 00:13:04,093
Wait.

200
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:04,677
What?

201
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,178
Wear your ID.

202
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,394
Can't even wear your ID properly?

203
00:13:13,439 --> 00:13:14,103
There.

204
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:15,771
That's how you wear a uniform.

205
00:13:29,936 --> 00:13:32,820
Welcome to Hemilton University.

206
00:13:33,267 --> 00:13:38,502
Once everyone's settled
down, we'll start the orientation.

207
00:13:38,544 --> 00:13:43,021
- Okay students, please fill in now the vacant seats.
- Let's talk when you get home.

208
00:13:43,441 --> 00:13:47,636
And for those who want to pursue
the hotel and restaurant management course,

209
00:13:47,761 --> 00:13:49,847
we'll begin our orientation shortly.

210
00:13:51,098 --> 00:13:52,807
Okay students. For
those who are standing...

211
00:13:52,808 --> 00:13:54,100
- Okay students. For those who standing...
- Jay! A Mariano,

212
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:55,821
- please settle down.
- Is he your relative?

213
00:14:00,055 --> 00:14:01,181
What's this?

214
00:14:02,401 --> 00:14:03,861
He seems familiar.

215
00:14:04,778 --> 00:14:06,298
It's like I already saw him somewhere,

216
00:14:07,156 --> 00:14:08,574
but just can't remember.

217
00:14:10,288 --> 00:14:14,968
I repeat, for those students
who are still standing,

218
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:18,148
please settle down immediately.

219
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:22,338
Something wrong, Jay?

220
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,423
You've been quiet since earlier.

221
00:14:25,308 --> 00:14:27,510
Nothing. I'm just tired.

222
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:28,617
Are you sure?

223
00:14:29,094 --> 00:14:31,820
You've been excited for days,
but now you're so gloomy.

224
00:14:32,056 --> 00:14:33,495
Is Percy still bothering you?

225
00:14:33,548 --> 00:14:36,227
No. He doesn't contact me anymore.

226
00:14:37,132 --> 00:14:39,359
Let's sit down. I'll be there with Rakki.

227
00:14:40,397 --> 00:14:41,757
Our state-of-the-art facilities...

228
00:14:42,274 --> 00:14:43,274
Hi, Rakki!

229
00:14:43,317 --> 00:14:44,276
[speaker continues]

230
00:14:44,276 --> 00:14:45,152
Hi, Rakki.

231
00:14:45,196 --> 00:14:46,196
Why are you late?

232
00:14:49,532 --> 00:14:50,824
Jay! Jay! Jay!

233
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:51,891
Guess what?

234
00:14:52,073 --> 00:14:53,658
I have a surprise for you!

235
00:14:54,453 --> 00:14:55,453
Tada!

236
00:14:56,288 --> 00:14:58,332
What Felix went through was tough,

237
00:14:58,457 --> 00:15:00,793
- but he seems fine now.
- Look. Check it out!

238
00:15:00,918 --> 00:15:03,170
A parent’s care is truly a big deal.

239
00:15:03,587 --> 00:15:05,088
I am happy for him.

240
00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:06,089
What's this?

241
00:15:06,257 --> 00:15:09,260
- Go ahead! Look at it.
- But when will I experience that too?

242
00:15:09,635 --> 00:15:11,386
They are asking you to
sign a varsity scholarship?

243
00:15:11,387 --> 00:15:12,196
Yes, Jay!

244
00:15:12,221 --> 00:15:14,536
- Everything was because of you! Thank you, Jay!
- Wow!

245
00:15:15,683 --> 00:15:17,142
That's great! I am so happy for you!

246
00:15:17,184 --> 00:15:18,184
Thank you so much!

247
00:15:19,061 --> 00:15:20,646
Hey, look!

248
00:15:21,063 --> 00:15:22,832
Felix was asked to sign
a varsity scholarship!

249
00:15:22,856 --> 00:15:23,983
Really? Nice one, bro.

250
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,400
Thank you, bro.

251
00:15:26,652 --> 00:15:28,772
Can you hold on to this?
I might get it lost. Please.

252
00:15:30,656 --> 00:15:31,656
So fun.

253
00:15:34,076 --> 00:15:36,161
- Awesome, right?
- Thank you, Jay.

254
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,247
- That's me.
- It's because you meddled again.

255
00:15:38,747 --> 00:15:41,917
- Good things came out of it, right?
- Get up.

256
00:15:42,126 --> 00:15:43,544
[Section E boys chattering]

257
00:15:50,676 --> 00:15:52,136
I got a scholarship!

258
00:15:52,845 --> 00:15:54,179
I'm so happy for you.

259
00:15:55,219 --> 00:15:56,219
Deserve!

[students chattering]

261
00:16:01,895 --> 00:16:03,022
I look handsome, right?

262
00:16:03,689 --> 00:16:04,689
Stop it!

263
00:16:04,732 --> 00:16:05,816
Where are they?

264
00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:09,068
Some are in the restroom,
the others are on the bus already.

265
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:09,862
They're taking so long.

266
00:16:09,863 --> 00:16:11,363
Dude, we should skip the bus.

267
00:16:11,447 --> 00:16:12,268
Skip it.

268
00:16:12,323 --> 00:16:13,323
For real, though.

269
00:16:13,574 --> 00:16:15,576
Guys, we can go to a party tonight.

270
00:16:15,868 --> 00:16:16,535
Oh, for real?

271
00:16:16,536 --> 00:16:17,953
Dude, I got three numbers.

272
00:16:18,454 --> 00:16:18,871
Yo!

273
00:16:19,206 --> 00:16:19,580
Okay, look.

274
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:22,333
He's the guy on the
picture at the bulletin board.

275
00:16:23,042 --> 00:16:24,042
Wait, how about me?

276
00:16:24,376 --> 00:16:25,919
Okay, you can stop.

277
00:16:26,201 --> 00:16:27,201
Come on.

278
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,571
Jasfher?

279

Jasfher Mariano?

280
00:16:30,674 --> 00:16:31,674
Shit!

281
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,177
I got all the girls out here.

[boys chattering]

283
00:16:36,138 --> 00:16:37,698
- Boys, let's go.
- How about you, Keif?

284
00:16:37,723 --> 00:16:38,349
Take care, man.

285
00:16:38,515 --> 00:16:40,243
- You'll go ahead?
- Yeah, whatever Rory wants.

287
00:16:43,334 --> 00:16:44,334
Quick!

288
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,041
Oh, oh.

289
00:16:47,066 --> 00:16:47,608
What's wrong?

290
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:48,833
What's wrong?

291
00:16:50,903 --> 00:16:52,529
- Do you know him?
- He's my dad.

292
00:16:53,087 --> 00:16:54,198
I think he's my dad.

293
00:16:57,743 --> 00:16:59,223
You want us to come closer and check?

294
00:16:59,962 --> 00:17:01,037
Come on. Let's go.

295
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,458
Pa?

296
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:05,875
Papa?

297
00:17:10,206 --> 00:17:11,206
Jay.

298
00:17:13,425 --> 00:17:14,718
You know me?

299
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,640
Of course.

300
00:17:25,562 --> 00:17:26,562
Jay.

301
00:17:30,991 --> 00:17:33,237
I've been waiting for this moment.

302
00:17:39,618 --> 00:17:41,954
Can I get a hug?

303
00:17:47,626 --> 00:17:49,128
Jay...

304
00:17:51,338 --> 00:17:53,257
I missed you so much.

305
00:17:57,344 --> 00:17:58,387
I'm sorry.

306
00:17:58,971 --> 00:17:59,971
Jay, I'm sorry.

307
00:18:00,764 --> 00:18:04,560
Forgive your dad. Please, forgive me.

308
00:18:06,854 --> 00:18:08,313
I didn't mean it.

309
00:18:10,983 --> 00:18:12,776
Papa…

310
00:18:16,321 --> 00:18:18,240
Hey, are you okay?

311
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:18,824
Yeah.

312
00:18:19,042 --> 00:18:20,199
Don't mind me, I'm good.

313
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:26,330
I love you, child.

314
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,708

Get away!

Aries.

319
00:18:34,047 --> 00:18:35,049
I said get away!

320
00:18:36,213 --> 00:18:39,456
You had a deal with Angelo
to never come near Jay-jay!

321
00:18:40,379 --> 00:18:41,379
So, what's this?!

322
00:18:42,139 --> 00:18:44,057
Do you want me to call the police? Huh?!

323
00:18:46,101 --> 00:18:47,101
Deal?

324
00:18:56,195 --> 00:18:57,446
Papa, wait!

325
00:18:57,821 --> 00:18:58,946
Jay-jay, stay here.

326
00:18:58,947 --> 00:19:00,741
Let go of me, Aries!

00:19:07,623 --> 00:19:08,623
Wait up!

00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:11,644
- Aries, let go of me!
- Jay-jay!

Aries.

333
00:19:13,378 --> 00:19:15,130
Papa, wait!

334
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,548
Aries, you're hurting her.

335
00:19:17,549 --> 00:19:19,051
Aries, let her go.

336
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,510
Papa!

337
00:19:20,761 --> 00:19:21,761
Stay right here.

338
00:19:22,137 --> 00:19:23,137
Papa!

339
00:19:23,305 --> 00:19:23,931
- Papa!
- Jay!

- Papa!
- Jay!

00:19:27,684 --> 00:19:28,684
Papa!

00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:29,353
Aries!

344
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:30,436
Jay, are you okay?

345
00:19:31,146 --> 00:19:32,146
Jay.

346
00:19:35,025 --> 00:19:36,025
Jay.

347
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:37,109
Jay.

348
00:19:37,945 --> 00:19:38,945
Are you okay?

349
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:42,431
Papa...

350
00:19:42,605 --> 00:19:43,648
Are you okay?

351
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,921
What's that deal about? Do you know?

352
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:00,926
You know, am I right?

353
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,055
Is that why you don't
want me to come there?

354
00:20:05,597 --> 00:20:08,058
Is that why you can't
give any valid reason?

355
00:20:10,102 --> 00:20:14,147
I was worrying if you'll get mad at me.
Then this is what I'll find out?!

356
00:20:14,439 --> 00:20:16,482
Jay, that's not the point here.

357
00:20:16,483 --> 00:20:18,443
I don't care about your point!

358
00:20:19,987 --> 00:20:22,781
If you want me to
explain, you won't get it.

359
00:20:23,365 --> 00:20:25,325
But it's my right to know!

360
00:20:25,576 --> 00:20:26,952
He's my dad!

361
00:20:28,996 --> 00:20:31,707
I've been looking for him all my life!

362
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,185
I want to see him so bad.

363
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:37,504
Why are you taking that away from me?

364
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,717
I'm not the one who
will explain this to you.

365
00:20:42,534 --> 00:20:44,219
Aunt Jeana will be here tomorrow.

366
00:20:44,582 --> 00:20:45,720
Ask her about it.

367
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:48,329
Don't let her come here!
I don't want to see her.

368
00:20:48,515 --> 00:20:49,850
Jay, she's still your mother.

369
00:20:49,892 --> 00:20:51,143
I don't want to see her!

370
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:17,252
I don't know where to find my father.

371
00:21:17,846 --> 00:21:20,881
All I know is, my feet
somehow brought me here.

372
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,800
And that I need someone to talk to.

373
00:21:36,104 --> 00:21:37,104
So,

374
00:21:37,981 --> 00:21:40,233
what happened that you
ended up on my doorstep?

375
00:21:43,028 --> 00:21:44,028
I was biking around.

376
00:21:45,364 --> 00:21:47,074
How did you know that I'm outside?

377
00:21:49,534 --> 00:21:50,534
I have my ways.

378
00:22:09,638 --> 00:22:10,847
What's your...

379
00:22:11,556 --> 00:22:13,266
parents' jobs, by the way?

380
00:22:14,601 --> 00:22:15,601
Hmm...

381
00:22:17,187 --> 00:22:17,729
none.

382
00:22:18,146 --> 00:22:19,146
Hmm?

383
00:22:19,564 --> 00:22:20,564
Is that possible?

384
00:22:20,941 --> 00:22:21,483
Eh...

385
00:22:21,942 --> 00:22:23,318
Your house is so big.

386
00:22:23,527 --> 00:22:25,821
It can't be that it was just
handed down to them?

387
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:28,448
No one gave this house to them.

388
00:22:29,992 --> 00:22:31,159
Because it's mine.

389
00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:33,619
Only mine.

390
00:22:34,621 --> 00:22:35,621
Huh?

391
00:22:36,331 --> 00:22:37,499
They don't live here.

392
00:22:38,417 --> 00:22:39,417
Because…

393
00:22:39,584 --> 00:22:40,836
I don't let them.

394
00:22:42,671 --> 00:22:43,671
How could that be?

395
00:22:44,381 --> 00:22:45,381
Where are they?

396
00:22:54,433 --> 00:22:56,476
My mom.. Is dead.

397
00:22:57,853 --> 00:22:58,979
My dad,

398
00:23:00,272 --> 00:23:01,398
busy with his new wife.

399
00:23:02,941 --> 00:23:04,693
So I kicked them out.

400
00:23:05,402 --> 00:23:07,002
Because I don't want to see their faces.

401
00:23:08,697 --> 00:23:09,697
Any other questions?

402
00:23:12,367 --> 00:23:13,367
Sorry.

403
00:23:16,371 --> 00:23:17,371
You?

404
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:19,791
What's with your family?

405
00:23:21,752 --> 00:23:22,961
You saw it yesterday.

406
00:23:25,213 --> 00:23:26,213
You know you're unfair.

407
00:23:27,507 --> 00:23:30,093
You ask me so much questions,
but you don't answer mine.

408
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,720
How about this?

409
00:23:33,263 --> 00:23:35,724
So you can't evade, let's play a game.

410
00:23:36,438 --> 00:23:37,438
Truth or dare?

411
00:23:38,101 --> 00:23:39,101
Huh?

412
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,228
You're so random.

413
00:23:40,645 --> 00:23:41,645
I don't like it.

414
00:23:41,813 --> 00:23:43,819
You might force me to do something nasty.

415
00:23:44,191 --> 00:23:45,442
Then just answer my questions.

416
00:23:45,585 --> 00:23:46,650
It's that easy.

417
00:23:50,447 --> 00:23:51,447
I have an idea.

418
00:23:51,948 --> 00:23:52,948
You have a marker, right?

419
00:23:54,951 --> 00:23:55,952
Question #1.

420
00:23:57,496 --> 00:23:58,496
Where's your mom?

421
00:24:02,042 --> 00:24:03,042
With her new husband.

422
00:24:09,674 --> 00:24:10,842
You're not looking for her?

423
00:24:14,012 --> 00:24:17,307
Why would I look for someone who can't
even protect me when we were together?

424
00:24:23,355 --> 00:24:24,355
Your turn.

425
00:24:29,569 --> 00:24:32,447
Is there a chance that you
and Aries would make up?

426
00:24:42,457 --> 00:24:43,457
Come closer.

427
00:24:44,543 --> 00:24:45,543
Closer.

428
00:24:48,922 --> 00:24:50,382
Is this really the consequence?

429
00:24:51,091 --> 00:24:52,091
So childish.

430
00:24:52,342 --> 00:24:53,342
Let it slide.

431
00:24:53,927 --> 00:24:55,887
So that I could get back for what you did.

432
00:24:56,555 --> 00:24:57,681
You started it.

433
00:24:58,598 --> 00:25:00,725
It's my turn again. You didn't answer.

434
00:25:04,062 --> 00:25:06,857
What's the story behind your earring?

435
00:25:07,816 --> 00:25:09,609
Why do you always wear it?

436
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,906
It belonged to my mom.

437
00:25:17,534 --> 00:25:18,952
When did you start wearing it?

438
00:25:23,081 --> 00:25:26,251
When… we thought Percy died.

439
00:25:29,379 --> 00:25:30,964
I had no one to comfort me.

440
00:25:31,506 --> 00:25:32,506
So...

441
00:25:33,133 --> 00:25:35,719
I went to her room and then I saw this.

442
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:41,224
I feel like… I'm still with her.

443
00:25:42,058 --> 00:25:45,437
So I chose to wear it.

444
00:25:47,647 --> 00:25:48,647
You.

445
00:25:49,816 --> 00:25:50,816
What's with your father?

446
00:25:54,446 --> 00:25:55,780
I didn't grow up with him.

447
00:25:57,532 --> 00:25:58,909
I've only seen him in pictures.

448
00:25:59,576 --> 00:26:00,576
The one I showed you.

449
00:26:02,662 --> 00:26:04,502
That's why I didn't
recognize him immediately.

450
00:26:05,248 --> 00:26:09,502
Grandma said, my Mom's angry at him
that's why they took me away.

451
00:26:11,922 --> 00:26:16,092
My mother had relationships
with good-for-nothing men after him.

452
00:26:16,927 --> 00:26:23,225
That's why I was curious
about my biological father.

453
00:26:24,309 --> 00:26:28,063
So when I finally saw
him, I reacted that way.

454
00:26:31,983 --> 00:26:32,983
Well,

455
00:26:33,652 --> 00:26:35,572
how are you sure he's
not like the rest of them?

456
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:42,786
Just because you're related to your dad
doesn't mean that he's not an asshole.

457
00:26:44,246 --> 00:26:45,580
What do you mean?

458
00:26:46,831 --> 00:26:48,667
My dad was an asshole to me.

459
00:26:49,501 --> 00:26:50,501
To us.

460
00:26:52,754 --> 00:26:56,424
He emotionally and psychologically
scarred Keigan for life.

461
00:26:58,811 --> 00:27:00,345
That's why I'm protective of him.

462
00:27:09,562 --> 00:27:12,274
Where's the other pair of her earrings?

463
00:27:13,066 --> 00:27:14,066
Why don't you wear it?

464
00:27:18,738 --> 00:27:20,282
I gave it away to the wrong person.

465
00:27:21,283 --> 00:27:22,325
Could it be Ella?

466
00:27:31,459 --> 00:27:34,462
If you could only see your face,
you look like a Mexican.

467
00:27:34,754 --> 00:27:37,090
- Mexicano? Latino?
- Yeah.

468
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,340
Spanish?

469
00:27:38,842 --> 00:27:40,467
What are you saying? So dumb.

470
00:27:40,468 --> 00:27:42,405
[in Spanish] Hi, What's
up? My love.  Keifer.

471
00:27:42,429 --> 00:27:44,013
[In Spanish] What's your name?

472
00:27:44,014 --> 00:27:44,848
Like that!

473
00:27:44,848 --> 00:27:45,848
Yeah! (Watch on www.kisskh.la or www.kisskh.co to support Admin)

474
00:27:50,174 --> 00:27:52,397
Now this is my question.

475
00:27:52,689 --> 00:27:53,690
Are you ready?

476
00:27:56,879 --> 00:27:58,755
Why did you and Aries fight?

477
00:28:05,201 --> 00:28:06,578
Okay, here we go.

478
00:28:07,495 --> 00:28:09,539
- You look too happy.
- Of course.

479
00:28:10,623 --> 00:28:12,959
- What's that?
- Relax.

480
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:16,754
Wow!

481
00:28:16,755 --> 00:28:19,382
Okay, wait up. I'm not yet done.

482
00:28:19,966 --> 00:28:21,801
You're making the most of it, huh?

483
00:28:22,773 --> 00:28:24,192
Looks good. Glasses.

484
00:28:26,745 --> 00:28:27,997
My turn.

485
00:28:30,685 --> 00:28:32,812
Who did you give the other pair to?

486
00:28:39,925 --> 00:28:42,428
I think he gave it to Ella.

487
00:28:43,865 --> 00:28:44,865
Come here.

488
00:28:45,408 --> 00:28:46,408
Closer.

489
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:52,082
- You really don't want to answer, huh?
- Ouch.

490
00:28:52,791 --> 00:28:54,334
Ouch! What the hell?

491
00:28:56,878 --> 00:28:58,004
Oh, my turn.

492
00:29:00,808 --> 00:29:03,185
What happened with.. That Cyrus guy?

493
00:29:08,162 --> 00:29:09,162
Drawing.

494
00:29:17,232 --> 00:29:19,192
Make it nice.

495
00:29:20,026 --> 00:29:21,820
You're coloring my face already.

496
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:26,574
- You're just messing with me.
- No, no. Don't worry.

497
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,910
My turn. It's fine. It's fine.

498
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,038
- Suits you.
- Hmm.

499
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:38,086
How did you, Aries, Yuri, and Percy meet?

500
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:44,926
- You know what? In a fight.
- Really?

501
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:51,474
I fought with Yuri because
I was pissed at his face.

502
00:29:52,058 --> 00:29:57,772
And then, Percy arrived
and went to his rescue.

503
00:29:58,314 --> 00:30:03,193
And Aries? He was just walking by.
He got punched by Percy accidentally.

504
00:30:03,194 --> 00:30:06,072
So the four of us got hauled
to the guidance office.

505
00:30:07,073 --> 00:30:08,575
That's a cute bonding.

506
00:30:12,162 --> 00:30:14,080
- My turn.
- Alright.

507
00:30:19,752 --> 00:30:21,337
Was Cyrus a good boyfriend?

508
00:30:23,006 --> 00:30:24,299
Cyrus again?

509
00:30:27,719 --> 00:30:31,723
When we started, yes.
But eventually, he changed.

510
00:30:32,682 --> 00:30:33,850
He has a bad temper.

511
00:30:34,809 --> 00:30:37,937
Easily annoyed. And spoiled.

512
00:30:41,065 --> 00:30:42,150
My turn.

513
00:30:46,154 --> 00:30:49,032
Who's your first girlfriend?

514
00:30:56,206 --> 00:30:57,499
Answer quickly.

515
00:30:57,624 --> 00:30:58,666
Freya.

516
00:30:59,334 --> 00:31:01,461
Huh? How?!

517
00:31:01,753 --> 00:31:03,170
One question at a time.

518
00:31:03,171 --> 00:31:04,214
You wait your turn.

519
00:31:05,089 --> 00:31:06,089
It's my turn now.

520
00:31:07,217 --> 00:31:08,885
Is Cyrus the only boyfriend you've had?

521
00:31:09,594 --> 00:31:11,875
Why won't you let up with all
these questions about Cyrus?

522
00:31:15,892 --> 00:31:18,144
I had a first boyfriend.

523
00:31:21,564 --> 00:31:23,191
But turns out, he was gay.

524
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:29,364
So… he's an ex-girflriend?

525
00:31:30,365 --> 00:31:31,908
Trying to be funny, huh?

526
00:31:36,204 --> 00:31:38,164
- My turn.
- Okay, go.

527
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,291
Why Freya?

528
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,796
- Why Freya?
- Why Freya?

529
00:31:45,964 --> 00:31:47,549
Because I liked her.

530
00:31:49,008 --> 00:31:50,008
Really?

531
00:31:50,176 --> 00:31:51,928
I can't imagine you liking her.

532
00:31:52,303 --> 00:31:54,180
She's not like that before.

533
00:31:58,643 --> 00:31:59,894
Okay, whatever you say.

534
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,480
Alright.

535
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:04,732
My turn.

536
00:32:04,941 --> 00:32:06,651
It's gonna be about Cyrus again, isn't it?

537
00:32:08,736 --> 00:32:10,572
Is David really your type?

538
00:32:13,074 --> 00:32:14,117
No.

539
00:32:14,701 --> 00:32:17,912
I just don't have anyone in mind
that's why I kissed him.

540
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,332
So your kiss with David…
it doesn't mean anything?

541
00:32:23,585 --> 00:32:24,585
So, who?

542
00:32:25,295 --> 00:32:27,547
Who are you falling for? Now.

543
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,800
Do you like Yuri?

544
00:32:33,636 --> 00:32:34,636
I don't know.

545
00:32:35,054 --> 00:32:35,597
Yes?

546
00:32:35,763 --> 00:32:36,763
Maybe?

547
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:39,141
Yuri treats me really nicely.

548
00:32:39,142 --> 00:32:41,686
And he's working hard on his studies.

549
00:32:44,606 --> 00:32:45,606
How about me?

550
00:32:46,274 --> 00:32:47,358
Do you like me?

551
00:32:55,283 --> 00:32:56,492
I don't know.

552
00:32:57,493 --> 00:32:58,828
You annoy me.

553
00:32:59,621 --> 00:33:01,873
You're like possessed and unhinged.

554
00:33:02,206 --> 00:33:03,374
You act insane!

555
00:33:04,042 --> 00:33:05,501
Sometimes, you laugh.

556
00:33:05,668 --> 00:33:08,421
Sometimes, you suddenly get mad at me.

557
00:33:11,633 --> 00:33:13,301
See that? Just like that.

558
00:33:14,886 --> 00:33:17,055
Why do you laugh when I insult you?

559
00:33:18,264 --> 00:33:19,641
You really are an asshole.

560
00:33:19,974 --> 00:33:21,893
And the others take after you.

561
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:24,187
You're their King.

562
00:33:24,646 --> 00:33:25,772
The King of Assholes.

563
00:33:26,356 --> 00:33:27,440
King of what?

564
00:33:28,232 --> 00:33:28,941
Assholes!

565
00:33:29,192 --> 00:33:30,985
- You fucker! Are you deaf?!
- Oops.

566
00:33:32,028 --> 00:33:33,780
Profanity!

567
00:33:34,405 --> 00:33:35,406
For real?

568
00:34:18,449 --> 00:34:20,118
For real.

569
00:34:38,636 --> 00:34:40,304
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

570
00:34:40,555 --> 00:34:43,057
Why did I kiss the King of Assholes?!

571
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:46,269
Good thing we're going to the mall.
It'll take my mind off it.

572
00:34:46,477 --> 00:34:49,021
My God, Jay. You're impossible!
You're even smiling?

573
00:34:49,981 --> 00:34:52,984
- Where are they?
- Do they have like a punching machine?

574
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:54,527
Is that Keigan?

575
00:34:56,988 --> 00:34:58,740
Keigan, what are you doing?

576
00:34:58,948 --> 00:34:59,949
Stay out of it!

577
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:03,619
Will you stop?! What's your problem?

578
00:35:03,911 --> 00:35:04,871
- Keigan!
- Hey!

579
00:35:04,872 --> 00:35:06,330
- Keigan, stop!
- Ci-N, are you okay?

580
00:35:06,456 --> 00:35:07,832
Keifer, your brother!

581
00:35:07,919 --> 00:35:09,292
Oh no! There's a fight!

582
00:35:10,001 --> 00:35:11,252
- What?!
- Fuck you!

583
00:35:11,586 --> 00:35:14,880
- Keifer!
- Keigan! Keigan!

584
00:35:14,881 --> 00:35:15,922
Jay, what's going on?

585
00:35:15,923 --> 00:35:16,924
What are you doing?!

586
00:35:17,066 --> 00:35:18,818
I have nothing I need to explain to you!

587
00:35:19,156 --> 00:35:20,719
- Let him explain!
- Me?!

588
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,890
I said. What are you doing here?!

589
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,970
I wanted to teach this guy a lesson.

590
00:35:26,309 --> 00:35:27,602
He won't leave my girl alone!

591
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,468
You're the one who should stay away!

592
00:35:30,062 --> 00:35:31,063
You're crazy!

593
00:35:31,689 --> 00:35:34,709
Keigan! Mind your brother. Stop them!

594
00:35:34,734 --> 00:35:37,361
Won't you stop your brother, Keifer?!

595
00:35:38,029 --> 00:35:41,824
Keifer, stop them now! Pacify your brother!

596
00:35:42,033 --> 00:35:43,993
Let them sort it out. Let them fight.

597
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:46,996
If they're fighting over a girl,
let them fight over a girl.

598
00:35:47,166 --> 00:35:48,414
What are you saying?!

599
00:35:48,539 --> 00:35:50,917
Stop them! Stop them, Rory!

600
00:35:51,125 --> 00:35:54,044
Jay, it's useless.
Keigan will just get triggered.

601
00:35:54,045 --> 00:35:55,171
What?

602
00:35:57,256 --> 00:35:59,633
- Blaster! Blaster!
- It's Blaster!

603
00:35:59,634 --> 00:36:01,844
Stop them! Blaster!

604
00:36:02,275 --> 00:36:03,971
What are you doing there?! Stop them!

605
00:36:05,473 --> 00:36:07,600
- Take Blaster away!
- Hey!

606
00:36:08,059 --> 00:36:10,812
- What's your problem?!
- You jerks! Stop them!

607
00:36:11,521 --> 00:36:14,147
What the hell are you doing?!

608
00:36:14,148 --> 00:36:15,732
- Stop it!
- Get out of there!

609
00:36:15,733 --> 00:36:17,567
- You get out!
- One versus two?

610
00:36:17,568 --> 00:36:18,735
Are you brothers out of your mind?

611
00:36:18,736 --> 00:36:19,779
What did you say?

612
00:36:20,655 --> 00:36:21,697
Keigan!

613
00:36:23,034 --> 00:36:24,055
Are you alright?

614
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,081
You shouldn't have done that.
What if you got hurt?

615
00:36:26,369 --> 00:36:28,369
What were you thinking
trying to act like a shield?

616
00:36:28,881 --> 00:36:29,881
You!

617
00:36:30,164 --> 00:36:33,665
Instead of stopping them,
you let it happen! Aren't you so good?

618
00:36:33,709 --> 00:36:36,087
You know how protective
I am over my brother!

619
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:37,295
Protective for what?!

620
00:36:37,296 --> 00:36:38,548
He started it!

621
00:36:38,756 --> 00:36:41,008
Fine! Side against us! Shit!

622
00:36:41,551 --> 00:36:42,551
Piece of shit!

623
00:36:42,927 --> 00:36:45,047
- Who are you calling a piece of shit?!
- Both of you!

624
00:36:45,763 --> 00:36:48,391
At least I don't let my friends get hurt!

625
00:36:48,712 --> 00:36:52,228
Oh, well. You don't see Yuri as a friend,
right?! He's just a 'piece of shit.'

626
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,044
Stay with your brother!

627
00:36:54,205 --> 00:36:56,440
You don't know
what Keigan is going through!

628
00:36:57,859 --> 00:37:01,529
Whatever it is he's going through, it
doesn't give him the right to hurt others!

629
00:37:01,821 --> 00:37:04,031
You're friends with Yuri too! With Blaster!

630
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,756
I thought we're going to the mall?

631
00:37:20,882 --> 00:37:24,092
This is better.
So you can all cool your heads.

632
00:37:24,093 --> 00:37:25,928
- Yeah.
- Because you're all rich kids.

633
00:37:26,137 --> 00:37:28,139
[boys chattering]

634
00:37:28,514 --> 00:37:31,601
- Is this yours?
- You don't have any food left. Go buy some.

635
00:37:32,852 --> 00:37:35,021
- Payment?
- Okay, I'll pay it. Go buy some.

636
00:37:38,941 --> 00:37:40,568
- Jay?
- Uhm?

637
00:37:40,985 --> 00:37:42,778
I'm sorry about what happened earlier.

638
00:37:43,446 --> 00:37:46,449
I know that kid has some issues..
I should have let it slide.

639
00:37:48,701 --> 00:37:50,369
So Keigan's condition is true.

640
00:37:52,456 --> 00:37:55,541
You know, you shouldn't be apologizing.

641
00:37:56,167 --> 00:37:58,336
You were the one who
was called a "piece of shit."

642
00:37:59,212 --> 00:38:02,256
It's as if you don't know how Keifer talks.
It's just the way he is.

643
00:38:02,627 --> 00:38:04,555
Add the fact that I was
having mixed emotions.

644
00:38:05,676 --> 00:38:06,886
Ci is right.

645
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:09,126
That's just how Keifer is.

646
00:38:10,223 --> 00:38:11,583
For sure, he's feeling guilty now.

647
00:38:11,891 --> 00:38:13,051
With all that he said to you.

648
00:38:13,309 --> 00:38:14,852
Oh? Is it my fault?

649
00:38:17,647 --> 00:38:20,524
You know, Jay, I understand Keifer.

650
00:38:21,776 --> 00:38:24,862
Because if that would
happen to my sibling too…

651
00:38:25,154 --> 00:38:27,156
I wouldn't know what I would have done.

652
00:38:31,869 --> 00:38:35,748
But don't you treat
each other as siblings already?

653
00:38:36,707 --> 00:38:37,792
All of Section E.

654
00:38:38,584 --> 00:38:42,964
After all you've been
through a lot together.

655
00:38:47,551 --> 00:38:49,594
Hey, Denzel. I thought
you're buying something?

656
00:38:49,595 --> 00:38:50,971
Wait. Just wait.

657
00:38:50,972 --> 00:38:51,722
You're too slow.

658
00:38:51,722 --> 00:38:52,722
Oh?

659
00:38:53,265 --> 00:38:55,141
I'll buy some kikiam. I love those.

660
00:38:55,142 --> 00:38:56,643
- Is it okay?
- Go buy it.

661
00:38:56,644 --> 00:38:57,895
Aren't you ashamed?

662
00:38:58,479 --> 00:39:01,482
- Buy me some too! Kikiam with no sauce!
- Sure.

663
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,363
Why are you like that?

664
00:39:07,863 --> 00:39:09,865
What do you mean?

665
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:13,285
You're so nice.

666
00:39:13,869 --> 00:39:16,163
You're understanding.
It's kinda annoying.

667
00:39:16,831 --> 00:39:20,681
- Oh, so you don't want me to be nice?
- That's not what I meant.

668
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:26,090
What I'm saying is that you're too good.
People might take advantage of that.

669
00:39:26,299 --> 00:39:27,924
Do you want me to go
back to how I was before?

670
00:39:27,925 --> 00:39:28,925
No.

671
00:39:29,176 --> 00:39:30,970
I like it when you're true to yourself.

672
00:39:31,804 --> 00:39:33,848
Oh. So you like me?

673
00:39:37,184 --> 00:39:38,936
- [in Japanese] I love you.
- Huh?

674
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:40,770
Nothing.

675
00:39:41,313 --> 00:39:44,525
I said Keifer's just like that
when it comes to his siblings.

676
00:39:45,568 --> 00:39:48,904
And with the people he loves.
He's ready to fight for them.

677
00:39:51,407 --> 00:39:52,408
Whatever.

678
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:54,493
He's still wrong.

679
00:39:55,494 --> 00:39:57,974
But I do wish that everyone
has someone who can fight for them.

680
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,544
Hey,

681
00:40:03,919 --> 00:40:04,919
Hey, Keif.

682
00:40:05,796 --> 00:40:06,964
- What the hell?
- Blaster.

683
00:40:07,298 --> 00:40:08,339
- Why is he here?
- You good?

684
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,340
I'm good.

685
00:40:09,467 --> 00:40:10,467
I'm fine.

686
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:14,387
You shake hands as if nothing happened.

687
00:40:14,388 --> 00:40:16,640
So Latina!

688
00:40:16,974 --> 00:40:18,850
No need. I'll order now.

689
00:40:18,851 --> 00:40:19,851
Hi, sir. (Watch on www.kisskh.la or www.kisskh.co to support Admin)

690
00:40:19,894 --> 00:40:20,978
Miss, how much is one?

691
00:40:21,604 --> 00:40:24,106
- 24, sir.
- 24, okay.

692
00:40:24,315 --> 00:40:25,483
I'll buy the whole cart.

693
00:40:25,649 --> 00:40:29,152
Give it to everyone wearing a uniform.
But prioritize that table first.

694
00:40:29,153 --> 00:40:29,862
Alright.

695
00:40:30,071 --> 00:40:31,551
Can you bring our order to the table?

696
00:40:32,531 --> 00:40:33,866
- Thank you, Sir.
- Okay.

697
00:40:42,333 --> 00:40:43,709
Ma'am, here's your order.

698
00:40:44,168 --> 00:40:47,671
- Ma'am, you're so pretty.
- So Latina!

699
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,681
Just eat it. It's getting cold.

700
00:41:03,896 --> 00:41:05,523
Okay. What do you want?

701
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:12,530
Say the magic word first.

702
00:41:13,572 --> 00:41:15,616
What do you we say
when we make a mistake?

703
00:41:16,659 --> 00:41:17,785
Not gonna happen?

704
00:41:18,702 --> 00:41:19,787
What am I, a kid?

705
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,080
Okay.

706
00:41:22,206 --> 00:41:23,916
Then remove that in front of me.

707
00:41:27,002 --> 00:41:28,003
Are you sure?

708
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:30,088
Such a waste.

709
00:41:30,297 --> 00:41:31,297
Give it to me.

710
00:41:40,558 --> 00:41:41,558
By the way,

711
00:41:41,892 --> 00:41:44,103
I'm still gonna help you about your father.

712
00:41:45,479 --> 00:41:46,479
How?

713
00:41:47,064 --> 00:41:48,816
I called a few times.

714
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:51,235
But they still won't give the information.

715
00:41:52,361 --> 00:41:53,487
I have my ways.

716
00:42:13,154 --> 00:42:15,740
We have to declare bankruptcy in Guam.

717
00:42:17,052 --> 00:42:18,554
What's our plan?

718
00:42:20,347 --> 00:42:21,347
I don't know.

719
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,351
Even our office in
Singapore is having problems.

720
00:42:25,561 --> 00:42:26,854
What's gonna happen to us?

721
00:42:30,232 --> 00:42:31,442
We could lose everything.

722
00:42:34,153 --> 00:42:35,446
Unless we find a solution.

723
00:42:47,291 --> 00:42:48,291
Oh,

724
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:50,719
Auntie. I didn't know
you were already here.

725
00:42:52,504 --> 00:42:54,006
I just arrived, Jay.

726
00:42:54,506 --> 00:42:55,841
We just haven't seen each other.

727
00:42:56,884 --> 00:42:57,884
How are you?

728
00:43:00,262 --> 00:43:02,848
You've been going home late.
Were you on a date?

729
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:04,558
No, I wasn't.

730
00:43:06,185 --> 00:43:07,520
Jay, give us a moment please?

731
00:43:08,062 --> 00:43:09,480
We have something to discuss.

732
00:43:11,357 --> 00:43:12,357
Sure.

733
00:43:21,367 --> 00:43:25,579
Angelo, if there's anything I can
do to help. Please let me know.

734
00:43:31,919 --> 00:43:33,671
I remember the Hanamitchis.

735
00:43:33,921 --> 00:43:35,506
They offered a business deal before,

736
00:43:37,091 --> 00:43:38,091
To help us.

737
00:43:38,509 --> 00:43:39,509
But,

738
00:43:42,096 --> 00:43:43,138
It's complicated.

739
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:03,492
Uh… Jay. I want to invite you.

740
00:44:05,369 --> 00:44:06,495
Where?

741
00:44:07,037 --> 00:44:10,499
There's a new cafe that I want to go to.

742
00:44:11,583 --> 00:44:12,583
Wanna come?

743
00:44:16,964 --> 00:44:18,048
Is it good there?

744
00:44:21,539 --> 00:44:22,539
Sure.

745
00:44:24,805 --> 00:44:26,432
- Hey! What's happening?!
- Hey!

746
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:30,853
Hey! Stop! Stop it!

747
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:32,146
Stop it now!

748
00:44:34,898 --> 00:44:37,067
You got the nerve to fight
here in the main building?

749
00:44:37,901 --> 00:44:40,195
Go back to Section E! We'll
talk there later. Wait for me.

750
00:44:40,571 --> 00:44:41,155
Let's go!

751
00:44:41,447 --> 00:44:42,447
Fuck you!

752
00:44:42,948 --> 00:44:43,948
Go back there.

753
00:44:44,241 --> 00:44:44,825
Come on.

754
00:44:44,826 --> 00:44:46,452
- Fuck you!
- Eren, chill.

755
00:44:47,953 --> 00:44:48,454
Your phone.

756
00:44:48,579 --> 00:44:49,579
[phone unlocks]

757
00:44:51,999 --> 00:44:52,999
Why, Jay? What's up?

758
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:54,500
Nothing.

759
00:44:55,413 --> 00:44:57,415
Let's go back to Section E.

760
00:44:58,839 --> 00:44:59,839
Come on.

761
00:45:09,016 --> 00:45:12,061
Are Mayo and Kit really dating?
I must be overreacting!

762
00:45:12,728 --> 00:45:15,064
That could be just a friendly,
innocent kiss on the cheek.

763
00:45:15,731 --> 00:45:17,607
But they were the ones
I saw kissing each other

764
00:45:17,608 --> 00:45:19,688
- when I was on night duty!
- Is that delicious, Jay?

765
00:45:20,069 --> 00:45:21,779
Friends don't do that.

766
00:45:22,029 --> 00:45:23,238
How does that taste?

767
00:45:23,739 --> 00:45:24,739
It's good.

768
00:45:24,823 --> 00:45:27,703
Well, you and Keifer are just friends,
and yet you're kissing each other.

769
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:29,500
Didn't know air could be this tasty, Jay.

770
00:45:38,045 --> 00:45:40,589
What is bugging you? Tell me.

771
00:45:42,132 --> 00:45:43,132
Nothing.

772
00:45:43,801 --> 00:45:45,761
Just random things running in my head.

773
00:45:46,678 --> 00:45:48,889
You still don't trust me, don't you?

774
00:45:50,682 --> 00:45:52,101
It's not that I don't.

775
00:45:52,643 --> 00:45:54,103
I just haven't tried trusting you.

776
00:45:56,105 --> 00:45:57,105
Joke.

777
00:45:57,439 --> 00:45:58,439
I'm kidding.

778
00:45:58,941 --> 00:46:01,734
When everything is cleared,
and I'm already sure...

779
00:46:01,735 --> 00:46:03,095
Promise, I'll tell you everything.

780
00:46:06,698 --> 00:46:07,698
Hey.

781
00:46:08,951 --> 00:46:09,951
Are you sulking.

782
00:46:13,664 --> 00:46:15,874
Oh, so you're really sulking.

783
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:20,421
Let's see how a Yuri Hanamitchi
looks when he's upset.

784
00:46:20,546 --> 00:46:23,132
- Stop it.
- Let me see.

785
00:46:24,716 --> 00:46:27,553
- Stop it, Jay.
- You're just pretending, aren't you?

786
00:46:31,849 --> 00:46:32,849
Oh?

787
00:46:33,684 --> 00:46:35,811
I'm not even upset with you.

788
00:46:36,687 --> 00:46:38,397
Why are you stuttering?

789
00:46:38,939 --> 00:46:40,566
You look cute that way.

790
00:46:44,278 --> 00:46:45,278
Oh,

791
00:46:47,865 --> 00:46:49,241
So you get upset easily, huh?

792
00:46:50,033 --> 00:46:51,243
What are you doing, Jay?

793
00:46:51,869 --> 00:46:53,412
Because you're upset.

794
00:46:53,787 --> 00:46:55,038
- Oh.
- No.

795
00:46:55,372 --> 00:46:58,125
Such a baby.

796
00:47:01,962 --> 00:47:04,006
- Jay! You need to come with me.
- Keifer?

797
00:47:05,048 --> 00:47:05,466
Huh?

798
00:47:05,716 --> 00:47:07,156
What's the problem? We were talking.

799
00:47:07,426 --> 00:47:09,821
It's about my promise to bring you back
to Hemilton University.

800
00:47:09,845 --> 00:47:11,263
I got a pass just now.

801
00:47:11,472 --> 00:47:13,700
- So we need to go now before he goes away.
- Really? Now?

802
00:47:13,724 --> 00:47:14,724
We have no more time.

803
00:47:14,778 --> 00:47:16,536
I just found out something.
Before he go, let's go.

804
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,560
Let's go. Come on.

805
00:47:17,644 --> 00:47:18,644
Jay. Jay. Jay.

806
00:47:18,896 --> 00:47:21,216
- We need to go.
- Yuri. Yuri, I just need to do this.

807
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:22,770
Jay.

808
00:47:23,525 --> 00:47:26,361
I just need to go to my dad.
I hope you understand.

809
00:47:27,404 --> 00:47:29,948
- I'll come back.
- I understand, Jay.

810
00:47:31,033 --> 00:47:32,451
I'll wait here, okay?

811
00:47:33,368 --> 00:47:35,871
But please, Jay. Come back. Please.

812
00:47:36,872 --> 00:47:38,415
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

813
00:48:27,923 --> 00:48:28,923
Ma'am?

814
00:48:29,508 --> 00:48:30,508
Ma'am?

815
00:48:30,816 --> 00:48:33,652
Do you know where Mr. Jasfher Mariano is?

816
00:48:34,137 --> 00:48:36,139
We went to his room,
and he wasn't there.

817
00:48:36,684 --> 00:48:38,246
He already left earlier.

818
00:48:39,893 --> 00:48:43,772
Maybe I can have his
contact number or address?

819
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:49,570
I'm sorry but we can't give
personal information of our board members.

820
00:48:49,787 --> 00:48:50,787
Look, Miss.

821
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:54,658
We really don't have time.
We need to speak to him now.

822
00:48:54,992 --> 00:48:56,034
I'm his daughter.

823
00:48:56,535 --> 00:48:57,828
I'm his daughter.

824
00:48:59,621 --> 00:49:00,914
Here, look.

825
00:49:02,583 --> 00:49:07,170
This is me. This is him.
I'm Jasper Jean Mariano.

826
00:49:08,171 --> 00:49:11,466
Maybe you can tell me. I'm his family.

827
00:49:12,342 --> 00:49:14,469
Like I said, he already left.

828
00:49:14,678 --> 00:49:18,557
And I think it's now his boarding time.
He's probably aboard the plane.

829
00:49:19,057 --> 00:49:20,851
I'm so sorry but I have to go.

830
00:49:21,268 --> 00:49:22,268
Excuse me.

831
00:49:29,610 --> 00:49:30,610
Airplane?

832
00:49:40,162 --> 00:49:41,162
Too late.

833
00:49:42,331 --> 00:49:43,540
Keifer...

834
00:49:47,085 --> 00:49:51,173
Earlier, when I told you he's leaving,
it doesn't mean leaving the school.

835
00:49:53,925 --> 00:49:56,845
I got the news that he
was leaving for good.

836
00:49:58,889 --> 00:50:00,974
Maybe we can go to him?

837
00:50:02,517 --> 00:50:05,144
To the airport.
Maybe we can catch up to him.

838
00:50:05,145 --> 00:50:07,314
Do you really not know where he's going?

839
00:50:08,065 --> 00:50:11,485
- What terminal could it be?
- I'm sorry, Jay.

840
00:50:12,027 --> 00:50:13,487
I should've acted faster.

841
00:50:14,279 --> 00:50:15,839
Maybe we could have caught up with him.

842
00:50:19,618 --> 00:50:20,661
It's okay.

843
00:50:20,786 --> 00:50:22,788
It's okay.

844
00:50:23,789 --> 00:50:24,789
It's okay.

845
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,040
It's okay.

846
00:50:28,001 --> 00:50:29,001
It's okay.

847
00:50:31,129 --> 00:50:32,381
I'm sorry.

848
00:50:54,277 --> 00:50:55,277
Yuri.

849
00:50:56,822 --> 00:50:57,822
Jay...

850
00:51:01,417 --> 00:51:02,417
Sorry.

851
00:51:03,765 --> 00:51:04,765
It's okay.

852
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:06,580
The important thing is you came back.

853
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:10,355
I've been gone for a few hours.
You still waited for me.

854
00:51:10,939 --> 00:51:14,192
I told you, remember?
I'm ready to wait for you.

855
00:51:14,651 --> 00:51:16,570
I will always be here for you, Jay.

856
00:51:17,696 --> 00:51:18,697
You're too much.

857
00:51:20,532 --> 00:51:22,158
Sit down.

858
00:51:43,013 --> 00:51:44,013
Jay...

859
00:51:45,056 --> 00:51:48,476
I want you to think
about what you feel for Keifer.

860
00:51:50,061 --> 00:51:51,730
Why are you suddenly saying that?

861
00:51:55,734 --> 00:51:57,110
For you.

862
00:52:34,856 --> 00:52:35,857
Yuri...

863
00:52:39,152 --> 00:52:40,153
Before…

864
00:52:41,738 --> 00:52:46,993
I didn't know if I would deny or confirm,

865
00:52:48,036 --> 00:52:49,913
my feelings for you.

866
00:52:52,666 --> 00:52:53,666
But now, Jay,

867
00:52:55,543 --> 00:52:56,920
it's probably obvious.

868
00:52:58,546 --> 00:52:59,964
I hope you think about it.

869
00:53:04,678 --> 00:53:05,887
What is this?

870
00:53:06,888 --> 00:53:08,390
What's the meaning of this?

871
00:53:10,475 --> 00:53:14,229
This is me trying to take
control of the situation.

872
00:53:16,147 --> 00:53:18,066
I'm tired of not being in control.

873
00:53:19,859 --> 00:53:21,361
With what I feel.

874
00:53:23,363 --> 00:53:24,614
With what I want.

875
00:53:27,033 --> 00:53:28,493
And who I want, Jay.

876
00:53:32,956 --> 00:53:33,956
Yuri.

877
00:53:38,837 --> 00:53:39,837
Jay...

878
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:47,887
I will never hurt you.

879
00:54:20,754 --> 00:54:22,338
I'll go ahead, Jay.

880
00:55:31,825 --> 00:55:34,719
Is that a ring? Where did it come from?
Who gave it to you?

881
00:55:34,744 --> 00:55:37,764
From someone whose thoughts
I don't really understand.

882
00:55:37,789 --> 00:55:40,333
Whoever gave it to you,
he loves you.

883
00:55:40,583 --> 00:55:44,127
- What are you guys up to?
- It's Christmas! We're decorating.

884
00:55:44,128 --> 00:55:48,383
We have our own Christmas party because
the other sections excluded us again.

885
00:55:48,508 --> 00:55:50,384
They're gonna party at
the hotel, but us, here.

886
00:55:50,385 --> 00:55:54,138
Let's begin the… Christmas Party!

887
00:55:55,181 --> 00:55:56,390
Is your gift ready?

888
00:55:56,391 --> 00:55:57,141
Who did you pick?

889
00:55:57,142 --> 00:55:58,642
His codename's Bluetooth.

890
00:55:58,643 --> 00:56:01,687
Okay, is everyone ready?
Let's play the…

891
00:56:01,688 --> 00:56:02,772
Stop Dance!

892
00:56:04,065 --> 00:56:05,816
- The ring is pretty.
- Did you like it?

893
00:56:05,817 --> 00:56:07,359
Why did you give it to me?

894
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:08,838
Where's the roasted chicken I bought?!

895
00:56:08,862 --> 00:56:11,489
Oh, that kid! Where's Ci-N?!

896
00:56:12,156 --> 00:56:14,868
- What's happening?
- Can you pretend to be my girlfriend?

897
00:56:15,118 --> 00:56:16,238
Do you want to kiss my fist?

898
00:56:16,411 --> 00:56:19,831
- Bring me… something cute.
- Oh, why me?

899
00:56:20,039 --> 00:56:22,542
- Your pigtails are cute.
- Bring me…

900
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:23,959
Something...

901
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:25,335
You...

902
00:56:25,336 --> 00:56:26,421
Love!

903
00:56:27,547 --> 00:56:29,214
Why are you always carrying me?!

904
00:56:29,215 --> 00:56:30,466
Cause I'm in love with Jay-jay.
