1
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:21,785
Mom just left, she went to Guam.

2
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,123
You and Aries should
take care of yourselves.

3
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:25,045
Because it's just gonna
be the two of us here,

4
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,117
you can't leave without
asking for permission.

5
00:00:27,183 --> 00:00:29,593
And you'll inform me about
who you're hanging out with.

6
00:00:30,048 --> 00:00:31,674
Jasper Jean Mariano.

7
00:00:31,968 --> 00:00:32,989
That's not mine.

8
00:00:33,014 --> 00:00:34,724
Hey, Denzel.
What are you doing there?

9
00:00:35,307 --> 00:00:36,475
Two red lines...

10
00:00:36,475 --> 00:00:37,616
Positive!

11
00:00:38,059 --> 00:00:39,335
Denzel's pregnant?!

12
00:00:39,603 --> 00:00:40,998
Ah! Mr. Fernandez.

13
00:00:41,023 --> 00:00:43,359
The test results came back negative.

14
00:00:46,253 --> 00:00:47,296
Your faces!

15
00:00:48,464 --> 00:00:49,965
I should've taken a video.

16
00:00:50,286 --> 00:00:51,952
Have pity on me.

17
00:00:53,181 --> 00:00:54,416
Is it really mine?

18
00:00:54,553 --> 00:00:55,763
How could you ask me that?!

19
00:00:55,763 --> 00:00:57,932
- Denzel!
- What are you doing here?

20
00:00:58,057 --> 00:00:59,475
What do you want to talk about?

21
00:00:59,475 --> 00:01:01,435
What if you got your girlfriend
pregnant? What will you do?

22
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,688
It's Denzel. He doesn't want to take
responsibility for Grace.

23
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:05,041
Can you talk to him?

24
00:01:05,314 --> 00:01:06,524
Thanks for taking me here.

25
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:08,567
- Why are you here?
- Jay-jay needs to talk to you.

26
00:01:08,674 --> 00:01:10,002
I just used Grace.

27
00:01:10,027 --> 00:01:12,113
She won't forgive me
once she finds out the truth.

28
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,807
You're a liar.

29
00:01:21,455 --> 00:01:23,249
- Grace!
- Grace, hey!

30
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,392
Get down from there!

31
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:25,518
Hey!

32
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:28,236
- Please, let's talk about this!
- Don't come near me!

33
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:29,922
Stay away!

34
00:01:30,297 --> 00:01:32,925
Grace, let's talk. Please, get down.

35
00:01:33,345 --> 00:01:34,384
Grace, please!

36
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:36,838
Your problems won't get solved this way.

37
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,041
I will really jump if you get close!

38
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,096
- Grace, please!
- Grace!

39
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:42,916
Please don't do this!

40
00:01:43,644 --> 00:01:45,312
I know you're hurting.

41
00:01:45,794 --> 00:01:47,221
And you feel like you're alone.

42
00:01:47,569 --> 00:01:49,404
But open your heart.

43
00:01:50,025 --> 00:01:52,528
There are people who want to help you.

44
00:01:53,028 --> 00:01:55,114
Don't give up. Don't lose hope.

45
00:01:55,531 --> 00:01:57,450
Don't get trapped in the past.

46
00:01:58,325 --> 00:02:00,369
What's important is the present.

47
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:02,079
And what you'll do tomorrow.

48
00:02:05,908 --> 00:02:07,201
Grace, please.

49
00:02:16,927 --> 00:02:18,179
I don't want to!

50
00:02:18,554 --> 00:02:19,613
Grace, please!

51
00:02:19,638 --> 00:02:20,658
Come on!

52
00:02:20,931 --> 00:02:22,299
We're wasting our time here!

53
00:02:22,683 --> 00:02:23,868
Just jump.

54
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:24,994
Keif!

55
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,454
- What's wrong with you?!
- Go ahead! Jump!

56
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,373
- Keifer!
- You're going to jump, right? Go ahead!

57
00:02:29,398 --> 00:02:31,525
- Grace, no.
- No one cares about you anyway.

58
00:02:32,234 --> 00:02:33,694
That's not true.

59
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:35,196
That's a lie!

60
00:02:35,654 --> 00:02:36,986
So, what's the matter?

61
00:02:38,282 --> 00:02:39,299
Look.

62
00:02:39,932 --> 00:02:41,783
I know you're used to hurting others.

63
00:02:42,507 --> 00:02:44,676
But even the ones you love, you wanna hurt?

64
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,057
Is that who you are?

65
00:02:47,249 --> 00:02:48,417
Huh, Grace Miller?

66
00:02:48,442 --> 00:02:51,921
Grace, please, come down
and let's talk about this.

67
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:57,927
Grace, please, get down here.

68
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:00,471
Grace, let's talk.

69
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:04,058
Grace, please.

70
00:03:04,433 --> 00:03:06,727
Come down here, let's talk this through.

71
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:09,063
Grace...

72
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:31,126
We need to talk.

73
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,796
Yes, we'll talk about this.

74
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:37,007
Come now, stop crying.

75
00:03:42,721 --> 00:03:44,723
I wish it were that easy.

76
00:03:45,145 --> 00:03:48,382
I wish I also have someone
beside me to dry my tears.

77
00:04:08,405 --> 00:04:11,077
Daleng Dale
Performed by: GAT

78
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,378
That's nice!

79
00:05:37,836 --> 00:05:38,847
So cool.

80
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:46,710
Denzel's not here. Maybe he and Grace
are fixing their problems.

81
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:49,316
Hey, Jerk.

82
00:05:49,341 --> 00:05:50,407
I'm talking to you.

83
00:05:50,432 --> 00:05:51,847
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

84
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:54,168
You really enjoy meddling, huh?

85
00:05:54,418 --> 00:05:55,789
You three, you're full of shit.

86
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:57,532
What do you mean?
We're not doing anything.

87
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,111
Felix. Want some chocolate?

88
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,199
Here.

89
00:06:13,368 --> 00:06:15,918
Why is it that some people are saved,
while some are not?

90
00:06:17,292 --> 00:06:18,308
What?

91
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:20,646
I don't get it.

92
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,880
We saved Grace, right?

93
00:06:22,172 --> 00:06:23,191
Exactly.

94
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:24,842
But my brother?

95
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,472
No one bothered saving him, Jay.

96
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:33,434
He's the one who didn't want to die.
But nobody came to save him.

97
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:36,457
Has the world turned upside down?

98
00:06:39,064 --> 00:06:41,108
What are you saying?

99
00:06:41,369 --> 00:06:42,537
He was killed, Jay!

100
00:06:43,068 --> 00:06:44,263
Murdered!

101
00:06:47,614 --> 00:06:48,646
By who?

102
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:50,873
Aries!

103
00:06:51,326 --> 00:06:52,326
Your cousin.

104
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,329
Your murderer cousin, Jay!

105
00:06:54,329 --> 00:06:56,232
He's the one who killed my brother!

106
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:01,895
And all of you!

107
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,920
Huh!

108
00:07:03,213 --> 00:07:05,357
All of you wanted to save Grace!

109
00:07:05,382 --> 00:07:07,301
But how about my brother? Huh!

110
00:07:07,801 --> 00:07:09,498
No one dared to save him!

111
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:28,781
Just let him be, Jay.
Give him space for now.

112
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:31,756
Okay.

113
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,136
Hey.

114
00:07:34,161 --> 00:07:35,576
That "okay" wasn't sincere.

115
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:38,709
You're gonna go to him, right? I know you.

116
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,826
Don't do it, Jay. Just let him be.

117
00:07:41,835 --> 00:07:43,337
Alright, fine. Not today.

118
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:47,382
But tell me where he
usually goes to be alone.

119
00:07:47,848 --> 00:07:49,777
Some place I can show
up at, without annoying him.

120
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,849
- I told you to give him space.
- Come on, just tell me.

121
00:07:53,555 --> 00:07:54,932
- Please.
- I can't.

122
00:08:01,313 --> 00:08:02,553
I have chocolates, by the way.

123
00:08:04,373 --> 00:08:05,388
Let's chat later.

124
00:08:11,756 --> 00:08:12,756
Okay.

125
00:08:44,379 --> 00:08:45,381
Uhm...

126
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:49,100
If you want to say something
just spit it out. What is it?

127
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:51,404
Okay.

128
00:08:52,072 --> 00:08:53,100
The thing is...

129
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:54,783
Uhh... about...

130
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:56,077
What is it now?

131
00:08:56,785 --> 00:08:58,288
Do you know Felix's brother?

132
00:09:01,957 --> 00:09:03,000
Y-Yes.

133
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,252
What did you do to him?

134
00:09:05,713 --> 00:09:08,006
It's none of your business.
Stop snooping around.

135
00:09:09,673 --> 00:09:11,772
Aries, I'm getting caught
in the middle of your fight.

136
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,577
How can I not get involved?

137
00:09:14,052 --> 00:09:15,571
What should I do, turn a blind eye?

138
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,406
I need to hear it from you!

139
00:09:17,438 --> 00:09:18,438
Give me a break.

140
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:19,881
I want to know!

141
00:09:20,392 --> 00:09:22,728
What did you do to Section E
for them to hate you so much?

142
00:09:22,753 --> 00:09:24,621
What did you do to Felix's brother?

143
00:09:24,646 --> 00:09:26,475
You really want to know, huh?

144
00:09:26,523 --> 00:09:27,530
Is this what you want?

145
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:29,734
Percy.

146
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,824
Percy was his brother's name.

147
00:09:37,576 --> 00:09:40,288
And I'm not the one to
blame for his death, okay?

148
00:09:41,663 --> 00:09:42,663
Satisfied?

149
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,091
He's crying? Why?

150
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,345
I've never seen him cry before.

151
00:09:57,304 --> 00:10:01,058
I didn't mean it. I just
want to get to the truth.

152
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,011
Shoot! You're so good!

153
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,162
You're the one who blew up without reason.

154
00:10:47,187 --> 00:10:48,977
I didn't know you're
good at basketball.

155
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,641
I was in the varsity before. Why?

156
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,922
What do you need?

157
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:58,727
I just want to talk to you.

158
00:11:01,368 --> 00:11:02,860
How did you know about this place?

159
00:11:03,161 --> 00:11:05,477
You really went out of
your way to come here, huh?

160
00:11:05,747 --> 00:11:07,438
Do you get some kind
of kick from meddling?

161
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,446
Then what should I do?

162
00:11:10,085 --> 00:11:12,421
You're the one who blew up without reason.

163
00:11:13,088 --> 00:11:14,172
Just leave.

164
00:11:15,507 --> 00:11:18,635
No. It was difficult biking to this place.

165
00:11:18,802 --> 00:11:19,891
You gotta talk to me!

166
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:21,641
Jay, please!

167
00:11:21,954 --> 00:11:23,198
Explain it to me.

168
00:11:23,223 --> 00:11:24,725
Okay, you're mad at Aries.

169
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:27,391
But why do you have to get mad at me too?

170
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,149
Because you remind me of him!

171
00:11:29,896 --> 00:11:32,172
I see the person who destroyed my family!

172
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,568
I understand you're mad, but--

173
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:36,836
You don't understand, Jay! Please!

174
00:11:37,487 --> 00:11:39,868
Could you stop meddling
in other people's lives?

175
00:11:40,198 --> 00:11:41,500
As if you know everything!

176
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:43,938
I'm meddling because I need to!

177
00:11:43,971 --> 00:11:46,219
You're meddling because
that's just what you are!

178
00:12:09,436 --> 00:12:11,438
My stepbrother died because of Aries.

179
00:12:13,106 --> 00:12:15,067
And because of that, our parents separated.

180
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,071
Sorry.

181
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,577
But you don't have to get angry at me.

182
00:12:29,456 --> 00:12:30,466
I know.

183
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:34,052
I just can't help hating
everyone that's close to him, Jay.

184
00:12:34,807 --> 00:12:38,216
- Felix...
- Jay, you don't have to explain.

185
00:12:39,591 --> 00:12:40,607
I understand.

186
00:12:41,009 --> 00:12:42,021
You're right.

187
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,429
I shouldn't have directed
my anger towards you.

188
00:12:45,325 --> 00:12:46,325
That was wrong.

189
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:50,102
I know you want to ask more questions, Jay.

190
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:52,146
Ask away.

191
00:12:53,018 --> 00:12:55,591
But wouldn't it be better
if we talk about it some other time?

192
00:13:01,028 --> 00:13:02,028
You know...

193
00:13:02,864 --> 00:13:05,909
everything came back to me
when we were at the bridge.

194
00:13:06,154 --> 00:13:07,911
Grace, don't do it!

195
00:13:08,495 --> 00:13:11,014
I know you're hurting. And
you feel like you're alone.

196
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,707
But open your heart.

197
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:15,004
There are people who want to help you.

198
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,084
You know, you did good back there.

199
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:23,084
I should've been happy that Grace was
saved, but I can't help feeling envious...

200
00:13:25,053 --> 00:13:26,740
Because I remembered my brother.

201
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,490
I remembered my anger towards Aries.

202
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:35,813
It's okay.

203
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:39,526
Even if I don't know what exactly happened.

204
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,945
I know you've been through a lot.

205
00:13:47,492 --> 00:13:49,068
You know, I'm a bit jealous of you.

206
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,371
How does it feel to have an older brother?

207
00:13:51,371 --> 00:13:53,290
You know, when you have
someone that will protect you?

208
00:13:53,552 --> 00:13:54,552
Right?

209
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:58,990
The way you are, Jay, I don't think
you need protection at all.

210
00:13:59,671 --> 00:14:02,630
You're so fearless. I guess it should
be the other way around.

211
00:14:03,675 --> 00:14:06,611
How about this? We can
be your brothers now, Jay.

212
00:14:06,636 --> 00:14:10,682
- Shut up. I wanted protection, not stress.
- Stress?

213
00:14:10,807 --> 00:14:12,349
[laughs]

214
00:14:12,767 --> 00:14:15,490
Oh, by the way. Are you
practicing for the festival?

215
00:14:17,061 --> 00:14:19,584
What for? I'm not in the
basketball team anymore.

216
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,444
But you're so good. Such a waste.

217
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:24,278
Thank you.

218
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:26,155
But...

219
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,717
Aries got me kicked out of the team.

220
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,202
What? Aries again?

221
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:32,161
Yeah.

222
00:14:32,704 --> 00:14:36,374
You know, I was shortlisted for students
that will receive scholarship.

223
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:40,412
But how could that happen
if I'm not part of the basketball team.

224
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:46,927
I hope I can help you.

225
00:14:49,262 --> 00:14:50,305
I hope so too.

226
00:14:52,891 --> 00:14:54,529
Why don't you just teach me basketball?

227
00:14:54,893 --> 00:14:56,603
Basketball? You're so random.

228
00:14:56,728 --> 00:14:58,205
Can you keep up? What can you do?

229
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,689
- Run.
- Run?

230
00:15:00,153 --> 00:15:01,739
I'll show you. Come on!

231
00:15:01,764 --> 00:15:03,130
- Really?
- See!

232
00:15:04,623 --> 00:15:06,326
Alright, one word. One word.

233
00:15:06,927 --> 00:15:07,927
Two syllables.

234
00:15:08,406 --> 00:15:09,427
Chop, chop.

235
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,232
Sir Alvin.

236
00:15:13,091 --> 00:15:14,093
It's Sir Alvin!

237
00:15:14,118 --> 00:15:15,744
- David?
- Who is that?

238
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,248
Keifer!

239
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,291
[cheering]

240
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,853
Now it's my turn. Wait a minute!

241
00:15:21,878 --> 00:15:24,756
Let's do it this way - anyone who
guesses wrong must pay five hundred!

242
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,800
[students complaining]

243
00:15:27,467 --> 00:15:29,912
Alright, here I go. Okay, okay.

244
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,821
Wait. Wait.

245
00:15:31,846 --> 00:15:33,265
- One word.
- One word.

246
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:34,574
- Two syllables.
- Okay.

247
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:35,600
Let's go, let's go.

248
00:15:38,006 --> 00:15:39,169
[laughs]

249
00:15:39,729 --> 00:15:41,147
- Chicken?
- Chicken!

250
00:15:41,451 --> 00:15:42,451
Phoenix?

251
00:15:42,476 --> 00:15:43,733
- Rory!
- Yuri?

252
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,361
- Did you answer that?
- Is that right?

253
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:47,841
My brain's delayed, so yeah.

254
00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:49,030
[cheering]

255
00:15:49,739 --> 00:15:50,740
How about this one?

256
00:15:51,747 --> 00:15:53,499
- One word.
- What's next?

257
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:56,849
Two. Two syllables?

258
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,559
- What's that?
- Are you dancing?

259
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:01,584
Rory!

260
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:04,212
- Edrix!
- [cheering]

261
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,356
Your best friend, right?

262
00:16:06,381 --> 00:16:08,800
[chattering]

263
00:16:08,925 --> 00:16:09,925
Hey.

264
00:16:11,052 --> 00:16:12,429
You've been lost in
thought there for too long.

265
00:16:12,887 --> 00:16:13,905
Do you have a problem?

266
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:14,931
[background chattering]

267
00:16:15,056 --> 00:16:16,115
Nothing.

268
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,325
What's that?

269
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,646
[laughs]

270
00:16:18,935 --> 00:16:20,979
Then why the long face?

271
00:16:21,138 --> 00:16:22,169
[Yuri chuckles]

272
00:16:22,814 --> 00:16:23,982
That's not funny.

273
00:16:26,359 --> 00:16:27,819
What is your problem, Jay?

274
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:29,696
You can share it with me.

275
00:16:31,948 --> 00:16:33,116
It's about Aries.

276
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,568
What happened to him?

277
00:16:36,202 --> 00:16:39,914
I feel like I said something bad to him.
He just suddenly cried.

278
00:16:40,985 --> 00:16:42,029
Seriously?

279
00:16:42,471 --> 00:16:43,701
Aries cried?

280
00:16:44,127 --> 00:16:45,127
Yeah.

281
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:49,007
We were just talking about Felix's brother.

282
00:16:49,924 --> 00:16:51,134
What's his name again?

283
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:53,783
Per...

284
00:16:53,808 --> 00:16:55,851
Percy? Percy! That's it.

285
00:16:58,381 --> 00:16:59,733
Why were you talking about him?

286
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,687
We weren't actually talking about him.
I just asked a question.

287
00:17:03,141 --> 00:17:04,763
Felix and I talked.

288
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,865
He told me about his brother.

289
00:17:07,275 --> 00:17:09,736
So, I asked Aries. And then, we fought.

290
00:17:13,031 --> 00:17:14,662
Why? Do you know anything?

291
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,996
Yuri! Jay-jay!

292
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:21,959
Join the game.

293
00:17:22,999 --> 00:17:25,644
- Come on!
- Quick, join us!

294
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:26,728
Let's go.

295
00:17:26,753 --> 00:17:28,037
Let's play the game with them.

296
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,380
Come on! Let's play.

297
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:35,195
If you fail to answer,
you'll pay five hundred.

298
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,180
- Jay, you go first.
- No, he'll do it.

299
00:17:37,555 --> 00:17:42,369
[chattering]

300
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,479
- Just try one. Just one.
- We're gonna guess it.

301
00:17:45,063 --> 00:17:46,564
Okay. Go, go, go.

302
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,130
- Go on! Just do it!
- Quickly!

303
00:17:48,544 --> 00:17:49,567
[chuckles]

304
00:17:49,576 --> 00:17:50,951
[laughs]

305
00:17:51,474 --> 00:17:52,482
Do it, quick!

306
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:55,090
- Wait, I'm thinking!
- Oh, so you have a brain?

307
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,174
Five,

308
00:17:56,199 --> 00:17:57,742
- four,
- three,

309
00:17:57,767 --> 00:17:59,285
- two,
- one!

310
00:17:59,285 --> 00:18:01,349
- I'm not doing it then.
- [boys groan in disappointment]

311
00:18:04,749 --> 00:18:07,224
Thank you, ma'am. Your tapa's the best!

312
00:18:11,185 --> 00:18:13,508
So, sir, when can we get the car?

313
00:18:13,533 --> 00:18:15,748
- The next day.
- Next day?

314
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:18,935
- That's too long!
- Psst! Hey!

315
00:18:19,959 --> 00:18:21,263
Hey, Jay!

316
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:23,808
- How are you?
- What are you guys up to?

317
00:18:25,061 --> 00:18:26,454
My car fucking broke down.

318
00:18:26,479 --> 00:18:27,580
So, I had to get it fixed.

319
00:18:27,605 --> 00:18:30,787
I wanted a ride but I
ended up walking, too.

320
00:18:31,482 --> 00:18:32,502
Oh, Jay!

321
00:18:32,527 --> 00:18:34,115
The school festival's coming up, right?

322
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,296
That's right!

323
00:18:35,321 --> 00:18:37,924
We still don't have
representatives for the contest.

324
00:18:37,949 --> 00:18:38,949
We do.

325
00:18:39,325 --> 00:18:40,325
- Who?
- Who?

326
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:42,178
Take a good look at each other.

327
00:18:42,203 --> 00:18:43,955
Mr. Pretty and Ms. Handsome.

328
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:47,392
Well it's obvious I'm gonna
be chosen for Ms. Handsome.

329
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:48,893
I'm the only girl, so there's no choice.

330
00:18:48,918 --> 00:18:50,599
But Ci-N for Mr. Pretty?

331
00:18:50,962 --> 00:18:52,279
- I'm not so sure.
- Yeah, why me?

332
00:18:52,672 --> 00:18:53,898
You're built like a girl.

333
00:18:53,923 --> 00:18:55,775
- You're insane. I'm gonna punch you.
- Go on, just try it.

334
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,401
Try it!

335
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,091
- Alright, I'll kiss you. No malice.
- So, what?

336
00:18:58,116 --> 00:18:59,279
[Jay-jay squeals]

337
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,537
- [Ci-N chuckles]
- Ci-N, you're so stupid!

338
00:19:00,685 --> 00:19:02,216
It's too early, but
you're already so rowdy.

339
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:03,552
Why did you do that, bro?

340
00:19:04,341 --> 00:19:05,827
- Kiss, kiss, kiss. Game.
- Bro, you're so weird.

341
00:19:05,852 --> 00:19:07,287
Stop with that weird shit, bro.

342
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,438
Please, stop with that weird shit.

343
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:09,459
Stop! Stop!

344
00:19:10,857 --> 00:19:11,990
You're so annoying, man.

345
00:19:12,817 --> 00:19:14,044
[Jay-jay screams]

346
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:15,862
- Hey, bro! Jay-jay!
- Get off me! Help me!

347
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,740
- Hey! Hey!
- Jay-jay!

348
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:20,661
Hey! Stop! What are you doing?!

349
00:19:23,154 --> 00:19:24,262
Jay!

350
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,529
- [beatboxing]
- Look at me.

351
00:19:26,554 --> 00:19:27,748
Come on, come on. You first.

352
00:19:28,025 --> 00:19:29,559
In heaven, there's an angel.

353
00:19:29,584 --> 00:19:30,794
In the sea, there's a shell.

354
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,128
I saw your bald daddy,

355
00:19:32,128 --> 00:19:33,505
- putting on some hair gel.
- What's bothering you?

356
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:34,906
[boys getting hyped]

357
00:19:36,951 --> 00:19:39,638
[Yuri] Aries told Jay-jay about Percy.

358
00:19:40,896 --> 00:19:41,896
Keifer!

359
00:19:42,185 --> 00:19:43,257
Keifer!

360
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:44,849
What the hell are you shouting about?

361
00:19:44,945 --> 00:19:46,797
- It's Jay-jay!
- What happened to Jay-jay?!

362
00:19:46,822 --> 00:19:47,827
They took her!

363
00:19:47,852 --> 00:19:49,787
- Ram's people. I'm sure.
- What?!

364
00:19:50,492 --> 00:19:52,310
No one's leaving this room.

365
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,374
It's a trap.

366
00:19:53,399 --> 00:19:55,543
We can't just do nothing here, Keifer!

367
00:19:55,568 --> 00:19:57,320
I know how Ram plays.

368
00:19:57,445 --> 00:19:58,922
He'll lead us into his game,

369
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,799
and then we'll be the
ones to end up losing.

370
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:03,009
- Then what's your plan?!
- We can't just stay here, Keifer!

371
00:20:03,034 --> 00:20:04,396
I know! I'm thinking!

372
00:20:04,959 --> 00:20:07,404
[phone ringing]

373
00:20:07,781 --> 00:20:09,174
- What's that?
- Who's calling?

374
00:20:09,199 --> 00:20:10,216
It's Ram! It's Ram!

375
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:12,802
- Who's that?
- Shut your mouth!

376
00:20:13,336 --> 00:20:14,521
- Jay!
- Jay!

377
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,047
- Jay!
- Jay!

378
00:20:16,072 --> 00:20:20,099
[Ram] Hey, hey, hey. Don't be too loud.
Can't you see, someone's sleeping?

379
00:20:21,634 --> 00:20:24,011
Hi, boys! What's up?

380
00:20:24,639 --> 00:20:26,721
- Missed me?
- Yeah. A lot.

381
00:20:27,183 --> 00:20:28,183
Fuck you!

382
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:29,811
You know...

383
00:20:30,032 --> 00:20:31,396
our last game was cut a bit short.

384
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,106
Let's continue it.

385
00:20:33,731 --> 00:20:35,943
- Shall we?
- What are you gonna do to Jay-jay?!

386
00:20:36,484 --> 00:20:37,569
Actually,

387
00:20:38,069 --> 00:20:39,294
I don't really know.

388
00:20:40,196 --> 00:20:42,198
But I'm pissed at what she did.

389
00:20:42,647 --> 00:20:44,615
Gosh. I felt cheated.

390
00:20:45,227 --> 00:20:46,328
Speaking of.

391
00:20:46,376 --> 00:20:48,295
You're too noisy. She's awake now.

392
00:20:48,746 --> 00:20:50,529
- Jay!
- Jay-jay!

393
00:20:51,374 --> 00:20:53,001
Wake up, sleepyhead.

394
00:20:53,751 --> 00:20:55,263
Ram, what the fuck do you want?!

395
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:56,796
Visit your friend.

396
00:20:57,463 --> 00:20:59,623
But I only accept limited visitors.

397
00:21:00,466 --> 00:21:01,509
Maybe...

398
00:21:02,218 --> 00:21:03,344
just four people.

399
00:21:03,373 --> 00:21:04,487
Just four?!

400
00:21:04,512 --> 00:21:05,818
[Section E boys arguing]

401
00:21:07,654 --> 00:21:09,225
- Shut up!
- Fuck you, bitch!

402
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,119
Alright! It'll be just four of us.
How many are you?

403
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:13,813
Hey, now... If I were you, I'll
be scrambling my way here.

404
00:21:14,544 --> 00:21:15,552
Look...

405
00:21:16,649 --> 00:21:17,942
I don't like getting bored.

406
00:21:18,294 --> 00:21:19,294
Stop it!

407
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,419
- Jay!
- You asshole! Son of a bitch!

408
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:24,443
You know where to find me.

409
00:21:27,785 --> 00:21:28,887
Yuri!

410
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:30,388
You're wasting your strength.

411
00:21:30,413 --> 00:21:31,431
Let's go!

412
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,725
David! Ci-N! Get another car.

413
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,501
- The four of us are going.
- Are you serious?!

414
00:21:35,526 --> 00:21:37,228
We can't risk anything.

415
00:21:37,253 --> 00:21:38,938
Ram said only four.

416
00:21:38,963 --> 00:21:41,733
But just like before,
we bring a back-up car.

417
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:43,718
Eren, make sure nobody fucking sees you.

418
00:21:43,968 --> 00:21:45,107
Let's fucking go!

419
00:21:45,788 --> 00:21:47,316
- Move, quick.
- Come on!

420
00:21:48,715 --> 00:21:50,534
- What's the plan?
- Come on. Let's go!

421
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:52,352
Hello! Where the hell
are you! Come quick!

422
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:53,745
- [Ci-N] Where are you?
- We're almost at the parking.

423
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,714
- We're going to David's car.
- Alright. Just be quick.

424
00:21:57,857 --> 00:21:59,308
Where the hell is Jay-jay?!

425
00:21:59,567 --> 00:22:00,972
Ram called Kiko!

426
00:22:01,235 --> 00:22:03,321
I'm sure she got entangled
in your mess again!

427
00:22:03,377 --> 00:22:04,663
Mind your own business!

428
00:22:04,697 --> 00:22:05,711
We're gonna save Jay-jay!

429
00:22:05,736 --> 00:22:07,308
I'm gonna save my cousin.

430
00:22:07,762 --> 00:22:09,043
- We'll go with you.
- You can't.

431
00:22:09,577 --> 00:22:11,095
Ram is asking for four people only.

432
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,748
Just stay here. You're putting
Jay-jay at risk with what you're doing.

433
00:22:13,923 --> 00:22:15,183
- Let's go!
- Wait.

434
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:20,004
- Let's just report it.
- No. I know Ram.

435
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,881
Jay-jay will be in more
danger if we do that.

436
00:22:22,238 --> 00:22:23,293
And then what?

437
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,425
Aren't you gonna tell your brother?

438
00:22:33,184 --> 00:22:34,602
Where are you, guys? What's taking so long?

439
00:22:34,627 --> 00:22:37,160
[Ci-N] Wait up! We're almost there.
Just got stuck at the stoplight.

440
00:22:37,188 --> 00:22:38,481
- Just get here fast.
- [Ci-N] Okay, okay.

441
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:43,699
I'm gonna fuck them up
if they touch her. I swear.

442
00:22:47,198 --> 00:22:48,910
Keifer, I need to ask you something.

443
00:22:49,158 --> 00:22:50,410
Do you have to ask it now?

444
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:55,668
Did something happen between you
and Jay-jay at the Horror House?

445
00:23:00,586 --> 00:23:02,338
Wait, let me ask you first.

446
00:23:04,173 --> 00:23:05,675
Do you like Jay-jay?

447
00:23:06,175 --> 00:23:07,343
Do you have feelings for her?

448
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:18,979
Yes.

449
00:23:21,315 --> 00:23:22,900
I think I'm falling for her.

450
00:23:25,236 --> 00:23:26,511
Are you out of your mind?

451
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:28,293
You know we have a plan.

452
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:30,116
Is this still part of your plan?

453
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:32,844
Everything that happened
at the amusement park.

454
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:34,262
The incident with Aries.

455
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:36,039
And now, us saving her from Ram.

456
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:37,473
Of course.

457
00:23:37,498 --> 00:23:38,691
Are you starting to doubt me?

458
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:40,960
You saw how worried Aries was.

459
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:43,588
He cares about Jay-jay.
It's still part of the plan.

460
00:23:44,894 --> 00:23:45,902
Is that true?

461
00:23:48,801 --> 00:23:51,300
Because I can see that your concern
for her is becoming real.

462
00:23:52,138 --> 00:23:53,675
Why are you doing this, Keifer?

463
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:01,981
You know I need her for my plan, Yuri.

464
00:24:11,282 --> 00:24:13,951
- Where the hell are they?!
- Let's go! You're too slow!

465
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:17,914
Come on! Let's go!

466
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:24,670
Well, well, well...

467
00:24:25,421 --> 00:24:28,382
Look at the people gathered here.

468
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:32,678
Hey... you got some visitors.

469
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:34,584
Hey!

470
00:24:37,334 --> 00:24:40,036
Why so serious?

471
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:41,061
You, too!

472
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,313
Just chill!

473
00:24:42,605 --> 00:24:44,084
You did that on purpose, asshole!

474
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:46,155
Don't overreact.

475
00:24:46,376 --> 00:24:48,036
I just thought maybe
you'd like to jump again.

476
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:49,879
We're here. What the hell do you want?

477
00:24:49,904 --> 00:24:51,114
I was left hanging.

478
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:53,584
Remember? And besides...

479
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,160
I got this itch.

480
00:24:56,702 --> 00:24:59,831
I always want to see people fighting.

481
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:01,686
Boys!

482
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:15,596
Look. They're gonna beat up your friends.

483
00:25:15,787 --> 00:25:16,834
[Ram chuckles]

484
00:25:21,894 --> 00:25:22,920
That's it?

485
00:25:23,062 --> 00:25:24,100
You're too few.

486
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,566
Hey. Don't be so arrogant.

487
00:25:27,316 --> 00:25:29,777
Let's see if you can make your way up here.

488
00:25:31,654 --> 00:25:32,655
Bye-bye!

489
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,973
Jasper Jean Mariano!

490
00:25:34,936 --> 00:25:35,983
Wait for me!

491
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:39,120
Come on! Move!

492
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:41,834
So...

493
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,623
- Let's go.
- Let's get to it!

494
00:25:44,294 --> 00:25:45,309
Wait up!

495
00:25:45,334 --> 00:25:46,866
Wait! Hey!

496
00:25:46,891 --> 00:25:47,905
What's up?

497
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,022
What?!

498
00:25:50,464 --> 00:25:51,498
Did it start yet?

499
00:26:10,871 --> 00:26:11,878
Fuck you!

500
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,918
- What did you say?!
- Fuck you!

501
00:26:42,733 --> 00:26:43,944
Are you done, dude?

502
00:26:44,522 --> 00:26:45,545
Out of my way.

503
00:27:22,608 --> 00:27:23,616
Jay!

504
00:27:25,121 --> 00:27:26,139
Keifer?...

505
00:27:26,553 --> 00:27:27,592
Don't!

506
00:27:31,857 --> 00:27:34,068
What do you take me for, some stupid fool?

507
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:35,611
I'm ready for you, bro!

508
00:27:36,153 --> 00:27:37,154
Stop it, please!

509
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:40,049
Stop it, please! Stop...

510
00:27:40,074 --> 00:27:41,092
Stop it!

511
00:27:44,745 --> 00:27:45,780
Stop it!

512
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:49,041
Stop it, please! Stop...

513
00:27:51,502 --> 00:27:52,628
You're begging?

514
00:27:53,264 --> 00:27:54,264
Huh?

515
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,923
For this guy?

516
00:27:56,342 --> 00:27:57,342
Why?

517
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,926
Is he your boyfriend?

518
00:28:00,386 --> 00:28:01,971
Don't cry, Jay...

519
00:28:02,513 --> 00:28:03,597
Don't cry.

520
00:28:03,818 --> 00:28:04,819
[Jay-jay cries]

521
00:28:06,809 --> 00:28:07,977
You're a coward.

522
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:10,311
I don't care about what you say.

523
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,440
It's tough fighting you!

524
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:16,402
Of all my men, none have defeated you.

525
00:28:16,944 --> 00:28:18,741
Cause you're so fucking weak.

526
00:28:18,928 --> 00:28:20,364
Huh? Weak?

527
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:21,881
[grunts in pain]

528
00:28:22,662 --> 00:28:23,725
Weak!

529
00:28:24,952 --> 00:28:25,952
Huh?

530
00:28:29,214 --> 00:28:30,670
[Jay-jay screams]

531
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:35,741
Keifer!

532
00:28:36,045 --> 00:28:38,049
Jay! Get out of here.

533
00:28:38,741 --> 00:28:39,817
Run, Jay!

534
00:28:39,842 --> 00:28:41,469
- No, I won't leave you!
- Please, Jay...

535
00:28:41,635 --> 00:28:43,237
Just get out of here, please...

536
00:28:43,262 --> 00:28:44,597
No! I won't leave you!

537
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:46,303
- Just leave me...
- Get up! Let's go!

538
00:28:47,264 --> 00:28:49,769
- Come on, let's go!
- Run, Jay, please.

539
00:28:50,178 --> 00:28:51,248
Come here...

540
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,311
[Jay-jay screaming]

541
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:55,858
- Let go of me!
- You bitch!

542
00:28:58,131 --> 00:28:59,139
Jay!

543
00:30:04,462 --> 00:30:07,901
Jay, that's enough! Stop!

544
00:30:08,222 --> 00:30:09,254
Please.

545
00:30:11,016 --> 00:30:12,043
Jay, stop.

546
00:30:12,737 --> 00:30:16,066
Jay, breathe, breathe. Breathe, Jay.

547
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:19,775
Breathe. Relax, I'm here. It's me. It's me.

548
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:21,277
I'm here, Jay.

549
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:22,613
Relax, I'm here.

550
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,879
I'm here.

551
00:30:24,546 --> 00:30:26,882
Relax. Relax, I'm here.

552
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:29,299
It's me, relax.

553
00:30:29,324 --> 00:30:31,152
It's okay. Just breathe.

554
00:30:31,177 --> 00:30:32,471
Just breathe.

555
00:30:32,496 --> 00:30:33,639
Just breathe.

556
00:30:33,664 --> 00:30:34,974
Just breathe.

557
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,637
Just breathe, Jay, I'm here.

558
00:30:36,667 --> 00:30:39,420
I'm here. It's me. It's okay. Just breathe.

559
00:30:39,837 --> 00:30:40,880
Just breathe.

560
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:42,715
Relax.

561
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:46,593
It's okay.

562
00:30:47,094 --> 00:30:48,094
It's okay.

563
00:30:48,512 --> 00:30:49,512
It's okay.

564
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,268
It's okay.

565
00:30:55,769 --> 00:30:57,855
It's okay, It's okay.

566
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,387
It's okay, It's okay.

567
00:31:04,742 --> 00:31:05,746
Keifer?

568
00:31:05,988 --> 00:31:07,281
It's me.

569
00:31:07,823 --> 00:31:08,926
Jay, it's me.

570
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,832
It's okay.

571
00:31:12,098 --> 00:31:13,245
You're good.

572
00:31:13,871 --> 00:31:14,973
What happened?

573
00:31:15,664 --> 00:31:16,664
It's okay.

574
00:31:17,958 --> 00:31:18,958
It's okay.

575
00:31:22,546 --> 00:31:24,298
Did I do that to him?

576
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:30,346
I must have done it. Cyrus was also
in this state when I woke up.

577
00:31:33,974 --> 00:31:35,476
What did I do to him?

578
00:31:37,102 --> 00:31:38,441
Did I kill him?

579
00:31:38,466 --> 00:31:40,397
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Is he dead?

580
00:31:40,422 --> 00:31:42,483
- [Jay-jay crying]
- He's still alive.

581
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,401
He's alive.

582
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:45,910
He's still breathing.

583
00:31:46,612 --> 00:31:48,672
You're just protecting yourself, Jay.

584
00:31:48,697 --> 00:31:49,707
Look at me.

585
00:31:50,434 --> 00:31:51,473
You're okay.

586
00:31:51,867 --> 00:31:52,879
You're okay.

587
00:31:54,703 --> 00:31:57,331
You're okay. Just breathe.

588
00:31:58,666 --> 00:31:59,676
It's okay.

589
00:32:04,588 --> 00:32:05,590
It's okay.

590
00:32:10,152 --> 00:32:11,160
It's okay.

591
00:32:13,152 --> 00:32:14,160
Jay!

592
00:32:14,348 --> 00:32:15,558
- Damn!
- He's still breathing?

593
00:32:16,767 --> 00:32:18,477
Is this guy still alive?

594
00:32:18,936 --> 00:32:20,271
We got every last one of them.

595
00:32:23,065 --> 00:32:24,275
Aries is outside.

596
00:32:24,608 --> 00:32:26,735
He doesn't wanna back down.

597
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,223
He's so worried about Jay.

598
00:32:57,254 --> 00:32:58,262
Keifer.

599
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:01,043
Can we talk?

600
00:33:01,395 --> 00:33:02,652
I need to know what happened.

601
00:33:06,012 --> 00:33:07,074
Yeah.

602
00:33:49,526 --> 00:33:50,526
Aries.

603
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,197
Where's Keifer?

604
00:33:53,918 --> 00:33:56,379
He's outside. Talking to Angelo.

605
00:33:58,452 --> 00:33:59,452
Aries.

606
00:33:59,995 --> 00:34:00,995
Why?

607
00:34:02,247 --> 00:34:04,416
What did I do to your father before?

608
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:09,433
I don't want to talk about that.

609
00:34:10,047 --> 00:34:12,214
Did I hurt him too?

610
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:15,719
Just like what I did to Cyrus and Ram?

611
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,222
I don't know.

612
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,349
Did I almost kill him too?

613
00:34:21,308 --> 00:34:22,368
I don't know.

614
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,602
- Did I also—
- Stop it!

615
00:34:24,561 --> 00:34:26,188
Stop asking questions about him.

616
00:34:26,563 --> 00:34:28,065
Aries! What's happening here?

617
00:34:28,857 --> 00:34:30,818
Aries. What are you doing?

618
00:34:32,611 --> 00:34:33,988
He hasn't done anything wrong.

619
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:39,242
Aries.

620
00:34:45,499 --> 00:34:46,499
Jay, are you okay?

621
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:47,925
Jay!

622
00:34:48,794 --> 00:34:51,433
I'm glad you're okay! I
thought we lost you, Jay!

623
00:34:52,881 --> 00:34:54,722
- This kid is being overly-dramatic.
- Talk to me, Jay!

624
00:34:55,224 --> 00:34:58,073
Ouch! You're making the pain worse for me.

625
00:34:58,098 --> 00:34:59,098
Sorry.

626
00:35:01,807 --> 00:35:02,886
What happened there?

627
00:35:03,058 --> 00:35:05,310
She was asking what happened to Dad.

628
00:35:07,878 --> 00:35:10,756
What happened? And why didn't
you inform me immediately?

629
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:13,863
You let Keifer do all the work?

630
00:35:14,945 --> 00:35:16,370
I just didn't know what to do.

631
00:35:17,857 --> 00:35:19,855
You didn't even think of finding her too?

632
00:35:20,075 --> 00:35:22,161
- I did look for her.
- You should've come with them.

633
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:24,204
She is your—

634
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:25,998
She's your cousin!

635
00:35:26,506 --> 00:35:28,074
You should be the
first to look out for her.

636
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,294
Sorry.

637
00:35:35,382 --> 00:35:36,503
Because it happened again,

638
00:35:37,968 --> 00:35:40,971
I think it's better to take
Jay-jay to a psychiatrist.

639
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,167
Keifer explained to me what she did.

640
00:35:43,665 --> 00:35:45,035
She can't remember a thing.

641
00:35:45,517 --> 00:35:46,574
That's not normal.

642
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:49,277
We need to be serious in
getting her the help she needs.

643
00:35:50,939 --> 00:35:53,358
You decide. You're her guardian after all.

644
00:35:57,878 --> 00:35:58,714
Hello?

645
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:02,009
Hello sir, one of our investors
are threatening to pull out.

646
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:04,036
No. I won't allow him to pull out.

647
00:36:04,995 --> 00:36:06,663
Set a meeting now. I'm on my way.

648
00:36:06,988 --> 00:36:07,988
Yes, sir.

649
00:36:11,126 --> 00:36:13,086
Aries. I have to go. Something came up.

650
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:14,792
Take care of Jay.

651
00:36:18,592 --> 00:36:22,805
Excuse me, miss. Where is the room
of Jasper Jean Mariano?

652
00:36:24,431 --> 00:36:26,266
- I'll just check, ma'am.
- Okay.

653
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,233
Aries!

654
00:36:35,822 --> 00:36:36,822
Aries!

655
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:40,488
What's wrong?

656
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:41,855
What are you doing here?

657
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:44,243
I'm visiting my daughter.

658
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:46,098
She needs her mom now.

659
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:47,496
Is that a joke?

660
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:49,497
It's not funny.

661
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:53,118
Aries, I just want to see Jay-jay.

662
00:36:53,418 --> 00:36:55,045
It's been so long since we last talked.

663
00:36:55,462 --> 00:36:57,798
And I want to let her
know, I'm getting married—

664
00:36:57,798 --> 00:36:58,798
Again?

665
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:00,824
Aren't you getting tired of this?

666
00:37:01,927 --> 00:37:04,221
You think Jay-jay would be
happy once she hears this?

667
00:37:04,888 --> 00:37:06,370
Don't you dare raise your voice at me.

668
00:37:06,395 --> 00:37:08,186
You might be forgetting who I really am.

669
00:37:09,142 --> 00:37:10,244
Let me guess.

670
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:12,062
You still haven't told her the truth.

671
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:14,792
That's none of your business.

672
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:17,192
I'll tell her eventually, but not today.

673
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:18,894
You make sure of that.

674
00:37:19,152 --> 00:37:22,030
Or else, I'll tell her myself.

675
00:37:22,656 --> 00:37:24,157
You have the guts to threaten me?

676
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,410
If you're truly concerned for Jay-jay,

677
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,595
you wouldn't show your face here.

678
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:30,558
Because you know she'll
just get hurt even more.

679
00:37:49,516 --> 00:37:51,810
[background chattering]

680
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:55,313
Jay-jay.

681
00:37:56,082 --> 00:37:57,082
Huh?

682
00:37:57,107 --> 00:37:58,113
For you.

683
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:00,644
Please smile.

684
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:02,029
Give us a smile!

685
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:05,616
[teasing]

686
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,759
She's going to smile!

687
00:38:07,784 --> 00:38:09,161
- Hey, here's food.
- Thank you.

688
00:38:13,707 --> 00:38:14,707
Eat up.

689
00:38:16,418 --> 00:38:17,418
Ouch!

690
00:38:18,712 --> 00:38:19,712
Can I?

691
00:38:24,426 --> 00:38:25,636
Why are you still down?

692
00:38:26,553 --> 00:38:28,003
Is it because the pancake's burnt?

693
00:38:29,139 --> 00:38:32,339
That's the 30th time you
asked me since I left the hospital.

694
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:35,871
If every question of yours was paid,
maybe I could buy a pair of shoes now.

695
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:38,714
You know, I won't bother
asking you if you're not like this.

696
00:38:40,081 --> 00:38:42,050
You can share your problems with me, okay?

697
00:38:46,573 --> 00:38:47,991
[indistinct chattering]

698
00:38:48,261 --> 00:38:49,285
Guys!

699
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:50,480
Section E!

700
00:38:52,037 --> 00:38:52,829
- Section E!
- Hey, quiet down!

701
00:38:52,829 --> 00:38:54,431
Hey, they're calling Section E with H.

702
00:38:54,456 --> 00:38:57,144
The committee is asking for
the names of the participants.

703
00:38:57,576 --> 00:39:00,228
- Committee?
- What committee?

704
00:39:00,261 --> 00:39:01,425
Committee!

705
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,339
They're asking who's gonna
participate in the festival.

706
00:39:03,456 --> 00:39:04,800
- What?
- Repeat what you said.

707
00:39:04,825 --> 00:39:07,411
Committee. Committee, are you satisfied?

708
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:09,054
Ahhh.

709
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:13,211
As we've discussed,
Ci-N and Jay-jay

710
00:39:13,236 --> 00:39:15,477
will represent us for Mr. Pretty
and Ms. Handsome.

711
00:39:15,502 --> 00:39:17,496
- Wow!
- Mr. Pretty!

712
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:19,064
[Section E getting hyped]

713
00:39:20,857 --> 00:39:22,791
- Wait up, this one's about to cry.
- Who?

714
00:39:23,393 --> 00:39:25,880
Hey, how about for the Battle of the Bands?

715
00:39:25,904 --> 00:39:26,989
There you go.

716
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:29,189
Keifer and I haven't talked about it yet.

717
00:39:30,033 --> 00:39:31,166
You have a band?

718
00:39:32,642 --> 00:39:35,259
Well... we used to play before.

719
00:39:35,872 --> 00:39:39,459
Keifer was the main vocalist.
Blaster and I are on guitars.

720
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:42,337
Edrix on drums. Rory on bass.

721
00:39:42,629 --> 00:39:43,839
Felix on the piano.

722
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:45,757
I see.

723
00:39:45,757 --> 00:39:47,884
But that was a long time ago.

724
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,111
Before the incident with Ella.

725
00:39:50,804 --> 00:39:51,847
That's a shame.

726
00:39:52,006 --> 00:39:54,133
Wait, how about the dance contest?

727
00:39:54,182 --> 00:39:56,226
- Count me in!
- I'm game for that!

728
00:39:56,226 --> 00:39:58,895
[boys shuttering]

729
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:01,857
- How much is the cash prize?
- There you go again!

730
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:03,066
I was merely asking!

731
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:06,028
Guys, wait. There's also a singing contest.

732
00:40:06,528 --> 00:40:08,530
Who wants to join the singing contest?

733
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:11,450
[discussing]

734
00:40:13,326 --> 00:40:14,453
Come with me.

735
00:40:15,078 --> 00:40:16,134
What?

736
00:40:16,371 --> 00:40:17,539
Come with me.

737
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:21,908
Just a moment.

738
00:40:21,924 --> 00:40:24,017
[background chattering]

739
00:40:37,142 --> 00:40:39,686
- I'll go first?
- Are you scared? Just get in.

740
00:40:39,908 --> 00:40:41,897
Hey. Are you planning
something bad to me?!

741
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:13,845
Who are these people?

742
00:41:15,138 --> 00:41:16,306
Past Section E.

743
00:41:17,557 --> 00:41:20,519
From the year 1994 to the present year.

744
00:41:31,196 --> 00:41:33,115
Why do you have something like this?

745
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:36,993
The truth is we didn't know.

746
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:40,372
We just found this place
when we moved into the room downstairs.

747
00:41:41,498 --> 00:41:45,043
And it's all filled with pictures
of juniors and seniors, so...

748
00:41:45,585 --> 00:41:47,583
We thought to join in as well, since...

749
00:41:47,921 --> 00:41:49,131
we're also Section E.

750
00:41:50,059 --> 00:41:53,434
Maybe they're also assholes
like the Section E of today.

751
00:41:54,177 --> 00:41:57,889
Crazy and troublesome... just like Keifer.

752
00:42:08,316 --> 00:42:09,359
Is that?...

753
00:42:09,776 --> 00:42:11,528
That's Angelo, isn't it?

754
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:15,573
Yeah.

755
00:42:17,534 --> 00:42:18,743
He's from Section E too?

756
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:22,330
He was the best and most powerful
president in Section E.

757
00:42:24,749 --> 00:42:26,459
Really? How did you know?

758
00:42:27,043 --> 00:42:29,963
Believe it or not,
half of this town knows him well.

759
00:42:29,963 --> 00:42:32,924
Even other schools are afraid
to visit just because of him.

760
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:35,739
Cool.

761
00:42:42,934 --> 00:42:44,811
Wanna put up your picture on the wall?

762
00:42:48,064 --> 00:42:49,083
Me?

763
00:42:50,364 --> 00:42:51,414
Why?

764
00:42:51,439 --> 00:42:52,482
You don't want to?

765
00:42:52,986 --> 00:42:54,083
You're Section E.

766
00:43:04,706 --> 00:43:05,790
I'm Section E.

767
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,939
See?

768
00:43:12,964 --> 00:43:14,591
You look better when you're smiling.

769
00:43:19,304 --> 00:43:20,304
You too.

770
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:21,681
You look better.

771
00:43:31,107 --> 00:43:34,085
Just let me know if you
want to put your picture up.

772
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:35,779
I'll let you borrow the key.

773
00:43:36,279 --> 00:43:37,279
[nods]

774
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:40,367
Let's go. They're waiting for us.

775
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:42,035
Ah, Keifer.

776
00:43:44,329 --> 00:43:45,329
Nothing.

777
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:46,497
Thank you.

778
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:49,208
Tss!

779
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:53,539
What an asshole.

780
00:44:04,015 --> 00:44:05,809
Oh. What's up with you guys?

781
00:44:05,892 --> 00:44:06,981
Just watch.

782
00:44:07,352 --> 00:44:08,645
Why aren't you moving?

783
00:44:08,645 --> 00:44:09,813
Just watch.

784
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:11,398
Alright.

785
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:12,552
Boys.

786
00:44:12,942 --> 00:44:15,319
Five, four, three, two...

787

[Jay-jay laughing]

789
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,421
Yuri?!

790
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,218
Wow.

791
00:44:46,057 --> 00:44:49,019
Wow. Is that what you've been
doing to your girlfriend?!

792
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:07,370
Look at those two by the table!

793
00:45:19,924 --> 00:45:22,927
That's what love does to a person.

794
00:45:26,681 --> 00:45:29,726
So powerful. Isn't your dance
too aggressive, Ci-N?

795
00:46:20,516 --> 00:46:24,531
Is this really happening?
Talk about being the Best President.

796
00:46:24,906 --> 00:46:31,641
I think he's in front me now,
dancing together with his fellow assholes.

797

[singing continues]

798
00:46:46,898 --> 00:46:47,971
What is this?!

799
00:46:50,223 --> 00:46:51,991
Alright! You can stop now!

800
00:46:52,016 --> 00:46:54,227
You guys have a future as dancers!

801
00:46:54,252 --> 00:46:56,479

802
00:46:56,504 --> 00:46:58,256
[Jay-jay laughing]

[Ci-N and Calix singing]

804
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,448
Hey. What are you doing?

805
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:08,575
You're not do-

806
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:09,951
Hey, that's mine!

807
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:13,872
You're so selfish! As if you didn't
eat all the chocolates at home.

808
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:15,707
- You're overreacting.
- Hey, Denzel!

809
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:18,543
How's your work going at Eman's place?

810
00:47:19,085 --> 00:47:22,589
I'm doing okay since Eman's there with me.

811
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:26,342
Tiring but I gotta do it for Grace.

812
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:29,345
Very good. I'm glad you listened to us.

813
00:47:31,055 --> 00:47:32,117
Very good, Denzel.

814
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:34,809
Wait.

815
00:47:35,351 --> 00:47:36,500
listen up, you guys.

816
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,063
- We're gonna talk about the festival.
- Hey, it's the festival!

[Section E getting hyped]

818
00:47:44,235 --> 00:47:45,653
First things first.

819
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:50,417
First, the participants.
Second, the tasks they assigned to us.

820
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:51,159
Write it down.

821
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:53,870
Alright, I'll do it. Come with me.
I'm bad at memories.

822
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:56,141
It's memorization, dumbass.

823
00:47:56,581 --> 00:47:58,833
Don't write on the wall. Don't vandalize.

824
00:47:58,833 --> 00:48:00,335
Jay, look at the walls around us.

825
00:48:00,853 --> 00:48:03,758
- Yeah, see that?
- Read it over there. "Mayet is ugly."

826
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:05,883
[laughs]

827
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:07,592
Okay, Monday.

828
00:48:07,617 --> 00:48:08,686
Monday.

829
00:48:08,711 --> 00:48:10,673
The parade will be on Monday.

830
00:48:10,887 --> 00:48:13,223
Visitors from other schools will come.

831
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:16,586
And the representatives
and players will be introduced.

832
00:48:16,893 --> 00:48:18,853
Which means, there will
be no contest on this day.

833
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:22,582
As for the tasks, since the Dance Contest
will be held the next day,

834
00:48:22,607 --> 00:48:24,901
our representatives are
exempted from the tasks

835
00:48:25,026 --> 00:48:26,319
Just do your task the next night.

He talks too quickly.

837
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:30,750
Unlike before, we will divide
the duties into three groups.

838
00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:32,759
So that others can take some rest.

839
00:48:32,792 --> 00:48:36,963
Patrol Duty will start
by 7:00 PM to 7:00 AM.

840
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:41,751
First group: Rory, Kit, Mayo.

841
00:48:42,293 --> 00:48:45,171
Eman, Calix and Josh.

842
00:48:45,171 --> 00:48:46,756
We're on night duty?
But there's ghosts in there.

843
00:48:46,756 --> 00:48:48,024
- Boo.
- Son of a bitch.

844
00:48:48,049 --> 00:48:50,009
- [laughing]
- Are you afraid?

845
00:48:50,343 --> 00:48:51,803
No I'm not, fuck you!

846
00:48:52,303 --> 00:48:54,097
It's Josh's favorite part!

847
00:48:54,931 --> 00:48:56,057
Part? Why?

848
00:48:56,264 --> 00:48:58,284
- Josh has a third eye. Didn't you know?
- Huh?

849
00:48:58,309 --> 00:49:00,228
- Ask him if there's a ghost in here.
- Why? Right there!

850
00:49:00,603 --> 00:49:01,604
Hey!

851
00:49:01,604 --> 00:49:05,567

852
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:10,280
Hey. Quiet, quiet.

853
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:13,783
Second group: from 11:00 PM to 3:00 AM.

854
00:49:15,149 --> 00:49:22,719
- Well...
- Yuri. Eren. Me. Ci-N. David. And Jay-jay.

855

Garbage collecting will
start when the program ends.

856
00:49:27,113 --> 00:49:30,539
The rest of the class that I did
not mention will be the third group.

857
00:49:30,883 --> 00:49:33,219
Set-up is the same the following days.

858
00:49:33,219 --> 00:49:36,514
Unless you have an event the next day.

859
00:49:36,514 --> 00:49:38,032
No need to attend the duty.

860
00:49:38,057 --> 00:49:39,851
Tuesday. Dance contest.

861
00:49:40,268 --> 00:49:42,520
- Do we have representatives for this?
- Us!

862
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:43,646
Hey, me!

00:49:43,671 --> 00:49:49,168
Me, Calix, Eren, Drew, and Blaster.

864
00:49:49,193 --> 00:49:50,612
Wait a minute,

865
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:54,157
is it okay if Ci-N joins
the dance contest and Mr. Pretty?

866
00:49:54,356 --> 00:49:56,342
That's fine. It wasn't
mentioned in the rules.

867
00:49:56,367 --> 00:49:57,660
Battle of the bands.

868
00:49:58,453 --> 00:49:59,537
Shall we do this?

869
00:50:00,997 --> 00:50:02,820
We don't have any other representative.

870
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:04,626
Choose a proper song.

871
00:50:04,917 --> 00:50:06,419
Yes!

Anyone with a hidden talent, come out now.

874
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:13,789
Keep hiding.

875
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:15,762
Do it for the fam, Yuri.

876
00:50:16,137 --> 00:50:17,305
Do it for the fam!

877
00:50:18,139 --> 00:50:20,224
Why don't  you do it? You sing, right?

878
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:24,354
Yeah, Yuri. Do it. So I can hear you sing.

879
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:26,731

there's the Inter-year.

for grade-level representatives.

Have you prepared your
introduction and talent?

886
00:50:44,736 --> 00:50:45,758
- Right.
- Huh?

887
00:50:45,782 --> 00:50:46,852
Is there such a thing?

888
00:50:46,876 --> 00:50:48,044
Yeah, there is.

- I already have one! Wanna hear it?
- Don't bother!

- Everyone!
- No need! We don't wanna hear!

00:51:12,664 --> 00:51:15,405
Dude you're so embarrassing.

899
00:51:15,571 --> 00:51:18,116
Disgusting. Are you serious? Are you
really saying that in front of everyone?

900
00:51:18,288 --> 00:51:19,352
Yeah. Why not?

901
00:51:20,576 --> 00:51:21,678
You didn't reach me.

902
00:51:21,703 --> 00:51:23,496
[laughs]

903
00:51:23,496 --> 00:51:25,915
- Here's another one!
- Her legs are too short!

904
00:51:26,866 --> 00:51:30,378
- Jay, prepare your introduction too.
- Yeah.

905
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:33,339
- Me! I got one too!
- Stop it!

906
00:51:35,341 --> 00:51:38,727
Who's gonna take you home?
Keifer and Yuri are both free.

907
00:51:41,013 --> 00:51:44,109
It's okay. I'm gonna stop
by somewhere. I'm good.

908
00:51:44,642 --> 00:51:45,768
Are you sure, Jay?

909
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:48,563
I can take you to the terminal.

910
00:51:48,579 --> 00:51:49,560
[background chattering]

911
00:51:49,584 --> 00:51:51,794
It's okay. It's not that far.

912
00:51:52,824 --> 00:51:53,836
Okay.

913
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:58,508
[background chattering]

914
00:52:01,075 --> 00:52:02,285
Good morning.

915
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:05,288
Ice cream, ice cream.

916
00:52:07,582 --> 00:52:09,125
What's good in here?

917
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:13,588
Chocolate, cheese, ube...

918
00:52:14,547 --> 00:52:15,547
Jay-jay?

919
00:52:15,891 --> 00:52:16,899
Yes?

920
00:52:16,924 --> 00:52:18,468
Jay-jay, it is you!

921
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:20,928
You're grown already. How are you?

922
00:52:22,346 --> 00:52:24,766
I'm fine. Who are you again?

923
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:28,978
You really don't
recognize me. So, it's true.

924
00:52:30,396 --> 00:52:32,565
Don't be afraid. You know me.

925
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:34,567
I was your mom's ex-husband.

926
00:52:36,819 --> 00:52:38,988
I'm sorry, but I don't really know you.

927
00:52:39,238 --> 00:52:42,086
It's okay. Let me apologize to you.

928
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:45,745
For the wrong things I did when
I was your mom's husband.

929
00:52:50,416 --> 00:52:51,959
I was hooked up on my vices back then.

930
00:52:52,418 --> 00:52:57,215
So whenever I see you,
you take the receiving end of my anger.

931
00:52:57,381 --> 00:53:02,720
But believe me, now that I have a child
of my own, I regretted everything I did.

932
00:53:03,304 --> 00:53:05,890
If you still can't remember,
I'm Tony dela Cruz.

933
00:53:05,890 --> 00:53:08,768
I'm sorry, I really don't. I better go.

934
00:53:30,109 --> 00:53:35,156
I'm much worse. I'm trapped in a past
I can't remember.

935
00:53:35,181 --> 00:53:36,305
Jay!

936
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,065
Jay, what happened?!

937
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:40,883
- Yuri!
- Why are you running?

938
00:53:42,221 --> 00:53:44,056
A man approached me.

939
00:53:44,929 --> 00:53:49,475
He said he was my mother's ex, but...
I can't remember him.

940
00:53:57,024 --> 00:54:00,152
If you can't remember,
there must be a reason.

941
00:54:00,152 --> 00:54:03,948
There are things... people...
that are better off forgotten.

942
00:54:30,683 --> 00:54:32,351
Yuri's right.

943
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:36,480
Maybe that's why I've forgotten
all of my traumatic memories.

944
00:54:38,566 --> 00:54:42,445
But the incident with Ram...
Maybe I won't ever forget it.

945
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:47,058
Because aside from fear,
I felt safe and secured in the feeling...

946
00:54:47,283 --> 00:54:50,094
That everything will be okay.

947
00:54:50,119 --> 00:54:51,119
Jay?

948
00:54:51,495 --> 00:54:52,495
Are you okay?

949
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:00,963
Because of Keifer.

950
00:55:51,179 --> 00:55:53,765
There's someone too excited! Me!

951
00:55:54,475 --> 00:55:56,751
As always, I'm your DJ...

952
00:55:56,894 --> 00:55:59,997
And I'll be with you
throughout the next five days.

953
00:56:00,022 --> 00:56:01,248
Having fun without me?

954
00:56:01,273 --> 00:56:02,829
You want that? I'll win this game for you.

955
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:04,774
Boring game.

956
00:56:05,319 --> 00:56:06,462
You're a sore loser.

957
00:56:06,487 --> 00:56:07,505
I'll win you something better.

958
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,240
- And what is that?
- Battle of the Bands.

959
00:56:09,265 --> 00:56:10,431
Seems like, oh!

960
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:12,785
- Foul!
- Foul!

961
00:56:13,744 --> 00:56:14,787
Coach! Coach!

962
00:56:14,996 --> 00:56:17,540
Coach, you can see you
don't have many players left!

963
00:56:17,565 --> 00:56:19,000
- Can you do it?
- Yes, I can!

964
00:56:19,041 --> 00:56:22,128
- Shoot that ball!
- Shoot that ball!

965
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:25,272
Evans at number eight,
pass into Felix Collins!

966
00:56:25,297 --> 00:56:27,251
For the win!

967
00:56:27,383 --> 00:56:31,220
And the next to showcase
their talents are...

968
00:56:31,245 --> 00:56:32,805
From Section E.

969
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:34,024
So handsome, Keif--

970
00:56:34,258 --> 00:56:35,290
I mean, all of them.

971
00:56:35,315 --> 00:56:37,618
Who's that unlucky guy
you're having feelings for?

972
00:56:37,643 --> 00:56:40,062
You see how Keifer treats me.

973
00:56:40,062 --> 00:56:41,605
So, Keifer's the one
you were talking about.

974
00:56:41,605 --> 00:56:43,774
Don't tell it to anyone. It's a secret.

975
00:56:43,774 --> 00:56:45,234
Keifer, Jay-jay.

976
00:56:45,454 --> 00:56:46,460
KeiJay.

977
00:56:46,485 --> 00:56:47,987
I told you it's a secret.

978
00:56:48,012 --> 00:56:49,892
- Your voice is too loud!
- JayFer...
