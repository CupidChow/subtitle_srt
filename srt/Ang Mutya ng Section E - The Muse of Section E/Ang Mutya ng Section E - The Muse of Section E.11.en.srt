1
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:16,569
What are you doing here?

2
00:00:16,594 --> 00:00:17,888
I didn't know you're good at basketball.

3
00:00:17,912 --> 00:00:19,164
I was part of the varsity team before. Why?

4
00:00:19,188 --> 00:00:20,982
Are you practicing for the festival?

5
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:22,396
Aries got me kicked
out of the team.

6
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:24,106
The school festival's coming up, right?

7
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,024
That's right!

8
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,190
We still don't have
representatives for the contest.

9
00:00:27,215 --> 00:00:27,840
We do.

10
00:00:27,865 --> 00:00:30,112
Well it's obvious I'm gonna
be chosen for Miss Handsome!

11
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:33,366
- But Ci-N for Mr. Pretty? I'm not so sure.
- Yeah, why me?

12
00:00:33,596 --> 00:00:34,621
- [Jay-jay screams]
- Hey!

13
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:35,326
What the heck!

14
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:36,327
Keifer!

15
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:38,078
Jay!

16
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,330
Hi, boys!

17
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:40,498
Fuck you!

18
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:46,755
[fighting]

19
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,507
[Jay-jay screams]

20
00:00:53,735 --> 00:00:54,944
Why are you still down?

21
00:00:54,969 --> 00:00:57,929
That's the 30th time you
asked me since I left the hospital.

22
00:00:57,974 --> 00:01:00,726
- We're gonna talk about the festival.
- The festival!

23
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:01,852
[Section E getting hyped]

24
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:03,228
Do we have representatives for this?

25
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:03,730
Us!

26
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:04,981
For the Battle of the Bands?

27
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:05,940
Choose a proper song.

28
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:07,399
[Section E cheering]

29
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,567
Singing contest?

30
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:11,321
Yeah, Yuri. Do it.
So I can hear you sing.

31
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:12,529
Alright. I'll do it.

32
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,949
[Section E cheering]

33
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:27,629
Who's excited? No one.

34
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:33,885
But super excited? It's me!

35
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:41,768
Oh, yes!

36
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:43,143
Wow!

37
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:44,312
Let's go, baby!

38
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,899
[cheering]

39
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:51,361
[Jay-jay exclaims excitedly]

40
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,868
- You know where chickens come from?
- Wow...

41
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,702
Do you know where?

42
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:02,079
Hey, give me some!

43
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,998
Give you? Why don't you
ask your mom for it?

44
00:02:04,123 --> 00:02:05,666
Didn't you guys eat all of my chocolate?

45
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:06,834
- Whatever!
- Buy your own chicken!

46
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,836
Let's go to the jail booth, boys.

47
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:13,174
[students bickering]

48
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:15,051
Sir, let me buy one.

49
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,218
Okay!

50
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,928
That's the one I like.

51
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:20,097
Could you just list my
name for the payment?

52
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,391
I'll pay it later.
- Okay.

53
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:22,641
Thanks!

54
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:25,979
Welcome to the HVIS Festival!

55
00:02:26,145 --> 00:02:31,109
As always, I'm your DJ and I'll be with you
throughout the next five days.

56
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,989
You can send in your music requests,
your messages, whatever it is.

57
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,368
And speaking of messages,
we already have one here!

58
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:44,163
This message is for Ketchup,
from your Mayonnaise.

59
00:02:44,188 --> 00:02:47,399
- Ketchup?
- Many might come between the two of us...

60
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:51,004
But again and again, my heart
will always choose you.

61
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:54,117
That is so heartwarming.

62
00:02:55,066 --> 00:02:57,218
But why would anyone come between them?

63
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:00,722
Oh, but whatever it may be,
once the heart starts beating for someone,

64
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,182
That's it, there's nothing
you can do about it.

65
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:04,391
Oh, dear.

66
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:06,184
Who will bail him out?

67
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:08,354
Who will bail him out?
Answer quickly.

68
00:03:08,538 --> 00:03:10,038
- Hey, Jay-jay!
- Jay.

69
00:03:10,063 --> 00:03:11,732
We fetched you,
but then you ditched us?

70
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:12,609
[Jay-jay smiles]

71
00:03:12,634 --> 00:03:14,385
I'm sorry. I got too excited.

72
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:16,957
Hold on. Where's Ci-N?
Why isn't he with you?

73
00:03:17,035 --> 00:03:19,883
Over there. He already ditched
me even before I arrived.

74
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,534
He went over to flirt with Rakki.

75
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,036
What a flirt.

76
00:03:24,232 --> 00:03:25,984
Hey. Can I have a bite?

77
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,456
I just bought these.

78
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,167
- Just buy it yourselves!
- Treat us!

79
00:03:29,233 --> 00:03:31,109
How about this?
You pay for my gas.

80
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,300
Baby!

81
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:41,053
- She called you.
- Alright. See you later! I'll be back.

82
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:41,721
Bye bye!

83
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,014
Baby!

84
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,017
Are you okay?

85
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:52,565
I'm glad I was part of the reason why these
two have a stronger relationship now.

86
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:55,252
You look so handsome.
- [David] I'm here at the festival.

87
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,712
- Chill, it's just me.
- You're so silly.

88
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,631
- [David] Okay, I'll pick you up.
- I wish that for everyone.

89
00:03:58,655 --> 00:03:59,655
Wait for me.

90
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:00,907
Wait a moment.

91
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:02,318
Okay.

92
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:05,703
Jay, I'll head out for a bit.
I'll just fetch my girlfriend.

93
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,789
- See you later.
- Alright.

94
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,666
Yes, I'm on my way.

95
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,711
What the hell? All the love birds
left me here alone.

96
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,216
[phone ringing]

97
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,226
Hey, it's Yogorino!

98
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:29,434
Excuse me. Excuse me.

99
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,188
Thank you.

100
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,060
What the hell?
You're making fun of me again.

101
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,231
Having fun without me?

102
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,236
You have ice cream on your face.

103
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,456
You want that?

104
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,255
Okay. Sir. I'll try this game.

105
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:42,300
- You're gonna play?
- Yes.

106
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,385
How can I win this teddy bear?

107
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:47,638
So, leaning forward is against the rules.

108
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:49,866
You only have seven tries.

109
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,435
You need to shoot five rings
to win the teddy bear.

110
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,979
Okay. Alright.

111
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:57,482
You can do it.

112
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,027
I'll win this game for you.

113
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,238
Okay?

114
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,158
Here I go.

115
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:10,328
Okay. First shot. Basic.

116
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,208
Okay.

117
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,002
It's just the first shot.

118
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:21,631
That's two tries.

119
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,840
[Keifer chuckles]

120
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:26,384
Okay.

121
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,058
Maybe there's wind in here?

122
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,435
But sir, we're indoors.
There's no wind,

123
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,145
so just try again.

124
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:37,730
Is that so?

125
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,523
Alright. If you get it in four shots,
I'll give you the teddy bear.

126
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:40,441
Okay.

127
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:41,441
Alright.

128
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,742
Sir, isn't this line too far away?

129
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,660
I'm just over here, sir.
I never approached it.

130
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:52,829
I didn't move it either.

131
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:55,164
Alright, mercy. Three shoots.

132
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,248
And you can win this teddy bear.
- You're all talk.

133
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:01,879
Shhh!

134
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:07,385
[Jay-jay chuckles]

135
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,390
Sir, answer me.
Is this regulation?

136
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,557
Yes, sir.

137
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:14,891
Oh, really?

138
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,101
Are you sure?

139
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,062
You have two left.
Just try and try.

140
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:28,030
- Great. Zero.
- One last, sir.

141
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,276
- He can do it.
- You can do it.

142
00:07:30,501 --> 00:07:31,501
You can do it.

143
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,244
One last try, sir.

144
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,537
[Keifer exhales]

145
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,749
Look. He can do it.

146
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,085
He — can't.

147
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,754
- [Jay-jay laughing]
- Oops, sir.

148
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,548
Game over.

149
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,174
Boring game.

150
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,093
You're a sore loser.

151
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,400
You know what?

152
00:07:53,425 --> 00:07:54,425
Mm?

153
00:07:54,673 --> 00:07:56,133
I'll win you something better.

154
00:07:56,952 --> 00:07:58,037
And what could that be?

155
00:07:58,763 --> 00:07:59,848
Battle of the Bands.

156
00:08:01,328 --> 00:08:02,328
Really?

157
00:08:02,842 --> 00:08:03,842
Can you?

158
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:06,444
I'll win Battle of the Bands.

159
00:08:08,157 --> 00:08:09,367
And I'll give you the trophy.

160
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:13,191
Deal.

161
00:08:13,234 --> 00:08:14,652
You'll just lose there too.

162
00:08:14,777 --> 00:08:15,777
Deal.

163
00:08:18,614 --> 00:08:19,614
Okay.

164
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,201
I'm gonna win it.

165
00:08:23,494 --> 00:08:24,537
By the way,

166
00:08:25,121 --> 00:08:26,497
don't forget your duties.

167
00:08:26,914 --> 00:08:27,914
Fine.

168
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:35,131
Promise you, I'm gonna win.

169
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:20,903
It's time for night duties.
Partner up! Jay-jay's with me.

170
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:22,363
We need to check here.

171
00:10:22,571 --> 00:10:24,865
Some Grade 11 students
stay here after, so...

172
00:10:25,074 --> 00:10:26,075
We gotta check.

173
00:10:27,201 --> 00:10:31,288
I don't know what to feel. Out of all the
people that could be my patrol partner…

174
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:34,124
It had to be the King of Assholes.

175
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:39,546
Just my luck! Not only were we
assigned to a haunted building,

176
00:10:39,547 --> 00:10:42,049
I was also partnered up
with a possessed man!

177
00:10:45,302 --> 00:10:46,303
What's that?

178
00:10:47,137 --> 00:10:50,724
[Jay-jay humming]

179
00:10:59,942 --> 00:11:01,318
Stop singing.

180
00:11:01,777 --> 00:11:03,070
You're too loud.

181
00:11:03,737 --> 00:11:04,947
And so what?

182
00:11:05,447 --> 00:11:07,866
The silence is creeping me out.

183
00:11:08,409 --> 00:11:12,162
[Jay-jay humming]

184
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,292
What's the title of that song?

185
00:11:19,336 --> 00:11:21,630
"You're The Miss Universe of My Life."

186
00:11:22,172 --> 00:11:25,175
- You're The Miss Universe of My Life?
- Uh-huh.

187
00:11:25,676 --> 00:11:27,344
Isn't that an old song?

188
00:11:28,095 --> 00:11:29,430
Why is that your favorite?

189
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:31,765
I don't know.

190
00:11:32,141 --> 00:11:33,225
It just my favorite.

191
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,854
Maybe because…

192
00:11:37,813 --> 00:11:39,606
Your mom likes it too?

193
00:11:42,484 --> 00:11:45,779
If this is my mom's favorite song,
I would probably hate it.

194
00:11:46,071 --> 00:11:47,823
I would curse it for good measure.

195
00:11:49,325 --> 00:11:52,578
I just know that this
song is special to me.

196
00:11:53,078 --> 00:11:54,078
The reason?

197
00:11:55,122 --> 00:11:56,122
Only god knows.

198
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:06,508
How about you?

199
00:12:06,884 --> 00:12:08,761
Do you know your
mom's favorite song?

200
00:12:09,636 --> 00:12:11,263
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.

201
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:13,765
Wait...

202
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,392
Ah!

203
00:12:15,517 --> 00:12:16,517
I know.

204
00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:21,731
[Keifer humming]

205
00:12:21,732 --> 00:12:23,192
[Jay-jay laughs]

206
00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:24,943
But that's a lullaby.

207
00:12:26,862 --> 00:12:28,446
It's a lullaby, isn't it?

208
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:29,447
And?

209
00:12:30,407 --> 00:12:32,493
- How about this?
- Oh?

210
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:34,535
This song reminds me of my dad.

211
00:12:34,536 --> 00:12:35,536
What?

212
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,164
[Jay-jay clears her throat]

213
00:12:45,589 --> 00:12:47,466
I don't hear anything.

214
00:12:47,966 --> 00:12:51,387
That's because
I haven't met my dad yet.

215
00:12:51,553 --> 00:12:52,638
So it's non-existent.

216
00:12:58,727 --> 00:13:00,562
Don't be late for the
Battle of the Bands.

217
00:13:01,855 --> 00:13:02,855
Remember.

218
00:13:03,148 --> 00:13:05,567
I promised you
I'm winning you that trophy.

219
00:13:06,944 --> 00:13:08,278
Yeah right.

220
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:10,447
I'll watch you lose.

221
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:11,656
Oh?

222
00:13:11,698 --> 00:13:13,450
- Lose?
- Yeah.

223
00:13:13,784 --> 00:13:15,577
Fine. Whatever you say.

224
00:13:17,413 --> 00:13:18,664
[Jay-jay screams]

225
00:13:19,081 --> 00:13:21,750
[humming]

226
00:13:25,254 --> 00:13:26,380
Are you scared?

227
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:56,094
Weird, but when I'm with him, I feel safe.

228
00:14:07,557 --> 00:14:09,540
Jay-jay, are you crazy?

229
00:14:20,328 --> 00:14:23,122
- Hey, that's Josh.
- Josh!

230
00:14:23,123 --> 00:14:24,124
Josh!

231
00:14:24,749 --> 00:14:26,126
Why is he smiling?

232
00:14:26,835 --> 00:14:27,878
I don't know.

233
00:14:30,005 --> 00:14:31,173
He came from here.

234
00:14:32,048 --> 00:14:33,300
Let's check?

235
00:14:36,761 --> 00:14:37,846
[ghost shrieks]

236
00:14:38,096 --> 00:14:39,514
[Jay-jay and Keifer screams]

237
00:14:49,983 --> 00:14:53,695
[audience cheering]

238
00:14:54,446 --> 00:14:58,699
It is now the 2nd quarter
and the Bull Fighters are up by five.

239
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:02,786
Wherein our Bull Fighters
are looking to throw in the lead.

240
00:15:02,787 --> 00:15:04,831
As they got the possession.

241
00:15:07,334 --> 00:15:13,173
The score is still 38-46
in favor of Lincoln High.

242
00:15:14,925 --> 00:15:16,843
- Go!
- Will you be quiet?

243
00:15:17,385 --> 00:15:19,929
This is a basketball game.
Where do you think we are, at a convent?!

244
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:23,308
- Alright— Oh!
- Hey! What was that?

245
00:15:23,558 --> 00:15:26,478
What kind of screen was that?!

246
00:15:26,503 --> 00:15:29,714
With only a second left
in the second quarter!

247
00:15:29,898 --> 00:15:34,653
It seems to be looking like
a flagrant foul!

248
00:15:35,362 --> 00:15:38,657
The score is still at 38-46
in favor of Lincoln High.

249
00:15:39,282 --> 00:15:40,450
What the hell was that?!

250
00:15:40,742 --> 00:15:42,118
- [crowd booing]
- Hey, come on!

251
00:15:42,244 --> 00:15:46,164
- Play fairly! You're all dirty cheaters!
- The referee has called this one a technical foul.

252
00:15:47,499 --> 00:15:52,587
So that means HVIS Shark Slayers
would get one free throw...

253
00:15:53,213 --> 00:15:55,882
[cheering]

254
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:04,515
Remember ladies and gentlemen
there was that deliberate foul

255
00:16:04,516 --> 00:16:06,183
that will get the Shark
Slayers one free throw.

256
00:16:06,184 --> 00:16:08,412
- That will get the Shark Slayers one free throw.
- Fix your game! Focus!

257
00:16:08,436 --> 00:16:11,606
HVIS fight! Let's win!

258
00:16:13,358 --> 00:16:14,734
Nice one!

259
00:16:19,114 --> 00:16:21,324
Hey you, sub in!

260
00:16:25,537 --> 00:16:28,391
Why would you choose that one
when it's a shooting guard that's injured?!

261
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:31,376
- Will the Shark Slayers have enough?
- Coach, use your brain!

262
00:16:32,043 --> 00:16:34,754
Let's see how this will change.

263
00:16:35,046 --> 00:16:36,339
Give it your best shot!

264
00:16:37,549 --> 00:16:38,550
Focus, guys!

265
00:16:41,553 --> 00:16:45,055
[crowd]
HVIS fight, let's win!

266
00:16:45,056 --> 00:16:46,474
This is gonna be crucial!

267
00:16:46,766 --> 00:16:52,606
61-66, in favor of the Bull Fighters.
Oh what a game it has been!

268
00:16:52,897 --> 00:16:57,235
Three... two... and that's
the end of the third quarter!

269
00:16:57,402 --> 00:17:02,574
The score right now 61-66
in favor of the Bull Fighters!

270
00:17:02,657 --> 00:17:06,119
Oh this is gonna be an interesting
story for the Shark Slayers.

271
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:08,580
They've got to pull out a miracle!

272
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,915
We will find out in the fourth!

273
00:17:12,417 --> 00:17:15,210
Why is he insisting the
shooting guard position on #23?!

274
00:17:15,211 --> 00:17:16,671
It should be Felix!

275
00:17:16,796 --> 00:17:17,796
Move over! Move!

276
00:17:17,881 --> 00:17:19,132
Are you meddling again?

277
00:17:19,591 --> 00:17:20,967
I said, move over!

278
00:17:21,176 --> 00:17:22,552
Excuse me. Excuse me.

279
00:17:22,927 --> 00:17:24,159
Move, move, move!

280
00:17:24,971 --> 00:17:26,306
Come here. Come!

281
00:17:27,724 --> 00:17:28,724
Come on!

282
00:17:28,975 --> 00:17:30,518
Coach! Coach!

283
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,020
Who the hell are you?!

284
00:17:33,355 --> 00:17:34,563
You don't know me.

285
00:17:34,564 --> 00:17:36,358
But you still have a secret weapon here.

286
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:38,924
This guy! Your natural shooting guard!

287
00:17:40,779 --> 00:17:41,987
Jay, it's embarrassing.

288
00:17:41,988 --> 00:17:44,574
Coach, you can see you're
already short on players.

289
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,620
You know how good
of a player Collins is, Coach.

290
00:17:48,745 --> 00:17:49,745
Can you handle it?

291
00:17:49,829 --> 00:17:51,498
Yes, Coach! I can!

292
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,293
I'll put you in, Collins.

293
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,087
But give it your best shot.

294
00:17:57,379 --> 00:17:58,338
This is your last chance.

295
00:17:58,339 --> 00:18:00,423
Yes, Coach! I'll just grab
my jersey in the locker!

296
00:18:00,715 --> 00:18:01,424
Go!

297
00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:03,069
- Thank you so much!
- Yes! Go Collins!

298
00:18:03,134 --> 00:18:06,096
It seems like the Shark
Slayers are adding a new player.

299
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:09,015
Wait, is that Felix Collins?

300
00:18:16,231 --> 00:18:17,607
Meddling successful?

301
00:18:19,609 --> 00:18:23,029
HVIS let's fight! Let's win!

302
00:18:23,154 --> 00:18:26,408
HVIS let's fight! Let's win!

303
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,202
Just enough for the final play,
ladies and gentlemen.

304
00:18:30,203 --> 00:18:33,123
HVIS now having the ball.

305
00:18:33,415 --> 00:18:38,294
With Felix Collins who's been
instrumental in the fourth quarter.

306
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,380
Here we go. Here's the set-up of the play,
ladies and gentlemen.

307
00:18:41,381 --> 00:18:42,674
Fifteen remaining.

308
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,718
Who will take the shot?

309
00:18:46,511 --> 00:18:47,970
We have ten seconds remaining...

310
00:18:47,971 --> 00:18:51,808
right on time for the final play
for the Shark Slayers.

311
00:18:51,933 --> 00:18:54,436
The score right now 73-75.

312
00:18:54,561 --> 00:18:57,105
It has been a story of a miracle!

313
00:18:59,357 --> 00:19:03,820
This is Felix Collins pulling it off
for the Shark Slayers!

314
00:19:04,529 --> 00:19:07,365
He thought about it, passed it to Collins!

315
00:19:07,699 --> 00:19:10,410
Three... two... Collins for the win!

316
00:19:14,497 --> 00:19:16,207
Collins for the win!

317
00:19:17,167 --> 00:19:19,586
[audience cheering]
- Yeah! What a shot!

318
00:19:19,836 --> 00:19:24,966
A new star is born by
the name of Felix Collins!

319
00:19:25,216 --> 00:19:27,968
HVIS wins it!

320
00:19:27,969 --> 00:19:30,472
HVIS fight, let's win!

321
00:19:30,597 --> 00:19:37,811
There you have it, folks.
Our score, 75-76 in favor of HVIS.

322
00:19:37,812 --> 00:19:41,982
And our champion! Congratulations!

323
00:19:41,983 --> 00:19:45,153
[cheering]

324
00:19:47,238 --> 00:19:49,616
HVIS let's fight! Let's win!

325
00:19:50,033 --> 00:19:53,161
HVIS let's fight! Let's win!

326
00:19:54,454 --> 00:19:56,538
- Oh my gosh!
- They're so good, right?!

327
00:19:56,539 --> 00:19:59,000
HVIS! HVIS!

328
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:01,460
Collins! You're so awesome!

329
00:20:01,461 --> 00:20:04,047
[cheering]

330
00:20:08,927 --> 00:20:10,552
Let's do it for the money!

331
00:20:10,553 --> 00:20:12,888
5, 6, 7 — No. That's not it.

332
00:20:12,889 --> 00:20:16,184
5, 6, 7, 8. Boom!

333
00:20:16,351 --> 00:20:18,477
Great! So cool!

334
00:20:18,478 --> 00:20:20,354
- Stunning!
- Are you satisfied with that?

335
00:20:20,355 --> 00:20:21,522
How are you to find out?

336
00:20:21,523 --> 00:20:22,898
I watched you of course!

337
00:20:22,899 --> 00:20:25,567
Whoa! Your breath stinks!
Let's just talk over there.

338
00:20:25,568 --> 00:20:26,736
Stop talking already.

339
00:20:27,111 --> 00:20:28,404
Just move quickly.

340
00:20:28,655 --> 00:20:30,323
- What's that?
- Ci-N has a solo show.

341
00:20:30,448 --> 00:20:32,116
I'm a worm sprinkled with salt.

342
00:20:32,742 --> 00:20:34,911
Will you stop that, Ci. It's annoying.

343
00:20:35,078 --> 00:20:36,788
This is a championship winning move.

344
00:20:36,913 --> 00:20:38,790
Championship?
Your dance is disgusting.

345
00:20:38,873 --> 00:20:40,750
- Yeah. Disgusting.
- Right?

346
00:20:41,417 --> 00:20:44,295
Why did you stop?
You're shy in front of Rakki?

347
00:20:44,504 --> 00:20:45,921
This guy…

348
00:20:45,922 --> 00:20:47,965
You say you're disgusted,
but you saved me when I was in trouble.

349
00:20:47,966 --> 00:20:49,884
I just felt sorry for you.

350
00:20:51,219 --> 00:20:52,219
I'll grab my things.

351
00:20:52,637 --> 00:20:54,012
He really stopped dancing.

352
00:20:54,013 --> 00:20:55,473
Why are you grabbing your things?

353
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,893
And you, what are you doing here?

354
00:20:59,143 --> 00:21:00,686
That guy's been bugging me.

355
00:21:00,687 --> 00:21:03,606
He wants me to teach him how to
put on make-up for Mr. Pretty.

356
00:21:04,315 --> 00:21:07,443
He's been so insistent, so I gave in.

357
00:21:09,153 --> 00:21:11,238
- But didn't I already?—
- Shh! Let's go.

358
00:21:11,239 --> 00:21:12,519
Where will you teach me make-up?

359
00:21:12,782 --> 00:21:14,575
At the bowling alley? At the coffee shop?

360
00:21:14,576 --> 00:21:17,287
Or in a fine dining restaurant?

361
00:21:18,121 --> 00:21:20,281
Wow, you don't need
convincing when it comes to Rakki.

362
00:21:26,212 --> 00:21:29,883
[Text message]
Jay-jay, please. I'm begging you.

363
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,510
Cyrus' mom is getting on my nerves.

364
00:21:34,012 --> 00:21:35,805
But at least I can feel her
concern for him.

365
00:21:36,514 --> 00:21:37,891
Unlike my mom towards me.

366
00:21:39,392 --> 00:21:42,102
Hey, you're just playing around.
Are you done practicing?

367
00:21:42,103 --> 00:21:43,562
Yeah, we're almost finished here.

- Congrats!
- Jay-jay, thanks again.

371
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:00,455
Thank you.

372
00:22:00,456 --> 00:22:02,415
Why me? You're the one
who won the game.

373
00:22:02,707 --> 00:22:04,250
Of course.

374
00:22:04,792 --> 00:22:07,169
I wouldn't be there if it wasn't for you.

375
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:10,006
And you know what?
The team captain…

376
00:22:10,632 --> 00:22:13,550
and the university coaches,
they're all recruiting me.

377
00:22:13,551 --> 00:22:16,471
They want me on the team.
They want to train me.

378
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:18,806
Thanks again, Jay.

379
00:22:19,015 --> 00:22:21,850
That's amazing! Don't forget
me when you're famous!

380
00:22:21,851 --> 00:22:23,478
- Why would I ever forget you?
- Ouch.

381
00:22:27,315 --> 00:22:30,944
By the way, are you free the next day?

382
00:22:32,737 --> 00:22:34,989
I think I am. Why?

383
00:22:35,865 --> 00:22:38,451
If you're interested,
maybe you'd like to join us.

384
00:22:38,534 --> 00:22:40,661
We're celebrating our victory.

385
00:22:40,662 --> 00:22:43,581
The team captain is hosting
a party at his place.

386
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:47,168
- Yeah, I can go.
- Yes! Thank you.

387
00:22:48,795 --> 00:22:50,379
Just don't tell the other guys, okay?

388
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,048
It's our secret, Jay.

389
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,507
Aries is gonna be there.

390
00:22:53,508 --> 00:22:57,595
They can't come because you know.
A fight might break out.

391
00:22:58,179 --> 00:22:59,973
- Is that okay?
- Yeah. Sure.

392
00:23:00,807 --> 00:23:01,808
Thank you, Jay.

393
00:23:03,851 --> 00:23:04,851
Oh, and…

394
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:07,271
Wouldn't this upset Aries?

395
00:23:07,605 --> 00:23:09,649
Wouldn't he get mad that you helped me?

396
00:23:10,692 --> 00:23:12,194
Don't mind that him.

397
00:23:12,694 --> 00:23:14,362
I'm used to him being upset at me.

398
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:15,822
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

399
00:23:16,406 --> 00:23:17,406
Thank you, Jay.

400
00:23:17,448 --> 00:23:20,492
Let me know if you want to come, okay?

401
00:23:20,493 --> 00:23:22,035
Yeah, I already said yes.

402
00:23:22,036 --> 00:23:23,870
- You were so good.
- Thank you.

403
00:23:23,871 --> 00:23:25,431
- I'm so proud of you.
- That's nothing.

404
00:23:42,265 --> 00:23:44,267
Section D is so traumatizing.

405
00:23:44,726 --> 00:23:47,227
The dance looks stupid! Look!
Their bodies are too stiff.

Oh my, seems like the judges really
enjoyed that one. I know I did.

417
00:24:20,053 --> 00:24:23,514
But of course, no one can beat Section A.

418
00:24:23,639 --> 00:24:25,224
Yup. I agree.

419
00:24:25,475 --> 00:24:28,894
Anyway. Let's give it up
for our next performers.

420
00:24:28,895 --> 00:24:30,271
Which will be...

- Time for duties.
- It's over? That's it?

538
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:09,553
- Time for duties.
- Let's go, dude.

539
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:19,854
I can't be partners with Keifer tonight.

540
00:36:19,855 --> 00:36:21,982
Especially after the Battle of the Bands.

541
00:36:22,149 --> 00:36:23,149
I just can't.

542
00:36:24,777 --> 00:36:26,195
Good thing Yuri's here.

543
00:36:29,948 --> 00:36:30,532
Jay...

544
00:36:30,741 --> 00:36:31,741
are you okay?

545
00:36:31,992 --> 00:36:33,494
Oh, yeah.

546
00:36:34,036 --> 00:36:36,455
You were closest to me,
so I grabbed you without thinking.

547
00:36:37,164 --> 00:36:38,916
You can tell me if something's bugging you.

548
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,380
[Jay-jay sighs]

549
00:36:56,308 --> 00:36:57,434
You know...

550
00:36:58,018 --> 00:36:59,853
You know that feeling when...

551
00:37:01,021 --> 00:37:03,357
You're falling for someone
even though you don't want to?

552
00:37:07,027 --> 00:37:08,027
Of course.

553
00:37:09,071 --> 00:37:10,197
What can I do?

554
00:37:10,572 --> 00:37:11,572
With what?

555
00:37:13,116 --> 00:37:14,201
To avoid it.

556
00:37:14,827 --> 00:37:15,827
Or...

557
00:37:16,203 --> 00:37:17,579
stop myself from falling.

558
00:37:18,121 --> 00:37:19,581
You can't really avoid it, Jay.

559
00:37:21,959 --> 00:37:23,168
It can't be controlled.

560
00:37:24,002 --> 00:37:25,587
You can hide it.

561
00:37:25,963 --> 00:37:27,214
But you can't avoid it.

562
00:37:30,425 --> 00:37:31,425
I refuse to.

563
00:37:33,512 --> 00:37:34,992
But why do you want to stop yourself?

564
00:37:36,849 --> 00:37:37,933
Because he's an idiot.

565
00:37:38,976 --> 00:37:40,185
A jerk. An asshole.

566
00:37:40,727 --> 00:37:42,354
He's a lunatic. Deranged.

567
00:37:45,065 --> 00:37:46,775
So, you're talking about yourself?

568
00:37:47,734 --> 00:37:50,028
Who's that unlucky guy
you're having feelings for?

569
00:37:54,074 --> 00:37:55,576
I'm just confused about it.

570
00:37:57,286 --> 00:37:58,495
You're not confused, Jay.

571
00:37:59,454 --> 00:38:00,455
You're just in denial.

572
00:38:00,956 --> 00:38:03,208
I told you, I'm just confused.

573
00:38:03,584 --> 00:38:04,584
But why?

574
00:38:07,212 --> 00:38:08,630
I'm annoyed at him.

575
00:38:09,298 --> 00:38:11,925
You see how that Keifer treats me.

576
00:38:19,099 --> 00:38:20,859
So, Keifer's the one
you were talking about.

577
00:38:21,643 --> 00:38:22,643
Hey.

578
00:38:23,061 --> 00:38:25,480
Don't tell it to anyone. It's a secret.

579
00:38:26,231 --> 00:38:27,231
Alright.

580
00:38:27,399 --> 00:38:28,442
I won't tell.

581
00:38:29,067 --> 00:38:30,067
Promise it, okay?

582
00:38:30,193 --> 00:38:31,361
Promise.

583
00:38:34,823 --> 00:38:35,823
How about you?

584
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,868
Don't you like anyone?

585
00:38:39,703 --> 00:38:40,703
I like someone.

586
00:38:42,122 --> 00:38:43,122
Who?

587
00:38:46,001 --> 00:38:47,544
I won't tell you about her.

588
00:38:48,879 --> 00:38:50,130
So unfair.

589
00:38:51,423 --> 00:38:52,382
But she's lucky.

590
00:38:52,383 --> 00:38:53,842
Whoever she is.

591
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:00,430
I'll be lucky too if she
reciprocates my feelings.

592
00:39:01,516 --> 00:39:05,479
Even if she doesn't like you back,
you can just get any girl around here.

593
00:39:05,646 --> 00:39:06,772
You're Yuri after all.

594
00:39:08,482 --> 00:39:09,566
She's one of a kind.

595
00:39:19,493 --> 00:39:20,702
Let's throw these away.

596
00:39:21,536 --> 00:39:22,788
Also, I need to pee.

597
00:39:26,075 --> 00:39:27,993
You're just excited to see Keifer.

598
00:39:28,018 --> 00:39:30,353
No! I just really need to pee.

599
00:39:30,712 --> 00:39:32,756
- Let's go.
- Keifer, Jay-jay.

600
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:34,007
KeiJay.

601
00:39:34,008 --> 00:39:35,424
I told you it's a secret.

602
00:39:35,425 --> 00:39:37,594
- Your voice is too loud!
- JayFer...

603
00:39:58,907 --> 00:40:00,283
I think it's safe here.

604
00:40:01,034 --> 00:40:02,034
You go ahead.

605
00:40:02,244 --> 00:40:03,244
I'll go to the toilet.

606
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:04,370
I'll wait for you.

607
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:06,330
It's alright.

608
00:40:08,834 --> 00:40:09,834
Fine.

609
00:40:16,049 --> 00:40:17,634
[Jay-jay gasps]

610
00:40:22,305 --> 00:40:25,308
Jay! Don't tell anyone!

611
00:40:29,521 --> 00:40:31,648
They're gone. Who are those two?

612
00:40:32,024 --> 00:40:32,941
Are they our classmates?

613
00:40:32,941 --> 00:40:33,734
Jay,

614
00:40:33,735 --> 00:40:35,444
just keep it between us.

615
00:40:35,861 --> 00:40:37,571
Don't tell anyone about it, okay?

616
00:40:38,071 --> 00:40:39,448
Especially Keifer.

617
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,616
Those two aren't out yet.

618
00:40:42,617 --> 00:40:44,703
Don't worry. I didn't even see their faces.

619
00:40:45,078 --> 00:40:48,290
- Are you sure?
- And even if I did, I won't tell anyone.

620
00:40:49,124 --> 00:40:52,127
I'm just scared of how Keifer
would react once he finds out.

621
00:40:52,919 --> 00:40:53,962
Keifer?

622
00:40:55,547 --> 00:40:58,050
He's arrogant and stupid.

623
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:00,561
But I know one thing for sure.

624
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:03,764
He'll protect anything
that's important to him.

625
00:41:04,264 --> 00:41:07,726
Section E? You're like family to him.

626
00:41:08,518 --> 00:41:11,313
Keifer's gonna protect you.
No matter what you are.

627
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:17,110
Even me, I feel safe
whenever Keifer's around.

628
00:41:19,071 --> 00:41:21,948
So don't worry about
Keifer knowing the truth.

629
00:41:22,366 --> 00:41:23,992
They're safe in Section E.

630
00:41:24,326 --> 00:41:25,994
They don't need to feel pressured.

631
00:41:26,244 --> 00:41:27,370
I don't know, Jay.

632
00:41:28,121 --> 00:41:32,667
Maybe you'll understand when you
experience a love that you need to hide.

633
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,137
You know...

634
00:41:44,138 --> 00:41:46,640
this is the first time I
heard you talk for so long.

635
00:41:47,015 --> 00:41:48,600
It's so heartfelt.

636
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:51,228
Quiet people are like that, huh? Profound.

637
00:41:52,437 --> 00:41:53,647
I'll just go to the toilet.

638
00:41:54,981 --> 00:41:56,191
I'm gonna mull things over.

639
00:41:56,316 --> 00:41:57,526
Keep it a secret.

640
00:41:57,692 --> 00:42:00,529
Yeah. Don't you trust me? It's a secret.

641
00:42:04,116 --> 00:42:06,075
- Get out!
- Don't keep us waiting.

642
00:42:06,076 --> 00:42:08,452
- Ci-N, come out now!
- You're too slow.

643
00:42:08,453 --> 00:42:11,580
- Come out quickly!
- I'm getting bored.

644
00:42:11,581 --> 00:42:13,250
- Hi, boys!
- Woah!

645
00:42:13,583 --> 00:42:16,710
- Damn!
- Very Latina!

646
00:42:16,711 --> 00:42:18,420
My name is...

647
00:42:18,421 --> 00:42:19,422
Cindy Peralta.

648
00:42:19,631 --> 00:42:21,424
[laughing]

649
00:42:24,594 --> 00:42:27,221
- Latina!
- Oh my goodness.

650
00:42:27,222 --> 00:42:29,307
- Wow!
- I had enough now.

651
00:42:29,975 --> 00:42:32,560
- It's Jay-jay's turn!
- Jay, you're up!

652
00:42:32,561 --> 00:42:34,812
- Jay-jay, come on out!
- Yeah, come on!

653
00:42:34,813 --> 00:42:39,901
[cheering]

654
00:42:41,862 --> 00:42:44,029
- Awesome!
- That'll suffice.

655
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:46,241
You boys are too happy about this, huh?

656
00:42:47,534 --> 00:42:50,203
Jay! Walk around, quick. Just walk.

657
00:42:51,913 --> 00:42:53,456
Wow! What a walk!

658
00:42:55,375 --> 00:42:56,710
Hey! Dap me up!

659
00:42:57,752 --> 00:43:01,381
- She's one of the boys now.
- So cool!

660
00:43:02,382 --> 00:43:04,092
Are you guys just horsing around?

661
00:43:04,426 --> 00:43:05,426
Are you ready?

662
00:43:05,552 --> 00:43:07,220
- Yeah, we're ready.
- It's okay.

663
00:43:07,429 --> 00:43:08,722
They're helping me out.

664
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,317
- Hey!
- Phone confiscated!

665
00:43:20,692 --> 00:43:21,776
Go try another one.

666
00:43:22,194 --> 00:43:23,653
Oh no.

667
00:43:27,699 --> 00:43:29,158
Oh, Yuri, finally.

668
00:43:29,159 --> 00:43:34,956
Jay, Cyrus is looking for you.
Maybe you can visit him,

669
00:43:35,081 --> 00:43:37,561
- [over the phone] even just for a while.
- Hey! That's my phone!

670
00:43:39,934 --> 00:43:41,129
Who's Cyrus?

671
00:43:42,689 --> 00:43:44,299
Why? What did he say?

672
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,489
He wants to see you.

673
00:43:48,845 --> 00:43:50,722
Oh. That's nothing. Don't mind it.

674
00:43:51,097 --> 00:43:53,099
Oh. Here. Is it okay?

675
00:43:53,391 --> 00:43:55,393
Yeah. Go try it on.

676
00:43:56,269 --> 00:43:57,270
I'll wear this now.

677
00:44:06,488 --> 00:44:08,031
Is it ready now?

678
00:44:08,782 --> 00:44:10,783
What's taking so long? This is so awkward.
I'm so sorry, guys.

679
00:44:10,784 --> 00:44:12,678
- I think he's not ready yet.
- [Freya] Sorry, guys.

680
00:44:12,702 --> 00:44:14,013
- What's happening?
- [Mykel] Okay guys so, apparently...

681
00:44:14,037 --> 00:44:16,581
Yuri's music isn't ready yet.

682
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,292
Apparently, there's been
some technical difficulties.

683
00:44:19,417 --> 00:44:22,336
Maybe they didn't really prepare anything.

684
00:44:22,337 --> 00:44:23,879
What the hell. Freya's so annoying.

685
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,882
She just had to announce the problem.

686
00:44:25,966 --> 00:44:26,925
What an attention seeker.

687
00:44:26,926 --> 00:44:28,677
I'm just joking. Peace.

688
00:44:28,969 --> 00:44:30,512
What? What happened? What's wrong?

689
00:44:31,054 --> 00:44:33,098
Fuck! They can't find Yuri's audio file!

690
00:44:33,223 --> 00:44:34,432
What?!

691
00:44:35,084 --> 00:44:37,727
Yuri just recorded it.
We don't have a back-up!

692
00:44:38,061 --> 00:44:39,646
Maybe we were sabotaged!

693
00:44:40,146 --> 00:44:41,856
So, what now?

694
00:44:42,607 --> 00:44:44,192
Blaster, just give him a guitar.

695
00:44:45,151 --> 00:44:47,278
Blaster! Go Blaster!

696
00:44:47,279 --> 00:44:49,239
Go, quickly!

697
00:44:50,073 --> 00:44:51,199
Oh there it is!

698
00:44:51,324 --> 00:44:54,452
You should've told us you
prepared an acoustic guitar.

699
00:44:54,869 --> 00:44:58,415
A nyway. He's Yuri Hanamitchi from
Section E. Please enjoy the performance.

700
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:06,540
[cheering]

701
00:45:30,989 --> 00:45:33,241
Your voice's so good!

702
00:45:50,717 --> 00:45:55,430
Yuri's such a cool guy.
The girl he likes is so lucky.

703
00:46:00,522 --> 00:46:05,505
Honestly, I have a crush
on Yuri. Just a little bit.

704
00:46:18,953 --> 00:46:20,497
Yuri likes someone.

705
00:46:21,956 --> 00:46:23,500
So you know about it too?

706
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:27,629
He's singing to her right now.

707
00:46:27,982 --> 00:46:28,982
Really?

708
00:46:29,264 --> 00:46:31,058
Who is she? She's so lucky.

709
00:47:07,335 --> 00:47:08,712
I'll just go to the toilet.

710
00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:35,238
[footsteps]

711
00:47:35,530 --> 00:47:37,198
What's up with Yuri?!

712
00:47:39,993 --> 00:47:41,369
Was that really for me?

713
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,623
He was looking straight at me!

714
00:47:46,297 --> 00:47:48,835
But it can't be, right? Oh,
God, don't be delusional.

715
00:47:49,043 --> 00:47:50,336
Delusional! Delusional!

716
00:47:52,464 --> 00:47:54,215
I'm so delusional...

717
00:47:58,803 --> 00:47:59,803
Grace?

718
00:48:03,808 --> 00:48:05,226
Did something happen?

719
00:48:07,187 --> 00:48:09,022
He said he's gonna take responsibility.

720
00:48:10,899 --> 00:48:13,151
But he doesn't want to get back together.

721
00:48:13,485 --> 00:48:14,485
Jay…

722
00:48:15,904 --> 00:48:17,780
I endured everything.

723
00:48:20,408 --> 00:48:22,869
I tried all I could.

724
00:48:24,037 --> 00:48:26,873
I tried to cure my depression.

725
00:48:27,415 --> 00:48:29,209
That's why I went to therapy.

726
00:48:31,294 --> 00:48:33,379
Because I wanted to die.

727
00:48:34,422 --> 00:48:35,422
But Jay…

728
00:48:36,841 --> 00:48:38,176
It's Denzel.

729
00:48:40,512 --> 00:48:43,348
It's Denzel that I need.

730
00:48:47,185 --> 00:48:48,185
Let's go.

731
00:48:48,686 --> 00:48:49,938
Come with me.

732
00:48:54,417 --> 00:48:56,723
- You're so good, Yuri!
- You were so awesome!

733
00:48:56,986 --> 00:48:59,531
- That was amazing.
- I admire you.

734
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:05,703
Jay, why did you disappear all of a sudden?

735
00:49:06,371 --> 00:49:07,789
I'll explain it later.

736
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:11,292
Denzel.

737
00:49:12,627 --> 00:49:13,962
What's your plan with Grace?

738
00:49:14,295 --> 00:49:15,295
Huh?

739
00:49:16,089 --> 00:49:18,424
I thought it's settled.
I'm gonna take responsibility.

740
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,469
That's what I thought too.
But she's crying again.

741
00:49:23,304 --> 00:49:24,304
Jay...

742
00:49:25,181 --> 00:49:27,308
I'm not sure about what she wants.

743
00:49:28,142 --> 00:49:30,395
I'm working hard for the baby.

744
00:49:30,895 --> 00:49:34,565
But what about Grace?

745
00:49:40,113 --> 00:49:41,322
Don't you love her?

746
00:49:47,328 --> 00:49:48,705
I love Grace.

747
00:49:50,582 --> 00:49:52,083
I'm just scared.

748
00:49:52,959 --> 00:49:55,253
If she's still mad at me about what I did.

749
00:49:56,045 --> 00:49:59,446
You saw it yourself. You saw
how angry she was at me.

750
00:50:00,675 --> 00:50:02,760
I tricked her, so she'll fall for me.

751
00:50:05,847 --> 00:50:07,807
That's why I chose to stay away from her.

752
00:50:10,935 --> 00:50:14,689
Once everything's better and
I'm a man of my own, I'll court her again.

753
00:50:15,773 --> 00:50:17,859
But right now, I have nothing to show for.

754
00:50:19,902 --> 00:50:22,447
I don't want her to
think I'm still using her.

755
00:50:28,411 --> 00:50:29,454
Grace!

756
00:50:37,128 --> 00:50:38,671
Is that how you see Denzel?

757
00:50:40,131 --> 00:50:42,383
No… No.

758
00:50:44,719 --> 00:50:48,306
All of your secrets, share
them with each other.

759
00:50:49,557 --> 00:50:50,642
Don't hold back anymore.

760
00:50:56,439 --> 00:50:57,732
Grace...

761
00:50:59,233 --> 00:51:00,234
Sorry.

762
00:51:01,944 --> 00:51:03,655
Sorry, I'm such a coward, Grace.

763
00:51:06,866 --> 00:51:08,743
Let's talk about us.

764
00:51:10,662 --> 00:51:12,288
Sorry, Grace.

765
00:51:30,765 --> 00:51:33,059
Alright. Back to work. Let's go.

766
00:51:34,185 --> 00:51:35,353
Ugh, alright.

767
00:51:35,728 --> 00:51:38,429
Let's work, alright... let's go!

768
00:51:45,363 --> 00:51:46,823
Denzel is so lucky.

769
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:50,576
Grace understands him... and forgives him.

770
00:51:51,369 --> 00:51:53,454
I'm tired of keeping secrets too.

771
00:52:00,878 --> 00:52:02,171
How about we write a song, bro?

772
00:52:02,296 --> 00:52:03,172
Yeah, let's do that!

773
00:52:03,172 --> 00:52:04,090
Let's write a song.

774
00:52:04,132 --> 00:52:05,883
Yeah, good idea!

775
00:52:06,008 --> 00:52:07,760
Then we'll release it on streaming.

776
00:52:08,469 --> 00:52:09,829
Just make sure to cut me in, okay?

777
00:52:13,933 --> 00:52:17,603
I should be out of here by 10 AM
to make it to the festival.

778
00:52:22,483 --> 00:52:24,860
Was this guy my boyfriend?

779
00:52:25,107 --> 00:52:26,900
Why can't I feel anything for him?

780
00:52:31,451 --> 00:52:32,451
Jay?

781
00:52:33,578 --> 00:52:34,620
Jay-jay?

782
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:39,250
If only Cyrus' mom hadn't
begged me to come…

783
00:52:40,835 --> 00:52:42,545
Thank you for coming.

784
00:52:43,004 --> 00:52:45,089
Cass, let Jay-jay sit.

785
00:52:45,339 --> 00:52:50,553
Jay. You know, you were the first person
he looked for when he woke up.

786
00:52:52,096 --> 00:52:53,806
Come. Sit down.

787
00:53:12,533 --> 00:53:15,871
Son, Jay-jay's here.

788
00:53:16,829 --> 00:53:17,829
Jay?

789
00:53:18,664 --> 00:53:19,832
Jay-jay...

790
00:53:24,086 --> 00:53:25,213
How are you?

791
00:53:26,672 --> 00:53:29,592
They say…
you transferred schools?

792
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:35,014
I'm studying at Aries' school now.

793
00:53:35,932 --> 00:53:36,932
Tell me…

794
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:40,102
about your new classsmates.

795
00:53:41,312 --> 00:53:43,940
They're okay. Very rowdy.

796
00:53:47,151 --> 00:53:48,152
Cyrus…

797
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:52,865
I'm not gonna stay for long. I need to go.
We have an event...

798
00:53:53,115 --> 00:53:55,868
Stay here. Please.

799
00:53:56,118 --> 00:53:56,786
Stay here.

800
00:53:56,869 --> 00:53:59,914
- I need to go. I'm sorry, I can't stay.
- Jay…

801
00:54:00,915 --> 00:54:02,290
I said stay here!

802
00:54:02,291 --> 00:54:04,752
- Son!
- Cyrus, stop it!

803
00:54:04,791 --> 00:54:05,791
Stop it.

804
00:54:06,629 --> 00:54:08,631
Jay! Stay with me, Jay!

805
00:54:09,053 --> 00:54:11,633
Jay, don't go! Mom! Jay!

806
00:54:11,634 --> 00:54:13,260
- Calm down, son…
- Jay!

807
00:54:13,261 --> 00:54:14,261
Jay!

808
00:54:15,555 --> 00:54:16,597
Jay!

809
00:54:19,556 --> 00:54:20,724
Are you okay?

810
00:54:24,355 --> 00:54:26,816
What did I really do to Cyrus?

811
00:54:29,986 --> 00:54:31,821
You really can't remember?

812
00:54:36,242 --> 00:54:38,035
You beat him up.

813
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,249
He was unconscious for months.

814
00:54:45,042 --> 00:54:46,794
It's a miracle he survived.

815
00:54:49,589 --> 00:54:51,090
Sorry, but…

816
00:54:51,632 --> 00:54:53,593
I really can't remember.

817
00:55:06,856 --> 00:55:08,524
You would have been so pretty onstage.

818
00:55:08,691 --> 00:55:11,235
Thank goodness I made it
to Mr. Pretty and Miss Handsome!

819
00:55:11,611 --> 00:55:13,404
Oh? Why aren't you guys preparing?

820
00:55:13,571 --> 00:55:15,364
Jay? Where have you been all this time?

821
00:55:15,781 --> 00:55:17,949
Ah… I went somewhere first.

822
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:19,619
The contest is over, Jay.

823
00:55:19,869 --> 00:55:21,746
I didn't participate
because you weren't here.

824
00:55:22,038 --> 00:55:23,038
What?!

825
00:55:23,289 --> 00:55:24,489
It's scheduled at 1 PM, right?

826
00:55:24,790 --> 00:55:28,835
If you just answered your phone,
you'd know that they changed the time!

827
00:55:28,836 --> 00:55:29,712
Where did you go?

828
00:55:29,713 --> 00:55:31,172
Stop it! It already happened!

829
00:55:31,339 --> 00:55:33,299
I went somewhere important.

830
00:55:33,549 --> 00:55:35,635
What could be more important than us?!

831
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:37,345
Section E?!

832
00:55:37,511 --> 00:55:38,596
Me!

833
00:55:39,055 --> 00:55:40,640
I am more important!

834
00:55:44,852 --> 00:55:47,605
Just like you, I have my own problems!

835
00:55:48,147 --> 00:55:50,483
What do you want to know? My problems?!

836
00:55:51,025 --> 00:55:52,610
My ex, Cyrus!

837
00:55:53,444 --> 00:55:55,390
My ex who, until now, I
still don't remember why

838
00:55:55,415 --> 00:55:57,629
I beat up, until he
couldn't wake up anymore!

839
00:55:58,491 --> 00:55:59,575
I went to him!

840
00:56:00,409 --> 00:56:02,328
I didn't mean to miss the contest.

841
00:56:03,454 --> 00:56:04,997
I just had to go there.

842
00:56:26,368 --> 00:56:30,815
Stupid, Jay-jay. Why didn't
you check your phone?

843
00:56:36,362 --> 00:56:37,362
Jay?

844
00:56:38,364 --> 00:56:40,408
You might erase your
face with all that rubbing.

845
00:56:42,201 --> 00:56:43,327
Why are you here?

846
00:56:43,703 --> 00:56:45,788
They're announcing the winners, right?

847
00:56:49,959 --> 00:56:51,669
I was disqualified.

848
00:56:53,045 --> 00:56:54,714
Huh? Why?

849
00:56:55,548 --> 00:56:57,550
One person can't join multiple contests.

850
00:56:59,176 --> 00:57:01,929
The rules change when it comes to us,
huh? So unfair.

851
00:57:05,141 --> 00:57:06,726
Let me see that.

852
00:57:20,990 --> 00:57:23,325
Jay, who is Cyrus really?

853
00:57:26,203 --> 00:57:27,329
My ex-boyfriend.

854
00:57:29,498 --> 00:57:31,000
How did your visit go?

855
00:57:33,335 --> 00:57:34,335
Not good.

856
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:37,089
Why? What went wrong?

857
00:57:39,050 --> 00:57:40,593
He didn't want me to leave.

858
00:57:41,719 --> 00:57:43,596
He even choked me because he got angry.

859
00:57:48,642 --> 00:57:50,402
You're not gonna meet
up him anymore, right?

860
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:52,146
Never.

861
00:57:58,544 --> 00:58:00,004
Do you know how to play?

862
00:58:00,988 --> 00:58:01,988
No.

863
00:58:02,031 --> 00:58:03,491
I'll teach you.

864
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:07,787
Don't bother. I don't have the patience
to learn things like this.

865
00:58:08,204 --> 00:58:10,081
My hands are for fighting, I guess.

866
00:58:11,749 --> 00:58:13,626
I'll play for you. Give it to me.

867
01:00:02,735 --> 01:00:05,779
Jay-jay, I have a secret too.
Do you want to know?

868
01:00:06,322 --> 01:00:07,322
What?

869
01:00:09,116 --> 01:00:13,953
I can tell you, Jay-jay. That the reason
you're falling for Keifer…

870
01:00:13,954 --> 01:00:15,581
is just an elaborate plan.

871
01:00:20,226 --> 01:00:24,063
I can tell you that I fell
for you. Slowly. Gently.

872
01:00:24,715 --> 01:00:29,011
You're the one my heart truly yearns for.
And not because of some plan.

873
01:00:32,223 --> 01:00:35,768
Hey, what is it? Don't leave me hanging.

874
01:00:39,897 --> 01:00:42,066
You're the coolest girl I've ever known.

875
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:45,560
You're not like anyone else, Jay.
You're one of a kind.

876
01:00:46,195 --> 01:00:48,530
So don't look down on yourself.

877
01:00:49,031 --> 01:00:50,282
Wow.

878
01:00:52,284 --> 01:00:54,328
That's a secret. You're the first to know.

879
01:00:54,995 --> 01:00:56,956
This is the first time you
ever complimented me.

880
01:00:57,206 --> 01:00:58,206
Is that true?

881
01:00:58,374 --> 01:00:59,374
Yeah.

882
01:01:29,947 --> 01:01:31,323
Yuri...

883
01:01:58,976 --> 01:02:00,352
What is this?

884
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:04,480
Remember?

885
01:02:06,859 --> 01:02:08,068
I promised you that.

886
01:02:11,155 --> 01:02:12,155
We won.

887
01:02:13,407 --> 01:02:14,407
Oh.

888
01:02:14,450 --> 01:02:15,617
Congratulations.

889
01:02:17,411 --> 01:02:18,787
You should've seen me win.

890
01:02:20,237 --> 01:02:25,919
Why does it feel like I was caught
cheating? Oh God, please take me now!

891
01:02:30,841 --> 01:02:33,635
I'll just… check what's going on with them.

892
01:02:36,430 --> 01:02:39,600
What was that? Does
Yuri have feelings for me?

893
01:02:41,322 --> 01:02:43,142
What about my feelings for Keifer?

894
01:02:46,313 --> 01:02:50,792
Why is it so hard to stop the heart
from falling?! This is gonna be messy!

895
01:03:40,661 --> 01:03:44,914
We're here to celebrate and welcome, Felix.

896
01:03:44,915 --> 01:03:47,042
The one who led the
Shark Slayers to victory!

897
01:03:47,209 --> 01:03:49,336
Let's fucking party!

898
01:03:52,089 --> 01:03:53,424
- Calix?
- Oh?

899
01:03:53,674 --> 01:03:55,634
You, what are you doing here?
Who are you with?

900
01:03:55,659 --> 01:03:58,838
I'm with Felix, but we got separated.

901
01:03:59,555 --> 01:04:00,681
Let go of me.

902
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:02,850
- I said, let go.
- Hey.

903
01:04:03,684 --> 01:04:05,352
Mykel. Get rid of this clown.

904
01:04:06,562 --> 01:04:07,938
Have a drink first.

905
01:04:08,397 --> 01:04:09,772
No, thanks. I'm not in the mood to drink.

906
01:04:09,773 --> 01:04:11,775
Please. Just one sip. Just one sip.

907
01:04:15,988 --> 01:04:17,698
Calix said they're inside. Let's go!

908
01:04:18,157 --> 01:04:19,741
What?! Did you find her?

909
01:04:19,908 --> 01:04:20,993
Jay-jay...

910
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:22,160
Where is she?

911
01:04:22,161 --> 01:04:23,370
Where is Kiko?!

912
01:04:23,787 --> 01:04:25,289
She's my wife.

913
01:04:28,083 --> 01:04:29,518
Why don't you just go over there?

914
01:04:29,543 --> 01:04:31,462
Have fun with those bunny girls.
