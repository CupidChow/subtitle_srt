1
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:16,667
Is he your boyfriend?

2
00:00:16,938 --> 00:00:17,897
No...

3
00:00:17,922 --> 00:00:18,965
He's not her boyfriend.

4
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,158
He's my classmate.

5
00:00:20,183 --> 00:00:22,143
Freya's account hacked none other by...

6
00:00:22,168 --> 00:00:24,462
Edrix Knight.

7
00:00:24,636 --> 00:00:25,762
You owe me again.

8
00:00:25,851 --> 00:00:26,977
Say thanks to Keifer.

9
00:00:27,282 --> 00:00:29,242
- Don't be too stingy.
- Just one thank you.

10
00:00:29,267 --> 00:00:31,815
Wait! You're all so loud!
Why are you pressuring me?

11
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,301
Starting today, no one will eat upstairs.

12
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,686
Uhh, Jay… aren't we gonna ask
them to eat with us?

13
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:39,273
Why don't we cook for them?

14
00:00:39,467 --> 00:00:40,928
We have some kitchenware here, right?

15
00:00:40,952 --> 00:00:41,786
Don't touch those.

16
00:00:41,811 --> 00:00:43,188
- Who owns them?
- Eman.

17
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:46,254
We're gonna help until
your restaurant recovers.

18
00:00:46,285 --> 00:00:47,495
And who's "we"

19
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,215
What's up with him?

20
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,718
[customers screaming]

21
00:00:51,743 --> 00:00:53,328
The wind has somehow changed, huh?

22
00:00:53,986 --> 00:00:54,986
What are you doing?

23
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,265
[customers screaming]

24
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,648
Can I touch you once more?

25
00:01:00,966 --> 00:01:02,593
You wanna feel it?

26
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:04,039
Do you want to feel it?

27
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:07,518
You know this is your fault, right?

28
00:01:07,542 --> 00:01:09,225
Yeah, right. I'm treating
your wound now, right?

29
00:01:09,249 --> 00:01:10,751
Why do you always have to meddle?

30
00:01:10,776 --> 00:01:13,612
I can't stay quiet
when I know things can change.

31
00:01:13,834 --> 00:01:15,086
I can't just do nothing.

32
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:21,414
Come on already!

33
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:22,815
Are you gonna stand here all day?

34
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,840
Gosh.

35
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,477
Will you wear just one?

36
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,358
- You wear both, of course.
- Order for Table 3.

37
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:50,109
Excuse me.

38
00:01:51,179 --> 00:01:51,888
Why?

39
00:01:51,972 --> 00:01:53,015
What's your problem?

40
00:01:53,515 --> 00:01:55,267
How did Aries know we're here?

41
00:01:55,601 --> 00:01:56,601
Aries?

42
00:01:57,269 --> 00:01:58,729
Will they cause trouble here too?

43
00:01:59,104 --> 00:02:00,689
OMG!

44
00:02:01,148 --> 00:02:02,232
So it's true.

45
00:02:02,566 --> 00:02:04,735
You're just a waitress now.

46
00:02:05,277 --> 00:02:06,153
Waitress.

47
00:02:06,236 --> 00:02:07,529
It's a respectable job.

48
00:02:10,073 --> 00:02:11,450
Keifer Watson?

49
00:02:11,992 --> 00:02:12,992
What the hell?

50
00:02:13,452 --> 00:02:14,452
Seriously,

51
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,120
are you getting poor?

52
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:19,291
I don't know.

53
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:20,500
Why don't you ask my friend?

54
00:02:25,964 --> 00:02:26,964
Girl!

55
00:02:27,007 --> 00:02:28,508
You're here as well, Mica?

56
00:02:28,675 --> 00:02:32,011
Oh, no. She's not here.
It's just a picture.

57
00:02:32,012 --> 00:02:33,262
Sometimes, she's a hologram.

58
00:02:33,263 --> 00:02:34,348
So funny.

59
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:37,726
Umm, Jay. I'll get their orders.

60
00:02:38,185 --> 00:02:39,185
No.

61
00:02:40,187 --> 00:02:42,397
We want Jay-jay and Keifer to serve us.

62
00:02:49,988 --> 00:02:50,988
Okay.

63
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,200
Uhm.

64
00:02:54,701 --> 00:02:55,701
Here.

65
00:02:57,621 --> 00:02:58,455
Go ahead.

66
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,623
What's wrong with them?

67
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,290
Thank you, Jay.

68
00:03:03,335 --> 00:03:04,335
Menu.

69
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:06,171
Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!

70
00:03:15,514 --> 00:03:16,515
Don't move.

71
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,691
Why is he putting his arms around me again?
Just order quickly, please!

72
00:03:26,149 --> 00:03:26,983
I'll just go back!

73
00:03:27,109 --> 00:03:28,819
Hey, Yuri! Will you calm down?

74
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,239
Just let Keifer handle them.

75
00:03:32,781 --> 00:03:36,535
He wouldn't cause a scene
to trouble Eman's business.

76
00:03:36,993 --> 00:03:37,993
Okay?

77
00:03:40,288 --> 00:03:41,665
How are they holding up out there?

78
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:46,210
[Kiko clears his throat]

79
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,462
Can we order now?

80
00:03:49,381 --> 00:03:51,550
I'll have the Ultimate Pizza.

81
00:03:52,426 --> 00:03:53,426
Okay.

82
00:03:53,593 --> 00:03:55,762
I'll have the same,
plus bottomless iced tea.

83
00:03:57,431 --> 00:04:01,267
I'll have the Goddess Salad,
but hold the alfalfa sprouts.

84
00:04:01,268 --> 00:04:05,689
And make sure to give me
six cherry tomatoes. None more, none less.

85
00:04:05,856 --> 00:04:08,984
And the dressing, on the side. Obviously.

86
00:04:09,776 --> 00:04:11,153
How about you, Aries?

87
00:04:20,036 --> 00:04:21,496
I'll have the mozzarella sticks.

88
00:04:21,663 --> 00:04:22,873
Add more chili to it.

89
00:04:23,123 --> 00:04:25,542
And tell the chef to cook it properly.

90
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:28,628
I want it soft on the inside.
And crunchy on the outside.

91
00:04:28,712 --> 00:04:30,005
And make sure it's not dry.

92
00:04:30,172 --> 00:04:30,672
Okay?

93
00:04:30,881 --> 00:04:31,881
Uhm.

94
00:04:31,923 --> 00:04:35,343
I'll have sparkling water.
With a lime wedge on the side.

95
00:04:35,761 --> 00:04:36,803
Do you guys have that?

96
00:04:37,763 --> 00:04:38,388
Mm-hmm.

97
00:04:38,555 --> 00:04:40,315
Are you sure that's all
you're having, babe?

98
00:04:40,724 --> 00:04:43,018
I’ll just order again if I want to.

99
00:04:43,894 --> 00:04:44,894
That's it for now.

100
00:04:47,397 --> 00:04:49,524
Wait. Did you get everything?

101
00:04:49,941 --> 00:04:50,941
Yeah.

102
00:04:51,443 --> 00:04:52,569
I wrote it down.

103
00:04:52,652 --> 00:04:53,779
Repeat it.

104
00:04:56,615 --> 00:04:57,615
Alright.

105
00:04:58,825 --> 00:05:01,786
Two orders of Ultimate Pizza,
one bottomless iced tea.

106
00:05:01,787 --> 00:05:04,205
One order of Goddess Salad,
no alfalfa sprouts.

107
00:05:04,206 --> 00:05:07,209
With six cherry tomatoes
and dressing on the side.

108
00:05:07,417 --> 00:05:09,752
One order of mozzarella
sticks, with extra chili.

109
00:05:09,753 --> 00:05:10,545
Cook it properly.

110
00:05:10,546 --> 00:05:13,089
Soft but still crunchy. Not dry.

111
00:05:13,423 --> 00:05:15,217
And one sparkling water with a lime.

112
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,009
Is that it?

113
00:05:16,134 --> 00:05:18,010
Okay, thank you. I'll be
getting the menu then.

114
00:05:18,011 --> 00:05:19,429
No, leave it.

115
00:05:19,763 --> 00:05:23,517
My girlfriend said she'll order later.

116
00:05:25,227 --> 00:05:28,104
Then I'll leave one on your table. Okay?

117
00:05:29,689 --> 00:05:30,689
Alright.

118
00:05:31,566 --> 00:05:32,943
Come on. Let's go.

119
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,364
[phone vibrates]

120
00:05:40,075 --> 00:05:41,743
Hey. Is that Ram again?

121
00:05:42,452 --> 00:05:43,829
Just ignore his threats.

122
00:05:47,165 --> 00:05:48,749
Keifer, give this to the kitchen.

123
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,043
I'll handle everything here. Go.

124
00:05:51,086 --> 00:05:52,086
Go on.

125
00:05:57,884 --> 00:06:01,096
[indistinct chattering]

126
00:06:01,972 --> 00:06:03,347
Keif, what's up?

127
00:06:03,348 --> 00:06:04,348
What did Aries say?

128
00:06:04,391 --> 00:06:05,391
As usual.

129
00:06:05,767 --> 00:06:06,893
They're here to insult us.

130
00:06:07,394 --> 00:06:09,521
But Keif... you've noticed it too, right?

131
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,230
What?

132
00:06:11,648 --> 00:06:14,276
That Jay-jay and Aries
aren't on good terms.

133
00:06:16,403 --> 00:06:18,737
I was just thinking,
if you want to get back at Aries,

134
00:06:18,738 --> 00:06:20,218
then why are you still using Jay-jay?

135
00:06:22,367 --> 00:06:23,785
They're not even okay.

136
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,459
Jay, can I talk to you?

137
00:07:55,585 --> 00:07:57,629
Can we do it here? I have work to do.

138
00:07:58,797 --> 00:08:00,340
I... Okay. Umm...

139
00:08:01,758 --> 00:08:02,842
Uhh, Jay.

140
00:08:03,969 --> 00:08:05,303
I wanna court you.

141
00:08:07,973 --> 00:08:09,390
I haven't told Aries yet,

142
00:08:09,391 --> 00:08:12,143
just 'cause I wanna hear your answer first.

143
00:08:12,268 --> 00:08:13,311
Uhm...

144
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:19,901
Kiko, you know...

145
00:08:20,235 --> 00:08:21,736
Everything alright here, Jay?

146
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,240
Yeah.

147
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,784
We were just talking.

148
00:08:29,119 --> 00:08:30,578
- Leave now.
- Uh, David...

149
00:08:30,829 --> 00:08:32,330
Maybe you're needed inside?

150
00:08:32,998 --> 00:08:33,998
You too, Jay.

151
00:08:34,165 --> 00:08:35,325
You're needed in the kitchen.

152
00:08:35,917 --> 00:08:36,917
Then let's go.

153
00:08:39,045 --> 00:08:40,045
Come on.

154
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:45,050
Jay.

155
00:08:45,802 --> 00:08:47,220
I'll wait for your answer.

156
00:08:48,013 --> 00:08:49,013
Sure.

157
00:08:51,474 --> 00:08:53,351
Oh... interesting.

158
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,060
Bro,

159
00:08:55,228 --> 00:08:56,229
What was that?

160
00:08:56,646 --> 00:08:57,981
Nothing. Don't worry about it.

161
00:09:06,031 --> 00:09:07,031
What happened to you?

162
00:09:13,705 --> 00:09:15,415
Why would Kiko suddenly court you?!

163
00:09:16,249 --> 00:09:17,375
How the hell would I know?

164
00:09:18,293 --> 00:09:19,461
And you're letting him?

165
00:09:22,672 --> 00:09:23,672
No.

166
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,175
Do you like Kiko?

167
00:09:26,593 --> 00:09:27,260
The thing is...

168
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,260
You like him.

169
00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:31,723
No.

170
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:33,810
And I don't plan on
letting him court me either.

171
00:09:41,441 --> 00:09:44,611
We need to make sure
that his plan doesn't succeed.

172
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,531
Now, let's get back to work.

173
00:09:50,575 --> 00:09:51,575
Come on.

174
00:09:53,953 --> 00:09:54,953
Keif.

175
00:09:55,663 --> 00:09:58,208
You don't want Kiko's
plan to succeed because...

176
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,794
he's a hindrance to your plan or...

177
00:10:01,544 --> 00:10:03,064
because you're concerned with Jay-jay?

178
00:10:05,131 --> 00:10:06,674
What even is that question?

179
00:10:18,895 --> 00:10:19,895
[Ci-N exhales]

180
00:10:20,772 --> 00:10:22,440
This is so damn tiring.

181
00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:24,150
I have a question.

182
00:10:24,442 --> 00:10:25,442
Hmm?

183
00:10:25,819 --> 00:10:27,654
What happened between David and Kiko?

184
00:10:28,905 --> 00:10:30,299
Oh, are you talking about their fight?

185
00:10:30,323 --> 00:10:31,323
Yeah.

186
00:10:31,866 --> 00:10:32,866
Okay.

187
00:10:32,909 --> 00:10:34,369
From what I know...

188
00:10:34,953 --> 00:10:36,662
Section A complained about Kit and Eren.

189
00:10:36,663 --> 00:10:38,498
- And then?
- And then, they talked to David.

190
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,251
I don't know the details
of their discussion.

191
00:10:42,252 --> 00:10:45,505
But we just heard that
they had a fight at the old factory.

192
00:10:46,047 --> 00:10:48,675
When we got there,
David's face was already bleeding.

193
00:10:48,758 --> 00:10:49,175
Oh?

194
00:10:49,176 --> 00:10:50,635
And Kiko was holding a pipe.

195
00:10:52,428 --> 00:10:54,347
Kiko used a pipe on David?

196
00:10:55,014 --> 00:10:56,224
Kiko really did that?

197
00:10:56,516 --> 00:10:57,516
Yeah.

198
00:10:57,851 --> 00:10:59,651
There's a lot you don't
know about Kiko, Jay.

199
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:02,355
But what did you guys do?
Did you help David?

200
00:11:03,648 --> 00:11:05,692
David was the original president before.

201
00:11:05,859 --> 00:11:07,193
- Yeah.
- His rule was...

202
00:11:07,485 --> 00:11:09,612
we should stay away
from trouble as much as we can.

203
00:11:09,988 --> 00:11:13,241
Some of our classmates didn't like that.
They called David a coward. Weak.

204
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:15,827
So, when Keifer became president,
they were happy.

205
00:11:16,035 --> 00:11:18,316
Because Keifer won't let us
get pushed around that easily.

206
00:11:18,705 --> 00:11:19,914
He fights for us.

207
00:11:20,832 --> 00:11:21,832
Honestly...

208
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,294
Keifer looks like the type
to use his fists to get his way.

209
00:11:25,295 --> 00:11:26,921
Especially for his friends.

210
00:11:27,589 --> 00:11:28,590
You said it.

211
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,551
But Kiko? A troublemaker?

212
00:11:33,344 --> 00:11:35,889
You were smitten by his American
accent and sweet smiles.

213
00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:37,139
That's not true.

214
00:11:37,182 --> 00:11:38,367
You don't like English-speaking guys?

215
00:11:38,391 --> 00:11:39,142
No.

216
00:11:39,184 --> 00:11:40,184
How about Keifer?

217
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:41,769
[Ci-N teasing Jay-jay]

218
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:44,272
Will you stop that?!
I'm gonna steal your sandwich.

219
00:11:45,565 --> 00:11:46,565
Keifer.

220
00:11:46,608 --> 00:11:47,608
Keifer.

221
00:11:48,109 --> 00:11:49,152
[Ci-N laughing]

222
00:11:57,243 --> 00:11:59,287
[Jay-jay yawning]

223
00:12:00,163 --> 00:12:01,206
Thank you.

224
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,044
Those Section A's are such a bother.

225
00:12:06,544 --> 00:12:07,544
You're alright?

226
00:12:08,838 --> 00:12:10,340
Thank you for taking me home, Yuri.

227
00:12:10,673 --> 00:12:11,382
No problem.

228
00:12:11,383 --> 00:12:13,092
You can barely walk earlier..

229
00:12:14,761 --> 00:12:16,137
Yeah. Thanks again.

230
00:12:16,346 --> 00:12:17,388
Good night...

231
00:12:19,515 --> 00:12:21,226
Oh, it's morning now. It's 2 AM.

232
00:12:22,101 --> 00:12:23,102
Good morning, too.

233
00:12:23,811 --> 00:12:26,022
Just don't forget about the meeting later.

234
00:12:26,231 --> 00:12:27,565
Eman's gonna announce something.

235
00:12:28,191 --> 00:12:29,191
Okay.

236
00:12:29,192 --> 00:12:30,485
- Okay.
- Take care.

237
00:12:30,693 --> 00:12:32,195
Thanks again.

238
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,239
- Good night.
- Good night.

239
00:12:38,368 --> 00:12:39,744
[Jay-jay yawning]

240
00:12:43,623 --> 00:12:44,916
Bye!

241
00:12:52,173 --> 00:12:53,173
[Jay-jay screams]

242
00:12:53,883 --> 00:12:54,883
Hey, Jay.

243
00:12:54,968 --> 00:12:55,968
Kiko?!

244
00:12:56,386 --> 00:12:57,011
Sorry.

245
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,300
I didn't mean to scare you.

246
00:12:58,513 --> 00:13:00,515
I thought you were a ghost.

247
00:13:00,765 --> 00:13:02,767
- [Kiko chuckles]
- What are you doing here?

248
00:13:03,017 --> 00:13:04,737
I just want to make sure you got home safe.

249
00:13:05,228 --> 00:13:07,063
And can't text you 'cause...

250
00:13:07,689 --> 00:13:09,107
Aries won't give me your number.

251
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,568
Aries is just being paranoid.

252
00:13:15,321 --> 00:13:16,239
Jay...

253
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,282
Do you...

254
00:13:17,657 --> 00:13:19,701
Do you have an answer
to my question earlier?

255
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,660
Can I court you?

256
00:13:22,954 --> 00:13:24,247
Oh...

257
00:13:24,872 --> 00:13:26,541
I haven't really thought about it yet.

258
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:28,208
It's okay.

259
00:13:28,418 --> 00:13:29,418
I'll wait.

260
00:13:31,838 --> 00:13:33,198
What are you gonna wait for, Kiko?

261
00:13:39,512 --> 00:13:40,888
Cat got your tongue?

262
00:13:44,642 --> 00:13:45,310
Dude.

263
00:13:45,643 --> 00:13:48,146
Since you're already here.
Let's get it straight.

264
00:13:48,438 --> 00:13:49,814
Do you really like Jay-jay?

265
00:13:52,066 --> 00:13:53,943
Aries, I'm actually planning to court Jay.

266
00:13:56,112 --> 00:13:57,112
Not gonna happen.

267
00:13:57,238 --> 00:13:57,905
Why not?

268
00:13:58,072 --> 00:13:59,432
What's wrong with me courting Jay?

269
00:13:59,574 --> 00:14:01,868
Jay-jay is not allowed to have a boyfriend.

270
00:14:02,243 --> 00:14:03,202
End of story.

271
00:14:03,203 --> 00:14:04,495
So you can leave now.

272
00:14:04,996 --> 00:14:06,372
You can't decide for her.

273
00:14:06,748 --> 00:14:07,790
Yes, I can.

274
00:14:07,957 --> 00:14:09,917
Do you know what time it is? Go home, Kiko!

275
00:14:10,335 --> 00:14:12,085
Dude... what is wrong with you?

276
00:14:12,086 --> 00:14:12,837
You know me.

277
00:14:12,838 --> 00:14:13,838
Exactly.

278
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,380
I know you.

279
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,840
Now leave.

280
00:14:20,219 --> 00:14:21,220
Whatever, dude.

281
00:14:49,957 --> 00:14:51,517
You're really gonna let him court you?!

282
00:14:51,793 --> 00:14:52,460
Of course not.

283
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,086
Good.

284
00:14:53,336 --> 00:14:54,462
Have a little shame.

285
00:14:55,088 --> 00:14:58,591
Don't forget your ex is still at the
hospital. And you got the nerve to flirt?

286
00:15:01,344 --> 00:15:02,428
Go inside.

287
00:15:25,118 --> 00:15:26,118
Thank goodness,

288
00:15:26,411 --> 00:15:29,414
Kiko's not here.
I was expecting to get startled again.

289
00:15:30,248 --> 00:15:31,416
- Hey!
- Oh my, Kiko!

290
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,459
And who's gonna be here again?

291
00:15:33,918 --> 00:15:34,918
Kiko's there?

292
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:38,839
Why are you here?

293
00:15:39,715 --> 00:15:40,883
I asked first.

294
00:15:41,384 --> 00:15:43,224
You can definitely see,
right? Kiko's not here.

295
00:15:43,511 --> 00:15:45,137
Did you know that I've
been here for a while?

296
00:15:45,138 --> 00:15:46,138
Huh?

297
00:15:48,224 --> 00:15:49,976
Oh. I overslept. Sorry.

298
00:15:51,018 --> 00:15:52,018
Get in the car.

299
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,524
I never told you to come
and wait for me anyways.

300
00:15:56,983 --> 00:15:58,317
Why are you getting pissed?

301
00:16:03,948 --> 00:16:04,948
Also...

302
00:16:04,991 --> 00:16:06,617
why would you fetch me?

303
00:16:16,711 --> 00:16:17,962
You want some?

304
00:16:20,131 --> 00:16:21,215
I think you do.

305
00:17:05,051 --> 00:17:06,427
How shameless!

306
00:17:07,303 --> 00:17:09,555
I didn't even eat breakfast
so that I'll be on time.

307
00:17:09,805 --> 00:17:10,473
And you're late.

308
00:17:10,474 --> 00:17:13,726
And between the two of us,
you're the shameless one.

309
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:15,937
You have a debt to pay. Right?

310
00:17:25,821 --> 00:17:26,821
Jay...

311
00:17:29,075 --> 00:17:30,201
Yesterday, you said...

312
00:17:31,244 --> 00:17:33,704
You won't let Kiko court you.

313
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:35,330
Is it still true?

314
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:37,958
Yeah.

315
00:17:38,834 --> 00:17:40,336
I don't want a boyfriend for now...

316
00:17:40,545 --> 00:17:42,305
Besides, Auntie doesn't
want me to, as well.

317
00:17:47,051 --> 00:17:48,051
Good.

318
00:17:49,428 --> 00:17:50,638
I hate liars.

319
00:17:52,848 --> 00:17:54,016
Don't lie to me.

320
00:17:54,475 --> 00:17:55,475
I mean...

321
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:56,853
to us.

322
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,270

324
00:18:35,892 --> 00:18:38,394
Hey, Mica, Calix.
You're too sweet.

325
00:18:39,687 --> 00:18:40,313
Calix.

326
00:18:40,314 --> 00:18:42,148
- Is Eman's meeting starting now?
- Not yet.

327
00:18:45,026 --> 00:18:46,026
Yuri!

328
00:18:46,444 --> 00:18:47,444
Good afternoon.

329
00:18:47,903 --> 00:18:49,030
Good afternoon.

330
00:18:49,238 --> 00:18:50,197
You came with Keifer?

331
00:18:50,198 --> 00:18:51,449
Oh, yeah.

332
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:54,952
He said you were busy
that's why he fetched me.

333
00:18:57,747 --> 00:18:59,332
Looks like we're complete now.

334
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,625
Let's start the meeting.

335
00:19:02,376 --> 00:19:03,711
I have good news.

336
00:19:03,961 --> 00:19:05,296
He said he has good news?

337
00:19:05,379 --> 00:19:07,465
After two weeks of helping me out,

338
00:19:07,757 --> 00:19:08,965
my Dad has finally recovered.

339
00:19:08,966 --> 00:19:10,759
Which means I can go back to school again.

And...

343
00:19:19,352 --> 00:19:20,728
Mom was able to secure a loan.

344
00:19:20,936 --> 00:19:23,981
Which also means our original crew
can come back and work here.

345

[disappointed groaning]

346
00:19:26,692 --> 00:19:28,194
- Oh man...
- Why?

347
00:19:29,779 --> 00:19:31,529
So we're not gonna work here anymore?

348
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:32,281
Yeah.

349
00:19:32,323 --> 00:19:33,323
That's good news.

350
00:19:33,449 --> 00:19:35,326
I won't see your faces
all the time anymore.

351
00:19:36,035 --> 00:19:37,035
You're too much.

352
00:19:38,204 --> 00:19:39,163
What a bully. Bully!

353
00:19:39,163 --> 00:19:40,039

Don't you want that?

357
00:19:46,546 --> 00:19:48,463
No more sleepless nights for you guys.

358
00:19:48,464 --> 00:19:50,757
Hey, that's nothing for us. Right?

359
00:19:50,758 --> 00:19:54,095
[in unison] Yeah! No problem
when it comes to you!

360
00:19:54,553 --> 00:19:56,262
And lastly...

361
00:19:56,263 --> 00:19:58,224
I want to thank you all.

362
00:19:58,891 --> 00:20:01,059
I don't regret being in Section E.

Eman's gonna cry! Eman's gonna cry!

364
00:20:13,781 --> 00:20:15,031
It's okay to cry, dude.

365
00:20:15,032 --> 00:20:16,826
To show my gratitude...

366
00:20:17,368 --> 00:20:19,035
I'm gonna cook for you.

- He's not done.

00:20:22,873 --> 00:20:24,124
Hey, wait a minute, guys!

Jay... honestly,

373
00:20:35,845 --> 00:20:39,598
I think you initiated all of this just so
you can have someone to cook for you!

374
00:20:39,765 --> 00:20:41,767
That wasn't my intention at first.

But as things progressed... maybe!

Right, right, right.

but she can get pretty rough.

and her face was full of bruises.

if Ella will be kicked out or suspended.

for Mica to end up with Mykel.

- Shut up!

meddler, aren't you?

people from your nosiness!

search for that thing.

I just want to find it. Whatever it is.

517
00:28:28,358 --> 00:28:29,610
I'm just naturally curious.

518
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,986
I don't care if curiousity kills the cat.

519
00:28:31,987 --> 00:28:33,155
I'm not a cat anyway.

520
00:28:38,202 --> 00:28:39,286

But is that true?

Who was that for?

I'll just go to the toilet.

are you okay?

00:29:12,194 --> 00:29:13,528
Why aren't you talking?

531
00:29:18,116 --> 00:29:19,243
Is it because of Keifer?

532
00:29:19,993 --> 00:29:21,703
What?! No.

533
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:26,833
Oh no!

534
00:29:27,251 --> 00:29:28,418
What happened to you?!

535
00:29:28,543 --> 00:29:29,543
What...

536
00:29:29,962 --> 00:29:31,046
Did you get into a fight?

Uy!

00:29:33,674 --> 00:29:34,674
Stay here.

Let's do it later!

00:30:15,924 --> 00:30:17,175
I smell trouble.

554
00:30:21,638 --> 00:30:24,766
[indistinct chattering]

555
00:30:26,184 --> 00:30:28,562
Why do I feel like there's something wrong?

556
00:30:32,691 --> 00:30:35,193
Was it because of that thing in the trash?

557
00:30:37,112 --> 00:30:39,614
Should I talk to him about it?

558
00:30:42,492 --> 00:30:44,911
Oh my, Jay-jay. You're meddling again.

559
00:30:49,916 --> 00:30:51,626
No. It's not just that.

560
00:30:52,044 --> 00:30:55,463
I'm sure it's not the only reason
I'm feeling anxious.

561
00:30:57,132 --> 00:30:57,799
But who?

562
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,069
I think Section D.

563
00:30:59,926 --> 00:31:01,845
These jerks...

564
00:31:04,139 --> 00:31:05,599
I need to know.

565
00:31:06,058 --> 00:31:07,559
I have to do something.

566
00:31:09,603 --> 00:31:11,104
Let's fuck them up.

567
00:31:12,647 --> 00:31:13,315
Jay,

568
00:31:13,315 --> 00:31:14,315
I'll go ahead.

569
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,883
Hey. We're gonna wash the dishes.

570
00:31:16,151 --> 00:31:16,568
Yeah.

571
00:31:16,569 --> 00:31:18,649
- We're assigned for that task, don't forget.
- Yeah.

572
00:31:19,905 --> 00:31:20,906
Let's tell the others.

573
00:31:22,866 --> 00:31:24,618
- Don't forget, okay?
- Yeah, alright.

574
00:31:31,917 --> 00:31:34,961
Then do this if we need backup.

575
00:31:35,712 --> 00:31:37,339
This.

576
00:31:37,756 --> 00:31:38,756
Is that okay?

577
00:31:40,801 --> 00:31:41,801
David.

578
00:31:42,135 --> 00:31:44,299
You didn't eat. Are you okay?

579
00:31:44,388 --> 00:31:45,388
I'm fine.

580
00:31:46,973 --> 00:31:48,100
Did something happen?

581
00:31:48,517 --> 00:31:49,517
It's nothing.

582
00:31:52,854 --> 00:31:54,022
What do you mean nothing?

583
00:31:54,689 --> 00:31:56,774
What did your girflriend say?
Does she know about this?

584
00:31:56,775 --> 00:31:57,776
She doesn't know.

585
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,736
They're in Hong Kong now.

586
00:32:02,322 --> 00:32:03,365
Did you fight with Kiko?

587
00:32:04,408 --> 00:32:06,326
Jay, are you really
letting Kiko court you?!

588
00:32:09,204 --> 00:32:10,204
Huh?

589
00:32:10,247 --> 00:32:11,607
Why are suddenly bringing that up?

590
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:13,125
I already told you.

591
00:32:13,834 --> 00:32:15,434
What does that have to do with anything?

592
00:32:15,502 --> 00:32:17,546
He's bragging it to all his friends.

593
00:32:18,171 --> 00:32:19,714
He said he's courting you.

594
00:32:20,966 --> 00:32:23,650
And that you're gonna be his.

595
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:26,679
What?

596
00:32:29,349 --> 00:32:31,149
I didn't like what's
coming out of his mouth.

597
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,561
So we argued.

598
00:32:34,604 --> 00:32:35,730
Why did he say that?

599
00:32:36,523 --> 00:32:37,899
How am I supposed to know?

600
00:32:41,862 --> 00:32:43,697
And you're gonna do
something because of that?

601
00:32:47,993 --> 00:32:49,119
David, please.

602
00:32:49,703 --> 00:32:51,705
I don't want to be the
cause of any trouble.

603
00:32:54,749 --> 00:32:55,959
Jay, for God's sake.

604
00:32:56,835 --> 00:32:59,045
Don't interfere. Please.

605
00:33:04,384 --> 00:33:05,509
Get her out of here.

606
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,137
- Just don't get involved.
- Jay.

607
00:33:07,304 --> 00:33:08,304
What?!

608
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:10,347
Jay, let's go. We're doing the dishes.
You're taking too long.

609
00:33:10,348 --> 00:33:11,975
Alright. So impatient.

610
00:33:13,226 --> 00:33:16,021
- You're too slow.
- Can't you do it without me? Am I your hands?

611
00:33:16,229 --> 00:33:17,563
You told me we're doing it together.

612
00:33:17,564 --> 00:33:18,106
Yeah.

613
00:33:18,107 --> 00:33:20,399
So why didn't you start washing the plates?
You could've been finished by now.

614
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,235
You told me we're doing it together.

615
00:33:22,611 --> 00:33:23,987
Let's fuck them up.

616
00:33:28,783 --> 00:33:29,409
Ci...

617
00:33:29,576 --> 00:33:30,785
what's happening?

618
00:33:32,037 --> 00:33:33,037
What?

619
00:33:33,121 --> 00:33:34,623
We're doing the dishes.

620
00:33:35,081 --> 00:33:37,083
And what if I break
this plate on your head?

621
00:33:40,378 --> 00:33:41,421
Come on.

622
00:33:42,088 --> 00:33:43,089
I don't know.

623
00:33:44,633 --> 00:33:47,511
I know you.
I know when you're lying.

624
00:33:49,095 --> 00:33:50,135
Just put it this way, Jay.

625
00:33:50,972 --> 00:33:53,141
We're not telling you anything

626
00:33:53,517 --> 00:33:55,060
out of our concern for you.

627
00:33:55,977 --> 00:33:56,977
So, don't push it.

628
00:33:58,146 --> 00:34:00,565
I don't want you to get hurt because of me.

629
00:34:01,608 --> 00:34:02,108
Us?

630
00:34:02,609 --> 00:34:03,777
Get hurt?

631
00:34:04,402 --> 00:34:07,030
That's impossible, Jay.
We're Section E. We're tough.

632
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:10,699
Okay?

633
00:34:15,288 --> 00:34:16,081
But...

634
00:34:16,082 --> 00:34:17,122
I should get back, Jay.

635
00:34:17,123 --> 00:34:19,043
- Hey! We're not yet done!
- You can handle that!

636
00:34:19,751 --> 00:34:20,751
Hmm!

637
00:34:38,937 --> 00:34:40,105
What are you doing here?

638
00:34:40,522 --> 00:34:42,148
I should be asking you that question.

639
00:34:42,941 --> 00:34:43,942
This is the men's room.

640
00:34:46,611 --> 00:34:49,239
Is it my fault the women's
room has faulty plumbing?

641
00:35:01,293 --> 00:35:02,293
What now?

642
00:35:02,711 --> 00:35:03,837
Tell it to me straight.

643
00:35:04,588 --> 00:35:06,381
Are you allowing Kiko to court you?

644
00:35:07,424 --> 00:35:08,424
Are you dumb?

645
00:35:08,592 --> 00:35:09,968
I already told you.

646
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,305
So why can't you simply say no?

647
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,680
No.

648
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,727
Look at me when I'm talking to you!

649
00:35:19,352 --> 00:35:20,854
I said no!

650
00:35:21,021 --> 00:35:22,647
I said it multiple times!

651
00:35:22,856 --> 00:35:23,940
Don't you believe me?

652
00:35:24,065 --> 00:35:26,067
HE'S. NOT. COURTING. ME.

653
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,570
And even if he does,
what is it to you?!

654
00:35:29,487 --> 00:35:31,127
You guys are the ones I should be asking.

655
00:35:31,281 --> 00:35:33,324
What are you planning to do with Kiko?!
You're not answering me!

656
00:35:33,325 --> 00:35:34,701
So you're concerned about Kiko?

657
00:35:35,118 --> 00:35:37,780
That's why you won't quit
asking these questions.

658
00:35:38,163 --> 00:35:39,539
Yes, I'm concerned!

659
00:35:39,748 --> 00:35:40,957
With all of you!

660
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:54,387
What a pain in the ass.

661
00:36:05,065 --> 00:36:06,106
Let's go.

662
00:36:06,107 --> 00:36:07,107
Hey!

663
00:36:07,192 --> 00:36:08,961
So, you're really not
gonna tell me anything?

664
00:36:08,985 --> 00:36:10,737
Not allowed, Jay.

665
00:36:11,237 --> 00:36:12,613
And why not?

666
00:36:12,614 --> 00:36:14,574
Jay, just listen to us, please.

667
00:36:17,744 --> 00:36:18,744
Let's go.

668
00:36:19,454 --> 00:36:22,582
- Why won't you let me come?
- Because you can't be there.

669
00:36:23,708 --> 00:36:25,269
Because you're gonna
fight again, aren't you?

670
00:36:25,293 --> 00:36:26,211
Don't pretend.

671
00:36:26,212 --> 00:36:27,212
Even you, Ci-N?

672
00:36:27,213 --> 00:36:28,380
Don't be so hard-headed.

673
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:30,715
Or else you're gonna get it from me.

674
00:36:39,849 --> 00:36:41,017
Don't get mad.

675
00:36:41,643 --> 00:36:43,060
Others weren't allowed to come.

676
00:36:43,061 --> 00:36:44,061
Even me.

677
00:36:44,396 --> 00:36:46,436
So, that means,
you're really not meant to be there.

678
00:36:47,399 --> 00:36:48,399
Oh!

679
00:36:48,942 --> 00:36:51,444
Oh! Angelo texted me.
He's picking me up now.

680
00:36:51,695 --> 00:36:53,947
I'll go ahead! Bye!

681
00:36:57,784 --> 00:36:59,144
That girl's really something else.

682
00:37:00,286 --> 00:37:02,539
- Let's go to the club later.
- Okay, later.

683
00:37:02,747 --> 00:37:05,834
Hey, what's the tea?
Oh my gosh, that's so funny.

684
00:37:06,084 --> 00:37:07,084
Yeah!

685
00:37:07,711 --> 00:37:10,088
Really, it was so hilarious!

686
00:37:11,047 --> 00:37:11,923
Hey!

687
00:37:11,924 --> 00:37:13,299
This girl again?

688
00:37:17,762 --> 00:37:20,056
You think I'm just gonna let you get away?

689
00:37:20,849 --> 00:37:22,142
Not gonna happen.

690
00:38:24,746 --> 00:38:25,830
Kiko!

691
00:38:26,623 --> 00:38:27,623
Get out!

692
00:38:28,249 --> 00:38:29,875
- Kiko!
- Kiko!

693
00:38:29,876 --> 00:38:31,336
Kiko!

694
00:38:33,421 --> 00:38:34,798
Show yourself!

695
00:38:35,256 --> 00:38:36,674
Kiko!

696
00:38:37,717 --> 00:38:38,717
Kiko!

697
00:38:38,885 --> 00:38:40,220
What a coward.

698
00:38:41,012 --> 00:38:44,474
Confirmed! It's Kiko
they're meeting up with.

699
00:38:45,725 --> 00:38:46,309
Kiko!

700
00:38:46,309 --> 00:38:47,309
Come out!

701
00:38:48,019 --> 00:38:50,271
- Kiko!
- Show yourself, asshole!

702
00:38:51,064 --> 00:38:52,524
Kiko!

703
00:38:53,191 --> 00:38:55,735
[Jay-jay muffled scream]

704
00:38:58,947 --> 00:39:00,240
Maybe I should go back.

705
00:39:00,615 --> 00:39:02,742
Jay-jay might be feeling down.
I'll come find her.

706
00:39:02,909 --> 00:39:04,202
Just let her be.

707
00:39:04,702 --> 00:39:05,954
Text her if you're worried.

708
00:39:06,246 --> 00:39:07,664
Kiko's coming any moment now.

709
00:39:07,997 --> 00:39:09,415
Let's just go to her later.

710
00:39:10,124 --> 00:39:11,584
Yeah, then let's ask for food.

711
00:39:14,128 --> 00:39:15,128
You're back!

712
00:39:16,923 --> 00:39:17,923
Kiko!

713
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:19,592
Ready for Round 2?

714
00:39:20,593 --> 00:39:22,262
Can you handle me this time, David?

715
00:39:22,595 --> 00:39:24,639
Lost track of how many
times I kicked your ass.

716
00:39:25,056 --> 00:39:26,536
But if you think you can handle it...

717
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,600
One-on-one.

718
00:39:29,269 --> 00:39:30,269
Bring it!

719
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,230
This is my fight.

720
00:39:33,606 --> 00:39:34,899
I should face him.

721
00:39:35,567 --> 00:39:37,447
We went with you so
that we can fight together.

722
00:39:37,569 --> 00:39:38,027
Yeah.

723
00:39:38,486 --> 00:39:40,070
He beat you lots of time, didn't he?

724
00:39:40,071 --> 00:39:41,906
Only because I wasn't focused before.

725
00:39:42,448 --> 00:39:43,658
He used a pipe on me.

726
00:39:43,867 --> 00:39:44,867
What about now?

727
00:39:45,368 --> 00:39:46,368
You're focused now?

728
00:39:48,454 --> 00:39:49,454
I am.

729
00:39:53,209 --> 00:39:54,209
Bring it.

730
00:39:58,506 --> 00:40:06,506
[clapping in the distance]

731
00:40:11,686 --> 00:40:12,979
Keifer Watson.

732
00:40:13,438 --> 00:40:14,689
And the gang.

733
00:40:15,273 --> 00:40:16,273
Who the hell are you?

734
00:40:16,524 --> 00:40:18,067
Me?! Huh?!

735
00:40:18,443 --> 00:40:19,777
You don't know who I am?

736
00:40:19,903 --> 00:40:20,570
Keifer.

737
00:40:20,904 --> 00:40:22,739
Why don't you introduce me to your friend?

738
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:24,657
He's a leader from another gang.

739
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:26,451
His name is Ram.

740
00:40:26,659 --> 00:40:28,286
We got into a fight with them before.

741
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:30,747
Wait... is he with you?!

742
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,080
No.

743
00:40:32,999 --> 00:40:33,999
What do you want?

744
00:40:34,375 --> 00:40:35,960
I just want to watch, Keifer.

745
00:40:36,377 --> 00:40:38,087
Actually it's we...

746
00:40:38,588 --> 00:40:40,965
we can be the judge or the referee.

747
00:40:41,215 --> 00:40:42,216
Bullshit!

748
00:40:42,467 --> 00:40:43,593
What do you want from us?

749
00:40:43,885 --> 00:40:45,053
Chill!

750
00:40:45,511 --> 00:40:46,721
I want nothing from you.

751
00:40:47,055 --> 00:40:48,848
We just really want to watch.

752
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:50,599
Oh!

753
00:40:51,017 --> 00:40:51,601
Wait.

754
00:40:51,976 --> 00:40:53,895
I have a surprise for you.

755
00:40:55,855 --> 00:40:56,855
Boys.

756
00:40:57,357 --> 00:41:00,693
[Jay-jay struggling]

757
00:41:04,072 --> 00:41:05,823
Jay-jay!

758
00:41:09,827 --> 00:41:10,995
- You asshole!
- Shh!

759
00:41:16,626 --> 00:41:17,418
Let me go!

760
00:41:17,418 --> 00:41:18,418
Bastard!

761
00:41:20,546 --> 00:41:22,298
What was your name again?

762
00:41:23,341 --> 00:41:24,550
Jay-jay! And so?!

763
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:26,803
Nice to meet you...

764
00:41:27,261 --> 00:41:28,262
Jay-jay.

765
00:41:29,847 --> 00:41:30,556
Come on...

766
00:41:30,807 --> 00:41:32,058
Start the show.

767
00:41:32,225 --> 00:41:33,392
We're gonna watch.

768
00:41:33,393 --> 00:41:34,726
[laughing]

769
00:41:34,727 --> 00:41:36,896
Leave Jay-jay out of this, Ram!
I'm warning you.

770
00:41:37,188 --> 00:41:38,439
What do you want with us?!

771
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,358
- Ouch!
- Hey!!!

772
00:41:40,942 --> 00:41:41,985
I told you.

773
00:41:42,193 --> 00:41:43,486
We just wanna watch.

774
00:41:43,528 --> 00:41:44,112
Ain't that right?

775
00:41:44,529 --> 00:41:48,368
And I saw this little bird.
Snooping over there.

776
00:41:48,741 --> 00:41:49,741
So I grabbed her.

777
00:41:49,867 --> 00:41:51,512
I thought maybe
she wants to watch as well.

778
00:41:51,536 --> 00:41:52,536
Jay...

779
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:53,830
are you okay?

780
00:41:54,372 --> 00:41:56,499
- Let me go!
- You're so hard-headed!

781
00:41:56,624 --> 00:41:57,867
You really followed us here.

782
00:41:57,892 --> 00:41:59,018
So what?!

783
00:41:59,293 --> 00:42:01,295
You wouldn't answer me!
And wouldn't let me come!

784
00:42:01,462 --> 00:42:03,715
I just wanted to talk to David and Kiko!

785
00:42:04,173 --> 00:42:05,883
[gang members laugh]

786
00:42:06,175 --> 00:42:07,427
Shut up!

787
00:42:08,553 --> 00:42:10,596
I like this girl.

788
00:42:11,764 --> 00:42:12,764
Stay still.

789
00:42:13,808 --> 00:42:14,851
You'll do.

790
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:16,810
Come here.

791
00:42:20,189 --> 00:42:21,190
Fuck.

792
00:42:23,026 --> 00:42:24,861
Jay!

793
00:43:12,909 --> 00:43:14,535
Kiko, I'll be straight to the point.

794
00:43:14,744 --> 00:43:16,704
I really don't want to have
a boyfriend right now.

795
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,663
It's not that I don't like you.

796
00:43:18,664 --> 00:43:20,290
I'm just not interested in anyone.

797
00:43:20,291 --> 00:43:21,768
I should.. go.

798
00:43:22,585 --> 00:43:24,503
Because it's just gonna
be the two of us here,

799
00:43:24,504 --> 00:43:25,630
I will set some rules.

800
00:43:25,755 --> 00:43:27,798
You can't leave without
asking for permission.

801
00:43:27,799 --> 00:43:30,384
And you'll inform me about
who you're hanging out with.

802
00:43:30,885 --> 00:43:32,469
Jasper Jean Mariano.

803
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:33,221
That's not mine.

804
00:43:33,221 --> 00:43:34,155
Who's the father?!

805
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:36,682
I'm not pregnant!
It's not mine! Believe me!

806
00:43:36,724 --> 00:43:37,891
Is it Yuri or Keifer?!

807
00:43:37,892 --> 00:43:38,601
We made a baby already?

808
00:43:38,602 --> 00:43:39,684
What did you say?!

809
00:43:39,685 --> 00:43:40,853
Best day ever.

810
00:43:41,229 --> 00:43:42,521
Ahh, Mr. Fernandez.

811
00:43:42,522 --> 00:43:47,360
I have the lab results
for Jasper Jean Mariano.

812
00:43:47,568 --> 00:43:48,568
Tss.

813
00:43:51,322 --> 00:43:52,322
[Jay-jay punches Keifer]

814
00:43:52,615 --> 00:43:53,615
Jay-jay...

815
00:43:54,117 --> 00:43:56,911
[students having fun]

816
00:43:57,787 --> 00:43:59,204
Ouch, Jay. That hurts.

817
00:43:59,205 --> 00:43:59,664
[Jay-jay screaming]

818
00:43:59,956 --> 00:44:01,249
What did you want to say to me?

819
00:44:01,374 --> 00:44:04,126
David, what if you got your
girlfriend pregnant? What will you do?

820
00:44:04,127 --> 00:44:05,211
Close your eyes.

821
00:44:05,294 --> 00:44:06,294
What are you gonna do?

822
00:44:07,505 --> 00:44:08,005
Hey!

823
00:44:08,089 --> 00:44:10,074
Asshole! Don't you have a girlfriend?!

824
00:44:10,099 --> 00:44:11,767
Are you out of your mind?!

825
00:44:12,093 --> 00:44:13,093
Maybe.
