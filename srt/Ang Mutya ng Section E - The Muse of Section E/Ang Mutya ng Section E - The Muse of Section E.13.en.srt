1
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:17,183
When did my room get bigger?

2
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:19,018
What happened last night?

3
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:22,563
We're here to celebrate and welcome Felix!

4
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:24,733
The one who led the
Shark Slayers into victory!

5
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,193
Let's fucking party!

6
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:28,944
You shouldn't be out here alone.
What if I didn't see you?

7
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:29,696
Have a drink first.

8
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,449
Wait, I need to get back
to Felix. Where is he?

9
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:33,825
Get out of here please.

10
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:39,955
We can't find Felix. And
now we can't find Jay-jay too.

11
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:42,751
But I saw Kiko. He's carrying a woman.

12
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,126
That son of a bitch!

13
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:45,396
He's planning something bad with Jay-jay!

14
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,463
Where's Kiko?!

15
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,798
Didn't I tell you to stay
away from my cousin?!

16
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:49,923
We need to talk.

17
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:51,301
- Jay!
- Jay! Jay!

18
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:52,778
Can you just take her with you instead?

19
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:55,638
- Uhm, Miss? Mark Keifer Watson?
- You're siblings?

20
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,400
Speaking of Yoichi.
She said she misses you.

21
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:59,308
She's not my crush!

22
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,809
I think I can see Keiren's future.

23
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,187
Did you hear what happened to Kiko?
He got expelled.

24
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:06,315
And that's why you always
listen to your husband.

25
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,318
Keifer, you're too stiff.

26
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:09,778
You look so happy, don't you?

27
00:01:27,163 --> 00:01:30,458
Sorry I had to drop Keiren off first.

28
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,342
He's already sleepy.

29
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:35,135
It's okay.

30
00:01:35,974 --> 00:01:37,014
Thanks for taking me home.

31
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:40,891
Yeah.

32
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,274
Alright.

33
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:56,323
Good night.

34
00:01:56,535 --> 00:01:57,535
What was that?

35
00:02:00,764 --> 00:02:01,764
Huh?

36
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:03,164
Ah...

37
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:04,791
I thought you said something.

38
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,209
Nothing.

39
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,629
I just wanted to say good night.

40
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,091
Ah.

41
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,596
Good night too.

42
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:32,569
Uh...

43
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:34,570
- The thing is…
- Is there a problem?

44
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,512
That's not the only
question I want to ask him.

45
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:03,308
Honestly, there are so many questions
running in my mind right now.

46
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:05,727
What is this? What are we?

47
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,526
Huh? What's that?

48
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,695
He left before I could even ask anything.

49
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:17,112
This sucks.

50
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:26,748
You came home late again.

51
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,045
You're acting as if you're my father.

52
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,881
If I was your father, I wouldn't get angry.

53
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,410
He doesn't give a damn about you.

54
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,679
Just come inside. Quickly.

55
00:03:43,119 --> 00:03:43,806
Come inside.

56
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,098
Yeah.

57
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,226
Where is my father?

58
00:03:47,807 --> 00:03:48,807
Do you know something?

59
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,062
Any of you?

60
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:54,359
I have so many questions for Aries.
But I can't just blurt them out.

61
00:03:55,445 --> 00:03:56,694
Just go inside the house!

62
00:03:57,222 --> 00:03:58,222
Alright.

63
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,147
Thank you.

64
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:38,861
Sweet dreams.

65
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:44,909
Are you crazy, Jay-jay?

66
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,453
Why are you texting the
King of Assholes this way?

67
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,413
Sweet dreams?

68
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,580
With emoji?

69
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:51,915
Are you for real?

70
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:22,071
How was your vacation?
Did you miss me?

71
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,785
You're joining in too, Yuri?

72
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,123
Do those two like me?

73
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,462
What if they really have feelings for me?

74
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,259
The Ella incident will
happen all over again!

75
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,678
And it will be a mess.

76
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:47,971
Shit!

77
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,183
I'm gorgeous!

78
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,769
So, so gorgeous!

79
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,062
Wait.

80
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,023
Maybe I'm just assuming things.

81
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,692
Maybe it's nothing, right?

82
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:02,987
Yeah, right.

83
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,033
Don't get ahead of
yourself, Jay. It's nothing.

84
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:08,825
Nothing.

85
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:10,869
Nothing.

86
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,624
Eh, nothing?

87
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,180
Oh no. What do I reply?

88
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,850
This is hard. They're so persistent!

89
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,312
You're both so persistent!

90
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,110
Who is this?

91
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,780
This is Percy, let's meet on Monday
after school.

92
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,991
I have something important to tell you.

93
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:55,206
About what?

94
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:08,845
About your brother,
and his real identity.

95
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:46,521
I'm nervous about the
thing Percy wants to say.

96
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:51,572
But I'm more nervous about my grades.
And my deal with that little kid.

97
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:54,199
What are you gonna do if I score a 100?

98
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,910
You'll admit who is your type among us.

99
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,244
Then you'll kiss him.

100
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,204
- Got you, Jay!
- Oh!

101
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:01,289
What's up with you?

102
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:02,415
What have I done to you?

103
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,919
Jay. Do you see that?

104
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:08,005
If you pass, let me borrow some money.

105
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,530
What are you gonna do with the money?

106
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,220
I'll gamb...

107
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,096
I badly need it.

108
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,267
How much?

109
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,519
How much? Umm…

110
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,620
Five thousand. I just need five thousand.

111
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,443
When do you need it?

112
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:31,778
This week, I hope.

113
00:09:35,574 --> 00:09:36,574
I'll give it tomorrow.

114
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:37,659
Really?

115
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:38,995
If I passed.

116
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:42,290
Well! You will. Trust yourself.

117
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,252
How will I see my grades?
They're all standing in the way.

118
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,087
Leave it to me.

119
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,714
Just learn and watch.

120
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,086
It's the other way around!

121
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,133
Watch and learn.

122
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,468
Let's go. You're too grumpy.

123
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,804
Move away, guys. We got
a stinker coming through!

124
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:57,888
Hey!

125
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,097
I'm just kidding!

126
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,142
Come here now, look at your grades.

127
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:06,187
There.

128
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,357
Not bad.

129
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:10,151
And it's not bad to lend money.

130
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:13,654
Tomorrow, okay?

131
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,280
Yeah, right.

132
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:16,531
Thank you, Jay.

133
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,161
Oh, how about Ci-N?

134
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,709
Son of a…

135
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:28,878
Do you believe now?

136
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:30,545
Look!

137
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,465
So, how's that? You lose.

138
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:37,300
You're so good, kid!

139
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,763
See that, Section A?

140
00:10:38,788 --> 00:10:40,039
Did anyone of you score a 100?

141
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,933
You can't win me over with praises, Jay.

142
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,978
You need to kiss your type in Section E.

143
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:47,604
That's our deal, right?

144
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,691
How did you do it? Last
time, you almost failed.

145
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,903
I told you I was accelerated. I'm a genius!

146
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:58,407
You know, sometimes I get bored
that's why I try almost failing my tests.

147
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,532
What do you want, a medal?

148
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,243
Our deal, okay?

149
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,205
I'll watch out for it.

150
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,498
Ci-N!

151
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,505
Jay, you didn't reply.

152
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,384
Here's another one I need to avoid.

153
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:20,304
Ci-N, wait for me!

154
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:25,392
Hey, Rory!

155
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:26,727
What are you doing?

156
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,562
Need to run away from him too.

157
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,190
Hey! Hey! Hey!

158
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:32,565
Where are you going?

159
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,150
I need to go.

160
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,433
Are you avoiding me because of…

161
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,356
Let me through.

162
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,033
I said, let me through!

163
00:11:41,351 --> 00:11:42,493
- Jay!
- Just let me pass!

164
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,305
You need to confess who your
type is among all of us...

165
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:46,329
Be quiet!

166
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:47,456
Come over here.

167
00:11:47,508 --> 00:11:48,623
- Okay.
- Get over there.

168
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,419
Quit it! Let's talk.

169
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,544
Okay!

170
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:55,923
Can't I just whisper it to you?

171
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,434
- I'll whisper it to you.
- A deal's a deal.

172
00:11:58,564 --> 00:11:59,634
Please.

173
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:00,428
Just say it.

174
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,428
Ouch!

175
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:02,595
Hey, Ci-N!

176
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,801
- Are you giving Jay-jay a hard time?
- Ci-N, you jerk!

177
00:12:04,826 --> 00:12:05,743
Jay, is he messing with you?

178
00:12:05,768 --> 00:12:06,768
Hey, I'm not!

179
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:09,645
Jay-jay has something to announce.

180
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:10,187
Wow!

181
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:11,897
What's that? Are you pregnant?

182
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,442
[Section E boys chattering]

183
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:15,401
Come on!

184
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,360
I don't want to!

185
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:17,361

when he's already dead?

330
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,356
He didn't tell me,

331
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:11,899
but…

332
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,738
How did he...

333
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:19,741
die?

334
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,206
You really intend to keep things from me?

335
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:41,388
There was a time when Aries
was always quiet and distant.

336
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,515
Always staring into nothing.

337
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:48,562
One night, Aries, Percy, Keifer and I

338
00:19:49,187 --> 00:19:50,772
took out Angelo's car.

339
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,275
We still couldn't drive back then,

340
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:55,109
but Percy insisted.

341
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,156
It was raining heavily.

342
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:03,327
Percy repeatedly said to not go home yet.

343
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:08,624
But Aries insisted to go back
because Angelo might get angry.

344
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:11,626
And then,

345
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:13,461
we got into an accident.

346
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,314
Keifer and I were thrown out of the car.

347
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:20,469
While Percy and Aries…

348
00:20:21,219 --> 00:20:22,387
fell down a cliff.

349
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:25,682
Aries managed to save himself, but…

350
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,602
left Percy behind.

351
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,689
We didn't see his body.

352
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,117
They say it was probably
swept by the river.

353
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,945
That's why… we thought he's already dead.

354
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:40,988
But now…

355
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:45,118
seems like he's alive.

356
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,999
So… why is he saying he
knows who my brother is?

357
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:57,339
But what doesn't make sense is
why is he reaching out to you?

358
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:58,631
He doesn't even know you.

359
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,007
Why didn't he call Felix?

360
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:02,135
I would have known!

361
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,137
But you guys had to follow me.

362
00:21:04,369 --> 00:21:06,014
Now we're left with more questions.

363
00:21:06,142 --> 00:21:07,664
It's dangerous to meet up with him.

364
00:21:07,957 --> 00:21:08,957
And why is that?

365
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,102
Because maybe…

366
00:21:15,828 --> 00:21:18,080
He's planning to use you
to take revenge on Aries.

367
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:21,655
That's impossible.

368
00:21:23,368 --> 00:21:24,755
Until we're not sure,

369
00:21:25,355 --> 00:21:27,570
you need to tell us the
next time Percy contacts you.

370
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:28,203

559
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:43,967
- What?
- It got tangled…

560
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,718
on your long hair.

561
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:49,472
Wait, I'll just remove
it so I can finally go.

562
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:52,724
Thank you, Jay.

563
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,936
Until next time.

564
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:56,311
Yes!

565
00:31:09,217 --> 00:31:10,217
Jay!

566
00:31:10,812 --> 00:31:11,411
Oh!

567
00:31:11,712 --> 00:31:12,828
You're here.

568
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,079
Well...

569
00:31:14,104 --> 00:31:15,647
if only I had the choice.

570
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:17,817
You wouldn't catch me dead here.

571
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:20,211
Especially now that Kiko got expelled.

572
00:31:20,878 --> 00:31:22,963
Because of some people who just...

573
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:25,383
simply cannot control their urges.

574
00:31:25,521 --> 00:31:26,884
Hey, Freya. That's enough.

575
00:31:27,605 --> 00:31:31,317
Kiko was expelled because of
his own doing, and nobody else.

576
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,349
Let's finish up here.

577
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,727
Mica, assign the other
tasks to Grace, okay?

578
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:38,521
Where is Grace, by the way?

579
00:31:39,897 --> 00:31:41,190
She's in therapy now.

580
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:42,774
Oh.

581
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:44,986
Jay, have you eaten? Join us.

582
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,570
Join us.

583
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:50,532
Oh, no thanks.

584
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:52,242
I'm still full.

585
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:54,036
Thank you.

586
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:55,788
You're welcome.

587
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:56,955
Alright.

588
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:01,127
Ma'am Jay-jay, there's muffins here.

589
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,212
Great timing! Those are my favorite.

590
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:04,672
I thought she was full?

591
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:05,340
Mica.

592
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:06,049
Yes?

593
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:07,341
Do you think this is alright?

594
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:08,468
I made it myself.

595
00:32:08,618 --> 00:32:10,498
You know Ella, you really are
beauty and brains.

596
00:32:10,793 --> 00:32:11,793
Perfect!

597
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:14,765
Stop it!

598
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:15,849
Not really.

599
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:17,352
I'm not all that.

600
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,812
But Ella is really pretty, right?

601
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,482
How can you compete with that?

602
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,794
It's as if she has her own ring light.

603
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,862
No pores on her face. As if she's filtered.

604
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:32,074
And when she laughs,
she's still so beautiful.

605
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:34,535
Unlike me. When I laugh, I look dumb.

606
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:37,598
But when she does it,
it's like the world goes into slow motion.

607
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,207
My God, beauty and brains.

608
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,418
How can you compete with her, Jay?

609
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:47,924
Then the King of Assholes has the nerve
to dedicate a trophy to me.

610
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:50,885
But it's still Ella he wants.

611
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:53,429
You should be ashamed, Jay.

612
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,431
You assume too much.

613
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:58,768
That kiss means nothing to him.

614
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,103
Well, I guess...

615
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:02,814
I lose this one.

616
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:05,483
Ella's still the winner.

617
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:09,737
But isn't that better?

618
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:12,240
You won't have any problem.

619
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:15,034
They're not gonna fight because of you.

620
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,874
You're so stupid, Jay!

621
00:33:25,002 --> 00:33:26,045
I'm so, so stupid.

622
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:31,383
Ma'am Jay-jay,

623
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:33,970
are you crying?

624
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,502
Are the muffins alright?

625
00:33:37,833 --> 00:33:40,017
I'm in tears because of
how tasty they are.

626
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:42,186
It's so delicious.

627
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:44,398
Oh, I was worried.

628
00:33:44,738 --> 00:33:46,031
Please enjoy the food.

629
00:33:46,381 --> 00:33:47,381
I'll go now.

630
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:01,748
Damn!

631
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:04,458
There's gonna be so many
baddies in Hemilton, bro!

632
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:05,376
Even Chinitas?

633
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:06,668
- Yes, bro!
- All the kinds.

634
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:08,309
Did you get permission to go to Hemilton?

635
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:09,588
Not yet.

636
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:10,798
But it seems so fun.

637
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:12,507
I know right.

638
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:16,095
Is this Percy?

639
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,556
You go ahead outside.

640
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,224
I might've left something.

641
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,477
- I'll follow later.
- Are you hiding something?

642
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:23,936
Nothing!

643
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,521
I'll just follow you there.

644
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:26,439
Alright.

645
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:27,439
Be quick.

646
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:30,817
Hello?

647
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:32,445
Uh, Jay.

648
00:34:34,289 --> 00:34:35,289
Who is this?

649
00:34:35,747 --> 00:34:36,747
This is Drew.

650
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:39,035
Hey, Drew!

651
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:39,911
You're absent again.

652
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:40,911
Where the hell are you?

653
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:42,497
Uh, Jay...

654
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:43,789
Sorry.

655
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,291
But I need your help.

656
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,418
Where are you?

657
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:50,379
Sorry, Jay, but…

658
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:53,466
Can I borrow some cash again?

659
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,052
What you lent me wasn't enough.

660
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,514
Tell me where you spent it first.

661
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:02,349
It's an emergency.

662
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:04,685
What emergency?

663
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,146
I'm here at Kingsground.

664
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,231
Kingsground?

665
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:09,397
What's that?

666
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,275
Hey!

667
00:35:12,467 --> 00:35:13,467
Kingsground?

668
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,720
Who are you talking to?

669
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,322
It's Drew.

670
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:18,281
He called saying he's in Kingsground.

671
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:19,408
[in Japanese] That idiot!

672
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:21,202
What's with Kingsground anyway?

673
00:35:21,398 --> 00:35:23,293
It's dangerous there, Jay.
I can handle this on my own.

674
00:35:23,318 --> 00:35:24,318
Dangerous?

675
00:35:25,563 --> 00:35:27,148
It's not safe. I'll just fetch Drew.

676
00:35:27,393 --> 00:35:28,393
I'll go with you.

677
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:30,545
I just told you it's dangerous!

678
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:33,129
All the more reason for me to go with you!

679
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:34,450
What if something happens to you?

680
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:38,885
Alright.

681
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,763
But whatever happens,

682
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:42,640
don't get out of my sight.

683
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:44,308
Yeah, I got it.

684
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:45,768
Let's go save Drew.

685
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,235
Is it here?

686
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:56,278
Let's go.

687
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,238
Wait.

688
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:03,202
Why is this dangerous? This is a cafe.

689
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,329
Hey!

690
00:36:08,165 --> 00:36:09,165
Rio!

691
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:10,208
Yuri boy.

692
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:11,711
Nice of you to visit.

693
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:13,671
Are you broken hearted again?

694
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:17,132
Is Tiger there?

695
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,051
Of course he is.

696
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:20,594
Passcode?

697
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,764
Pen Pineapple Apple Pen.

698
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,099
Wait.

699
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:25,892
Just like old times,

700
00:36:25,893 --> 00:36:27,059
surrender your phones.

701
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:29,437
I don't have a phone.

702
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:33,441
- There's nothing.
- My phone's dead.

703
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,111
Hey there.

704
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:38,154
Hi miss.

705
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:39,487
Alright!

706
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:40,947
Don't be afraid. I got you.

707
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,867
Ahhhhh! It hurts.

708
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:51,709
Ahhhhh! It hurts.

709
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,212
Send him straight to the morgue!

710
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:56,589
So weak!

711
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:57,964
Tiger.

712
00:36:58,633 --> 00:36:59,633
Yuri.

713
00:37:00,217 --> 00:37:02,844
Who is this guy? His outfit's so retro.

714
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:04,555
What?! Who's my opponent there?!

715
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:09,435
- Is he my next fight?!
- Sixty-Nine, just relax.

716
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:12,592
Chill, Sixty-Nine. They're old friends.

717
00:37:12,902 --> 00:37:13,902
Where's Drew?

718
00:37:14,247 --> 00:37:15,608
Boss, I will pay.

719
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:16,816
Drew!

720
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:19,194
Jay!

721
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:20,154
Jay!

722
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,907
What the hell? You're so annoying!

723
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,659
Drew, are you okay?

724
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,744
So you have a female friend.

725
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:29,413
I thought Section E's all-boys.

726
00:37:29,952 --> 00:37:30,952
Don't be afraid.

727
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:32,499
I'm Tiger.

728
00:37:32,551 --> 00:37:34,344
I own this place.

729
00:37:34,949 --> 00:37:35,949
What's your name?

730
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:38,004
Jay-jay.

731
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:39,422
Nice to meet you.

732
00:37:39,553 --> 00:37:42,055
I think I can punch him if the need arises.

733
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,517
Except for that guy.

734
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:51,310
What do you need?

735
00:37:51,856 --> 00:37:53,216
How much is his debt? I'll pay it.

736
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:59,360
"Pay" is my favorite word.

737
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,613
But the thing is, it's not
money I'm owed anymore.

738
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:05,658
You know how it works.
You've hung out here before, haven't you?

739
00:38:05,682 --> 00:38:08,351
- Drew can't do it!
- Who said it's gonna be Drew?

740
00:38:08,866 --> 00:38:10,367
You said you'll pay, right?

741
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:13,541
You fight. Just like
the old times, my friend.

742
00:38:15,659 --> 00:38:18,620
What does he mean you've been here before?

743
00:38:18,981 --> 00:38:20,539
And that you will fight?

744
00:38:22,981 --> 00:38:25,052
I will explain everything later, okay?

745
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:27,512
Let's go.

746
00:38:28,552 --> 00:38:29,552
Take that!

747
00:38:29,577 --> 00:38:30,703
Jay… Yuri…

748
00:38:30,728 --> 00:38:32,374
Move quickly. Come on!

749
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:33,561
Jay…

750
00:38:44,778 --> 00:38:46,322
What is this place?

751
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:54,373
Is this the fight they're talking about?

752
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:02,647
What's up? Does anyone want to bet? Huh?

753
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:03,673
Nothing.

754
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:04,341
What?

755
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,801
There's betting involved?

756
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:09,013
Do you gamble here?

757
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:11,478
You keep on betting,
that's why you have debts.

758
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:12,891
Sorry, Jay.

759
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,436
I shouldn't have called you.

760
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:17,646
You got dragged into this mess.

761
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:20,775
After this, make sure
you get your life straight!

762
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:24,570
- Promise. Cross my heart.
- I'll deal with you later.

763
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:31,285
This fight's horrible!
You're all good for nothing!

764
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:36,040
You know what to do,
Yuri. You're next after this fight.

765
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:39,293
Yuri! Do you really have to do this?

766
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:49,261
Yes, Jay. I need to fight.

767
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:53,933
Keep her safe.

768
00:39:59,396 --> 00:40:00,689
Oh, let's go.

769
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:03,192
This way.

770
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:06,612
Relax.

771
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:10,699
What do you take me for?
Let's eat and chat, shall we?

772
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:11,575
Wow.

773
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:13,114
He acts as if it's nothing.

774
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:14,745
Yeah, let's go.

775
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:16,038
In the VIP area.

776
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:22,627
Alright.

777
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,254
We got it.

778
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:26,923
Ooh. That smells good.

779
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:28,425
For real.

780
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:31,804
That'll surely tickle Jay's
taste buds... and more!

781
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,307
- Let's see, let's see.
- Chill with that.

782
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,685
Can't wait to eat.

783
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:40,646
We'll have one each, okay?

784
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:42,565
It's for Jay-jay though.

785
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,067
- Okay.
- It's for Jay-jay though.

786
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:47,652
Sixty-nine!

787
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:48,945
Move over!

788
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:52,991
Hey, girls.

789
00:40:53,291 --> 00:40:55,794
Wow, you've already forgotten?

790
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:58,622
I'm hungry, Jay. Get one, there's plenty.

791
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:02,000
- How's Yuri doing right now?
- Just eat up.

792
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:04,461
- I hope he makes it.
- Jay-jay, you too.

793
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:09,675
Jay, where did you meet Yuri?

794
00:41:11,659 --> 00:41:13,244
We're both from Section E.

795
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:14,554
Really?

796
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:17,057
I'm from Section E too,
you know! High five!

797
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:24,063
You, how did you meet Yuri?

798
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:26,567
Them? They're a group of four.

799
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:29,195
Percy and Aries were the others.

800
00:41:29,226 --> 00:41:32,062
They're all following my
old classmate, Angelo.

801
00:41:33,093 --> 00:41:34,783
Was it Michael Angelo Fernandez?

802
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,453
Yeah, how do you know him?

803
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:39,245
- He's my cousin.
- Cousin?

804
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:40,122
Yeah.

805
00:41:40,123 --> 00:41:43,917
I see. I remember Keifer.

806
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:44,543
Oh?

807
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:46,545
He's always fighting with Aries.

808
00:41:46,681 --> 00:41:49,851
They were always compared with each other.
That's why they always fight.

809
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:53,541
Yuri is the quiet one. Always observing.

810
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:57,431
Percy is the joker and
would always be laughing.

811
00:42:00,022 --> 00:42:02,398
Then how did Yuri become a regular here?

812
00:42:02,423 --> 00:42:06,415
Yuri and Keifer likes hanging
out at the disco upstairs.

813
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,440
No way.

814
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:09,275
There's a whole other scene upstairs?

815
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:12,988
Yeah. Those two are good at picking fights.

816
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,698
Especially Keifer.

817
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:17,576
- Keifer?
- Yeah, Keifer.

818
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:21,914
I know he had a girlfriend.
That's why he didn't return here anymore.

819
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:23,999
It's Ella again.

820
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:30,338
And then, Yuri went mental.
Always looking for fights outside.

821
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:33,676
Eventually, he declared
that he'll join Kingsground.

822
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:37,805
He didn't wanna give up. One day,
I just saw him in the ring.

823
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:40,724
He became a regular and would always fight.

824
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:44,353
Ella's the reason again.

825
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:50,818
Jay-jay, pizza.

826
00:42:51,683 --> 00:42:52,683
That's delicious.

827
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,906
That's the most delicious
pizza here. Promise.

828
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:57,366
It's already cold.

829
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,285
It's still delicious. Go on.

830
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:01,829
- You're sure?
- Yeah.

831
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:08,710
Oh!

832
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:11,505
Jay-jay, let's dance.

833
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:13,047
Spin!

834
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:16,301
There! Spin! Spin around!

835
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:19,680
- Spin more!
- Awesome, Jay. You're quick to forget.

836
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:22,849
Annoying.

837
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:36,238
It's tempting, it's tempting.
I'm not gonna lie.

838
00:43:36,742 --> 00:43:38,452
Can you guys focus?

839
00:43:38,886 --> 00:43:42,036
- Rory, updates! Updates!
- Oh shit.

840
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:43,828
- Any updates? Come on.
- My bad, my bad.

841
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:47,541
None yet, but..
But anytime now, anytime now wait.

842
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:48,708
Anytime what?

843
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,419
Wait, wait, wait.

844
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,843
Wait up. Keif, why are you sweating?

845
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:05,224
- Yeah, bro. Just chill.
- Updates, Rory! Updates!

846
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:07,269
- Here, here, here.
- Where is she?

847
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:09,314
- Here, here.
- You know what, you know what bro.

848
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,855
I'll help you out.

849
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,192
Just a second.

850
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:16,070
Okay.

851
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:18,280
- Post.
- Wait, I'll try to call someone.

852
00:44:19,569 --> 00:44:22,951
- Updates! What are you guys doing? Come on!
- Okay! Fuck!

853
00:44:23,539 --> 00:44:24,286
Damn!

854
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:25,037
What?

855
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:26,914
- Where is she?
- There's no way.

856
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,499
What do you mean "no way"?

857
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,584
She's at Kingsground!

858
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:32,628
Kingsground?! Fuck!

859
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,963
We gotta go. We gotta go. For real.

860
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:37,174
Oh, shoot!

861
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:53,899
Last time I went here,
I met someone I didn't expect.

862
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:00,989
[bell rings]

863
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:02,366
Keifer.

864
00:45:09,706 --> 00:45:15,295
I'll admit. I released all my anger
during my fights here.

865
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:18,090
My jealousy towards
his relationship with Ella.

866
00:45:22,455 --> 00:45:25,249
I would imagine Keifer as my opponent.

867
00:45:25,274 --> 00:45:26,608
Just like now.

868
00:45:30,064 --> 00:45:33,872
Because the truth is I'm a coward.

869
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,149
Yuri!

870
00:45:41,305 --> 00:45:42,598
I didn't fight.

871
00:45:42,918 --> 00:45:43,918
I gave up.

872
00:45:44,263 --> 00:45:46,140
I chose my best friend.

873
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:49,079
Just like now.

874
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:56,128
Yuri, get up, please!

875
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:02,176
Yuri!

876
00:46:02,177 --> 00:46:03,260
But it's different now.

877
00:46:03,771 --> 00:46:04,772
You're different.

878
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:08,599
I won't give up on you that easily.

879
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:11,977
I will fight for you.

880
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:15,147
Even if I end up fighting Keifer.

881
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:49,681
Fight!

882
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:51,934
[bell rings]

883
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,694
[bell rings]

884
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:31,056
- It's Yuri!
- Congrats.

885
00:47:32,826 --> 00:47:33,826
Jay...

886
00:47:34,422 --> 00:47:36,174
You scared me.

887
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:39,063
Don't cry.

888
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:41,191
Sorry if I made you worry.

889
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:45,362
I told you he's my
winning rooster! He did it!

890
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:46,650
Ouch.

891
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:48,323
This is all your fault.

892
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:52,869
I thought you're gonna lose.

893
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:57,457
That won't happen.
I'm your bet, aren't I?

894
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:00,669
Jay, are you mad at me?

895
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:02,962
Ouch!

896
00:48:03,215 --> 00:48:04,757
Why did you hit me?

897
00:48:04,782 --> 00:48:05,862
He was asking the question!

898
00:48:06,026 --> 00:48:07,317
Blame it on your mother.

899
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:09,636
The next time you
gamble, I'll skin your head!

900
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:12,014
My hair's already thin.

901
00:48:16,556 --> 00:48:18,361
Jay, I know you're mad at me.

902
00:48:24,728 --> 00:48:25,854
I'm sorry, Jay.

903
00:48:26,717 --> 00:48:29,845
I promise I won't ever return there.

904
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:34,494
Hey!

905
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:35,786
Umm...

906
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:37,496
Uhh...

907
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:39,290
Jay-jay.

908
00:48:39,434 --> 00:48:40,434
And the Rooster?

909
00:48:40,961 --> 00:48:41,961
Together?

910
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:43,211
How?

911
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:44,379
That's English.

912
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:47,716
Fine, I'll sit back down.

913
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:54,389
You still have lots to explain to me.

914
00:48:57,431 --> 00:49:00,142
When… Ella didn't choose me,

915
00:49:01,388 --> 00:49:04,066
I went here to release
all my anger and jealousy.

916
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,318
I fought here.

917
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:11,406
The physical pain masked the pain in here.

918
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:17,621
Until one day, Keifer went for me.

919
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:21,083
He fought me. He brought me down.

920
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:23,418
After that,

921
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:26,296
we became okay again.

922
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:28,632
Your scar…

923
00:49:29,593 --> 00:49:30,719
did you get it here?

924
00:49:32,594 --> 00:49:33,594
You know, Jay.

925
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:36,264
My wounds have been healing.

926
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:43,021
My wounds started healing
because I'm not thinking of Ella anymore.

927
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:49,111
Ohh. So there's really something
going on between you.

928
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:52,446
I'll be quiet.

929
00:49:58,704 --> 00:49:59,704
No!

930
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:02,332
- No way!
- Come on, let's go.

931
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:04,583
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

932
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:05,919
You two, stay here.

933
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:07,408
- And be on the look out.
- What?

934
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:08,171
Alright.

935
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,005
Be on the look out!

936
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:10,173
- Yes sir!
- Aye, aye.

937
00:50:11,007 --> 00:50:11,466
Fuck!

938
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:12,300
Rio! Rio!!

939
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:13,760
Keifer, passcode.

940
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:15,220
Pen Pineapple Apple Pen.

941
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:21,852
One more fight.

942
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:24,896
Just one more fight.
And I'll let you off the hook.

943
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:28,108
How about, fight me? Are you game?

944
00:50:28,271 --> 00:50:29,271
Ah!

945
00:50:29,601 --> 00:50:32,353
I know the perfect opponent for you.

946
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:36,032
Jay!

947
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:37,241
Keifer?

948
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:39,452
Welcome back, Keifer!

949
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:40,871
What are you doing?!

950
00:50:40,949 --> 00:50:42,121
- Hey, what are…
- You son of a bitch!

951
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:43,790
You dragged Jay-jay into your mess!

952
00:50:44,249 --> 00:50:47,794
Stop! It's not Drew's fault I'm here.

953
00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:52,007
Reserve your energy, Keifer.
You'll get your fight soon enough.

954
00:50:52,954 --> 00:50:54,330
Tiger, you had your fun.

955
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:55,520
It's time for us to go.

956
00:50:58,013 --> 00:50:59,013
Come here.

957
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,223
Wait.

958
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:02,768
Why are you even here?

959
00:51:03,912 --> 00:51:04,912
Ouch.

960
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:08,523
This place is dangerous! You're the
most impossible person I've ever known!

961
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:09,945
Wow, is it really me?!

962
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,221
Yes!

963
00:51:11,285 --> 00:51:12,453
And what is it to you?!

964
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:19,034
You make me worry.

965
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:28,710
There you go again,

966
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:31,129
playing with my feelings.

967
00:51:33,595 --> 00:51:35,180
You're confusing me too.

968
00:51:40,487 --> 00:51:41,639
Here we go again.

969
00:51:41,809 --> 00:51:43,602
I have so many questions for him.

970
00:51:44,075 --> 00:51:45,076
To myself.

971
00:51:45,808 --> 00:51:48,647
But maybe there are questions
that cannot be answered.

972
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:50,273
Not right now.

973
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:54,486
So for now, just shut up.

974
00:51:56,009 --> 00:51:57,093
Hold my hand.

975
00:51:57,906 --> 00:51:58,989
And get ready to run.

976
00:51:58,990 --> 00:51:59,990
Huh?

977
00:53:48,516 --> 00:53:50,142
Maybe I can ask a favor from you?

978
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:52,354
I want to propose to my girlfriend tonight.

979
00:53:52,379 --> 00:53:53,146
Are you blushing?

980
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:54,396
Fuck you, I'm not!

981
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:55,606
Can you stop cursing?

982
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:57,232
I will curse if I want to!

983
00:53:57,233 --> 00:53:59,319
Fuck you! Damn it! Jerk!

984
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:03,156
If you use profanity, one more time.

985
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:04,115
I will kiss you.

986
00:54:04,116 --> 00:54:05,200
Shit!

987
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:07,220
We need to fix ourselves
up right now or else

988
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:08,971
we won't be able to
get into the university.

989
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:11,915
Your collar's folded up.

990
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:14,000
Help me with this...

991
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:15,251
Fuc...

992
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:21,257
HVIS students, welcome
to Hemilton University.

993
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:23,510
Jay! A Mariano. Are you related?

994
00:54:23,535 --> 00:54:23,994
Dad!

995
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:24,841
Dad!

996
00:54:24,944 --> 00:54:25,945
Let go of Jay-jay!

997
00:54:26,092 --> 00:54:28,409
Aries, you're hurting her. Let her go.

998
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,017
Dad! Dad!

999
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:33,520
- Dad!
- Aries!

1000
00:54:33,939 --> 00:54:35,940
Is that why you didn't
want me to go there?!

1001
00:54:35,965 --> 00:54:38,342
If you want an explanation,
you won't get it from me.

1002
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,817
He's my father!

1003
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:42,028
We have to declare bankruptcy in Guam.

1004
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:43,130
What's gonna happen to us?

1005
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:44,572
I remember the Hanamitchis.

1006
00:54:45,068 --> 00:54:46,569
They offered a business deal before,

1007
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:48,201
but it's complicated.
