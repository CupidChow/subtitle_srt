=Episode 4=
(The Prey and the Hunter?)

2
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:34,460
(Profile of Gu Jiannan)

3
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:37,500
Zhongjue.

4
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,780
Gu Jiannan is well-prepared for this.

5
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:39,620
Be careful.

6
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,300
Have you got the files I need?

7
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,380
Yes.

8
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:48,700
Zhongjue.

9
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:50,660
I'm warning you.

10
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,620
As a newcomer in the company,

11
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,220
you should know your place.

12
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,220
You changed the suppliers
of the sales orders

13
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,580
made last month.

14
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,620
Have you asked for my permission?

15
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:05,900
=Trick in Love=

16
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,700
If anything goes wrong,

17
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,940
can you take the responsibility?

18
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,100
(Adapted from the novel
"Mr. Intrigue's Love Game" by Yun Qi Mo Li)

19
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,980
Those projects of yours last year

20
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,820
made the company suffer from loss.

21
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,180
Who'd take the responsibility for that?

22
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,100
Last April, in Sanya,

23
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,260
you were accompanied
by seven beauties.

24
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,060
The one with the best figure

25
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,580
got the order that is worth 15 million

26
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,860
from our group.

27
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:30,700
Last July, in Lijiang,

28
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,020
this lady got an order of eight million.

29
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,100
She didn't have the qualification
for this project herself.

30
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,500
She borrowed
another company's name to do that.

31
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:38,540
I reckon you must know

32
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,300
whether she was qualified or not.

33
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:41,460
Mr. Gu.

34
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,740
Have you selected them carefully?

35
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:44,900
They are below average.

36
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,500
Ye Zhongjue.

37
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:48,980
Just you wait.

38
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,540
Ms. Bai, what can I do for you?

39
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,900
Ye Zhongjue is trying to win
people's support.

40
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:13,860
Do you know about this?

41
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,340
I-I don't.

42
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,260
Your people are taking his side.

43
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,780
But you know nothing.

44
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:22,820
This...

45
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,340
If you don't take action now,

46
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,980
get ready for the coming attacks.

47
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:51,860
Is there an outage?

48
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:57,700
Maybe it's the circuit breaker.

49
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,140
The street lamps are still on.

50
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,660
I'll call someone to fix it.

51
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,940
Didn't you major in
electric engineering?

52
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,580
Well...

53
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,300
Then I'll fix it by myself.

54
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,180
So I can save some money.

55
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,780
(Where should I fix it?)

56
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,900
The switch is over there.

57
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,620
I know.

58
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,700
It's different
from the one I saw before.

59
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,060
Let me check.

60
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,780
Oh.

61
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,100
The fuse is burnt.

62
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,340
Buy another one like this

63
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,420
at the hardware store.

64
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:44,740
Well,

65
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:45,700
I'll leave the lamp to you.

66
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,780
He's actually rich.

67
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,860
Why does he pretend to be poor?

68
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,940
I hate rich people.

69
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,740
He's not doing this for me, is he?

70
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:31,000
(Electric Engineering For Starters,
From Newbies To Experts)

71
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:37,540
It's done.

72
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,300
It took you so long to fix this fuse.

73
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,740
It's been long since I last changed one.

74
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:43,540
I got a little rusty.

75
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,700
Are you really
an electric engineering student?

76
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,780
If so, why did it take you

77
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,380
half an hour to change a fuse?

78
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,580
What do you do actually?

79
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,620
I am...

80
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,300
You are what?

81
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,740
Speak.

82
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:02,700
Are you dumb?

83
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,220
(Are you dumb?)

84
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,740
Are you kidding me?

85
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:10,860
Huh?

86
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,060
You got me a mute.

87
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,740
I came all the way here.

88
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,140
Seriously?

89
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:16,980
That's not it.

90
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,460
This kid is not mute.

91
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,940
He just got scalded
by hot water several days ago,

92
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,540
so he couldn't speak for now.

93
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,780
You can take him back and raise him
for a few months.

94
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,660
He'll be able to speak by then.

95
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,980
Do you take me as a fool?

96
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:26,540
Huh?

97
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,260
No, I don't.

98
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,820
How about I give you a discount?

99
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:31,740
Rascal.

100
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,820
Keep him to yourself.

101
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:33,780
Hey.

102
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,340
Useless wreck.

103
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,780
You won't speak, right?

104
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,340
If you don't speak,

105
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,260
I will never

106
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,660
give you any food.

107
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,380
Speak.

108
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,860
Speak.

109
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,140
What's wrong with you?

110
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,100
Are you alright?

111
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:58,420
You...

112
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,460
You...

113
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,580
Are you okay?

114
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:05,460
Let me wipe it.

115
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,020
Leave it.

116
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,420
Stomachache.

117
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,260
It happens all the time.

118
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,700
I'll fetch some water for you.

119
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,540
I'll go out and buy some medicine.

120
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:31,940
Dinner's ready.

121
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,260
Don't forget to eat it.

122
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,220
(Mo Suqing.)

123
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,620
(You are actually charming.)

124
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:40,980
(A real hunter)

125
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,740
(always appears
in the disguise of a prey.)

126
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,300
(This makes the game interesting,)

127
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:47,900
(doesn't it?)
