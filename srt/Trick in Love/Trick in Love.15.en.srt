2
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,020
Mo Suqing.

3
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,300
I hope you don't have ulterior motives.

4
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,580
What can I do for you?

5
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,580
Check the quantity of this batch.

6
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:52,900
If all is okay, do the stock-in.

7
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,940
Isn't that the job
of the warehouse personnel?

8
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:58,500
You just joined us.

9
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,540
You need to familiarize yourself
with the procedures.

10
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:03,740
Okay, I got it.

11
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,070
=Trick in Love=

12
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:13,100
(Adapted from the novel
"Mr. Intrigue's Love Game" by Yun Qi Mo Li)

13
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,500
(Manufacturer: Mo Shi Rong Yu,
Supplier: Mo Zhenfeng)

14
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:21,660
Stock-in check?

15
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:22,900
Isn't the warehouse personnel

16
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:23,460
in charge of it?

17
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:24,660
Yes.

18
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,500
Someone was assigned to that task.

19
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,380
But somehow I had to do it today.

20
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,460
It happened to be my family's factory.

21
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,580
Did she do it on purpose to test me

22
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,140
if I would be biased
towards Mo Zhenfeng

23
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,100
and help him gain profits.

24
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,300
I don't think Jian Jie
would resort to this trick.

25
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:41,980
What do you mean?

26
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:43,620
Who are you accusing?

27
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:44,780
No.

28
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:45,940
What I meant is

29
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,900
it might be a misunderstanding.

30
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,020
A misunderstanding?

31
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:52,780
Ye Zhongjue.

32
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,020
Your wife was in the warehouse today,

33
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,460
counting Health Pots all afternoon.

34
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,500
Now you tell me it was

35
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,820
a misunderstanding like it was nothing?

36
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,140
It's normally a job

37
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,780
for five people separated
in different areas.

38
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,460
But me?

39
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,220
I counted them five times by myself.

40
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,140
Over and over again.

41
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,140
I was afraid to get it wrong

42
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,420
so Jian Jie could find fault with me.

43
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,180
Do you know how many

44
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,380
mosquitoes your Jueshi Group has?

45
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,980
Look how much they bit me!

46
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,300
And here you are being sarcastic.

47
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,020
All right.

48
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,140
I'm sorry.

49
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,620
You worked very hard today.

50
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:17,340
How about this?

51
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,060
I'll give you half a day off tomorrow.

52
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,340
You can rest at home.

53
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,220
Do I get paid?

54
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,340
In theory, that would be impossible,

55
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,260
but I will

56
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,220
pay you triple.

57
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,060
Alright.

58
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,100
Anyway, I counted correctly.

59
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,660
She won't find any fault with me.

60
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,450
(Wang Chen)

61
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,060
Hello?

62
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,100
Something happened here.

63
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:47,540
Mr. Ye.

64
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,300
If I remember correctly,

65
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,700
your wife

66
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,340
is Mo Zhenfeng's eldest daughter.

67
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,060
Repeated inspection of the goods

68
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,140
from his factory revealed issues.

69
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,540
The person who checked in the goods
was Mo Suqing.

70
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,580
Don't you

71
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,340
owe us an explanation?

72
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:15,700
Sir.

73
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,020
Hello.

74
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,100
Sir.

75
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,580
I think Jueshi Group sells

76
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,060
these Health Pots in their shop

77
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:23,900
for 499 yuan.

78
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,340
Why is it so cheap here?

79
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,420
I have my connections.

80
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,620
Don't worry, miss.

81
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,460
Our product

82
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,300
isn't much different
from Jueshi Group's product.

83
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,260
They all use the same
patented technology.

84
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,580
And they're manufactured
by the same factory.

85
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,340
(You use other people's patents
to make money for yourself.)

86
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,860
(Mo Zhenfeng.)

87
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,060
(There's nothing you wouldn't do.)

88
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,740
(I finally caught you two.)

89
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,700
Shouldn't Ms. Bai,
who is being all mysterious,

90
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,780
come forward with an explanation

91
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,780
after her husband caused
such a big issue?

92
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:00,660
I'm sorry, everyone.

93
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,140
I'm late.

94
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,980
As for this matter,

95
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,220
I'd like to ask Miss Mo
a question first.

96
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,740
As the CEO's secretary,

97
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,580
why did you suddenly take over

98
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,580
the warehouse personnel's job?

99
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,140
And why did you happen to do it

100
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,380
on the day
the surveillance cameras malfunctioned?

101
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,660
Ms. Bai, are you saying

102
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,500
that I'm framing you?

103
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:32,660
But I was only

104
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,500
checking the quantity of goods
in the afternoon.

105
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,300
How could I frame anyone?

106
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:37,780
Besides,

107
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,700
why was I in charge of the check-in?

108
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,700
You may need to ask Ms. Jian about that.

109
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,740
I did ask her to do it.

110
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:48,980
Ms. Bai.

111
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,980
How about you tell us about

112
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,940
the mess your husband
Mo Zhenfeng caused first?

113
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,220
I'm sorry.

114
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,140
(Divorce Certificate)
Mo Zhenfeng

115
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,420
and I have already got divorced.

116
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,860
So I can't really give any opinion

117
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,020
on my ex-husband right now.

118
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,260
I respect the company's decision.

119
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,380
Oh, right.

120
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,500
This is

121
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,940
the notarial certificate Mo Zhenfeng
signed with me

122
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,820
(Notarial Certificate)
when establishing the factory.

123
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,300
To avoid arousing suspicions,

124
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:26,540
as long as

125
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,020
I, Bai Yue,

126
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,100
am still working

127
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,340
at Jueshi Group,

128
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,660
I must split all the assets

129
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,140
owned by Mo Zhenfeng and me.

130
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:38,980
So,

131
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,060
why would I

132
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,900
take risks for a company

133
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,300
that's completely unrelated to me?

134
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,540
I wouldn't be that stupid.

135
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,420
Don't you think so?

136
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,020
Mo Suqing.

137
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,580
I really underestimated you.

138
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,180
You flattered me.

139
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,220
I'm not as calculating as you,
Ms. Jian.

140
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,300
But in this fight with Bai Yue,

141
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,700
none of us has won.

142
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,500
Don't think I don't know
you took advantage of my power.

143
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:12,820
You used me to go against Bai Yue.

144
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,140
You're not as innocent as you appear.

145
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,020
Yes?

146
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,620
Ms. Jian, listen,

147
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,380
I already got the surveillance footage

148
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,260
from the bar.

149
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:34,500
I thought

150
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,180
that driving a wedge
between the three of them

151
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,940
would make Jian Jie

152
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,620
kick Mo Suqing out of Jueshi.

153
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,020
But that idiot Jian Jie

154
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,260
actually handed that brat something
that she could use against me.

155
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,660
Calm down first.

156
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,460
Fortunately, our shareholders

157
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,380
haven't been affected yet.

158
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,300
I'll take care of the factory.

159
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,060
Find a way to divert

160
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:57,700
a part of those

161
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,220
counterfeit goods from the factory.

162
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,060
Put them in a safe place.

163
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,860
But you'd be digging a hole
for yourself.

164
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,660
Just do it.

165
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,300
I have my plans for them later.

166
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:07,780
Be quick.

167
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,580
Don't make any more mistakes.

168
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,500
What about Mo Zhenfeng?

169
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,220
He

170
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,500
has nothing to do with us.

171
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,340
I'm sorry you had to go through that

172
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:32,940
today.

173
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,980
From now on, I will stand
in front of you

174
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,700
no matter what happens.

175
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:50,820
Mo Suqing.

176
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,820
You tried so hard to get close
to Ye Zhongjue,

177
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,500
and you went so far as to fool him
with marriage.

178
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,900
What exactly are you up to?

179
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,700
I don't understand what you mean.

180
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,340
Drop your act, will you?

181
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,380
Was it a coincidence that you met him?

182
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,500
Or was it a plot you carefully designed?

183
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,380
You know the truth!

184
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,300
This is the video from the bar that day.

185
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,100
Do you want to see it?
