=Episode 19=
(Let's Fight Side by Side This Time)

2
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,300
Mo Zhenfeng has run away.

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,060
I asked him about the factory for you.

4
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:15,580
He said he didn't know

5
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:16,980
why there was a surplus of goods.

6
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:19,540
I guessed it.

7
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,980
Bai Yue and Gu Jiannan
wouldn't let him know.

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,140
It's hard for you to investigate

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,260
with no clues left.

10
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,300
Who sent you the message?

11
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,100
You're so nervous.

12
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:40,980
What?

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,180
Well.

14
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,100
Just a spam message.

15
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:45,260
Let me have a look.

16
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,660
(Gu Jiannan)
Are you free to talk?

17
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,860
Am I right?

18
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:51,980
I received

19
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,100
a spam message.

20
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,540
No.

21
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,100
My husband doesn't let me.

22
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,500
Send it.

23
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,780
=Trick in Love=

24
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:24,220
Hi.

25
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:28,380
(Adapted from the novel
"Mr. Intrigue's Love Game" by Yun Qi Mo Li)

26
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,260
What's wrong?

27
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,260
My husband's not happy
about me seeing you.

28
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:33,580
Spit it out.

29
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:34,940
When did you

30
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,340
get so mushy?

31
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:37,980
What's it got to do with you?

32
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,180
I'm leaving.

33
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:39,940
Wait.

34
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,860
I will sell my shares.

35
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:49,420
Huh.

36
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,780
What trap are you setting for me again?

37
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,300
With your net worth,

38
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,620
is it still necessary to sell shares?

39
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:56,900
I'm serious.

40
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,340
I was set up

41
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,380
to owe money.

42
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:01,980
Yo.

43
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,220
By whom?

44
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,020
Who did justice for God?

45
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,060
Don't gloat about it.

46
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,180
I'm telling you,

47
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,740
Ye Zhongjue doesn't want

48
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:11,860
my shares,

49
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,020
but plenty of others do.

50
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,580
Even if you really want to sell them,

51
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,140
why don't you just sell them to Bai Yue?

52
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,420
Aren't you on the same team?

53
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,620
My mom doesn't agree.

54
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,420
After all, she is the daughter
of the Ye family.

55
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,980
How come she always
thinks of Ye Zhongjue?

56
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,580
That's really touching.

57
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,180
Can you just stop being sarcastic?

58
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,420
Buy them or not?

59
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,460
Be straightforward.

60
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,980
So what Gu Jiannan said is true?

61
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:48,620
Yes.

62
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:49,780
I looked into it.

63
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,820
He got conned at a casino.

64
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,100
Now he's in debt for tens of millions,

65
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,180
and creditors are after him.

66
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,140
Tens of millions.

67
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,740
He's got a lot of guts.

68
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,180
What were you even thinking before?

69
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,580
Being into a man like that?

70
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,740
I wasn't.

71
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,180
It was Mo Zhenfeng who liked him.

72
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,380
You don't have to be so jealous.

73
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,540
So what should we do?

74
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,420
There's no reason to refuse

75
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,460
shares offered to us.

76
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,540
At this shareholders' meeting,

77
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,900
although it pains me greatly,

78
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,900
I have to disclose the largest scandal

79
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,700
in the Jueshi Group's history.

80
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,460
Some time ago,

81
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,700
the company faced a major issue

82
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,300
with excess unsold Health Pots.

83
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,700
After careful consideration,

84
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,460
Mr. Ye planned out
a trade-in promotion event.

85
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,380
Although it involved

86
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,260
much trouble,

87
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,820
all the problems

88
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,540
were solved smoothly by Mr. Ye.

89
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,020
It's known to all of us.

90
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,140
I was glad at first.

91
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,580
After all, the company had a successor.

92
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,060
However...

93
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,100
However, what I never expected was that

94
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,020
behind this trade-in event,

95
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,940
it was nothing
but a complete conspiracy.

96
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,540
Using power for personal gain.

97
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,220
How despicable!

98
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,980
Not only did it harm
our company's interests,

99
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,580
but it also let down

100
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:29,180
our commitment and investment.

101
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,460
Ye Zhongjue,

102
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,140
even now,

103
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,660
you don't admit what you have done?

104
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,540
Ms. Bai, why don't you tell us

105
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,500
what I have done?

106
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:47,460
Okay.

107
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,580
If you're so stubborn,

108
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,140
I won't save some face for you.

109
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,260
We all know

110
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,060
about Mo Zhenfeng's counterfeiting.

111
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,700
And the real mastermind

112
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,220
and beneficiary of it

113
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,100
is our new CEO,

114
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:06,980
Ye Zhongjue.

115
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:08,580
How...?

116
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,660
How is that possible?

117
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,020
Do you think I'm willing to believe

118
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,620
that he did these crazy things?

119
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,460
Ah?

120
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,460
The evidence is overwhelming.

121
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,300
I have to believe it.

122
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:21,860
You can take a look.

123
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,500
All these contracts

124
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,540
bear Ye Zhongjue's signature

125
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,940
and his seal.

126
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,540
Everything

127
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,660
is crystal clear.

128
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,180
Take a good look.

129
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:33,900
Take a close look.

130
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,500
Mr. Ye, today, you will finally face

131
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,660
the consequences of all you've done.

132
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,060
Next,

133
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,060
Mr. Gu will tell us

134
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,180
about the evidence he has collected
in recent days.

135
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,020
These two contracts,

136
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,180
the fictitious contract signed
with the tea factory

137
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,420
and the power of attorney,

138
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,340
bear Mr. Ye's handwritten signature

139
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,380
and seal.

140
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:18,820
Come on.

141
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,100
Take a look.

142
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,740
Through my visits
over these many days,

143
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,060
I've discovered

144
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,140
a man frequents the tea factory.

145
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,260
And that man

146
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,780
is Mr. Ye.

147
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,580
After all,

148
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,860
that is the Ye family's property.

149
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,780
And both keys

150
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,660
are in the hands of them.

151
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,780
Ye Zhongjue, you used to live abroad,

152
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,820
and once you came back,

153
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,060
you married Mo Suqing,
Mo Zhenfeng's daughter.

154
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,780
No need to say more, right?

155
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:02,380
So the one behind the fraud

156
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,660
is Ye Zhongjue.

157
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,020
So you have long laid your trap

158
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,780
for me.

159
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,180
The tea factory
is our family's business,

160
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,300
but it's always been

161
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,700
taken care of by a subsidiary

162
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,340
of our group.

163
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,580
There's no way

164
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,900
the keys fall into private hands.

165
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,820
Wouldn't it be too hasty

166
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:31,740
to determine

167
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,980
that I'm the perpetrator
of this counterfeiting

168
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,140
based solely on the seal
and my personal schedules?

169
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,100
Excuse me, everybody.

170
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,380
I have no right to attend
the shareholders' meeting,

171
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,460
but my husband's name

172
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,740
is at stake here.

173
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:00,780
So pardon my intrusion.
