00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,560
What are you doing?

5
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,200
I'm looking for a bathroom, bro.

6
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,200
Sorry.

7
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,080
Wrong place.

8
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,200
Sorry.

9
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,480
Why the marriage certificate?

11
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,200
Just in time.

00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,280
(Adapted from the novel
"Mr. Intrigue's Love Game" by Yun Qi Mo Li)

13
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,560
I've drafted a divorce agreement.

14
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,240
Read it.

15
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,280
Don't worry.

16
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,960
I won't require a penny from you.

17
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,080
Let's just move on

18
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,560
like nothing ever happened.

19
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,560
I didn't agree to a divorce.

20
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,640
Just so you know,

21
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,200
I've hired a lawyer

22
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,200
to defend Mo Zhenfeng.

23
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,320
Why?

24
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,920
I have my reasons.

25
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,640
None of your business.

26
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,600
Have you ever thought

27
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,240
the lawyer that costs you
an arm and a leg

28
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,040
is not going to stand a chance?

29
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,280
It's my business.

30
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,680
Stay out of it.

31
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,600
Let Mo Zhenfeng off?

32
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,000
Mr. Ye,

33
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,680
you're not out of your mind, are you?

34
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,240
I will handle this myself.

35
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,480
I will give you

36
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,440
a reasonable explanation.

37
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,120
Mr. Ye,

38
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,440
do you mean

39
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,040
an explanation

40
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,240
that's not necessarily satisfying?

41
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,200
This is final.

42
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,600
I'll send people to keep an eye on

43
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,040
the destruction of the fake goods
made in Mo's factory.

44
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,320
Mr. Ye.

45
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,800
Ye Zhongjue,

46
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,400
you're insane.

47
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,560
As we discussed,

48
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,200
transfer all the shares
held on behalf of Ye Zhongjue

49
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,080
by batches.

50
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,400
Yes,

51
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,520
transfer them to me.

52
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,800
(Three weeks later)

53
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,440
Since I had graduated,

54
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,840
I had been together with Ye Xueli.

55
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,600
I had never been short of money.

56
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,160
But this old man

57
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,280
was just so stiff and boring.

58
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,200
But you

59
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,880
were a bit more romantic,

60
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,520
so I could use some fun.

61
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,000
Otherwise,

62
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,560
why would I descend

63
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,800
to having an affair
with a poor guy like you?

64
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,840
But

65
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,240
you gave birth to Sulian for me.

66
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,640
For you?

67
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,720
That's because I was using you

68
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,320
to have a child

69
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,720
so I could make Ye Xueli marry me.

70
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,720
Who would know that five years

71
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,720
after I gave birth to the child,

72
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,200
he would break up with me.

73
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,520
Even worse,

74
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,440
he'd rather adopt
Jian Jie from an orphanage,

75
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,200
than accept my daughter and me.

76
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,000
I was mad

77
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,280
so I drove to the orphanage
to argue with him,

78
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,400
but when I was passing by the tea farm,

79
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,480
that darn ex-wife of yours

80
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,440
crashed into my car.

81
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:33,680
If...

82
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,640
if you hadn't driven that fast,

83
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,000
she probably couldn't have died.

84
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,080
Look who's talking.

85
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,040
If she hadn't died,

86
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,520
how do you think

87
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,360
you would have gotten the factory
and the money?

88
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:46,800
You...!

89
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,240
After the accident,

90
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,080
I talked to Ye Xueli,

91
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,560
and he asked me to marry you,

92
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,600
saying that

93
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,440
you could present
a letter of understanding

94
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,600
as the victim's family,

95
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,040
so the case could be closed.

96
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,040
That's why

97
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,040
you brought Sulian to me

98
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,840
and told me

99
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,000
she was the child
you raised for me for five years

100
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,800
and that we were going to be rich,

101
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,840
prosperous,

102
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,360
and well-off.

103
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,000
Ha ha ha.

104
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,720
Ha ha ha!

105
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,520
Looking back,

106
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,360
this is karma.

107
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,240
It's all karma!

108
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,040
Cut the crap!

109
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,440
Karma?

110
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,720
It should go to Ye if Karma does exist!

111
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,400
Yet the least desired thing happened

112
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,320
that he found his biological son.

113
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,960
Biological son?

114
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,200
Do you mean

115
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,400
Ye Zhongjue?

116
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,160
Yes.

117
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,000
It is him.

118
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,560
Ever since he got back to the Ye family,

119
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,840
Ye Xueli didn't want Sulian,

120
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,080
the illegitimate daughter, even more.

121
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,920
So,

122
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,920
it may seem

123
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,600
that he was trying to settle
the car accident for me,

124
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,800
but actually,

125
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,000
he was breaking up with me.

126
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,800
That's why

127
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,480
you took a lot of shares
of Jueshi Group.

128
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,880
What a snake.

129
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,640
That is what I deserve!

130
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,720
I wasted ten years of youth on him.

131
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,600
Ten years!

132
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,520
He wanted Ye Zhongjue to inherit Jueshi.

133
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,080
So I sent Gu Jiannan
to compete with him.

134
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,400
As long as his family is in chaos,

135
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,840
I feel good.

136
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,880
So good.

137
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,240
Didn't you want to know

138
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,080
why I married you?

139
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,400
Now you know.

140
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,880
Get lost.

141
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,320
Never get near me.

142
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,000
I've had enough these years.

143
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,720
Don't show up.

144
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,200
Get lost!

145
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,320
Humph!
