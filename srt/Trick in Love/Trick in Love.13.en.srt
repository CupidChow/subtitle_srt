(How Could You Bear to Abandon Me?)

2
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:12,700
Mom!

3
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,060
Stop!

4
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:22,980
Bad...

5
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:24,620
Bad guy! Come and catch me!

6
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,140
You finally spoke up, you little punk!

7
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,310

00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,980
(Adapted from the novel
"Mr. Intrigue's Love Game" by Yun Qi Mo Li)

9
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,140
Minhui.

10
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:20,860
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,140
I took Bai Yue's money.

12
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,380
Even though she hit you with her car,

13
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,100
please don't blame her.

14
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,780
It was an accident.

15
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,380
She was very generous too.

16
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,420
She gave me the sum

17
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,020
I asked for, not a penny less.

18
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,220
Our daughter will have to go to college.

19
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:44,940
When she's old, she'll get married.

20
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:46,660
And I...

21
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,460
I will get old too.

22
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,100
So please,

23
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,180
put yourself in our shoes.

24
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,500
I will marry her

25
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,420
next month.

26
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,100
You'd want me

27
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,820
to give our daughter Suqing

28
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,220
a warm family, right?

29
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,500
Don't worry.

30
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,340
Bai Yue...

31
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,300
She has Jueshi Group backing her.

32
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,500
Our daughter,

33
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,740
Suqing,

34
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,940
will be able to live comfortably.

35
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:27,820
Alas.

36
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,740
Minhui.

37
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,100
You have to

38
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,660
understand me.

39
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,140
Are you better now?

40
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,140
I'm all good now.

41
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,100
I was rude yesterday.

42
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:08,340
It's fine.

43
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,340
Something about this quarter's plan

44
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,300
needs to be adjusted.

45
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,500
Jueshi Group's probiotic products
can be stored

46
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,940
at room temperature,

47
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:16,820
however,

48
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:17,500
conditions...

49
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,540
Is business the only thing
we can talk about now?

50
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,020
I don't want Suqing

51
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,100
to misunderstand.

52
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,540
When you were living abroad,

53
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,340
you would send me
a birthday present every year.

54
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,500
Now that you have a wife,
you forgot all about your friend.

55
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:39,620
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,500
I've been too busy lately, so I forgot.

57
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:43,700
It's fine.

58
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,540
This afternoon, we...

59
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,220
I have an appointment
with Mr. Li after work.

60
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:47,980
Do you want to join us?

61
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,740
It's my birthday today,
so I don't want to work.

62
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:10,660
Mrs. Ye.

63
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,380
I have an appointment
with Mr. Li after work.

64
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,420
I will come home as soon as I can
for the Qixi Festival.

65
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:16,740
I'm busy.

66
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,820
I'm meeting my friend tonight.

67
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,340
Who are you celebrating
the Qixi Festival with?

68
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:21,860
With my best friend.

69
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,900
I spend every Qixi Festival
with my best friend.

70
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,700
Is there a problem?

71
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,260
How can you bear to abandon me?

72
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,900
Does it feel good to be abandoned?

73
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,340
What do you mean?

74
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:45,380
Mr. Li.

75
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,900
I'm sorry for disturbing you today.

76
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,340
I wanted to talk about

77
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,100
an issue with our Health Pot
product line.

78
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,180
Ye.

79
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,100
You just came back not long ago,

80
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,940
yet you already know
the company inside out.

81
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,460
I'm impressed.

82
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,300
You flattered me.

83
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,580
Jueshi Group could only come this far

84
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,340
because of the older generation heroes

85
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,180
like you.

86
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,820
So when it comes to crucial matters,

87
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,500
I still want to discuss them with you.

88
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,700
You can get straight to the point.

89
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,500
I'd love to be of help to you

90
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,780
while I still can.

91
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,780
Perhaps I can give you some pointers.

92
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,620
I want to

93
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,100
cancel Health Pot's product line.

94
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,820
Why?

95
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,380
We have

96
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,820
the patent for the Health Pot,

97
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,740
but its core lies in the inner tank.

98
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,540
Its exterior can be imitated
very easily.

99
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,540
This bears a great risk for us.

100
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,100
If others fake the product,

101
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,980
it will cause irreparable damage to us.

102
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,620
Mr. Ye.

103
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,700
As a major shareholder,

104
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,180
I agree with your suggestion.

105
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,540
However, I'm also your senior.

106
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,580
What I want to say is this.

107
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,020
Sometimes,

108
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,940
there is no need to rush.
