(I Share Every Trait She Has)

2
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:10,980
So, Ye Zhongjue

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,580
does have a female best friend
in the company.

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,660
A true rich beauty.

5
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,060
She is even Jueshi Group's vice CEO.

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,940
They seem perfect for each other.

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:24,340
Listen,

8
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,500
when it comes to things like this,
you mustn't get into a fight with her.

9
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,460
Do not argue with her
in front of Ye Zhongjue.

10
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:29,660
You need to show affection.

11
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:30,580
As much as you can.

12
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,220
Show Jian Jie that you
have a strong bond with him.

13
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,020
No one can do you apart.

14
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,940
Jian Jie is not to be underestimated.

15
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:39,820
The closer she is to him,

16
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,060
the more she may become my obstacle.

17
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:43,780
That's right.

18
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,420
Or you might end up gaining nothing

19
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,820
and losing everything.

20
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:48,860
You are right.

21
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,580
I must make sure she disappears.

22
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:52,740
That's the right attitude.

23
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,220
Here, cheers.

24
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,470
=Trick in Love=

25
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:02,980
(Adapted from the novel
"Mr. Intrigue's Love Game" by Yun Qi Mo Li)

26
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,660
Mr. CEO! Help!

27
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,340
Your wife drank too much!

28
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,700
Hurry!

29
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,820
Come!

30
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:12,580
Careful.

31
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:14,460
How did this happen?

32
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:15,780
I can still drink.

33
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:16,780
I'll never drink with her again.

34
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:17,460
It's so scary.

35
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,540
Bring her inside quickly.

36
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:19,500
Thank you.

37
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,020
I'm exhausted.

38
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:21,540
Careful.

39
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,380
What happened?

40
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:25,380
Careful.

41
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,300
I can still drink.

42
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:31,700
I'll get you your slippers.

43
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,420
Put on the slippers.

44
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:39,820
Don't catch a cold.

45
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,020
Why did you drink so much?

46
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,380
Because I'm upset.

47
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,660
Who made Mrs. Ye so angry?

48
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,100
I don't like Jian Jie

49
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,620
acting like she knows you really well

50
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,820
in front of me.

51
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,060
This is my man.

52
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,140
I don't need her to tell me
to be nice to you.

53
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,700
That's why you got mad this afternoon?

54
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,180
You were jealous of Jian Jie?

55
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,580
Are you an idiot?

56
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,540
How could I not realize

57
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,620
that's why you were upset?

58
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:26,780
I really thought

59
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,780
you wanted to spend the day

60
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,500
with Leng Xiyao.

61
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,980
Oh, please.

62
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,420
It's the Chinese Valentine's Day!

63
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,340
Of course I want to spend it with you!

64
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,740
But you made me angry.

65
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,540
Don't be angry.

66
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,140
Let's not talk about
those upsetting things.

67
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,460
You made me angry.

68
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,540
It's all my fault.

69
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,740
(You like him,)

70
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,340
(but you're afraid to tell him?)

71
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,780
(Because you are scared of rejection.)

72
00:03:06,825 --> 00:03:10,675
(Ye Zhongjue)
(Can you come out...)

73
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,660
Stay here for just a little while.

74
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:23,860
I'll go get you your clothes.

75
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:25,820
Okay.

76
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,325
(Jian Jie)
(Can you come out and have a talk?)

77
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,540
Do you like Jian Jie?

78
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:38,460
I don't.

79
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,780
Did you ask her out
to celebrate the festival?

80
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:41,540
I didn't.

81
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:42,940
You are lying.

82
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,060
Her message is clearly inviting you out.

83
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,780
She did invite me,

84
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:47,860
but I didn't go.

85
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,500
If I didn't come home,

86
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,900
you would have gone to her, right?

87
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:55,980
No.

88
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,620
Liar.

89
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,020
No,

90
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,740
my wife won't let me.

91
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:06,860
Send it.

92
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:13,660
It's sent.

93
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:15,475
(No, my wife won't let me.)

94
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,620
Kiss!

95
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,540
Do you like long hair or short hair?

96
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:33,180
Long...

97
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,260
Long hair.

98
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,300
You were stuttering.

99
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,140
You liar!

100
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:42,300
Where are you going?

101
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:44,580
Don't get tripped.

102
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,940
I share every trait she has.

103
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,780
I can cut my hair short, too.

104
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,380
Let go!

105
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,660
Are you alright?

106
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:46,900
You're the only one I can see.

107
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,275
(Ye Zhongjue)

108
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:58,875
(Jian Jie)

109
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:43,420
Mr. Li.

110
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,580
Our patented Health Pot has been faced

111
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,900
with many complaints
and chargebacks lately.

112
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,620
You must have noticed.

113
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,380
It's because

114
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,820
our 499 yuan Health Pot

115
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,420
looks exactly the same

116
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,700
as the cheap pots on the market

117
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:55,660
which only cost 79 yuan.

118
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,300
I suspect

119
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,020
that some factory
is copying our product.

120
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,620
I'm surprised your guess was right.

121
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,180
But whatever the case,

122
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,740
we need to find the root of the problem.

123
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:12,940
If not,

124
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,860
Jueshi Group's years of good reputation

125
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,020
will be done for.

126
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:19,620
I understand.

127
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,300
Mr. Li.

128
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,460
Mr. Li usually doesn't come
to the office.

129
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:36,700
What happened?

130
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:39,980
Nothing.

131
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:40,860
A small matter.

132
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,020
I will handle it.

133
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,460
A patented product

134
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,020
facing huge amounts
of chargebacks and complaints

135
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,260
is a small matter?

136
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,540
Did you choose to hide it from me

137
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,340
because the factory

138
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,140
that manufactures the Health Pot
is owned by the Mo family?

139
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,940
I said I will handle this.

140
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,220
Fine.

141
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,020
I'll wait for your news.

142
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:06,860
Also,

143
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,740
I will tell the warehouse

144
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,580
to reject all products

145
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,380
manufactured by their factory.

146
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,060
I hope you will act
in the company's best interest

147
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,580
and don't hinder me.
