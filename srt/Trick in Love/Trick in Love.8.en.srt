=Episode 8=
[Honesty and Duplicity]

2
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:14,300
Mr. Li,

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,580
my daughter is still young

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:16,620
and has little experience.

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,340
Please help her when you can.

6
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:18,580
Sure.

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,620
I will look after her.

8
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,980
Mr. Li is young and capable.

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,180
Ha ha ha.

10
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:25,340
Cheers.

11
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:26,100
Sure.

12
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:30,260
Ms. Jian,

13
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,220
I am very happy with the order to Italy

14
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,300
this time.

15
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:34,980
This is all we strive for, Mr. Li.

16
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,700
Fashion is one of the sub-projects
of our group,

17
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,140
and it is one of our cores.

18
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:39,980
Great.

19
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,380
We will continue to work together.

20
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,260
I will forward you
the order to Britain next time.

21
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:44,460
Oh,

22
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,260
really, Mr. Li?

23
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,580
Let's drink to our next cooperation.

24
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:47,500
Cheers.

25
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:52,580
Excuse me.

26
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,580
Gu Jiannan will be here anytime.

27
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:02,580
Are you ready?

28
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:07,260
Ms. Jian,

29
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,540
Mr. Zhang is here.
Would you like to meet him?

30
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,150
=Trick in Love=

31
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,740
(Adapted from the novel
"Mr. Intrigue's Love Game" by Yun Qi Mo Li)

32
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:15,540
Mr. Zhang.

33
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:39,780
Everyone,

34
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:40,980
come over.

35
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,180
Here. Come here.

36
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,180
Let's go.

37
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,420
Let's see what Mr. Gu has to say.

38
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:46,780
Sure.

39
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,060
Recently,

40
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,540
a scandalous video about me
is circulating in the company.

41
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,180
I am angry about it,

42
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:53,620
so today,

43
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,780
with this opportunity,

44
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:56,980
first,

45
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,500
I would like to introduce you

46
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,260
my girlfriend,

47
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,380
Miss Mo Suqing.

48
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,700
And secondly,

49
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,300
I would also like to clarify it

50
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,180
and allow Miss Mo Suqing

51
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,380
to tell everyone personally

52
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,940
that I am not that kind of person.

53
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,380
I will never do
anything like that either.

54
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:13,420
That's right.

55
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,980
Mr. Gu is a righteous person.

56
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,300
Who posted that video?

57
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,620
How disgraceful.

58
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:18,740
Alright.

59
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,020
Now,

60
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,580
please allow my girlfriend,
Miss Mo Suqing,

61
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,020
to clarify it.

62
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:26,500
Alright.

63
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,060
My loved one

64
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,500
is kind and brave.

65
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,260
He is not only tall and handsome

66
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,900
but also thoughtful and sweet.

67
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,780
Because of me, he will

68
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:47,780
get upset and feel hurt.

69
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,580
He will also get up early every day

70
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,780
to prepare
a freshly-made breakfast for me.

71
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:54,980
Suqing,

72
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,020
that's too much.

73
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:56,780
Get to the business.

74
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,420
How could you refuse

75
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,020
to marry someone like that?

76
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,420
I never say I'm going to marry you.

77
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,300
You don't deserve it.

78
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,140
The video is real.

79
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,540
I witnessed it with my own eyes

80
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,700
that Gu Jiannan cheated on me

81
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,940
and had an affair with my sister.

82
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,020
He is totally rotten.

83
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:23,900
Mo Suqing,

84
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,500
are you insane?

85
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,460
But I wasn't talking about Gu Jiannan,

86
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:29,580
but him.

87
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,060
Who?

88
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,180
Ye Zhongjue.

89
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,420
What?

90
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,500
Mo Suqing,

91
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,340
are you insane?

92
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:39,860
Ha ha ha.

93
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:40,900
Everyone,

94
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,020
excuse me.

95
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,500
My daughter Suqing

96
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,820
likes to fantasize.

97
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,260
Please don't take it to heart.

98
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:46,940
Sorry for that.

99
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,860
You are ruining the fame

100
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,380
of Mr. Gu and Mr. Ye.

101
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,620
Jueshi Group

102
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,780
is not what you can trash-talk about.

103
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,020
That's right.

104
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:56,420
Security,

105
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,460
get her out of here.

106
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,380
Get her out!

107
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,580
Get her out of here.

108
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,660
Stop making trouble here.

109
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,780
You are not welcome.

110
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,300
Right now! Immediately!

111
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,980
Get her out.

112
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,420
Out of here.

113
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,060
What is she doing?

114
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,100
Get her out.

115
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,540
Who is this?

116
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:54,940
Mo Suqing,

117
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,340
you shameless woman.

118
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,620
I thought you were pure and innocent.

119
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,660
You and Ye...

120
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:01,380
Ye...

121
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,140
Suqing,

122
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,340
you and he...

123
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,100
We fell in love at first sight.

124
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,460
Shouldn't you be happy for us?

125
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:12,820
Yes.

126
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:13,380
Of course.

127
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,020
How about you?

128
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,980
Shouldn't you be happy for us as well?

129
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:19,700
Humph!

130
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,260
You did all this to embarrass me.

131
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,900
No wonder Mr. Mo said
you've been scheming since young.

132
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,460
Just you wait.

133
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,860
I will let you pay for this.

134
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,580
Eh-hem.

135
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,540
Mr. Gu,

136
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:35,820
I'm afraid you will not have the chance.

137
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,500
What's the matter, Mr. Ye?

138
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:38,780
What do you want

139
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:39,740
in this situation?

140
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,460
About the project of Sanya,

141
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,180
Gu Jiannan made a sexual deal
with his power.

142
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,100
His self-dealing caused the company

143
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,220
to lose nearly a million.

144
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,460
These

145
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:53,940
are the evidence.

146
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:56,740
What?

147
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:57,900
Hurry.

148
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,540
Have a look.

149
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,500
How could this happen?

150
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,300
Wait, look.

151
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:07,820
You...

152
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:08,940
Ye...

153
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:09,580
Ye...

154
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,380
Mr. Gu!

155
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,140
Jiannan!

156
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,300
Mr. Gu!

157
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,700
Call an ambulance.

158
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,100
Hurry!

159
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,380
Mr. Gu, how are you?

160
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,300
These are the evidence.

161
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,580
This is who he really is.

162
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,740
How shameful.

163
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:37,980
I've been fooled

164
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,660
by you completely.

165
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,380
You must think

166
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,540
I am so stupid and ridiculous

167
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,220
these days.

168
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,180
Don't be angry.

169
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,620
I hid my identity

170
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,540
just because you said
you hated rich people.

171
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,500
That was why...

172
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,420
You pretended to be poor to pursue me.

173
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,140
Only rich guys like you

174
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:52,860
would have such an idea.

175
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,580
Do you find
a sense of achievement in lying?

176
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:56,980
I didn't mean that.

177
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,780
I never wanted to lie to you.

178
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,540
I was just afraid that you'd reject me.

179
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:01,860
I like you,

180
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,660
but I don't know

181
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,260
how to keep you by my side.

182
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,140
That's why I did all the stupid things.

183
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,460
Suqing,

184
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,420
I know you have bad experiences.

185
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,940
You don't trust others,

186
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,620
but please trust me.

187
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,740
I am worthy of your trust.

188
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,140
I don't care about it.

189
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,260
Didn't you just say

190
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,340
that you were going to marry me?

191
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,460
Did I?

192
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,940
I just said that you were my loved one.

193
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,300
And I did all this

194
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,740
