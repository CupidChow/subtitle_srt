Why are you so indifferent
to Ye Zhongjue?

00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:11,980
If I were him,
I would have ignored you long ago.

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,380
I'm playing hard to get with him.

You should make sure
it's under your control.

If you go too far,

9
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,300
he won't be interested in you.

10
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,860
Everything is under my control so far.

00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,700
What's going on, Mo Suqing?

12
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:27,100
I've known you for over a decade,

13
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,940
but I didn't notice
that you are so attractive.

14
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:30,860
Neither did I.

15
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,180
Say something!

16
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,220
Are you pretending to be dumb?

17
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:57,700
Are you telling me or not?

18
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,180
Tell me!

19
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,140
Say something!

20
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:04,300
Say!

21
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:06,820
Still pretending, huh?

22
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,180
Say something!

23
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:11,660

Are you dumb?

28
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,540
Is he a bad guy?

29
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,180
The bad guy left.

Let me save you out of here.

31

Suqing,

since the day I met you,

38
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,300
I've been...

39
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:04,660
Are you going to

40
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,020
propose to me?

41
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,580
We just met a few days ago.

42
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,140
Are you sure

43
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,580
you really love me?

44
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,980
I'm sure.

45
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,540
And I'm sure

46
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,460
you love me too,

Are you willing to marry me

Suqing,

52
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:33,980
I know

53
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,140
you endured grievances

54
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,780
that others didn't,

55
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:38,900
and you experienced pain

56
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,820
that others didn't.

57
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,900
You're always cautious,

58
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,380
and do not trust others.

59
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,260
But every word I'm saying is true.

60
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,060
Since the first day I met you,

61
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,660
I've fallen in love with you.

62
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,620
Maybe you don't believe in
love at first sight.

63
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:03,900
But for me,

64
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,900
since the first day I met you,

65
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,500
it happened.

66
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,740

67
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,740

I want you to stay by my side,

69
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,540
and I'm worried
that you'll leave me someday.

70
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:24,980
I know

71
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,060
that you can't wholly trust me now.

72
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,940
But I'm not forcing you to marry me.

73
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,420
If you are not saying yes today,

let's go to another store.

113
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,980
I really don't like
wearing wedding dresses,

114
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,380
taking photos in a wedding dress,

115
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:25,940
holding a wedding ceremony,

116
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,340
or showing off our love
in front of others.

117
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,140
I don't like these things.

118
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,940
But I can't wait to see you
in a wedding dress.

119
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,980
I have to do things
to meet your expectations.

120
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,580
Isn't this a kind of constraint
by marriage?

121
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,540
Maybe the way I put it misled you.

122
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,900
I mean putting on a wedding dress

123
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,220
represents the start of happiness.

124
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,420
Oh, is that so? Really?

125
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,260
What a beautiful lie.

126
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,300
But to me,

127
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,180
wedding dress means constraint,

128
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:51,900
a curse.

129
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,180
It's just a dress.

130
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,380
Do you have to take it this seriously?

131
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:56,780
What do you mean by

132
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,220
taking it this seriously?

133
00:06:58,780 --> 00:06:59,860
Mind your attitude.

134
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,060
When a woman agrees to be a man,

135
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:02,940
she won't be cherished.

136
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:03,620
If you insist,

137
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:04,980
then forget about the dress.

138
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,540
I never said I wanted to wear one.

139
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,060
Mr. Ye,

140
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,660
do you really want to see me
in a wedding dress?

142
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:04,780
