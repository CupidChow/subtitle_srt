00:00:04,463 --> 00:00:07,240
(Kisses of Forgiveness
and Crimson Bed Sheet)

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,480
I've contacted a lawyer team.

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,600
They handled Hongyuan Group's case

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,520
last month.

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,280
We can talk tomorrow

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,240
and see if we can cooperate.

8
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,280
I've told you I'll sort out the cost.

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,200
I'll keep you posted.

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,640
My dear, thank you.

11
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,760
You are amazing.

12
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,240
Thanks to you,

13
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,920
Jueshi Group withdrew
the case right away.

14
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,560
You're amazing.

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,760
Excuse me, a cup of water.

16
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,880
Ye Zhongjue

17
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,160
is indeed a nice person.

18
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,320
Way better than

19
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,760
that hypocritical dad of his.

20
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,480
I really need to

21
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,520
thank my good girl.

22
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,160
Without you,

23
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,320
Ye Zhongjue

24
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,280
wouldn't withdraw the case that easily,

25
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,920
right?

26
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,240
=Trick in Love=

27
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:07,240
(Adapted from the novel
"Mr. Intrigue's Love Game" by Yun Qi Mo Li)

28
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,200
Zhongjue,

29
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,040
you're really in big trouble this time.

30
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,880
Because of the withdrawal,

31
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,520
we paid a huge amount of penalty.

32
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,400
The shareholders are not happy about it.

33
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,000
It's not easy for Ms. Jian either.

34
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,480
Is it really worth it

35
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,680
doing all this for her?

36
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,280
Hello.

37
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,920
Ye Zhongjue, are you insane?

38
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,000
You let Mo Zhenfeng off just like that?

39
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,560
Do you think the board will let you go?

40
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,720
Are you worried about me?

41
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,880
We're getting a divorce.

42
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,160
Now that we've decided to break apart,

43
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,680
why do you have to

44
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,120
make yourself look that bad
because of me?

45
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,480
Who said we were divorcing?

46
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,320
I never said yes.

47
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,480
The woman I marry

48
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,480
is the person
I'm spending my lifetime with.

49
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,800
What a fool.

50
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,520
Where are you?

51
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:19,800
What's wrong?

52
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,200
What happened?

53
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,360
Why are you being so nice to me?

54
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,200
What do you see in me

55
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,520
that makes you think I'm worth it?

56
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,760
If I'm doing something
that will hurt you,

57
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,320
can you not

58
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,560
go along and hurt yourself too?

59
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,360
You let Mo Zhenfeng off,

60
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,960
do you know what you'll have to face?

61
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,360
Ye Zhongjue,

62
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,240
what I hate the most

63
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,480
is to owe anyone anything.

64
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,720
You don't owe me anything.

65
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,280
I'm being nice to you

66
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,240
because I love you.

67
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,960
No matter what you do,

68
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,720
I will be by your side.

69
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,400
This is my own decision.

70
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,680
It has nothing to do with you.

71
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,480
You don't need to feel burdened.

72
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,200
But it does concern me.

73
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,680
Since my mom died,

74
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,440
no one has ever cared about me,

75
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,440
except you.

76
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,000
How can I not care?

77
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,400
Why would I not care?

78
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,400
Whatever I do,

79
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,680
I do it for your happiness.

80
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,520
If you really feel bad about it,

81
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,080
then don't cry.

82
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,320
Be good.

83
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,560
Ye Zhongjue.

84
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,720
I'm here.

85
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,440
Why did you never explain

86
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,880
what you did when you were a kid?

87
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,760
Why didn't you tell me

88
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,880
the reason why you left?

89
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,040
I failed to help you.

90
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,680
I feel sorry.

91
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,840
Are you stupid?

92
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,560
So,

93
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,880
have you forgiven me?

94
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,480
So,

95
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,760
can you forgive me too?

with this solution.

Mr. Ye,

124
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,880
you instructed to let Mo Zhenfeng off.

125
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,800
You also promised the board

126
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,080
you would destroy all the fake goods.

127
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,360
So now,

128
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,720
we need you to answer a question.

129
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,680
Why are the fakes still available
in the market?

130
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,240
I destroyed the fake goods in person.

131
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,320
Technically, there shouldn't be
any problem,

132
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,280
unless someone

133
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,040
transferred the goods
before I got involved,

134
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,200
