=Episode 11=
(Used My Seal, Then You're Mine)

2
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,020
You'll soon become my secretary.

3
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,460
Why are you still busy
with the news thing?

4
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,900
This is the topic
I didn't finish before.

5
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,060
I don't want to leave it unfinished.

6
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:31,500
Pangoo Building?

7
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,820
The projects
that Ms. Bai is in charge of

8
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:40,860
have all achieved large profits

9
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,420
in a short period.

10
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,100
That's impressive.

11
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,620
I suggest

12
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:46,740
we make additional investments

13
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:47,980
to realize a win-win result.

14
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:49,340
I second that.

15
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:50,700
Me too.

16
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,180
Mr. Ye,

17
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,180
you seem to have a lot on your mind.

18
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:57,940
Scud Airline,

19
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,020
Ronne Trading,

20
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:00,580
and Pangoo Building.

21
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,700
There are potential risks
with these projects.

22
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,380
We should terminate the co-operations.

23
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:05,900
Mr. Ye,

24
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,380
we don't accept groundless speculation.

25
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:09,980
Do you have any evidence?

26
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:10,980
=Trick in Love=

27
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,460
(Adapted from the novel)
Since Mr. Ye said so,

28
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,300
("Mr. Intrigue's Love Game" Yun Qi Mo Li)
he must have evidence.

29
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:15,260
Tut.

30
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:18,900
These companies seem

31
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,620
to be operating normally.

32
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:21,540
However,

33
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:22,580
they are actually in crisis.

34
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,500
Quality control for the contractor
in Pangoo Building

35
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:26,700
is an issue.

36
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,420
Fighting

37
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,860
at Ronne Trading's foundry

38
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,300
aroused public opinion.

39
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:32,540
Also,

40
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:33,820
Scud Airline's financial chain

41
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,220
has broken more than once,

42
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,340
hasn't it?

43
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:39,500
I attended

44
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,180
the grand wedding of the son

45
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,940
of Scud Airline's president
the other day.

46
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,020
It was extremely luxurious.

47
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,620
The bigwigs all went
to congratulate them.

48
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,020
Mr. Ye,

49
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,500
where did you get the information

50
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,820
on their financial chain break?

51
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:56,860
Oh?

52
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,820
I couldn't believe

53
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,700
that the appearance actually got you.

54
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,580
The contractor of Pangoo Building

55
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,860
has cut corners on the work.

56
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,220
The estate proprietors
obtained evidence.

57
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,500
Give out the files.

58
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,380
Have a look.

59
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:20,540
There's a printout

60
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,460
of the press release

61
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,820
for Pangoo Building

62
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,500
and

63
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,820
public opinion on Ronne Trading Fight.

64
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,500
The factory manager's lover
is running the factory.

65
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,020
When his wife found out,

66
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:33,740
she made a big fuss in the factory,

67
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,060
which caused the fight.

68
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,420
As for the debit notes
from Scud Airline,

69
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,700
they spent a lot of money

70
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:40,660
on publicity for that wedding

71
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,940
to cover up their financial chain break.

72
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:42,820
Yet, they are not even able

73
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,740
to cover the final payment

74
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,780
to the advertising agency.

75
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,620
Any more objection?

76
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,420
If no,

77
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:54,580
we'll terminate the co-operations

78
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,740
with these companies.

79
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:56,380
You're free to go now.

80
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,740
That's quite a heavy blow

81
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:10,780
to Bai Yue.

82
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,180
Zhongjue,

83
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:12,700
well done.

84
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,700
Ms. Mo,

85
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,860
I don't think you should touch

86
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,780
your boss's stuff
without his permission.

87
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,580
According to company rules,

88
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,300
you're not allowed

89
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,700
in the director's office or above.

90
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,060
You're not officially on board.
Understand?

91
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:13,980
She's my visitor.

92
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,260
OK.

93
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,860
I need your visitor to end her visit

94
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,300
and register at the personnel department

95
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,460
by 12.

96
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,340
Here are the termination agreements
for those three projects.

97
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:28,900
Sign on them.

98
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,020
I will.

99
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:36,700
Sorry.

100
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,380
I dropped your seal.

101
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:43,780
It's OK.

102
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:53,660
Since you used my seal,

103
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,260
then you're mine.

104
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:56,260
What's mine

105
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,220
is yours.

106
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,060
Do a background check on Mo Suqing.

107
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,140
Yeah.

108
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,860
You really care about Mr. Ye,

109
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,860
don't you?

110
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,020
Thank you, but this is not about you.

111
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,260
You did so many things
to get Ye Zhongjue back.

112
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,300
Did you do it for the company

113
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,660
or yourself?

114
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,620
You like him,

115
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,820
but you don't dare to tell him.

116
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,060
You're afraid
that he will turn you down.

117
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,020
In that case,

118
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,100
why should you

119
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,260
care about him?

120
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,460
You're really

121
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,980
flattering yourself.

122
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:04,860
New girl?

123
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,180
Yes.

124
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,100
(Why is this chair broken?)

125
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,540
That belongs to the team leader.

126
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,860
You'll be doomed if you touch it.

127
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,860
You can visit the back office
and apply for a replacement.

128
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:31,660
OK.

129
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,940
But they're busy.

130
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,180
You'll have to wait for a week.

131
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,540
Jueshi Group is a huge group.

132
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,100
Can't the president do anything
to the broken chairs?

133
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,260
Are you insane?

134
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,060
The president will not bother
with changing chairs.

135
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,380
My chair is broken.
I need a new one.

136
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,100
OK.

137
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,220
Ah...

138
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,500
Ah...
