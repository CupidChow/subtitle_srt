(Time to Wake Up)

2
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:38,540
You're up?

3
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:40,300
Yes.

4
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:05,980
Did you sleep well last night?

5
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,340
Yes.

6
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,300
If you stare at me like this,

7
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:15,500
I...

8
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,500
=Trick in Love=

9
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,490
(Adapted from the novel
"Mr. Intrigue's Love Game" by Yun Qi Mo Li)

10
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,300
I'm making breakfast
and it's a bit noisy.

11
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,100
Why don't you sleep for a while more?

12
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:06,980
I'll try to keep it down.

13
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,820
I've already been woken by you.

14
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,060
How am I supposed to sleep?

15
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,660
Sorry.

16
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,300
I'm already so old.

17
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,740
Can't believe I am still having
this kind of dream.

18
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,380
What?

19
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,460
What?

20
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:21,620
Oh,

21
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,140
I said

22
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,780
since it's spring now,

23
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,660
I should get up earlier.

24
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,060
Okay.

25
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,940
You're jobless.

26
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,580
Why are you staying home

27
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,820
instead of going for interviews?

28
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,580
I have an interview later.

29
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,260
I'm going out in a while.

30
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,340
(Let's see how long
you can keep putting on this act.)

31
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,020
Where will you have your interview?

32
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,140
Can I go with you?

33
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,420
The office
is very very far away from here.

34
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:55,980
It's fine.

35
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:57,900
I can take a day off.

36
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,540
Besides, I could use some fresh air too.

37
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,340
Are you sure you can be this impulsive?

38
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,420
I don't really care about my work now.

39
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,460
Work hasn't been going well recently.

40
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,940
I studied administrative management
at university,

41
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,260
so I want to find a job
that matches my expertise.

42
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,140
You don't want me to go with you?

43
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,140
No.

44
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:13,700
Of course I do.

45
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,260
Let's have breakfast first.

46
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:22,780
Wow.

47
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,220
Did you learn all these
when you were abroad?

48
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,220
Abroad?

49
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,980
This is a Western-style breakfast.

50
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,740
So I assume you must have
lived abroad for some time.

51
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:33,380
No...

52
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,340
Not really.

53
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,900
I'll go wash up first.

54
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,380
Okay.

55
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,420
That was close.

56
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,700
Mr. Ye, what is it?

57
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,460
I almost got found out!

58
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,060
Arrange for a video interview
in five minutes.

59
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,340
Interview?

60
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,420
Who are we interviewing?

61
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:07,940
Me.

62
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,980
What's going on?

63
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,020
I lied that I was going for an interview

64
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:11,700
and she insists on going with me.

65
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,060
I'm going to tell her

66
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,060
that I'm asked to do
an online interview.

67
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:14,940
You're the interviewer.

68
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:15,700
Just put on an act

69
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,380
and brush her off.

70
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,700
No, wait.

71
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,700
But what topics should I cover
in the interview?

72
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:19,740
No topics need to be covered.

73
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,140
Just remember

74
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,380
that I majored
in electrical engineering.

75
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,220
You're from the company's
HR Department.

76
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,620
The office is located in a remote place.

77
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,340
That's all.

78
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,860
No, this is too difficult!

79
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,180
I...

80
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,060
Who is on the phone?

81
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,180
The company just called me

82
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,140
and said it's changed
to an online interview.

83
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:35,940
Okay.

84
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,420
Eat first.

85
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:38,380
Okay.

86
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:41,740
Do you like it?

87
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,340
Yes.

88
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:44,620
If you like it,

89
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,620
I'll make it for you every day.

90
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:53,700
Oh, right.

91
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,180
You said you wanted to find a job

92
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,620
that matches your expertise.

93
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:57,340
Do you mean it?

94
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:58,460
Yes.

95
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,860
Is there a company you want to join?

96
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,180
I want to join Jueshi Group.

97
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,540
I heard Jueshi Group has a new CEO

98
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,900
who is nice and capable.

99
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,340
He also improved employee welfare
the moment he assumed his position.

100
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,180
Everyone respects him a lot.

101
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,260
I think with a boss like that,

102
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,340
this company will be

103
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,260
quite promising.

104
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,540
Who did you hear this from?

105
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,340
Our newspaper wrote
a featured report about them.

106
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,820
This is the kind of image
rich people love to create.

107
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,060
It's just one article.
Not convincing at all.

108
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,340
Do you hate rich people?

109
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,460
Don't you?

110
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,140
It depends.

111
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,100
Not all rich people are bad.

112
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,140
My interview.

113
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,140
Hello.

114
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,300
We've checked your resume

115
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,060
and we're impressed.

116
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,620
If a talented person like you

117
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,500
joins our company,

118
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,340
we would be really lucky.

119
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,540
Honestly,

120
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,540
if you join our company,

121
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,940
you will be really popular.

122
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,580
You'll be a breath of fresh air to us!

123
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,540
Thank you.

124
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,580
I'll report for duty tomorrow.

125
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,300
Sure,

126
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,460
no problem!

127
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,820
But

128
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,220
our company

129
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,820
may be a little far from you.

130
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,740
It will take about two hours
to get here by car.

131
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,340
If there's a traffic jam
during the peak hours,

132
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,700
it will take about three hours.

133
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,620
Is that okay with you?

134
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,860
Of course it is.

135
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,020
Your girlfriend won't mind, right?

136
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:30,700
I...

137
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,420
I'm single.

138
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,940
Single?

139
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:33,940
That's a pity.

140
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,340
You're so outstanding.

141
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,300
How could you not have a girlfriend?

142
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,380
I can assure you

143
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,740
that after you join us,

144
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,540
I'll introduce someone nice to you.

145
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,860
Whoever marries you

146
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,500
will be really lucky!

147
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,660
Seriously,

148
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,860
you have outstanding grades,

149
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,260
you're ambitious,

150
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,500
and you can cook well.

151
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,580
Most importantly...

152
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,580
If there's nothing else,

153
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,540
I'd like to call it a day for now.

154
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,060
Bye-bye.

155
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:56,740
He hung up?

156
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:04,940
He sure is warm-hearted.

157
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,940
Tell me about it.

158
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,060
Yeah.

159
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,300
Mo Sulian

160
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,860
speaks ill of you
in the office every day.

161
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,100
If you continue to tolerate it,

162
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,540
she'll literally
turn something false into real.

163
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,100
Who said I'm going to tolerate it?

164
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,140
Yes.

165
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,740
You have to teach her a lesson.

166
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,340
I'll find two actors to intimidate her.

167
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:30,580
No.

168
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,660
This time, I'm going to it myself.

169
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,060
Okay.

170
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:51,780
Mr. Gu,

171
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,420
the receptionist
just signed a parcel for you.

172
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:56,740
You can get back to work.

173
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:57,540
Okay.

00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,700
Alas.

177
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,340
I'm going to propose to Jiannan.

178
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,820
In the future,

179
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,540
you will have no place in this family.

180
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,500
You'll always be inferior to me.

181
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,580
This family is about to become
a recycling center.

182
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,220
I won't go there even if you invite me.

183
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:03,860
Humph.
