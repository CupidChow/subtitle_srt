He went out.

May I know who you are?

30
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,100
I'm an owner of a construction company.

31

I paid a visit here this time

32

Mrs. Ye.

37
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,460
Nice to meet you.

38
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,260
Do you feel good living in the house?

39
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,180
Yeah.

40
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,060
You said just now

41
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,420
that you made the house for him.

42
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:37,740
What do you mean?

43
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,580
Mr. Ye gave me a picture,

44
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,780
and he asked me to design
based on the picture.

45
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,420
Design draft?

46
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:48,580
Look.

48
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,420
Come on. I'll take you out.

49

Hey, what are you doing?

50
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,220
Freeze!

51
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,740
Brats, you want to run?

52
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,820
Let go of him!

53
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,780
I'll work hard to earn money
when I grow up,

54
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,820
and I'll buy a house
like this downtown.

55
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,300
Do you like it?

56
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,620
Alright.

57
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,620
Keep it then.

58
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:41,820
Guess what it is.

59

Cluck, cluck, cluck.

60
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,260
No.

Quack, quack, quack.

62
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,020
No.

63
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,020
It's an eagle.

64
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,100
It doesn't look like an eagle.

65
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,020
So you can speak?

66
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,460
Hush! Don't have the bad guys heard.

67
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,220
I'm sorry.

68
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:03,820
You were also tied here

69
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,180
because of me.

70
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,660
It doesn't matter.

71
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,780
My mom will surely find me.

72
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,820
Then we will be safe.

73
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:18,620
Is it him?

74
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,540
Is it him?

75
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,700
It turns out
Ye Zhongjue is the dumb boy.

76
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,180
No way.

77
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,060
You wanted to play tricks on him,

78
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,260
but you fell into his trap instead.

79
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,740
But why did he do these things?

80
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,220
He built a house

81
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,620
that you wanted when you were young,

82
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,660
and then tried so hard to woo you.

83
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,580
Did he want to make it up for you

84
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:37,980
because of his guilt?

85
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,580
He ran away

86
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,340
when I really needed him back then.

87
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,980
What's the point of
making it up for me now?

88
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,020
That's reasonable.

89
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,060
He was just a kid at that time.

90
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,300
Facing so many bad guys,

91
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,700
he couldn't resist at all.

92
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:51,940
He was just selfish.

93
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,020
If I were him, I wouldn't have run away.

94
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,260
Do you think
everyone is as brave as you are

95
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,540
and has the guts
to stand up to the whole world?

96
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,940
If you were him at that time,

97
00:05:59,260 --> 00:05:59,820
would you run?

98
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,980
I guess I would.

99
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,020
I was just a kid, what could I do?

100
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,620
Is the ship ready?

101
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,060
OK.

102
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,100
Brats!

103
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,380
Freeze!

104
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,460
My home is right ahead.

105
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,340
When we arrive home,

106
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,980
he won't run after us.

107
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,620
Suqing.

108
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,700
Suqing.

109
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,100
Suqing.

110
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,420
Mom!

111
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:44,820
Stop running!

112
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,420
Suqing.

113
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,620
Mom!

114
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,100
Mom!

115
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,020
Stop running!

116
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:21,180
Help me!

117
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,900
Freeze!

118
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,260
Stop running!

119
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,740
Are you going to expose him?

120
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:53,980
It's good to keep our current status.

121
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,420
I think you are getting serious
about the fake relationship.

122
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,540
You didn't fall in love with him,
did you?

123
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,580
I mean...

124
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,980
He feels guilty towards me,

125
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:05,820
so he will agree with whatever I say.

126
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,420
Therefore, I'm more likely

127
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,780
to infiltrate through the Jueshi Group.

128
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,860
You really fell into his trap, I think.
