00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:14,740
See?

3
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,620
Wait!

4
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,260
I'll do it for you.

5
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,100
Move it outside.

6
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:23,900
Take a seat.

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:24,700
Have a rest,

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:26,540
please.

9
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:28,220
OK.

10
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:56,820
Hey.

11
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,780
You don't think
you can start to enjoy life

12
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:01,940
after marrying Ye Zhongjue, do you?

13
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:03,900
Let me tell you.

14
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,020
You'll never enjoy anything

15
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,100
as long as Jian Jie is here.

16
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,820
Can you please go back to the press?

17
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,700
Nobody needs you here.

18
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,740
I don't have any conflict with Ms. Jian.

19
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,180
You think you don't,

20
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,140
but she has a conflict with you.

21
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,660
Do you know their relationship before?

22
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,340
They used to be together.

23
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,900
For years!

24
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:34,620
Hmph.

=Trick in Love=

26
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:40,940
I'm really sorry

27
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,700
(Adapted from the novel)
for my bad attitude earlier.

28
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,540
("Mr. Intrigue's Love Game" by Yun Qi Mo Li)
Have some coffee.

29
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,780
Is it at an appropriate temperature?

30
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,140
Yes.

31
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:53,300
Okay.

32
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:54,380
Sit.

33
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,500
Sure.

(Expenses from September to December 2007)

36
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,420
Her job was to compile
the financial statement for a quarter,

37
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,820
but she checked accounts
from 15 years ago.

38
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,420
Mo Suqing,

39
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,180
what on earth do you want?

40
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,175
(The password is incorrect,
please try again)

41
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,580
(I mean no harm to you.)

42
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,100
(The password for this door
is the date of your birthday.)

47
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,580
(Isn't he Ye Zhongjue's father?)

48

(If the one who paid
to close the car accident case)

49
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,420
(is Ye Xueli,)

50
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,100
(what is Bai Yue to him?)

51
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,220
Ye Zhongjue,

52
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,300
I don't care how Mo Suqing tempted you,

53
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,500
but you are not at home now.

54
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,060
Aren't you going too far?

55
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:16,860
What's wrong?

56
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,380
You know what a personal seal is.

57
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,580
It's not her doll!

58
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:22,940
You're making a fuss.

59
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,100
What will they think of you
in the company?

60
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,140
I don't care what they think.

61
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:35,940
What about your work?

62
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,660
Don't you care about your work?

63
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,060
How many confidential documents

64
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,900
does your secretary
have access to every day?

65
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:41,900
You can't just give it

66
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,220
to an outsider!

67
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,020
She is my wife.

68
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,020
She's also Mo Zhenfeng's daughter!

69
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,700
What is the relationship
between Mo Zhenfeng and Gu Jiannan?

70
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:51,980
Why are you so sure

71
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,900
that it was not a trap

72
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,140
they set at the banquet for you?

73
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:56,780
I believe her.

74
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,500
You are totally insane!

75
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:12,025
(President Office)

76
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,500
Gastric spasm again?

77
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,060
You have to take care of yourself

78
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,180
so that you're able to
get Jueshi Group back.

79
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:26,660
Where's your pill?

80
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,060
Over there.

81
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:54,860
It hurts seriously.

82
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,700
I'm here to deliver the documents.

83
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,660
Sorry to bother you.

84
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,780
Enjoy your moment.

85
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,340
He has a weak stomach.

86
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,100
You are his secretary.

87
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,380
Aren't you supposed to look after him?

88
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:16,940
Fine.

89
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,220
I'll look after him.

90
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,020
Please leave.

91
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,340
Mo Suqing,

92
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,300
what on earth are you planning?

93
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,300
And what do you want
by joining the Jueshi Group?

94
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,140
To stay with my husband.

95
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,380
You can stay with him at your home,
is that not enough for you?

96
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,220
Is it necessary to join Jueshi Group?

97
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,180
I have to

98
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,100
since I want to stay with him
at every moment.

99
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,740
You said yes to his proposal.

100
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,660
Why don't you hold the wedding?

101
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,020
Why do you tell her everything?

102
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,740
Enough.

103
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,300
Whether we have a wedding or not
is up to us.

104
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,660
The wedding is just a worldly formality.

105
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,700
What does it have to do with you?

106
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,500
A worldly formality?

107
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,340
You obviously have an ulterior motive!

108
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,180
You are using him!

109
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:04,820
I am not!

110
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,380
Quiet down, please.

111
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,180
Quiet!
