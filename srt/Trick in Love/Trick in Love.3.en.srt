(My Door Will Always Open for You)

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:13,020
Wait.

3
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:44,820
Where's my ID card?

4
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,100
ID card?

5
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,460
Ah, wait a moment.

6
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,060
I remember I put it here.

7
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,140
Wait, I think I put it...

8
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:05,500
I remembered it now.

9
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,380
I forgot to bring it with me

10
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,540
when I left home this morning.

11
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,540
You left it at home?

12
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:10,260
Yeah.

13
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,980
Do you want me to go home with you?

14
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,180
Do I look like
that I can be easily fooled?

15
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:18,740
Definitely not.

16
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,340
I left it at home, I promise.

Alright. I'll believe you one more time.

20
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,180
Let's go.

21
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:25,940
Okay.

22
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:26,660
Wait.

23
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:27,460
I'll drive.

24
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,900
Your car is

25
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,060
too shabby.

26
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:00,740
With my condition,

27
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:01,980

Water. Thanks.

41
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,780
What do you do?

42
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,620
I...

43
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,900
I am...

44
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,540
an electrician.

45
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,260
I thought you were an artist.

46
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,020
This is my friend's studio.

47
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,500
I just resigned

48
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,140
and don't have a job,

49
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,100
so he let me stay here for now.

50
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,300
(Why does he conceal his real identity?)

51
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,820
Are you an electrician all the time?

52
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,900
To be precise, I'm not one currently.

53
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,020
I didn't really enjoy my last job.

54
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:21,860
That's why I quit.

55
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:24,580
By the way,

56
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,260
I majored in electric engineering
at university.

57
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,620
I'd like to find a job in this field.

58
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,820
(Did he lose all the money)

59
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,900
(in the family feud ?)

60
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,220
Then do you plan

61
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,340
to work as an electrician forever?

62
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,060
One can make a living
with their professional skills.

63
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,780
And I don't have to socialize
with others.

64
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,340
It's good to live
a peaceful and stable life.

65
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:42,460
(Oh, no.)

66
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,700
(He must be kicked out
after failing the family feud.)

67
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:46,740
Where's my ID card?

68
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:47,860
Give it to me then.

69
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:52,860
Oh, the ID card.

70
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:53,820
Ah.

71
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,460
I forgot about it again.

72
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,220
I'll look for it.

73
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:04,650
(ID card)

74
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,660
A nice film will be released tonight.

75
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,220
Would you like to watch it?

76
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,340
I've had an appointment.

77
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,420
Give me the ID card.

78
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,500
Thank you.

79
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,020
You said you didn't like
staying in your family, didn't you?

80
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,060
My door will always open for you.

81
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,420
You can stay however long you want.

82
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,820
It's not your business

83
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,220
whether I like my family or not.

84
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,260
You have no right

85
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,220
to judge my life.

86
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:38,860
I didn't mean it.

87
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,140
What are you doing?

88
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,100
Are you going to play hardball?

89
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,500
What I said was a little reckless.

90
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,820
What I wanted to say

91
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:45,940
was that I love you truly.

92
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:46,860
I want to

93
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,140
take responsibility for you.

94
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,620
But I don't need you to do that.

95
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,220
A person like you

96
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:52,820
simply wants

97
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,380
to get a free girlfriend
to live with you.

98
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:55,660
Hey.

99
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,700
I just want a chance to look after you.

100
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,620
I never thought
of doing anything bad to you.

101
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,260
Please don't misunderstand me.

102
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,620
The password to this door
is your birthday.

103
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,140
If you don't like me staying here,

104
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,340
I can move out.

105
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,820
I won't be in your way.

106
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,380
When you said taking responsibility
for me,

107
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,260
you meant to let me stay in this house?

108
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,900
Do you get to spend money as you wish?

109
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,140
I don't have much money.

110
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,020
And I just lost my job.

111
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,580
But my friend said

112
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,100
you can stay here however long you want.

113
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,340
We have everything inside.

114
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,620
You can paint

115
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,740
or play video games as you like.

116
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,340
The railway station
is only five minutes away.

117
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,660
And it only takes 15 minutes
to get to your company.

118
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:46,500
It's convenient.

119
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,020
How do you know where I work?

120
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,100
You were drunk that night

121
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:04,820
and you said that yourself.

122
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,420
Oh.

123
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,100
Just stay here for a few days.

124
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,740
You can move out

125
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,620
when you find a place
near your company.

126
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,020
Well.

127
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:14,540
So...

128
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,180
If I stay here,

129
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:17,620
where will you live?

130
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:19,940
It's okay.

131
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:20,940
Don't worry about me.

132
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,620
I can find a basement in the suburbs.

133
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:24,780
One with good ventilation.

134
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,380
Going downtown from there
only takes two hours.

135
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,260
Two hours?

136
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:28,660
Or

137
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,500
you can use the bed
and I'll sleep on the sofa.

138
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,380
We can make do for a few days.

139
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:35,620
Alright.

140
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,060
I'll stay here temporarily.

141
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,940
When I manage to rent a place,
I'll move.

142
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,020
Don't bear any ulterior intentions.

143
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:43,820
No problem.

144
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:44,580
Rest assured.

145
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,860
Please move my luggage inside for me.

146
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:49,620
Okay.

147
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,580
(Why would a president
end up to this?)

148
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,540
(A week ago)

149
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,140
Mr. Gu.

150
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,620
What about the matter
I discussed with you a while back?

151
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,780
I told you, no rush.

152
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,620
No rush.

153
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,460
Which of these two words
that you don't understand?

154
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,340
Why do you force me
to marry your daughter now?

155
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,820
It can wait.

156
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,020
I'm just bringing it up

157
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,820
by the way.

158
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,740
Suqing is no longer young.

159
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,620
What's more, your cousin,

160
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:26,860
Ye Zhongjue,

161
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,420
will be back from abroad soon.

162
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,460
If anything happens

163
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,300
inside the group,

164
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,100
we can cope with it well

165
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,820
after we form the marital bond.

166
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,420
Marital bond?

167
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,500
She wouldn't even let me kiss her
after all this time.

168
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,500
Tsk.

169
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,140
What?

170
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,540
You're going to pick up
the heir of Jueshi Group?

171
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,460
Are you serious?

172
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:53,420
Yeah.

173
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,820
Ye Zhongjue is Gu Jiannan's cousin,

174
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,900
and the real heir of Jueshi Group.

175
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,420
As long as I get him,

176
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,420
I might be able to join the group

177
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,940
and get the things I want,

178
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,140
(so I can make them pay)

179
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:05,900
