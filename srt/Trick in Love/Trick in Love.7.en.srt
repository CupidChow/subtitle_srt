00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:07,220
=Episode 7=
(Testing with an Ulterior Motive)

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:08,980
I assisted your return

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,500
so you can gain the control
of Jueshi Group again,

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,980
not for you to be in a relationship.

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,580
Do you think Gu Jiannan would help you

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,460
just because you gave him some benefits?

7
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:17,540
So naive.

8
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:18,860
I did that

9
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,140
out of impulse.

10
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,060
What's your relationship with that girl?

11
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,020
Nothing.

12
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:25,060
We met in a bar.

13
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:29,940
Zhongjue,

14
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,660
Bai Yue has more than one man
than Gu Jiannan,

15
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:34,540
but you only have me.

16
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,100
I hope you can be honest with me
about everything.

17
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:51,620
Zhongjue,

18
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,140
you crossed the line this time.

19
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,260
You can't do this anymore.

20
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,060
She asked you
to keep an eye on me, didn't she?

21
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,500
The company's situation is complicated.

22
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,020
She's worried about you.

23
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,740
I thought you were my best friend.

24
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,300
Who is this?

25
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:09,860
(It has nothing to do with me.)

26
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:10,660
(She made me.)

27
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:11,300
What are they doing?

28
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,340
This is Mr. Gu!

29
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,460
I didn't know Mr. Gu was into this.

30
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:19,780
=Trick in Love=

31
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:20,420
Back to work.

32
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:24,580
(Adapted from the novel "Mr. Intrigue's
Love Game" by Yun Qi Mo Li)

33
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,140
Ha ha.

34
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:29,940
Mr. Gu,

35
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:31,660
about the public crisis

36
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,220
brought to the company by this news,

37
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,500
do you have anything to say?

38
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,260
Sorry

39
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:37,620
that you see this.

40
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,340
I will ask my lawyer

41
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,460
to deal with such untrue messages soon.

42
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,020
I have nothing to say.

43
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,780
The truth is the truth.

44
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:46,860
Mr. Gu,

45
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,380
you should say something
when it is needed.

46
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,900
Otherwise, how can you prove
you are innocent?

47
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,180
It is a fake video.

48
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,020
The person in the video is not me.

49
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:00,620
Ms. Jian,

50
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,180
why do you have to be so aggressive?

51
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,020
Think about the technology now.

52
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,700
Photoshop and face-swapping

53
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,940
can make things look almost real.

54
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,460
Mr. Gu is in a high position.

55
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,260
It's understandable
that someone wants to set him up.

56
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,220
That's right.

57
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,300
Mr. Gu and his girlfriend
are a loving couple.

58
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,060
How could he cheat on her?

59
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,020
The video must be fake.

60
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,020
Since all of you think
it is a fake video,

61
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,140
let's get a professional
to make an assessment.

62
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,140
Well,

63
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,860
I can't trust
the professional you introduce.

64
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,860
What if they are on your side?

65
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:34,660
How about this?

66
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,300
I will talk to my girlfriend.

67
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:37,260
Humph.

68
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,420
I will bring her to the business party

69
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,420
a few days later

70
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,820
to meet everyone.

71
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,660
That can certainly prove

72
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,340
I am not a cheater.

73
00:02:50,575 --> 00:02:52,225
(Conference Room)

74
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:54,660
Hi, Ms. Jian.

75
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,540
Why didn't you join
the board meeting?

76
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,540
I was sorting out some documents.

77
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:04,980
You didn't see

78
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,660
Gu Jiannan's crafty face just now.

79
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,540
I was almost furious.

80
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,100
He will lose his cool soon.

81
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,940
These are all the contracts of the project

82
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,980
that he was in charge of these years,

83
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,460
The statements from clients.

84
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,460
And the evidence of his self-dealing.

85
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,740
All the important figures will attend

86
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,660
the business party a few days later.

87
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:19,660
Even Bai Yue

88
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,140
won't be able to save him this time.

89
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,460
If senior Mr. Ye could see
how capable you are,

90
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,100
he would rest in peace.

91
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:33,740
Jian Jie.

92
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:34,460
Yes?

93
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,660
About the engagement
my dad made for us...

94
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,060
You mean the child marriage?

95
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,100
Who believes in that in this era?

96
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,620
You are free to love anyone.

97
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:49,860
I am okay with that.

98
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,580
We mustn't make any mistake tomorrow.

99
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,420
Getting rid of Gu Jiannan

100
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:57,980
will bring us closer to Bai Yue.

101
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:19,660
Suqing,

102
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:20,620
here you are.

103
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,140
How are you doing recently?

104
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,100
Cut to the chase.

105
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,060
What's the problem?

106
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,100
Well,

107
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,300
Gu Jiannan

108
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,660
is canceling all the business

109
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,140
between us.

110
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,660
If that happens,

111
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,620
I will be completely broke.

112
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:34,420
Suqing,

113
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,340
we are father and daughter.

114
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,100
You have to help me out.

115
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,900
Suqing, I am begging you.

116
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,020
I am kneeling before you.

117
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,420
What are you doing?

118
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,420
People would think I am abusing you.

119
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:45,820
You...

120
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:46,660
If you don't help me,

121
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,980
it's the same as abuse.

122
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,540
What did I even do?

123
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,460
Get on your feet.

124
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:52,700
Only after

125
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:53,820
you promise you.

126
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,260
Get up!

127
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:55,940
What's going on?

128
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,100
What's going on?

129
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,020
Haven't you seen

130
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,380
a father kneeling before his daughter?

131
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,460
A father kneeling before his daughter?

132
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,500
How can you do this?

133
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,380
Help your father up.

134
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,020
That's right.

135
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,660
Hey, get up now.

136
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:07,820
I will get up

137
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,660
only after you say yes.

138
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:08,940
Hurry.

139
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:09,740
Alright, alright.

140
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,500
I promise you.

141
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,380
Get up now.

142
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,980
What kind of daughter you are?

143
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:13,780
I never heard of it.

144
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,420
Just go.

145
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,500
A bunch of busybodies.

146
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,420
The show is over.

147
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,060
We were helping you

148
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:17,860
and you chased us away.

149
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:18,740
How could you?

150
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,180
Evil old man.

151
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:19,580
Suqing,

152
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,980
you agree to help me?

153
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,140
Say it.

154
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,500
What do you want me to do?

155
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:25,660
You are going to

156
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,100
testify for Gu Jiannan

157
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,220
and your sister

158
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:28,940
tomorrow.

159
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,220
All you need to say

160
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,580
is that the video of them

161
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:34,700
is fake.

162
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,460
It's not true.

163
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,540
It is impossible
that they would do it.

164
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,020
Alright?

165
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,140
Why should I?

166
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:40,300
I won't do it.

167
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:41,500
Wait,

168
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,460
you just promised me!

169
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:43,980
What?

170
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,500
Now you just regret it?

171
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:46,740
You are not going, huh?

172
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:47,300
Okay.

173
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,500
Then today,

174
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,940
I'm going to jump off the bridge

175
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:50,860
and kill myself!

176
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,180
Do it if you dare.

177
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,460
Suqing,

178
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,460
I failed you.

179
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,140
I failed your mother.

180
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,540
If there is another life,

181
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,580
I will do my best to compensate you.

182
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,180
I will leave first.

183
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,420
What are you doing?

184
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,460
Are you crazy?

185
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:13,900
Come down.

186
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:14,940
Down!

187
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,140
Suqing,

188
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,460
I've lost your mother

189
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,220
and I'm losing you.

190
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,980
If I have no more money,

191
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,420
I will have nothing left.

192
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,740
(Terrible acting.)

193
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,300
(Alright.)

194
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,380
(If this is what you ask for.)

195
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,540
I got you
some anti-inflammatory ointment.

196
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,580
I will apply it for you.

197
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,820
Is your girlfriend pretty?

198
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,140
I don't have a girlfriend.

199
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,700
The HR the other day

200
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,580
was talking about
introducing someone to you.

201
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,140
You are the only one in my eyes.

202
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,340
Does it still hurt?

203
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:58,500
Yes.

204
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,260
This ointment works really well.

205
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,780
It will get well soon.

206
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,020
Do you use it a lot?

207
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:06,780
Yes.

208
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,740
I used to get bullied when I was a kid.

209
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:10,380
It helped me a lot.

210
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,300
You? Got bullied?

211
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,460
Do you ever tell the truth?

212
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,460
What did I do wrong?

213
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:16,580
Nothing.

214
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,420
What's your plan tomorrow?

215
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:23,780
Tomorrow?

216
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,140
I'll go to work.

217
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:27,220
And you?

218
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,060
Go to work.
