(A Thought-out Impulse)

2
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:17,980
Where did you get so many props?

3
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:18,780
Naughty boy.

4
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:21,140
Didn't you buy them?

5
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,140
Which room?

6
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,460
Come on.

7
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:51,260
Here.

8
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:53,460
This way.

9
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:55,660
What does it look like?

10
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:56,780
Is it like what you described?

11
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:57,660
Ah!

12
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,380
Mo Sulian!

13
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,500
Why are you in the room
for my birthday party?

14
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:06,740
How could you

15
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,620
hook up with your sister's boyfriend?

16
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,980
You shameless couple!

17
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:11,580
It has nothing to do with me!

18
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:12,660
She forced me!

19
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,020
Get out!

20
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,220
=Trick in Love=

21
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,100
Everyone, please leave the room.

22
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,540
(Adapted from the novel)
This is a family matter.

23
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:19,900
("Mr. Intrigue's Love Game" Yun Qi Mo Li)
I'd like to talk to her in private.

24
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,420
Let's go.

25
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,020
Suqing is such a poor girl.

26
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,420
Her boyfriend cheated on her
with her own sister.

27
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:28,940
Yeah.

28
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,860
They're biological sisters.
Why did it turn out like this?

29
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:32,860
Biological sisters?

30
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,220
That's the daughter of her stepmother.

31
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,460
She's been mean to Suqing
since they were young.

32
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,220
She even kicked her out of the house.

33
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,860
But Sulian told us

34
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,460
Suqing always picked on her.

35
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,380
If you ask me,

36
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,380
we were all tricked by Mo Sulian.

37
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,260
Exactly.

38
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,420
We shouldn't believe
a single word of hers from now on.

39
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,500
Yes.

40
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,380
Didn't I tell you

41
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,780
that you got all your annoying quirks

42
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,420
because you haven't gotten
a taste of reality?

43
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:54,460
So?

44
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,700
Has this lesson
left a deep impression on you?

45
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,140
So this is another scheme of yours!

46
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,460
You sure are scheming!

47
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:03,980
Yes, I'm scheming.

48
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,740
But you're evil.

49
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,860
You pick on me at home

50
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,820
and you want to do the same
in the office.

51
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,340
Do you really think I'm a pushover?

52
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,540
Mo Suqing! I won't let you off!

53
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,420
Let go!

54
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,660
Let go!

55
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,260
Shut up!

56
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:56,420
What's wrong?

57
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,060
Did you have a fight with someone?

58
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,300
Who did this?

59
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:03,900
Tell me!

60
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,820
I'm fine.

61
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,100
Is it Gu...

62
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,100
Are you doing this on purpose?

63
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,500
What am I doing?

64
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,260
I just tripped over the stairs

65
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,460
and hurt my face.

66
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,220
Why are you so upset?

67
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,220
Don't spoil the fridge.
We'll have to pay for it then.

68
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,420
Why are you dodging?

69
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,700
Why are you being so mean?

70
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,100
I just want to ice your injury!

71
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:05,700
I'll do it myself.

72
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,860
Don't pretend to be nice.

73
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,420
I'm pretending?

74
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,260
I'll take you to the hospital.

75
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,140
It's nothing serious.
No need to go to the hospital.

76
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:14,860
It's swollen!

77
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,260
It's not.

78
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,860
It's just a bruise.

79
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,700
What stupid fridge is this?
We don't even have ice.

80
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,220
It's all warm already.

81
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,020
Run it under cold water, please.

82
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:46,300
I'll do it.

83
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:53,820
Don't go to work anymore.

84
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,060
Rest at home.

85
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,220
Are you going to provide for me?

86
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:58,700
I'll provide for you.

87
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,540
Even if you can do it now,

88
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,780
can you do it forever?

89
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:08,580
You hesitated.

90
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,060
You men are all like this.

91
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,220
You try so hard to woo us at first,

92
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,460
but once you get us, you kick us away.

93
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:17,860
You don't trust me, do you?

94
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:20,780
You are not like that?

95
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,420
I'm different from other men.

96
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:24,860
How are you different?

97
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,940
You're all sanctimonious

98
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:27,940
and full of lies.

99
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,100
I'm tired.

100
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,060
I'm going to shower and sleep.

101
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:43,060
Mr. Ye,

102
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,460
why did you call me at this hour?

103
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,300
(CEO's Office)

104
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,060
I could have told everyone
about you modifying the sales numbers

105
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,140
during the board meeting.

106
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,140
Do you know why I didn't?

107
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,780
Mr. Ye, you're smart.

108
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,060
Annoying Ms. Bai

109
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,220
won't benefit you at all.

110
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,140
You're so willing

111
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,540
to be Bai Yue's lackey?

112
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,020
Alas.

113
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,660
I didn't expect you
to resort to the lousy method

114
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,980
of sowing discord.

115
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,100
I'll make a deal with you.

116
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,500
You should have said so earlier.

117
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:11,620
What deal?

118
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,660
I'll give you 30%

119
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,260
of my shares.

120
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,100
This way,

121
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,060
you won't have to
live in Bai Yue's shadow.

122
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,460
Did I hear you correctly?

123
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,060
Mr. Ye, what happened to you today?

124
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,100
Why are you not yourself?

125
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,260
Take it that I'm drunk, then.

126
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,140
But this

127
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,700
is your only chance.

128
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,140
Okay.

129
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:47,740
I'll do it.

130
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,620
What do you want in return?

131
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,140
I want you to leave Mo...

132
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,940
How can you leave me out
when it comes to the group's shares?

133
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,460
Ms. Jian.

134
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,420
It's so happening.

135
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,860
What is the meaning of this?

136
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,740
I've already recorded
both of you engaging in

137
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,300
clandestine equity transactions.

138
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,660
I wonder what the other shareholders
will think.

139
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:10,060
Well, he offered the deal.

140
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,180
Mr. Ye might have been bluffing,

141
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,020
but you said yes.

142
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,260
Making it a real deal.

143
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,020
Okay.

144
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,580
Very well.

145
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,060
Ye Zhongjue,

146
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,860
you set up a trap for me, huh?

147
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,180
Just you wait.

148
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,580
Ye Zhongjue,

149
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,820
all this for a woman?

150
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,380
Huh?

151
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,460
I'm so disappointed in you!
