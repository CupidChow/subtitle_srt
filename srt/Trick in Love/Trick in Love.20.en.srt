(Cunning Trick, Genuine Love)

2
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:22,740
Excuse me, everybody.

3
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,020
I have no right to attend
the shareholders' meeting,

4
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:26,100
but my husband's name

5
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,380
is at stake here.

6
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:28,420
So pardon my intrusion.

7
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:31,900
Mr. Gu, you're worthy

8
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,180
of Ms. Bai's right hand.

9
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,300
Even her ex-husband Mo Zhenfeng

10
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,580
couldn't escape unscathed

11
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,900
from the counterfeit product scandal,

12
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,740
and yet you only got
a tiny slap on the wrist.

13
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,340
This time, you were given this task

14
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,140
and easily found out

15
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,060
that Mr. Ye was the true one
behind the counterfeiting.

16
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:49,980
No wonder

17
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,140
Ms. Bai promoted you to the acting CEO.

18
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,100
Humph.

19
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,060
I don't care what you mean by that.

20
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:58,540
But the evidence

21
00:00:59,060 --> 00:00:59,980
is right here.

22
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,500
It is also true

23
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,820
that Ye Zhongjue has frequented

24
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:04,780
the tea factory over the years.

25
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,220
What does it show?

26
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,260
What does it show?

27
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,660
Our group has so many businesses.

28
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,700
=Trick in Love=
That factory is insignificant.

29
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,140
(Adapted from the novel)

30
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,500
("Mr. Intrigue's Love Game" by Yun Qi Mo Li)
It's just an abandoned warehouse.

31
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,740
Why would our CEO

32
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:18,740
go there?

33
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:20,900
Well.

34
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,900
Any skeletons in the closet?

35
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,820
It's a secret

36
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,300
between my wife and me.

37
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:29,980
But now that it's happened,

38
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,220
it won't hurt to tell you.

39
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,660
My frequent visits
to the tea factory these years

40
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,500
weren't for any warehouse business,

41
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,420
but to find a piece of land,

42
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:39,820
to fulfill

43
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,300
my mother-in-law's dying wish.

44
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,620
Now the tea farm has been built.

45
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,220
You are welcome to come over anytime

46
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,540
if you are free.

47
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,900
We aren't mere bystanders.

48
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,780
A simple declaration

49
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,540
of affection won't erase our doubts.

50
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:00,820
Well.

51
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,940
You've explained your visits
to the factory,

52
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,700
but how will you explain

53
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,500
the signature and seal?

54
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:07,740
Fake.

55
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,780
Words alone

56
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,220
are not enough.

57
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,220
Is there any proof?

58
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,380
There's no difference.

59
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,460
Please look

60
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,060
at the signatures on the last page.

61
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,620
One dot is missing from the signature

62
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,940
of the contract given by Ms. Bai.

63
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:58,900
(Ye Zhonglue)

64
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,100
For the seal...

65
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,420
You're just out of luck.

66
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,860
Last month, I went to Mr. Ye's office

67
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,900
and accidentally made
a small nick in his seal.

68
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,620
I'm sorry.

69
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,300
I chipped your seal.

70
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,140
So after September,

71
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,340
all the stamps he made

72
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,060
had an unnoticeable nick in them.

73
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,420
And so does the one

74
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:37,900
on your contract.

75
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:42,860
Ms. Bai,

76
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,420
the contract should be signed
last year, right?

77
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,540
Did you

78
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,020
forge the contract?

79
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,500
You...

80
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,940
You're slandering me!

81
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:55,940
Ms. Bai,

82
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,540
your acts of contract forgery,

83
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,660
patent theft

84
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,580
and abuse of authority.

85
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:00,900
The court will tackle them.

86
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,140
Now that it's all out,

87
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,940
you

88
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,500
must have made up your mind.

89
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,140
If you want to stay in the group,

90
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,620
you'll remain
esteemed senior executives.

91
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,940
If you decide to leave,

92
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,900
we will buy your shares

93
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,700
at an above-market price.

94
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:38,660
For my resignation?

95
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,340
I've signed it in advance.

96
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,500
Given the shares you secretly acquired

97
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,980
and the 15% you already have,

98
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,380
the position of CEO is now yours.

99
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,900
You clearly knew
I was transferring shares,

100
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,460
but you did nothing.

101
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,140
Our goals are different.

102
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,100
You like ruling the roost
in the commercial arena

103
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,980
while I only wish to spend

104
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,500
every serene day

105
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,020
with the one I love.

106
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:08,700
If that's the case,

107
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,180
may we both get what we want.

108
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:45,820
Close call.

109
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,700
That man is really scheming.

110
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,380
It's finally solved.

111
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,900
He's truly a bad lot

112
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,020
and never brings me anything good.

113
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,980
He even set a trap,

114
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,300
waiting for me to fall into it.

115
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,780
It's still your cleverness.

116
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,060
You're truly my lucky star.

117
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,420
Bai Yue finally fell.

118
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:15,980
With me around,

119
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,900
