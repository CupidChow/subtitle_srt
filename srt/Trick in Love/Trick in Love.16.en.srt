00:00:04,309 --> 00:00:07,220
(Is It Harder to Fool Oneself
or Fool Others?)

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,500
It's the video from the bar that day.

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:10,300
Want to see it?

5
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:53,860
Suqing.

6
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:54,780
You must be tired.

7
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:56,340
You should go home.

8
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,300
I'll take care of this.

9
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:10,510
=Trick in Love=

10
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,980
(Adapted from the novel
"Mr. Intrigue's Love Game" by Yun Qi Mo Li)

11
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,020
You planned the matter
with the factory, didn't you?

12
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,900
2,000 pieces of goods
were indeed shipped

13
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,980
from the factory that day.

14
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,460
I took one out

15
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,500
to test her and see

16
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,820
if she would cover up for Mo Zhenfeng.

17
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,260
Don't pick on her like that again.

18
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,500
Ye Zhongjue.

19
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,220
She approached you
with a hidden agenda!

20
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,700
She planned everything!
She did it on purpose!

21
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:36,700
She has her reasons.

22
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:37,860
I trust her.

23
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,340
Sweetheart.

24
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:02,860
What do you want?

25
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,460
I'm so useless.

26
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:06,980
I'm here to ask you for a favor again.

27
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,100
Can you

28
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,420
tell Mr. Ye to drop

29
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,620
the charges against me

30
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,700
and renounce the compensation?

31
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,820
If you hadn't married Bai Yue,

32
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,100
things wouldn't have ended up like this.

33
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:20,700
Do you regret it?

34
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:22,740
(Suqing.)

35
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:23,980
(Things have come to this,)

36
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,860
(so what if I regret it now?)

37
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,540
(As a father,)

38
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,940
(I've had my own difficulties too.)

39
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,820
(You suffered a lot because of me.)

40
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:35,780
(I do admit that.)

41
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,340
But you have married Ye Zhongjue now.

42
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,740
As your father,

43
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,580
I'm so relieved.

44
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,580
(Why did I marry Ye Zhongjue?)

45
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,020
(Don't you know?)

46
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,780
(All I needed was a tool)

47
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,300
to bring down Bai Yue.

48
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,420
As long as he's the CEO of Jueshi Group,

49
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,420
it doesn't matter who it is.

50
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:57,780
(I see.)

51
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,100
No wonder you were eager to get dirt

52
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,700
on me and Mr. Gu

53
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,820
the moment you joined the company.

54
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,420
At first,

55
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,140
I thought you were helping Ye Zhongjue.

56
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,260
To think you were just helping yourself.

57
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,420
Do you love him?

58
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,460
I don't need love in my life.

59
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,340
Do you still believe your judgment?

60
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:33,940
Eavesdropping.

61
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,100
Candid camera.

62
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:36,780
I never expected you

63
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,900
to be such a scheming person.

64
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,500
If I wasn't,
you couldn't have come back.

65
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,540
Your father wouldn't have let me
become a shareholder.

66
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,300
He wants you
to help Jueshi Group strive.

67
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,020
Do you know how much I've sacrificed?

68
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:52,980
Where are you going?

69
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,180
Ye Zhongjue.

70
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,140
Ye Zhongjue!

71
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,980
Ms. Jian, you finally came.

72
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,100
Thank you.

73
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,540
I did what you asked me to.

74
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,380
Can I have the money?

75
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:12,700
Let's go.

76
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,540
Take care!

77
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,700
Today, I heard

78
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:41,940
an interesting question.

79
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,700
Want to take a guess?

80
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,060
Sure.

81
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,780
Which one is harder?
To fool yourself

82
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,340
or to fool others?

83
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,620
What do you think?

84
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,500
It's easy to fool others.

85
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,460
But fooling yourself

86
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,180
is very hard.

87
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,740
That would be my answer too.

88
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,100
Are we going to keep

89
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,300
lying to each other?

90
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:15,820
At the bar that night,

91
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,100
you were not drunk, were you?

92
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,220
And you?

93
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,980
Did you really just happen to be there?

94
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,940
After we got married,

95
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,300
I never lied to you again.

96
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,100
What's the use?

97
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,940
Why didn't you help me
over ten years ago?

98
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,780
It's too late now.

99
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,700
If I tell you

100
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,540
that I did that for you,

101
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,100
will you believe me?

102
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,820
For me?

103
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,340
Ye Zhongjue, you are such a hypocrite.

104
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,340
When I needed you the most,

105
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,540
you abandoned me and left.

106
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,100
Now, you are just...

107
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,420
a tool for me in my plan for revenge.

108
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,780
So to you,

109
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,420
everything I do

110
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,620
is meaningless?

111
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,340
Things have come to this,

112
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,500
I have nothing else to say.

113
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,580
I used you.

114
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,900
If you can't get over it,

115
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,740
let's get a divorce.

116
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,500
But I will stay in Jueshi Group

117
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,140
no matter what.

118
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,700
I will move out tomorrow.

119
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,060
This...

120
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:52,740
You can have it back.

121
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,180
(Why don't you understand?)

122
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,260
(I can forgive you for using me.)

123
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,260
(But I can't accept)

124
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,140
(that you don't love me.)

125
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,900
(Mom, if you were still here,)

126
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,500
(you'd want me
to save Mo Zhenfeng too, right?)

127
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,100
You're one of the best lawyers
in the city.

128
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,860
Even you don't have confidence
in this lawsuit?

129
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,020
Suqing.

130
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,660
I do want to help you.

131
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,020
But this case is too tricky.

132
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,300
The reputation
of Jueshi Group's legal team

133
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,420
is well-earned.

134
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,580
I'm just not a match for them.

135
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,780
Actually, with your relationship
with Mr. Ye,

136
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,820
if they can withdraw...

137
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,660
I'm in no position to tell him
to withdraw the lawsuit.

138
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:45,700
Please accept the case.

139
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,500
I beg you.

140
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:46,900
Sigh.

141
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,580
If I take on this case,

142
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,140
I will need more resources.

143
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,820
The cost will therefore be higher too.

144
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,860
Don't worry.

145
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,100
I'll figure something out.

146
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,900
As long as you agree to help,

147
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,860
you don't need to worry about the cost.

148
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,580
All right.

149
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,020
Okay, thank you.

150
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:06,900
(Oh, right.)

151
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,900
(My marriage certificate
is still in the drawer.)
