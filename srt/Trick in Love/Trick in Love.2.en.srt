(If It's Broken, Don't Fix It)

2
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,740
Say something!

3
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:24,900
Speak!

4
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:27,420
Still playing dumb, huh?

5
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:29,780
Speak!

6
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:32,260
You won't get to eat

7
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,220
until you say something.

8
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,100
The bad guy is gone.

9
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,180
I'm here to get you out.

10
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:57,780
Don't be afraid.

11
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:58,940
I'll protect you.

12
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,260
(This time,)

13
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,260
(I'll be protecting you.)

14
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:08,620
=Trick in Love=

15
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:12,400
(Adapted from the novel
"Mr. Intrigue's Love Game" by Yun Qi Mo Li)

16
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,380
Suqing.

17
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,260
Where were you last night?

18
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,180
You didn't come back
for the whole night.

19
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,380
You didn't pick up the calls,
nor did you reply to the messages.

20
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,980
Do you know for how long
Mr. Gu waited for you?

21
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,340
That's right.

22
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,580
You didn't come home the whole night.

23
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:26,460
If others hear about this,

24
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,820
people might think
girls from our Mo family

25
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,460
are all so dissolute.

26
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,460
I'm not like her at all.

27
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,700
You are being all sarcastic.

28
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:37,780
I do wonder

29
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,140
if you're in your right mind.

30
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,660
What an ungracious woman!

31
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,860
Ungracious as I might be,

32
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:43,620
I would never

33
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,500
have a filthy affair
with my brother-in-law.

34
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,260
You...

35
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,620
Don't you accuse me without evidence!

36
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,820
You want evidence, huh?

37
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,100
(Our Harmonious Family)

38
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,420
What...

39
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:03,660
You...

40
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,620
Mo Suqing.

41
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,460
I hate scheming women like you the most.

42
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,380
What can you prove with these photos?

43
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,260
Is there a problem
with wanting to be nice

44
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,420
to my sister-in-law?

45
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,220
Do you mean

46
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,460
being nice to her in bed?

47
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,980
Mo Suqing, that's enough.

48
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,180
As someone who works
in the media industry,

49
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,860
you sneaked photos of others

50
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,340
and distorted the truth.

51
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,300
Apologize to Mr. Gu and your sister now.

52
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:24,740
Humph.

53
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,180
(Want me to apologize?)

54
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,580
All right, Mr. Mo.

55
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,820
I don't think
we can have the meal today.

56
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,460
I'll leave now.

57
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,260
Mr. Gu.

58
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,900
Please stay. Calm down.

59
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,220
Don't stoop to her level.

60
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:45,860
The food is ready now.

61
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,060
Please enjoy the meal first.

62
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,060
You can have several days
to think about it.

63
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,260
Come to me when you've come around.

64
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,180
Jiannan.

65
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,580
Mr. Gu, wait.

66
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:03,860
Look at you.

67
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,540
Look at what you have done.

68
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,340
Don't you know how much

69
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,380
it means for us

70
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,020
to have a gold mine like Gu Jiannan

71
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,220
and Jueshi Group to rely on?

72
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:14,900
Don't you already

73
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,340
have a wife who is a member
of the board of directors

74
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,100
of Jueshi Group?

75
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,380
But why are you still feeling inferior

76
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,420
that you actually plan to sell
your daughter to win over Gu Jiannan?

77
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,020
Outrageous!

78
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,020
I ask you to marry him

79
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,260
for your own good.

80
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,220
Why are you glaring at me like this?

81
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,620
Did I say anything wrong?

82
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,020
Birds of a feather flock together.

83
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,740
Oh, really?

84
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,860
Mo Zhenfeng.

85
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,940
Did you see her attitude?

86
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,860
Seems like she does not
want to stay here anymore.

87
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,660
You are right.

88
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,140
I'll teach her a lesson now.

89
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:05,820
Mr. Ye.

90
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:06,980
The house is ready now.

91
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,820
Your clothes and car
are all ready as well.

92
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,660
Don't call me Mr. Ye in the office.

93
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,060
It sounds weird.

94
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,220
Did you nail it last night?

95
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,380
It's never that easy.

96
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,020
I told you. To pursue a girl,

97
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,740
you must spend every penny you have
to buy things to please her.

98
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,820
This is how you win a girl's heart.

99
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,020
She said

100
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,260
that she hates rich people.

101
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,700
So the clothes and the car...

102
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:32,900
No wonder.

103
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,740
You must have prepared those
for a certain reason.

104
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,340
By the way, Zhongjue,

105
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,380
the situation of the company
can be quite complicated.

106
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,540
You are new here.

107
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,420
I'll find the time to tell you about it.

108
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:42,540
No need.

109
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,540
I've already got my head around it.

110
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,580
Investigate Gu Jiannan for me

111
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,540
and get to know his clients.

112
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,220
Okay.

113
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,220
Rest assured.

114
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,980
Just leave Gu Jiannan to me.

115
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:56,660
No.

116
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,460
I'll deal with him personally.

117
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,100
But why?

118
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,660
No one can mistreat

119
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,300
my woman.

120
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,020
(In this life,)

121
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,860
(it's enough for me
to have you and your mother.)

122
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,020
(Even if we can't live
a luxurious life,)

123
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,020
(the three of us
will always be together.)

124
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:25,900
Mom.

125
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,940
All men are liars.

126
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,660
Make wiser choices

127
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,860
in your next life.

128
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,180
Never take their slick talk seriously.

129
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:37,620
Oh.

130
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,540
Your mother is long gone.

131
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,060
Yet you still put her photo
on your bedside.

132
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,460
You can also

133
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,740
put your mom's photo by your bed
if you like.

134
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,260
What makes you think you're so superior?

135
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,660
Jiannan has dumped you.

136
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,860
You are actually a loser,

137
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,700
but you are always

138
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,940
acting condescending.

139
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,580
I'll tell you the truth.

140
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,580
Jiannan and I

141
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,300
have been in love for a long time.

142
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,500
But whom can you blame it on?

143
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,780
You are not capable enough
to keep him with you.

144
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,740
You pushed him away,
so he came to someone else.

145
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,220
You are right.

146
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,580
But have you ever

147
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,380
thought about this?

148
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,820
How come I was always working overtime

149
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,020
when you guys were together?

150
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,620
What do you mean?

151
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,700
Make it clear.

152
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:23,540
From the day

153
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,260
you fell in love
with your so-called brother-in-law,

154
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,540
I no longer wanted him anymore.

155
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,260
Since we are sisters

156
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,660
and you like recycling such waste,

157
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,140
I might as well help you.

158
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,460
What a considerate sister I am!

159
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,140
Mo Suqing, you despicable woman!

160
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,980
Dang it.

161
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,100
If it's broken,

162
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,100
then don't fix it.

163
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:13,900
(He fell for it.)

164
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,540
Hey, what are you doing?

165
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,700
My car is over there.
I'll give you a ride.

166
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,300
Hold on.

167
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,140
How did you know I was here?

168
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:29,580
Were you following me?

169
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,300
No, I...

170
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,300
What?

171
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,100
We are even, you know?

172
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,100
I'm warning you, don't pester me again.

173
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,020
Don't get me wrong.

174
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:37,940
I'm here to return something.

175
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,100
Back then at the hotel,

176
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,260
you dropped your ID card.

177
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,860
Oh.

178
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,100
Give it to me then.

179
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:45,860
It's in my car.

180
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,820
Where are you going?
I'll give you a ride.

181
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,260
I don't think you can get a cab here.

182
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,100
What's wrong?

183
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,180
Why is there no one in the car?

184
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:08,740
Ah.

185
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,180
It's bad.

186
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:13,980
Move aside!

187
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,300
Are you okay?

188
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,220
Yes.

189
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,900
You were risking your own life
to save him, you know?

00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,900
Well, I have you.

191
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,700
It was perfect teamwork.

192
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,540
Sorry.

193
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,060
This is an old car.

194
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,460
And there are many problems with it.

195
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,060
Is this your car?

196
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:00,780
Yeah.

197
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,420
(How could the heir of the Jueshi Group
own such a car?)

198
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,300
Wipe off your sweat.

199
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:10,700
Thank you.

200
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:16,980
Wait.
