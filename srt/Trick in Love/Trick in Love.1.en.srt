(Faking It or Meaning It?)

2
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,260
(The same time every night,)

3
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,580
(he'd come here.)

4
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,140
(He'd sit at the bar counter)

5
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,380
(and order a drink,)

6
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,860
(as if he was waiting for something.)

7
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:28,660
(No one would believe)

8
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,660
(that this man who seems lonely)

9
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,940
(is the heir of Jueshi Group,)

10
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:34,340
(Ye Zhongjue.)

11
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,180
(Only by making him mine)

12
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,220
(can I break free
from the shackles of family.)

13
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,620
(The same time every night,)

14
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,260
(she'd come here.)

15
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,180
(Perhaps only alcohol)

16
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,700
(can help her forget
about her repressive life)

17
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,820
(for a moment.)

18
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,140
(Ten years ago,)

19
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:55,740
(I left her.)

20
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:56,980
(Now,)

21
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,340
(I'll make up for everything.)

22
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:07,620
Pretty girl.

23
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:09,860
Show me your smile.

24
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:10,460
Shush.

25
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,300
That's too much.
Don't get too dramatic.

26
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,020
Keep it down.

27
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:17,420
Hey.

28
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,220
Sit. Sit while you speak.

29
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,020
Hey, pretty girl.

30
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,500
Can I add you
as my friend on WeChat?

31
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:24,820
Wait.

32
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,100
Are you a professional actor?

33
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:27,580
Yeah.

34
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,500
It's just that
this is not the best role for me.

35
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,340
All right. Don't hit on me.

36
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,580
When I get out of the toilet

37
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,700
and reach the bar counter later,

38
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,460
you will come to me
and act all indecently.

39
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:36,620
Can you do that?

40
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:37,180
Yes, I can.

41
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:38,860
Okay.

42
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,140
Go now.

43
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,460
Come on.

44
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,630
=Trick in Love=

45
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:49,820
(Adapted from the novel
"Mr. Intrigue's Love Game" by Yun Qi Mo Li)

46
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:35,940
Hey, pretty.

47
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,260
Let me treat you to a drink.

48
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:37,780
What are you doing?

49
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,060
Not now.

50
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,180
Didn't you tell me

51
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,020
to behave like this
when you come out from the toilet?

52
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,420
I mean you should do it
when I reach the bar counter.

53
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,860
But I haven't reached it yet.

54
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,180
Go on.

55
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,020
Continue.

56
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,020
Miss.

57
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,380
You are drunk.

58
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,780
Do you need me to send you home?

59
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,660
Let go of me.

60
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,060
Come on.

61
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:56,860
I'll send you home.

62
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,420
I'll send you home.

63
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,260
Let go.

64
00:02:59,260 --> 00:02:59,660
Miss.

65
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,580
Find someone else to pick up.

66
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,740
What are you doing?

67
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,420
What a nutcase.

68
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,460
Take me away.

69
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,340
Since he can be a two-timer,

70
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,460
I can also sleep with another guy.

71
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,500
Be careful not to fall.

72
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,540
This is the battlefield

73
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,900
of my sister and the jerk, Gu Jiannan.

74
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,540
They betrayed me on this bed.

75
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,940
All wealthy guys have a fickle heart.

76
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,140
Do you also have a fickle heart?

77
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:05,900
I don't.

78
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,820
I hate rich people.

79
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:18,900
Let's do it.

80
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,900
You don't like me?

81
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,660
(I've searched for you for ten years.)

82
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,740
(How can I possibly not like you?)

83
00:05:30,275 --> 00:05:32,425
(Rongjin Tea Farm)

84
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,140
Last night...

85
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,380
This is what happened last night.

86
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,140
To be honest,

87
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,460
you took the initiative.

88
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:24,860
You...

89
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,620
You don't have
some kind of disease, do you?

90
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,740
If you are worried about it,

91
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,100
you can check on me.

92
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:33,900
Hey.

93
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:35,780
We are all adults.

94
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,020
Let's just pretend
that nothing happened.

95
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,260
That won't do.

96
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:43,500
What?

97
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,140
You want to latch on to me?

98
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,580
Exactly.

99
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,580
The rule of adults.

100
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:55,460
We are even now.

101
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:01,740
I don't want money.

102
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,380
Then what do you want?

103
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:12,940
I want you.

104
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,140
In your dreams.

105
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,740
Where are you going?

106
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:35,820
To have a health check-up.

107
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,340
(I already have your address.)

108
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,740
(You can never run away from me.)

109
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,500
(Mo Suqing ID card)

110
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,300
(I've been planning for this
for a long time.)

111
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,460
(I'm sure you'd fall for it.)
