Being nice to everyone when he's not even interested.

- Secret crush.
- Yeah.

126
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:04,102
Can we find out who posted it?

127
00:08:04,102 --> 00:08:06,910
Nope. It's anonymous. Why?

128
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:12,090
It's a bit awkward for me to say, but...

So, we have to...

132
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:30,227
Come on, I'm serious!

133
00:08:30,227 --> 00:08:33,787
I like carrot juice! How many high schoolers like carrot juice?

134
00:08:36,727 --> 00:08:37,950

I thought it could be me...

136
00:08:41,295 --> 00:08:43,454
So?

137
00:08:43,454 --> 00:08:45,841
Why not leave a comment?

138
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,727
Should I?

139
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:49,970
What would you say?

140
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,348
To confess.

141
00:08:52,348 --> 00:08:56,208
If you confess, you'll become someone a little special to them.

142
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:58,709
Even better if they accept it.

143
00:08:58,709 --> 00:09:01,163
If it were you,

144
00:09:01,163 --> 00:09:03,183
would you confess?

145
00:09:04,251 --> 00:09:07,102
<i>Nope. Absolutely not.</i>

146
00:09:07,102 --> 00:09:09,102
<i>Never.</i>

147
00:09:09,102 --> 00:09:12,944
Of course! I definitely would.

148
00:09:17,581 --> 00:09:19,494
Where is it?

149
00:09:26,643 --> 00:09:28,502

150
00:09:44,942 --> 00:09:46,518
Hi.

You're still here?

152
00:09:49,394 --> 00:09:52,799
Yeah, I forgot my wallet.

153
00:09:56,685 --> 00:10:00,157
But you know, this isn't my seat.

154
00:10:00,952 --> 00:10:03,218
My seat is here.

155
00:10:04,369 --> 00:10:06,769
That's not carrot juice. What is it this time?

156
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:08,599
What the...

157
00:10:22,912 --> 00:10:25,899
This is Shin Ho Sik's seat.

158
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:27,718
It's a secret.

159
00:10:28,632 --> 00:10:31,952
If you tell anyone, you're dead.

160
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:42,232
Ho Sik?

161
00:10:42,232 --> 00:10:44,459
No way.

Are you watching that?

164
00:10:52,186 --> 00:10:53,261
Sis,

165
00:10:53,261 --> 00:10:56,288
what do girls look for in a guy?

166
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,166
Looks.

167
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:01,426
I don't think so.

168
00:11:01,426 --> 00:11:03,519
It can't be.

169
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,186
Come on!

170
00:11:05,186 --> 00:11:07,519
If that's true, nobody would like Ho Sik.

171
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,460
I'm telling you, it's looks. I care about looks.

172
00:11:19,952 --> 00:11:21,413
Geez!

173
00:11:21,413 --> 00:11:22,932
Then what about your boyfriend?

174
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,394
Jong Gu?

175
00:11:24,394 --> 00:11:28,403
He's got a cute face. What would you know?

176
00:11:29,396 --> 00:11:31,477
Why aren't you seeing him these days?

177
00:11:31,477 --> 00:11:33,518
We broke up.

178
00:11:33,518 --> 00:11:34,643
For real?

179
00:11:34,643 --> 00:11:36,112
Yeah.

180
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,809
Was it a threat or for real?

181
00:11:38,809 --> 00:11:42,269
Ninety percent threat, ten percent real.

182
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:44,102
We really did break up to some extent.

183
00:11:44,102 --> 00:11:48,039
He's been slacking off, so I need to straighten him out.

184
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:50,019
Are you a gangster or what?

185
00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:52,560
Why even date if all you do is fight and break up?

186
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,102
That's what dating is. You fight, then make up.

187
00:11:55,102 --> 00:11:59,284
If you're always polite and say nice things, that's not a boyfriend.

188
00:11:59,284 --> 00:12:01,394
That's an acquaintance.

189
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:07,701
Looks, huh?

190
00:12:08,935 --> 00:12:11,011
No way...

191
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:30,577
<i>[With my best friend Chan Young]</i>

192
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:35,604
<i>Or maybe it really is about looks.</i>

193
00:12:37,977 --> 00:12:40,976
Chan Young looks so good.

194
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:55,125
Who's here at this hour?

195
00:12:59,762 --> 00:13:02,260
Why didn't you go home?

196
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,675
I came to see the supermoon.

197
00:13:05,434 --> 00:13:07,535
It's not time yet.

198
00:13:08,235 --> 00:13:09,939
I just...

199
00:13:09,939 --> 00:13:11,357
didn't feel like going home.

200
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,033
Why not?

201
00:13:18,643 --> 00:13:20,735
The moon is huge.

202
00:13:21,578 --> 00:13:24,044
It'll be the biggest in two days.

203
00:13:26,914 --> 00:13:28,250
Hey.

204
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,426
Didn't you say when a supermoon appears, there's an earthquake?

205
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,546
I hope there is an earthquake.

206
00:13:34,546 --> 00:13:36,882
There won't be.

207
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:39,352
If you hate home, run away.

208
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:41,352
We can't have an earthquake just because of you.

209
00:13:41,352 --> 00:13:43,152
I guess not.

210
00:13:46,852 --> 00:13:48,469
Why?

211
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,171
Is your brother home?

212
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,865
Yeah.

213
00:13:55,295 --> 00:13:58,678
Isn't a med student supposed to be busy?

214
00:13:58,678 --> 00:14:02,027
I don't know. He just came for a while.

215
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,394
It's too cold to run away.

216
00:14:05,394 --> 00:14:07,987
I'll sit for a bit and go.

217
00:14:07,987 --> 00:14:10,677
<i>Chan Young's one weakness.</i>

218
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:14,186
<i>It isn't some golden boy his mom knows.</i>

219
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:17,677
<i>It's his older brother.</i>

220
00:14:24,643 --> 00:14:26,598
You're back late.

221
00:14:30,352 --> 00:14:33,436
Yeah, didn't you go to sleep?

222
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,152
Hey, why do you still have those old medals lying around?

223
00:14:38,152 --> 00:14:41,362
I didn't keep them. Mom did.

224
00:14:42,144 --> 00:14:44,316
Most of them are yours anyway.

225
00:14:45,186 --> 00:14:47,960
Aren't you playing tennis these days?

226
00:14:48,868 --> 00:14:50,060
No, I'm not.

227
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,723
Why not?

228
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,293
You know why.

229
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:56,380
What's the point of always being second place?

230
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,949
Even you quit when you were always first place.

231
00:14:58,949 --> 00:15:02,315
Playing tennis as a hobby is good enough.

232
00:15:02,315 --> 00:15:03,927
I need to study.

233
00:15:03,927 --> 00:15:05,871
Did Dad say that?

234
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:10,768
Put mine away. Do what you want with yours.

235
00:15:10,768 --> 00:15:12,446
Good night.

236
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:44,853
What are you doing?

237
00:15:44,853 --> 00:15:46,879
We're late! Run!

238
00:15:58,521 --> 00:16:00,858
We almost missed it.

239
00:16:01,944 --> 00:16:04,771
You should have left sooner.

240
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:08,883
If I didn't make you run, you'd be late.

241
00:16:11,605 --> 00:16:13,539
Did we switch seats yesterday?

242
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,107
This is your seat.

243
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:16,502
Is it a bomb?

244
00:16:16,502 --> 00:16:18,646
Just open it!

245
00:16:18,646 --> 00:16:20,705
- Should I?
- Don't touch it!

246
00:16:20,705 --> 00:16:24,421
<i>- What's his problem?
- Now what?</i>

247
00:16:24,421 --> 00:16:26,203
I'll open it by myself.

248
00:16:26,203 --> 00:16:27,845
Quietly.

249
00:16:27,845 --> 00:16:29,979
When no one's around.

250
00:16:29,979 --> 00:16:31,904
Suit yourself.

251
00:16:35,052 --> 00:16:36,645
You really didn't see who it was?

252
00:16:36,645 --> 00:16:39,570
You were the last one to leave yesterday.

253
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,160
I didn't.

254
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,521
Who could it be?

255
00:16:44,521 --> 00:16:47,787
Who's secretly crushing on me?

256
00:16:47,787 --> 00:16:48,950
Hey.

257
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:52,479
Are you sure it's yours? Did it have your name on it?

258
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,204
Chan Young,

259
00:16:54,204 --> 00:16:57,557
you're 200 times more of a jerk when you say stuff like that.

260
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:06,941
See that? Ho Sik with a heart.

261
00:17:06,941 --> 00:17:08,904
Yeah, yeah. Just eat.

262
00:17:08,904 --> 00:17:10,187
Maybe it's Seol Hee.

263
00:17:10,187 --> 00:17:12,505
Could be, right?

264
00:17:12,505 --> 00:17:15,767
She blocks your messages, but leaves you a gift?

265
00:17:15,767 --> 00:17:18,327
That's new.

266
00:17:18,327 --> 00:17:21,755
What do you know! She taught me how to pick up stitches!

267
00:17:21,755 --> 00:17:23,809
Oh, she scared me.

268
00:17:24,882 --> 00:17:28,630
We're eating. That's so rude.

269
00:17:30,663 --> 00:17:32,451
It's your fault!

270
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:35,287
I can't eat with all this noise. Geez.

271
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,460
What did I do?

272
00:17:54,348 --> 00:17:57,550
<i>I can't believe Ho Sik received a confession.</i>

273
00:17:58,672 --> 00:18:01,238
<i>The universe has gone crazy.</i>

274
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,540
Hey!

275
00:18:15,453 --> 00:18:17,497
- Are you okay?
- Huh?

276
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:19,155
Yeah.

277
00:18:20,893 --> 00:18:24,763
Uh, yeah, I'm okay.

278
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,816
Why did you hit it like that?

279
00:18:32,816 --> 00:18:36,481
What are you talking about? You should receive it!

280
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:45,718
Ugh, this is so heavy. There's so much water.

281
00:18:45,718 --> 00:18:48,451
Why is there so much water?

282
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:56,591
Oh, no. I'm sorry! Are you okay?

283
00:18:57,904 --> 00:19:00,092
I'm so sorry.

284
00:19:00,092 --> 00:19:03,374
Ugh, it even smells...

285
00:19:04,967 --> 00:19:06,786
It's okay.

286
00:19:08,733 --> 00:19:11,625
- Hee Su, hurry up.
- I'm almost done.

287
00:19:12,775 --> 00:19:14,845
Hey, Hee Su.

288
00:19:14,845 --> 00:19:16,800
Can we talk?

289
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,349
I'm so sorry about earlier.

290
00:19:19,349 --> 00:19:21,567
It'll just be a moment.

291
00:19:22,399 --> 00:19:25,079
Let's talk in the counseling room.

292
00:19:25,872 --> 00:19:28,241
Okay, I'll be there.

293
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:32,558
<i>Oh, I'm doomed.</i>

294
00:19:38,483 --> 00:19:40,386
What was that?

295
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,342
Sorry, you guys go ahead without me.

296
00:19:46,342 --> 00:19:47,503
I need to talk to Seung Won.

297
00:19:47,503 --> 00:19:48,925
You're doomed, dude.

298
00:19:48,925 --> 00:19:51,774
If he doesn't get into college, he's going to blame it on you.

299
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:53,651
Come on...

300
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:56,299
Text me if you make it out alive.

301
00:19:56,299 --> 00:19:58,430
I'll be at the internet cafe.

302
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,190
See you.

303
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,248
What is it?

304
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:20,960
Well... I need to tell you something.

305
00:20:21,923 --> 00:20:23,246
What is it?

306
00:20:23,246 --> 00:20:25,553
Well, uh...

307
00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:32,591
Well...

308
00:20:32,591 --> 00:20:35,316
<i>This feels familiar.</i>

309
00:20:35,316 --> 00:20:37,299
Do you...

310
00:20:41,743 --> 00:20:43,708
need counseling?

311
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,145
Relationship advice?

312
00:20:50,134 --> 00:20:51,757
Yeah.

313
00:20:51,757 --> 00:20:53,067
Give me some advice.

314
00:20:53,067 --> 00:20:54,967
Why are you dragging it out like that?

315
00:20:54,967 --> 00:20:56,924
You scared me for a bit there.

316
00:20:56,924 --> 00:20:58,368
Hey, Kim Seung Won!

317
00:20:58,368 --> 00:21:01,216
I thought all you did was study.

318
00:21:01,216 --> 00:21:02,953
Are you dating?

319
00:21:02,953 --> 00:21:06,748
No, I'm not dating.

320
00:21:06,748 --> 00:21:08,458
Is it a crush?

321
00:21:09,174 --> 00:21:10,842
Yeah.

322
00:21:10,842 --> 00:21:13,188
Why'd you buy so much stuff?

323
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:15,550
Want some other stuff?

324
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:17,892
No, no, no.

325
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:22,883
I like this.

326
00:21:22,883 --> 00:21:25,466
Yeah, you mentioned it last time.

327
00:21:25,466 --> 00:21:28,536
You said the carrot juice post was about you.

328
00:21:29,341 --> 00:21:30,758
Well...

329
00:21:30,758 --> 00:21:33,341
It might not be me.

330
00:21:33,341 --> 00:21:35,700
But I do like it.

331
00:21:43,452 --> 00:21:45,716
Hey, tell me about your problem.

332
00:21:45,716 --> 00:21:48,883
Everyone says you only care about getting into college.

333
00:21:48,883 --> 00:21:51,376
If they find out you like someone, they'll be shocked.

334
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:52,561
Who said that?

335
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,925
Everyone.

336
00:21:53,925 --> 00:21:56,800
They say you're practically an AI on college admission.

337
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,600
I am?

338
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:04,138
So, who is it? You must really like her.

339
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:10,812
Buy them carrot juice.

340
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,315
What's next?

341
00:22:13,315 --> 00:22:15,125
Come on, stop it.

342
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,716
No, seriously. What comes after a drink?

343
00:22:17,716 --> 00:22:19,988
What are you supposed to do?

344
00:22:19,988 --> 00:22:21,425
Well...

345
00:22:21,425 --> 00:22:24,117
Keep giving them what they like?

346
00:22:24,858 --> 00:22:26,244
What does she like?

347
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:28,039
I don't know. What do you like?

348
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:29,883
Me?

349
00:22:29,883 --> 00:22:31,550

351
00:22:34,633 --> 00:22:36,063
What did you eat yesterday?

352
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,716
Yesterday?

353
00:22:37,716 --> 00:22:40,334
Tteokbokki. Chan Young wanted to eat it.

354
00:22:40,334 --> 00:22:42,092
Right, he likes tteokbokki.

355
00:22:42,092 --> 00:22:44,341
Other than food.

356
00:22:44,341 --> 00:22:45,489
Chan Young likes tennis?

357
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,200
Not Chan Young.

358
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,474

00:22:50,398 --> 00:22:52,142

364
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:19,508
What an embarrassment.

365
00:23:19,508 --> 00:23:21,265
Firstly!

366
00:23:21,265 --> 00:23:24,024
Find out what she likes.

367
00:23:30,392 --> 00:23:32,443
I'm going to go then.

368
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,299

This is a new level of attention-seeking.

Didn't you see the anon board?

398
00:25:40,925 --> 00:25:44,728
There was this person giving carrot juice to their crush.

- You?
- You?
