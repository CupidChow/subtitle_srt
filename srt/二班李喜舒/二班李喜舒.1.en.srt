There must have been an announcement.
They all say the same thing.

Look, it's because you always ignore
their texts and ghost them.

Why even date them?

They like me, so how can I say
I don't like you?

157
00:08:54,727 --> 00:08:56,560
It was no confession.

158
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,438
She wanted advice.
I'm not Ju Chan Young.

What's this? Who put this here?

168
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:57,664
- Oh, that...
- What?

169
00:09:57,664 --> 00:09:59,842
What's that? Is that...

170
00:09:59,842 --> 00:10:02,009
Was it on your desk?

171
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:03,475
Yeah.

172
00:10:03,475 --> 00:10:06,048
- Wow, unbelievable.
- Why?

173
00:10:06,048 --> 00:10:09,376
Looks like someone likes you. Awesome!

174
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:10,876
What's with him?

175
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:12,302
Someone must like you.

176
00:10:12,302 --> 00:10:14,809
Right?

177
00:10:14,809 --> 00:10:17,076
Stop it.

178
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,440
- Ju Chan, you got dumped again?
- You know already?

179
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,068
Everyone in school knows.

180
00:10:26,068 --> 00:10:29,642
The girls are lined up
with number tickets to date you.

181
00:10:29,642 --> 00:10:32,309
They're lined up to confess.

182
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,742
Hee Su.

183
00:10:34,742 --> 00:10:36,877
Want to go out with me?

184
00:10:38,742 --> 00:10:42,041
If we were going out,
girls would stop taking number tickets.

185
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,293
<i>This is the bad thing about Chan Young.</i>

186
00:10:44,293 --> 00:10:46,336
Really.

187
00:10:47,312 --> 00:10:48,524
You two should go out.

188
00:10:48,524 --> 00:10:50,299
You're always together anyway.

189
00:10:50,299 --> 00:10:53,510
<i>He stirs up people's feelings
with meaningless jokes.</i>

190
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,895
Hey, don't.

191
00:10:55,895 --> 00:10:56,989
Look at his face.

192
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,909
Is that face really necessary?

193
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:00,909
Hey, I'm sorry! Okay?

194
00:11:01,842 --> 00:11:04,976
Well, you might have dated a lot.

195
00:11:04,976 --> 00:11:07,024
But Hee Su's never dated before.

196
00:11:07,024 --> 00:11:10,127
<i>Moments like this shake my universe.</i>

197
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:12,143
Look who's talking!

198
00:11:12,143 --> 00:11:13,406
Go out with him!

199
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:16,808
Hey, I have standards.

200
00:11:19,876 --> 00:11:22,221
Knock it off.

201
00:11:27,669 --> 00:11:30,172
Did you pick a club yet?

202
00:11:30,172 --> 00:11:31,632
You didn't, right?

203
00:11:31,632 --> 00:11:33,050
Let's do futsal!

204
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:34,842
I'm doing video production.

205
00:11:34,842 --> 00:11:36,470
Not tennis?

206
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:38,876
Hee Su, you'll do video too?

207
00:11:39,681 --> 00:11:41,100
I'm not sure.

208
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:45,809
You'll just follow Ju Chan
like you always do.

209
00:11:45,809 --> 00:11:48,809
What will you do?
Let's do the same thing.

210
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,677
Well...

211
00:11:52,669 --> 00:11:54,321
There's something I want to do.

212
00:11:54,321 --> 00:11:56,942
No, find something else.

213
00:11:56,942 --> 00:11:59,452
Forget about an astronomy club.

214
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:01,742
Why?

215
00:12:01,742 --> 00:12:04,624
The rooftop access is one thing,

216
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:08,210
but activities from 10 p.m. to midnight?
That's crazy.

217
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,129
You can supervise.

218
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:13,065
And my work-life balance?
I have a family.

219
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,809
It's only once a week.

220
00:12:14,809 --> 00:12:16,986
Hee Su, my kid is three now.

221
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,909
He's adorable.
Wanna see a picture?

222
00:12:18,909 --> 00:12:20,642
Never mind, I'll show you a video.

223
00:12:20,642 --> 00:12:23,743
- He talks so well.
- Hmph.

224
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,842
Hmph?

225
00:12:27,271 --> 00:12:28,981
I won't watch it.

226
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:31,150
Why? He's cute.

227
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,168
Not interested.

228
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,236
See? I kicked it.

229
00:12:40,236 --> 00:12:42,619
Hey, even I could do that.

230
00:12:42,619 --> 00:12:44,609
I thought you said
you were like Pogba.

231
00:12:44,609 --> 00:12:45,873
It's more like Pog-bad!

232
00:12:45,873 --> 00:12:48,083
How can you fall on your face like that?

233
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,809
- I know, look.
- You...

234
00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:52,742
- You look even uglier.
- Come on!

235
00:12:52,742 --> 00:12:54,876
- Why are you so ugly?
- What about you!

236
00:12:54,876 --> 00:12:57,800
Hey, I'm way better looking than you.

237
00:12:59,386 --> 00:13:02,009
Hey, who's better looking?

238
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:04,941
Same, same.

239
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,809
Hee Su.

240
00:13:07,809 --> 00:13:10,776
The bell rang. Clean up your desk.

241
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:27,097
Did you do something wrong
to Seung Won?

242
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:29,025
No.

243
00:13:29,025 --> 00:13:31,310
I don't know what his problem is.

244
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,876
He must not like you.

245
00:13:32,876 --> 00:13:37,107
He normally doesn't care
about anything other than college.

246
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:39,026
He lives in my place.

247
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:41,542
What? You live with Seung Won?

248
00:13:41,542 --> 00:13:43,530
No, he lives next door to me.

249
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,909
Where Chan Young lived.

250
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:47,434
Hee Su.

251
00:13:47,434 --> 00:13:50,103
Do you still sing with your window open?

252
00:13:50,103 --> 00:13:52,981
Then he might not like you.

253
00:13:52,981 --> 00:13:54,151
I know from experience.

254
00:13:54,151 --> 00:13:56,534
I didn't do that.

255
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,210
I've quit.

256
00:14:54,251 --> 00:14:56,551
Hee Su!

257
00:14:56,551 --> 00:14:58,772
Hey, weren't you on cleaning duty?

258
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:00,299
I skipped it!

259
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:01,300
Internet cafe?

260
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,175
Yeah!

261
00:15:25,482 --> 00:15:28,125
[Heat this and eat it]

262
00:15:56,329 --> 00:15:58,583
You scared me!

263
00:16:01,917 --> 00:16:04,254
This is so annoying.

264
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,506
Why are you lying there?

265
00:16:06,506 --> 00:16:08,717
Go to your room or something.

266
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:10,827
You go.

267
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:16,099
I'm making ramyeon.
You're not eating, right?

268
00:16:16,099 --> 00:16:18,226
You better not ask for a bite.

269
00:16:18,226 --> 00:16:21,819
I haven't eaten all day.

270
00:16:21,819 --> 00:16:24,730
I'm starving.

271
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:28,570
Should I cook three instead?

272
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,056
Tell me now.
Don't ask for any later.

273
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:36,103
I can't eat anything.
It won't go down.

274
00:16:36,103 --> 00:16:37,537
Bull.

275
00:16:37,537 --> 00:16:39,564
Hey.

276
00:16:39,564 --> 00:16:41,817
Do you know the pain of heartbreak?

277
00:16:41,817 --> 00:16:44,628
<i>I heard there is this saying.</i>

278
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:48,114
<i>The third daughter is married off
without even being seen.</i>

279
00:16:48,917 --> 00:16:50,917
<i>But boy...</i>

280
00:16:50,917 --> 00:16:53,118
<i>That would be a disaster.</i>

281
00:16:56,884 --> 00:16:58,433
You startled me!

282
00:16:58,433 --> 00:17:01,185
That shrimp-head fool!
How dare he!

283
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:03,684
Geez.

284
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:06,691
<i>Anger management issues.</i>

285
00:17:06,691 --> 00:17:08,318
Looks like she got dumped again.

286
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:09,851
You're home early.

287
00:17:09,851 --> 00:17:11,696
You're back?

288
00:17:12,639 --> 00:17:14,873
Sis...

289
00:17:14,873 --> 00:17:17,851
I don't think I can date guys anymore.

290
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:21,422
Should I join a convent?

291
00:17:22,399 --> 00:17:25,326
<i>Chronic nonsense.</i>

292
00:17:25,326 --> 00:17:26,503
I'm home.

293
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,062
Hey.

294
00:17:30,131 --> 00:17:32,407
She's pretty quiet today.

295
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:39,407
<i>Can't tell if she's human or beast.</i>

296
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:43,395
I almost won...

297
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:53,054
No!

298
00:17:53,054 --> 00:17:55,183
Lie down!

299
00:17:55,183 --> 00:17:56,918
No!

300
00:17:57,701 --> 00:18:00,018
Why are you tying your hair?

301
00:18:00,018 --> 00:18:01,413
Hi!

302
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,290
Yes! Ramyeon!

303
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:06,826
That's ours! Make your own!

304
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:15,868
What's with her?

305
00:18:16,717 --> 00:18:18,963
You didn't shower, did you?

306
00:18:19,656 --> 00:18:22,334
Whatever! What's the point of a shower?

307
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:23,951
Hee Sin.

308
00:18:23,951 --> 00:18:25,462
Know what your problem is?

309
00:18:25,462 --> 00:18:26,817
Don't.

310
00:18:26,817 --> 00:18:28,256
Listen closely.

311
00:18:28,256 --> 00:18:31,692
The beginning of a relationship
isn't a confession.

312
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,388
It's the build-up.

313
00:18:34,388 --> 00:18:37,599
You have to build-up properly
and then confess.

314
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:41,645
You can't keep confessing
like getting stamps for coffee.

315
00:18:41,645 --> 00:18:45,522
Do you get at least a cup of coffee
after ten confessions?

316
00:18:45,522 --> 00:18:47,292
A confession...

317
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:50,628
should always come from him. Not you.

318
00:18:52,018 --> 00:18:53,490
Whatever.

319
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:56,618
What does she do
when she likes someone?

320
00:18:56,618 --> 00:18:58,411
She goes and confesses.

321
00:18:58,411 --> 00:18:59,412
Right?

322
00:18:59,412 --> 00:19:01,206
That's the problem.

323
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:04,217
If you like someone...

324
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:09,297
You chase him to the ends of the Earth

325
00:19:09,297 --> 00:19:13,385
and make him confess to you.

326
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:15,119
That's it.

327
00:19:15,817 --> 00:19:17,084
How?

328
00:19:17,084 --> 00:19:18,490
Win him over.

329
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,617
How exactly?

330
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:22,310
Well...

331
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:25,818
That takes know-how and skill.

332
00:19:27,184 --> 00:19:29,618
- How!
- How!

333
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,028
Okay.

334
00:19:32,028 --> 00:19:33,717
That's...

335
00:19:33,717 --> 00:19:37,784
Something I can't tell you
over some ramyeon, children!

336
00:19:37,784 --> 00:19:39,368
Go ahead and eat.

337
00:19:40,851 --> 00:19:43,518
She ate all of it.

338
00:19:43,518 --> 00:19:45,818
How frustrating.

339
00:19:49,717 --> 00:19:51,889
Hey.

340
00:19:51,889 --> 00:19:54,057
Lend me your camera.

341
00:19:54,057 --> 00:19:56,319
That's low.

342
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:59,221
I could add some rice
and give it to you.

343
00:20:03,851 --> 00:20:05,918
Check my desk drawer.

344
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,375
Okay, eat.

345
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,551
Hey, what about the rice?!

346
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:30,378
This is...

347
00:20:30,378 --> 00:20:32,505
You like that.

348
00:20:39,755 --> 00:20:40,905
Is that it?

349
00:20:40,905 --> 00:20:43,348
Yeah, my sister's.

350
00:20:44,175 --> 00:20:46,335
No need to take my picture.

351
00:21:15,132 --> 00:21:17,118
Are you okay?

352
00:21:19,884 --> 00:21:21,921
Did you see how quick I was?

353
00:21:23,406 --> 00:21:25,451
Oh boy.

354
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:27,226
It hurts so much.

355
00:21:28,077 --> 00:21:29,996
Get up.

356
00:21:29,996 --> 00:21:32,651
- Are you okay?
- It hurts so much.

357
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,278
Isn't that Cha So Hee of class 4?

358
00:21:37,278 --> 00:21:38,912
Yeah.

359
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,133
She wanted to watch me skateboard.

360
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,429
Is it her now?

361
00:21:46,429 --> 00:21:48,623
You just broke up.

362
00:21:48,623 --> 00:21:51,459
It's not like that.
She doesn't like me.

363
00:21:51,459 --> 00:21:54,595
I said we were hanging,
and she wanted to come.

364
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:58,084
<i>She likes him for sure.</i>

365
00:22:00,784 --> 00:22:04,514
<i>There are three types of people
who approach me</i>

366
00:22:04,514 --> 00:22:07,016
<i>to get close to Chan Young.</i>

367
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:10,051
- Oppa.
- Huh?

368
00:22:10,051 --> 00:22:11,784
This...

369
00:22:13,751 --> 00:22:14,852
For me?

370
00:22:14,852 --> 00:22:17,335
No, give it to Chan Young, please.

371
00:22:17,335 --> 00:22:22,355
<i>Type 1, the 'delegators',
who blatantly ask me to confess for them.</i>

372
00:22:22,355 --> 00:22:25,118
What about her?
She's really pretty.

373
00:22:25,118 --> 00:22:27,387
I'll help you hook up with her.

374
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:29,351
Help me get acquainted with Chan Young.

375
00:22:29,351 --> 00:22:32,308
<i>Type 2, the 'traders',
with a clear quid pro quo approach.</i>

376
00:22:32,308 --> 00:22:34,884
What are you doing tonight?

377
00:22:34,884 --> 00:22:36,229
Me?

378
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:38,817
Wanna go to the coin karaoke with us?

379
00:22:38,817 --> 00:22:41,141
Let's meet out front.

380
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:45,989
Bring Chan Young.
You're always together.

381
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:51,351
<i>Type 3, the 'criminals', who hold me
hostage to approach Chan Young.</i>

382
00:22:58,318 --> 00:23:00,236
Hee Su.

383
00:23:00,236 --> 00:23:01,404
Huh?

384
00:23:01,404 --> 00:23:03,156
Do you have a girlfriend?

385
00:23:03,156 --> 00:23:04,784
Anyone you like?

386
00:23:04,784 --> 00:23:06,075
Why?

387
00:23:06,075 --> 00:23:07,368
Just wondering.

388
00:23:07,368 --> 00:23:10,788
Why you or Chan Young don't date.

389
00:23:11,831 --> 00:23:14,142
What are you talking about?

390
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:15,602
He always has a girlfriend.

391
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:18,784
Hey, that's not real dating.

392
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:22,342
He doesn't want to bother
rejecting them, so he lets them be.

393
00:23:22,342 --> 00:23:23,717
You think?

394
00:23:23,717 --> 00:23:27,518
Either he was badly burned before

395
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:33,393
or is in love with someone
for a long time.

396
00:23:33,393 --> 00:23:36,831
<i>- What type is she?</i>
- Why don't you date?

397
00:23:36,831 --> 00:23:40,985
<i>An 'intellect' who seeks
the cause of a problem?</i>

398
00:23:41,986 --> 00:23:44,305
Or do you prefer guys?

399
00:23:45,089 --> 00:23:46,122
Huh?

400
00:23:46,122 --> 00:23:48,755
I guess that's possible, right?

401
00:23:48,755 --> 00:23:50,830
No guy ever confessed to you, right?

402
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,397
Hey.

403
00:23:53,122 --> 00:23:54,489
How can you say that?

404
00:23:54,489 --> 00:23:56,055
What? It's possible.

405
00:23:56,055 --> 00:23:58,356
No, it's not.

406
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,522
Don't say things
without knowing the facts.

407
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:05,301
Chan Young!

408
00:24:05,301 --> 00:24:07,122
Let's go!

409
00:24:12,022 --> 00:24:14,686
<i>Maybe everyone can see</i>

410
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:18,090
<i>what I'm trying so hard to hide.</i>

411
00:24:30,326 --> 00:24:32,144
What's this?

412
00:24:35,915 --> 00:24:37,755
Was it you?

413
00:24:38,501 --> 00:24:41,122
I hate carrot juice.

414
00:24:41,122 --> 00:24:42,439
It really wasn't you?

415
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:45,422
Why would I give that to him?

416
00:24:46,489 --> 00:24:48,803
Forget it.

417
00:24:51,855 --> 00:24:52,933
What's wrong?

418
00:24:52,933 --> 00:24:57,256
My phone's been acting up since yesterday.

419
00:24:57,256 --> 00:25:00,232
<i>I waited outside the academy yesterday
to see Seol Hee.</i>

420
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:01,317
What?

421
00:25:01,317 --> 00:25:06,990
<i>My texts wouldn't go through.
Is it just me? Is it an app error?</i>

422
00:25:10,934 --> 00:25:11,787
It's working.

423
00:25:11,787 --> 00:25:12,845
Are you a stalker?

424
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:14,322
What's the deal?

425
00:25:14,322 --> 00:25:17,140
What about Seol Hee?
Where's Seol Hee?

426
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,558
You got blocked.

427
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:20,289
So...

428
00:25:20,289 --> 00:25:23,337
That's what this is?

429
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:26,089
Come on!

430
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:30,356
Hey stalker, consider yourself lucky
she didn't report you.

431
00:25:30,356 --> 00:25:32,949
Congrats on making it to school
instead of jail.

432
00:25:32,949 --> 00:25:34,324
The ends of the Earth, huh?

433
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:36,453
Gee.

434
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:40,580
Naturally, not creepy like that.

435
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,548
Naturally?

436
00:25:55,955 --> 00:25:57,022
Hee Su.

437
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:58,089
Huh?

438
00:25:58,089 --> 00:25:59,374
Did you decide on a club?

439
00:25:59,374 --> 00:26:01,122
Yeah, video production.

440
00:26:01,122 --> 00:26:04,155
Did you apply? It's full.

441
00:26:04,155 --> 00:26:05,296
Really?

442
00:26:05,296 --> 00:26:08,589
The class list is due tomorrow.
You're the only one left.

443
00:26:08,589 --> 00:26:12,244
I'm sorry, I'll let you know by tomorrow.

444
00:26:18,518 --> 00:26:20,294
Hey.

445
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,189
Counseling club would suit you.

446
00:26:23,189 --> 00:26:25,289
You're great at listening.

447
00:26:25,289 --> 00:26:26,855
Huh?

448
00:26:46,289 --> 00:26:48,155
Sorry.

449
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:58,224
Okay, let's start.

450
00:26:58,224 --> 00:27:02,662
Page two of the handouts
I gave out last time.

451
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:05,665
We'll start with question 18.

452
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:07,041
Number 18.

453
00:27:07,041 --> 00:27:10,211
Which best describes
the purpose of the passage?

454
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:14,122
As I told you last time,
the purpose...

455
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:23,416
<i>When I don't really like anything,</i>

456
00:27:23,416 --> 00:27:26,544
<i>and I don't really have
anything I want to do,</i>

457
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:28,746
<i>I just follow Chan Young.</i>

458
00:27:29,497 --> 00:27:32,222
<i>At least, by doing that,</i>

459
00:27:32,222 --> 00:27:34,951
<i>I can do one thing I like.</i>

460
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:40,198
<i>Be with Chan Young.</i>

461
00:27:50,255 --> 00:27:55,622
<i>How do people open up
their hearts so easily?</i>

462
00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:00,860
<i>I can't seem to bring out
these long-held feelings at all.</i>

463
00:28:11,855 --> 00:28:13,133
Hey.

464
00:28:13,133 --> 00:28:15,089
<i>Did you finish editing?</i>

465
00:28:15,089 --> 00:28:17,055
No, that club is already full.

466
00:28:17,055 --> 00:28:18,256
<i>Really?</i>

467
00:28:18,256 --> 00:28:19,888
<i>What then?</i>

468
00:28:19,888 --> 00:28:21,189
<i>What will you do?</i>

469
00:28:21,189 --> 00:28:23,325
<i>Should I change mine?</i>

470
00:28:27,322 --> 00:28:30,631
<i>Careless words that make you hope.</i>

471
00:28:30,631 --> 00:28:33,252
<i>Hello? Are you listening?</i>

472
00:28:33,252 --> 00:28:36,287
<i>Should we just do futsal with Ho Sik?</i>

473
00:28:36,287 --> 00:28:38,241
No, it's okay.

474
00:28:38,241 --> 00:28:39,383
You like that club.

475
00:28:39,383 --> 00:28:41,952
<i>But it's no fun without you.</i>

476
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:45,723
<i>Words that make my heart flutter.</i>

477
00:28:45,723 --> 00:28:47,655
<i>Hey, Hee Su.</i>

478
00:28:47,655 --> 00:28:50,019
It's fine, I'll find something else.

479
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:51,822
Let's talk tomorrow.

480
00:29:06,853 --> 00:29:08,689
Hey...

481
00:29:10,189 --> 00:29:12,389
Do I give this to you?

482
00:29:31,822 --> 00:29:33,836
You can have this.

483
00:29:35,122 --> 00:29:37,608
- Why?
- I don't drink that.

484
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:42,555
Nobody drinks carrot juice.
Why do they keep serving it?

485
00:29:43,356 --> 00:29:45,432
Have mine too.

486
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:49,289
Did you get the club result?

487
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:50,605
Not yet.

488
00:29:50,605 --> 00:29:52,648
I'll do futsal if they don't accept me.

489
00:29:52,648 --> 00:29:55,222
With who? I'm not doing futsal.

490
00:29:55,222 --> 00:29:56,569
Then what?

491
00:29:56,569 --> 00:29:58,528
Knitting.

492
00:29:59,888 --> 00:30:03,122
You said to chase her naturally.

493
00:30:03,122 --> 00:30:07,222
Seol Hee is in the knitting club.

494
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,348
Wow.

495
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,955
I'm the only guy there.
It's awesome!

496
00:30:10,955 --> 00:30:12,056
Want to join?

497
00:30:12,056 --> 00:30:14,103
Ju Chan.

498
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:17,722
Not you. Good looking guys are banned.

499
00:30:18,482 --> 00:30:21,084
- Snack bar after lunch?
- Yeah!

500
00:30:21,084 --> 00:30:23,289
- Go ahead.
- Why?

501
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:25,155
Interview.

502
00:30:40,739 --> 00:30:42,907
Are you here for an interview?

503
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:45,055
Yes, hello.

504
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,137

- Yes.

505

509

You're in the same class as Seung Won?

510
00:31:03,726 --> 00:31:05,346
Yes.

511
00:31:05,346 --> 00:31:08,256

Okay.

Seung Won will tell you all about it.

517
00:31:20,586 --> 00:31:22,122
Okay.

518
00:31:27,869 --> 00:31:29,620
You're in the counseling club?

519
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:32,439
Yeah, I'm going to study psychology.

520

I'll text you the username and password.

Since I'm the club president,
run them by me first.

524

579
00:35:02,708 --> 00:35:06,110

Even the person being confessed to.

587

Without a confession, they won't know
if someone likes them.

588
00:35:32,356 --> 00:35:36,155
Just anyone isn't the same
as someone who likes you.

589
00:35:36,155 --> 00:35:39,161
It makes you special
even if you're rejected.

590

You're special, very special.
