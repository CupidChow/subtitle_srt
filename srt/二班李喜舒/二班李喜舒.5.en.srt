00:40:42,272 --> 00:40:44,140
Goodbye.

493
00:40:46,552 --> 00:40:48,136
- I'm going.
- Bye.

494
00:40:48,136 --> 00:40:49,721
Chan Young.

495
00:40:49,721 --> 00:40:51,557
Let's play a round before you go.

496
00:40:51,557 --> 00:40:53,541
Sure!

497
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:03,410
- Oh sorry, something came up.
- Just one set.

498
00:41:10,909 --> 00:41:14,096
- Thank you.
- Sure, goodbye.

499
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:16,209
Hey, why is this so heavy?

500
00:41:16,209 --> 00:41:18,169
- Where should I put it?
- Give it to me.

501
00:41:18,169 --> 00:41:20,711
- Isn't it heavy?
- It's okay.

502
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:23,129
I'll help you.

503
00:41:26,758 --> 00:41:29,804
Thanks a lot. Drink this.

504
00:41:29,804 --> 00:41:31,888
Did you order fried chicken?

505
00:41:31,888 --> 00:41:34,315
Yeah, I did.

506
00:41:34,315 --> 00:41:36,374
What about pizza?

507
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:41,080
You didn't order it?

508
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,334
You should've ordered pizza too!

509
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:48,347

Sorry.

517
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:22,105
It's 3 o'clock sharp!

518
00:42:22,105 --> 00:42:25,150
I saw the time too.

519
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:27,151
I'm not late!

520
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:29,740
I ran so much.

521
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:34,200
I was working out earlier,
but I ran even faster just now.

522
00:42:37,454 --> 00:42:39,608
I'm glad.

523
00:42:41,266 --> 00:42:43,001
I'm sorry.

524
00:42:43,001 --> 00:42:44,187
For what?

525
00:42:44,187 --> 00:42:46,588
For saying something stupid.

526
00:42:47,564 --> 00:42:49,383
At least you know it now.

527
00:42:49,383 --> 00:42:51,051
Now...

528
00:42:51,051 --> 00:42:52,928
I'm going to be like you.

529

- Why do you keep following...
- What I like...

530
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:58,650
I'm just going to like it.

531
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:05,023
I'll really work hard at what I like.

532
00:43:05,023 --> 00:43:07,150
What are you talking about...

533
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:09,444
I like you.

534
00:43:09,444 --> 00:43:11,140
