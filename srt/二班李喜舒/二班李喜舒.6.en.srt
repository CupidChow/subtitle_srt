00:13:39,593 --> 00:13:42,096
Sis, do we have sleeping bags?

168
00:13:42,096 --> 00:13:44,765
<i>Shut up!</i>

169
00:13:46,542 --> 00:13:48,312
Sis, can you lend me your camera?

170
00:13:48,312 --> 00:13:50,379
<i>Do you have a death wish?!</i>

171
00:13:56,819 --> 00:14:00,080
<i>So, what do you want with Hee Su?</i>

172
00:14:14,965 --> 00:14:17,171
Hey, help me out!

173
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:25,391
I give up.

174
00:14:25,391 --> 00:14:26,433
You go ahead.

175
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:29,408
What's all this?

176
00:14:32,646 --> 00:14:33,965
That's the rice cooker.

177
00:14:33,965 --> 00:14:36,965
The cabin's in the countryside, so there's no restaurant nearby.

178
00:14:36,965 --> 00:14:39,154
And we'll need ramyeon for a late-night snack.

179
00:14:39,154 --> 00:14:41,907
We won't be able to see the shooting star until around 4 a.m.

180
00:14:41,907 --> 00:14:44,158
It could be cold, so sleeping bags and...

181
00:14:44,158 --> 00:14:47,060
Just in case, a change of clothes.

182
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,196
Anyway, I can't go.

183
00:15:00,415 --> 00:15:03,386
<i>[Ji Yu: Wanna go to the terminal together?]</i>

184
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:14,998
Did you sleep well?

185
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:26,408
He even sounds good when he asks if I slept well.

186
00:15:26,408 --> 00:15:29,861
He's coming to pick me up. He's coming to pick me up!

187
00:15:31,865 --> 00:15:33,765
Oh, hold on.

188
00:15:35,084 --> 00:15:37,252
Kim Seung Won...

189
00:15:37,252 --> 00:15:40,166
Come right on time for the bus.

190
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,717
Don't come too early.

191
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:49,188
What is it?

192
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,932
Oh, nothing.

193
00:15:51,932 --> 00:15:55,185
Ji Yu said to buy pork belly.

194
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,595
- Let's go over there.
- Okay.

195
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:50,959
What's all this?

196
00:16:53,203 --> 00:16:56,923
Oh, it's to do the dishes after we eat.

197
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:00,699
What about this?

198
00:17:00,699 --> 00:17:03,213
That's to charge our phones?

199
00:17:03,213 --> 00:17:05,598
Four of us, so four ports?

200
00:17:16,143 --> 00:17:18,229
Hey, what are you doing?

201
00:17:18,229 --> 00:17:20,600
Why are you taking that?

202
00:17:22,691 --> 00:17:24,699
Ju Chan Young!

203
00:17:26,862 --> 00:17:29,367
What's this? Can I carry something for you?

204
00:17:29,367 --> 00:17:31,243
No, I just thought it might get cold.

205
00:17:31,243 --> 00:17:33,393
It's okay. Let's go!

206
00:17:42,336 --> 00:17:44,533
It's okay.

207
00:17:59,665 --> 00:18:01,565
Over there.

208
00:18:04,274 --> 00:18:07,529
This is the first time I'm going somewhere with friends.

209
00:18:07,529 --> 00:18:09,448
Really? You've never gone before?

210
00:18:09,448 --> 00:18:10,948
No.

211
00:18:12,366 --> 00:18:14,495
You're in big trouble.

212
00:18:14,495 --> 00:18:16,662
Be sure to stick with me.

213
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:19,831
If we get separated, you'll be lost.

214
00:18:19,831 --> 00:18:21,459
Are you kidding me?

215
00:18:21,459 --> 00:18:23,171
Hold my hand tightly.

216
00:18:23,171 --> 00:18:24,338
If we get separated,

217
00:18:24,338 --> 00:18:27,881
I'll find you, so don't cry and just wait where you are.

218
00:18:27,881 --> 00:18:29,591
Got it?

219
00:18:29,591 --> 00:18:32,284
Don't follow strangers.

220
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,665
We won't be late, right?

221
00:18:35,665 --> 00:18:38,267
It's going to be close.

222
00:18:38,267 --> 00:18:40,978
Ji Yu and Chan Young already arrived.

223
00:18:40,978 --> 00:18:43,313
- Did we get everything?
- Yeah.

224
00:18:43,313 --> 00:18:44,608
I can carry something for you.

225
00:18:44,608 --> 00:18:46,532
No, it's okay.

226
00:18:55,326 --> 00:18:58,286
Hee Su, we need to hurry.

227
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,789
We're screwed.

228
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:02,373
Why?

229
00:19:04,251 --> 00:19:06,219
The telescope.

230
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,982
Are you okay?

231
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:25,004
Don't worry. It'll be there.

232
00:19:26,023 --> 00:19:28,091
Why aren't they coming?

233
00:19:33,938 --> 00:19:37,458
So, how should we sit?

234
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:38,702
I'll sit with you,

235
00:19:38,702 --> 00:19:42,147
and Hee Su and Seung Won can sit together, right?

236
00:19:43,332 --> 00:19:46,965
Won't Hee Su and Seung Won think something's up?

237
00:19:46,965 --> 00:19:49,256
Then you and Seung Won?

238
00:19:49,256 --> 00:19:51,649
That might be better.

239
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:53,608
I don't want that.

240
00:19:55,469 --> 00:19:58,721
So we'll come back that way, too.

241
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,366
What is that...

242
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:10,388
You want to sit with me that badly?

243
00:20:10,388 --> 00:20:13,975
Then, sit with me.

244
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,576
Can I? What about the other guys?

245
00:20:16,576 --> 00:20:20,288
They said they have to go back to the store, so we should go ahead.

246
00:20:20,288 --> 00:20:22,154

Neither is Chan Young. He's ignoring my texts, too.

They're probably asleep.

Yeah...

You're eating again?

You're really going to eat all that?

We're going to eat dinner as soon as we get there.

- Huh?

Can we tell them we lost our food a little bit later?

If we tell them now, don't you think they'll kill me?

They're finally here; let's go.

You'd better confess today.

295
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,940
This is weird. Could the map be wrong?

296
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:04,034
This can't be it, right?

297

Dochon-ri 44-9. This is the right address.

298
00:25:10,826 --> 00:25:15,048
Check again. There must be another place.

299
00:25:16,447 --> 00:25:17,682
Could it be over there?

300
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,514
Huh?

301
00:25:19,514 --> 00:25:23,354
Dochon-ri 44-9?

Not again.

What about Ji Yu? There's only one room here, right?

327
00:26:45,481 --> 00:26:49,548
Just worry about yourself. She washes less than you.

Oh no, no! That's not what I meant.

332
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:26,881
Thank you.

333
00:27:26,881 --> 00:27:29,839
- Thank you.
- 100,000 won.

334
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:32,050
- What?
- 100,000 won for the night.

335
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:34,748
How can this room be 100,000 won?

336
00:27:34,748 --> 00:27:36,814
Then leave.

337
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,368
Wait!

338
00:27:47,373 --> 00:27:48,258
Upfront.

339
00:27:48,258 --> 00:27:50,995
<i>[Sinseong Bank]</i>

340
00:27:54,074 --> 00:27:57,677
Well, we need some food, too.

341
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:01,137
5,000 won.

342
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:03,532
We don't need that much, just four, please.

343
00:28:03,532 --> 00:28:05,465
For one!

344
00:28:06,565 --> 00:28:08,665
The water is free.

345
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,566
Didn't you guys go grocery shopping earlier?

346
00:28:41,431 --> 00:28:42,498
The thing is...

347
00:28:42,498 --> 00:28:46,207
Oh, I accidentally left the groceries in the cab.

348
00:28:46,207 --> 00:28:48,167
I'm sorry, I lost the food.

349
00:28:48,167 --> 00:28:50,698
Oh boy.

350
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:11,565
I'm hungry, let's eat.

351
00:29:11,565 --> 00:29:15,565
Yeah, eat this.

352
00:29:16,824 --> 00:29:19,743
There are so many kinds.

353
00:29:21,618 --> 00:29:24,161
2019?

354
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,600
You like this flavor, right?

355
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:30,432
Yeah.

356
00:29:33,565 --> 00:29:36,365
Well, it's not the worst.

357
00:29:39,598 --> 00:29:42,365
Yeah, well...

358
00:29:42,365 --> 00:29:44,632
It's better than a haunted house.

359
00:29:45,465 --> 00:29:47,602
This isn't too bad...

360
00:29:47,602 --> 00:29:49,812
Let's just eat!

361
00:29:49,812 --> 00:29:51,547
Yeah.

362
00:30:18,719 --> 00:30:22,535
I'll slip away with Chan Young later when the time is right.

363
00:30:23,805 --> 00:30:25,807
Stop sighing!

364
00:30:25,807 --> 00:30:28,242
Today is the day.

365
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,365
But...

366
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,833
Do I have to confess?

367
00:30:38,698 --> 00:30:41,799
How long do you think Chan Young can keep this quiet?

368
00:30:47,723 --> 00:30:50,518
What are they whispering about?

369
00:30:52,834 --> 00:30:55,144
Did you settle things with Seung Won?

370
00:30:56,713 --> 00:30:58,506
Settle what?

371
00:30:58,506 --> 00:31:00,967
You asked whose side I'm on.

372
00:31:00,967 --> 00:31:03,431
Is something going on with him?

373
00:31:03,431 --> 00:31:07,431
No, I just said that. There aren't any sides.

374
00:31:07,431 --> 00:31:10,232
Just forget it.

375
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:17,132
I'm on your side.

376
00:31:17,984 --> 00:31:21,186
But that doesn't mean I'm not on Seung Won's side.

377
00:31:21,832 --> 00:31:24,632
I'm always on your side.

378
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:28,365
Even if you and I fight,

379
00:31:28,365 --> 00:31:30,532
I'm on your side.

380
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:36,565
So, just tell me. You have something to say, right?

381
00:31:36,565 --> 00:31:38,187
Yeah, how did you know?

382
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:40,431
Of course I know. You're so obvious.

383
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:42,165
Hey, I'm not obvious.

384
00:31:42,165 --> 00:31:43,469
Totally obvious.

385
00:31:43,469 --> 00:31:44,846
Whatever, I'm not telling.

386
00:31:44,846 --> 00:31:46,929
Are you pouting?

387
00:31:46,929 --> 00:31:48,931
Never mind.

388
00:31:48,931 --> 00:31:53,686
If you were dating and you kept it from me,

389
00:31:53,686 --> 00:31:55,762
I'd be really upset.

390
00:31:56,439 --> 00:31:59,049
After all, I'm your best friend.

391
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:03,112
Wouldn't Hee Su feel that way?

392
00:32:03,112 --> 00:32:06,331
And Chan Young will want to tell him, too.

393
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:12,821
I'm giving you time to settle things yourself.

394
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:15,792
Your lies.

395
00:32:15,792 --> 00:32:18,060
And your one-sided crush.

396
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,030
Hey, wait for me.

397
00:32:31,057 --> 00:32:32,957
<i>Hurry up.</i>

398
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:35,936
<i>We're almost there.</i>

399
00:32:44,987 --> 00:32:47,755
This is it. We're here.

400
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:15,790
Wow, awesome.

401
00:33:27,864 --> 00:33:30,424
Where did Kim Seung Won go?

402
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,397
He said he's going to look around for a bit.

403
00:33:37,665 --> 00:33:40,190
It's dark and dangerous...

404
00:33:42,712 --> 00:33:46,091
Well, maybe he just needs some alone time.

405
00:33:53,391 --> 00:33:55,424
I like you.

406
00:33:55,424 --> 00:33:57,412
What I'm saying is...

407
00:33:57,412 --> 00:34:02,391
The person I like isn't Ji Yu, but it's actually you.

408
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,986
That's not it...

409
00:34:04,986 --> 00:34:07,369
Ah, I'm sleepy!

410
00:34:09,148 --> 00:34:11,748
How much longer until the shooting star?

411
00:34:12,591 --> 00:34:16,411
It's almost time! It's going to start soon.

412
00:34:17,315 --> 00:34:20,793
Wow, the weather is good. We'll be able to see a lot!

413
00:34:20,793 --> 00:34:23,310
Then I'll go and find Kim Seung Won.

414
00:34:35,381 --> 00:34:36,891
Hey.

415
00:34:36,891 --> 00:34:38,615
I...

416
00:34:39,685 --> 00:34:42,395
I'm going steady with Ji Yu.

417
00:34:44,815 --> 00:34:49,182
It's a secret for now, so pretend you don't know.

418
00:35:00,372 --> 00:35:02,481
Choi Ji Yu...

419
00:35:03,348 --> 00:35:04,835
likes you?

420
00:35:04,835 --> 00:35:06,795
This time...

421
00:35:06,795 --> 00:35:09,489
I'm the one who confessed first.

422
00:35:31,403 --> 00:35:33,739
It's not Choi Ji Yu.

423
00:35:33,739 --> 00:35:35,707
It's you.

424
00:35:48,254 --> 00:35:51,422
Now? Are you ready?

425
00:35:51,422 --> 00:35:53,425
Should I leave with Chan Young?

426
00:35:53,425 --> 00:35:55,143
Yeah.

427
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:02,992
You shouldn't have told me.

428
00:36:07,289 --> 00:36:10,041
You didn't have to tell me.

429
00:36:12,127 --> 00:36:14,820
You should've kept it a secret.

430
00:36:22,853 --> 00:36:24,639
Hey...

431
00:36:30,713 --> 00:36:32,923
<i>Waiting for the moment</i>

432
00:36:32,923 --> 00:36:36,594
<i>for something that wanders through space to disappear to make a wish.</i>

433
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:40,372
<i>Who do people think will fulfill that wish?</i>

434
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,188
<i>The wishes we make,</i>

435
00:36:47,188 --> 00:36:49,814
<i>where do they all go?</i>

436
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,452
Don't follow me.

437
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:04,120
Don't follow me, Chan Young.

438
00:37:06,874 --> 00:37:08,542
Slow down a bit.

439
00:37:08,542 --> 00:37:11,094
You're walking in the dark without a light.

440
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:14,907
Are you going to the bathroom? You in a hurry?

441
00:37:16,233 --> 00:37:18,177
Yeah.

442
00:37:18,177 --> 00:37:20,729
Still, slow down a bit.

443
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:30,022
By any chance, Ji Yu and Chan Young...

444
00:37:30,022 --> 00:37:32,215
Huh? What about them?

445
00:37:33,041 --> 00:37:35,341
Never mind.

446
00:37:35,341 --> 00:37:37,808
Why did you come down here?

447
00:37:37,808 --> 00:37:39,941
Same, bathroom.

448
00:38:06,934 --> 00:38:09,794
I never saw a shooting star before.

449
00:38:17,945 --> 00:38:20,772
Look, there was another one! Did you see it?

450
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:30,599
<i>Actually,</i>

<i>we might be wishing that our wishes vanish, too.</i>

453
