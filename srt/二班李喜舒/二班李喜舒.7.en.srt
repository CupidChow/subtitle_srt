106

You're close, so it might be better not to confess. Right?

166
00:13:42,785 --> 00:13:46,517
You're practically in a fish tank.

167
00:13:46,517 --> 00:13:49,144
This is so frustrating.

168
00:13:49,144 --> 00:13:52,022
I can't believe what Ji Yu's doing.

169
00:13:52,022 --> 00:13:53,941
- No.
- No what?

170
00:13:53,941 --> 00:13:56,292
She's not like that.

171
00:13:56,292 --> 00:13:58,618
Are you defending her right now?

172
00:13:58,618 --> 00:14:02,974
She didn't say anything, did she? Her and Chan...

173
00:14:04,551 --> 00:14:06,090
Just forget it.

174
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:08,185
Seriously.

175
00:14:08,185 --> 00:14:11,685
The rumors about being a diamond spoon and having a bad personality are all lies.

176
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:13,852
You've seen how she is.

177
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:16,839
I've known her for a long time. She even works part-time.

178
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:19,785
She doesn't cause trouble to others,

179
00:14:19,785 --> 00:14:21,385
and does her job well...

180
00:14:21,385 --> 00:14:25,822
How nice. Good for her!

181
00:14:25,822 --> 00:14:28,319
Oh, really!

182
00:14:34,715 --> 00:14:37,317
Planning to break the door?

183
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:43,048
Our youngest is home.

184
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,283
What's wrong with her?

185
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:47,077
A new face appeared.

186
00:14:47,077 --> 00:14:51,999
I think I'm truly falling in love.

187
00:14:51,999 --> 00:14:55,068
I don't even care anymore.

188
00:14:55,068 --> 00:15:00,192
Seriously, he's hands down the best looking ever! Super smart, too.

189
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:02,683
Totally...

190
00:15:02,683 --> 00:15:04,386
Who is that...

191
00:15:04,386 --> 00:15:06,263
That genius guy...

192
00:15:06,263 --> 00:15:09,557
You know, apples.

193
00:15:10,852 --> 00:15:14,518
Jobs, he's totally like Steve Jobs.

194
00:15:15,551 --> 00:15:17,819
But the problem is...

195
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:22,145
He already has a girlfriend.

196
00:15:24,818 --> 00:15:27,418
She's not that great.

197
00:15:27,418 --> 00:15:29,161
I'm better than her.

198
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:31,818
Why doesn't he know that?

199
00:15:31,818 --> 00:15:34,518
How can...

200
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:36,168
nobody know that?

201
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:39,551
Why do you think nobody knows?

202
00:15:39,551 --> 00:15:42,618
Not knowing that is your problem.

203
00:15:42,618 --> 00:15:44,176
Wanna see?

204
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:47,185
Wanna see how amazing I am?

205
00:15:49,585 --> 00:15:52,117
Go and sleep.

206
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:56,346
Go to your room and sleep. I said go to sleep!

207
00:15:58,551 --> 00:16:00,734
What will you show?

208
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,278
What are you going to show?

209
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:07,652
That I'm a really amazing woman.

210
00:16:07,652 --> 00:16:10,585
As you can see, this...

211
00:16:10,585 --> 00:16:11,885
This is how I look.

212
00:16:11,885 --> 00:16:13,485
I'm bright.

213
00:16:13,485 --> 00:16:15,618
I'm smart.

214
00:16:15,618 --> 00:16:17,918
- I'm intelligent!
- Hey!

215
00:16:17,918 --> 00:16:19,920
That's all the same thing.

216
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,189
Anyway, I'm going to show him.

217
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,253
Hee Su, don't learn anything from her. Okay?

218
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:29,154
I'll show him.

219
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:33,785
<i>♪ Happy birthday, dear Dad ♪</i>

220
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:38,105
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

221
00:16:38,105 --> 00:16:40,941
Doesn't he speak really well?

222
00:16:40,941 --> 00:16:44,294
Wow, really. I thought he was an announcer or something.

223
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:47,452
- Hold on, there's a video where he does ABCD.
- ABCD!

224
00:16:47,452 --> 00:16:51,718
Yeah, he already knows the alphabet.

225
00:16:52,885 --> 00:16:55,914
Please, just one semester.

226
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:58,419
Supervise the astronomy club just once a week for one semester.

227
00:16:58,419 --> 00:17:00,652
It doesn't add up to that many times.

228
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:02,785
Instead, I'll do whatever you ask me to do, really.

229
00:17:02,785 --> 00:17:05,090
I don't have anything to ask you to do.

230
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:07,685
Just come to school on time and go home on time.

231
00:17:07,685 --> 00:17:09,387
I don't need anything else.

232
00:17:09,387 --> 00:17:11,855
Oh, come on.

233
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:18,145
Listen, do you even have anyone else?

234
00:17:18,145 --> 00:17:19,985
You know you can't have a club by yourself.

235
00:17:19,985 --> 00:17:21,832
You need at least 6 people.

236
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:25,404
You need to gather five more besides you before I can be an advisor or whatever.

237
00:17:25,404 --> 00:17:29,323
Yes! I'll gather them! I'll gather about 50 people!

238
00:17:29,323 --> 00:17:31,033
- I won't do it.
- Five.

239
00:17:31,033 --> 00:17:33,118
Just five. I'll get them right away.

240
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:34,952
Whatever. Get lost.

241
00:17:34,952 --> 00:17:38,485
Okay! Thank you! I'll be back!

242
00:17:38,485 --> 00:17:41,485
Shin Ho Sik! Shin Ho Sik!

243
00:17:41,485 --> 00:17:42,711
Join another club!

244
00:17:42,711 --> 00:17:45,346
I'm too busy.

245
00:17:45,346 --> 00:17:48,275
It's the astronomy club. You only have to come once a week at night.

246
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,069
Don't do anything. Just show up.

247
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,555
You'll do it, right? I'll fill out your form. Okay?

248
00:17:53,555 --> 00:17:56,615
I'll buy you fried chicken, deal?

249
00:17:56,615 --> 00:17:59,685
Who do you think I am?

250
00:17:59,685 --> 00:18:03,085
Tell me. Who do you think I am?

251
00:18:03,085 --> 00:18:06,877
Do you think I'm some pathetic guy who chases a girl he likes and knits,

252
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:09,652
hangs out at the internet cafe after school with nothing to do,

253
00:18:09,652 --> 00:18:14,326
and just goes along without any dream if someone buys me fried chicken?

254
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:17,162
What? Is this a self-introduction?

255
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:20,685
Sure, you can think that.

256
00:18:20,685 --> 00:18:24,518
But did you ever think maybe I study hard when you're not around,

257
00:18:24,518 --> 00:18:27,130
and I have my own life at night?

258
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:29,148
No.

259
00:18:33,685 --> 00:18:36,255
Right, I don't.

260
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,620
- I won't do it.
- Why not?

261
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:45,485
I have a disease where I can't stay at school after sunset.

262
00:18:45,485 --> 00:18:49,861
If I'm at school after the sun goes down, it hurts.

263
00:18:49,861 --> 00:18:52,688
Plus, I'm loyal to the knitting club.

264
00:18:52,688 --> 00:18:54,918
- Aren't you loyal to me?
- Nope.

265
00:18:54,918 --> 00:18:57,845
- Why are you suddenly acting up?
- What?

266
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:02,040
Why are you suddenly making a fuss about starting a club?

267
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,042
To show.

268
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:07,103
Show what? To whom?

269
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:28,984
How is the recruiting going?

270
00:19:28,984 --> 00:19:31,551
- What?
- The astronomy club.

271
00:19:31,551 --> 00:19:32,863
Did you get some members?

272
00:19:32,863 --> 00:19:35,506
This isn't to show you.

273
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,993
Oh...

274
00:19:37,993 --> 00:19:41,052
Oh, that's not what I meant.

275
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:48,062
All right, check the matchups for the selection round.

276
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:49,451
<i>Yes, Coach!</i>

277
00:19:49,451 --> 00:19:51,423
- Louder!
<i>- Yes, Coach!</i>

278
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:54,218
- There isn't much time left, so work hard.
<i>- Yes, Coach!</i>

279
00:19:54,218 --> 00:19:56,803
Clean up. See you tomorrow. Dismissed!

280
00:19:56,803 --> 00:19:58,652
<i>Yes, Coach! Thank you.</i>

281
00:19:58,652 --> 00:20:00,585
Good job.

282
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:05,979
- Ju Chan Young.
- Yes, coach.

283
00:20:05,979 --> 00:20:09,407
Stay back for a bit. Let's check your serve again.

284
00:20:09,407 --> 00:20:11,985
- Come on.
- Yes, Coach.

285
00:20:35,518 --> 00:20:38,585
Hi. Are you done?

286
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:42,057
Oh, really?

287
00:20:42,057 --> 00:20:44,208
When will you be done?

288
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,441
Did you see this?

289
00:20:51,441 --> 00:20:54,652
Someone put it up in our spot, so I took it down.

290
00:20:54,652 --> 00:20:58,897
Who keeps sticking stuff like this in our spot?

291
00:20:58,897 --> 00:21:01,785
Seriously, no manners. They'd better hope I don't catch them.

292
00:21:01,785 --> 00:21:02,885
Right?

293
00:21:02,885 --> 00:21:04,246
Still...

294
00:21:04,246 --> 00:21:07,352
Really, no manners at all.

295
00:21:08,418 --> 00:21:11,019
Oh, I'll be right back.

296
00:21:17,718 --> 00:21:19,551
It's not like...

297
00:21:19,551 --> 00:21:21,451
we have anything to put up.

298
00:21:21,451 --> 00:21:23,685
She didn't have to remove it.

299
00:21:24,718 --> 00:21:26,485
Should I join, too?

300
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:28,312
We're allowed to do one more.

301
00:21:28,312 --> 00:21:30,147
No, it's okay.

302
00:21:30,147 --> 00:21:33,485
I can get five people today. I've practically got all five.

303
00:21:33,485 --> 00:21:35,652
Oh yeah?

304
00:21:38,618 --> 00:21:40,652
Well...

305
00:21:40,652 --> 00:21:44,752
You're going to study liberal arts. This will be useless for you.

306
00:21:44,752 --> 00:21:47,397
It'll just be a waste of time.

307
00:21:48,248 --> 00:21:51,150
Why is it a waste of time?

308
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:54,653
It's important to you.

309
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:05,599
Yeah...

310
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:08,386
It's important to me.

311
00:22:08,386 --> 00:22:10,518
I know.

312
00:22:10,518 --> 00:22:13,138
I can help.

313
00:22:13,138 --> 00:22:15,233
Just say so.

314
00:22:34,878 --> 00:22:37,213
Hi, what?

315
00:22:37,213 --> 00:22:38,948
Right now?

316
00:22:39,752 --> 00:22:41,485
For an hour?

317
00:22:42,818 --> 00:22:44,752
Okay.

318
00:22:48,308 --> 00:22:49,768
I have to go.

319
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:52,646
- Choi Ji Yu needs help with something.
- What?

320
00:22:52,646 --> 00:22:55,485
Something she's filming.

321
00:22:55,485 --> 00:22:58,401
- Where are you going?
- To her house.

322
00:22:58,401 --> 00:22:59,820
Her house?

323
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,196
What is she filming?

324
00:23:01,196 --> 00:23:02,914
I don't know.

325
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,969
Hey, we have a good camera at my house.

326
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:08,685
I'll bring it. Have her come here.

327
00:23:08,685 --> 00:23:10,119
It's okay. It's nothing that import...

328
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:12,290
Tell her to come here. I'll bring it.

329
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,960
- I said it's okay.
- Why!

330
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,087
Why is she asking you?

331
00:23:17,087 --> 00:23:19,422
I told you she's managing a fish tank.

332
00:23:19,422 --> 00:23:22,241
- No...
- She's...

333
00:23:28,056 --> 00:23:30,366
Look, I'll just bring it.

334
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:55,485
You're home early.

335
00:23:55,485 --> 00:23:57,351
Yeah.

336
00:24:03,752 --> 00:24:06,678
I'm just going to borrow this. I'll bring it right back.

337
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:10,215
It's okay. Take it.

338
00:24:27,418 --> 00:24:28,909
Is something wrong?

339
00:24:28,909 --> 00:24:32,612
No, just go about your business.

340
00:24:43,718 --> 00:24:45,967
You did it again, didn't you?

341
00:24:45,967 --> 00:24:49,012
It's not wrong to like someone.

342
00:24:49,012 --> 00:24:53,508
It's not a crime to tell someone you like them.

343
00:24:53,508 --> 00:24:54,895
He has a girlfriend.

344
00:24:54,895 --> 00:24:57,062
I know.

345
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:59,752
So I only told him.

346
00:24:59,752 --> 00:25:00,753
And?

347
00:25:00,753 --> 00:25:03,785
His girlfriend came after me.

348
00:25:03,785 --> 00:25:05,618
I didn't tell her I liked her.

349
00:25:05,618 --> 00:25:08,518
You should've waited until they broke up.

350
00:25:08,518 --> 00:25:10,116
I'd like to!

351
00:25:10,116 --> 00:25:11,952
Do you think I want to be rejected all the time?

352
00:25:11,952 --> 00:25:14,518
I'm not the neighborhood punching bag!

353
00:25:14,518 --> 00:25:15,956
But I...

354
00:25:15,956 --> 00:25:21,418
I can't hold back. I just can't!

355
00:25:22,376 --> 00:25:25,066
<i>Can't... hold back.</i>

356
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:28,677
<i>You still didn't return the other one you borrowed.</i>

357
00:25:28,677 --> 00:25:30,311
<i>Sorry.</i>

358
00:25:32,013 --> 00:25:35,218
<i>- Should I?
- I don't want that.</i>

359
00:25:35,218 --> 00:25:37,102
<i>Hey, we have a good camera at my house.</i>

360
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:39,996
<i>Tell her to come here. I'll bring it.</i>

361
00:25:47,654 --> 00:25:48,822
That's crazy.

362
00:25:48,822 --> 00:25:50,540
What?

363
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:54,553
Me?

364
00:25:58,518 --> 00:26:00,474
Hey.

365
00:26:01,485 --> 00:26:03,377
Me?!

366
00:26:04,752 --> 00:26:07,385
Did you just say I'm crazy?!

367
00:26:14,013 --> 00:26:15,849
How about this?

368
00:26:15,849 --> 00:26:17,662
Not that great? Should I just wear the other one?

369
00:26:17,662 --> 00:26:19,628
Oh, come on!

370
00:26:21,396 --> 00:26:23,406
Okay, okay.

371
00:26:26,229 --> 00:26:27,486
Does my face look all right?

372
00:26:27,486 --> 00:26:29,863
Yeah. This is the first round of the audition?

373
00:26:29,863 --> 00:26:31,295
Yeah.

374
00:26:31,295 --> 00:26:34,492
The second round is the judges, and performances start from the third.

375
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:37,677
Why did you call me instead of your boyfriend?

376
00:26:37,677 --> 00:26:39,529
My boyfriend?

377
00:26:39,529 --> 00:26:43,960
You mean the boyfriend I have to date secretly because of you?

378
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,494
Well...

379
00:26:46,262 --> 00:26:47,964
What secret? Everyone who needs to know already knows.

380
00:26:47,964 --> 00:26:50,558
My sentiments exactly.

381
00:26:57,229 --> 00:26:59,767
You know Hee Su knows, right?

382
00:27:04,564 --> 00:27:06,496
You've seen how he's been treating me. Right?

383
00:27:06,496 --> 00:27:09,429
It's because he still thinks you like me.

384
00:27:09,429 --> 00:27:11,115
Sort it out.

385
00:27:11,115 --> 00:27:14,999
Confess your feelings or let them go.

386
00:27:16,195 --> 00:27:18,396
About that...

387
00:27:19,396 --> 00:27:22,023
You chose natural sciences.

388
00:27:28,755 --> 00:27:31,529
I heard you're recruiting for a club.

389
00:27:31,529 --> 00:27:34,295
- Yeah.
- Where's the application form?

390
00:27:34,295 --> 00:27:35,512
You want to join?

391
00:27:35,512 --> 00:27:37,555
I heard you need people.

392
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:39,763
You need five.

393
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:45,438
Hey, Kim Seung Won.

394
00:27:45,438 --> 00:27:47,362
Did you tell her?

395
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,559
Yeah.

396
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,576
Do you even know what it is?

397
00:27:58,576 --> 00:28:00,870
Yeah, the astronomy club.

398
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:03,790
Looking at stars. Right?

399
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:06,751
What's going on? What are you doing?

400
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:09,362
She's applying to natural sciences.

401
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:12,966
Did you ask her?

402
00:28:12,966 --> 00:28:16,553
- It wasn't like it was a favor...
- Can't he ask?

403
00:28:16,553 --> 00:28:18,430
You need people and I owe...

404
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,563
Exactly!

405
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,979
Are you helping him

406
00:28:25,979 --> 00:28:28,523
so you can just call him anytime you need him?

407
00:28:28,523 --> 00:28:30,441
Hey, what's wrong with you?

408
00:28:30,441 --> 00:28:32,429
Don't you think it's strange?

409
00:28:32,429 --> 00:28:35,004
She's only using Kim Seung Won when she needs something.

410
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:37,462
She's managing a fish tank when the person she's seeing is...

411
00:28:37,462 --> 00:28:38,950
Kim Seung Won, you'd better speak up.

412
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,410
It's not her fault.

413
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:42,328
She can't help it if Kim Seung Won likes her.

414
00:28:42,328 --> 00:28:45,195
It's not like that. Stop it.

415
00:28:45,195 --> 00:28:48,752
- I hate that you like my girlfriend.
- Hey...

416
00:28:48,752 --> 00:28:53,397
Kim Seung Won, you know. Right? That I'm dating Ji Yu?

417
00:28:54,883 --> 00:28:56,759
Hey, Ju Chan Young.

418
00:28:58,663 --> 00:29:01,013
You selfish bastard.

419
00:29:05,059 --> 00:29:07,427
What's his problem?

420
00:29:07,427 --> 00:29:10,162
What's going on? What's this strange vibe?

421
00:29:12,066 --> 00:29:16,078
Hey, what's going on? What is it?

422
00:29:40,762 --> 00:29:42,663
You okay?

423
00:29:48,394 --> 00:29:50,254
Sorry.

424
00:29:51,195 --> 00:29:53,483
What are you sorry about? I'm the one who's sorry.

425
00:29:53,483 --> 00:29:55,985
I was going to tell you about Ji Yu and Chan Young, but...

426
00:29:55,985 --> 00:29:59,155
It's okay. Really.

427
00:29:59,155 --> 00:30:01,340
It doesn't matter.

428
00:30:02,951 --> 00:30:05,152
Are you okay?

429
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:10,730
Yes.

430
00:30:14,837 --> 00:30:17,364
<i>It's a complete mess.</i>

431
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:34,192
You're coming home early these days. Aren't you seeing Jong Gu?

432
00:30:34,192 --> 00:30:35,704
Forget him.

433
00:30:35,704 --> 00:30:38,093
What do you think of this?

434
00:30:41,281 --> 00:30:43,091
What the...

435
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:49,332
We broke up. It's partly your fault.

436
00:30:49,332 --> 00:30:53,501
Shouldn't you at least buy me dinner? Or a drink?

437
00:30:53,501 --> 00:30:55,902
Oh boy, what should I do?

438
00:30:56,838 --> 00:30:57,924
Oh, don't!

439
00:30:57,924 --> 00:30:59,051
Who is it?

440
00:30:59,051 --> 00:31:01,117
A new guy.

441
00:31:05,346 --> 00:31:08,225
<i>I hate Choi Ji Yu.</i>

442
00:31:08,225 --> 00:31:10,860
<i>And I'm mad at Chan Young.</i>

443
00:31:11,644 --> 00:31:14,147
<i>But no matter how much I think about it,</i>

444
00:31:14,147 --> 00:31:17,084
<i>I can't find a good reason.</i>

445
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:18,902
<i>Hee Su!</i>

446
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:21,370
<i>Let's go.</i>

447
00:31:24,407 --> 00:31:25,576
<i>Slow down a bit.</i>

448
00:31:25,576 --> 00:31:28,576
<i>Look, there's another one! Did you see it?</i>

449
00:31:37,801 --> 00:31:40,381
<i>There are plenty...</i>

450
00:31:40,381 --> 00:31:42,858
<i>of unreasonable reasons.</i>

451
00:31:44,427 --> 00:31:46,679
<i>But ignoring them...</i>

452
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:48,814
<i>is no use.</i>

453
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:16,959
Why did you bring that?

454
00:32:16,959 --> 00:32:20,854
To show everyone later tonight. Club promotion.

455
00:32:22,773 --> 00:32:24,657
Good things...

456
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:27,419
You can tell when you see them.

457
00:32:40,983 --> 00:32:42,116
Excuse me.

458
00:32:42,116 --> 00:32:45,350
Is this where we can see stars?

459
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,782
Yeah, that's right.

460
00:32:46,782 --> 00:32:48,250
Just stay here?

461
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,649
Yeah, just a minute.

462
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:56,340
There, take a look.

463
00:33:01,016 --> 00:33:03,516
Let me see, too.

464
00:33:06,717 --> 00:33:09,387
What you're seeing now is Jupiter.

465
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:11,848
Today, you can also see Saturn.

466
00:33:11,848 --> 00:33:13,717
Excuse me for a sec.

467
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:22,566
There, take another look.

468
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:29,665
Can I see, too?

469
00:33:31,033 --> 00:33:32,935
I'll wait my turn.

470
00:33:39,416 --> 00:33:41,276
All set.

471
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:48,550
What you're seeing now is Lyra.

472
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:51,749
The bright star up top is Vega.

473
00:33:51,749 --> 00:33:55,182
It's the brightest star you can see in summer.

474
00:33:56,851 --> 00:34:01,438
Then what's that ring-like thing in between?

475
00:34:02,283 --> 00:34:04,033
You can see that?

476
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,717
Yeah, look.

477
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:14,067
This usually isn't visible.

478
00:34:14,067 --> 00:34:15,746
That's called the Ring Nebula.

479
00:34:15,746 --> 00:34:18,313
It's the remnants of a dead star.

480
00:34:19,999 --> 00:34:22,449
A star dies?

481
00:34:22,449 --> 00:34:24,753
Then what happens next?

482
00:34:26,672 --> 00:34:30,134
What happens after a star dies?

483
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:33,684
Is that it?

484
00:34:34,513 --> 00:34:37,016
Does it completely vanish?

485
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:41,916
<i>What happens next is...</i>

486
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:45,891
<i>the remnants of the star disperses in space.</i>

487
00:34:46,693 --> 00:34:49,362
<i>Some wander in space forever,</i>

488
00:34:49,362 --> 00:34:51,697
<i>some vanish,</i>

489
00:34:51,697 --> 00:34:53,949
<i>and some...</i>

490
00:34:54,583 --> 00:34:56,976
<i>become new stars.</i>

491
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:03,251
<i>Even after the feeling of liking someone ends,</i>

492
00:35:03,251 --> 00:35:06,503
<i>some of it remains as a memory,</i>

493
00:35:07,217 --> 00:35:09,784
<i>some is forgotten,</i>

494
00:35:09,784 --> 00:35:12,100
<i>and some...</i>

495
00:35:13,219 --> 00:35:15,821
