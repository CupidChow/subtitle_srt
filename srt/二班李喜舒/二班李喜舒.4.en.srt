Her. Dokgo Hee Won.

You've been dutifully replying, you weirdo.

142
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:22,462
I know. I somehow always
know the menu. Incredible, right?

143
00:10:22,462 --> 00:10:23,898
Put that effort into studying.

144
00:10:23,898 --> 00:10:27,601
That's a different matter.
This is a natural instinct.

145
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:32,298
Look at this.
She asked me stuff like this too.

146

- I really...
- What about you?

- Hi, Chan Young.
- About the tournament...

151
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:55,554
Yes, do you think I can enter?

152
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:58,495
You just picked up
your racket again recently.

153
00:10:58,495 --> 00:11:01,852
I've been training really hard lately,
and my condition's improved a lot.

154
00:11:01,852 --> 00:11:04,605
It's in July, so I've got time...

155
00:11:04,605 --> 00:11:08,692
Just last week, you didn't
want to be in the tennis club.

156
00:11:08,692 --> 00:11:10,736
Why the sudden change of heart?

157
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:14,362
Chan Young, take it slow.

158
00:11:14,362 --> 00:11:16,529
Don't push yourself.

159
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:27,503
Okay, okay. I'll ask the coach.

160
00:11:27,503 --> 00:11:30,673
But it's not up to us.
You have to make the cut.

161
00:11:30,673 --> 00:11:32,295
You have to do well.

162
00:11:32,295 --> 00:11:34,884
Yes, of course.

163
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:43,568

164
00:11:46,055 --> 00:11:49,566

00:12:02,446 --> 00:12:04,450
[But I'm not planning to confess.]

167
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:07,759
[So whoever you are,
I'd appreciate you ignoring it.]

168
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:12,494
<i>You can't see the far side
of the moon from Earth.</i>

169
00:12:12,494 --> 00:12:17,429
<i>The only part visible from Earth is its near side.</i>

170
00:12:18,153 --> 00:12:22,774
<i>But just because you can't see it
doesn't mean it doesn't exist.</i>

171
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:28,162
<i>There are things that exist but can't be seen.</i>

172
00:12:29,481 --> 00:12:32,449
<i>Like feelings...</i>

173
00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:35,804
<i>that we tightly conceal
and don't want to reveal.</i>

174
00:12:46,362 --> 00:12:48,529
Drive safely.

175
00:13:15,527 --> 00:13:17,154
Hey.

176
00:13:17,154 --> 00:13:18,530
You're still up?

177
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:21,891
Yeah, I was just getting
some air on the rooftop.

178
00:13:23,994 --> 00:13:26,362
Did you see me come home?

179
00:13:26,362 --> 00:13:28,095
Yeah.

180
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:32,829
So, I did work late, but...

181
00:13:37,508 --> 00:13:39,635
Don't tell your sisters.

182
00:13:39,635 --> 00:13:42,437
They'll just have a fit.

183
00:13:42,437 --> 00:13:43,931
Got it.

184
00:13:43,931 --> 00:13:46,184
I'm not getting back together with Hyo Seok.

185
00:13:46,184 --> 00:13:48,418
Do whatever you want.

186
00:13:51,228 --> 00:13:53,062
I mean...

187
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:56,518
It's alright to do what you want.

188
00:13:59,562 --> 00:14:01,448
I'm going to bed.

189
00:14:01,448 --> 00:14:02,924
Yeah.

190
00:14:25,295 --> 00:14:26,307
Hey, what?

191
00:14:26,307 --> 00:14:29,459
Will you go with me to meet
a secondhand dealer later?

192
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,230
No.

193
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:33,262
<i>Can't you come with me?
I'm scared.</i>

194
00:14:33,262 --> 00:14:34,873
You're scarier.

195
00:14:34,873 --> 00:14:37,008
<i>Come on, go with me!</i>

196
00:14:43,815 --> 00:14:50,460
[What are you doing tonight? Around 9?]

197
00:14:58,862 --> 00:15:00,796
So Hee!

198
00:15:05,929 --> 00:15:08,057
Is it...

199
00:15:08,057 --> 00:15:09,775
You?

200
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,743
What?

201
00:15:12,743 --> 00:15:15,513
The one sending me messages.

202
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,826
What messages?

203
00:15:19,826 --> 00:15:21,844
You really don't know?

204
00:15:22,738 --> 00:15:24,531
Yeah.

205
00:15:24,531 --> 00:15:27,158
I really don't know.

206
00:15:29,536 --> 00:15:31,537
Fine.

207
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:39,316
Hee Su.

208
00:15:42,216 --> 00:15:44,509
What messages?

209
00:15:45,469 --> 00:15:49,097
Is it someone confessing to you?

210
00:15:49,948 --> 00:15:51,642
Listen.

211
00:15:51,642 --> 00:15:55,020
Things like that
should be said face-to-face.

212
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,647
You should stop too.

213
00:15:56,647 --> 00:15:58,399
If you have something to say, say it directly.

214
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,569
Isn't it cowardly
to do it secretly like that??

215
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,562
See? I told you.
I'm a hundred percent sure.

216
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:24,425
Should I call her? Right now?

217
00:16:24,425 --> 00:16:26,971
No, what would you even say?

218
00:16:26,971 --> 00:16:30,556
Sis, are you meeting your ex?
Is that what you'll say?

219
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:34,549
Who goes to the office
dressed up like that, huh?

220
00:16:34,549 --> 00:16:36,353
I don't know.
I've never been to an office...

221
00:16:36,353 --> 00:16:39,165
Trust me, nobody does.

222
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,569
It's definitely a date with an ex.

223
00:16:41,569 --> 00:16:43,445
Hee Jeong is going to act all crazy again.

224
00:16:43,445 --> 00:16:46,611
- Stop it!
- Jeez, you scared me.

225
00:16:47,657 --> 00:16:50,701
Why do you keep doubting her
when she said it's not?

226
00:16:50,701 --> 00:16:52,663
If she says it's not,
just take her word for it.

227
00:16:52,663 --> 00:16:56,264
If she says she's working late,
just believe it. Can't you do that?

228
00:16:56,264 --> 00:16:58,116
Hey.

229
00:16:58,116 --> 00:17:00,435
Do you like Hyo Seok?

230
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:03,622
I knew it. Just because he gave you
allowance a few times.

231
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:05,799
You're a traitor.

232
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:07,801
Where are you going?!

233
00:17:07,801 --> 00:17:09,786
What's up with him?

234
00:17:13,316 --> 00:17:15,382
This is it, right?

235
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:18,980
Yeah.

236
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:22,316
- Let's go!
- Wait, wait, wait!

237
00:17:22,316 --> 00:17:24,067
What?

238
00:17:24,067 --> 00:17:26,815
Well...

239
00:17:28,316 --> 00:17:31,283
What if it's a suspicious person?

240
00:17:34,703 --> 00:17:37,540
Should I just go and get it?

241
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:40,792
No, I need to see it first.

242
00:17:40,792 --> 00:17:44,797
Then let's hurry up and go.

243
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,133
Wait...

244
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:50,179
Hey! Haven't you heard
about human trafficking, huh?

245
00:17:50,179 --> 00:17:51,805
Or organ trafficking?

246
00:17:51,805 --> 00:17:57,250
They take your kidneys and liver.
Are you sure?

247
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,570
Wait...

248
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:00,200
(speech) Hey.

249
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:12,006
Can I try playing it?

250
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:23,068
Thank you.

251
00:18:35,222 --> 00:18:36,390
Okay, then...

252
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,435
You're leaving like that?

253
00:18:37,435 --> 00:18:40,268
Yes. What?

254
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:44,832
Well, you're kids and you came all this way.

255
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,525
It feels wrong to just let you go.

256
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:48,316
What are you saying...

257
00:18:48,316 --> 00:18:49,989
It's already late, so...

258
00:18:49,989 --> 00:18:51,746
Run!

259
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:17,670
♫ <i></i> ♫

260
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:32,970
♫ <i></i> ♫

261
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:37,416
Chan Young, stop running now.

262
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:40,829
Hey, didn't you say you weren't scared?

263
00:19:40,829 --> 00:19:43,510
You said it was organ trafficking.

264
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:56,810
♫ <i></i> ♫

265
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,097
Come on.

266
00:20:00,097 --> 00:20:02,864
I'll buy you ice cream.

267
00:20:02,864 --> 00:20:07,922
We almost got our kidneys sold,
and you're brushing it off with ice cream?

268
00:20:07,922 --> 00:20:12,593
If I win the audition prize,
I'll buy you something better.

269
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:16,830
So you're doing it?

270
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:19,701
Yeah, for now.

271
00:20:19,701 --> 00:20:22,919
Sounds fun.

272
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:24,706
You're going to be famous now.

273
00:20:24,706 --> 00:20:27,324
I wouldn't go that far.

274
00:20:27,324 --> 00:20:29,818
Didn't you say you were competing too?

275
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:34,674
I have to make the cut first.

276
00:20:34,674 --> 00:20:37,142
I've been out of practice for too long.

277
00:20:39,374 --> 00:20:41,522
I'll come cheer you on.

278
00:20:43,074 --> 00:20:46,519
That would settle everything
for tonight, right?

279
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:09,208
You punk! How many times
have I told you not to scare the kids?

280
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:13,922
Look, they were kids and it was late.

281
00:21:13,922 --> 00:21:16,341
I thought I should give them a ride.

282
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:20,222
If the cops come again, you should explain.

283
00:21:20,222 --> 00:21:22,941
- Jeez...
- Just quit selling used items directly, man.

284
00:21:22,941 --> 00:21:25,350
Fine, I'll switch to a used-goods platform.

285
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,145
My back hurts as it is.

286
00:21:27,145 --> 00:21:29,312
Baldie, you do it.

287
00:22:09,936 --> 00:22:12,438
No, this way!

288
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:19,420
Hey. You should've come earlier.

289
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:23,424
What's up with him?

290
00:22:25,503 --> 00:22:31,075
Apparently, he was out training
by himself since dawn.

291
00:22:31,075 --> 00:22:34,309
It's not like you're trying out
for the Olympics or the national team.

292
00:22:34,309 --> 00:22:39,507
You know how kids
who get bad grades suddenly overdo it?

293
00:22:39,507 --> 00:22:42,376
They pull all-nighters, then sleep
through class the next day.

294
00:22:42,376 --> 00:22:43,742
Shut up.

295
00:22:43,742 --> 00:22:47,942
That's totally you right now.
How long can you keep this up?

296
00:22:53,342 --> 00:22:55,856
Jeez!

297
00:22:55,856 --> 00:22:59,118
What's the problem?
Why is he acting like this?

298
00:23:09,309 --> 00:23:12,290
<i>If someone tells him I like him...</i>

299
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,809
<i>Would Chan Young believe them?</i>

300
00:23:24,527 --> 00:23:27,155
Hurry. We're playing soccer
with class 4, remember?

301
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:29,616
All done, all done.

302
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:31,310
I don't want to play.

303
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:34,454
You have to play.
We have the exact number of players.

304
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:37,075
Hey, bailing last minute is bad manners.

305
00:23:37,075 --> 00:23:39,109
I won't play.

306
00:23:40,009 --> 00:23:41,795
You can't do that!

307
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:44,009
Find someone else.

308
00:23:44,842 --> 00:23:47,050
You didn't even ask me.
I never said I'd play.

309
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:50,537
- That's 'cause you're Chan Young's shadow.
- Don't say that.

310
00:23:50,537 --> 00:23:52,505
Just cut it out.

311
00:23:56,918 --> 00:23:59,294
Did I say something wrong?

312
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:05,276
<i>Even if someone tells him,
it's okay if Chan Young doesn't believe it.</i>

313
00:24:05,276 --> 00:24:08,223
<i>As long as he believes...</i>

314
00:24:08,223 --> 00:24:11,722
<i>that I don't like him like that.</i>

315
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,397
Why is he sulking?

316
00:24:17,397 --> 00:24:19,376
I don't know.

317
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:21,109
Let's go.

318
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:24,788
We lost because we didn't have our ace player.

319
00:24:24,788 --> 00:24:27,448
We can't win without Hee Su, right?

320
00:24:27,448 --> 00:24:30,902
Totally, that's right.

321
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,556
Hey, wanna go
to the Internet cafe after school?

322
00:24:35,556 --> 00:24:37,642
Chan Young's paying.

323
00:24:39,042 --> 00:24:41,437
It's his treat.

324
00:24:41,437 --> 00:24:43,075
I have plans after school.

325
00:24:43,075 --> 00:24:45,049
Where are you going?

326
00:24:47,151 --> 00:24:48,586
I have a blind date today.

327
00:24:48,586 --> 00:24:49,781
A blind date?

328
00:24:49,781 --> 00:24:51,280

No.
