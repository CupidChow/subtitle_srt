1
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,070
Chief Qiu.

2
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,280
Can we just talk business?

3
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,390
Why do we have to keep playing ping-pong?

4
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,120
Just a few swings and the deal's done.

5
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,110
As I said, I won't go easy on you today.

6
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:34,150
Come on.

7
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:34,680
Catch it.

8
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,110
About Zhang Haoyang...

9
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,850
I heard your team has detained him?

10
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:44,420
Did you get enough grounds?

11
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,800
I don't want this
to end up as excessive force.

12
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,310
Lian Haiping says it's sufficient,

13
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:53,570
then it definitely is.

14
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,970
Who could be more meticulous than him?

15
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,070
Lian Haiping applied to search

16
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,840
Zhang Haoyang's house and car.

17
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:05,610
But his house and car

18
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,390
are under his dad's name.

19
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,200
The situation is a bit sensitive.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,660
What's so sensitive about it?

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,920
Last time, Zhang Haoyang

22
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,920
lied about what happened
when he saw Shen Xiaozhou

23
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,000
on the day of incident.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,400
The trruth is they had a conflict.

25
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,640
Zhang Haoyang was emotionally agitated,

26
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,700
very likely followed Shen Xiaozhou.

27
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,690
We had solid grounds to investigate him.

28
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:33,289
So it's not sensitive at all.

29
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,000
Let's continue.

30
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,229
I'm about to win.

31
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,729
I'll go sign the papers.

32
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:43,590
Let's play one more shot! Come on!

33
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,350
[Beneath the Undertow]

34
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,940
[Episode 8]

35
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,720
This place's way too clean!

36
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,170
Was it just renovated?

37
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,310
Is it a show house?

38
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:42,110
Guys, let's see
who's got the skills today.

39
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,150
Focus on the bathroom, right?

40
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,400
Guo told us

41
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,630
to check all surfaces,

42
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,560
crevices,

43
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,030
and collect whatever we can.

44
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,680
If we really can't reach something,

45
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,079
we might need
to apply to dismantle the car.

46
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,420
Take photos of this area.

47
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,150
And here too.

48
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,310
Check if there are any sedatives.

49
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,600
Got it.

50
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,870
What kind of mdes are these?

51
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,200
They're all in English.

52
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,600
Antidepressants.

53
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:49,930
You even know this?

54
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,390
He's depressed?

55
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,430
He lives in a such a big house,
what's there to be depressed about?

56
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:09,830
Tweezers.

57
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:20,750
Dismantle it.

58
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:21,750
Do it.

59
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,970
Not even a single fingerprint.

60
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,000
It's been cleaned thoroughly.

61
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,430
No hair or clothing fibers.

62
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,190
You'd think this car was factory new.

63
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,070
Is this a headscarf?

64
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,800
It looks like a designer brand.

65
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,390
Why was it stuffed inside a pillow?

66
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,320
Sleeping with it against his face?

67
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,010
Zhang Haoyang
must've seen her again after that.

68
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,880
This...

69
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,630
this is the evidence!

70
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,560
We've got it.

71
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,890
We've got it.

72
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,320
It's changing color.

73
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,430
It's blood.

74
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,040
June 19th, 3:23 PM.

75
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,750
After you parted ways

76
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,070
at Southern University
of Science and Technology

77
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,200
with Shen Xiaozhou,

78
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,280
did you see her again?

79
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,310
Think carefully before answering.

80
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:46,950
No.

81
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,430
I wish I had.

82
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,750
Where did you get this headscarf?

83
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,100
How did you get it?

84
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,920
We found it inside your pillow.

85
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,310
I thought you found hers.

86
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,190
What do you mean?

87
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,120
This isn't hers?

88
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,450
If you know something, spit it out now.

89
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,160
Or it'll only get worse.

90
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,040
I gave this to her.

91
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,240
She only tried it on once,

92
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,360
then gave it back to me.

93
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,360
I know there's some of her hair in it.

94
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,600
Please don't lose it.

95
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,840
What about the one she wore?

96
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,510
That one was bought at a night market.

97
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,640
It only cost 10 yuan.

98
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,560
She didn't care about brands,

99
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,950
just liked that style.

100
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,360
So I bought her a real one.

101
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,810
When she found out it cost over 2,000,

102
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,040
she just refused to wear it,

103
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,240
and gave it back to me.

104
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,510
We found blood

105
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:48,390
in the drain

106
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,430
of your bathtub.

107
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,510
I... I don't know.

108
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,409
Maybe it's mine?

109
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:57,340
Is it yours?

110
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,540
I can see you're in pain.

111
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,740
If you lost control

112
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,680
and hurt Shen Xiaozhou,

113
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,770
it would be better to confess now.

114
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,120
If you want to throw me in jail,

115
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,390
or shoot me, go ahead.

116
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,560
But even if I killed myself,

117
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,720
I'd never harm Shen Xiaozhou!

118
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,800
There are two headscarves.

119
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,680
That's too much of a coincidence.

120
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,600
No way, right?

121
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,120
His logic is completely consistent,

122
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,789
with no contradictions.

123
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,240
So what now?

124
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,370
We need to verify one thing.

125
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:40,440
Was Shen Xiaozhou
wearing the 2,000-yuan headscarf,

126
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,669
or the 10-yuan one?

127
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:44,080
Shen Xiaozhou was so frugal,

128
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,010
would she really return something
worth 2,000 yuan?

129
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,670
Being frugal means saving her own money,

130
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,440
not someone else's.

131
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,800
Then let's ask her parents.

132
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,270
They wouldn't tell the difference.

133
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,330
Go ask Yue Chunxia.

134
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:00,120
We're not waiting for Guo's test results?

135
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:03,360
The blood's likely Zhang Haoyang's.

136
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,440
If it were Shen Xiaozhou's,

137
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,600
he would've confessed just now.

138
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,630
What would you gentlemen like to order?

139
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,320
Fried noodles.

140
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,080
Fried rice noodles.

141
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,630
Okay.

142
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,090
Would you like any drinks?

143
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,350
Cola, please.

144
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,030
Got it.

145
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,010
What would you three like to order?

146
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:44,610
Catch him!

147
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,000
Don't... don't hit me!

148
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I have hepatitis.

149
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,540
Are you Sha Hongli?

150
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,850
No, I thought you were Sha Hongli's men.

151
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,350
Captain Lian,

152
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:01,790
Chunxia's sick.

153
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,460
She's been in bed all day,

154
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,860
barely eating anything.

155
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:06,390
Maybe you could come here another time?

156
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,520
We just need to ask her a few questions.

157
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,720
She's very weak

158
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,670
and dizzy.

159
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,440
Can we let her rest,

160
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,720
and do this another day?

161
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,650
This headscarf isn't Xiaozhou's.

162
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:21,910
This one is real.

163
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,220
Xiaozhou's was bought
at a night market,

164
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,170
even its logo was misspelled.

165
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:29,210
Are you sure?

166
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,380
She didn't want to wear the real one,

167
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:36,270
said the real one
felt too heavy on her head.

168
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:38,970
Silly girl.

169
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,580
Quick, get inside and lie down.

170
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,320
Please don't push her.

171
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,720
She really can't take it.

172
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:55,370
Sorry, Captain Lian.

173
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,060
Take care.

174
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,270
Officer.

175
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,330
Wait a moment.

176
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:10,720
Did you catch that
"Making Gold From the Ground" guy?

177
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:11,750
Who?

178
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,840
That illegal fundraiser guy

179
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,360
who took all our money,

180
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,610
and scammed us all!

181
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,200
I heard he fled to Australia.

182
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,460
Can you bring him back?

183
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,320
They're from
Criminal Investigation Department,

184
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,720
and your case is a financial crime.

185
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,320
Why are you asking them about this?

186
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,120
I'm very sorry

187
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,380
for wasting your time.

188
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,080
Goodbye.

189
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,650
Director Yue.

190
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,390
On June 19th, the night of the incident,

191
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,120
did you go out?

192
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,790
Have you seen

193
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,720
anyone suspicious nearby?

194
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:41,060
No, I was at home that night.

195
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,650
I was watching TV, right?

196
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:44,730
I can't really remember.

197
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,060
June 19th...

198
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,590
Alright, sorry to bother you. Goodbye.

199
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,530
Goodbye.

200
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:07,070
Why did you ask Yue Hongbing?

201
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:11,310
The morning
when Yue Hongbing was injured by Guang,

202
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,150
according to the report,

203
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:18,000
he was washing his car outside his house.

204
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:24,320
You think he used his car
the night before?

205
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,510
But he's got no motive.

206
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,670
Maybe I'm overthinking.

207
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,120
What's wrong with me
asking about the case?

208
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,510
Why can't I ask?

209
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,360
Aren't they all police officers?

210
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,420
They definitely know more than we do.

211
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,650
I'll go make Chunxia a poached egg.

212
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,270
You're such a pathetic factory director.

213
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,270
It's not worth it.

214
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:08,030
All the directors before you

215
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,890
ran the place when it was booming.

216
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,270
But look at you,

217
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,790
you took over
when everything was falling apart.

218
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,790
You didn't even get the chance
to do anything

219
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,850
before it shut down.

220
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,850
You're just there to take the blame,

221
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:20,320
yet you still act all "low-key."

222
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,750
You won't even move out of this dump.

223
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,660
Does anyone appreciate that?

224
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,670
Who are you putting on this show for?

225
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,010
They call you Director Yue.

226
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:32,080
What's the point
of calling you Director Yue?

227
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,150
It's useless!

228
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:34,870
I'm sorry...

229
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,980
for making you suffer.

230
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,330
Good, at least you know.

231
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,790
We searched Zhang Haoyang's store,

232
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,820
but didn't find anything.

233
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,510
What about his car?

234
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,510
We checked it a second time,

235
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,000
and still no sign of Shen Xiaozhou.

236
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,910
The DNA results from the blood

237
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:05,750
also came in.

238
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,710
It shows it's Zhang Haoyang's own blood.

239
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,360
I'm telling you,
it must be Zhang Haoyang.

240
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,790
His car and house were way too clean.

241
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:14,790
It's too unusual.

242
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,930
It seems like he's hiding something.

243
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,550
He had the car washed

244
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:20,080
as part of scheduled maintenance.

245
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,680
The 4S shop has records of it.

246
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,070
And his house was clean...

247
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,030
because

248
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,720
they deep-clean it every three days.

249
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,360
It's always been their routine.

250
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,720
For a wealthy family like that,

251
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,690
it-it's pretty normal, right?

252
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,960
So there are no loopholes, no evidence,

253
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,150
right?

254
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,050
Even there's no evidence,

255
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,200
we still can't rule him out as a suspect.

256
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,240
One of the witnesses lied.

257
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:53,310
How did Zhang Haoyang
get that wound on his hand?

258
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,120
He was drunk and cut himself by a bottle,

259
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,430
or they wouldn't let him leave.

260
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,960
Actually, that's not true.

261
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,930
They coordinated their story.

262
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,310
Why?

263
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:06,890
Yeah, I thought that guy
was the most reliable one.

264
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,280
But now, it looks like

265
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,850
all those rich kids
may give false testimony.

266
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,300
Why don't we bring them in,

267
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,840
put pressure on them one by one?

268
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,270
Maybe we'll find a new breakthrough.

269
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,720
They'll just come up with another excuse.

270
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,720
They'll say they lied
to protect Zhang Haoyang's reputation,

271
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,980
or claim they were too drunk to remember.

272
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:28,050
We won't get anything useful out of them.

273
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,600
Let him go.

274
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:33,450
We can arrest him again
once we've got the evidence.

275
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,040
Sorry for the trouble.

276
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:36,890
Can I get the headscarf back?

277
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,990
If it's not Shen Xiaozhou's, yes.

278
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,930
What about the hair?

279
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,360
Sorry, we already used it for testing.

280
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:52,800
Let's go!

281
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:04,150
Oh right, that day Xiaozhou may...

282
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:06,270
What is it?

283
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:08,970
She wasn't in a good mood.

284
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,150
I don't know, she just seemed upset.

285
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,710
Let's go. This is embarrassing enough!

286
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,440
This is where I found the car.

287
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:47,120
It's been parked here for a few days
with no one claiming it,

288
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,210
so I started it and drove away.

289
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:50,980
Oh right,

290
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,080
I found a bank card inside.

291
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:02,160
If Sha Hongli fled by boat,

292
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,730
then the plane ticket was just a decoy.

293
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,109
Maybe he didn't go anywhere.

294
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,810
Maybe he's already been silenced.

295
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,089
Leaving the car here

296
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,079
was to make sure we'd find it.

297
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,569
He's the manager,
who would want him dead?

298
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:22,050
Keep investigating.

299
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:29,350
Shu's been really well-behaved lately.

300
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:32,010
He hasn't gone out
except for tutoring classes.

301
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,920
And he has finished all his homework,

302
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,230
even helped his grandparents with chores.

303
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:40,560
I heard he can even
change light bulbs now.

304
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,160
I'll be free tomorrow, so I'll visit him.

305
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,270
Shu, are you waiting for us here?

306
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,590
Why is he here too?

307
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,790
Don't talk like that.

308
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,070
I don't want to see him.

309
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,590
Forget it.

310
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,400
You go up first.

311
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,250
I'll go up and scold him.

312
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:56,900
Hello, sir.

313
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,830
Are you here to see Shu?

314
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:02,880
Yes, he won't come out,

315
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,870
so I came to him.

316
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:06,880
Goodbye, sir.

317
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,350
Captain Lian.

318
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,440
I just had Lu check

319
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,750
the footage at the road
near Yue Hongbing's place.

320
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,270
His car never left on June 19th.

321
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:26,960
Okay.

322
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,050
Where are you going?

323
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:37,530
Just "okay"?

324
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:47,570
Hello.

325
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,960
I'm Lian Jiangshu's parent.

326
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,640
What can I help you with?

327
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,930
May I take a look at your car?

328
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:57,640
What for?

329
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:00,040
Insurance already assessed the damage.

330
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,720
We can just go through the insurance.

331
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,510
Well, I mean,

332
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,710
I just want to take a look.

333
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,160
I heard you're a police officer, right?

334
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,310
Do you have a search warrant?

335
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,490
I may not make myself clear.

336
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,510
I'm not here as a police officer today.

337
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,160
Then there's nothing for you to see.

338
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:25,090
Have some tea.

339
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,310
Uncle Lian.

340
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,290
Our car is at the repair shop,

341
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:39,750
just across from the south gate.

342
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,200
Thank you.

343
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,640
Uncle Lian, could you please

344
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,240
not tell my dad
that I went to see Lian Jiangshu?

345
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:47,790
Thank you, sir.

346
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,110
The interior of this car
hasn't been touched, right?

347
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,770
No, no repairs needed inside.

348
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,170
What's the issue with this car?

349
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:03,900
I'm just looking.
You can go about your business.

350
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:44,010
Here's two more yuan.

351
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:46,130
Okay.

352
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:47,310
Thanks.

353
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,400
You didn't drive the car.

354
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,880
Why did you admit to it?

355
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,750
I did drive it.

356
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,160
The car was driven by the owner's kid,

357
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,110
your classmate.

358
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,700
He's got a shoulder injury

359
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,110
from the seatbelt.

360
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,230
He was in the driver's seat.

361
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,920
The back seat has seatbelts too.

362
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:09,890
I was the one driving.

363
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:10,930
Are you sure?

364
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,710
Then why were your fingerprints

365
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:14,560
on the passenger headrest?

366
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,190
You were sitting in the back.

367
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,440
Fingerprints?

368
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,590
Traffic police didn't take fingerprints.

369
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,870
I just took them today.

370
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,590
How did you know they're my fingerprints?

371
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:26,110
Did you sneak into my room
and get a sample to match?

372
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:28,070
I've had your fingerprints for years.

373
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,030
When you were five,

374
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:31,030
I collected all your fingerprints,

375
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,000
and a few years ago,

376
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I also kept your DNA data.

377
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,790
Why?

378
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,160
You think I'd commit a crime one day?

379
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:37,550
Murder or arson?

380
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,580
Of course not,

381
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,160
it was just for safety.

382
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,960
Just leave, get out of here.

383
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,590
This is the money I made
from selling junk.

384
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:54,590
I didn't steal it.

385
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:11,770
I didn't cook tonight. Let's eat out.

386
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,240
What's wrong?

387
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,750
When was the last time

388
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,950
we went out for a meal,

389
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,400
just the two of us?

390
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,410
You can't even remember.

391
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,790
It must've been ages.

392
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:37,180
How about this restaurant?

393
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,250
It costs 220 yuan per person.

394
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,160
That's half my monthly grocery budget.
Forget it.

395
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,440
I already picked a few places.

396
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,830
How about you pick instead?

397
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,300
Why don't we go to our usual spot then?

398
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:54,930
Let's go.

399
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,640
Order more.

400
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:06,400
That's enough. We can't finish all this.

401
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,930
We need to eat less at night.

402
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:10,480
This is mainly about the gesture,

403
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,410
not the food.

404
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:14,650
Have some fish.

405
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,560
You went to see Shu again today?

406
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,550
My mom saw you.

407
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,480
What did you say to him?

408
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,610
He was so angry that he skipped dinner.

409
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:34,810
I didn't say anything.

410
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:37,750
Our son doesn't understand you like I do.

411
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,120
You're like a rock to him.

412
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:43,720
If you don't open up to him now,

413
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:45,250
as he grows up,

414
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,810
with a strong sense of pride like you,

415
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:52,210
you'll have even less
to talk with him in the future.

416
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,880
Do you want to be at odds
with him forever?

417
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,410
Isn't that how it was
with you and your father?

418
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,510
Fine.

419
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,160
I'll try.

420
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:09,070
How come you're so free today?

421
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:11,330
What about your case?

422
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,380
The leads went cold.

423
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,280
We have no progress for now.

424
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,960
What kind of case is it?

425
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,810
You seem very exhausted this time, right?

426
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,160
It's okay.

427
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,570
They're all like that.

428
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,980
If you want to talk about it, go ahead.

429
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,680
Don't worry, it's nothing.

430
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,290
When the case is closed,

431
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,220
I'll tell you about it.

432
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,070
You don't have to tell me
if you don't want to.

433
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:49,600
I'm just worried
you're bottling too much up.

434
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,550
Do you want some soup?

435
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,660
I'll eat the dish.

436
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,160
By the way,

437
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,330
Guo's son is going to summer camp.

438
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:01,200
She said she's worried
her son might get bullied,

439
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,590
so she wants to borrow
that suitcase of yours,

440
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,550
the one that looks like
it's for police use.

441
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,750
Don't you have one?

442
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:09,720
A suitcase?

443
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:13,350
That prize from the police academy,

444
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,440
with "Police Academy  Souvenir"
written on it.

445
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,040
You keep
all your old treasured stuff in there.

446
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,260
That suitcase...

447
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,790
Did you already lend it to her?

448
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,720
No, I need to ask you first.

449
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,040
If you don't want to, we won't lend it.

450
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,270
Let her borrow it.

451
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,720
I'll empty it out when I get home.

452
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,470
This soup is so spicy.

453
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,160
Don't get in the car.

454
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,530
Don't get in the car!

455
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,720
Did you all see it?

456
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,680
Last night,

457
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:25,570
someone posted about Shen Xiaozhou's case.

458
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,370
The title is
"Death of a Female College Student."

459
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:31,070
It's a lengthy article,

460
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,360
very detailed, very vivid,

461
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,620
and quite convincing.

462
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:41,440
Aside from

463
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,440
what's already public,

464
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,000
it includes many details...

465
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:47,550
only we

466
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:49,480
were supposed to know.

467
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,680
How did they know

468
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,090
about that designer headscarf thing?

469
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:58,440
Maybe Zhang Haoyang told someone?

470
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,270
Impossible.

471
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,960
Most of the leaks

472
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,970
point directly at Zhang Haoyang.

473
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,590
The post paints him as a spoiled rich kid,

474
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:08,310
from elementary
through middle and high school,

475
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:10,110
he's always been a troubled kid.

476
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,220
It says he's quiet on the surface,

477
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,720
but if someone provoked him,

478
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,350
he always got violent and fought back.

479
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,070
Once,

480
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:18,270
he even cut a student with a knife,

481
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,240
but his family paid some money,

482
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,930
and nothing ever came of it.

483
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,350
If he's the whistleblower,

484
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:26,150
why would he throw himself
under the bus like that?

485
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:26,830
It also says

486
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,270
Zhang Haoyan's the main suspect
in Shen Xiaozhou's case,

487
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,440
with a lot of suspicious behavior.

488
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,400
But he still

489
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,420
walked out of
the police station untouched.

490
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,270
Overnight,

491
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,920
the post blew up online.

492
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,170
Take a look at the comments.

493
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,030
Zhang Haoyang's taking a lot of heat
in the comments,

494
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,590
but who else's
getting criticized the most?

495
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:46,880
It's us, the police.

496
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,920
We're getting roasted.

497
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,130
We're taking the blame.

498
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:55,400
Apparently, following procedure
makes us the bad guys.

499
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,830
I mean, all these things,

500
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:01,400
especially all these details,

501
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,880
how does that Weibo account

502
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,610
possibly know so many details?

503
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,480
We don't know about that.

504
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:09,930
Actually, I'm mad too.

505
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,590
He's a key suspect,

506
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,570
and we just watched him walk away.

507
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,790
Who wouldn't be frustrated?

508
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,230
Who wouldn't want to take him down?

509
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:16,880
Lin Zi,

510
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:19,510
quit with your little mind games.

511
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,540
How about this?

512
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,310
Let's book a room right now,

513
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:25,720
and you interrogate me first?

514
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,400
Boss...

515
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,080
come on...

516
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:30,640
how could I possibly
want to interrogate you?

517
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,210
We've been comrades for so many years.

518
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:33,740
We know each other too well.

519
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,670
Dig deeper
into Zhang Haoyang's background.

520
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,510
Find out if what they're saying online

521
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:40,920
about Zhang Haoyang's
personality issues is true.

522
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,010
Also, check if that account

523
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:44,340
is the source of the Fengyun Headlines.

524
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,240
Oh, right.

525
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,960
Find out if the leak

526
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,880
came from inside.

527
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,240
No way.

528
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,000
There’s another post after this,

529
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:07,190
"Psychological Study
of a Perverted Killer."

530
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,520
Combined with those leaks
about Zhang Haoyang...

531
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,830
it seems they're guiding the public

532
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:16,880
to believe that Zhang Haoyang

533
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,720
is the culprit behind all this.

534
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:23,000
What is the purpose

535
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:25,640
of doing this?

536
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,450
We're all police officers here.

537
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:29,070
We know what should
or shouldn't be shared.

538
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,940
It's all clearly written
in the code of conduct.

539
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,680
How could we not understand that?

540
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,480
Indeed.

541
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:36,320
But some people

542
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:40,440
probably never even read it.

543
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,380
Who are you talking about?

544
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,590
I didn't name anyone,

545
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:49,450
why are you taking it personally?

546
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:50,920
Lin Zi,

547
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:55,070
did you find out

548
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,870
who runs the Fengyun Headlines?

549
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:59,070
Well, Sui Xiao's still working on it.

550
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:00,510
I'm just mad that

551
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:03,750
Jia Beibei and Wang Yishan
both took out high-interest loans.

552
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:06,350
But that loan shark, Sha Hongli,
has vanished.

553
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,860
No one knows if he's dead or alive.

554
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:22,350
Haiping!

555
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:36,970
I want to apologize to you.

556
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,640
I've been edgy these past few days,
not thinking clearly,

557
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,830
and I was rude to you.

558
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,920
They came to me a few days ago too,

559
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,640
suspecting I falsely accused you
of embezzlement.

560
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,070
I thought you said something,

561
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:47,960
so I got all hot-headed.

562
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,160
Everything you did started to annoy me.

563
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,740
But after I calmed down
and thought about it,

564
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,880
I realized you'd never doubt me like that,
not even for a second.

565
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,790
Is there any conflict between you

566
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,080
and the other candidate, Zhao Hougang?

567
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,980
It couldn't be Zhao Hougang.

568
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,800
He's not that kind of person.

569
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,460
I was being paranoid.

570
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:09,520
Well,

571
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,790
you know I came from the army,

572
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,500
never went to the police academy.

573
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,630
I've learned solving cases on the job,

574
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:18,450
using nothing but hard work.

575
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:19,580
That's all I've got.

576
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,120
You're a top graduate
from the police academy,

577
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,780
solving cases methodically.

578
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,030
You're educated, well-versed in theory,

579
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,680
and capable of
making brilliant strategies.

580
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,750
When it comes to professional skills,

581
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,270
I genuinely admire you.

582
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,510
I've been in our team for over two years,

583
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:35,590
but we never got close.

584
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:36,720
And that's my fault.

585
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,930
I always thought you were a bit proud,

586
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:40,680
thought you might look down on me.

587
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,550
Proud?

588
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,080
I'm not proud, I just...

589
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,830
That's just your personality.

590
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:47,790
Commander Feng told me about you.

591
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:48,960
He said you treat everyone the same.

592
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,310
You don't say much on the surface,

593
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,970
but keep your talents hidden.

594
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,750
I really don't know

595
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,160
how to talk to someone like you.

596
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,000
How about we grab a drink sometime?

597
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,440
Can you drink?

598
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,000
Not much.

599
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,980
That's fine, it's the thought that counts.

600
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:12,489
Don't be formal with me anymore.

601
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:14,230
I'm thick-skinned,

602
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:17,449
so feel free to say anything to me.

603
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,440
We're on the same task force.

604
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:26,080
If our kids got into a fight,

605
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,600
as parents, we shouldn't hold a grudge.

606
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:31,190
At the end of the day,
we're both straightforward.

607
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:33,719
It's just you keep things in,
I let things out.

608
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:35,719
Alright, that's all I wanted to say.

609
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,060
What's your take on it?

610
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,190
Okay.

611
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:38,889
Good.

612
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:40,790
Then, I want to ask you

613
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,480
about Wang Yishan and Jia Beibei's loans,

614
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,080
what do you think about that?

615
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,929
I was just thinking,

616
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:51,030
the amount they borrowed each time
was quite huge.

617
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,480
If it were for living expenses,

618
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,670
they wouldn't borrow so much at once.

619
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:00,190
So I think we should look into

620
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,440
what they needed the money for.

621
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:04,400
These kids,

622
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:07,190
8 out of 10 borrow money
just to buy a phone.

623
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:08,590
Not necessarily,

624
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,800
A phone doesn't cost that much.

625
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,360
And they usually have a clear reason
when they borrow the loan.

626
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,680
What else could it be?

627
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,190
Gambling? Drugs?

628
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,760
Or buying shoes?

629
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,710
If those leaks are true,

630
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,770
then this Zhang Haoyang really seems like

631
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,840
a psychopathic killer.

632
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,810
He looks weak and harmless on the surface,

633
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:43,610
but actually has a twisted mind.

634
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:44,480
This could also explain

635
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,800
why Shen Xiaozhou's death

636
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,530
was different from the others.

637
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:49,360
He knew Shen Xiaozhou,

638
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,590
so he treated her differently.

639
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,520
You don't think I leaked it, do you?

640
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:00,550
It wasn't me.

641
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:02,110
I didn't break any rules.

642
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,190
I never suspected you.

643
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:07,800
Then...

644
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,860
what's with that attitude?

645
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,390
You're pulling a long face.

646
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,170
I'm just a bit tired.

647
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:18,640
I haven't slept properly for days.

648
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,380
Then... you should get some rest.

649
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:37,420
Why is Fengyun Headlines based
in a residential area?

650
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,080
Is it a fly-by-night company?

651
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,720
There are people inside.

652
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,210
And it seems quite busy.

653
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,110
We're number one on trending now!

654
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:04,030
Great!

655
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,550
Bravo!
