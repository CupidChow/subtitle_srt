[Episode 2]

3
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,380
Come on, Captain Lian.

4
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,600
Any findings?

5
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:46,910
Yes.

6
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,450
A female victim.

7
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,350
Homicide.

8
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,120
Homicide?

9
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,710
A foot of hers was severed.

10
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,280
Call for backup.

11
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,660
Close the factory gate first.

12
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:00,270
Don't let anyone present leave.

13
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,240
Guys, did you take
enough camera batteries?

14
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,430
Don't repeat the previous mistake.

15
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,590
We've brought enough batteries.

16
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,000
Really? Have you checked?

17
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,120
You got everything you need?

18
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,590
Yes!

19
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,430
Keep up, guys!

20
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,200
Note down
the information of every civilian here.

21
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,280
Every one of them?

22
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,590
Collect all the fingerprints
and shoe prints.

23
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,430
Did you bring enough supplies?

24
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:37,870
Yes.

25
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,980
A severed foot?

26
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,410
Hopefully not the same killer.

27
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,610
The scene is tainted with various tracks.

28
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,590
Will collecting shoe prints
be of any help?

29
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,790
A newbie, aren't you?

30
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:52,630
Listen,

31
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,780
working a case is
like looking for a needle in a haystack.

32
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,190
Hard work is not enough.

33
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,240
Patience is much required.

34
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,880
99.9% of our efforts

35
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,040
would usually

36
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,190
go down the drain.

37
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,000
As for the remaining 0.1%,

38
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,090
it might not pay off either.

39
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,570
Collect this one. See?

40
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,820
Let me through!

41
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:12,400
Make way.

42
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,360
-Stop there!
-Make way!

43
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,030
Out of my way!

44
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,290
What is this guy doing?

45
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:16,480
Stop!

46
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,600
Stop!

47
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,880
What are you doing?

48
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,530
Don't move.

49
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,810
What are you doing?

50
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,040
I left a pot on the stove at home.

51
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,159
The blood. Where is it from?

52
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,560
I butchered a chicken this morning.

53
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,240
I haven't turned off the stove yet.

54
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,650
The chicken is still simmering on it.

55
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,210
Come home with me for a check
if you don't believe it.

56
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,430
It's true. He butchered a chicken
in the doorway this morning.

57
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,960
Feathers were everywhere.

58
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:04,400
Let's go.

59
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,800
Her height is about 1.65 meters.

60
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,140
Come on. Turn the body around.

61
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,370
Set up fences, now.

62
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:17,390
Careful.

63
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,720
It's preliminarily assessed to be
the same method.

64
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,450
If it really is the same killer,

65
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,380
Zhao will be in serious trouble.

66
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,530
What do you mean?

67
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,310
Who's Zhao?

68
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,680
Zhao is the captain of Unit Two.

69
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,530
He got a case in March this year,

70
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,190
where a young woman also died

71
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,390
with a foot of hers severed.

72
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,850
It hasn't been solved yet.

73
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,290
Could it be the same murderer?

74
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,230
That can't be concluded yet.

75
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,560
Will this case

76
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,490
be assigned to Unit Two?

77
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,670
The body was soaked in water.

78
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,270
The exact time of death
can't be determined.

79
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,190
My initial judgement is

80
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,750
that she died
between 10:00 to 12:00 last night.

81
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,350
If all that hadn't happened,

82
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,320
we couldn't have discovered the body.

83
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,070
Don't go there!

84
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,090
No entry! No entry!

85
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,180
What are you doing?

86
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:24,030
Don't move!

87
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,640
If it's the same killer,

88
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,850
then the gravity of the case
will go up a level.

89
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:38,780
Let's wait for
Guo's detailed examination results.

90
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,190
Zhao is on a manhunt.

91
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,590
If it all goes well,
he'll be back tomorrow.

92
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,180
If the investigation is to be upgraded,

93
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,980
I'm a afraid a new task force
will have to be formed.

94
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,990
Has the victim been identified yet?

95
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,040
A friend of the victim's,

96
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,750
named Yang Tao,
from a family of Xuri Factory workers,

97
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,610
identified her

98
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,770
to be Shen Xiaozhou.

99
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,870
Shen Xiaozhou?

100
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:14,950
Is it her?

101
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,440
Shi Qiangfeng is described

102
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,720
as a promising cadet
by the police academy in his file.

103
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,790
He ranked top
in several combat training drills.

104
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:07,040
However, before entering the academy,

105
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,450
he was involved in some minor offenses
as an adolescent.

106
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,650
What minor offenses?

107
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,470
He was homeless for a few years.

108
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,840
Being young and hot-headed,

109
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,480
he is said to have defeated a number of
spiteful hoodlums with violence.

110
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,910
But he didn't do evil

111
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,510
or join any gangs.

112
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,390
Otherwise, the police academy
wouldn't have accepted him.

113
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:26,390
He couldn't shake off his bad habits
in the first two years of school,

114
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,360
and was therefore
criticized multiple times,

115
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,440
given two major demerits,

116
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,000
and even nearly expelled.

117
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,000
He's a rough kid then.

118
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,140
We're going to transform him.

119
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:36,730
Well,

120
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,780
did he perform well today?

121
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,040
If your answer is no,

122
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,860
then send him back to Unit Two
when Zhao returns.

123
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,360
We'll have Zhao tame him.

124
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,040
Captain Lian,

125
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,200
if it really is a serial killer,

126
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,510
he has probably committed
more than two murders.

127
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,550
I'll go to the municipal bureau

128
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,510
to probe into the unsolved homicides.

129
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:03,270
Only these two cases
are about severed feet.

130
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,080
Serial killers polish their skills.

131
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,340
Maybe this one didn't use to cut off feet.

132
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,660
Let's wait for the forensic results.

133
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,190
Where are you going?

134
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:30,320
A-A schoolmate's home, for homework.

135
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,770
I just saw some students

136
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,000
at the compound gate

137
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,760
discussing where to go
to play video games.

138
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,200
They're waiting for you now, right?

139
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,150
That's not true.

140
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,820
Answer the phone. Put it on speaker.

141
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,640
You should go to bed early

142
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,600
to make up for the two hours

143
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,730
you lost last night.

144
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,730
Did you see Director Li?

145
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,270
Something held him up,
so he couldn't make it.

146
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,400
I don't think we can fix him up with Guo.

147
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,670
Guo was whining the entire time,

148
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,510
resenting Director Li's small apartment.

149
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,230
Where's the fish?

150
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,310
Guo ate it all up.

151
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,170
How did you figure out

152
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,590
our son hadn't slept
until 1:30 a.m. today?

153
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,950
I got home at 2:30 a.m..

154
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,380
Then I checked his cellphone,

155
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,910
which was at 35% battery.

156
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:38,040
He never puts his cellphone down
until the battery dies.

157
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:42,070
It usually takes three hours
for it to be fully charged.

158
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:45,240
But the process had only
lasted for one hour by the time I saw it.

159
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,240
That means the charging
didn't start until 1:30 a.m..

160
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,140
With you being our son's father,

161
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,470
he must feel like
he's living in hot water.

162
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,000
What is it?

163
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:01,790
Happy birthday.

164
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,070
[Photography Studio]
[Reservation]

165
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,500
So you do know to give me a gift.

166
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,550
I didn't take portraits when I was young.

167
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,750
Why bother to do it now as I'm much older?

168
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,030
Such a waste of money.

169
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:19,270
The renovation and development
of the city's old coastal industrial zone

170
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,930
are about to enter a new phase.

171
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,150
This is the final

172
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,780
and the most valuable
development project of the city.

173
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,780
The overall design of this coastal area

174
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,390
will align with
the international standards

175
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,670
that champion
eco-friendliness and sustainability.

176
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:33,390
Xiaohai, take a seat over here.

177
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,840
Let me dry your hair.

178
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,960
It's wet now.

179
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,840
Okay. Do it yourself then.

180
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,910
I'll make your bed.

181
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:53,920
Xiaozhou?

182
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:56,200
Xiaozhou?

183
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:58,830
Xiaozhou?

184
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,750
Xiaozhou?

185

It's from1995.

193
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:30,910
Is it relevant to the case at hand?

194
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,310
I just want to take a look.

195
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,240
It's on the third shelf of the rack.

196
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,440
Look for it yourself.

When did you get up?

225
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,510
A new case came up.

226
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,270
It kept me from sleep.

227

-Captain Lian.
-Have you searched the factory yet?

229
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,600
Yes, everywhere. No findings at all.

230
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,710

Where do you think
the primary crime scene is?

233
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,830
Cutting off a foot

234
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,580
would cause a lot of bleeding.

235
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,690
Could it have happened underwater?

236
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,790
No way.

237
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,930
The skin margins indicate
that an electric device was used.

238
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,590
Then the foot must've been severed
somewhere else

239
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,160
before being brought to this place.

240
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,690

I'm heading back to the office.

241
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,760

242
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,370
Zhao Hougang should be back today.

00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:45,290
Goodbye.

244
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:52,710
Let's go.

245
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:59,140
When I was pinning a guy down,

246
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:02,030
a lad attempted to attack my head.

247
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,680
I heard the wind whistling
at the back of my head.

248
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,440
It was too late to dodge the strike.

249
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,480
-Captain.
-Sir.

250
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,240
Captain Zhao was a few steps away from me.

251
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,160
His arm reached me before I could see him.

252
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,510
As I heard a cracking sound,

253
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,270
I thought my cranium was broken.

254
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,590
Without making a grunt,

255
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:19,250
Captain Zhao turned around
and knocked that lad down with one arm.

256
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,390
What nonsense are you talking?

257
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:21,650
Do I look like a gibbon?

258
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:22,880
Go away.

259
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,240
You're back.

260
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:29,830

261
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:31,330

262
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,610
come with me.

263
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,330
Where's the hammer?

264
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,000
Liu from the porter's lodge borrowed it.

265
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,350
The screws came loose again.

266
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,440
Put some nails in.

267
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,260
Hammer it hard.

268
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,810
"Hammer it hard..."

269
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,020
What's the case about?

270
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:02,750
Oh.

271
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,640
Commander Feng, now I understand
why nobody gave me a straight answer

272
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,240
when I asked them about this case.

273
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,240
Any conclusions?

274
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:08,960
Yes.

275
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,420
This is the victim
of the March 13th Case this year,

276
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,150
Wang Yishan.

277
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,650
You know it best.

278
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,830
Here is what these two cases
have in common.

279
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:22,160
Wang Yishan died of mechanical asphyxia.

280
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:24,640
Shen Xiaozhou was probably
strangled to death too,

281
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,680
given her fractured hyoid bones

282
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,280
and the conjunctival hemorrhages
in her eyes.

283
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,840
Another thing in common

284
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:33,110
is that a foot was severed
from their bodies respectively.

285
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,110
The difference is

286
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,720
that Wang Yishan's left foot
was removed,

287
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,480
while Shen Xiaozhou's right foot
was cut off.

288
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,880
The third thing in common

289
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,970
is the cutting tool.

290
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,960
Based on Wang Yishan's case,

291
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,920
we can make a rough conclusion

292
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:48,320
that the feet were cut off
by an electric hacksaw like this.

293
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,070
It can be operated with one hand.

294
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,750
We've conducted a search in the city,

295
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,720
but haven't found

296
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,960
any suspicious individuals
among the buyers of such tools.

297
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,590
I suspect the murderer bought it
somewhere else or online.

298
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,900
We're expanding the investigation scope.

299
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,230
The cutting surface on Wang Yishan's body

300
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,920
is neater and flatter, isn't it?

301
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,460
You can put it that way.

302
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:09,070
But preciseness is prone to be compromised

303
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,260
when one operates a handheld saw.

304
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,270
Lastly,

305
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,830
they were sexually assaulted
in different ways.

306
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,440
What Shen Xiaozhou went through

307
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,240
was not the regular type of rape.

308
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,710
She was assaulted by an item,

309
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,570
which I suspect to be

310
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,880
a smooth multi-faceted cylindrical object,

311
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,830
such as this one.

312
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,200
It's not a commonly seen shape.

313
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,180
I guess the murderer takes a similar item
with him all the time.

314
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,010
If the victims were killed
by the same person,

315
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,960
then the changes
in his pattern of behavior seem odd.

316
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,090
What's odd about it?

317
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,210
This guy is just a pervert.

318
00:21:59,240 --> 00:21:59,880
Pause.

319
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,640
Who are you?

320
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,760
I'm talking to you!

321
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,970
Put the hammer down.

322
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,420
Who are you?

323
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,730
Hey, how did you get in here?

324
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,060
Who are you, punk?

325
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:16,800
Who are you?

326
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,110
Lin Zi!

327
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:19,300
Release him.

328
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,720
Release him!

329
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:22,880
Lin Zi.

330
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,600
This is where we stand now.

331
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,790
Both cases lack

332
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:32,720
DNA evidence.

333
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,260
All we can do is analyze

334
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,320
if the murders were done
by the same person.

335
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,030
Share your thoughts, everyone.

336
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,490
It must be the same killer.

337
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:43,030
What are the chances of having two killers

338
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:46,090
who cut off feet with electric saws
in the same district

339
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,150
of the same city?

340
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,350
There could be

341
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,070
a copycat.

342
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,000
Impossible.

343
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,000
The details of the March 13th Case
have been kept confidential.

344
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,240
Besides, Wang Yishan's body

345
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,070
was found in an abandoned manhole.

346
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,920
If Shen Xiaozhou was killed by a copycat,

347
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,480
why would the killer go to the trouble of
carrying her to Xuri Factory

348
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,740
instead of dumping her in a random sewer?

349
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:06,030
That way, her body could be easily found.

350
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,400
Would a copycat be afraid of

351
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,000
his prey's body being found?

352
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,300
Isn't the whole point to shift the blame?

353
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:16,110
Lian Haiping, what's your opinion?

354
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:18,920
I'm not sure.

355
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:23,540
That copycat theory
is 50% likely to be valid.

356
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,960
The severed feet...

357
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,000
The same cutting tool...

358
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,160
The special features of that tool...

359
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:33,790
These could be
a serial killer's distinctive signatures.

360
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,520
What makes you feel uncertain?

361
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,370
The killer of Wang Yishan wore gloves.

362
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,640
The bruises on Shen Xiaozhou's neck
are accompanied with

363
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,920
small crescent-shaped wounds

364
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,070
caused by fingernails.

365
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,440
Her killer didn't wear gloves.

366
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,750
Unlike Shen Xiaozhou,
there are defensive wounds

367
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,590
on Wang Yishan's body,
and her wrists and ankles

368
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:52,450
were strapped.

369
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,720
There are only some scratches

370
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:55,790
on Shen Xiaozhou's legs

371
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:56,590
and heels,

372
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,440
from when she was dragged on the ground.

373
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,030
I have a question,

374
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:08,230
regarding how the victims were subdued

375
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,450
and sexually assaulted.

376
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,310
Suppose it were a serial killer,

377
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,000
what induced

378
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,790
the change of his modus operandi?

379
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:20,880
Besides,

380
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,810
one victim's left foot was cut off,

381
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:27,350
while the other's right foot was severed.

382
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,010
I think there's a possibility

383
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,520
that the killer of Wang Yishan
is left-handed,

384
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,860
while the killer of Shen Xiaozhou
is right-handed.

385
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:39,100
Choosing only the same side...

386
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,640
Isn't it a stretch?

387
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,900
What if the victims were lying face down?

388
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,510
There are many possibilities.

389
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:47,170
That's why
I said there was no scientific basis.

390
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:50,110
The core elements are consistent,

391
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,910
whereas the minor details vary.

392
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,600
A killer's mordus operandi

393
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,630
might change every now and then.

394
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,000
I contend

395
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,100
that it is the same killer.

396
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,880
A consolidated investigation is needed.

397
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:04,550
Now, this is what I think.

398
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,530
If the two cases are to be

399
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,590
investigated as a whole by a task force,
your units will both be deployed.

400
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:13,050
The March 13th Case
was assigned to Unit Two.

401
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,240
It'll still be handled by them.

402
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,310
I'll be the team leader,

403
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:18,240
with Zhao Hougang
being the second in command,

404
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,590
and Unit Three providing assistance.

405
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:20,550
Do you agree?

406
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,960
Completely.

407
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:25,520
Any ideas on how to
proceed with the investigation?

408
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:30,090
Let's suppose it's a serial killer.

409
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,470
Then he'd probably target

410
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,130
two types of people.

411
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,480
One, his acquaintances.

412
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:44,520
Now, what's the connection
between Wang Yishan and Shen Xiaozhou?

413
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,640
Wang Yishan was unemployed

414
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,920
without a stable job.

415
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,880
She only had middle school education.

416
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,160
Shen Xiaozhou was a college student.

417
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,620
What could possibly
link them to each other?

418
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,920
If there is anything,

419
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:00,250
then the killer must be involved with it.

420
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:05,550
Two, the killer chooses
his victims randomly.

421
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:09,960
That would make things difficult.

422
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,560
There is a fact we uncovered.

423
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,070
Before Wang Yishan died,

424
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:15,110
she took out a high-interest loan,

425
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:18,160
which was probably related to her murder.

426
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,640
On the previous manhunt, we arrested

427
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,360
some key members of the loan shark gang
that she borrowed money from.

428
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,480
These people are denying

429
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,590
having anything to do with Wang's murder.

430
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:27,880
They said the man in charge

431
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,640
is named Sha Hongli,

432
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,160
who goes by the alias of Shark.

433
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,320
He's right here in Lingchuan.

434
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,260
But since he lays low,

435
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,660
nobody knows where he is.

436
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,490
Chief Qiu, Captain Feng,

437
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,460
I plan to pursue this lead.

438
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,540
As for Shen Xiaozhou's murder...

439
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,400
Let's put Lian on it.

440
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,160
I have a suggestion.

441
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:49,510
You should check if she took out a loan.

442
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:51,550
Nowadays,
many college students take out loans.

443
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,510
Our two teams

444
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,950
will keep each other updated

445
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,400
if there is any progress.

446
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:56,830
Okay.

447
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,240
It is all set then.

448
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:02,400
What about me?
Should I stay in Unit Three?

449
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,240
Are you literally asking that?

450
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,650
We are not short of hands.

451
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,310
Take this.

452
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,920
You'll still stay with us then.

453
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:18,270
Pour me some water.

454
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:30,920
It's too warm.

455
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:32,420
Let it cool down.

456
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:35,930
Get me a tangerine.

457
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,110
Here you are.

458
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,810
Shall we ask Chunxia to come over?

459
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:48,750
No.

460
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,570
Don't tell her about this.

461
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,000
When she comes home from school,

462
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:55,720
she'll know.

463
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,800
Director Yue.

464
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,130
Stay put. Stay put.

465
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:07,330
What brings you here?

466
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,440
You must be swamped as the property sales

467
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,550
of Jinhai One have begun.

468
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:11,830
I'm only doing my job.

469
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,590
This is the chairman of Jinhai Group,

470
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:15,440
Mr. Li.

471
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,510
That is Deputy Manager Liang.

472
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:18,720
This is my wife, Du Li.

473
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:19,800
-Hello.
-Hello.

474
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:21,000
Come on, take a seat.

475
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,680
Have a seat.

476
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,200
How are you?

477
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,240
All is good, I hope?

478
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,110
I'm fine.

479
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,010
I have a tough skull.

480
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,870
You need to take this seriously.

481
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:34,390
If you feel unwell,

482
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,440
do let me know.

483
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:38,290
I'll invite specialists from Beijing over.

484
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,330
No need for that.

485
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,410
I'll be discharged tomorrow.

486
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,350
Get Director Yue a premium ward.

487
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,860
Hire the best caregivers.

488
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,260
It's your task now.

489
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,720
Consider it done, Mr. Li.

490
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,750
Sorry.

491
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:55,030
I need to be

492
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:56,400
somewhere else now.

493
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,880
Have a nice chat with Director Yue.

494
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,540
Sure thing.

495
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:02,200
Don't move.

496
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,000
Take care.

497
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,800
Get well soon.

498
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:04,590
Alright.

499
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:05,500
See you then.

500
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:07,480
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

501
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:13,410
A premium ward?

502
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,160
Go downstairs to buy some tofu buns.

503
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:31,310
I don't feel like eating hospital food.

504
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:32,920
Okay.

505
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:47,240
A murder happened in Xuri Factory.

506
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:49,660
It's a real disaster.

507
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:53,250
I was told as soon as I woke up.

508
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,210
I heard if it hadn't been for me,

509
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,090
the body wouldn't have been found.

510
00:29:58,090 --> 00:29:59,750
The victim was a college girl.

511
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,550
This has caused quite a social impact.

512
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:05,150
Her parents devoted
many years to the factory.

513
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:06,650
What a tragedy.

514
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:18,270
This is a malicious murder.

515
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,200
Before it is solved,

516
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:21,880
I'm afraid all our plans

517
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,180
will have to be put on hold.

518
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,930
That's our only option now.

519
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,760
Let's wait till the case is solved.

520
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:43,200
Director Yue, even if the case is solved,

521
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,680
about the site Xuri Factory is built on,

522
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,740
frankly speaking,

523
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,000
Mr. Li

524
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,490
is having second thoughts.

525
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:52,640
He talked about hiring a fengshui master.

526
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,200
I understand Mr. Li's concerns.

527
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,540
But we did reach a consensus previously,
didn't we?

528
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,170
One single incident shouldn't...

529
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:04,190
Why don't you make a concession?

530
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,880
A concession on my part alone
is not enough.

531
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,640
Tough though my skull is,

532
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,440
it can't take another hit.

533
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:21,150
We can't let that happen, can we?

534
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:23,240
Let's get you a golden helmet

535
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,310
that you can wear

536
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:26,370
for extra protection.

537
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:37,270
Do you have reservations about
conducting a consolidated investigation?

538
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:37,790
Yes.

539
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:41,000
But that is a correct decision,

540
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:42,350
given the current situation.

541
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,440
By pooling our strengths together,

542
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,170
we can mobilize more resources

543
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,440
and largely improve our efficiency.

544
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,000
Right.

545
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,070
We must probe into
every lead of Shen Xiaozhou's case

546
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,790
and heed Zhao's suggestion.

547
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,930
Just be collaborative.

548
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:58,590
Try to solve the cases sooner.

549
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,130
Got it.

550
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,510
Wait.

551
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,720
I'm not finished yet.

552
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,310
Haiping, your professionalism

553
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,200
is recognized and acknowledged

554
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,460
by the whole division.

555
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,920
You show strong competence
in investigating cases,

556
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,120
interviewing people

557
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,900
and interrogating suspects.

558
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,260
Your communication skills are fine.

559
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,480
But why is it so hard

560
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,680
to squeeze a word out of your mouth
when you're not at work?

561
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:29,230
I have to give
what it takes to finish my job.

562
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,400
You should've chewed the tablets.

563
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,070
Too sticky.

564
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:38,400
Had to save time.

565
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,240
Haiping, you should

566
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,830
communicate more with your co-workers.

567
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:45,000
You could suffer a loss for not doing so.

568
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,930
Commander Feng,

569
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,940
is there anything else you'd like to say?

570
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:56,310
I'll be relieved from this position soon.

571
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,710
There are two candidates

572
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,350
for the post of commander—

573
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:00,550
Zhao Hougang and you.

574
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:04,680
Though Zhao was transferred here
only two or three years ago,

575
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,480
he has never made a blunder.

576
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,810
He got injured during the manhunt.

577
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:11,070
All the bureau leaders have noticed him.

578
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,130
But what about you?

579
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,100
You haven't caught
much of their attention.

580
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,830
This morning, I saw you at the entrance.

581
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:20,880
Would it kill you to greet and chat with

582
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,480
the bureau leaders?

583
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,370
Commander Feng...

584
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,400
You're too reserved.

585
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,610
There are only two candidates,

586
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,880
Zhao and you.

587
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:34,350
I won't be partial.

588
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,680
But to be honest,

589
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,160
your personality has put you

590
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:42,090
at a disadvantage.

591
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:43,200
By the way,

592
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:46,000
it's a good thing
that Shi Qiangfeng is in your unit.

593
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,550
You have to embrace challenges
as a team leader.

594
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:49,350
Put some effort in training him.

595
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,489
Come with me.

596
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:14,710
Where to?

597
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,980
The areas around Xuri Factory

598
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,670
are undergoing demolition and renovation.

599
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:25,000
Surveillance cameras are not in place yet.

600
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,110
The nearest one to the crime scene

601
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:29,110
is over two kilometers away.

602
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:30,610
This.

603
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,400
[Video Center
of Lingzhou Criminal Investigation Division]

604
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,000
This.

605
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:33,880
And this.

606
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:35,800
Which one?

607
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:37,360
It's up to you.

608
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,570
According to your theory,

609
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:47,070
the possibility of
catching the suspect on camera

610
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:48,480
drops by how much

611
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:50,739
when the camera is one block farther?

612
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:52,510
75%.

613
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:56,960
God knows how you calculated that.

614
00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:00,730
Slim chances of catching the suspect
on these three cameras, huh?

615
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:04,230
They're situated
in a remote place with many small paths.

616
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:06,600
Put your experience to use.

617
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:09,720
Find out how many vehicles passed by
around the time

618
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,720
of the incident.

619
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,200
But what kind of vehicle
are we looking for?

620
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,190
Car, motorcycles,

621
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,590
tricycles, or bicycles?

622
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:21,510
The scene was trampled on
by over a hundred people.

623
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:24,670
I'm not sure
what kind of vehicle the killer used.

624
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:28,270
It means we have to check all the vehicles
that can fit a person in.

625
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:31,510
Hey, new guy,

626
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,760
buy me some eye drops,

627
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:35,590
the most expensive kind.

628
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,800
Okay. I'm on it.

629
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,670
Come back. I was just messing with you.

630
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,280
I have plenty of eye drops here.

631
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,150
Where is Sui Xiao?

632
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:54,030
Right here.

633
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:58,550
The AC was making noises,

634
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,440
so I fixed it.

635
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,280
Check all of
Shen Xiaozhou's communication records,

636
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,630
including those
on her cellphone, social platforms,

637
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:08,690
and whatever application
a college student would use.

638
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:11,760
That's easy.

639
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,630
However,

640
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:15,160
chat history is usually saved
in the devices.

641
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,630
Without Shen's personal devices,

642
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:17,500
it's hard to obtain the data.

643
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,760
Just find what you can.

644
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,480
Also,

645
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:22,370
try to figure out if there is a connection

646
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,040
between Wang Yishan and her.

647
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:24,590
Okay.

648
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,180
Hello, Shi Qiangfeng.

649
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:31,740
Hello.

650
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:45,280
It really has quieted down.

651
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:31,820
Help!

652
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,280
Xiaozhou!

653
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,710
Xiaozhou!

654
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:35,930
-Help!
-Xiaozhou!

655
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:39,980
Help!

656
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,880
Xiaozhou!

657
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,630
Xiaozhou!

658
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:36,590
