1
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,810
In 1995,

2
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,480
there was a murder in Yun County.

3
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,940
The victim was also a young woman.

4
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:33,540
She looked...

5
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:34,210
Don't!

6
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:35,870
a bit like Shen Xiaozhou.

7
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,050
Don't get in the car.

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,070
Don't get in the car!

9
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,240
Both our names originate from Tang poetry.

10
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,230
To be specific, ocean-themed poems.

11
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,240
"Spring river tides level with the sea"—
that's where your name comes from.

12
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,610
“I will mount a long wind some day
and break the heavy waves。”

13
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,240
I'm not that ambitious.

14
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,450
My favorite lines are,

15
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,570
"The little boat goes this way, vanishes;

16
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,840
To spend the rest of my life
on rivers and seas."

17
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:17,760
What?

18
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,120
You think I'm an underachiever,

19
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:23,230
an illiterate?

20
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:24,840
No.

21
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:28,680
Those lines just sound a bit...

22
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:30,539
lonely.

23
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:40,450
If one day, I leave alone,

24
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:43,340
don't ask me why. Okay?

25
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,150
But why?

26
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,240
Fine.

27
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,240
If that day really comes,

28
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:57,470
it means

29
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:02,940
I've left with you
the best everything I have.

30
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,180
Just keep that in mind.

31
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,500
Why do you always say something like that?

32
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,370
I'm just kidding.

33
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,520
That shell over there is pretty.

34
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,380
Go get it for me.

35
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:20,140
I'll be right back.

36
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,020
That female victim...

37
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,920
had a child.

38
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:11,990
[Beneath the Undertow]

39
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:15,530
[Episode 10]

40
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:23,320
Hello?

41
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,890
Zhang Haoyang didn't make it.

42
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:27,960
Got it.

43
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:31,670
What happened?

44
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:36,690
He was born with cerebral artery stenosis.

45
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,010
The doctor who tried to save him said

46
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,610
the substance injected into him

47
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:43,540
could induce
severe vasoconstriction in the brain.

48
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,770
Vasoconstriction?

49
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:48,890
Isn't that thing supposed to
dilate blood vessels?

50
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,840
According to that couple's confession,

51
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,520
such a condition shouldn't have happened.

52
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,640
But what was injected into Zhang Haoyang
was a mixture of drugs,

53
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,380
which contained complex components.

54
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,580
Guo is still conducting further tests.

55
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,380
Interrogate them.

56
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,590
I'm innocent. I'm truly innocent!

57
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,190
It wasn't his first visit.

58
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,910
He injected the same stuff every time.

59
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,150
How did it go wrong this time?

60
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,690
Tell us who your supplier is.

61
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,290
No one.

62
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,450
I cooked all the drugs on my own.

63
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,890
Did I put in the wrong ingredients?

64
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:23,020
Or one of the steps must've gone wrong.

65
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:25,380
Where were the raw materials from?

66
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,000
Home-grown plants,

67
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,010
like poppies, ephedra, and so on.

68
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:33,090
I know it is illegal to grow these.
I admit guilty.

69
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,570
Are you able to handle
such complex chemical reactions?

70
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,240
Yes. It's not difficult.

71
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,770
Why don't I write down
the equations for you?

72
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,400
What about your equipment?

73
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,960
I quit after making

74
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,210
just one batch of drugs last year.

75
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:49,210
I threw the equipment away long ago.

76
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:50,170
Oh, I know!

77
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,010
The drugs must've expired,

78
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,280
so their purity level dropped.

79
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,690
I'm not good at chemistry,

80
00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:00,930
but I know what you said is pure nonsense.

81
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,910
If you still stick to this story,

82
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,820
then save it for the narcotics squad.

83
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,820
Wait. I...

84
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,640
That mentally challenged young man

85
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,470
is your younger brother, right?

86
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,850
Yes. How's he doing now?

87
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,560
Pretty good. He has a caregiver.

88
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,490
Don't worry.

89
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,780
Once he turns emotionally stable,

90
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,940
we'll send him to a special institution.

91
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,930
His daily needs will be provided for.

92
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:27,690
Thank you.

93
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,720
If you want to get out sooner
to take care of him,

94
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,320
you'd better come clean now.

95
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,690
Where was the injection
that Zhang Haoyang received

96
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:37,690
sourced from?

97
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,500
On the night of June 19th,

98
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,590
besides Zhang Haoyang,

99
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,450
who else came to your place?

100
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,170
You must know the answers
to these two questions.

101
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,380
Some people

102
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,150
brought that anesthetic to us.

103
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,280
It was a potent drug,

104
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,490
which Zhang Haoyang had never used.

105
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:00,690
Who brought it to you?

106
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,280
I didn't see.

107
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,470
They never stepped into the court.

108
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,610
My man usually got in their car
to pick up the drug.

109
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:07,540
What kind of car?

110
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,440
Just an ordinary sedan.

111
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:10,670
A gray one.

112
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:12,790
It was parked far away,

113
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,390
so I couldn't tell its model.

114
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:16,960
Is it the one?

115
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,810
Seems like it.

116
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,760
On the evening of June 19th,

117
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,170
who stopped by your place?

118
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,570
Well... I really don't know.

119
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,650
You finally woke up.

120
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,270
Eat it while it's warm.

121
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,110
I'm not hungry.

122
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,350
If you don't want any noodles,

123
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,720
at least eat the egg.

124
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,450
You need nutrition.

125
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:28,490
Food's ready. Come out to eat.

126
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,480
Mr. Liang, good morning.

127
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:00,740
No.

128
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,370
I've never seen her.

129
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,060
Thanks.

130
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:04,850
Hold on.

131
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,410
Pardon my boldness.

132
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,160
But may I voice an opinion

133
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,750
from an aesthetic perspective?

134
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,640
Aesthetic?

135
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,280
Go ahead.

136
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,490
If I were her,

137
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,040
I'd first fix my teeth

138
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,440
to make myself look prettier.

139
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,340
Looking into dental clinics?

140
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,140
That's even more unreasonable.

141
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,930
How is plastic surgery

142
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:28,390
equal to dental correction?

143
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,200
Anyway,

144
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,060
let's explore this lead first.

145
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,400
But dental clinics

146
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,500
largely outnumber
plastic surgery hospitals.

147
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,960
When will we ever finish
the investigation?

148
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,490
Jia Beibei didn't search for

149
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,680
anything related to
dental correction online.

150
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,800
She probably just saw an ad
on the streets.

151
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,460
We'll start with
canvassing her neighborhood.

152
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,620
Please come in.

153
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,560
Am I early?

154
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:55,370
Not at all. Now is the perfect time.

155
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,160
Come and meet

156
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,440
Mr. Hu from Green Cycle,

157
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,550
a leading corporation in Lingchuan.

158
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,760
We've met before.

159
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:03,130
Yes, we have.

160
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,330
Hello, Director Yue.

161
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,210
I'll leave it to you then.

162
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:09,180
No need. Our talk is finished.
Take a seat.

163
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,010
Yue,

164
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,850
we were discussing
the environmental assessment

165
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:16,800
of Jinhai Phase 3,
namely Xuri Factory's location.

166
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,010
As the project moves forward,

167
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,160
you two would meet up sooner or later.

168
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:19,960
Right, Mr. Hu?

169
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,640
Right. Xuri Factory is

170
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,760
a heavy industrial enterprise after all.

171
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,490
It has operated for many years.

172
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,640
In the surroundings,

173
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,920
there must be some residues

174
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,130
of chemicals and hazardous pollutants,

175
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:33,400
especially chromium,
a kind of heavy metal.

176
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,060
Their impacts on human health

177
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,250
cannot be underestimated.

178
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,710
So, we must
handle the problem with caution.

179
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,700
Sounds very technical.

180
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:45,330
Sorry, I just got carried away

181
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,280
and let out my side
as a former science student.

182
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,560
What I'm trying to say is,

183
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:53,040
if Shen Xiaozhou were alive,

184
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,160
I'd definitely

185
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,520
put her on this project.

186
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:57,800
I'm sure she would be happy

187
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,450
to make a contribution to Xuri Factory.

188
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:15,970
How thoughtful of you, Mr. Hu.

189
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,550
I have a meeting to attend.

190
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:19,810
I'm getting going now.

191
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:16,400
Hello?

192
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:31,350
What happened?

193
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:34,800
-Captain Lian...
-She said he messed this place up.

194
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,370
I didn't.

195
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,330
You did!

196
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,670
She asked to see his supervisor,

197
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,200
so we had to invite you over.

198
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,600
What brings you here?

199
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:44,730
I...

200
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,920
This is his revenge on me,

201
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,850
since I rejected him.

202
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:47,370
You...

203
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,400
I assure you

204
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,660
that he didn't do this.

205
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:55,130
If it had been him,

206
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:57,710
that door wouldn't have been pried open.

207
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:04,160
I had a blind date with her
a few days ago.

208
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,310
She told me she was
a kindergarten teacher.

209
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:10,220
I have a liking for kindergarten teachers.

210
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,480
We were chatting,
and she asked me about our cases.

211
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:16,570
I-I said something I shouldn't have.

212
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,440
What did you tell her?

213
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,210
I said Shen Xiaozhou's killer

214
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,890
was probably different from

215
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:24,280
that of the other victims.

216
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,430
That was all I said.

217
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,310
Captain Lian, I made a mistake.

218
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,280
I'll accept any punishment.

219
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:32,990
Did you smash your phone
last night for this matter?

220
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,970
T-They then disclosed
Zhang Haoyang's story.

221
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,760
That was when I realized
what her job really is.

222
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,680
I confronted her on the phone.

223
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,760
But she still tried to
get more information from me.

224
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,210
I got so furious

225
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,130
t-that I went out of control.

226
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,130
I came here to meet her this morning,

227
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,760
h-hoping to get an explanation.

228
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,640
Here is the surveillance footage.

229
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,560
At about 4 a.m.,

230
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,920
some people in masks entered the complex.

231
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,160
The time matches what the neighbors said.

232
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,290
They made loud noises.

233
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:01,020
The downstairs thought
there was an earthquake.

234
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,660
Zhang Haoyang?

235
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,560
Is it true?

236
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:12,300
Got the tip you want?

237
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,860
Are you going to make a post again?

238
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,950
Most of what you posted last time

239
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,080
was completely fabricated.

240
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,110
Do you understand now?

241
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,920
Even fabricated stories

242
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,550
can be destructive enough

243
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,010
to take a life.

244
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,010
Are you suggesting

245
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,900
Zhang died because we spilled the scoop?

246
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:41,340
As a police officer,

247
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,330
you'd better not frame us.

248
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,130
Do you still want to publish a post?

249
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:59,030
Guess how the public opinion
will backfire on you?

250
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,750
You can try convincing yourself

251
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,670
that you have nothing to do
with his death.

252
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,870
But can you really live with that?

253
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,210
You used to be a journalist.

254
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:21,730
Ruining a man's reputation
with false news—

255
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,270
where is the journalistic integrity?

256
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,020
Shouldn't you at least

257
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,860
provide facts while improving click rates?

258
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,030
Tell me.

259
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,590
Who was your source?

260
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:46,860
The hospital.

261
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:48,760
I meant last time.

262
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,850
Last time,

263
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:57,300
we received an anonymous message.

264
00:16:58,950 --> 00:16:59,950
Written on paper?

265
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:00,980
Yes.

266
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,640
Where is it now?

267
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,579
Long gone.

268
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,069
But I can tell you something.

269
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,890
The previous post went viral

270
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,810
because there were paid cyber trolls
stirring things up.

271
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,000
I didn't hire them.

272
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,290
They just showed up uninvited.

273
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:18,349
I'm telling the truth.

274
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:22,680
I never thought he'd die.

275
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,400
It doesn't hurt.
It's just like an ant bite.

276
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:31,740
I can barely feel it.

277
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,270
Why do I have to be treated with an IV?

278
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:34,530
I've never received one before.

279
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:35,720
You're getting antibiotic drips,

280
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,530
just like I am.

281
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,000
We need anti-inflammatories.

282
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,570
Are you high on painkillers?

283
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,720
This is yours.

284
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,200
Why did you make chicken?

285
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,610
Didn't I tell you already?

286
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:46,890
I need a pork stew

287
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:48,150
to boost blood health.

288
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:49,000
Why did you...

289
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,810
It's not the New Year's or a festival.
Why a pork stew?

290
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:52,720
You're a grown man

291
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,900
who just lost a few drops of blood.
Do you really need that much nutrition?

292
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,530
You're a little fool, I'd say.

293
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:57,850
Couldn't you have dodged

294
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:58,810
those rocks thrown at you?

295
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:00,090
God knows how they hit you.

296
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:01,090
Eat the chicken now.

297
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:01,920
You'd better smarten up.

298
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,810
Does it mean

299
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,690
we can rule out Zhang Haoyang
as a suspect now?

300
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:06,790
Yes.

301
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,150
Those rich kids vouched for him

302
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,380
because they went there that night too.

303
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,380
They had to cover for one another.

304
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,000
It's a speculation.
There's no proof of it.

305
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,310
I made a mistake yesterday

306
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:26,440
by taking action without orders.

307
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,560
Why are you not reprimanding me?

308
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,790
It's enough that you've acknowledged it.

309
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:32,050
Write me a self-criticism report later.

310
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:39,930
Your birthday seems auspicious.

311
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,680
I just picked a random date.

312
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,210
I don't know when I was born.

313
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,830
So you lied about

314
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,490
being born on August 8th?

315
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,160
O-Our discussion on horoscopes
was pointless then, wasn't it?

316
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,390
No wonder you didn't fit the description.

317
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:52,450
How do you not know your own birthday?

318
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,860
I was raised by relatives
in a rural place.

319
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:56,490
Nobody knows when I was born.

320
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,330
Then your mother...

321
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,530
Listen, that's actually a good thing

322
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:05,960
because you can pick a date you like,
right?

323
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,640
Just choose the one you see fit.

324
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,440
August 8th...

325
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,810
Isn't that nice?

326
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:10,610
Impressive.

327
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:11,770
-Right?
-Right.

328
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,090
I heard I was born in spring, in April.

329
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:16,990
Spring...

330
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:20,130
Your name can be "Spring-born", right?

331
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,300
"Spring-born" sounds nice, doesn't it?

332
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,680
-Am I right?
-What nonsense is that?

333
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,890
You were born in the first lunar month.

334
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:26,480
Why isn't your name "First month-born"?

335
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,680
Do you hear yourself?

336
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:29,250
What kind of name is that?

337
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,210
Ignore him.

338
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,240
Have some of this.

339
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,300
Shi Qiangfeng and "Spring-born"...

340
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,000
"Spring-born"...

341
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,860
It sounds nice.

342
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,580
That really sounds nice.

343
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,680
Finish your meal.

344
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,000
Mr. Zhang.

345
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,950
Aren't you ashamed to show up here?

346
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,870
What's the use of you police officers?

347
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,010
Why didn't you crack down
that drug den earlier?

348
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:27,220
A promising young man's life
was destroyed.

349
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,340
His soul was tainted.

350
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:34,340
You failed your due diligence.

351
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,100
You should be responsible for his death!

352
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,420
I'm sorry.

353
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:42,820
I offer you my condolences.

354
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,810
The truth will clear your son's name.

355
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:48,180
Those who spread rumors

356
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,930
will be held legally liable.

357
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,610
Zhang Haoyang was actually a good kid.

358
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,890
He was in pain.

359
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:02,920
Hold on.

360
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:09,640
Haoyang sent me a text message yesterday.

361
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,910
[Dad, I'm guilty. Leave me alone.
Leave me to my fate.]

362
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:23,410
Was he going to turn himself in?

363
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,950
Did he or did he not kill that...

364
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:26,580
He did not.

365
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:28,920
We've ruled him out.

366
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,460
This is all my fault.

367
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:46,200
If I had given more care and freedom

368
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:49,050
to him,

369
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,430
he wouldn't have kept everything from me.

370
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,310
He wouldn't tell me anything!

371
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:09,920
Dad!

372
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:11,980
Hop on, son.

373
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,890
-Let’s go!
-Let’s go!

374
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,870
He's not coming home, is he?

375
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,870
No. He works overtime every day.

376
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:04,130
So what if he comes home?

377
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,660
What are you afraid of?

378
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,000
He's your father.

379
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:10,610
Shu,

380
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,680
your father is the kind of person

381
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,380
who's incapable of saying nice things.

382
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,780
He always seems awkward.

383
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,800
But he has a gentle soul.

384
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:23,860
He just doesn't know
how to express his feelings.

385
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,000
I don't see it.

386
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:27,950
I know you don't see it.

387
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,300
How many years have you known him?

388
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,400
You're more astute than him
in this aspect,

389
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,130
since you're more articulate.

390
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,190
Just be the bigger man.

391
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:39,530
Offer him a truce.

392
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:41,610
Why am I the one to compromise?

393
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:43,340
I'll take a step back if he does.

394
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,330
Just keep in mind

395
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:47,480
that he loves you.

396
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,630
He never says it,

397
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,050
but he's ready to give you everything.

398
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,330
Is it my father we're talking about?

399
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:55,940
Of course it is.

400
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,820
Why else would I have married him?

401
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,350
Look how pretty I am.

402
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:04,130
Mom, I'm leaving.

403
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:06,150
Dinner isn't over yet.

404
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,830
Why did you come home so early today?

405
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:09,680
Don't go.

406
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,100
I only came back to fetch something.

407
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,080
Shu,

408
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,770
I apologize to you.

409
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,210
Please stay.

410
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,240
Let's have a word.

411
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:45,060
As you know, I'm an introverted person.

412
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:51,180
I was even more reserved
when I was little.

413
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,320
I'm somewhat withdrawn.

414
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,200
I'm afraid of talking to others.

415
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,370
I bury everything deep in my heart.

416
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:02,830
Perhaps I'm autistic.

417
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:06,910
Since I'm a police officer,

418
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:08,590
I have to speak a lot.

419
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,810
But I only do that for my work

420
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:12,070
and for solving cases.

421
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,240
In my daily life,

422
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:18,440
I still struggle with communication.

423
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:20,850
On top of that,

424
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:24,130
my patience runs out at work.

425
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,720
That's why I discipline you

426
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,830
with a simple and strict approach.

427
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:40,850
I remember we haven't sat down

428
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:43,770
for a peaceful talk like this

429
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:45,830
since you went to junior high school.

430
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,820
The most recent photo of you on my phone

431
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,900
is from when you were in fourth grade.

432
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:55,570
I don't know much

433
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:59,380
about your inner thoughts.

434
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:07,070
It's fair to say I'm an inadequate father.

435
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:13,380
Shu,

436
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,480
I'm sorry.

437
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,880
I'll try to do better.

438
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,380
Maybe I can't change my personality,

439
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:24,720
but I promise I'll improve
the way I communicate with you.

440
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:29,700
Will you

441
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,020
forgive me this time?

442
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:43,690
Okay.

443
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:51,410
Oh, right.

444
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,930
Have you seen the driver of this car?

445
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:00,510
No. The car didn't stop
and just went away.

446
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,330
I didn't drive it.

447
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,360
I'm sorry.

448
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,920
I know. I know.

449
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,530
By the way,
if you really want to learn to drive,

450
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,690
I'll teach you when you're old enough.

451
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,230
I'm quite a qualified driver.

452
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,110
Of course you are.

453
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:20,330
I've never seen a better driver
than you are.

454
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:22,060
After you finish the learning,

455
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:24,290
if someone suddenly cuts in again

456
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,940
and you can't avoid it,

457
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,100
don't give way.

458
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:28,930
You're doing nothing wrong.

459
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:32,030
Offenders are the ones
who deserve punishment.

460
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,240
Dad, are you giving me life lessons again?

461
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,210
Get a move on.

462
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:45,070
I'll send you to Grandma's home.

463
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:46,440
Are you sure?

464
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,460
Can you help me
talk your mother into staying

465
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:53,000
a few days in Grandma's home with you?

466
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:54,480
Why?

467
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:58,890
I'm busy working cases lately.

468
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,400
I go to work early and come home late.

469
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,260
It disturbs your mother's sleep.

470
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:05,090
She feels bored alone at home.

471
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:09,170
Spending some time with your grandma
will cheer her up.

472
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,940
I'll pick you two up
after the work is over.

473
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:12,850
Okay?

474
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,860
What if Mom declines?

475
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,900
She worries that you can't eat properly.

476
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,750
You figure something out then.

477
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,640
Mom,

478
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,480
Grandma had a dream the other day...

479
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:44,890
Make sure you eat properly.
Don't just eat whatever.

480
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,140
I'll be back in a few days.

481
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:46,740
By the way,

482
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,780
don't forget to water my plants.

483
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,550
It's not the same car.

484
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:31,780
Have you recovered?

485
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:33,600
Completely.

486
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,690
Did Captain Lian not scold you?

487
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,040
He gave me a little lecture
since I got injured.

488
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:47,290
It's okay. I heal quickly.

489
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:48,750
People call me Wolverine.

490
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:54,160
Listen, could you write
a self-criticism report for me?

491
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,780
No. Write it yourself.

492
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,440
This is for you. You need nutrition.

493
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,400
I didn't know I'd get special treatment
for being injured.

494
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,050
In the future...

495
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:09,050
Say it, I dare you.

496
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,370
Why is that comment gone?

497
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,500
Which comment?

498
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,330
I mean a picture someone sent

499
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,280
under the post I told you last time.

500
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:24,030
It was a photo of Xiaozhou
playing the Chinese lute on livestream.

501
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:25,780
Why was it deleted?

502
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,530
I was going to tell Captain Lian about it.

503
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:29,920
Did you take a screenshot?

504
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,530
I did.

505
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,900
You have to eat alone now.

506
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:37,130
I need to find out how this happened.

507
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,100
But what else is there to look for?

508
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,800
A competent technician in the police force

509
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,960
doesn't just take screenshots, right?

510
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,660
Eat your food.

511
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,520
Wash the dishes after you finish.

512
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,120
Have you seen her or not?

513
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,320
I have. I recognized her at first sight.

514
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:11,800
Then why didn't you say it
during the long observation of this photo?

515
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,590
I was looking at her teeth.

516
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:16,190
I was trying to recall

517
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,350
the treatment plan I designed for her.

518
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,650
She was a talkative girl.

519
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,000
I chatted with her for quite a while.

520
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,100
Later on,
I wondered why she never came back.

521
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:30,920
Did she ever mention

522
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,380
why she needed dental correction?

523
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,810
What reason could there be?

524
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,070
She had crooked teeth.

525
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:42,000
Oh right, she said she could be a streamer
after her teeth were fixed.

526
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,300
A streamer?

527
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:44,140
Yes.

528
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,530
Did she mention what kind of streamer?

529
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:52,280
The kind that can make money online,

530
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:55,660
by dancing and singing.

531
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,670
Can't you be more straightforward?

532
00:31:57,670 --> 00:32:01,950
I remember her saying
a company hired her and offered her

533
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,570
a high commission rate.

534
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,000
She also said she could earn back

535
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,720
the cost of dental correction in 15 days.

536
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,520
What company?

537
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:14,350
She didn't tell me.

538
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:21,690
Look into
Wang Yishan's social connections.

539
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:24,420
Let's see if she intended to be
a streamer as well.

540
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:28,140
I thought streamers were self-employed.

541
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,240
Little did I realize
they're backed by companies.

542
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:30,720
Lin Zi!

543
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,520
You're naive.

544
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,010
Do you believe

545
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:38,530
all those internet jokes to be true?

546
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:40,430
A little help here.

547
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:01,090
How are your arms?

548
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:06,000
Still got two of them, fully intact.

549
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:11,380
I'll write

550
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,900
the report right away.

551
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:16,410
That can wait.

552
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,050
This screenshot

553
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:26,050
is from a comment under a viral post.

554
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,360
It was deleted today,

555
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:29,130
so I looked into it.

556
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,920
I traced the account
that posted this comment

557
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,440
on all social media platforms.

558
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,330
Many uses opt to use the same username

559
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:36,660
on different websites.

560
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,570
Luckily,
we got a distinctive username here.

561
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:42,160
It should be "Unrequited Love."

562
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,840
What an illiterate fool.

563
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,530
With this local IP address,

564
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:46,330
I tracked down

565
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,570
to a hidden personal webpage.

566
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:51,240
I think he created

567
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,610
this website on his own.

568
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:55,970
There are many short videos like these,

569
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,510
but none are pornographic.

570
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:03,830
That comment is probably from this video.

571
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:15,770
It's about ten minutes long.

572
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,370
When Shen Xiaozhou started
playing the second piece,

573
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:20,630
viewers began showering her with gifts,

574
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,290
including this user
named "Unrequested Love".

575
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:26,219
I calculated it.

576
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:27,520
In about ten minutes,

577
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,730
he sent gifts that were worth
five to six thousand.

578
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:30,929
Five to six thousand?

579
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:33,000
In yuan or tokens?

580
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:34,250
Equivalent to

581
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,710
five to six thousand yuan.

582
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:37,600
Is he stupid or what?

583
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:39,889
Does he come from a rich family?

584
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:42,290
To add to that,
his comments are very nasty.

585
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:43,900
He kept asking Shen Xiaozhou
to show more skin.

586
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:44,960
Quite disgusting.

587
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:48,190
In the end,
Shen Xiaozho stopped streaming.

588
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:02,320
This is the profile picture
on his homepage.

589
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,920
You can't see his whole face.

590
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,170
He looks familiar.

591
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,890
Do you know him?

592
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,040
No.

593
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:11,460
I mean the settings behind him.

594
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:15,090
I know what place it is.

595
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:16,850
Well done.

596
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,890
Well done.

597
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:32,080
Green Cycle?

598
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,890
That's the tip of their leaf logo?

599
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,650
It means this user "Unrequested Love"

600
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:42,520
has probably seen Shen Xiaozhou in flesh.

601
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:49,620
Could it be possible
that Shen Xiaozhou planned

602
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:52,060
to report this man's lewd behavior
to the company

603
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,690
after she discovered he was the viewer
who tipped her on her live channel?

604
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:56,370
-Therefore, he...
-After we reach Green Cycle,

605
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:58,100
don't let out our real purpose.

606
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:00,080
When we confirm he's a suspect,

607
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,060
we'll take him away for an interview.

608
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:02,770
Why?

609
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:06,320
This case seems
more complicated than we think.

610
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,440
There are secrets behind the killer.

611
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:12,810
Like having accomplices?

612
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:13,740
What do you mean?

613
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,590
It's just a hunch I have.

614
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:21,850
We're simply

615
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,530
scratching the surface

616
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:26,010
of Shen Xiaozhou's murder.

617
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:29,110
We haven't found the key to it yet.

618
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:31,480
Mr. Hu is in a meeting.

619
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,540
Would you like me to go get him?

620
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,150
No need. We'll wait.

621
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:36,250
Where's the restroom?

622
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,840
Go in and turn right into that corner.

623
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,470
-Thank you.
-I'm thirsty.

624
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:42,470
Get me some water.

625
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:43,250
Let me do it.

626
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:43,730
No need.

627
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:45,660
You do your job. I'll get the water.

628
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:33,820
I'm terribly sorry.

629
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:36,080
It's okay. No need to wipe it.

630
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,080
Your co-worker must've
gone to the restroom.

631
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:38,920
When he comes back,

632
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,160
please tell him I'm sorry.

633
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,820
He's taking a few days' leave.

634
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:56,730
Captain Lian, sorry,
I was having a meeting.

635
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:57,970
Let's talk inside.

636
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,330
Don't bother. It's just a quick question.

637
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,710
Did Shen Xiaozhou

638
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:06,340
ever request

639
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:08,470
an advance payment?

640
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,250
Or,

641
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,240
did the company
make her an advance payment?

642
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,390
No, never.

643
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:18,750
Then I need an affidavit
from the finance department.

644
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:20,120
It's a trifle.

645
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,620
Why didn't you just give me a call?

646
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,880
We're bound by rules to ask you in person.

647
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:27,090
Oh, right.
The case hasn't been solved yet.

648
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,530
The scope of investigation
will be expanded.

649
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:33,040
Could you give me a name list

650
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:34,510
of all your employees?

651
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,370
We just need their names, ID numbers,
phone numbers and addresses.

652
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,530
No problem.
I'll print a list out right away.

653
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:42,530
By the way, Officer Lian, thank you

654
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:44,680
for keeping that incident secret.

655
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,770
I got something.

656
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:55,110
It's him. What's his name?

657
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:58,720
Huang Bin.
He happens to be on a leave these days.

658
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,440
Too convenient, huh?

659
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:09,120
Haiyi Garden.

660
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:26,770
Could he have fled?

661
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,250
What's his phone number?

662
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:29,910
Have the tech crew locate him.

663
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:31,890
Who are you?

664
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,160
Shen Xiaozhou visited your office
a few times.

665
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,030
You've seen her in flesh, right?

666
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,220
The murdered girl?

667
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,190
I heard she was a new recruit.

668
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:50,940
You recognized her
the moment you saw her, right?

669
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,600
I-I hadn't met her before.

670
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,330
How was I able to recognize her?

671
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,870
You sent her gifts
that were worth several thousand.

672
00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:59,400
I think you'd remember her.

673
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,810
What do you mean by that?

674
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,840
You're the user "Unrequested Love",
aren't you?

675
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,340
Did Shen Xiaozhou know it was you?

676
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,730
How would she know?
I used an anonymous account.

677
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:38,930
You're not that hard to find.

678
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:40,730
It took us only half an hour

679
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:42,480
to track you down.

680
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,080
She realized it was you.

681
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,560
You thought your life would be miserable
in the office ever after.

682
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,560
She couldn't have realized it was me.

683
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,690
When she saw me in the office that time,

684
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:54,200
she was very friendly.

685
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:58,110
But someone did find out the truth, right?

686
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:02,020
Otherwise, why would you
have deleted the screenshots?

687
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:05,990
Did someone force you to do so?

688
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:09,120
No, it's not true.
It was I who decided to delete them.

689
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:10,750
But why?

690
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:13,850
You did what you did

691
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:16,120
with the purpose of letting everyone know

692
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,220
that Shen Xiaozhou was not

693
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,970
sweet and innocent as she appeared to be.

694
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:24,350
You held grievances against her.

695
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,260
But has it ever occurred to you

696
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:31,850
that maybe Shen Xiaozhou didn't hate you

697
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:35,700
and that she might even
be grateful to you?

698
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,370
You tipped her
several thousand all at once.

699
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:39,770
She must've seen it.

700
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:41,850
But...

701
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,440
she didn't respond to me at all.

702
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:50,140
Maybe she had a reason she couldn't tell.

703
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,040
Did Shen Xiaozhou become a streamer

704
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:57,000
on her own accord

705
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:00,300
or against her will?

706
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,730
Is the person
who forced you to delete these pictures

707
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:06,290
also worried

708
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:09,490
that people would know
Shen Xiaozhou's job as a streamer?

709
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:13,170
Someone did force you
to delete the photos, right?

710
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,440
If not,

711
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,250
you would've refuted me

712
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:19,140
without hesitation.

713
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:26,200
Could you

714
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,400
protect me?

715
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:30,920
Yes.

716
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:32,210
We can transfer you

717
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:34,820
to a police-designated hospital
for recovery,

718
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,480
where you'll be taken care of.

719
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,120
They...

720
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:43,260
beat me up.

721
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,330
"They"? More than one person?

722
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:46,480
It was a gang.

723
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,600
They still beat me with rods
after I deleted the pictures.

724
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,400
Who were they?

725
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,040
They were all in masks,

726
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,120
concealing their faces.

727
00:42:58,170 --> 00:42:59,700
I pretended to have fainted

728
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:00,810
and heard them making a call,

729
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:03,400
reporting to someone called Ao.

730
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:06,080
Ao?

731
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:29,620
Do you think

732
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:33,210
Shen Xiaozhou was

733
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,730
really the kind of person
Chen Hui described?

734
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,210
What?

735
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:47,850
She didn't strike me

736
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:53,780
as someone who'd choose to be a streamer.

737
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:56,890
What's wrong with being a streamer?

738
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,600
She streamed in a bedroom,

739
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:05,230
instead of her college dorm or her home.

740
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,090
Our investigation results

741
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,340
show that she didn't rent a place.

742
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:15,020
Where could that bedroom be?

743
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:20,540
Could she be living a secret double life?

744
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:23,890
So what if she was different from

745
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:25,060
what we think?

746
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:31,340
Given her education level, personality
and perceptions of things,

747
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:33,270
she shouldn't have taken that job.

748
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:34,970
It's not something shameful.

749
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:37,520
She just wanted to
make money for her family.

750
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,650
But that wasn't a suitable way for her.

751
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:40,850
What do you mean?

752
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:44,920
Improper, frivolous and undignified?

753
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:45,550
No.

754
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,120
Maybe I'm just out of touch
with the times.

755
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,090
I always feel that...

756
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:51,950
What does your generation think?

757
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:54,040
Do you always despise

758
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:55,410
girls like her?

759
00:44:59,200 --> 00:44:59,830
I'm reminded of

760
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:02,500
the victims
of the former cases I dealt with.

761
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,880
They were preoccupied with pursuing

762
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,210
things that would make their lives easier.

763
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:08,810
Attaining something easily

764
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:11,070
seems to give rise to an addiction

765
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,480
that lures people into going down

766
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:16,850
a dark and smooth path

767
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:20,540
till they end up being destroyed
by these things.

768
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:22,370
Are you saying...

769
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,820
That those girls deserved death?

770
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,480
That all was their fault,

771
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:29,040
and that they had it coming?

772
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,440
Then why are we police
still working cases?

773
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:34,540
What are you talking about?

774
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,040
Hello?

775
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:41,820
I have a finding.

776
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,080
In Lingchuan,

777
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,390
there's only one man named Ao.

778
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:45,920
His real name is Ao Xiaojie.

779
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:48,400
Well, about this man...

780
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,890
He is...

781
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,520
How should I put it?

782
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,730
A crab's pincers are also called

783
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:54,130
"Ao" in mandarin, right?

784
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:01,920
Ao Xiaojie is

785
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,770
a prominent figure in the local area.

786
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:06,330
He owns a company called
Da'ao Cultural Communication Co., Ltd.,

787
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:08,930
which mainly focuses on
livestream business.

788
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:09,920
My finding shows

789
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,980
he has signed more than 20 streamers.

790
00:46:12,290 --> 00:46:13,520
Including Shen Xiaozhou?

791
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,920
No. She seemed to be on probation.

792
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:18,320
This company was investigated last year,

793
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,720
fined
for presenting vulgar performances,

794
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,120
and ordered to rectify its conduct.

795
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:24,500
But it seems like... it's still operating.

796
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,830
This company is precisely located in...

797
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:27,910
Baoyang Building?

798
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,210
Yes, exactly.

799
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:32,160
"Ao"

800
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:34,350
refers to Ao Xiaojie.

801
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:45,640
Instead of our office,

802
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:48,220
let's head to Ao Xiaojie's company first.

803
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:50,730
Right now?

804
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,210
It's too late. They must be off work.

805
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:56,340
People in their line of business
start working at night.

806
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:01,480
From Wu Bo,

807
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:04,230
the first suspect of this case,

808
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:08,020
to Chen Hui and Zhang Haoyang,

809
00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:10,370
there has been a certain someone,

810
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:13,560
or a force, fighting us,

811
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,650
trying to misguide our investigation.

812
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:21,440
You think it's Ao Xiaojie?

813
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:25,560
I think...

814
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:28,920
we're about to find the key

815
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:31,330
to this case.
