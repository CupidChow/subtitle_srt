[Episode 12]

3
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,030
Hello, is this Zhou Xiaonan?

4
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,120
Yes.

5
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,280
I'm an orthopedic doctor
from the Third Hospital.

6
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,630
You need to come in
for a follow-up as soon as possible.

7
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,950
But didn't we agree on three weeks later?

8
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,950
Well,

9
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,190
our chief

10
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,870
reviewed your scans.

11
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,630
He suggests you come in today,

12
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,680
preferably before his shift ends.

13
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,600
Okay, I'll come over right now.

14
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,000
Go on in.

15
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,200
Xiaonan.

16
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:27,030
Have a seat.

17
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,490
Please, have a seat.

18
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,390
I've reviewed
all your recent medical records.

19
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,450
Why did you have so many injuries?

20
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,520
Fractured fingers,

21
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,150
subcutaneous hemorrhage,

22
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,150
shoulder dislocation,

23
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,680
soft tissue contusions,

24
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,710
and vaginal laceration...

25
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,360
Are you really a doctor or...

26
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,070
Don't worry.

27
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,910
I'm a police officer.

28
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,510
The injuries are the doctors' concern.

29
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,910
The cause of the injuries is our concern.

30
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,240
I didn't file a report.

31
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,840
Even if you didn't,
we still have to investigate.

32
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,150
These injuries of yours...

33
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,380
they're from assault
and sexual violence, right?

34
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,310
That's a crime.

35
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,930
You're not local, are you?

36
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,079
Where's your hometown?

37
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,430
Sichuan.

38
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,899
Are your parents still around?

39
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,510
Can you not tell them?

40
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,390
Do you want to go home?

41
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,030
I do.

42
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,409
But I owe so much money,

43
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,550
I can't go back.

44
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:39,390
Yes, you can,

45
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,480
as long as we catch
those people who hurt you,

46
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,480
you can go home.

47
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,920
But first,

48
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,310
you have to tell me everything you know,

49
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,870
with every single detail.

50
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,880
I promise you, none of them can get away.

51
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,050
I've talked to her.

52
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,410
I told her to go back to work

53
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,660
as if nothing happened.

54
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,810
We'll act quickly.

55
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,950
You think she can handle it?

56
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,620
I think so, she's quite tough.

57
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,320
What's on your mind?

58
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,280
They all have keys to our rooms.

59
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,270
That night, several men came in.

60
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,150
Was Ao Xiaojie there?

61
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:40,070
Someone said Ao thinks we're too cheap,

62
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,730
but they don't mind.

63
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,159
Hey, Ma.

64
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,040
Qin, it's me.

65
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,240
Do you remember

66
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,720
that case our team worked on?

67
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,240
The one about Ao Xiaojie's company?

68
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,560
The shady live streaming one?

69
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,360
Yeah, yeah.

70
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,920
It got shut down and restructured.
Why are you asking?

71
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,120
I heard someone died.

72
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,600
One of the undercover agents went missing.

73
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,390
Could it be that

74
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,510
Ao Xiaojie had them silenced?

75
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,000
I can't tell you that.

76
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,750
Don't make me break the rules.

77
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,160
But I can share my personal opinion.

78
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,950
Ao Xiaojie is vicious and calculating.

79
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,070
By the way, why are you asking about this?

80
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,480
Nothing, nothing,

81
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,430
I'm just overthinking.

82
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,000
You know me...

83
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,360
blind but nosy.

84
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,720
Nonsense.
I'll take you to a movie sometime.

85
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,250
Get lost.

86
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,090
[Baoyang Building]

87
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,740
Police. Where is Ao Xiaojie?

88
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,920
♪ Sometimes when you lose,
you can't help but resent it ♪

89
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,800
Let me teach you.

90
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,800
Don't be nervous.

91
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,590
Come on, repeat after me.

92
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:15,870
Thank you, top donor.

93
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,680
Thank you, top donor.

94
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,000
Be sweeter.

95
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,000
Sending you a heart sign.

96
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,080
Sending you a heart sign.

97
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,160
Make a bigger one.

98
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,990
Here, let me show you, like this.

99
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:31,200
Right, lift your chest.

100
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,120
Chest up, that's right.

101
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,930
That was a Royal Salute gift just now.

102
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,190
If someone gifts a Lamborghini,

103
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,270
you need to make this gesture, got it?

104
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,040
Who is it? So annoying.

105
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,640
What are you doing here?

106
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,400
Qiangfeng, you're still so imposing.

107
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,240
Come on, make a heart sign for him.

108
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,200
Get out. Tell them to leave.

109
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,980
Alright, alright.

110
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,480
Dayong, get them a small room.

111
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,140
Let them hang out there first.

112
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,690
All of you, come with me.

113
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,000
So... did I pass the audition?

114
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,190
Can I be a streamer?

115
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:21,280
A streamer needs to learn
how to listen first.

116
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:21,830
Go ahead.

117
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,740
Qiangfeng, what's up?

118
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,870
I need you to do somtehing.
Come with me.

119
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,179
Where are we going?

120
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,130
Back to the station...

121
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,330
to turn yourself in.

122
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,360
I mean, if I'm turning myself in,

123
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,160
at least I should know
what I'm being charged with.

124
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,500
We were reckless and foolish before.

125
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,930
We did some impulsive things,

126
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:01,740
but at least we knew

127
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,240
what lines should never be crossed.

128
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,630
What did I do?

129
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,560
You did something inhuman.

130
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,770
I'm getting more confused.

131
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,770
Besides Shen Xiaozhou,

132
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,660
do you know Wang Yishan and Jia Beibei?

133
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,040
I mean...

134
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,320
it's the first time
I've heard these names.

135
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:29,980
Qiangfeng.

136
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,220
Really?

137
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,890
This is the room

138
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,800
where you granted their wish
to become streamers, right?

139
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,630
Qiangfeng, hold on,

140
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,090
let me think this through.

141
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,790
Last time you said

142
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,200
that Shen Xiaozhou was dead, right?

143
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,830
Are those two people you just mentioned

144
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,630
also dead?

145
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,290
Hold on, Qiangfeng,

146
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:06,410
please don't scare me with this.

147
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,000
You're a police now.

148
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,200
And I...

149
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,240
yes, I am a jerk,

150
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:13,060
but I'm still the same person
you've always known.

151
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:15,620
I, Ao Xiaojie, would never harm a woman.

152
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,080
Tell me the truth.

153
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,730
How exactly do you manage those girls?

154
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,860
How else would I manage them?

155
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,840
It's just an employment relationship.

156
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,600
I'm the boss,

157
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,000
and they're the employees.

158
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,080
Our company culture
is all about mutual respect

159
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,030
and humanized management.

160
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,840
Nonesense!

161
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,950
Assault, sexual abuse,

162
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,020
threats and blackmail...

163
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,110
you call that humanized management?

164
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,360
Shi Qiangfeng,

165
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,240
You're a police now,

166
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,390
every word you say carries weight.

167
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:19,840
You can't speak carelessly,

168
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,440
One wrong word
can ruin someone's life, got it?

169
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,390
You don't believe me?

170
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,320
Fine, let's go upstairs right now,

171
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,120
I'll call all the girls out,

172
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,120
and you can ask them one by one, okay?

173
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,670
You already did?

174
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,670
Wait, who told you?

175
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,370
It was Cherry, wasn't it?

176
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,070
She didn't say anything.

177
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,510
Then, someone's trying to frame me!

178
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,320
Qiangfeng!

179
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,010
I...

180
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,270
They probably just thought
I didn't give them enough commission.

181
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,730
Don't talk nonsense to me.

182
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,920
You know what kind of person I am.

183
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,660
Would I come to you if I had no proof?

184
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,560
Right now,

185
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:13,490
is the building already
surrounded by police?

186
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,060
If we arrest them now,

187
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:43,240
Ao Xiaojie can easily claim
he knows nothing about it,

188
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,830
blame it all on his subordinates.

189
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:45,900
We should take down his whole gang,

190
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,830
and then break them down one by one.

191
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,880
Sir, I request to take the lead

192
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,320
and get a confession from Ao Xiaojie.

193
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,480
That's what I was thinking too.

194
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,950
But you can't force it,

195
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,200
that's not your style.

196
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:10,070
If you act differently,
he'll notice something's wrong.

197
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,240
Understood.

198
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,450
I'll just act on my style.

199
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,800
You think I can't take you in by myself?

200
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,520
Qiangfeng,

201
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,320
you were my brother,

202
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,550
and you still are.

203
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,450
Wherever you say I go, I'll go.

204
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,920
Confessing now is for your own good.

205
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:40,950
I understand.

206
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,080
Once the main force storms in,

207
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,880
it'll be a different situation.

208
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:52,550
Qiangfeng, I have one more request.

209
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,960
Before we leave, let's sing a song.

210
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,600
It's been a while.

211
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,800
Let's just let it out.

212
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,390
I can't sing.

213
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,520
It's okay, Qiangfeng, come on.

214
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,550
You sit. I'll sing, and you just listen.

215
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,390
It's too loud.

216
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:29,200
It's fine, the soundproofing is good.

217
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,130
What's going on?

218
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,450
Why are they singing now?

219
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:34,980
Don't worry, if anything's off,
Shi Qiangfeng will let us know.

220
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,050

00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,340
Shi Qiangfeng?

245
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:17,550
What are you guys doing?

246
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,070
Let him go! Let him go!

247
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,280
Let him go!

248
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,120
Ao Xiaojie!

00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:47,850
You animal!

250
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:57,470
Go! Let's go!

251
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:07,640
I'm sorry.

252
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,130
Ao Xiaojie, do you know what you're doing?

253
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,010
Go give him an injection.

254
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,250
Don't move.

255
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,210
Come on, hold him down.

256
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,300
Stay still.

257
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,400
Hello?

258
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:19,650
Is this Lian Haiping?

259
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,920
Yes, who's this?

260
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,960
This is Ma Chaoqun.

261
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:26,040
I used to be with the East City Unit.
I'm retired now, health reasons.

262
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,240
That kid Shi Qiangfeng and I were close.

263
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,030
Ma, I remember you.

264
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,000
What can I do for you?

265
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,200
Are you currently investigating

266
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,240
someone named Ao Xiaojie?

267
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,600
Feng is in good shape,

268
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,750
one shot might not be enough, right?

269
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:41,940
Not enough. Give him another shot.

270
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:45,320
Boss, two shots...

271
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:47,450
might get him killed, right?

272
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,680
Here's the thing.

273
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:53,380
Shi Qiangfeng has a history
with Ao Xiaojie.

274
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,750
But he doesn't really know
who Ao Xiaojie really is.

275
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,070
Ao Xiaojie is very cunning,

276
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:00,380
ruthless,

277
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,210
and he's done
plenty of backstabbing things.

278
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,120
As for Shi Qiangfeng,

279
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,720
this kid is very straightforward,

280
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,760
I'm afraid he's no match for Ao.

281
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:13,410
Is he on an assignment tonight?

282
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,020
I've called him several times
but he didn't answer.

283
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,830
Don't worry, Shi Qiangfeng
won't act recklessly.

284
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:25,040
Qiangfeng, just sleep. It won't hurt.

285
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,470
You guys can leave now.

286
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:00,910
I know this sounds silly,

287
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,890
but my eyelid keeps twitching.

288
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:05,440
I have a really bad feeling.

289
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,800
Please ask him

290
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,400
to call me back.

291
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,050
Alright, don't worry.

292
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:24,960
Sorry,

293
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:27,530
the number you've dialed is powered off.

294
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,370
The situation has changed,

295
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:30,830
arrest them immediately.

296
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:34,820
The rat's nest is flooded.

297
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,170
Catch them all, don't let anyone escape.

298
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,500
Where is Shi Qiangfeng?

299
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,380
Stop! Don't run!

300
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,070
Freeze! Stop!

301
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,850
Stop running! Freeze!

302
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,210
Stop!

303
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,270
Don't run! Stop!

304
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,680
Stop! Don't move!

305
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:00,830
Stop!

306
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:05,840
Stop!

307
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,320
Stop!

308
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,270
Stop! Freeze!

309
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:10,930
Don't move!

310
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,400
Let's go.

311
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,770
Police! Where's Ao Xiaojie?

312
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,200
Help! Somebody help!

313
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,430
Help... help.

314
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,240
Where?

315
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:50,880
Let's go.

316
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,080
Shi...

317
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,320
Shi Qiangfeng.

318
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,480
Wake up! Wake up!

319
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,840
What's he doing with his hand?

320
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,370
He doesn't want to pass out,

321
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,410
so he's trying to stay conscious
by hurting himself.

322
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,750
Shi Qiangfeng.

323
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,710
Tra-tracker.

324
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:25,030
The tracker.

325
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:27,880
The... tracker...

326
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,600
Ao Xiaojie...

327
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,260
Shi Qiangfeng's tracker

328
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,240
should be on Ao Xiaojie.

329
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:48,760
Shi Qiangfeng's signal is moving.

330
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,490
He's on Baoshan Road right now.

331
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,190
Where...

332
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:00,880
are we going?

333
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,090
To the hospital.

334
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,030
Go catch Ao Xiaojie...

335
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,560
Don't worry, we've got people after him.

336
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,490
We're not afraid of him running away.

337
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,490
Even if he escapes, we can catch him.

338
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,160
Am I...

339
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,350
going to die?

340
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,720
Nonsense! You have to stay well for me.

341
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:26,250
We'll be at the hospital soon.

342
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:27,360
Hang in there.

343
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:36,810
The tire seems flat!

344
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,550
When was the last time
you checked this car?

345
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,910
Don't you know to maintain a getaway car?

346
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:52,300
Can't you learn how to change a tire?

347
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,530
Why are you yelling at me?

348
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:55,530
I don't usually do this kind of work!

349
00:24:59,270 --> 00:24:59,880
Fine.

350
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,880
Take the money and run.

351
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,170
Hurry up.

352
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,270
Quickly.

353
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,810
-Hurry up, Dayong!
-What the heck is this?

354
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:10,360
Dayong, be careful!

355
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:13,990
Jie, run!

356
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:15,680
Hit him!

357
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:32,930
Come out!

358
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:34,920
Get out!

359
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,450
Hit him!

360
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:38,920
Dayong!

361
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,920
Police are coming! Kun, let's go!

362
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,270
Kun, we gotta go, hurry!

363
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:26,640
Kun, the police are here!

364
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,680
Hurry, the police are coming!

365
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,880
Kun, we need to go now!

366
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,210
Where's Ao Xiaojie?

367
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,480
I don't know.

368
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:03,600
He ran away.

369
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,550
Come out, Ao Xiaojie.

370
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,000
I know...

371
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,660

00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:01,500
Okay.

555
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:33,720
Get back!

556
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:51,800
Yun Fan, come back!

557
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:52,730
I just got some really good tea.

558
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,690
Do you want some?

559
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,320
Don't worry about him.

560
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:04,310
Shi Qiangfeng is tough as nails.

561
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,000
I'm not worried.

562
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,070
Alright.

563
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,730
Give me some too.

564
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,910
You're using cold water?

565
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:26,190
What a waste of my good tea.

566
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,210
Look at you,

567
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:30,110
you look so distracted.

568
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:31,810
I might as well give you half the day off.

569
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:33,140
Just go to the hospital.

570
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:34,970
Why would I go to the hospital?

571
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:19,670
Thanks, Dad,

572
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:20,730
I'll head over now.

573
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:26,960
Uncles and aunties,

574
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,750
come on, let's have a drink together.

575
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:29,930
Thank you, everyone.

576
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:30,480
Thanks.

577
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,110
It's my turn.

578
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,840
Stop playing. Eat and drink more.

579
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,800
We had a deal.

580
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:48,930
I have to play.

581
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:09,360
Dance of the Golden Snake.
