1
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:32,860
My hand!

2
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:07,650
Come on.

3
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,690
[Beneath the Undertow]

4
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,320
[Episode 13]

5
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,430
Where is he?

6
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,960
Wasn't he supposed to be in the hospital?

7
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,540
He's gone.

8
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,340
He's gone?

9
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,520
Wasn't he poisoned?

10
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,570
And he was still able to run around?

11
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:01,380
He could.

12
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:02,750
He just came back

13
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,950
and took Sui Xiao out.

14
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,670
That's what love can do.

15
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,530
Where is Ao Xiaojie?

16
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,930
What's on your mind?

17
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,720
Just nervous.

18
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,240
Can you let go of my hand now?

19
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,310
No.

20
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,800
This... this kid is so thoughtless,

21
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:48,000
bringing you here without any notice.

22
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,240
Is... is my place too messy?

23
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,360
It's fine,

24
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,150
not messy.

25
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,400
Quite clean, actually.

26
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,280
He comes over to help me clean
whenever he's free.

27
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,740
I can't even chase him off.

28
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,330
Did he tell you who I am?

29
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,110
He told me on the way here.

30
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,770
I'm just wondering

31
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,800
why he brought you to my place.

32
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,800
He said...

33
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,360
you're his only family now.

34
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,630
And you're

35
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,040
the only girl he's ever brought here.

36
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,680
I don't mean anything else by that.

37
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,190
I-I don't mean

38
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,120
that he's dated many girls before.

39
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,360
He's... You...

40
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,150
you know what I mean.

41
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,040
-He's never had a girlfriend.
-I know, I know.

42
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,600
I get it.

43
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,830
The fact that he brought you here...

44
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,659
means he's really serious about you.

45
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,159
I'll go check on him.

46
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:51,510
Okay, okay, go ahead.

47
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,160
How did you get this?

48
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,380
From a spiked club.

49
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,120
Got it back when I was
still young and foolish.

50
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,570
I also have knife scars on my body.

51
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,850
That won't put you off, will it?

52
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,720
Aren't you all grown up now?

53
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,120
What are you doing?

54
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,750
Yang,

55
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,240
this is not the place.

56
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,200
You...

57
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:43,480
In-law.

58
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,510
You...

59
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,700
What are you going to do?

60
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,190
Sit down.

61
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,390
Dad.

62
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:54,190
Yang.

63
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,830
You walking jinx,

64
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,590
who invited you here?

65
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,800
-Yang, what are you doing?
-Let go! Let go of it!

66
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,190
Don't do this!

67
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:00,950
What are you doing?

68
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,120
I'm not your dad!

69
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,310
Yang!

70
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,710
Yang, what are you doing?

71
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,510
Yang!

72
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,190
Yang!

73
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:07,830
Get lost!

74
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,240
This is your son's wedding, Yang!

75
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,190
Can you stop causing a scene?

76
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,830
Have some decency!

77
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,460
He has decency.

78
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,640
Go be with him, then!

79
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:15,390
In...

80
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,040
Get out of here!

81
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,950
I'm a complete joke!

82
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,480
You still wanna drink?

83
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,830
None of you get to drink!

84
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,150
None of you!

85
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,070
Mom.

86
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,360
Let's go back.

87
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,310
Let's go.

88
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,270
-Let's go.
-Tang Juan.

89
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,700
We're better off
not marrying into a family like this.

90
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,230
Let's go.

91
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,240
Yang Baoge!

92
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,900
Keep flipping!

93
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,800
Come on!

94
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,510
Knock everything over!

95
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,070
Kill me.

96
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,110
Kill me.

97
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:51,990
Kill me!

98
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,020
Kill me now!

99
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,600
Come on!

100
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,440
Flip everything over!

101
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,360
Screw it all!

102
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,920
Sui Xiao is a good girl,

103
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,950
you lucky dog.

104
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,160
What are you talking about?

105
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,210
Nothing, nothing.

106
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,180
Leave these peanuts here.

107
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,040
Now that Ao Xiaojie has been arrested,

108
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,240
I feel like a huge weight's been lifted.

109
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:36,950
I know.

110
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,240
He helped you, and you see him as a buddy.

111
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,860
But I'm afraid you can't see through him.

112
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,510
He's not like you.

113
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,659
He's calculating and ambitious.

114
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:51,600
I once tried to help him
get on the right track,

115
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,159
but what did he do?

116
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,350
He thought I was trying to
throw him in jail.

117
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,800
These eyes of mine...

118
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,830
they're very likely his doing.

119
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,080
Dad, what's wrong?

120
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,870
Xiaozhou?

121
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,640
I'm sorry, Xiaozhou.

122
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,320
I'm sorry.

123
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:59,720
Dad didn't take good care of your pipa.

124
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:09,080
Dad couldn't protect your pipa.

125
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,600
I'm sorry.

126
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,550
Since yesterday,

127
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,580
Ao Xiaojie hasn't said anything useful—

128
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:28,150
he just keeps beating around the bush
and dodging questions.

129
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,270
When questioned about the girls
being beaten and sexually assaulted,

130
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,150
he claims it was due to
poor supervision of his men

131
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,790
and that he never personally participated.

132
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,790
As for the murder,

133
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,000
he flatly denies it.

134
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,240
Someone attacked him
before we could get to him.

135
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,270
Yes.

136
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,550
Someone wanted to silence him.

137
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,600
Who would do that?

138
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,120
He probably knows

139
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,510
but won't say.

140
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,390
That Shark,

141
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:58,600
Sha Hongli, was probably silenced too.

142
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,600
I thought Ao Xiaojie was the one
behind all of this,

143
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,910
but now it seems

144
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,720
he's just another pawn.

145
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,600
He was about to be silenced,

146
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,720
yet he still won't talk?

147
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,080
This only shows
that the real mastermind is very powerful,

148
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,440
with a far reach.

149
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,200
This case

150
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,960
is no longer just a simple murder.

151
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,050
The more we pull at this thread,

152
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,670
the deeper it goes.

153
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:30,750
Well... what about Dayong, the one

154
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,750
who escaped with Ao Xiaojie?

155
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,950
He's in the hospital.

156
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,600
They managed to save him,

157
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,120
but he's badly injured.

158
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,980
Did Ao Xiaojie witness

159
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,120
Dayong getting beaten like that?

160
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:43,790
Yes.

161
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,870
But during the interrogation,

162
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,320
Ao Xiaojie

163
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,120
didn't ask about
Dayong's condition even once?

164
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,030
Not a word.

165
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,610
He's just an ungrateful scumbag.

166
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,670
He's definitely not the loyal type,

167
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,240
but not asking even once...

168
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,030
You think...

169
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,870
Sir, Shi Qiangfeng wants to
beat up Ao Xiaojie.

170
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,670
-Stop! You can't go in there!
-What are you doing?

171
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,070
I'm warning you, don't do anything stupid!

172
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,000
That was just angry talk.

173
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,930
I won't beat him.

174
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,120
I just want to ask him something.

175
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,720
No!

176
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,870
You can't!

177
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,270
I won't beat him.

178
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,640
I just need to ask him something.

179
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,040
Interrogations must follow protocol.

180
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,600
Fine, I'll ask after you're done.

181
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,200
But...

182
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,480
I have a request.

183
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,580
Did you see these clearly?

184
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,000
He's badly injured,

185
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,680
but his life isn't in danger.

186
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,910
What's that saying?

187
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,570
"If you do the crime,

188
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,960
you do the time."

189
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,270
The person who beat him should also pay.

190
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,860
You don't need to act like you don't care.

191
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,860
Having someone you care about

192
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:25,130
isn't something to be ashamed of.

193
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:26,670
Don't worry,

194
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,080
we've already coordinated with
the detention center.

195
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,280
We'll guarantee your absolute safety.

196
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,270
You're not just saying that, right?

197
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:34,960
No.

198
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,670
Wait... what's he doing here?

199
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,510
I may be blind,

200
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:01,120
but I'm still a cop.

201
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,440
You've already retired.

202
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,570
Can you still interrogate me?

203
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,630
After retiring from active duty,

204
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,830
I became a community patrol officer,

205
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:14,960
and now I'm assigned to
assist with this special case.

206
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,020
You're some kind of big deal now, kid.

207
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:20,450
Feng.

208
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,750
Feng, I didn't mean to kill you.

209
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,750
That drug wasn't pure—I watered it down.

210
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,910
You know I only sell watered-down stuff...

211
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:26,720
Cut that out.

212
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:28,720
I know.

213
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,270
You don't have the guts to kill anyone.

214
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,010
Otherwise, he'd be dead already.

215
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:35,870
Yeah.

216
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,080
Exactly.

217
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:39,390
Ao Xiaojie,

218
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,250
how long have we known each other?

219
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,550
I remember...

220
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,600
I knew you

221
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,320
even before I met him.

222
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,410
Back then, you were just a kid,

223
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,600
small in size and small in courage.

224
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:57,050
You liked tagging along with adults.

225
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:00,710
You never rush to be at the front
when doing things.

226
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,360
Actually, you aren't a bad kid.

227
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,000
You just lacked affection
while growing up,

228
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,400
afraid of being bullied.

229
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,390
People,

230
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,600
we always need to learn self-preservation.

231
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,630
And you're smart,

232
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,070
quick-witted,

233
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,080
and a fast learner
who knows how to get by.

234
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,670
In this regard, you're better than he is.

235
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,360
That's why you kept making me
go to school back then.

236
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,290
I'm not cut out for that.

237
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,720
You've always been the clever one.

238
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:35,720
Sharp.

239
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,840
So when you do things,

240
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,130
you weigh the pros and cons,

241
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,960
avoid danger, and see the advantage.

242
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,960
Being the first to stick your neck out

243
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,960
isn't your style.

244
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,600
You never take things too far.

245
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:50,550
Right?

246
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,670
They told me

247
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,330
what you've done these years.

248
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,240
Just as I thought,

249
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,320
you're still just a sidekick.

250
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,790
Murder?

251
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,480
You don't have the guts for it.

252
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:09,080
I don't believe
there isn't a boss behind you.

253
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,240
You need to think this through.

254
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,670
Take responsibility for your own crimes.

255
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,670
You're still young.

256
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,270
If you confess,

257
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,820
you might get a reduced sentence.

258
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,200
After you serve your time,

259
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,130
you can still start your life over.

260
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,150
Look at me.

261
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,600
I'm already this old.

262
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,320
Look at the state I'm in now,

263
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,570
and even I can start a new life.

264
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,140
Right?

265
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,480
An accident ruined my eyes.

266
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,270
Xiaojie,

267
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,800
you didn't do this to me, did you?

268
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,080
Tell the truth.

269
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,750
Or was it your boss behind that?

270
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,480
Who was it?

271
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,880
-It really wasn't me.
-Tell the truth!

272
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,870
It was Kun.

273
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,820
He mentioned it to me once.

274
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,600
He said
that no one would bother me anymore.

275
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,630
Who is Kun?

276
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:29,360
He's the guy who does the dirty work.

277
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,560
The one who wanted me dead this time
is definitely him too.

278
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,130
He's extremely ruthless.

279
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,480
He has a nickname in the underworld,

280
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:39,840
"Reaper."

281
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,910
But none of us dares to call him that.

282
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,510
Who does he do dirty work for?

283
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,120
Xiaojie,

284
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,750
since you're going to spill,

285
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,910
spill it all.

286
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,349
Li Dada.

287
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,440
Li Dada?

288
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,109
Yeah.

289
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,440
Why does Li Dada want to silence you?

290
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,040
He's the money behind me.

291
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,920
My company

292
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,440
and the KTV business

293
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,790
are both his.

294
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,550
I'm just a street thug.

295
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,610
Where would I get the money
to start something this big?

296
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,310
I'm the front man,

297
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,520
and Kun handles all the dirty work.

298
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,720
My streamers—

299
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,370
I screen them once,

300
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,370
and then Li Dada picks from them again.

301
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,450
If he sees someone he likes,

302
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,200
I take her to attend

303
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,680
those secret parties he organizes.

304
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,750
But I'm not allowed into these parties,

305
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,000
so I don't know what happens there,

306
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,420
and I don't dare to ask.

307
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:58,550
Those two...

308
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,510
who died...

309
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,180
I know that one of them had been there.

310
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,330
And the other one...

311
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,680
someone took her there.

312
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:10,830
The loan shark, Shark.

313
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:18,070
Yeah, I do know too much.

314
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,860
What about Shen Xiaozhou?

315
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:22,470
Shen Xiaozhou never went to those parties.

316
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:25,720
She only did a couple of livestreams
before she left.

317
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,280
And I never saw her again.

318
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,350
At that time,

319
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:31,240
Li Dada made me force that nerd
to delete his post,

320
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,470
and I found it a bit weird.

321
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,790
Why do you think
he didn't want people to know

322
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:39,440
that Shen Xiaozhou had worked
as a streamer?

323
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,590
Because he didn't want us to
trace it back to you

324
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,720
and then to him.

325
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,410
Shen Xiaozhou was actually...

326
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:51,830
introduced to me by Li Dada
at Zhang Haoyang's request.

327
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,640
She genuinely wanted to work to earn money

328
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,240
because her family was poor.

329
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,240
But I just don't get

330
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,840
why someone like her exists.

331
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,400
With such a rich backing,

332
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,860
she still insisted on
earning mere pennies.

333
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,960
She was so contradictory.

334
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,680
She clearly cared a lot about money.

335
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,790
When we discussed the commission split,

336
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,480
she haggled over
one or two percentage points

337
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,270
for ages,

338
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,440
calculating everything
down to the last penny.

339
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,160
And then,

340
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,310
she just quit without warning

341
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,960
and didn't take a single cent.

342
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,510
Who else from your company

343
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,240
attended Li Dada's secret parties?

344
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:26,720
Tell us.

345
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,260
We'll protect everyone who's involved.

346
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,590
No one else.

347
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,720
No one else.

348
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:42,710
Whenever someone went to that party...

349
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,720
I never saw her again.

350
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:58,830
Who is it?

351
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,750
Still awake?

352
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,840
Sorry to disturb you.

353
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,480
What's wrong?

354
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:06,920
I owe you an apology.

355
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,030
I failed to deal with Ao Xiaojie.

356
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,440
Forget it,

357
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,480
he won't dare speak carelessly anyway.

358
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,880
Ao Xiaojie has no family,

359
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,920
so he's hard to control.

360
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:29,050
So you need to be more careful
from now on.

361
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,490
You can just be more careful for me.

362
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,440
Ma.

363
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,400
How did you meet Shi Qiangfeng?

364
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,480
I arrested him near the railway.

365
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,750
He was 17 that year.

366
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:58,590
He got into a fight at the train station
while trying to help someone.

367
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,650
He, alone against five or six of them,

368
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,210
got beaten bloody,

369
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,880
yet still held out.

370
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,610
It took me a lot of effort
to become friends with him.

371
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,080
He only started calling me "Uncle"
after more than a year.

372
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,550
He's good at heart.

373
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,200
He has that heroic spirit in him.

374
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,680
Like a rough diamond—

375
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,080
with some polishing,
it could become a gem.

376
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:24,480
Look, the police academy did just that.

377
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,030
Let's go, Ma.

378
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,430
You've made a contribution.

379
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:34,240
Watch it. What do you mean,
"I made a contribution"?

380
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,070
It was all thanks to Lian's arrangements.

381
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,470
Lian, we're heading out.

382
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,060
Ao Xiaojie confessed

383
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:51,130
that Jia Beibei attended
Li Dada's secret parties.

384
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:52,600
And Wang Yishan

385
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,930
was probably brought there
by Shark, Sha Hongli.

386
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,750
This Sha Hongli

387
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,920
is very likely Li Dada's puppet too.

388
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,880
Now all the evidence

389
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,680
points to Li Dada.

390
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,010
We should make him our primary suspect

391
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,160
and focus the investigation on him.

392
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,160
Investigate him,

393
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,830
but covertly,
without revealing our intentions.

394
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,310
His father, Li Longhe,

395
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,160
is the boss of Jinhai Group,

396
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,170
a celebrity entrepreneur.

397
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,510
We can't afford a repeat

398
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:23,770
of the internet controversy
with Zhang Haoyang last time.

399
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,920
We need to get solid evidence
before making a move,

400
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,780
and when we strike, we finish him.

401
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,750
Chief Qiu,

402
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,410
any further instructions?

403
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,660
Even though all the clues point to
Li Dada...

404
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:44,960
we still

405
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,000
don't know who attended those parties

406
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,500
or what exactly happened there.

407
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,200
Anyone who attended those parties

408
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,000
is a suspect.

409
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,750
But this killer

410
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,920
has his own specific preferences
and signature.

411
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:05,400
He is a typical...

412
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:09,460
sexual psychopath.

413
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,590
So we need to continue verifying
and eliminating suspects.

414
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,160
Lian Haiping.

415
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:20,130
Do you think Li Dada fits the profile?

416
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,350
I've met him twice.

417
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,160
Based on his personality and behavior,

418
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,240
I'd say there's a 70% chance.

419
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,920
Plus, he's predominantly left-handed.

420
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,380
Come here. I won't hit you.

421
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:42,070
But Shen Xiaozhou...

422
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,250
What about Shen Xiaozhou?

423
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,880
Do you remember?

424
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:52,400
The morning after Shen Xiaozhou's case,

425
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:53,920
he hit someone with his car,

426
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,780
and I took him back to the station.

427
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,750
He was extremely agitated at that time.

428
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:02,140
Yes, very excited.

429
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:05,750
Actually...

430
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:11,070
that isn't the state someone'd be in
right after committing murder.

431
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,850
On the contrary,

432
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:16,030
he should have been relatively calm

433
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:18,370
after getting the satisfaction.

434
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,030
Are you saying

435
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,850
that Shen Xiaozhou might not have
been killed by him?

436
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:31,400
I don't know.

437
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,790
Look, to clean the oyster,

438
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,110
from here, like this.

439
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:06,000
Press down, but watch your fingers.

440
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:07,650
Don't flick it.

441
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,510
Take two eggs.

442
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,750
See? Two of them.

443
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:11,960
TV.

444
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:13,830
Watch me and learn.

445
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,240
You can watch TV after you learn this.

446
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,680
Only after you've learned it.

447
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,740
Come on, look at me.

448
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:18,680
Crack them.

449
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,400
TV.

450
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,000
Be good.

451
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,960
Weather forecast...

452
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,830
Watch me and learn.

453
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,240
You can watch TV
after you've learned this.

454
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,240
Be good, Xiaohai.

455
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,270
Beating the eggs well.

456
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:28,790
Watch.

457
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:29,920
For a small serving,

458
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,480
two spoonfuls are enough.

459
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,570
-TV...
-Like this.

460
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,070
-Watch me.
-TV...

461
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:34,680
Watch me!

462
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,680
TV!

463
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,270
No TV!

464
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,480
No TV until you've learned this!

465
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:45,110
What's all this noise about?

466
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,920
Alright, alright, alright.

467
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,030
Xiaohai.

468
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:53,660
The TV is on.

469
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:54,780
Come watch.

470
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:58,000
Meanwhile, as the cold air
moves southward,

471
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,790
heavy rainfall is expected
in Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu...

472
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:01,830
Xiaozhou...

473
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,160
Possibly accompanied by thunderstorms.

474
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,070
What?

475
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:07,200
Why do you insist on teaching him this?

476
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,200
When Xiaozhou was alive,

477
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,600
he had someone to rely on!

478
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:12,750
What should we do now?

479
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:15,330
One day, when the two of us are gone...

480
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:17,120
he can only rely on himself.

481
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,270
Beijing...

482
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,920
Xiaozhou...

483
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,200
Beijing...

484
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,250
-Hello, Captain Lian.
-Hello, Captain Lian.

485
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,040
My mom made some steamed buns

486
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,300
and insisted that I bring some to you.

487
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,510
Thank Mom for me.

488
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,310
How's Shu doing?

489
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,690
He's being good. Don't worry.

490
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,570
I'm heading to work now.

491
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,960
What?

492
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,110
Nothing. Go ahead.

493
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,590
Talk after the case is solved?

494
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,920
Okay, we'll talk
after the case is solved.

495
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:01,230
I'm off. Eat the buns while they're hot.

496
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,440
Meeting time.

497
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,370
Let me brief you.

498
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,750
Ao Xiaojie has provided us with the names

499
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,680
of several girls who attended

500
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,140
Li Dada's secret parties.

501
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,110
After our investigation, we found

502
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:41,550
that they all left Lingchuan
within the past year or two.

503
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:45,070
We've confirmed the whereabouts of
three of them.

504
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,440
Two returned to Northeast China,

505
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,770
and one went to Sichuan.

506
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,130
The others are still unaccounted for.

507
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,930
Whether Li Dada is a pervert or not,

508
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,960
those people probably witnessed
whatever happened.

509
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,350
So were they scared off,

510
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:58,410
or were they deliberately sent away?

511
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,550
Go find them.

512
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,720
We've already assigned three teams

513
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,880
and will depart shortly.

514
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,000
Be prepared.

515
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,480
Those girls are probably
even more frightened than Ao Xiaojie.

516
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,740
As long as we can find one
willing to talk,

517
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,070
things will get easier.

518
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:11,640
Sir,

519
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,640
someone called in,

520
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,870
saying they have information about
the Shen Xiaozhou case.

521
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:15,630
Who is it?

522
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,070
An elderly couple.

523
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,400
Were you both employees
of the Xuri Factory?

524
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,000
No,

525
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:24,070
we run a small business.

526
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:27,400
But it'd be nice
if we were from Xuri Factory.

527
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,070
Why's that?

528
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:31,790
Didn't Xuri Factory shut down long ago?

529
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,310
That's the good part.

530
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,440
Xuri Factory owns buildings and land,

531
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,840
and when these are demolished, they'll
get oceanview apartments in exchange.

532
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,580
Now, with this murder case,

533
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,680
I'm afraid the demolition
and housing allocation

534
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,070
will likely be delayed.

535
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:49,420
I heard the boss has changed his mind

536
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,590
and is looking at other locations now.

537
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,550
We don't know much about that.

538
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,780
Is the information you're reporting today

539
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,200
related to Shen Xiaozhou?

540
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,740
What I want to talk about is Yang Tao.

541
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:05,000
No, not Yang Tao.

542
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,430
It's Yang Tao's father.

543
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,200
Right,

544
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,270
it's Yang Tao's father,

545
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:10,240
Yang Baoge.

546
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,960
Yang... Yang Baoge...

547
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,430
What's his connection to Shen Xiaozhou?

548
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:17,310
He has some connection
to Shen Xiaozhou's father.

549
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,350
We've heard about it for a long time.

550
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:21,400
Well... Yang Baoge

551
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,240
has issues with Shen Huazhang.

552
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,430
At yesterday's wedding,

553
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:26,680
the way he behaved—

554
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:28,920
it wasn't just dislike;

555
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,510
it was like they had a real grudge.

556
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,640
Yang Tao's wedding?

557
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,270
Yes.

558
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,110
Yang Baoge

559
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,510
ruined it.

560
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,270
Yesterday, he got drunk
and caused a scene.

561
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:41,560
He didn't show us any respect
at that wedding.

562
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,440
I'd never let my daughter

563
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,200
marry into a family like that.

564
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:48,100
Good thing they haven't gotten
their marriage certificates yet.

565
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,590
Then why doesn't

566
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:52,960
Yang Baoge like Shen Huazhang?

567
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:54,200
Because of his wife.

568
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:55,860
Yang Tao's mother.

569
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,440
Back when they were young,

570
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,920
she and Shen Huazhang

571
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,110
had a thing going on.

572
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,350
But that's all ancient history.

573
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,830
So many years have passed,

574
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:07,310
yet they still hold grudges
like teenagers.

575
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:11,140
How did you know all this?

576
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:15,490
Yang Tao came to our house last night
to apologize,

577
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,160
and I got it out of him.

578
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:20,310
Because their family has
a good relationship with the Shens,

579
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:23,110
they didn't even set off firecrackers
at the wedding.

580
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:26,400
All out of respect
because the Shen family's daughter died.

581
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,720
I think that Yang Tao

582
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,720
doesn't look like Yang Baoge at all.

583
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,040
At the wedding yesterday,

584
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,200
Shen Huazhang was present.

585
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,110
And I realized

586
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:35,550
that Yang Tao actually looks
quite similar to him.

587
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:37,510
They both have that fair complexion.

588
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:39,160
Do you think it could be that...

589
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,560
Don't make wild guesses.

590
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:44,310
But... Yang Baoge

591
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:46,310
really does have a terrible temper.

592
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:47,800
H-He's a drunkard,

593
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:49,930
beating his son whenever he drinks.

594
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:51,350
The way he beats Yang Tao,

595
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,830
you'd think the boy wasn't even his child.

596
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,030
Yang Tao still has scars

597
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,960
on his back from his belt beatings.

598
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:57,890
Exactly.

599
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,110
We should stay as far away
from such a family as possible.

600
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,480
If they've really done

601
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,480
something deadly,

602
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,540
how could our daughter live with him?

603
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:10,710
You think Yang Baoge might have...

604
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:19,080
Alright.

605
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,270
I understand the situation
you've reported.

606
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:24,890
Thank you.

607
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:25,630
Okay.

608
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:27,540
Oh, right.

609
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,920
Well, I heard

610
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,350
that the Shen family's daughter

611
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:33,880
was found in the sewage tank
at Xuri Factory,

612
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:34,920
right?

613
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,310
Before Yang Baoge

614
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,480
was laid off, he worked at

615
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,550
the wastewater treatment plant
of the factory.

616
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,390
Hello?

617
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:52,200
Hello,

618
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,270
is this Mr. Shi?

619
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:53,920
Your DNA test results

620
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,240
are ready.

621
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,750
You may come pick them up
at your convenience.

622
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:58,830
Okay, got it.

623
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,790
You think the information they gave
is helpful?

624
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,960
I think they just want to
break off the engagement.

625
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,440
Still, we can't ignore any leads, right?

626
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:18,910
There are already many suspicious aspects

627
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,180
surrounding Shen Xiaozhou's case.

628
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:27,070
It's connected to those other two cases
but also different.

629
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,350
Haven't we seen
this kind of unexpected situation

630
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,480
in previous complex cases

631
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,000
as well?

632
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,340
The least suspicious person
turned out to be the real culprit.

633
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,650
Have we looked into
Yang Baoge's background?

634
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,190
He has a criminal record.

635
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:45,200
When he was young, he often picked fights
and got into brawls,

636
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:47,640
serving time twice for injuring others.

637
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,930
If Yang Tao is
really Shen Huazhang's child,

638
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:55,270
I think we can't rule out

639
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:57,650
the possibility
that he killed Shen Xiaozhou

640
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:59,450
to get revenge on Shen Huazhang.

641
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,600
Okay,

642
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:05,820
then continue with your investigation.

643
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,650
Right now, Li Dada is the main suspect

644
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:08,880
with many complications.

645
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,150
Zhao Hougang has already sent out
three teams,

646
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:12,720
so we're a bit short on manpower.

647
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,830
Allocate your men.

648
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,030
Keep what you need,

649
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,630
and send the rest to help him.

650
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,080
One of you follows me,

651
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,240
and the rest cooperate well
with Team Leader Zhao.

652
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:28,600
Yes, sir.

653
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,790
Don't worry, we'll cooperate fully.

654
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:31,880
You're not included.

655
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,070
We won't fight with Unit Two.

656
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,070
I want to arrest Li Dada.

657
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:36,070
Not arrest, investigate.

658
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,920
Investigate, then arrest.

659
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,030
You're planning to join them?

660
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:41,000
Have you thought it through?

661
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,790
Yes, I have.

662
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:43,820
You can go.

663
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:45,910
You follow me.

664
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,380
Captain Lian,

665
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:02,800
I'm sorry.

666
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,270
It's about Ma, right?

667
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,320
Don't worry,

668
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:10,949
I won't act impulsively.

669
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,630
Lin Zi has more experience than you.

670
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,960
Cooperate with him well

671
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,230
and avoid any conflicts.

672
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:19,560
Call me anytime if there are any problems.

673
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,150
G-Got it.

674
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:56,370
The place we just saw is
a bit too small, isn't it?

675
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,150
Actually, there's another apartment
on the fifth floor.

676
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,880
I'll take you up to see it in a moment.

677
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,140
Okay, I'll take a look.

678
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,050
I'm thirsty.

679
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,090
I'll go get something to drink.

680
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:08,470
Someone needs to stay in the car!

681
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,500
Bring me a drink,

682
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,160
a cold one.

683
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,880
Okay, got it.

684
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,400
Jia, are you busy?

685
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,590
I need a favor.

686
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:47,830
Officer Zheng, you're here.

687
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:49,230
Yesterday,

688
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,290
I don't know
if I caught a draft right here

689
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:53,000
or slept wrong, but my neck is

690
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:54,030
really stiff.

691
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:55,430
Let me massage it for you.

692
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:57,710
Who all went to

693
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,190
Yang Tao's wedding the other day?

694
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,940
I heard there was some trouble?

695
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,280
You bet there was.

696
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:07,070
Yang Tao and his father
even flipped over the tables.

697
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,920
But Yang Tao is a good kid.

698
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,360
His father, though, that's another story.

699
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,070
His son was getting married,
and he was causing a drunken scene.

700
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,150
What a joke.

701
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,510
Behaving like an animal at his age.

702
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:17,280
Yang Baoge was causing a scene...

703
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,710
I-I heard it was because of Shen Huazhang?

704
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,760
He's been jealous for decades.

705
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:24,960
He couldn't hold back
all that jealousy anymore.

706
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,230
Can't really blame him.

707
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,440
Back in the day,
Shen Huazhang and Ding Shulan

708
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:32,110
made quite a good couple,

709
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:32,750
right?

710
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,760
Weren't they on TV together?

711
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,230
Yes.

712
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:36,150
They were.

713
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:38,170
In the 1990 city performance,

714
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,840
they represented our factory in the show.

715
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,280
One played the pipa,

716
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,030
while the other performed...
well, a folk dance.

717
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,030
Their skill level

718
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,710
wasn't just local TV—

719
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,630
it was national broadcast quality.

720
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,150
Then, why didn't they...

721
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,670
end up together?

722
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,320
Well, in 1991,

723
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:58,440
Shen Huazhang's parents both got sick.

724
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,070
So, he

725
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,920
had no time to play the pipa anymore.

726
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,880
And because of that,

727
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,440
he and Ding Shulan

728
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:05,090
spent less time together.

729
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,550
Plus, Sun Qiuhong was
head over heels for him.

730
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,730
She worked in our factory canteen!

731
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:12,840
So she brought food
to his parents every day

732
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:16,000
and took care of them impeccably.

733
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:17,710
And then later,

734
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,130
Ding Shulan suddenly married Yang Baoge.

735
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,230
So Shen Huazhang and Sun Qiuhong

736
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,190
became a couple.

737
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,880
Tell us something we don't know.

738
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,110
Everyone in our factory knows about that.

739
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,880
Do you know why they really broke up?

740
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,230
What other reasons could there be?

741
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:32,400
Sun Qiuhong is wife material,

742
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,070
but Ding Shulan isn't.

743
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,280
Who do you think
Shen Huazhang should choose?

744
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,210
That's just you.

745
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,690
You think Shen Huazhang is
the same as you?

746
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,400
When did Shen Huazhang and Ding Shulan

747
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,590
break up in 1991?

748
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,010
It was in the winter of 1991.

749
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:50,360
My son was just born at that time,

750
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,360
in the same hospital as his parents.

751
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,190
Officer.

752
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,360
Can this case be solved?

753
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:59,630
Definitely.

754
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,440
Until it's solved,

755
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:04,480
we won't have peace of mind.

756
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,670
You just want a sea-view apartment, huh?

757
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:07,920
Cut the crap!

758
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,960
Xiaozhou was one of our own
at the Xuri Factory.

759
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:12,870
Such a promising young woman...

760
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,810
and someone killed her.

761
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,320
This revenge must be taken.

762
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,590
Yes.

763
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,030
Must be.

764
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,480
If Shen Huazhang and Ding Shulan

765
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:28,960
really broke up in the winter of 1991...

766
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:33,320
I remember that Yang Tao

767
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,000
was born in the summer of 1992.

768
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,860
Your memory is quite precise.

769
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,720
It's hot.

770
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:39,590
I'm getting a bit hungry.

771
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:42,050
Go get me something to eat.

772
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,060
Twice-cooked pork rice bowl.

773
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,760
He just went in.

774
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,230
What's that?

775
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:23,370
Why did you buy river snail rice noodles?

776
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:25,150
Haven't you ever tailed someone before?

777
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:26,280
This stuff stinks,

778
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,360
with soup and all.

779
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:29,730
This is the worst food for stakeouts.

780
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,710
With this smell,

781
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:40,110
everything I eat stinks.

782
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,680
At this distance,

783
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,000
we're bound to get stuck at the red light.

784
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,590
You're practically on his bumper.

785
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:05,880
Do you have no hand-eye coordination
or something?

786
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,080
Let me drive. Come on.

787
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:09,030
Can you shut up?

788
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,360
My driving's top three on the team.

789
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:18,030
Then Captain Lian must be the number one.

790
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:19,070
He drives like

791
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,480
he's in The Bourne Identity or something.

792
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,360
His driving

793
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:23,840
is fast and steady.

794
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:26,430
Especially his keen sense of distance.

795
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:28,320
He doesn't even need to hit the brakes

796
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,710
and just slips through any gap.

797
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:30,280
So smooth...

798
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,410
Is Lian Haiping your dad or something?

799
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:57,960
Hello, this is a residential area.

800
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,630
May I ask whom you're looking for?

801
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:00,560
Hello, officer.

802
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:03,030
Which building
does that car owner live in?

803
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:04,430
He lives in Building 902.

804
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:39,840
Hello.

805
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:41,510
I'm tailing Li Dada,

806
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:43,110
and he just took a girl home.

807
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:45,830
But I can't get a clear view
of his villa right now.

808
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:46,760
What should I do?

809
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,190
I'm afraid I won't make it in time
if he makes a move.

810
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:51,120
Where did he pick up this girl from?

811
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:52,000
A bar.

812
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:53,800
None of the previous victims

813
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,530
were taken directly from bars.

814
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:57,200
Understood.

815
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:58,850
I'll keep watching.

816
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,000
Li Dada is fast.

817
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:30,630
It's only been about an hour.

818
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:32,230
One hour...

819
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,570
and I've got about 100 mosquito bites.

820
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:45,510
I forgot.

821
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:47,370
Are they itchy?

822
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,230
Where are you going?

823
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,210
I'm asking you where you're going.

824
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,150
The food is in the pot.

825
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:10,280
You can eat it later.

826
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,590
Next time when cooking, open the gas valve

827
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,780
and ignite it with a flame.

828
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,880
Otherwise, it won't ignite.

829
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:20,190
Oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, and such—

830
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:22,120
I've put them all where you can see.

831
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,760
And I've written down all the recipes

832
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,440
of those dishes you like.

833
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:27,670
They're under the jar at the bottom.

834
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:30,190
What do you mean by all of this?

835
00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:31,720
Are you going on a long trip?

836
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,620
You know how to use the washing machine.

837
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:35,280
Xiaozhou already taught you.

838
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,020
Don't use too much detergent.

839
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:38,400
Hang the laundry out in the morning,

840
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,400
and remember to bring it in at night.

841
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,550
What exactly are you trying to do?

842
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:44,760
Tell me!

843
00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:51,360
The other day on TV,

844
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,760
I saw a bakery

845
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:57,530
in the provincial capital

846
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:01,320
that specifically hires people
like Xiaohai.

847
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:03,790
I want to take him there to see

848
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,040
if they'll accept him as an apprentice.

849
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:16,790
How...

850
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,120
how long will you be gone?

851
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,260
If it works out,

852
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,840
we'll stay there.

853
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:29,880
Fine,

854
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:31,120
just go.

855
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,330
If you don't want to come back,
then don't!

856
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:36,760
Xiaozhou's case hasn't been solved yet,

857
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,480
and you're already abandoning this home!

858
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,840
You only care about Xiaohai,

859
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:40,670
not Xiaozhou.

860
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:42,660
Wasn't Xiaozhou your child too?

861
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:18,440
You used to work at
the wastewater treatment plant too?

862
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:19,190
Yeah.

863
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:21,310
That Yang Baoge,

864
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,900
he's got a bad temper and a petty mind.

865
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,440
He doesn't get along with anyone.

866
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,240
That's right.

867
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:28,030
We've all had our suspicions

868
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:30,630
that his son definitely isn't
his biological child.

869
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:31,500
Just look at him.

870
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,150
He looks like Black Whirlwind himself,

871
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:35,360
yet somehow has produced
such a fair-skinned son?

872
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,510
What did his ancestors do
to deserve such luck?

873
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:38,710
He's a real son of a bitch!

874
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:39,970
I've got beef with him!

875
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
One time, I made a joke about him.

876
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:43,360
Was it about his son?

877
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:45,130
Yeah, I'd barely started the joke

878
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:47,440
when he grabbed me
and threw me into the settling tank.

879
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,480
The same tank where you found

880
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,030
the Shen family's daughter.

881
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:52,290
If someone hadn't been quick enough
to shut the valve,

882
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:55,620
I would've been sucked into
the discharge pipe into the sea!

883
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:15,200
I heard you attended Yang Tao's wedding,

884
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,730
and things got unpleasant.

885
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:18,800
Yes.

886
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:21,480
I shouldn't have gone.

887
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,030
Did you have any previous conflict

888
00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:27,590
with Yang Tao's father, Yang Baoge?

889
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:28,460
No,

890
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,760
never even spoken to him.

891
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:34,830
You're on good terms with
Yang Tao's mother, Ding Shulan?

892
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:36,710
Yeah, we're okay.

893
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:41,480
But what does that have to do with
the case?

894
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:45,000
I need to ask you a question

895
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,630
that might be... uncomfortable,

896
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:50,960
but I hope you'll answer honestly.

897
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:55,630
Is Yang Tao your son?
