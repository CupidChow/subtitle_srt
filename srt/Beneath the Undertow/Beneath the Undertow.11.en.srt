If you want it, it's yours.

5
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,820
I want it. Of course I do.

6
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,520
How much does it cost?

7
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,530
Don't worry about that.

8
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,920
But you can't keep this house.

9
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,480
You'll need to sell it after a while.

10
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:24,160
That way, you can also recover
the money you lost.

11
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,530
Fine, let's sell it then.

12
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,390
I don't care about houses anyway.

After that,

14
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,940
I want to send you both abroad.

Abroad?

16

Why go abroad when everything's fine here?

17

Chunxia won't find a job anytime soon,

18
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:44,759
and she doesn't want to work anyway,

19
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:48,110
so she might as well
continue studying abroad.

00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:54,979

also be working with them?

Think about it, first they give out
high-interest loans for plastic surgery,

Where did she stream?

00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:44,450
Right here in the company.

Shen Xiaozhou, right?

00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,880
She's naturally beautiful,

92
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,090
has great camera presence,

93
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,920
and a distinctive personality.

94
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,950
At that time, I thought she

95
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,880
had the potential to be a huge star,

96
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,360
but she only streamed twice,

97
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,430
then refused to continue no matter what.

98
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,920
She quit? Why?

99
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,240
The fans were too enthusiastic.

100
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,480
She's a college student, and she's shy.

101
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,210
I guess she couldn't handle it.

102
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,480
Being a livestreamer

103
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,480
may look easy,

104
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,680

112
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,600
that we can barely
keep our heads above water.

113
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,480
Information that's unrelated to us

114
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,680
brings no value.

115
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,750
Honestly, we just don't have the time
to care.

116
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,409
If you didn't know about this,

117
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,800
then why were you looking for her?

118
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,800

with your company?

How did she end up working here?

121
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,360
A buddy of mine introduced her to me.

122
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:08,750

124
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,120
Zhang Haoyang is your buddy?

125
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,680
He used to come to
the karaoke studio downstairs often.

126
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,680
That's how we met.

127
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:23,270
Haven't seen him for quite a while now.

128
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,170
How do your streamers

129
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,720
work here?

130
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,160
Can we take a look?

131
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,600
Of course, Sir.

00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,620

Have you noticed

136
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,680
they all look the same?

137
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,430
They must have had their plastic surgery
done from the same mold.

138
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,090
I really can't tell who's who.

139
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,600
Our company and the karaoke studio
downstairs

140
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,800
have the same layout,

141
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,410
but we didn't spend as much on decoration.

142
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Each of our rooms is different inside.

143
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,480

huge profits with no investment.

153
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,080
Sir,

154
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,080
you're mistaken about that.

155
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,010
Not to mention the space we occupy,

156
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,790
training a streamer

157
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:35,030
requires a significant investment.

158
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,200
Competition is really fierce nowadays.

159
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,330
Even with talent, you need promotion.

160
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,390
Growing followers, boosting traffic,

161
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:44,080
creating buzz,
and organizing offline meet-ups,

162
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,280
all these cost money.

163
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:48,710
Boost traffic? So you need to hire
click farms too?

164
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,200
We have our own team.

165
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:57,080
These days,
every industry competes for traffic.

166
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,280
Traffic equals cost.

167
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,030
Also, I have a rule:

168
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,360
the streamers of my company
can't use beauty filters.

169
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,120
They can use skin smoothing at most.

170
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,550
Those who look like goddesses
with filters on

171
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,670
but frogs without them,

172
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,730
we won't hire them.

173
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,670
We don't rely on that.

174
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,720
We can't deceive consumers, right?

175
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,450
Here, let me show you this.

176
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,870
Thank you for the little gift, dear Zhang.

177
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,870
Those who need plastic surgery
will get it.

178
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,670
We don't rely on software
to enhance looks,

179
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,670
but upgrade the hardware directly.

180
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,450
Should I call them out

181
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,320
for you two to inspect?

182
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,510
No need.

183
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:34,960
Dayong.

184
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:35,780
Yes.

185
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:42,300
My darlings,
I need to step out for a moment.

186
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,200
I'll be back soon.

187
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,330
My streamer also went to the bathroom.

188
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,890
What's going on?

189
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,630
They even go to the bathroom
at the same time,

190
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,560
like they're clones or something.

191
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,630
Ladies.

192
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,990
Today, we have two police officers
visiting our company.

193
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,240
Everyone, perk up,

194
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,600
show some spirit,

195
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,600
demonstrate your talent,

196
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,000
and sing a song for our two officers.

197
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,910
Sing "Those Who Dare to Fight Will Win,"
okay?

198
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:04,960
Okay.

199
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,440
Stop the singing. Let them go back.

200
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,550
Maybe we should listen anyway.

201
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,090
Thank you for the opportunity, Sir.

202
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:17,890
Is everyone ready?

203
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,270
Yes.

204
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,320
Ready?

205
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:21,630
Go!

That was embarrassing.

215
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,090

She's back. She's back.

225
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,980
Your streamer's back.

226
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,000
So it's true?

227
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,630
They really went to the bathroom?

228
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,560
But the bathroom can't be that big.

229
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,650
What's going on?

230
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,360
Why did they follow us here?

231
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,810
You already knew about my past,
didn't you?

232
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,620
Before becoming a cop,

233
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,680
I was someone just like Ao Xiaojie.

234
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,670
I didn't know.

235
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,370
As police officers,

236
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,390
you're the model,

237
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,480
while I'm the underachiever.

238
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,030
Underachievers always looks down
on models,

239
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,600
probably because they're afraid

240
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,730
others will discover their dark past.

241
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,850
History isn't important.

242
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:48,760
What matters is what history
has made you become.

243
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,370
Do you know this person?

244
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,780
It looks a bit like her, but not quite.

245
00:12:58,810 --> 00:12:59,930
Look at her chin.

246
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,850
She's had plastic surgery.

247
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,510
That explains it.

248
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,870
She didn't look like this before.

249
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:05,840
Her name is Cherry.

250
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,630
Cherry?

251
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:08,240
Yes.

252
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,150
Her real name is Xu Ying.

253
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,480
Cherry is her nickname.

254
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,670
Did Cherry... Use to like you?

255
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,440
Yeah.

256
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,950
Ask her out tomorrow.

257
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,720
I don't like her at all.

258
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,320
Besides, I'm now...

259
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,050
This is an investigation task.

260
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:28,240
Ao Xiaojie is very good at
using click farms.

261
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,380
Yao Guangbo from Fengyun Headlines said

262
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:35,270
that the click farms
who hyped up Zhang Haoyang's trending post

263
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:36,910
came without being hired.

264
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,360
Hello?

265
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,480
Bro.

266
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,290
Those two cops have been here.

267
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,500
Seems they've figured it out.

268
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:41,670
Understood.

269
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,180
I said exactly what you told me to.

270
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:03,790
Hello?

271
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,170
Hello, Haiping.

272
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:07,200
About that kid, I've asked around.

273
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,240
What did you find?

274
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,700
He was born in April 1992,

275
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,080
and right after birth, his mother

276
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,110
sent him to live with relatives
in the countryside.

277
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:17,550
I grew up with relatives
in the countryside.

278
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,960
Nobody knows my exact birth date.

279
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,360
I just heard it was in April.

280
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,790
But when this kid was around ten,

281
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,810
he ran away

282
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,170
from his foster family.

283
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,840
I heard someone saw him in your city.

284
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,630
What's his name?

285
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,150
I don't know that.

286
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,330
His foster family's surname is...

287
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,030
Shi.

288
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,990
You really won't eat?

289
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,740
I said no, so no.

290
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,120
You eat, I'll just enjoy the smell.

291
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,070
How are things going with that girl now?

292
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,510
What girl?

293
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,840
Don't play dumb with me.

294
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,000
Get a move on.

295
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,200
She's a cop too,

296
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,260
so she'll understand your overtime.

297
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,500
When it comes to these things,

298
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,360
you should settle down sooner

299
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,840
and get things done fast.

300
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:30,120
When did you become so naggy?

301
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,440
What's the rush?

302
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,130
Eager for grandchildren?

303
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,500
Why would I be in a rush?

304
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,390
I'm not your father.

305
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:47,960
I... I mean

306
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,320
you should take swift action
on this kind of matter.

307
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,480
No delays.

308
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,000
You're not getting any younger.

309
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,410
Do you remember

310
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Ao Xiaojie?

311
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,520
Ao Xiaojie? Yes, I remember him.

312
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,790
What about him?

313
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,200
Nothing.

314
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,839
Just ran into him again on a recent case.

315
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,090
Stop following me.

316
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,480
Go back to your police academy.

317
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,210
That victim was quite pitiful.

318
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,350
She looked a bit like Shen Xiaozhou.

319
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,400
You've met quite a few girls like that?

320
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,800
If you keep following me,

321
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,920
I'll jump off!

322
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,220
Don't you understand?

323
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,550
I don't like you!

324
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,440
There's a course in school

325
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,200
called Victimology.

326
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,590
That female victim

327
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,550
had a child.

328
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,880
People who lack responsibility

329
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,740
and run away from problems are even
less suited to be police officers.

330
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:19,720
What do you mean?

331
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,550
Frivolous,

332
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:22,830
flippant,

333
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,600
lacking self-respect.

334
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:25,590
Have you always

335
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,320
looked down on girls like that?

336
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,240
Can't you show some humanity?

337
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,490
Cannon over the screen.

338
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,240
Nice move.

339
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,640
Director Yue, you came at the right time.

340
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,160
Watch how I'm going to beat him.

341
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,000
Have a seat.

342
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,160
Playing chess, huh?

343
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,490
Director, you're here.

344
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,030
Thank you, Director.
Thank you, Director Yue.

345
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:00,440
Thank you, Director.

346
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,370
What about mine?

347
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,160
Thank you, Director.

348
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:07,010
I can't afford to smoke these.

349
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:12,350
Director, how are the negotiations
with Jinhai Group going?

350
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,640
When will they start building?

351
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,770
Is there still hope?

352
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,310
Soon.

353
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,170
I've never lived
in a sea-view apartment before.

354
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:23,350
Actually, sea-view apartments
aren't that great.

355
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,020
They're too humid,

356
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,030
especially not suitable for families
with elderly people.

357
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,270
We won't really live there ourselves.

358
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,790
Once we get them,
we'll sell them to out-of-towners.

359
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,750
You're dreaming.

360
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,960
The case hasn't been solved yet.

361
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,630
The police won't let us proceed.

362
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:46,000
Why did she have to die in our factory?

363
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,110
Hey,

364
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:53,190
do you know what a livestreamer is?

365
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,050
Livestreamer?

366
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,880
Like in the news broadcast?

367
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,960
No.

368
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,290
Look at this, everyone.

369
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,590
Such a nice-looking girl,

370
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,420
but why is she asking for tips right away?

371
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,200
Right?

372
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,350
I feel like she's just like a beggar,

373
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,610
don't you think? Look.

374
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,180
She's pretty though.

375
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:13,960
If you ask me,

376
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,910
begging would be more dignified.

377
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,830
When begging, you only need to smile,

378
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,830
but she has to swing her hips and waist
and such.

379
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,430
Swinging her hips and waist.

380
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:25,010
Swinging hips and waist.

381
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,500
Let me tell you,

382
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,970
there's a type of person

383
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,640
who likes to swing their hips and waist,

384
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,680
or play music and sing for money.

385
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,340
Obviously not decent people.

386
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,540
Don't let your wife hear that.

387
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,790
She was in our factory's troupe
when she was young.

388
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,520
So what if she was in the troupe?

389
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,880
I'm the kind of person

390
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,830
who's not afraid to name names.

391
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,270
That's right.
I was referring to Shen Huazhang.

392
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,030
Yang.

393
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:51,230
After all these years,
why are you still holding a grudge?

394
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:52,750
What do you want to compare with him?

395
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,750
Look at yourself.

396
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,640
You're practically illegal-looking.

397
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,790
Even with his head shaved,

398
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:57,590
he still crushes you.

399
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,790
Crush my ass!

400
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,960
At least I didn't have an idiot child

401
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,400
or end my family line.

402
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:03,880
That's too far.

403
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,310
You've gone too far with that.

404
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:05,920
How could you talk like that?

405
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,400
That's just how I talk.

406
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,310
Pardon me.

407
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,540
What are you doing?

408
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:11,380
Yang!

409
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,640
A broken drum doesn't fear beating.
Bring it on.

410
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,030
I...

411
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:14,680
Dad!

412
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,700
If you get arrested again,

413
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,100
you won't be getting out.

414
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:22,850
Let's go home.

415
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,550
Why is he so fired up?

416
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,150
Did he eat gunpowder or what?

417
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,550
Director Yue. Director.

418
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:30,400
Don't mind him.

419
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,440
He's always been like this.

420
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,040
Everyone knows that, right?

421
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:39,070
You shouldn't have interfered.

422
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,400
You should have let me hit him

423
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,200
with that bottle
and send him back to the hospital.

424
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:46,410
Where were you
on the night of Xiaozhou's accident?

425
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,110
You were drunk, weren't you?

426
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,150
Do you remember how you got home?

427
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:56,590
Let's go home.

428
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,940
Is this for Cherry?

429
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,590
By the time I see her,
it won't be cold anymore.

430
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,440
It's for you.

431
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,110
Kumquat Lemonade?

432
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:35,890
That's nice.

433
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,510
Don't you want some?

434
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,160
I'll pass.

435
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,440
Thanks.

436
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,110
Why don't you wear something nicer?

437
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:05,090
Isn't this decent?

438
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,300
It cost me several dozen yuan.

439
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:08,840
I'm not good at picking clothes.

440
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,540
Are you?

441
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,230
No.

442
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,070
I wonder if Sui Xiao will be upset

443
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:21,350
when she finds out I met with her.

444
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:25,440
You're underestimating Sui Xiao.

445
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,830
It's been so many years
since I've seen her.

446
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,090
I'm worried she'll...

447
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,750
This is work.

448
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:35,070
No matter what she does,
you have to go through with it.

449
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,560
Is she close with Ao Xiaojie?

450
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,160
Yes.

451
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,400
She knew him before I did.

452
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,100
Actually, when I first knew Claw,

453
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,770
he wasn't called Claw yet.

454
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,880
He's quite loyal to his friends.

455
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,740
He helped me during those years
when I was homeless.

456
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,680
Although he's not exactly

457
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,610
a model citizen,

458
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,540
I don't think
he'd get involved in a murder case.

459
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:01,720
Besides, Shen Xiaozhou
being a livestreamer

460
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,270
was a few months ago.

461
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,520
Would the Ao Xiaojie you knew

462
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,440
open a so-called cultural company?

463
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,110
Would he have a group of girls

464
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,600
sing for the police?

465
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,680
People change.

466
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,900
Even you became a cop.

467
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:27,040
He asked Huang Bin
to delete Shen Xiaozhou's photos.

468
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,750
There must be a reason.

469
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:32,150
At the very least,
he doesn't want people to know

470
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:35,480
that Shen Xiaozhou used to be
a livestreamer in his company.

471
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,330
I'll head over then.

472
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,480
I wonder if Cherry has changed.

473
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:48,660
Go ahead.

474
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,920
I'm home.

475
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,810
Dinner will be ready soon.

476
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:24,170
Mom.

477
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,570
I want to discuss something with you.

478
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,510
Can we postpone the wedding?

479
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:33,040
I want to put it off for a bit.

480
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,790
Postpone it?

481
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:43,330
Until when do you want to postpone it?

482
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,820
Until Xiaozhou's case is solved.

483
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:46,830
If you agree,

484
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,260
I'll talk to Tang Juan about it.

485
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,320
What nonsense are you talking about,

486
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,030
postponing it?

487
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,520
The wedding is in just a few days.

488
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,930
The guests have been invited,

489
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,390
and the banquet has been booked.

490
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,960
Who are you trying to embarrass?

491
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,960
Why did you have to drink so much?

492
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,020
Come on, go inside.

493
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,270
Go lie down on the bed.

494
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,930
Hey, tell me, am I right or not?

495
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,310
I'm telling you,

496
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,770
you're just spoiling him.

497
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,350
Tao.

498
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:20,200
I know you're in a difficult position.

499
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:23,440
But look, our family
has got everything prepared,

500
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,200
and the money has already been spent.

501
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,770
It can't be changed now.

502
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:43,900
Xiaozhou...

503
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:47,210
I believe she'd understand.

504
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,030
But we had invited Uncle Shen

505
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,400
to come and play the pipa at the wedding.

506
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,480
So what do we do now?

507
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:58,030
We shouldn't have invited him
in the first place!

508
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,640
His pipa playing

509
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,240
brings bad luck!

510
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:12,750
Mom.

511
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,240
We can still go through with it,

512
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:23,350
but we won't be setting off
any firecrackers that day.

513
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:26,300
Sure. No firecrackers,

514
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,960
so your Uncle Shen won't hear them.

515
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,950
We must set them off!

516
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,300
The more the better!

517
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,100
To drive away the bad luck!

518
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,220
Jump! Jump! Jump!

519
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,180
Jump! Come on!

520
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:39,380
You're here.

521
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Play by yourself.

522
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,610
Insert a coin! Come on.

523
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,530
Here it comes! Hurry up!

524
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:46,960
One push!

525
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,720
Move faster!

526
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,640
You're going to ruin it!

527
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,420
That's not how you play it!

528
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:04,790
Shi Qiangfeng!

529
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,350
Who plays like that?

530
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,720
Let's go another round.

531
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,510
Again?

532
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,880
Game's starting, alright?

533
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,540
The front ones!

534
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,260
Those two in front!

535
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:22,240
The back.

536
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:23,810
Step on those two keys.

537
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,130
I think I've got it.

538
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,090
Good, that's it.

539
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:35,420
Cherry.

540
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:36,810
W-We're in public.

541
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,740
Don't call me Cherry.

542
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,030
You used to complain that

543
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,070
I was too tomboyish.

544
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,670
Am I not feminine enough now?

545
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,900
V-Very feminine.

546
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,770
Have you even forgotten my name?

547
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:52,620
Xu Ying.

548
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,260
How could I forget?

549
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:13,130
This is the camera
opposite Baoyang Building.

550
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,410
Get the surveillance footage

551
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,850
from the evening of June 19th.

552
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:18,910
Baoyang Building?

553
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:21,400
You and Zhao Hougang
are going for the same thing.

554
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,200
He also requested this footage.

555
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,350
Haiping, come on.

556
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,010
Have a seat.

557
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:33,440
Chief Qiu is right.

558
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:36,310
Your two teams' investigations
have overlapped.

559
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,000
Zhao,

560
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:38,960
give us the details.

561
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,700
Alright, I'll start from the beginning.

562
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,010
Through our investigation, we found that

563
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:48,070
before Wang Yishan

564
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:49,960
and Jia Beibei

565
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,830
were killed,

566
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:55,490
they both borrowed high-interest loans
from Shark, Sha Hongli.

567
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:58,430
This Sha Hongli has now disappeared,

568
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,440
and all evidence suggests

569
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,410
he's likely been silenced.

570
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:05,550
Going back to Wang Yishan and Jia Beibei,

571
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:06,550
our investigation revealed that

572
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,240
the purpose of their loans

573
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:11,270
was for plastic surgery
to become livestreamers.

574
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,920
The dentist who consulted with Jia Beibei

575
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,640
about her dental cosmetic work

576
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,750
told me personally

577
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,720
that Jia Beibei's purpose
for fixing her teeth

578
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,720
was specifically to become
an online livestreamer.

579
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,440
After that, we further investigated

580
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,200
Wang Yishan's social connections,

581
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,440
and now we can confirm

582
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:28,070
that Wang Yishan's purpose
for cosmetic surgery

583
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:29,680
was also to become a livestreamer.

584
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,070
So we conducted a search

585
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,590
of all related businesses in the city

586
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:36,550
and found that a company called
Da'ao Cultural Communication Company

587
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:37,640
is the most suspicious.

588
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,000
Its actual controller

589
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,000
is Ao Xiaojie.

590
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:43,680
Its address is right in Baoyang Building,

591
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,940
and strangely enough,

592
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:48,030
the Meiyixing Clinic
that did Wang Yishan's plastic surgery

593
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:49,510
is also in Baoyang Building.

594
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,270
Moreover, also in Baoyang Building,

595
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:53,070
there's a Da'ao karaoke studio,

596
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,880
which also belongs to Ao Xiaojie.

597
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,340
Jia Beibei and Wang Yishan

598
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,480
were regular customers
at this karaoke studio.

599
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,400
This Meiyixing isn't just
some ordinary clinic.

600
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,960
It has close ties with this Da'ao Company.

601
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,930
Based on this, we can deduce

602
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,730
that from loan sharking

603
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,530
to plastic surgery,

604
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:10,830
and then to online livestreaming,

605
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,560
it has formed a complete cycle.

606
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:16,230
Every livestreamer at Da'ao Company

607
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:18,920
was personally selected by Ao Xiaojie,

608
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:21,750
likely right at the karaoke studio.

609
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:25,200
So our team's next investigation target

610
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,030
is the owner of Da'ao Company,

611
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:30,200
Ao Xiaojie.

612
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:32,110
Good.

613
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,490
That was very clear.

614
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,130
This chain of logic holds up so far.

615
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:43,040
So you suspect that Ao Xiaojie used
becoming a livestreamer

616
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:45,610
as a pretext to lure them,

617
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,440
and then murdered them?

618
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,000
Yes.

619
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,790
We've already placed Ao Xiaojie

620
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,790
under 24-hour surveillance

621
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,740
to continue gathering evidence.

622
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,000
Lian Haiping.

623
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,960
How did the Shen Xiaozhou case

624
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:01,780
lead to the Baoyang Building?

625
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:04,750
Shen Xiaozhou also worked at
Ao Xiaojie's company

626
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:05,810
as a livestreamer.

627
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,050
She did it twice a few months ago,

628
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,320
but then quit.

629
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,720
But I've always

630
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,880
felt something

631
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,160
doesn't add up.

632
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:22,720
Shen Xiaozhou's connection with Ao Xiaojie

633
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,000
was from several months ago,

634
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,440
and

635
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,460
the dates when
Shen Xiaozhou and Jia Beibei were killed

636
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,310
are too close.

637
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,920
Therefore,

638
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:40,110
although our current
investigation directions

639
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,790
have overlapped,

640
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,510
I can't help feeling

641
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,690
it's raised even more questions.

642
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,160
Regardless,

643
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,960
keep this Ao Xiaojie under close watch

644
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,120
and investigate him thoroughly first.

645
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:53,720
By the way,

646
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,550
we've already met with Ao Xiaojie.

647
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:57,880
Sorry.

648
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:00,540
I didn't know you also tracked him down.

649
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:03,610
Lian Haiping.

650
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:06,170
What's your impression of that person?

651
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:12,810
Shrewd

652
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:16,590
and good at disguising himself.

653
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:19,910
He must be related to
the Shen Xiaozhou case.

654
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:25,070
Shi Qiangfeng has already been
investigating him further

655
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,470
through a livestreamer.

656
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:27,400
Shi Qiangfeng?

657
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:29,680
Why send him?

658
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,240
Shi Qiangfeng and Ao Xiaojie
have known each other for many years.

659
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,040
He won't act on impulse, will he?

660
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,490
I'd like to think he won't.

661
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,920
What would you like to eat? My treat.

662
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,550
I want...

663
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:53,280
Some drinks.

664
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,790
Don't you have work tonight?

665
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:58,120
Sure I do,
but does that mean I can't drink?

666
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,500
A few drinks actually helps me
perform better for them.

667
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,530
Then... Shall we go to a bar?

668
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,920
Bar drinks are all watered down.

669
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,540
Let's go to my place.

670
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,270
My drinks aren't watered down.

671
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,880
What's wrong?

672
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,300
Afraid I'll eat you alive?

673
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:16,429
Let's go.

674
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,850
Make yourself at home.

675
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:25,790
Is this place rented or owned?

676
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:26,620
I bought it.

677
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:29,969
Being a streamer pays this well?

678
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,940
I'm one of the inner circle, okay?

679
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,380
I've been with him for years.

680
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:36,040
Those newcomers
are still sharing apartments.

681
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,760
Going this hard right away?

682
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,960
Can we start with beer?

683
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,949
Would you please sit down?

684
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,360
I'll look around.

685
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:01,110
Sit down.

686
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,460
Do you have a girlfriend?

687
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:19,420
No.

688
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,130
Did you see me last night?

689
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,240
Yes.

690
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:29,970
You didn't even look at me.

691
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:30,840
I did see you,

692
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:33,270
from the corner of my eye.

693
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:36,560
How did you get my phone number?

694
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:38,100
I'm a cop, it's easy.

695
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,100
Stop drinking.

696
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,700
Don't you still have to work?

697
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,400
I'm not going. They won't miss me.

698
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,480
Not working for one night,

699
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,740
how much will you lose?

700
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,960
As a streamer,
what's your daily commission?

701
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:54,590
Do the newcomers get the same as you?

702
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:56,970
No, they don't.

703
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:00,370
But you're all doing the same job.

704
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:02,360
Doesn't that create conflicts?

705
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,830
Let's not talk about this anymore.

706
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,660
You came to see me.

707
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,840
It's not to reminisce about old times,
is it?

708
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,410
Just chatting, that's all.

709
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,070
Liar.

710
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:24,990
You do have a girlfriend.

711
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:31,030
You hesitated for a second.

712
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,980
Anyone that makes you hesitate

713
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:37,240
must be someone you truly care about.

714
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,970
Don't think I know nothing.

715
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:42,440
You used to treat me like a buddy.

716
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,850
How could I not know

717
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,280
your type?

718
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,320
You came to see me

719
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,290
to ask me something, right?

720
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,360
You know what?

721
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,590
When I was lying on the operating table

722
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,320
at the plastic surgery clinic,

723
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:09,550
the first person I thought of was you.

724
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,440
I wanted you to see how I look now.

725
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,410
Actually, I don't care about that.

726
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,280
I also asked around about you later,

727
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,960
and found out that
you went to the police academy

728
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,960
and became a cop.

729
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,880
I knew then

730
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:34,690
our paths were growing further apart

731
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,170
and would never converge.

732
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:37,830
That's not true.

733
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:46,300
I never wanted to be a livestreamer,

734
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,290
sweet-talking those fans into
giving me tips every day.

735
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:54,930
Am I even myself anymore?

736
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,360
But you know what?

737
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,250
There was this fool

738
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,700
who spent 30,000 yuan

739
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,570
just to have dinner with me.

740
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:14,780
And he's not the only one.

741
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:19,470
Scamming those guys for money
is one thing.

742
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:23,070
Last year, a kid in his teens

743
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,960
tipped me over 200,000 yuan

744
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:29,710
meant for
his grandmother's medical treatment.

745
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,680
His parents went to
the police station afterward.

746
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:37,480
I don't know how much they got back.

747
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,940
So later when streaming,
I stopped talking completely

748
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,850
and just danced.

749
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:49,370
I wouldn't say a single word.

750
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,810
Thank you, Big Brother.

751
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:56,650
Can you gift me, your little sister,
a villa?

752
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:02,010
How is that any different from begging?

753
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:10,670
So

754
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:14,120
I've been going downhill.

755
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:18,050
Ao Xiaojie always tells me

756
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:19,190
that

757
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,480
we're earning our money
through hard work too.

758
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:25,800
You know what?

759
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,100
My parents sell vegetables for a living.

760
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:34,230
Compared to them,

761
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:37,960
what right do I have

762
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,620
to say I work hard for my money?

763
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,300
If you don't want to do it anymore,
then quit.

764
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:55,080
But what else can I do?

765
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:59,190
I don't know how to do anything else.

766
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:09,190
Should I apply to the police academy too?

767
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:33,150
I know Ao Xiaojie

768
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:35,010
treats those girls pretty badly.

769
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:39,770
Sometimes I also feel sorry for them.

770
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,460
How does he treat them badly?

771
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:50,670
But Ao Xiaojie has never wronged me.

772
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,860
I can't say anything against him.

773
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:56,560
You can ask a girl named Xiaonan.

774
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,690
She's just been injured

775
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:01,190
and can't leave even if she wants to.

776
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,270
What you can find out

777
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:05,870
depends on yourselves.

778
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,380
You should go now.

779
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,840
I want to sleep.

780
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:25,350
Are you okay?

781
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,630
I'm fine.

782
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,600
Don't worry about me.

783
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:34,730
I'm actually quite happy today.

784
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:10,010
On the afternoon of June 19th,

785
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:11,550
Ao Xiaojie's car

786
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:13,630
left Baoyang Building at 5:30.

787
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:16,350
Looks like he wasn't alone.

788
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,540
Right, there were two of them.

789
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:20,640
There was another well-built guy.

790
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,930
They were together the whole time.

791
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:25,880
On the day Jia Beibei was killed,

792
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:27,750
Ao Xiaojie's car

793
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,080
also left the company before 6 o'clock.

794
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:33,720
As for Wang Yishan's case,

795
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,320
it happened too long ago.

796
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:39,290
Our surveillance footage
doesn't go back that far.

797
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:41,030
So basically,

798
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:44,510
when Shen Xiaozhou
and Jia Beibei were killed,

799
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:45,920
he wasn't at the company either time.

800
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:46,850
That's correct.

801
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,320
But that doesn't really prove anything.

802
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:51,150
I checked the surveillance footage

803
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:53,480
of this camera from the past three months.

804
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:56,230
Every week, for one or two days,

805
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:58,230
or sometimes two to three days,

806
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:00,840
he would leave early with this big guy.

807
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,700
That's not exactly strong evidence either,
right?

808
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:09,470
About that girl I met yesterday,

809
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:11,400
although it was for case investigation,

810
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,460
there's something I need to tell you.

811
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,800
She used to have feelings for me.

812
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,000
Actually,

813
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,100
she still has feelings for me.

814
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,630
So, do you like her?

815
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,390
I already have someone in my heart.

816
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:31,190
There's no room for anyone else.

817
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,500
Then why are you reporting this to me?

818
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,490
Did something happen
between you two yesterday?

819
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:44,070
Well...

820
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:47,560
There was some skin contact

821
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:50,280
on exposed areas a few times.

822
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:51,840
I couldn't avoid it,

823
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:55,170
so I'm wondering if I deserve punishment.

824
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:57,980
Am I really that petty?

825
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:02,360
You're the most generous person ever.

826
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:06,070
It's just...
I still have to meet another girl.

827
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:08,090
Captain Lian has told me about it.

828
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:10,210
Her name is Zhou Xiaonan, right?

829
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:12,480
I'll go with you.

830
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:13,930
You're coming with me?

831
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:15,940
You don't trust me?

832
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:18,960
It's not that. It's because she's a girl,

833
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,710
and there might be things
she's not comfortable saying to a guy.

834
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:22,640
She might open up more if I'm there.

835
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,550
I haven't figured out
how to ask her out yet.

836
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:28,150
We can't let Ao Xiaojie know,

837
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:30,150
and we can't reveal anything
to her beforehand,

838
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:31,440
in case she gets scared
and doesn't show up.

839
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,240
Captain Lian already has a plan.

840
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,410
Thank you for supporting our work.

841
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:25,150
Today, that big spender of mine

842
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:26,880
only sent me one rocket gift.

843
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,360
How am I supposed to get through
this month?

844
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,670
Me too.

845
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:31,440
I'm exhausted.

846
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,080
My feet hurt from all the standing,

847
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,210
and we have to wear heels all the time.

848
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:37,680
Yeah, my feet are really sore.

849
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,110
So tired.

850
00:45:39,110 --> 00:45:40,510
Why are you back so early?

851
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:41,360
Yeah.

852
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:42,860
Be careful. Are you okay?

853
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:43,920
I'm dead tired.

854
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:44,630
How did it go?
