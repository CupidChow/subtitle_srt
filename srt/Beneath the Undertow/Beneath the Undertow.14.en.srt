Let the 1985

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:34,380
Talent Show of Xuri Chemical Fiber Factory
commence now!

3
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,670
The first show is a folk dance

4
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,710
performed by Ding Shulan,

5
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,030
accompanied
by Shen Huazhang's pipa tunes.

6
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,750
A round of applause, everyone!

7
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,150
Bravo!

8
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:13,789
Bravo!

9
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,160
Bravo!

10
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,560
Don't touch me, you perv!

11
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,240
Relax your shoulders.

12
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,170
Ma'am, relax.

13
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,710
Could you both smile?

14
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:46,840
Just get it over with.

15
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,280
Okay.

16
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,560
Three, two, one.

17
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,400
Ma'am, a bit closer to the gentleman.

18
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,950
Sir, give me a bigger smile. This is good.

19
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,150
Little boy, sit on your parents' lap.

20
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,550
Sit on your mother's lap.

21
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,479
Good.

22
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,920
Right, eyes on me.

23
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,350
Little boy, look at me.

24
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,040
Look forward.

25
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,760
Look here.

26
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,070
Eyes on me.

27
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,680
Give me a happy smile.

[Beneath the Undertow]

29
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,130
[Episode 14]

30
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,700
I need to ask you a question

31
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,540
that might make you feel uncomfortable.

32
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,960
But I hope
you can give me a candid answer.

33
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,000
Is Yang Tao your son?

34
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:53,490
My son?

35
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,950
Yang Tao's father is Yang Baoge.

36
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,770
How am I involved now?

37
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,450
Ding Shulan is the reason.

38
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,590
That's impossible.

39
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,000
How could Yang Tao possibly be my son?

40
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,120
Think about it.

41
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,870
Could it be true?

42
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:11,780
No way.

43
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,790
I was already a married man
when Yang Tao was born.

44
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:17,190
By then, Ding Shulan and I
had parted for...

45
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,190
Can't you recall?

46
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:22,520
How negligent of you.

47
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,130
Why this question?

48
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,160
We got

49
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,720
new information from others,

50
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,160
so we have to verify it.

51
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,220
Why did you mention Yang Baoge?

52
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,040
Is he a suspect now?

53
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,450
Are you indicating
that Yang Baoge probably...

54
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:47,500
Did he do it?

55
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,960
If he did,

56
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,120
then I'm the one
who caused Xiaozhou's death!

57
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,950
Mr. Shen,

58
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,700
this is just a simple inquiry.

59
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,480
Don't read too much into it.

60
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,000
Besides, if Yang Tao
really isn't your son,

61
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,800
all those possibilities can be ruled out,
right?

62
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,200
Come on, have some water.

63
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,120
Contact Ding Shulan.

64
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,320
Would you like to step away?

65
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,010
Hello, Ms. Ding.

66
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,560
Regarding Shen Xiaozhou's murder,

67
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,680
we're verifying some new statements.

68
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,800
There is a sensitive question
we have to ask...

69
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,360
Ms. Ding,

70
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:48,440
is Yang Tao

71
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:51,340
Shen Huazhang's son?

72
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,950
How could you ask me that?

73
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:57,870
I'm sorry,

74
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,940
but you have to tell the truth.

75
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,020
He isn't.

76
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:05,580
He isn't?

77
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,480
He isn't.

78
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,570
Run a test if you don't believe me.

79
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:13,990
Does Yang Baoge have a hot temper?

80
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:18,510
Has he directed any violent acts at you?

81
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,070
What?

82
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:23,390
We're asking if he has abused you.

83
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,320
Never.

84
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,870
He wouldn't lay a hand on his wife.

85
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,640
But he does beat his son.

86
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,850
Yang Tao gets beaten quite often, right?

87
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:35,690
Wait...

88
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,070
Why do you have to ask this?

89
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,810
Who are you suspecting?

90
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,960
Ms. Ding, this is just a usual inquiry.

91
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,440
Don't overthink it.

92
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,840
During investigations,

93
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,040
we have to look into everything relevant,
or even irrelevant.

94
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,370
Keep this conversation

95
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,270
secret from Yang Baoge and Yang Tao,

96
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,270
will you?

97
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,330
We're being followed.

98
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,430
Who's that?

99
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,440
Why are you following us?

100
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:52,760
Are you investigating my father?

101
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,020
Yes.

102
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,560
Are you suspecting
my father killed Xiaozhou?

103
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,430
Is there any information you can provide?

104
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:05,480
No.

105
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,040
On the night of Shen Xiaozhou's death,

106
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,650
what was Yang Baoge doing?

107
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,750
He got drunk.

108
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:17,670
He was at home.

109
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,790
He takes a girl out every day.

110
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,240
It's like he can't live a day without sex.

111
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,030
He's not going home?

112
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,270
Where is he taking the girl to?

113
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,280
Keep up with them.

114
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:17,830
How long has it been
since you last came here?

115
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,090
You're so good at this.

116
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,390
Why not tutor me?

117
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,320
You'd like a try?

118
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,440
Sure.

119
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,040
Come here.

120
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,730
Swing!

121
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,710
You're amazing.

122
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,400
Got a new stunt today.

123
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:46,150
This should be Jinhai Group's property.

124
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,860
It's not officially open yet.

125
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:49,820
How convenient.

126
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,740
No one else is around.

127
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,840
I'll go check it out.

128
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,550
Stop. I'm ticklish.

129
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:21,550
You're so naughty.

130
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,600
Scream.

131
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,440
Help!

132
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:34,470
Help!

133
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,120
It hurts!

134
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:37,290
Louder!

135
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:39,050
Help!

136
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,750
Officer Shi?

137
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,640
Are you staying in the next room?

138
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,450
Did we disturb you?

139
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,130
Was he assaulting you?

140
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,400
Who are you?

141
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:57,350
Who is he?
You didn't say there was a second patron!

142
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:57,940
Shut up.

143
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,080
My apologies, Officer Shi!

144
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:25,070
Stop messing around for a while.

145
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:28,840
We were able to spot them
and inform you in time tonight,

146
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,100
but fortune might not favor us next time.

147
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,280
Please go meet your father.

148
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,620
He wants a word with you.

149
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,200
I'm not going.

150
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,720
I have nothing to say to him.

151
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,870
He says

152
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,430
he'd like you to go abroad for a vacation.

153
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:46,950
You can shoot guns or go hunting.

154
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,080
Freedom awaits you.

155
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,090
You can also visit your mother.

156
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:09,430
Are you insane?

157
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,470
Having many ideas now, aren't you?

158
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,060
Why are you staring at me?

159
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,800
Go and tell my old man

160
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,510
to stop meddling with my life.

161
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,460
If he dares to poke his nose
into my business again,

162
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,360
I'll make his life hell.

163
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,000
Do you understand?

164
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,830
Go tell him that.

165
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,140
-Is Yang Tao...
-He's not.

166
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:09,400
He's not.

167
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,640
But the time you got pregnant...

168
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:13,960
He's not.

169
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,430
You're back.

170
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,270
Xiaohai.

171
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,620
I'm leaving now.

172
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:49,690
Why did you come back?

173
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:56,040
To wait for Xiaozhou.

174
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,570
To wait for Xiaozhou.

175
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,070
To wait for Xiaozhou.

176
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:15,300
I've been thinking a lot in recent days.

177
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,910
Would you hear my thoughts?

178
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,760
There's nothing going on
between me and Ding Shulan.

179
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,310
Please don't take it wrong.

180
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,220
Why did you

181
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,360
marry me in the first place?

182
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,240
Was it out of pity?

183
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,320
No.

184
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,200
You're great.

185
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,840
The problem lies in me.

186
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:48,670
When Xiaohai was born with that condition,

187
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,610
I felt like I had failed you.

188
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:56,180
Then, Xiaozhou came along.

189
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,130
She was so pretty.

190
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,160
Sensible and academically outstanding.

191
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,230
Everyone paid compliments to her.

192
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,190
When I stood next to her,

193
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:15,960
strangers wouldn't

194
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:20,170
assume we were mother and daughter.

195
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,000
She looked like you.

196
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,170
She was close with you.

197
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:30,440
You two seemed like a real family,

198
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:34,030
while I was just an outsider.

199
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,750
You're never an outsider.

200
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,100
Don't sit there.

201
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,920
Later on, I realized

202
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,260
she would gladly confide in me

203
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,740
when she went through rough patches.

204
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,100
I wasn't able to offer any advice,

205
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:05,060
so I could only tell her
to make her own decisions.

206
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:06,880
She said it was fine,

207
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:11,210
and that she just needed to talk to me.

208
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:13,640
Mom, what are you making?

209
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,180
Scrambled eggs with tomatoes.

210
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,630
Stir fried eggplants,

211
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,230
with green peppers.

212
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,050
Your hair just got messy.

213
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,930
Let me tie it up. Hold still.

214
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:31,560
There you go.

215
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,880
Let me help you wash these eggplants.

216
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:36,570
Does this need washing too?

217
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:37,430
No, it doesn't.

218
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,240
Do you remember?

219
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,640
When Xiaozhou was little—

220
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:54,310
shortly after she went to grade school—

221
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:57,070
we once took some family portraits.

222
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:02,010
You wanted to take a photo alone
with Xiaozhou,

223
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,030
but she kept

224
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,490
declining.

225
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:14,020
The four of us had to
appear together in every photo.

226
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,110
Sometimes I wonder

227
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,170
if Xiaozhou also felt sorry for me

228
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,120
and Xiaohai.

229
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,100
Everything she ever did

230
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,340
was in the purpose of

231
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,090
binding us together.

232
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,790
Now that Xiaozhou is gone,

233
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,090
our family

234
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,110
has fallen apart.

235
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:04,750
Qiuhong...

236
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:10,400
I did a lot of thinking
in the past few days.

237
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,370
It's my fault for being insatiable.

238
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,200
In this world,

239
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,480
no one has ever given me

240
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:21,760
more than you have.

241
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,140
But I've barely given you
anything in return.

242
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,050
I'm an inadequate husband.

243
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:34,440
Never have I made a real effort.

244
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,510
You've been solely
raising the family the entire time,

245
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,810
yet I've never shown any gratitude.

246
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,000
Only after you left did I realize

247
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:50,590
this house was backwater without you.

248
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,230
Today, with your return,

249
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:00,680
peace and hope were
finally restored in my heart.

250
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,350
When Xiaozhou was alive,

251
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,840
some sides of her

252
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,720
seemed to have always

253
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,970
reminded me of myself.

254
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,020
She was radiant

255
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,560
like the sun,

256
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,720
dazzling my eyes.

257
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,070
Except her,

258
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:25,620
I couldn't see anyone else.

259
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,320
But now, I finally see it.

260
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,640
You're the entire reason

261
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,700
that our family exists.

262
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,720
I just regret not

263
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,890
giving you enough.

264
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:47,030
If I can

265
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,590
have a second chance,

266
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,720
I'd like to make it all up for you.

267
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,690
Xiaozhou is gone.

268
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,130
Our lives are both incomplete.

269
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:02,400
Things will never be the same as before.

270
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,480
Why not put what little is left

271
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,680
in our lives together

272
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,870
and just toil on for Xiaohai?

273
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,640
I'm not fishing for your sympathy

274
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,440
to secure a caregiver for old age.

275
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,510
No need to show pity for me.

276
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,670
If you

277
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,400
still want to leave,

278
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,320
I'll help persuade Xiaohai to go with you.

279
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,090
He heard everything.

280
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,980
Maybe he has already realized

281
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,710
that Xiaozhou won't be come back.

282
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,500
Yang Tao really isn't Shen Huazhang's son.

283
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:47,400
Rumor had it in the factory
that we were a couple.

284
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,200
But the fact is,

285
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,930
we were never really together.

286
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,000
Back then,

287
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,930
people were quite realistic.

288
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:59,510
He and I did have feelings for each other.

289
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,110
But later on, we both

290
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:03,510
figured out we weren't marriage material,

291
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,170
since we lacked the skills
to run a household.

292
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,560
In 1991,

293
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:10,240
Shen Huazhang's parents suddenly fell ill

294
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,510
in their hometown.

295
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:15,070
He no longer attended
the factory's staff dancing parties.

296
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,030
In the same year,

297
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:18,680
we heard for the first time
that factory workers

298
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,740
might not hold permanent positions.

299
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:21,340
Now, with the rapid economic development,

300
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:24,240
[Vocational Training for Laid-off Workers]

301
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,160
employers keep raising the bar

302
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,420
for technical skills.

303
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,340
Given the current job market,

304
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,920
only those who have received training

305
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,750
and mastered practical skills

306
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,930
can find a job wherever they go.

307
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:40,250
Even veteran staffers were dismissed
without mercy.

308
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,970
I was afraid of being fired.

309
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,920
I had no skills at all.

310
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,880
In the ensuing staff dancing parties,

311
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:54,120
I often partnered with
the factory director.

312
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,110
Later on,

313
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,790
we made terrible mistakes.

314
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,770
That factory director

315
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,470
was not Yue Hongbing?

316
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:08,180
No.

317
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,480
In 1991,

318
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,740
Yue Hongbing was just an ordinary cadre.

319
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:15,620
That director was arrested
for corruption at last.

320
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,310
He's still in prison now.

321
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,960
In 1991,

322
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,880
I found out I was pregnant.

323
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,170
He feared that I'd tell others,

324
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,420
so he promised I wouldn't be laid off.

325
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,920
He also introduced me to

326
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,970
Yang Baoge, the supervisor of Workshop 2.

327
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,190
Yang Baoge used to be
a workshop supervisor?

328
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:40,480
Yes.

329
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:43,590
He was dismissed
for injuring others in a fight

330
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:45,920
and transferred
to the wastewater plant.

331
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,850
He knows Yang Tao isn't his son.

332
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:53,900
He thinks Shen Huazhang is the father.

333
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,430
One time, he got drunk
and asked me about it.

334
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:00,070
I denied and swore to him.

335
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,120
I was actually telling the truth.

336
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,310
On the night June 19th,

337
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,160
when Shen Xiaozhou was murdered,

338
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:11,160
was Yang Baoge home?

339
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:14,070
He went out to drink that day,

340
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,770
and didn't come back until midnight.

341
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:18,050
On the night of Shen Xiaozhou's murder,

342
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,080
what was Yang Baoge doing?

343
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,160
He got drunk.

344
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,000
He was at home.

345
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,440
But Yang Tao said...

346
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,550
How is the relationship

347
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:32,400
between Yang Tao and Yang Baoge?

348
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:34,590
What can it be like?

349
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:37,300
Baoge always beats Tao.

350
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,310
Strangely, though,

351
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,600
this morning, Tao asked Baoge

352
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,920
to transport goods somewhere out of town.

353
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,120
That had never happened before.

354
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,070
Locate Yang Tao now.

355
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,000
Okay.

356
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:08,990
He's in Xuri Factory.

357
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,110
Is it for Sui Xiao?

358
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:20,140
Want some?

359
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,200
Why aren't there

360
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,660
boba in the boba tea?

361
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,200
That cup was for Sui Xiao.

362
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:35,250
She hates boba.

363
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,540
Then it's a cup of boba tea
without the key ingredient.

364
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:44,040
Memorized his face yet?

365
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:50,290
I heard Li Dada and his men tricked you.

366
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:55,080
He surely knows
we're keeping watch on him.

367
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,640
I think we can stop that now.

368
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,020
He came upfront to us

369
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,900
as a way to make us quit monitoring him.

370
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,590
All is out in the open now.

371
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:06,450
He won't make a move then, will he?

372
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,750
Where would Yang Tao go?

373
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,710
Somewhere related to Shen Xiaozhou.

374
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:19,790
Is he Yang Baoge's son?

375
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,670
No.

376
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,640
Does Yang Tao know that?

377
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:26,790
No, he doesn't.

378
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:32,050
That's probably for the best.

379
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,220
They did stop by,

380
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:51,810
evidently.

381
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,960
Why did you drive me here?

382
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,070
Wait!

383
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,460
What are you doing?

384
00:29:58,530 --> 00:29:59,460
What's going on?

385
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,810
It's a huge factory.

386
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,060
How do we find them?

387
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,670
Zheng, you search the residential area.

388
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,240
He and I will go to the industrial zone.

389
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:13,830
Okay.

390
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:30,090
Building 9 in the east wing.

391
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:31,110
Where is it?

392
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,500
I got lost in this large place.

393
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,550
Did you do it?

394
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,160
Did you do it?

395
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:37,700
Stop drinking. Give me an answer.

396
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,200
Tell me, did you or

397
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,310
did you not do it?

398
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,730
Did you kill Xiaozhou?

399
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:46,790
Yang Tao.

400
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,050
You stay out of this.
I'll have an answer soon.

401
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:52,370
-Leave it to me.
-Say something!

402
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:54,030
Let me take over. I'll ask him.

403
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,200
He won't tell you anything.

404
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,750
He hates cops more than anything!

405
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,510
That doesn't matter.
He'll cough it all up in the end.

406
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:03,350
Put that wrench down now.

407
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:08,890
I didn't hurt him.

408
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,160
He got drunk and tripped.

409
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,240
Behave, lad.

410
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,830
He's a cop with a gun.

411
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:18,430
Officer, shoot him.

412
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,440
I don't have a gun.

413
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:29,800
Yang Tao,

414
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,370
I know you care about Xiaozhou,

415
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,590
but do you think

416
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:37,440
Xiaozhou would approve of

417
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,760
this approach you're taking now?

418
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,440
I don't mind

419
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,510
violating the law for Xiaozhou!

420
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:49,940
Xiaozhou wouldn't want you to do that.

421
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,000
Can you walk?

422
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,640
That's my son. Don't hurt him!

423
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,350
I'll go with you!

424
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,160
I... I...

425
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,090
I...

426
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:27,920
Sit down.

427
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:29,940
Thanks.

428
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,130
Get me a hand gripper.

429
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:43,970
Why did you put him in that room?
Won't you interrogate him?

430
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,330
Have some tea. Sober up.

431
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:51,920
Thank you.

432
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:03,510
Is your left hand the dominant hand?

433
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:07,110
I'm not left-handed.

434
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,440
I just can't grip with my right hand,
since it was injured before.

435
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:19,429
Squeeze it hard with your right hand.

436
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,179
For what?

437
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:23,480
Injury assessment.

438
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:29,130
Yang Tao didn't hit me.

439
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:31,440
I just accidentally hurt myself.

440
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:33,600
Please don't give that kid a hard time.

441
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:36,300
Did you bump into a concrete post or what?

442
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,500
I don't know what you're talking about.

443
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,310
No need to beat around the bush.

444
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,630
I'll level with you.

445
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:02,840
On the night of Shen Xiaozhou's murder,

446
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,530
I got drunk

447
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,120
and completely blacked out.

448
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,690
I woke up to find myself
lying in my bathroom

449
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,070
the next day, covered with mud.

450
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:13,140
I don't even know what I did,

451
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:14,920
or if I killed anyone.

452
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:21,070
If it is your conclusion
that I killed Shen Xiaozhou,

453
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,600
I'll forfeit my life then.

454
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,860
Just act as you see fit.

455
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,880
I'll accept even the death penalty.

456
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:34,290
Finish your tea.

457
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:37,760
So your injured hand

458
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,370
couldn't hold you back
from beating your son.

459
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:51,080
Was your father's right hand
injured before?

460
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,360
Yes.

461
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,680
It was crushed by a machine.

462
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:56,730
It looks fine on the outside,

463
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,230
but several bones inside did fracture.

464
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:01,270
He can hardly grip anything.

465
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:07,320
It's easy for me to take bottles
away from him.

466
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:11,440
Taking a bottle away from a drunkard—

467
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,600
it's like snatching food
from a tiger's mouth.

468
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,620
Is this the best he can do?

469
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,360
Unless he was faking it,

470
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,480
I don't see any possibility
of him killing the girl.

471
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,140
For the bruises on Shen Xiaozhou's neck

472
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,400
to be formed, she had to be strangled

473
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,480
with both hands for a while.

474
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,940
The deeper marks were left
by the right hand.

475
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:32,260
It had be to be a stronger grip than this.

476
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:36,970
[Forensics]

477
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:55,350
Captain Lian.

478
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:59,480
I wonder if what I'm going to say

479
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,340
will be of help.

480
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,240
In fact, Xiaozhou was not
as tough as she seemed.

481
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,450
And you mean...

482
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,280
You see, in others' eyes,

483
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:11,440
she was perfect in every way

484
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,300
and she excelled in everything.

485
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,760
She achieved success
in every phase of her life

486
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,550
smoothly,

487
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,400
as if nothing could ever bother her.

488
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,320
She always put on a smile.

489
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,510
But she cried too.

490
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,670
Oddly enough,

491
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:33,720
she treated me like I was her brother
all the time.

492
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,730
She told me about her troubles,

493
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,800
as if I could help her with anything.

494
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:47,750
What exactly did she tell you?

495
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:51,630
Nothing specific really.

496
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,110
A month or two ago,
I went to her college to meet her,

497
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,320
when I happened to
go to town for an issue.

498
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,030
But she left the campus

499
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,490
for part-time jobs again,

500
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,480
giving pipa performances somewhere.

501
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:03,000
Something must've upset her that day.

502
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,030
Looking distraught, she insisted

503
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:05,490
that I bring her pipa home.

504
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,460
How did it go today?

505
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:34,710
Pretty well.

506
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,710
She cried that day,

507
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,160
for a long time.

508
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,480
Could it be possible

509
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,940
that she met someone vile?

510
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:04,720
We already figured that out some time ago.

511
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:12,350
Captain Lian,

512
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,590
the three groups we sent out
have all come back.

513
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:16,320
Among the witnesses Ao Xiaojie mentioned,

514
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,190
we only found a girl in the northeast.

515
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:21,050
At a mental rehabilitation center,
to be specific.

516
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,190
What is it?

517
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:24,920
A psychiatric hospital, in fact.

518
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,670
She seems like any other girl, though.

519
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:29,080
Where is she now?

520
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,670
We planned to bring her
to an interview room,

521
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:31,440
but she

522
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,440
couldn't stay in a windowless room,

523
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:34,790
not even for a minute.

524
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,840
Sui Xiao is with her now

525
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,170
in the reception room on the second floor.

526
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,320
Did this man take you to the party?

527
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,030
Yes. It was him, Claw.

528
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:50,580
But it wasn't really a party. He...

529
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,420
He had me meet a guy.

530
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:55,780
This guy?

531
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:02,670
Yes.

532
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,480
What did he do to you?

533
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:10,520
Don't be afraid.

534
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:11,880
Take your time.

535
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,360
No one will hurt you anymore.

536
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:16,840
He...

537
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,070
He had me strip myself

538
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,430
and stand on a table.

539
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:29,790
Then, he tied my hands with a rope.

540
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,430
Afterwards...

541
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,770
He hung me up.

542
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,010
Could you tell me more details?

543
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:42,720
My neck...

544
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:47,210
He wrapped my neck with a rope.

545
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:50,960
I gasped for air for a few times.

546
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:53,030
I almost passed out.

547
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,550
After he tied the rope,

548
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,920
I was standing on my tiptoes,

549
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,730
while he started putting high heels on me.

550
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,730
He switched several pairs,

551
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:11,670
saying the shoes were from abroad.

552
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:15,480
I had never seen those before.

553
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:17,260
Overseas purchases.

554
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:19,440
No wonder we couldn't trace the shoes.

555
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,500
He touched my feet.

556
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:25,040
H-He even used his tongue.

557
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,400
I was in agony,

558
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,260
as I could barely breathe.

559
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:34,510
I felt like I was going to die.

560
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:39,130
Then... I just blacked out.

561
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,800
What happened after you woke up?

562
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:46,070
I woke up to find myself in a car.

563
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,000
That guy said,

564
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,690
if I told anyone about it,

565
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:56,260
he'd slaughter my entire family.

566
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,650
He knew where my hometown was.

567
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,800
He also knew
the specific address of my home.

568
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,400
He gave me money,

569
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,030
and bought me a plane ticket
to my hometown.

570
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:14,480
But...

571
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,840
But I am still frightened.

572
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,340
I dare not go outside.

573
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,320
I have nightmares every night.

574
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:30,330
I don't know what I can do.

575
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,040
Will the police protect me?

576
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:42,480
Li Dada

577
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,440
is the killer
of Wang Yishan and Jia Beibei.

578
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:49,590
Do you agree with this conclusion?

579
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:51,110
He's also a suspect

580
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:52,950
of Shen Xiaozhou's murder.

581
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:54,150
Alright.

582
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,080
Next, let's decide

583
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:58,860
whether to arrest him now or not.

584
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,400
In my opinion,

585
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,160
we can certainly arrest him now.

586
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,080
But the problem is what to do after that.

587
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:10,170
We have nothing but a witness now.

588
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:13,420
At most, we can only charge him
with false imprisonment

589
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,940
and intentional assault.

590
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,720
But there isn't any direct evidence

591
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,570
to connect him

592
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:21,150
with the three victims,

593
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:22,680
is there?

594
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:25,140
Even if we raid and search

595
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:27,320
all Li Dada's real estate properties,

596
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:30,480
what are the chances of finding evidence?

597
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,980
How is Li Dada's psychological resilience?

598
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:37,350
Will a preliminary interrogation of him
lead us anywhere?

599
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:39,620
So you're saying we can't arrest him now.

600
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:42,370
Then what should be our next move?

601
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,860
Is it possible that Li Dada's father

602
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:47,120
knows what he has done?

603
00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:49,840
Before we have solid evidence,

604
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,040
let's assume his father knows nothing.

605
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:52,850
We must dig up

606
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:55,500
evidence from Li Dada himself.

607
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:59,110
However, this guy is very vigilant now.

608
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,240
He won't commit another murder.

609
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:02,840
How do we find evidence?

610
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:05,800
I doubt it.

611
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,110
Doubt what? Speak your mind.

612
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:11,480
I mean...

613
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,590
Given Li Dada's personality,

614
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:17,030
he might

615
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,930
have the guts to kill again.

616
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,440
He strikes me

617
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,350
as incredibly self-conceited.

618
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:26,500
Extremely arrogant, I'd say.

619
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:28,280
-That's right!
-That's right!

620
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:31,000
-He's pretty cocky.
-He's pretty cocky.

621
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:34,610
Look at the previous two murders.

622
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:36,910
The bodies were dumped

623
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,520
near residential areas,

624
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,580
so they were soon discovered.

625
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:43,000
He probably thinks

626
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:46,050
he can't be found anyways,

627
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:48,870
and that the police are no match for him.

628
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:51,550
That was exactly
the impression he left on me

629
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:53,560
when he was caught for a traffic offense.

630
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,160
Sorry.

631
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:56,110
I spit on the ground.

632
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:58,930
Therefore, if conditions permit,

633
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:01,960
he will definitely

634
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:03,890
commit crimes again.

635
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,000
Chief Qiu said

636
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,480
it would be a dangerous mission,

637
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,760
and that Ying didn't have
the looks for it,

638
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:11,360
so he decided to select someone
from the SWAT team.

639
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:11,840
It wasn't my fault

640
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,370
that you didn't get picked.

641
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:14,800
Can you swear

642
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,250
you have nothing to do with this decision?

643
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:18,440
The brass decided it.

644
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:19,370
What could I say?

645
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:21,450
And you didn't utter a word at all?

646
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:23,480
I...

647
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:25,150
Think twice before you answer.

648
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:26,760
You could lose my trust.

649
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:29,320
I...

650
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:34,920
You don't think I know

651
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,580
what you said to Captain Lian?

652
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:40,280
I said
your feet didn't meet the standards.

653
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,400
What's up? Anything wrong?

654
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:48,210
Shi Qiangfeng said
I didn't meet the standards.

655
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:51,990
Look.

656
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,720
Are they not good enough?

657
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:58,040
Sui Xiao, it's not about the standards.

658
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:59,830
The mission is too dangerous.

659
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:01,460
You think I'm afraid of danger?

660
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:03,390
If word gets out,
people will laugh at our division,

661
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:04,440
saying we're useless.

662
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:05,360
I think...

663
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:08,690
Sui Xiao is up for the task.

664
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,730
Her looks have much

665
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,800
in common with the two victims'.

666
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:15,020
It's settled then.

667
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:17,910
I'll talk to Chief Qiu if necessary.

668
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,960
For Li Dada to strike again,

669
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:32,160
we have to make him drop his guard first.

670
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:35,000
We'll release information

671
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,190
through nonofficial channels,

672
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:39,650
stating

673
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:42,310
that Ao Xiaojie has admitted guilty,

674
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:45,920
and that all investigations about Li Dada

675
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:47,310
have been cancelled.

676
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:48,970
Then,

677
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:53,160
we'll present him with a perfect victim.

678
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,070
Based on what we know now,

679
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,710
Li Dada is capable of obtaining

680
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:04,660
the details of his preys'

681
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:06,190
personal lives and families.

682
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:06,850
Therefore,

683
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:09,120
we need to create

684
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:12,750
a complete personal profile for Sui Xiao.

685
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:17,070
The information must be
recorded in the system,

686
00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:18,690
so it can be found out.

687
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,810
Here are the recent events in her life.

688
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:28,960
She fell out with her family
a few months ago.

689
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:32,020
Then she ran away and came to Lingchuan.

690
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,800
She's currently unemployed.

691
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:41,040
What's more important is
her trails on the internet.

692
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:43,850
Her social media, photos...

693
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:45,920
In the following few days,

694
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,920
we need to create a photo album
recording at least six months of her life.

695
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:55,310
Photos are
the most important part of social media.

696
00:47:57,290 --> 00:48:00,560
Fill the album with selfies and portraits.

697
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:02,970
Some are taken outdoors,

698
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:04,360
and some are edited

699
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:04,960
properly.

700
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:06,940
Thank you, everyone.

701
00:48:07,110 --> 00:48:08,640
we need at least 300 photos,

702
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,280
from different seasons,

703
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:11,850
in different hairstyles

704
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,230
and different outfits.

705
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:17,060
Plus, various makeup styles.

706
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:19,000
Pay attention to the lighting.

707
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
It has to be consistent
with the photos of your choice.

708
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:24,000
Make sure all is flawless.

709
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:25,260
No problem.

710
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:26,950
Many influencers' photos you see online

711
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:28,480
have actually been edited.

712
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:35,830
You'll be responsible for
the captions of the photos.

713
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:41,030
They can be your own creation
or popular posts.

714
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:47,150
Make sure she sounds materialistic,

715
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:49,710
vain,

716
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:52,030
shallow,

717
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:56,070
wishy-washy, and so on.

718
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,200
Anything that fits her persona will do.

719
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,030
This girl Li Shiya that we invented,

720
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,360
going by the name of Lisa,

721
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,070
is very gullible.

722
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:14,820
Last but not least,

723
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,850
this is strictly confidential information.

724
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:20,920
You must not
disclose a word to the public,

725
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:21,710
because

726
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:25,270
this matter concerns
Officer Sui Xiao's life and safety.

727
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:26,030
Lian,

728
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:28,420
if we were in wartime,

729
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:30,690
I'm sure you could make a perfect spy.

730
00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:34,070
Let's get down to work.

731
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:51,710
This won't work.

732
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:52,850
Why not?

733
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:53,940
This one's well written.

734
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:55,670
This can really work. Captain!

735
00:49:56,610 --> 00:49:58,210
And he said he couldn't do it.

736
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:00,140
Look how nice it is, isn't it?

737
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:07,920
Captain,

738
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:09,030
look at my piece.
