00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,110
Beijing is bathed in sunshine,

2
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,970
with blue skies and white clouds.

3
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:44,940
Beijing...

4
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,540
Partly cloudy turning clear.

5
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,160
Beijing, partly cloudy turning clear.

6
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,770
Beijing...

7
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,300
partly cloudy turning clear.

8
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:56,800
-Beijing...
-Stop it!

9
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:03,210
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

10
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,040
Shut up!

11
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,710
Shut up!

12
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,530
-Shut up! Shut up!
-Xiaohai, Xiaohai.

13
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,950
It's okay. Dad wasn't yelling at you.

14
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:13,410
Dad wasn't yelling at you!

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,460
Dad wasn't yelling at you.

16
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,280
No.

17
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,920
Alright. He wasn't yelling at you.

18
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,000
It was not about you.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,600
Not about you. Not about you.

20
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,920
What's wrong with Xiaohai?

21
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,280
Nothing. He's fine.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,530
Let's go.

23
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,220
Come inside. Come on.

24
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,050
How are you feeling?

25
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,410
My heart aches.

26
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,200
But the pain is dull, lingering.

27
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,710
Like being squeezed by pliers.

28
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,110
You can't fall apart now.

29
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,590
I had a dream.

30
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,930
I dreamed that Xiaozhou got married.

31
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,310
She had a daughter,

32
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,900
only one and a half years old.

33
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,600
The three of them came to visit our home.

34
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,370
Right here on this very bed...

35
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,690
Xiaozhou was teaching the baby
to recite poems.

36
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,240
The two poems were so long,

37
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,490
and the baby memorized them
after just two readings.

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,120
Just as smart and lovely as Xiaozhou was
as a child.

39
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,800
We were so happy,

40
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:03,080
clapping and laughing.

41
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,100
Then I woke up.

42
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:14,470
The moment I woke up,
it felt worse than death.

43
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,440
Xiaozhou will never have that day.

44
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:58,000
[Beneath the Undertow]

45
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,570
[Episode 5]

46
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,380
Chen Hui is a rather shady guy—

47
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,270
paranoid and introverted.

48
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,000
I think he's capable of murder.

49
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,240
Guo,

50
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,800
are Shen Xiaozhou's

51
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,720
blood test results in yet?

52
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,330
Any anesthetics found?

53
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,560
Yes, there were.

54
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,830
But there are many types

55
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,270
of anesthetic sedatives.

56
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,750
We'll need more tests to determine
the exact one.

57
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,630
I'll tell you a few possible ones,

58
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,870
and you can check if any match.

59
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:29,800
You must have already tested
for ether and ketamine.

60
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,600
Pentobarbital sodium,

61
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:34,960
as well as propofol, chloral hydrate,

62
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:36,070
and procaine.

63
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,090
Those are about all I can name.

64
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,330
Alright, got it.

65
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,300
Where are we going now?

66
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,070
We're going to verify

67
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,570
whether Shen Xiaozhou had
a boyfriend or not.

68
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,480
Can we trust Chen Hui's claims?

69
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,240
I think

70
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,470
he might have made that up
to cover his tracks.

71
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:01,000
Whether he's lying or not, we'll find out
after investigating.

72
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,430
Our counselors don't interfere with
students' dating lives.

73
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,800
But as far as I know,

74
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,610
she didn't have one.

75
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,870
She said she hadn't met the right one yet.

76
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,120
Why don't you go ask Yue Chunxia?

77
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:15,770
A boyfriend?

78
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,040
Yeah, did she have one?

79
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,920
I don't think so.

80
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,230
If she'd ever had one,

81
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,960
the neighbors would've known.

82
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,610
Xiaozhou didn't have a boyfriend.

83
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:41,130
I think Chen Hui was
just making things up.

84
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:45,010
You completely trust Shen Xiaozhou?

85
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,400
At least in this regard, yes.

86
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:48,720
Why?

87
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,040
I can't explain it.

88
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,390
But based on
how she appeared in the videos,

89
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,920
she seemed like a good girl.

90
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,980
You have a good impression of her?

91
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,830
Don't you?

92
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,160
Didn't you say that girls like her

93
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,680
must be upright and kind?

94
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,540
Do you think...

95
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,680
she was not as pure as she appeared?

96
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,250
Even you could be wrong?

97
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,360
I only look at facts.

98
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,580
Oh, right, there's a course at school

99
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,190
called "Victimology."

100
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,630
It teaches you how to summarize
victims' personality traits and such.

101
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:22,630
I did poorly in it,

102
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,200
but you must be good at it.

103
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,290
With your years of experience,

104
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,420
have you come across victims like her?

105
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:36,530
Shen Xiaozhou was somewhat different.

106
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,480
Although her family isn't well-off,

107
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,210
they're happy and harmonious.

108
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,830
She grew up in a healthy environment.

109
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,360
For example,

110
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,790
what particular characteristics do victims

111
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:53,090
from unhealthy upbringing environments
have?

112
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,000
Often...

113
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,800
they're constantly trying to
fill the emptiness inside.

114
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,660
How do they fill it?

115
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,160
By finding a boyfriend?

116
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,240
Then, what if the boyfriend dumps them?

117
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,760
They'd be completely devastated.

118
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,830
Could this be
what happened to Shen Xiaozhou?

119
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,800
She thought she'd found a boyfriend

120
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,070
who could help her escape
her difficult life,

121
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:21,950
but she got dumped instead.
That led to conflict,

122
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,240
and the tension escalated.

123
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,440
If that were the case,

124
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,560
I think she would have moved on.

125
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,460
Really?

126
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:30,250
Would a girl just move on that easily?

127
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,409
Those who are strong inside would.

128
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,200
Is it done?

129
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,270
Yes.

130
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,680
Then I'll pull it out.

131
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,280
Whether what Chen Hui said is
reliable or not,

132
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,030
we still need to

133
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,030
verify it from two more angles.

134
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,510
Okay, you go back first.

135
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,030
I'll walk around a bit more.

136
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,890
Let's work separately tomorrow.

137
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,030
Remember to record everything

138
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,430
and take detailed notes.

139
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:26,140
Hello?

140
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,440
Um... how's Lian doing today?

141
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,940
Same as usual, why?

142
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,450
You... well,

143
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:35,550
you should prepare yourself mentally.

144
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,510
Even though you weren't here
when that case happened,

145
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,780
they might still

146
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,520
question you as well.

147
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,630
What case?

148
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:44,910
Question me about what?

149
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,170
The gambling den case.

150
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,000
You don't know about that anonymous email?

151
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,400
We've gotten in touch with
two local students,

152
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,860
both from Chen Hui's dorm.

153
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,810
As you requested, we arranged to
meet off campus.

154
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,470
They're already 20 minutes late.

155
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,290
How much do you know about Chen Hui?

156
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,750
Not much.

157
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,550
His parents used to

158
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,080
work at the paper mill.

159
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:21,620
The paper mill? Isn't that right next to
the Xuri Factory?

160
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,410
Yes, they're both
in the old industrial zone.

161
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,000
But I heard they've already moved out.

162
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,820
Do you have their new address?

163
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:33,200
No, he doesn't like
talking about his family.

164
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,430
Officer, can we get reimbursed
for transportation costs?

165
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:48,210
No problem.

166

[Green Cycle
Environmental Protection Ltd.]

167
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:54,000
Captain Lian, do you need something?

168
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,400
I still have a few more questions.

169
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,400
Alright, let's go to my office then.

170
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:01,570
Officer Lian,

171
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:04,330
this is our company's own bottled water.

172
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,320
I guarantee it's purer than

173
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,120
any bottled water on the market.

174
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,880
Have you looked into the classmate

175
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,330
I mentioned last time?

176
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,200
I can't say anything about that yet.

177
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,000
I really shouldn't have asked either.

178
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,510
I'm here today to verify some information,

179
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:25,910
mainly about your itinerary on the 19th.

180
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,670
That's all.

181
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,320
We just need to investigate
all of Shen Xiaozhou's

182
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,180
social connections thoroughly.

183
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,460
I completely understand.

184
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,460
Please, ask away.

185
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:38,600
How did you get to Qingzhou on the 19th?

186
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,340
I drove there.

187
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,370
What car and license plate number?

188
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,030
Hold on,

189
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,560
let me write it down for you.

190
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,720
Here.

191
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,630
Your itinerary for that day.

192
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:59,930
I was with the client the entire day.

193
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,270
We had a meal together first,

194
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,000
then went out for some entertainment,

195
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,860
and didn't get back to the hotel
until late at night.

196
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,600
Here, this.

197
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,510
Please take a look.

198
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,640
He was the client that day.

199
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,090
[Li Jianhe]

200
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,120
Where did you stay that night?

201
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,000
At a hotel.

202
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,800
Which hotel?

203
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,150
I heard that Shen Xiaozhou's incident
happened in the early evening.

204
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,390
I hadn't returned to the hotel
by that time.

205
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,650
It's a routine question. Please answer.

206
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,320
Isn't that... a bit personal?

207
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,830
We can find out
if you registered anywhere,

208
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:39,320
so please save us some time.

209
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,480
The Lotus Hotel, Room 806.

210
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,670
Last question.

211
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,070
Do you have a girlfriend?

212
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,790
I'm too busy for that.

213
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,270
We actually

214
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,630
don't know Chen Hui very well.

215
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:02,030
He basically wanders around campus all day

216
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:03,790
and doesn't get along with anyone.

217
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:04,840
He never comes

218
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,550
to our dorm gatherings, right?

219
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:09,080
He's just poor.
Can't even afford bubble tea,

220
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,720
so he only drinks water.

221
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,720
To be honest,

222
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:14,440
it's kind of scary
sharing a dorm with him.

223
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,680
Who knows, one night, he might just...

224
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,390
You know what I mean, right?

225
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:19,440
Why would you say that?

226
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,720
He has violent tendencies?

227
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,920
Let me put it this way:

228
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,720
one time,

229
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,600
everyone in our dorm got diarrhea,

230
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,480
except him.

231
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,320
We joked about it at the time.

232
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,240
Chen Hui, did you do this?

233
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,680
Hurry up, my stomach hurts!

234
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:49,080
Why do you think
he'd do something like that?

235
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,540
He has a really strong ego,

236
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,030
but he's also extremely insecure,

237
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,960
afraid everyone looks down on him.

238
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,670
So, h-he is twisted inside.

239
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,320
Apart from being good at studying,

240
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,450
he's really not good at anything else.

241
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:01,030
Does he have a girlfriend?

242
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:04,840
Um... it's unlikely
that he has a girlfriend.

243
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,550
His face is covered with acne
from all that frustration.

244
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:10,360
Oh, right, Officer, Chen Hui has a habit.

245
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,720
Every few days,

246
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,600
he leaves school at 8 PM

247
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,310
and doesn't come back until midnight.

248
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:18,310
Sometimes, he doesn't return
until the next morning.

249
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,080
So, we suspect he's been...

250
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,330
We've gotten in touch with the client
in Qingzhou

251
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:36,240
who met with Hu Xiangze.

252
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,150
He roughly confirms what Hu Xiangze said.

253
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,750
They were eating, singing karaoke,

254
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,810
and drinking until around midnight.

255
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,120
What exact time?

256
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,570
He said he had drunk too much

257
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:45,380
and couldn't remember clearly.

258
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,870
He said it was already past midnight
when he got home.

259
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,870
However, Hu Xiangze,

260
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,630
there's actually something off about him.

261
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:55,230
I found a civil dispute case
from two years ago.

262
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,270
Hu Xiangze

263
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,320
was entangled with
one of his married female subordinates.

264
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,380
Later, her husband found out about it

265
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,310
and smashed up Hu Xiangze's car.

266
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,120
Anyway, after all the back and forth,

267
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,120
Hu Xiangze insisted

268
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:09,270
that he didn't know she was married.

269
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,120
In the end, he didn't pursue any charges
against the husband.

270
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,550
If you ask me,

271
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,480
how could you not know

272
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,040
whether your female subordinate

273
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,830
is married?

274
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,280
Hu Xiangze?
He doesn't look like that type.

275
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,260
He looks like a decent guy.

276
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,320
Now you're talking like a child.

277
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,720
Adults, you know,

278
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,250
are all very complicated.

279
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:34,710
I always feel
that Hu Xiangze is hiding something.

280
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,390
Isn't that all there is to it?

281
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,050
Doesn't seem like a real lead.

282
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,390
You should trust Captain Lian's intuition.

283
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,520
It's not intuition.

284
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,240
When you've seen enough people,

285
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,370
you can summarize some common traits.

286
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:46,870
Look what I found.

287
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,910
There's something about Chen Hui.

288
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,480
We've found all the surveillance footage

289
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,540
of Hu Xiangze's car
at the highway entrances and exits.

290
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,360
He left on the morning of the 19th

291
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,390
and returned on the morning of the 20th,

292
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,050
which matches his statement.

293
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,240
Then let's look at what I found.

294
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,670
Please project it
onto the big screen, thanks.

295
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,360
Don't rush.

296
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,990
Let's look at them one at a time.

297
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:20,790
What about the surveillance footage
from the Lotus Hotel?

298
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,670
Just sent it over.

299
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,390
Can you let me take a break?

300
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,200
I'll look into it.

301
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:48,770
That's him, no doubt.

302
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,400
That doesn't look like Shen Xiaozhou.

303
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,370
That wasn't her.

304
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,000
Following so closely,

305
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,480
don't tell me
it's another female subordinate of his.

306
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,490
This is indeed serious.

307
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,849
Captain Lian's intuition is spot-on.

308
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,470
Well, when there's suspicion,

309
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,839
we need to clear it up

310
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,109
to put our minds at ease,

311
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:15,369
don't you understand?

312
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,599
Is Lian Haiping here?

313
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,460
Please wait a moment.

314
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,640
Come with me for a moment.

315
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,930
Before meeting them,

316
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,240
I... have to ask you something.

317
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:57,940
Okay.

318
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:02,270
That blue-haired guy
from the night before last, Bachuan—

319
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,790
do you know what he does?

320
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,830
A delivery guy.

321
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,110
He was a bouncer

322
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:11,710
at an illegal gambling den
we'd busted before.

323
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,720
Did he tell you anything?

324
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,000
W-What do you mean?

325
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:23,480
We're all cops here, so I'll be blunt.

326
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,590
I feel like you've always had something
against me.

327
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:31,240
You think Bachuan told me about the money

328
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,400
and that I sent the anonymous email
reporting you?

329
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:38,350
I... never... said it was you.

330
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:39,960
Even if I wanted to report you,

331
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,660
I wouldn't do it anonymously.

332
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,970
Alright, those are all the questions
we have.

333
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:54,160
We'll verify everything again
when we get back.

334
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,480
We won't let a good officer be framed.

335
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,510
Do you have any thoughts

336
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,240
on who might have sent
the anonymous email?

337
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,240
If it's a false accusation,

338
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,370
we need to investigate the sender too.

339
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:06,470
No.

340
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,030
Your station is currently considering

341
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:11,750
candidates to replace Mr. Feng Zhongshan
as commander, right?

342
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,680
Could it be...

343
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,400
Is there any conflict between you

344
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:17,750
and the other candidate, Zhao Hougang?

345
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,920
Is the questioning finished?

346
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,650
How did it go?

347
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,430
Nothing serious. Let's continue.

348
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,640
Look at the video Shi Qiangfeng recorded.

349
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:50,010
Do you notice anything wrong?

350
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:53,140
This was the time period
when Shen Xiaozhou was murdered,

351
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,800
and Chen Hui wasn't at school.

352
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:02,830
Where is he?

353
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,090
Who sent that email?

354
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,070
We can't trace it.

355
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,160
Must be Yu Dayou's gang of cronies,

356
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,820
trying to get revenge for him.

357
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:17,550
His gambling den has been busted.

358
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,080
That's a significant loss.

359
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:21,360
So, they fabricated dirt to frame you

360
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,690
and dragged you into it.

361
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,640
They really stir up trouble.

362
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:26,910
I want to apply for a transfer.

363
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:27,910
Sit down first.

364
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,180
If there's a misunderstanding,
it should be cleared up.

365
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,720
Good people fight,
while bad people celebrate?

366
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,520
That won't do.

367
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:33,160
Sit.

368
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,240
Haiping?

369
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,110
Haiping?

370
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:45,840
I'm sorry.

371
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,880
I shouldn't have said that.

372
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,510
I've been a cop for so many years

373
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,920
and have never faced such slander before.

374
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,790
My head's been a mess.

375
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,830
So, I transferred that slander onto you.

376
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,510
I should have known better.

377
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,830
I've always believed
that you're an honest person.

378
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:13,430
Sorry.

379
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,680
I'm not good at saying this stuff.

380
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,160
Just say what matters.

381
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:22,040
Well, we're cops. We're men.

382
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,160
We're not even afraid of sacrifice,

383
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,830
so what's a little grievance like this?

384
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,090
Let the wind carry it away,

385
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:28,490
but our brotherhood remains unbreakable.

386
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,400
Now that it's out in the open,

387
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,260
say something.

388
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,120
I'm sorry.

389
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,910
Don't transfer.

390
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,110
Let's solve the case together.

391
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,200
Okay?

392
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,300
Shi Qiangfeng,

393
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:49,680
do you know how hard it is

394
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,970
for Lian Haiping to say things like that?

395
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,790
You're young, a tough guy,

396
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,680
and you can't even get over this?

397
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,350
Alright.

398
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:07,200
Let's just pretend
that today never happened, alright?

399
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,480
You made up?

400
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,090
Time will tell

401
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,400
what kind of guy Lian really is.

402
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,130
You'll see for yourself later.

403
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,670
You guys are so stingy!

404
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,240
Even hid the tea leaves.

405
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:41,950
The results are in?

406
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:43,690
Yeah, we found propofol.

407
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,190
Shen Xiaozhou's blood had it,

408
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:46,110
not in high concentration,

409
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:48,830
but there was quite a bit
in her stomach contents.

410
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:49,740
She drank it?

411
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:53,030
This stuff is tasteless.

412
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,510
If you mix it with tea, coffee, or juice,

413
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,270
then it's even harder to detect.

414
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,160
In the list you gave me last time,

415
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,400
you mentioned propofol.

416
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,830
And that suspect of yours

417
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,110
has it in his lab.

418
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:05,310
D-D-Don't get too excited.

419
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,720
Don't be so excited just yet.

420
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,830
Propofol

421
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,820
is very common.

422
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,350
It's easy to get nowadays.

423
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:13,080
Some people even use it
like a drug, injecting it.

424
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,580
Let's keep a close watch on Chen Hui.

425
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:20,150
The college campus is
a unique environment.

426
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,160
We don't have many young people
on our team.

427
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,290
Should we borrow a few from elsewhere?

428
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:27,720
What about S-Sui Xiao?

429
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,320
Does s-she look like a college student?

430
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,030
No need. I can go three days
without sleep.

431
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:34,590
I can do it too.

432
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,970
[Southern University
of Science and Technology]

433
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:24,720
Dinner's here.

434
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,000
He's coming out.

435
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,160
You eat. I'll go.

436
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:33,680
No need.

437
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,240
I'm all ready.

438
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:39,670
You know, you really look like
an engineering student dressed like that.

439
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:40,500
Just a bit old.

440
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,680
What?

441
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,060
I can totally pass for a freshman.

442
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,060
Please. I've got it all figured out.

443
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:50,850
My identity will be...

444
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:55,050
a mechanical engineering PhD student.

445
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:56,910
I've already borrowed the book.

446
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,570
For borrowing this book, I...

447
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:09,960
Hello.

448
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,170
How's it going?

449
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,570
He's entered the dorm.

450
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,290
You've been watching for two days.

451
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:15,490
Let Qi take over.

452
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,800
No need. I'll keep watching.

453
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:42,330
Who are you?

454
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:45,680
What are you doing?

455
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,110
Are you even from this school?

456
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,640
Which department are you from?

457
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,510
Physics.

458
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,670
Yeah, right.

459
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:52,880
You could pass as a PE student, maybe.

460
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,270
You, from Physics?

461
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:56,210
And I'm Stephen Hawking. Get out!

462
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,340
Well,

463
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:59,480
didn't the security office give you
a heads-up?

464
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,400
It's me. I'm on duty.

465
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,310
Sorry, sorry.

466
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,120
Please, carry on.

467
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:05,720
I'm sorry.

468
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,160
Officer.

469
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:20,050
Has the case been solved?

470
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:21,540
Have you caught the killer?

471
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,410
Not yet.

472
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:27,160
Then... do you have any suspects?

473
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,350
Sorry, but we can't disclose
the investigation details.

474
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,680
Not even to the family?

475
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,480
There are rules.

476
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,740
Officer Lian, please tell us something.

477
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:40,550
Uncle Shen has been waiting every day
for news.

478
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:43,280
His heart is in knots,
and he's about to collapse.

479
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,480
Don't worry,

480
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,070
when the case is solved,

481
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,920
I'll notify you first thing.

482
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:52,510
Yang Tao, you're close to
their family, right?

483
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:53,830
Yes.

484
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,630
Xiaozhou grew up playing with me.

485
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:58,590
She was like my little sister.

486
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,230
Look.

487
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,730
This is a photo of Xiaozhou and me
from last month.

488
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,850
That's your car?

489
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,160
I bought a new car,

490
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:10,100
and Xiaozhou came to congratulate me.

491
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,850
She said I'd joined the car owners' club.

492
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,880
And who's this?

493
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,420
This is my girlfriend.

494
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,160
We were supposed to get married

495
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,160
in just a few days.

496
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,700
Xiaozhou even said

497
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:24,480
she would play the pipa at our wedding.

498
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,520
Let's go back.

499
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,100
Why are you just sitting in the car
instead of going home?

500
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:04,730
Mom.

501
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:08,000
I'm tired; just taking a breather.

502
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,310
Come on, let's go home.

503
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,010
What did you buy?

504
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,400
Look. Mom got this for you.

505
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:31,350
When do you actually have time?

506
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:34,240
That girl's been waiting to hear back.

507
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:37,200
Didn't you say you wanted to
date a kindergarten teacher?

508
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,350
She is one.

509
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,770
Tell him that he must finish his homework,

510
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:43,360
and I'll check it when I get back.

511
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,920
He's already finished middle school.
What homework could he have?

512
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,750
Doesn't his tutoring class give him any?

513
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:48,880
He said no homework.

514
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,680
Call the teacher to verify that.

515
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:55,180
Still need to gather evidence
from multiple sources.

516
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,510
You think this is a case?

517
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,610
Alright, got it.

518
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,750
It's the end of the month,

519
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,920
and our department's been doing
quarterly summaries.

520
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,380
So, I just got off work now.

521
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:06,200
Hello?

522
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,530
He's heading to the school gate,
the south gate.

523
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:09,960
Come over. I'm there.

524
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,000
Weirdo.

525
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,040
Hey!

526
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:27,770
Excuse me!

527
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,250
May I ask how I can get to
the Science Building?

528
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,980
Don't know, I'm a sports major.

529
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:32,840
Okay, thanks.

530
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:38,990
Did you see him?

531
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,800
He was supposed to be
in the lab at this time.

532
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:46,440
His routine has changed.

533
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:49,120
He used to just stick to
the dorm, lab, and cafeteria—

534
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,610
three fixed points, very predictable.

535
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:52,270
Look, he's wearing a hat today,

536
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:54,200
like he doesn't want to be recognized.

537
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,330
This is suspicious, very suspicious.

538
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,960
I'll get on the bus and follow him.

539
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,480
Don't.

540
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:03,280
There aren't enough people
on the bus to hide among.

541
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:48,870
What's wrong?

542
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:51,800
I think there's a car following us.

543
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,270
No way.

544
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:56,830
Who would dare to follow cops?
Asking for trouble?

545
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:00,230
Are they still following us?

546
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,560
I was mistaken.

547
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:15,790
What? He spotted us?

548
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,490
We can't keep following
Lian Haiping anymore.

549
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:19,620
He's too alert.

550
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,730
This guy... hard as nails.

551
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,670
Even reporting him for taking bribes
didn't work.

552
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:27,530
By the way, bro,

553
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,040
Bachuan and the others
have gone into hiding too.

554
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,170
They've set up that guy Shi Qiangfeng,

555
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:34,730
and now they're afraid of
getting beaten up.

556
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,560
We've got what we wanted.

557
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,640
Let's use our brains now.

558
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,930
Even the strongest person...

559
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:43,640
has weak spots.

560
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:59,400
Go check if Chen Hui is still on the bus.

561
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:02,180
I've been watching. He hasn't gotten off.

562
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:02,960
Go.

563
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:05,830
What if he sees me?

564
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:06,310
Just go.

565
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,780
He's not on the bus.

566
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,720
Where did this guy go?

567
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,050
Vanished into thin air?

568
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,640
Someone in a hat and work uniform

569
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,070
got off at the Third Textile Factory stop,

570
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,330
but I didn't see anyone

571
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:34,350
dressed like that get on the bus.

572
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,550
You actually remember

573
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:38,000
what everyone who got on was wearing?

574
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,060
I wasn't trying to.

575
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,770
Quite a few people got off
at the Third Textile Factory stop,

576
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,430
and my attention was divided.

577
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,960
That person must have been Chen Hui.

578
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,060
Why did he change his clothes?

579
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,790
Could he have noticed
that someone was tailing him?

580
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:50,880
That kid can't be that sharp, can he?

581
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,680
Get in. Let's go back
to the Third Textile Factory.

582
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:00,480
You stay here and keep watch.

583
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,790
If Chen Hui wants to go back to school,

584
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,830
he'll definitely catch the bus
from here again.

585
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:05,090
I'll go check the area.

586
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,110
Okay.

587
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:46,940
Hey, buddy.

588
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,670
May I borrow your motorcycle?

589
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,400
I'm a police officer.

590
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,590
I need it to chase a suspect.

591
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:51,360
Sure, go ahead.

592
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:51,920
Thanks.

593
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:53,480
Look at that loser.

594
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,590
A cop? Please!

595
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,260
He looks even shadier than you do.

596
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:04,150
Hello?

597
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,340
I spotted Chen Hui.

598
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:06,990
He was riding a tricycle.

599
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Are you sure it was him?

600
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,320
It was definitely him. He went toward
a residential area with bungalows,

601
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,320
but I couldn't catch up.

602
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,580
What kind of tricycle?

603
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,510
Electric, with a flatbed.

604
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,820
The kind used for collecting recyclables.

605
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,820
You go in first. I'll be right there.

606
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,400
Okay.

607
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:01,710
Not taking any more today.
Come back tomorrow.

608
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:05,150
Who told you that you could come in?

609
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:05,960
Police.

610
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,720
Has this guy been here just now?

611
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:11,060
No.

612
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,190
Officer,

613
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,150
I'm about to get off work.

614
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,560
My wife is waiting for me at home.

615
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,740
Don't you live right here?

616
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:43,960
Who are you?

617
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,960
I'm... I'm a police officer.

618
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,190
-You?
-A cop?

619
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:50,590
A cop? Please. You're just a thief!

620
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,080
I really am a police officer.

621
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,710
-Don't go!
-Don't go!

622
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:57,150
Once we blow our whistles,
you won't get out of this alley!

623
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:57,610
Blow it.

624
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,960
No, no, don't blow it!

625
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,440
-What are you doing?
-Don't move that hand!

626
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,110
Take your hand out!

627
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:02,970
I have my badge.

628
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:03,800
Badge?

629
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:08,590
You're not from around here, are you?

630
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:09,650
Where are you from?

631
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,260
Did something illegal back home, right?

632
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,480
How do you know?

633
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,430
Answer the questions honestly.

634
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:19,160
Help us out,
and you might get a reduced sentence.

635
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:20,880
Come on.

636
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,900
Take another look.

637
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:27,580
He was driving
a flatbed electric tricycle earlier.

638
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:32,550
The last one who brought in recyclables.

639
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,590
He looked like him,
but he was wearing a mask.

640
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:37,390
So I can't say for sure it was him.

641
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,540
What did he bring here?

642
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:44,150
He comes by every few days.

643
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,360
Always brings bulky items.

644
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:47,920
Has he brought in

645
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:49,760
a laptop recently?

646
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,070
Has he ever brought in women's clothing?

647
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,190
It really is him.

648
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,550
I'm sorry.

649
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:01,800
My apologies, Officer.

650
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,280
I really couldn't tell!

651
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:03,590
Yes.

652
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:05,920
I know all the beat cops around here,

653
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,760
but you... you're a new face.

654
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,190
We've never seen you before.

655
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,480
I'm from the criminal investigation unit.

656
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,110
Criminal investigation unit?

657
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:12,970
What case are you investigating?

658
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,150
Do you need our help?

659
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,510
Yes, just give the order,

660
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,030
and we'll...

661
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:17,760
No, no, don't blow the whistle!

662
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,830
I'm just looking for a tricycle.

663
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,710
Needs to be done quietly.

664
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:22,320
A tricycle? What kind?

665
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:24,630
I know who has what tricycle in this area.

666
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:25,190
Right.

667
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,090
We know which family owns what.

668
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:37,450
These. They're all the clothes
I've collected.

669
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:40,420
I don't know who brought them in.

670
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,710
I know that nowadays, you can track people

671
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:46,510
through the NBA or whatever.

672
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:48,760
My NBA is all over these things.

673
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,250
I haven't done anything terrible.

674
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,920
Officer,

675
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,710
you have to believe me.

676
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:59,000
Back home, I only stole some cables.

677
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:00,850
I've been on the run for years.

678
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,760
I live in fear every day.

679
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:05,910
Now that you've found me,

680
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,920
I actually feel relieved.

681
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:12,280
You said he comes by every few days.

682
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:14,910
Is it always at this time in the evening?

683
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,840
Dad, what's this?

684
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,550
This is a pipa.

685
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,670
Can you play it?

686
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,280
Yes.

687
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,400
Daddy plays it very well.

688
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,150
What can you play?

689
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:55,710
Daddy can play all the pieces on this.

690
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,090
Do you want to learn?

691
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,680
You play first, and I'll listen.

692
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,110
Pick one.

693
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:11,840
This one then, Daddy.

694
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,360
Nice choice.

695
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,890
You picked the hardest one.

696
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,340
But it's not difficult for Daddy.

697
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,150
It's right up ahead,
just around the corner.

698
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,550
Yes, we're almost there.

699
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,440
This is the place.
