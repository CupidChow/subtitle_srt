[Episode 1]

3
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,420
Shu, time to get up.

4
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,520
Hurry up. There won't be any traffic
if we leave early.

5
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,520
I'm still sleepy.

6
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,570
Come on, or I'll have your dad
wake you up.

7
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,890
Get up now. Stop dawdling. Hurry.

8
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,040
Happy birthday, Mom.

9
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,620
Where did you get this?

10
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,520
I didn't know you knew this stuff.

11
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,450
Is it expensive?

12
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,600
Not really. It's not a big-name brand.

13
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,120
Thank you, son!

14
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,680
You're better than your dad!

15
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,590
He's never given me any gifts.

16
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,410
Thanks, son.

17
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,730
I didn't have time to make breakfast.
Just make do with this.

18
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,400
This is fine.

19
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,800
Guo said that Director Li loves fish,

20
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,000
so I've been frying fish all morning.

21
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,560
Hope it suits his taste.

22
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,590
Everyone loves your cooking.

23
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,079
We're going out today.

24
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:32,210
Make sure you chat more with him, okay?

25
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:34,610
Don't just sit there in awkward silence.

26
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:37,400
Look.

27
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,560
Director Li is the head of academics
at No. 2 High School.

28
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,520
I wonder if Guo and he will work out.

29
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,680
Anyway, let's make friends with him first,

30
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,000
so Shu will have someone
looking out for him at school.

31
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,530
As long as he studies hard,
he won't need any special attention.

32
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,880
Put your phone away.

33
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,350
You didn't go to sleep
until 1:30 AM this morning, did you?

34
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:09,800
The rule is that you must be in bed
before midnight.

35
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,820
I didn't tell him that.

36
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,150
How did you know?

37
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,620
Didn't you only get back
at 2:30 AM this morning?

38
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,390
Am I wrong?

39
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,560
How did you know?

40
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,240
Did you install cameras in our home?

41
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,840
Get in the car.

42
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,870
You only slept for three to four hours.

43
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:06,800
Are you tired?

44
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,210
I'm fine.

45
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,020
Give me a piece of the tea cake.

46
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,070
Don't eat it now.

47
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,680
I need to take a photo and post it later.

48
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,480
You'd better behave yourself today

49
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,740
and mind your manners.

50
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,680
Hold on tight.

51
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,020
What are you doing?

52
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,970
Don't get involved in anything today.

53
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,370
Come on, they're all fresh!

54
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,190
Steamed buns! Steamed buns!

55
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:10,250
Shen, your daughter should be
coming home soon, right?

56
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,720
Morning!

57
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,120
Morning! Take a look.

58
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,000
They're all just in.

59
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,630
Shrimp.

60
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,430
Shrimp.

61
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,410
Xiaohai, want some mantis shrimp?

62
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,980
Xiaozhou loves it.

63
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,560
She's coming home today.

64
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,960
Has Xiaozhou graduated?

65
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,190
How much per 500 g?

66
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,040
35 yuan.

67
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,790
I'll give you 1 kg for 60 yuan.

68
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,380
Well, um...

69
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:37,390
Shrimp.

70
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,830
Xiaohai really cares for his sister.

71
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,230
He's such a good brother.

72
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,390
Let's buy some.

73
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:42,850
Shrimp.

74
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,970
Use this basket.

75
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,430
Has Xiaozhou found a job yet?

76
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,360
Yes, she has.

77
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:53,190
It's a company in the high-tech zone,

78
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,390
focusing on environmental protection.

79
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,720
It matches her major perfectly.

80
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,240
Xiaozhou is a top student

81
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,310
from a prestigious university.

82
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,310
Her salary must be pretty good, right?

83
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,270
Just over 10,000 yuan.

84
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,530
I didn't ask in detail.

85
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,660
In our factory,

86
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,340
your daughter Xiaozhou is
the most successful.

87
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,560
Is she dating anyone?

88
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:08,510
No rush,

89
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,080
she's career-focused.

90
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,960
Amazing girl.

91
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,510
Fresh shrimp.

92
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:14,920
Okay.

93
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,270
We'll take these.

94
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:16,910
All right!

95
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,480
Exactly 1 kg.

96
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:22,670
What's wrong?

97
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,050
-What?
-Shrimp.

98
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,480
This is already plenty.

99
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,520
Xiaozhou is frugal.

100
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,990
She won't be happy if you buy too many.

101
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:29,460
Come on.

102
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,850
Give it to me.

103
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,170
50 yuan will do.

104
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,720
Consider this from me
to celebrate Xiaozhou's graduation.

105
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,450
-Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

106
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,560
All right.

107
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,360
Okay, take it.

108
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,480
Pair of jacks!

109
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,480
Pair of kings.

110
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,120
Pair of twos!

111
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,500
Throw down a four of a kind.

112
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,480
You in or not?

113
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,920
Eight, nine, ten, jack, queen!

114
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,920
Throw down a four of a kind.

115
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,560
With what?

116
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,420
I-I only have two cards in my hand!

117
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,070
Let me.

118
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,630
Let me finish you off!

119
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,160
I'm done.

120
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:02,800
Nice.

121
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,340
You lost again.

122
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,720
I'm done playing. I'm done playing!

123
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,870
Don't wanna play anymore?

124
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,830
Then pay up.

125
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,600
How can I keep playing with luck this bad?

126
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,270
This crappy factory

127
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,000
won't get demolished,
and we won't get any compensation either!

128
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,730
What am I supposed to play with?

129
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,580
I'm out of money for the month.

130
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,630
Guang.

131
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:29,510
What?

132
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,490
Take my advice.

133
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:34,049
Go to the police station with your ID
and change your name.

134
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,600
Maybe a new name
will turn your luck around.

135
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,390
Change it to "Straight." Straight Flush...

136
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,200
Or maybe...

137
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,840
change it to... "Flush"!

138
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,320
Flush!

139
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,740
To hell with the name "Flush"!

140
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,800
How about I call you "Punk," huh?

141
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:03,840
Punk.

142
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,080
-He's hitting him!
-He's hitting him!

143
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,490
Come here. I won't hit you.

144
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,320
Stay out of it.

145
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,670
The traffic police will handle it.

146
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,870
I have to go handle it.

147
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,030
If I can't make it today,

148
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,960
you alone will be enough.

149
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,310
What am I compared to them?

150
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,460
He's the head of academics,

151
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,320
and you're an official, at least.

152
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,660
Just come back quickly
after you've handled it.

153
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:29,600
Please stop.

154
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:30,910
Beat it.

155
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,080
Scram!

156
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,440
Police.

157
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,600
Who the hell called the cops?

158
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,270
Got here pretty fast, huh?

159
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,780
Fine, good timing.

160
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,400
He's a scammer. Arrest him.

161
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,720
Please show me your ID.

162
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:55,930
Why should I?

163
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,510
Please show me your ID.

164
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,400
Fine.

165
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,080
I'm law-abiding. I'll cooperate.

166
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,150
Your dad's probably hoping
that something will go wrong

167
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,500
so he won't have to go.

168
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,200
He never cared about me.

169
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,130
That's not true.

170
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,480
He just doesn't like asking for favors,

171
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,280
and he's terrible at small talk.

172
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,750
He's basically
what people online would call...

173
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,810
socially awkward.

174
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:45,160
How could he become a cop
if he's socially awkward?

175
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,290
He forgets about it when he's working.

176
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,390
Does your car have a dashcam?

177
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,200
No.

178
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,750
I'm not afraid of scammers.

179
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,960
This isn't a scam.

180
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,390
There were two impacts.

181
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,660
The first time,

182
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,550
you were driving too fast
and couldn't brake in time.

183
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,750
So, you swerved left,

184
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:24,000
which caused the scrape
on the right side of your car.

185
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You were going at least 90 mph
at the time.

186
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,840
No one would dare to fake an accident
at that speed.

187
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,870
The second impact

188
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:34,200
was when you stopped,
you immediately reversed

189
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:36,830
and deliberately hit that food cart again.

190
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,580
That was an intentional assault.

191
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,030
You've got quite a story there.

192
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,000
You call it assault,

193
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,320
but I think it is a scam.

194
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,020
Neither of us can convince the other.

195
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,760
Consider this my good deed for the day.

196
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,380
Let's wait for the traffic police.

197
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,380
I'm busy.

198
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,600
Don't touch me.

199
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,840
I'm giving you an official warning.

200
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,390
If you resist,

201
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,480
I will use physical force.

202
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,240
You're so pigheaded.

203
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,150
Second warning.

204
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:34,000
There are so many people
recording us right now.

205
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,260
How exactly do you plan to
use force on me?

206
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,240
Third warning.

207
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,300
-Well done!
-Yeah!

208
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:58,430
Is there even any sun?
And you're putting them out.

209
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,780
What are you doing?

210
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,590
What are you looking at?

211
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,670
Murder!

212
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,540
Guang... Guang has...

213
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,150
killed Director Yue!

214
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:08,320
-Stop!
-Don't run!

215
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,720
-Stop!
-Stop running!

216
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,360
Guang, stop!

217
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,000
-Stop!
-Stop running!

218
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,440
Stop staring! Chase him!

219
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,550
You moved your pawn,
but he moved his bishop!

220
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,240
It's not like
I've never played chess before.

221
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:20,750
He moved his bishop.

222
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,080
He moved his bishop,
and I'll move this one.

223
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,000
You're playing this all wrong!

224
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,390
Right?

225
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,670
Now he can push his knight.

226
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,270
Don't run!

227
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,120
-Don't run!
-Stop! Stop!

228
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,180
What happened?

229
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,260
What are you doing?

230
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,160
Guang killed the director!

231
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,240
Stop! Stop!

232
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,960
-Stop!
-Stop running!

233
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,440
Stop!

234
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,030
Go away! Don't come near me!

235
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:40,920
Don't run!

236
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,270
Guang! Don't run!

237
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,390
Xiaohai. Xiaohai. It's okay, it's okay.

238
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,320
Xiaohai.

239
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,840
It's alright, it's alright.

240
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,060
Everything is fine, Xiaohai. It's fine.

241
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,390
Sit.

242
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,260
It's okay. Everything is fine, Xiaohai.

243
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,000
Sit down.

244
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:05,790
Sit down. Come on.

245
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,150
Mom will turn on the radio for you.

246
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,350
Here, let's listen to a story.

247
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,350
Listen to a story.

248
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,800
It's storytime now.

249
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,080
Your sister will be back soon.

250
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,610
Wait here for her, alright?

251
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,950
Mom needs to go cook now.

252
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:21,600
Be good, be good.

253
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,870
Salt and pepper shrimp today?

254
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,470
Xiaozhou loves that.

255
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,970
This wall would be complete
with Xiaozhou's college diploma on it.

256
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,310
Xiaozhou.

257
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,589
Xiaozhou.

258
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,510
Where's Xiaohai?

259
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,640
Where's Xiaohai?

260
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,810
He's not in the room?

261
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,020
Their ID cards.

262
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:05,680
Can we go now?

263
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,310
I need to go with them for a statement.

264
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,510
Today, I'm afraid...

265
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,750
You need to... adjust the seat.

266
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,190
Wen, have you seen our Xiaohai?

267
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:56,830
Haven't seen him.

268
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,320
-No, haven't seen him.
-No.

269
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:58,920
Thank you.

270
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:04,220
What's going on today?

271
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,030
I knew that big crowd of people

272
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,750
must have scared Xiaohai.

273
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,620
Usually, when he's startled,

274
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,070
doesn't he always stay in the room?

275
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,470
Why did he run away today?

276
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,680
We should have given him
the medicine earlier.

277
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,830
Come on, everyone, stay back.

278
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:17,550
Yue!

279
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,510
Be careful!

280
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,030
Come on, be careful.

281
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,110
Come on, stay back, stay back.

282
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:21,750
Yue.

283
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:22,720
Be careful.

284
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,960
-Come on.
-Yue, how are you feeling?

285
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:28,720
Come on, be careful.

286
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,130
Stop crying. Call your daughter now.

287
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:32,840
Okay.

288
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,610
Be careful!

289
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:35,630
Auntie Zhang,

290
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,380
have you seen our Xiaohai?

291
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,010
Xiaohai? Haven't seen him.

292
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,590
He probably went to see
what all the commotion was about.

293
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,450
Where did that group of people go?

294
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:46,440
I think they went toward the old factory.

295
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:52,690
Don't call her.

296
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,200
Don't tell her.

297
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:05,330
He got attacked out of nowhere.

298
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,760
This is ridiculous.

299
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,800
Have you thought it through?

300
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,250
I know whose side you're on.

301
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,270
Isn't it just because I drive
a sports car?

302
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,960
Is driving a sports car some original sin?

303
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,490
You're overthinking this.

304
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,690
No matter what car you drive...

305
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,750
as long as your account of the accident

306
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:31,000
matches the evidence at the scene.
That's all that matters.

307
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I'm injured.

308
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:34,000
This counts as police brutality, right?

309
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,070
No, that was standard procedure.

310
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,720
I want a medical assessment.

311
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,350
Sure.

312
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,840
Please wait a moment.

313
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,710
Hello, Captain Lian.

314
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,170
Officer Lian Haiping, right?

315
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:02,790
I'm the representative

316
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,720
for the person you just brought in.

317
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,040
How about we go somewhere private to talk?

318
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,300
Let's talk right here.

319
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:11,590
This accident wasn't caught on camera,

320
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:13,030
so there's no video evidence.

321
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:15,110
It all comes down to
the witness statements.

322
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:17,240
To put it plainly, it's just your word.

323
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,520
And the victim's statement too.

324
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,110
Yes.

325
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,240
But mainly, it's yours that matters.

326
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,030
So,

327
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,720
this matter could go either way.

328
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,600
Hold on.

329
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,880
Since we're talking about the case,

330
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,310
let's...

331
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,240
keep a record.

332
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,590
Shen!

333
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:42,640
Your son, Xiaohai,

334
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,750
h-he bit me.

335
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,620
Where did you run into him?

336
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,000
He went that way,

337
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,090
mumbling something about
picking up his sister.

338
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:50,030
When I called out to him,

339
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:51,160
he got all worked up!

340
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:52,340
Thank you.

341
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:56,890
[Xuri Factory]

342
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,590
Xiaohai!

343
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,830
Xiaohai. Xiaohai.

344
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:12,310
You... you ran out
and didn't even tell us!

345
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,310
-You had us worried sick!
-Xiaohai.

346
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,170
That should be Xiaozhou's bus.

347
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,000
Xiaohai, Xiaohai, Xiaohai.

348
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,790
Xiaohai, calm down.

349
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,400
Let's wait for the next one.

350
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,070
Let's wait for the next bus.

351
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,000
The next one.

352
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:51,680
[I want to reach a settlement
and won't press any charges.]

353
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,330
How much compensation did they offer you?

354
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,310
This is my number.

355
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:20,590
If they try to pull anything, call me.

356
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:34,440
Lian.

357
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:37,110
Weren't you supposed to be off-duty today?

358
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,270
Ran into a little case

359
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,200
and had to come here to handle it.

360
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,400
I'm heading back now.

361
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,880
He's a new recruit.

362
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,680
Sorry, I just spat on your shoe.

363
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,880
I'll accept the fine. Give him 100 yuan.

364
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,920
Hurry up.

365
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:05,590
Never mind. Just go.

366
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,270
I'm sorry.

367
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,410
Here, use this to wipe it.

368
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:20,920
Officer, those shoes were made in Italy.

369
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,210
I'll pay you 200 yuan then?

370
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,510
It's fine.

371
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,840
It's just a pair of shoes.

372
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:32,860
I'll throw them away if they're dirty.

373
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,490
What a cocky bastard.

374
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,850
All of you, come with me.

375
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,000
Commander Feng.

376
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:45,120
Haiping, you come too.

377
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,000
You'll have to postpone your time off.

378
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,640
Come.

379
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:58,720
This is Shi Qiangfeng,

380
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,180
reporting for duty today.

381
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,560
If I remember correctly,

382
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,340
you're assigned to Unit Two, right?

383
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,740
Yes, Unit Two,

384
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,070
the major crimes unit.

385
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:07,880
Zhao's

386
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,830
taken Unit Two to chase a fugitive.

387
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,800
Let him join your Unit Three for now.

388
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,450
There's something urgent.

389
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,110
We've just received a report—

390
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,750
someone causing trouble at Xuri Factory,

391
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,880
an intentional assault.

392
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,400
The victim has been taken to the hospital

393
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,830
and is currently in critical care.

394
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,500
The suspect fled to the old factory area,

395
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,230
and locals have him surrounded.
You go handle it.

396
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,110
Does Unit Three handle major crimes too?

397
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:34,240
Lian Haiping treats all cases the same,
big or small. Go.

398
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,220
You got all dressed up nicely today.

399
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,750
Got a blind date after work?

400
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:46,910
Do you have a photo? Let me take a look
and give you some advice.

401
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,720
You've been on, what,

402
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,490
50-something blind dates this year, right?

403
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:52,640
No, only... only nine times.

404
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:53,720
Let me see.

405
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:55,830
Here you go.

406
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:10,940
We're not taking guns?

407
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,450
No need.

408
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,920
It's your first day. Take a key for now.

409
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:53,390
Let's not wait here anymore.

410
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,110
I should go home and cook.

411
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:03,320
Hello, the number you have dialed is
powered off.

412
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,550
Why is her phone off?

413
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,640
Could it be that when we came out,

414
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,750
we missed Xiaozhou,

415
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,350
and she went home by herself?

416
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:20,760
Xiaohai.

417
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,130
Hello, the number you have dialed is
powered off.

418
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,240
Still off.

419
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,300
Why don't we try calling Yue Chunxia?

420
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:57,790
Hello, Chunxia.

421
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,340
This is Uncle Shen.

422
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,880
Is Xiaozhou still at school?

423
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:04,660
Her phone is turned off.

424
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:13,980
Okay.

425
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,270
Okay, thank you.

426
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:24,630
Chunxia said that Xiaozhou didn't go back
to the dorm last night.

427
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:31,090
Then... you go to the school and check.

428
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,520
Right, right.

429
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,410
I'll go now.

430
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:36,880
If you see Yue Chunxia,

431
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,460
don't mention what happened to her dad.

432
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,590
Director Yue doesn't want her to know.

433
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:48,030
-Stop!
-Stop!

434
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:51,350
Stop!

435
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,350
The victim of the assault is
Director Yue Hongbing.

436
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,750
The details are still unclear.

437
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,460
Xuri Factory used to be a chemical plant.

438
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,680
Later, it was converted into
a synthetic fiber factory.

439
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,510
It'd been

440
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:08,480
our city’s leading enterprise
ever since the Liberation.

441
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,680
Then, it went through restructuring.

442
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,590
It was renamed to something like
"Xuri Corporation,"

443
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,350
but people don't like using that name.

444
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,680
They still call it Xuri Factory

445
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,960
and call the boss "Director,"

446
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,480
because it sounds more familiar.

447
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:21,480
With workers and their families,
there are tens of thousands of people.

448
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,730
Drive... drive slower.

449
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:26,560
Not every driver on the road

450
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,360
knows to give way to police cars.

451
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:31,430
The factory shut down a few years ago.

452
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,580
Many workers had to find new jobs.

453
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,530
The old factory area is waiting for
demolition and redevelopment.

454
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:38,510
Stop.

455
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,570
See? I could make it.

456
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:49,110
I-I'm telling you, drive like that,

457
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,970
and the crowd will be on your case.

458
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,060
Pull over and stop.

459
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,400
Stop the car.

460
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:02,760
Qi, you drive.

461
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:03,720
Got it.

462
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,840
[Southern University
of Science and Technology]

463
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,270
Come in.

464
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:31,960
Uncle.

465
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:33,580
Has Xiaozhou come back?

466
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,240
Chunxia!

467
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,350
Uncle Shen.

468
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:46,150
She hasn't come back since last night?

469
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,540
No, she hasn't.

470
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,970
Have any of you seen Xiaozhou?

471
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,350
-No.
-No.

472
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,110
We've asked everyone
in her class and department,

473
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:56,040
but none of them has seen Xiaozhou.

474
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:00,310
I'll head back first then.

475
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,000
Well,

476
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:04,920
maybe we should report her as missing.

477
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,690
-Murderer!
-Murderer!

478
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,940
-Make way!
-Make way!

479
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:18,640
Calm down!

480
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:22,510
Stay back! Stay back, you hear me?

481
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:23,610
Back up, back up, back up!

482
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:24,480
Don't do anything rash!

483
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,680
Calm down! Calm down!

484
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:28,420
Run? I'm done running today!

485
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,960
You've been chasing me all day long!

486
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,680
It's the old sewage treatment plant.

487
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,810
What are you all doing here?

488
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:34,960
What's there to see?

489
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,510
You idiots don't understand anything!

490
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:38,960
I'm a hero,

491
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,490
a great hero of our factory!

492
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:41,550
That Yue Hongbing

493
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:44,280
sold our factory land to developers
for peanuts!

494
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:47,160
And we've got to pay sky-high prices
for resettlement housing!

495
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,920
How much kickback did Yue Hongbing take?

496
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,550
Is he even human?

497
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:50,750
Evacuate the crowd quietly,

498
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:51,330
and don't startle him.

499
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:53,050
Guang, come down now!

500
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,310
The settling tank is
full of industrial wastewater!

501
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,310
If you fall in,

502
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,880
even your bones will dissolve!

503
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,610
-Come down now!
-What kind of water is in the tank?

504
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,110
It's not as scary as he says.

505
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:04,350
This is the final settling tank
for wastewater.

506
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,510
The treated wastewater

507
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:07,240
already meets the standards
for ocean discharge.

508
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,970
Of course, it's not drinkable,

509
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:10,500
but it's not toxic anymore.

510
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:12,350
Besides, the plant's been shut down
for years,

511
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,310
and with all the rain lately

512
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,320
and seawater backflow,

513
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,720
it's all diluted by now. It's fine.

514
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,880
The drainage pipe at the bottom leads
straight out to the ocean!

515
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,000
If you get sucked into the sea,
you're done for!

516
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:20,800
Come down now!

517
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,480
Sir,

518
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,740
that's actually true.

519
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,320
All of you, listen up!

520
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:27,920
Bleakly and weakly the wind blows;
coldly the Yi River flows!

521
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:31,000
A true man fears not death!

522
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:33,160
Come on, I'm ready to die!

523
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,240
I'll go around from behind

524
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,170
and pull him down

525
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,510
while he's distracted.

526
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:37,790
I'm a hero,

527
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,030
a great hero of our factory!

528
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,880
Where are his family members?

529
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:43,510
He has a mother at home

530
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:44,720
who has trouble walking.

531
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,640
She probably doesn't know about this yet.

532
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,040
Get his mother over here.

533
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,430
Don't come any closer! Stop right there!

534
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:00,300
Guang, I'm a police officer.

535
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,010
Like I care who you are!

536
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:02,930
Listen to me,

537
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,110
Director Yue is in the hospital now,

538
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,550
but his condition is stable.

539
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:07,550
Put that rod down

540
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:08,610
and come over here.

541
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,200
Listen, Guang,

542
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,310
up until now,

543
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:13,200
you really haven't done anything
that serious.

544
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,720
You're still far from the point of
no return.

545
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,200
Is this how you want everyone to see you?

546
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,400
I don't care how far it is.

547
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,920
I'm a great hero now.

548
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,360
Stop this nonsense. Come here quickly.

549
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,610
Back up! Back up!

550
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:48,770
Come on!

551
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:53,920
Come on.

552
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,240
Give me your hand!

553
00:33:59,080 --> 00:33:59,640
Come on.

554
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,739
Don't move around!

555
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:12,760
You idiot!

556
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:15,790
You just wouldn't drop
that darn iron rod, huh?

557
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,670
Get up now. Come with us.

558
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,760
There's another one down there.

559
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,960
There's another one.

560
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:29,590
Please calm down.

561
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,489
She might not actually be missing.

562
00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:32,760
In most cases,

563
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,510
they return home within a day.

564
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,030
Her classmates and teachers

565
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,840
haven't seen her
since yesterday afternoon.

566
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,150
My daughter is always very well-behaved.

567
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,230
She'd never just disappear
without telling us...

568
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,560
Why don't you wait here?

569
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:42,900
I'll organize the information

570
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,100
and report it to the officers in charge.

571
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:46,230
Okay.

572
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,200
Did you see anything else

573
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,110
down there?

574
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,160
I didn't notice.

575
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,490
I'll get in the water and check again.

576
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:04,420
You're injured.

577
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,510
It's nothing, just a small cut.

578
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:10,320
Don't go down.

579
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:12,710
Really, I'm fine.

580
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:15,070
Go have that wound treated first.

581
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:15,550
No need.

582
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,070
I'm going down to check.

583
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:17,670
Come back.

584
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,480
I'm responsible for your safety.

585
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,650
I'll go down.

586
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,590
It's over. It's over. It's over.

587
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:43,520
Go back, go back.

588
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,450
Come on, let's go back.

589
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,150
Everyone up there, come down!

590
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:50,760
Go back! Let's go! Let's go!

591
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,110
Is there still something down there?

592
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,150
No, no, nothing down there.

593
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:53,960
Go, go, go.

594
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,150
Go back, go back.
