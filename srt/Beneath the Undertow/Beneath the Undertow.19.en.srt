1
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,200
Hand lamp

2
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,840
Come with me, and others to the left

3
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,520
Xiao Chu

4
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,840
Let's calm down all

5
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,400
We will care about it

6
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,800
We will definitely take care of it

7
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,400
You are thirsty, right?

8
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,520
Drink some water

9
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:13,960
Xiao Chu

10
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,720
I'm sorry

11
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,600
You are not sorry for me

12
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,160
truly

13
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:28,880
I'm sorry

14
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,080
Why did she cut off her foot?

15
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,320
It cannot be completely thrown into the sea

16
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,320
I was afraid that the waves would return

17
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,120
So I thought then

18
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:38,560
Cutting it will be easy to get rid of

19
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,760
I did not imitate the crime

20
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,400
I wanted to fabricate the charge for me Dada

21
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,120
If I knew that I had this

22
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,040
I would definitely be

23
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,800
What a wonderful coincidence, right?

24
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,400
Li Dada I admit everything at once

25
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,159
I just wanted to cut the body

26
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,000
But I didn't expect

27
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,480
This is easy to speak

28
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,840
It is very difficult to implement

29
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,520
After cutting one feet

30
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,840
I thought about the remaining amount of work

31
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,200
I surrendered

32
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,680
Where did you get the electric saw?

33
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,480
In fact, I gave me Dada

34
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,880
Once we went together to eat a grilled sheep

35
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,320
And I was praised by how effective

36
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,640
So he gave it to me

37
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,280
I always kept it in my car box

38
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,240
I never used it

39
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,440
Were you admired Bishen Xiao Chu?

40
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,560
Did you reject you?

41
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,240
no

42
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,280
I met it a few times

43
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,120
- بلوھد

44
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,040
It is not the type that can be easily obtained

45
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,240
There are many women

46
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,520
I will not waste my time with her

47
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,960
So why did you sexually assault it?

48
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,760
I don't know

49
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,080
It was an instant whim

50
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,000
Or perhaps

51
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,600
hatred

52
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,840
I just hate it

53
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,320
I have spoiled my big plans

54
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,120
So I wanted to destroy it

55
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,520
After that I had no choice

56
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,320
I thought about the Shura factory

57
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,040
And the pipeline drainage to the sea

58
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,520
Unfortunately

59
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,600
I did not succeed

60
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,520
And you discovered the matter

61
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,120
After the case appeared

62
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,440
I have no Long

63
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,480
He said he did not intend to kill her

64
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,039
prattle!

65
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:37,960
After what he said then

66
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,120
How can I understand it in another way?

67
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,240
Xiao Chu

68
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:48,920
It was very naive

69
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,800
I went to talk to Le Long

70
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,040
What can be discussed?

71
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,520
I am exaggerated in appreciation of human morals

72
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,760
The moment before it was lost in awareness

73
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,160
She did not expect that she would die on that day

74
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,680
All of them try to save lives

75
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,160
We too

76
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,280
We must feel proud of this

77
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,520
We feel proud

78
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,560
And this work

79
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,560
It deserves to be dedicated to our lives

80
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,600
Not necessarily

81
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,960
It is the bravest of what you imagine

82
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,600
courage

83
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,560
What is the benefit of courage?

84
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,600
Do you think it is alone

85
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,920
You can shake an institution of this size

86
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,840
And changed this world?

87
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,600
I shook it

88
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,360
The world also changed, right?

89
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,880
You are considered high -level intellectuals.

90
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,240
How did you become like this?

91
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,720
When I was a student,

92
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,440
And when my company started,

93
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,720
I was a very simple person.

94
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,680
I had

95
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,000
The so -called dreams.

96
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,160
after that,

97
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,120
I dealt with more and more people,

98
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,760
The interests I deal with are larger and greater.

99
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,320
I discovered that with money,

100
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,400
You can achieve anything,

101
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,720
And get everything you want.

102
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,320
When I have not yet achieved success,

103
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,040
I felt as if I were a neglected piece

104
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,000
Anyone can kick it here and there.

105
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,240
And what if

106
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,640
I ended up in the sewers one day?

107
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,320
I will have to stay in that dark place

108
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,200
Glory and stinks throughout my life.

109
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,360
So it must become like a mountain,

110
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,040
Do not move it,

111
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,200
Look at everyone from the top.

112
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:05,840
Go back.

113
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,040
Open it.

114
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,640
naturally,

115
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,000
I am still a little far away,

116
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,240
But Le Long, he has arrived there.

117
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,560
Did he really succeed?

118
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,000
Maybe you will see it soon.

119
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,400
Police! Don't move!

120
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,000
The man inside threw something.

121
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,280
Slowly get up.

122
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,800
What happened to your head?

123
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,320
The tunnel collapsed and struck me.

124
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,080
Your company Jane Hi

125
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,880
The quality of construction is very bad.

126
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,480
Very thin wooden sticks.

127
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,920
Yes, if it was steel, we would have escaped a long time ago.

128
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,360
Hello leader Zhao.

129
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,800
We met before.

130
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,760
According to my information,

131
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,120
Your younger brother's brother works for a decor company.

132
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,280
In the last two years,

133
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,720
The real estate market in Ling Chuan has evolved very quickly.

134
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,160
Its income is very good,

135
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,880
He supports his entire family.

136
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,840
You have been fulfilled,

137
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,600
What do you want to say?

138
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,600
I never used my position for my personal interest.

139
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,840
I didn't mean,

140
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,120
I understand your situation.

141
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,000
This is your work,

142
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,560
You are only carrying out orders.

143
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,120
But the Chinese have an example he says,

144
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:03,800
Leader in ...

145
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,520
Enough.

146
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,760
Come with us.

147
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,400
Good,

148
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,360
I will go with you.

149
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,200
Put the restrictions on it.

150
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,160
Have you crazy!

151
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,080
Let's go.

152
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,040
my lord.

153
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:57,960
Leader.

154
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,360
We cannot stay here, go out quickly!

155
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,440
Come on, quickly!

156
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,880
How did this happen?

157
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,280
Is anyone there!

158
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,360
Agizouni!

159
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,400
I confess,

160
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,280
Wealth like magnet,

161
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,520
It attracts people to it.

162
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,240
It is also like sea water,

163
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,120
The more you drank from it, the more your thirst.

164
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,360
In reality,

165
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,360
The fun itself

166
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,080
It is not the main reason for my desire.

167
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,880
For me,

168
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,000
Wealth is just proof.

169
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,720
It is a point recording panel for a kind of games

170
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,480
I really brought me a lot of happiness

171
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,120
This happiness made me drown in it

172
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,200
I sat down my deep desires

173
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,880
Once these desires are satisfied

174
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,960
It becomes like a drug

175
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,040
It makes you addicted to it

176
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,600
You can't afford to lose it

177
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,160
Check your conscience

178
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,520
This is not important

179
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,840
While you see your eyes

180
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,360
Yourself goes on the path of return

181
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,600
You can't return

182
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,560
No way to return

183
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,560
I really don't know

184
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,320
This feeling of happiness you are talking about

185
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,360
Let me tell you about my happiness

186
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,680
I will tell you something random

187
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:25,920
once

188
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,720
We three went to tourism in an ancient town

189
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,360
My child was very small at the time

190
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,000
In the first grade

191
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,240
It was a bitter winter

192
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,640
It was very late

193
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,680
I closed all stores on the street

194
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,520
The atmosphere was very cold

195
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,280
We found a store that is still open

196
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,880
He was selling a kind of

197
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,280
Local tea made of dried fruits and lotus roots

198
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,840
My wife wanted to eat from him

199
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,079
She loves sweet foods

200
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,800
The store owner was an elderly woman

201
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,640
I prepared for us one bowl

202
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,480
The store was small

203
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,720
We were only the three

204
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,440
Sitting under that lamp

205
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,440
I was watching them while they were eating a sip after another

206
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,800
The steam was rising from it

207
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,120
They did not fear his heat on their mouths

208
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,200
They are racing to eat it

209
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,080
My wife asked me to take a sip, but I did not do

210
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,440
I was looking at them

211
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,680
My heart was so sweet that I could not eat more

212
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,120
I suddenly felt a certain feeling

213
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,440
We walked long in

214
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,600
This cold dark night

215
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,840
And in the end

216
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,160
We will meet under

217
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,400
That little warm light

218
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,800
I know that

219
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,320
These are the people whom I love more than anything

220
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,600
They also love me more than anything

221
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,080
Our life is very normal

222
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,920
But the time I spend with them

223
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,840
It is the happiest moments of my life

224
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,560
In my life

225
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,200
I never had people like this

226
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,520
The atmosphere is very suffocating, let me breathe some air

227
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,440
Shin Xiao Chu was very good

228
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,840
She did not know how evil of the bad guys

229
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,760
If it had been reported early

230
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,800
When she died

231
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,360
So the good people always cannot overcome the bad guys

232
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,920
Especially if he is a giant evil

233
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,680
We cannot ask the good people to give up their kindness

234
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,640
We are policemen

235
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,320
Our mission is to protect those kind

236
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,240
The naive and the weak

237
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,360
He cut claws and evil fangs

238
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,000
To make them

239
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,440
They hesitated before harming the good people

240
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,000
We analyzed the case

241
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,840
This is Shi Qiang Feng

242
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,240
Yoon van

243
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:26,760
Let's go

244
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,160
Thanks for your efforts, Ving

245
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:37,920

248
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,200
Director Cio

249
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,200

250
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,160
Thanks

251

Thanks

253
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,000
The case has been resolved

254
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,800
The criminal was arrested

255
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,760
It was resolved and arrested

256
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,080
The case has been resolved

257
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,480
The criminal was arrested

258
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,040
The Xiao Chu case has been resolved

259
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,560
The Xiao Chu case has been resolved

260
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,000
Good

261
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,120
The case has been resolved

262
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,000
The case has been resolved

263
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,560
Thanks to the people's police

264
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,960
Thanks to the people's police

265
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,920
Thanks to the police

266
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,600
The case has been resolved, we are workers of the Shura Factory

267
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,000
We feel comfortable now

268
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,760
No no

269
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,800
Thanks to the police comrades, thank you very much

270
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,200

271
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,080
Thank you all

272
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,200
Thank you, thank you

273
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:20,840
Unnecessary

274
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,040
Thank you all

275
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,440
Not possible

276
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,880
Thanks to the police

277
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,400
Good

278
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,680
I will close the window, I will close the window

279
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,600
Thanks to the police

280
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,400
Thanks to the police comrades

Thanks

283
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,080
He is crying

284
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,600
See how kind they are

285
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,240
These are the people we must protect

286
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,560
If he grew up, he is Xiang Zah among these good people

287
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,440
Was it different from what it is today?

288
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,320
Get out of the car

289
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,840
Go and pay

290
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,080
This is from Basta, fresh from Basta

291
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,240
They are all fresh, all newly shed

292
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,640
Brother Qing, Fish fresh today, what do you think of two thickness?

293
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,280
I don't want thickness today

294
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:40,880
I do not eat fish today

295
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,960
Ten, three pieces of ten yuan, right?

296
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,680
Three pieces of ten yuan

297
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,160
Fifteen, well

298
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,360
When I come to your store, you have to take care of me well

299
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,760
Thanks

300
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,320
Goodbye, bye

301
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,560
Well, no problem

302
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,120
One for you

303
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,120
Come on, move your feet

304
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,160
Thanks

305
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,320
Sit steadily

306
00:26:59,360 --> 00:26:59,880
The bed

307
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,960
Beijing

308
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,080
Hias

309
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:46,880
I am waiting

310
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,280
My hair is scattered

311
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,680
Let me see

312
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,280
Beijing

313
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:58,840
Beijing

314
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,960
Beijing

315
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,120
Come on, come on

316
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,600
Beijing

317
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,880
Tiananmen Square in Beijing

318
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,800
Tiananman

319
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,600
I did not expect to be walked

320
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,640
It can become a policeman.

321
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,520
Is it not assumed that three generations of your ancestors will be verified to become a policeman?

322
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,200
When I was a policeman

323
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,240
I was an orphan.

324
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,720
The scar on your face

325
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,040
Did Lian Hai Ping caused it?

326
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,000
Thanks to the people who helped me.

327
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,320
They made me different from you.

328
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,040
He slept for a full day and night

329
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,480
Wake him up.

330
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,560
no

331
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,080
Let him sleep.

332
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,160
Let him sleep until he is satisfied.

333
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,120
Let's go.

334
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,880
It looks in good moral condition.

335
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,440
Why don't you swallow it at once?

336
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,160
I also understood

337
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,920
This work instead of handing it over to the stomach

338
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,560
It is better to deliver it to the teeth first.

339
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,560
The case ended

340
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,480
And I will leave soon.

341
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,040
Write a report.

342
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:20,320
For the caliph, it is better to nominate Mr. Zhao

343
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,160
To be a leader.

344
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,520
It is more appropriate than me.

345
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,360
My teeth are still fine

346
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,040
You are still able to bite the solid bones for a few years.

347
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,760
This is a gift for you

348
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,400
I picked it up.

349
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,600
Thanks.

350
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,280
My teacher.
