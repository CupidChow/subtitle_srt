I'm okay, Dad.

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,830
Mom, take a break. Let me take over.

7
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:24,960
I don't need to rest.

I just went to your house

and saw no one was home,

15
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:35,030

Here. Over here.

17
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,150
It must be the college admission letter,
right?

18
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:38,790
Thank you.

19
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,600
She got admitted?

20

Yes, she got admitted.

I know where
the Garden Road Traffic Police Station is.

51

No need. Pull over.

see if the other party is willing
to go through insurance

62
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,960
or handle it some other way.

What about the car that cut us off?

Children of police officers

125
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,120
She used to work as a waitress
at a Japanese restaurant,

126

127

130
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,240

with rather strong
counter-investigation awareness.

150
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,270
A bit too strong, okay?

almost everywhere nowadays,

152
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,950

where Jia Beibei

last encountered the murderer.

155
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,070
Based on her last known movements,

156
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:37,159
she most likely went with the murderer
at the beach.

157
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:41,430
The place where Wang Yishan

158
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:44,420
was last seen is likely also at the beach.

159
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:50,190

around here.

We were drinking because of him.

168
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,830
He got dumped.

169
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,370
Where did you drink?

170
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,270
At a buddy's place.

171
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,720
Specific address?

172
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,850
No idea. Who remembers house numbers?

I forgot.
I was just there to join the fun.

175
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,970
Why would I care whose place it was?

I want to open
my own advertising company someday,

188
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,210
so I'm getting some experience first.

189
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,570
On the evening of June 19th,

190
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,060
you guys were drinking at your place,
right?

191
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,910
Yes, at my place.

192
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:12,640
I live alone.

193
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,440
Until what time did you drink?

194
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,600
Until after 1 AM, I think.

195
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,950
I could barely get up the next day.

196
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:22,170
What happened to Zhang Haoyang's hand?

197
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,790
His hand?

198
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:26,440
He was drunk

199
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,750
and cut his hand on a bottle.

200
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,280
Otherwise, we wouldn't have ended
the party.

201
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,630
You don't suspect Zhang Haoyang, do you?

202
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:36,910
He wouldn't do something like that.

203
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,840
He's a model citizen in our circle.

204
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,000
Is that so?

205
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:41,960
You probably don't know,

206
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,270
but Zhang Haoyang's parents

207
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,070
divorced when he was very young.

208
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,870
He'd been living with his mother
ever since.

209
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,670
Then, when he was in high school,

210
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,840
his mother passed away.

211
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,790
His father never had another son,

212
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,240
so he took him back.

213
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,910
Even though, like us,

214
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,480
he doesn't have to worry about money,

215
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,080
he's not flashy at all,

216
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,000
very low-key.

217
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,870
At first, when his father

218
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,670
took him to various gatherings,

219
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,030
he was really uncomfortable.

220
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,750
Later, he got a bit better,

221
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,800
and started hanging out with us.

222
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:07,840
We all know that

223
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,840
he's been pursuing someone relentlessly,

224
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,790
that college girl,

225
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,330
but none of us have met her.

226
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,870
With Zhang Haoyang's personality,

227
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,800
he wouldn't even step on an insect,

228
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,200
let alone kill someone.

229
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,720
That's just impossible.

230
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,280
If there's nothing else, I'll just...

231
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:23,360
Okay.

232
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,970
Do you think what he said is credible?

233
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,150
We should remain skeptical for now.

234
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:35,630
Who's next?

235
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,910
Not a good guy.

236
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:40,750
Here you go.

237
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:42,840
And yours.

238
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,270
Import and export?

239
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,780
What do you actually sell?

240
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,240
Whatever interests me.

241
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,960
Like this,

242
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,020
and the sofas and lamps over there.
They're all limited editions.

243
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,030
I sell this as well.

244
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,200
Basically, I sell anything
that interests me.

245
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,240
I just want to make my life

246
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,330
a bit more comfortable.

247
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,040
And the wine we drank that day

248
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,380
was brought over by me.

249
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:17,560
You're the leader of this little circle,
aren't you?

250
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,080
Not really.

251
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
They just respect me.

252
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,480
How's your relationship
with Zhang Haoyang?

253
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,670
Do you know him well?

254
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,200
Haoyang? He's my buddy.

255
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,510
I shouldn't talk about
a friend behind his back,

256
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,970
but since you asked,

257
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,390
I have to tell you.

258
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,480
Haoyang is a nice guy,

259
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,000
but

260
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,240
he's rather weak.

261
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,310
After going back to live with his father,

262
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,100
his living environment changed suddenly,

263
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,430
and he felt pretty lost.

264
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,670
His father wanted him
to take over the family business,

265
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:58,440
but he wasn't interested in the whole
calligraphy, painting, and jade thing.

266
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,570
He felt pretty lost,

267
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,410
and that's when he met... Shen Xiaozhou.

268
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,870
Did I say it right?
It's Shen Xiaozhou, right?

269
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,670
Have you ever met Shen Xiaozhou?

270
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:07,480
No.

271
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,820
Haoyang wouldn't let us meet her.
He's possessive.

272
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,840
But Haoyang told us

273
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,840
that this girl

274
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,120
has helped him a lot.

275
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,790
Many times when he didn't know what to do,

276
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,030
this girl gave him a lot of encouragement.

277
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,200
In Haoyang's words,

278
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:31,510
that girl's like a sunflower.

279
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,310
Seeing her brightens his heart.

280
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,750
So you're quite close to Zhang Haoyang,

281
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:42,270
for him to share
so many personal feelings with you?

282
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:45,750
We have a lot in common, I guess.

283
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,360
I'm lost too,

284
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,900
and this company is

285
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,660
the result of that.

286
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:58,080
You're trying to say being a rich kid
isn't all that easy, right?

287
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,280
About what happened last time,

288
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,840
I'd like to formally apologize
to you both, Officers.

289
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,350
I'm very sorry

290
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,390
for letting you see
such a disturbed side of me.

291
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,370
But this condition of mine,

292
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,790
it gets better when I take my medication.

293
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,720
What,

294
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:33,790
are we really going with
Shi Qiangfeng's stupid idea?

295
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,720
How is that his idea?

296
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,320
The expert suggested it.

297
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,200
We were going to investigate anyway.

298
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,240
The expert said

299
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,790
the killer might frequently purchase
women's shoes.

300
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:44,670
So we should check the shoe sections

301
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,840
in all major department stores
and specialty shops.

302
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,370
Is this for the entire city?

303
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,360
You really don't know the drill.

304
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,270
Not even close.

305
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,080
This is just about one-tenth of them.

306
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,910
Fortunately, there aren't many men

307
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,910
who buy women's shoes by themselves.

308
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:00,690
Did Jia Beibei take out any
high-interest loans before she was killed?

309
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:01,870
Before Jia Beibei was killed,

310
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:04,130
it seems her account
did receive a sum of money,

311
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:06,410
about 20,000 in cash,

312
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,520
but she apparently didn't get a chance
to spend it.

313
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,600
Bring in Diao for questioning.

314
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:14,050
Do you know why you're being questioned?

315
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,870
Captain Zhao broke his hand.

316
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,030
That's a serious injury.

317
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,560
I wasn't the one who hit him.

318
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,260
But you bought the hammer.

319
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,000
There's a payment record online.

320
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,800
You provided the murder weapon.

321
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,510
Even though during the arrest,

322
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,310
you were the first to surrender,

323
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,480
aside from the one who actually did it,

324
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:32,910
you might still end up
getting three, five,

325
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,200
or maybe even ten years

326
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,950
more than the others in jail.
Is it worth it?

327
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,130
Show him the photos again.

328
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,390
You still have a chance to redeem yourself

329
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,990
by making up for your crimes.

330
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,160
I've seen her.

331
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,820
Every cash transaction over 10,000 yuan

332
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,860
had to go through Shark himse...

333
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:03,570
I mean, Sha Hongli, himself.

334
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,750
He was the one who took her away.

335
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:10,030
I don't know what happened after that.

336
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,910
Didn't I say he wasn't allowed to go?

337
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:17,480
He said he'd go to Grandma's house
even if it meant going to jail.

338
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,960
I've already scolded him
about the driving,

339
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,120
that if he dares do it again, I'll...

340
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,450
I'll cry in front of him.

341
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,440
Just let him go.

342
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,360
He listens to my dad after all.

343
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,630
You two start arguing
as soon as you see each other.

344
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,030
He's going through puberty now.

345
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,390
Why should you argue with him?

346
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,120
I'm doing this for his own good.

347
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,090
He doesn't see it that way.

348
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,100
He thinks you look down on him.

349
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,670
He wouldn't be that foolish.

350
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:44,550
I'll go find him.

351
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,360
Don't go.

352
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,240
Hello?

353
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,240
Is this Lian?

354
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,960
I'm Jia from
the Garden Road Traffic Police Station.

355
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,420
When your son was driving,

356
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,000
a car suddenly changed lanes
and deliberately cut him off.

357
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,150
We've identified their license plate.

358
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,270
It's a fake,

359
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:03,660
so we need to investigate further.

360
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,980
Do you have any photos?

361
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:05,750
Yes.

362
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,760
There's surveillance footage.

363
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:08,270
This car

364
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:10,960
is connected to a case I'm investigating
right now.

365
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,420
Alright then,
I'll get that footage for you.

366
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:16,800
Who was that?

367
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,000
It's nothing.

368
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,560
Tell his grandfather

369
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,740
to keep him from going out these days.

370
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,160
So you agreed?

371
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,360
I'll make you something to eat.

372
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,130

You laid hands on Lian Haiping's son,
didn't you?

383
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,850
I was just scaring him,

384
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,350
causing Lian Haiping some trouble,

385
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,540
just to see if he gets the message.

386
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,660
Kun, did I do something wrong?

387
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,700
Didn't you say
we should go for his weak spot?

388
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,370
Can't you use your brain for once?

389
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,200
Why didn't you just
get rid of Lian Haiping once and for all?

390
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,000
Kun,

391
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:08,570
he's a cop.

392
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:11,880
Taking him out directly would cause
way too much trouble, wouldn't it?

393
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,200
So you know he's a cop.

394
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:17,830
Touching his family
would be just as much trouble.

395
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,240
Cops hate that the most.

396
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,830
Then... I...

397
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,410
From now on, without my orders,

398
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,590
don't make another move,

399
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:27,480

400
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,440
Understood. Understood.

401
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,700

402
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:35,060
Sing!

403
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,830

00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,440
Yes.

407
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,830
I'll take one.

408
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,940
I'll have one too, please.

409
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,110
I'll have one too.

410
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,000
Sorry, I'm working alone,

411
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,270
so you'll have to wait a bit.

412
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:32,830
No problem.

413
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,720
Take your time. It's fine, no rush.

415
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,110
Xiaohai,

416
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:39,590
want some jelly?

417
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,590
Give me your hand.

00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,400

00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,840
Look how busy you are.

421
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,790
Shen, he... He can't help.

422
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,350
Here, give me two.

423
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,860
Auntie Zhang,
I thought you didn't eat these.

424
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,480
I'm buying them for my husband.

425
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,880
Take the money first.

426
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,240
Xiaohai.

427
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:05,110
Xiaohai, what are you doing?

428
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,490
Come on, let me help you.

429
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,000
This kid.

430
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,780
Don't touch it!

431
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,210
Your hands are all greasy.

432
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,310
Captain Lian.

433
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,400
The victim, Jia Beibei,

434
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,530
used to work at a Japanese restaurant,

435
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:45,350
Sakura House,

436
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,480
which is on the same street
as Zhang Haoyang's place,

437
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,740
about 500 meters away.

438
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:51,780
Sakura House?

439
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,440
Yes.

440
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,240
Such an expensive restaurant.

441
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,040
He must have eaten there, right?

442
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:00,000
Go report this to Team Leader Zhao.

443
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,680
But this is our suspect.

444
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,350
Just go.

445
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,310
Team Leader Zhao.

446
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:14,030
Captain Lian asked me to report this
to you.

447
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,830
They're not far from each other.

448
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,680
He must have eaten there.

449
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,720
Thank you.

450
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:25,030
Being on the same street doesn't
necessarily mean they ate together, right?

451
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:30,440
There were napkins from Sakura House

452
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,950
in Zhang Haoyang's trash can
in his office.

453
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,200
He could have ordered takeout.

454
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,160
Lin Zi.

455
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,880
Thanks for your trouble.

456
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,310
We'll focus completely
on the loan shark lead.

457
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,070
You've already been investigating
Zhang Haoyang,

458
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:44,920
so keep at it.

459
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:47,370
Let's not interfere with each other.

460
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,500
I've brought him here to help you.

461
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,230
This is supposed to be a two-person job,

462
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,230
so help her out.

463
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,830
Xiaohai, come on.

464
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,000
Come to my place.

465
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,960
There's lots of good food and fun stuff.

466
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,690
Lots of good food and fun stuff.

467
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,750
Don't eat this.

468
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,310
Come to my place.

469
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,710
Xiaohai, go with Auntie.

470
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,270
Let's go.

471
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,550
Good food and fun stuff, come on.

472
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,640
You don't need to do anything.

473
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,840
I'm almost done here.

474
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,240
Xiaozhou's case still hasn't been solved,

475
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,510
the killer's still out there,

476
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:38,570
and you're in the mood
to do business?

477
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,770
They can all eat and drink as they want.

478
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,710
But Xiaozhou is gone.

479
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,280
She can't eat anything anymore!

480
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:49,430
Xiaozhou has only been gone
for a few days.

481
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:51,810
I just want to stay home quietly
and think about her!

482
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:52,720
Is that too much to ask?

483
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,720
Are we all about to starve to death
or something?

484
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,180
Why are you in such a hurry
to make this money?

485
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:59,190
Shen, what are you doing?

486
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,400
Have you lost your mind?

487
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,790
Yes, I have lost my mind!

488
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,920
It's better to be crazy!

489
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,480
Shen

490
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,640
is just hurting inside.

491
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,790
He'll feel better after letting it out.

492
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:23,550
Thank you. I'll call it a day.

493
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:24,680
Please go back.

494
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,810
-Thank you. Thank you.
-It's alright.

495
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:20,830
When was the last time

496
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,790
you saw Shen Xiaozhou?

497
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,440
The day of her accident.

498
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:27,000
That afternoon,
I offered to give her a ride.

499
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,200
She said no need, so we parted ways.

500
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,720
You wanted
to make your relationship official,

501
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,430
but she refused?

502
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:33,590
I'm not good enough for her.

503
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,650
I have no ambition.

504
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,740
Xiaozhou would never be interested in
someone like me.

505
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,510
It took Shen Xiaozhou

506
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,110
25 to 30 minutes to walk from

507
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,320
the lecture hall to catch a taxi

508
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,720
at the west gate of the university.

509
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,640
At a normal walking pace,

510
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:52,630
it would take at most 10 minutes

511
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,720
from the lecture hall to the west gate.

512
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,110
So what about those extra 15 minutes?

513
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,000
Didn't she have a conversation
with Zhang Haoyang?

514
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,460
He wanted to give her a ride,
but Xiaozhou refused and all that.

515
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:15,400
You could say a lot in 15 minutes.

516
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,830
This is the route from

517
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,300
the lecture hall to the west gate.

518
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,470
Pull up all surveillance footage

519
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,680
from this route after 3 PM

520
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,590

521
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:37,590
There are dozens of cameras.

522
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:38,480
23 cameras.

523
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,310
Why is this tea so bitter?

524
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,720
How much does it cost per catty?

525
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,180
Less than 10 yuan, I guess.

526
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,200
It's cheap.

527
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,800
As long as it keeps me awake.

528
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,240
Got it.

529
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:28,640
This one.

530
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:35,580
[Garden within Southern University
of Science and Technology Campus]

531
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,730
Captain Lian, we found it.

532
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,520
Captain Lian.

533
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
At 4:09 PM on the 19th,

534
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,550
Shen Xiaozhou walked past here,

535
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:26,420
and then disappeared on this road.

536
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,530
At 4:12 PM,

537
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:30,990
Zhang Haoyang's car also passed through
this intersection.

538
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,570
Here's the next video.

539
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,240
Four minutes later,

540
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,510
which is 4:16 PM,

541
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:37,520
Zhang Haoyang's car

542
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,540
passed through this intersection.

543
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:43,270
Shen Xiaozhou got out of
Wu Bo's car halfway.

544
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,460
She was worrying about
how to continue her journey,

545
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:48,180
and that's when
Zhang Haoyang's car appeared.

546
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,900
Could she have gotten into
Zhang Haoyang's car?

547
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,440
You're a man.

548
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,640
-Please go in by yourselves.
-Show some strength and spirit.

549
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,880
You can live a vibrant life,

550
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,840
or a simple and elegant one,

551
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,030
but you can't lose your spirit and energy.

552
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,160
Pull yourself together.

553
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,770
He's even lecturing his son
with parallel sentences now.

554
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:16,450
Wait.

555
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,110
I'll give you the money.

556
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,550
Just do whatever you want.

557
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:21,280
We're here for investigation.

558
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,400
We don't have to wait for him
to finish lecturing, right?

559
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,660
Let's listen for a bit.

560
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,640
It'll help us

561
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,030
get a sense of how they see Zhang Haoyang.

562
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:29,920
Keep going.

563
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,830
I'll clear away any trouble

564
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,500
and smooth out any obstacles on your way.

565
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,000
Stand up straight.

566
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,660
Why are all fathers like this,

567
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:41,310
ignoring what they should take care of
and interfering where they shouldn't?

568
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,400
So dispirited,

569
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,680
like a stray dog!

570
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,860
Can't you show some backbone?

571
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,270
Who are you people?

572
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,290
We're police officers.

573
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,800
There's a case, and we'd like

574
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,410
Zhang Haoyang to come to the station
to assist with the investigation.

575
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:06,400
Why can't you just ask him questions here?

576
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,550
It's a legal summons.

577
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:12,930
Let me confirm this with Chief Li.

578
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,960
There's no Chief Li at our precinct.

579
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,110
I'm talking about the city bureau.

580
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,750
No need. I'll go with you.

581
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,880
Stop right there!

582
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:24,720
Excuse me, Officer.

583
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,830
There's something
I need to inform you about.

584
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,210
Zhang Haoyang has
congenital cerebral vascular stenosis.

585
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:38,590
Please be careful with your wording
when questioning him

586
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:39,920
to avoid agitating him.

587
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,880
If possible,

588
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,130
I'd like to have a doctor

589
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,270
on standby during the questioning.

590
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,070
By all means.

591
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:50,880
We won't be more emotional
with our wording than you are.

592
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,280
We've called you in today

593
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:00,970
to understand the details

594
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,170
of your meeting with Shen Xiaozhou

595
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,830
on the afternoon of June 19th.

596
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,830
I need you to repeat everything
that was said

597
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,000
and how both of you reacted.

598
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,860
Give me the complete account.

599
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,420
Don't leave anything out.

600
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,300
I'll roll the film,

601
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,700
and you do the voiceover.

602
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,200
What did Shen Xiaozhou say to you?

603
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:00,030
Look at you, all fired up.

604
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,490
Did she hurt your pride?

605
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:04,270
Don't tell me it was even harsher
than what your dad said to you.

606
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:06,270
In that case, surely you'd be angry.

607
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,400
No, I wasn't angry.

608
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:12,350
It's just that

609
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,400
I asked Xiaozhou if we could talk about it

610
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:19,880
and start over.

611
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:22,230
But Xiaozhou thought it would be better

612
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:25,830
if we didn't see each other anymore.

613
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,790
I felt pretty desperate

614
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:29,640
and quite agitated.

615
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,570
More like really agitated, right?

616
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:36,160
Getting so worked up
with your cerebrovascular condition.

617
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:39,190
Do you have a death wish or something?

618
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,970
Did Shen Xiaozhou know about
your condition?

619
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:45,550
Yes.

620
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:49,790
Was that why she didn't want
to be with you?

621
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,310
If it weren't for that,

622
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:57,310
she probably would've stopped
talking to me long ago.

623
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:02,070
Was Shen Xiaozhou that important to you?

624
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,480
She was my rock.

625
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:15,110
You also heard what my father said to me.

626
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:17,920
He thinks I'm worthless.

627
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,310
He... He's right.

628
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,880
I can't argue with that.

629
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:24,170
I really don't know
what I want to do with my life.

630
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:28,440
Only Xiaozhou kept encouraging me

631
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,210
to try different paths.

632
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:36,530
Now that Xiaozhou is gone,

633
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:40,750
it doesn't matter which path
I take anymore.

634
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,950
After you parted ways
with Shen Xiaozhou that afternoon,

635
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,800
which route did you take?

636
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,000
What do you mean which route?

637
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,510
The one...

638
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,200
The... The one home, of course.

639
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,110
You took the same route as her.

640
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,790
Were you following her?

641
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,160
H-How could I?

642
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,960
I had no idea where she was going.

643
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,680
Shen Xiaozhou disappeared

644
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,940
right between these two intersections.

645
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,030
Did she get into your car?

646
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,640
No.

647
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:23,790
Are you suggesting
I could have picked her up?

648
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,660
Either he was telling the truth,

649
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,820
or he's a darn good actor.

650
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,160
Do you buy it?

651
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:59,680
Don't make subjective judgments.

652
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,350
Keep him in custody for now.

653
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:02,880
Get a search warrant first.

654
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,420
Search where? His car?

655
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:09,090
His car, residence,

656
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:11,190
office, everywhere.

657
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:25,750
We've got something.

658
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,960
This is from the security camera

659
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,889
at the ATM of China Construction Bank
on Jingwu Road.

660
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,239
Can you confirm it's Sha Hongli?

661
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,880
Well...

662
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,420
It's hard to tell.

663
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:39,840
But

664
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:42,429
we found Sha Hongli's car
outside the bank.

665
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:46,150
Now that he's surfaced, it'll be easier.

666
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:46,960
Cast the net.

667
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,400
Work overtime

668
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:50,739
and find him as quickly as possible.

669
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,840
Let's go arrest him. Move.

670
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,590
We... We have a mission.

671
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,560
Okay, just a moment.

672
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,400
Take his bishop and let him move.

673
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,510
Capture his knight.

674
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:10,910
Just move your advisor
and take his knight.

675
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,190
Don't listen to him.

676
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,710
Moving your bishop is the right move.

677
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:14,510
Listen to me.

678
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,190
Jump again.

679
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:17,720
You'll lose if you listen to him,
you know, Li.

680
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,060
You're here, Tao.

681
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:21,690
Hey, Li.

682
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:22,880
I've got the liquor ready for you.

683
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,000
Ten cases. Is that enough?
I can get more if needed.

684
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,590
That's enough.

685
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,070
It's just a small gathering,
not many tables.

686
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,510
Alright, have a cigarette.

687
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:29,230
Thanks.

688
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:30,230
How's business?

689
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:30,800
Not bad.

690
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,760
Hurry up, you've been thinking forever.

691
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,090
Don't rush, don't rush.

692
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,240
Tao, what happened to your back?

693
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,440
I was moving stuff the other day
and didn't use proper force.

694
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,440
I twisted it a bit.

695
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:51,110
A young man like you twisting your back?

696
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:53,310
How heavy was the stuff you were moving?

697
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,140
By the way, Tao,

698
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,320
I heard your new wife
is a college graduate.

699
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,840
You didn't even finish high school, right?

700
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,500
How did you manage to land her?

701
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:03,710
Tell me about it.

702
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,160
What's the big deal
about college graduates?

703
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,890
Our factory has plenty of them.

704
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:09,710
Uncle Shen.

705
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:24,150
Uncle.

706
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,530
Isn't it a bit early to start drinking?

707
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,670
Tao,

708
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,230
that truck's loaded up.

709
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,670
Why don't you make a delivery run first?

710
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:46,800
Okay, I'll come back later then.

711
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,330
Alright, drive carefully.

712
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:53,150
Uncle, I'll leave now.

713
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,960
Shen. Shen.

714
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,280
Stop drinking and go home.

715
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:18,400
Home?

716
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,150
I've got no home.

717
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:38,880
Li.

718
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:46,080
Shen.

719
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,360
Boss,

720
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:51,030
shave my head clean.

721
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,000
You're drunk.
I don't dare shave your head.

722
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,200
You'll come after me after you sober up.

723
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,510
Shen.

724
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:00,760
-Shen, that's not for hair cutting.
-Don't move!
