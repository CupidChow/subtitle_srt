1
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,520
Fold it for half

2
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,160
Fold it for half and press it

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,480
Click on it

4
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,240
Turn it up

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,480
Shortly, you will become a small boat

6
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,720
Tiny boat

7
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,560
It has become a small boat

8
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,800
When I graduate, let's go on a trip

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:34,920
To where?

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,760
Any place fits

11
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,520
Our family did not go on a journey together before

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,360
Go, go wherever you want

13
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,560
Good

14
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,680
Travel costs money

15
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,400
And you haven't started work yet

16
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,000
Yes, it will cost

17
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,840
Let's spend generously this time

18
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,840
amazing

19
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,840
My brother, we will go on a trip

20
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,000
Journey, where do you want to go?

21
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,000
look at me

22
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,040
What do you think of going to Beijing?

23
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,840
Brother, look at me

24
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:02,840
look at me

25
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,480
The bed

26
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,400
The bed

27
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:06,760
Jing

28
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,120
Jing

29
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,760
Beijing

30
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:10,880
The bed

31
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:11,680
Jing

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,520
Beijing

33
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,560
Beijing

34
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,280
Let's go to Beijing

35
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,320
Giant panda

36
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,720
Well, let's go

37
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,920
Brother, I will go now

38
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,360
Let's pledge

39
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,280
I will return

40
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,600
I will return to school

41
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,920
Did you take the boiled eggs that I attended for you?

42
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,200
It is in my bag, I will go now

43
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,600
Xiao Chu

44
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,080
When will you return?

45
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,240
In twenty

46
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,840
Dad, my mother, my brother

47
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,440
I am going

48
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,320
Li Dada did not say the truth

49
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,040
His first meeting with Shin Xiao Chu

50
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,840
He was supposed to be at Hancao Club

51
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,079
But he deliberately hidden this fact

52
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,200
You have been fulfilled

53
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,760
Hancao Club is owned by the Jin Hai Group

54
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,400
Do you think Lee Dada did not kill Shin Xiao Chu

55
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,320
And that there is another person?

56
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,160
Why does he admit a crime he did not commit?

57
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,440
I don't know

58
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,720
I want to continue the investigation

59
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,840
Since we discovered

60
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,720
Another abnormal aspect of the life of Shin Xiao Chu

61
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,920
We must get to know the details

62
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,120
Lee Dada case

63
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,840
Zhao Hugang will end it

64
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,800
Regarding his confession

65
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,360
Do not tell the Shin Xiao Chu family yet

66
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,560
Lian Hibing

67
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,040
Investigate

68
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,560
I had returned

69
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,960
Did you eat food?

70
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,680
no

71
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,440
Didn't you say that you will take us

72
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,560
For delicious food abroad?

73
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,880
The waves shine for thousands of miles

74
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,280
What place in the Spring River does the moon shine?

75
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,480
Stop joking my father

76
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,800
My mom actually prepared food

77
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,040
We are the two, we finished eating

78
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,000
Moonlight on flowers and forests is like falling snow

79
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,400
Unreliable.

80
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,280
I want to tell you something.

81
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,720
Do you remember what I told you?

82
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,400
What happened in Yun Province twenty years ago?

83
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,880
That girl

84
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,800
I never knew

85
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,280
She has a child.

86
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,480
Do you want to hear?

87
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,320
My favorite professions are the policeman and the doctor

88
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,560
Because they save lives every minute

89
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,240
And each minute

90
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,440
They make this world a better place.

91
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,840
Trust me, you can.

92
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,040
You will be a great policeman.

93
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,800
If a day comes

94
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,400
And I wanted to go alone

95
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,560
Do not ask me why.

96
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,120
Why did you come here?

97
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,160
Do we not continue to investigate?

98
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,640
Wherever you go, I will go with you.

99
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,520
Leader Ving actually agreed.

100
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,920
Do you not have any questions you want to ask me?

101
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,120
No need to ask.

102
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,760
If you think it should be investigated, let's get true.

103
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,920
We still have some time,

104
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,680
Let's go somewhere first.

105
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,760
The dead cannot speak,

106
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,880
Have you thought about this issue?

107
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,200
There are billions of people in the world,

108
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,680
But the only ones

109
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,480
Those who can speak on their behalf,

110
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,160
And help them restore justice,

111
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,640
They are these few officers who are investigating cases.

112
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,600
Sometimes he is only one person,

113
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,560
No one else.

114
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,280
They are

115
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,760
The only bridge between them and justice,

116
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,320
They are their only hope.

117
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,800
So we must catch the right person.

118
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,880
Since I became a policeman and achieved in the first case,

119
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,800
I advise myself with this.

120
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,280
Was it the first issue I faced?

121
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,120
In 1995

122
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,440
In Yun Province?

123
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,960
She is my mother.

124
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,760
I saw your name in the case records.

125
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,520
The records say that you are

126
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,920
You were in an emotional relationship.

127
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,480
On the first summer vacation after accepting at the Police College,

128
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,800
It was surprising and decisive.

129
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,039
After that, I did not hear about it for three years.

130
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,440
Then I graduated,

131
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,120
I was appointed in the provincial office,

132
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,720
When I went back to visit my family,

133
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,840
With your sharp intelligence

134
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,960
Didn't you check my DNA?

135
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,960
I hesitated.

136
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,120
no.

137
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,920
So how did you exclude me?

138
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,160
Did you examine my DNA?

139
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,800
Frankly, I hated you at first.

140
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,360
I thought I was abandoning my mother.

141
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,920
Because you look

142
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,600
A bit cold person.

143
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,440
But then

144
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,200
I got to know you more.

145
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,960
I started to wish you were really.

146
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,080
This is better.

147
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,560
If so,,

148
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,760
I will not be able to be your student.

149
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,760
How did you get to know my mother?

150
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,400
When you are in the second year of high school,

151
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,920
My mother died.

152
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,000
And that year I got to know Yoon van.

153
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,720
The name of your mother Yoon van.

154
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,800
It was in the third year of high school,

155
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,960
It has re -two years.

156
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,000
She did not come to school much.

157
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,520
Every time I saw it,

158
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,920
I thought it was from outside the school and mixed with society.

159
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,400
She did not like to wear school uniforms.

160
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,640
She did not like long hair.

161
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,880
She did not dye her nails.

162
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,880
She liked to ride a bike like boys.

163
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,440
Sitting on the edge of the road and drinking soft drinks,

164
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,880
Mutal skewers eat.

165
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,480
Her personality was completely opposite.

166
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,760
But I loved her at first sight.

167
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,960
Perhaps conservative people

168
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,200
They are more easily attracted to liberated people,

169
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,200
Because they want to become like them.

170
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,800
What surprised me is

171
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,680
She noticed me.

172
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,800
She knew my name.

173
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,000
You also came to watch the sea.

174
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,040
Your name is Lian Hi Ping, right?

175
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,840
I always see you staring at sea,

176
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,880
However, your degrees are excellent.

177
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,560
After we became closer,

178
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,040
Discover

179
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,120
She was not pretending to be intentionally.

180
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,600
Her family's circumstances were very bad.

181
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,080
She did not have a mother,

182
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,760
Her father was spending most of his time playing gambling.

183
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,880
I think it was very angry with this world.

184
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,560
So

185
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,440
She wanted to show herself as

186
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,720
Bad girl.

187
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,440
In fact, this was a kind of self -protection.

188
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,760
When she was with me it was

189
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,560
Very real.

190
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,560
She was also nice.

191
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,400
Police and doctors love,

192
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,120
She means, right?

193
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,400
No one has been interested in me since childhood,

194
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,600
My nature is that I love to raise problems.

195
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,160
You are a good child.

196
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,800
It's okay, criticize me when you should,

197
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,920
Just stay as you were before.

198
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,680
Was this issue difficult to solve?

199
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,760
It was not difficult,

200
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,360
We soon identified the suspect.

201
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,320
It was a person who had been harassing her for years.

202
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,680
It was and tomorrow does not respect the law.

203
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,880
In short, he was doing all the bad things.

204
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,680
He rarely failed to get what he wanted.

205
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,840
But she did not give up.

206
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,040
When pressed, it was able to resist a knife.

207
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Until a day came,

208
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,840
I jumped in the river to escape from him.

209
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,440
Because of my relationship with her,

210
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,240
I could not participate in the investigation.

211
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,640
But I couldn't give up.

212
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,520
I shared a secret

213
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,240
In his arrest.

214
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,320
Also,

215
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,520
I hit the criminal and injured him.

216
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,400
I shouldn't be so reckless.

217
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,240
I should have done better.

218
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,600
I had to find more evidence

219
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,840
To be sentenced to death.

220
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,160
After that, I did not go to the boycott office.

221
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,920
I chose a new job,

222
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,600
It has reached here, it can be considered a kind of disciplinary transport.

223
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,200
I did not imagine that you have this enthusiasm,

224
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,360
And that you may act recklessly.

225
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,200
I wish you saw you hitting someone.

226
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,160
When you have time, come to visit us at home

227
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,080
And meet my wife

228
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,880
And my younger brother also

229
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,920
Yes

230
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,560
It came to us as a guest

231
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,320
A university student wants to earn some money

232
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,240
He is the son of President Zhang

233
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,360
It was presented to us by the late Sayyid Chang Haw Yang

234
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,920
She plays the biba very well

235
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,120
The reaction of the guests was positive

236
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,800
Perhaps for about half a year

237
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,840
Once or twice a month for offers

238
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,520
Was it just offers

239
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,520
Not any other programs were arranged?

240
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,640
Of course not

241
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,840
Just art shows only

242
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,040
We are a high club here

243
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,800
We do not have these suspicious things

244
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,520
Moreover

245
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,760
Play the biba

246
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,760
It is also enhancing our traditional Chinese culture

247
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,680
Isn't it?

248
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,800
Are there surveillance cameras at the show?

249
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,240
No, there is no

250
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,200
Everyone who comes to us are important guests

251
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,360
We have to protect their privacy

252
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,560
This is contrary to the rules

253
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,200
Even the finest clubs are public entertainment places

254
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,400
How do you not ride surveillance cameras?

255
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,560
Surveillance cameras? Yes, we have

256
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,440
There are some in the external courtyard

257
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,720
Can you take us to see the records?

258
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,400
No, this ...

259
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,240
Sir, the officer

260
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,720
I heard that this issue has already been resolved

261
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,720
Is there a necessity?

262
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,040
Is there a necessity

263
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,840
You are the expert or me?

264
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,800
This is the registration of her first experience when she came

265
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:28,920
Look

266
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,640
She was wearing modest clothes

267
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,240
Traditional Chinese clothes

268
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,360
All are upscale arts

269
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,840
Bring all surveillance camera records

270
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,640
Please withdraw for a moment

271
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,000
Good

272
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,680
Well, please watch

273
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,360
Good

274
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,960
What do you want to drink?

275
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:49,880
mineral water

276
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,240
Enjoy your time

277
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,600
decent

278
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,480
It has been kept for three months

279
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,440
Let's see the records of the second of June

280
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,880
I am afraid that we will not find anything

281
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,119
In such places

282
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,880
Bad things happen behind closed doors

283
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,000
Not necessarily, not everyone

284
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,720
They pay attention to the locations of the surveillance cameras

285
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,520
Here she has arrived

286
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,800
It came alone

287
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,240
Here she comes out

288
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,680
She went out less than twenty minutes after she entered.

289
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,560
She did not change her clothes,

290
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,520
It seems that it has not started the show yet.

291
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,080
Twenty -eight minutes.

292
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,160
What is she carried in her hand?

293
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,040
Is it not a money?

294
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,880
What did you do in the car?

295
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,160
This is a Long -hae car.

296
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,200
How do you know Shin Xiao Chu Long He?

297
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,280
Did I have Dada in the car?

298
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,800
There was a driver in the car,

299
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,280
Lee Dada knows how to lead himself.

300
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,320
Looking at their relationship as a father and son,

301
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,840
He will not use this car.

302
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,640
After Shen Xiao Chu left from here,

303
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,320
I went to meet Yang Tao.

304
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,240
According to Liang Tao, her psychological state was very bad,

305
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,240
She also cried.

306
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,000
How many secrets

307
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,240
We do not know it

308
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,520
About Shin Xiao Chu?

309
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,800
Sorry, sorry, sir.

310
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,320
You did not call in advance to tell us,

311
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,000
The Chairman of the Board is not in the company,

312
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,480
You came without interest.

313
00:18:59,160 --> 00:18:59,920
Where is it now?

314
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,200
We can go to it.

315
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,680
Can you tell me what you want first?

316
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,920
I will convey to him the message.

317
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,560
Sorry, this is inappropriate,

318
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,400
Just give me his address.

319
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,240
This is also inappropriate.

320
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,760
What is this talk about appropriate and inappropriate,

321
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,720
We are from the police.

322
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,400
I know that, O officer,

323
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,000
But it is really inappropriate.

324
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,080
My job level is not enough.

325
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,800
Well, ask the manager of your department Chio

326
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,160
To contact the chairman of our board of directors

327
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,480
He asks him personally.

328
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,640
Interesting.

329
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,560
Officer, wait for a moment.

330
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,080
The Chairman of the Board gave personal instructions,

331
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,400
This is his title.

332
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,880
Let's fill fuel first.

333
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,840
Really cool.

334
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,440
They seized all good places,

335
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,080
This place will be demolished sooner or later.

336
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,840
Our Board of Directors.

337
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:45,760
Lean Leader,

338
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,480
I came.

339
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,840
Your son has just been arrested,

340
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,360
And you are here on vacation.

341
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,800
Prefer, tast this.

342
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,320
Green, organic, pollution -free,

343
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,960
I now eat only the vegetables that I cultivate myself.

344
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,840
What kind of compost do you use?

345
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,360
Ruth, right?

346
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,240
O young man,

347
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,560
What do you think that the word organic means?

348
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,280
It is just like my childhood taste.

349
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,120
Since the Chairman of the Board knows that we are coming,

350
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,360
I will speak frankly.

351
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,360
Maybe Dada Shin Xiao Chu was not killed.

352
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,680
Do you know Shin Xiao Chu?

353
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,120
Yes.

354
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,400
Good.

355
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,280
Were you in the car?

356
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,360
Yes.

357
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,680
It was in the car for twenty -eight minutes,

358
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:53,880
What happened during that time?

359
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,160
If the tone of your voice is

360
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,680
A little kind,

361
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,640
I will be more ready to answer.

362
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:07,920
please,

363
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,520
What happened during these twenty -eight minutes?

364
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,880
This question is much better.

365
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,160
A few months ago

366
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,240
Shin Xiao Chu

367
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,840
When she came to the club as a guest

368
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,360
I noticed it immediately.

369
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
From a poor family

370
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,800
With high -end ethics

371
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,280
Beautifully beautiful

372
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,000
It is superior to her studies

373
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,640
This is very rare.

374
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,600
The more you know it

375
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,360
My appreciation for her.

376
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,400
Later I wanted to work in our company.

377
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,320
On that day in the car

378
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,880
I gave her a contract.

379
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,440
I told her

380
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,320
If you only fall on it

381
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,400
It will be done.

382
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,720
The contract.

383
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,840
Unfortunately, I refused.

384
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,600
She said it is not her specialization.

385
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,200
It was preferred

386
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,280
Work in its field of specialization.

387
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,120
By the way

388
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,920
I later invited her to visit

389
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,440
This organic environmental garden.

390
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,160
I wanted to hear her opinion.

391
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,240
These tomatoes gave a five -star rating.

392
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,600
Did you return the contract later?

393
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,440
no.

394
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,520
Without signature and seal, the contract has no value.

395
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,840
So in June

396
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,480
I ask you about the nineteenth of June

397
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,080
Any night of the crime

398
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,920
Do you know where I had Dada

399
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,880
؟

400
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,280
I don't know.

401
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,960
I rarely communicate with him

402
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,960
We are very rarely to meet.

403
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,920
Where were you at that time?

404
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,280
Where were you on the nineteenth of June

405
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,160
Check it to me.

406
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,200
On the evening of the nineteenth of June

407
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,840
I went to the company's headquarters

408
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,360
To meet representatives of the sales office employees

409
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,400
This is a video of that time.

410
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,080
The Jin Hi One project sells well

411
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,600
I went to grant distinguished employees

412
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,080
Their rewards.

413
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,000
Then there was dinner

414
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,400
It was also attended by the Chairman of the Board

415
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,840
And ended at eleven o'clock.

416
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,640
Do you have other questions?

417
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,680
no.

418
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,560
Sorry.

419
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:24,920
I endured all the way

420
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,760
Can I offer your precious place?

421
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,360
A contribution of organic fertilizer?

422
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,560
There is a toilet here

423
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,280
No need.

424
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,120
Inspector Lyan.

425
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,040
I heard about you a while ago

426
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,800
You are one of the best investigators.

427
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,000
I am a person

428
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Heroes always respect

429
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,280
And the police are the heroes of peace time.

430
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,200
This is ashamed of me.

431
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,280
Legitimate

432
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,320
It sells very well.

433
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,400
You can visit it when you find time

434
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,440
And if you like it, tell me.

435
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,360
But we will follow the official procedures

436
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,480
We will not let you make any mistake.

437
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,200
Thank you, Mr. President.

438
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,600
My wife has already gone to see him.

439
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,280
I will definitely go when I find time.

440
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,440
Hey, you.

441
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,560
to stop.

442
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,400
A very strong absence guide

443
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,480
He has a full video of witnesses.

444
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,880
There was a surveillance camera at the entrance to the farm

445
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,080
But it has been removed now

446
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,960
There are still signs on the door

447
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,040
Why was it removed?

448
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,920
For fear of knowing

449
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,240
Who came to the farm

450
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,600
On the nineteenth day

451
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,080
Did Shin Xiao Chu go there?

452
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,000
Not possible

453
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,000
She is dozens of kilometers away

454
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,560
In addition

455
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,160
We don't even know

456
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,400
How Shen Xiao Chu left that street

457
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,480
There is also the contract

458
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,640
We have never seen him

459
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,160
What?

460
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,960
Shin Xiao Chu did not promise me to Lee Long

461
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,600
I did not throw it either

462
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,880
And not in school either

463
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,360
Can it be at home?

464
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,000
We did not pay attention last time

465
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,200
What if it is

466
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,280
It carries it with it on the day of the crime?

467
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,320
Think about it

468
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,200
Why will you carry it with it?

469
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,360
Also, is it really a contract?

470
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,000
What are you looking for?

471
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,560
Did you bring Xiao Chu?

472
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,640
A file in a brown paper envelope

473
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,360
Almost this size?

474
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,840
I have never seen him

475
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,480
Xiao Chu

476
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,800
Xiao Chu

477
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,400
This was used by Xiao Chu before

478
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,360
She did not want to throw it

479
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,200
She left her to Shayo Hai to play with her

480
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,040
She was made by Xiao Chu when she was young

481
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,040
She was afraid that Xiao Hi lost her

482
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,160
Xiao Hi

483
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,320
Can I take one?

484
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,680
Can I take one?

485
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:17,800
Yes, you can

486
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,400
Xiao Hi

487
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,640
Xiao Hi, Xiao Hai

488
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,000
Did Xiao Chu give you this flash Drive?

489
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,480
Xiao Hi

490
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,000
no

491
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,160
Yes

492
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,080
no

493
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,560
no

494
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,720
no

495
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,080
This flash Drive should be sound

496
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,720
Xiao Chu was using it

497
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,240
To save its research when it comes to the computer

498
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,280
It cannot be abandoned

499
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,600
Did Shin Xiao Zhu put it there on herself?

500
00:28:59,200 --> 00:28:59,960
I don't know

501
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,200
television

502
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,120
television

503
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,400
Wicked

504
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,240
theft

505
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,320
Television

506
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,040
He says that there are evil on TV

507
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,400
They stole the flash Drive

508
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,920
Are the bad guys stole the flash Drive?

509
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,600
Yes

510
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,120
Xiao Hi, can you go with us to the police station?

511
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,280
Xiao Hi is ...

512
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,320
We need to take fingerprints

513
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,360
We will go to the police station

514
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,680
To the police station

515
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,680
To the police station

516
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,320
Good

517
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,600
To the police station

518
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,560
Good

519
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,880
Xiao Hi, let your mother go up first.

520
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,240
Xiao Hi, what do you carry, my dear?

521
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,840
To the police station.

522
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,160
Xiao Hi.

523
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,440
Come on, ride the car.

524
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,320
Your head, pay attention to your head.

525
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,360
Leader Lyan.

526
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,080
We have developments in the Xiao Chu case.

527
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:36,800
Leader Lyan.

528
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,520
The four -family fingerprints are on the box.

529
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,120
On this flash memory

530
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,880
There are only Xiao Chu and Hayo Hai fingerprints

531
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,760
There are no fingerprints for anyone else.

532
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,120
Xiao Hi never lies.

533
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,640
If Xiao Chu is not given it

534
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,920
He will not take it.

535
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,440
Open it to see.

536
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,360
Good.

537
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,720
It needs a password.

538
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,920
Can we penetrate it?

539
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,160
It will take time.

540
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:42,080
٠٥٢٦١٨٣٠.

541
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,680
It was opened.

542
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,360
How did you know that?

543
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,040
Xiao Chu.

544
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,280
Xiao Chu.

545
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,320
Do these numbers have any special meaning?

546
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,120
It appears to be

547
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,920
Birth dates of our four family members.

548
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,760
Xiao Hi is the eighteenth day.

549
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,920
Xiao Chu is the thirty day.

550
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,840
Xiao Chu.

551
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,680
Are there any memoirs or records of conversations?

552
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,920
They are only professional materials.

553
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,800
Are there any hidden files?

554
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,640
All files here.

555
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,640
Let's divide it

556
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,440
Let us all search.

557
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,400
Good.

558
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,880
You can return after eating.

559
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,120
Good.

560
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,480
Thanks.

561
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,600
Thanks.

562
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,560
Give me a piece of your tea cake.

563
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,560
How there is no discovery.

564
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,840
I feel like I studied half a specialization in environmental protection

565
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,840
I did not understand anything.

566
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,280
Let's go to sleep first.

567
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,840
permission

568
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,840
We can exclude Le Long from the list of suspects.

569
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,880
We still need to investigate.

570
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,360
The guide not to be at the scene of the accident cannot be refuted.

571
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,800
If he wants to do something, will he do it himself?

572
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,840
The relationship between him and Shin Xiao Chu

573
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,400
Not simple as he claims.

574
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,560
Hi Ping.

575
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,680
With your experience

576
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,120
I should not remind you.

577
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,920
Are you

578
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,520
Emotionally involved in this case too much?

579
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,000
What do you mean?

580
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:15,600
You are constantly looking for

581
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,239
Evidence that Lee Dada did not kill Xiao Chu.

582
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:20,719
If Shin Xiao Chu was already killed by his hands

583
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,719
Don't you should get out of your own logic

584
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,280
And reorganizing ideas again?

585
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,880
Supreme management presses to close the case.

586
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,880
Pressure pressure, but this has nothing to do with it.

587
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,760
Cheo's director can give you more time.

588
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,199
The problem is that we need a deadline

589
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,120
The hospital.

590
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,760
Give me two additional days.

591
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,239
This is detailed recognition

592
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,080
Li Dada made about his killing Lesin Xiao Chu.

593
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,320
Take a look.

594
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,080
The details are mainly identical.

595
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,800
It does not have what I want to know.

596
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,120
What do you want to know?

597
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,640
I want to know

598
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,680
Shin Xiao Chu.

599
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:10,360
On the nineteenth of June

600
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,680
From four in the evening until the time of his death at night

601
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,880
What happened?

602
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,160
Unity

603
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,360
When you have time, check

604
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,640
That flash memory carefully

605
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,560
And see if there is any hidden content

606
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,360
Good

607
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,400
I always feel

608
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,960
That there is something

609
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,840
Otherwise, it would not have arisen

610
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,720
Writing this code

611
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,240
Writing it

612
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,800
Perhaps it was a reserve

613
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,320
To reserve

614
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,440
I left it for us to see it

615
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,480
Should the policeman?

616
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:18,040
To invest his personal feelings in solving issues?

617
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,920
Some old investigators

618
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,560
They never put their personal feelings in the investigations

619
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,120
Not engaging emotionally

620
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,480
It is a kind of psychological self -protection

621
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,360
But can this be controlled?

622
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,080
The more you deepen the investigation

623
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,360
The more emotionally involved

624
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,880
sometimes

625
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:54,040
In the most desperate and dark places

626
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,280
You need this driving force

627
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,520
To push you to continue moving forward

628
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:09,600
What is there?

629
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,880
Have you seen this person before?

630
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,320
no

631
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,000
Thanks

632
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,960
Have you seen this person before?

633
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,080
no

634
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,960
Sir, can you look?

635
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,840
Have you seen this person before?

636
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,520
I have never seen it before

637
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:24,760
Are you sure you did not see it?

638
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,440
sure?

639
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,440
Have you seen this person before?

640
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,280
no

641
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,000
I have never seen it before

642
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,240
my lord

643
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,120
Can you look if you have seen this person?

644
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,480
Have you seen this person before?

645
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,360
No, I have not seen it before

646
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,120
no

647
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,560
no? Look carefully

648
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,400
I have never seen it before

649
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:38,800
Thanks

650
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,720
Come on, to Qian Long One!

651
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,840
Come on, go!

652
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,440
Is there anyone heading to Qian Long One?

653
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,840
Promising to Qian Long One!

654
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,520
Come on, quickly!

655
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,480
We will start as soon as you ride!

656
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,480
quickly!

657
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,080
Come on, heading to Qian Long One!

658
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,520
Are others heading to Qian Long One?

659
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,480
Promising to Qian Long One!

660
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,360
Brother, do you want to ride a car?

661
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,120
O policeman, is this a public bus?

662
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,360
I...

663
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:13,840
Yes...

664
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:14,760
no

665
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,400
Sir, the officer, this is a service to facilitate people's lives

666
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,840
Don't worry, I am not from the traffic police

667
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,760
Do you come with this car every day?

668
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,120
Where do you go?

669
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,680
I...

670
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,120
I am investigating a murder case

671
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,560
Say the truth

672
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,760
That trip to Qian Long One

673
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,640
I do not come every day

674
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,240
I just come once a week

675
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,440
Once a week

676
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,560
No wonder

677
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,600
Yes

678
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,440
It is only to help the villagers and workers of the tourist area

679
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,880
To go to the city to fulfill their needs and shopping

680
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,480
Fifteen yuan for a person, and this is barely enough for the price of fuel

681
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,680
Did you come on the nineteenth of June?

682
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,560
June 10 ...

683
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,280
I, let me check my schedule

684
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,000
The nineteenth of June

685
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,080
nineteenth

686
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,920
Yes, I came

687
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,760
Have you seen this person?

688
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,640
So this is how it disappeared

689
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,080
I really went to search for Lee Long

690
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,080
We need to get a guide

691
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,280
That Shin Xiao Chu went to Lee Long's house

692
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,640
Before we can make sure

693
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,080
Who will go down

694
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,480
Make sure to take your luggage!

695
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,440
Come on, hurry.

696
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:52,960
Hey, beautiful.

697
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,520
I got out of the car here.

698
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,120
Can I go now?

699
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:09,960
Go.

700
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,520
There is still six kilometers until the Lee Long HH farm.

701
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,480
Very far, how did you go there?

702
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,640
Let's ask these.

703
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,160
If someone has less Shen Xiao Chu

704
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,320
They will definitely remember it.

705
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,480
Mr., did you take this person?

706
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,160
He says he does not remember.

707
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,920
Hello, we are from the police.

708
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,160
Have you seen this person?

709
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,200
We did not see it.

710
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:38,960
Look well.

711
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:39,840
Really, we have never seen it.

712
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,240
Mr., did you take this person?

713
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,600
He says he does not remember.

714
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,320
Hello, we are from the police.

715
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,360
Have you seen this person?

716
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,560
He says he did not say it.

717
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,040
O master,

718
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,000
Did you take this person?

719
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,160
I did not say it,

720
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:54,800
I never saw him.

721
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,080
Is there any of you who did not go out in his car today?

722
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,640
Yes, Xiang is like our village did not come today.

723
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,280
How many days have he not come out with his car?

724
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,320
Perhaps three or four days ago.

725
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,200
Do you have a phone number?

726
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,040
Hello, the phone you call closed.

727
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:19,880
The phone is closed.

728
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,280
Can you take us to search for it?

729
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,280
We will pay the car fare.

730
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,440
The police are very polite,

731
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,560
There is no need to pay.

732
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,920
Xiang c.

733
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,720
Xiang c.

734
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,360
Stop roads, no one here.

735
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,720
He left early in the morning a few days ago.

736
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,160
I saw, as I said,

737
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,120
He went to the city.

738
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,800
Have you seen yourself that he left?

739
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,080
I saw the car left.

740
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,440
When he left the sky was still dark.

741
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,360
Also, his car is easy to distinguish,

742
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,000
Transformers drew on the front of the car.

743
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,440
What about his parents?

744
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,640
His parents died a long time ago,

745
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,640
He only has a girlfriend working in the city.

746
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,240
Where do you work in the city?

747
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,160
Xiang Ze said she is working

748
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,760
In a luxurious restaurant that sells seafood.

749
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,520
I heard that foreign crabs are sold for more than a thousand yuan.

750
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,800
I joked him saying

751
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,000
This is not a cancer,

752
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,880
It is like paying travel costs, right?

753
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,200
Why doesn't he go to work in the city with her?

754
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,520
What does he do in the town?

755
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,600
Work in the city is tired,

756
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,080
Our tourist area has become famous,

757
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,520
And earns a lot of driving.

758
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,240
Xiang was planning

759
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,360
He said that he will work for other two years,

760
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,120
Then he will return and marry his girlfriend.

761
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,400
It will open a rural restaurant,

762
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,560
It also sells seafood.

763
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,760
Do we not have a lot of seafood here?

764
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,200
Why do we eat foreigners?

765
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,000
It is supposed to have returned now,

766
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,320
It usually goes for only two or three days.

767
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,720
If Xiang Zz is the one who connects Shen Xiao Chu,

768
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,560
I am afraid that they have already found it.

769
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,280
How did they know about Xiang Z?

770
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,520
Have you forgotten,

771
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,120
There were surveillance cameras at the farm entrance.

772
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,200
And Xiang car is easy to distinguish.

773
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,680
Did Xiang fly because of their threats?

774
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:02,560
We must find it.

775
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,480
You are back.

776
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:24,880
O leader,

777
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,880
I have some new discoveries.

778
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,640
Flash Shen Xiao Chu.

779
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,440
I reviewed it several times,

780
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,840
Most of the academic research papers,

781
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,040
The titles and contents are clearly classified.

782
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,720
But these two files are different,

783
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,640
So I copied them separately.

784
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,840
These two reports speak mainly about

785
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:51,080
Soil pollution in a chemical factory,

786
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:52,880
The titles are unclear,

787
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,920
The content has been deleted parts of it.

788
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:58,040
Someone deliberately deleted the name of the chemical factory

789
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,240
And the name of the Environmental Evaluation Foundation

790
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,160
From files.

791
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,400
But I discovered.

792
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:08,120
Look, isn't this familiar?

793
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:09,840
It is local.

794
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:10,840
Yes.

795
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,080
This chemical factory

796
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,560
It has not been a chemical factory for a long time,

797
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,720
And it is now a residential complex,

798
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:17,760
It's now.

799
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:18,920
Jin Hi number one.

800
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,240
Yes, I also discovered that

801
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,520
The company that made the environmental evaluation of Jane Hi number one

802
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,640
It is Le Qing Environmental Technology.

803
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,040
Le Qing.

804
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,440
The conclusion of these two reports is that

805
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,760
Soil pollution at the chemical factory site

806
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,040
After treatment and reform

807
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,000
It became harmless.

808
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,360
But I feel something incorrect.

809
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,320
I don't understand,

810
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,320
What does this mean?

811
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,240
I also do not understand.

812
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,440
I just feel very suspicious.
