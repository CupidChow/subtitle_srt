THE CONCUBINE

13
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,150
I apologize once again, sir

14
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,820
He is such a reckless lad

15
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,450
Perhaps your son should join us

16
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,460
. No, sir! .
He IS not my son, Sir

17
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:53,670
He once saved .my.life at war,
so I took him In like a son

18
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,960
You ruined the prince's hunt!

19
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,090
- Let's go!
- How scary!

20
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:03,470
- The prince is but a thief!
- How dare you!

21
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,060
Fool!

22
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,730
Let him go at once!

23
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,600
What have I done wrong?

24
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,110
There is an order
to catching deer, too?

25
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,110
How dare you!

26
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,490
Lock him away at once!

27
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,860
- Yes, sir!
- Kwon-yoo?

28
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:41,880
I apologize for the disturbance,
Your Highness

29
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,010
Please forgive me

30
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,730
Wait until the guest has left

31
00:03:58,650 --> 00:03:59,360
Why?

32
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,410
What worries you so?

33
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,410
Don't worry

34
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,130
I do not hear you reading
these days

35
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:25,890
Just rumors of you wandering out
in mad hunting

36
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:32,230
To not fall weak, men not only
study but hunt and...

37
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,780
That is not what I meant

38
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:44,780
Why do you frequent
Deputy-Minister Shin's house?

39
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,910
Because of his daughter?

40
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:56,040
A mere deputy-minister's girl?

41
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,550
I've never felt
this way before

42
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:08,390
The court is always critical of
the king's half brother

43
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,930
Stay away from her

44
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:18,560
It is only right that
I visit you often, stepmother

45
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,570
You still call me stepmother, sire?

46
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:26,320
I fret you come
to keep watch on me

47
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,700
Of course not

48
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,450
With no son and.
not even a concubine

49
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,290
They say I'm stopping you
with ulterior motives

50
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:46,680
It is only because
I feel sorry to my late queen

51
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:52,810
Though I am a stepmother,
I have my courtly duties

52
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:03,990
Then, please find
a new queen for me

53
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,320
I shall see to it immediately

54
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:13,740
Who is it?

55
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:22,210
Sir! Come in!

56
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,220
Your Highness!

57
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:35,520
How could you
do this to me?

58
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,900
Sir! It is late
Let us go in and talk

59
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:45,530
Did you not promise me?

60
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:52,780
Yes, but how could I go against
the court's orders, sir?

61
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,540
Why?
Does she not fancy me?

62
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,120
- Let's go in, sir!
- Call your daughter out!

63
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,920
Let's go inside

64
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:06,550
I must talk with her!
Where is she?

65
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:37,290
Since you went against the court,
you must run for life

66
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,580
I'm not going anywhere alone

67
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:47,420
But there's nothing
I can do for you

68
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,680
Just stay with me

69
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,580
Kwonyoo!

70
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:10,550
Kwonyoo!

71
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,210
Escort her away!

72
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,840
Kwonyoo!

73
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,300
No!

74
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,350
' ' No!
Hwayeon!

75
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,220
Let go!

76
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:24,690
- Kwonyoo!
- Hwayeon!

77
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,230
No!

78
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:42,830
No, Father!

79
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:45,750
I suggested we run away
Kwonyoo IS Innocent!

80
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:52,380
If this gets known,
we'll all die including him

81
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,960
Please let him go

82
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,260
It's too late

83
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,260
- Guards!
- Yes, SH'!

84
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,010
I'll go in the palace!

85
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,640
If Kwonyoo dies, so will I!

86
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:12,900
Let go!

87
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,030
What have you done to her!

88
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:20,030
Hwayeon!

89
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,900
I will do it

90
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,780
There are rules and steps
to bathing, too

91
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,160
I have no right
to my own body?

92
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,920
5 YEARS LATER

93
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,800
Your Majesty
Prince Sung-won is here

94
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:24,600
It's been so long
How've you been, brother?

95
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:29,060
Just roaming
here and there, sire

96
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:40,950
I'm ashamed to see you
so weak and pale, sure

97
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:48,450
I feel much better
seeing you

98
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,630
How are things outside?

99
00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:02,130
The grain and crops have
fully ripened, sire

100
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:07,890
Your people are making spirits
with Chrysanthemums

101
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:29,620
Recently, he's been ill
quite often

102
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:35,250
I'm afraid the court physician
does not know why

103
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:42,170
He'll regain his health soon
Don't fret, Your Majesty

104
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,930
You left so suddenly
I was worried

105
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,390
You worried about me?

106
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,570
How foolish of me
to worry you both

107
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:04,820
I'm glad you've returned safely

108
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,700
I came upon hearing
His Majesty's ill

109
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,540
I shall leave when he recovers

110
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:21,300
It'd be a burden on you and
my nephew for me to stay

111
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,720
What burden?
His Majesty welcomes you so

112
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:44,240
I've taken up too much of
your time, Your Majesty

113
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:10,890
His Majesty appears
blue and lifeless

114
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:15,350
Someone is deliberately trying
to assassinate him

115
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:20,650
- Assassinate? How dare you?
- Sirs! Let's calm down

116
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,110
Let's listen to the court
physician

117
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:32,370
He's grown weak from boils
and can't eat well

118
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,370
Perhaps it's the food!

119
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:39,790
If so, we must interrogate
the royal kitchen matron!

120
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,050
That's preposterous

121
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:47,670
We can always do that after
His Majesty recovers

122
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,430
What do you mean?

123
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:53,640
We must get to the truth
behind His Majesty's illness

124
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:03,020
His Majesty's state is critical

125
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,320
Please come another day

126
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,940
What do you mean?

127
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,070
I am His Majesty's mother!

128
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,200
Step aside

129
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:10,820
Your Majesty!

130
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,290
Why do you keep me from
meeting my ailing son!

131
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,710
I must see how he is at once!

132
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:26,420
His Majesty must rest now
Ask her to go for today

133
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:31,300
Is the queen implying that
I'd interfere in his health?

134
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,720
- My acupuncture set! Hurry!
- Yes, sir

135
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,120
He isn't breathing!

136
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:58,120
Don't just watch!
Do something!

137
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,140
This is a vital spot

138
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:44,290
- Please appoint your successor!
- Please, Your Majesty!

139
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,120
Your Majesty!

140
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,660
Your Majesty!

141
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:29,920
Your Majesty!

142
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:44,060
Your Majesty!

143
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,570
Farewell, My King!

144
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,200
Farewell, My King!

145
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,920
Farewell, My King!

146
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,590
Well done, Minister Yoon

147
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,170
But the prince and queen
are still alive

148
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:21,600
The queen's father also
has many followers

149
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:35,440
How hard can a woman
and her child be?

150
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,620
Without the Left-State Minister
and her father, she won't last

151
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:56,260
We must push ahead
before the Queen Mother

152
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,640
She has the power
to appoint the next king

153
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,970
They are not to be messed with

154
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:09,140
If you're ousted here,

155
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:12,110
you and the prince will be in danger

156
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:14,520
By the way

157
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,650
This is the royal kitchen's log

158
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:22,280
There's nothing around the day of
the king's sudden illness

159
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,740
That means...

160
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:28,620
Yes. The matron who records
the log is also missing

161
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:34,420
She must be hidden away
somewhere inside the palace

162
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:36,760
Inside here?

163
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,630
Yes

164
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:43,760
We must find her and prove
His Majesty was assassinated

165
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:51,560
With proof, I can gather up forces
with some ministers

166
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,940
How dare you!

167
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,150
They're conspirators of
high treason!

168
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,690
- Seize them!
- Yes, sir!

169
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,280
High treason?

170
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,320
Why you!

171
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,830
Have you no fear of heaven!

172
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:10,040
There is a new heaven now!

173
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,330
The queen's father
is charged with treason!

174
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,830
What?

175
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,710
The Queen Mother has ordered
his arrest for treason

176
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:19,970
Fools!

177
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,800
How dare you!
Go away at once!

178
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:25,970
Over there!

179
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:29,470
Stop!

180
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,480
Fools!

181
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:51,370
This color was made
with red sage in lye

182
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,870
It must be soaked
hundreds of times

183
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,840
to get this bright,
blood-like color

184
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,880
It absorbs all other colors
to shine even brighter

185
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,010
It's the king's color

186
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,890
Your Majesty!

187
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:37,040
It's not our duty to take part
in the court's affairs

188
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,920
We look after
His Majesty's necessities

189
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:44,670
We maintain the court's order
and customs

190
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:48,260
We are invisible hands
that keep the palace running

191
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:54,430
We exist only for His Majesty
and the royal court

192
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:59,940
You must all remember
and never forget that

193
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:01,440
Yes, Sir!

194
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:05,150
It hasn't been long since
His Majesty's been crowned

195
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:09,030
Thus, the court eunuchs will also
stand guard for a while

196
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:11,950
If you fall,
His Majesty is at risk!

197
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,830
Stand and fight!

198
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:16,040
Stand and fight!

199
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,210
Who is that lad?

200
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:20,670
Minister Yoon recommended him

201
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:25,170
Minister Yoon?
He'll be the new power here

202
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:25,970
What do you mean?

203
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,930
Don't feign innocence

204
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:35,680
You're safe for now,
but anything can happen

205
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:41,310
If you want to stay here long,
stay close to him

206
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:44,360
Worried about your post?

207
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,990
You must be getting old

208
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,360
What's more important
than that?

209
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,070
I almost lost my life last time

210
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:57,000
I trust you'll keep
watching over me

211
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:19,850
Your Majesty

212
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:24,230
Lie to the left of the queen

213
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,030
Your Majesty

214
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,660
Lie over her with your heart
to the left

215
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:45,630
Lick and suckle her lips.
then swallow her saliva, sire

216
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:53,430
Softly rub her lower stomach

217
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,560
Then, caress down farther

218
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:06,440
Wait until her breasts harden,
then grasp them firmly, sire

219
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,150
Your Majesty

220
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,570
Begin intercourse, sire

221
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:19,330
The queen must grab his waist

222
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:22,960
and accept his royal penis

223
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:28,460
I am ready, sire
Let it in

224
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,820
Go slowly, sire

225
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,130
Next is the anal position

226
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:37,870
Not yet, sire!

227
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:43,540
You must ejaculate later
to impregnate a son

228
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,420
Please return to
your chambers, sire

229
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:36,720
If the Queen Mother knew...

230
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:43,720
What happened?

231
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:47,190
I couldn't say a word
in the royal kitchen

232
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:50,860
The maids run away
when they see me

233
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,860
We must find
the royal kitchen matron

234
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,370
Your Highness?

235
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,460
You found something?
Tell me

236
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:15,590
Well, if she is still alive...

237
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:22,640
I once heard the eunuchs
whispering

238
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:28,770
Past the Queen Mother's court
and the laundry place

239
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,150
I heard there is a secret
pathway underground

240
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:39,780
No sunlight can get through,
But it snows all day there

241
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:49,040
And only the Queen Mother's
private soldiers know of it

242
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,120
You wretch!

243
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:57,170
Greet the late king's concubine
at once!

244
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:00,300
How dare you?

245
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,680
Bring me a table
of food and wine!

246
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:10,940
His Majesty will come
any moment

247
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,400
What's taking so long?

248
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:21,820
Why'd you come out?
Let's return to your room

249
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:25,450
Let's put some makeup on
and change your clothes

250
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,580
Why sure

251
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:57,860
Your Highness!

252
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:00,360
Your Highness!

253
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:01,860
Your Highness!

254
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:04,860
Please get me out of here

255
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:08,700
I just did as I was told

256
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,580
Calm down

257
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,330
And take a look at this

258
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:21,130
Did you write this?

259
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,010
Yes, Your Highness

260
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:26,890
But

261
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:30,520
Do you remember what
His Majesty ate that day?

262
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:36,650
He had lunch at
the Queen Mother's court

263
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,520
The Queen Mother?

264
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:48,780
She suddenly called His Majesty
and ordered us not to prepare lunch

265
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:55,370
Why? Is it not to your liking?

266
00:29:55,370 --> 00:30:00,300
It's because I have indigestion

267
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:04,170
Afraid it's poisoned, sire?

268
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:06,680
Of course not

269
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:12,180
They say you are ill
because I'm poisoning you

270
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:19,440
Then, he had diarrhea
all night

271
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:37,960
You two dare defile
the palace order?

272
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:42,300
Make sure they never forget
their sins!

273
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:54,350
Cut off the atrocious
fool's penis!

274
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:59,060
Remove her womb
and sew her genitals!

275
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:01,730
Show them the strict
order of the court!

276
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:02,980
Yes, ma'am!

277
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,370
You have such soft hands

278
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,120
I know, sir

279
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:36,020
Your Majesty

280
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,640
Who are you?

281
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:43,230
Please kill me.
I mean, no!

282
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,900
I asked who you are

283
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,650
I deserve to die

284
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:53,240
She is Her Highness' maid
from home

285
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:03,130
Please forgive me, sire

286
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,950
What brings you to this
humble sire?

287
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:42,210
I haven't visited since
you moved to this place

288
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:49,460
Where did you go at night
with no guards?

289
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:54,590
My father is locked up
How could I just sit and wait?

290
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:56,680
I apologize

291
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,480
I've been too busy with things

292
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,810
You must be devastated

293
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:09,820
I shall see to
your father's release

294
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:14,320
I cannot be a burden
on you, sure

295
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:21,370
I am just grateful
to be alive

296
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,590
It must be uncomfortable
in this old place

297
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,510
Chief Eunuch!

298
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,270
Furnish this place suited
to Her Highness

299
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:48,650
That is under jurisdiction
of the Queen Mother, sire

300
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,020
What?

301
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,280
It's her jurisdiction?

302
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,660
So, you won't follow
the king's order?

303
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:09,790
Your Highness!
Look at this!

304
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:16,550
His Majesty sent
such nice things

305
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,470
This way!

306
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:25,480
Embankment work on Nakdong River
damaged tributary

307
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,980
The peasant shares in great harm

308
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:34,490
With the rainy season
320 homes were lost

309
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:39,240
And over 200 people
went missing

310
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:42,740
Apart from what's required,
reduce the taxes

311
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:45,580
Order all district magistrates

312
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:50,210
to send soldiers to help the people

313
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:56,470
Next is a list of pardoned sinners
in honor of the coronation

314
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,350
Excluding murders
and high treason

315
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:06,600
280 sinners in the capital
and 137 elsewhere were...

316
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,230
Do you people not see me?

317
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,900
Why don't you submit
reports to me?

318
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:16,900
While His Majesty learns affairs,
the Queen Mother is...

319
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:21,410
Does it look like I'm learning
by just sitting here?

320
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:27,040
From now on, prepare reports
for him to see as well

321
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:29,170
Continue

322
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,630
Is the queen's father
on the list?

323
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:50,270
Have you lost your mind?

324
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,570
Do you not know for whom
they are being purged?

325
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,700
The former queen's father
has many followers

326
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:07,580
I fret it'll perturb
the people

327
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,210
You kept watch on me?

328
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:16,800
Though you act as regent,
I am still the king

329
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,840
You're not ready

330
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:23,590
Mentioning personal feelings
at court is no king!

331
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:28,850
Forgotten how we made it here?

332
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:34,810
If we don't nip the bud,
we could get hurt again

333
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:41,490
We almost died when your court
was on fire

334
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:45,700
I've never once forgotten that

335
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:49,620
Please stop mentioning that

336
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:55,080
Every woman in the palace
IS yours, but one!

337
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,340
You can never touch
that woman

338
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,640
Bring all the eunuchs
at the former queen's court!

339
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,140
What have I done wrong?

340
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,270
I did all you wanted,
Mother

341
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,770
I accepted her as
sister-In-law

342
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:15,900
And became the king
as you wished!

343
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,900
What more do you want from me?

344
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,510
If the bee will not shoo away

345
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,550
the flower will be cut off

346
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:57,650
Get me a drink

347
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:26,720
Hwayeon!

348
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:36,230
Hwayeon!

349
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,110
I took you in
like my own son

350
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,360
How dare you covet
my daughter!

351
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,190
Hwayeon!

352
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:51,370
Remember why I let you live
And never come to us again

353
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:52,620
- Guards!
- Yes, SH'!

354
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:56,870
- Castrate him at once!
- Yes, sir!

355
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,030
Kwonyoo?
How did you come here?

356
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,290
I thought you were dead

357
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:45,880
No. I prayed every moment
for you to be alive

358
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:47,920
Kwonyoo

359
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:54,640
I'm so.glad to see you
alive and well

360
00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:01,060
Kwonyoo died back then, madam

361
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,070
What do you mean?
Please help me

362
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:10,280
I have no clue
what is happening

363
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,530
I found evidence
the king's been murdered

364
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:18,040
Please, go back

365
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:24,540
Do you not know
I'm Minister Yoon's man?

366
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,090
What do you mean?

367
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:40,060
You're the only one
I have in the palace

368
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,230
Kwonyoo

369
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,230
How could you?

370
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:54,490
How could I be of any help now?

371
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:01,370
What more do you want in life?

372
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:10,880
If you want to live,
run away alone

373
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,260
Alone again

374
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:19,350
Like before

375
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:24,100
Run by yourself

376
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,360
No visitors are allowed

377
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:36,160
Still, Her Highness is here

378
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,240
Just for a moment?

379
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,790
I could lose my head
I'm sorry

380
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:49,420
Could you at least give this
to my elderly father?

381
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:51,630
It's rice gruel

382
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:21,410
Your daughter sent this

383
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,300
You?

384
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,340
How did you come here?

385
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:44,930
Such a dangerous act

386
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:51,820
My daughter is innocent

387
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:59,490
I heard what happened
from the royal kitchen matron

388
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:01,700
Who should I tell this to?

389
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:08,370
Look. I'll die for my sin
But not her!

390
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:17,840
You should've killed me
back then

391
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:29,730
Stop! Come back!

392
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,740
How is the former queen?

393
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:42,370
She is well, Your Majesty

394
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:49,370
Visit her day and night
to make sure she's well

395
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:52,630
Yes, sire

396
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:55,550
How dare you?

397
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:59,300
Persimmon is harmful to
His Majesty's boils

398
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,260
What is your name?

399
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:04,300
Chongqing, sire

400
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:06,430
How'd you know
I have boils?

401
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:11,310
I knew from how you hesitated
leaning against your back

402
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:15,650
Tell me, how can boils
be subdued?

403
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:22,030
Sweat and chills can cause
boils to form easily, sure

404
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:26,080
It is best to avoid
raw or cold foods

405
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,040
You seem familiar

406
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:29,960
Have we met before?

407
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,090
No, sire. How can a lowly man
meet His Majesty?

408
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:41,550
I like this lad
Promote him as senior eunuch

409
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:43,720
Your Majesty

410
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:48,720
To become a senior,
one must work over 16 years

411
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,940
It took him over 20 years
to reach that post to be here

412
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:56,360
- This man came in recently
- What?

413
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,690
Can't I do as I wish
even with a eunuch?

414
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,360
Why?

415
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:05,370
Do you only follow
the Queen Mother, too?

416
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:08,120
As you wish, sire

417
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:27,260
What brings Your Highness
here this late?

418
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,890
Is it this?

419
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:32,270
Kwonyoo

420
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,480
They will be beheaded at dawn

421
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:39,360
Why make the effort?

422
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:44,530
The poor kitchen matron
died because of you

423
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:52,790
Madam? What is it?

424
00:45:53,540 --> 00:46:00,170
I must watch my father die
for we couldn't die with the king

425
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:03,760
Please kill us first, sire

426
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,930
Beheading the former
queen's father is too harsh

427
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:11,560
Please take back the order

428
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:14,940
The court has already decided

429
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:19,560
Please save her father!

430
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,440
I will do whatever you want

431
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,570
I will no longer seek her!

432
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:30,950
Loyal ministers wish this
to stabilize your reign!

433
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:34,080
No further discussion

434
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:41,090
Who do you speak of?

435
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:46,800
The relatives on your side
who all hold posts?

436
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:59,230
She must suffer so because
the late king didn't kill us?

437
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:00,980
Watch what you say!

438
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:05,490
Am I this nation's king at all?

439
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:13,450
Not this time
It won't be as you wish

440
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,370
Sire!

441
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:18,210
- Chief Eunuch?
- Yes, sire

442
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:21,710
Run and stop the execution

443
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:27,880
Changing the Queen Mother's
order will...

444
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:36,350
Then, you go!

445
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:43,150
No judgments
That is not up to us

446
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:02,040
All hear His Majesty's command!

447
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:07,170
Shin Ik-Chul and his men
have plotted high treason

448
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:10,510
And endangered the court

449
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:16,260
By law, their entire family
must die and...

450
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,810
Wretched fool!

451
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:25,320
You poisoned the late king
to death!

452
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:27,650
Off with his head!

453
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:56,220
Step aside!

454
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:59,350
I must speak with her!

455
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:00,180
Your Majesty

456
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,100
Sire!

457
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:04,100
Please calm down

458
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:05,360
Why you!

459
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:51,530
Perhaps it's best
to go, sire

460
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:06,790
There. Checkmate

461
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:08,750
Let me see

462
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:12,050
Oh no. Take back
just one move?

463
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:15,510
Again?
Nothing comes for free

464
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:19,300
I have nothing but my balls
Want that?

465
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:23,770
Testicles? Why sure!
I've been dying for them

466
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:24,810
I'll take back 10 moves!

467
00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:32,030
. Why look like
you Just stepped In dung?

468
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:34,650
How is the game?

469
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:37,280
I always win, but it's not fun

470
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:41,080
Why? Trouble in the court?

471
00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:46,080
30 years here, I thought
I knew it inside out

472
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:50,840
But I'm still not sure of
what is right or wrong

473
00:50:51,710 --> 00:50:52,840
Why you

474
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:57,430
It's hard to tell who is right
because everyone is right

475
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:07,060
When I cut off my balls to come here
I sealed off reasoning, too

476
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:12,230
It's not about right or wrong
Just having power or not here

477
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:13,820
Wait

478
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:17,610
Did I just say that?
Not bad, aren't I?

479
00:51:17,610 --> 00:51:19,490
Yes. Indeed

480
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:25,330
What would you have become
instead of a eunuch?

481
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:31,130
Just leading a happy life
with a wife and kids

482
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:35,510
Forget it

483
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:40,010
Unless we die,
we can't ever leave here

484
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,770
You fool!

485
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:50,100
Testing to see if my eyes
will pop out or not?

486
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:53,770
I can't stand him!

487
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,740
KING

488
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:05,490
It is obvious for whom
they plotted treason

489
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:10,870
Depose the former queen
and banish her and her son

490
00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:13,040
Your Majesty

491
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:20,300
Please punish the former queen
to avoid any future harm

492
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:25,180
Our king isn't coming again?

493
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:29,560
Your Majesty
Please give the order

494
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:32,690
Please give the order!

495
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:37,570
Find reason against her
to persuade the king first!

496
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,320
Dismissed

497
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:44,820
Your Majesty

498
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:50,410
Please depose and banish them

499
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:57,590
Call the Chief Minister

500
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:01,680
Why not look at me?

501
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:09,970
I am embarrassed to see you
without your proper robes, sure

502
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:13,600
This is embarrassing?

503
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:18,860
You who clearly show ulterior
motives IS far more shameless

504
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:24,320
I'll ask one thing

505
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,990
What trait is most important
to be king?

506
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:32,330
Showing virtue
with humanity, sire

507
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:36,080
Then, what is the root of
humanity?

508
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:42,010
Compassion, sire

509
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:45,140
ls banishing a widow
compassion?

510
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:50,390
- Is that a virtuous deed?
- But, sire

511
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:54,390
You can kill us all,
but think of the court and...

512
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:55,900
Old fool!

513
00:53:56,730 --> 00:54:01,360
Do you think the Queen Mother's
regency will last forever?

514
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:06,530
Take the others and go
Or you'll get your wish to die!

515
00:54:08,530 --> 00:54:09,990
Go away at once!

516
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:42,440
His Majesty has arrived

517
00:54:46,570 --> 00:54:47,200
Stay here

518
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:51,910
Please return
during the day, sire

519
00:54:53,450 --> 00:54:54,700
I heard you are ill

520
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:59,420
With my father's head up
on the street, how can I be well?

521
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,590
Is that why you avoid me so?

522
00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:12,720
Do you know what is happening
in the court?

523
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,680
I know very well, sire

524
00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:21,230
Those dying to banish me
will be avid to find you here

525
00:55:21,230 --> 00:55:21,730
So please

526
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:27,240
Do not come for me again

527
00:55:28,490 --> 00:55:29,950
How can you be so cruel?

528
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:36,000
Why do you think I endure
being on the throne? For what?

529
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:39,250
Why put me in such misery?

530
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,500
Yell at me instead

531
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:49,630
For stealing my nephew's seat
and letting your father die!

532
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:52,260
Say you are angry!
Say it!

533
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:03,520
What is your name?

534
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:06,650
It's Ge um-ok, Your Majesty

535
00:56:08,030 --> 00:56:11,240
Why? Will you take her
to your chambers?

536
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:16,240
Why not, madam

537
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:24,500
Please don't do this!

538
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:28,300
Don't let me go!
I don't want to!

539
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:29,510
Let's go!

540
00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:33,800
Your Highness!

541
00:56:34,550 --> 00:56:41,940
Please! I don't want to go!

542
00:56:45,150 --> 00:56:47,940
Everything happened
as you wished

543
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:52,200
Are you happy to get
your revenge!

544
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:56,910
I thought

545
00:56:58,950 --> 00:57:01,080
you came into the palace
for me

546
00:57:05,790 --> 00:57:06,840
Now what?

547
00:57:09,590 --> 00:57:11,220
What do I do?

548
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:13,970
If you want to live

549
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,220
If you want to leave
the palace

550
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:20,430
I shall find a way

551
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:25,480
Why? Am I next?

552
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:28,360
Do you know
where I just came from?

553
00:57:29,610 --> 00:57:33,240
I saw your father's head
hung in the street

554
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:03,890
Does she resent me greatly?

555
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,400
She is torn by the loss

556
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:11,860
She cannot eat

557
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,660
She is devastated

558
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:20,410
Go on

559
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,910
How does she look
before sleeping?

560
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:26,000
Pardon?

561
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:34,760
Well, she changes her clothes

562
00:58:39,010 --> 00:58:40,300
She unties her hair

563
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:47,440
And sleeps in a white dress

564
00:58:49,190 --> 00:58:51,320
Who undresses her?

565
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:54,190
I do, sire

566
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:57,320
How do you undress her?

567
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:04,450
Well, I untie the breast-tie

568
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:09,080
- Do you bathe her, too?
- Yes, sire

569
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:11,090
How do you bathe her?

570
00:59:11,090 --> 00:59:17,680
She goes into
a scented hot tub

571
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:19,340
Where do you wash her first?

572
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:27,230
With a fine cloth
I wash her breasts and shoulders

573
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:30,230
Is she soft?

574
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:34,440
Yes, she is so soft and white

575
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:35,940
Go on

576
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:39,860
When she gets up,
I wash between her legs

577
01:00:36,130 --> 01:00:37,130
Your Majesty

578
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,380
This is your new room, madam

579
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:06,720
You've gained His Majesty's favor,
but have yet to be a concubine

580
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:11,390
Please mind your conduct and
do not wander from this room

581
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:13,850
Yes, ma'am

582
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:19,020
I see

583
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:24,650
She will be your maid

584
01:02:25,530 --> 01:02:26,780
Madam

585
01:02:30,370 --> 01:02:32,290
Is there anything you need?

586
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,790
- No. You may go
- Yes, ma'am

587
01:02:59,020 --> 01:03:00,190
Go away at once!

588
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:04,320
Servants!

589
01:03:08,070 --> 01:03:13,160
Thank you, Your Majesty

590
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,790
Oh, Your Majesty

591
01:04:27,650 --> 01:04:28,860
Geum-ok!

592
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:35,120
Having fun, sir?

593
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:57,640
What a strange world

594
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:01,440
I became a royal concubine

595
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:06,270
And you became a eunuch
Interesting, isn't it?

596
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:09,320
His Majesty is here

597
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:15,530
We're just in time

598
01:05:17,450 --> 01:05:19,450
They are not to be disturbed

599
01:05:23,290 --> 01:05:25,330
You became a senior eunuch?

600
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:30,670
Will you help in His Majesty
coming to my court?

601
01:05:32,590 --> 01:05:35,220
Remember our ties
from outside the palace?

602
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:38,810
I've forgotten all
that happened outside

603
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:43,850
You must help me
to keep your secrets

604
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:47,610
You've gone high enough

605
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:52,860
Watch your tongue to avoid
bringing harm upon yourself

606
01:05:57,740 --> 01:05:59,240
Your Majesty

607
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:05,000
How I upset you not knowing
the great pains I've caused

608
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:07,960
No, madam

609
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:15,130
I, too, have been upset over
what happened to your father

610
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:22,890
What harm does the Queen Mother
think my son and I could be?

611
01:06:24,350 --> 01:06:25,390
Madam

612
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:40,160
Forgive me about your father

613
01:06:45,290 --> 01:06:48,000
How could I blame you, sire?

614
01:06:49,290 --> 01:06:52,050
I must not be fit to be king

615
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:56,430
What do you mean, sire?

616
01:06:58,510 --> 01:07:04,060
The late king always said
you had the wisdom and morals

617
01:07:06,810 --> 01:07:09,060
Why the Queen Mother's regency?

618
01:07:10,310 --> 01:07:14,690
What a shame and a pity

619
01:07:17,530 --> 01:07:21,330
It's time you gave orders
to depose them, Your Majesty

620
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:29,460
Deposing her is not
the only way

621
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:30,670
Pardon?

622
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:36,470
Who would seek the truth
if she fell prey to a mishap?

623
01:07:38,050 --> 01:07:40,340
Don't mind her

624
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:43,930
She's survived in the palace
for over 30 years

625
01:07:44,850 --> 01:07:47,350
Do you know why
she has but one ear?

626
01:07:49,810 --> 01:07:52,440
She heard something
she should not

627
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:05,950
She is wise
She knows to go along with the tide

628
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:11,130
He visited the former queen?

629
01:08:18,510 --> 01:08:22,300
Do you know anything
about poison?

630
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:28,350
I once saw poisonous aconite
while with ginseng diggers

631
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:51,460
- Having this inside the palace...
- Means trouble

632
01:08:52,210 --> 01:08:56,590
But to those who don't know,
it's just a rock

633
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:04,090
Know how to make poison
with that?

634
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:09,770
- By burning it, sir
- Then, make it

635
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:17,230
If the mother and son won't leave,
there's only one way out of here

636
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:42,420
You deal with where
His Majesty sleeps?

637
01:09:43,050 --> 01:09:44,510
Me?

638
01:09:46,050 --> 01:09:47,550
I wouldn't dare

639
01:09:48,010 --> 01:09:52,060
Could you lead him to me
on the 3rd?

640
01:09:52,690 --> 01:09:55,690
- Please, madam
- Who knows?

641
01:09:55,690 --> 01:09:58,690
If I give birth to a prince,
you'll be the chief eunuch

642
01:10:09,910 --> 01:10:13,910
No use for the libido
I get from eating frogs

643
01:10:14,330 --> 01:10:15,210
Excuse me

644
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:23,720
30 years here, I can tell
why you came

645
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:26,220
Let's see if you're fit
to bear a son

646
01:10:27,090 --> 01:10:30,060
Just examining
Don't get excited

647
01:10:35,230 --> 01:10:38,730
- I need something that works well
- Sure

648
01:10:41,730 --> 01:10:44,610
- Got different sized breasts?
- No!

649
01:10:44,610 --> 01:10:48,870
Your medicine depends on that
It'll be harder to have sons

650
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:54,250
- They're different, right?
- No

651
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:56,250
Let me take a look

652
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:01,840
I'll have to feel them
to be sure

653
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:04,510
They're the same!

654
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:06,260
That's good

655
01:11:07,590 --> 01:11:09,640
This'll go in

656
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:12,010
Is this for a son?

657
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:16,520
Turn a girl into a boy
before birth

658
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:21,900
Decoct it and drink it
the day before

659
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:23,480
The day before

660
01:11:28,410 --> 01:11:29,280
Wait

661
01:11:30,530 --> 01:11:34,410
This is the son
She took the daughter

662
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:37,370
People are so cunning

663
01:11:38,290 --> 01:11:41,920
When you go up,
you don't want to get down

664
01:11:43,130 --> 01:11:44,130
Right, Your Highness?

665
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:48,880
With His Majesty's favor,
who says I can't become a queen?

666
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,430
How dare you!

667
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:52,890
Watch your words, madam

668
01:11:53,890 --> 01:11:56,680
You dare tell me what to do?

669
01:12:01,690 --> 01:12:04,690
With the king's favor
who would I help?

670
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:08,070
Would I do anything
to harm you?

671
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:17,330
Of course
How can I help?

672
01:12:17,330 --> 01:12:19,960
I should adorn myself
to catch his eye

673
01:12:21,330 --> 01:12:22,460
I need jewelry

674
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:26,960
Take whatever you think
you'll need

675
01:12:42,230 --> 01:12:45,730
When you give birth
to a crown prince

676
01:12:47,230 --> 01:12:50,740
I'll build a temple somewhere
and pray there for life

677
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:55,370
I'm ashamed for being unable
to give birth to a son

678
01:12:56,870 --> 01:13:04,880
His Majesty sent word he is in pain
and will not sleep here

679
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:11,010
Does he know it's the most
auspicious day in 4 years?

680
01:13:11,510 --> 01:13:13,010
Yes, Your Majesty

681
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:21,390
Let's go. My son is ill,
I must see him

682
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:27,520
Have you learned
the traits of a king?

683
01:13:30,530 --> 01:13:33,160
It's okay. Tell me

684
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:38,410
Yes, sire
Its wisdom, virtue, and honor

685
01:13:38,660 --> 01:13:39,540
Good

686
01:13:40,790 --> 01:13:43,040
What does wisdom mean?

687
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:47,290
It means having
open eyes and ears

688
01:13:47,290 --> 01:13:52,420
The eyes must foresee things

689
01:13:52,420 --> 01:13:58,180
The ears must listen
to the people

690
01:13:58,390 --> 01:14:00,060
Good

691
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:01,430
That is correct

692
01:14:02,430 --> 01:14:03,690
Here

693
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:08,190
Sire? The decoction
is getting cold

694
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:14,450
I must be nothing more than
a breeding pig

695
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:18,080
Of course not, sire

696
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:21,950
How can having an heir
be taken lightly?

697
01:14:22,330 --> 01:14:24,960
Quiet! You drink it

698
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:30,840
It would've been better
if you were king

699
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:33,800
Sire. The Queen Mother
has arrived

700
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:57,950
What are you doing!

701
01:14:58,990 --> 01:15:03,330
I am not only your son,
but the king

702
01:15:05,210 --> 01:15:09,000
What king? When you don't come
to the assemblies!

703
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,000
You don't give me a chance
to do anything

704
01:15:12,710 --> 01:15:15,630
You make all the decisions

705
01:15:15,630 --> 01:15:18,260
Now, you want me to be
a puppet?

706
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:24,350
When things settle and you have
an heir, I will step down

707
01:15:24,350 --> 01:15:25,730
When will that be?

708
01:15:28,150 --> 01:15:29,270
What?

709
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:32,520
Why don't you just sit
on the throne, Mother?

710
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:37,490
I am sick of sleeping with
the queen before you!

711
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:41,740
I just have to sow the seeds?

712
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:45,160
It doesn't have to be the queen

713
01:15:46,790 --> 01:15:48,420
An auspicious day?

714
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:51,540
I'll give the concubines
a chance!

715
01:15:52,420 --> 01:15:53,670
Who is it?

716
01:15:53,670 --> 01:15:55,760
It's Lady Geum-ok, sire

717
01:15:56,170 --> 01:15:57,010
Let's go

718
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:10,560
Why you!

719
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:15,190
Your Majesty

720
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:20,070
Why do you have this?

721
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:24,160
Your Majesty, please...

722
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:26,830
Tell me why you have this!

723
01:16:26,830 --> 01:16:30,960
Sire! I can explain...

724
01:16:32,540 --> 01:16:33,420
Your Majesty!

725
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,670
I have something
to say, sire

726
01:16:44,220 --> 01:16:47,220
There's something
you must know

727
01:16:55,860 --> 01:16:57,980
Why was this
in someone else's hand?

728
01:17:00,110 --> 01:17:03,070
Please calm your anger
and have a seat, sure

729
01:17:03,070 --> 01:17:04,950
Don't you know how I feel?

730
01:17:07,450 --> 01:17:09,330
Do you detest me that much?

731
01:17:11,750 --> 01:17:12,500
Am I...

732
01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:17,130
no better than that eunuch?

733
01:17:20,130 --> 01:17:21,130
Drag him in

734
01:17:25,390 --> 01:17:27,010
He seemed familiar

735
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:30,770
He was the fool who lived
in your house!

736
01:17:31,270 --> 01:17:33,520
You disguised him as a eunuch?

737
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:36,900
- That's preposterous
- Explain yourself!

738
01:17:37,270 --> 01:17:39,110
Why is that fool here!

739
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:46,160
I didn't know he was here
until recently, Your Majesty

740
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:48,540
You expect me to believe that?

741
01:17:51,410 --> 01:17:54,920
I remember how he used to
look at you!

742
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,790
You and that fool!

743
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:06,890
Who's the father of
your prematurely born son?

744
01:18:08,050 --> 01:18:10,270
Is he my brother's son or not?

745
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:13,140
Undress him

746
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:16,690
I must see if he is
a eunuch or not!

747
01:18:16,690 --> 01:18:19,940
Must you humiliate me
like this?

748
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:21,320
Strip him!

749
01:18:22,650 --> 01:18:25,820
Sire. Why would you see
something so hideous?

750
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:59,310
Please leave, sire

751
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:08,870
Madam!

752
01:19:09,570 --> 01:19:11,330
Don't you know how I feel?

753
01:19:12,490 --> 01:19:15,000
Do you really think
I don't know?

754
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:23,380
When the Queen Mother
watches so viciously...

755
01:19:25,380 --> 01:19:28,390
Queen Mother or not,
I don't know care!

756
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:35,640
Look at me. I'm a wreck
I want you so!

757
01:19:52,620 --> 01:19:53,160
Sire

758
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:01,540
Sire!

759
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:05,300
Sire!

760
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:18,640
When you become a true king,
please return then

761
01:20:27,150 --> 01:20:28,320
I shall become a king

762
01:20:29,570 --> 01:20:32,280
I shall become a true king

763
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:43,170
He broke family morals and...

764
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:48,840
No one must know of this

765
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:51,180
Yes, Your Majesty

766
01:20:51,970 --> 01:20:54,220
You know very well, sir

767
01:20:56,850 --> 01:21:01,190
What I had to do
to seat him on the throne

768
01:21:03,230 --> 01:21:04,440
Get rid of her

769
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:29,380
Why didn't you tell me?

770
01:21:30,970 --> 01:21:35,140
What would change
by telling you?

771
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:42,140
If you only told me...

772
01:21:53,860 --> 01:21:54,910
Let's run

773
01:21:56,910 --> 01:21:57,780
Then what?

774
01:22:00,370 --> 01:22:02,620
We tried that once

775
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:18,300
Rather than living like this,
let's all leave together

776
01:22:20,010 --> 01:22:22,770
Going outside the palace
means death for us

777
01:22:24,770 --> 01:22:26,770
I won't endanger my son

778
01:22:26,770 --> 01:22:31,320
No matter what,
he's the late king's prince

779
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:34,070
He'll die because of that

780
01:22:34,070 --> 01:22:34,820
No

781
01:22:37,450 --> 01:22:42,080
l'll protect him
no matter what

782
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:52,590
Then

783
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:57,090
How can I help?

784
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:05,730
What do you want me to do?

785
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:17,200
Hwayeon

786
01:23:20,490 --> 01:23:21,580
Sire

787
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:25,080
You shot 40 times
Think of...

788
01:23:31,250 --> 01:23:33,000
You called, Your Majesty?

789
01:23:41,260 --> 01:23:42,010
Shoot!

790
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:44,220
Let's see how good you are

791
01:23:45,140 --> 01:23:47,350
I dare not hold
His Majesty's bow

792
01:23:47,850 --> 01:23:48,980
Give him a bow

793
01:24:00,490 --> 01:24:01,030
Kwonyoo

794
01:24:05,410 --> 01:24:08,040
Why'd you come
into the palace?

795
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:13,040
Becoming a court eunuch
was the only way I had, sire

796
01:24:15,670 --> 01:24:18,300
A eunuch dare loved the queen?

797
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:21,680
Of course not, sire

798
01:24:24,390 --> 01:24:26,060
I must see the former queen

799
01:24:27,310 --> 01:24:31,560
I acted disrespectfully last night,
so I must see her

800
01:24:33,150 --> 01:24:38,400
The Queen Mother is sick in bed
Will you visit her first?

801
01:24:55,550 --> 01:24:58,340
He still suspects it

802
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:05,850
We can't keep staying here

803
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:20,360
Sire, please...

804
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:25,240
Sire!

805
01:25:36,460 --> 01:25:38,090
What is it, sire?

806
01:25:49,390 --> 01:25:50,390
Sire

807
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:58,150
Kwonyoo? Where is he?

808
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:01,740
Call Choongyoung

809
01:27:11,810 --> 01:27:13,600
I'm not drinking
that decoction again

810
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:15,560
But, Your Majesty

811
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:20,980
The Queen Mother makes sure
you drink this every day

812
01:27:21,230 --> 01:27:22,610
Then, you drink it

813
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:24,690
Pardon?

814
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:32,740
But we don't even eat garlic
to curb our libido, sire

815
01:27:36,870 --> 01:27:38,710
Eunuchs have sexual drive?

816
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:47,470
We can't have erections
but still feel sexual desires, sure

817
01:27:51,220 --> 01:27:51,890
Choongyoung

818
01:27:53,260 --> 01:27:54,520
You drink it

819
01:27:57,270 --> 01:27:59,520
Why? You can't?

820
01:28:00,270 --> 01:28:02,150
Afraid to be sexually aroused?

821
01:28:03,900 --> 01:28:04,730
Drink it

822
01:28:32,930 --> 01:28:34,810
I won't endanger my son

823
01:28:36,430 --> 01:28:39,560
I'll protect him
no matter what

824
01:28:56,910 --> 01:29:00,040
'No worries
Yours IS completely gone

825
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:09,340
No!

826
01:29:11,090 --> 01:29:12,180
It can't be!

827
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:17,680
Who is it?

828
01:29:20,180 --> 01:29:21,480
Who ordered this?

829
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:22,850
Please calm down, sire

830
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:26,320
I do not know anything, sire

831
01:29:26,980 --> 01:29:29,860
I just got the medicine
and decocted it as usual

832
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:34,370
Your Majesty...

833
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:42,830
Anyone who speaks of this
shall be beheaded!

834
01:29:43,750 --> 01:29:45,460
Call the physician in secret

835
01:29:48,590 --> 01:29:52,630
Save him
I have something to hear from him

836
01:29:58,890 --> 01:30:01,140
Forgive me, sire!

837
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:04,730
I do not know anything

838
01:30:04,730 --> 01:30:05,770
Show the evidence

839
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:09,030
Do you recognize it?

840
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:11,530
It was found in your room

841
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:15,410
I really don't know, sire

842
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:18,870
Why?

843
01:30:19,790 --> 01:30:21,790
Did the Queen Mother say
to kill me?

844
01:30:21,790 --> 01:30:23,920
Of course not, sire

845
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:28,920
Then, who is in charge of
the medicinal herbs?

846
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:33,050
It's Minister Yoon, sire

847
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:44,310
No one is allowed in, sir

848
01:30:49,820 --> 01:30:50,520
Look

849
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:52,280
Wake up!

850
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:56,950
Pil-woon, wake up

851
01:30:57,200 --> 01:31:00,700
Water...

852
01:31:03,450 --> 01:31:04,460
Here

853
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:10,090
More

854
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:22,220
Are you okay?

855
01:31:22,810 --> 01:31:25,100
I'm a sore sight, aren't I?

856
01:31:26,350 --> 01:31:28,480
I must look awful

857
01:31:30,060 --> 01:31:32,860
You don't look too bad

858
01:31:34,490 --> 01:31:37,860
He gave Minister Yoon's name

859
01:31:38,860 --> 01:31:42,490
Terror will soon strike
the palace

860
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:47,620
Send me along before then?

861
01:31:48,370 --> 01:31:52,340
What do you mean?

862
01:31:53,340 --> 01:31:56,880
You know very well
what power is

863
01:31:58,470 --> 01:32:02,970
His Majesty must want something
out of this

864
01:32:04,350 --> 01:32:07,890
Though living in dung
is better than dying

865
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:13,770
I don't want to go on

866
01:32:17,030 --> 01:32:17,780
Please?

867
01:32:19,410 --> 01:32:20,780
I can't!

868
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:27,790
What if the king
wants your name?

869
01:32:34,250 --> 01:32:35,250
What are you doing?

870
01:32:37,550 --> 01:32:40,680
I'll get you out of the palace

871
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:45,010
It's no use. I'm exhausted

872
01:32:45,010 --> 01:32:47,020
I'll see to everything!

873
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:56,440
Look”.

874
01:32:58,070 --> 01:33:00,570
Thanks for your company

875
01:33:01,700 --> 01:33:03,570
Sorry to go first

876
01:33:03,950 --> 01:33:05,580
Put that down!

877
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:09,830
No!

878
01:33:10,830 --> 01:33:12,830
Wake up!

879
01:33:14,090 --> 01:33:16,340
Pil-woon! No!

880
01:33:19,170 --> 01:33:21,220
Go in peace, my friend

881
01:33:23,550 --> 01:33:27,970
Don't stop by here and there

882
01:33:30,230 --> 01:33:38,690
Just look at the white light
and go straight there

883
01:33:46,830 --> 01:33:47,620
I promise

884
01:33:48,700 --> 01:33:51,120
I'll bring the prince
back safely

885
01:33:52,620 --> 01:33:56,380
We'll soon meet again
Don't fret, Your Highness

886
01:34:01,510 --> 01:34:04,140
Mother! I don't want to go!

887
01:34:05,010 --> 01:34:08,640
Mother!

888
01:34:13,770 --> 01:34:15,980
That is nothing but the truth?

889
01:34:15,980 --> 01:34:18,900
I wouldn't dare lie
to you, Your Majesty

890
01:34:21,030 --> 01:34:24,780
She deceived a eunuch's child
for the king's son?

891
01:34:26,620 --> 01:34:29,540
And became a queen?

892
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:34,540
Wretched whore!

893
01:34:36,790 --> 01:34:37,920
Come in!

894
01:34:41,550 --> 01:34:42,670
Yes, Your Majesty

895
01:34:43,300 --> 01:34:44,630
Send her to the dungeon

896
01:34:53,060 --> 01:34:54,810
Me?

897
01:34:58,560 --> 01:34:59,400
Your Majesty!

898
01:35:00,690 --> 01:35:06,820
I'll go back to being a maid!
Please, not the dungeon!

899
01:35:08,410 --> 01:35:10,700
I'd rather die than go there!

900
01:35:12,450 --> 01:35:13,080
Kill her

901
01:35:13,950 --> 01:35:19,170
But, Your Majesty! No!

902
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:21,840
Let me go!

903
01:35:22,210 --> 01:35:23,920
Why're you doing this to me?

904
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:28,720
Please save me, Your Majesty!

905
01:35:29,930 --> 01:35:32,430
Let go! No!

906
01:35:32,930 --> 01:35:36,350
Your Majesty!

907
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:41,190
I don't want to die!

908
01:35:42,440 --> 01:35:43,860
There is more!

909
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:55,000
The Queen Mother sent strict
orders to escort you

910
01:35:59,210 --> 01:36:01,630
Minister Yoon!
The king has charged you!

911
01:36:10,140 --> 01:36:13,760
Fool! How dare you come
here like that?

912
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:14,890
What's going on?

913
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:18,730
Minister Yoon is charged
with treason

914
01:36:19,650 --> 01:36:20,900
Treason?

915
01:36:22,150 --> 01:36:23,900
Go away at once!

916
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:28,030
I apologize, but the king ordered
to imprison him at once

917
01:36:29,740 --> 01:36:30,660
The king's order?

918
01:36:35,660 --> 01:36:37,910
Who put you in that position?

919
01:36:39,420 --> 01:36:40,870
You dare raise your sword?

920
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:46,170
You dare raise a sword at me?

921
01:36:51,300 --> 01:36:56,020
I'll go to the king
Go to the dungeon and kill her!

922
01:37:02,440 --> 01:37:06,070
The chief eunuch
has arrived, sire

923
01:37:31,180 --> 01:37:32,090
Sire!

924
01:37:35,220 --> 01:37:36,470
Where are you?

925
01:37:37,680 --> 01:37:39,060
I know you are here!

926
01:37:40,680 --> 01:37:41,980
Come out here!

927
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:45,360
Sitting up here

928
01:37:48,190 --> 01:37:51,740
I can see why you were
so attached to it

929
01:37:51,740 --> 01:37:53,240
What are you doing there?

930
01:37:55,370 --> 01:37:58,080
Why did you order
Minister Yoon's arrest?

931
01:38:02,250 --> 01:38:04,500
You sent away
the soldiers I sent?

932
01:38:05,330 --> 01:38:08,130
How can you send soldiers
to your mother?

933
01:38:09,090 --> 01:38:12,760
I must really be a puppet king

934
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:22,770
You liked that seat so much,
you cut me up into a puppet

935
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:26,480
Now, you'll get rid of me?

936
01:38:27,020 --> 01:38:28,400
What do you mean?

937
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:35,660
Did you give the order
to poison me?

938
01:38:37,030 --> 01:38:37,870
What?

939
01:38:39,660 --> 01:38:41,370
The physician confessed

940
01:38:43,250 --> 01:38:46,290
You plotted with Yoon
to kill me?

941
01:38:48,040 --> 01:38:48,670
What?

942
01:38:50,050 --> 01:38:52,420
- That's preposterous!
- Isn't it?

943
01:38:54,170 --> 01:38:55,930
I thought it was strange

944
01:38:57,800 --> 01:39:02,180
Your man, Yoon, couldn't have
plotted this alone!

945
01:39:04,270 --> 01:39:05,560
This is a trap!

946
01:39:09,060 --> 01:39:12,570
The former queen is up to this
That wretch!

947
01:39:12,570 --> 01:39:19,200
Right. Now, I see

948
01:39:21,580 --> 01:39:25,960
Poison the decoction
than frame her?

949
01:39:29,210 --> 01:39:33,710
Kill me, her, and my nephew?

950
01:39:37,340 --> 01:39:40,050
Then, who did you plan
to seat here?

951
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:42,060
What do you mean?

952
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:48,690
Minister Yoon and I lived
to put you on that throne!

953
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:55,610
You lasted quite long

954
01:39:58,110 --> 01:40:00,120
- Kill her!
- Yes, sir!

955
01:40:09,500 --> 01:40:11,250
- Who are you!
- Charge!

956
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:22,640
Kill them!

957
01:40:30,350 --> 01:40:34,400
Seize everyone one of
the traitors!

958
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:35,860
Traitors!

959
01:40:59,380 --> 01:41:02,010
Do you know what she did?

960
01:41:03,180 --> 01:41:05,560
The late king couldn't
have children

961
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:07,930
Be honest for once!

962
01:41:12,060 --> 01:41:14,570
Have you forgotten?

963
01:41:14,570 --> 01:41:17,070
The late queen died
while giving birth!

964
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:21,820
I poisoned him since

965
01:41:23,820 --> 01:41:27,540
- The prince's birth is dubious
- What?

966
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:34,040
You poisoned my brother?

967
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:45,720
Who asked you to do that?

968
01:41:46,680 --> 01:41:47,970
For whom!

969
01:41:50,180 --> 01:41:52,600
For whom did you do that!

970
01:41:55,860 --> 01:41:59,740
When did I ever say
I wanted to be king?

971
01:42:01,110 --> 01:42:04,110
When did I ever say
I wanted to be king!

972
01:42:08,740 --> 01:42:09,580
My child...

973
01:42:10,500 --> 01:42:11,460
Look at me

974
01:42:19,250 --> 01:42:22,880
It was all to protect you
in this cruel palace

975
01:42:24,220 --> 01:42:26,260
I'm your mother

976
01:42:32,390 --> 01:42:34,650
Why'd you force me
on the throne

977
01:42:37,270 --> 01:42:40,400
and turn me into someone
who can't trust his mother?

978
01:42:41,230 --> 01:42:43,400
You can't trust me?

979
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:54,540
You dare defy your mother!

980
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:03,670
If you all meet,
the truth will come out

981
01:43:05,050 --> 01:43:06,300
Guards!

982
01:43:08,180 --> 01:43:12,180
Bring Minister Yoon
and Kwonyoo at once!

983
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:13,930
That won't happen!

984
01:43:13,930 --> 01:43:15,690
Yes, it will!

985
01:43:21,070 --> 01:43:21,820
Minister Yoon!

986
01:43:33,790 --> 01:43:38,580
I brought the criminals
as ordered, Your Majesty

987
01:43:42,300 --> 01:43:43,840
The physician confessed

988
01:43:45,720 --> 01:43:47,680
Evidence was found in his room

989
01:43:48,550 --> 01:43:51,050
Who do you think he said
was behind this?

990
01:43:51,050 --> 01:43:54,980
How would I know, sire?

991
01:43:54,980 --> 01:43:56,690
Why can't you say it!

992
01:43:57,480 --> 01:44:00,610
I do not know anything

993
01:44:00,610 --> 01:44:04,570
I drank the decoction,
did I not?

994
01:44:04,570 --> 01:44:08,490
Then, why'd you hesitate
when I told you to drink it!

995
01:44:09,740 --> 01:44:11,740
You knew it was poisoned,
didn't you!

996
01:44:11,740 --> 01:44:13,620
Enough! Stop it!

997
01:44:13,620 --> 01:44:16,710
I'm asking this fool
a question!

998
01:44:18,870 --> 01:44:21,630
You knew!

999
01:44:21,630 --> 01:44:23,500
How'd you know
it was poisoned?

1000
01:44:24,590 --> 01:44:25,210
Sire!

1001
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:27,720
Do you know what she did?

1002
01:44:29,630 --> 01:44:34,970
She defiled the royal court
with that fool!

1003
01:44:36,100 --> 01:44:38,350
Drag her here to confess!

1004
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:40,520
Yes!

1005
01:44:42,270 --> 01:44:43,980
I'm guilty

1006
01:44:44,780 --> 01:44:47,400
Guilty for bearing
the late king's son

1007
01:44:48,610 --> 01:44:50,660
And guilty for being alive

1008
01:44:50,660 --> 01:44:54,790
You're guilty for this uproar
due to your son

1009
01:44:55,990 --> 01:44:58,620
And guilty for distracting
the king!

1010
01:45:01,630 --> 01:45:02,670
But, Your Majesty

1011
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:05,380
Who is that man?

1012
01:45:07,010 --> 01:45:11,300
He's Minister Yoon's man
who killed my father

1013
01:45:12,300 --> 01:45:18,140
What daughter would secretly
plot with the enemy?

1014
01:45:18,140 --> 01:45:18,810
You wretch!

1015
01:45:19,810 --> 01:45:22,770
How dare you show
fake tears here!

1016
01:45:23,310 --> 01:45:26,070
What would my young child
know or do

1017
01:45:26,900 --> 01:45:29,440
that I'd covet your throne?

1018
01:45:30,320 --> 01:45:32,160
If I thought that
in the slightest

1019
01:45:33,950 --> 01:45:37,330
I'd bite my tongue
and die right here

1020
01:45:38,700 --> 01:45:43,460
But I cannot die falsely accused
as someone so shameless

1021
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:50,840
Confess the truth!

1022
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:53,470
Who ordered you to poison
the decoction?

1023
01:46:09,820 --> 01:46:11,320
The Queen Mother

1024
01:46:13,070 --> 01:46:17,120
She ordered me to make
the poison

1025
01:46:18,200 --> 01:46:22,250
And Minister Yoon gave it to...

1026
01:46:22,250 --> 01:46:23,330
This is a trap!

1027
01:46:23,330 --> 01:46:24,250
It's a trap, sire!

1028
01:46:29,590 --> 01:46:30,710
What are you doing?

1029
01:46:33,260 --> 01:46:35,260
Why did you do it!

1030
01:46:35,890 --> 01:46:41,140
Was the throne that dear
to kill your own son?

1031
01:46:41,140 --> 01:46:42,520
Tell me!

1032
01:46:43,270 --> 01:46:45,350
Calm down, sire!

1033
01:46:45,350 --> 01:46:47,730
She can't breathe! Sire!

1034
01:46:55,410 --> 01:47:00,540
Lock them up
and execute them all!

1035
01:47:02,870 --> 01:47:05,920
Escort the Queen Mother
to remain in her quarters

1036
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:14,050
Anyone who dares Contact her
shall be gravely punished!

1037
01:47:15,550 --> 01:47:18,180
Your Majesty! No!

1038
01:47:29,310 --> 01:47:31,400
Thank you for keeping
your promise

1039
01:47:32,440 --> 01:47:35,320
I shall never forget this

1040
01:47:40,410 --> 01:47:43,910
Our son...Protect him well

1041
01:47:50,170 --> 01:47:51,210
Our son?

1042
01:47:53,420 --> 01:47:56,300
The prince is no one's son

1043
01:47:57,970 --> 01:47:59,090
He is my son

1044
01:48:55,480 --> 01:49:00,280
When you become a true king,
please return then

1045
01:49:25,390 --> 01:49:26,680
Is it all done?

1046
01:49:28,520 --> 01:49:31,310
Will you accept me now?

1047
01:55:45,060 --> 01:55:48,060
Farewell, My King!

1048
01:55:50,060 --> 01:55:53,690
Farewell, My King!

1049
01:55:55,450 --> 01:55:58,820
Farewell, My King!

1050
01:56:00,700 --> 01:56:05,200
Open your ears to hear
the people

1051
01:56:07,080 --> 01:56:11,210
Calm thy heart first
for the affairs of the nation

1052
01:56:13,920 --> 01:56:15,470
Understood?

1053
01:56:16,970 --> 01:56:17,930
Your Highness?

1054
01:56:23,430 --> 01:56:25,100
At last, it happened?

1055
01:56:27,690 --> 01:56:29,480
I am very sorry

1056
01:56:32,690 --> 01:56:36,990
So, you came for me?

1057
01:56:43,240 --> 01:56:44,620
Do me a favor
