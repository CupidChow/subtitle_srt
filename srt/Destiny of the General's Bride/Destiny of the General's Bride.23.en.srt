1
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,620
=Destiny of the General's Bride=

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,020
=Episode 23=

3
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,679
Be careful

4
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:46,759
and don't break...

5
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,000
Why are you here, demoness?

6
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:52,960
I should be asking you that.

7
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:55,920
How can they touch
General's belongings?

8
00:00:57,399 --> 00:00:58,560
He's on death row,

9
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:01,159
so he's no longer a general.

10
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,719
And you.

11
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:03,840
I thought

12
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,359
you loved each other in weal and woe.

13
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,079
Now

14
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,920
you're here saving your own skin.

15
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:14,719
General and I
have agreed to have a divorce.

16
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:16,560
And it's the deadline.

17
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,680
Here's the repudiation letter.

18
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:21,280
Please pass it to him on my behalf.

19
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,340
(Repudiation Letter)

20
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,400
Trying to cut ties with Xiao Yun

21
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:35,640
to get away with it?

22
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,359
I won't let you get your way.

23
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:48,040
Is he dead?

24
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,280
Not yet.

25
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,640
He's breathing his last.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,319
We've been waiting for you two.

27
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,159
Wake him up with some water.

28
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:57,159
Let him see how his former lover

29
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,319
has treated him.

30
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,360
You're losing it, huh?

31
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:13,919
What my Ye had

32
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,080
was worse than these few whips
you've had!

33
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,879
When he

34
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,520
was doing that to Hua,

35
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,639
he should've seen that coming.

36
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:32,759
How loyal you are.

37
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,319
It's a shame that your Hua

38
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,759
has run away.

39
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:46,439
I knew it, you're still alive.

40
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,039
You need not provoke me

41
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,919
with such a lowly trick.

42
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:53,599
You don't believe it?

43
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:58,759
Then I'll show you

44
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:01,879
the repudiation letter she got you.

45
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,960
"Xiao Yun, Grand General
of 30,000 Calvary in Jiangzhou,

46
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,240
is to be executed for a grave offense.

47
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,840
His wife, Qing Yan, weeps
as she bids farewell to him.

48
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,759
A chill wind blows, tears hard to stop.

49
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,319
Petals fall without a sound,
the heart already spent.

50
00:03:22,059 --> 00:03:23,480
She hereby sets down
this letter of divorce,

51
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,580
lest there be no proof hereafter.

52
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:27,639
This written agreement
shall serve as evidence."

53
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,759
Qing Yan...

54
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,280
Qing Yan...

55
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,160
Xiao Yun, what else do you have to say?

56
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,920
I've said

57
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,560
what I needed to say.

58
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,720
Today's the third day.

59
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,279
Execute him.

60
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,839
Qing Yan.

61
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,240
I fear I can't wait much longer.

62
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,600
Hold on!

63
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,279
Her Highness...

64
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:11,439
Imperial Uncle,
please put the execution on hold.

65
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,480
It's a death sentence,

66
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,360
there's no way we're postponing it.

67
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,759
Twenty years ago,

68
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:18,759
there was a concubine murder case
at Xiao Residence.

69
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:21,519
General Xiao is the main witness
of that case,

70
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:23,350
so he needs to be there
to give his testimony.

71
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,279
That's a crime of passion
among the common folk.

72
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:27,160
What does that have to do with me?

73
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:28,959
Carry on with the execution.

74
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,199
That woman was Mo Mei.

75
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:37,759
Stop!

76
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,260
Rest assured, Your Lordship.

77
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:01,519
(Twenty years ago)
I'll treat Mo Mei

78
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,959
like how I treat my own wife.

79
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,839
(Old General Xiao)
When your son is born,

80
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,160
I'll treat him like my own.

81
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,519
I won't let anyone bully them.

82
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,439
The situation in court is complicated.

83
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,759
I fear that me taking the wrong side

84
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,120
will implicate Mo Mei.

85
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,319
Therefore, no one must know

86
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,639
about my relationship with Mo Mei.

87
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,360
I understand.

88
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,360
Mo Mei is a woman I met while traveling.

89
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,560
The child she carries is mine.

90
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:27,800
It has nothing to do with Your Lordship.

91
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:43,040
Honey, come and meet Mo Mei.

92
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,160
From today on,

93
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:45,600
she is your little sister.

94
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:52,660
(Madam Mo Mei)

95
00:06:52,867 --> 00:06:55,467
(Heritage of Generations)

96
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,079
Thank you, Your Highness.

97
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,360
You'd better explain

98
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:19,240
what you just said.

99
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,560
Your Lordship,
don't believe their nonsense!

100
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:23,639
They've been bewitched by that demoness!

101
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,319
As for this case,

102
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,879
I already have an advocate.

103
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,240
Please come in.

104
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:05,720
Didn't...

105
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:07,560
Didn't you leave?

106
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:10,759
Grand Madam Xiao,

107
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,560
you didn't truly think

108
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,360
I'd divorce General Xiao, did you?

109
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,319
"A chill wind blows, tears hard to stop.

110
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,319
Petals fall without a sound,
the heart already spent."

111
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,720
That was clearly my signal to him.

112
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,639
That pendant...

113
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,840
Where did you get it?

114
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,279
Your Lordship, it's a long story.

115
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,840
Please

116
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,080
hear me out.

117
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,080
(Your Lordship used to)

118
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,039
(have a lover who was an ordinary folk.)

119
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,590
Your Lordship!

120
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:05,679
(Her name was Mo Mei.)

121
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,039
You're back.

122
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:08,879
Have you thought of a name

123
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,240
for our child?

124
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:13,360
You'll know on the day he's born.

125
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,720
(But with the turmoil of the times,)

126
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:19,919
(you feared she might be implicated.)

127
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:23,279
(Thus, he entrusted her
to Old General Xiao)

128
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:25,919
(and strictly ordered
her identity kept secret.)

129
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:28,840
(But then war suddenly broke out)

130
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,159
(and Old General Xiao died in battle.)

131
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,159
(And Mo Mei passed away from illness.)

132
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:36,639
But what you didn't know was

133
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,240
Mo Mei did not die of plague.

134
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,639
She was killed by Grand Madam Xiao.

135
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,120
You've got better

136
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,440
at making up stories.

137
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,320
Then tell me.

138
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,039
What proof do you have?

139
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,879
Due to her jealousy,

140
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,120
ever since Mo Mei
entered the Xiao Residence,

141
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,720
Grand Madam Xiao made things hard
for her and the child.

142
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,159
She even told me to kill the young heir.

143
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,519
But he was still so small.

144
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,279
(I couldn't bring myself to do that.)

145
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:21,360
(Later,)

146
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,639
(Grand Madam Xiao
ordered me to kill Madam Mo Mei.)

147
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,320
She threatened me

148
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:30,279
to make my husband divorce me
if I refused to do that.

149
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,559
Everything has been seen to.

150
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,559
And Xiao Yun?

151
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:37,360
He lost his mother
and fell into a high fever.

152
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,480
His days are numbered.

153
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:40,240
Madam.

154
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,600
The King of Xiling is here.

155
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,919
He's asking to see Mo Mei.

156
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,279
Who?

157
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,399
Second Madam, Mo Mei.

158
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:49,440
(Only then did Grand Madam Xiao realize)

159
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:53,240
(Mo Mei was Your Lordship's woman.)

160
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:58,879
We... We'll just say Mo Mei
passed away

161
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,320
from fatigue after childbirth
and longing for him.

162
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,519
Then we return Xiao Yun to His Lordship.

163
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:07,559
You fool! Xiao Yun has grown up.

164
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,240
If he blurts out in His Lordship's presence

165
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,159
that we abused

166
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,840
and poisoned his mother,

167
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:14,559
would we get away with it?

168
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:15,440
Well...

169
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,000
Our only choice

170
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:18,639
is to tell His Lordship

171
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,200
that Ye is his child.

172
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:21,320
But...

173
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:23,360
But I don't think that's appropriate.

174
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,159
Didn't you want a position

175
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,559
for your husband?

176
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,240
Now's the chance.

177
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,039
Will you take it or not?

178
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,840
And so

179
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,200
she tricked Your Lordship

180
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,039
into acknowledging Xiao Ye as your son.

181
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,240
Utter nonsense!

182
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,559
How can we trust

183
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:46,600
these woman and servant?

184
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,990
Your Lordship, please exercise
your judgment!

185
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:50,679
This is the proof.

186
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:54,559
This pendant was given
by General Xiao's mother.

187
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,559
He has always worn it.

188
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,919
It's an ordinary trinket.

189
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,879
How can you prove it was Mo Mei's?

190
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,279
On its own, this jade pendant

191
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:05,679
seems nothing special.

192
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:08,559
But paired with Your Lordship's
plum blossom pendant,

193
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:13,120
it's clear this was the token of love
between you and Mo Mei.

194
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,919
Madam Xiao.

195
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,360
Is Qing Yan

196
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,279
telling the truth?

197
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:36,679
Xiao Yun

198
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,679
is indeed Your Lordship's son.
