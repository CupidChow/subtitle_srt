00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,020
=Episode 11=

3
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:27,359
Like this?

4
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,359
Still can't remember a thing?

5
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,359
Hua.

6
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,679
Hua.

7
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:38,359
What's on your mind?

8
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:39,520
You look so lost in thought.

9
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:42,560
I wasn't thinking about anything.

10
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,280
Su Man'er

11
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,359
is staying with Miss Yu now.

12
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:48,600
Do you want to see her?

13
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:50,560
How is she?

14
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:54,679
A bit emotional.

15
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,079
She likely doesn't
want to see you either.

16
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,200
Miss Yu checked her pulse.

17
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:02,479
Turns out she's pregnant.

18
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,280
As soon as she found out,

19
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,480
she kept crying for Xiao Ye.

20
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:08,120
She wouldn't see anyone else.

21
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:09,760
She even threw me out.

22
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,760
Go tell her,

23
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,799
she needs to take care of herself.

24
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,159
After a while,

25
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,159
I'll let her see who she wants to see.

26
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:39,599
Hua won't open up to me.

27
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,560
I feel useless.

28
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,359
But I can't just sit here
and do nothing.

29
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:49,519
I'd say you've done plenty, General.

30
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,799
You even call for your dear
in your dreams.

31
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:57,159
Found anything on the thing
I asked you to investigate?

32
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,239
If I hadn't,

33
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:00,760
I wouldn't dare show my face here.

34
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,000
Those guys aren't exactly tight-lipped.

35
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,079
Before we even hit them,

36
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,110
they spilled everything.

37
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,280
They said Madam was looking
for a girl named Xiao Lian.

38
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,159
So where is she now?

39
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:14,080
Your Minister of Revenue uncle

40
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:16,159
has more power than anyone should.

41
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:17,620
With just a few words,

42
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,639
he pinned a crime on her and
had her exiled to the frontier.

43
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,879
Cui Liang, send someone after her.

44
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:27,520
General?

45
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,199
Xiao Ye and his uncle have
the King Of Xiling behind them.

46
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:32,719
They have money and power.

47
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,039
The people at the border

48
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,280
will never let her go.

49
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:38,000
Xiao Lian is the key witness

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,990
to Zhang Yuanxing
and the others bending the law.

51
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:42,719
At any cost,

52
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:45,000
she must be brought back.

53
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,199
Alive.

54
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:48,960
Hua.

55
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,319
That's everything General owns.

56
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,479
Will it work?

57
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:54,900
When have you ever seen me fail?

58
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:55,840
Come on, slower.

59
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:01,199
This scheme could make a fortune.

60
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:03,000
You must handle it carefully.

61
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:04,560
And don't let Xiao Ye

62
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,879
or those two old ones
from the Xiao family find out.

63
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,439
Once they get money,

64
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,879
they won't listen to us anymore.

65
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,879
Those two sly foxes.

66
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,780
Who knows what trick they're up to?

67
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:28,159
The other day, I overheard

68
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,479
her little maid saying
they bought a lot of Suhe Luo.

69
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,199
Suhe Luo? What even is that?

70
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,080
Well?

71
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,879
Why did you buy Suhe Luo?

72
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,199
What's it for?

73
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,000
Still won't fess up?

74
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:53,400
Next time, it won't just be a slap

75
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,719
you must endure.

76
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:56,439
I don't know what you're talking about.

77
00:03:58,639 --> 00:03:59,439
Ye.

78
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,400
This girl is stubborn.

79
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,960
What should we do?

80
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,840
Aunt, you've done enough.

81
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,079
Look at Nan Jiang's hands.

82
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,720
So delicate and pretty.

83
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,839
Such a pity.

84
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:32,279
Hands this lovely

85
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,439
won't obey me.

86
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:38,439
Hence, they're useless anyway.

87
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:39,959
I'll talk.

88
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,519
I'll talk!

89
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:48,279
She said

90
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,560
a few days ago she saw a Hu merchant

91
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,399
selling a spice called Suhe Luo.

92
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,079
It's cheap,

93
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,759
but has a rare fragrance.

94
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,040
It's one of a kind.

95
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,240
You don't see it much in the market now.

96
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,199
If it's made into incense,

97
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:05,040
it should sell really well.

98
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,439
She wants to make more money

99
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,480
to smooth the way for General,

100
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,240
and buy him a higher rank.

101
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:32,199
Sister, I've already asked around.

102
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,959
That Suhe Luo was brought in last year

103
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,839
by a Hu merchant
from the Western Regions.

104
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,240
It carries a unique scent

105
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:39,199
unlike any other spice.

106
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,639
If we seize the chance,

107
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,639
we can make a fortune.

108
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,560
The birthday of Ye's godfather
is coming soon.

109
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,880
We need money for the celebration.

110
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,360
No time to lose.

111
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:52,639
Buy in bulk.

112
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:53,439
But...

113
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,439
Sister,

114
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,519
most of the Xiao Residence's wealth

115
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,079
has already been lost to Qing Yan.

116
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:01,279
If we buy in bulk now...

117
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:12,199
Brother,

118
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:15,160
when you begged me to buy your post,

119
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,439
did I ever say no?

120
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,439
That's true.

121
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,959
Thank you, Sister,
for buying me that position.

122
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:23,160
But alas,

123
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,560
it's just a useless idle position.

124
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,639
There are hardly any savings at home.

125
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,639
Do you think I don't know?

126
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,480
You've been colluding with brokers,

127
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,279
sending others in place of the exiled.

128
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,959
How much silver have you pocketed?

129
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,680
We're family, you and I.

130
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,800
And you're family to Ye as well.

131
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,839
When I paid for your post,

132
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,199
Ye heard about it

133
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:51,720
and even took from his own savings

134
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,199
to help you out.

135
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:55,040
He said he wanted
his uncle to live well.

136
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,439
And now Ye has been harmed by villains,

137
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:01,360
and doesn't even have
the money for a minor post.

138
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,199
Yet you still keep making excuses.

139
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,240
Mother.

140
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,040
Please don't blame Uncle.

141
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,639
When we helped him back then,

142
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,279
it wasn't because

143
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:19,560
we expected him to repay us.

144
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,480
But after all that has happened,

145
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,959
I can't help but feel bitter.

146
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,759
I truly wanted what's best for Uncle.

147
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,079
But I never thought

148
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:31,000
he cared so little

149
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,399
about his own nephew.

150
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,160
If that's the case,

151
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,439
I think Uncle should keep his distance

152
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:38,800
from my godfather.

153
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:40,800
So Mother and I don't keep

154
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,240
wasting our hearts on the wrong people.

155
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:49,839
If that's how it is,

156
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:52,199
I'll go raise the money

157
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,160
and buy the Suhe Luo.

158
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:57,560
Thank you, Uncle.

159
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,600
Cursed scoundrels.

160
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,839
How could they do this to you?

161
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,879
It's been days
and you're still not healed.

162
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,160
Nan Jiang,

163
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:14,439
I'm sorry you had to go through this.

164
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,680
Hua, as long as
Xiao Ye learns his lesson,

165
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,439
what's a few small injuries?

166
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:21,959
But Hua,

167
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,279
what's our next move?

168
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,600
The Suhe Luo they bought isn't enough.

169
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,879
We still need General

170
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:32,000
to play his part in the act.

171
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,039
I really underestimated you.

172
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,600
I risked my life,

173
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,840
bled on the battlefield,
to build what little I have,

174
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,440
and you've squandered it all.

175
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,600
Now you see, General,

176
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,080
what kind of person I really am.

177
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:45,360
When we first met,

178
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,080
did I ever show you my true face?

179
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,840
I happen to have

180
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,000
a thousand faces.

181
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,960
Which one you see

182
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,320
depends on which one you deserve.

183
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,559
If you can't see clearly now,

184
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,679
then one day I can carve it
on your tombstone,

185
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:59,440
so you'll see it plain as day in death!

186
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,440
Say that again.

187
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,440
Go on, say it.

188
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,919
Go, report to the Grand Madam.

189
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,120
I'll hit you all I want!

190
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,279
Hua, General,

191
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,559
the Grand Madam's spies are gone.

192
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,879
Good. Understood.

193
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,240
That was quite a performance.

194
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,879
It certainly was.

195
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:31,919
But you know,

196
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:34,200
you can put on a show too, General.

197
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,240
When you finally
lay down your armor one day,

198
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,879
you could make a living on the stage.

199
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:41,879
Good thing I'm not your enemy.

200
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,090
Otherwise,
hearing your scolding every day

201
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:45,440
would drive me mad.

202
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,840
A general doesn't need a sharp tongue,

203
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:49,840
just a sharp blade.

204
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:54,720
Why did you get these things

205
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:56,080
sent here?

206
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,399
For fishing, of course.

207
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,639
Fishing?

208
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,860
(Suhe Luo)

209
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,799
To fish properly,

210
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,679
you need to put in some bait.

211
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,519
And your bait

212
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:18,039
is this pile of cheap spices?

213
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:20,240
The fish is big,

214
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,399
but it stinks too.

215
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,840
Spending real silver on them

216
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:25,279
just isn't worth it.

217
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,080
So what are you planning
to do with these spices?

218
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:32,480
When General fights in battle,

219
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:36,159
many soldiers
under him fall on the field.

220
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,320
And their families?

221
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,360
They go into mourning.

222
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:40,559
And mourning means burning incense.

223
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,399
But the cheap incense in the market

224
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,600
is toxic

225
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:45,759
if inhaled too much.

226
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,080
Our family once dealt in spices.

227
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,240
So,

228
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,039
I know a thing or two.

229
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:52,200
Once burned,

230
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,039
these spices

231
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:55,000
aren't toxic.

232
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,559
In fact, they soothe the mind.

233
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:58,039
The soldiers are gone,

234
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,240
their families shouldn't keep suffering.

235
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,039
So this is your fishing method?

236
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,559
You will know in time.

237
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,159
Yes.

238
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,240
My wife is a master fisher.

239
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:16,200
She caught me with just one hairpin.

240
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:20,879
Why don't you wear it?

241
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:23,480
I'm not Miss Su.

242
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,399
If I wear a golden hairpin,

243
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:27,000
what if Miss Su gets jealous?

244
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,559
Don't worry.

245
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:31,679
If she knows the reason,

246
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:33,919
she won't be upset.

247
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,639
- This is bad!
- One move too late…

248
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,799
Bad news!

249
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:44,759
Bad news!

250
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:45,720
Don't panic,

251
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,879
hold yourself together.

252
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:48,279
Suhe Luo.

253
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,080
It's the Suhe Luo!

254
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,039
Aunt.

255
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:54,159
Didn't we already make this incense?

256
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:01,039
I don't know why,

257
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,360
but everyone is using it

258
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,159
at funerals.

259
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:06,519
And the scent is so distinct

260
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:08,799
that anyone who smells it

261
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,240
feels like a funeral is happening.

262
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:13,360
Now people think it's bad luck,

263
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:18,159
and no one will buy our incense anymore.
