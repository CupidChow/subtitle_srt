=Destiny of the General's Bride=

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,020
=Episode 18=

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,960
Grandmother, I heard

4
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,679
you went
to that tainted place yesterday.

5
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:18,960
I had them

6
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,640
prepare a calming tonic for you.

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:21,839
Please try it.

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,120
The Xiao family and ours
have always maintained good relations.

9
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:31,559
If they truly committed
such a grave crime,

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,159
whatever are we to do?

11
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,159
Perhaps it's better if I accuse Qing Yan

12
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:38,880
of slander and false accusation,

13
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,960
and give you a Xiao Yun without a wife?

14
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:45,240
But what about

15
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,759
those poor women
who were silenced and blinded?

16
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,320
What?

17
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:52,520
Do you believe everything Qing Yan says?

18
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:56,200
Grandmother,
I am Princess Zhaoping of Great Yu.

19
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,759
I have been captured
by savages multiple times,

20
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,799
yet not once have I shed a tear.

21
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,600
I'm confident
I could win Xiao Yun's heart

22
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,560
without resorting to those means.

23
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:08,959
Besides, those who earn
their living from the people

24
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,480
must bear their burdens as well.

25
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,480
What if I were not Princess Zhaoping,

26
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:15,719
but an ordinary woman?

27
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,599
I fear my name

28
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:21,159
would be listed in that ledger too.

29
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:24,560
So whatever the truth may be,

30
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:28,120
you must see
to a thorough investigation.

31
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,760
My Ping has grown sensible.

32
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,079
Rest assured.

33
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,719
Your beloved has already

34
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:37,200
reported Xiao Ye's deeds to the court.

35
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,200
He is a man who understands propriety
and the larger picture.

36
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,719
You have not misjudged him.

37
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,959
But, Grandmother, let me be upfront.

38
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:46,480
Official matters
must be dealt with fairly.

39
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,480
Matters of love, however,
are a matter of the heart.

40
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,120
I won't let go of the man

41
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,000
I desire

42
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,120
without a fight.

43
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,319
As you wish.

44
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,400
Empress Dowager,
Grand Madam Xiao requests an audience.

45
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:05,560
I won't see her.
Even my Ping knows better

46
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:07,319
than that old woman in her 60s.

47
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,599
Of course not.

48
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,840
Does she not know who raised me?

49
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,039
Are you all right?

50
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:16,560
Are you hurt anywhere?

51
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:17,439
I'm fine.

52
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,360
Empress Dowager and Princess Zhaoping
have petitioned His Majesty

53
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,599
to order a full investigation.

54
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,759
Rest assured.

55
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,560
Justice will be served.

56
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,039
Princess Zhaoping?

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,970
Her Highness has reported
everything she's seen and heard

58
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:33,599
to His Majesty,

59
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:34,759
vouching for you.

60
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,719
No one will be allowed

61
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,759
to act with impunity simply because

62
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,120
they claim a sworn father.

63
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,360
I thought
you were more capable than this.

64
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,199
Qing Yan,

65
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,560
you will not defeat me.

66
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:53,400
The King of Xiling is my sworn father.

67
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,159
My exile

68
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,680
was only a formality.

69
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:00,319
Get familiar

70
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:02,360
with these shackles.

71
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,719
Soon,

72
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,759
they will be yours.

73
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,080
Whose illegitimate child

74
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,960
have you brought here to flaunt?

75
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:17,639
Second Master,

76
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,360
I'm carrying your child.

77
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,319
My child?

78
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,120
How do you prove that?

79
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:33,919
Su Man'er, I know the exact kind

80
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,360
of woman you are.

81
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,360
You dragged your own sister
into your schemes

82
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,199
just to climb into my bed.

83
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:42,639
How do I know

84
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
this child isn't

85
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,199
from some random man,

86
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:49,479
born to secure your hold
on the Xiao family's inheritance?

87
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,159
Second Master,

88
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,280
I have been devoted to you.

89
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:57,599
Devoted?

90
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,560
Wasn't it only to become Second Madam
of the Xiao Residence?

91
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:04,800
If you had failed,

92
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,319
would you still be devoted to me?

93
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,319
Merchants care

94
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,960
for profit above all else.

95
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,199
What loyalty can a merchant's daughter

96
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,600
like you really have?

97
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,160
Get away from me.

98
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:28,399
Don't dirty my hands.

99
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,279
Do you think I deserve this?

100
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:40,560
Yes.

101
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,720
But what debt existed between us

102
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:48,560
is now paid in full.

103
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:51,079
You're not my target.

104
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,199
I have no interest
in watching you fall.

105
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:56,319
You're really that kind?

106
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,319
Far from it.

107
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,480
I remember how,

108
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,480
when we were young

109
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:09,480
and discord arose
over our father's affair,

110
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,199
you said the blame lay with the men,

111
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:14,959
not the women,
who should not fight amongst themselves.

112
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,279
My sister, Su Man'er,

113
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:21,199
was never like other women.

114
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:24,399
But somehow,

115
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,759
she became the poor woman

116
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:30,319
betrayed by Xiao Ye.

117
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:35,560
I was too naive then.

118
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:39,120
I didn't realize that women

119
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:43,120
without a man to lean on

120
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,279
have no place in this world.

121
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:52,319
Did you know

122
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,319
Yun Juan died?

123
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,120
She was running a small noodle stall

124
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:01,720
to make an honest living.

125
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,360
Enough to feed herself and her family.

126
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,199
But Xiao Ye, with a gang of thugs,

127
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,160
exposed her affair

128
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,160
with him.

129
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:14,160
Unable to bear the shame,

130
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,480
she jumped from the city wall

131
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,160
and died.

132
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,160
It's my fault.

133
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,560
You did wrong by her.

134
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:30,160
But she was never defeated.

135
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:32,000
She built a new life

136
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,560
with her own strength.

137
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,720
Yet, in the end,

138
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,000
she still died under the insult of men.

139
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:46,240
Don't you see?

140
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,759
Women without men

141
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,720
can survive.

142
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,199
But women who rely on men

143
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,160
to save them cannot.

144
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,879
Xiao Yun's mother

145
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:20,160
was killed by Grand Madam Xiao.

146
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,839
What?

147
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,120
Grand Madam Xiao,

148
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,199
unable to act herself,

149
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:32,680
relied on her brother and sister-in-law.

150
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:35,439
When she wanted

151
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:40,360
to poison Xiao Yun's mother,

152
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,360
she had her brother do it.

153
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,959
Her sister-in-law was present,

154
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:47,000
and can testify.

155
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:52,600
Now, Grand Madam Xiao is likely
hiding her sister-in-law

156
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,120
at the Zhang family ancestral residence.

157
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,519
You'll be able to find her there.

158
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:00,560
I…

159
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:01,759
No need to thank me.

160
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,120
With this,

161
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,560
we are even.

162
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:14,160
Su Hua,

163
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:18,319
I don't think

164
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,319
we're destined to be sisters.

165
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:29,879
But being people
who owe each other nothing,

166
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,720
that's the best ending we can hope for.

167
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,420
(Exile to Qiongzhou)

168
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,120
Sir, is there any way
to petition His Lordship again?

169
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,720
His Lordship said you failed

170
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,120
to prevent Xiao Yun

171
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,559
from presenting
the evidence to His Majesty.

172
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:02,240
Xiao Ye being exiled to Qiongzhou

173
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,960
is already a lenient sentence.

174
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:06,320
This case is being personally overseen
by Empress Dowager,

175
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,879
so His Lordship cannot intervene.

176
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,000
However…

177
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,080
His Lordship said that
once the dust settles,

178
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:15,120
he will find a chance

179
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,799
to return Xiao Ye to you.

180
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,679
In that case, we are grateful
for His Lordship's compassion.

181
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,399
Ye has always been mindful
of His Lordship.

182
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:48,360
Second Master Xiao,

183
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:50,919
have you forgotten us already?

184
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,799
We could never forget

185
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:54,799
everything that happened

186
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,320
in the Xiao family's wood shed.

187
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,679
At last, some justice has been served.

188
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:10,960
Whether Xiao Ye

189
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,080
or the forces behind him,

190
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,759
all must pay the price.

191
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:26,180
(Letter of Release)

192
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:32,960
Princess Zhaoping,

193
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,360
I must respectfully decline.

194
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:43,480
Have you considered the consequences
if you refuse?

195
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,679
And if I sign, Your Highness,

196
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,200
have you thought of the consequences?

197
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:52,480
Long ago,

198
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:55,799
Wang Xianzhi tortured
the soles of his feet

199
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,960
with heated irons to avoid
marrying Princess Xin'an,

200
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,559
leaving him crippled for life.

201
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,399
I'm a general.

202
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:05,519
I have countless means of interrogation
that leave men crippled for life.

203
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:08,559
If you continue to pressure me,

204
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,879
I will not hesitate to do the same

205
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,559
to myself.

206
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,960
But tell me, Your Highness,

207
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:18,279
are you prepared
to marry a crippled man?

208
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:26,279
They say you are a brilliant general

209
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,720
with grand visions.

210
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,120
A man with great ambition.

211
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,879
But I must ask you this.

212
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,320
Am I so unworthy

213
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,080
that you would rather
destroy your own body

214
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:48,759
and forsake your future

215
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,600
than marry me?

216
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,879
East of the city gates,

217
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:55,919
there are ladies in abundance.

218
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,080
Though many,

219
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,120
none can compare to my beloved.

220
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:02,399
Your Highness is perfect in every way,

221
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:05,519
yet my heart is already elsewhere.

222
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,480
I know

223
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:17,480
your love is unbreakable

224
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,200
and unwavering.

225
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,639
But if

226
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,480
Qing Yan had asked for a divorce,

227
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:27,879
would you

228
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,519
still harm yourself?

229
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:35,159
Qing Yan wouldn't wish that.

230
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:37,960
You're not her.

231
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,480
How can you know what she desires?

232
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,600
I shall offer her terms

233
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,960
she cannot refuse.

234
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:59,420
(Letter of Release)

235
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:12,759
Is that all?

236
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:16,399
That's all. Two boxes of gold

237
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:17,679
and

238
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:19,960
two men.

239
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,879
They say Great Yu houses
countless handsome men,

240
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:26,919
and now I've seen for myself.

241
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,279
I've heard tales of great men.

242
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,759
Rong Ziyu in the south

243
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:34,679
and Guan Peigong in the north.

244
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,799
How do

245
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,559
these two compare?

246
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,000
These two men are Ziyu and Peigong.

247
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,960
A woman knows a woman best.

248
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:54,720
Your Highness, you are generous indeed.

249
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,200
I've been married four times before.

250
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,799
I know well

251
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,919
how easy it is to wed,
but how hard to bond as one.

252
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,039
If I'm

253
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,519
to sever your bond with your husband,

254
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:09,080
I must be willing to offer enough
to guarantee comfort

255
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:10,919
for the rest of your life.

256
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,480
Since Your Highness is so understanding,

257
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:18,000
I will accept without objection.

258
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,240
So you agree

259
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,279
to the divorce from Xiao Yun?
