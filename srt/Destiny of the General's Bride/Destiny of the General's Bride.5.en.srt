00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,620
=Destiny of the General's Bride=

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,020
=Episode 5=

3
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:32,960
If you want

4
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,359
to move out now...

5
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:36,200
I won't move.

6
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:43,560
I won't move.

7
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,799
That day you asked me

8
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:49,079
whether Xiao Ye had dishonored me.

9
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,079
Yes,

10
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,039
Xiao Ye violated me.

11
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,520
Now you ask me this,

12
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:03,320
do you despise me as tainted

13
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,120
unworthy of being your wife?

14
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,319
Unfortunately, I

15
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,359
was born without shame.

16
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:13,439
The one who should feel shame

17
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:15,439
was never you.

18
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:20,519
Hua once told me,

19
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,640
for a woman in this world,

20
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,799
there are hardships men can't imagine.

21
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:33,120
This world has countless hardships.

22
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:35,480
If beaten, fight back.

23
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:36,760
If cursed, retort.

24
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,040
Return it all

25
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,200
and the bitterness fades.

26
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:42,400
Indeed, Xiao Ye violated me.

27
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:44,599
But from this day on,

28
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,519
I will never again give him

29
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:47,920
the chance to hurt me.

30
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:50,560
What do you wish me to do?

31
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,200
You married me,

32
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,120
brought me into the Xiao Residence,

33
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:57,799
that is kindness enough.

34
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,560
From here on,

35
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:01,640
I won't trouble you further.

36
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:03,840
This is my own matter,

37
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,359
I can handle it myself.

38
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,000
In the future,

39
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:09,680
I won't trouble you either.

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,800
General,

41
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:16,319
I'm tired, perhaps

42
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,599
you should return first.

43
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,280
Alright.

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,680
(Hua.)

45
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,360
(Since this is the path you chose,)

46
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:42,560
(I will surely stay by you)

47
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,400
(and walk it together.)

48
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,439
Place some trusted men

49
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,120
to watch every move in the residence,

50
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:07,759
report to me at once.

51
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:08,759
Yes.

52
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,439
Ye, does it hurt?

53
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:18,560
Lose a finger

54
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,360
and you'll know the pain.

55
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:22,360
Rest assured, Ye.

56
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:23,919
I will seek this justice

57
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,000
for you.

58
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:28,000
This time, chopping Xiao Ye's hand

59
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:29,599
finally vented some anger.

60
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:32,000
Do you feel any relief?

61
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,639
Have you let go of your burden?

62
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:40,120
Compared with those women

63
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,199
Xiao Ye harmed before,

64
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,680
what is a single severed finger?

65
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,280
Moreover,

66
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:46,960
there is still one person

67
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,680
who hasn't been punished.

68
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:51,719
Su Man'er.

69
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,500
(Xiao Residence)

70
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:57,800
Let me in.

71
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,759
By the General's order,

72
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:00,840
no one from Second Master's household
may approach Madam.

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,159
Please forgive us, Second Madam.

74
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:07,560
Isn't this going too far?

75
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,960
Tell me, what did I do that
was excessive?

76
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,159
You slandered Ye yesterday

77
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,360
and now you've cut off our silver today.

78
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,319
Can't you

79
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,639
leave us a way to survive?

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,319
My sister never slandered Xiao Ye.

81
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,480
- It was you who first...
-  Nan Jiang.

82
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,959
In this life,

83
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,439
one should

84
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,680
never justify themselves to outsiders.

85
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,920
You're right.

86
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,560
You claims I framed Xiao Ye?

87
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,160
Then go report to the magistrate.

88
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:38,959
As for this household silver,

89
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:40,920
it came from my dowry.

90
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,600
So whomever I give it to

91
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,959
and however much, is my decision.

92
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:48,079
If you're dissatisfied,

93
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,319
you may also report it.

94
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:50,800
Nan Jiang, let's go.

95
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,879
Check the account books.

96
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,639
You were allowed to manage the household

97
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:55,560
because you promised

98
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,319
to contribute all your dowry
to the residence.

99
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,199
Now, having taken the Matriarch's seat,

100
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,879
you turn your back and deny us?

101
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,560
These daily meals

102
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,519
all come from my dowry.

103
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,839
Why didn't they reach
Second Master's household?

104
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:12,240
You only gave us one bun.

105
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,160
Ye is a man,

106
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,319
how could he be full?

107
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,240
If you had tasted

108
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,800
the bitterness of hunger,

109
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,000
you would know how hard

110
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,120
we live.

111
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,879
Her tears come so easily.

112
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,920
Remarkable.

113
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,160
Could she be the reincarnation
of a rain god?

114
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,560
I've heard this speech
for over ten years.

115
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,040
My ears have calluses.

116
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,319
Sounds like she's gone.

117
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:50,920
No, wait.

118
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,759
Su Man'er

119
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,720
never gives up until she gets her way.

120
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:57,040
This time she made a scene,

121
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,959
yet left empty-handed.

122
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,040
Unless...

123
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,279
Unless she's stalling for time.

124
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,680
Stalling for time?

125
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,240
Grand Madam Xiao placed Yun Juan

126
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,560
by our side

127
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,959
just to wait until our accounts slip,

128
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:13,040
then catch our mistakes.

129
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,759
Now the money is in our hands.

130
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,639
Only a silly girl like Yun Juan

131
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:19,759
would steal it for them.

132
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:39,480
Looks like no one came.

133
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,160
If Yun Juan didn't take the money,

134
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,000
then why did Su Man'er come

135
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,040
to make a scene?

136
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,980
(Sealed)

137
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,839
Yesterday Yun Juan came
for the storeroom key.

138
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,879
I knew I shouldn't have given it to her.

139
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,160
Since they want to catch our mistakes,

140
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,079
we'll catch theirs too.

141
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:11,720
She took so much money,

142
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,240
surely to gamble again.

143
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:16,160
Go and follow her.

144
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,620
(Sealed)

145
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:28,680
Second Master.

146
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,279
I already gave you the money.

147
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,759
My body has long been yours as well.

148
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,279
When will you

149
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:41,240
raise me as a concubine?

150
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,959
Wait.

151
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:47,800
Just wait a little longer.

152
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,920
You once said,

153
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:53,160
a man must marry a wife
before taking a concubine.

154
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,040
I agreed.

155
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,199
But after Second Madam
entered the house,

156
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,040
you said Qing Yan took the money,

157
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,600
so had none to prepare for me.

158
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:03,160
I didn't care for such arrangements,

159
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,519
only wished to live with you in peace.

160
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:07,480
Yet now you ask me to wait again.

161
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,040
Wait until when?

162
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:10,800
Until I'm buried,

163
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,319
and only then raise
my memorial tablet as concubine?

164
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:21,240
What?

165
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,199
My little Yun Juan is crying?

166
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:31,759
You know,

167
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,440
my words carry little weight now.

168
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,080
I must

169
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,720
discuss this matter with Su Man'er.

170
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:41,320
You're lying.

171
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,639
Second Madam clearly likes me.

172
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,440
That day she helped me
hold back Qing Yan.

173
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,000
She even said

174
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:49,759
we are family sooner or later.

175
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,639
It's only right to help each other.

176
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,919
I think,

177
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,080
you're just heartless,

178
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,480
and don't want me anymore.

179
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,080
Second Master.

180
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,159
A woman must know when to resist.

181
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,919
Like this,

182
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,240
you're more interesting than before.

183
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,600
Second Master.

184
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,720
Second Master.

185
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,960
I was wrong, Second Master!

186
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,799
Yun Juan.

187
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,399
You think I've spoiled you?

188
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:30,279
I was wrong, Second Master!

189
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:32,120
Everyone dares to step on me!

190
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,600
Su Man'er throws me a face,

191
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,000
you don't respect me,

192
