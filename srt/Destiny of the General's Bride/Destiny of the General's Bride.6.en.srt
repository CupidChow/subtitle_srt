00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,620
=Destiny of the General's Bride=

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,020
=Episode 6=

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,720
They took the money

4
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:16,839
but didn't go gambling.

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,640
Surprisingly, they didn't go to gamble.

6
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:21,199
They went to the incense shop instead.

7
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:23,800
What scheme

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,079
are they hiding?

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,239
So, what should we do next?

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,920
We must find out

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,359
Xiao Lian's whereabouts from Yun Juan.

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,159
Tomorrow, the two of us
will meet Yun Juan.

13
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,719
Yun Juan is getting more
and more reckless.

14
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,679
She skipped morning duties again.

15
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,240
Sir, let me introduce.

16
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,300
This is the First Madam
of my elder brother.

17
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:58,960
Madam.

18
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,719
I've already helped
Miss Yun Juan dress her wounds.

19
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:04,959
Miss Yun Juan's injuries are serious.

20
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,719
She needs complete rest
for these months.

21
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:07,719
No running around.

22
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,719
I'll see you out, sir.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,400
Don't let me catch you.

24
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:17,359
You...

25
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:19,879
Nan Jiang.

26
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:21,840
Go fetch a basin of clean warm water.

27
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,840
Your Yun Concubine is fine now.

28
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:37,400
What Yun Concubine?

29
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:39,400
She doesn't even deserve
to be my concubine.

30
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,719
I only need my main wife.

31
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,719
You sure have a sweet tongue.

32
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,680
But sadly,

33
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,799
you're not trustworthy.

34
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,599
Man'er.

35
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,120
Yun Juan has stolen money,

36
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:58,480
the incense was bought as well,

37
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,519
brought Qing Yan into the scheme too.

38
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:04,599
But what should we do next?

39
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:05,840
It depends

40
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,840
if you have the courage.

41
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,080
Why does this incense burn so strongly?

42
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:30,479
This incense is called
"Snow on the Branch".

43
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:32,800
It's not only strong,

44
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:35,879
it can also kill.

45
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,400
Yun Juan,

46
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:41,280
have you ever thought

47
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:43,000
why you stole money from the warehouse,

48
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,280
and why Su Man'er helped delay the time?

49
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:49,840
If this matter

50
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,080
is settled,

51
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,360
they'll spend the money,

52
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,879
and it fails, then it's
because your hands weren't clean.

53
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,479
I don't expose you

54
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,800
because I care for you.

55
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,680
You are just a pitiful girl
who trusted a man wrongly.

56
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,960
Second Madam

57
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,039
is willing to accept me.

58
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,879
Has she ever urged Xiao Ye
to give you a title?

59
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,120
Did she ever publicly

60
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,000
acknowledge you as
the Second Master's concubine?

61
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,560
When you were beaten,

62
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,680
did she come to visit?

63
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:25,719
They said

64
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,240
in the future,

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,520
I will be given an official status.

66
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:31,840
If their lips meet,

67
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,319
you hand over the goods.

68
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,639
How could they spend real money

69
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:37,840
on you later?

70
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,759
Yun Juan,

71
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,599
never put your fate

72
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,120
in someone else's hands.

73
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,919
In this world,

74
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,919
all dependable paths

75
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,680
are extremely difficult.

76
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:54,560
If someone

77
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,840
lures you onto a shortcut,

78
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,120
it's an abyss.

79
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,400
One day,

80
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,400
when you realize you've been
fooled by a mirage,

81
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,319
it will be too late.

82
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,960
This world

83
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,199
is never fair.

84
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,879
As long as you expose Xiao Ye

85
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:19,160
for defiling your purity,

86
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,000
this can surely be resolved.

87
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:23,319
Yun Juan,

88
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,160
what I can do

89
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:29,160
is only tell you what to do.

90
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:32,040
I cannot help you take revenge,

91
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,519
because the real sword of revenge

92
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,920
is in your own hand.

93
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:55,439
Nan Jiang,

94
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:57,850
there's something wrong
with this incense.

95
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:59,079
Go get the General.

96
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:06,439
You gathered us all here by yourself,

97
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,240
what a grand display.

98
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,639
Why did Qing Yan

99
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,240
gather us here?

100
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:13,680
Grand Madam took pity

101
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,279
and entrusted Yun Juan to me,

102
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:16,319
to manage my household.

103
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:19,120
Yun Juan is indeed a capable hand.

104
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,519
I've benefited greatly.

105
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,160
But a few days ago,

106
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:25,480
Yun Juan was hit by Second Master.

107
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:28,800
Since Yun Juan followed me,

108
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,399
I must take responsibility for her.

109
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:33,199
She must not be bullied without reason.

110
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:35,040
If it spreads

111
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,639
that those who work for Xiao family

112
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:38,480
must risk their lives.

113
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,959
First,

114
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,839
I fear others may be disloyal.

115
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,120
Second,

116
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:44,759
I fear if it leaks out,

117
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,800
our noble family will fall into decline

118
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,959
and lose its rules.

119
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,959
If you have any grievance,

120
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,079
speak up.

121
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,600
Since Qing Yan wants to act for you,

122
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,519
you don't need to be shy anymore.

123
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:02,680
Tell me, who hit you?

124
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:08,360
It...

125
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,399
It...

126
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:12,600
It was Second Master.

127
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,639
Second Master usually cherishes women.

128
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,319
There must have been
some misunderstanding, right?

129
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,920
Ye, is that true?

130
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,360
It is.

131
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,040
Yun Juan, good child,

132
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:36,519
you've suffered.

133
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,079
Tell me quickly

134
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,279
why you were hit by this useless blow.

135
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,079
Second Master

136
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:47,319
came demanding his allowance

137
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:48,879
and smashed things in my room.

138
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:50,680
I got scared

139
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:53,879
and fell, injuring myself on the ground.

140
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,800
Yun Juan,

141
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:59,319
if you have any grievance, speak up.

142
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,879
I will back you up.

143
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,319
I have no grievance.

144
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:05,519
Second Master is usually gentle,

145
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,959
but that day he said

146
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,279
First Madam refused to give the
Second Master's household allowance.

147
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,879
They couldn't even eat properly

148
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,240
and were starving.

149
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,680
So he lost his temper that day.

150
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,439
Yun Juan...

151
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,879
I had never seen Second Master so angry.

152
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:17,800
So,

153
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:20,639
I got scared and fell that day.

154
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:22,879
Then why did you just say

155
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:24,480
Second Master hit you?

156
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:27,000
It was First Madam
who forced me to say that.

157
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:28,319
She threatened me.

158
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,759
She said the Xiao family
is in her hands now.

159
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:34,319
If I refused, she would sell me off.

160
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:35,519
I begged Grand Madam,

161
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,000
please save me.

162
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:41,680
Second Master grew up pampered.

163
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:44,279
He's never suffered such unfairness.

164
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,000
Mother, it's not that I'm meddling.

165
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,040
Since Qing Yan came to the residence,

166
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,439
first she refused to call you Mother,

167
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,839
and then

168
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:56,319
falsely accused Second Master
of harassing her.

169
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,639
She even broke one of his fingers.

170
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:02,319
Today she is forcing Yun Juan
to stir trouble again.

171
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:03,680
Mother,

172
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,600
though Second Master
lacks the First's military feats,

173
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,560
but he

174
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,519
doesn't deserve this grievance.

175
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:17,079
Man'er,

176
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,519
come with me.

177
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,399
You've suffered.

178
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,199
Qing Yan.

179
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,720
Thrift is a good thing,

180
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,240
but you did two foolish things.

181
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,639
First,

182
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,559
you were too harsh,

183
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,480
causing Yun Juan to suffer.

184
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,559
Yun Juan's injuries

185
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,360
are indeed serious.

186
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,600
- Mother.
- Mother.

187
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:53,480
The incense burned by Grand Madam
is called "Snow on the Branch".

188
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:54,759
Although in small amounts,

189
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:56,039
Grand Madam is elderly,

190
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,639
and easily affected by it.

191
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:00,279
But the poisoning is not severe.

192
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:01,919
Once the incense is stopped,

193
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:03,120
with some care,

194
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,120
she will be fine.

195
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,919
Nan Jiang, see the doctor off.

196
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:08,679
Yes.

197
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,000
Sir, please.

198
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,879
I must ask you a question.

199
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:19,679
Today's incense is newly replaced,

200
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,960
and previously it was all handled by you.

201
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:26,840
I wonder

202
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,159
what were you planning this time?

203
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,799
You mean

204
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:36,679
I tried to frame Grand Madam?

205
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:38,639
You woman,

206
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,919
your heart is cruel.

207
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,840
You cheat to take the family wealth,
and frame others.

208
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,480
Now you even want to poison my mother,

209
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,519
that's not surprising at all.

210
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,720
Actions require evidence.

211
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,879
Empty words

212
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,480
won't frame me.

213
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,000
Here,

214
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,519
it records what each household used,

215
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,639
and what money was issued.

216
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,679
You reviewed and signed all of this.

217
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:03,799
On this list,

218
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:06,919
"Snow on the Branch"

219
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,559
bears your signature.

220
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,480
In black and white.

221
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:12,679
Do you still want to deny it?

222
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,919
Guards!

223
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,519
Seize this woman for me.

224
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:18,639
Punish her by family law.

225
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:19,279
- Yes!
- Yes!

226
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,639
Let go of me!

227
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,080
Go!

228
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,720
Let go of me!

229
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,879
What exactly are you doing?

230
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,320
What are you talking about?

231
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:32,799
I clearly

232
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,799
haven't done anything.

233
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,720
I heard Second Master say

234
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,440
there's a peculiar game in that brothel,

235
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,600
- Let go of me!
- "Tiger and Leopard Play in Spring".

236
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,320
Let go of me!

237
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,120
The so-called "Tiger and Leopard"

238
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,279
- are the names of a cat and mouse game.
- Let go of me!

239
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,440
Let go of me!

240
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,039
The woman's clothes are stripped off

241
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,720
and put into a sack.

242
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,559
Then the "Tiger and Leopard" are put in.

243
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,960
The tiger and leopard play together,

244
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,799
- creating an unusual scene.
- Let go of me!
