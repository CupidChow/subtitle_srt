00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,620
=Destiny of the General's Bride=

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,020
=Episode 3=

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,759
So,

4
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,199
after Hua died,

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,000
she was buried here.

6
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:23,320
She was buried here?

7
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:27,280
She was buried alive!

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,039
Yun, save me.

9
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:41,759
Yun,

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,840
save me.

11
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:51,960
Hua.

12
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:54,960
Hua.

13
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,520
General.

14
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:57,520
I was late.

15
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,759
I should've come for you.

16
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:01,960
Hua.

17
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,079
If the heart is as steadfast
as the hairpiece,

18
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,840
the twain shall meet,
be it in heaven or on earth.

19
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,840
But you

20
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,519
never came.

21
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:28,560
She isn't dead.

22
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:31,680
Right?

23
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,200
Yun even defied Mother

24
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,239
to marry you.

25
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,079
Yet now he isn't here
for the tea ceremony.

26
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:43,159
Does he really care about you

27
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:45,040
or not?

28
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,519
I wonder why I was called here,
Grand Madam Xiao.

29
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,159
Though you're unworthy,

30
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:52,359
since you've entered this family,

31
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,120
how could you call her
"Grand Madam Xiao"?

32
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:57,040
Do you even think?

33
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,680
You really are foolish.

34
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,879
My husband still calls her
"Grand Madam Xiao".

35
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,959
As his wife,

36
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,879
how could I dare call her "Mother"?

37
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,640
You had no parents' consent,

38
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,719
no matchmaker's word,

39
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,599
and didn't finish the wedding rites.

40
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:11,960
You were just brought in

41
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:14,039
on a red sedan chair

42
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,080
into the house.

43
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,719
You're in no place to call me "Mother".

44
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,520
Besides, you were born low.

45
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,520
You can't be a proper wife,

46
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:24,879
nor can your children study
and sit the exaMiss

47
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,039
Yet you put on airs

48
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:28,159
as if you were
the General's principal wife.

49
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,879
Isn't that far too soon?

50
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:32,280
It's true I once entered
Mochun Gambling House.

51
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:34,560
But if entering there

52
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,639
makes one baseborn,

53
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,680
then Second Master

54
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,120
must be baseborn as well.

55
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,960
You can go and check.

56
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,599
Not only in Jiangzhou,

57
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,400
but across the entire country,

58
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,840
you won't find

59
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,199
my name in the baseborn registry.

60
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,159
You're Xiao Ye's mistress.

61
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:57,960
She was abducted into the Xiao Residence
by Xiao Ye.

62
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:00,390
She would've tried everything
to avoid them,

63
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,159
and she never would've recited
our love poem to you.

64
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:09,520
After that,

65
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:12,400
she was buried alive here.

66
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:14,879
The Xiao family wouldn't
let you witness it,

67
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,039
yet still spare your life.

68
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,199
Unless

69
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:22,080
both of you escaped alive.

70
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,719
And when you two met,

71
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:27,000
she told you everything.

72
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:31,919
Qing Yan has no record in the registry.

73
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,159
She appeared out of nowhere

74
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,000
six months after Hua's disappearance.

75
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:41,360
Qing Yan said

76
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:43,680
she wanted revenge
against the Xiao family.

77
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,520
But in truth,

78
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:48,560
it's Hua who seeks revenge.

79
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,840
Qing Yan is Hua, right?

80
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,400
Tell me.

81
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,719
Qing Yan is Hua, right?

82
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,159
(I was abandoned by Xiao Ye,)

83
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:11,000
(so I left the Xiao Residence.)

84
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,039
(After seeing
those imprisoned young ladies)

85
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,000
(treated worse than beasts,)

86
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,040
(I saved Su Hua.)

87
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,160
(Ever since,)

88
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:31,040
(she changed.)

89
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,480
(She stopped trusting men.)

90
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,439
(I taught her my ancestral skills,)

91
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:39,700
(the arts of face-changing
and voice-changing.)

92
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,079
I risked my life

93
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,240
to win honor,

94
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,279
so my mother's tragedy
would never repeat.

95
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:54,639
Hua,

96
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:57,160
I was late.

97
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,720
Who do you think you are
to handle the accounts?

98
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:04,759
Do you really enjoy

99
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,160
playing the matriarch

100
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:07,360
of this household now?

101
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,839
Besides,

102
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,600
your husband

103
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,360
recently lost

104
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,959
all the Xiao family's silver
and house deeds to me.

105
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,160
What money do you have left

106
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,560
to manage, Second Madam?

107
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,160
You!

108
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,240
Here, in my own estate,

109
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,279
I manage my own accounts.

110
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,839
That's not too much to ask,
is it, Grand Madam Xiao?

111
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:30,879
Mother, I've served this household,

112
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:32,560
and my efforts count.

113
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,800
What wrong have I done

114
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,920
to be attacked by my sister-in-law

115
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,000
on her second day here?

116
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,839
Xiao Ye holds no title

117
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:44,680
and contributes nothing to this family,

118
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:47,480
yet he controls the household.

119
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,800
This is against all rules.

120
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,600
Don't you think

121
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:54,000
you're small-hearted?

122
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,720
I fight for my share even when wrong.

123
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:58,000
If I'm right, why should I hold back?

124
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,120
Grand Madam Xiao,

125
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,279
why not check the household accounts

126
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,920
to see if anything's missing

127
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,600
or if someone

128
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:06,240
is taking more

129
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,120
than their share

130
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,399
and trying to involve

131
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,639
their family too?

132
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:14,120
Mother,

133
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,639
don't listen to her.

134
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:18,959
Yun Juan.

135
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,199
Come here.

136
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,759
I didn't want to tell you this,

137
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,839
but after Miss Su became Qing Yan,

138
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,839
she was consumed

139
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:44,399
by revenge.

140
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:47,439
I hate to see her suffer.

141
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,519
General Xiao,

142
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,319
meeting you,

143
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:54,079
I know you truly love her.

144
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:56,120
Please,

145
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:59,040
take her far away from all this.

146
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,079
Today,

147
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,000
I learned the truth.

148
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,839
Miss Yu,

149
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,399
please don't tell her.

150
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,160
Since Hua wants revenge,

151
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,920
I'll stay with her.

152
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:21,839
From now on,

153
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:24,800
even if she tears the sky apart,

154
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,079
I'll hold it up for her.

155
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,279
Grand Madam Xiao, it's true.

156
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,000
Just as First Madam said.

157
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:42,519
What's going on?

158
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:44,759
What's wrong, Mother?

159
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:46,519
You two!

160
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,560
One gambles away the money,

161
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,759
the other

162
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,240
funnels it to her own family.

163
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:53,560
What a pair.

164
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,199
Wait.

165
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:54,720
Mother,

166
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:57,160
this wicked woman framed me.

167
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:58,560
Grand Madam Xiao,

168
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,600
what will you decide?

169
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,680
I'll deal with you two later.

170
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,759
Sorry for the trouble, Hua.

171
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,319
But you're new to this house,

172
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,800
so there's much you don't know.

173
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:15,000
Yun Juan,

174
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,240
assist her with the accounts.

175
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,920
Do it well.

176
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,759
Yes, Grand Madam Xiao.

177
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:23,800
The accounts

178
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,160
are yours to manage.

179
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:26,480
Just one thing,

180
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:30,279
if anything goes wrong...

181
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,759
You can hold me accountable.

182
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,240
Second Madam,

183
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,360
don't cling to what you can't keep.

184
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:46,919
Hand it over.

185
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:48,440
Second Madam,

186
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,639
if there's anything I don't understand,

187
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:52,360
I'll seek your guidance.
