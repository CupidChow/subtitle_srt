00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,620
=Destiny of the General's Bride=

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,020
=Episode 12=

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,240
Second Master!

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,920
You must've made money by now.

5
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:19,000
You still owe me 137 taels of gold.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,359
It's been over a month.

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,399
Time to pay up, isn't it?

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,359
Get lost!

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,839
Second Master, don't think I don't know.

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,239
You made a batch of incense
to sell the other day.

11
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:30,000
Now it's turned into funeral supplies.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,559
No one's buying.

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,240
If I wait for you to sell it

14
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,320
and pay me back,

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:35,759
I'll probably be waiting until

16
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:38,799
my son burns Suhe Luo at my funeral!

17
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:40,399
You'd better pay me today.

18
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:41,580
What's all the shouting about?

19
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:44,240
Qing Yan, don't run!

20
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,560
- Don't run!
- Why would I?

21
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:47,159
I didn't take a loan.

22
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,280
Will you use your head for once?

23
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,560
Your mother is waiting
in the hall to question you.

24
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,320
What's going on?

25
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,319
I've only rested a few days,

26
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,640
and you've made a mess of things.

27
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:10,040
Well? How much do you owe?

28
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,519
A total of 137 taels.

29
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:17,879
It's only a little over a hundred taels.

30
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:20,079
No need to make such a fuss.

31
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:22,560
It's 137 taels of gold.

32
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,640
Gold?

33
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,879
You were blinded by greed.

34
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,079
How dare you take a loan
behind my back!

35
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,680
Mother, I was wrong.

36
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,680
But Uncle was so stingy,

37
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:35,280
I had to raise money myself.

38
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,319
It was all Qing Yan!

39
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,319
She tricked me into

40
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:38,640
putting all my money in.

41
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,280
What does this have to do with me?

42
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:41,920
When did I ever tell you to invest?

43
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,159
It was Nan Jiang!

44
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:46,359
Nan Jiang told me.

45
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:48,560
Why would she tell you
about such a good deal?

46
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,480
I don't believe it.

47
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,519
So you beat Nan Jiang first,

48
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,560
then when the investment failed,

49
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:58,079
you tried to pin it on me?

50
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:00,280
Sister!

51
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,680
Sister!

52
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:03,860
A lot of officials just arrived outside.

53
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:06,719
They say your husband colluded
with brokers to forge records.

54
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,319
They are here to arrest him, Sister!

55
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:11,240
Do you people even know who I am?

56
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:12,919
Officers!

57
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:14,280
Surely this must be a mistake?

58
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:14,719
Sir!

59
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:16,520
A mistake? None at all.

60
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,360
Zhang Yuanxing is charged
with buying his title,

61
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,719
corrupting the examination system.

62
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,280
The Prefect has ordered
a full investigation and arrest.

63
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,400
I'm an official of the court!

64
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,599
I'm the Minister of Revenue!

65
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:23,990
Take him.

66
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:25,639
And what if you are?

67
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,759
Whether a Vice Minister,

68
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:28,680
or even the Chancellor,

69
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,479
if he breaks the law,
he answers for it.

70
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,240
You vile woman!

71
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,240
I'll report you to the court!

72
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,680
Report me? For what exactly?

73
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,919
For lying!

74
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:41,120
I'll accuse you of deceiving officials.

75
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:43,719
Do you really think
you're a man of worth

76
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,479
after pretending to be one?

77
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,720
That post of yours
was bought with silver.

78
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,520
Some "authority" you have.

79
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:53,879
You're a filth from a den of vice!

80
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,240
I'll kill you!

81
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,439
Who was it?

82
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,479
Who dares touch me?

83
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:02,039
I am an official of the court!

84
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:03,919
So,

85
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:06,680
you've conspired with her to slander me.

86
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,039
Where is your proof?

87
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,919
No evidence?

88
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,719
Yet, you had
an imperial officer arrested.

89
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:13,599
When the King of Xiling hears of this,

90
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,080
your heads will roll!

91
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:17,039
I can testify.

92
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,340
(Xiao Lian)

93
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,400
Miss!

94
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,319
Miss!

95
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:41,199
Miss!

96
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:42,039
Look at me!

97
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,000
It's me, Xiao Lian!

98
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,719
Miss!

99
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,919
Miss!

100
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,639
Xiao Ye is nothing
but a worthless filth!

101
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:50,840
Miss, you have no idea

102
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,319
how much I went through

103
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:54,639
in order to find you.

104
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,879
You must not...

105
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,479
If you ask me, this pleasure house

106
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,960
really is a wondrous place.

107
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:06,039
It brought such a beauty

108
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:07,319
into this world.

109
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,199
Now that you're here,

110
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,960
you're never leaving.

111
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,639
Later,

112
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:16,600
Xiao Ye used his uncle's connections

113
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,120
to have me sold off to the frontier.

114
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,920
If not for the General's timely rescue,

115
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:23,000
I might have

116
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,079
died in a foreign land.

117
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:29,480
But Miss, your face...

118
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:35,600
Then,

119
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:37,720
I'll take my leave and give you

120
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,879
some privacy.

121
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:42,720
General.

122
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:45,639
The young lady is heartbroken now.

123
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:48,120
You should comfort her.

124
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:57,560
You knew?

125
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:01,360
You knew I'm Su Hua?

126
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:03,759
That I was searching for Xiao Lian?

127
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,399
Hua…

128
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:09,120
You've suffered.

129
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:12,720
When did you find out?

130
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:14,920
Why didn't you expose me?

131
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,480
You must have had

132
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,519
your reasons for all this.

133
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,319
I can't make your choices for you.

134
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,120
I only want to stay by your side,

135
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,879
to keep you safe.

136
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,959
But when two people are together,

137
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,439
they should make each other better.

138
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,480
I've already fallen into hell.

139
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,279
The two of us...

140
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,319
Perhaps we were never meant to be.

141
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,160
You haven't fallen into hell.

142
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,879
The ones who belong there

143
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,519
were never you.

144
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:03,639
You were only splashed with mire.

145
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,800
Wipe it clean,

146
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,720
and you're still yourself.

147
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,959
But I can't wipe it away.

148
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:13,800
Even now,

149
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:17,240
my heart is full of hatred and anger.

150
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:29,639
It's alright if you can't wipe it away.

151
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,360
Whether you want revenge

152
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,959
on those who wronged you,

153
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,360
whether you are Su Hua or Qing Yan,

154
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:42,959
you are

155
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,720
always the same to me.

156
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:53,480
Do you want to see

157
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,160
what lies beneath my mask?

158
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:05,839
What I want to see

159
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,480
isn't whether you're fair or scarred.

160
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,720
I want to know what you've endured.

161
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:16,959
I want to share your burden.

162
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:21,360
You're not afraid?

163
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:25,959
No.

164
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,079
The truth is,

165
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:38,639
most of the time,

166
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,879
I don't face it myself.

167
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,279
Back at Mochun Brothel,

168
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:51,439
I always asked Nan Jiang

169
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,480
to paint patterns for me.

170
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,439
After marrying into your family,

171
00:07:58,399 --> 00:07:59,480
I grew careless.

172
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:26,879
It's all right.

173
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,040
Even if you don't look, it's fine.

174
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:34,919
Sometimes,

175
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,320
I wish I could

176
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,000
face the person I am today.

177
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,279
Hua…

178
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,879
Don't worry.

179
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,039
I'll make them pay, blood for blood.

180
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:31,799
Sister, have mercy!

181
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:34,639
Please save my husband!

182
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:38,320
Sister!

183
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,159
Sister, please save him!

184
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:43,080
Sister-in-law…

185
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,120
How do you expect me to help?

186
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,639
It was you and your husband
who sought to buy a title.

187
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,399
Now, the scheme's exposed.

188
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:53,159
You must face the consequences.

189
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,559
Madam Xiao,

190
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,120
why quarrel with her in public

191
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,360
and make yourself a laughingstock?

192
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,639
This is all your fault!

193
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,679
Master Zhang brought this on himself.

194
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:07,200
Don't pin the blame on me.

195
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:07,679
You...

196
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:08,399
Enough.

197
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,240
At least you aren't in prison.

198
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,480
So, keep your voice down.

199
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:13,190
Don't bring more trouble on yourself.

200
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:15,120
Lower your voice.

201
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,559
You've embarrassed yourself.

202
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:20,159
Sister, if you'd spend some
money to smooth things over...

203
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,919
Don't you know how little I have?

204
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:23,360
What do you expect me to do?

205
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,159
If you hadn't insisted
on buying that incense

206
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,639
fit only for funerals,

207
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:29,240
my husband wouldn't be in this mess.

208
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,519
You can eat your fill of nonsense,
but don't speak it.

209
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,360
When I lent you money,

210
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,200
how you spent it on
buying titles or otherwise

211
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,759
was never in my control.

212
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:38,480
And now you come snapping at me?

213
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:42,720
Sister!

214
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,559
Madam Xiao.

215
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:44,799
I think it's time

216
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,759
this spectacle of hers ended.

217
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:49,519
I can't live like this!

218
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,759
You know full well
you're just a woman in this house.

219
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:52,799
I'd like to see

220
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:54,080
how far you get

221
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,360
without my support.

222
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,679
Guards!

223
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,260
Madam Zhang has lost her mind.

224
00:10:58,279 --> 00:10:59,440
Drag her out of here.

225
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:01,279
From this day on, this woman

226
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,759
who bought official titles

227
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,759
must never enter again!

228
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,120
Sister!

229
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,159
Mother, what is Xiao Yun playing at?

230
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,519
He brought Xiao Lian back.

231
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:22,919
Does he wish to doom us?

232
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:25,600
He and his wife have never

233
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:27,919
shown us a shred of mercy.

234
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,679
We might as well finish it.

235
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,440
We should get rid of them.

236
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,039
But with a scandal in the family now,

237
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:39,759
so many eyes are watching.

238
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,519
We'd better not stir up more trouble.

239
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,159
Wait and watch the moment.

240
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,840
Act when the time is right.

241
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,639
Hua…

242
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,720
With me,

243
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:02,720
you don't need to hide yourself.

244
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:07,799
Do you know

245
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:10,639
that before Lady Li died,

246
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,480
illness had withered her face.

247
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,560
She feared ruining the image she held
in Emperor Wu's heart,

248
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,360
so she refused to see him again.

249
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,960
But you're not like her.

250
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,440
Lady Li was

251
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,879
but one of many consorts.

252
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,120
You are the only woman I love.

253
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,080
All women in the world

254
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,240
think the same.

255
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:36,559
I may still carry
that weight in my heart.

256
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:40,120
Who doesn't wish to present

257
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,639
their most perfect self
in the eyes of the one they love?

258
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:44,559
Hua…

259
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:47,320
Whatever you wish to do,

260
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:49,519
whatever you want of me,

261
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:53,519
I'll wait with you, stand by you.

262
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:58,120
But I ask only one thing.

263
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:00,519
Can you

264
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,320
not disappear again?
