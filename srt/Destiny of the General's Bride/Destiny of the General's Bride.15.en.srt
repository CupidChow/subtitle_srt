1
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,620
=Destiny of the General's Bride=

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,020
=Episode 15=

3
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:15,320
My quarter is always simple,

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,559
no gold or jade about.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,280
I fear Your Highness
won't be used to it.

6
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:27,719
It's fine.

7
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:29,239
I've even stayed

8
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:30,719
on the bitter-cold steppe.

9
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,880
What can't I make do with?

10
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:36,880
You have to go to the trouble,
Miss Qing Yan.

11
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,240
It's all red.

12
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,479
There have been rumors

13
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:53,719
about my preferences.

14
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:55,520
True or false,

15
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,840
even I can't tell anymore.

16
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:00,719
Miss Qing Yan meant well.

17
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,640
That's why she spent a fortune
to plant these geraniums.

18
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,280
But Grand Madam Xiao,

19
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:10,840
you slapped her
without knowing the truth.

20
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,040
What do you take the law for?

21
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,079
I...

22
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:17,040
Madam, I have my own hands.

23
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:18,359
If someone needs hitting,

24
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:19,840
I can do it myself.

25
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,719
I wouldn't need you to do it for me.

26
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,760
Yes, yes. I was wrong.

27
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,120
I won't do that again.

28
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,640
I've wronged my daughter-in-law.

29
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:32,359
Debts should be repaid.

30
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,840
A life for a life.

31
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,760
And you think your promise is enough?

32
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:54,439
I didn't realize

33
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:00,439
you'd married such a sensible lady.

34
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,840
Since your wife's come up
with such a thoughtful idea,

35
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,239
why not

36
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:08,639
show me your room?

37
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,400
As you wish.

38
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,400
Miss Qing Yan.

39
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,360
My brother's courtyard is small.

40
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:21,879
It can house Princess,

41
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,400
but not Her Highness.

42
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,199
How about this?

43
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,960
Let me take Her Highness

44
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,120
to the Yingfeng Pavilion.

45
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:28,280
No need.

46
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:30,159
I've already found

47
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,840
an even better place for Her Highness.

48
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,840
Qing Yan.

49
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:46,120
You don't mean to put Her Highness

50
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,560
in this shabby little cottage, do you?

51
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,639
Exactly.

52
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:51,159
Her Highness is of exalted rank.

53
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:52,560
How dare you slight her so?

54
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,360
Your Highness,

55
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:57,479
I prepared this lodging
especially for you.

56
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,960
Please go in and take a look.

57
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,719
If you truly don't like it,

58
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:02,960
you're free to behead me.

59
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,560
Come, let's head in and check it out.

60
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:11,960
Mother,

61
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,560
is this still our woodshed?

62
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,840
Why does it look different?

63
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:17,039
Let's go in and have a look first.

64
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:29,520
Your Highness,

65
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:30,680
look at the wall.

66
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:41,520
I heard

67
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,360
Your Highness loves huaben.

68
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,960
Your favorite tale

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,892
is "Record by the West Window"
by the talented female writer

70
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:47,990
from the former dynasty, Liu Shuzhen.

71
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,039
That book

72
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,520
lost seven volumes.

73
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,639
No one knew

74
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:54,000
how the two characters ended,

75
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,159
making it a regrettable history.

76
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:58,240
This spring heavy rains

77
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,159
flooded several homes in An County.

78
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,759
Tables and chairs rotted,

79
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,159
plaster peeled.

80
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,360
Yet there was a blessing in disguise.

81
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,479
Beneath the wall

82
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,560
was a hidden treasure.

83
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:10,680
It seems to be the missing volumes
of "Record by the West Window".

84
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,080
You mean

85
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,719
this is where Liu Shuzhen once lived?

86
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,720
I feared being duped,

87
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,519
so I had the handwriting compared.

88
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,279
It does look similar.

89
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,480
But I'm poorly read,

90
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,519
so I don't know for sure.

91
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,360
So I had them

92
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:28,519
buy the entire house

93
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,439
and move it here.

94
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:32,319
Please enlighten us, Your Highness.

95
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,839
How extraordinary.

96
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,319
An County is hundreds of li away,

97
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:45,639
yet you moved it here intact.

98
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,360
You must've spent a fortune on it.

99
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,360
Above all, how thoughtful you've been.

100
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,959
No wonder Zhaoping
keeps praising you.

101
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,560
Even I can't help wanting to keep you.

102
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:59,279
Your ancestors must have blessed you.

103
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:01,120
That's why you managed
to get such a good daughter-in-law.

104
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,120
So you feel fortunate.

105
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,319
We do feel fortunate. For sure.

106
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,240
I'll stay here tonight.

107
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:11,160
Bring more lanterns.

108
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,720
I want to see

109
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:13,680
what kind of story

110
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,959
is written on the wall.

111
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:18,959
Your Highness,

112
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,079
how about

113
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,879
I have someone copy it down

114
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:23,160
and have it delivered

115
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,639
to the Yingfeng Pavilion for you to read?

116
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,120
Who is this?

117
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,360
This is my second son, Xiao Ye.

118
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,759
The original writing of Liu Shuzhen
is here,

119
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:33,879
and you'd send me elsewhere?

120
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,959
You really are a blockhead.

121
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:37,759
Why?

122
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:40,360
Can you read?

123
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,120
Yes, I can.

124
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,560
If you can read, why say such nonsense?

125
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,360
Your Highness, he's ignorant,

126
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,720
so don't stoop to his level.

127
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,480
I specially prepared

128
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,959
these fine fruits and preserves.

129
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,720
They were delivered here in no time

130
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,319
from your hometown of Huiyang.

131
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,839
You can snack as you read,

132
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:01,560
doesn't that sound delightful?

133
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,480
Good, good!

134
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,480
But

135
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,240
make sure the lanterns are brighter.

136
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,959
It's been ages
since I read by lamplight.

137
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,680
Where are you going?

138
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,199
I'm packing up

139
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,839
to make room for you and Princess.

140
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,160
You're handing me over to her?

141
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:32,319
You're a man,

142
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,480
not an object.

143
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,879
What do you mean by handing over?

144
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,480
Besides, your limbs are yours.

145
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,480
If I handed you over,

146
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,360
would you really just obey?

147
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,000
Fine, I'll pack

148
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,240
and go with you.

149
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,959
Please don't. If Princess
follows you to the Yingfeng Pavilion

150
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:52,279
and finds the gold and silver

151
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,160
I gave her are fake,

152
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,920
we'll both be done for.

153
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:58,519
So you really want me to stay here?

154
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,759
Like I said, staying here

155
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:04,240
doesn't mean you can't run.

156
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,879
How did I manage

157
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:12,079
to marry such a crafty wife

158
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,839
like you?

159
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,480
Here.

160
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,600
I told you to curry favor with them,

161
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,360
and you ended up spouting nonsense!

162
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,079
If you had half of Qing Yan's wit,

163
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:33,839
I'd already be a titled lady.

164
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,319
Instead, I have to clean up
after your mess all the time.

165
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,240
I'm not good with words,

166
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,639
and I'm not as shrewd as you.

167
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:40,920
You...

168
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:42,560
How satisfying!

169
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:47,600
Who'd have thought it?

170
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,040
She managed to resolve

171
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,360
the entourage crisis.

172
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:53,720
How formidable of her.

173
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,879
To placate Princess,

174
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,279
she even sold out her own husband.

175
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,720
I really underestimated her.

176
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,639
Mother, she may be acting smug.

177
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,639
Once night falls,

178
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,759
Xiao Yun and Princess
will blow out the lantern.

179
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,240
She'll be the one crying.

180
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,120
Mother,

181
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,040
can I get up now?

182
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,319
My knees are sore.

183
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,720
Mother.

184
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:22,120
Get up.

185
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,279
Mother, you're the best.

186
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,000
You're the first

187
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,519
I've ever poured liquor for.

188
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:08,360
Why?

189
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,480
Must I issue a decree

190
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,960
to make you drink?

191
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,000
Your Highness,

192
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,279
I don't hold my liquor well.

193
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:31,559
What a coincidence.

194
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,919
I don't either.

195
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,440
Hua, you say you trust the General,

196
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,519
but I think

197
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:55,759
you're scared.

198
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,519
Otherwise, you wouldn't
have dragged me out

199
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,200
in the middle of the night to check?

200
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:00,679
Don't talk nonsense.

201
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,039
It was because of me

202
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:05,120
that Princess caught a chill.

203
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,679
I'm bringing her the medicine

204
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:08,279
because I can't just ignore it.

205
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:09,600
Yes, yes.

206
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,279
You came up with that idea
because it's him.

207
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,840
If it were someone else,

208
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,320
he'd do it for real,

209
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,679
and he'd be Princess's consort.

210
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:21,759
How's it on Her Highness's side?

211
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:25,120
She's engrossed in "Record by the West Window".

212
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,240
She hasn't noticed a thing.

213
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,039
Why did they put out the lights so early?

214
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,960
Could it be...

215
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,000
Hua,

216
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,879
are we still delivering the medicine?

217
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:45,399
It's getting chilly.

218
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,480
Let's head back to Mochun Brothel.

219
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,399
Well,

220
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:02,559
what secret are you two hiding

221
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,120
