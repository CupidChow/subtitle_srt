1
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,620
=Destiny of the General's Bride=

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,020
=Episode 17=

3
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:17,239
Mother.

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,519
I've found Qing Yan's weakness.

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,320
Empress Dowager and Princess are here.

6
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,440
If you keep raving,

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,600
you'll lose your head.

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,559
The one to lose a head won't be me.

9
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:32,679
Ghosts demanding lives,

10
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:33,880
Su Hua returning,

11
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:35,880
these are all lies.

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,960
I've already uncovered the truth.

13
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,600
It was Qing Yan's doing.

14
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,600
She must have known Su Hua.

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,079
She only wants revenge.

16
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,880
Empress Dowager and Princess are here.

17
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:49,920
We must not let them succeed.

18
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:53,479
Burn the old evidence at once.

19
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,359
Put someone to watch that servant.

20
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:56,359
She must not

21
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:58,079
tell Empress Dowager anything.

22
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,159
Rest assured. I had everything ready.

23
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,599
And I've found something else.

24
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:07,719
Mother, look.

25
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:11,879
I told you so.

26
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,680
That house in An County?

27
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,120
That "authentic work" of Liu Shuzhen?

28
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,000
No way Qing Yan could've afforded them.

29
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:18,280
It turns out,

30
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,599
it was never from An County at all.

31
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:23,280
She just converted our shed room.

32
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:25,760
Are you certain?

33
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:27,280
See for yourself.

34
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:28,920
The soil is old.

35
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:30,719
No trace of being moved.

36
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,280
Now I'm sure.

37
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:35,200
This house

38
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,280
was never from An County.

39
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:44,879
Since she knew Su Hua,

40
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,560
and sought revenge for her friend,

41
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,079
we could give her a hand.

42
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,079
We'll reunite her

43
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,519
with her dead friend.

44
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,680
Excellent.

45
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:07,079
Another volume of
"Record by the West Window" recovered.

46
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,159
It can be passed down for generations.

47
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,000
When I return to the capital,

48
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:13,240
I will tell His Majesty

49
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:14,879
of your devotion.

50
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:17,680
Moving a house here from An County

51
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,719
is truly a remarkable feat.

52
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:27,879
Your Highness,
we were deceived by the evil.

53
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:29,680
We beg Your Highness's judgment.

54
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:31,960
What is this? Speak on your feet.

55
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,719
I dare not rise.

56
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:37,400
For Qing Yan has committed
the crime of treason.

57
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,080
I don't understand what she speaks of.

58
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,680
Please make it clear.

59
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:44,599
Speak plainly.

60
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:46,560
What crime has Qing Yan committed?

61
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,759
The moment I entered this place,
I knew it seemed familiar.

62
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,520
It looked just like the shed
of the Xiao Residence.

63
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,039
But Qing Yan claimed

64
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,319
it was an old house from An County.

65
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,479
I saw the writing on the wall.
They were old and faded.

66
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,759
I believed her words.

67
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,759
After all, this girl

68
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:04,199
would never dare deceive
Her Highness herself.

69
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:05,960
So I gave it no further thought.

70
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:07,240
Until...

71
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,479
Until Ye examined
the soil around the house,

72
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,159
and found it was all old earth,

73
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:15,400
with no sign of disturbance.

74
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:17,560
Only then did I realize the truth.

75
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:20,159
This little wench did the unthinkable.

76
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,759
There was never an old house

77
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,840
or the authentic work of Liu Shuzhen.

78
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,319
These were nothing but her lies.

79
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:27,800
She made a fool of Your Highness

80
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:29,719
by lodging you in our shed.

81
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:31,280
If word of this spreads,

82
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,680
where will Your Highness's dignity be?

83
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,199
What of the honor of the royal house?

84
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,039
Qing Yan,

85
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,400
what do you say?

86
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,919
Your Highness, do not believe her.

87
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,719
This house

88
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:44,520
was indeed brought here from An County.

89
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:46,479
I know not what she is accusing me of.

90
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,560
Perhaps

91
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,560
the Grand Madam thought
Your Highness favored this place,

92
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:54,520
and accused me falsely
so I couldn't claim credit.

93
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,879
Besides, if this were only
my family's shed,

94
00:03:58,879 --> 00:03:59,759
then why

95
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,960
would there be Liu Shuzhen's
"Record by the West Window" on the walls?

96
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,159
That is simple.

97
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:08,120
You had men
cover the walls with yellow clay,

98
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:10,840
then called in scholars of some skill

99
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,319
to forge the stories behind it.

100
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,319
It's easy to

101
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:15,159
make the shed look old.

102
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,279
Your Highness,

103
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,600
if you will have the clay stripped away,

104
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,600
I can guarantee

105
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:23,120
you will find fresh walls beneath.

106
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:25,160
Qing Yan,

107
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,759
this concerns the missing volumes
of "Record by the West Window".

108
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,319
I must be absolutely certain.

109
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:30,360
Tell me.

110
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,399
Was this house brought from An County,

111
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:35,639
or was it the Xiao family's shed?

112
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,360
I want the truth.

113
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:38,439
If not,

114
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:40,319
I will punish you
by the law of the realm.

115
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:43,160
Your Highness,

116
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:44,160
this house

117
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,120
was indeed brought here from An County.

118
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:47,480
If so,

119
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,560
then I will have the walls
torn down to prove it.

120
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,800
Otherwise, if I am deceived,

121
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,720
how can I answer
to the scholars of the world?

122
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,439
Men, tear down the walls.

123
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,319
Your Highness!

124
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,360
Allow me.

125
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,560
Your Highness,

126
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,759
this house must not be damaged.

127
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,360
This truly is the work of Liu Shuzhen.

128
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,160
If you destroy it,

129
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,480
it will be an unforgivable waste.

130
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,360
Qing Yan,

131
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,120
are you afraid?

132
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,959
My conscience is clear.

133
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:14,319
What is there to fear?

134
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,120
Then, we'll tear it down!

135
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,560
If this is truly a shed,

136
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:23,199
you could lose your head, Qing Yan.

137
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:40,759
Your Highness.

138
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:43,800
Beneath the old wall lies a new one.

139
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:45,240
This house

140
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:47,920
was never an old residence
from An County.

141
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,199
It was always

142
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,920
the Xiao family's shed.

143
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,360
You have all seen it.

144
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,560
I have seen it with my own eyes.

145
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,600
But, Your Highness,

146
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,360
did you see it as well?

147
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:07,560
You saw only
the surface of the new wall.

148
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:10,800
But did you notice...

149
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,920
the bloody handprints beneath it?

150
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:22,120
And that is only the beginning.

151
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,279
Your Highness,

152
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:28,480
please allow me to explain in full.

153
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:30,879
This place

154
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:35,480
is where Xiao Ye
violated countless women.

155
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,920
He not only defiled their honor,

156
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,800
but

157
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:45,319
if they were not with child afterwards,

158
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,720
he would poison them, making them mute

159
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,879
or blind,

160
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,079
and cast them into the lake.

161
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,000
So many women perished by his hand,

162
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:02,879
with no place to seek justice.

163
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:05,759
These bloody handprints are proof.

164
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:08,920
The Xiao family is powerful
and has no regard

165
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,120
for the law of the nation.

166
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,800
Since I lived under their roof,

167
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,800
I could not speak openly.

168
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,120
This was the only path left.

169
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,560
I had to bring Your Highness here

170
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,560
so you could witness it.

171
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,279
I beg Your Highness's pardon.

172
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,759
You made a lot of claims.

173
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,399
Where is the proof?

174
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:32,839
These are

175
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:35,399
the names of the women
violated by Xiao Ye.

176
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,160
Each one on this list

177
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:39,759
was linked to Xiao Ye,

178
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:41,360
then vanished without a trace.

179
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,120
Your Highness need only investigate.

180
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:46,439
This booklet must be her forgery.

181
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:47,199
A forgery!

182
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,920
Your Highness!

183
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,160
I, Xiao Lian,
will testify for Lady Qing Yan.

184
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,319
I, Yu Luofu,

185
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,000
will also testify for Lady Qing Yan.

186
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,240
Impossible! This cannot be!

187
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:11,800
Your Highness!

188
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:12,879
I did not do this.

189
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:13,879
None of this was my doing!

190
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:14,519
Not you?

191
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,680
Then who else?

192
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,519
Mother! Speak for me!

193
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:30,759
You know the truth!

194
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,839
These women

195
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,519
were never kept here.

196
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,600
And those blood prints,

197
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:36,480
those stains...

198
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,360
I already scrubbed them away!

199
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:39,799
They have no proof!

200
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,200
They have no proof!

201
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,360
Not kept here?

202
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:48,799
Then, where were they kept,

203
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:50,600
Second Master Xiao?

204
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,000
Guards! Get Ye out of here.

205
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:01,799
With a scandal this grave,

206
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:04,879
does Madam Xiao
mean to confine him for trial,

207
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,759
or to send him away in secret?

208
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,720
Mother! Save me!

209
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:11,720
He will be confined first

210
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,799
to await your judgment.

211
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,879
Your Highness, I beg you!

212
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,399
My son may be foolish,

213
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,919
but Qing Yan is truly vicious.

214
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:27,559
She already knew
the walls were stained with blood,

215
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:29,279
yet still allowed you to lodge here,

216
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,559
two nights!

217
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:33,000
Then, she wove lies
to mislead Your Highness.

218
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,240
Her intentions are vile.

219
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,200
She means to doom us!

220
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,200
Your Highness!

221
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:38,200
Qing Yan,

222
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,679
what do you have to say?

223
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:41,559
Your Highness,

224
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:44,159
if you will examine this case,

225
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,360
and bring justice to these women,

226
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:49,159
then even if my action
costs me my life,

227
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:53,240
I shall have peace in death.

228
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,480
Take them all into custody.

229
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:19,200
Qing Yan, oh Qing Yan.

230
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,159
I warned you long ago

231
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,919
that you cannot bring me down.

232
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,960
The King of Xiling has my back.

233
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:27,360
And who can save you now?

234
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:28,919
By tomorrow,

235
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,240
we shall see

236
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,200
which of us will end up dead.

237
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,559
It will be you, of course.

238
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:42,960
I have already presented
your crimes to the court.

239
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:44,720
What of the King of Xiling?

240
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,120
All under heaven belongs to Emperor.

241
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:49,720
Does the King of Xiling dare defy him?

242
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,799
Wasn't the plan going smoothly?

243
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,360
Why are you so angry?

244
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:11,600
Smoothly?

245
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:14,559
Did you plan to
sacrifice yourself all along?

246
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:20,679
I wanted you to see
that I have the strength

247
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:21,759
to stand up

248
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:23,480
for myself and those women.

249
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:25,200
I protected myself, didn't I?

250
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:26,960
Empress Dowager is furious

251
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,080
because you used her.

252
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:29,960
You stepped on a tiger's tail.

253
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,919
Do you not fear she will take your life?

254
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,960
Xiao Lian said that

255
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,320
when Empress Dowager
read the words on the wall,

256
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,399
she was deeply moved.

257
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,799
She couldn't hold back her tears

258
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,879
for the lady in the tale.

259
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:43,399
There are so many victims like us.

260
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:46,080
I believe she won't turn a blind eye.

261
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:47,919
Empress Dowager's heart,

262
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:51,600
like yours and mine,
still knows kindness.

263
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,799
But those in the palace
are hard to fathom.

264
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:58,360
She may weep for a story in a book,

265
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:00,159
but are you so certain

266
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:02,399
that her heart won't turn cold

267
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,679
after discovering the deception?

268
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:05,240
But I succeeded.

269
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,000
And if you had not?

270
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:08,600
Hua...

271
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:10,799
I already lost you once.

272
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,879
If I were to lose you again,

273
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,799
how would you have me endure it?
