00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,620
=Destiny of the General's Bride=

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,020
=Episode 13=

3
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:13,439
Hua.

4
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:16,160
Whatever you want to do,

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,280
whatever you want me to do,

6
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:22,480
I'm willing to stay with you
and wait for you.

7
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,719
Hua, it's Yun.

8
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:55,719
Yun is back.

9
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:57,439
He won't hurt you again.

10
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,679
Hua.

11
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:00,600
It's me, Yun.

12
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,159
Yun is here, don't be afraid.

13
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:03,280
Hua.

14
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:11,439
Yun is here.

15
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:12,830
Don't be afraid.

16
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,640
It's alright.

17
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:28,879
No rush.

18
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:31,439
We'll take it slow.

19
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:56,799
Now you've been exiled,

20
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:59,959
how can a woman like me survive?

21
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:02,879
Qing Yan.

22
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:04,319
You wretched woman!

23
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:05,879
Behave!

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,560
Officer!

25
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,319
Madam, General instructed

26
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,759
that you would be here

27
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,080
to see this man off,

28
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,719
and told me to guard carefully,

29
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,120
not to let Madam get hurt.

30
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:20,039
Don't worry, Madam.

31
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:21,319
I'll take good care of him

32
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,800
on the road.

33
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,680
You think if I'm gone,

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,319
You'll have good days?

35
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:29,479
Behind the Xiao family

36
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,770
are people you can't afford to offend!

37
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:35,240
Everything I suffer today

38
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,479
will one day come back to you.

39
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,960
Still showing off?

40
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:41,560
Officer, don't hit him!

41
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:42,840
What you suffer today

42
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,520
is retribution for your own evil.

43
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:46,159
How can that be blamed on our lady?

44
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:46,800
Enough.

45
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,919
Xiao Lian, he's already defeated.

46
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,719
We don't need to waste words.

47
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:52,560
Let's go.

48
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:53,919
Madam, take care.

49
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,199
Qing Yan!

50
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,800
Go, hurry up!

51
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:59,240
You'll face retribution!

52
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,680
Madam.

53
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:03,120
Please spare our master.

54
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:04,960
How can you say that?

55
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,680
That old man did evil himself,

56
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:08,840
the court examined him and exiled him.

57
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,719
How is it our lady's fault?

58
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:12,319
I know

59
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:14,560
I can't speak well, I'm clumsy.

60
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:16,400
But

61
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,680
if Madam could help a little.

62
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,840
Back when you two

63
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:22,719
bullied Xiao Lian and the others,

64
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,840
did you ever think of them?

65
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,240
I see you

66
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,280
as just a jackal by the tiger's side,

67
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:30,719
so I won't argue with you.

68
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,159
Xiao Lian, let's go.

69
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,820
(Mochun Brothel)

70
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,199
Thank you

71
00:03:59,159 --> 00:03:59,960
for today.

72
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,680
We are husband and wife,

73
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,120
no need for thanks.

74
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:25,079
Why did you bring me here?

75
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,839
You live in the Xiao Residence,
that place is full of wolves and tigers.

76
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,120
I worry.

77
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,959
I've bought Mochun Brothel.

78
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:36,319
From now on,

79
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:37,879
it belongs to you.

80
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,759
But Mochun Brothel

81
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,759
is a place that sells women's looks.

82
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,480
Yun.

83
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,040
You know me...

84
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,759
Those fallen here
are all pitiful people.

85
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:06,319
Yun.

86
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,560
I don't want to profit from this.

87
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,720
What about the people here?

88
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,519
If you don't want to see them,

89
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,879
give them some money and send them off.

90
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,519
If you worry they have no place to go,

91
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:21,480
and want them to stay,

92
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,680
whether to work

93
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:23,839
and run proper business

94
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,319
or just have shelter here,

95
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,920
it's all up to you.

96
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:37,959
I only hope

97
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,959
you can sleep peacefully.

98
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,959
No longer fearing to be framed.

99
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:06,759
With you by my side,

100
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,680
I can already sleep peacefully.

101
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,680
Someone else wants to see you
outside the door.

102
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,000
Come with me.

103
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:28,519
These

104
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,519
are all people once bullied
by the Zhang couple.

105
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,680
Now they all wish to thank you.

106
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:37,030
- Thank you, Madam.
- Thank you, Madam.

107
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,500
- Madam, you are so kind.
- Madam, you are so kind.

108
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:39,000
Thank you.

109
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,839
No need to thank me.

110
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:42,680
This is the punishment
the Zhang couple deserved.

111
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,399
You may go back now.

112
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,420
- Thank you, Madam.
- Thank you, Madam.

113
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,180
- Madam, you are so kind.
- Madam, you are so kind.

114
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,399
- Thank you.
- Many thanks.

115
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,120
Now,

116
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:53,959
only Grand Madam Xiao

117
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,140
has not received the punishment
she deserves.

118
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:58,839
You're so clever,

119
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:00,439
how could she escape?

120
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,879
But Yun,

121
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,600
I'm a little tired

122
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,040
of this life of schemes.

123
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,160
Why don't we just leave?

124
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,439
The mountains are high, the seas wide,
there'll always be a place for us.

125
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:13,319
What do you think?

126
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:14,040
Of course.

127
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,120
The sky is vast, the seas boundless.

128
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,800
As long as I'm with you,

129
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,240
anywhere is fine.

130
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,839
General.

131
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,920
Your resignation was rejected.

132
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:33,560
Why?

133
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,160
Speak.

134
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:39,800
By the Emperor's decree,

135
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,800
the Empress Dowager
will bring Princess Zhaoping

136
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:44,490
to stay at the Xiao Residence
to thank the General for saving her.

137
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,319
So the resignation is denied.

138
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,319
General, it seems

139
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,040
you've won the princess's heart.

140
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:51,120
Nonsense.

141
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:53,680
There's no such heart.

142
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,879
We'll leave right now.

143
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,079
The world is vast,

144
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,240
anywhere will do.

145
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,439
Yun.

146
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,480
You can walk away,

147
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,839
but your soldiers will suffer.

148
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,040
Besides, didn't you say

149
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,399
I'm clever?

150
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,240
Since I'm so clever,

151
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,360
how could I ever

152
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,639
hand over the man I love
to someone else?

153
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,759
Not even to a princess.

154
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:25,279
After the Flower Festival,

155
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,160
the Empress Dowager
and the princess will visit our home.

156
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,639
What I mean is,

157
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,320
let Xiao Ye be in charge
of receiving them.

158
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,440
He's but a commoner,

159
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:37,679
he must earn an official title.

160
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,879
This is the perfect chance.

161
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,519
If Qing Yan has no objection,

162
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,840
then hand over the steward's token.

163
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,039
With just a few words from Grand Madam,

164
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:50,679
all the household money

165
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:52,159
ends up in his hands.

166
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,759
I'd say,

167
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:55,720
Second Master Xiao
may lack other skills,

168
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:57,720
but he has plenty of tricks.

169
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,279
Enough to slice into a whole plate

170
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:02,080
and drink a few cups of wine.

171
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,240
When the garden isn't even finished,

172
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:05,679
he'll have gambled the money away.

173
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,519
Qing Yan.

174
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,519
Don't look down on me.

175
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,960
I'll prove to you

176
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,559
I too can handle this.

177
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,919
Fine, then tell me.

178
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:18,200
How much is a candle outside?

179
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,120
Candle?

180
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:24,840
I suppose... Ten copper coins each.

181
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,120
Grand Madam.

182
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:29,519
If you truly

183
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,600
feel safe giving him
the household money,

184
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,639
then let him take charge.

185
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:35,759
When the Empress Dowager
and princess arrive,

186
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,120
and use our heads as balls to kick,

187
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,399
it'll count as loyalty.

188
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,759
Qing Yan.

189
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,590
This matter of receiving them

190
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,440
will still fall to you.

191
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,320
I'll handle

192
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,279
the princess.

193
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:59,639
Why? What did I say wrong?

194
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,399
How much does a candle really cost?

195
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:12,600
Mother.

196
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,519
I… I just missed a zero, didn't I?

197
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,039
Now all that easy money

198
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,679
has gone straight into her mouth.

199
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,679
Princess Zhaoping

200
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:25,000
is not someone easy to deal with.

201
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,600
For sleep, she wants a jade bed.

202
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,120
For meals, she wants gold-inlaid bowls.

203
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,039
You think she's easy to serve?

204
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,240
Normally, if something goes wrong,

205
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:35,720
it's just a beating
and losing some silver.

206
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,840
But if this goes wrong,

207
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,840
then our heads will truly roll.

208
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:44,440
So you mean,

209
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,039
today you deliberately provoked her

210
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,519
to make her take on this job?

211
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:53,080
Don't worry, if she does it well,

212
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,480
it'll be the glory of Xiao family.

213
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,720
Naturally, I'll make sure you benefit.

214
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,679
If she does it poorly,

215
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:02,480
then it's her crime,

216
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:04,320
and has nothing to do with us.

217
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,620
(Sure to die)

218
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:17,360
The Empress Dowager
and Princess are carefree,

219
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,279
patting their bottoms
and coming whenever.

220
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,159
But us?

221
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,399
Poor folk at the market, no people,

222
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,320
(Silk, brocade, Shu brocade)
no money either.

223
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,799
How are we supposed to receive them?

224
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,370
I think the Grand Madam
is just making things hard for you.

225
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,400
Why don't you go tomorrow

226
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:29,860
and tell them to figure it
out themselves?

227
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:30,879
Let's not bother.

228
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,960
That won't do.

229
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:33,519
We already agreed,

230
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,879
how can we go back on our word?

231
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,080
Besides,

232
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,720
only if we befriend
the Empress Dowager and Princess,

233
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,280
will we have the chance to avenge

234
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,159
Xiao Lian

235
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,480
and those other wronged women.

236
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:45,679
I must receive them properly.

237
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,639
But they want so many things,

238
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,960
where are you supposed to get them?

239
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:57,080
I don't know.

240
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,360
But,

241
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,679
someone does.
