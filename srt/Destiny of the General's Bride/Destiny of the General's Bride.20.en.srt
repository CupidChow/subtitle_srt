1
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,620
=Destiny of the General's Bride=

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,020
=Episode 20=

3
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,400
Ruthless bandit and villainous commoner

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,679
dared to kidnap my Zhaoping.

5
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:23,140
(Zhaoping Princess is in my hands,
demand 500 taels of gold,)

6
00:00:23,152 --> 00:00:23,760
(or her life won't be spared.)

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,519
And they want 500 taels of gold.

8
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,359
Your Highness, forgive me.

9
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,399
I shall go gather the gold immediately.

10
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:30,719
We must ensure

11
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:33,119
that Princess returns safely.

12
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:35,439
Qing Yan.

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,799
Princess has already
given you so much gold,

14
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,759
if not used now, then when?

15
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:42,799
Your Highness, I believe

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,759
this gold should not be given.

17
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:46,159
Not give it?

18
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,000
Do you want them to kill Princess?

19
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,280
I knew you were tough-hearted,

20
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,159
but I never thought for a little money,

21
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:55,159
you'd even risk the Princess's life.

22
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:58,679
Your Highness, this wicked woman
refuses to give the gold.

23
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,119
She must be colluding with the bandits.

24
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,520
Why not arrest her now

25
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,560
and interrogate her harshly?

26
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,239
See if she confesses or not.

27
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,159
Guards!

28
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,400
Let's see who dares touch her!

29
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:08,799
All of you, down!

30
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:09,760
Yes.

31
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,599
Each of you,

32
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:12,319
instead of catching the thieves outside,

33
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:13,640
you catch your own people

34
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:15,000
and quite familiar with this.

35
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:20,719
Qing Yan,
you always have your own ideas.

36
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:22,359
Please make yourself clear.

37
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,959
Why can't this gold be handed over?

38
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,760
Your Highness, you are high in the court,

39
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:31,920
and do not understand
the ways of the world.

40
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:34,120
An ordinary woman gets kidnapped,

41
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,719
the ransom is usually
only ten or 20 taels.

42
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,040
Even if she's beautiful

43
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,159
and of high status,

44
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:41,719
30 taels is already the limit.

45
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:45,159
Now these bandits dare
to demand 500 taels,

46
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,280
I think

47
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:49,000
they must know
Princess's true identity.

48
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,519
If so,

49
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,120
is it a good thing or a bad thing?

50
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:56,000
It's obviously a huge disaster.

51
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,560
The Princess is the daughter
of the true dragon.

52
00:01:58,799 --> 00:01:59,879
Once released,

53
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,480
the entire nation will pursue the bandits.

54
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:04,879
With the Princess's description

55
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,599
and precise tracking,

56
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,000
the bandits will have no escape.

57
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:12,199
Your Highness, if you were the bandits

58
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,599
and got the gold,

59
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:16,159
would you release her or not?

60
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,319
So, once we release the gold,

61
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:27,319
Zhaoping will be doomed.

62
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:28,159
Exactly.

63
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:34,319
So, what should we do?

64
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:36,199
We can send a signal

65
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,439
to make the bandits think

66
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:40,520
that the one they captured
is not the real princess.

67
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,759
Then Princess may
have a chance to survive.

68
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:44,680
How do we do that?

69
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,319
We spread the rumor

70
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,520
that Princess will return
to the palace in one day.

71
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,960
You dare impersonate the princess

72
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,199
and deceive me?

73
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,759
Do you want to die?

74
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,960
I am Zhaoping Princess of Great Yu.

75
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,360
No need to pretend.

76
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,360
You are the princess?

77
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,879
You are the princess?

78
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,039
I am the Retired Emperor.

79
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:14,759
You...

80
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:19,039
Princess Zhaoping will leave
with Empress Dowager today

81
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,800
to return to the palace.

82
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,120
Impossible.

83
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,319
Grandmother won't leave me behind.

84
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,400
Who exactly are you?

85
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,199
I am Zhaoping Princess of Great Yu.

86
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,960
Boss, what should we do? Whom to trust?

87
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,759
The princess and Empress Dowager
depart for the palace.

88
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:48,159
Did you see it clearly?

89
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:49,120
I...

90
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,759
I just heard about it,

91
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:51,599
didn't see it myself.

92
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:55,439
Go check!

93
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:56,800
Go see!

94
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:57,439
Yes.

95
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:07,840
The bandits will doubt when they hear

96
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,000
the princess is returning

97
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:10,599
and come to check.

98
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,680
We will arrange the crowd in advance.

99
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,560
Only select the women

100
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:17,079
and men shorter than five feet to watch.

101
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,480
This way,

102
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,839
if a tall and strong man appears,

103
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,639
he must be one of the bandits.

104
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:31,800
Boss!

105
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:32,720
I've seen it clearly.

106
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:33,639
That princess indeed...

107
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,319
Who exactly is she? Speak!

108
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,720
Qing Yan asked me to give this to you.

109
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,279
Why didn't she come herself?

110
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,360
That's just how she is.

111
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,160
When there's something important,

112
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,800
she goes first,

113
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:20,800
but once it's over, she hides.

114
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,600
Letting others take the credit.

115
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:27,360
I still remember the first time
I met you,

116
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,560
you went alone into the enemy camp

117
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,959
and rescued me.

118
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,199
I had intended

119
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,839
to return to Great Yu

120
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:37,800
and thank you properly.

121
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:40,879
But you didn't give me the chance.

122
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,240
You left quietly without a word.

123
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,399
Since that moment,

124
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:48,279
I felt you were different from others.

125
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,240
I never thought

126
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:56,439
you learned from your wife.

127
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:00,360
Qing Yan indeed taught me a lot.

128
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,360
Since she saved me,

129
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,639
it would be unfair to compete
with her for you.

130
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,920
That would be inhumane.

131
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,759
I know all this

132
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,240
was not her intention.

133
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,560
But she did almost kill me.

134
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,279
It is an honor

135
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,160
that Your Highness appreciates me.

136
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,560
But this is only

137
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,959
a fleeting feeling.

138
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,120
Perhaps soon

139
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:29,560
when the Princess thinks of me again,

140
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:30,839
you will only feel

141
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,920
I am just an ordinary person.

142
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:36,560
No.

143
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,160
You are different.

144
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,319
How different?

145
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,839
You are highly skilled in martial arts

146
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,720
and you know how to cherish women.

147
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,959
You don't judge by appearance.

148
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:51,560
I was injured on my face.

149
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,560
Originally,

150
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:55,759
I planned to become a recluse,

151
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:57,360
hide away

152
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,399
and never see anyone again.

153
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,519
It was you who told me

154
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,480
I don't need to hide my scars,

155
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,519
nor see them as ugly.

156
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:07,839
Instead,

157
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:10,240
I should see them as my honor.

158
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,720
Because with my own marriage,

159
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:17,040
I brought five years of peace to my people.

160
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,560
From that moment,

161
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:23,360
I decided that if it were not you,

162
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:26,439
I would never marry again.

163
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,560
I see.

164
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,439
I have many

165
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,920
scars like these on my body.

166
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,959
I once

167
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,560
also wanted to hide away,

168
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:48,160
it was Qing Yan who told me

169
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,000
these scars are not ugly,

170
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,720
no need to hide.

171
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,879
They are my honor.

172
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:57,800
Because I used my body

173
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,959
to protect my country

174
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,480
and those I love.

175
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:13,399
I originally thought

176
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,279
if it weren't for Qing Yan,

177
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,920
the two of us could be together.

178
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,000
But I didn't expect

179
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:27,759
without Qing Yan,

180
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,320
I might not have fallen for you at all.

181
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,159
Do I love you

182
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,519
or the shadow of her I see in you?

183
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:44,480
You go down first.

184
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,000
I want to be alone for a while.

185
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:03,039
May all evildoers in this world

186
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:05,600
receive the punishment they deserve.

187
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,919
May Princess Zhaoping

188
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:11,200
soon overcome the terror.

189
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,639
I once thought

190
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,279
that marrying Xiao Yun

191
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,080
was your fortune.

192
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,960
But now it seems

193
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:33,960
it's the opposite.

194
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,360
Xiao Yun marrying you

195
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,720
is his fortune.

196
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,080
Your Highness, you flatter me.

197
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,960
It's just a pity you are not a man.

198
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:58,320
Otherwise, I would never
have fallen for Xiao Yun.

199
00:09:58,559 --> 00:09:59,759
He wouldn't even have a chance.

200
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:04,559
Your Highness, I don't understand
what you mean.

201
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:08,159
You are indeed remarkable.

202
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:10,360
Do you have any brothers at home?

203
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,799
No, I am the only daughter.

204
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:18,480
Then what am I to do?

205
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:24,360
I only regret that you are a woman,

206
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,000
yet in my heart,

207
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:30,240
I can never care for any other man.

208
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:32,679
You…

209
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:34,480
Your Highness.

210
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,600
Seeing you so frightened,

211
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,519
I feel I've regained some honor.

212
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:41,720
But

213
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,000
I am still a bit fearful.

214
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,960
I almost truly harmed you by mistake.

215
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:50,159
From what Your Highness says,

216
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,559
you don't plan to marry Xiao Yun?

217
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:55,879
I only realized today

218
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,600
that the one I loved was never Xiao Yun,

219
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,159
but the shadow of you that fell on him.

220
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:04,360
Since we cannot be sisters-in-law,

221
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:06,960
would you be willing
to be my sister instead?
