00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,620
=Destiny of the General's Bride=

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,020
=Episode 8=

3
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:19,960
How is it, sir?

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,519
Why does my wife keep having a fever?

5
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:25,960
Animals often carry filth
and impurities.

6
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,399
When these impurities
enter the bloodstream,

7
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:30,480
they can cause fever.

8
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,479
In severe cases,
it can make the mind dizzy,

9
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:33,399
and consciousness scatter.

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,479
I hope you will take good care
of your wife from now on.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,600
General,

12
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,479
Xiao Ye and Su Man'er said
it's late at night

13
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:57,679
and insisted on going back to sleep.

14
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:58,960
Have them

15
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,719
kneel in the ancestral hall to pray.

16
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:01,920
Alright.

17
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:10,079
Before Madam's fever subsides,
they must not get up.

18
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:11,840
Understood.

19
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,000
Hua.

20
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,359
Yun.

21
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:37,280
You came.

22
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:39,760
Hua.

23
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:41,760
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:44,560
I'm late.

25
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,760
I thought you wouldn't come.

26
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,920
Yun.

27
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:06,079
Did you recognize me?

28
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,360
I'm so afraid you'll recognize me,

29
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:14,479
and afraid you won't recognize me.

30
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,960
But the heart is as firm as gold.

31
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:24,719
We will meet in heaven and on earth.

32
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,039
But the two of us

33
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:41,680
will meet in hell.

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,360
As long as I'm with you,

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,159
in life or death,

36
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,400
what does it matter?

37
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,599
Yun.

38
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,680
Don't leave.

39
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,439
Don't leave me alone.

40
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,159
Hua.

41
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,759
You're sick.

42
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,080
I can't do this.

43
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,759
I'm fully aware.

44
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:40,840
Sleep well first.

45
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,879
Tomorrow,

46
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,319
when you feel better,

47
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,879
if you still make the same choice,

48
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,280
I won't push you away.

49
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,120
Okay?

50
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:12,199
Hua.

51
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,519
I don't know why

52
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,800
you don't want to acknowledge me.

53
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,160
But I know

54
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,920
you must have your reasons.

55
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:26,959
Whatever you do,

56
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,519
I will not leave you.

57
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,959
As for those who hurt you,

58
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:42,279
I will make them pay.

59
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,720
Xiao Yun is just the son of a concubine,

60
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:53,399
yet he climbed over you?

61
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,720
Kneeling in the ancestral hall,

62
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,839
even Grand Madam never made you kneel.

63
00:04:59,079 --> 00:04:59,839
Exactly.

64
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:02,040
How dare the son of a concubine do this?

65
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,839
Where are you from?

66
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,040
Do you know my godfather
is the King of Xiling?

67
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:17,720
I am a low-ranking official,

68
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,360
I don't know the King of Xiling.

69
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,079
All I know is,

70
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,439
if you refuses to kneel properly here,

71
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,560
once you leave this gate,

72
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:28,120
life or death is uncertain.

73
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:52,720
Such a mighty general's presence.

74
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,319
You made us

75
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:55,720
kneel for 40 hours.

76
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:59,279
If you have an issue with us,

77
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,639
you could just say it.

78
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,519
Why torture us like this?

79
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:07,160
This is the leftover spice residue

80
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,720
from Grand Madam Xiao's room.

81
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,000
Do you two

82
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:11,319
have any objections?

83
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:16,079
Actually, this isn't poison.

84
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:17,720
It's called "Snow on the Branch".

85
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:19,279
Rare to see normally,

86
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:21,639
used in wilderness areas
to repel mosquitoes.

87
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:22,720
Mosquitoes die instantly

88
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,279
and fills the whole room,

89
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:25,439
hence the name.

90
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:29,040
A small amount is harmless to humans.

91
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:30,439
But too much

92
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,720
can cause dizziness,

93
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,720
or even fainting.

94
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,920
Recently, someone has been

95
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,240
seeking this spice in Jiangzhou City.

96
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,319
General has found out
the spice shop owner.

97
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,879
Just identify

98
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,920
who has been buying it.

99
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,639
You don't trust us,

100
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,560
and want to re-investigate this matter,

101
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:57,279
I can understand that.

102
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,759
But the two of us

103
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,120
just want to seek justice for Mother,

104
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,839
not to deliberately frame Qing Yan.

105
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,879
If you don't trust us,

106
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:15,120
you can have someone investigate.

107
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,240
The two of us

108
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:20,079
act properly and uprightly.

109
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,920
Really?

110
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,079
Sir, please take a good look

111
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:36,800
who exactly

112
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:39,759
was willing to pay a high price
for "Snow on the Branch" at your shop?

113
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:47,720
It seems...

114
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,839
It was her.

115
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,759
It's definitely her.

116
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:51,360
She came to buy the spices.

117
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,959
Are you sure?

118
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,160
Yes, she has a wound on her forehead.

119
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,439
I don't clearly remember
the style of her clothes,

120
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,639
but roughly this color.

121
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:03,680
This outfit was clearly given to me by
the Second Madam yesterday.

122
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,839
Don't speak recklessly.

123
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,639
When have I ever given you clothes?

124
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,560
Besides, the spice shop owner also said

125
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,879
the person who bought the spices
yesterday had a wound on the forehead.

126
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:16,079
Clothes can be faked,

127
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,120
but could the wound on the face

128
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:19,759
also be faked?

129
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:24,759
Don't claim things you didn't do.

130
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:28,879
Yun Juan.

131
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:31,959
Grand Madam usually
cares for you the most.

132
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:34,559
I can't believe you would
do such a thing.

133
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,919
Tell me,

134
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,639
who instructed

135
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:39,320
you to buy such poisonous spices?

136
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,600
You are now working under Qing Yan,

137
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:46,200
was it she who told you to buy it?

138
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,960
If it really was her,

139
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,960
it's not your fault,

140
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,360
I will protect you.

141
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:51,600
Don't lead her on!

142
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,879
It was her.

143
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,919
Definitely her

144
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:04,279
who instructed me to purchase
"Snow on the Branch"

145
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:05,759
to frame the First Madam.

146
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,919
What nonsense are you talking about?

147
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:11,399
Ye.

148
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,200
You must speak up for me.

149
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,000
Enough!

150
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,679
You two women are too noisy.

151
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:18,639
And you too.

152
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,480
I warn you.

153
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:22,440
My uncle is Minister of Revenue.

154
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,600
My godfather is the King of Xiling.

155
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,039
You better recall clearly

156
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:28,879
who bought the spices in your shop.

157
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,639
If you deceive,

158
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,600
it will be a serious crime.

159
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,440
This isn't too hard to figure out.

160
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,240
I heard that although
"Snow on the Branch" is poisonous,

161
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:42,840
its price is high,

162
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:44,360
because the fragrance lingers,

163
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,200
so it's excellent
for killing mosquitoes.

164
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,399
Is that true?

165
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,159
Madam, your insight
is remarkable indeed.

166
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,279
Then it's easy to distinguish.

167
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,879
Catch a few insects

168
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:56,480
and see whose hand they die in,

169
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,080
then we'll know who caused
Grand Madam to fall.

170
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:40,399
You really have a clever plan.

171
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:42,519
I think the doctor in this tile house

172
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:43,559
need not spouting

173
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,679
some tired cliches.

174
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,080
Just tell

175
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,559
the story of how you poisoned
mother and killed sister-in-law.

176
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:51,279
It wasn't me!

177
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:52,360
Not you?

178
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,639
If not you, then was it your wife?

179
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,159
I see her hands

180
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,960
are perfectly clean.

181
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,679
So it was you.

182
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:06,600
You poisoned my mother!

183
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:09,159
Rushing to abuse private punishment,

184
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,000
are you afraid you won't live
until tomorrow

185
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,879
or that Su Man'er
won't live until tomorrow?

186
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,200
Mother gave you the steward's authority,

187
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,840
Su Man'er must be unhappy about that.

188
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,759
I interact with her every day,

189
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,039
so my hands naturally have
traces of "Snow on the Branch"

190
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,519
which is inevitable.

191
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,879
But her hands have none.

192
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,279
She has a guilty conscience

193
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:33,360
and washed her hands thoroughly.

194
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:35,639
Cui Liang also said

195
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:38,200
this spice is rarely found
in wealthy families.

196
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,990
Xiao family has had official ranks
for generations,

197
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:41,840
how could we have such a thing?

198
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:43,840
But Su Man'er is different,

199
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:46,519
a rude woman from a merchant family

200
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:49,240
naturally has such despicable means.

201
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:51,960
Xiao Ye.

202
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,120
Su Man'er is at least your lawful wife.

203
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,279
Betrothed as a wife,

204
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:58,279
or taken as a concubine.

205
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:02,279
I and Su Man'er never
had the three letters and six rites,

206
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,039
so what kind of lawful wife is she?

207
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,399
At most, she's just a concubine.

208
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,759
Ye.

209
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,799
What are you saying?

210
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:18,399
I'm saying you

211
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,000
are rude and despicable,

212
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,159
just a concubine at most.

213
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:23,600
Do you understand?

214
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,039
Do you want me to say it again for you?

215
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,120
You and I are

216
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,639
two grasshoppers on the same rope.

217
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:33,960
If you say I poisoned Grand Madam,

218
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:36,000
then I will say

219
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,080
that back then...

220
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:42,840
I naturally remember.

221
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:44,159
You

222
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:45,440
being lowly

223
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,399
with a heart like a viper,

224
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:49,279
dragged her out and sold her.

225
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,399
I don't want to see her for a moment!
