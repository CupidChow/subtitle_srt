1
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,620
=Destiny of the General's Bride=

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,020
=Episode 22=

3
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:20,679
There's news from Qiongzhou.

4
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,559
It's been found.

5
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:24,000
Second Master of the Xiao family are not dead.

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,879
He was taken away and hidden
by a group of masked men.

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,359
Who found him?

8
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:34,920
Someone who had a grudge
against Xiao Ye?

9
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,520
The messenger only gave me
this painting.

10
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,399
My son's fate is unfortunate,

11
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:57,479
yet he treats Your Lordship
with complete sincerity

12
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,359
I beg Your Lordship to uphold justice

13
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,359
and apprehend both Xiao Yun
and Qing Yan.

14
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,600
Even a thousand cuts would not be
too much, Your Lordship.

15
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,480
It is His Lordship.

16
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:06,439
Who is there?

17
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:07,719
Guards!

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,760
Don't move!

19
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:17,879
Hurry up.

20
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:25,159
Everyone step back.

21
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:26,719
Yes.

22
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,159
You dare come back.

23
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:30,920
Could it be

24
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:33,680
that you still want to seek justice
for your husband?

25
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:35,959
Your Lordship,

26
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:38,519
I've already found the killer
of Xiao Ye.

27
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,760
I ask Your Lordship
to restore Xiao Yun's innocence.

28
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:43,959
Very well.

29
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,920
Then tell me,

30
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,040
who is the culprit, exactly?

31
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,280
No matter who it is,

32
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,560
it's definitely not Xiao Yun.

33
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,680
Your Lordship.

34
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,180
(Imperial Uncle of Xiling
respectfully reports)

35
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:24,520
You actually dare to use
Princess to pressure me?

36
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,590
Your Lordship, how could I dare to use
Princess to pressure you?

37
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:29,159
Princess is close to me
and my husband.

38
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,879
She is concerned about Xiao Yun's life,

39
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:31,919
which is only natural.

40
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:34,479
I only reported to the Princess

41
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:37,000
to ask for her help.

42
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,319
Very well.

43
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,680
I'll give you three days.

44
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,759
Once the time is up,

45
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,639
if you cannot catch the killer,

46
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,039
don't blame me for being ruthless.

47
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,960
Nothing can be seen from this.

48
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,199
What does it even mean?

49
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:00,960
Those who faked Xiao Ye's death

50
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,120
are His Lordship's men.

51
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:04,199
They want to frame General.

52
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,159
Strange.

53
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,879
Xiao Ye has no more use.

54
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,400
So why would His Lordship do this?

55
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,680
Nan Jiang, I must ask Xiao Yun
for clarification.

56
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:19,319
I'll investigate His Lordship's
relationship with the Xiao family.

57
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,719
Nan Jiang, this matter is complicated.

58
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,599
I fear there's a greater
conspiracy behind it.

59
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,280
I don't want to involve you.

60
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,879
What are you saying?

61
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,199
You still don't trust me
with such a small matter?

62
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:36,759
Moreover,

63
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,879
I now have helpers.

64
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:40,879
Nan Jiang.

65
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,759
Look.

66
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,560
Now, I also have helpers.

67
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:54,800
You should be happy for me.

68
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,919
Yes.

69
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,759
Madam,

70
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,199
I will protect Nan Jiang well.

71
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:02,919
Have some snacks.

72
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,759
Have some snacks.

73
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,199
Stand there.

74
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,160
I said no.

75
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,360
Xiao Yun is already
a death row prisoner.

76
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,480
An outsider cannot just visit him.

77
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,920
General was once a hero
on the battlefield.

78
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,360
Everyone relied on him.

79
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,360
Now he's wrongly imprisoned,

80
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:38,519
and has become someone everyone fears,
a death row prisoner?

81
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:42,680
I only follow the law.

82
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,160
The law doesn't say

83
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,519
that ordinary people
can freely visit a death row prisoner.

84
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,079
Sir, haven't you forgotten?

85
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:57,199
There's another clause in the law.

86
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,800
Before execution,

87
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:02,680
a death row prisoner may
leave descendants with his wife.

88
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:04,959
Haven't you heard?

89
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,360
Sir.

90
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,279
Why aren't you

91
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,879
mentioning this clause?

92
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:13,800
Don't you acknowledge it?

93
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:43,160
Don't stay too long.

94
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,279
Yun.

95
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:51,279
Why are you here?

96
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,959
Of course because I miss you.

97
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:56,160
I think of you in my heart,

98
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,439
and also hold you close in my arms.

99
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:02,759
What?

100
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,600
My husband and I are about
to perform our marital rites.

101
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,920
Do you also want to watch?

102
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,800
How can you take such a risk?

103
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,120
The warden hasn't gone far yet.

104
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:58,680
You really have the mind for it.

105
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,319
What?

106
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:02,680
You...

107
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:05,399
You don't want to do that with me?

108
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,279
Xiao Ye is not dead.

109
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,160
His Lordship deliberately harmed you.

110
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:24,800
Did you two ever have a conflict?

111
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,800
Never.

112
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,680
It's just that His Lordship
has always favored Xiao Ye.

113
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,519
Naturally, he despised me even more.

114
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Every birthday,

115
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,360
the treasures Xiao Ye
received from the palace

116
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:38,520
exceeded even those of the heir.

117
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,720
The Xiao family's prosperity

118
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,079
was entirely granted by His Lordship.

119
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,199
Grand Madam Xiao is
from the Zhang clan of Langya.

120
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,600
How did she get involved
with His Lordship?

121
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:51,720
Unknown.

122
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,279
I don't know if His Lordship,
grieving for lost love,

123
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:56,360
lost his composure,

124
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,600
or if there's another scheme.

125
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:00,879
Qing Yan,

126
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,959
you must not investigate further.

127
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,319
I haven't given up yet.

128
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:10,279
How could you give up before me?

129
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,600
His Lordship and Grand Madam Xiao

130
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,199
are both not kind people.

131
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:15,560
They are ruthless.

132
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,759
I don't want you to get involved.

133
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,439
Fighting for the one you love

134
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,759
isn't a privilege of men.

135
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:26,079
I can protect you just the same,

136
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:27,800
and restore your innocence.

137
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:30,800
You must wait for me.

138
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,320
Promise me

139
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,600
that you will return to me
safe and sound.

140
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,399
Qing Yan is out today on some business.

141
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,159
I heard you came early this morning.

142
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,600
I just made some pear soup.

143
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:55,559
Try it quickly.

144
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:58,559
Let's talk about the main matter first.

145
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,320
Why so tense?

146
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,480
That rascal Xiao Ye

147
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,360
is actually His Lordship's
illegitimate child.

148
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:07,879
Is it true?

149
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,360
Absolutely.

150
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:10,960
I went to great lengths

151
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,879
to find out from Xiao family's
old servant.

152
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,960
That's why Xiao Ye and His Lordship

153
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,960
have been scheming together all along.

154
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,399
In that case,

155
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,960
the relationship between
His Lordship and Xiao Ye

156
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,759
is far closer than we knew.

157
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,600
Then Grand Madam Xiao...

158
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:30,919
Could she be His Lordship's lover?

159
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,120
No, that's not it.

160
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,279
Xiao Ye's biological mother
is someone else.

161
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,480
She passed away many years ago.

162
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,639
Since His Lordship
claims Xiao Ye is dead,

163
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,360
he won't let us find him so easily.

164
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:52,519
He's avenging his son.

165
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,360
Then what should we do?

166
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:56,840
You must find Madam quickly,

167
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:57,720
and consult with her.

168
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,679
She will have a plan.

169
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:03,919
Grand Madam.

170
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:06,320
Grand Madam.

171
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,519
Is it done?

172
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:11,080
I've already spoken with
the warden in the prison.

173
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,639
As long as First Master admits

174
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:14,240
that it was plotted with First Madam,

175
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,679
any method will do.

176
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:16,600
But...

177
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:18,320
But what?

178
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:20,360
First Master...

179
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:21,919
Speak quickly.

180
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,080
There's no unbroken flesh left on him,

181
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,360
yet he still refuses to admit it.

182
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:26,600
He says

183
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
that First Madam
has nothing to do with it.

184
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,360
Then change the torture method,

185
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:35,559
see how long he can endure.

186
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,360
This guy's tough.

187
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,840
He survived that night, 20 years ago.

188
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,919
