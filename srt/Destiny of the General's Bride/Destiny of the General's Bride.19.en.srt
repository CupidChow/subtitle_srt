1
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,620
=Destiny of the General's Bride=

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,020
=Episode 19=

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,199
So you agree

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,160
to the divorce from Xiao Yun?

5
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:32,320
I…

6
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,359
Do not.

7
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,359
But I want to thank Your Highness.

8
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:44,920
Thank me for what?

9
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,079
I thank you

10
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:48,719
for your righteousness.

11
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:49,960
For standing up

12
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,240
for me and those women

13
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,479
wronged by Xiao Ye.

14
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,119
To show them

15
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,240
they are

16
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,799
neither alone nor powerless

17
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,280
if they ever face harm or humiliation.

18
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,280
That they should trust in the law

19
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:04,920
to protect themselves.

20
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:08,120
And that men with ill intent

21
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:09,280
should know

22
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:10,840
that women are never tools

23
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:12,920
to be toyed with at will.

24
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:14,159
I see how it is.

25
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:16,000
You manipulated me.

26
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,319
Your Highness and I have our disputes,

27
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:28,480
but you have never struck me
when I was down.

28
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,799
If not for your pure heart,

29
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:32,719
no amount of manipulation on my part

30
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,519
would matter.

31
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,519
Spare me the flattery.

32
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,519
As a princess of Great Yu,

33
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:40,599
it is my duty

34
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,200
to uphold the law.

35
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:46,000
If you wish to thank me…

36
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,879
I've heard you became famous
at the Mochun Brothel for your gambling.

37
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,120
Why don't we make a bet?

38
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,200
What would Your Highness like to wager?

39
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,480
Let's bet

40
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,120
on whom

41
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:06,519
Heaven intends Xiao Yun to marry.

42
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,360
Tomorrow, we each hold a red thread.

43
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,319
Whoever Xiao Yun's fate ties
to that thread

44
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:13,960
is his destined match.

45
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,000
Very well.

46
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:19,719
If I win,

47
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:22,120
all the gold and Xiao Yun

48
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,560
will be mine.

49
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:26,159
And if you lose?

50
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,360
If I lose,

51
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,919
Xiao Yun is yours.

52
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,400
I will leave on my own.

53
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,680
But after I leave,

54
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,280
it's up to Your Highness
to win Xiao Yun's heart

55
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:38,560
and help him

56
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,759
gradually forget me.

57
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:45,120
If you lose,

58
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:47,080
it simply means

59
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,319
the matchmaker's thread

60
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,680
refuses to bind you to him.

61
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:56,800
Whether it refuses to bind me

62
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,000
or you remains

63
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,360
to be seen.

64
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,940
(Mochun Brothel)

65
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,599
Can you guarantee

66
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,879
that I'll pick you tomorrow?

67
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,680
Do you want me to guarantee it?

68
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,439
Do you really still need

69
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,120
to confirm how I feel?

70
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,319
Though I say

71
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:49,919
I'll leave your fate to Heaven's will,

72
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,439
I've never

73
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:54,000
truly believed in fate.

74
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,159
Even if there are deities above
watching over us,

75
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:59,000
they've long since abandoned me.

76
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,000
So when I set my heart on someone,

77
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,479
I'll tie the threads myself.

78
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,479
If I don't choose you tomorrow,

79
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:13,280
I'll carve a bloody path

80
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:14,960
just to take you with me.

81
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,360
But from then on,

82
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,959
I'll have no rank or wealth to lean on.

83
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,079
We'll face hard times.

84
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,079
But if we survive the storm,

85
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,959
every day afterward will be sweet.

86
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:44,079
If you truly belong to me,

87
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:45,480
then tomorrow,

88
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:48,839
I'll find a way
to make sure you choose me.

89
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,600
I knew you'd have a plan.

90
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:54,959
I promised

91
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,079
I wouldn't push you away again.

92
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,000
And I meant it.

93
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:12,360
General Xiao's wife.

94
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,560
Got it. We'll get her to you tomorrow.

95
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,920
Why are you looking at it again?

96
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,879
I know she's wearing red and green.

97
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,040
Put that away.

98
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,560
Yes, sir.

99
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,399
Madam.

100
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:33,360
The world rarely bends to our will.

101
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:36,279
Lovers will eventually be together.

102
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:38,360
Xiao Yun,

103
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,160
you can only choose one

104
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:42,319
of the two red threads.

105
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,279
Once chosen,

106
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,319
you must never let go.

107
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:50,519
Qing Yan or Princess Zhaoping.

108
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:53,519
The choice lies with you.

109
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,839
If you want me,

110
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:11,959
gently pull the red thread.

111
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,680
I'll give you three tugs back,

112
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,360
and you'll know it's me.

113
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,199
I choose this one.

114
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:39,079
I want to trade threads with you.

115
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,160
Are you afraid Xiao Yun will choose me?

116
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,680
I'm afraid you won't be honest.

117
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,800
I've heard

118
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,519
of your methods.

119
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,560
I could never entrust my marriage

120
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,639
to you.

121
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,839
What if I refuse?

122
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,680
Will Your Highness punish me?

123
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:06,560
Are you

124
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,399
scared?

125
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,480
Looks like you and Xiao Yun's love
isn't as strong as it seems.

126
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:17,839
I've heard

127
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,040
that true fate eventually wins out,

128
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,879
no matter how many times

129
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,680
it's changed.

130
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:26,079
Such an interesting idea.

131
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,040
Don't you want to test that?

132
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,040
Your Highness, your provocations

133
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,399
don't work on me.

134
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:39,319
What I want,

135
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,439
I will get.

136
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,519
Impossible!

137
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,240
It seems even fate itself
won't tear a loving couple apart.

138
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,639
Zhaoping,

139
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,039
there's no place for you here anymore.

140
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,080
Come back to the palace with me.

141
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:48,679
But…

142
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,440
But Xiao Yun clearly pulled my thread!

143
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:55,039
If I hadn't doubted Qing Yan…

144
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,519
Your Highness, it seems you were right.

145
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,240
True love

146
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,639
always finds

147
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:03,080
its way back.

148
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,320
Thank you for helping me

149
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,559
see my true match.

150
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,360
You don't really think a few tricks

151
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:12,240
can get rid of me, do you?

152
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,440
So, what will you have us do next?

153
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,240
I'm going to Father right now
to insist on a marriage!

154
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,600
We'll see what you do then!

155
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,240
I don't think this will work.

156
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:32,440
Her Highness has been
in the palace for years.

157
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:33,639
She's sharp and cautious.

158
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,440
It won't be easy to fool her.

159
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,000
If you pick my thread,

160
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:41,440
she'll definitely trade with me.

161
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:45,080
So you have to choose her thread

162
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,759
from the start.

163
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:52,679
But if she refuses to trade,

164
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:54,639
what then?

165
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,639
Then it's fate's will.

166
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,519
Though

167
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,159
I bet she's childish enough to do it.

168
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:10,639
She will swap threads with me.

169
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,940
(Xiao Residence)

170
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,799
You're the general's wife?

171
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,639
You have a good eye.

172
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:38,399
Why did you bring her here?

173
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,240
She… she isn't Lady Qing Yan?

174
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,399
She could have our lives!

175
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:45,120
You've kidnapped her.

176
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,519
Consider yourself as good as dead!

177
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,720
Let's get out

178
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,840
before she wakes up.

179
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,440
I never saw you,

180
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:54,799
and you never saw me.

181
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:56,039
What…

182
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,799
Who exactly is this young woman?

183
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,360
I, Lei Laosan,

184
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:06,279
never let a bird slip away

185
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,440
once I have my eye on it.

186
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:08,919
Boss,

187
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,799
why don't we have some fun
with her first?

188
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,120
Hold on.

189
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,240
Let me verify her identity first.

190
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:19,879
Right.

191
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,690
We wouldn't want to accidentally
