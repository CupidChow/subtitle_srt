00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,620
=Destiny of the General's Bride=

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,020
=Episode 4=

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:13,839
Mother,

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,000
it's true Man'er took some money.

5
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:18,199
But it was for her family's
urgent needs.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,600
She'll repay it later.

7
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:21,399
Urgent needs?

8
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:23,039
Her father is a gambler.

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,679
Always losing money.

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,160
When is it not urgent?

11
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,519
Then we won't lend next time.

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,199
Why let Qing Yan

13
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:31,239
manage the household?

14
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:36,280
Managing a big household's accounts
isn't easy.

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,880
If she wants to, let her try.

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,719
If she makes mistakes,

17
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:42,520
we can use it against her,

18
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:44,719
take back the authority,

19
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,560
and she won't dare

20
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,079
ask again.

21
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,920
What if she does everything right?

22
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,240
I'm smart,

23
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:54,159
but how did I

24
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:55,759
get a brainless son like you?

25
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:58,240
Even if she can manage the accounts,

26
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:00,119
her assistant,

27
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:01,159
Yun Juan,

28
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,280
is our person.

29
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,519
I'm slow

30
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:08,079
only because

31
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,560
my mother protected me,

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,480
so I didn't have to
struggle with others.

33
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,280
It's great to have you, Mother.

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,879
Well,

35
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:17,760
you always make me worry.

36
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,480
What do we do next?

37
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:29,359
Now we hold the household's finances.

38
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,040
Our top priority is to find Xiao Lian.

39
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,439
Back then,

40
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,040
she risked her life to save me.

41
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,359
That gave me a reason to survive.

42
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,280
I can't leave her behind.

43
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,359
Alive or dead,

44
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,120
I must see her.

45
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,239
Xiao Lian is also in the Xiao Residence?

46
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:46,400
Yun Juan

47
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,079
often does dirty work
for Grand Madam Xiao and Xiao Ye.

48
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:50,280
She should know

49
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,959
where the girls were sold.

50
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:54,799
Then,

51
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:56,359
we'll go find Yun Juan.

52
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:02,079
She's likely with Xiao Ye tonight.

53
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,120
She's still dreaming

54
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,120
of being Xiao Ye's concubine.

55
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,280
But no man in this world

56
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,960
is truly trustworthy.

57
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,759
Especially someone from the Xiao family.

58
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,560
Second Master,
you shouldn't drink this much.

59
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,120
Second Madam will be upset.

60
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,319
Don't mention her.

61
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,759
I get mad just hearing her name.

62
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:43,520
What's wrong?

63
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:52,719
Second Master.

64
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,800
Second Master.

65
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:56,960
Sit.

66
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,879
Second Master, Second Madam.

67
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,280
I'll stop here.

68
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:11,879
Dear lady,

69
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:14,280
we haven't even

70
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,400
reached the room yet.

71
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,319
Why are you leaving now?

72
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:21,319
Second Master,

73
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:23,000
ahead is your quarter.

74
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,800
I'm the Grand Madam's maid.

75
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:27,759
I can't send you there.

76
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:28,960
Yun Juan,

77
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,039
everyone in the residence knows

78
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:35,960
you'll be my concubine later.

79
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,039
It's just that right now,
you're helping my mother,

80
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,439
and I can't take you away.

81
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,840
Besides, this courtyard

82
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:45,840
will be yours.

83
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,479
What nonsense you are saying,
Second Master?

84
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,960
Second Madam is here.

85
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,159
Su Man'er.

86
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,479
What?

87
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,680
Do you enjoy seeing me with other women?

88
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:01,919
Get lost now.

89
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,240
Second Master,

90
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,639
Mother just assigned Yun Juan

91
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,360
to help Qing Yan manage the accounts.

92
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:15,719
During this period,

93
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,199
it's better to stop seeing her.

94
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,680
Hearing this really makes me mad.

95
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,519
If you hadn't taken the money

96
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:25,920
and been caught by her,

97
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:29,160
would Qing Yan be managing
the accounts now?

98
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,040
Get lost now,

99
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,600
jinx.

100
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:01,839
Second Master,

101
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,720
people might see us.

102
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:04,959
Wouldn't that

103
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,000
be more exciting?

104
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,079
Besides,

105
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,839
no one will be here so late at night.

106
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,319
This must be your concubine, right?

107
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:23,920
There are many people
coming and going here.

108
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:26,160
If anyone sees this

109
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:27,399
and the words get out,

110
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:30,199
what will Miss Yun Juan do

111
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:32,040
in the future?

112
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,079
Qing Yan,

113
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,319
you ruined my plans.

114
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,319
Do you know the consequences?

115
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:50,439
Second Master,

116
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,120
please show me.

117
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:07,600
Xiao Ye,

118
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,920
don't you forget

119
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,600
I'm the General's wife now.

120
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,519
I know you're the General's wife.

121
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,240
But do you know

122
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,639
my godfather is the King of Xiling?

123
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,600
Even Xiao Yun

124
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,480
has to kneel before him,

125
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:23,160
let alone you.

126
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,720
I'm telling you,

127
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:27,439
even if it belongs to Xiao Yun,

128
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,519
if I like it,

129
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,800
it's all mine.

130
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:34,720
I remember

131
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,120
that you stole one of my brocade socks.

132
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,639
You undressed in front of everyone,

133
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:44,759
and you weren't this shy.

134
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,279
Have you become cold-hearted

135
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:50,560
after taking the money?

136
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,240
Let go of me!

137
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,199
Soon,

138
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,879
you'll be crying and begging me
not to let you go.

139
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:29,519
It was that woman

140
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:30,600
who seduced me first.

141
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,399
Qing Yan

142
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:32,639
is a spoiled

143
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,600
and worthless woman.

144
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:40,279
She's nothing but a rag

145
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,759
who flirts with everyone.

146
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,079
She's filthy to even touch.

147
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,279
That's her true nature.

148
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,600
Yet you're confronting me.

149
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,279
Look at them, Hua.

150
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,360
You beat your own brother

151
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,279
for a mere courtesan.

152
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,240
Such a shame.

153
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,920
The Xiao family has plenty

154
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,639
to be ashamed of.

155
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,839
This is nothing.

156
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,519
You and your wife are so ruthless.

157
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,560
You've beaten and insulted

158
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,560
however you like.

159
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,959
Ye respects you
as his brother and sister-in-law,

160
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,319
so he won't hold it against you.

161
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,839
But

162
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,160
Qing Yan is totally unhurt.

163
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:17,959
My son...

164
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,040
You have no proof.

165
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,279
Even if you report this to the yamen,

166
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,959
you'll gain nothing.

167
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,920
How is Madam?

168
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:34,879
She's fine.

169
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:35,919
But she says

170
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,360
she won't see that lecher again.

171
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,399
Lecher?

172
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:42,679
How dare a lowly courtesan's maid
speak to me like this?

173
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,200
You!

174
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,200
Ye!

175
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:52,759
Ye!

176
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,840
Ye!

177
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:58,720
Xiao Yun, you!

178
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,360
Get lost.

179
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,680
Don't think I know nothing about

180
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,120
all the dirty things
you've done these years.

181
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:04,360
Ye.

182
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,399
One more word,

183
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,240
