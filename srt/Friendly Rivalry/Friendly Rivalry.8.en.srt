1
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,345
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:13,930
NO CHILDREN OR ANIMALS WERE HARMED
IN THE MAKING OF THIS DRAMA

3
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,354
Tell me what you promised.

4
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:23,940
Why are you not answering my question?

5
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:31,656
It was my dad.

6
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:34,617
I saw it in his office.

7
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:38,329
<i>I knew that he was in a medical lawsuit,</i>

8
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,415
<i>but he had</i>

9
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:43,752
more information than necessary
about you and your stepmother.

10
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,255
Isn't it odd?

11
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:52,552
If he were really innocent,
he wouldn't have needed all that.

12
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,892
What you can do for me…

13
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:10,653
I'll contemplate that.

14
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:17,994
It's cold in the checkup center.

15
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:20,830
Keep this on.

16
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:25,877
Congrats on ranking first.

17
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,895
Have you been sedated before?

18
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:45,605
No.

19
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,274
What if it doesn't put me to sleep?

20
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:56,491
Breathe comfortably
and count down from ten.

21
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:02,664
Ten, nine, eight,

22
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,583
seven, six…

23
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:17,095
Will you take a look at this?

24
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:18,555
Please.

25
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,599
Daddy!

26
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,852
Could you take a look
at this child's photo?

27
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:25,812
Daddy!

28
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:27,564
Hello.

29
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,732
I'm looking for a missing child.

30
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,192
Daddy!

31
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,904
Daddy!

32
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:38,616
Daddy!

33
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:52,690
Je-i.

34
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,526
Gosh, are you up already?

35
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,154
I upped the doses
so you could get some more sleep.

36
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,990
You could feel dizzy,
so go back inside and lie down.

37
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:02,992
Go on.

38
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,352
JU YE-RI

39
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:33,458
Are you already preparing
for the mock exam?

40
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:36,544
We're just done with the midterms.

41
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:38,755
Hey!

42
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:40,882
What are you doing?

43
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:44,052
If you mix these two,
it doubles the effect.

44
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,722
- You've never tried it?
- I don't want to.

45
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,602
Don't tell anyone
that you bought drugs from me.

46
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,396
Everyone else is my competitor.

47
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:58,316
Why would I let them know
this great method?

48
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:00,777
Don't worry about that.

49
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,582
<i>Ye-ri seems suspicious today,</i>

50
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,209
<i>so keep an eye on her.</i>

51
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:18,169
<i>Okay.</i>

52
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,006
Seul-gi.

53
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,386
You have to wear this
during a school festival.

54
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:31,849
See?

55
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,143
Come on.

56
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,972
What's wrong with you now?

57
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,060
Mom.

58
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,814
What brings a busy attorney like you
to parents' night?

59
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:25,361
They call it a college admission briefing,
but it's only for medical school.

60
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:27,488
Don't tell me

61
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,408
you don't know
that I'm applying for engineering.

62
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:32,034
Fancy meeting you here, Mr. Yu.

63
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,121
Hi.

64
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:39,625
Is it your intention
to keep postponing submitting evidence?

65
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:50,261
Go.

66
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:03,983
Do you know this?

67
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:05,943
Seul-gi.

68
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:10,865
What's this?

69
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:12,658
I'll show you.

70
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,878
Damn it, Seul-gi. Pick up your phone.

71
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:44,774
Wait, is this Mr. Woo?

72
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:46,817
Fuck.

73
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:48,653
What the hell?

74
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:57,703
Hey, Beom-su.

75
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:58,955
What phone do you use?

76
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,456
Why?

77
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,376
Just answer the question.

78
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,294
I use a Galaxy.

79
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,671
Let me use your charger.

80
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:08,798
I don't have it with me.

81
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,638
<i>Ye-ri, where are you?</i>

82
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,682
<i>Can you please come and help us out?</i>

83
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:18,808
I'm busy.

84
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,685
I can't go there now.

85
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:24,230
<i>Because you aren't here,</i>
<i>all the boys are uninterested.</i>

86
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:25,648
<i>Make sure to come by.</i>

87
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,441
Fine.

88
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:29,652
Wait there.

89
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:35,491
I'll be at the blind date booth,
so bring your charger there.

90
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,410
Why should I?

91
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,412
I'll put you on the list for a blind date.

92
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,372
Deal?

93
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,907
<i>It looks like Ye-ri needs a phone charger.</i>

94
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,076
<i>But it's not for her phone.</i>

95
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:22,622
Can you believe I paid 5,000 won for this?

96
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,041
Do you want to try it?

97
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,175
Aren't you hungry?

98
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,802
We starved all day for the endoscopy.

99
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,096
I'm starving.

100
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,353
- This will help you get better grades.
- Thank you.

101
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:46,812
Did you make it yourself?

102
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,857
<i>Can you get the phone</i>
<i>that she's trying to charge?</i>

103
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:55,571
Hello.

104
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,864
Hi, Je-i.

105
00:10:58,282 --> 00:10:59,116
Who is she?

106
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:00,660
Say hi, Seul-gi.

107
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:01,911
This is Gyung's mother.

108
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:07,124
- Hello, ma'am. I'm Woo Seul-gi.
- The class president.

109
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,879
I heard you placed first in your year.
You should stay on your toes, Je-i.

110
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:15,549
That's why I've been keeping her around,
so she wouldn't study today.

111
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:19,136
Yes, you need to have fun
during the festival.

112
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,808
Gyung even skipped the medical checkup
for whatever great studying she's doing.

113
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:28,270
Most students who overreact
usually aren't that bright, you know.

114
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,443
It looks delicious.

115
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:35,986
Help yourselves.

116
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:37,780
Thank you.

117
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,291
Phosphates in soda can cause calcium loss,

118
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,837
making children's bones weaker
during their growth period.

119
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,178
Also, benzopyrene formed
during meat charring

120
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,806
interacts with DNA and may lead to cancer.

121
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,766
- Especially--
- So, there's nothing we can eat.

122
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,310
You don't even know when you'll die.

123
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,355
I'd rather eat all the delicious food
and die early.

124
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:15,443
After all, my dad didn't die
due to cancer from charred meat.

125
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:22,533
It's good. Try it.

126
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,373
- It's good, right?
- Yes.

127
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,921
Did you see my dad's face just now?

128
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:38,924
I don't remember.
I just wanted to eat some meat.

129
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,018
What is that?

130
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,106
Ye-ri.

131
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,567
- Have you seen Seul-gi?
- Seul-gi?

132
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,237
I haven't seen her since the checkup.

133
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,907
Why are you so chirpy today?

134
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,743
- What do you mean?
- Do you have good news?

135
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:08,370
The school is filled
with boys from Hoegyeong High.

136
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,622
Of course, I'm chirpy.

137
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:12,833
Thanks to you, I got a medical checkup.

138
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,627
I'll repay you in full. Come.

139
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,086
- What?
- Come on.

140
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:18,339
Smile.

141
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,177
Let the prettiest boy in. All right?

142
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,763
You came for us, Ye-ri. We've got it.

143
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,379
Okay, you get three minutes.

144
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:00,047
Begin now.

145
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:05,052
WHAT'S YOUR IDEAL TYPE?
WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE FOOD?

146
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,935
I'm a high school senior,
so I'm very busy.

147
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,062
I'm not exactly looking for a boyfriend.

148
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:48,762
I'm talking to you.
Why aren't you answering me?

149
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:56,103
- Does your back hurt?
- How did you know?

150
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,732
Can you see me?

151
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,818
You can't sit still,
and you keep lifting your bottom.

152
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,612
And I sense irritation in your voice.

153
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:05,946
It's obvious.

154
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,783
I have a good pain relief patch.

155
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,118
Do you want one?

156
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,957
Well, suit yourself.

157
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,554
Do you know Woo Seul-gi?

158
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,723
What about her?

159
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:35,267
If you like the patch, tell her about it.

160
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:14,974
Gosh, you scared me.

161
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,559
Hey. Did you see that guy's face just now?

162
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,061
What's this?

163
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,146
You're into him?

164
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,314
What the heck?

165
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:26,485
What? You're making me jealous.

166
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,029
Come on in.

167
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:35,995
- Hey!
- Take my hand!

168
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:40,833
Are you all right?

169
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,001
Why is it so deep?

170
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:43,502
Come with me.

171
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,177
Are you okay?

172
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:27,337
No!

173
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,398
I've never had this much fun before.

174
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:53,489
Are your feet cold?

175
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,116
I'll go and buy a pair of socks.

176
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,250
If I'm being honest,

177
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,002
I still don't trust you.

178
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:11,215
But I'm still glad…

179
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:14,760
that we both placed first.

180
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:23,769
I wouldn't have felt that way
if it were someone else.

181
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,116
<i>Why does it take so long to charge?</i>

182
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,843
Hello? This is Ju Ye-ri.

183
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:11,191
One might think
that you're actually my sponsor.

184
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:13,944
Where's the phone?

185
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:17,281
You see, Seul-gi had two phones.

186
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:19,992
You should have given me
clearer instructions.

187
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,410
We're supposed to trust each other.

188
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,872
You asked me to get the Galaxy S at first,

189
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:28,292
so I wondered how you even knew
her phone model.

190
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,377
But Seul-gi uses a Galaxy Flip.

191
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:33,505
So I thought,
"Is the Galaxy S her second phone?"

192
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:36,383
But then, it turned out
that the phone belonged to someone else.

193
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,553
And a dead man, at that.

194
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:43,515
If you were asking me to bring
the phone of the deceased,

195
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,893
I would have to raise the price.

196
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,900
I'll make it five million won,

197
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:55,068
so bring it to me by tonight.

198
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,329
I'll call you.

199
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:24,157
Look.

200
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:28,287
It's huge.

201
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,247
I've never seen anything like it.

202
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:32,749
It's beautiful.

203
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:54,938
A-RA

204
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,653
Hey, Woo Seul-gi!

205
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:04,114
Gyung.

206
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,491
You're looking comfortable.

207
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,952
Why did you ignore my calls?
I have a ton of things to say.

208
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,581
Seul-gi, stay here with Gyung.

209
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,041
I'll be right back.

210
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,627
- I probably called like 100 times.
- What? Sorry.

211
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:26,344
- What are you doing?
- My phone isn't here.

212
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,431
- It's right here.
- Not that one.

213
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,435
Dad.

214
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,606
I think it belonged to Mr. Woo.

215
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:39,524
Who's Mr. Woo?

216
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:43,653
If my hunch is correct,
it's in the boys' blind date booth.

217
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:03,757
You look so pretty tonight, Ye-ri.

218
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,592
- I'm a fan.
- You're pretty, too.

219
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:06,593
See you soon.

220
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:12,265
Yu Je-i?

221
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:14,267
Sorry.

222
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:15,977
Are you actually Je-i?

223
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:29,116
NO CALLER ID

224
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,120
Hello?

225
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:35,372
Who's this?

226
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,918
<i>Maybe it was Je-i.</i>

227
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,587
You two have been together all day.

228
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,591
Have you seen a phone here?

229
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:50,887
Have you seen a phone here?

230
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:58,436
Did you see a Galaxy S here?

231
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:00,063
No.

232
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:03,400
Where is it?

233
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:05,861
Where we ate.

234
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,028
Maybe it's there.

235
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:15,704

MISSING CHILD
NAME: WOO SEUL-GI

237
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,936
One, zero, zero, seven, one, three.

238
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,243
Did you see the phone I was charging here?

239
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,703
- No.
- It's here, Ye-ri!

240
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:59,289
I brought you a charger!

241
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,295
Not the charger.

242
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:06,838
I'm missing the phone.

243
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,884
Read the fucking room.

244
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,180
Look at her.

245
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:22,479
RECENT CALLS

246
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:24,814
YU TAE-JUN

247
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:27,108
<i>You wouldn't want this video</i>

248
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:31,238
<i>to end up in the hands</i>
<i>of the daughter you found…</i>

249
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:34,824
<i>after 13 years, don't you think?</i>

250
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,116
Yu Je-na?

251
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:30,630
Are you looking for something?

252
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:38,346
I lost my phone.

253
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:42,642
Ye-ri.

254
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,186
You should help your friend.

255
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,110
She said she lost her phone.

256
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:54,571
What's the model?

257
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:02,829
What about the phone?

258
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:07,459
Kids nowadays get anxiety attacks
when they lose their phones.

259
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:08,626
You lost it?

260
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,588
But there weren't any missing phones.

261
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:13,173
What type of phone do you use?

262
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:16,634
A Galaxy S.

263
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,084
Mr. Yu.

264
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,545
You know,

265
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,381
I just saw Je-na.

266
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:57,967
She lost a lot of weight.

267
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,180
What diet pills does she take?

268
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,182
Can you tell me?

269
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:06,142
Please?

270
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:10,980
Right, Ye-ri.

271
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:15,110
About Je-na, was she actually a boy?

272
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:18,822
I think she transferred
to Hoegyeong High School.

273
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:21,783
What kind of bullshit is this?

274
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:23,827
Get away from me.

275
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:19,883
What's happening?

276
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:21,760
You.

277
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:23,428
Have you lost your mind?

278
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,513
You promised me.

279
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:28,850
You promised me a blind date
if I brought you a charger.

280
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,311
But why?

281
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:34,689
Why do you keep lying to me?

282
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,025
Hey, kid.

283
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,320
Why don't we put down the knife first?

284
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:42,155
You always leave me out

285
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:44,491
when you guys hang out.

286
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,623
Why do you all look down on me?

287
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,833
Who did that?

288
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:56,419
Tell me all about it. I'll tell them off.

289
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,963
So, please put the knife down.

290
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,590
Who are you calling a liar?

291
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:02,801
I never told you to be late.

292
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:05,512
You're fucking paranoid.

293
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,516
This is why Je-i stopped talking to you.

294
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:11,559
Tell me I'm wrong.

295
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,108
What did you say?

296
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:34,415
Beom-su.

297
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:49,597
Who are you?

298
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,456
You're just Je-i's plaything.

299
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,461
Seul-gi!

300
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:36,811
Oh, my gosh.

301
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:58,166
Je-na?
