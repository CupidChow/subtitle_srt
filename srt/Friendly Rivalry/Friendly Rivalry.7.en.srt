ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,

2
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:13,930
NO CHILDREN OR ANIMALS WERE HARMED
IN THE MAKING OF THIS DRAMA

3
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:17,600
<i>Welcome, everyone.</i>

4
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,185
<i>This is my dressing room.</i>

5
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:20,979
<i>I have to go to a party later.</i>

6
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:22,188
<i>What should I wear?</i>

7
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:25,233
<i>I have so many clothes.</i>
<i>I don't know what to wear.</i>

8
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:28,653
<i>It's a party,</i>
<i>so a dress would be best, right?</i>

9
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:31,406
<i>I'll wear these heels</i>
<i>and carry a bag, too.</i>

10
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:33,825
<i>- Who is it?</i>
<i>- It's me.</i>

11
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:36,036
<i>Oh, that must be my boyfriend, Tom.</i>

12
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,495
<i>I should get ready fast.</i>

13
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,581
<i>Tom, give me just five minutes!</i>

14
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:42,041
<i>Ta-da. How do I look?</i>

15
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:45,670
Mirror, mirror on the wall,
who is the fairest of them all?

16
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:47,547
Who would it be?

17
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:48,757
It's your mom.

18
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,135
Don't tease my kid.

19
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,094
By the way,

20
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:56,181
the more I look at her,
the more Ye-ri resembles you.

21
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:58,725
Don't firstborn girls
take after their dads?

22
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:00,268
When I was pregnant with her,

23
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:03,021
I prayed so hard
that she'd look like me, not her dad.

24
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:04,189
Right, Ye-ri?

25
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:07,859
What's up with you?

26
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:09,235
We got turned down.

27
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,237
- Room six?
- Yes.

28
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,031
They want to see the ex-actress.

29
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:14,699
They're making such a fuss.

30
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:17,202
They have a good eye for losers.

31
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,537
- Mi-ryeong.
- Yes.

32
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:23,333
Ye-ri.

33
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,127
You can play with me.

34
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:29,339
I don't want to. I don't like ugly women.

35
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,299
Pretty people like your mom

36
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:33,802
have lots of people
who want to play with them.

37
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,929
Try to understand that, okay?

38
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:58,952
Eight, two, zero, nine, seven!

39
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:03,206
<i>Eight, two, zero, nine, seven.</i>

40
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,374
DO WHAT I DO, F MAJOR

41
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:15,468
<i>Do what I do, like this</i>

42
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:19,430
<i>Do what I do, like this</i>

43
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:23,184
<i>Do what I do, like this</i>

44
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,561
<i>After that incident,</i>

45
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,564
<i>Ye-ri's mom never worked there again.</i>

46
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,316
<i>Instead, she decided</i>
<i>to support her daughter</i>

47
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,944
<i>and the girl's want for attention</i>
<i>as best she could.</i>

48
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:34,112
Gosh, that's pretty.

49
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,536
Your face looks really big on the screen.

50
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,454
Copy me. Pull your chin back.

51
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:45,790
Lift the corners of your mouth.

52
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,333
That's it. Keep that face.

53
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:50,420
Let's keep going.

54
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,714
Strike a pose. Good, very pretty.

Freeze.

58
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:06,978
Ju Ye-ri.

59
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:10,815
Aren't you furious that other kids
look nicer than you on camera?

60
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,984
I haven't eaten in three days.

61
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:15,194
I'm so hungry I could faint.

62
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,739
Give me that. Right now.

63
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:23,077
You can eat after you pass the audition.

64
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:27,332
If I pass, then you won't let me eat
because I have to film.

65
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,125
Memorize your lines.

66
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,422
I saw everything.

67
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,424
That you messed up the test and left.

68
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,844
Your mom got you in so far, didn't she?

69
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:43,723
You don't even have the skill.

70
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,559
You won the parents' lucky draw…

71
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:50,188
No. Do you think you're special
because you have

72
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:51,189
rich parents?

73
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:59,280

76
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:19,717
<i>That was the day</i>

77
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,012
<i>Ye-ri realized how she had passed</i>
<i>all the auditions</i>

78
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,682
<i>as well as the secret of her birth.</i>

80
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:34,899
- Why aren't you in the car?
- Mom. Your back zipper is open.

81
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,700
Shouldn't you sit in the back?

82
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:52,333
I'll get the role anyway.

83
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,003
I won't tell Dad.

84
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,839
I'm hungry. I want sweet and sour pork.

85
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,885
<i>Ye-ri quit acting that day.</i>

86
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,438
Ju Ye-ri.

87
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:17,692
Is something wrong?

88
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:21,446
I think it's time I got a new phone, Mom.

89
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,781
<i>Ye-ri had some fun blackmailing her mom.</i>

90
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,617
<i>Ironically so, she did her best</i>

91
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,787
<i>to hide her own embarrassing secrets.</i>

92
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,707
Mirror, mirror on the wall.

93
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:37,503
Who is the fairest of them all?

94
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,757
<i>Even if it were a lie.</i>

97
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,346
How much is this?

98
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,265
HAPPY 20TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY,
MOM AND DAD!

99
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:51,893
Is today some special day?

YE-RI, ANONYMOUS MESSAGES
FOR DAEJUN-DONG RESIDENTS

102
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:13,039
<i>Of course, she never slacked off</i>
<i>when it came to collecting</i>

103
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,749
<i>other people's embarrassing secrets.</i>

104
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:19,337
<i>You never know when and how</i>
<i>something might come in handy.</i>

105
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:34,977
Good morning.

106
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:46,405
You should know.
I don't have the brains to study.

107
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,034
That's why everyone belittles me.

108
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,327
I get it.

109
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,496
But doing well in school

110
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:56,082
doesn't make you more money.

111
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,586
There's one thing I'm better at
than everyone else.

112
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:06,259
I'm amazingly good at smelling money.

113
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,557
You're looking for Je-na, aren't you?

114
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:20,773
Everyone thinks she's holed up somewhere
studying to resit the CSAT.

115
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,650
I guess that's not true.

116
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,571
Je-i doesn't know, does she?

117
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:49,177
I knew we'd be on the same page.
I got the feeling a long time ago.

118
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,053
If she were missing,

119
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:54,640
you'd have reported it to the police
to open an official investigation.

120
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,228
Is there a reason you can't do that?

121
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,691
I don't care about that at all.

122
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,819
It's just that I tend to talk.

123
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,404
You need to get a padlock

124
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,573
made with diamonds or gold.

125
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:14,410
I'm saying you must get something heavy.

126
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:16,954
That's my point.

127
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,542
It looks like
you're struggling financially, Ye-ri.

128
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,253
Is a one-time payment enough?

129
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,758
If you're okay with it,
I'd like to sponsor you continuously.

130
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,053
It's not for free, of course.

131
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,682
You should show some appreciation, too.

132
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,101
What do you want?

133
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:41,395
I'm not sure.

134
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:46,192
I'll think about
what you can do for me, Ye-ri.

135
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,320
But I do see

136
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:52,907
that you're prettier without makeup.

137
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:14,387
Today, we're here with Yu Tae-jun,
a gastrointestinal surgeon

138
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,264
and director of J Medical Center.

139
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,391
- How are you today?
- I'm great, thanks.

140
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,351
You recently published a book titled

141
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:23,604
<i>A Daejun-dong Dad's Health Project</i>
<i>for Full Marks on the CSAT.</i>

142
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,606
It's the talk of the town.

143
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:30,278
In the past few years, the number
of teenage patients increased sharply.

144
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,655
Because they do nothing but sit and study,

145
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,532
they suffer from digestive ailments

146
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:38,619
such as indigestion,
constipation, and acid reflux.

147
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:42,790
You're the father of two children
studying for the CSAT.

148
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:46,335
Yes, as a father of two girls
and a doctor,

149
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:50,006
I found myself wondering
what diet would benefit them.

150
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,059
<i>From now on, until I give instructions,</i>

151
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,020
<i>do not move even if you get an order.</i>

152
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,025
I don't think I can help you.

153
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,280
I beg you, please.

154
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,311

<i>at cram school pointers.</i>

157
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:14,465
All right.

158
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:16,175
Put everything in your bags.

159
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,721

The exam is printed on three sheets.

161
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,482
Pass them to the back. Do it now.

162
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,242

176
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:41,862
You're still just as gruff.

177
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,823
<i>What time does school end?</i>

178
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:09,265
That's unexpected. I didn't expect this
from the pop quiz results.

179
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,683
How did you pull it off?

180
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:20,234
Ms. Kim, by any chance,
do I need a physical checkup?

181
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:23,779
Why? That's a benefit
for only the top 20 in their year.

182
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,155
Is there a reason you want it?

183
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:28,367
No, there's no reason, but…

184
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,369
It's not a checkup that money can buy.

185
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,955
And shockingly, you're ranked first
in your year.

186
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:36,750
It's not yet official
on your student record.

187
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:42,131
Ms. Kim, for this question,
answer number five is also correct.

188
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,799
You acknowledged the wording was vague.

189
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,926
I get you're flustered

190
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,554
because it's the first time
you came third in rank.

191
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,432
You should study before the exam,
not complain after it's over.

192
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:54,810
You can both go. Here.

193
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,754
Who was the guy by the gate earlier?

194
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,088
Your boyfriend?

195
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:25,466
- What?
- Fine.

196
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:26,926
I'll pretend I didn't see.

197
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:30,846
The physical checkup.

198
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:33,641
You get it.

199
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,184
Me?

200
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:38,062
What about you? Why won't you get it?

201
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:39,813
I got it every year.

202
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,483
You haven't, so I'll let you have a turn.

203
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,151
If I study in the free time,

204
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:46,320
maybe I'll be able to come first.

205
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,616
Or should I ask Seul-gi
to share her secrets?

206
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,993
Choi Gyung.

207
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,119
Thank you.

208
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,412
I love you, Gyung.

209
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:07,132
I was so pleased to see
the ranking on the board.

210
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:11,637
Good for you, Seul-gi.
You're taking over Gangnam now.

211
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,848
I saw something in you
the moment I saw you.

212
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:18,185
You would be my first acquaintance
to attend Hankuk University.

213
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,147
Why am I your acquaintance?

214
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:26,694
Hey. Don't be so mean
to your hometown buddy.

215
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,487
I was born in Seoul.

216
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:33,409
This is why they say
you should swim in bigger waters.

217
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,702
Seoul is quite nice.

218
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,662
Everything is on a whole other scale.

219
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,165
If you have something to say, be quick.

220
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,417
I have to go study.

221
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,795
You'll have no problem
getting into Hankuk University.

222
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:45,796
I give you that.

223
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,429
Oh, fuck.

224
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,722
It's so damn expensive.

225
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,810
Do the kids know
you're a druggie from an orphanage?

226
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:02,104
Did you get them yourself?
Or do you have a supplier?

227
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,566
I quit when I transferred here.

228
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:09,028
Come on. You ranked first in your year
in Gangnam, of all places

229
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:10,654
without drugs?

230
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,866
Someone told me it would be harder to find
a student here who didn't take drugs.

231
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,160
Who was that, I wonder?

232
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,457
Hey, this would suit you.
Will you try it on?

233
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,549
Was it you who got to Su-jin?

234
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,343
Where is she now?

235
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,180
Su-jin?

236
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,223
What about her?

237
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,939
Bring back the pills you stole.

238
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,108
Then you can afford that top.

239
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:57,367
Excuse me.

240
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,787
Do you have this in size 105?

241
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:05,334
I'm sorry. Size 105 of that top
will be stocked next week.

242
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,421
Did you hear that? It's next week.

243
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:14,009
I turned a blind eye many times,
even when I knew you were stealing.

244
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:15,677
You admit that, right?

245
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,139
A human being

246
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,642
with a conscience
should know to return a favor.

247
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,353
I grew up poor
and don't have such a thing.

248
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:25,896
What a bitch.

249
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,564
You have until next week.

250
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:30,400
I hope we can both smile then.

They spend a fortune

but you beat them all
without any extra help,

255
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,653

Is your mom coming
to the parents' event later?

00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,127
- No, I didn't tell her about it.
- Neither did I.

262
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:34,339
My parents are in Paris.
So, I didn't tell them on purpose.

305
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,728
I was way too stupid.

306
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,440
The uniform, the academy workbook,
and the midterms.

307
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,652
You gave them all to me
to make me cave in.

I forgot my place and acted out.

Are you sure?

00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,137
Settling out of court

318
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:16,723
is what I want the least.

00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,368

324
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,955
Studying is my only way out.

325
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:45,085
Good grades are my only protection
and shield.

00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,510

I need them to be clear.

00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:57,013

Let's just celebrate today.

00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,012
You must've thought

332
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:39,472
you could be number one at Chaehwa
by taking some pills.

333
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:40,557
Not me.

334
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,018
If so, I wouldn't have sold them to you.

335
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,604
Woo Seul-gi. Yu Je-i.

336
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:48,940
Our names were side by side,

337
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:50,775
and I felt ecstatic.

338
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,778
I wouldn't have liked it
if it were anyone else,

339
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:56,906
but I liked it because it was you.

340
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,747
Tell me what you promised.

341
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,460
Why are you not answering my question?

342
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:09,919
How about this?

343
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:12,672
If you score higher than me
on this midterm,

344
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:15,633
I'll tell you how I got your information

345
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:16,926
and why I got it.
