1
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,345
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:13,930
NO CHILDREN OR ANIMALS WERE HARMED
IN THE MAKING OF THIS DRAMA

3
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:34,492
Can you let go of my hand?

4
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:39,164
This is your first day at school, Seul-gi.
Hold on to my hand so you don't get lost.

5
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:49,048
Hey, Gyung.

6
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:51,384
You're smarter than me, so tell me.

7
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:54,137
What is up with that?

8
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:55,930
Beats me.

9
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:08,485
Come to think of it,
we haven't even introduced ourselves.

10
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,653
I'm Ju Ye-ri. You?

11
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,697
My name is Woo Seul-gi.

12
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,032
I'm Choi Gyung.

13
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:16,284
<i>Now that I think about it,</i>

14
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:17,827
<i>I never told her</i>

15
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:19,579
<i>my name.</i>

16
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:23,249
This is your first day at school, Seul-gi.
Hold on to my hand so you don't get lost.

17
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,002
Why did you transfer here, Seul-gi?

18
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:27,921
Not many people transfer
in their senior year.

19
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,882
Well, I moved with my parents.

20
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,468
What do they do for a living?

21
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:34,636
Were they transferred?

22
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,137
It's not like that.

23
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:37,180
GYUNGSUN HIGH SCHOOL

24
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,890
Where did you move from?

25
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:42,143
You wouldn't know.
It's just a small town in the countryside.

26
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,854
I'm also from the countryside,
and I live alone.

27
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,315
Living with a maid in a 200-square-meter
house isn't living alone.

28
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:51,111
Do you even know what it feels like
to live away from your parents?

29
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,946
Gyung also doesn't get to see
her parents that often.

30
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:54,948
They've got so many trials. Right?

31
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:56,533
You could say that.

32
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:59,661
Your mom's an attorney,
and your dad's a prosecutor.

33
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:02,163
- Why not aim for law school?
- Why does that matter?

34
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:05,041
I mean, Je-i is trying to go to medical
school to take over her dad's hospital.

35
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,377
Did your parents graduate
from music school?

36
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,254
Not exactly,

37
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:11,381
but I'm trying to make
my mom's unfulfilled dream come true

38
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:12,507
in my generation--

39
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,510
You only chose the expensive harp
because it was the least competitive.

40
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,137
Come on.

41
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,347
Seul-gi, are you also preparing
for Hankuk University?

42
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,855
Most students carry the merch
of their dream college like a lucky charm.

43
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,231
HANKUK UNIVERSITY

44
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,443
I also collect their merch.

45
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:35,655
Seul-gi's merch was a limited edition,
so it was hard to get.

46
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,870
Are you really aiming
for Hankuk University?

47
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:43,913
Which major?

48
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,709
Well, I'm…

49
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,045
I'm also thinking of medical school.

50
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:55,091
So, you were in a boarding cram school
during the break and just got out.

51
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,385
Any private tutors? Who are your teachers?

52
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:59,345
I don't have any private tutors.

53
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,931
No tutors? What about cram schools?

54
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,433
Which cram school do you go to?

55
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:05,518
I don't go to any.

56
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,313
She's a rare species.

57
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:11,733
Je-i has three math tutors
when she's guaranteed

58
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:13,276
to go to Hankuk Medical School.

59
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,445
Stop it, Gyung.

60
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,447
I mean, it's way too ridiculous.

61
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,282
The idea of aiming for Hankuk University…

62
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:23,286
I mean Hankuk Medical School, at that,
without any private education…

63
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:28,416
But the solutions and answers
are all in the workbooks.

64
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,336
Listen to yourself.

65
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:34,422
Are you naive or plainly dumb?

66
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,007
I'm asking because I honestly don't know.

67
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:38,801
Yes, Seul-gi,
they're all in the workbooks.

68
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,930
But there are different methods
to solve the same problem.

69
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,349
It's not a bad idea
to learn from different teachers.

70
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:48,645
Je-i.

71
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,148
Thanks, girls.

72
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:09,666
I just can't recover from fatigue,
no matter how many pills I take.

73
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,334
Have you tried quitting smoking?

74
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:14,462
Do you want an IV?
I'll notify the hospital.

75
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:17,131
Je-i, your dad's IV shots
are certainly effective.

76
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,467
Seul-gi, do you want to come with us?

77
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,595
He looks after all my friends
like he's their family doctor.

78
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,389
You need to stay healthy to study hard.

79
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,266
Thanks for the offer.

80
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,768
But I'm fine.

81
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,271
Okay, tell me if you need my help.

82
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,933
What are you doing?

83
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,603
Moving to a different seat.

84
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,106
I think her name was
Kim Na-ri or Choi Na-ri.

85
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:16,774
She and I agreed to switch seats.

86
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,819
And Je-i gave you permission?

87
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:22,447
Do I need her permission
to change my seat?

88
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,578
How can I trust
that this water from you is safe?

89
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,456
What if you put something in it?

90
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,209
That's ridiculous.

91
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:19,045
I didn't put anything.
You were taking medication--

92
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:22,799
You must be thinking
that I'm a paranoid psycho,

93
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,133
but wait and see.

94
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:27,095
Now that Je-i has chosen you,

95
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,097
it'll be tough to keep your sanity.

96
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,240
What's your plan?

97
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:49,951
You're not going to keep
that bumpkin around, are you?

98
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:57,333
Hey!

99
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,794
Get that away from me! I hate mice!

100
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:01,671
Aren't they pretty cute?

101
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,811
I'm against having a girl
with an unknown identity in our group.

102
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:17,812
Are you?

103
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,565
So, what are you going to do about it?

104
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:24,777
2025 HANKUK UNIVERSITY
ADMISSION PLAN OVERVIEW

105
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,112
EXTRA CREDIT FOR LEADERSHIP

106
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:28,406
They give extra credit
to class representatives this year.

107
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,076
Why don't you be
the class president in the first semester?

108
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,413
MEDICAL SCHOOL: GRADES, 90%
EXTRA CREDIT FOR LEADERSHIP, 10%

109
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,126
Do you mean that?

110
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:41,544
Of course.

111
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,589
Keep your promise.

112
00:07:58,728 --> 00:07:59,812
CHAEHWA

113
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,316
WATERCOLOR SETS

114
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:09,780
LOOKING FOR CHAEHWA HIGH UNIFORM

115
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:10,865
Seul-gi.

116
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:12,950
Why are you sitting here?

117
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:14,702
Well,

118
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:18,206
I have bad eyesight,
so I couldn't see the board.

119
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:21,000
You should have said so.
I could have moved with you.

120
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,045
- Seon-hye?
- Oh, okay.

121
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,507
I'd rather not cause
other classmates trouble.

122
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:38,893
If you say so.

123
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:40,728
Okay, then.

124
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:52,865
Je-i, you're not offended, are you?

125
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,159
I'm fine. Let's get along.

126
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,411
"Get along?" Don't be silly.

127
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,539
I've always wanted to sit next to you.

128
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,582
I can't believe it came true
in my senior year.

129
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,793
I guess I'll be entering
a good college with you.

130
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,211
I hope you can teach me a lot.

131
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,589
Teach you? Friends don't teach each other.

132
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,968
It's my first time sitting next to someone
with such high grades,

133
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,469
and I'm nervous.

134
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,390
It's actually also my first time
sitting with a classmate

135
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:18,599
that I didn't choose.

136
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:31,070
<i>The person you are trying to reach</i>
<i>is unavailable.</i>

137
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,281
<i>The call will be directed to voicemail.</i>

138
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,783
<i>Charges may apply after the beep.</i>

139
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,506
Hello.

140
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,884
How have you been?

141
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,304
Was it the first day of school?

142
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,235
Do you remember

143
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,697
seeing a phone
among your dad's belongings?

144
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,117
I never saw it.

145
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,620
It's a Galaxy, but not a recent model.

146
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:23,289
You know, it had
a Hankuk University key chain.

147
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,458
You never saw it?

148
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:27,668
No.

149
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:29,795
I'm sorry.

150
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,633
You don't need to be sorry.

151
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:54,070
REST IN PEACE

152
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:57,615
I heard her mom also passed away
right after he lost her.

153
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,827
Why did you find her in the first place?
You didn't have to do that.

154
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,873
She's his ex-wife's child.

155
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,541
It's not like you'll raise her.

156
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:22,932
WOO DO-HYEOK

157
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,856

00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,682
SELLER: ARE YOU AT EXIT 8?

163
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:48,517
YES, WHERE ARE YOU?

164
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:54,398
SELLER: GO STRAIGHT FROM THE EXIT

165
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:00,654

00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,396
Yes.

170
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,888
TOO MANY INCORRECT UNLOCK ATTEMPTS

171
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,682
NO CALLER ID

172
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,146
NO CALLER ID

173
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,723
- Good morning.
- Hello.

174
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,834
Oh, no.

175
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:20,920
My hand slipped.

176
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:27,885
That's all right. I can wash it.

177
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:30,971
I'm so sorry.

178
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,431
What can I do?

179
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,266
I'm honestly fine.

180
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:36,560
I'm not sure

181
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:40,189
if you can wash that stain off.

182
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:47,237
Well, you have such a strong stomach,

183
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,448
so you must not mind these filthy stains.

184
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,285
Don't you get it?

185
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:54,912
Your uniform

186
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,497
reeks of semen.

187
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,210
Did you think

188
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,254
you were Cinderella
because Je-i hung out with you?

189
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,101
- Gross.
- She's disgusting.

190
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:18,852
Oh, my gosh.

191
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,814
- No way.
- That's nasty.

192
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:25,109
- It's so gross.
- Jeez.

193
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,696
Oh, my gosh!

194
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:29,947
Look at her!

195
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:32,574
She's fucking nasty!

196
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,993
Keep going!

197
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,744
Hey.

198
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:40,666
Move.

199
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,835
Oh, fuck.

200
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:46,046
Seul-gi. When did you change your pad?

201
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,923
You smell like goddamn blood!

202
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,884
See if she's missing a shoe insert.

203
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,636
She could be using it as a pad.

204
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,848
Take it off. That's fucking hilarious.

205
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,644
- Get up.
- Come here, Seul-gi.

206
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,691
Take her shoes off!

207
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,491
You fucking bitch.

208
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,836
Seul-gi.

209
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:20,057
You fit right in between my arms.

210
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,647
I think we wear similar sizes.

211
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:30,901
I hate getting my shirt stained,
so I keep a few extra in my locker.

212
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:34,071
- You can wear mine.
- Thanks, but no.

213
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:35,697
You can't wear that again.

214
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,992
- Just wear this. I'll help you put it on.
- I already said no.

215
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:43,580
I'm not like you,
so I can handle a stinky, filthy uniform.

216
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,250
I said I was fine. Why do you care?

217
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:49,962
Don't you know what "no" means?

218
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:52,673
Don't be delusional.

219
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,842
Not everyone appreciates your kindness.

220
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:59,763
Fine. I get it, so you can stop.

221
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:27,374
See if your hands can catch up with
the speed you've trained during vacation.

222
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:29,918
You get 20 minutes.

223
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:32,921
Begin.

224
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:50,564
<i>This exam covers materials</i>
<i>that we haven't even learned yet,</i>

225
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,191
<i>but no one thinks it's strange.</i>

226
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,361
<i>Has everyone learned this except for me?</i>

227
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,633
You should have gotten
to problem number seven by now.

228
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,441
Stop. Put your pens down.

229
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,985
Collect the test papers from the back.

230
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:56,755
Yu Je-i, ten points.

231
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,925
Choi Gyung, nine points.

232
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,719
Kim Beom-su, eight points.

233
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:04,888
Cho A-ra, eight points.

234
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,933
Gu Chae-ryeong, seven points.
Lee Si-u, six points.

235
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:10,894
Kim Na-ri, six points.
Park Byeong-hui, six points.

236
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,563
I don't even feel the need
to name the ones with lower scores.

237
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,235
Dismissed.

238
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,739
Oh, I got one wrong.

239
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:25,325
Gosh, why isn't my tutor picking up?

240
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,368
This is so frustrating.

241
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,162
- This is stupid.
- What did I get wrong?

242
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:31,415
It would be faster
if Je-i called out the answers.

243
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:33,917
- Je-i, what's the answer for number 2?
- And number 5?

244
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,627
- And number 7?
- What about number 8?

245
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:38,005
I'll just call out the answers
from number one.

246
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:44,511
Number 1 was 5.

247
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,181
Number 2 was negative 3.

248
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,309
Ms. Kim.

249
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:53,061
What is it?

250
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:58,900
Can you tell me my score?

251
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,032
Woo Seul-gi. Four points.

252
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,618
I heard you were top of the class
in your previous school.

253
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:12,039
I had my hopes up, but I'm disappointed.

254
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:14,750
Our students are surely smarter
than the ones in the countryside, right?

255
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:19,171
Then, Ms. Kim,
will you teach us the solutions next time?

256
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:23,675
No. This is literally a test.

257
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,135
A level test.

258
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:26,636
That way, the academies

259
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,431
can estimate the difficulty
of our school's exams this year.

260
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,696
- Ye-ri, where did you get your hair done?
- Why?

261
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,198
- Is it pretty?
- Yes.

262
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:47,699
It's so pretty.

263
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,869
There's no way.

264
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:53,580
That's her, right?

265
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:55,457
Yes.

266
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,251
What happened to her shirt?

267
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:02,047
She's making the whole school look bad.

268
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,149
What the fuck was that?

269
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:23,360
She's absolutely crazy.

270
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:42,754
I WISH I HADN'T SEEN THAT

271
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:43,797
SHE'S INSANE
GROSS

272
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,965
SO VULGAR
POOR HER

273
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:46,049
THAT'S NASTY
FUCKING NASTY

274
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,425
THAT'S OUR UNIFORM

275
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:48,844
YUCK

276
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:49,970
I'M SO SHOCKED
SHE MUST BE BROKE

277
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:51,138
NO FREAKING WAY
I MIGHT THROW UP

278
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:52,639
I WONDER HOW MUCH SHE PAID FOR IT

279
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:53,974
IS THIS FOR REAL?
ANYONE KNOWS WHO SHE IS?

280
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:55,308
UNBELIEVABLE

281
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,144
WE HAVE A BEGGAR AT SCHOOL
I'M CALLING THE POLICE

282
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:58,311
SHE HAS A SUGAR DADDY?

Oh, okay.

I understand.

- I'll discuss it with my parents.
- Sure.

295
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,417

A DOOR OF HOPE OPENS FOR YOUR DREAMS

I'll quickly explain Numbers 7 and 8.
Listen carefully.

303
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:55,553
One over log c squared is six.

304
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:57,472
We want to know the value of A and C.

305
00:25:57,555 --> 00:26:00,892
Where's the log?
In the denominator, right?

306
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:04,354
We want to make that into a numerator.
Here's what we do.

307
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:07,565
We can switch the index with this number.

308
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:10,235
Kid, why aren't you going to class?

309
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,239
Wait. Didn't you just get consulted?

310
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:15,407
It's you, right?

311
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:16,408
Hey.

312
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:18,994
Hey, stop!

313
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:23,456
Shoot.

314
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,850
There's a class crasher in the elevator!

8:49 P.M., TUESDAY, MARCH 5TH

316
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:58,033
There's a fire exit
at the end of the hall to your right.

317
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,076
Hide on the rooftop. I'll call you.

318
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,904
Oh, hello. How are you?

319
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,447
Oh, hi, Je-i.

320
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:40,909
- Were you in the elevator by yourself?
- Yes, why do you ask?

321
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:44,162
A girl from your school
took a video and ran away.

322
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:46,414
I was sure she took the elevator down.

323
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:47,332
That's strange.

324
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,084
Excuse me.

325
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:50,502
Yes?

326
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:52,504
By the way…

327
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:15,735
- Look at her!
- Hit her more.

328
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:16,778
Harder!

329
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:19,322
