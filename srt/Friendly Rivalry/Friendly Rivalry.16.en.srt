1
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:12,345
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:13,930
NO CHILDREN OR ANIMALS WERE HARMED
IN THE MAKING OF THIS DRAMA

3
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:31,823
Je-i!

4
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,543
I won't get out until you talk.

5
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,921
Just so you know, I can't swim.

6
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,869
Woo Seul-gi. Wake up.

7
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:20,121
Seul-gi!

8
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:49,359
I know you bombed your final exam

9
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,694
to get your dad to sneak you
the killer math problem.

10
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,489
That's how you'll get revenge.

11
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,282
"Get revenge"?

12
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,951
Why would I do that?

13
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,871
You seem to be sorely mistaken.

14
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,248
Then why did you save me?

15
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:11,172
You've told me before
that you imagine me dying.

16
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:15,510
You were saying I mean something to you.

17
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,097
That's why you jumped in to save me.

18
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,433
Aren't we on the same side?

19
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:25,687
You know that and…

20
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,606
You knew that and agreed

21
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,608
to get the killer problem?

22
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:32,944
Are you out of your mind?

23
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:40,160
I can't let you ruin your own life
just to lock up your dad.

24
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:42,996
I have no life to ruin.

25
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,331
My life is already a nightmare.

26
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:46,958
Revenge?

27
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:52,881
Do you think I'm the kind of person
to sacrifice for others?

28
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:55,425
- Then what are you doing this for?
- For me.

29
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:56,968
Because I want to survive.

30
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:58,678
So, will you please stay out of it?

31
00:02:58,761 --> 00:02:59,679
I can't do that.

32
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:04,350
Your dad dragged me into this
knowing your plan.

33
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:07,353
He believes you won't do
anything stupid if I'm involved.

34
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:08,938
What do you want me to do, then?

35
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,316
Keep despising me
as you're doing right now.

36
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:15,028
And just gladly use me
to get your hands on

37
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,237
the killer problem.

38
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,699
- I won't.
- It's a crime if you do it,

39
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:21,159
but I'm the victim's child.

40
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,120
If we get proof and show
how the problem was leaked,

41
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:25,246
it's the only way.

42
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:29,918
If you suggest you use me as bait,
your dad will let his guard down.

43
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,252
Woo Seul-gi.

44
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:34,005
If we're going to do it,
we should raise the stakes.

45
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,592
So he can't break his promise.

46
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:39,844
Then you should raise the stakes

47
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,638
so she can't break her promise.

48
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:45,600
How about making her
steal the question herself?

49
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,644
You can collect proof of it, too.

50
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:48,895
<i>Je-i!</i>

51
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:22,887
Je-i.

52
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:43,241
<i>I found it odd that Dad</i>
<i>willingly went with my idea</i>

53
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:45,743
<i>to make you contact the question-setter.</i>

54
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,496
<i>I think he's up to something else.</i>

55
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,415
CSAT QUESTION-SETTERS

56
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:53,126
PARK MYEONG-HO, MATH

57
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,168
Park Myeong-ho.

58
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:57,380
What's your date of birth?

59
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,340
- August 9th, 1973.
- Thank you.

60
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,517
OCTOBER SHIFT SCHEDULE

61
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,478
<i>He sent in a nurse</i>
<i>with the question-setters.</i>

62
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,608
<i>Ms. Son, where are you?</i>

63
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:19,277
POWER OFF

64
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,659
<i>They won't use</i>
<i>the same trick as last year.</i>

65
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:30,079
<i>You could be in danger, Seul-gi.</i>

66
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,957
What is most important in a discourse?

67
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:36,669
It is that two or more vocalizations

68
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,422
or sentences come one after the other.

69
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:43,217
A vocalization is phonetic,

70
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:46,054
and sentences are written.

71
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:47,513
<i>You can back out now.</i>

72
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:48,973
<i>Leave the rest to me.</i>

73
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,726
That is what constitutes a discourse.

74
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:56,814
Be sure to memorize this.

75
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:57,732
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

76
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,400
- It's not too hard, is it?
- No.

77
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,069
I'll move on, then.

78
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,987
Direct and indirect vocalization.

79
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,156
<i>What will you do on your own?</i>

80
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,950
<i>And why did you leave Je-yun with Gyung?</i>

81
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:19,879
<i>You know how he put a camera</i>
<i>on Je-yun's collar to spy on us.</i>

82
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:20,838
D-DAY 30 DAYS

83
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,591
<i>The D-day on your tablet.</i>

84
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:25,134
<i>Is it the CSAT results day?</i>

85
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,512
<i>Right. Hey, Seul-gi.</i>

86
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:29,472
<i>What?</i>

87
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:32,517
<i>You'll do well in the CSAT</i>
<i>even without the killer problem.</i>

88
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:35,561
<i>And you'll go to Hankuk Medical School</i>
<i>as you wished.</i>

89
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:47,657
<i>Submit your applications</i>
<i>by the end of the day.</i>

90
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,751
<i>So, whatever happens,</i>

91
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,712
<i>don't give up on the CSAT.</i>

92
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,973
<i>I submitted your CSAT application form.</i>

93
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,099
2025 CSAT APPLICATION FORM
WOO SEUL-GI

94
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:16,727
<i>Also, can I tell you a secret?</i>

95
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,481
<i>The pills I gave you before the midterms…</i>

96
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,317
<i>They were multivitamins.</i>

97
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:54,056
WOO SEUL-GI

98
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,948
I was surprised that you called.

99
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,951
I don't see a reason for this reunion.

100
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:18,289
Well, if you don't get it, that's fine.

101
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,753
Tell me.

102
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:28,633
Three, four, zero, eight.

103
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:31,010
<i>That jerk Yu Tae-jun told me to do it.</i>

104
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,720
<i>It was part of the deal.</i>

105
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:34,597
Here it is.

106
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,231
What do you want?

107
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,983
How much do you make by selling pills?

108
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:51,322
It can't be that much
if you have to give Ye-ri a cut.

109
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,953
I have a much better business plan.

110
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,580
Do you want to hear it?

111
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:09,006
Kids here take prescription meds
to stay up longer to study.

112
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,593
I'm thinking of selling a CSAT problem.

113
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:16,639
You're trying to dupe someone
who dupes others for a living.

114
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:19,934
Do you think I'm joking?

115
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:26,357
That's what J Medical Center's Yu Tae-jun
is doing for his daughter.

116
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:34,740
That's the VIP client list of kids
she sold pills to.

117
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,994
They're all from rich families.

118
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,415
We can set the price, then.

119
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,375
What do I do first?

120
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:49,171
SMART ADMISSIONS
NAM BYEONG-JIN

121
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,172
Thank you.

122
00:09:58,806 --> 00:09:59,807
Thank you.

123
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,520
There's more where that comes from.

124
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,652
This actually worked.

125
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,825
Add that to your tuition.

126
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:19,827
I heard medical school is expensive.

127
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:23,414
I'll come first in the CSAT
and get a scholarship.

128
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:26,876
That means this plan
must succeed no matter what, right?

129
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,672
SMARTYPANTS

130
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:44,602
Goodness.

131
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,228
Why are you so impatient?

132
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:50,358
I do have something better than pills.

133
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:55,154
But I'm a bit wary because of your mom.

134
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,908
1 DAY BEFORE THE CSAT

135
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,703
Kick higher, will you?

136
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:12,880
All clear.

137
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,060
- Oh, dear.
- Gosh.

138
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,106
- He must be badly hurt.
- Have a look.

139
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:56,424
What are you doing?

140
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:57,758
The plan has changed.

141
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:07,393
It's acute compartment syndrome.
I did an emergency fasciotomy.

142
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:11,147
His blood pressure could drop,
so he'll need a platelet transfusion.

143
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,565
Contact an affiliated hospital

144
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,984
and quickly request blood
and a narcotic analgesic.

145
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,527
Nothing comes in from the outside.

146
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,529
His blood type is O-negative.

147
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,364
We don't have his blood here.

148
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,242
His muscles and nerves
can turn necrotic in six hours.

149
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:25,411
Move it!

150
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:36,547
EMERGENCY TRANSFUSION

151
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,803

- Okay.

EMERGENCY SERVICES

153
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,413
Thank you for coming.

154
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,885
<i>Leaving now.</i>

155
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,637
<i>Estimated time of arrival is 10 p.m.</i>

156
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:36,941
Sir, can we go a bit faster?

157
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:38,901
Why, Director?

158
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:40,569
There's no patient.

159
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:47,409
3 HOURS AGO

160
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,079
I'm so freaking nervous.

161
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:55,709
Do you want some?

162
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,295
I quit.

163
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,248
Get out.

164
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:35,332
Get out!

165
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,521
Woo Seul-gi,
check this jerk's right pocket.

166
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,113
Seul-gi.

167
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:07,823
Give that to me.

168
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,702
Woo Seul-gi! Get a hold of yourself!

169
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,287
Seul-gi, please.

170
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,628
You need the killer problem

171
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:23,047
to get into Hankuk University
and become a doctor.

172
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,174
Are you going to fucking lose it
to that bitch?

173
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:31,722
Don't worry.

174
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,099
That's impossible.

175
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,736
God damn it!

176
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:58,874
Seul-gi.

177
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:02,378
I'm sorry.

178
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,767
10 HOURS BEFORE CSAT BEGINS

180
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:22,439
I'LL SUE YOU FOR FRAUD

181
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,609
Don't just stand there.

182
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,027
Get it out.

183
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,071
Dad.

184
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:32,449
The thing is,
I'm not interested in doing this surgery.

185
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:35,160
What kind of fucking joke is that?

186
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,913
The people who need the problem
in Seul-gi's stomach

187
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,540

188
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,875
Not me.

189
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,211
What will you do, then?

190
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:46,130
Call another doctor right now!

191
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:49,758
I'll do it.

192
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:51,927
What?

193
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,887
I'll perform this surgery.

194
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,766
That's a great idea.

195
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,519
You'll get a head start on your studies.

196
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,187
You're all crazy.

197
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:12,281

198
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:47,775

- My gosh.

00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,956
- Hurry up, will you?
- Be quick!

216
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:02,391
As I expected, you were born to do this.

217
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,811
I'm sure you'll make a great doctor.

218
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:08,981

00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,848
I won't be the one to ruin Seul-gi.

00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,778
You took the back door,

Wait, I still have my practical exam.

Forget the practical exam.

247
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:23,300
I had to beg and plead

According to Article 14,
the juvenile is not penalized.

00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:04,007

No.

00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,395

00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:18,855
Why aim for medical school?

Shit, why are we going there?

267
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,193
You're more of a law student.

268
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,821
You were dead cool earlier.

269
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:30,951
Is your wrist okay?

270
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:32,369
You have a practical exam.

271
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:34,454
I'm not good enough to go to college.

272
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:37,833
But I should at least play a few notes.

273
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,042
Don't you think?

274
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,262

00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:51,638

I wondered where you went
instead of taking the CSAT.

281
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:14,870
And now you want to drop out?

282
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,248
You need a diploma
if you want to retake the CSAT.

283
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:21,376
Ms. Kim, what are you still doing here?

284
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:22,460
Go to your classroom.

285
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:23,503
Okay.

286
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:27,841
Let's discuss this later.

287
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,148

288
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,199

00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:58,288
What do you plan on studying?

291
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:02,000
How did you get full marks
on the hardest CSAT in history?

292
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:03,960
Many people said math was especially hard.

293
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,378
Did you expect great results?

294
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:26,191
To be honest, I knew I'd get full marks

295
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:28,610
as long as I marked the answers correctly.

296
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:30,570
Following the steps of my dad,

297
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:33,573
I plan to pursue studies
at Hankuk Medical School.

298
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:40,372
This must be like father, like daughter.

299
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:42,749
Congratulations,
Dr. Yu Tae-jun of J Medical Center.

300
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:44,125
Thank you.

301
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,879
Your daughter got full marks on the CSAT.

302
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,422
How do you feel?

303
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:53,927
It feels like I got compensated in one go
for the work I put in for 19 years.

304
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:55,637
I see.

305
00:25:56,263 --> 00:26:00,141

309
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:10,735

- Bullshit.

310
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,446
<i>I gave her good food</i>
<i>and cheered her on with love.</i>

311
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:15,782
<i>More than anything,</i>

312
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:18,451
<i>I believed without a doubt</i>
<i>that my daughter could do it.</i>

313
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:20,245

<i>Were you afraid?</i>

323
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,268
<i>Were you anxious?</i>

324
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,190

325
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,861
<i>were you happy?</i>

326
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:37,215
What is it?

327
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:38,383
What's the matter?

328
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,261
- His daughter jumped.
- Oh, no.

329
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,679
- Yu Je-i?
- What's going on?

330
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:43,680
Is this in real-time?

331
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:45,056
- Oh, dear.
- Add it to the script.

332
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,349
She killed herself.

333
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,560
We have breaking news.

334
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:52,647
A student from C High School,
who got full marks on the CSAT,

335
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:55,108
just jumped from a great height.

336
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:56,609
I will repeat that.

337
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,653
A student who got full marks on the CSAT

338
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,947

339
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,659
Make way, please.

340
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:05,744
Step aside.

341
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:07,495
Can you explain the situation, Detective?

342
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:08,580

343
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,168
- Can you step aside?
- Hey.

344
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,128
- Was there something else?
- Let's see.

345
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:26,055
We found her!

346
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,183
- Go over there.
- Over here!

347
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:30,477
- What's going on?
- Over here!

348
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,811
- Is it her?
- I don't know.

349
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:34,439
- What do you think happened?
- We'll see.

350
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:58,713
Je-na?

351
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:02,300
Je-na was really alive.

352
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:07,222
What about Je-i?

353
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,307
- Where is Je-i?
- We'll keep looking.

354
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,397
What's your name?

355
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,400
What is your name?

356
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,321
Will someone please find Je-i?

357
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,033
Hurry up!

358
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:34,749
Please find Je-i.

359
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:39,712
Please…

360
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:43,550
<i>I should've realized then.</i>

361
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:44,592
Je-i!

362
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:54,310
<i>What season you were going through.</i>

363
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:04,571
<i>A renowned Gangnam</i>
<i>medical center's director, Yu,</i>

364
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,906
<i>is under suspicion</i>
<i>of leaking the killer math problem</i>

365
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:10,243
<i>to give his daughters</i>
<i>an advantage on the CSAT.</i>

366
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,454
<i>He obtained it not just for the 2025 CSAT</i>

367
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:17,500
<i>but also for the 2024 CSAT</i>
<i>that was last year.</i>

368
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:20,086
<i>He's also suspected of killing</i>
<i>question-setter Woo</i>

369
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:22,046
<i>- in the process.</i>
- Here he is!

370
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:24,465
Any comments?

371
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:27,427
Why did you report
your living daughter dead?

372
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,221
How do you respond to the comment
that you covered up a murder?

373
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,515
Your younger daughter exposed you
before the jump.

374
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,058
Anything to say to her?

375
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,689
I'll keep looking for you
until I see your body.

376
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,525
You know what I mean, don't you?

377
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:45,194
Let us get through.

378
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,112
Step aside.

379
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:47,530
- Any comments?
- How do you feel?

380
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:50,533
- What else do you say?
- Any word for your daughters?

381
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,118
6 MONTHS LATER

382
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:53,536
- Reveal the truth
- Isn't it hot?

383
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,829
- behind CSAT!
- Take one.

384
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,623
- Here.
- Reveal the truth behind the CSAT!

385
00:31:56,706 --> 00:32:00,418
- Reveal the truth behind the CSAT!
- My daughter won't give an interview.

386
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:02,754
It's a hot day. Just go home.

387
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,465
She's the girl in the video.

388
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,635
She met with Park Myeong-ho
and was operated on.

389
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:10,178
Think of this.

390
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,305
Her friend went missing.

391
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:15,308
You people have no manners.

392
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:18,728
REVEAL THE TRUTH BEHIND THE CSAT!

393
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,655
<i>Je-i.</i>

394
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:31,824
<i>We're still waiting for you.</i>

395
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:34,202
Welcome.

396
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:35,828
- Can we get more kimchi?
- Sure.

397
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,498
<i>Ye-ri lives quietly, working part-time</i>

398
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:40,625
<i>and exploring what to do in the future.</i>

399
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:44,128
Are you ready to order?

DIRECTOR SONG JAE-HUI

401
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,803
You're prettier in real life.

402
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,349
You know me, don't you?

403
00:32:56,432 --> 00:33:01,688
<i>But it looks like she won't be able</i>
<i>to live quietly in this lifetime.</i>

404
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:14,701
<i>Thanks to Ye-ri's help</i>
<i>in finding her calling,</i>

405
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:16,953
<i>Gyung went to law school.</i>

406
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:21,749
<i>And still, she never had a boyfriend.</i>

407
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:27,213
You're adorable.

408
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,881
How old are you?

409
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,050
<i>She's so busy reading her law book</i>

410
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:33,261
<i>that she doesn't have the time for men.</i>

411
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,558
Let's go.

412
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:43,062
<i>It looks like she won't date anyone</i>
<i>until she's done studying.</i>

413
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:45,898
Choi Gyung, wait for me.

415
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,255
He's so persistent.

416
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:13,384
Is Je-i's dad still there?

417
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:14,635
Yes.

418
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,013
Should we just move?

419
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:18,473
And what, then?

420
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,266
He'll just follow us.

421
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,435
Don't mind him at all.

422
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,983
We couldn't get him charged with murder,

423
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,569
and he got out after just a few months.

424
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:33,529
Now, he just won't leave us alone.

425
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:52,924
<i>I got my GED</i>

7 DAYS UNTIL THE CSAT

427
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,560
<i>I stopped taking pills,</i>

428
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:07,230
<i>so my study hours are shorter than before.</i>

429
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,816
<i>But my mind is much clearer.</i>

430
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:13,986
<i>I keep thinking it's over if I lie down,</i>

431
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,905
<i>so I doze when I'm seated.</i>

432
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,492
<i>Even in that short while, I dream.</i>

433
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,488
<i>Je-i.</i>

434
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,242
