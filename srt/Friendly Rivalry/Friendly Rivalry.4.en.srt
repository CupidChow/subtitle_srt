1
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,345
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:13,930
NO CHILDREN OR ANIMALS WERE HARMED
IN THE MAKING OF THIS DRAMA

3
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:26,568
Hey, Je-i.

4
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:29,821
Can I sit next here?

5
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:39,622
Of course.

6
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,250
This was your seat anyway.

7
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,132
No way.

8
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,092
What kind of situation is this?

9
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,093
This looks pretty.

10
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:55,305
Transfer got a whole new uniform, right?

11
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:56,264
Yes.

12
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:58,683
If you noticed,
despite your terrible sense of style,

13
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,268
it has to be the truth.

14
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:03,396
Wasn't Na-ri going to nominate you
as a class president candidate?

15
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,314
Yes.

16
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:07,358
If I became class president,
I was going to make her vice president.

17
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:11,905
Is it B?

18
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,032
That's right.

19
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,830
Does that brand also make vape pen cases?

20
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,832
That model wasn't imported to Korea.

21
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,667
My dad got it in France.

22
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,171
- Did you call Na-ri?
- She won't pick up.

23
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:29,964
Her phone is off since yesterday.

24
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:32,801
Isn't she not the type
to miss school for no good reason?

25
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,177
That's true, but…

26
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,179
Why didn't she come to school, then?

27
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,641
- Is she asleep at home?
- We wouldn't know.

28
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,976
She had lunch with you yesterday.

29
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,145
She disappeared afterwards.

30
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,038
MEDICAL CLUB C-MED
RECRUITING MEMBERS FOR 2024

31
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,547
C-Med?

32
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:16,094
Anyone who's anyone
at Chaehwa joins that club.

33
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,263
Are you also applying?

34
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:19,472
I'm thinking about it.

35
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:21,641
To go to medical school,

36
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:23,726
I could do with the extra credit
from the medical club.

37
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:26,020
Not just anyone can get in.

38
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,148
Their qualifications are strict.

39
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:30,150
Didn't Je-i tell you?

40
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:33,486
They don't pick seniors.
I heard that much.

41
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:36,030
They'll select from this year's freshmen.

42
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,616
Still, I'll apply anyway.

43
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,828
You think you have an advantage because
your seatmate is the club president?

44
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:43,872
What?

45
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,124
It's quite odd.

46
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,919
Na-ri wanted to join, too.

47
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,088
So what?

48
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:53,381
Think about it.

49
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:55,675
If one of you two were to disappear,

50
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:59,554
the other can easily get what they want.

51
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,853
CHOI GYUNG

52
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,855
Since Gyung is the only candidate,

53
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:11,399
close your eyes, vote yes or no,
and end this quickly.

54
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:13,943
- The midterms are around the corner.
- Ms. Kim.

55
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:16,446
Yes?

56
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,197
I want to nominate someone
for class president, too.

57
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:20,366
Do you? Who is it?

58
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,285
My seatmate Woo Seul-gi.

59
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,664
Woo Seul-gi?

60
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:28,583
Do you want to be class president?

61
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,418
Of course, she does.

62
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:33,838
I promised to help her
if she became class president.

63
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,134
We have no choice.

64
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,639
Take out a notebook so you can vote.

65
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:50,897
CHOI GYUNG, WOO SEUL-GI

66
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,860

67
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,323
Choi Gyung.

68
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,658
CHOI GYUNG 10

69
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:02,951
CHOI GYUNG 11

70
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:03,993
WOO SEUL-GI

71
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,078
Woo Seul-gi.

72
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,371
WOO SEUL-GI 11

73
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,376
Void.

74
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:23,846
Woo Seul-gi.

75
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,015
Congratulations, Seul-gi.

76
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:28,851
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

77
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,438
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

78
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:37,735
Cho A-ra.
Did you read the votes correctly?

79
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,363
I need to see for myself.

80
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:46,911
VOID

81
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,583
WOO SEUL-GI

82
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,837
WOO SEUL-GI

83
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:01,926
Hey.

84
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,720
Show me the notebook you used.

85
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,597
What piece of paper did you vote with?

86
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:14,856
Hey, Choi Gyung.

87
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:18,568
Is there a problem?

88
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:20,862
Don't you know?

89
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:24,073
Don't you also find it weird that you won?

90
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:31,247
So what?

91
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:33,207
A rigged election.

92
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,044
Someone swapped out the votes.

93
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,841
Do you see these pieces of paper?

94
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:45,011
One person wrote your name
on these identical pieces of paper.

95
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,722
I'm saying this election was rigged.

96
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:50,725
Do you mean to say

97
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:55,146
that I, someone incapable of gaining
my classmates' support,

98
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,941
was capable of getting them
to swap their votes

99
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,276
so I would win?

100
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:04,030
That's not something you could do.

101
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:06,657
Are you saying someone's backing me?

102
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:19,378
Choi Gyung.

103
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:21,255
That's enough.

104
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,634
They didn't vote for me
because they liked me.

105
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:29,806
I might be
a bumpkin with no decent background,

106
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:34,102
but even I know what's going on.

107
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,107
That's enough, Gyung.

108
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,443
Seul-gi is class president,
and you're vice president.

109
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:43,986
That will look nice
on your student record.

110
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,781
Shouldn't Gyung apologize, Ms. Kim?

111
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,285
Why should I apologize?

112
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,500
You didn't accept the result

113
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:01,587
and instead insulted Seul-gi
and the rest of our class.

114
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,256
Of course, you should apologize.

115
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,592
Don't you think, Class President?

116
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:10,596
Yes.

117
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,223
I'd like you to.

118
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,246
I'm sorry for causing a scene.

119
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,228
INCORRECT PIN ENTERED

120
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,525
INCORRECT PIN ENTERED

121
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,660
<i>What are you doing?</i>
<i>Treat me since you're class president.</i>

122
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:09,882
WOO SEUL-GI

123
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:13,886
GENERAL TRASH

124
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,475
I'm sorry for causing a scene.

125
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,021
WOO SEUL-GI

126
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,985
Darn it, will you knock first?

127
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,239
I don't know what nonsense you're up to,

128
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:34,240
but move.

129
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:35,324
I have work to do.

130
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,160
Take a shower if you just got home.

131
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,162
Was the class president vote today?

132
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,290
"Woo Seul-gi?"

133
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,710
- Is she your class president?
- Can't you just let me be?

134
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,587
Do you have to rub it in
by interrogating me?

135
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:49,505
Damn it.

136
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,132
Choi Gyung.

137
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:54,010
I never said
you had to be class president.

138
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,303
Why are you taking it out on me?

139
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:58,139
You're Nam Ji-yeon, the lawyer who was
class president for 12 years straight.

140
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:59,265
What would you know?

141
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:04,103
I'll take a shower.
Finish up by then and go to your room.

142
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:10,568
Fuck.

143
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:18,868
CASE FILE AND RECORD

144
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:26,292
Shouldn't the Institute
take some necessary measures?

145
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:30,796
I understand.

146
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:36,052
It looks like there will be an indictment.

147
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:37,595
I apologize.

148
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,515
Be gentle and offer to settle.

149
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,019
Get her to sign a petition
against the lawsuit.

150
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:47,980
Is that so hard to do?

151
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:52,234
A widow with a kid
will need a lot of money.

152
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,490
If only we can handle the press,
it's not a bad idea to drag it on.

153
00:10:57,573 --> 00:11:01,118
Proving medical malpractice
is close to impossible--

154
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,244
"Malpractice"?

155
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:09,293
How many times must I say
the patient arrived with cardiac arrest?

156
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:15,049
Our center did the best it could
to revive the patient.

157
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,509
I'll speak more cautiously.

158
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:18,469
Don't forget that what you say

159
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,930
represents our center and its staff.

160
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,932
And we're not dragging this out.

161
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,475
You must settle out of court.

162
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:26,477
Don't just offer a sum of money.

163
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,146
Yes, sir. I'll contact various channels.

164
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,565
- You can go now.
- Sir.

165
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:34,318
Oh, and sir,
we're missing some medication.

166
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:37,363
Most aren't covered by insurance
and are quite costly.

167
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,410
Just drop issues like that.

168
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:46,122
If there is a thief,
it's someone on our payroll.

169
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,916
If our family has a flaw,
we cover it up and help them.

170
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,251
Turn a blind eye.

171
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:51,877
Yes, sir.

172
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:55,214
HOSPITAL DIRECTOR YU TAE-JUN

173
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:49,393
Then did Na-ri's mom
put the apartment up for sale in a hurry?

174
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,228
- For how much?
- For 3.7 billion won.

175
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,230
My gosh, that's 300 million won cheaper.

176
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,316
- Yes.
- She must be strapped.

177
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,485
Why did she suddenly put it up for sale?

178
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,403
Isn't her daughter a high school senior?

179
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:02,740
The realtor says they're looking to move
to another neighborhood.

180

00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,210
Enjoy the food.

182
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:17,796
I offered to buy you something expensive,
and you wanted pizza?

183
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,090
The pizza here is my favorite.

184
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:23,260
The salty pepperoni pizza
with the greasy dip

185
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,553
is absolutely amazing.

186
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,722
Not to mention the fizzy coke.

187
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,935
It tastes even better since your mom
banned it because of your eczema.

188
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,855
Why aren't you eating?

189
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,525
I can't stay long.

190
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:38,442
SANITARY PADS

191
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:39,735
Are you meeting someone?

192
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:42,488
Is it Woo Seul-gi?

193
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:46,742
I said it's not charming to pry.

194
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:52,665
Je-i, you're not

195
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:56,418
actually interested in her, are you?

196
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:34,290
Je-i.

197
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,253
Can't you fold anything
other than paper cranes?

198
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,839
Like what?

199
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:44,800
Is there something you want?

200
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:52,516
PENCIL CASE COIN KARAOKE

201
00:14:54,685 --> 00:15:00,441
<i>Nobody told me</i>

202
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:09,658
<i>Should I come closer?</i>

203
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:19,585
<i>I find myself waiting again</i>

204
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:27,384
<i>- Why did I happen to</i>
<i>- Why did I happen to</i>

205
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:30,220
<i>Meet you?</i>

206
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,767
<i>Now, where should I</i>

207
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:39,563
<i>- Look as I go ahead?</i>
<i>- Look as I go ahead?</i>

208
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,900
- You know this song, too.
- Yes.

209
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,445
I have all of Lucid Fall
and Misoni albums.

210
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:47,738
You're a true fan.

211
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:51,617
The song sounds nicer in your voice.

212
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:53,202
What?

213
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,330
I love your voice.

214
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:57,998
It's sweet.

215
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,063
Gyung seemed really disappointed.

216
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:24,566
I didn't cause a rift, did I?

217
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:28,153
Don't mind that.
You know we weren't exactly close.

218
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,823
But it might not be easy for you
to join the medical club.

219
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,324
Gyung will likely object.

220
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,243
She would.

221
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,913
The night air is so nice.

222
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,457
I'm glad it stopped raining.

223
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,167
I thought

224
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,670
you wouldn't come.

225
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,424
Why? Are you angry I was late?

226
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,509
It's not that.

227
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:55,222
It's just that
everyone else forgets me easily.

228
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,976
So, I don't usually wait for them.

229
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,311
I don't like to wait.

230
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,064
Others might be like that,

231
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,150
but I always keep my word, so wait.

232
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:09,319
I might be a bit late, though.

233
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:14,825
Seul-gi.

234
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:15,951
Come to my place.

235
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,245
- Right now?
- Yes.

236
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:20,622
Come to my place, and we'll chat.

237
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,458
Then we'll sleep
and go to school together.

238
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,751
How's that? Cool, right?

239
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,756
Why? Your mom won't give permission?

240
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:29,840
Should I call her for you?

241
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:31,050
No, well,

242
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:34,053
she doesn't care if I come home late.

243
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,471
Then who cares?

244
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:37,723
Let's go to my place.

245
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:45,898
This is it.

246
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,002
Hey.

247
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,255
Did she scare you?

248
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,673
This is Je-yun, my sister.

249
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,343
Hi, Je-yun. Nice to meet you.

250
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,386
Were you in Je-na's room again?

251
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,429
Were you? Tell me.

252
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,016
I thought you were an only child.
You have an older sister?

253
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,352
Not right now.

254
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,772
Sorry, I shouldn't have mentioned it.

255
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:27,940
I don't mean she's dead.

256
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:31,235
But she might be.

257
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:34,321
Come in. This is my room.

258
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,291
- Je-i.
- Yes?

259
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:47,918
It's like we're underwater.

260
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,714
I went scuba diving on a trip once.

261
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,634
Everyone else said they were scared,

262
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,470
but I actually felt so relaxed.

263
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:03,934
The quiet, dark underwater felt like…

264
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:07,437
It felt like being in your mom's belly
before you were born?

265
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:10,023
Yes, exactly. It felt just like that.

266
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,568
I felt abandoned and alone,

267
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,028
but I didn't feel lonely at all.

268
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,448
It actually felt completely safe.

269
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:23,203
I've never tried it,
but I think I know the feeling.

270
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:26,707
Let's go together one day.
I'm sure you'll like it, too.

271
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,380
Hey.

272
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:36,884
No!

273
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:39,636
What have you done?

274
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:51,481
- I used to have the same dress.
- Did you like princess dresses, too?

275
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:54,151
I shouldn't have.

276
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,739
Dad.

277
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,116
Mom.

278
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,286
Mom.

279
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:08,457
Dad!

280
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:21,303
I never imagined
you suffered that kind of pain.

281
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,014
But how is that your fault?

282
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,140
It's not.

283
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,518
It's the adults' fault
for not doing a head count.

284
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,107
Thanks for telling me
such a difficult story.

285
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:44,159
Actually, I also have something
to confess.

286
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:46,078
What is it?

287
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:48,997
I'm not

288
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,460
Lucid Fall's true fan.

289
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,759
My sister was,
and I only know a few songs.

290
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,095
No wonder.

291
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,721
I thought so.

292
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:08,016
Thank you for telling me

293
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:10,560
the honest truth.

294
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,817
Should we get ready for bed?

295
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:26,636
- It's your first time, right?
- What?

296
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,598
Bathing with a friend.

297
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,767
I don't think so.

298
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:34,644
You're cuter when you're wet.

299
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:45,363
Why is your face so red?

300
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,619
I was in the hot water for too long.

301
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:52,996
I feel hot.

302
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:57,042
- You weren't having dirty thoughts?
- What kind of thoughts?

303
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,048
Thoughts like this.
