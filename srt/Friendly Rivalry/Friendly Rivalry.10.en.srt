1
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,345
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:13,930
NO CHILDREN OR ANIMALS WERE HARMED
IN THE MAKING OF THIS DRAMA

3
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:01,436
Hand over Mr. Woo's phone.

4
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,651
Would you kill me if I don't?

5
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:11,654
Is Je-yun a hostage?

6
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,666
Why does everyone have a scar?

7
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,336
You and Je-yun.

8
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,379
I missed you both.

9
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:30,715
Forget it.

10
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,177
Where were you all this while?

11
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,805
Dad knows about you
and Mr. Woo, doesn't he?

12
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,770
And that's why you said he killed Mr. Woo.

13
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:45,522
What about proof? Is there any?

14
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,023
The video on that phone.

15
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:49,776
That might prove motivation,
but it's circumstantial.

16
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:50,985
Is there any direct proof?

17
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,946
Me. I'm the witness.

18
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,031
Is that why you couldn't come home?

19
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,868
You don't know
what kind of scary freak Dad is.

20
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,454
So, give me Mr. Woo's phone.

21
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,623
You searched me,
so you should know I don't have it.

22
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:06,209
What are you going to do with it?

23
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,211
Can you really

24
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:11,297
keep a promise?

25
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,426
Je-i!

26
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,763
I think I'll lose my mind at this rate.

27
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,890
Mr. Woo's family should know the truth.

28
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,227
Calm down for now.

29
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,272
It's a burner phone.

30
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,232
I'll give you his phone, so take my calls.

31
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,734
I won't say I saw you.

32
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,194
Don't worry.

33
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,946
We're supposed to meet.

34
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,072
Who?

35
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:39,576
Who are you meeting?

36
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,497
<i>Can't you really get</i>
<i>in touch with Choi Su-jin?</i>

37
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,626
<i>Damn it, where the fuck is she?</i>

38
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,838
<i>Why doesn't anyone know where she is?</i>

39
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:58,636
<i>Hey, Woo Seul-gi.</i>

40
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,346
<i>Are you listening?</i>

41
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:03,474
<i>Hey, Woo Seul-gi.</i>

42
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:04,893
<i>Hello?</i>

43
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,060
<i>Answer me, damn it.</i>

44
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:08,062
<i>Hey!</i>

45
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:12,650
<i>What are you doing?</i>

46
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:17,030
<i>Damn it.</i>

47
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:20,241
I'll call you back later.

48
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,293
You want to go to medical school?

49
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:34,339
Have you seen a corpse before?

50
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,177
I got lost.

51
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,261
Sorry, sir.

52
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,767
All these bodies' identities are unknown.

53
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:49,062
They were discarded,
and not even their families came for them.

54
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,066
You know,

55
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:58,446
I practice operating every day
to perfect my skills.

56
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:03,159
Isn't that illegal?

57
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,329
I take in corpses of people

58
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:09,165
whose families refuse to treat
because they can't afford a funeral.

59
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,251
I even cremate them afterward.

60
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,586
If you think about it,
it benefits everyone.

61
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:21,094
These corpses are a huge headache
for the local government.

62
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,680
Joint funerals and whatnot.

63
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,431
They take up a lot of taxes.

64
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,021
The poor thing.

65
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:38,194
She must've grown up in an orphanage
and lived on the streets.

66
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,281
Heavenly Father.

67
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,199
There is a lost lamb before me.

68
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:47,495
Her body may be here,
but may her soul find eternal peace…

69
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:02,093
If you want to study medicine,
you must not fear blood or organs.

70
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:04,971
Soon, you'll experience it for yourself,

71
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:09,100
if you stay quiet and manage
to get into medical school.

72
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:56,564
Je-i.

73
00:05:58,775 --> 00:05:59,901
Please come in.

74
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,493
This is a detective
from the local police station.

75
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,870
He's here about the incident
at the school festival.

76
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:14,582
I know you're busy studying,
but cooperate as best you can.

77
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,131
Beom-su doesn't exactly have friends.

78
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,469
She's not an outcast.

79
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,179
We don't have such things.

80
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,016
She just prefers to be left alone.

81
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,227
I often saw her take medication.

82
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,229
How would I know what it was for?

83
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,024
I'm positive she wasn't in a good way.

84
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:43,569
She sweated a lot and drank lots of water.

85
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,030
Her eyes were bloodshot, too.

86
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:49,492
I wondered if she was ill or something.

87
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,327
I don't know anything.

88
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:53,746
I'm a victim, too.

89
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:58,417
I want to major in harp,
but I hurt my hand and can't practice.

90
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:01,129
I'm done for.

91
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,923
Beom-su complained
she didn't get in the top 20.

92
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:07,468
She said she could've gotten in the top 20
if it weren't for the transfer student.

93
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:08,719
She was upset about it.

94
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:13,266
Oh, the transfer student
is the girl that got stabbed.

95
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:15,935
Woo Seul-gi.

96
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,905
Thanks for taking time from your busy day.

97
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,158
I have just a few questions.

98
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,951
According to the other girls,

99
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:35,955
you are Seul-gi's closest friend.
Is that true?

100
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:43,671
What exactly do you want to know
about Seul-gi?

101
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:49,760
You should rest more.

102
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,888
You're just as stubborn as your dad.

103
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,431
I'm a senior.

104
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:55,141
Rest is a luxury.

105
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,184
Okay.

106
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,270
Don't accept her apology right away.

107
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,902
Last time, you came by
when I had a visitor.

108
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,410
<i>He was from the medical center.</i>

109
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,620
He told me to settle.

110
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:21,334
Thank you.

111
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,097
Woo Seul-gi.

112
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:37,725
- Wait.
- Why?

113
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,106
Madam Principal.

114
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,151
Woo Seul-gi came to school.
What shall I do?

115
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,405
Yes.

116
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,324
I'm with her right now.

117
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,286
I didn't expect to meet you so soon.

118
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:01,123
Can we do this
without her guardian present?

119
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,252
She grew up at an orphanage.

120
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,088
I know that, but still…

121
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:11,509
For causing an incident
at the most important time for the seniors

122
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:13,844
that ended up
ruining the studious atmosphere,

123
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:17,723
we're extremely sorry, Madam Principal.

124
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:28,234
I also have a guardian.

125
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:32,655
<i>Hello, Ms. Nam.</i>

126
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,198
<i>Is the meetup is 6 p.m.?</i>

127
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,617
<i>Wouldn't it be best if I came with you?</i>

128
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,995
I'll go on my own today.

129
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,831
<i>Call me during the meeting</i>
<i>if anything comes up.</i>

130
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,791
- I will. Thank you.
<i>- Bye.</i>

131
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:48,629
SEUL-GI

132
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,979
Hello, Ms. Kwon.
What brings you to school?

133
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:06,731
I'm Woo Seul-gi's guardian.

134
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:15,406
As you all know, this incident
greatly tarnished our school's reputation.

135
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:18,909
Who was rash enough
to call the police so soon?

136
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:21,245
I find that comment quite strange,
Madam Principal.

137
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,831
There's a clear victim.

138
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,542
The perpetrator should be punished.

139
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,294
Seul-gi wasn't hurt too badly

140
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:30,463
and managed to come to school right away.

141
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:33,591
This could've been taken care of
within the school,

142
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:34,759
but instead, it snowballed.

143
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,218
I'm only saying it's a shame.

144
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,553
Before you take care of things,

145
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,722
I'd appreciate a sincere apology.

146
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:43,851
Forcing Seul-gi
to sit across from her attacker

147
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,645
is too much for her to handle yet.

148
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,271
You're all too cruel.

149
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,482
Just a moment.

150
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,067
Who are you calling an attacker?

151
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,944
Don't you think you've been speaking
a bit too harshly?

152
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:57,615
Who here doesn't know
that Beom-su stabbed Seul-gi?

153
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,202
There were dozens,
even hundreds of witnesses.

154
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,620
The case is under investigation.

155
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:03,954
Refrain from such comments.

156
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,582
Based on the outcome alone,

157
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,042
Beom-su did lash out,

158
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,960
but we heard that Seul-gi
provided the cause.

159
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:16,050
Beom-su, you tell us what happened.

160
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:19,637
It's okay, Beom-su.
Tell the truth about what happened.

161
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:24,809
Seul-gi told me.

162
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:29,772
I was stressing out
about my midterm grades.

163
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,107
She gave me pills

164
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:34,026
and said taking them together
would cheer me up.

165
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:37,988
Kim Beom-su.

166
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,282
When did I say that?

167
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:42,868
Woo Seul-gi.

168
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:44,453
Is that true?

169
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:47,915
It's not.

170
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,710
I never gave Beom-su any pills.

171
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,130
Seul-gi.

172
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:57,258
If this is true, we can't just let it go.

173
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,301
What are you all trying to do?

174
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,221
- Seul-gi. We're leaving.
- No.

175
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:04,974
Why should I leave when I'm innocent?

176
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:08,811
I did not give Beom-su any medication.

177
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,647
Are you saying my daughter's lying?

178
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,691
You sold me the pills.

179
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,734
And gave me the cocktail recipe.

180
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,320
Beom-su.

181
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,322
What pills did Seul-gi give you?

182
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,490
Ms. Kim.

183
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:23,993
She told me to take

184
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:26,912
six white pills with one pink pill

185
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:27,913
so I'd feel ecstatic.

186
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,625
If pills were exchanged
on school grounds, this is serious.

187
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:34,086
There must be a thorough investigation

188
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,088
whether she sold to others,
not just Beom-su.

189
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,215
I thought it was just a rumor.

190
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,510
This is happening
because we accepted a transfer student.

191
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,054
It wasn't me!

192
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,934
I recently checked
my homeroom students' belongings

193
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,352
and interviewed them in private.

194
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,439
They all told me similar stories.

195
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,150
"Recently"?

196
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,195
If it's true,
it's been going on for a long time.

197
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,405
I'll summon
the School Anti-violence Committee

198
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:04,658
and discuss if Woo Seul-gi
should be expelled or not.

199
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,577
You'll expel her
without confirming the truth?

200
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,663
If someone must be expelled,
it should be Beom-su.

201
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:12,124
You can't expel the victim.

202
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,501
That's nonsense.

203
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,252
It wasn't me.

204
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,421
You keep saying it wasn't you.

205
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:20,090
Do you know who's selling the pills?

206
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,514
I'm from Gangnam Police Station.

207
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,432
Is the student called Woo Seul-gi here?

208
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,897
We got a call, so we have to look into it.

209
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,316
Did you steal pills
from the J Medical Center?

210
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,069
What did you do with them?

211
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,987
Did you sell them to your friends?

212
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,739
Did you? Why?

213
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:45,241
It wasn't me.

214
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,450
Okay.

215
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,285
I want to believe you, too.

216
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,495
But there's proof.

217
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,665
On the day of your checkup,

218
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,959
the surveillance camera caught you

219
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,336
walking toward the pharmacy.

220
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,671
That was…

221
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:04,051
<i>You were filmed running all over the place</i>
<i>looking for the pharmacy.</i>

222
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,887
<i>I have something</i>
<i>you really need right now.</i>

223
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,139
<i>Come over.</i>

224
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,058
You sold what you stole then

225
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,893
to Kim Beom-su during the school festival.

226
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,771
She stuck to the recipe you told her,
swallowed the pills,

227
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:17,231
and caused the disaster.

228
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:21,443
You must tell us the truth
to consider extenuating circumstances.

229
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,280
Don't you want to go to college?

230
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,410
Yu Je-i.

231
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:30,619
Yu Je-i?

232
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,080
She's selling the pills.

233
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,124
It's not me.

234
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:38,711
It's Yu Je-i.

235
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,713
Hey, guys.

236
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:41,797
Have you heard?

237
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,883
Beom-su was out of her mind on some drugs,

238
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,135
and it was Woo Seul-gi
who sold her the pills.

239
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,553
- No way.
- Seriously?

240
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:49,722
- I knew something was off.
- Isn't that just amazing?

241
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,390
She reaped what she sowed.

242
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,893
It was originally you
whom Beom-su wanted to stab.

243
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,561
Not Seul-gi.

244
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,905
Seul-gi.

245
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:12,703
Cho A-ra.

246
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:14,705
We need to talk.

247
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,238
What did Ms. Kim say?

248
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:52,034
How does it feel that Seul-gi,
the girl you trusted, gave up your name?

249
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,287
- What do you mean?
- Woo Seul-gi.

250
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,247
She said to the police

251
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,583
that you sold the pills to Beom-su.

252
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,338
So what?

253
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,049
What did you say?

254
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,009
- Now you care about me?
- Hey.

255
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,515
I shouldn't have started this.

256
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:16,934
Even if you're caught,
you have an influential dad,

257
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,311
and I'm nowhere in that league.

258
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,773
It was stupid of me to trust you.

259
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,952
Is that student's name Woo Seul-gi?

260
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:35,953
Yes.

261
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,872
The school's getting unsettled over it.

262
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:42,167
Things will get sorted out soon.
Don't worry too much.

263
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,253
I really hope nothing worse happens.

264
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:48,465
Be sure to keep the students calm
so they don't become agitated.

265
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,551
I'm doing my best.

266
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,440
Let's go. I'll take you home.

267
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,358
I have plans.

268
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:08,736
Let's talk a bit.

269
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:09,987
We can talk here.

270
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:12,865
We can talk later, then.

271
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:14,158
I have nothing to say to you.

272
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,702
I'll call you later.

273
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,122
You know,

274
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:23,292
I don't feel bad for you at all.

275
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:28,130
Why should I take the fall
for something I didn't do?

276
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,551
What did I do wrong?

277
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,512
It's always like this.

278
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:38,807
I'm the easy prey.

279
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:41,852
Do you think I should just take it
without a complaint

280
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:43,145
because I'm beneath you?

281
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,106
Did you think I would?

282
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,443
Yes.

283
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:51,570
Well done.

284
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,535
Seul-gi.

285
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:03,916
Hey, Seul-gi's boyfriend is here.

286
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:05,125
- What?
- Her boyfriend?

287
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,340
He must be here to carry her bag
since her shoulder's hurt.

288
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,217
How sweet of him.

289
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,372
Did you tell your friends
I was your boyfriend?

290
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,458
Why did you ignore your boyfriend's calls?

291
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,669
I couldn't answer because I was in class.

292
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,087
So what now?

293
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,088
Where are the pills?

294
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,557
Did you really just keep these?

295
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:03,892
The stab wound must hurt a lot.

296
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:07,729
It's bearable.

297
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,106
That's that, then.

298
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,943
How did you get your supply
since you moved to Seoul?

299
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,027
That's…

300
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,364
I tried going to clinics
to get a prescription like before.

301
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:19,741
The process here is stricter
than the countryside, and…

302
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,786
You're way too long-winded.

303
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:24,997
Get to the point.

304
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,421
I used social media.

305
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:33,755
Social media?

306
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:38,177
What's the business plan
you mentioned last time?

307
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,179
Oh, that?

308
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,181
I did some market research around here.

309
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:46,310
There's talk that a high school girl
controls everything.

310
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,020
Do you know who it is?

311
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,481
I don't know.

312
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:57,362
We'll subdue her
and take over the neighborhood.

313
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,280
How's that?

314
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,535
You're the top in your entire year.

315
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,204
You're a PR model of sorts.

316
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:08,707
"My kid took these pills
and now does so well in school."

317
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,042
That's our PR strategy.

318
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,376
How's that?

319
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:12,961
Isn't that awesome?

320
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:23,805
So, stop beating around the bush and talk.

321
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:25,474
Your transactions.

322
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,318
SELLING CONSOTINE

323
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:43,283
Place an order.

324
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:44,993
Right now?

325
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:49,081
Accounts like this
always get deleted to avoid detection.

326
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:59,549
CAN I GET…

327
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:02,844
CAN I GET 30 PILLS OF CST 27 MG?

328
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,186
Send me your username and password.

329
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,608
You won't turn Seul-gi
into a criminal, will you?

330
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,612
Even if she were to claim
that I was at the center,

331
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:21,738
who would believe her?

332
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:23,699
Even if someone believes her,

333
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:28,912
no one can fault you for stealing supplies
from her dad's hospital.

334
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:32,708
It's time you stopped
selling pills to your schoolmates.

335
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,711
I put up with it for long enough.

336
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:40,299
What I do just for fun
could crush Seul-gi's dream.

337
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:42,342
I thought that was what you wanted.

338
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,803
Why did you think so?

339
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,434
She stood outside the pharmacy
and looked around.

340
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:51,977
The cameras got a great shot.

341
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,062
PHARMACY

342
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,315
She got on my nerves for many reasons,

343
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,358
but thanks to you,
I can get rid of her for good.

344
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:02,237
I know you had someone steal
Mr. Woo's phone.

345
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:08,076
There was something interesting on it
that would make you want to kill Mr. Woo.

346
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:12,539
Yes.

347
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:16,168
If you want to see her live with the brand

348
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:19,338
that her dad raped one of his students,

349
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,214
do as you wish.

350
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:29,639
Je-i, I think
you have a pretty cruel hobby.

351
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,979
I should directly ask
whether it was rape or not.

352
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:38,774
I'll ask Yu Je-na.

353
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:45,697
CHOI GYUNG

354
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:49,951
How would I know
my missing sister's number?

355
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:53,413
But you don't seem to know it, either.

356
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:15,185
The sum of an arithmetic series
is when each number

357
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:16,770
is connected with a plus sign.

358
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:20,023
When the sum converges,
the limit of the general term becomes 0.

359
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,775
What about the contra-position?

360
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:24,152
In the contra-position, if the limit of…

361
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,362
<i>I scheduled a meetup.</i>

362
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:27,489
<i>Gangnam Station exit number 4 at 6 p.m.</i>

363
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:28,949
<i>Come to the storage lockers.</i>

364
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:33,620
DEFERRED PAYMENT ONLY
AT 6:30 P.M. ARRIVE ON THE DOT

365
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:36,706
<i>Deferred payment only.</i>

366
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,041
<i>At 6:30 p.m.</i>

367
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,085
<i>Arrive on the dot.</i>

368
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:42,212
<i>Deferred payment only.</i>

369
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:43,421
<i>At 6:30 p.m.</i>

370
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,423
<i>Arrive on the dot.</i>

371
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:46,800
<i>Which of them is it?</i>

372
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:48,593
If the absolute value is smaller…

373
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,513
WHAT'S THE PASSCODE?

374
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:54,808
Just wait until I get you.

375
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,524
That's all for today.

376
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:03,608
Make sure to review.

377
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:06,945
Ms. Kim, I have a question.

378
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:28,508
Shoot.

379
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,432
Where is everything
you had in the club room?

380
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:37,100
I got rid of it all.

381
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,518
You got rid of them?

382
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:39,603
I sold them.

383
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:40,562
To whom?

384
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:43,732
Answer me!

385
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:44,983
Don't yell at me.

386
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:46,026
You must be crazy.

387
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:47,527
You're the one who's crazy.

388
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,362
You lost your mind over a bumpkin.

389
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:53,033
What if it's a trap Seul-gi set?

390
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:54,784
If she's working with the police

391
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:57,579
to catch the supplier to clear her name,

392
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,289
both of us will be done for.

393
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:00,332
Don't worry.

394
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,667
I called the police myself.

395
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:04,169
What?

396
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:06,338
<i>- Do you get it?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

397
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:07,839
Come over if you get stuck again.

398
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,299
- Thank you.
- Sure.

399
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:21,895
Is this the police?

400
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,397
I want to report something.

401
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:27,275
Woo Seul-gi will be caught red-handed.

402
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:31,988
I left some pills in a locker
at Gangnam Station and also in her bag.

403
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:33,365
There's no getting out of that.

404
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:36,243
Yu Je-i, where are you going?

405
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:37,202
Give me my phone!

406
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,835
YU JE-I

407
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:48,129

<i>Mr. Woo's phone as promised.</i>

411
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,280
<i>Meet me at Gangnam Station exit four.</i>

412
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:16,074
<i>You'd better show up</i>
<i>before I change my mind.</i>

00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,692

<i>I'll bring your husband's phone.</i>
<i>Please wait.</i>

424
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,001
Hello?

425
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:39,551
<i>The damn seller's so fucking suspicious.</i>

426
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:42,595

430
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:03,450

431
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,243
<i>The phone is in the locker.</i>

432
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:32,562
Shoot.

433
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:51,873
Je-i.

434
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:54,667
What a relief.

Hang on. Don't.

Let me go.

441
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:33,623
Don't do this.

00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:36,543
Let go of me!
