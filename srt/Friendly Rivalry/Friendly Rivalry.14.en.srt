1
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,345
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:13,930
NO CHILDREN OR ANIMALS WERE HARMED
IN THE MAKING OF THIS DRAMA

3
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:25,775
I'll be in touch.

4
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:40,874
Je-i.

5
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:57,348
So, everything you've told me was a lie?

6
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:59,225
Yes.

7
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,687
I found the torn-out page
from your sister's diary.

8
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,731
I never told anyone this yet,

9
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:08,777
but Je-na has a video
of the operating room.

10
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:14,157
We need to get that
before your dad gets his hands on it.

11
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:18,912
Ye-ri would never miss
an opportunity like this.

12
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,872
You set a trap for my dad.

13
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:25,710
Your dad even killed his daughter
to cover up his crime.

14
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:29,047
He must think it's all over,
but if he finds out there's evidence…

15
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:30,757
Then, he'll make a move.

16
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,925
Right.

17
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,677
And I plan on tracking him.

18
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:38,139
I need your help, Je-i.

19
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,700
<i>We need to show him</i>
<i>that we're desperately looking</i>

20
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,994
<i>for Je-na's video of the operating room.</i>

21
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,043
MAGNOLIA HOTEL

22
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:14,968
<i>Then, my dad will clean up her room</i>
<i>before we get there.</i>

23
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:37,407
But I wonder how your dad knew

24
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,617
that Je-na would be
at Gangnam Station that day.

25
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,299
Hey, come here.

26
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,777
<i>Do you have any idea what will happen</i>
<i>if they acquire the video first?</i>

27
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,572
<i>You caused this mess, so you clean it up.</i>

28
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:20,283
<i>- I already booked my flight.</i>
<i>- No.</i>

29
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:23,244
<i>You're not going anywhere</i>
<i>before you fix this.</i>

30
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,662
<i>You want to lock me up as well?</i>

31
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:26,539
<i>I dare you to do it.</i>

32
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,541
<i>What have you ever done as her mother?</i>

33
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,501
<i>You should go calm her down!</i>

34
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,724
<i>Our plan worked.</i>

35
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,518
<i>My mom will go meet Je-na tomorrow.</i>

36
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,281
- Here.
- Hey.

37
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,910
Where are you guys going?

38
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:04,994
Are you not telling me?

39
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,538
Tell your mom that Je-na
will take the stand tomorrow.

40
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,165
- What?
- We'll call you.

41
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:11,960
But…

42
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:42,949
3 HOURS BEFORE THE TRIAL

43
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,024
Where on earth is she headed?

44
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:24,073
15 MINUTES INTO THE TRIAL

45
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,328
Your honor,
I request an additional witness.

46
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:30,705
Objection.

47
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,373
This has not been discussed.

48
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:33,791
It's the only witness

49
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:37,295
who was in the OR with Yu Tae-jun
the day Woo Do-hyeok died.

50
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:40,590
Please understand that I was unable
to inform you in advance

51
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,467
for the safety of the witness.

52
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,058
The witness request

53
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:53,478
has been granted.

54
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,066
The court will take a short recess.

55
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:06,240
Dr. Yu, is there something I don't know?

56
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:09,243
It's all good.

57
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,126
Je-i.

58
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,379
Yes?

59
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,304
<i>How did it go?</i>

60
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:29,472
<i>Where are you now?</i>

61
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,182
Well, ma'am…

62
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,072
- Hello.
- Hello.

63
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,658
- Welcome.
- How have you been?

64
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:51,494
Hi, all.

65
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:54,122
- Hello.
- Hello.

66
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:56,666
<i>Seul-gi.</i>

67
00:06:56,749 --> 00:07:00,461
<i>I don't think I can bring Je-na.</i>

68
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,171
I'll take a photo of you.

69
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,131
Sure.

70
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:06,092
Look here. In 1, 2, 3.

71
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,844
He fucking tricked us.

72
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,346
Fuck!

73
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,900
The witness isn't coming,

74
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,694
- so put the article on hold.
- Yes, sir.

75
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,703
Come.

76
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,712
COURT

77
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:59,896
Je-i, it's time to go home.

78
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,284
I'll call you later.

79
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,335
Come on.

80
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:34,013
She even took photos
with the kids at the nursery

81
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,558
as if she wanted me to see it.

82
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,186
How did Je-i react?

83
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,608
She was angrier than I was.

84
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:48,528
She couldn't find Je-na, after all.

85
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,780
I hope this doesn't sound offensive…

86
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:56,410
but do you think
you might have put too much faith in Je-i?

87
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,748
<i>Our plan worked.</i>

88
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,668
<i>My mom will go meet Je-na tomorrow.</i>

89
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,719
If you weren't wrong
about where Je-i's mom was headed,

90
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,471
your plan must have gotten out.

91
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:18,975
What are you trying to say?

92
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,230
There's no way.

93
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,027
Yu Tae-jun remained composed
throughout the trial.

94
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,866
It felt like he was prepared
for all the evidence we had.

95
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,119
When we requested Je-na as a witness,

96
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:40,538
he rather calmed his own lawyer.

97
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:45,668
As if he knew that we'd never be able
to bring Je-na to the court.

98
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:00,224
Where are you taking me?

99
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:14,739
<i>And I've always wondered</i>

100
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:17,366
<i>why Je-na was in the operating room.</i>

101
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:22,496
<i>Well, because Je-i's dad is suspicious.</i>

102
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,464
He could have just given her
the exam sheet.

103
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,091
Why bring her to the operation?

104
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:40,931
Oh, what's going on?

105
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,070
24GI 3408

106
00:10:58,699 --> 00:10:59,784
Seul-gi.

107
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,120
Seul-gi?

108
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,455
Are you all right?

109
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,431
<i>Seul-gi, are you hurt?</i>

110
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,809
Je-i, do you also wonder…

111
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:26,435
<i>You're okay.</i>

112
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,483
…why your sister was
in the operating room that day?

113
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,282
Je-na, why are you here?

114
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:22,408
Let's get out of here.

115
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,336
What have you done to her?

116
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,800
If you're asking what happened,

117
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,802
it wasn't me, but your sister.

118
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:23,719
Did I do a good job, Dad?

119
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,529
You're lying.

120
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:45,366
Do you think I'll stop
if you tell me that she's the killer?

121
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:48,619
Or you just want to believe
that I killed Mr. Woo Do-hyeok

122
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,997
since that will justify your defiance.

123
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:56,168
If Je-na had the video
of the incident in the OR,

124
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,503
I wish I could show you.

125
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,755
That way, I can prove my innocence.

126
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,509
Je-i, think about it.

127
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:06,220
Imagine how much trouble
I had to go through

128
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:08,430
to report her dead
when she's clearly alive.

129
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,560
I'm sick and tired
of cleaning up after her.

130
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,689
Je-na, tell me.

131
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,857
Did you kill Mr. Woo?

132
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,069
Tell me!

133
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:24,280
She was greatly tormented.

134
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,825
So, I erased some of her memory.

135
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,290
You're the one who put her up to it.

136
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,333
You totally failed as a father.

137
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:39,128
You have no right to say
that you went through any trouble for her.

138
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:43,549
You merely didn't want to accept
that you had a broken daughter.

139
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,010
Am I wrong?

140
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,475
Je-i, I'm doing all of this for your sake.

141
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,896
I'm only trying to protect everything
you've worked so hard for

142
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,732
from being tainted
by your sister's scandal.

143
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,069
Can't you see how I feel?

144
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,240
That's funny.

145
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,702
I never thought you had feelings.

146
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,586
Don't worry, Dad.

147
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,213
I'm not like her.

148
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,675
I'll gladly be the daughter
that you can be proud of,

149
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,094
which you clearly want.

150
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:33,933
You'll have to…

151
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,187
keep that promise.

152
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,661
The tire is completely flat.

153
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:56,205
You could've seen it with the naked eye.

154
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,040
Wait.

155
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,501
It wasn't worn out?

156
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,378
Pardon?

157
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,380
Unless someone is praying for your death,

158
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,882
no one would put a hole
in the tire like that.

159
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,050
Right?

160
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,679
YU JE-I

161
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,319
What did he say?

162
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,197
The tire was so old
that it lost all the air.

163
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,657
He seriously told me off.

164
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,119
So, we just need to change the tire?

165
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:36,662
No, I'm going to scrap it.

166
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,622
That car is a total junk.

167
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:42,376
Your dad said he bought it
when you were born,

168
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:44,169
so it's almost 20 years old.

169
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,510
I'm sorry.

170
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,721
I should have asked you first.

171
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:54,972
Do you want to keep it?

172
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,473
Oh, no.

173
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:59,018
What if something like that happens again?

174
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,227
Let's scrap it.

175
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,480
I'm too tired to cook.

176
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:04,732
Let's eat out tonight.

177
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:08,318
I'd like that.

178
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:14,992
That's it.

179
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:17,244
Stay strong, everyone.

180
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:18,954
The CSAT is just around the corner.

181
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:19,955
Study hard today.

182
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,583
Ms. Kim.

183
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:26,003
Je-i is absent.

184
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:27,671
Yes.

185
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:30,215
She won't be coming to school for a while
because she's sick.

186
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,592
She's sick?

187
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:33,719
What's the sickness?

188
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,471
You should know that better than anybody.

189
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:38,682
You're her best friend.

190
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,948
<i>The number you have dialed</i>
<i>is out of service.</i>

191
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:57,618
<i>Please check the number and try again.</i>

192
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:30,025
<i>The number you have dialed</i>
<i>is out of service.</i>

193
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,223
Hey, kid!

194
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,891
This is a restricted area.

195
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,685
I'm a friend of Je-i's. I'm here for her.

196
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,186
I'll call security if you resist.

197
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,773
What's the commotion?

198
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,192
Sorry.

199
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:16,405
Please leave now.

200
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,032
Leave, please.

201
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,124
Je-i!

202
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,625
Don't come near me.

203
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:37,885
I couldn't reach you,
and I was worried about you.

204
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,679
Why aren't you coming to school?

205
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:42,514
Are you really ill?

206
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,727
Don't just stand there. Let me see you.

207
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,523
How do you place first
when you're so dull?

208
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:54,276
What?

209
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,861
Do you still not understand

210
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,488
why I keep you around?

211
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,574
<i>Dad!</i>

212
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:06,205
Is it true that Je-na gave up on the CSAT?

213
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,748
Lower your voice.

214
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:10,292
It's already all over the Internet.

215
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,462
That the top student of Chaehwa High
and the daughter of J Medical Center

216
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,297
ran away during the CSAT.

217
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:16,965
Je-i.

218
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:18,884
Head back home.

219
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:20,636
Where is she now?

220
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,850
Je-na needs absolute rest at the moment.

221
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:29,937
She won't be coming home anytime soon.

222
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:35,067
<i>Mr. Woo, who left to draft CSAT questions,</i>
<i>died on my dad's operating table,</i>

223
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,360
<i>and my sister disappeared.</i>

224
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:39,279
Once again, it all came down
to the killer question on the CSAT.

225
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,365
Who wants to try solving it?

226
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,117
All right, Gyung.

227
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:03,845
<i>The exact math problem she had solved</i>
<i>the day before was the killer problem,</i>

228
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:06,473
<i>and I had a hunch.</i>

229
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,268
<i>When I saw your name in Je-na's files,</i>

230
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:11,061
<i>I was convinced</i>

231
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:14,439
<i>that Mr. Woo leaked the CSAT questions.</i>

232
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:18,402
<i>Your transfer to our school</i>
<i>must have been part of the deal.</i>

233
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:23,532
Seul-gi,

234
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,743
you were like the litmus paper to me.

235
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:30,080
Something to prove my dad's guilt.

236
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:35,669
I watched as he gave you a hard time,
treating you like a thorn in his side.

237
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,713
It was so much fun.

238
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,259
I get it.

239
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:45,429
You can stop now.

240
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,766
I actually had a genuine question for you.

241
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:54,938
Did you honestly think
that I was on your side?

242
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:57,941
I mean, think about it.

243
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,277
Who sold you the drugs?

244
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,738
Who stole Mr. Woo's phone?

245
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,824
Who suggested that we hide the fact
that the body had been swapped?

246
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:07,034
It was all me,

247
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:09,494
not my dad.

248
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:20,339
All right.

249
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,925
I almost gave it away
a few times along the way.

250
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,219
I was worried you might figure it out,

251
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,056
but I was so relieved

252
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,391
that you bought it every time.

253
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,400
It's been fun.

254
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:51,328
You people can never defeat us.

255
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:56,583
So, stop looking for my sister.

256
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,377
That's my final warning.

257
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:32,470
