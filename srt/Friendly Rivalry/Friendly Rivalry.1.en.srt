00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:31,740
<i>I must've known that even as a kid.</i>

00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:33,033
<i>When we went on a picnic,</i>

8
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,870
<i>I must've insisted on wearing</i>
<i>a princess dress instead of my uniform.</i>

9
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:47,422
<i>I think we went to the beach.</i>

10
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,924
<i>Was it by the East Sea? The West Sea?</i>

11
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:54,137
<i>No? Was it the South Sea?</i>

12
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:58,933
<i>I don't remember where, actually.</i>

13
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:06,691
<i>All I do remember is that, at one moment,</i>
<i>I was left alone with everyone gone.</i>

14
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,361
<i>I wonder sometimes, even now.</i>

00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:14,074
<i>If I'd listened to Mom</i>

16

00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:40,892
<i>Even at the orphanage, my lack of presence</i>
<i>was pretty much the same.</i>

19
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:46,940
<i>No one looked out for me,</i>
<i>so I often missed meals.</i>

20
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:54,614
<i>On days I went hungry,</i>

21
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,700
<i>I'd go outside at night</i>
<i>to drink tap water.</i>

22
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,831
<i>What I found odd was</i>

23
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:05,625
<i>however much I drank, I never felt full.</i>

24
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:10,338
<i>It felt like the water I drank</i>
<i>was leaking.</i>

26
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:14,759
<i>We had an unusual school commute system.</i>

27
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,054
<i>We shared a van</i>
<i>and got dropped off one by one.</i>

28
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:21,099
<i>If the van didn't have the orphanage logo,</i>

29
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:24,519
<i>I'd have lied and said I was coming from</i>

00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:52,005
<i>I'd been invisible all my life,</i>
<i>and to think I got noticed for this…</i>

33
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:54,257
<i>It was the worst.</i>

34
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,928
<i>Do you know something?</i>

35
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,347
<i>People like us can't get a reference,</i>

36
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,224
<i>so it's hard to get</i>
<i>even ordinary part-time jobs.</i>

37
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:08,563
<i>The so-called senior from the orphanage</i>
<i>got us a job like he was doing us a favor,</i>

38
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:09,856
<i>but it was buying medications.</i>

39
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,901

Where do you rank in your class?

48
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,327
I'm at around 15th.

49
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:48,830
That's not bad.

50
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:52,125
There are about 30 kids in a class now,
so it's not exactly good.

51
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,544
What do you want to be when you grow up?

52
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,630
I don't know. I never thought about it.

53
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,008
People should have dreams.

54
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:05,638
Was your dream to prey upon poor kids
and sell medication?

55
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:10,727
Take it.

56
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,562
Gangnam kids would do anything
to get them.

57
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:23,573
Study hard

58

<i>If that had come from a decent adult</i>
<i>who studied hard and had a decent job,</i>

59
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,207
<i>I probably wouldn't have listened.</i>

60
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,794
<i>Was it because it came</i>
<i>from a good-for-nothing bully?</i>

61
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,380
<i>It was strangely persuasive.</i>

62
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:43,092
<i>So, for the first time in my life,</i>
<i>I did something called "studying."</i>

63
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,261
<i>Would you believe it?</i>

64
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,141
<i>I used to be 15th in my class.</i>

67
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:10,870
<i>The number on my report card</i>
<i>seemed to have great power.</i>

68
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,790
<i>People started treating me differently.</i>

69
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,877
<i>Once I started feeling full</i>
<i>even without eating,</i>

70
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:19,962
<i>I yearned for more.</i>

71
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,591

75
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,075

76
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:16,329
<i>even the punks</i>
<i>who just couldn't stop bullying me</i>

77
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:18,039

Do as you're told and hand it over.

00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,544
- Come on.
<i>- Whatever happened,</i>

80
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,588
<i>I had to go on being number one.</i>

81
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:29,759
<i>The thought of going back?</i>

82
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,386
<i>I hated that more than death itself.</i>

83
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,022
"Often found around us…"

84
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:44,565

00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:36,033
What?

87
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,370
Forget it. Let's go.

88
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:45,251
Oh, by the way, this is my last day.

89
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:47,962
I'm moving to Seoul.

90
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:51,257
To Seoul? Where in Seoul?

91
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:53,968
Gangnam?

92
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:56,429
Were you adopted by some rich family?

93
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,515
I found my dad.

94
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:16,365
<i>Students took the 2024</i>

95
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,327
<i>and it is said to be</i>
<i>the hardest in recent history.</i>

96
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:21,579
<i>The head of the committee</i>

97
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,707
<i>that set the questions said</i>
<i>the difficulty was similar to last year,</i>

98
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,501
<i>but the students felt differently.</i>

99
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:31,339
<i>The "killer" math problems</i>
<i>were much harder than expected,</i>

100
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:34,050
<i>and whether the top scorers</i>
<i>get into medical school…</i>

101
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,427
Seul-gi, you got a call from Seoul.

102
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,595
<i>The scores of electives…</i>

103
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:38,638
Okay.

104
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,765
<i>…could also affect university placement.</i>

105
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,392
<i>As some electives were more difficult</i>
<i>than others,</i>

106
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:47,313
<i>the Korea Institute for Curriculum</i>
<i>and Evaluation will take public appeals</i>

107
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:50,149
<i>before sending out the report cards</i>
<i>next month on the eighth.</i>

108
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:52,068

109
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:56,739
<i>One member of the question-setting</i>

4 MONTHS LATER

112
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,053
Thank you.

113
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,187
Call me before your afternoon lesson.

114
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,480
I'll come get you.

115
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:14,817
I'll see what happens.

116
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,158
Hey, Choi Gyung.

117
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:26,537
- Wait up.
- Who was that guy?

118
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,998
Oh, my sweet little Gyung.

119
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,792
You always pretend not to care about me.
When did you see him?

120
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,378
We met at a recital last week.

121
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,130
You'll break up soon, then.

122
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,381
Yes. I just dumped him.

123
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,425
But he didn't seem to know that.

124
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:42,094
The poor creature. Blessings upon him.

125
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,139
Can I ask you something?

126
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,641
Why do you walk so fast?

127
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,143
We're seniors now.

128
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:52,021
It's quicker to walk
than to drive in traffic.

129
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:55,441
And I was right.

130
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:59,487
At this speed, I can get from my place
to my desk in class in 20 minutes.

131
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,949
Hey, Choi Gyun. I asked you to wait up.

132
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:28,891
Hello.

133
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,353
- Who are you?
- Oh, I'm transferring today.

134
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,813

Your parents are transferring
a senior kid,

00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:40,528
and they didn't come with you?

138
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,867
Go to Class Two.

139
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,911
- Oh, and…
- Yes?

140
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:52,498
Starting tomorrow,
can you get your school uniform sorted?

141
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:55,793
Yes.

142
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,675
Excuse me, where are
the senior year classrooms?

143
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:24,196
<i>As the parched land</i>

144
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:28,367
<i>Is blessed with rain</i>

145
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:33,330
<i>Those who thirst for knowledge</i>

146
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:37,001
<i>Come over</i>

147
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:41,213
<i>Here we are…</i>

148
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,256
Little girl.

149
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:44,675
Buy a flower.

150
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:46,760
I'm sorry.

151
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:54,852
Please buy a flower.

152
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:00,733
Listen up.

153
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:02,943
The orientation will begin soon.

154
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:06,196
Come on. Get the peddlers out of here.

155
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,865
Yes, ma'am. Lady.

156
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,326
You can't sell flowers here.

157
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,411
- You need to leave.
- I won't leave.

158
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:13,495
I can't leave.

159
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,414
I won't go until I sell everything.

160
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:16,790
You need to get up.

161
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:19,126
- You can't do this here.
- I'm not going anywhere.

162
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,252
- I won't--
- I'll buy them.

163
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,348
Granny.

164
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,309
I'll buy all the flowers.
How much are they?

165
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:37,770
It's 10,000 won per flower, so…

166
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,897
- Here you go.
- What?

167
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,234
Come on, now.

168
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,402
Let's get you going.

169
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:46,612
- Thank you.
- Come along.

170
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,697
Come with me now. Let's go.

171
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,905
Before we carry on
with the entrance ceremony,

172
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,199
we will have a moment of silence.

173
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:17,161
Mr. Woo Do-hyeok,

174
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,956
who taught us here at Chaehwa
over the past four years,

175
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:26,211
has recently and unfortunately
passed away.

176
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:31,842
We'll remember him for a long time
as a great teacher

177
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,637
and an upright educator.

178
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:39,850
The family of the deceased stated

179
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:43,520
Mr. Woo wouldn't have wanted
to interrupt his students' studies,

180
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:46,273
so we'll just hold
a short moment of silence.

181
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,025
Everyone,

182
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:49,610
bow in silence.

183
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:03,749
Now,

184
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:08,837
let us begin our 2024 orientation
of Chaehwa Girls' High School.

185
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,384
Get out if you don't go here.

186
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,768
Let's begin.

187
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,524
After exploring our history,

188
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,276
<i>shall we proceed to a campus tour?</i>

189
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:41,245
<i>One of our campus highlights</i>
<i>is the outdoor amphitheater.</i>

190
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:51,004
You can join
over 40 diverse student clubs,

191
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,631
<i>including the medical club.</i>

192
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:55,384
Right here.

193
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,773
MEDICAL SUPPLY TRANSPORT

194
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,692
Through academic excellence

195
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,903
and a little bit of friendly rivalry,

196
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,781
twenty-eight percent of our students

197
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,701
are admitted to medical schools
every year.

198
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:25,330
<i>Furthermore, we have consecutively swept</i>

199
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:29,251
<i>both national and international</i>
<i>academic competitions.</i>

200
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:35,048
<i>Every single one of you</i>
<i>should be proud to be here.</i>

201
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,428
<i>I sincerely look forward</i>
<i>to your bright future</i>

202
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:43,765
at our prestigious
Chaehwa Girls' High School.

203
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:45,434
Thank you.

204
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:15,255
<i>Next, we'll hand out</i>
<i>the scholarship certificates.</i>

205
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,798
<i>Han Jeong-won.</i>

206
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,300
Where were you all this while?

207
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,219
<i>…with good grades, as a prime example…</i>

208
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:22,054
Take an empty seat.

209
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:26,975
<i>March 4th, 2024,</i>
<i>President of the PTA, Yu Tae-jun.</i>

210
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:28,560
<i>Congratulations.</i>

211
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:33,023
<i>Next, Kim Yeon-su.</i>

212
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:36,109
<i>Kim Yeon-su placed first,</i>
<i>so alongside the scholarship certificate,</i>

213
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,570
<i>she'll receive an extra three million won.</i>

214
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:39,529
<i>Congratulations.</i>

215
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,198
CHAEHWA GIRLS' HIGH SCHOLARSHIP,
THREE MILLION WON

216
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:42,324
<i>Here.</i>

217
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,577
<i>A round of applause, please.</i>

Hand in this semester's plans

and your school grade goals…

226
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:27,619
How many of you can get
into Hankuk Medical School?

227
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,124
- Any questions?
- Ms. Kim.

228
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,876
Which class is Yu Je-i in?

229
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,753
Why do you want to know?

230
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:37,963
But we do.

231
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:41,425
- We want to know. Tell us.
- We want to know. Tell us.

232
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,560
Yu Je-i.
You know I expect a lot from you, right?

233
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,729
I'll do my best.

234
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,275
The CSAT is 255 days away.

235
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:00,402
That's all.

236
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,318
HANKUK UNIVERSITY

237
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:50,327
Can I have it back?

238
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,886
Je-i, this is your seat.

239
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,138
I saved it for you.

240
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:43,505
- Nice to meet you. My name is--
- I know. It's Yu Je-i.

241
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,966
I heard it earlier.

242
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:03,024
Thanks to the equipment
you donate each year,

243
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:07,487
the medical club is our pride and joy.

244
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:10,157
I remember when it was first created.

245
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:14,327
Mr. Woo was so enthusiastic about it.

246
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,415
Shouldn't we have done more
to show our respects?

247
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:20,625
I feel guilty.

248
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,420
CSAT question-setters

249
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:26,256
can't even tell their families about it.

250
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:28,884
We were instructed
to strictly maintain secrecy,

251
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:32,304
so not even our teachers or staff
could attend the funeral.

252
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:34,639
Don't mind it too much.

253
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,183
DONATED BY J MEDICAL CENTER
YU TAE-JUN

254
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,934
Shall we have tea in my office?

255
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:40,478
Okay, then.

256
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:53,950
Hey, Transfer.

257
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,327
We need to swap seats.

258
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,454
Swap with me, not her. Please.

259
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:00,582
Aren't you guys being too shameless?

260
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:02,876
How can you ask
to sit next to Je-i for free?

261
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:05,670
Transfer, swap with me, not them.

262
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:08,673
If you do, I'll buy you
one thing that you want.

263
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:11,092
No limit on price. How's that?

264
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,595
Kim Na-ri, you're trying
to pay your way out again.

265
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,222
That puts us at a disadvantage.

266
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:16,765
Let's be fair
and play rock-paper-scissors.

267
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:18,808
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

268
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:20,977
Shoot.

269
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:22,103
- Shoot.
- Wait.

270
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,147
I don't want anything.

271
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,276
Na-ri.

272
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,070
Where do you sit now?

273
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:32,864
Me? In the center line,
second from the front.

274
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:36,576
It's right in front of the teacher's desk,
so you can hear them darn well.

275
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,328
And you get the full view
of the blackboard.

276
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:40,455
Okay, I'll swap with you.

277
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:41,706
Fuck yes.

278
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,707
Are you serious?

279
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,042
You study hard, Transfer?

280
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,044
Damn it. How disappointing.

281
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:49,714
Can I go now?

282
00:25:57,847 --> 00:26:01,017
Tell me soon if you want anything.
Don't change your mind later.

283
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,771
Well, you must be loaded.

284
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,732
Can you buy me a building?

285
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,276
What?

286
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:14,990
Forget it. If you have money to waste,
buy more makeup.

287
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:21,997
I looked for you everywhere.

288
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,164
Let's go eat.

289
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,713
Quickly. I'm hungry.

290
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:14,025
