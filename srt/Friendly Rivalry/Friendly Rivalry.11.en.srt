00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,345
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:13,930
NO CHILDREN OR ANIMALS WERE HARMED
IN THE MAKING OF THIS DRAMA

3
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:30,447
<i>Tae-jun couldn't figure out why she cried.</i>

4
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:36,536
<i>He thought it'd be nice</i>
<i>to have an X-ray machine</i>

5
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:38,329
<i>that showed people's minds, but…</i>

6
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,915
Tae-jun? Where is he now?

7
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:43,752
<i>But there was no such thing in this world.</i>

8
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:31,257
Tae-jun.

9
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:09,462
Amen.

10
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:11,422
Scalpel.

11
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,216
<i>He was in despair for a long time</i>

12
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:16,302
<i>because he still couldn't read</i>
<i>the person's mind</i>

13
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,680
<i>even when he cut open their belly</i>
<i>and removed the flesh.</i>

14
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,934
<i>He felt like he was the only one</i>
<i>who felt this way in the whole world.</i>

15
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:27,856
<i>But then, whether it was</i>
<i>a blessing or a curse,</i>

16
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,357
<i>his daughter was born.</i>

17
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,278
<i>And she did exactly the same as he did.</i>

18
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:37,949
<i>As he watched her,</i>
<i>he found some sort of assurance</i>

19
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:41,661
<i>that God would have never made</i>
<i>the same mistake twice,</i>

20
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:45,748
<i>and that the two had been chosen by God.</i>

21
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,343
Je-i.

22
00:02:58,928 --> 00:02:59,929
What a relief.

23
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,516
<i>Storage lockers, exit four.</i>
<i>How far out are you?</i>

24
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,767
- Almost there.
- Let's get out.

25
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:21,200
So, all of this was set up by A-ra?

26
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:26,122
Did the man who came to school
tell you to do this?

27
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:29,250
Who is he anyway?

28
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:33,296
The first guy to give me drugs.

29
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:35,590
He's an asshole.

30
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:41,387
Still, my grades went up,
and I got treated properly.

31
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,598
I'm thankful for him in a way.

32
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,076
<i>The person you are trying to reach</i>
<i>is unavailable.</i>

33
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,119
<i>The call will be directed to voicemail.</i>

34
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,120
YU JE-NA

35
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,915
It means that Je-na came all the way here.

36
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,458
JE-NA'S DEVICE

37
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,168
But the drugs are missing.

38
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,462
What if the police arrested her?

39
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,131
That's why I called her.

40
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:18,132
What?

41
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,315
Are there any places she might be at?

42
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,569
Maybe it's her favorite place
or a close friend's house.

43
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,071
I'm not sure.

44
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:42,407
I don't know anything about her.

45
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:47,203
But you know
that her favorite singer is Lucid Fall.

46
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,122
You're right.

47
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:50,915
Don't worry too much.

48
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,625
It's not like she's dead or anything.

49
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:57,422
Just in case,
let's try calling her once more.

50
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,971
YU JE-NA

51
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:08,975
JE-NA'S LOCATION: 218 SEOLLEUNG-RO

52
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,148
JE-NA'S LOCATION: 218 SEOLLEUNG-RO

53
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,317
Isn't that where your house is?

54
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,110
Yes.

55
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:29,370
<i>In the past few years, the number</i>
<i>of teenage patients increased sharply.</i>

56
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,789
<i>Because they do nothing but sit and study,</i>

57
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:35,418
<i>they suffer from digestive ailments</i>

58
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:38,337
<i>such as indigestion,</i>
<i>constipation, and acid reflux.</i>

59
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:42,425
<i>You're the father of two children</i>
<i>studying for the CSAT.</i>

60
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,136
<i>Yes, as a father of two girls</i>
<i>and a doctor…</i>

61
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,143
YU JE-NA

62
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:40,233
Je-i.

63
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,620
You should have called me
if you didn't have an umbrella.

64
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:55,540
Your mock exam is coming soon.
What if you catch a cold?

65
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,129
Fortunately, you don't have a fever.

66
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:04,715
But just in case, take a warm shower

67
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,467
and come to the hospital for an IV drip.

68
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:08,302
Okay.

69
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:13,766
Dad.

70
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:22,650
I wanted to say goodnight.

71
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,026
Sure.

72
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,320
You should also sleep early tonight.

73
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:49,802
<i>Mr. Woo's phone is gone.</i>

74
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,554
MISSED CALL FROM LOSER THUG

DRUG AWARENESS AND ADDICTION PREVENTION

76
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,795
<i>You had a headache,</i>
<i>but you took digestive medicine?</i>

77
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,130
<i>You have indigestion, and…</i>

78
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,715
Fuck.

79
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,801
It's like they don't want us
to go to college.

80
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,177
It's fucking annoying.

81
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,637
Tell me about it.

82
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,058
Is the top student's locker
sacred or something?

83
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,434
Why don't they go through hers?

84
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:21,686
Hey.

85
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,563
Shut your mouth and go to sleep.

86
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:28,568
NEW POST ON ANONYMOUS MESSAGES

<i>Hey, Na-ri.</i>

89
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,206
<i>Your uniform will get dirty.</i>

90
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,958
NEVER SPOIL YOUR KIDS
THEY CAN'T STUDY WITHOUT DRUGS

91
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,334
AND SHE'LL STILL GO TO HANKUK UNIVERSITY

92
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,380
That's Je-i, right?

93
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,424
THERE'S NO WAY THAT'S JE-I
DID NA-RI TRANSFER AFTER THIS?

00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:52,800
PARENTS' WEALTH AND POWER EQUAL GRADES

00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:53,884
SHE RANKED FIRST BY USING DRUGS?

EVEN TEACHERS CAN'T MESS WITH HER

97
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,638
HER DAD IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE PTA,
AND SHE'S THE TOP STUDENT

98
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,157
Everyone, please take a look
at this video.

99
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:18,868
Yesterday, at Gangnam Station,

100
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,162
we got a tip
that there would be a drug deal.

101
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:23,956
This is the security footage

102
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,460
of the people who used the lockers
at the reported time.

103
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,714
Now, if you recognize
the person in the video

104
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:35,009
or have heard or seen anything
regarding illegal drug deals,

105
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:36,344
please report to the police.

106
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:39,013
Of course, we'll provide full anonymity.

107
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,683
Mr. Lee, what do you think you're doing?

108
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,102
Madam Principal.

109
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,647
- The detectives barged in--
- Get back to your classes.

110
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,148
Please remain in your seats.

111
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:50,107
Now!

112
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,444
What's going on?

113
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:00,826
You've already conducted
individual interviews.

114
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:05,039
Don't you think it's a little much
to show up here unannounced?

115
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,750
They're high school seniors.

116
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:12,088
Yesterday's tip call
came from the teachers' office.

117
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:13,756
Did you know that?

118
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,216
- What?
- There's no way.

119
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:16,967
I know.

120
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:20,721
I know who it was.

121
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:28,854
Je-i.

122
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,816
The person in the security footage
is Yu Je-na.

123
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,405
The daughter of Yu Tae-jun,
J Medical Center's director.

124
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,158
It was her sister?

125
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,912
Are you claiming
that the director's daughter sold drugs?

126
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,081
And how would you know that?

127
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:49,625
She's my older sister.

128
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,547
I saw her steal drugs
from Dad's hospital several times.

129
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:56,841
I should have stopped her then.

130
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:02,304
I assume that Beom-su also bought drugs
from my sister at school.

131
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,098
She was here during the festival.

132
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,643
Then, why did Beom-su say
that she bought them from Seul-gi?

133
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,438
That's obviously because…

134
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,864
Seul-gi is the top student.

135
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:25,202
Everybody hates the top student.

136
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,086
That's nuts.

137
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,839
Beom-su wasn't saying nonsense.

138
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,007
What do you mean?

139
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,135
Hey, Ju Ye-ri.

140
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:45,431
Where's your sister now?

141
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,933
I don't know.

142
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:51,812
She disappeared after she failed the CSAT.

143
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:57,234
Please find my sister, Detective.

144
00:12:58,819 --> 00:12:59,945
Accusing her own sister?

145
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:03,449
- Wait up, Je-i.
- I bet she's also out of her mind.

146
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:07,286
Why did you do that? You didn't have to.

147
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:11,457
It's better to have the police find her
before my dad does.

148
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,918
But is it true

149
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:17,087
that you saw your sister at the festival?

150
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,301
We need to hurry.

151
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:23,385
What's your plan?

152
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,304
I need to find proof that Je-na was here.

153
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:34,730
Director Yu Tae-jun?

154
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:38,234
Sergeant Park Min Gyu
of the Women and Juvenile Affairs.

155
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,610
How can I help you?

156
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:42,905
We're looking for your daughter,
Yu Je-na, for suspected drug trafficking.

157
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,782
We'd appreciate your cooperation.

158
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,456
What?

159
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,457
What now?

160
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:02,216
I'm surprised that you're dressed
like a total criminal.

161
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,510
I don't have a choice.
They leaked my private info.

162
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:06,387
Poor Beom-su.

163
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,765
I feel bad for you.

164
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:11,684
Give me what you promised.

165
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,352
Hey.

166
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:15,980
I wrote a plea letter
and brought it to you herself.

167
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,065
You're awfully proud for a perpetrator.

168
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:20,860
But you promised you'd write it.

169
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,237
Before I give this to you,

170
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,488
let me ask you one thing.

171
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,200
You lied about buying drugs from Seul-gi?

172
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,621
Whose idea was that?

173
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:41,922
Do you want me to guess?

174
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:56,604
I found her.

175
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:08,866
Hold on.

176
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:15,623
Isn't that Gyung?

177
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,713
What were they talking about?

178
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,425
Why is Je-na talking to Gyung?

179
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,600
METROCAN

180
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,226
It's about time she got out.

181
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,771
Do you keep track of Gyung's schedule?

182
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:41,815
They're coming out.

183
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,945
Hey, Gyung.

184
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:47,696
Where are you?

185
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,282
<i>I'm having dinner with my mom.</i>

186
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,450
<i>We'll talk later.</i>

187
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,537
What did she say?

188
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,415
I guess she wasn't in class.

189
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,422
It looks like she's lying to us.

190
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,883
Shit.

191
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,634
<i>You can take the 300 bus from here.</i>

192
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:54,638
Wait, that's the opposite direction
from her place.

193
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,476
Let's part ways now for today.

194
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:04,023
It's too late, and it seems
that Gyung has other things to do.

195
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,233
I see. Okay.

196
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:29,631
Why are you in front of my house?

197
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:30,799
What?

198
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,387
Is this where you live?

199
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:36,972
I didn't know.

200
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,016
Then, what were you doing
in this neighborhood?

201
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,269
That's none of your business.

202
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:43,812
Move.

203
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,275
I got it every year.

204
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,526
KARMA

205
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,944
THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A SECRET

206
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,113
DO YOU KNOW WHY YOUR HUSBAND DIED?

207
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:07,920
What do you want to tell me?

208
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:11,757
As you heard earlier,
Je-na has gone missing.

209
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:18,555
What's with that reaction?
Did you know already?

210
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,850
We saw you talking to Je-na

211
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,811
during the festival
in the security footage.

212
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:26,814
You should have told me
if you knew that she was missing!

213
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:29,191
Do I owe you a report on everything I do?

214
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,820
Also, you bailed that day,
using Seul-gi as your excuse,

215
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,446
while we were locked up at school.

216
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,323
- Hey!
- Calm down, Je-i.

217
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,408
Gyung,

218
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:41,703
can you tell us
what you two talked about that day?

219
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:51,839
Je-na?

220
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:58,345
Did something happen to you?

221
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:02,891
What brings you here?

222
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,060
Are you here for Je-i?

223
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,020
No.

224
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,108
Then, why are you here?

225
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:20,659
Do you know who Woo Seul-gi is?

226
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,583
What about her?

227
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,711
- Where is she now?
- Je-na.

228
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,504
You know who her dad is, don't you?

229
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,855
I saw how much her style has changed.

230
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,190
I was just surprised.

231
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,816
All I did was say hi to her.

232
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:57,696
You expect us to believe that
after you kept that away from us?

233
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:01,867
She asked me not to tell Je-i
about seeing her.

234
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:05,412
- Why would she do that?
- Since when do you care about her?

235
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,123
You never got along with her anyway.

236
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,293
- Gyung.
- I've known Je-i for six years,

237
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:14,922
but I never heard her talk
about her sister once.

238
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:17,591
Now that you're accused of selling drugs,

239
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:19,551
you want to frame your sister?

240
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,386
If I were Je-na,

241
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,305
I would have also cut ties with you.

242
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,431
You never think of others.

243
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:28,352
You don't actually care
how people around you feel,

244
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:29,853
do you?

245
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:31,730
Woo Seul-gi.

246
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,857
We're nothing but sidekicks to her.

247
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:42,616
NO CALLER ID

248
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:43,533
Who's this?

249
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:45,911
Hello?

250
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:47,454
Yes, this is Yu Je-i.

251
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,005
You can speak.

252
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,215
<i>Looking for your sister?</i>

253
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,634
<i>I know where Yu Je-na is.</i>

254
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,636
Who is this?

255
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:03,971
<i>That's not what matters.</i>

256
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:06,390
<i>You're supposed to ask if she's safe.</i>

257
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,353
CLUB H, 588-4 GANGNAM-DAERO,
GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL

258
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:17,651
<i>Bring 30 pills of Consotine until 1 a.m.,</i>
<i>and I'll tell you where she is.</i>

259
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,321
Je-i!

260
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,199
Jeez.

261
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,750
CONSOTINE

262
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,923
I told you to go home.

263
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,842
You can't go there by yourself.

264
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,302
It's not safe.

265
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,470
He must have called
because he had information.

266
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,264
- So, let me come with you.
- No.

267
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:48,598
He told me to come alone.

268
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,309
But it's too dangerous.

269
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,226
I'll come.

270
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:55,188
I'm also responsible
for your sister going missing.

271
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:56,273
Guys.

272
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,318
You're going to a club looking like that?

273
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,749
All your dresses are a bit loose on me.

274
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:15,834
Do you have anything slimmer?

275
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,801
Hey, is it your first time wearing makeup?

276
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:31,850
Squint your eyes like this.

277
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,311
I'm telling you to look down.

278
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:37,355
You look like you've never been to a club.

279
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:40,525
- Here, Gyung.
- Just a second.

280
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,360
Look down.

281
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:51,870
You're obviously a high schooler.

282
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:52,996
No, I'm not.

283
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,623
Don't lie to me.

284
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:57,667
Honey, look.

285
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,505
It's the glasses.

286
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:45,257
It seems a bit off, though.

287
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,260
How come he told you
to put the money in the women's bathroom?

288
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:49,594
He might have an accomplice.

289
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:52,389
He might take the money and run.
We have to catch him.

290
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,360
I'll have a beer.

291
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,037
- Where's the opener?
- Twist it.

292
00:24:58,121 --> 00:24:59,039
I see the suspect.

293
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:23,688
I'm following him.

294
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,315
I need backup by the bathroom.

295
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,459
One beer.

296
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:47,420
Are you here alone? How old are you?

297
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:49,673
I lost him. He's upstairs.

298
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:51,508
What is he wearing?

299
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:52,592
A hoodie and a cap.

300
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:10,318
I found him.

301
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:04,456
Je-i.

302
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:25,954
