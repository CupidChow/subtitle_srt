1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,860
In the last episode

2
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,620
First episode

3
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,120
JYR

4
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,820
If the kids fall off the cliff,

5
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:34,820
hold them tight.

6
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:41,820
Kids run after the meal without thinking.

7
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:55,820
Then, I'll show up somewhere and hold them so that they don't fall off.

8
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:02,220
Work worked by hand, spirit tried to decide who would automatically aunts are..

9
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:08,220
They worked with spirit everyday..

10
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:17,220
but spent only surrond of that point..

11
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,220
It's too late now

12
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,220
I didn't want to hear it

13
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,220
I covered it with my hands

14
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:01,220
I thought I'd miss you

15
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:11,220
Don't cry anymore

16
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:17,220
Just hide

17
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,220
Hide

18
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,220
Don't come back

19
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,220
Please

20
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,220
You're crazy

21
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,220
You're crazy

22
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,220
You have to understand me

23
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:16,220
I'm sorry

24
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:37,220
Why don't you think you slept well?

25
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:41,220
I told you we had the same dream

26
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:47,220
You still don't want to tell me what dream it is?

27
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,220
Dreams are just dreams

28
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:05,220
Do you take sleeping pills?

29
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,220
Yes

30
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,220
I don't think so

31
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:19,220
I'll tell your mother

32
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,220
Teacher

33
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,220
Yes

34
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,220
I think the consultation is over

35
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,220
I'm sorry

36
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,220
Are you okay?

37
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,220
What's going on?

38
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,220
Hey, Yoon Si-hoon

39
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,220
Hey, let me go

40
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,220
What?

41
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,220
I heard you killed a girl last year

42
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,220
That guy was scared and got on the bus

43
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,220
Wow, he's a psychopath

44
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,220
Hey, hey, hey

45
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,220
Yoon Si-hoon

46
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,220
Hey, you

47
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,220
I'm going to kill you

48
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,220
I need a cigarette

49
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,220
You're so scary

50
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,220
Hey

51
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:39,220
What the fxxk

52
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,220
I'm sorry

53
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:48,220
I was so out of my mind that I made a mistake

54
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,220
Are you going to deliver?

55
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,220
Hey, I'm busy

56
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,220
Seo Ju-tae

57
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,220
Yes

58
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,220
I want strawberry milk

59
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,220
What?

60
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,220
Hey, you

61
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:49,220
I told you to change it from last week

62
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,220
Yes

63
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,220
Strawberry

64
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,220
Strawberry milk

65
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,220
Here it is

66
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,220
What's with the face?

67
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,220
Is it hard?

68
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:15,220
I'm sorry, I was confused for a moment

69
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:18,220
Let's move on this time

70
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,220
Come here

71
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,220
I'm sorry, I'll be more careful next time

72
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,220
Okay

73
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,220
Bring your handphone later

74
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,220
Hi-phone

75
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,220
Hi-phone

76
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,220
Get lost

77
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,220
Go, Song Hae-pyeong

78
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,220
Yoon Si-hoon

79
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,220
Yoon Si-hoon

80
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,220
Yoon Si-hoon

81
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,220
Yoon Si-hoon

82
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,220
Well

83
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,220
What's the phone model?

84
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,220
What?

85
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,220
Well

86
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:04,220
I was wondering if you could tell me what the model is

87
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,220
Why?

88
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,220
I'm just curious

89
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,220
What?

90
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,220
Is this it?

91
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:33,220
Why does the volume keep shrinking?

92
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,220
Oh, shit

93
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,220
Guys

94
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:48,220
I think you're mistaken

95
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,220
Guys, this is our business

96
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,220
Business

97
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,220
You have to do this

98
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:01,220
So that I can protect you from this bank

99
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,220
But

100
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,220
If the performance keeps falling

101
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:10,220
I have no reason to take care of you

102
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:15,220
Team leader, let's take a look at the stock

103
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:20,220
If you didn't take off even a single piece, you're dead today

104
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:25,220
5, 4, 3, 2

105
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:32,220
Team leader, this is very meaningful

106
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,220
If you look here

107
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:40,220
No.4, Yoon Si-hoon, don't touch it

108
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,220
Why?

109
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:47,220
It's not different

110
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,220
When he called

111
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,220
I was with you

112
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,220
And the teacher came in

113
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,220
So I was suspicious

114
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:01,220
I told you not to touch other people

115
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,220
Tell me quickly

116
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:07,220
I'm afraid you haven't taken any other measures yet

117
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:10,220
So I'm thinking alone

118
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,220
I'm afraid you'll have a problem

119
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,220
Problem?

120
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,220
What the hell is a problem?

121
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,220
Problem?

122
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:20,220
He's pressing the button

123
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,220
What problem?

124
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,220
No, it's not that

125
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:28,220
So that problem

126
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:31,220
I think I'm going to get hit by that guy

127
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,220
I'm not trying to say that

128
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,220
You're not wrong

129
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,220
You're even putting up a guard

130
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,220
You're cool

131
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,220
Keep going

132
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,220
Attention

133
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,220
You must have been thinking about that inside

134
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,220
I think I'm going to lose

135
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,220
You bastard

136
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,220
Get up

137
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,220
Get up

138
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:08,220
This kid is a loser

139
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,220
You should dress up

140
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,220
Who did that?

141
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,220
Get up

142
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,220
Oh, shit

143
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,220
Team leader

144
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:33,220
I'll know that you're bringing that bastard's phone inside today

145
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,220
Yes

146
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,220
Thank you

147
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,220
Teacher, that phone

148
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:52,220
Yeah, take it because it's not clean

149
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,220
Yes, sir

150
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,220
Yeah, go in

151
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,220
I can't help it

152
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,220
I can't help it

153
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,220
Team leader

154
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,220
Take the phone

155
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,220
There's no end to today

156
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,220
Hey

157
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,220
Huh?

158
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,220
You didn't see my phone?

159
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,220
You don't have your phone there?

160
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,220
I don't have it

161
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,220
Oh, yeah

162
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,220
Yeah, yeah

163
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,220
This is weird

164
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,220
No

165
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,220
What

166
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,220
This

167
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,220
It can't be

168
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,220
It's really weird

169
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,220
What's wrong with this?

170
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,220
What's wrong with this?

171
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,220
There's no end to it

172
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,220
Oh

173
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,220
Oh, my

174
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:34,220
I just brought this from the classroom

175
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,220
I'm not giving it to you

176
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,220
I saw it

177
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,220
They just took it

178
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,220
I touched their phones or touched them

179
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,220
I watched them or stole them

180
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,220
It's ridiculous

181
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,220
I'm not that kind of person

182
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,220
You know what I mean, right?

183
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,220
I don't know what you mean

184
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,220
Anyway, I really don't know

185
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,220
Okay?

186
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,220
This

187
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,220
Yeon Si-an's phone

188
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,220
Team leader Seo

189
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,220
I know

190
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,220
Why are you scolding me?

191
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,220
It's good to do it in advance

192
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,220
Go home

193
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,220
I'll give you when you're done

194
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,220
Bye, Team leader

195
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,220
Bye

196
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,220
Bye

197
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,220
Bye

198
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,220
I love you, Team leader

199
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,220
I love you, Team leader

200
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,220
Yeon Si-an, did you find your phone?

201
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,220
I found it

202
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,220
You know

203
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,220
You know

204
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,220
You know the phone

205
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,220
I thought about it

206
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:15,220
I'm sorry

207
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,220
Because

208
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:19,220
Because I'm responsible for not managing it

209
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,220
So

210
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,220
If you buy a new phone

211
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,220
I'll support you

212
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,220
Hey, at times like this

213
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,220
You have to get over it with a positive mind

214
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,220
Because

215
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,220
There are so many things that can't be helped in life

216
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,220
What can't be helped?

217
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:41,220
Do you think I don't know anything?

218
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:46,220
I'm doing this to make you feel comfortable

219
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,220
Is that really cowardly?

220
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,220
This is a pen

221
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,220
But you

222
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:09,220
You didn't lose it on purpose because you wanted to change your phone, right?

223
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,220
But it's still nice

224
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,220
You're going on a date with my son

225
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,220
Yeah

226
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,220
If you go to study abroad next semester

227
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,220
You'll be able to see the world

228
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,220
You'll be able to see the world

229
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,220
You'll be able to see the world

230
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,220
Yeah

231
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,220
If you go to study abroad next semester

232
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,220
We won't have time to date like this

233
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,220
Right?

234
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,220
It might be a little hard at first

235
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,220
But it'll be okay soon

236
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,220
I can't sleep

237
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,220
I can't sleep

238
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,220
I can't sleep

239
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,220
Suho

240
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,220
I'm tired

241
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,220
I can't sleep like this

242
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,220
When can you wake up?

243
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,220
A few days ago

244
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:32,220
I told my classmate that I was cowardly

245
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,220
But

246
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:39,220
I think I'm really cowardly

247
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,220
I hope

248
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,220
Everyone

249
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,220
Will leave me alone

250
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,220
Like

251
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,220
A person

252
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,220
Who's not here

253
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,220
Good job

254
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,220
You're a really cute person

255
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,220
Hug me like this

256
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:15,220
Should I introduce you to Juntae?

257
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,220
What should I do?

258
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,220
Yeah, let's go drink and do it together

259
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,220
Good

260
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,220
Juntae is a big guy

261
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,220
Really?

262
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,220
Is Juntae a big guy?

263
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,220
No

264
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,220
Should I touch him?

265
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,220
Come here

266
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,220
Hey, you

267
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,220
Don't do it

268
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,220
You guys

269
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,220
Don't do it

270
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,220
You guys

271
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,220
Don't do it

272
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,220
Hey, you

273
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,220
Attention

274
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,220
Attention

275
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,220
Don't do it

276
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,220
Attention

277
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,220
He's watching it well

278
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,220
Stop it

279
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,220
What are you doing?

280
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,220
You're so mean

281
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,220
Juntae

282
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,220
What are you doing?

283
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,220
Juntae

284
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,220
Wait, wait, wait

285
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,220
Wait

286
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,220
My body

287
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,220
Hey

288
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,220
Hey

289
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,220
Hey!

290
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,720
What are you doing standing there?

291
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,220
You're scaring me.

292
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,720
You said you lost your phone.

293
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,720
Our school loses that a lot these days.

294
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,720
You should take good care of it, right, Juntae?

295
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,720
I have a lot left. Do you want one?

296
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,720
Say, please give me one.

297
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,720
Move. Don't get in the way.

298
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,720
I don't want to.

299
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,220
He's going to look me in the eye.

300
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,220
Go away. Move.

301
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:34,220
Look at his eyes.

302
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,220
Are you going to leave him alone?

303
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:39,220
Leave him alone. He's a loser.

304
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,720
I'm sorry.

305
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,720
I didn't mean to wake you up.

306
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,720
I'm sorry.

307
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:13,220
I thought you were sleeping without lunch.

308
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,220
I don't need it. Take it.

309
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,220
I just...

310
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:29,220
I'm sorry. I stole your phone and gave it to Choi Youngman.

311
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,220
I'm sorry.

312
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:36,220
I couldn't help it.

313
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,720
Yeon Shin.

314
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:58,220
You said you were cowardly last time.

315
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:01,220
I've been thinking a lot lately.

316
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:08,220
I don't know what to do when I think about it.

317
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,220
So?

318
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,220
Can't you tell me?

319
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:25,220
What if I'm not cowardly?

320
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,220
What should I do?

321
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,220
Why should I?

322
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:40,220
I don't think anyone else will ask.

323
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,220
Please.

324
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,220
Do you know the Newton's Law?

325
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:58,220
If there's no effect, there's no side effect.

326
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,220
I'm sorry.

327
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,220
Cheers!

328
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,220
Cheers!

329
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:59,220
But Seo Juntae didn't answer the phone.

330
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,220
I think he said he quit.

331
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,220
I don't know.

332
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:06,220
Who's going to pay if Juntae doesn't answer the phone?

333
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:08,220
The guys.

334
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,220
What?

335
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,220
What?

336
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:17,220
That's awesome.

337
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,220
I have to go out for a while.

338
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,220
I'll play with you.

339
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,220
I'm going.

340
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,220
Where are you going?

341
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,220
Business.

342
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,220
Come on.

343
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,220
I'll be handsome.

344
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,220
Where are you going?

345
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,220
We're going to the club.

346
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:38,220
If you go to the club, you can make a lot of money.

347
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,220
I'm going.

348
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,220
I'm so angry.

349
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:50,220
Eunjung, listen to me.

350
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,220
Get out of here.

351
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,220
You idiot.

352
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,220
It's so much fun.

353
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,220
Hey.

354
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,220
Do you think I'm a jerk?

355
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:06,220
If you think I'm a jerk, come to the club.

356
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:09,220
You guys are still living like this because of Eunjung.

357
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,220
Get a hold of yourself.

358
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,220
If it were me, I would have called you.

359
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:15,220
Hey, relax.

360
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,220
What?

361
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,220
Is Sungjae in there?

362
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,220
What?

363
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,220
I'm Eunjung Choi Yeoman.

364
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,220
I'm supposed to have a meeting with Sungjae today.

365
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,220
Is he in there or not?

366
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,220
Yes, Sungjae is in there.

367
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,220
Thank you.

368
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,220
Hey.

369
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,220
If you have anything to say, say it.

370
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,220
What?

371
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:48,220
Is Eunjung really coming to the club?

372
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:50,220
Isn't Eunjung's head Baku?

373
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,220
What's wrong with you?

374
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,220
I'll bring more water next month.

375
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,220
Get out of here.

376
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,220
It's so much.

377
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,220
Sungjae, I'm Hyoman.

378
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,220
Are you playing a game?

379
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,220
You guys are so annoying.

380
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,220
I'm just trying to get rid of the aggro.

381
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,220
I'm sorry.

382
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:34,220
That's why I don't play with those guys who are getting hit.

383
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,220
Tell me.

384
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,220
You know, the phone.

385
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,220
I think I'll have to collect it by next week.

386
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:49,220
But if I pass it this time, I think I can really raise the profit.

387
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,220
And as I said then,

388
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:55,220
When the change is complete, if you hit it hard,

389
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,220
Next week?

390
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,220
Next week?

391
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:01,220
Yeah, I'll bring 100 of them next week.

392
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:05,220
I've never made this mistake before.

393
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,220
Bring some heavy stuff next week.

394
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,220
Of course.

395
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,220
You know I'm loyal, right?

396
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,220
The bastards are playing with firecrackers.

397
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,220
It's so scary.

398
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:19,220
The little bastards are going to get hit.

399
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,220
MG firecracker.

400
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,220
Is that what it is?

401
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,220
MG.

402
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,220
What the hell.

403
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,220
What the hell.

404
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,220
Shit.

405
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,220
I'm sorry I'm busy.

406
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,220
I'll go.

407
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,220
What's his name?

408
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,220
I'm sorry.

409
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,220
I'm sorry.

410
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,220
I'm sorry.

411
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,220
I'm sorry.

412
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,220
I'm sorry.

413
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,220
I'm sorry.

414
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,220
I'm sorry.

415
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,220
I'm sorry.

416
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,220
I'm sorry.

417
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,220
I'm sorry.

418
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,220
I'm sorry.

419
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,220
I'm sorry.

420
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,220
I'm sorry.

421
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,220
I'm sorry.

422
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,220
I'm sorry.

423
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,220
I'm sorry.

424
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,220
I'm sorry.

425
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,220
I'm sorry.

426
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,220
I'm sorry.

427
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,220
I'm sorry.

428
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,220
I'm sorry.

429
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,220
I'm sorry.

430
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,220
I'm sorry.

431
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,220
I'm sorry.

432
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,220
I'm sorry.

433
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,220
I'm sorry.

434
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,220
I'm sorry.

435
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,220
I'm sorry.

436
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,900
Istember 18, dár deeper

437
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,280
Newton's quotient...

438
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,580
Equals all functions...

439
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,700
Same size...

440
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,740
and a semi-operateanza space.

441
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:20,820
I need to go to SuyoungAPP exclusive meeting.

442
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:21,420
What is this?

443
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,220
She is not here.

444
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,520
I just want her to read your notebook.

445
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,420
Stop being silly, Mr. Lee.

446
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:28,020
If I get knockback this time,

447
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,820
I will show you what I can do.

448
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:43,960
Forget

449
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,960
Ugh

450
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,420
Lim Han-wol

451
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,300
Kwon Ju-ho

452
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,240
Song Ki-won

453
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,840
Baek Seung-woo

454
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,480
Do Jae-kyung

455
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,120
Oh Il-young

456
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,640
Hong Sung-kwan

457
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,920
Seo Jung-ho

458
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,380
Kwak Byung-min

459
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,960
Kim Hoon-young

460
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,560
Kim Jun-soo

461
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,960
Lee Seung-woo

462
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,640
Don't overreact, you idiot

463
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,880
Look at the phone, you said you got it, show me

464
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,640
Look

465
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,800
Is this your phone?

466
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,320
It's my phone, you idiot

467
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,080
What?

468
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,480
Seo Jung-joon is crazy

469
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,360
Why is the 7-8 guy suddenly doing independent sports?

470
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,120
But look, what's important is

471
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,520
that you gave me everything, not just me

472
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,800
I think he's going to transfer

473
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,160
Hey, isn't Choi Eom here yet?

474
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,720
Ah, Choi Eom must be so busy

475
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,520
Seo Jung-tae is dead, really

476
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,800
Who?

477
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,640
Who?

478
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,840
Who are you to tell me to answer?

479
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,040
Seo Jung-tae

480
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,760
saw you this morning

481
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,760
He saw you this morning

482
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,760
He saw you this morning

483
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
He said he saw you this morning

484
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,560
What are you doing, you idiot?

485
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,200
Seo Jung-tae

486
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,760

00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,080
Where is this bastard?

488
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,080
The adult's action follows the adult's reaction

489
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,520
The adult's action follows the adult's reaction

490
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,840
Seo Jung-tae

491
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,840
The adult's action follows the adult's reaction

492
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,040
Come out here

493
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,760
Seo Jung-tae

494
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,760
The adult's action follows the adult's reaction

495
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,760
I'll go

496
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,360

00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,960
Are you serious?

498
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,840
Did you take your phone?

499
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,840
You're cool

500
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,840
You're cool

501
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,840
The guard is so strong

502
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,840
You're cool

503
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,840
Give it to me

504
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,840
Relax

505
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,840
Are you cool, Jung-tae?

506
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,840
Block this

507
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,840
What's wrong with you?

508
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,840
You're not going to do what I tell you, are you?

509
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,840
You're going to go to school because of your sister

510
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,840
I'll kill you, you bastard

511
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,840
You bastard

512
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,840

Are you going to run you in, sézé??

Be careful

528
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,380
What's going on?

529
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,980
It's too loud.

530
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,180
Huh?

531
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:57,060
Don't cross your fingers.
