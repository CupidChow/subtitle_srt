1
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:39,803
Get out.

2
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,062
I was working, man.

3
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,897
My dad didn't let me
answer the phone.

4
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:37,903
That's how he is.

5
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:40,781
Him and his damn rules.

6
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:23,842
They're still only making 2 trays a day.

7
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,053
Why isn't the place open yet?

8
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,472
They're so slow today.

9
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:32,518
It's already 8, Coughing Liu.

10
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,394
I've been trying to buy this for days.

11
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,483
The sun's already out
and about, man.

12
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:42,653
We're coming, we're coming...

13
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:47,407
Finally.

14
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:48,408
Good morning, Mr. Li.

15
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,036
You guys are running late today.

16
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,287
The fire took a little longer today.

17
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:55,999
No need to rush.

18
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:56,750
Hurry up.

19
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:57,543
We've been waiting forever.

20
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:58,544
Look at all these people.

21
00:06:58,585 --> 00:06:59,711
I've been here all morning.

22
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:00,921
Don't stand crowding around.

23
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:01,964
Get in line,

24
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:02,840
or we're not selling.

25
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:04,091
Go on, now.

26
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:06,134
I've been here since dawn.

27
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,304
Every morning at opening,

28
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:11,014
the first person I see is you, Mr. Li.

29
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:12,516
That's right.

30
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:13,767
Alright...

31
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:18,897
You know the drill.

32
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,482
What are they selling here?

33
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:21,900
Look at all these people.

34
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:23,318
This is delicious.

35
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,070
Everyone who visits this town comes here.

36
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:26,363
Just get in line.

37
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:27,823
Those behind the 7th person from the end,

38
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:28,782
we can't serve you.

39
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:29,867
If you really want it,

40
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,743
you'll have to come earlier tomorrow.

41
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:32,452
Those in the back missed out.

42
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:32,953
Here we go, Mr. Li.

43
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:33,745
Don't get too anxious.

44
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:34,538
Here we are.

45
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,542
Li, you old cripple.

46
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:41,503
There you are.

47
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:43,297
My daughter...

48
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,465
The first thing she asked for
after coming home

49
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:47,509
is your Crystal Cake.

50
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:48,760
Great.

51
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:50,888
Don't drop it.

52
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:53,348
Take it easy, Mr. Li.

53
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,855
I don't need change.

54
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:01,607
I want 2 portions.

55
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:04,151
It's one per person.

56
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:06,862
Just sell me one more.

57
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:08,488
I can pay double.

58
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:09,531
I'm afraid not.

59
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:10,616
Sorry,

60
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:12,701
it's my dad's rule.

61
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:14,411
Follow the rules, man.

62
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:18,916
It's just one more.

63
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:20,292
It's no big deal.

64
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,256
That's how it goes.

65
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:37,726
Thank you.

66
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:42,940
What the hell?

67
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:43,607
I've been in this queue forever,

68
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:45,067
and now you run out?

69
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:46,610
What kind of business
are you running here?

70
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:47,611
That's right!

71
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:48,987
I came all the way from Kunming

72
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,113
just to try your cake.

73
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:52,115
Why can't you make more?

74
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:54,993
Our shop's got plenty!

75
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:56,161
Come on.

76
00:08:56,662 --> 00:08:57,454
Listen up.

77
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:59,498
Our shop just opened today.

78
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,791
Fifteen yuan a portion.

79
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,209
Buy one, get one free.

80
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:03,836
Buy as many as you want!

81
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:04,837
We've got plenty!

82
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:05,379
That's right!

83
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:06,630
And the flavor?

84
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:07,631
Exactly the same.

85
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:08,423
Let's go.

86
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:09,132
It's just as good!

87
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:09,842
Let's go.

88
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:10,843
It's your lucky day.

89
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:13,095
Forget them, they're all out.

90
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:21,979
How shameless.

91
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:28,819
Next, an update
on the Beijing Olympics.

92
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:31,488
We're 60 days out
from the Opening Ceremony

93
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:34,575
and 89 days
from the Beijing Paralympics.

94
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:35,742
At 9 this morning,

95
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:39,621
the relay of the torch began
in beautiful Yunnan.

96
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:40,706
Ceremony attendees
observed a minute of silence

97
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:44,418
for victims of the Sichuan earthquake.

98
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,628
The relay's first stop is Kunming,
aka "Spring City."

99
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:52,843
Let's go.

100
00:09:52,885 --> 00:09:53,719
Let's move out!

101
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,513
Out of the way!

102
00:09:59,016 --> 00:09:59,975
Watch out!

103
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:01,518
Out of the way!

104
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:04,605
Out of the way, please!

105
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:08,233
Watch out!

106
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,277
Out of the way!

107
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:13,488
Welcome to our grand opening!

108
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,866
Try it before you buy it!

109
00:10:15,908 --> 00:10:17,117
We've got delicious Crystal Cakes.

110
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,160
Try it.

111
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:19,912
Have a free sample.

112
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:21,371
Welcome!

113
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:23,665
Please have a free sample!

114
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:25,792
Welcome!

115
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:28,086
Please have a free sample!

116
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:29,213
Try it.

117
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:30,255
Welcome!

118
00:10:32,508 --> 00:10:33,550
Have a taste, ma'am.

119
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:35,344
Please have a free sample!

120
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,513
This tastes terrible.

121
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:55,239
My nephew, there you are.

122
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:09,336
Seeing how your
knock-off shop is open,

123
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,756
I, as the 8th generation heir,
should pay a visit.

124
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:16,009
Huang Fei.

125
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:17,135
Come here.

126
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:18,720
Let them have a taste of this.

127
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:20,973
Show them what a real
Crystal Cake tastes like.

128
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:21,849
Here,

129
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:24,977
the real Crystal Cake.

130
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,103
Out of my sight.

131
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:27,938
Come on, have a free sample.

132
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,398
Try it out, everyone.

133
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:31,233
Crystal Cake from Tong Shun Xiang,

134
00:11:31,275 --> 00:11:32,484
the one and only!

135
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:33,277
Come on.

136
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:34,778
Try this out.

137
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:39,783
This one really is better.

138
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:41,618
Good call!

139
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,036
Tong Shun Xiang's taste better,
after all.

140
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:48,041
Every heir
to the Tong Shun Xiang legacy

141
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:51,336
must be able to replicate
the original flavor.

142
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:55,591
You call yourself an heir,

143
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:58,260
but you still don't know
how to make it.

144
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:03,974
The only man who can do it

145
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:06,602
is your father.

146
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:18,989
Let's go.

147
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:23,160
Best of luck to your shop!

148
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:26,496
Happy opening!

149
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,375
Liu Jiansan! Huang Fei!

150
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,878
This isn't over yet!

151
00:14:57,856 --> 00:15:00,150
Those pirates are despicable!

152
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:02,319
When your dad
finally passes you the torch,

153
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:03,612
open a few more branches.

154
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:04,571
Seriously...

155
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:06,156
You can crush those bastards.

156
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:08,617
I wish.

157
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:10,160
The problem is my dad.

158
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:12,162
You know him.

159
00:15:12,496 --> 00:15:14,039
He only sells 2 trays a day.

160
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,792
And he won't give up
that old shop.

161
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:22,506
I'm suffocating
in this dump of a village,

162
00:15:23,257 --> 00:15:25,259
doing dumb-ass things
like this every day.

163
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:28,512
I should go out there
and see the world.

164
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:31,515
Jiansan,

165
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:36,019
let's work in the movies
with my cousin, Hu.

166
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,481
We can see celebrities
in the flesh

167
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:41,149
and make lots of money.

168
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:45,904
Really?

169
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:49,658
As long as we stick together...

170
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:51,994
You see all this?

171
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:54,913
This is our world!

172
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:58,250
Wake up, man.

173
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:00,002
World domination?

174
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,438
Why are you in here?

175
00:16:21,273 --> 00:16:22,858
You didn't close the door.

176
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:25,611
Get out.

177
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:27,112
And close the door.

178
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:29,114
You and your damn rules.

179
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:31,742
What are you burning?

180
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:32,618
What is that smell?

181
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:33,410
Get out.

182
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:34,536
Get out.

183
00:16:36,038 --> 00:16:36,747
What is all this?

184
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:37,789
What are you doing?

185
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:38,999
Stop.

186
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:45,506
Get out.

187
00:16:51,512 --> 00:16:52,346
Dad...

188
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:54,515
I've been at this for years.

189
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:57,726
I haven't slacked once.

190
00:16:58,143 --> 00:16:59,853
I wake up
at the crack of dawn every day.

191
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:00,604
And all I do is knead dough.

192
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:02,523
My hands are swollen from it,

193
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:04,023
and there's even a scar.

194
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:07,528
Yet, I still can't make it
as good as you.

195
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:10,196
Everyone out there mocks me.

196
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:11,906
They ask
how I can call myself an heir

197
00:17:12,241 --> 00:17:13,492
when I'm not qualified.

198
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:15,993
Will you ever
pass the recipe to me?

199
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:18,872
What are you burning anyway?

200
00:17:19,623 --> 00:17:20,374
Get out!

201
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:29,091
I have nothing more
to pass to you.

202
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:35,848
All you do is shut the door on me!

203
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:39,268
"Get out."

204
00:17:39,518 --> 00:17:40,978
Every single day!

205
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,438
We have the real thing,

206
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:45,274
but we just make 2 trays a day.

207
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,025
Look at Liu Tingzhong!

208
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:49,111
He's making crappy knock-offs.

209
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:50,529
and he's making a fortune.

210
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:51,905
What about me?

211
00:17:52,406 --> 00:17:53,657
I'm your son.

212
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:55,993
Why can't you teach me?

213
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:57,995
Let me make
some money of my own!

214
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:17,639
I'm telling you.

215
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:19,641
He's looking down on me

216
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:21,727
because I couldn't get into college.

217
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,812
That's why he's got me trapped here,

218
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:24,855
following his every command.

219
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:28,817
So it's decided.

220
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:30,235
We have to leave this dump.

221
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:32,029
Jiansan,

222
00:18:32,905 --> 00:18:34,156
what's mine...

223
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:35,741
is yours.

224
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:37,618
That's right, brother.

225
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:42,247
It's all ours!

226
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:43,624
Come on.

227
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:47,461
Let's do this.

228
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:48,837
It's been forever!

229
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:49,963
We're a duo.

230
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:52,090
Taking the music world by storm!

231
00:18:54,218 --> 00:18:55,969
"It doesn't matter

232
00:18:58,597 --> 00:19:00,974
who falls in love with the other."

233
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:03,852
"It doesn't matter

234
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:08,732
who wears out the other."

235
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,152
"The happiness we shared

236
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:16,156
was merely a fleeting moment of beauty."

237
00:19:18,617 --> 00:19:20,244
"After the happiness..."

238
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:23,163
That's Zhang Xiaoyue.

239
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:25,123
She lives at the tea farm.

240
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,125
I hear she's pretty arrogant.

241
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:28,877
Not even A Fu stands a chance.

242
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:34,341
"Don't be so sure."

243
00:19:34,383 --> 00:19:35,217
"Right and wrong..."

244
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:36,468
Xiaoyue.

245
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,469
Look.

246
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:39,096
My father went to Beijing on business

247
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:40,264
and brought this back.

248
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:41,557
An Olympic commemorative coin.

249
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:42,474
Is he for real or is he just flirting?

250
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:43,642
This set is special.

251
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:46,061
It's a limited set.

252
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:47,312
Only a few thousand in the whole country.

253
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:48,146
My dad tells me that

254
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:49,398
it'll be worth a fortune.

255
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:53,277
What are you doing?

256
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:56,280
Your pops is looking for you, man.

257
00:19:56,405 --> 00:19:57,531
What for?

258
00:19:57,906 --> 00:19:59,700
How should I know
what the village chief wants?

259
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:01,243
Go on, hurry home.

260
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:03,871
"It doesn't matter..."

261
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,543
Turn around, driver.

262
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:11,086
Xiaoyue,

263
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:13,297
I'll see you around.

264
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:13,964
Move it, man.

265
00:20:14,006 --> 00:20:15,382
Your dad's waiting for you.

266
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:17,342
Turn it around.

267
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:19,386
Come on.

268
00:20:19,845 --> 00:20:20,846
Turn right.

269
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:24,933
"Why make myself

270
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:27,895
go through the pain
again and again."

271
00:20:29,438 --> 00:20:31,523
"It doesn't matter to me..."

272
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:56,381
Who is it?

273
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:00,636
It's me.

274
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:05,766
What are you doing here?

275
00:21:08,644 --> 00:21:09,520
I...

276
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,981
I was going up to your farm

277
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:14,650
to get some firewood.

278
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:17,402
In the middle of the night?

279
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:25,160
Didn't you know?

280
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:27,621
Some firewood,

281
00:21:28,247 --> 00:21:29,540
can only be chopped at night.

282
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:32,292
Who are you fooling?

283
00:21:33,377 --> 00:21:35,003
I know who you are.

284
00:21:35,754 --> 00:21:37,130
You make cake, right?

285
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:42,886
You know a lot about me.

286
00:21:44,263 --> 00:21:45,806
If you like Crystal Cake,

287
00:21:45,848 --> 00:21:46,974
I can make them
for you every day.

288
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:50,519
You make the cakes?

289
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:55,315
Yeah.

290
00:21:57,776 --> 00:21:59,403
I've been eating them all my life.

291
00:22:00,237 --> 00:22:01,738
I'm tired of them already.

292
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:06,034
I can make you other flavors.

293
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:08,120
What can you make?

294
00:22:08,537 --> 00:22:11,498
How about tiramisu,
strawberry pudding,

295
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,875
or chocolate brownie?

296
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,293
What are they?

297
00:22:14,668 --> 00:22:15,252
You...

298
00:22:19,131 --> 00:22:21,091
Oh, that's easy.

299
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:22,885
If you want some, I'll take you.

300
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,597
I can go by myself.

301
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:31,768
I can be your
personal bodyguard, right?

302
00:22:32,603 --> 00:22:34,062
Anyway, how can that junk

303
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:35,939
compare with our Crystal Cake?

304
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:38,400
That junk you just mentioned...

305
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:40,027
that's a cake, too, right?

306
00:22:40,277 --> 00:22:41,028
That's right.

307
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:43,238
I've never heard of it.

308
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,657
Then how can you take me?

309
00:22:45,908 --> 00:22:47,367
I can learn.

310
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:20,526
You go see your uncle Lee's daughter this afternoon.

311
00:23:22,903 --> 00:23:23,529
No.

312
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:24,279
I have no time.

313
00:23:25,656 --> 00:23:26,281
You have to.

314
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:41,004
"The railroad industry is changing rapidly."

315
00:23:41,255 --> 00:23:44,216
"Combustion engines
used to run 40 km per hour."

316
00:23:44,258 --> 00:23:47,135
"After the 6th campaign this year,"

317
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:51,390
"all trains across the nation can now travel...

318
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:53,892
on average of 120 km per hour."

319
00:23:54,393 --> 00:23:57,229
"Travel records have been broken repeatedly,

320
00:23:57,271 --> 00:24:00,732
"changing the travel industry as we know it."

321
00:24:00,774 --> 00:24:01,900
That's right.

322
00:24:05,404 --> 00:24:07,656
Do you think
I'll become a train attendant?

323
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:19,168
If you fail,

324
00:24:20,752 --> 00:24:22,880
then stay
and run the shop with me.

325
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,259
Who'd want to run your shop?

326
00:25:12,387 --> 00:25:13,764
I see you have a girlfriend.

327
00:25:17,643 --> 00:25:19,853
If you're serious about her,

328
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:22,564
then hurry up and marry her.

329
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,485
Ask her family

330
00:25:26,527 --> 00:25:27,986
about what you need to propose.

331
00:25:28,028 --> 00:25:29,279
I'll take care of it.

332
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:31,031
Dad...

333
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:33,200
I'm only 23.

334
00:25:33,242 --> 00:25:34,868
What's the rush?

335
00:25:39,915 --> 00:25:42,125
Once you get married
and have a child,

336
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:44,002
the shop is yours.

337
00:25:49,091 --> 00:25:50,926
I can't even replicate your flavor.

338
00:25:50,968 --> 00:25:53,220
How am I qualified to take over?

339
00:26:09,403 --> 00:26:12,114
"If China Railway is like a vast ocean,"

340
00:26:12,364 --> 00:26:15,200
"I'll immerse into it as a drop of water."

341
00:26:15,242 --> 00:26:18,120
"I'll strive to work for our railway system."

342
00:26:18,287 --> 00:26:19,496
That's wrong.

343
00:26:19,538 --> 00:26:22,249
"You're the ocean, and I'm the drop of water."

344
00:26:22,291 --> 00:26:24,168
"I'll immerse into you."

345
00:26:41,393 --> 00:26:42,936
How romantic.

346
00:26:42,978 --> 00:26:44,313
How suave.

347
00:26:45,564 --> 00:26:47,441
What the hell do you two want?

348
00:26:47,482 --> 00:26:48,734
You looking for trouble?

349
00:26:49,484 --> 00:26:50,360
We need to talk to you.

350
00:26:50,402 --> 00:26:51,987
That's right. We need to talk.

351
00:27:08,253 --> 00:27:09,338
Jiansan's here.

352
00:27:18,889 --> 00:27:20,766
What do you want?
Come on.

353
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:23,227
My dear nephew, I called you over

354
00:27:23,268 --> 00:27:24,603
because I care about you.

355
00:27:24,645 --> 00:27:25,812
That's enough.

356
00:27:25,854 --> 00:27:27,439
Cut the crap.

357
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:29,024
I'm not even your biological nephew.

358
00:27:29,274 --> 00:27:31,276
Don't be so tactless.

359
00:27:32,903 --> 00:27:34,905
We share the same last name.

360
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:41,370
Look, all these years...

361
00:27:41,411 --> 00:27:43,288
we've been making
the same Crystal Cake.

362
00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:46,667
We make it the same way
as your dad,

363
00:27:47,543 --> 00:27:49,378
but why is our flavor so different?

364
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:54,216
Your father has the secret recipe.

365
00:27:56,385 --> 00:27:58,470
No matter how many times we ask,

366
00:27:58,512 --> 00:28:00,097
he won't tell anyone.

367
00:28:00,597 --> 00:28:02,099
He hasn't told you, either, right?

368
00:28:03,392 --> 00:28:05,769
Don't you want to know what it is?

369
00:28:11,525 --> 00:28:12,359
Look, your uncle

370
00:28:12,401 --> 00:28:15,404
knows that you need money.

371
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:17,531
You got yourself a girlfriend, right?

372
00:28:18,782 --> 00:28:19,658
Here.

373
00:28:20,409 --> 00:28:21,285
Take this.

374
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:24,037
Don't be shy. We're family.

375
00:28:29,418 --> 00:28:30,961
We should share

376
00:28:31,003 --> 00:28:33,255
the Tong Shun Xiang recipe,

377
00:28:33,755 --> 00:28:35,215
take it across the country

378
00:28:35,257 --> 00:28:37,384
and open a chain
so we can make a fortune.

379
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:40,137
I'll let you decide,

380
00:28:40,512 --> 00:28:42,264
the size of your share.

381
00:29:16,131 --> 00:29:16,965
You're here.

382
00:29:17,007 --> 00:29:17,966
Come on in.

383
00:29:18,008 --> 00:29:18,884
Come on.

384
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,385
How is it?

385
00:29:22,513 --> 00:29:23,263
Smells great.

386
00:29:26,016 --> 00:29:27,017
Smell this.

387
00:29:33,148 --> 00:29:34,191
Your son

388
00:29:34,233 --> 00:29:36,360
He's looking more
and more like you.

389
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:40,906
Not quite there yet.

390
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,870
Let me know what else you need.

391
00:29:46,912 --> 00:29:49,414
Nothing but the best for you.

392
00:29:50,165 --> 00:29:54,711
(Chinese honey, Linxi marigold,
Uncle Wang)

393
00:30:01,635 --> 00:30:02,386
Get...

394
00:30:55,063 --> 00:31:00,152
(Steam for 20 minutes,
smoke for 5-7 minutes)

395
00:31:26,261 --> 00:31:27,346
This is good.

396
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:41,151
It's still not the same.

397
00:31:43,779 --> 00:31:45,531
They're both good.

398
00:31:46,657 --> 00:31:48,408
You don't have to
make me feel better.

399
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:51,286
I've been watching him
all my life,

400
00:31:52,037 --> 00:31:54,039
but he won't pass me
the entire recipe.

401
00:31:54,873 --> 00:31:56,416
What kind of a dad is he?

402
00:32:01,505 --> 00:32:03,257
At least you have a father.

403
00:32:04,132 --> 00:32:05,926
When I was old enough
to remember anything,

404
00:32:05,968 --> 00:32:07,719
my parents moved to Guangdong

405
00:32:07,761 --> 00:32:09,513
and left me with my uncle and aunt,

406
00:32:10,264 --> 00:32:12,808
promising to get me
when they earned enough.

407
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:14,518
But they never came back.

408
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:18,355
I've been working on the tea farm
since I was 6.

409
00:32:40,169 --> 00:32:41,378
Your hand.

410
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:44,882
It's fine. Just a burn.

411
00:33:23,837 --> 00:33:24,963
Xiaoyue,

412
00:33:25,005 --> 00:33:27,466
something's come up.

413
00:33:27,508 --> 00:33:28,592
I can't take you home today.

414
00:33:28,634 --> 00:33:30,385
Show yourself out later.

415
00:34:43,417 --> 00:34:44,293
The process...

416
00:34:47,129 --> 00:34:48,130
The ingredients...

417
00:34:49,255 --> 00:34:51,132
they're all here, but...

418
00:34:54,094 --> 00:34:56,304
How's it going, Jiansan?

419
00:34:56,346 --> 00:34:58,015
Don't rush me, I'm working on it.

420
00:35:52,027 --> 00:35:53,028
Get out.

421
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,406
Get out.

422
00:36:17,636 --> 00:36:19,888
How much longer
are you hiding it from me?

423
00:36:27,855 --> 00:36:30,482
All our clansmen
say you have a secret recipe,

424
00:36:30,524 --> 00:36:32,276
but you won't pass it to me.

425
00:36:33,402 --> 00:36:34,361
How am I supposed to be the heir?

426
00:36:34,403 --> 00:36:36,154
Do you know how embarrassing
it is for me?

427
00:36:40,909 --> 00:36:43,036
I've taught you everything I can.

428
00:36:44,246 --> 00:36:47,374
Knowing and doing it
for real are very different.

429
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:49,751
Why do you always kick me
out of the kitchen?

430
00:36:50,961 --> 00:36:52,462
What do you do in there?

431
00:36:57,259 --> 00:36:58,468
I get it.

432
00:37:00,345 --> 00:37:02,764
You never intend to pass me
the recipe, right?

433
00:37:03,974 --> 00:37:06,059
That's why I'll never
replicate your flavor.

434
00:37:06,101 --> 00:37:07,019
Am I right?

435
00:37:49,895 --> 00:37:53,273
I bought this at a bookstore
in the capital.

436
00:37:53,524 --> 00:37:54,942
Does this help?

437
00:37:54,983 --> 00:37:56,360
Of course it will.

438
00:37:56,401 --> 00:37:57,694
Will it really help?

439
00:37:57,736 --> 00:37:59,363
Of course, I'm sure of it.

440
00:37:59,404 --> 00:38:00,113
Are you sure?

441
00:38:00,155 --> 00:38:01,365
Just trust me.

442
00:38:01,406 --> 00:38:02,741
That's too much.

443
00:38:03,158 --> 00:38:04,576
Just look.

444
00:38:04,618 --> 00:38:05,619
Memorize all of this,

445
00:38:05,661 --> 00:38:07,246
and you'll pass for sure.

446
00:38:08,288 --> 00:38:09,540
Take your hands off her!

447
00:38:10,415 --> 00:38:12,292
You harass girls
in broad daylight now?

448
00:38:13,794 --> 00:38:14,878
Jiansan.

449
00:38:18,382 --> 00:38:20,384
Who said that you could touch her?

450
00:38:22,386 --> 00:38:23,345
Who gave you permission?!

451
00:38:23,387 --> 00:38:24,763
Xiaoyue asked me to come.

452
00:38:39,152 --> 00:38:41,238
Who the hell
do you think you are?

453
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,990
You just make pastries.

454
00:38:43,031 --> 00:38:44,408
You think you're good enough for her?

455
00:38:44,783 --> 00:38:47,244
You can't even make it
as good as your father.

456
00:38:47,286 --> 00:38:48,537
You don't know a damn thing.

457
00:38:58,881 --> 00:39:00,257
Get something straight, Liu Jiansan.

458
00:39:00,507 --> 00:39:02,050
Xiaoyue's mine.

459
00:39:02,092 --> 00:39:03,760
You're not good enough for her.

460
00:39:57,231 --> 00:39:58,232
Hey there, nephew.

461
00:39:59,107 --> 00:39:59,775
Your money.

462
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,235
I don't want it.

463
00:40:02,277 --> 00:40:04,112
You want the secret recipe for Crystal Cake?

464
00:40:04,655 --> 00:40:05,572
I'll tell you the truth.

465
00:40:05,614 --> 00:40:06,406
It doesn't exist!

466
00:40:06,615 --> 00:40:08,158
Go find it yourself.

467
00:40:19,461 --> 00:40:20,629
What the hell are you looking at?

468
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,609
Let's eat.

469
00:41:18,729 --> 00:41:19,730
I want to move out.

470
00:41:26,653 --> 00:41:28,030
Let me have a cigarette.

471
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:06,276
Don't you have anything to say?

472
00:42:18,914 --> 00:42:20,666
Look at this smoke.

473
00:42:22,793 --> 00:42:24,127
It can go wherever it wants.

474
00:42:24,169 --> 00:42:25,754
It doesn't answer to anyone.

475
00:42:35,764 --> 00:42:37,015
Our forefathers...

476
00:42:38,767 --> 00:42:40,769
None of them has ever met their grandchildren.

477
00:42:42,563 --> 00:42:44,439
That's why I named you Jiansan
("To see 3").

478
00:42:47,484 --> 00:42:50,279
I want to see 3 generations
under the same roof.

479
00:42:58,537 --> 00:43:00,372
I'm afraid I've disappointed you.

480
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:03,292
Sorry that you have
such a disobedient son.

481
00:43:11,633 --> 00:43:14,136
Before she died,
your mother made me promise...

482
00:43:14,761 --> 00:43:16,096
that I wouldn't make you walk
in my footsteps.

483
00:43:16,138 --> 00:43:17,472
That's perfect.

484
00:43:18,891 --> 00:43:20,225
I'll never walk in your footsteps.

485
00:43:51,548 --> 00:43:52,049
Hello?

486
00:43:52,132 --> 00:43:53,467
Jiansan.

487
00:43:53,509 --> 00:43:54,468
Jiansan.

488
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:56,386
Jiansan, listen to me, man.

489
00:43:57,346 --> 00:43:59,348
I'm so sorry, man.

490
00:43:59,389 --> 00:44:01,225
My mom said that if I left home,

491
00:44:01,266 --> 00:44:02,643
she'd poison herself.

492
00:44:02,851 --> 00:44:03,685
Look, man...

493
00:44:03,727 --> 00:44:05,812
Why don't you go ahead?

494
00:44:05,854 --> 00:44:07,064
I'll figure out how to join you later.

495
00:44:07,105 --> 00:44:07,940
How can you do this to me?

496
00:44:07,981 --> 00:44:09,399
Hello?

497
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:50,107
Stop! It's time to meet your maker.

498
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:58,782
Excuse me, is Hu...

499
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:05,664
What do we do?
There's so many of them.

500
00:45:06,039 --> 00:45:07,040
Don't be afraid.

501
00:45:17,634 --> 00:45:18,385
Sorry, Director.

502
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:19,761
Cut! Cut!

503
00:45:20,137 --> 00:45:21,388
What's wrong with the sword?!

504
00:45:22,514 --> 00:45:23,348
Hu!

505
00:45:23,765 --> 00:45:24,892
Hu!

506
00:45:27,019 --> 00:45:27,853
Sorry, Director.

507
00:45:27,895 --> 00:45:29,021
I'll get it fixed in a minute.

508
00:45:29,229 --> 00:45:30,814
Get a new sword, Shuan Zi.
Quickly!

509
00:45:30,856 --> 00:45:31,982
Take a look at this, Dao.

510
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,026
I'm so sorry.

511
00:45:34,651 --> 00:45:35,360
Hurry up!

512
00:45:35,402 --> 00:45:36,653
Thanks.

513
00:45:36,987 --> 00:45:37,613
It'll be fine.

514
00:45:37,654 --> 00:45:38,739
Don't worry.

515
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:39,448
Hu.

516
00:45:39,489 --> 00:45:40,240
Here's the new one.

517
00:45:40,616 --> 00:45:41,116
No problem.

518
00:45:41,158 --> 00:45:41,742
Hu.

519
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:42,868
Hu.

520
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:43,702
I've finally found you.

521
00:45:43,744 --> 00:45:44,995
There you are, Jiansan.

522
00:45:45,162 --> 00:45:45,871
We're in the way.

523
00:45:45,913 --> 00:45:46,371
Let's go over there.

524
00:45:46,413 --> 00:45:47,039
Move it.

525
00:45:47,414 --> 00:45:48,415
We're ready, sir!

526
00:45:49,499 --> 00:45:50,501
Everyone in position!

527
00:45:50,542 --> 00:45:51,668
Let's do another take.

528
00:45:52,753 --> 00:45:53,504
Quan,

529
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,215
didn't you check that
before the shoot?

530
00:45:57,132 --> 00:45:57,591
Seriously...

531
00:45:57,633 --> 00:45:58,634
It'll be fixed in a sec.

532
00:45:59,259 --> 00:45:59,885
Bro,

533
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:01,887
this is how movies are made?

534
00:46:02,721 --> 00:46:03,639
This is nothing.

535
00:46:04,848 --> 00:46:06,683
Since you're here,
come work with us tomorrow.

536
00:46:06,725 --> 00:46:07,226
Sure.

537
00:46:07,267 --> 00:46:07,893
Oh, by the way,

538
00:46:08,268 --> 00:46:09,228
that's Suan Zi.

539
00:46:09,728 --> 00:46:11,396
Talk to him
if you have any questions.

540
00:46:11,438 --> 00:46:12,064
That's right.

541
00:46:12,231 --> 00:46:13,315
Hu is always busy.

542
00:46:13,357 --> 00:46:14,608
If you have questions about anything,

543
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:15,526
just come to me.

544
00:46:15,984 --> 00:46:16,985
Nice to meet you.

545
00:46:51,144 --> 00:46:51,854
Everyone in position!

546
00:46:51,895 --> 00:46:52,980
We're about to shoot.

547
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:54,982
Jiansan, bring the wine over.

548
00:46:56,066 --> 00:46:57,025
Here it comes!

549
00:46:57,901 --> 00:46:58,735
Good.

550
00:47:00,612 --> 00:47:01,405
Get a move on.

551
00:47:02,614 --> 00:47:03,240
Action!

552
00:47:03,907 --> 00:47:04,783
In that case...

553
00:47:05,742 --> 00:47:06,618
Cheers.

554
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,251
Why is this real wine?!

555
00:47:14,293 --> 00:47:15,085
Cut! Cut!

556
00:47:15,127 --> 00:47:16,086
Props, what's going on?

557
00:47:16,128 --> 00:47:17,045
Sorry, sir.

558
00:47:17,087 --> 00:47:17,796
We'll fix it right away.

559
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:19,047
Jiansan, change them to grape juice.

560
00:47:19,089 --> 00:47:20,507
Who said to use real wine?
Move it!

561
00:47:21,383 --> 00:47:22,718
What's wrong with you, man?

562
00:47:22,885 --> 00:47:23,719
Sorry.

563
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:24,678
I can't have alcohol!

564
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:25,846
I can't act
when I've had alcohol!

565
00:47:25,888 --> 00:47:26,471
I'm changing it right now.

566
00:47:26,513 --> 00:47:27,556
What's wrong with you?

567
00:47:27,598 --> 00:47:28,765
Sorry, just a second.

568
00:47:28,807 --> 00:47:29,224
I forgot to ask.

569
00:47:29,266 --> 00:47:30,267
Make-up!

570
00:47:35,105 --> 00:47:36,690
What the hell is this?!

571
00:47:36,732 --> 00:47:38,108
It's rock hard!

572
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:39,067
Cut! Cut! Cut!

573
00:47:39,109 --> 00:47:39,860
Props, what is this?!

574
00:47:39,902 --> 00:47:40,611
Sorry, Director.

575
00:47:40,652 --> 00:47:41,195
I'll get it fixed!

576
00:47:41,236 --> 00:47:41,987
What's with you?

577
00:47:42,029 --> 00:47:43,113
Is this intentional?

578
00:47:43,155 --> 00:47:44,364
Are you a real professional or not?

579
00:47:44,406 --> 00:47:45,199
Are you even supposed to be here?

580
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,074
I'm so sorry.

581
00:47:46,116 --> 00:47:46,742
Go on.

582
00:47:46,783 --> 00:47:48,410
Go do the next shot.

583
00:47:48,911 --> 00:47:49,536
Get a new one.

584
00:47:49,912 --> 00:47:50,913
Sorry.

585
00:47:51,246 --> 00:47:51,872
Action!

586
00:47:58,378 --> 00:47:59,213
An action movie!

587
00:47:59,254 --> 00:47:59,880
This is awesome.

588
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:01,006
Cut!

589
00:48:03,342 --> 00:48:04,468
Everyone in positions!

590
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:05,344
Time to work.

591
00:48:05,385 --> 00:48:06,428
Stop eating, you two.

592
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:07,513
Get a move on.

593
00:48:07,888 --> 00:48:09,473
Hurry up!

594
00:48:09,515 --> 00:48:10,849
Coming!

595
00:48:25,656 --> 00:48:27,032
Cut! Cut! Cut!

596
00:48:28,283 --> 00:48:29,284
You nitwit!

597
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,662
Where did we get this actor?

598
00:48:32,412 --> 00:48:33,914
who doesn't know
how to use a rolling pin?

599
00:48:34,748 --> 00:48:35,666
What am I supposed to do?

600
00:48:36,792 --> 00:48:38,043
What do I do?!

601
00:48:40,504 --> 00:48:41,338
Director...

602
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:43,382
why don't I give it a try?

603
00:48:44,341 --> 00:48:46,385
Scene 18, shot 3, take 3.

604
00:49:11,368 --> 00:49:12,035
Jiansan...

605
00:49:12,494 --> 00:49:13,120
Bro.

606
00:49:13,787 --> 00:49:15,414
Nicely done.

607
00:49:16,039 --> 00:49:17,791
You really inherited your dad's skills.

608
00:49:18,542 --> 00:49:19,918
It was easy.

609
00:49:20,752 --> 00:49:23,088
I've been kneading dough all my life.

610
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:25,090
It wasn't much.

611
00:49:27,384 --> 00:49:28,635
In our line of work,

612
00:49:29,469 --> 00:49:30,220
you endure,

613
00:49:30,888 --> 00:49:32,097
be ruthless,

614
00:49:32,389 --> 00:49:33,390
or get the hell out.

615
00:49:35,726 --> 00:49:37,436
Keep working for me,

616
00:49:37,477 --> 00:49:39,104
and I'll take you places.

617
00:49:40,939 --> 00:49:41,607
Hey, little girl,

618
00:49:42,107 --> 00:49:43,692
don't go easy on me.

619
00:49:43,734 --> 00:49:44,776
Put your back into it.

620
00:49:47,154 --> 00:49:48,739
This is my first time.

621
00:49:49,031 --> 00:49:50,032
It's nice.

622
00:49:50,365 --> 00:49:51,325
It's good, right?

623
00:49:51,366 --> 00:49:53,243
I don't feel that well.

624
00:49:53,869 --> 00:49:55,495
It means you have health problems.

625
00:50:07,633 --> 00:50:08,467
Hu.

626
00:50:13,889 --> 00:50:14,765
Hu?

627
00:50:17,267 --> 00:50:18,101
Hu!

628
00:50:19,853 --> 00:50:20,479
Hu!

629
00:50:20,687 --> 00:50:21,146
Get on the phone.

630
00:50:21,188 --> 00:50:22,064
Call an ambulance!

631
00:50:22,105 --> 00:50:22,564
Quickly!

632
00:50:22,606 --> 00:50:23,857
Hu!

633
00:50:24,191 --> 00:50:24,775
Hu!

634
00:50:25,025 --> 00:50:27,027
Mr. Liu, please reconsider.

635
00:50:27,361 --> 00:50:28,946
We've been working on this
for over 6 months.

636
00:50:28,987 --> 00:50:29,863
Hu's fallen ill,

637
00:50:29,905 --> 00:50:31,573
but we can still work.

638
00:50:31,615 --> 00:50:32,699
Am I right?

639
00:50:32,741 --> 00:50:33,742
That's right.

640
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:36,745
Look, we have rules to abide by.

641
00:50:37,371 --> 00:50:39,039
We've already got a new crew.

642
00:50:40,624 --> 00:50:41,625
Sorry, man.

643
00:50:42,167 --> 00:50:42,751
Just go.

644
00:50:43,544 --> 00:50:44,837
Mr. Liu, please reconsider.

645
00:50:44,878 --> 00:50:45,754
Hey!

646
00:50:46,129 --> 00:50:47,422
Long time no see.

647
00:50:47,464 --> 00:50:48,298
Come on in.

648
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:49,299
Sit down.

649
00:50:49,341 --> 00:50:50,509
Thanks for coming in.

650
00:50:51,343 --> 00:50:52,511
Forget it, Jiansan.

651
00:50:53,095 --> 00:50:54,638
Don't you get it now?

652
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,100
I'll go talk to Li's team.

653
00:50:58,141 --> 00:50:59,977
I'll call you if there's work.

654
00:51:00,644 --> 00:51:01,478
Let's go.

655
00:51:30,883 --> 00:51:31,967
Noodle's ready.

656
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:33,969
Morning!

657
00:51:34,011 --> 00:51:35,721
Morning, take a seat.

658
00:51:35,762 --> 00:51:36,638
A portion of dumplings, please.

659
00:51:40,726 --> 00:51:41,768
Right this way.

660
00:51:46,231 --> 00:51:49,026
Stop fighting!

661
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,281
Stop fighting!

662
00:51:55,032 --> 00:51:57,534
Stop fighting!

663
00:51:59,661 --> 00:52:02,956
I'm sorry.

664
00:52:02,998 --> 00:52:04,750
Who else wants some?!

665
00:52:15,719 --> 00:52:18,514
My food will conquer the world!

666
00:52:25,395 --> 00:52:27,022
Waitress!

667
00:52:27,064 --> 00:52:28,941
Where's my order? It's been forever.

668
00:52:28,982 --> 00:52:30,275
Coming right up.

669
00:52:47,251 --> 00:52:48,502
On TV just now...

670
00:52:48,544 --> 00:52:50,087
that was your hand, right?

671
00:52:59,388 --> 00:53:00,848
What's going on?

672
00:53:00,889 --> 00:53:02,099
I'm in a hurry.

673
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:02,808
Hurry up!

674
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:04,476
Sorry, I'll be right over.

675
00:53:07,354 --> 00:53:08,313
I'm off from work soon.

676
00:53:08,355 --> 00:53:09,648
Wait for me.

677
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:10,941
I have something to tell you.

678
00:53:12,651 --> 00:53:13,944
Where are our wonton?

679
00:53:13,986 --> 00:53:15,112
Waitress, two more Baozi!

680
00:53:15,153 --> 00:53:16,405
Waitress,

681
00:53:17,155 --> 00:53:18,824
can I get some napkins?

682
00:53:18,866 --> 00:53:19,867
Sure thing.

683
00:53:21,159 --> 00:53:23,328
I told you, I'm in a hurry!

684
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:24,329
Sorry to keep you waiting.

685
00:53:24,371 --> 00:53:25,706
Thanks.

686
00:53:25,747 --> 00:53:26,623
Waitress, my Baozi?

687
00:53:26,665 --> 00:53:27,624
Can you speed it up?

688
00:53:27,666 --> 00:53:29,251
The fried dough sticks?

689
00:53:30,002 --> 00:53:31,170
Napkins over here.

690
00:53:34,882 --> 00:53:36,842
Here are your wonton

691
00:54:11,877 --> 00:54:13,003
Thanks.

692
00:54:24,097 --> 00:54:24,890
When...

693
00:54:26,391 --> 00:54:28,268
When did you move out?

694
00:54:33,857 --> 00:54:35,275
After what happened last time...

695
00:54:45,285 --> 00:54:46,411
I'm sorry.

696
00:54:47,871 --> 00:54:49,164
It was my fault.

697
00:54:51,875 --> 00:54:53,919
I wanted to leave so badly.

698
00:54:56,588 --> 00:54:58,382
I asked A Fu

699
00:54:59,383 --> 00:55:01,635
to get exam information from his father.

700
00:55:06,139 --> 00:55:07,891
I know it must have hurt.

701
00:55:09,017 --> 00:55:10,978
I was selfish.

702
00:55:14,857 --> 00:55:15,816
I'm sorry.

703
00:55:24,116 --> 00:55:25,659
I've wanted to apologize all this time.

704
00:55:37,004 --> 00:55:39,131
I'm glad I ran into you.

705
00:55:40,257 --> 00:55:41,091
I really am...

706
00:56:38,482 --> 00:56:39,316
Cousin...

707
00:56:40,609 --> 00:56:41,360
Handling a huge shop by yourself

708
00:56:41,401 --> 00:56:43,153
must be exhausting.

709
00:56:43,612 --> 00:56:44,863
How's Jiansan doing?

710
00:56:46,281 --> 00:56:47,366
He's fine...

711
00:56:47,407 --> 00:56:48,367
He's fine...

712
00:56:48,784 --> 00:56:49,618
Look, cousin...

713
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:51,161
This hundred-year-old shop

714
00:56:51,662 --> 00:56:52,996
shouldn't be your burden alone.

715
00:56:53,038 --> 00:56:54,540
Let's work together.

716
00:57:01,255 --> 00:57:02,965
That Tong Shun Xiang sign

717
00:57:06,468 --> 00:57:07,761
is one of a kind.

718
00:57:25,654 --> 00:57:26,530
It's Jiansan.

719
00:57:27,531 --> 00:57:28,115
Hi, Dad.

720
00:57:28,782 --> 00:57:29,366
Nothing much.

721
00:57:29,408 --> 00:57:31,243
Just called to say that I got married.

722
00:57:32,744 --> 00:57:33,662
And Xiaoyue's pregnant.

723
00:57:35,163 --> 00:57:36,123
Xiaoyue's pregnant.

724
00:57:36,623 --> 00:57:38,000
The signal here is weak.

725
00:57:38,625 --> 00:57:39,501
I can't hear you clearly.

726
00:57:39,543 --> 00:57:40,544
I have to go.
I'll talk to you later.

727
00:57:40,752 --> 00:57:41,545
Bye.

728
00:57:47,217 --> 00:57:48,635
How's your dad?

729
00:57:50,387 --> 00:57:51,096
He's fine.

730
00:57:51,138 --> 00:57:52,139
Totally fine.

731
00:57:52,764 --> 00:57:54,016
Still hanging on to that shop.

732
00:57:57,227 --> 00:57:58,395
Forefathers...

733
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:01,064
Forefathers...

734
00:58:01,106 --> 00:58:03,400
3 generations of us
will be under one roof.

735
00:58:05,110 --> 00:58:06,612
Congrats on your marriage!

736
00:58:14,995 --> 00:58:16,246
Let's have another one.

737
00:58:17,789 --> 00:58:19,499
I learned so much from you

738
00:58:19,541 --> 00:58:21,543
while working on this film.

739
00:58:22,252 --> 00:58:23,795
All of us owe you so much.

740
00:58:23,837 --> 00:58:24,713
I mean it.

741
00:58:24,755 --> 00:58:25,756
It's a huge honor

742
00:58:26,006 --> 00:58:26,882
working for you.

743
00:58:27,341 --> 00:58:29,635
I can learn a lot from you.

744
00:58:32,721 --> 00:58:33,722
Hello?

745
00:58:34,515 --> 00:58:35,766
Really?

746
00:58:37,518 --> 00:58:40,145
I'm officially a dad!

747
00:58:46,026 --> 00:58:46,860
Say "grandpa."

748
00:58:47,736 --> 00:58:48,987
That's right, I'm "Grandpa."

749
00:58:55,035 --> 00:58:57,496
Grandpa's touching my little cheeks...

750
00:59:02,668 --> 00:59:04,044
Such strong arms.

751
00:59:04,753 --> 00:59:05,587
Let Grandpa hold you.

752
00:59:05,629 --> 00:59:06,964
You want to get up?

753
00:59:07,005 --> 00:59:08,632
Let Grandpa hold you.

754
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:15,347
We're going up.

755
00:59:22,145 --> 00:59:23,230
You went way up.

756
00:59:23,355 --> 00:59:24,982
Give us a kiss.

757
00:59:29,278 --> 00:59:31,029
Oh, Grandpa's mustache must be itchy.

758
00:59:38,912 --> 00:59:40,163
Look at this.

759
00:59:41,790 --> 00:59:42,749
See this?

760
00:59:42,791 --> 00:59:44,168
This is Grandpa's Crystal Cake.

761
00:59:44,668 --> 00:59:45,627
See it?

762
00:59:45,669 --> 00:59:47,004
It's Crystal Cake from your Grandpa.

763
00:59:47,379 --> 00:59:48,630
"I want some!"

764
00:59:50,757 --> 00:59:51,466
Dad,

765
00:59:52,134 --> 00:59:53,760
she can only have milk.

766
00:59:54,636 --> 00:59:56,013
I'll just let her lick it.

767
00:59:56,346 --> 00:59:58,140
Just a lick.

768
01:00:01,351 --> 01:00:02,895
But you can't eat it.

769
01:00:09,610 --> 01:00:10,235
Dad...

770
01:00:10,277 --> 01:00:11,987
You must be tired.

771
01:00:12,029 --> 01:00:13,280
Let me hold her for a bit.

772
01:00:14,781 --> 01:00:16,033
Wenyan loves Grandpa.

773
01:00:16,909 --> 01:00:17,784
Bella...

774
01:00:18,243 --> 01:00:19,411
let Mommy hold you.

775
01:00:22,122 --> 01:00:23,165
What did you call her?

776
01:00:26,627 --> 01:00:28,962
That's the name Jiansan
and I gave her.

777
01:00:29,254 --> 01:00:30,130
Bella Liu.

778
01:00:30,506 --> 01:00:31,590
It sounds elegant, doesn't it?

779
01:00:32,257 --> 01:00:33,091
Come here.

780
01:00:40,974 --> 01:00:42,267
Wenyan.

781
01:00:43,894 --> 01:00:45,229
Grandpa's Wenyan.

782
01:00:45,854 --> 01:00:46,855
Come here.

783
01:00:47,731 --> 01:00:49,483
Look at this.

784
01:00:54,488 --> 01:00:55,739
Liu Wenyan.

785
01:00:57,282 --> 01:00:58,492
That's her name.

786
01:01:03,288 --> 01:01:04,498
Let's give her this name.

787
01:01:07,167 --> 01:01:10,879
"My name's going to be Wenyan."

788
01:01:12,339 --> 01:01:13,590
Wenyan...

789
01:01:14,007 --> 01:01:14,967
You have to scream,

790
01:01:15,008 --> 01:01:16,885
"Liu Jiansan!"

791
01:01:19,096 --> 01:01:21,014
"Come home!"

792
01:01:29,231 --> 01:01:30,107
Are you looking at this?

793
01:01:32,276 --> 01:01:33,652
You're home.

794
01:01:34,653 --> 01:01:35,529
Your dad's here.

795
01:01:36,029 --> 01:01:37,114
Look who's home?

796
01:01:39,241 --> 01:01:39,992
Dad...

797
01:01:40,033 --> 01:01:41,368
When did you get here, Dad?

798
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,620
Why didn't you tell me?

799
01:01:43,662 --> 01:01:44,997
I could've gone to pick you up.

800
01:01:45,539 --> 01:01:46,665
No need for that.

801
01:01:47,791 --> 01:01:48,876
Get the good wine.

802
01:01:48,917 --> 01:01:50,252
I want to have a drink with dad.

803
01:01:51,128 --> 01:01:52,254
Look who's home?

804
01:01:54,381 --> 01:01:55,007
Bella.

805
01:01:55,465 --> 01:01:56,341
Look who's home?

806
01:01:57,134 --> 01:01:57,926
Bella.

807
01:01:57,968 --> 01:01:59,219
Daddy's home.

808
01:01:59,261 --> 01:02:00,095
Forget him.

809
01:02:01,388 --> 01:02:02,639
You're a father now.

810
01:02:03,390 --> 01:02:04,516
You shouldn't stay out so late.

811
01:02:07,477 --> 01:02:09,313
We just finished a huge film,

812
01:02:10,355 --> 01:02:12,608
so I took my guys out to celebrate.

813
01:02:13,275 --> 01:02:15,527
Your guys are more important
than your family?

814
01:02:17,905 --> 01:02:18,614
Listen to me,

815
01:02:18,655 --> 01:02:20,532
the most important thing for you right now

816
01:02:21,408 --> 01:02:22,659
is to take proper care

817
01:02:23,785 --> 01:02:25,996
of Wenyan here.

818
01:02:26,496 --> 01:02:27,164
Am I right?

819
01:02:27,789 --> 01:02:28,874
There, I taught him a lesson.

820
01:02:30,876 --> 01:02:31,793
Jiansan...

821
01:02:33,003 --> 01:02:34,254
It's from Dad.

822
01:02:36,089 --> 01:02:36,757
Come here.

823
01:02:37,883 --> 01:02:38,884
Rememeber...

824
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:41,011
That's your name now...

825
01:02:41,386 --> 01:02:44,014
Liu Wenyan.

826
01:02:48,018 --> 01:02:49,520
The money's for you.

827
01:02:50,145 --> 01:02:51,813
I know living in the city is expensive.

828
01:02:53,690 --> 01:02:55,025
Give us a smile.

829
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:56,527
Give us a smile.

830
01:02:57,277 --> 01:02:58,737
Give us a real smile.

831
01:02:59,988 --> 01:03:00,906
Where's that smile?

832
01:03:01,365 --> 01:03:02,533
There it is.

833
01:03:05,244 --> 01:03:07,037
It's time to get up

834
01:03:07,538 --> 01:03:08,789
and look around.

835
01:03:12,793 --> 01:03:14,545
You've got a baby daughter.

836
01:03:16,505 --> 01:03:18,632
You can't let Xiaoyue
raise her by herself.

837
01:03:20,133 --> 01:03:21,760
You have to spend time with them.

838
01:03:24,513 --> 01:03:26,306
I've got a lot of guys
working for me.

839
01:03:26,348 --> 01:03:27,891
They depend on me
to make a living.

840
01:03:31,603 --> 01:03:32,938
It's not easy for me,
you know.

841
01:03:37,276 --> 01:03:39,778
If it's so hard
to make money out there...

842
01:03:42,531 --> 01:03:43,657
Come home.

843
01:03:47,411 --> 01:03:49,371
Take over the shop.

844
01:03:50,163 --> 01:03:52,040
I'll teach you everything
you need to know.

845
01:03:53,917 --> 01:03:55,919
The shop is as good as yours.

846
01:04:04,970 --> 01:04:07,139
You didn't want to teach me
back then...

847
01:04:08,891 --> 01:04:10,517
And now I don't need it anymore.

848
01:04:14,146 --> 01:04:16,440
I know what I'm doing for once.

849
01:04:18,650 --> 01:04:20,777
Everything I do now...

850
01:04:21,528 --> 01:04:22,905
I earned it all by myself.

851
01:04:26,658 --> 01:04:28,035
I'm doing just fine.

852
01:04:36,793 --> 01:04:38,420
I see...

853
01:04:41,089 --> 01:04:42,216
Think about it some more.

854
01:04:43,217 --> 01:04:44,718
Don't make a decision you'll regret.

855
01:04:50,766 --> 01:04:52,017
I don't regret a thing.

856
01:06:10,137 --> 01:06:12,097
Mommy...

857
01:06:12,139 --> 01:06:13,515
Wenyan.

858
01:06:22,608 --> 01:06:24,151
Mommy...

859
01:06:26,528 --> 01:06:28,030
Mommy...

860
01:06:33,285 --> 01:06:34,870
Mommy...

861
01:06:46,215 --> 01:06:47,466
You're Liu Wenyan's parent?

862
01:06:47,508 --> 01:06:48,008
I am.

863
01:06:48,133 --> 01:06:49,343
Come on in.

864
01:06:53,263 --> 01:06:54,640
Your child has infantile pneumonia.

865
01:06:55,015 --> 01:06:57,267
There's a large area of infection in her lungs.

866
01:06:57,518 --> 01:06:59,019
If we can't get the infection under control,

867
01:06:59,394 --> 01:07:00,979
she'll need a ventilator.

868
01:07:55,367 --> 01:07:57,244
We got another overdue notice.

869
01:07:58,412 --> 01:07:59,788
This money pit is bottomless.

870
01:08:01,164 --> 01:08:02,666
When I finish this film,

871
01:08:03,375 --> 01:08:04,626
we'll have some money come in.

872
01:08:14,761 --> 01:08:16,138
Just wait a little longer.

873
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:21,350
Her illness can't wait.

874
01:08:21,894 --> 01:08:23,270
She's a child.

875
01:08:24,854 --> 01:08:26,982
Why does she have to endure this?

876
01:08:29,984 --> 01:08:32,112
If only I could take her place...

877
01:09:28,877 --> 01:09:30,045
2 per customer!

878
01:09:33,465 --> 01:09:35,133
I want 2 today.

879
01:09:41,265 --> 01:09:42,015
Thanks.

880
01:09:44,893 --> 01:09:46,144
2, please.

881
01:09:47,270 --> 01:09:48,354
Thanks.

882
01:09:49,731 --> 01:09:50,941
I'll take 2.

883
01:09:52,609 --> 01:09:53,777
Ten yuan's your change.

884
01:10:32,983 --> 01:10:34,026
There's no limit anymore.

885
01:10:34,067 --> 01:10:35,360
That's great.

886
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:41,283
Come on, Li.

887
01:10:41,658 --> 01:10:42,367
How many?

888
01:10:42,409 --> 01:10:43,327
No limit?

889
01:10:43,368 --> 01:10:44,661
As many as you want.

890
01:10:48,290 --> 01:10:49,291
I'll take 3.

891
01:11:06,767 --> 01:11:07,392
Hello?

892
01:11:07,643 --> 01:11:08,352
Dad.

893
01:11:08,644 --> 01:11:10,145
Wenyan's operation was a success.

894
01:11:10,521 --> 01:11:12,147
It took a little long,

895
01:11:12,189 --> 01:11:13,315
but she'll be fine.

896
01:11:13,607 --> 01:11:16,026
The doctor says
she just need some time to recover.

897
01:11:17,486 --> 01:11:18,654
That's good.

898
01:11:19,154 --> 01:11:20,489
Jiansan's here, too.

899
01:11:20,531 --> 01:11:21,657
Don't worry.

900
01:11:22,866 --> 01:11:23,909
Sure.

901
01:11:24,618 --> 01:11:25,869
She's fine now.

902
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:47,599
You're home!

903
01:11:47,641 --> 01:11:48,642
Daddy!

904
01:11:49,351 --> 01:11:50,477
Come here, baby.

905
01:11:50,519 --> 01:11:51,228
Let me see you.

906
01:11:52,729 --> 01:11:54,606
My Wenyan's all grown up.

907
01:11:55,607 --> 01:11:56,567
Did you miss Daddy?

908
01:11:56,608 --> 01:11:57,401
I did.

909
01:11:57,860 --> 01:11:59,653
Were you good to Mommy while I was gone?

910
01:12:00,779 --> 01:12:03,282
Were you?

911
01:12:04,533 --> 01:12:06,159
I need to unpack.

912
01:12:08,537 --> 01:12:10,289
Come eat something first.

913
01:12:11,665 --> 01:12:13,292
Start without me.

914
01:12:19,131 --> 01:12:20,465
Are you glad that Daddy's home?

915
01:12:20,507 --> 01:12:21,717
I am!

916
01:12:22,509 --> 01:12:24,261
Get Daddy a bowl of rice.

917
01:12:31,894 --> 01:12:33,395
Mommy, come here.

918
01:12:41,361 --> 01:12:42,988
You just got home,
and you're leaving again?

919
01:12:45,282 --> 01:12:46,408
I just got a phone call.

920
01:12:46,909 --> 01:12:48,035
A big shot director

921
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:49,411
just fired his props team.

922
01:12:49,995 --> 01:12:51,747
I need to bring a few guys
over there right now.

923
01:12:55,542 --> 01:12:56,793
Daddy.

924
01:12:57,419 --> 01:12:58,921
Don't leave.

925
01:13:01,215 --> 01:13:02,007
Come here.

926
01:13:05,344 --> 01:13:06,678
Daddy will be home soon.

927
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:07,554
Alright?

928
01:13:07,596 --> 01:13:08,430
When I come home,

929
01:13:08,472 --> 01:13:09,848
I'll buy you something nice to eat.

930
01:13:10,641 --> 01:13:11,975
Listen to Mommy
and be a good girl.

931
01:13:12,017 --> 01:13:13,352
Okay? Be good.

932
01:13:17,481 --> 01:13:19,983
We haven't sat down
for a meal in 6 months.

933
01:13:20,651 --> 01:13:22,152
At least sit down for this one.

934
01:13:22,277 --> 01:13:23,779
It won't take much time.

935
01:13:25,155 --> 01:13:26,907
I still have things to talk to you about.

936
01:13:27,407 --> 01:13:28,659
We can talk when I'm back.

937
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:33,038
Wenyan has to start school soon.

938
01:13:35,791 --> 01:13:37,668
She's not eligible for public school.

939
01:13:38,043 --> 01:13:39,628
And private school is too expensive.

940
01:13:43,882 --> 01:13:44,842
I got it.

941
01:13:44,883 --> 01:13:46,009
I'll think of something.

942
01:13:48,387 --> 01:13:50,013
You don't have to work like this.

943
01:13:51,265 --> 01:13:52,766
I can find work, too.

944
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:55,227
Then we can spend more time together

945
01:13:55,269 --> 01:13:56,645
as a family.

946
01:13:59,982 --> 01:14:00,858
Jiansan!

947
01:14:02,526 --> 01:14:03,277
Jiansan!

948
01:14:05,904 --> 01:14:07,281
I'll be right there!

949
01:14:12,786 --> 01:14:14,288
Let's drop this for now.

950
01:14:14,496 --> 01:14:15,873
Wait until I finish this job

951
01:14:15,914 --> 01:14:17,291
and make some money.

952
01:14:17,916 --> 01:14:19,918
Then I can find a kindergarten
for Wenyan.

953
01:14:20,169 --> 01:14:22,421
And we'll go on a family trip, okay?

954
01:14:25,757 --> 01:14:27,259
You always say that.

955
01:14:29,094 --> 01:14:30,762
You just make empty promises.

956
01:14:32,014 --> 01:14:33,765
Even if that day really comes,

957
01:14:34,224 --> 01:14:35,601
we might not be here anymore.

958
01:14:36,143 --> 01:14:37,519
Is it really worth it?

959
01:14:41,356 --> 01:14:43,692
You think I don't want
to be with my family?

960
01:14:44,193 --> 01:14:45,944
I bust my ass out there every day

961
01:14:45,986 --> 01:14:48,113
just so I can make us some money.

962
01:14:49,156 --> 01:14:50,115
You should understand that.

963
01:14:50,157 --> 01:14:52,534
I can't do as I please.

964
01:14:57,873 --> 01:14:58,999
Jiansan,

965
01:14:59,166 --> 01:15:00,501
I've been thinking.

966
01:15:00,876 --> 01:15:03,128
Maybe we can take Wenyan home.

967
01:15:03,504 --> 01:15:05,088
You won't have to work so hard.

968
01:15:06,131 --> 01:15:07,257
Like your dad said...

969
01:15:08,509 --> 01:15:10,385
Tong Shun Xiang is ours if we want it.

970
01:15:11,261 --> 01:15:12,638
You can go by yourself.

971
01:15:13,138 --> 01:15:14,515
I'm staying here.

972
01:15:15,098 --> 01:15:17,142
I worked hard to build a life here.

973
01:15:19,228 --> 01:15:21,188
But we're nothing here.

974
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:35,536
Hello?

975
01:15:46,839 --> 01:15:47,840
Mommy!

976
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:49,258
It's a cow!

977
01:15:52,261 --> 01:15:53,595
Doesn't that colorful cloud look beautiful?

978
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:55,097
It does.

979
01:16:01,019 --> 01:16:02,354
Come on, let Daddy hold you.

980
01:16:07,401 --> 01:16:08,277
Wenyan,

981
01:16:08,527 --> 01:16:10,946
this is your parents' hometown. Gorgeous?

982
01:16:10,988 --> 01:16:12,072
Gorgeous.

983
01:16:12,114 --> 01:16:13,240
Look at that.

984
01:16:22,791 --> 01:16:23,750
Are you hungry?

985
01:16:25,627 --> 01:16:26,503
There are flower cakes over there.

986
01:16:26,545 --> 01:16:28,255
I'll buy some for you later, okay?

987
01:16:29,256 --> 01:16:30,215
It's an herbal medicine.

988
01:16:30,257 --> 01:16:31,466
You can make tea with it.

989
01:16:31,508 --> 01:16:32,885
It's great for detox.

990
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:34,261
Take a look.

991
01:16:34,761 --> 01:16:35,846
You can take a whiff of it for yourself.

992
01:16:36,388 --> 01:16:37,222
We also have this.

993
01:16:37,264 --> 01:16:38,140
Take a look.

994
01:16:38,515 --> 01:16:39,766
Give me that.

995
01:16:41,226 --> 01:16:41,852
Take this.

996
01:16:42,769 --> 01:16:43,729
Here's what I suggest...

997
01:16:43,770 --> 01:16:45,314
Come take a tour of our factory.

998
01:16:45,856 --> 01:16:47,983
We can have some tea.

999
01:17:00,037 --> 01:17:01,413
Dad.
(Temporarily Closed)

1000
01:17:01,914 --> 01:17:03,290
Where are we?

1001
01:17:05,667 --> 01:17:07,044
This...

1002
01:17:08,670 --> 01:17:09,963
This is our home.

1003
01:17:11,131 --> 01:17:12,466
We are home now.

1004
01:17:24,102 --> 01:17:25,729
Grandpa!

1005
01:17:28,732 --> 01:17:30,317
Wenyan...

1006
01:17:32,236 --> 01:17:33,028
You're home.

1007
01:17:33,487 --> 01:17:34,488
You're so lazy.

1008
01:17:34,530 --> 01:17:36,615
Why don't you get out of bed?

1009
01:17:40,786 --> 01:17:41,787
Grandpa

1010
01:17:42,371 --> 01:17:43,872
didn't know you are coming back

1011
01:17:44,665 --> 01:17:45,999
If I'd known you were coming home...

1012
01:17:46,041 --> 01:17:47,209
I would've woken up

1013
01:17:47,251 --> 01:17:49,211
to pick you and your parents up.

1014
01:17:49,253 --> 01:17:51,296
I got you some flowers.

1015
01:17:55,717 --> 01:17:57,970
They smell so nice.

1016
01:17:58,762 --> 01:17:59,972
Your grandpa's tired.

1017
01:18:00,013 --> 01:18:01,139
He needs some rest,

1018
01:18:01,515 --> 01:18:02,099
okay?

1019
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:03,141
Okay.

1020
01:18:21,034 --> 01:18:22,160
You're home.

1021
01:18:27,791 --> 01:18:28,876
Look at you.

1022
01:18:28,917 --> 01:18:30,294
What were you trying to prove?

1023
01:18:31,253 --> 01:18:32,754
You broke your own rule

1024
01:18:33,630 --> 01:18:35,132
and got yourself sick.

1025
01:18:36,216 --> 01:18:37,718
Screw the rules...

1026
01:18:47,019 --> 01:18:47,978
Dad...

1027
01:18:49,813 --> 01:18:51,565
Let's go see a doctor in the city.

1028
01:18:54,067 --> 01:18:55,986
As long as I can see Wenyan...

1029
01:18:59,281 --> 01:19:00,532
I'm happy.

1030
01:19:28,018 --> 01:19:31,647
"All alone in a strange land,
a lonely stranger am I."

1031
01:19:31,688 --> 01:19:35,526
"Thoughts of my kindred redouble
on every festive day."

1032
01:19:35,567 --> 01:19:39,488
"From afar I know, O brothers,
where in the hills we'd be,"

1033
01:19:39,530 --> 01:19:42,741
"each wearing a spray of dogwood,
all but the one away."

1034
01:19:43,158 --> 01:19:44,117
Good.

1035
01:19:45,869 --> 01:19:46,787
Very good.

1036
01:19:48,038 --> 01:19:49,248
Hai!

1037
01:20:01,718 --> 01:20:03,387
Little Wenyan...

1038
01:21:21,882 --> 01:21:23,091
Dad...

1039
01:21:23,133 --> 01:21:24,635
Let me do it.

1040
01:21:30,098 --> 01:21:31,558
Wenyan...

1041
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:32,601
Let's go.

1042
01:21:37,731 --> 01:21:38,565
Little bunny

1043
01:21:38,607 --> 01:21:40,442
hopping up and down, up and down.

1044
01:21:40,484 --> 01:21:42,486
All the way to your mustache.

1045
01:21:42,528 --> 01:21:43,487
It's so itchy!

1046
01:21:43,529 --> 01:21:45,072
Running all the way up your head.

1047
01:21:45,113 --> 01:21:46,490
It smells!

1048
01:21:54,665 --> 01:21:55,541
Dad.

1049
01:24:22,813 --> 01:24:24,189
Hey, Jiansan,

1050
01:24:24,481 --> 01:24:25,649
I got a huge job.

1051
01:24:25,691 --> 01:24:26,733
It's Zhang's film.

1052
01:24:27,317 --> 01:24:28,443
Come back right now.

1053
01:24:28,485 --> 01:24:30,028
We need you to sign the contract.

1054
01:24:31,029 --> 01:24:31,738
Hello?

1055
01:24:38,412 --> 01:24:39,872
They're rushing you back again?

1056
01:25:08,483 --> 01:25:10,402
Your dad, Tingshen,

1057
01:25:10,652 --> 01:25:11,904
was an upright man.

1058
01:25:13,030 --> 01:25:14,907
He was forgiving and benevolent.

1059
01:25:16,366 --> 01:25:17,993
But he left us way too early.

1060
01:25:19,494 --> 01:25:21,496
He worked himself to the bone.

1061
01:25:24,291 --> 01:25:27,169
After he had Jiansan,

1062
01:25:27,419 --> 01:25:29,129
he insisted on only making
2 trays a day.

1063
01:25:29,922 --> 01:25:31,840
But he eventually took away the limit.

1064
01:25:35,719 --> 01:25:36,970
Still, other than him,

1065
01:25:38,222 --> 01:25:40,307
no other heir
of the Tong Shun Xiang clan

1066
01:25:40,349 --> 01:25:42,142
got to see 3 generations
under one roof.

1067
01:25:42,893 --> 01:25:43,977
None of them

1068
01:25:44,144 --> 01:25:46,063
lived past 60 years old.

1069
01:25:47,606 --> 01:25:49,441
Is there really some kind of curse?

1070
01:25:57,533 --> 01:25:59,660
He did get to see
his granddaughter, though.

1071
01:26:00,619 --> 01:26:01,995
He must've been grateful for that.

1072
01:26:14,967 --> 01:26:16,343
What's Wenyan doing here?

1073
01:26:23,350 --> 01:26:25,519
A girl can't be in the family register.

1074
01:26:26,770 --> 01:26:27,938
This can't be right.

1075
01:26:28,313 --> 01:26:31,191
The Liu's only pass their skills
to male heirs.

1076
01:26:32,818 --> 01:26:34,319
Why is the ninth generation
there already?

1077
01:26:34,361 --> 01:26:35,737
You're going to pass it to her?

1078
01:26:35,779 --> 01:26:36,613
Are you serious?

1079
01:28:01,657 --> 01:28:04,368
"March 6, 1985."

1080
01:28:05,035 --> 01:28:06,036
"Today,

1081
01:28:06,495 --> 01:28:07,996
my son was born."

1082
01:28:08,539 --> 01:28:09,665
"At just 4 catties,

1083
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:11,291
he was a little small."

1084
01:28:13,126 --> 01:28:14,586
"In the Liu clan,

1085
01:28:14,628 --> 01:28:17,256
the clan elder inherits
the Crystal Cake recipe."

1086
01:28:18,382 --> 01:28:20,843
"In the making of Crystal Cakes,

1087
01:28:20,884 --> 01:28:22,094
the most important step

1088
01:28:22,719 --> 01:28:25,180
is WENYAN (to inhale the smoke)."

1089
01:28:25,597 --> 01:28:29,476
"To seize the moment
the special wood gives off its aroma,

1090
01:28:30,143 --> 01:28:31,979
I have to sit in front of the stove

1091
01:28:32,396 --> 01:28:33,856
and keep inhaling the smoke away."

1092
01:28:39,403 --> 01:28:40,529
"Inhaling smoke

1093
01:28:41,113 --> 01:28:43,407
is incredibly damaging
to one's health."

1094
01:28:44,867 --> 01:28:46,159
"But to keep up our tradition,

1095
01:28:46,535 --> 01:28:48,370
I have to keep making
Crystal Cakes

1096
01:28:48,787 --> 01:28:51,248
even if it kills me."

1097
01:28:51,999 --> 01:28:53,667
"When my son is grown,

1098
01:28:54,418 --> 01:28:56,879
he'll repeat the fate
of my forefathers and me."

1099
01:28:57,421 --> 01:28:59,590
Once you get married
and have a child,

1100
01:28:59,631 --> 01:29:01,508
the shop is yours.

1101
01:29:02,634 --> 01:29:04,386
"That's why I gave him the name

1102
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:05,971
Jiansan (to see 3 generations)."

1103
01:29:06,263 --> 01:29:08,891
"I hope to live long enough
to see his children."

1104
01:29:10,601 --> 01:29:11,894
"That's why I've decided the following:"

1105
01:29:12,728 --> 01:29:13,645
"One..."

1106
01:29:13,770 --> 01:29:16,481
"Without damaging my health,

1107
01:29:16,857 --> 01:29:19,067
find a way to replicate

1108
01:29:19,109 --> 01:29:20,903
the flavor of the Crystal Cake."

1109
01:29:22,654 --> 01:29:23,405
"Two..."

1110
01:29:23,989 --> 01:29:25,908
"To ensure that I'll see his children,

1111
01:29:26,158 --> 01:29:27,367
I've decided

1112
01:29:27,409 --> 01:29:29,620
to limit daily production

1113
01:29:29,745 --> 01:29:31,163
to just 2 trays."

1114
01:29:31,914 --> 01:29:32,664
I'm afraid not.

1115
01:29:32,789 --> 01:29:33,999
Sorry,

1116
01:29:34,041 --> 01:29:35,667
it's my dad's rule.

1117
01:29:38,921 --> 01:29:39,671
"Three..."

1118
01:29:40,130 --> 01:29:41,715
"From now on,

1119
01:29:41,757 --> 01:29:44,635
I'll record my progress

1120
01:29:45,135 --> 01:29:47,262
until I find a new recipe

1121
01:29:47,638 --> 01:29:49,139
that I can pass to Jiansan."

1122
01:29:52,392 --> 01:29:53,268
Get out.

1123
01:30:00,108 --> 01:30:02,861
"June 19, 1990."

1124
01:30:03,278 --> 01:30:04,363
"A rainy day."

1125
01:30:05,531 --> 01:30:07,908
"Jiansan's mother has died."

1126
01:30:08,992 --> 01:30:11,620
"I can't believe that she left before me."

1127
01:30:13,163 --> 01:30:14,414
"Before she passed,

1128
01:30:14,915 --> 01:30:17,417
I told her the secret of the Crystal Cake."

1129
01:30:18,418 --> 01:30:19,419
"She asked me not to

1130
01:30:19,795 --> 01:30:22,798
let Jiansan walk in my footsteps

1131
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:24,633
and endure the same fate."

1132
01:30:25,384 --> 01:30:27,344
That's why I'll never replicate your flavor.

1133
01:30:27,886 --> 01:30:28,637
Am I right?

1134
01:30:56,164 --> 01:30:59,042
"October 5, 2010. A sunny day."

1135
01:30:59,543 --> 01:31:02,004
"I've finally met my granddaughter."

1136
01:31:02,671 --> 01:31:04,298
"Wenyan is so adorable."

1137
01:31:04,339 --> 01:31:06,466
"Just like Jiansan back then."

1138
01:31:09,219 --> 01:31:11,513
"October 1, 2015."

1139
01:31:11,972 --> 01:31:13,265
"A sunny day."

1140
01:31:14,016 --> 01:31:15,601
"I've tried so many times,

1141
01:31:16,351 --> 01:31:17,477
only to fail."

1142
01:31:18,395 --> 01:31:20,439
"I can feel the energy going out of my body."

1143
01:31:20,814 --> 01:31:22,065
"The coughs

1144
01:31:22,107 --> 01:31:23,692
are getting worse."

1145
01:31:24,735 --> 01:31:26,820
"Other than the traditional way,

1146
01:31:26,862 --> 01:31:29,865
there's no other way
to make Crystal Cakes."

1147
01:31:31,241 --> 01:31:33,744
"Jiansan resents me for not teaching him the recipe."

1148
01:31:37,873 --> 01:31:39,208
"But to teach him

1149
01:31:39,249 --> 01:31:42,002
is to subject him
to the same fate as mine."

1150
01:31:43,003 --> 01:31:45,422
"Smoke inhaling...the Crystal Cake..."

1151
01:31:45,631 --> 01:31:49,218
"Maybe it's time to make them history."

1152
01:31:50,135 --> 01:31:52,763
"I hope he'll forge his own path."

1153
01:32:34,763 --> 01:32:35,389
Dad...

1154
01:32:42,354 --> 01:32:44,064
I can smell the flavor now.

1155
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:14,720
Thank you.

1156
01:33:16,388 --> 01:33:18,265
Thank you for everything.

1157
01:33:46,543 --> 01:33:48,003
I thought the owner's dead.

1158
01:33:48,045 --> 01:33:49,046
I thought so, too.

1159
01:33:52,883 --> 01:33:54,718
What's going on?

1160
01:34:00,849 --> 01:34:01,725
Isn't that...

1161
01:34:01,767 --> 01:34:02,768
Jiansan?

1162
01:34:04,144 --> 01:34:04,895
Jiansan?

1163
01:34:07,439 --> 01:34:08,440
It's Jiansan!

1164
01:34:08,732 --> 01:34:09,358
Jiansan!

1165
01:34:10,609 --> 01:34:11,777
Uncle Li!

1166
01:34:12,152 --> 01:34:14,029
Uncle Wang!
It's good to see you.

1167
01:34:24,790 --> 01:34:25,499
Everyone,

1168
01:34:27,042 --> 01:34:28,418
today is

1169
01:34:30,671 --> 01:34:31,755
Tong Shun Xiang's last day.

1170
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:33,882
This is on the house.

1171
01:34:37,761 --> 01:34:38,887
What is this?

1172
01:34:39,096 --> 01:34:40,430
What's the point?

1173
01:34:40,472 --> 01:34:41,849
We can produce
the same flavor as you.

1174
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:47,604
Watch what you say, man.

1175
01:34:49,356 --> 01:34:50,065
Uncle.

1176
01:34:50,858 --> 01:34:51,775
Come on.

1177
01:34:51,817 --> 01:34:53,068
Let's give it a try.

1178
01:34:53,110 --> 01:34:53,527
Try this!

1179
01:34:53,569 --> 01:34:54,403
Sure.

1180
01:35:01,910 --> 01:35:02,703
How is it?

1181
01:35:02,744 --> 01:35:03,495
Is it the same taste?

1182
01:35:03,537 --> 01:35:04,538
Is it good?

1183
01:35:07,541 --> 01:35:08,667
Is it good?

1184
01:35:09,418 --> 01:35:12,504
The work of a true heir!

1185
01:35:13,297 --> 01:35:14,089
This is delicious!

1186
01:35:15,215 --> 01:35:16,592
It's the same as Coughing Liu's!

1187
01:35:16,633 --> 01:35:17,843
The very same!

1188
01:35:17,885 --> 01:35:18,594
Come on!

1189
01:35:18,635 --> 01:35:19,511
Try this!

1190
01:35:21,513 --> 01:35:22,222
Let me try it!

1191
01:35:22,264 --> 01:35:23,140
Try this!

1192
01:35:24,850 --> 01:35:25,475
Come on.

1193
01:35:26,101 --> 01:35:27,102
It smells wonderful.

1194
01:35:27,144 --> 01:35:27,936
It's authentic!

1195
01:35:27,978 --> 01:35:29,479
That's the flavor!

1196
01:35:31,690 --> 01:35:32,524
It's delicious!

1197
01:35:32,566 --> 01:35:33,358
It smells so nice.

1198
01:35:33,984 --> 01:35:34,610
It's authentic!

1199
01:35:35,152 --> 01:35:36,028
Delicious!

1200
01:35:38,155 --> 01:35:39,198
This is great!

1201
01:35:39,239 --> 01:35:40,490
Exactly the same taste.

1202
01:35:41,408 --> 01:35:42,534
Fantastic!

1203
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:44,536
It's the real thing!

1204
01:35:48,498 --> 01:35:50,792
It's great.

1205
01:35:56,340 --> 01:35:57,758
That's the real thing.

1206
01:35:58,634 --> 01:36:01,887
The kid is really becoming his father.

1207
01:36:34,253 --> 01:36:37,256
Dad, this forest is so big.

1208
01:36:37,756 --> 01:36:39,424
What is this place?

1209
01:36:39,466 --> 01:36:40,175
Is it nice?

1210
01:36:40,217 --> 01:36:41,260
It is.

1211
01:36:41,718 --> 01:36:43,929
It's fun here.

1212
01:36:43,971 --> 01:36:45,848
There are all kinds of leaves.

1213
01:36:45,889 --> 01:36:47,307
Isn't this place beautiful?

1214
01:36:47,349 --> 01:36:49,518
Is there any treasure here?

1215
01:37:11,498 --> 01:37:12,499
Wenyan.

1216
01:38:07,721 --> 01:38:08,388
Xiaoyue,

1217
01:38:12,017 --> 01:38:13,018
I want to stay here.

1218
01:38:15,395 --> 01:38:17,105
Liu's Crystal Cake can't just disappear.

1219
01:38:20,984 --> 01:38:22,402
But to get the right flavor,

1220
01:38:25,656 --> 01:38:26,865
are you going to...

1221
01:38:39,503 --> 01:38:40,420
Don't worry.

1222
01:38:43,215 --> 01:38:44,842
I'll make our own flavor.

1223
01:38:52,140 --> 01:38:53,016
Jiansan...

1224
01:38:57,396 --> 01:38:58,730
Jiansan...

1225
01:39:32,639 --> 01:39:33,348
Let's go home.

1226
01:39:33,390 --> 01:39:33,849
Sure!

1227
01:39:33,891 --> 01:39:34,892
Let's go.

1228
01:39:36,393 --> 01:39:38,395
One, two, three!

1229
01:39:40,189 --> 01:39:41,565
Off we go!

1230
01:39:41,607 --> 01:39:42,858
Let's go!
