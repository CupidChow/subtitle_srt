=The Zero Complaint Flight=

2
00:00:32,742 --> 00:00:37,461
=Episode 5=

3
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,600
I didn't ask you this morning.

4
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,920
How was it last night?

5
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:08,239
Well...

6
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:11,000
I've been thinking about
the words Li Er said last night.

7
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,599
He just wanted to do the job well now.

8
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:15,319
His goals are very clear.

9
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,640
Does that mean

10
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:23,400
that he likes hard working people?

11
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,120
This is clearly a rejection, isn't it?

12
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,239
It can't be.

13
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,239
We admired the moon together last night.

14
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,000
Everyone, tidy up your appearance.

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,599
Passengers will be aboard.

16
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:47,920
Turn around.

17
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:54,439
Welcome aboard.

18
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:58,959
Hello, welcome aboard.

19
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:02,079
Hello, welcome aboard.

20
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,000
Welcome aboard.

21
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,879
Welcome aboard.

22
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:08,039
Hello, welcome aboard.

23
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,439
Welcome aboard.

24
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:10,439
Hello, Director Zhang.

25
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:11,479
This is my statement.

26
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:13,199
I'm playing a man who just broke up.

27
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,439
My girlfriend took away

28
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:15,680
my three years' salary. I...

29
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,919
Go away.

30
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,439
Hello, Director Chen.

31
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:19,800
We have met in Hong Kong, China.

32
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,599
I'm playing a young man
who failed at starting a business

33
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:25,000
and is preparing to go home
and commit suicide.

34
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,520
- I'm using
- It's enough.

35
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,479
Stanislavski's method acting.

36
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:30,680
Look,

37
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,159
I've even brought a knife.

38
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,800
Hello, sir.

39
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,080
This isn't allowed on the plane.

40
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,439
May I keep this for you?

41
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:37,759
Thank you.

42
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:42,240
Alright, back to your seats.

43
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,479
Look at that.

44
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:45,879
Li Er is looking at you.

45
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:55,639
Ladies and gentlemen.

46
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,599
(Welcome to Yucheng Airlines.)

47
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,479
(We will serve you with all sincerity.)

48
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,599
(We will introduce the emergency exits.)

49
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:13,360
(There are a total of
eight emergency exits on this plane)

50
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:15,919
(located at the front,)

51
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:16,599
(the rear,)

52
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:17,479
(and the middle.)

53
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:22,319
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,159
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:24,919
I didn't do that on purpose.

56
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:25,800
Sorry.

57
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:31,560
- I'm sorry.
- It's one minute past seven at night.

58
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,400
Because of this slap,

59
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:36,639
this minute belongs to you and me.

60
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,599
I got slapped too!

61
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:43,560
Why don't you apologize?

62
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,319
I'm sorry.

63
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,479
I'll make a complaint

64
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:46,560
unless I get an explanation.

65
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,120
Sorry.

66
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,199
Let me think about it.

67
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:48,800
I...

68
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,319
Don't worry.

69
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,719
Oh, my God.

70
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,360
I've already had a miserable life.

71
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:59,960
Are you going to join them and bully me?

72
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,120
Are you two done?

73
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:08,039
I also have human emotions.

74
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:09,319
My girlfriend

75
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:10,680
took away my three years' salary.

76
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,879
Now you slapped me on the plane! Well...

77
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:13,960
Ah...

78
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,920
You guys even took away the knife
I could use to commit suicide.

79
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,439
Why did you insult me like that?

80
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,199
I can't take it anymore.

81
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,480
Just shut up!

82
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,759
Stop fighting!

83
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,639
Stop!

84
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,680
Shut up!

85
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,759
Stop!

86
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,519
- Stop fighting!
- Stop fighting!

87
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,040
Calm down.

88
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:44,279
Are you okay?

89
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:48,199
Stop speaking Cantonese!

90
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,240
Listen to me.

91
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,519
In order to express our apology,

92
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:54,839
we offer you a free cabin upgrade,
is that okay?

93
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,319
What upgrade. I don't accept that.

94
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:57,279
I will... I...

95
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,720
Okay.

96
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:04,480
Is it okay, Director Zhang?

97
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:07,199
Will you accept our apology, sir?

98
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,839
Fine.

99
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:22,560
Gentleman,

100
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,000
what would you like to drink?

101
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:25,839
Coke, please.

102
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:29,120
I bought my girlfriend a Coke
the first time I invited her out.

103
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,480
Coke.

104
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:33,680
Coke again.

105
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,399
I don't know when it started,

106
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:38,399
that everything has a date on it.

107
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:40,600
Even Coke expires.

108
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,720
I lost money because the Coke expired.

109
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,399
What does that mean?

110
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:50,319
What is he talking about?

111
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:51,720
Why do they start again?

112
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,079
They just won't stop.

113
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:57,959
Leave it to me.

114
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:00,120
There's nothing I can do.

115
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,639
Do you want to get hit again?

116
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:03,480
I can't understand you, either.

117
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,240
I don't need the drink.

118
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,079
Coke, thank you.

119
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,800
Wait a moment.

120
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:31,480
I'm exhausted.

121
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,560
Don't you go to Li Er today?

122
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,920
I would like to,

123
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,639
but I'm too tired.

124
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:44,600
I think Li Er falls for this.

125
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,000
What do you mean?

126
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,399
The way he looked at you today.

127
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:54,120
It was literally glowing.

128
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,519
Really?

129
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,720
Of course!

130
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:02,439
What if he only likes those who can
solve problems in work?

131
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,720
I'm not that kind of person.

132
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,600
I'm not here to solve work issues.

133
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,480
That's true.

134
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,920
Lan.

135
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,399
I'm so sleepy.

136
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,360
Open the door, please.

137
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:22,519
Thank you, Lan.

138
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,439
Li Er?

139
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,800
Are you here for me?

140
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:31,600
I have to go.

141
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,560
You guys talk.

142
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:47,000
If you are here to see me,

143
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,839
why aren't you talking?

144
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:49,879
I...

145
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:00,240
I just want to ask you a question.

146
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,240
No boyfriend.

147
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:03,759
That's not what I mean. I wanted to...

148
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:04,720
Yes, I do!

149
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,519
I wanted to ask you

150
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:10,879
how you did it back then.

151
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:13,959
Why did those two passengers stop?

152
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:21,639
Are you here just to ask this question?

153
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,959
I just think you're pretty awesome.

154
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:26,920
At that time, I was a bit at a loss.

155
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:28,639
So I want to learn from you.

156
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,039
Do you want to know the answer?

157
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,840
Agree to go on a date with me,

158
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:43,679
