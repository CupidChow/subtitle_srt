I can also be considered
a person with ambitions.

I wanted to become a pilot at first.)

How come it's not suitable?

You're tall and handsome,

10
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,920

in a pilot's uniform.

Okay, thank you.

36
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,599
Beauty.

37
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,479
Sir, how can I help you?

38
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:45,560
What time is it?

39
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,639
When do we land?

40
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:48,479
It is 2:10 PM now.

41
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:50,719
We will land in three hours.

42
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,039
I can't hear you clearly.

43
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,520
It is 2:10 PM now.

44
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,759
We will land in three hours.

45
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,000
I still can't hear you.

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,280
Can you come a bit closer?

47
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,439
I'm sorry, sir.

48
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:01,840
It is 2:10 PM now.

49
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,039
We will land in three hours.

50
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:12,360
What? I can't hear you.

51
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:30,240
What's wrong, Li? Bad mood?

52
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,199
Don't mention it.
I just ran into a masher.

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,759
A masher?

54
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,719
What happened?

55
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,840
The guy in seat 41C
asked me about the time,

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,400
and then he blew air by my ear.

57
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,879
It was really disgusting.

58
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,280
I don't know if it was on purpose.

59
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,360
He blew air by your ear?

60
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,439
That's sexual harassment.

61
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,759
Yes, but what can we do?

62
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,719
There's no evidence.

63
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,199
Forget about it.

64
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,840
It's bad if we get complaints.

65
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,919
What do you mean?

66
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,120
How can we just let it go?

67
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,719
I'll revenge you.

68
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:11,240
41C?

69
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,039
That's the guy.

70
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,000
Perfect.

71
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,080
What are you doing?

72
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,839
Don't go. Let Xiao Zhizhi handle it.

73
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,480
I'm going.

74
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,240
You...

75
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:25,480
Hello, sir.

76
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,639
May I help you with anything?

77
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:28,639
Beauty, I can't unfasten the seatbelt.

78
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:30,839
The seatbelt?

79
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,800
Hold the release device with one hand

80
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,959
and press the button with the other.
That's it.

81
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,199
Beauty, it doesn't work.

82
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:39,000
I need to pee.

83
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,720
I dare not move.

84
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,720
If I move, I will wet the seat.

85
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:43,639
Really?

86
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,560
That's tricky.

87
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,519
Let me help you.

88
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,199
Please.

89
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,639
Take your hand away
and I'll help you undo it.

90
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,759
I can't move.

91
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,920
Okay.

92
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,279
It's unlocked.

93
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,600
What are you doing?

94
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,639
You couldn't hold it?

95
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,199
Hello, this is my blanket.

96
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,240
Sorry, here you go.

97
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,879
Way to go, girl.

98
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:41,720
I was so mad.

99
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,079
That was awesome.

100
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:43,800
Right?

101
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,879
Tell you what? He was...

102
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,040
How about that? Impressive, huh?

103
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:53,879
You are still reckless.

104
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,240
That was dangerous.

105
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,360
The problem was solved anyway.

106
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,680
Besides, I'm fine.

107
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:20,079
Do you remember during the training

108
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,600
those extras played hijackers
on the plane?

109
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,399
Yan Yan warned you then,

110
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,920
and I have also told you.

111
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:29,079
If anything happens,
don't try to intervene by yourself.

112
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,720
We have Security Officers.

113
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Our duty is not to punish evil-doers.

114
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,519
I know.

115
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,800
But he was bullying Huang Li.

116
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,399
I couldn't just stand by.

117
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,759
He couldn't bully my friend.

118
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,839
Bad guy.

119
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:41,120
You know me.

120
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,279
I wouldn't let him off
without a scratch.

121
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,199
Enough about me.

122
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,720
How about you?

123
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:48,680
Have you given it some thought

124
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,279
about the pilot thing?

125
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:53,920
Watch out!

126
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,319
About that?

127
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,360
I'll think about it.

128
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:26,759
I'm not very confident about myself.

129
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:29,279
How come?

130
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,000
We can solve any problems together.

131
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:32,800
