00:00:32,646 --> 00:00:37,365
=Episode 9=

3
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,079
Awesome, Haixian!

4
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,719
Destroy the leader of a gang first.

5
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,079
You are really smart.

6
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:42,920
Yeah.

7
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,439
Today Huang Li

8
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:45,679
almost flew out.

9
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,439
Flew out?

10
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:48,119
Right.

11
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:49,240
Mr. Bait.

12
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,640
Li Er,

13
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,759
learn a thing or two.

14
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,439
How is it?

15
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:56,320
I'm amazing, right?

16
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,479
The first time you helped me,

17
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,159
you also used this method, right?

18
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:02,119
You learned it, right?

19
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,680
This is not a solution
to the problem at all.

20
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,959
But I've solved it.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,480
You didn't really try

22
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,239
to solve the passengers' problems.
You know?

23
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,640
Their problem is the digital camera.

24
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,159
The acting was too much.

25
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:18,879
Right?

26
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,400
But if this really happens,

27
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,920
it will be useless
to turn off the digital camera.

28
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:27,840
Let's go.

29
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,840
Go on.

30
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,760
You're taking it too seriously.

31
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:40,319
Of course, you have to.

32
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,959
Haven't I told you already?

33
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,280
I won't be a flight attendant.

34
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,599
Nor will I get on a plane.

35
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,400
This situation will not occur.

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,439
Then why did you come?

37
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,159
For you.

38
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,159
Do you really want me to say it now?

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,239
Do you know how many people
dream of this opportunity?

40
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,719
You are occupying this position.

41
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,519
Yet you don't cherish it.

42
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,120
Wang Haixian,

43
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:13,919
come out!

44
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:18,960
Wang Haixian,

45
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,000
you were slacking off, you know?

46
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,120
But how could this happen
on a real airplane?

47
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,639
Yan Yan, you didn't see it.

48
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:29,120
Everyone was going crazy.

49
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:30,639
A man even bled from eyes and mouth.

50
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:31,479
If it never happened,

51
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:33,439
does that mean it will never happen?

52
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:37,360
This situation is impossible to occur.

53
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,639
How can a flight attendant
solve such a problem?

54
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:40,479
Impossible.

55
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:43,639
You can't solve it,

56
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:45,879
so you give up on passengers?

57
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:50,080
Is that something
a flight attendant should say?

58
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,800
I've been emphasizing to you.

59
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,639
If you don't like

60
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,199
or accept this profession,

61
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:59,840
please leave the opportunity
to those who need it more.

62
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,879
You saw it during the interview.

63
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,199
There are many people
who aspire to this profession.

64
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,599
Because of innate insufficiency,

65
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,439
they were personally rejected by me.

66
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:10,840
Sometimes I really wonder

67
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,680
what made you win over those people.

68
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,080
Just because you're taller than them?

69
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,719
Or because your Mandarin is better?

70
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:24,800
Really?

71
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,039
Director Chen agreed to use us?

72
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:27,800
I'm not dreaming, am I?

73
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,199
Of course, I wouldn't deceive you.

74
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,360
Director Chen said

75
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,840
after seeing your performance,

76
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:34,520
he thought it was fantastic.

77
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,800
He has decided to let you two partner up

78
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,000
to act in his new play.

79
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,000
You will be the third male lead.

80
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,159
Yes!

81
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,240
You will be the fourth.

82
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:43,560
Go for it.

83
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:44,960
Go for it.

84
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,879
I'm rooting for you.

85
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,360
Really?

86
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,639
The dream has come true.

87
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:54,960
They won't do that again, right?

88
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,759
Is that why you are applauding?

89
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:00,199
What else could it be?

90
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:06,199
Me too.

91
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:13,080
Ladies

92
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,879
and gentlemen,

93
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,040
on behalf of all crew members,

94
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,959
thank you for flying
with Yucheng Airlines.

95
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,680
We look forward to seeing you next time.

96
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:24,040
(For you.)

97
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,920
Do you really want me to say it now?

98
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,720
Do you know how many people
dream of this opportunity?

99
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,199
Hello.

100
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:37,240
Director Chen.

101
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:38,959
Yes.

102
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:40,319
Those two guys are with us.

103
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,879
Come.

104
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,600
Those two...

105
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,759
Come, here.

106
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:46,040
Director Chen's call.

107
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,120
Can I say a few words to Director Chen?

108
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,040
Okay.

109
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,000
Director Chen,

110
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,120
I'm so excited.

111
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,720
Thank you.

112
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,759
I've been waiting
for this opportunity for years.

113
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:57,920
Hello, Director Chen.

114
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:59,800
I'm also from Hong Kong.

115
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,720
My family has been watching your films
since childhood.

116
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,399
(Cabin Crew Training)
Gather up.

117
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:07,600
Hurry.

118
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,879
Dawdling.

119
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:10,000
I have to eat.

120
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,199
What are you two still doing here?

121
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,360
They are about to leave.

122
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,199
You're really something.

123
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:24,079
Why act so well?

124
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:26,839
You got me scolded by the leader.

125
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,920
Do you really think
the two of us acted well?

126
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,000
You acted pretty well.

127
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:37,399
Thank you.

128
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:43,319
What? Hidden camera?

129
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:46,480
Still filming sincere characters?

130
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,560
Haixian, let's go. Time for a meal.

131
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,399
How come you two are still here?

132
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,319
The Assistant Director and the others
are at the entrance.

133
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:56,560
Haixian, do you know?

134
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,879
They've been chosen to act
in Director Chen's play.

135
00:05:59,399 --> 00:05:59,920
Really?

136
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,519
Yes, really.

137
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:01,279
Isn't that great?

138
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:02,680
You two hurry up and go act.

139
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,839
To become super stars.

140
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:05,319
Don't make trouble for us anymore.

141
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:06,720
We really can't stand it.

142
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,279
Quite good.

143
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:08,720
Just now, I...

144
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,639
Like this.

145
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:11,279
Oh, my God.

146
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:12,279
Epilepsy.

147
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,959
You scared me to death.

148
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:14,720
Foaming at the mouth.

149
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,480
This is quite interesting.

150
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,160
Very creative.

151
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,360
The roles have been replaced.

152
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,720
Director Chen said

153
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,160
there were actors chosen
by the investors.

154
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:24,040
The investors?

155
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,079
Wasn't it just decided?

156
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,800
Exactly.

157
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,560
You two have worked so hard.

158
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,879
Can things that have been decided
be changed so casually?

159
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,519
Forget it.

160
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:36,920
Anyway, it's not our first time.

161
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,279
We're used to it.

162
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,879
It's okay.

163
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,839
Is it common in your industry
to do this?

164
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,839
Go give them a lesson.

165
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:53,720
Hurry up.

166
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,240
Dilly-dallying.

167
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:55,839
Hey.

168
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:58,480
I'm talking to you.

169
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,519
Why did you replace them?

170
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:02,839
What does it have to do with you?

171
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:04,800
They cherish this opportunity so much.

172
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,600
You can just use them

173
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,199
or replace them?

174
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,079
Playing with them?

175
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,319
Miss,

176
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,040
what's the use of cherishing?

177
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,319
The investors decided it.

178
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:12,079
The investors.

179
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,079
The investors?

180
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:14,959
I'll call Director Chen now.

181
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:15,879
I'll have a word with him.

182
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:17,480
Let go.

183
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,759
- I won't.
- Let go!

184
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:20,839
I told you to make a call.

185
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:28,519
Miss,

186
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:30,639
I really can't help it.
I'm just a small fry.

187
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:31,439
Haixian.

188
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,399
Don't be impulsive.

189
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,720
He can't solve this.

190
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:36,600
Exactly.

191
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,800
I can't solve it.

192
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,240
Will you come again?

193
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,279
No.

194
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:43,279
The interview is over.

195
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,680
The interview is over?

196
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,879
What about the two of them?

197
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:47,720
How would I know about them?

198
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,800
Miss, I'm leaving now.

199
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,680
I'm in a hurry.

200
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,319
Wait a moment.

201
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,560
Is the camera with you?

202
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:03,120
Wait a moment.

203
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,439
I have something to give you.

204
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:07,959
We can see your performance

205
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,360
over these three days.

206
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,120
What nonsense, what investors?

207
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,360
Your life ahead is still long.

208
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,600
It's not the only opportunity.

209
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:17,680
This card has recorded all your
performances over these three days.

210
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,800
This is all proof of your hard work.

211
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,079
I think you two are
very talented actors.

212
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:31,439
Thank you.

213
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,799
Thanks.

214
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,840
You are also
an excellent flight attendant.

215
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:37,320
Let's go.

216
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,720
What's wrong?

217
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:51,000
Did you hear what they said?

218
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:56,600
An excellent flight attendant.

219
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:02,559
You handled this very well.

220
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,320
I suddenly feel

221
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,360
I seem to be the one who replaced them.

222
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,440
I am also wasting an opportunity
that many people dream of.

223
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:26,960
