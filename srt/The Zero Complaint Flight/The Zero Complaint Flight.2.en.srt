3
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,280
Haixian.

4
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,359
Wait for me.

5
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,320
I'll work here in the future.

6
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,399
I'll see Li Er soon.

7
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:58,960
Hello.

8
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,679
Are you also training here?

9
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:02,920
Is it on the second floor?

10
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,959
Is recruiting flight attendants
so casual now?

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,799
Where is Li Er?

12
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,359
Well,

13
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:16,719
Haixian.

14
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:18,719
Are you being too impulsive?

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,879
Do you know
what a flight attendant does?

16
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:22,719
I'm not here to be a flight attendant.

17
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:23,920
Once he is mine, I'll leave.

18
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:27,239
He hasn't even said a word to you.

19
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:29,120
How can you be sure he's your type?

20
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:29,879
I'm not sure.

21
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:30,640
So I have to try.

22
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,200
The 2nd floor?

23
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,200
Li Er.

24
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:35,186
(Yucheng Airlines)

25
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,040
Hi.

26
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,159
Where is Li Er?

27
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,400
Are you sure it's here?

28
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,640
I think so.

29
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:55,120
It should be.

30
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,040
Are you also in Group One?

31
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,000
Yo, what's up? I'm Xiao Zhizhi.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,079
Don't block my way.

33
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,519
Hello.

34
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:05,760
My name is Lan Rui.

35
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,840
Hello, beauty.

36
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm Xiao Zhizhi.

37
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,240
What's up? I am Xiao...

38
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,879
Huang Li. No need for the gestures.

39
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,599
Everyone, come over here.

40
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,439
Hello, everyone.

41
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,159
I am the Chief Attendant, Yan Yan.

42
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,560
It's your luck to be assigned
to my team this time.

43
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:27,759
As the record holder of zero complaints
at Yucheng Airlines,

44
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,919
my expectations for you are the same.

45
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:32,639
I hope you can become flight attendants
with zero complaints.

46
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,919
After the three-month training period,

47
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:37,240
you will officially join
Yucheng Airlines.

48
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,479
I hope you can always remember

49
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:41,879
your mission in the blue sky.

50
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,439
- Huang Li, right?
- Yes.

51
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:44,199
Sign your name.

52
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:44,800
Okay.

53
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,240
Are you stunned?

54
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,800
There are class divisions.

55
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,960
Perhaps Li Er is
at another training base.

56
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,439
Who would have thought about that?

57
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:55,840
What should we do now?

58
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,159
Report.

59
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:01,800
Ms. Yan,

60
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,199
Mr. Chen asked me to join Group One.

61
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:03,719
I see.

62
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:04,599
Join them.

63
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,319
Wang Haixian.

64
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:37,159
Turn right.

65
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:37,879
Oh.

66
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,240
Ouch, shall we go?

67
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:45,800
Not going?

68
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,919
Go, go, go.

69
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,360
Today,

70
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,680
we have given everyone a basic tour
of our base infrastructure.

71
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,800
This is the simulator cabin.

72
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:55,319
Even though it's only training,

73
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,479
everything will proceed
according to the real flight procedures

74
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:00,719
to ensure that our future work
is error-free.

75
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,919
Do you understand?

76
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,720
Wang Haixian.

77
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,399
Wang Haixian.

78
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:27,959
You were distracted
while I was talking today.

79
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,600
Each of you must remember,

80
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,839
flight attendant is
a very serious profession.

81
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:36,879
Our work ability is related
to each passenger's experience

82
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:38,319
and even their personal safety.

83
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,519
No carelessness or negligence
is allowed.

84
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:42,240
Now that you are here,

85
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:43,519
you'd better stay focused.

86
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,560
Take a short break
and change into the uniforms.

87
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,399
We'll start today's
training sessions soon.

88
00:04:49,412 --> 00:04:52,192
(Flight Training)

89
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:55,480
This uniform looks pretty nice.

90
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,360
Not bad.

91
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,680
Looks good.

92
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:02,639
Really?

93
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,759
Li Er.

94
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,360
Hello, my name is Wang Haixian.

95
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,319
Do you have a girlfriend?

96
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:33,360
Lan Rui.

97
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:35,079
What are you doing?

98
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,759
Show some restraint, will you?

99
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,279
I came here just for him,

100
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:40,720
not to be a flight attendant.

101
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,279
Well,

102
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:45,079
at least pretend for a couple of days.

103
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:47,399
If you rush up like that,
he won't respond.

104
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:51,759
That makes sense.

105
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,439
Two days.

106
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,560
Just for two days.

107
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,199
Using two days to cultivate feelings.

108
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:58,360
It won't be that easy.

109
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,040
With this intensity of training,

110
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,959
it'd be great
if you could hold on a day.

111
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:07,240
Who do you think I am?

112
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,480
Lan Rui,

113
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,639
I can't stand
this practical training at all.

114
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:23,959
You know it's not simple, don't you?

115
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,959
It hurts so much.

116
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,480
The first day.

117
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:33,639
I'm leaving.

118
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:34,480
I can't take it.

119
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,759
Can't go on pretending.

120
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,720
Where are you going?

121
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,279
To win over Li Er.

122
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:41,319
Now.

123
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:43,399
How?

124
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,040
Like this.

125
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,560
I can't take it anymore.

126
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,279
I don't want to wear high heels anymore.

127
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,639
Oh my.

128
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:04,240
Who is it?

129
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:10,720
May I come in?

130
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,040
Wang Haixian?

131
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:13,199
Of course, you can.

132
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:14,279
Yo, what's up?

133
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:15,959
Didn't greet you properly
during the day.

134
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,319
I am Xiao Zhizhi.

135
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,120
Finished washing up?

136
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,560
How did you get in?

137
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,920
Through the door.

138
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:57,439
Where is Xiao Zhizhi?

139
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:09,560
I have a question for you.

140
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,519
- Go ahead.
- I've been noticing you.

141
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,399
Can we date?

142
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:18,879
I think you're very handsome.

143
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:21,319
Can you be my boyfriend?

144
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,839
I've really liked you for a long time.

145
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,920
I came here because of you.

146
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:34,279
Wang Haixian,

147
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,519
