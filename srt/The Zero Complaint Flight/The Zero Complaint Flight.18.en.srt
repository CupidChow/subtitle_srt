=Episode 18=

3
00:00:37,527 --> 00:00:39,240
It hurts too much.

4
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,640
Where is the justice?

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,880
What kind of attitude is that?

6
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,399
Come on.

7
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,399
Well, I can't get up.

8
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,560
Sit down.

9
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,200
Slow down.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,840
You go back first.

11
00:00:58,039 --> 00:00:59,439
Please calm down.

12
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:00,799
Our entire cabin crew

13
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:03,000
will take responsibility
for everything we've said.

14
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,359
We have surveillance videos
inside the cabin.

15
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:07,280
We'll know what exactly happened

16
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:08,920
once we check them.

17
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:10,480
Surveillance?

18
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,920
Then check it thoroughly.

19
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,079
Now she's like this.

20
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,519
You have to take responsibility.

21
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:17,799
Excuse me, passenger comment card.

22
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:19,560
Passenger comment card.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Passenger comment card.

24
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,120
How is this matter going to be resolved?

25
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,760
I'm really sorry.

26
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:25,920
Sir, Madam,

27
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,400
we've discussed a solution.

28
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,799
I wonder if it is satisfactory.

29
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:32,560
I will make a request
to the Chief Attendant,

30
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,439
asking her to discuss with the captain.

31
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,200
We can alter the flight path

32
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,439
and land at the nearest airport.

33
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,799
Then let's head to the hospital

34
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:39,879
to check on the injury.

35
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:41,159
It'll be treated at once, okay?

36
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:46,359
Dear passengers,

37
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:47,239
we are truly sorry.

38
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:48,680
An emergency situation has arisen.

39
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,000
This lady believes
her injury is very serious

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,840
and she requires immediate treatment.

41
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:54,879
Therefore, we've delayed
everyone's time.

42
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:56,640
We'll need to make an emergency landing.

43
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,040
The subsequent itinerary
will need to be rescheduled.

44
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,840
I'm very sorry.

45
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,560
Sorry.

46
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,159
That won't do.

47
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,760
I have urgent matters to attend to.

48
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,840
How can it be changed

49
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,000
at will?

50
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,920
They said that no one touched you.

51
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,879
Making such a fuss is too much.

52
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,479
- Yeah.
- Exactly.

53
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,159
They didn't touch your foot.

54
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,560
See, it's delaying everyone's time.

55
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,280
I have completed the comment card.

56
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,000
I'll vouch for you.

57
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:23,080
- Thank you.
- You are welcome.

58
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:24,240
Thank you.

59
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,479
We will testify for you.

60
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,520
Thank you.

61
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,319
Thank you.

62
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:29,120
Thank you.

63
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,560
Zhizhi, distribute the cards.

64
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,960
We'll all vouch for you.

65
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,759
I'll vouch for you.

66
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:34,080
Thank you.

67
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:42,560
In the blink of an eye,

68
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,800
Ms. Yan took out a stack
of passenger comment cards.

69
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,879
With a swoosh, they were handed to me.

70
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:50,280
At that time, she said to me
like a heroine,

71
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,240
"Wang Haixian,

72
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,120
you must believe

73
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,080
that justice belongs
to the vast majority of people."

74
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:56,400
Right.

75
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,680
You didn't see that man's face today.

76
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,000
It showed me what is called
the color of pig liver.

77
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:03,159
I saw Yan Yan has recorded

78
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:05,199
them and the incident in the work diary.

79
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:07,759
So I guess from now on,
they will be our flight's

80
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:09,120
key people of attention, right?

81
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,120
Does that mean his complaints
won't count anymore?

82
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:13,560
Let me tell you.

83
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,240
The goal of 100-hour flight without
complaints is to remind us to work hard.

84
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,080
It's not a shackle that binds us.

85
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,639
Well, Wang Haixian,

86
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:20,879
you are also amazing.

87
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,800
Your ability to react
on the spot is so strong.

88
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,159
Yan Yan,

89
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,400
you're so awesome.

90
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:27,919
Originally, one of us
was going to be eliminated.

91
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,439
After you spoke with them,

92
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,879
we all stayed.

93
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,520
What did you say to the leaders?

94
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:39,400
What did I say?

95
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,159
Yeah, Yan Yan,

96
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,800
I'm also curious about it.

97
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,000
Well, I didn't say much.

98
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,800
Maybe it's because I've been
with the company for a long time.

99
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,360
The leaders might take
my opinions into consideration.

100
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,639
I see.

101
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:53,520
Okay.

102
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,879
Let's get started.

103
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,680
Congratulations on our first flight
with zero complaint.

104
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,400
Help me pick it up.

105
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,360
Haixian.

106
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,159
Help me pick it up.

107
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:04,919
Let me help you.

108
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,439
It's swollen.

109
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,960
There's an auntie who's very kind.

110
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,680
She asked, "Girl,
what has happened to your forehead?"

111
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,199
Forehead.

112
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:14,479
I felt that...

113
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,639
Why don't you join everyone?

114
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,800
Well,

115
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,680
I'm just thinking about something.

116
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,000
I find it quite magical.

117
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,759
What is it?

118
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:28,279
I actually became a flight attendant.

119
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:30,920
And I really took a flight around
in the sky.

120
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,879
I used to drift
through university life in a daze.

121
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,959
Now, I can also be considered
a person with ambitions.

122
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,759
What about you?

123
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:48,120
You just wanted
to be a flight attendant?

124
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,480
Pretty much.

125
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,800
Pretty much means...

126
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,759
Pretty much just means pretty much.

127
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,800
Oh, you are Mr. Pretty Much.

128
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,759
Your "pretty much" is inborn.

129
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,279
Let me tell you something.

130
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,480
Wang Haixian,

131
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:33,959
let's start dating.

132
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:45,760
♪Your kiss, the oxygen I live on♪

133
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:52,116
♪No need to test,
I can see it in your eyes♪

134
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,279
Why did you bump into me?

135
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,560
Isn't it supposed to be a kiss?

136
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,560
Everyone else kisses.

137
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:03,120
Give me another chance.

138
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:10,164
♪Never losing you♪

139
00:06:10,164 --> 00:06:12,758
♪You've always been by my side♪

140
00:06:12,848 --> 00:06:19,316
♪No matter how long the road ahead,

141
00:06:19,316 --> 00:06:24,565
♪I will promise you♪

142
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,160
Noting down the details?

143
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,160
You're here.

144
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,560
You've done your homework so thoroughly.

145
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,079
Where are you planning
to take me on our first date?

146
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:49,600
I haven't decided yet.

147
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:51,560
Haven't decided yet?

148
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:57,199
Let's go to the place
where we first met.

149
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,839
We first met?

150
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,279
Where?

151
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,600
Here?

152
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,879
Right.

153
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:05,560
The place where we first met.

154
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,920
You really don't remember.

155
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,519
I told you that we were alumni.

156
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:12,279
You are the person who fell
on the ground holding an IV bottle?

157
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:16,879
Yes, that was me.

158
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,360
Oh, right by the infirmary door.

159
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,519
You remember, huh?

160
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:22,160
So as you were passing by, you...

161
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,079
You were very aloof.

162
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:23,959
You didn't help me.

163
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,920
Who would have dared
to approach back then?

164
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,399
You looked like you were mentally ill.

165
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:31,720
Mentally ill?

166
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:37,639
So, it was during your school days

167
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:41,480
that you decided
to be a flight attendant?

168
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,759
No.

169
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,439
Actually,
I wanted to become a pilot at first.

170
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,519
Pilot?

171
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,319
So suitable.

172
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,480
Why didn't you go for it?

173
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:55,439
I felt I wasn't quite suitable.

174
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:56,879
How come?

175
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,040
You're tall and handsome,

176
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,240
and you look perfect
in a pilot's uniform.

177
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,079
Don't flatter me.

178
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm not.

179
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,199
I've never seen such a handsome captain.

180
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,240
(Hello, I'm Manchurian Tiger.)

181
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,800
(Hello, I am Wan.)

182
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,399
(Thanks for your support.)

183
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:08,920
- What? Can I have a look?
- Here.

184
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,759
(The rural idol drama starring we two,)

185
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,000
(The Story of My Mom and Me,)

186
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,720
(will be available
