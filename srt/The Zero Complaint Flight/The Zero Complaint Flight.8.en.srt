3
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,679
How many ex-girlfriends do you have?

4
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:48,240
Why do you ask?

5
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:50,600
Just asking.

6
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,799
We've been playing all afternoon.

7
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:53,600
I'm just trying to know about you.

8
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,000
Isn't it okay?

9
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:56,439
None.

10
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:00,039
How many have you dated?

11
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,480
I've never dated.

12
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,079
You haven't?

13
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,439
Do you like...?

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,200
I like girls.

15
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:17,120
That's good.

16
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:19,359
Being so handsome,

17
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:21,079
why don't you date?

18
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:21,719
You're so handsome.

19
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:23,239
Isn't that a waste of resources?

20
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:26,280
You have dated many?

21
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,359
I've always wanted to date,

22
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,359
but it's never worked out.

23
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:34,400
I find it so strange.

24
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,680
From childhood to now,

25
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,079
I always ended up being friends
with those who liked me.

26
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:39,400
I can't solve it.

27
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:55,560
Have you ever kissed?

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,920
Have you?

29
00:01:58,599 --> 00:01:59,359
No.

30
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,040
Well, when they

31
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,000
kiss,

32
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:04,879
do they ever bump into teeth or noses?

33
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,799
With your nose so high,

34
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,240
would you bump it when kissing?

35
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,439
I don't know.

36
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:21,560
Why don't we try?

37
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,120
Let's kiss.

38
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,159
Neither of us has kissed.

39
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:27,919
It's fair for us.

40
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:29,520
Let's try and satisfy my curiosity.

41
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,879
I just want to know

42
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,400
if the noses would bump.

43
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,319
Let's kiss.

44
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,120
I'll give it a try.

45
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,360
Like in an idol drama.

46
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,800
Buddy,

47
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:01,360
you...

48
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:03,199
Wait, the dolls.

49
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:04,719
You spent this afternoon on them.

50
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:08,479
(Cabin Crew Training)

51
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,520
Come on.

52
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,639
Hurry up.

53
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:13,479
Quick.

54
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:14,319
Come on, let's go.

55
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,719
Make sure to perform well today.

56
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:16,639
Perform well.

57
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:18,039
In the final interview,

58
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:19,599
strive to be chosen by the director.

59
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,240
Okay, come on, let's go.

60
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,000
Come on.

61
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,319
Time to work.

62
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:26,159
So annoying.

63
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:36,520
Hi.

64
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:37,879
Hi.

65
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:51,680
Your relationship improved
so much yesterday?

66
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,520
Right.

67
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,039
What did you do yesterday?

68
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,319
Had a heart-to-heart
under the moonlight.

69
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,759
Improved so fast?

70
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,879
Then you'll be leaving soon, won't you?

71
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:07,639
Exactly.

72
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,000
Bro, stop filming for now.

73
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,240
The previous performance was not okay?

74
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:23,800
Right.

75
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,439
Didn't we move the flight attendant?

76
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:25,959
No,

77
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:26,959
it's not that.

78
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:27,879
In Director Feng's movie,

79
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:31,399
the male antagonist has suddenly
been switched into a female one, so I...

80
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:33,000
How did it change into a female one?

81
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,199
I can also play a female role.

82
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,199
I can do it too.

83
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:38,879
It's okay. Perform well today.

84
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:39,759
Perform well.

85
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,000
Director Chen's movie

86
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,040
is about to start filming.

87
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,720
We need a third male lead
and a fourth one.

88
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,680
I've already sent your CVs over.

89
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,439
Director Chen said

90
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:49,240
tonight he would

91
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,800
give you the answers, alright?

92
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:51,839
That's good.

93
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,399
Really? I like Director Chen.

94
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:55,759
Director Chen is the one
who directed "Fei, Please Sit", right?

95
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,240
Yes. Do you like him?

96
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,199
He's my fellow townsman.

97
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,519
Bro, don't always tell us to be happy.

98
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:03,199
We've been with you
for over half a year.

99
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,959
You haven't made it even once.

100
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:06,519
You've got to put some effort into it.

101
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:07,079
Oh, right.

102
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:08,360
You told me to practice Mandarin.

103
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,399
I did it. My Mandarin...

104
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,759
Do it or not?

105
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,560
Yes.

106
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,199
Go back.

107
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:17,439
Everyone, listen up.

108
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,560
Keep it up.

109
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,000
Are your assignments ready?

110
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,600
Yes.

111
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,800
The sick passengers.

112
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,800
Everyone, keep it up.

113
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,120
Keep it up.

114
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:26,240
We can do it.

115
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:39,040
Who knows what might happen today?

116
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:42,000
What should we do?

117
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,040
Rest assured.

118
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,000
I've already figured out
their weaknesses.

119
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,120
Leave it to me.

120
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,040
You must trust her.

121
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,639
She loves to seek shortcuts the most.

122
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:53,519
That's true, Miss.

123
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,079
Flight attendant.

124
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:03,399
- Flight attendant.
- Coming.

125
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,279
Flight attendant.

126
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,959
Flight attendant.

127
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:08,759
Sir, what's the matter?

128
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,800
Stomachache.

129
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,600
Sir, your stomach is up here.

130
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,600
It's up here, Sir.

131
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,319
Is that so?

132
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,160
One moment, please.

133
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,279
I'll get you some medicine.

134
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:19,720
My husband is having an asthma attack.

135
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,079
Sir, are you okay?

136
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:21,959
Flight attendant.

137
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,120
There's poison in the cola.

138
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,759
- Flight attendant.
- I want to vomit.

139
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,720
Hurry, I'm going into labor.

140
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:31,000
Look over there.

141
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:44,360
Let me do it.

142
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,319
To protect everyone's privacy,

143
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,519
please stop filming.

144
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,319
Thank you for your cooperation.

145
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:06,480
Beauty.

146
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,000
Beauty, wait for me.

147
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,199
Beauty.

148
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,560
Give the digital camera

149
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,439
back to me, please

150
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:12,360
I won't.

151
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:13,920
Give it back to me.

152
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,079
- Please.
- I won't.

153
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:16,160
