00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:37,385
=Episode 6=

3
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,320
Do you often come here?

4
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:51,359
It's my first time here.

5
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:53,600
This is the only place open now.

6
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,679
I seldom drink alcohol.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,520
Hello, Xian.

8
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,880
This one is on the house.

9
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,200
This place is really nice.

10
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,359
Not only does it close late,

11
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:06,079
but the owner is also very hospitable.

12
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:07,159
They offer free drinks.

13
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,480
Thank you.

14
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,719
Xian.

15
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:12,760
Nice to see you again.

16
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,439
Is this your boyfriend?

17
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:15,760
He's handsome.

18
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,719
Introduce him to me.

19
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,319
I'm going to the restroom.

20
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,640
It's over there.

21
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,840
I'll wait for you.

22
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,760
What did you call me?

23
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,760
Xian?

24
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,599
How can I find a boyfriend
with you around?

25
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:32,640
Do you have discernment?

26
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,840
What's the problem with you?

27
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,519
Go away.

28
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:41,000
Oh, my God.

29
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,159
That's good.

30
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:51,920
Another one, Wu.

31
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,200
Boyfriend is more important.

32
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:55,599
She falls in love now.

33
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,879
They went out on a date,

34
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:00,439
and didn't even leave us the keys.

35
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:01,719
And they don't answer the phone.

36
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,760
The time I'm spending outside now

37
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,480
is longer than the time I spent inside.

38
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,840
Did your friend leave?

39
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,080
He's not my friend.

40
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,719
This place is so dark.

41
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:21,919
He mistook me for another one.

42
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:25,879
Now can you tell me

43
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:28,280
how did you manage it earlier today?

44
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:34,599
(How can this guy be so insensitive?)

45
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,879
Is this alcohol?

46
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,639
It tastes so bitter.

47
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:44,599
Excuse me, I...

48
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:46,400
I thought this was a cup of tea.

49
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,400
Can I get a cup of water?

50
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,319
Thank you.

51
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,000
This is so bitter.

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,479
I suppose you don't drink alcohol?

53
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,080
Yes... No, I don't.

54
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,000
What are you two doing?

55
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,960
We have something to discuss.

56
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,199
Why don't you go back to sleep?

57
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,159
Oh, no.

58
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,000
What should we do?

59
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,800
It will be fine.

60
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,039
It's not very late now.

61
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:22,080
It's not a matter of time.

62
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,759
Didn't Demon Yan say no drinking
during the training period?

63
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,639
Didn't you spit it out?

64
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:27,599
I...

65
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:30,319
Where did you two go?

66
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,159
We went to drink...

67
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,039
some coffee.

68
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,960
Drinking coffee at this time?

69
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,280
Don't you want to sleep tonight?

70
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:42,919
Wang Haixian,

71
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,280
you should be clear
about your recent behaviors.

72
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,960
If you want to be a flight attendant,

73
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,639
you'd better focus on your work.

74
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:50,439
I can assure you now,

75
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,919
if you keep doing like this,

76
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:53,719
you won't pass the three-month training.

77
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,080
About you hitting the extra...

78
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,479
I haven't talked with you about it.

79
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:59,599
Have you thought about it?

80
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,479
What? Talk to me.

81
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:05,319
Ms. Yan,

82
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:06,199
she's got a cold.

83
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:07,639
Her throat doesn't feel well.

84
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:12,960
That's because you hung out at midnight!

85
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,199
There's cabin service training tomorrow.

86
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,480
What can you do like this?

87
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,959
Hurry! Go back to sleep.

88
00:04:25,595 --> 00:04:28,040
(Cabin Crew Training)

89
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,120
Unfortunately,

90
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:31,120
Director Zhang has chosen

91
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,399
the actor for his film yesterday.

92
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,560
But don't be frustrated.

93
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:40,759
Director Feng will start a new film.

94
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:43,279
It's a Gangster Film.

95
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,160
Gangster Film.

96
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,279
We need an important antagonist.

97
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,000
Today I will still use a digital camera

98
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,360
to record everyone's performance.

99
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,920
I'll send it to him tonight.

100
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,959
Everyone acted very well yesterday.

101
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,319
Especially...

102
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,160
Hu?

103
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,480
H-H-Here!

104
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,160
And...

105
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,240
Wan.

106
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,040
You two acted extraordinarily well.

107
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,439
Do your best today.

108
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,040
- Will you?
- Yes!

109
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,560
Let's go.

110
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,720
Gather over there.

111
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,240
It's a Gangster Film.

112
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,800
- I can do it.
- Okay.

113
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:22,160
- Hello.
- Hello.

114
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,040
May I ask you for a favor?

115
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,920
What is it?

116
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:27,959
I want to borrow something from you.

117
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:30,000
Sure.

118
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What do you want?

119
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:43,399
♪Today is♪

120
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,319
- Haixian.
- ♪a good day♪

121
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:46,199
Stop singing.

122
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,000
Ms. Yan will come and scold you again.

123
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:02,279
You haven't told me yet.

124
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,319
How did you solve passengers' conflicts?

125
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,879
Want to know the answer?

126
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:09,360
Pay close attention today.

127
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,360
I'll teach you.

128
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:19,199
Ladies

129
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,079
and gentlemen.

130
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:22,600
We're about to reach cruising altitude.

131
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,639
(We will dim the cabin lights shortly.)

132
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:25,800
(If you need anything,)

133
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,199
(please feel free to contact us.)

134
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:27,920
(Thank you.)

135
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:34,279
Cabin service.

136
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,120
Please mind the cart.

137
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,040
Help!

138
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,240
Someone stole my wallet!

139
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,439
He stole my wallet.

140
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:40,439
I didn't.

141
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:41,040
You're lying!

142
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,079
Please calm down.

143
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:42,759
Let's talk.

144
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:43,959
I was sleeping just now.

145
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:45,319
My wallet was gone when I woke up.

146
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:46,279
He must have stolen it.

147
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:46,800
Nonsense!

148
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,480
How about this?

149
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,879
Could you please show us

150
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:49,920
what's in your bag?

151
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,639
No.

152
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:52,439
I don't want to show you.

153
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,360
If you insist,

154
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,040
- Guilty!
- we will

155
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,879
call the police after landing.

156
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,040
He harassed me.

157
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:00,720
He harassed me.

158
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,839
You are such a bad guy!

159
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:02,680
I am an old lady.

160
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,279
Madam.

161
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:04,079
Please calm down.

162
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:05,000
Madam.

163
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,079
Please calm down first.

164
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:07,360
What happened, madam?

165
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:13,279
Quiet!

166
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:15,839
Please stay calm.

167
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:16,639
Stay calm!

168
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,519
Calm down.

169
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:19,199
Nobody moves!

170
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,800
I have planted a bomb on the plane.

171
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,279
Ten years.

172
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:37,319
I have prepared ten years for today.

173
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,079
It's been ten years.

174
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,480
No one can stop me today.

175
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,839
Today, I will go down with all of you.

176
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,439
Nobody moves!

177
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,040
Nobody moves!

178
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,680
Or I'll detonate the bomb!

179
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,240
Did I give you the signal?

180
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,720
Everyone, stay still.

181
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:03,720
Don't move.

182
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,560
Hand over your valuables.

183
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:08,839
Or we will detonate the bomb!

184
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,879
Don't play tricks. Move back.

185
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:12,879
Otherwise, you'll all die.

186
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,519
Give it to him.

187
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:15,800
Please don't hurt us.

188
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,079
Go over there.

189
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,000
I am talking to you.

190
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,199
Are you deaf?

191
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,639
Don't you hear my words?

192
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,279
