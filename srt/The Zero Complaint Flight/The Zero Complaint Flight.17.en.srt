=Episode 17=

3
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,000
Yan Yan went to talk
with the company's leaders.

4
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:46,240
Things may take a turn for the better.

5
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,240
There's really no need for this.

6
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,240
Well, I applied
for the flight attendant position

7
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,039
just to woo you.

8
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,159
So...

9
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,399
So it's not a pity at all.

10
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,480
Really?

11
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,560
Really.

12
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:15,599
I'm someone who loses interest
in things very quickly.

13
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:16,640
Everyone knows that.

14
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:19,719
It's not a pity
just to come and have fun.

15
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,079
Then why are you crying?

16
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,719
I just don't want anyone to lose

17
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:39,159
the opportunity to be a flight attendant
because of me.

18
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:41,200
I was superfluous anyway.

19
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,959
You're a fool.

20
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:46,319
If we don't become flight attendants,

21
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:47,920
it means being ranked last.

22
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,120
It has nothing to do with you.

23
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,480
We've been through so much together.

24
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,799
I can tell you really

25
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,239
like being a flight attendant.

26
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:01,040
But I started this
just to woo a handsome guy.

27
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,599
This has nothing to do
with your initial intention.

28
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:11,520
I have always looked forward
to meeting a group of people

29
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,199
who are like family.

30
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:15,599
You are that group.

31
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,199
Now this mistake was made.

32
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:18,319
I don't want there

33
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,400
to be a rift between us because of me.

34
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,680
I really don't want it this way.

35
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,080
Stop crying, Haixian.

36
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,439
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,319
I really didn't want it.

38
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,280
What are you discussing?

39
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,199
With the door open.

40
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:36,960
Yan Yan.

41
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:38,000
Yan Yan.

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,960
Yan Yan is here.

43
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:40,599
Yan Yan.

44
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,360
I've decided.

45
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:44,120
Just eliminate me.

46
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:47,759
I even laughed during my interview.

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,960
You're aware of that?

48
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:51,199
Please eliminate me.

49
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,159
When I was interviewing,

50
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,639
I even bit my tongue speaking English.

51
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,039
Yan Yan, although I didn't make
any major mistakes,

52
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:02,439
I think Haixian did even better than me.

53
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:06,280
Alright.

54
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,639
I have some good news for you.

55
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,599
The company agrees to let
the five of you continue to fly.

56
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,360
- Really?
- Really?

57
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,800
- Really?
- Yes.

58
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,080
Oh my, you are still crying.

59
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,159
Why didn't you say it earlier?

60
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,680
You didn't give me a chance to say it.

61
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,120
But

62
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,280
there's one condition.

63
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,159
The five of you must
complete 100 hours of flight

64
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,840
without any complaints together.

65
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,280
Within these 100 hours,

66
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,479
if there's even one complaint received,

67
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:38,280
one of you will still be eliminated.

68
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,879
Do you accept this condition?

69
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:41,680
- Yes.
- Yes.

70
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,719
- No problem.
- Yes.

71
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,439
Thank you, Yan Yan.

72
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:46,599
Do your best, okay?

73
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:47,439
Thank you, Yan Yan.

74
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:49,159
Silly, you are crying so hard.

75
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,520

It's killing me.

Such a heavy cart
has hit my wife's foot.

111
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,240
It must be fractured.

112
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,480
Xiao Zhizhi, go back.

113
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,639
I'll handle it with Haixian.

114
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,680
Go get the first-aid kit.

115
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,519
Bring the red gift box

116
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:34,879
from the first-class cabinet.

117
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:37,920
Sir and Madam,

118
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,560
hello.

119
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,279
I am the Chief Attendant on this flight.

120
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:42,759
Sorry for the discomfort
during the journey.

121
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,959
Is there anything I can help you?

122
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,839
It hurts too much.

123
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,160
It might be a fracture.

124
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,240
We'll help you with it.

125
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,600
Wait a moment. I'll get the kit.

126
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,120
That flight attendant

127
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:56,839
pushed such a heavy cart
and hit my wife's foot.

128
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:58,079
This is definitely a fracture.

129
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:59,480
You have to compensate.

130
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:00,959
Don't worry.

131
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,079
Let's treat the wound first.

132
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:03,199
Let's have a look. Haixian.

133
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,160
I'm sorry.

134
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,839
The kit is here.

135
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:06,040
Let me help you with that.

136
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,160
What are you doing?

137
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,079
Madam,

138
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:10,240
please don't get upset.

139
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,720
We are all trained
in professional first aid.

140
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,360
We will give you some treatment.

141
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,160
Now,

142
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,319
we will give you ice
and immobilization treatment

143
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:19,199
to prevent your injury
from getting worse, okay?

144
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:19,920
Don't touch me.

145
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,360
Alright, I won't. Don't worry.

146
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,519
You make it sound nice.

147
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:24,720
I don't believe a word you say.

148
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,360
What happened?

149
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,319
Did someone get hit?

150
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,720
I didn't see anyone get hit.

151
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,920
It couldn't happen.

152
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,399
Sir,

153
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,480
don't panic.

154
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,319
If anything happens to my wife

155
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:36,439
or there are any sequelae,

156
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,120
you must be responsible.

157
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,160
Yes, we will.

158
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:38,920
Sir, look.

159
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,920
Don't get angry first.

160
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,920
This tea gift box

161
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,360
is a present for you.

162
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,920
We hope you can accept our apologies.

163
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,360
Please accept it.

164
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:47,240
Look, everyone.

165
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:49,240
Is this compensation?

166
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,959
This is compensation?

167
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,759
You're just fobbing off a beggar.

168
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:55,360
Let me tell you.

169
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,319
Your company must take responsibility

170
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,800
and compensate us for medical expenses
and lost wages.

171
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,720
Otherwise, I won't let this go
with you guys.

172
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,120
Let's treat the wound first.

173
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,920
Sir,

174
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,600
if have time to talk such nonsense,

175
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,319
may I help you treat it first?

176
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,279
- Don't touch her.
- Don't touch me.

177
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:09,160
Or I'll hit you.

178
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,279
Sir, please don't get agitated.

179
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:11,839
Don't get agitated.

180
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:12,759
Security Officer.

181
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:13,439
Sir,

182
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:15,120
it's illegal to assault cabin crew.

183
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,160
Please calm down.

184
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:17,240
What's the matter?

185
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:18,600
What's the matter?

186
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,480
This gentleman's slap woke me up.

187
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,240
Zhizhi and I were moving
the dinner cart along the middle aisle.

188
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,199
We didn't bump into anyone.

189
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,800
Wouldn't I feel it if we did?

190
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,600
Unless...

191
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,560
Unless what?

192
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,800
You mean we are faking an injury?

193
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,480
No.

194
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,800
Let me tell you guys.

195
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:32,920
You don't want to compensate,

196
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,040
so you found such an excuse.

197
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,120
I'm telling you.

198
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,199
I will never give up.

199
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,959
It hurts too much.

200
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:43,120
They are bullying me. You see that?

201
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,920
How can they be like that?

202
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,600
I gave her medicine.

203
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,120
She even kicked me, look.

204
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,879
Are you okay?

205
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,560
When facing
such unreasonable passengers,

206
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,959
it would be easier
for the Security Officer to handle.

207
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:55,839
If we are there,

208
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:57,560
it will only make them
more unscrupulous.

209
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,399
You know?

210
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,600
It's my first flight
and I've encountered such an incident.

211
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,160
How am I supposed to fly after this?

212
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,759
And there's the goal
of zero complaint for 100 hours.

213
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,759
It's not realistic at all.

214
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,199
I'm pissed off.

215
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,959
This person really is...

216
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:15,560
Hand these out to the other passengers.

217
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:19,199
Passenger comment card?

218
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,839
Right.

219
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,519
Will this be of any use?

220
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:24,800
You saw the passengers' reactions
just now.

221
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,959
They are very averse to those
who make troubles.

222
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,319
Moreover, the positive reviews
of every passenger you have served

223
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,360
with dedication are more effective than
the malicious slanders.
