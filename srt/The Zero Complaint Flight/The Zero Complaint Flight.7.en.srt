3
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:38,280
Stop!

4
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,520
Wang Haixian!

5
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:40,359
Stop it!

6
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,799
You kicked me.

7
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,640
That hurts!

8
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:50,079
Director He,

9
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,840
it was our fault today.

10
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,840
I apologize on behalf of the crew.

11
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,520
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:56,320
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:57,960
Wang Haixian.

14
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,280
Come here.

15
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:05,599
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,359
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:15,480
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:22,959
It was my fault today.

19
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:24,239
The main reason was

20
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:27,079
that you two acted too real.

21
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:28,799
I believed it all at once.

22
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:29,480
I panicked.

23
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,159
I was so scared.

24
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:31,959
Really?

25
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,680
Isn't that normal?

26
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,560
Were you taken in by our acting?

27
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,359
Yes.

28
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:40,519
I was immediately taken in by you two.

29
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:41,959
I was scared right away.

30
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:43,560
It was an instinct move. I'm sorry.

31
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,000
Did you feel that when I choked you,

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,439
the move was extraordinarily cool?

33
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:46,959
Yes!

34
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:47,959
I designed it before.

35
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:49,239
And I was holding that guy.

36
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:50,280
Did you see that?

37
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,359
Yes!

38
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:52,319
Was it professional?

39
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:54,040
You two are really professional actors.

40
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,000
I mean it.

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,480
You two should form a team.

42
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,480
- Don't waste your talents.
- Really?

43
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,680
Why didn't I think of that?

44
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,560
Us forming a team?

45
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,359
Exactly.

46
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:02,840
- You two.
- Let's go.

47
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,840
- Sounds great.
- Go.

48
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,640
Let's go.

49
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,680
That's a good idea.

50
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,400
You will be a hit.

51
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,400
Just wait and see.

52
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,439
You'll have my support.

53
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:09,759
Hope we never meet again, buddy.

54
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,400
Bye.

55
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,639
That's interesting.

56
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:12,520
That's interesting.

57
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,719
It is pretty interesting.

58
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,159
Wang Haixian.

59
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,280
Do you know where your problem lies?

60
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:25,319
I...

61
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:27,479
What are you doing?

62
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,439
Ms. Yan.

63
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:35,240
How can there be
such people on a real flight?

64
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,599
They are too exaggerating.

65
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,840
Such things wouldn't happen.

66
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,639
But such things can happen on a flight.

67
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,039
What would you do under this situation?

68
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,639
I'm pretty sure that won't happen to me.

69
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:47,560
What did you say?

70
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:51,759
I said

71
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,639
I'm sure I can handle it well.

72
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,960
Go back.

73
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:07,240
You saw Wang Haixian today.

74
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,120
What?

75
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:11,039
Don't play dumb.

76
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:13,960
When the extra held you hostage today,

77
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:15,599
Wang Haixian...

78
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,520
But what she did was not right.

79
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,319
What's right or wrong about it?

80
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,879
She's the beauty who saved you.

81
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:43,120
Thanks for today.

82
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:51,039
You are welcome.

83
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:52,280
It's my duty.

84
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,919
But I have to remind you,

85
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:57,120
as a flight attendant,

86
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,000
having physical contact
with a criminal is very dangerous.

87
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,639
As flight attendants,

88
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,719
our main task is to
calm the passengers and the criminals.

89
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:06,080
Unless it's necessary,

90
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,960
you must never take actions first.

91
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,000
I understand.

92
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,080
This kind of thing won't happen to me.

93
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,000
You can't promise that.

94
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,800
Anything could happen.

95
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,319
I'm not here to be a flight attendant.

96
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:22,319
Enjoy your food.

97
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:23,040
I'll leave now.

98
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:24,680
Wait a second.

99
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,560
It's vacation tomorrow.

100
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,040
Do you want to have a date with me?

101
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:36,959
I have other arrangements tomorrow.

102
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:39,079
Is there anything more important?

103
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:41,040
If it's not important...

104
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:47,040
Is it anything important?

105
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:49,759
Not really.

106
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,199
See you tomorrow then.

107
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:51,959
Bye.

108
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,120
Why do you stop reading?

109
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:02,639
Maybe we should go somewhere else.

110
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,120
Where?

111
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,639
Do you have any place in mind?

112
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:12,720
Let's go.

113
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,439
Press this.

114
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,279
Press this to fight.

115
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,360
That's right!

116
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:16,360
Look, it came out.

117
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,360
Here! It's here!

118
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,199
Quick! Hit it!

119
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:20,800
Fight!

120
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:22,639
That's great!

121
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,879
Let's play this game.

122
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,879
These are for you.

123
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,639
I am pretty good.

124
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,800
Let me give you a demonstration first.

125
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:31,600
One, two, three.

126
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,920
You got it!

127
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:42,680
Wait...

128
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,399
Do that again.

129
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:44,199
I want to see that.

130
00:06:58,879 --> 00:06:59,439
Li Er.

131
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:01,279
You are really amazing!

132
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:07,759
I'm so happy

133
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,920
with you this afternoon.

134
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:11,959
You're good at catching dolls.

135
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,319
You can get rich by winning the game.

136
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,600
You still haven't told me

137
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,160
why you want to be an attendant.

138
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,120
You haven't told me, either.

139
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,120
You tell me first.

140
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,000
Then I will tell you.

141
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,120
At first...

142
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,800
What?

143
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:36,959
Never mind.

144
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,040
Forget it.

145
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,360
No way.

146
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,959
It's annoying when you stop halfway.

147
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:42,560
What is it?

148
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:43,879
What's that?

149
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,879
I didn't want to be
a flight attendant at first,

150
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,759
but now I really cherish this job.

151
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,560
I used to live in the rural area.

152
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,040
If I can get a stable job,

153
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,920
I can take better care of my family.

154
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:08,000
I have let them down before.

155
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:17,519
They were disappointed in you,

156
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,360
because they have expectations for you.

157
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,639
Your family loves you.

158
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:27,360
Unlike my family.

159
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,720
They have been doing business abroad
since I was a child.

160
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:33,480
They believe money is enough
to show their love for me.

161
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,440
Sounds great, isn't it?

162
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,679
They never asked

163
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,120
what I want on my birthday.

164
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,480
So when I grew up,

165
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,799
whenever there is something I want,

166
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,759
or a goal I want to achieve,

167
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:49,279
I'll make sure to accomplish it
through my own efforts.

168
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,480
No one else can help me.

169
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,440
