3
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,680
You're crying
because you didn't get selected?

4
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,159
I've always been doing better than you.

5
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,920
I haven't eaten for three days
for this audition.

6
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,439
You weren't even there.
But the director chose you.

7
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,439
You are better than I am.

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,200
Everyone thinks so.

9
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,359
Stop pretending already.

10
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:48,400
Ms. Yan.

11
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:51,079
I need to tell you something.

12
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,200
Go ahead.

13
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,120
(Flight Training)
Sum up.

14
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,760
Next, the focus of our course

15
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,120
will still be on cabin safety training.

16
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:01,680
You all have mastered
each part of the training well.

17
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,760
Later, we will conduct compound training

18
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,120
targeting complex situations.

19
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,719
Okay, that's all.

20
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,120
Oh, right,
next week's shooting schedule is out.

21
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,719
Huang Li and Li Er will go.

22
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,960
Wang Haixian.

23
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:31,520
That's not right.

24
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,120
What happened?

25
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,719
Hasn't the photographer decided

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,439
to go with you and Li Er
right after he saw you

27
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:40,319
in your strong love couple vibe?

28
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,439
Shush.

29
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:48,360
Your chance to be with Li Er
is just gone like that.

30
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,319
Regarding the opportunity
of the publicity ambassador shooting,

31
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,120
I want Huang Li to have it.

32
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,960
The photographer already
chose you and Li Er, right?

33
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,360
I think

34
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:06,039
I wanna be a good flight attendant now.

35
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,639
There are many ways to prove myself.

36
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,479
But Huang Li is doing better than I am
at this stage.

37
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:14,159
I think she is the better fit for Li Er.

38
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,479
But I will seize

39
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,599
the next opportunity.

40
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:20,080
Alright.

41
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,120
Keep it up then.

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,960
Besides, I heard

43
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,039
he found you in the flight simulator.

44
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,280
What were you doing then?

45
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,000
It suddenly boosted his inspiration.

46
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:31,759
Secret.

47
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,199
Hee hee.

48
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:37,800
You two have a thing.
It's already written all over your face.

49
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,520
Is it that obvious?

50
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,240
So now you're a couple?

51
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,280
It'll be soon.

52
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,479
I'm gonna have him eating
out of the palm of one's hand.

53
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,439
(Why doesn't she want to
shoot the poster with me?)

54
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,240
(What does it actually mean?)

55
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,240
Why did you ask me to come here?

56
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,920
What's wrong?

57
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,680
What are you talking about?

58
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,040
That thing.

59
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,079
What thing?

60
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:32,240
Is it because of Huang Li?

61
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,759
Huang Li?

62
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:34,800
What's wrong with her?

63
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,079
Why don't you do the shooting with me?

64
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,040
I think Huang Li did better than me,

65
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,800
so I gave her the opportunity.

66
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,079
Are there any other reasons except this?

67
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,319
Other reasons?

68
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,959
(Li Er likes people who work hard.)

69
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:58,319
(This is a good chance
to declare myself.)

70
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,959
Yes.

71
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,319
I am going to work hard now.

72
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:13,879
Is it just about work?

73
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:15,639
Yes. It's all about work from now on.

74
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:17,079
I will be diligent in my job.

75
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:20,079
Be a good flight attendant
24 hours a day.

76
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,199
Go for it.

77
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:30,079
Thank you.

78
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,079
I will do my best.

79
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,160
Wait and see.

80
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,480
Hold on a second.

81
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:38,279
What's wrong?

82
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,879
The su...

83
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:44,720
Do you think the moon tonight
is beautiful?

84
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,600
It is beautiful.

85
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,439

What's wrong with you?

You're weird.

95
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,279
(Wang Haixian.)

96
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,240
(You are a genius.)

97
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,279
Is that him?

98
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:58,319
Let's have a word.

99
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,439
Wang Haixian.

100
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:11,000
I don't need your charity.

101
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:14,120
You're overthinking it.

102
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,199
What charity?

103
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,600
Try to say it again.

104
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:19,680
Everybody with a clear mind would know,

105
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,199
you are perfect for that.

106
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,079
So I offered to let you have it.

107
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,680
Oh, come on.

108
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,240
Split it. What's the deal?

109
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,720
Huang Li, I think you are
quite cute sometimes.

110
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,639
There's no deal here.

111
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,040
You think too much.

112
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:37,040
I am a quite simple person.

113
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:40,319
Sometimes I just want to make a friend.

114
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,319
I locked you in the flight simulator.

115
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,240
You know that?

116
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,360
I knew it was you.

117
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,360
That made sense.

118
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,959
So, I don't need your charity

119
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,360
and I don't need your pity.

120
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,480
I didn't do this

121
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,480
because of what you said.

122
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,079
Are you paranoid?

123
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,439
If anyone has had

124
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:03,519
performed so well like you,

125
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:05,360
I would have given them the opportunity,

126
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,079
so it had nothing to do with you.

127
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:10,040
Besides, you indirectly did a good deed.

128
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,720
What good deed?

129
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,560
It's nothing.

130
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,160
You sure don't want this?

131
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:21,040
Who wouldn't want that?

132
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:22,959
If I became the ambassador,

133
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:24,000
everyone would know

134
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,399
that I am a good attendant,

135
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,959
but there are many ways to prove myself.

136
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,680
I'm so great.

137
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,320
This won't be my only chance.

138
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,960
It's just a pity

139
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,840
that I can't shoot with Li Er anymore.

140
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:39,600
You...

141
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,840
You... What's wrong?

142
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,000
What happened?

143
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,159
Sit down first.

I'm starving.
I haven't eaten for three days.

00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,679
I practiced catwalk every day,

148
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:03,000
and now I'm just starving.

149
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,679
