00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:11,840
Who is it?

5
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,280
How are you? Are you all right?

6
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:14,680
Why are you here?

7
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,079
Isn't it time for the pilot exam?

8
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:17,319
Hurry up, or you'll be late.

9
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:18,719
Maybe next time.

10
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:19,560
Whatever.

11
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,400
No more excuses.

12
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,840
You have to overcome self-doubt.

13
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,799
Go, go, go!

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,040
I called you many times

15
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:25,640
and no answer.

16
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,760
I was worried sick.

17
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,840
I forgot to charge it.

18
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,599
It was dead.

19
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,400
What's wrong?

20
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,879
You didn't see the news?

21
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:33,920
News?

22
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,280
What? What's the new gossip?

(Sexy couples play out 'Kissing Gate')

24
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:51,079
The fact is pretty clear.

25
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,040
This report is nonsense.

26
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,200
About the fact,

27
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,680
we'll know after the investigation.

28
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,159
We only trust solid evidence, not words.

29
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,480
The girl involved is not here?

30
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,680
Mr. Zhang.

31
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,400
She took a day off today.

32
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,239
We are trying to contact her.

33
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:08,560
I trust our company's investigation team

34
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,759
will not jump to conclusions
before everything is clear.

35
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:15,919
Ms. Yan, don't worry.

36
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,960
I know lately
your team has had a good reputation.

37
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,280
I believe
you wouldn't make such a basic mistake.

38
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:22,639
Mr. Zhang.

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,599
We have really been wronged.

40
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:26,000
And I was right there...

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,879
Enough.

42
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:30,080
We will fully
cooperate with you afterward,

43
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,039
and tell you what really happened.

44
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,000
We will bear any consequences.

45
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:35,719
Rest assured.

46
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,560
Yucheng Airlines is a community.

47
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,520
If you were framed,

48
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,159
we will find out.

49
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:42,840
However,

50
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:45,199
it happened in your team,

51
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,639
so the company has decided

52
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:47,960
that you will be grounded.

53
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,840
Once everything is clear,

54
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,319
you will be notified of the outcome.

55
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:53,360
Please cooperate with us.

56
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,439
Keep your phone on.

57
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:57,360
Does it work for you, Ms. Yan?

58
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,919
Thank you then.

59
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,960
Stop looking.

60
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,560
This article is purely nonsense.

61
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,479
I just gave you a hand at the time.

62
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,479
It's obviously aimed at us.

63
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,280
Such an evil public account.

64
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,039
They'd write anything
for a bit of traffic.

65
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:16,159
But where exactly
did this photo come from?

66
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:21,360
Right.

67
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,319
Who took this photo?

68
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:36,879
The man who bullied Huang Li.

69
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:38,199
That 41C guy.

70
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:40,000
Was he in the restroom?

71
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,879
He went there.

72
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:46,039
- We went to the rear cabin afterward.
- Right.

73
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,360
Look at this angle.

74
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,120
It was the exact angle
shooting from the restroom.

75
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,919
People in the last row can't do it.

76
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,000
What an awful person!

77
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,599
I knew that man was no good.

78
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,879
I'm so angry.

79
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:01,919
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

80
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,759
Yes, it was probably the retaliation
of that passenger who harassed Huang Li.

81
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,800
The seat number should be 41C.

82
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,520
41C.

83
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,520
Yes.

84
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,039
The air marshals took him
to make a statement after we landed.

85
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:17,240
The airport police
should yield his information.

86
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,439
Okay.

87
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:21,079
Alright, I'll be in touch.

88
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,079
Okay.

89
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,199
What is it?

90
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,519
Mr. Zhang said
he would contact that passenger.

91
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:28,360
Talk to him and see how it plays out.

92
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:32,199
He's not easy to deal with, I suppose.

93
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,399
Will he just play along?

94
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:34,920
We have to try.

95
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,000
If I come across this guy,

96
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:39,519
I'd definitely beat him up.

97
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:41,959
That's too easy for him.

98
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,639
We should make him play a eunuch

99
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,839
in a costume drama.

100
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,800
Enough.
What's the point of saying all this?

101
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,000
So what should we do?

102
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,279
Where's Haixian?

103
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:54,120
She's not answering my calls.

104
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,199
Probably she's upset.

105
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,199
Call her again.

106
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,279
Call her again?

107
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:57,959
Right.

108
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:12,720
Why you don't have food in your kitchen?

109
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,120
We can only make do for now.

110
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:17,199
Doesn't matter.

111
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,879
Anyway, I'm not in the mood to eat.

112
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,600
Here, try the noodles I made for you.

113
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:24,160
Come on.

114
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,439
You are doing okay?

115
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:32,759
Of course.

116
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:34,160
I'm fine.

117
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,040
Try it.

118
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,199
See how it tastes.

119
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:40,879
I'll take a bite.

120
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:43,959
How is it?

121
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,839
Give it to me.

122
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,759
Delicious.

123
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:28,279
Are you okay?

124
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:29,000
I am.

125
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,920
How about you?

126
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,519
I'm okay.

127
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:39,000
Wang Haixian, open the door.

128
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,240
Call her.

129
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,480
You call Li Er.

130
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,360
- He isn't answering.
- Haixian.

131
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,120
He's been ghosting me.

132
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:46,680
Would she go to Ms. Yan?

133
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,519
With Li Er?

134
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:48,439
No way.

135
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:50,120
If they were,

136
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,079
Ms. Yan would call us.

137
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,160
What should we do?

138
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,240
I'm worried about her.

139
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,040
The comments online are unbearable.

140
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,199
Would she do something stupid?

141
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,959
Do you know how to play?

142
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:02,519
I know, wait.

143
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:06,879
I've got it.

144
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:08,439
- Wang Haixian.
- Haixian.

145
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:10,240
Call the police.

146
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,240
Wang Haixian, open the door.

147
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,199
What are you doing? Give it to me.

148
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,519
Wang Haixian, open the door.

149
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:23,120
I look ugly now.

150
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,199
What's that noise?

151
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:25,480
Give it to me.

152
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,240
Still beautiful.

153
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,240
My little bear.

154
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,560
Give me my little bear.

155
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:33,519
Let me wear it.

156
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,519
How dare you?

157
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:37,399
