3
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:47,200
You can eat first.

4
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:55,679
Don't catch a cold.

5
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:03,679
You're manly.

6
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:11,480
Do you think this looks good?

7
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,640
Yes, it's pretty good.

8
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,680
In such a beautiful place,

9
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:30,239
should we do something meaningful

10
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:31,359
to make the scene worth it?

11
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,560
We can start anytime.

12
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,359
Come on, let's take a photo.

13
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,560
Huang Li, you are such a buzzkill.

14
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,840
Be observant, please.

15
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,680
What happened?

16
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,280
Are you two together now?

17
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:09,159
I don't get it.

18
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:09,960
Come on.

19
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,800
Let's take a picture.

20
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,080
- Hurry up.
- Coming.

21
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:13,719
Ready.

22
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,159
Look at the camera.

23
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,400
Three, two, one.

24
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:25,639
Li Er is back.

25
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:27,560
- Grab your things and we can go.
- Let's go.

26
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,400
- Let's go.
- Here.

27
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,199
I'm gonna take this.

28
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:31,280
Alright.

29
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,159
Hello?

30
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,439
What?

31
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,680
This is not what we agreed on.

32
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,479
These five people are all my students.

33
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,840
They have all passed the assessment.

34
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,680
Why only four can be admitted?

35
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,960
I understand you need to lay off people,

36
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,719
but this is out of line.

37
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:57,840
We can talk tomorrow.

38
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,039
Let's go.

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,520
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

40
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,000
I don't want to be a spoilsport.

41
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,879
It's okay, Ms. Yan.

42
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:22,840
You can tell us.

43
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,719
We can cope with it together.

44
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,159
For our company,

45
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,199
due to the bad economy,
the overall performance is declining.

46
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,840
There's a large-scale layoff
going on right now.

47
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,199
For each group,
the last one will be eliminated.

48
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:43,520
Each group is limited to four recruits.

49
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:46,879
That means,

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,919
one of us can't be a flight attendant.

51
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,599
It-it's nothing.

52
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:03,919
I thought it was something worse.

53
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:06,000
I didn't want to
be a flight attendant anyway.

54
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,360
I can just drop out.

55
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,000
They all did well.

56
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:10,319
I'm okay with that.

57
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,000
Not a big deal.

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,319
Come on, grab your things and go.

59
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,039
Grab your phone.

60
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:14,159
You lost one last time.

61
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,039
Come on.

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,079
Let's go.

63
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,399
Bye.

64
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,920
We can come up with another solution.

65
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,839
Exactly.

66
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:25,560
That's right, Haixian.

67
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,079
You were talking nonsense.

68
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:28,639
It isn't settled yet.

69
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:36,839
Why are you so serious?

70
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,279
You know me, right?

71
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:40,240
Everything I do doesn't last long.

72
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,759
I don't want this job anymore.

73
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:42,800
I'm okay.

74
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,959
I'm going to the loo.

75
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:44,600
Wait downstairs.

76
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,680
Pack your things and come.

77
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,240
Be quick.

78
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,480
Come on. Bye-bye.

79
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,120
Why am I crying?

80
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:04,279
I don't want to be a flight attendant.

81
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:06,240
I came here to chase Li Er.

82
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,600
Now he is my boyfriend.

83
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,160
Mission accomplished.

84
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:16,160
Oh my.

85
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,600
I should be happy.

86
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:26,240
You don't want to
be a flight attendant at all, right?

87
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:31,120
Wang Haixian.

88
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:34,639
You're so weird.

89
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,480
You...

90
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,319
I can't be a flight attendant anymore.

91
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,160
Wang Haixian.

92
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,199
Haixian.

93
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,160
Wang Haixian.

94
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:10,399
Hi.

95
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,000
Wang Haixian, what's with you?

96
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,120
You really aren't coming?

97
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,800
What's the matter with you?

98
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,759
You made a decision without us.

99
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,319
Why didn't you pick up?

100
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,040
It's dead.

101
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,519
Are you okay, Haixian?

102
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:25,439
I'm fine.

103
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:27,120
Look at me, happy and alive.

104
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,240
It's your first visit to my home, huh?

105
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,319
Come on in.

106
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,160
Come on.

107
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,319
Let me show you around my place.

108
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:35,079
There are many good things inside,
come on.

109
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,920
This is the living room.

110
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,560
And,

111
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,920
this is a big balcony.

112
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,279
It's very nice, right?

113
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,600
What?

114
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,040
You all look sad.

115
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,279
Not interested?

116
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,600
Or is my house just not nice?

117
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,839
I'll take you to see a secret room.
Let's go.

118
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,120
Welcome to my secret room.

119
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,319
Come in.

120
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,480
This is a limited edition white T-shirt

121
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,040
I won from my first participation
in an eating contest.

122
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,759
And then...

123
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:17,839
And then...

124
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:19,439
Look at this.

125
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,360
This is my first motorcycle helmet.

126
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,079
I went through quite a lot

127
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,600
to learn how to ride a motorcycle.

128
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,040
My legs were bruised and battered.

129
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,759
And this thing.

130
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:28,639
Haixian.

131
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,319
Why don't you wait
until Ms. Yan talks to management?

132
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,439
Yeah, Haixian.

133
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:35,120
You don't need to give up for us.

134
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,519
When we get the result,

135
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,920
we'll find out who's the last.

136
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,800
We can all accept that.

137
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,399
You shouldn't offer
to give up your position.

138
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:43,759
We can't get peace of mind

139
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,439
since you give up your opportunity.

140
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:49,399
What are you talking about?

141
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:50,839
You're talking nonsense.

142
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,439
It's your first time to be here.

143
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:58,879
I need to be a good host.

144
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:00,439
I'll bring you some fruit.

145
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:01,199
Wait for me.

146
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,000
Have a seat first.

147
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,959
Sit wherever you want.

148
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:10,560
