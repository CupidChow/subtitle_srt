1
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:40,479
Wang Haixian,

2
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:42,719
did you say you came here
because of him?

3
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:49,159
Yes.

4
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:50,039
Ms. Yan,

5
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:52,000
she came to borrow headphones from me.

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,920
I'm still hesitating.

7
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:56,799
Is that so?

8
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:58,320
Yes.

9
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:00,159
Wang Haixian,

10
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:03,399
don't disturb others
in the middle of the night.

11
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:05,519
Flight attendants have a heavy workload.

12
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,560
It's very draining.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,280
Good sleep can ensure
work efficiency and quality.

14
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:09,879
Understand?

15
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,640
Yes, I'll go back to sleep.

16
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,200
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,319
You got caught by Demon Yan last night?

18
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:37,319
No,

19
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,719
by Ms. Yan.

20
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,480
She already had an issue with you.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,480
Now you'll be targeted even more.

22
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,560
I don't care.

23
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,079
I'm not here to be a flight attendant.

24
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:52,920
But I think

25
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,480
if you want to win over Li Er,

26
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,359
you'll have to spend some time.

27
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,120
If you keep being like this,

28
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,040
Yan Yan will surely
kick you out in advance.

29
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,680
People say it's easy
for women to woo men.

30
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,200
Why is it so hard for me?

31
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,120
Girls these days

32
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,400
really lack restraint.

33
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,680
Going to his room
right after they first met.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,800
Isn't that right?

35
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:18,280
Who are you talking about?

36
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:22,319
Don't you know who I am talking about?

37
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,080
So you're here just for fishing?

38
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,360
I came here just to fish.

39
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,280
Mr. Fish.

40
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,400
No, Mr. Bait.

41
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,919
What did you say
you wanted to eat just now?

42
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,000
Mr. Bait.

43
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,080
Wait for me.

44
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:48,280
Please be careful.

45
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,159
Meal cart coming through.

46
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:51,120
Please be careful.

47
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,360
Now, we will take the paper cups.

48
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:53,960
You should

49
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,159
hold the bottom third.

50
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,879
This is for passengers

51
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:59,960
to hold the cup from the middle.

52
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,719
Wang Haixian,

53
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,199
why are you laughing?

54
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,080
You try it.

55
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,520
Ask the passengers

56
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,560
what they'd like to drink.

57
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,039
Here, water for you.

58
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:12,919
Wrong way to hold it.

59
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,199
- Where is it?
- Water.

60
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:16,400
Where should your hand be?

61
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,479
Here.

62
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,240
Should you pour water here?

63
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,199
I just told you where
to unscrew the bottle cap.

64
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:26,080
The next point is

65
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,560
showing everyone
where the emergency exits are.

66
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,479
We have a total of four cabin doors.

67
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,400
Do you know what to do?

68
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:40,639
What did I say just now?

69
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:41,800
Eight emergency exits.

70
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:44,400
Are you doing exercises?

71
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,520
Emergency... what?

72
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,759
The emergency exit is located here.

73
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:53,159
Here.

74
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:59,719
What kind of suffering
do I endure day after day?

75
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:01,039
High heels.

76
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,479
I can't wear high heels at all.

77
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:04,719
Are you okay?

78
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:07,400
I am not okay.

79
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,919
I'm going to see Li Er now.

80
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:10,560
Don't go.

81
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:12,479
You ran into Ms. Yan last time.

82
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:14,240
When should I go to see him?

83
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,680
We're training all day.

84
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,720
Why am I here?

85
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,879
Am I here to endure hardship?

86
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:20,000
You can't just go directly to see him.

87
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,920
When should I go to see him then?

88
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:26,079
Let me tell you,

89
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:28,800
I am not cut out
to be a flight attendant at all.

90
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,839
You've got to be careful
about the method.

91
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:36,120
According to the big data
from Yucheng Youth website,

92
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,360
the most popular girls
are roughly categorized

93
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,199
into the aloof type,

94
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:39,920
the reserved type,

95
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,480
the sexy type,

96
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,839
and the cute type.

97
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,439
So what type am I?

98
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:46,920
You are an abnormal type.

99
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:54,079
The reserved type of women
accounts for as much as 36.7 percent.

100
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:56,000
I think if you really want
to win over Li Er,

101
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,839
you need to change your type.

102
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,680
Break him down point by point.

103
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,800
The reserved type.

104
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,879
How should I be reserved?

105
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,879
Have a sense of proportion when talking.

106
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:06,319
You can't be too blunt.

107
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:09,279
It's enough to make the other person
understand your hint.

108
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,199
Hint.

109
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,399
I'll try.

110
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,079
Coming.

111
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:18,800
Wang Haixian.

112
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,800
You're here again.

113
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:24,800
What's up?

114
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,959
Are you okay?

115
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:28,360
I'm fine.

116
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,480
You have something to do.

117
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:31,839
Not at all.

118
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,160
Get out.

119
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:52,160
What's up?

120
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,199
Actually, there's nothing much.

121
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,839
It's just that I have a friend.

122
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:06,519
The day before graduating from college,

123
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:10,120
she fell in love with a boy
at first sight.

124
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:13,839
Since then, my friend has been trying

125
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,560
hard to enter that boy's world.

126
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:22,759
She practiced her smile every day
with a chopstick in her mouth.

127
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,279
Finally, one day,

128
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,480
she stood before the boy

129
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,879
just to say to that boy,

130
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,879
"I like you."

131
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,000
What does your friend's matter
have to do with me?

132
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,439
Of course, it has.

133
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,240
Do I know this friend of yours?

134
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:59,879
Of course you do.

135
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:02,680
Why would I know your friend?

136
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:06,000
You don't know her now.

137
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,399
But you'll know her in the future.

138
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:09,319
Why should I get to know her?

139
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,839
Is that so important?

140
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:15,040
Aren't we talking

141
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,519
about the story of that girl?

142
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,240
That girl is so good to that boy.

143
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,839
Can't you get to know her?

144
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:23,639
But I don't know her.

145
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:24,519
The boy...

146
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:27,600
No need to know who this boy

147
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,600
and this girl are.

148
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,759
Anyway, this girl is especially good
to this boy.

149
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:33,240
Do you think something special
should happen between them?

150
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:34,959
How is it?

151
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:35,839
It should...

152
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,319
A big move about love

153
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,399
should happen between them.

154
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,160
Dating.

155
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,759
Dating? How to date?

156
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:47,040
Meaning, there should be a process,

157
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,120
allowing their relationship to develop.

158
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:51,480
Develop?

159
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:53,480
So, shouldn't there be a story

160
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,639
between the boy and the girl?

161
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:56,439
What story?

162
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:58,600
Shouldn't that boy accept that girl?
