=Episode 4=

3
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,719
What were you doing last night?

4
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:47,280
When I woke up,
I didn't see you come back.

5
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:51,679
I went to chat with Li Er.

6
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,840
Well, you...

7
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,960
You stayed at his place
for so long last night?

8
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:05,959
Did the two of you talk
all through the night?

9
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,200
Ms. Lan,

10
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:11,760
could you step aside?

11
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:13,599
I would like a glass of orange juice.

12
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:24,239
Hi.

13
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,239
Li Er,

14
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:38,120
Xiao Zhizhi,

15
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,120
Wang Haixian,

16
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,519
when did you go to bed last night?

17
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,439
2 a.m.

18
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:44,239
And you, Xiao Zhizhi?

19
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,599
During the formal training,

20
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:51,400
is this your attitude?

21
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,439
Today, the three of you

22
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,200
will do twice the amount
of the exercises.

23
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,079
Did you get that?

24
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:59,560
- Yes.
- Yes.

25
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:13,879
Ms. Yan,

26
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:15,919
I want to explain something to you.

27
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:18,520
Go ahead.

28
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,240
I have indeed made a mistake.

29
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,280
I didn't rest well.

30
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:23,840
It has affected my condition today.

31
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,360
I apologize to you.

32
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:28,759
Li Er,

33
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:30,800
are you having any difficulties?

34
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,680
No.

35
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:37,879
Okay.

36
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,319
Tell me if you have any difficulties.

37
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,800
Understood.

38
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:46,639
Romantic.

39
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,919
Which woman doesn't love romance?

40
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,680
Which man doesn't love romance?

41
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,039
Gentleness

42
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:52,919
and romance

43
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:54,439
are everything.

44
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:04,680
Charge.

45
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,280
Mr. Fish.

46
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,120
No,

47
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,759
Mr. Bait.

48
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,719
Li Er,

49
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:24,400
does Wang Haixian have feelings for you?

50
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,719
No.

51
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:26,639
No feelings?

52
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,039
She comes here so frequently.

53
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,840
I will explain it to her.

54
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,759
That woman is like that.

55
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:34,159
Do you dare to explain it to her?

56
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:36,919
Of course, I dare.

57
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:37,960
I'm not afraid of her.

58
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,159
Hi.

59
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,439
May I come...?

60
00:03:58,919 --> 00:03:59,560
I...

61
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,000
What are you doing here?

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,560
I...

63
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,360
Are you waiting for me?

64
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,879
Is it romantic?

65
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:39,959
Yes...

66
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:42,759
Tonight's moon belongs to us.

67
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,480
Let's enjoy the moon together.

68
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,720
Isn't it too cold outside?

69
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:52,600
Don't care.

70
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:55,480
There must be mosquitoes.

71
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:57,360
Not afraid of mosquitoes.

72
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,160
Ms. Yan will come.

73
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,519
Not afraid of Ms. Yan.

74
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,199
Wang Haixian... Okay.

75
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,480
The moon is really round tonight.

76
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:18,480
Wang Haixian,

77
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,959
I want to tell you

78
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:24,000
I really cherish my current profession.

79
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,839
Right now, I just want
to do my current job well.

80
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,279
Do you understand?

81
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:30,920
Understood.

82
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,240
That's good then.

83
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:37,319
What were you just saying?

84
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,480
Look!

85
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,319
A shooting star!

86
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,079
Look!

87
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,800
That's an airplane.

88
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,120
Is that so?

89
00:05:50,468 --> 00:05:52,600
(Flight Training)

90
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,480
We've been practicing

91
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,040
the basic moves for a few days now.

92
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,560
To better train our cabin service,

93
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:00,600
today, I've prepared a special
practical training for everyone.

94
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,639
This is the first time our company
has hired external actors

95
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:05,000
to act as our passengers.

96
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:07,199
Get ready to welcome the passengers.

97
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:13,360
There are actors?

98
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,959
So thrilling.

99
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,800
Why do I suddenly feel a bit nervous?

100
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,240
What's there to be nervous about?

101
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,920
Isn't it fun to play for real?

102
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,920
Only you are playful.

103
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,759
What good ideas can Demon Yan have?

104
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:24,360
We are the ones to be tormented.

105
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,720
Alright, hurry up and get ready.

106
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:28,879
Pretty handsome, huh?

107
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,079
Let's go.

108
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:32,439
Come on.

109
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:34,079
Move faster!

110
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:37,920
Come on, quickly.

111
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:39,879
Walk faster.

112
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:42,399
Stop.

113
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:43,120
Right here.

114
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,279
Let me tell you.

115
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:49,040
Today, I want all of you to be spirited.

116
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,399
This opportunity

117
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,759
is very important.

118
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:52,680
Assistant Director.

119
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,639
Assistant Director.

120
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:56,720
What do you want?

121
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,439
Well, Assistant Director,

122
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:58,519
isn't this a live shoot?

123
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:00,319
How come I don't see any cameras?

124
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,279
You're the one who talks a lot,
aren't you?

125
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:03,959
Bro,

126
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,439
aren't we here to shoot a film today?

127
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,600
This is acting.

128
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,040
This is the filming location.

129
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,720
Come on,

130
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,319
let me tell you.

131
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,199
I've heard

132
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,040
Director Zhang

133
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,680
is about to start a new play.

134
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,519
He needs a supporting role.

135
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,600
Today,

136
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:25,160
I will record everything
with a digital video camera.

137
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:28,199
Today, you are acting as passengers.

138
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,439
Passengers.

139
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:33,480
As long as you perform well enough,

140
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,920
one of the supporting roles
will be yours.

141
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,319
Director Zhang,

142
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,519
if I have an extra ticket,

143
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:41,040
will you come with me?

144
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,800
Director Zhang, just call me Hu.

145
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,839
I'm really good at acting.

146
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,639
You won't get this feel
from someone else.

147
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:46,800
Let me tell you...

148
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,879
Director He,

149
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,120
how are the preparations?

150
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,160
Ms. Yan,

151
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,800
it'll be ready soon.

152
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,120
Everything has been arranged.

153
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,439
Okay, thanks for your hard work.

154
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,920
Do you have any special requirements?

155
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,519
No.

156
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:01,279
Just let them play to their strengths.

157
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,079
Okay.

158
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:02,600
Okay.

159
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,480
Then get ready.

160
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,360
- Okay.
- Okay.

161
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,399
Did you get it?

162
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:08,399
Make sure to perform well, okay?

163
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,680
Come.

164
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,519
Gather over there.

165
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:11,279
Go.

166
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:16,240
Go on.

167
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,120
Go.

168
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,079
Quick.

169
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,800
Bro, the right side of my face.

170
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,279
Okay, go, hurry.

171
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:21,920
