3
00:00:38,112 --> 00:00:38,920
(Cabin Crew Training)

4
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,079
Now you are clear about which plane door

5
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:42,560
you are responsible for, right?

6
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:43,600
Yes.

7
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,119
Well,

8
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:46,439
from pre-flight preparation
to post-landing examination,

9
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:48,399
we just went through
the entire workflow.

10
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,240
Question time.

11
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,280
What do we prepare before the flight
and how should we greet passengers?

12
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,280
Huang Li,

13
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,320
tell us your answer.

14
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:56,479
We need to prepare the beverages,

15
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:57,079
hot towels,

16
00:00:57,079 --> 00:00:57,840
count the meals,

17
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,799
and check our makeup.

18
00:00:58,799 --> 00:00:59,439
That's all.

19
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,640
Great, please be seated.

20
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:04,200
Next question.
What do we need to check before takeoff?

21
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:05,280
Xiao Zhizhi,

22
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,959
you tell us.

23
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,359
I think...

24
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:12,200
I know the answer.

25
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,439
Wang Haixian.

26
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:18,560
We need to check the seat belts,

27
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,239
window shades,

28
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:20,120
and tray tables.

29
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,840
See if there's
any excess luggage underfoot

30
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,319
and tell the passengers
to put the phone in airplane mode.

31
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:25,519
Very good.

32
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:26,239
Please be seated.

33
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,120
Look outside.

34
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,719
No smoke, no fire, and no obstruction.

35
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:41,840
Open the door.

36
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,439
Switch my hands.

37
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,359
Open the door.

38
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:51,879
Hi.

39
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:03,280
What's wrong with her today?

40
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,000
She's practicing so hard.

41
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,120
It's a bit unusual.

42
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,240
You five, come here.

43
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:16,800
Let's summarize.

44
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,000
As flight attendants,

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,800
our primary task

46
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,560
is to guarantee the passenger's safety
during the flight.

47
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,599
So you must pay full attention

48
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,719
when we do the training for emergencies.

49
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:28,280
It's also the most crucial part
of your final assessment.

50
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,120
Today,

51
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,439
I want to give credit to someone.

52
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:35,800
Wang Haixian.

53
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:38,800
Well done.

54
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,479
You made some progress.

55
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:43,439
One more thing.

56
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:44,919
Next week,

57
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:47,599
there'll be a filming task
for the Yucheng Airlines.

58
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,520
We need to send our best trainees.

59
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,360
The top management

60
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,400
decided to let Li Er represent for boys.

61
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,479
As for girls,

62
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,840
Huang Li...

63
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,879
I won't let you down.

64
00:02:59,039 --> 00:02:59,800
Huang Li.

65
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,960
You, Haixian, and Lan Rui can sign up.

66
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:03,719
You can all give it a shot.

67
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,120
That's all.

68
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:12,639
(Cabin Crew Training)

69
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:13,439
What's wrong?

70
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,840
You scared me!

71
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,960
The promotional poster photographer

72
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,479
will be here soon to pick his heroine.

73
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:21,680
I heard that Huang Li
has prepared for a long time.

74
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,960
You need to get prepared too.

75
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,360
I'm a beautiful woman.

76
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,639
I don't need to prepare.

77
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,080
Look at me.

78
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,639
No.

79
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:34,759
Blush.

80
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:36,759
You need to go heavier on the blush.

81
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,439
Hey, what are you doing?

82
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,560
I'm...

83
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,480
I'm just looking around.

84
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:29,959
Are you learning how to fly a plane?

85
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,639
Not at all.

86
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,839
The photographer
will pick your heroine today.

87
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:40,759
I want you to watch me.

88
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:41,519
Sure.

89
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:42,759
Okay, let's go.

90
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:43,519
Good luck to me.

91
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,000
What's wrong?

92
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,560
Have you seen Wang Haixian?

93
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,160
Wang Haixian?

94
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,160
Haven't seen her.

95
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:05,680
I guess she gets cold feet

96
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,959
before the audition.

97
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,040
Director Wang.

98
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,079
No way.

99
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:23,680
You can't be serious.

100
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,800
There's no signal.

101
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,879
Don't worry.

102
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:27,759
The mechanic will come

103
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,439
before the base is closed.

104
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,720
Then we can go out.

105
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,879
I can't.

106
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:34,800
I have an audition to go.

107
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:39,720
So you practiced so hard

108
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,600
just for the audition.

109
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,199
To be honest,

110
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:48,560
I applied for the job for you

111
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,639
in the first place.

112
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,240
But you know,

113
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,040
those two extras that day...

114
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:57,600
They were quite interesting.

115
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,600
They went all out

116
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,560
just to get closer to their dreams.

117
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,079
And I've got the opportunity.

118
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:07,879
Maybe for someone,

119
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:10,120
this is what he longs for,

120
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,399
his life

121
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:15,759
or even his only hope.

122
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,839
So I now understand that day

123
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:20,959
why you were so angry.

124
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,639
I mean it.

125
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:29,079
I did want to take photos with you
at that time.

126
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,600
However,

127
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,800
I've got another purpose.

128
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:38,199
You don't have to say all this to me.

129
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,839
Come on.

130
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:41,360
Let's figure out how to get out.

131
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,680
Two people signed up for this, right?

132
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,040
- Wait.
- Why is only one here?

133
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,600
Huang Li.

134
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,600
Where's Wang Haixian?

135
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,480
I don't know.

136
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,560
Did you call her?

137
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,600
She didn't pick up.

138
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,720
Don't wait.

139
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,800
Hurry up, let's begin.

140
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,560
You can proceed.

141
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,319
Director Wang.

142
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,319
My name is Huang Li.

143
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,439
Actually,

144
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:00,480
we share a surname,

145
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,680
as my auntie is called Wang.

146
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,560
And what's more,

147
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,240
you even look like her.

148
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,519
Huang Li.

149
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,160
Huang Li.

150
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,399
My time is very precious.

151
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,319
Introduce yourself.

152
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,279
Okay.

153
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,839
Director Wang.

154
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:13,560
I am Huang Li.

155
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,920
I'm 1.68 meters tall.

156
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,040
I exercise every day,

157
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,160
and I'm on a light diet.

158
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,120
I did all that for today.

159
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:27,600
Oh, my God.

160
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,519
That simulator moves.

161
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,279
That was the wrong button.

162
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:32,319
Can you try it again?

163
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,319
I...

164
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,639
No.

165
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:37,040

00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,639
