2
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:37,448
=Episode 12=

3
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,680
What's going on with you today?

4
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,120
You seem a bit off.

5
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:11,000
It is just too hot.

6
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,079
That's not what I mean.

7
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:14,400
I mean,

8
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,239
after knowing your partner is Huang Li
for that promotional photo shooting,

9
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,200
you looked preoccupied.

10
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:21,280
Zhizhi,

11
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,879
let me ask you something.

12
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:24,840
Ask away.

13
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,200
Have you ever been in love?

14
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:33,719
No.

15
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:35,159
I mean,

16
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:37,359
I have a friend,

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,599
and he was kissed by a girl.

18
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,519
What?

19
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:42,920
You were kissed by Wang Haixian.

20
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,359
No.

21
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,519
I mean my friend.

22
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,480
And then what?

23
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:53,879
Then the girl acted
like nothing happened.

24
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:57,159
That's why recently

25
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,680
you looked preoccupied,

26
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,519
anxious,

27
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,120
fretting,

28
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,040
and haggard?

29
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:03,040
No.

30
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:04,760
My friend

31
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:07,280
seems to match everything you said.

32
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,360
You must have fallen for Wang Haixian.

33
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,759
How could that be?

34
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:14,719
Will I...

35
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:17,599
My friend has never asked me
about Wang Haixian before.

36
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,759
Any more questions about Wang Haixian?

37
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:23,120
She has been quite serious
about her job recently, huh?

38
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:27,080
I think she did change a lot recently.

39
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,599
She was a very goal-oriented person,

40
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:32,120
but she could also be quite fickle.

41
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:35,319
Does she have any hobbies?

42
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:37,360
Or what things does she like?

43
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,080
She likes a lot of things.

44
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,039
She loves hoarding things.

45
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:43,080
She gets what she wants
no matter what it takes.

46
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,800
After that?

47
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,199
They are just left to collect dust.

48
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:47,759
Next thing I know,
she has a new favorite.

49
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,639
Does she have any hobbies
that last longer?

50
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:54,879
A hobby that lasts long?

51
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:55,520
Yeah.

52
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:57,199
A long-term hobby

53
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,639
or a favorite person.

54
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,840
Anything.

55
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,400
There is one thing.

56
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,039
Xian is really awesome at cycling.

57
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:14,199
Right, guys?

58
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,439
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

59
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:17,240
But she didn't show up recently.

60
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,360
Why?

61
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,280
I heard she went to play esports
for a pair of headphones.

62
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:23,240
Right.

63
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,280
I remember her.

64
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,479
She won the championship
at our internet cafe.

65
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:28,479
She's so good at gaming?

66
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:30,879
It had nothing to do with her.

67
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:33,599
She hired
four professional esports players.

68
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,599
That was just a piece of cake for them.

69
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:36,919
So what happened later?

70
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:37,879
She got the headphones?

71
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:38,800
Of course.

72
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,479
But she never showed up again.

73
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,199
Where did she go then?

74
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,840
She was the most persistent person
I've ever seen.

75
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,039
The money she spent here for the quoits

76
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:49,639
is enough to buy 30 bear dolls.

77
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:53,080
For that bear?

78
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,080
She played all night.

79
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:02,439
You're not here to throw quoits, right?

80
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,240
No.

81
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:11,439
So this is the roasted pancake
that you used for the competition?

82
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:11,960
Yes.

83
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,360
But we won't hold that competition again
because of her.

84
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:18,319
Was that a prize for the competition?

85
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:29,279
Turns out
she is a three-minute passion person.

86
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,519
When she pulls something off,
she moves on.

87
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:32,920
Does she do this to people?

88
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,040
I don't know about that.

89
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:41,680
But she did change her work attitude
because of people.

90
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,800
Who?

91
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,439
Those extras.

92
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:50,879
That's it?

93
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,120
Nobody else?

94
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:53,399
Yeah.

95
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,240
That's it.

96
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,279
Nobody else.

97
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:58,240
Alright.

98
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,160
I'm leaving.

99
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,199
See you at dinner tonight.

100
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:08,199
I'm not taking...

101
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:09,040
Let me get this done.

102
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,279
Take a photo here later.

103
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,560
Let me tidy this up.

104
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,439
Hurry up, you take that...

105
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:14,839
Don't rush, alright?

106
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:16,240
Come over here, Zhizhi.

107
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,360
I'm coming.

108
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,439
Here.

109
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,920
Let's have a drink first.

110
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,720
Okay.

111
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,120
It's the weekend today.

112
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,199
Drink away. Come on.

113
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,639
Cheers, cheers.

114
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,279
Happy weekend.

115
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:29,319
Cheers.

116
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,360
Zhizhi.

117
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,439
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

118
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,279
You've been grilling.

119
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:37,839
My pleasure.

120
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:39,000
Thank you.

121
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,600
You grabbed a beer?

122
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,680
You said you never drank.

123
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,639
Impressive.

124
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:51,160
- Impressive.
- Li Er.

125
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,040
You have changed.

126
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,959
He is a man now.

127
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,560
Fantastic.

128
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,279
What...

129
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,199
He looks upset.

130
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,120
(Is it the only way)

131
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:18,240
(to draw your attention?)

132
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:22,759
I guess maybe he's a bit tipsy
since it's the first time he drinks.

133
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:24,680
He's tipsy. Just let him be.

134
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,160
Have you guys heard?

135
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:28,800
Yan Yan.

136
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,120
She's not like us ordinary folks.

137
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,959
(She hasn't noticed yet?)

138
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,160
You're being sarcastic.

139
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:48,560
Surprise, huh?

140
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,120
Yeah.

141
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,639
Lan.

142
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:51,160
That bag I told you about last time?

143
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:52,920
I can't find it anywhere.

144
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,000
Might be customized.

145
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,680
Right.

146
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,279
Just take it.

147
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,680
Take two of those.

148
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,879
Hold it like this. Slow down.

149
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:00,800
I'm trying.

150
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,480
You've got a vibe.

151
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,240
You've got that vibe.

152
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,439
Let's have a drink.

153
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:06,439
Grab me a beer.

154
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:09,079
Is Li Er still in the restroom?

155
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:09,680
Where is he?

156
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:11,480
Maybe he fell into the pit.

157
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:35,920
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

158
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,480
Should we go find him?

159
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,079
He...

160
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:40,360
Maybe he already went back.

161
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:40,959
It's late.

162
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:41,920
Let's go.

163
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,199
Alright, come on.

164
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:45,800
Do you need a hand?

165
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:47,959
