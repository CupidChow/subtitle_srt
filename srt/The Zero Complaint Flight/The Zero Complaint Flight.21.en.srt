3
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,000
We

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,079
were so worried about you outside.

5
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,000
But you are here

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,479
whispering sweet nothings.

7
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:46,039
Li Er,

8
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:47,479
you don't even want to answer calls

9
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:49,039
after being in a relationship, huh?

10
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,560
Haixian,

11
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,840
I called you so many times.

12
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,200
You didn't pick up even once.

13
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,399
My phone ran out of battery yesterday.

14
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,039
I left it outside to recharge it.

15
00:00:58,039 --> 00:00:58,880
What about you?

16
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,600
I forgot to take my phone inside.

17
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,239
What now?

18
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,280
Because of this,

19
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,120
the whole crew has been grounded.

20
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,560
The whole crew?

21
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,040
Isn't this my own problem?

22
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,359
I'll take the responsibility.

23
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:15,680
What does it have to do with you?

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,120
There's nothing we can do.

25
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,959
The notice has already been issued.

26
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:20,959
What else can we do?

27
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,159
I...

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'll think of a solution.

29
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,359
I have an idea.

30
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,840
I don't know if it'll work.

31
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,040
Hello, everyone.

32
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:36,840
I'm Lan Rui.

33
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,680
Glad to see you again in the studio.

34
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,319
The recent hot issue on the Internet

35
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:43,560
involves my friend.

36
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,000
So I invited her today

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,480
to my livestreaming room

38
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,120
to clarify this misunderstanding.

39
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:50,040
Haixian, come here.

40
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,040
Hello, everyone.

41
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,280
I'm Wang Haixian,

42
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,359
a flight attendant of Yucheng Airlines.

43
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,560
(Lan's livestreaming room)
On the Internet, there is a photo

44
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,200
of two people
seemingly kissing in a plane.

45
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:09,400
I'm one of the two people.

46
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,520
The photo just captured a moment.

47
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,199
This is what happened.

48
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:17,919
I...

49
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:21,520
I had some tricky problems in the cabin.

50
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,360
My colleague was comforting me.

51
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,680
At that time,
the plane encountered turbulence.

52
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,919
We just supported each other.

53
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:30,000
It's not what you saw

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,039
or said.

55
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,360
So...

56
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,240
Forget it.

57
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,199
Why do I think
they don't want to talk about this?

58
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:42,479
They're exiting the room.

59
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:44,319
No.

60
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:47,680
I've been doing
traditional-style livestreaming shows.

61
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:51,599
Maybe they're not interested
in this kind of thing.

62
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:53,840
What's the use of doing this?

63
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,319
Can it help us resume work?

64
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,439
Actually, Lan Rui is right.

65
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:01,400
The company grounded us

66
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,360
under the pressure of public opinion.

67
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,800
If we can turn the tide,

68
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,319
the company will address the issue

69
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:07,599
instead of avoiding it.

70
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,639
Only top livestreamers get viewers.

71
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,560
Who would like a livestreamer like us?

72
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:18,560
(Sharing from Wan's Manchurian Tiger)

73
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,439
The number of viewers is increasing.

74
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:24,280
When we were extras,

75
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,360
we went to the airline to be volunteers.

76
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,759
This young man and young lady

77
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,879
gave us a lot of help.

78
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,680
I believe they are innocent.

79
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,159
Wan's Manchurian Tiger.

80
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,639
It's them.

81
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,360
They still remember me.

82
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,400
Who are they?

83
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,960
They are so popular.

84
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,479
They're the extras who were replaced.

85
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:48,639
I remember now.

86
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,000
The bleeding ones.

87
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,599
- Yes.
- Right?

88
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:51,360
Yes.

89
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:52,280
Haixian.

90
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,520
Hurry. Sit in the middle.

91
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,960
Say it again.

92
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,159
- I'm nervous.
- Calm down.

93
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,680
What am I supposed to say?

94
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,879
Hello, guys. I'm Wang Haixian.

95
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,960
Hello, everyone. I'm Wang Haixian.

96
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,820
(Newsflash)

97
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,160
(Press Conference)
Hello, everyone.

98
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,279
There's a photo online
that appears to show

99
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:39,160
(our company's flight attendants
in a plane.)

100
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,160
(Namely, the kiss scandal.)

101
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,079
(This has
severely damaged our company's image.)

102
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:45,519
(According to our investigation
over the past week,)

103
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,279
(we've basically found out the truth.)

104
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,560
(A passenger slandered them)

105
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,160
due to his personal reasons.

106
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:52,399
(The investigation shows)

107
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,240
the two flight attendants

108
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,879
didn't violate
the company's basic rules.

109
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:58,879
(The photo was taken
by a male passenger.)

110
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,639
(He's under investigation
for harassing flight attendants.)

111
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,839
(So he held a grudge
against our crew members.)

112
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,240
On behalf of the company,

113
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,560
I announce the crew on the flight
can resume work.

114
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,319
Our company will take legal action
against those who spread rumors

115
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,120
to protect our personnel's interests.

116
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,439
Great.

117
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,480
Cool.

118
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,079
I can resume work.

119
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,279
It's okay.

120
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:23,879
That man looks so wretched.

121
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:27,000
That man looks so wretched.

122
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:28,879
Thank God. I was worried.

123
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:29,399
Really.

124
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:30,600
I was worried it'd be tricky.

125
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,639
Everyone, come here.

126
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,519
Any good news, Yan Yan?

127
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,680
This problem has been smoothly solved.

128
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:46,720
I want to tell you something.

129
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,959
I've finished my last flight

130
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:52,959
with you.

131
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,720
I never told you this.

132
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,879
I'm telling you today.

133
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,360
Whose birthday is it today?

134
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,240
Yan Yan,

135
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,439
you should've told us a better joke.

136
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:07,680
If you say the sky is falling,

137
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,759
I'll think what's wrong with the sky.

138
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,680
- I almost believed it.
- Come on.

139
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,480
That's right.

140
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,560
No.

141
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:17,160
I

142
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,160
have made up my mind.

143
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,680
I've been in this role for eight years.

144
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,040
It's long enough.

145
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,319
Yan Yan,

146
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:29,680
you're not joking?

147
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,959
T-Tell us

148
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,079
you're joking.

149
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,120
Because I didn't do well.

150
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:46,720
Is it because of me?

151
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:49,199
Is it because I didn't do well?

152
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:50,920
If so, I can work harder.

153
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,639
Look how hard I've worked.

154
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,120
Starting today, I will do well.

155
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,079
Is it because of someone else?

156
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:57,639
Yes.

157
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,360
Yes. Me too.

158
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,240
No. Everyone is outstanding.

159
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:07,360
I'm very proud of you all.

160
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:09,000
After I leave,

161
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:13,319
Huang Li,
you take over my position temporarily

162
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,279
until the new Chief Attendant comes,
okay?

163
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:19,199
I knew it.

164
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:22,199
Yan Yan, tell me the truth.

165
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,639
Did you use your position
in exchange for our places?

166
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,199
No. Why would I?

167
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,399
Stop lying to me.

168
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:34,240
You used your position
in exchange for our places.

169
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,120
I told you before.

170
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,120
We don't like others
giving us opportunities.

171
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,240
This is not giving.

172
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,399
If I'm better than you,

173
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,480
that's giving.

174
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,040
But all of you make me feel

175
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,480
you are very good

176
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:01,600
and very outstanding.

177
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,439
I'm proud of all of you.

178
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:17,160
I can't work with you forever.

179
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:20,560
We can work together forever.

180
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,199
Why can't we?

181
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,040
We can work together forever.
