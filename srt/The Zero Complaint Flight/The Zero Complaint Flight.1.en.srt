Sorry.

14
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:12,200
Sorry, sir.

15
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:18,319
I don't want
to be a flight attendant at all.

24
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:11,319
- Cool?
- Yes.

25
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,599
Your headset is cool too.

26
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:14,439
Where did you buy it?

27
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,759
Money can't buy this.

28
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,719
It's the first prize
of an esports competition.

29
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,520

- Yes.

30
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:21,599
Pretty interesting.

31
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,120
I want one.

32
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:26,479
Every time

33
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,240
Wang Haixian says "I want one",

34
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:30,759
she will get what she wants

35
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,280

This year's prize is very special.

49

It's an exclusively designed
limited-edition T-shirt.

50
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,840

Wait.

59
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:38,719
What happened?

60
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:40,360
Maybe she ate too much.

64

You'll find out soon.

You'll graduate in three days.

67

Instead of looking for a job,

68
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:01,280
you took part in an eating competition.

69
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,560
Are you crazy?

70
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,759
What's the rush

71
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:05,599

72
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,879
I plan to be a flight attendant.

73
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:09,680
I just signed up.

74
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,680
What's the fun?

75
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,639
Isn't it good to play?

76
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,960
You're like this
because your parents are abroad.

77
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,600
You need someone to discipline you.

78
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,720
What? This is a blessing.

79
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,639
Why don't you find a boyfriend?

80
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,240
At least he can take care of you, right?

81
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:26,319
Why do I need a boyfriend?

82
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:27,480
I'm doing fine on my own.

83

Hi.

87
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,439
I told you.

88
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,319
You forgot again.

89
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,240
- Thank you.
- No big deal.

90
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,279
He's mine.

91
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:07,240
Haixian,

92
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:08,879
it's such a coincidence.

93
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,879
Li Er also applied
for Yucheng Airlines' flight attendant.

94
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,399
Flight attendant?

95
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:14,439
Yes.

96
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,800
But I don't think
you can achieve your goal this time.

97
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:18,920
Why not?

98
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,759
Once we pass the interview,

99
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:24,000
we'll have to take
three-month pre-job training.

100
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:25,920
He won't have time to date you.

101
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,120
- I want to be a flight attendant.
- What?

102
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,040
I said I want to be a flight attendant.

103
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:35,399
Stop joking.

104
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:37,360
You think you can be one
just because you want to?

105
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:39,399
You'll have to take much training.

106
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,040
Even smiling needs to be trained.

107
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,800
Can you do it?

108
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:44,800
Like this?

109
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,480
Relax.

110
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,240
Relax your muscles.

111
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,600
Haixian, you...

112
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,639
Haixian, open your mouth.

113
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:02,560
Open your mouth.

I don't want Wang Haixian.

134
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,800
I think she's quite good.

135
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,600
Didn't you see her performance?

136
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:04,079
She came here with a purpose.

137

How can she do the job well?

138
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,360
She's very enthusiastic and relaxed.

139
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:09,680
She can handle pressure well.

140
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,800
This is what you think?

141
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,959
We should give her a chance

00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,040
