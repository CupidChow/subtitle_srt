=Episode 24=

3
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:46,520
I actually feel quite sorry for Ye Yang.

4
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:54,600
I didn't expect to miss his exhibition.

5
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:00,840
He said

6
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,359
he'd give me a gift
if I went to the exhibition.

7
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,359
I didn't expect

8
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:10,599
the gift was given in this way.

9
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,239
I think he knew
the good friend I mentioned

10
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:17,319
is you.

11
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,239
The friend who dreams of being a pilot.

12
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:23,640
Look.

13
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,079
Actually, I'm quite envious of you.

14
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,959
You are always fearless

15
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:47,959
and move forward bravely.

16
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:50,560
You're not like me.

17
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:53,959
I'm always hesitant.

18
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,599
Actually, I took the pilot exam once.

19
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:02,760
I failed.

20
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,479
I let my family down.

21
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:13,319
My parents have been working so hard

22
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:16,000
just to create better conditions

23
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:18,680
for me to realize my dream.

24
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,919
But I failed.

25
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:27,400
I don't have the courage to try again.

26
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,680
You faced it all alone, right?

27
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,120
But now you have everyone.

28
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:44,759
You have me.

29
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:49,919
Ye Yang has so many dreams
he wants to realize.

30
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:52,280
He could only draw them in paintings.

31
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:58,719
Our lives are so long.

32
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,560
We should strive to realize our dreams.

33
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:07,319
I feel sorry for Ye Yang.

34
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:12,199
Why don't we pluck up the courage

35
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,800
to move forward with this regret?

36
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,960
The journey of life is so long.

37
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,639
There's surely more than one opportunity

38
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:24,840
to do something.

39
00:03:40,612 --> 00:03:44,996
(Bravery isn't being fearless. It's
advancing despite the fear. By Ye Yang)

40
00:03:47,538 --> 00:03:49,807
(One year later)

41
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,280
Hello, everyone, I'm here.

42
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,960
I brought mutton rolls you all love.

43
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,680
- Thank you, Li.
- Li, you're here.

44
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,919
I'm taking the dishes there.

45
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:57,759
Okay.

46
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,039
Zhizhi.

47
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,280
Have you finished it?

48
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:01,840
Yes.

49
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,680
Then take it here.

50
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,599
Okay.

51
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,599
The fruit is ready.

52
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,080
- Today is...
- Wow.

53
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,919
Zhizhi, thank you. Put it here.

54
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:11,599
Am I good?

55
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,120
Good. You've improved.

56
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:17,079
Alright. Everything is ready.

57
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:19,759
We can start eating now.

58
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,639
Look who came with me.

59
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:23,720
- Yan Yan.
- Yan Yan.

60
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,279
I miss you so much.

61
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:30,639
I miss you guys too.

62
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,399
Let's go.

63
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:32,360
You've been fine, right?

64
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,279
- Yes.
- Yes.

65
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:33,959
What do we eat?

66
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,240
Hot pot.

67
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,600
Yan Yan, look.

68
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:37,560
It's spicy.

69
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,439
The soup is spicy.

70
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:38,959
Yes.

71
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:40,439
She prepared spicy soup for you.

72
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:41,959
She didn't prepare light soup for me.

73
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:43,279
It's been a long time, right?

74
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,920
- We've been waiting for you.
- We miss you so much.

75
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,160
Come on. Let's have a drink first.

76
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,959
Yan Yan just returned today.

77
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:52,000
Let's celebrate us being together again.

78
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,839
Okay.

79
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:53,519
Cheers.

80
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:56,040
Cheers.

81
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:01,000
This tastes good.

82
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,839
Yes.

83
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:03,480
Well,

84
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:04,600
today,

85
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,360
our cool master came here.

86
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,600
Of course we should prepare hot pot
to melt your heart.

87
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,360
That's right.

88
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,199
Wang Haixian is quite bold now.

89
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:15,680
She dares to joke about me.

90
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,959
But honestly,

91
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:21,360
all of us have witnessed
her growth and performance.

92
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,560
Besides,

93
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,879
Wang Haixian's changes

94
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:26,000
have led all of us to change.

95
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:27,959
That's right.

96
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:31,319
This is her unique personality charm.

97
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,680
Exactly.

98
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,120
That's right, Haixian.

99
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:35,040
Impressive.

100
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,759
If it weren't for you,

101
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:38,560
I would've gone home
to live off my parents.

102
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:40,720
What's going on?

103
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:42,319
I'm the Chief Attendant now.

104
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,680
Shouldn't you flatter me?

105
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:49,040
She has the Chief Attendant's demeanor.

106
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,000
Yes.

107
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:52,839
Among all of us in the team,

108
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,639
Li Er is the only one absent.

109
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:57,759
Does anyone know
where he has been these days?

110
00:05:58,279 --> 00:05:59,160
That's right.

111
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,000
He's been missing for so long.

112
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,720
Where did he go?

113
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,040
He's missing?

114
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,680
Haixian, should we call the police?

115
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:08,079
Master, stop joking.

116
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,759
Recently,

117
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,000
Li Er has been preparing
for something very important.

118
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,920
Let's wait for him.

119
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:16,839
Something very important.

120
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:18,920
To him

121
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,040
or to the two of you?

122
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,480
Li.

123
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,839
We haven't reached that stage yet.

124
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:24,759
No.

125
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:26,600
I'm going to drink.

126
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:29,360
- She's shy.
- She's shy.

Hello, I'm Huang Li,

00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:40,839

- Okay.

Understand?

137
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,240
Then that's all for it.

138
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,839

will fly from Fengcheng to Yucheng.

There could be turbulence.

143
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,480
Be careful.

144
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,160
A trainee will also join us today

145
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,399
as an observer.
