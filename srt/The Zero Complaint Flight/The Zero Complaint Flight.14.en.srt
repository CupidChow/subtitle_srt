=Episode 14=

3
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,759
You look so handsome in those clothes!

4
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:53,840
It fits you perfectly.

5
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,520
Come here.

6
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,679
Look in the mirror.

7
00:00:56,679 --> 00:00:58,359
See how handsome you look!

8
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,920
Really quite handsome.

9
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,560
Not happy?

10
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,400
What's wrong?

11
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,120
It's nothing.

12
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,719
Might be a bit of low blood sugar.

13
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:20,519
Wait a moment.

14
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,760
I have candies in my bag.

15
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:26,879
Have one.

16
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:29,159
Thank you.

17
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,359
No need.

18
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:38,280
Didn't expect Li Er to be
so handsome when dressed up.

19
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,480
I even feel a bit regretful.

20
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,879
Right, Li Er is just very handsome.

21
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:44,200
I think he's very suitable
to be a captain.

22
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:47,799
You're so fit to be a pilot.

23
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:49,680
Why don't you go take a test
to become a pilot?

24
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,480
The three-month training
is about to end soon.

25
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:58,280
This should be our last get-together.

26
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,159
Next, we have to prepare well
for the exam.

27
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,640
Li Er, are you drinking today?

28
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,200
Will you carry me?

29
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,919
I'm a handsome guy
who's allergic to alcohol.

30
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,360
My tolerance for alcohol is terrible.

31
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:12,919
I propose

32
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,319
that each of us makes a wish.

33
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,479
It's not a birthday. Why make wishes?

34
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,560
Exactly.

35
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,879
Why can't we
even if it's not a birthday?

36
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,639
I'm going to make one today
no matter what.

37
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,840
My wish is to pass the exam
smoothly next week

38
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:32,120
and then be a good flight attendant.

39
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:36,960
I hope that we can get together
for a meal every week.

40
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,120
- Next time, take Ms. Yan with us.
- Okay.

41
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,960
By the way, do you know?

42
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,639
I saw Ms. Yan secretly watching

43
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:46,639
some short videos about horseshoeing.

44
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:47,759
Horseshoeing?

45
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:51,840
Horseshoeing is, like, for horse hooves.

46
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,159
Right, it's those stress-relief videos.

47
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,319
Didn't expect Ms. Yan to have this side.

48
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:59,080
What was her expression when watching?

49
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,680
Of course,

50
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,240
she was expressionless.

51
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,199
Oh, my goodness.

52
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:12,199
But I think Ms. Yan
has a lot on her mind.

53
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,039
The last time I took Li Er back,

54
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,159
I saw her drowning her sorrows there.

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,120
It seemed her mood was not very good.

56
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,120
I suddenly remember the captain
told me about this before.

57
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,879
Ms. Yan got divorced six months ago.

58
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,919
Then she must be feeling very lonely.

59
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:30,479
And it seems her birthday
is coming up soon.

60
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:34,280
Her birthday.

61
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:53,080
Let's go.

62
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:58,360
I have something to do, so I'm leaving.

63
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,919
Take your time and enjoy.

64
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:00,759
What's the matter?

65
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:01,960
Still having fun here.

66
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,000
You have something to do.

67
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,879
I don't.

68
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:05,719
You do.

You've been quite serious lately.

Put me down.

74
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:35,040
Put me down.

75
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,439
I'm fine now.

00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,360
I really enjoy
being a flight attendant now.

79
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,759
I used to do things
that were meaningless.

80
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,959
I never really put my heart
into achieving results.

81
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:56,560
I know.

82
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,759
You have no idea

83
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,600
what ridiculous efforts I've made
to achieve certain results.

84
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,800
Like hiring a professional team
to play matches for you.

85
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,959
How do you know that?

86
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,879
To tell the truth,

87
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:22,120
at first, I signed up to be
a flight attendant because of you.

88
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,279
But...

89
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,800
But after three months of training,

90
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:32,160
I found that being a flight attendant
was very interesting.

91
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:40,720
So I am going to work hard
to become a good flight attendant.

92
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:56,519
Are you okay?

93
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,160
How is it?

94
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,800
I did well just now, right?

95
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,959
It's only because I reminded you.

96
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:03,600
Don't mess up with them dating.

97
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:05,279
How could we mess up with them?

98
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:06,920
I wanted to play for a bit longer.

99
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,319
When can't they...?

100
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:11,839
Alright, it's fine.

101
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,079
We'll have fun another day.

102
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:13,639
