=Episode 23=

3
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,079
Hello.

4
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,200
Hello, Haixian.

5
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,640
H-How is Ye Yang?

6
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,439
He's no longer in critical condition.

7
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,759
That's good.

8
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:54,439
He has arrived safely.

9
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,240
Great. I can rest assured.

10
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,479
Don't worry.

11
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,840
Thank you.

12
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,159
No big deal.

13
00:01:13,476 --> 00:01:17,290
(Three months later)

14
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:25,536
(Ye Yang)

15
00:01:30,447 --> 00:01:31,680
(My exhibition was successful.
But you didn't come.)

16
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,248
(I have a gift for you. See you
on the plane the day after tomorrow.)

17
00:01:36,684 --> 00:01:37,504
(Great. I'm happy for you.
I didn't come due to work.)

18
00:01:37,504 --> 00:01:38,322
(But there'll be another chance.
See you on the plane.)

19
00:01:39,492 --> 00:01:42,877
(Is the friend you mentioned
doing better lately?)

20
00:01:46,664 --> 00:01:51,200
(Haixian, I want to talk to you.)

21
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,047
(How are you these days?)

22
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,960
The cabin door is about to close.

23
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,680
Ground agent deplanes.

24
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,319
Ground agent deplanes.

25
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,680
Chief Attendant.

26
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,120
A passenger hasn't boarded the plane.

27
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:02,680
Chief Attendant.

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,879
Ye Yang hasn't boarded the plane yet.

29
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,439
You know Ye Yang?

30
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:15,439
Hello, Ma'am.

31
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:16,639
Are you with him?

32
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:17,599
We're about to take off.

33
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,759
Can you reach him?

34
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,120
The night before last,

35
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,199
Ye Yang passed away.

36
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:29,680
Thank you for today.

37
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,039
Next time I hold an art exhibition,

38
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,360
I really hope you can come.

39
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,960
Of course I will go.

40
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,360
You must go.

41
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:43,400
Pinky promise.

42
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,560
Pinky promise.

43
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,280
I look forward to it.

44
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:47,240
Me too.

45
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,319
Little girl,

46
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,520
what did you put here?

47
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,319
Why did you put it here?

48
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,599
This is really frightening.

49
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,400
Take it away.

50
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,479
We finally have a chance
to take a flight.

51
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:09,240
How could you put this thing here?

52
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,280
It's ominous.

53
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,319
That's right.

54
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:11,879
What's it for?

55
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:12,680
What's going on?

56
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,360
Take it away.

57
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,680
- What's going on?
- Take it away.

58
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,360
Take it away.

59
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,360
Take it away now.

60
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:16,879
It's ominous.

61
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:17,759
Take it away.

62
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:22,560
- What are you doing?
- What's wrong with you?

63
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,959
How could you do this?

64
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:25,920
Take it away.

65
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,639
Take it away now.

66
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:27,560
I'll handle it.

67
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,519
Everyone, calm down.

68
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,240
Hello, Ma'am.

69
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,720
Take all your belongings
and come with me.

70
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:35,519
Sorry.

71
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,279
Please sit here for now.

72
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,199
What is wrong

73
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:55,319
with you?

74
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:57,519
This is ridiculous.

75
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:08,600
Everyone, please be seated.

76
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,399
The door will close immediately.

77
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,680
The plane is about to take off.

78
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,399
For your safety,

79
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,759
please cooperate.

80
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,720
Come on.

81
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,079
Deal with it now.

82
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:24,360
I want to file a complaint.

83
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,319
Miss, please sit here for now.

84
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,319
Sir.

85
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,639
Sir, excuse me.

86
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,360
What's up? I was sleeping.

87
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,600
- It's you.
- It's you.

88
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,279
What a coincidence.

89
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,360
I didn't see you when I came in.

90
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,319
It's you two.

91
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,360
What's wrong?

92
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,639
Here's the thing.

93
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,720
There is a special situation.

94
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,879
We need to make an exception.

95
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:51,480
Go ahead.

96
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,720
This lady's boyfriend

97
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:55,800
passed away.

98
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,560
We need a place

99
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,079
for her boyfriend's ashes.

100
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:02,319
Can you...

101
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,639
To be honest,

102
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,879
this is a bit...

103
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:15,199
Isn't this Haixian?

104
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:16,720
You're still here?

105
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,839
Why are you crying?

106
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,000
Miss, it's fine.
Put it anywhere you like.

107
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
We don't mind at all.

108
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,240
It's really okay.

109
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,480
We are friends.

110
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,120
It's fine.

111
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,040
Yes. Put it anywhere you like.

112
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,720
It's okay.

113
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,519
Thank you.

114
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:38,279
No big deal.

115
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:39,240
Don't stand on ceremony.

116
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:42,759
If you hadn't said
we could be popular by working together,

117
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,800
we wouldn't have succeeded.

118
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,480
Thank you.

119
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:47,720
That's right.

120
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,160
Without you, Wan's Manchurian Tiger
wouldn't have existed.

121
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,680
We are good friends.

122
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,720
I thank you on behalf of Ye Yang.

123
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,120
No need for that.

124
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:02,800
The plane will take off soon.

125
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,040
Take seats first.

126
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:06,120
Let me help you.

127
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,040
Thank you.

128
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,120
Are you Wang Haixian?

129
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:14,560
Yes.

130
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,959
Ye Yang told me about it.

131
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:18,040
Sorry to have troubled you.

132
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,680
Thank you very much for your care.

133
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,000
This is Ye Yang's last work
before he passed away.

134
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,240
He specially asked me
to find a chance to give it to you.

135
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,720
Luckily, I met you here today.

136
00:07:37,305 --> 00:07:41,037
(Bravery isn't being fearless.
It's advancing despite the fear. By Ye Yang)

137
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,240
Thank you.

138
00:07:56,451 --> 00:07:59,000
(Bravery isn't being fearless.
It's advancing despite the fear. By Ye Yang)

139
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,040
Thank you.

140
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:11,879
