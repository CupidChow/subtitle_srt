=Episode 22=

3
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:44,479
It's okay.

4
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,640
Yan Yan is no longer a flight attendant,

5
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,799
but we can still meet up in the future.

6
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:54,520
I just feel

7
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,320
I drove Yan Yan away.

8
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,640
Don't think like that.

9
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,920
She already told us why.

10
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:04,439
Don't blame yourself.

11
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,040
Besides,

12
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,840
you still have me.

13
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,799
I can accompany you in the future.

14
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:13,680
H-How?

15
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:16,159
Just like now.

16
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:18,760
Being a flight attendant?

17
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,560
Yes. Isn't it good?

18
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:26,799
You're supposed to become a pilot.

19
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:28,719
I...

20
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,280
Didn't you say you'd take the exam?

21
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:33,640
Why did you give up?

22
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,760
I don't have to become a pilot.

23
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:38,480
Why?

24
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,359
How can you just give up?

25
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,239
I can be with you in this way.

26
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,760
I don't need you to be with me.

27
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,879
You've wanted to be a pilot.

28
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,480
Do what you want to do.

29
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,319
I've become a burden again.

30
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,879
No.

31
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:00,719
Li Er,

32
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,640
you want to become a pilot.

33
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,840
You clearly want to be a pilot.

34
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,080
When we talked about it,
you had a spark in your eyes.

35
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,680
Why did you just give up?

36
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,719
Why did you say it's because of me?

37
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,280
I already think
Yan Yan left because of me.

38
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:19,919
Why are you also making me think
I'm a burden?

39
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,280
No, that's not what I mean.

40
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,000
You're not the Li Er I know.

41
00:02:32,823 --> 00:02:34,981
(Cabin Crew Training)

42
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,960
Yan Yan will no longer work with us,

43
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,439
but the goal of our zero-complaint team
will never change.

44
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,199
I'll be
the acting Chief Attendant from today.

45
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,199
Let's work hard together.

46
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:57,360
We have fewer passengers today.

47
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,199
We'll be under less pressure relatively.

48
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:00,319
But we can't slack off.

49
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,360
Because the captain is very strict.

50
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:02,960
Wang Haixian,

51
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,240
help them in business class today.

52
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,879
I've never worked in business class.

53
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:11,719
I'll stay in economy class.

54
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,560
Wang Haixian, obey the order.

55
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:21,439
Okay.

56
00:03:31,601 --> 00:03:34,501
(Exit)

57
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,680
Hello, sir, how can I help you?

58
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,120
Looks like he's not feeling well.

59
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,039
Hello, sir, what's wrong?

60
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,800
Could you help me look after him?

61
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,960
I'll tell Chief Attendant. Thanks.

62
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,000
Okay, no problem.

63
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,719
Ladies and gentlemen,

64
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:53,520
a passenger is feeling unwell

65
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,240
and in urgent need of medical attention.

66
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,479
If you are a doctor or a nurse,

67
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:58,400
please contact us immediately.
Thank you.

68
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,080
Where?

69
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,800
Thank you.

70
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,439
This one.

71
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:05,560
Please.

72
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,039
Hello, can you hear me clearly?

73
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,560
How are you feeling now?

74
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,319
So hot.

75
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,120
A fever.

76
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,759
So dizzy.

77
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:12,520
Dizziness.

78
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:13,759
No strength.

79
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:14,319
Fatigue.

80
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,439
Any underlying condition?

81
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,519
What?

82
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,800
This is hemophagocytic syndrome.

83
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,600
Where're your pills?

84
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:20,600
In the bag.

85
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,360
Bag? Where?

86
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,160
On the luggage rack?

87
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,959
Yes.

88
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:23,680
Hurry.

89
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:25,439
The medicine box.

90
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:26,399
It's empty.

91
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,639
Do you have any other medicine?

92
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:30,639
- All my backup medicine is
- Where?

93
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,399
in the checked luggage.

94
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:34,079
How often should you take the medicine?

95
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:35,360
Every five hours.

96
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,839
When was the last time you took it?

97
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,439
Before boarding.

98
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:39,360
Before boarding.

99
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,560
Before boarding. Three hours.

100
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,480
I'll ask the captain.

101
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,439
Okay, thank you.

102
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,800
Ladies and gentlemen,

103
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,680
who has medicine
for hemophagocytic syndrome?

104
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,480
Please help him. Who has it?

105
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,079
Captain, a passenger is feeling unwell.

106
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,399
His life could be in danger.

107
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:56,000
Can you contact a nearby city
with emergency medical facilities

108
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,040
so that we can land?

109
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,680
- Who has it?
- No.

110
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,600
No one has it?

111
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,000
- Hello.
- We're 3 hours from the destination.

112
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,279
There're no airports
with medical facilities nearby.

113
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:07,079
Sir, you can't fall asleep.

114
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:07,959
What should we do now?

115
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,000
You have to move him

116
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,279
- to a roomy and quiet place.
- Roomy.

117
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,040
Keep him awake.

118
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,800
Keep him awake.

119
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,519
Yes. Keep him awake before getting off.

120
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:15,120
Okay. Li Er.

121
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:16,240
Li Er, come here.

122
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,079
Doctor, thank you.

123
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:17,759
Move him to first class

124
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:18,279
with Haixian.

125
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:18,879
Hello.

126
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:19,920
Try to stand up.

127
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,759
Give it a try.

128
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:21,439
One, two.

129
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,680
Come on, try.

130
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,839
Stand up, I'll help you.

131
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:31,000
Doctor, is he better now?

132
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,000
Are you okay?

133
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,800
- Sir.
- Have some hot water.

134
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,720
Have some hot water.

135
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,879
Be careful.

136
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,600
Feeling better?

137
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:40,879
Much better.

138
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,360
Keep him company.

139
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,639
You have to keep him awake.

140
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:45,040
Okay, doctor, thank you.

141
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,839
Please come with me.

142
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,000
It's okay. Call me if there's a problem.

143
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,839
Okay. You two stay with him here.

144
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:49,720
Okay, no problem.

145
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,959
Sir.

146
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:59,040
Sir, don't fall asleep.

147
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,759
Sir.

148
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:02,800
How are you feeling now?

149
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,920
I'm fine.

150
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,879
Can we have a chat?

151
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,360
Sure.

152
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:13,639
Okay. I wonder

153
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:18,639
if you're on a trip
or on your way home this time.

154
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,279
I just finished an art exhibition.

155
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,240
I'm on my way home.

156
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,519
Art exhibition?

157
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:25,279
Are you a painter?

158
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,480
Not really.

159
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:30,079
Just someone who paints.

160
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,240
I...

161
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,480
Sir, wake up.

162
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,360
Sir.

163
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,079
I wanted to be a painter
when I was little.

164
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:42,720
My mother sent me to training classes

165
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,680
to learn to draw oil paintings.

166
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,839
When I went home,

167
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,279
my face was covered with oil paint.

168
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:48,279
They took photos of me.

169
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:50,959
They mocked me
and said "look at what you've painted."

170
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:52,279
"You have no talent at all".

171
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:54,839
So I... I didn't become a painter.

172
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:58,199
So I've always envied those
who can paint well.

173
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,120
Thank you.

174
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,920
Sir, wake up.

175
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,439
Sir.

176
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:09,240
Do you have works for me to look at?

177
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,319
I have some in my bag.

178
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:12,879
Just lie down. Let me get them.

179
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:14,079
Your bag is...

180
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,360
This one?

181
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,120
Please unlock it.

182
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,000
I drew all these.

183
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,000
Let me see.

184
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,079
You drew this?

185
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:29,959
Sir.

186
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,639
Can I sit here

187
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:34,920
and look at the paintings?

188
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:36,879
Sure.

189
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:38,160
Okay. I'm going to sit here.

190
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:42,600
These are all your paintings?

191
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,720
I can look at all of them?

192
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,680
Yes.

193
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,399
Okay.

194
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,160
Ye Yang.

195
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,680
Your name is Ye Yang?

196
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,279
Yes. My name is Ye Yang.

197
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:59,519
But not these two Chinese characters.

198
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,399
I prefer to write my name like this

199
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,279
because it means the sun at night.

200
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:05,680
It's also my pen name.

201
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,160
- The sun at night?
- Yes.

202
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,199
Sunshine.

203
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,720
No wonder each of your paintings

204
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,959
has a sun-drenched background.

205
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,279
They can give people hope.

206
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,639
When is your next art exhibition?

207
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,639
In three months. In Yucheng.

208
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:25,199
Yucheng?

209
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:27,639
Yucheng is my hometown.

210
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:29,199
- I can go.
- Really?

211
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:30,800
I can go and see for myself.

212
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,039
I really like this painting.

213
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:33,840
That's great.

214
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,720
You must come

215
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:38,080
if I still have a chance.

216
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:46,480
Sir.

217
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,360
Ye Yang.

218
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,159
Is becoming a painter your dream?

219
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,399
I wouldn't call it a dream.

220
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:02,600
Since I was diagnosed
with this disease at 12,

221
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,639
I've been accepting treatment
and taking medicine.

222
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,039
I couldn't do what other kids

223
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:09,559
could do.

224
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,039
Even walking out of that door

225
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,720
was very difficult for me.

226
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:18,799
So,

227
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:21,120
I would draw

228
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,840
what I want to do,

229
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,200
what I see,

230
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,440
and what I think.

231
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,440
I don't know if that counts as a dream.

232
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:34,600
But it's also a way to pursue my dream.

233
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:49,519
You...

234
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,200
No.

235
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,759
Your story

236
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,519
reminds me

237
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,919
of a good friend of mine.

238
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,000
He

239
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:06,120
obviously can realize his dream.

240
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,759
But...

241
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,799
But he gave up.

242
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,720
Perhaps your friend has his reasons.

243
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,559
Pursuing a dream

244
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,879
requires a lot of courage.

245
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,080
But I believe

246
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:24,320
as long as he has a dream,

247
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:28,120
he can definitely pick it up.

248
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:35,919
Thank you for today.

249
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,240
Next time I hold an art exhibition,

250
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:43,519
I really hope you can come.

251
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:46,240
Of course I'll go.

252
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:47,720
You must go.

253
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:49,639
Pinky promise.

254
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:50,840
Pinky promise.

255
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,600
I look forward to it.

256
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:53,559
Me too.
