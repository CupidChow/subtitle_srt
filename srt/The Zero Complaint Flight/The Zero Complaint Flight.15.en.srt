=Episode 15=

3
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,679
Good luck with our exam.

4
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:46,159
I'm so satisfied.

5
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:47,000
Yum.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,479
It's finally over. I'm exhausted.

7
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:49,439
We're free now.

8
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,119
Wang Haixian,

9
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:53,280
you did great recently.

10
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:54,920
Seems you'll soon outdo me.

11
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,799
I know.

12
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,880
Yeah, you didn't see
the way Demon Yan looks at you,

13
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:01,520
just like watching her daughter.

14
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,599
Why don't we just call her Mama Yan?

15
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,680
Mama Yan.

16
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,239
You're quite good with nicknames.

17
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:11,280
Now we finished our exams.

18
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:15,519
When do we start
with Mama Yan's birthday plan?

19
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:16,560
What do you think?

20
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:21,239
We all follow Captain Wang's lead.

21
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:22,319
Agreed.

22
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:23,439
Okay, I'm okay with that.

23
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:24,680
Alright then.

24
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,599
Yucheng Airlines' Special Meeting

25
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:32,640
starts officially right now.

26
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,280
(We just finished the exam today.)

27
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,760
(Mama Yan must be in the office
reviewing our exam papers.)

28
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,640
As usual,

29
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,200
at 3:00 PM,

30
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,680
she will head to the gym on time.

31
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:49,200
At this time,

32
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,200
she is most relaxed.

33
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,079
So we can make our move.

00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:17,680
It's 2:30 PM now.

41
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,680
I told you we shouldn't have eaten.

42
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,879
Wait a minute, Zhizhi.

43
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:25,800
I have a plan.

44
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,176
(Wang drank a non-alcoholic beverage.
Don't drive after drinking.)

45
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,080
Has Wang Haixian always been this cool?

46
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:54,240
Stick to the plan.

47
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:56,159
What?

48
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:57,560
Invitation.

49
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,759
Did they forget something?

50
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:12,360
I told you to take the invitation card.

51
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,520
How come you can't do anything right?

52
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,759
Let's just stick to the facts.

53
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:21,080
I can do things right.

54
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:22,800
I thought you would take it.

55
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:24,280
I...

56
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,800
Li Er.

57
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:31,919
Ms. Yan.

58
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:32,759
Why are you here?

59
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:34,680
I-I work out here.

60
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,280
Work out?

61
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,960
You should go relax after the exam.

62
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,840
I'm relaxed.

63
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,719
Plan B.

64
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:46,879
Plan B.

65
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,439
Taking a picture here?

66
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,759
No.

67
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,479
Did I just see Wang Haixian?

68
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,240
No way.

69
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,840
I came by myself.

70
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,759
You must be wrong.

71
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,319
Why aren't you two together?

72
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,599
She-she drank too much and cried.

73
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,560
Cried?

74
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,159
Why?

75
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,280
She did well in the exam.

76
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,080
Why?

77
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,120
I-I don't know.

78
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,399
She kept crying anyway.

79
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,399
I-I...

80
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,360
I'll send the address.

81
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,160
See you in a bit.

82
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,800

96
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:21,879
Anyway, thanks, everyone.

97
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:23,120
I had a good time.

98
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,439
Ms. Yan.

You look good when you smile.

100
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:27,839
Please smile more.

101
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,959
Exactly.

102
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:31,120
I am always smiling at work.

103
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,120
Ms. Yan.

104
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:36,439
That's not your genuine smile,

105
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,360
right?

106
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,319
Everybody knows

107
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:41,160
that's your fake smile at work.

108
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,480
Like this.

109
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,120
Is there really a difference?

110
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,240
It's my genuine smile
when I smile at passengers.

111
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,079
Ms. Yan.

112
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:50,240
To be honest,

113
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,920
I admire you a lot.

114
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,079
One day,

115
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:02,000
I want to become an excellent

116
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,079
and amazing flight attendant like you.

117
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,879
You will.

118
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:07,920
Everyone will.

119
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:09,600
Our next flight

120
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,839
won't be in a flight simulator.

121
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,759
The problems we have
will be more complicated,

122
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,600
so we need to be more careful
when we handle them.

123
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,839
Ms. Yan.

124
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,000
We're chilling here,

125
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,600
and you're giving everyone a lesson.

126
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,800
I'll stop. Come on.

127
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,319
I will drink it all,

128
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,160
Suit yourself.

129
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:27,920
So bottoms up.

130
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,600
I'm in.

131
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,360
Drink it together.
