=Episode 13=

3
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:43,240
The training will end
in less than a month.

4
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,799
Everyone must not slack off.

5
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,079
In addition
to the cabin service training,

6
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,640
physical fitness is also very important
for us flight attendants.

7
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,119
Everyone should exercise well.

8
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:54,560
Improve your physical fitness.

9
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,320
I will come to check later.

10
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:58,399
Where did you go last night?

11
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,479
When did you come back?

12
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,239
You're too frail.

13
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:07,959
Train more.

14
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,360
Boss, another bottle, please.

15
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:51,080
What's wrong with you?

16
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,599
Xiao Zhizhi, support him.

17
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,800
Over here.

18
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:55,879
I'll take him back.

19
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:56,800
I told you not to drink.

20
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,120
Why did you drink so much?

21
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,199
Don't drink with him.

22
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,360
Support him.

23
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,000
I told you not to drink so much.

24
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:05,879
Why did you drink so much?

25
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,280
Ms. Y...

26
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,280
Ms. Yan.

27
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:27,960
Am I manly or not?

28
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:30,120
Ms. Yan.

29
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,439
He hit his head when playing basketball.

30
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:34,240
Just ignore him.

31
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,479
He's gone mad.

32
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:38,960
Ignore him.

33
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:53,159
You've made Ms. Yan sick to her stomach.

34
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,639
Such a strong smell of alcohol.

35
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,919
How come I'm here?

36
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,240
Get up.

37
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,719
Get up.

38
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:06,719
Why are you here?

39
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:07,960
I carried you back.

40
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,039
Where's Wang Haixian?

41
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:13,960
You're so heavy.

42
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,400
She can't carry you.

43
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,720
She lifts dumbbells heavier than I am.

44
00:04:23,705 --> 00:04:26,220
(Poster Shooting Day)

45
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:51,240
Why did you refuse the poster shooting?

46
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,600
I need to work properly.

47
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,360
Just work?

48
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,040
Yes, only work from now on.

49
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,600
I will be a person who works hard.

50
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,600
I'll be a good flight attendant
24 hours a day.

51
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,560
Mr. Wang,

52
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,040
The female model still hasn't arrived.

53
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,240
Hurry and urge her.

54
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,759
I called her, but no one answered.

55
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,079
(I don't want your pity.)

56
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,480
(Hurry to the studio.)

57
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,759
(Otherwise, Li Er
will have to shoot alone.)

58
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,680
Huang Li.

59
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,879
Huang Li.

60
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:35,600
Hurry, or you'll be late.

61
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,959
Be an adult, Huang Li.

62
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,879
Don't be angry. I'm still hurrying her.

63
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,160
Let's wait a bit longer.

64
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,680
Look at the time.

65
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,839
Acting like a diva?

66
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:53,639
I'm leaving.

67
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,199
Mr. Wang, don't get angry.

68
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,560
Let's wait a little longer.

69
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,279
Wait a moment.

70
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,319
I'm here.

71
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,759
Okay, let's start shooting now.

72
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,040
Nice.

73
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,399
Nice, yes.

74
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:13,439
Nice.

75
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:14,959
You can move a bit closer.

76
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:15,680
Right.

77
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,639
Good.

78
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,199
Very much like a couple.

79
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,240
Why is it you who is here?

80
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:25,120
Huang Li, for some reason,
suddenly isn't coming.

81
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,720
All my good intentions were wasted.

82
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,920
You gave it to her?

83
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,160
What else?

84
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,680
She was crying like that.

85
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,040
Might as well let her come shoot.

86
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:35,120
Just because of this?

87
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:36,360
What else?

88
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,079
You wouldn't think I didn't come

89
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:41,279
just to avoid you, would you?

90
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:43,720
No wonder you've been acting
so strange lately.

91
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,240
Are you a fool?

92
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:47,399
When the basketball
is stuck in the hoop,

93
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:49,279
it was me who helped you
with the shoe...

94
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:50,519
Don't bring that up.

95
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,519
The ball got stuck in the hoop.

96
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:54,600
Look at you.

97
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,360
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

98
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:00,279
One, two, three.

99
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,319
I'm exhausted.

100
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,360
I really don't fit for this job.

101
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:20,079
Excuse me.

102
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:23,360
Today, the model as the pilot

103
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,560
can't come for some reason.

104
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,000
Can you give it a try for us?

105
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:41,680
That pilot uniform looks
pretty handsome.

106
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,160
It's more stylish than ours.

107
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,199
Try putting it on.
