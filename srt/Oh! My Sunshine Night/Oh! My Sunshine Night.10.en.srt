1
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,440
Now's the last game of the night.

2
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,480
The first person you see face to face

3
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,920
will be named your 'soul mate.'

4
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,600
This is just

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,360
a child's play.

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,200
Don't tell me you believe it?

7
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,280
Kim.

8
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,200
Sun!

9
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,120
Sun!

10
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:23,880
Sun!

11
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,400
Help!

12
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,480
Anybody's here?

13
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,480
Help!

14
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:29,680
Sun!

15
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,240
Sun.

16
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,200
Sun.

17
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:34,760
Sun.

18
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,360
Sun, wake up.

19
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:37,520
Sun.

20
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:41,720
Sun!

21
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,280
What happened?!

22
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,680
He's panic attack from his heart disease.

23
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,960
He needs medicine, apple, or someone he can rely on.

24
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,920
I'll be hurry and get medicine for him.

25
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,160
You'll be okay, Sun.

26
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:58,920
Sun.

27
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,360
Can you hear me?

28
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,640
Sun.

29
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,400
Sun.

30
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,920
Wake up, Sun.

31
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:09,960
Sun.

32
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:18,920
Sun.

33
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,240
Sun.

34
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,480
Sun.

35
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:24,800
Sun.

36
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,120
Wake up.

37
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,800
Come back.

38
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,000
Sun.

39
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,720
Please be okay.

40
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,320
Medicine and apples are coming.

41
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,600
Can you hear me?

42
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,080
Sun.

43
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,600
Come back.

44
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,000
Sun!

45
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,200
Kim.

46
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,560
You're okay now.

47
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,000
It's okay.

48
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,560
Sun!

49
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:16,800
It's okay.

50
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,280
It's okay.

51
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,280
It's okay.

52
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,960
Don't go, Rain.

53
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,480
I should leave.

54
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,200
I walked here.

55
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,960
So, I should go.

56
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:52,760
Rain.

57
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,360
What do I have to do

58
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,560
to make you stay?

59
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,120
Please tell me.

60
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,600
I have nothing to say.

61
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,000
I told you

62
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,760
that I came here

63
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,160
because of you.

64
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,960
Just you.

65
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,600
And I already told you.

66
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,640
Don't stay because of me.

67
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,120
Because I'm leaving.

68
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,480
Right now,

69
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,400
I'm very honest.

70
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,560
I won't betray my own heart.

71
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,080
I won't change my mind either.

72
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:14,720
And?

73
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,360
You doing this.

74
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,320
It hurts like hell.

75
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,000
Damn you.

76
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:12,880
Mr. Rain.

77
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,000
Mr. Rain.

78
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,680
I understand now

79
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,280
how hurt it is.

80
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,200
Mr. Rain.

81
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,560
Kim.

82
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,440
Do you have anything to say to me?

83
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:55,053
Anyone would do that.

84
00:11:56,293 --> 00:11:57,133
You're overthinking.

85
00:11:59,893 --> 00:12:00,813
Need the key?

86
00:12:02,373 --> 00:12:02,733
No.

87
00:12:03,613 --> 00:12:04,453
I'm waiting for you.

88
00:12:06,373 --> 00:12:06,893
For me?

89
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:09,013
Why?

90
00:12:10,853 --> 00:12:13,093
I've always been waiting for you.

91
00:12:14,573 --> 00:12:16,813
Just a little bit more would be fine.

92
00:12:21,573 --> 00:12:22,813
Damn you.

93
00:12:23,373 --> 00:12:24,333
What do you want?

94
00:12:27,173 --> 00:12:28,413
I don't want anything.

95
00:12:29,573 --> 00:12:30,413
You know it.

96
00:12:32,133 --> 00:12:32,893
Really?

97
00:12:34,973 --> 00:12:36,013
If you say it

98
00:12:36,973 --> 00:12:38,333
from your heart,

99
00:12:41,573 --> 00:12:42,853
there won't be Kim.

100
00:12:45,253 --> 00:12:48,053
But if you never give your heart a chance,

101
00:12:49,653 --> 00:12:50,573
how would you know

102
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,573
whom you want to be with?

103
00:13:06,573 --> 00:13:06,853
I...

104
00:13:08,493 --> 00:13:09,613
You are having fun.

105
00:13:10,933 --> 00:13:11,373
Huh?

106
00:13:12,653 --> 00:13:13,813
Playing with my feelings.

107
00:13:19,213 --> 00:13:20,453
I'm not having fun with you.

108
00:13:25,213 --> 00:13:25,853
I have feelings.

109
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,093
Damn you.

110
00:15:18,173 --> 00:15:19,533
You're Master Rain.

111
00:15:21,133 --> 00:15:22,093
You're a man.

112
00:15:24,733 --> 00:15:25,693
Mr. Rain.

113
00:15:26,253 --> 00:15:27,253
You're my master.

114
00:15:28,013 --> 00:15:29,013
I'm a man too.

115
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:36,533
We shouldn't...

116
00:15:36,653 --> 00:15:37,693
It's not weird at all.

117
00:15:53,413 --> 00:15:53,933
Payoo.

118
00:15:58,213 --> 00:15:59,413
I want to explain...

119
00:16:35,093 --> 00:16:36,093
You kissed me

120
00:16:38,013 --> 00:16:39,573
to stop me from talking?

121
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:44,253
No.

122
00:18:57,813 --> 00:18:58,213
Sun.

123
00:19:02,173 --> 00:19:02,893
You...

124
00:19:04,053 --> 00:19:04,933
How are you?

125
00:19:06,653 --> 00:19:07,413
Are you okay?

126
00:19:17,373 --> 00:19:18,733
I'm scared.

127
00:19:21,173 --> 00:19:23,213
I'm scared to die.

128
00:19:25,413 --> 00:19:27,093
When it's really happening,

129
00:19:28,533 --> 00:19:29,893
I'm frightened.

130
00:19:31,453 --> 00:19:33,533
I now know how frightening death is.

131
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:38,053
It's scary for both the dead

132
00:19:39,453 --> 00:19:40,893
and the living.

133
00:19:54,253 --> 00:19:54,813
Sun.

134
00:19:57,253 --> 00:19:58,133
It's okay now.

135
00:20:00,573 --> 00:20:01,453
I'm right here.

136
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,253
I won't let anything happen to you.

137
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:21,733
I promise.

138
00:20:36,733 --> 00:20:37,693
Don't leave me.

139
00:20:40,093 --> 00:20:41,453
Thank you.

140
00:22:00,173 --> 00:22:01,933
I don't know what tomorrow will bring.

141
00:22:04,453 --> 00:22:05,533
Why do you care?

142
00:22:08,893 --> 00:22:09,413
Right.

143
00:22:10,373 --> 00:22:12,573
Just be happy with today.

144
00:22:15,693 --> 00:22:16,653
So... today,

145
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:18,413
Are you happy now?

146
00:22:22,053 --> 00:22:22,813
I don't know.

147
00:22:23,453 --> 00:22:26,813
I don't know if this is happiness or not.

148
00:22:29,813 --> 00:22:30,453
How?

149
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:34,973
Umm...

150
00:22:35,773 --> 00:22:37,133
It's like there's a hole inside.

151
00:22:38,053 --> 00:22:39,213
Like I can't breathe properly.

152
00:22:40,093 --> 00:22:40,373
Hey.

153
00:22:41,053 --> 00:22:42,493
Don't tell me it's happening again?

154
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:44,093
No.

155
00:22:44,933 --> 00:22:45,733
Not like that.

156
00:22:47,893 --> 00:22:49,053
But it's from the same place.

157
00:22:52,253 --> 00:22:53,253
Same place...

158
00:22:55,893 --> 00:22:56,413
Where?

159
00:23:08,013 --> 00:23:09,573
I should go to bed now.

160
00:23:10,173 --> 00:23:11,173
We have morning schedule.

161
00:23:12,573 --> 00:23:12,893
No.

162
00:23:14,293 --> 00:23:15,653
We leave in the afternoon

163
00:23:16,493 --> 00:23:17,573
And no morning activities.

164
00:23:18,173 --> 00:23:18,733
It's free day.

165
00:23:20,253 --> 00:23:21,973
Oh, really?

166
00:23:23,573 --> 00:23:24,133
Er...

167
00:23:25,173 --> 00:23:25,693
Then...

168
00:23:26,533 --> 00:23:27,453
I'll go anyway.

169
00:23:30,693 --> 00:23:31,773
You need to rest.

170
00:23:48,453 --> 00:23:49,133
Kim.

171
00:23:56,133 --> 00:23:58,013
Do you have anything to say to me?

172
00:24:16,213 --> 00:24:16,933
Nothing.

173
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:20,533
You should get some rest.

174
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:22,693
See you tomorrow.

175
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:26,053
Wait.

176
00:24:30,653 --> 00:24:31,893
You ask me 'where', right?

177
00:24:35,293 --> 00:24:35,933
Here.

178
00:25:32,293 --> 00:25:32,653
Here.

179
00:25:33,213 --> 00:25:33,893
Apples.

180
00:25:34,453 --> 00:25:35,293
I washed them.

181
00:25:49,013 --> 00:25:49,933
I'm right here.

182
00:25:51,733 --> 00:25:53,813
I won't let anything happen to you.

183
00:25:54,613 --> 00:25:55,573
I promise.

184
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:41,453
I don't know

185
00:26:41,653 --> 00:26:43,413
if this is happiness or not.

186
00:26:44,453 --> 00:26:45,373
How?

187
00:26:45,653 --> 00:26:47,053
It's like there's a hole inside.

188
00:26:47,933 --> 00:26:49,053
Like I can't breathe properly.

189
00:26:49,333 --> 00:26:50,653
Don't tell me it's happening again?

190
00:26:50,653 --> 00:26:51,733
Not like that.

191
00:26:53,533 --> 00:26:54,933
But it's from the same place.

192
00:26:56,373 --> 00:26:57,013
Where?

193
00:26:58,133 --> 00:26:58,893
Here.

194
00:27:39,493 --> 00:27:39,933
What?

195
00:27:42,053 --> 00:27:42,693
A dream?

196
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:15,653
Oh, Payoo.

197
00:28:15,933 --> 00:28:17,533
I'm here to send you off.

198
00:28:17,653 --> 00:28:19,013
It may not be appropriate downstairs.

199
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:17,079
Young Master.

200
00:29:40,199 --> 00:29:43,479
I don't need anyone controlling me from behind.

201
00:29:45,239 --> 00:29:46,599
It's my duty.

202
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,279
Without duty,

203
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,199
who am I in your eyes?

204
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:54,239
Well...

205
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:55,839
My young master.

206
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,079
I want someone who walks with me.

207
00:30:13,439 --> 00:30:15,079
It's not that hard, right?

208
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:19,759
Let's go.

209
00:30:26,239 --> 00:30:27,199
Let me help.

210
00:30:31,239 --> 00:30:32,519
You promised me

211
00:30:32,959 --> 00:30:34,159
to live your own life.

212
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:38,399
Let me do it.

213
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:53,919
Ouch!

214
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:04,279
I will not let you hurt again.

215
00:31:15,239 --> 00:31:16,679
If you want to do me a favor,

216
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:19,759
take care of Kim while I'm not here.

217
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:21,079
Just that.

218
00:31:26,239 --> 00:31:26,799
Okay.

219
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:30,799
Promise me.

220
00:31:33,999 --> 00:31:34,439
Yes.

221
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:36,839
I promise.

222
00:31:39,719 --> 00:31:40,159
Let's go.

223
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:41,719
It's almost time.

224
00:31:42,879 --> 00:31:44,119
Dad's waiting.

225
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:24,959
At least you're here to send me off.

226
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:30,439
Just in case you have something to tell me.

227
00:32:34,879 --> 00:32:35,639
I think...

228
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,199
You should help me with business now.

229
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:42,399
At university,

230
00:32:43,159 --> 00:32:44,479
you have nothing left to do.

231
00:32:45,879 --> 00:32:47,519
I did everything

232
00:32:48,879 --> 00:32:50,199
for both of you.

233
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:55,479
Eventually, everything will be yours.

234
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:57,599
If you don't do it,

235
00:32:58,999 --> 00:33:00,359
who will?

236
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:19,119
All along,

237
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,639
I've tried my best at being a father.

238
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:26,199
I really did.

239
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:29,919
But you might think that

240
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:32,599
I don't understand you.

241
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:36,199
Or I won't let you choose your own path.

242
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:49,999
But if you're me,

243
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:53,559
you'd understand.

244
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:03,559
I'll try to.

245
00:34:30,479 --> 00:34:31,559
We're ready.

246
00:34:34,319 --> 00:34:34,799
Ready.

247
00:34:36,919 --> 00:34:38,519
Hey, Kim.

248
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,199
Why won't you go with us?

249
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,599
Rain's with you guys.

250
00:34:43,959 --> 00:34:44,999
You don't need me.

251
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:46,519
Okay.

252
00:34:47,319 --> 00:34:48,279
Butler Santi,

253
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:49,679
take care of our home.

254
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,679
Take care of Kim too.

255
00:34:52,759 --> 00:34:53,999
Don't worry madam.

256
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:55,319
Thanks.

257
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:59,039
Take the baggage to the car.

258
00:34:59,199 --> 00:34:59,679
And...

259
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:02,679
Have someone get young master's bag too.

260
00:35:02,999 --> 00:35:03,879
Yes, butler.

261
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:36,639
Er...

262
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:38,999
Oh, Payoo.

263
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:43,199
I'm here to send you off.

264
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:48,079
It may not be appropriate downstairs.

265
00:35:50,279 --> 00:35:51,519
Have a safe trip.

266
00:35:58,879 --> 00:35:59,479
Thanks.

267
00:36:41,279 --> 00:36:41,599
Er...

268
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:43,679
Forgot something?

269
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:33,599
Nothing.

270
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:40,559
Young master, your bag please.

271
00:38:06,279 --> 00:38:07,559
When I remember,

272
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:10,079
I'll never forget.

273
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:11,879
Do you want to forget about me

274
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:13,919
or remember?

275
00:38:43,422 --> 00:38:44,222
You're okay by yourself?

276
00:38:46,462 --> 00:38:47,262
I'll be fine.

277
00:38:48,142 --> 00:38:48,582
Yeah.

278
00:38:49,862 --> 00:38:50,622
I'll be back soon.

279
00:38:59,742 --> 00:39:00,182
Rain.

280
00:39:03,022 --> 00:39:03,542
What?

281
00:39:23,902 --> 00:39:25,462
It's...nothing.

282
00:39:26,702 --> 00:39:27,742
Have fun.

283
00:39:28,742 --> 00:39:29,222
Hey.

284
00:39:29,462 --> 00:39:30,902
I'm going to work, not for fun.

285
00:39:32,902 --> 00:39:33,822
Come back soon.

286
00:39:35,102 --> 00:39:35,862
Don't worry.

287
00:39:36,542 --> 00:39:39,622
I'll come back to compete diving with you, brother.

288
00:39:41,782 --> 00:39:42,182
Bye.

289
00:39:45,222 --> 00:39:46,782
Hey, time to go.

290
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:48,422
Traffic will get worse.

291
00:39:49,742 --> 00:39:50,262
Damn.

292
00:39:50,582 --> 00:39:51,902
Look at the time.

293
00:39:52,622 --> 00:39:53,342
Wow.

294
00:39:53,902 --> 00:39:54,902
You wear new watch

295
00:39:55,422 --> 00:39:57,102
just to buy a villa?

296
00:40:00,502 --> 00:40:01,902
Well, time to go.

297
00:40:08,102 --> 00:40:09,142
Oh, Doctor!

298
00:40:11,502 --> 00:40:12,662
Hello.

299
00:40:14,022 --> 00:40:16,542
I'm going the same way as you.

300
00:40:16,542 --> 00:40:19,142
So I told Mr. Kacha I'll go with you guys.

301
00:40:19,142 --> 00:40:21,142
Then, we won't have to wait for each other.

302
00:40:21,542 --> 00:40:22,342
Nice.

303
00:40:23,142 --> 00:40:23,742
Then...

304
00:40:24,302 --> 00:40:24,822
Shall we?

305
00:40:24,862 --> 00:40:25,782
Please get in.

306
00:40:40,742 --> 00:40:42,942
Did you forget your baggage?

307
00:40:45,622 --> 00:40:47,182
You're observant.

308
00:40:47,742 --> 00:40:49,542
I only need this bag.

309
00:40:53,702 --> 00:40:56,702
There's more to woman than meets the eyes.

310
00:41:03,702 --> 00:41:04,302
Hello.

311
00:41:07,942 --> 00:41:08,782
See you later.

312
00:42:03,462 --> 00:42:04,662
Where are you going?

313
00:42:06,422 --> 00:42:07,702
I'll get my stuffs at the uni.

314
00:42:08,142 --> 00:42:09,822
I won't be there much anymore.

315
00:42:10,382 --> 00:42:10,902
Then...

316
00:42:11,222 --> 00:42:13,062
Let Payoo drive you there.

317
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:14,582
It's okay.

318
00:42:15,222 --> 00:42:16,422
I want to drive by myself.

319
00:42:17,342 --> 00:42:17,742
Okay.

320
00:42:41,862 --> 00:42:43,262
Didn't expect to see you here.

321
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:53,182
I'm here for this plant.

322
00:42:56,102 --> 00:42:57,422
Thought you forgot about it.

323
00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:00,462
I'm thinking of taking care of it.

324
00:43:19,942 --> 00:43:20,622
I won't forget.

325
00:43:21,982 --> 00:43:23,302
When I remember,

326
00:43:24,382 --> 00:43:25,902
I'll never forget.

327
00:43:29,262 --> 00:43:29,902
How about me?

328
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:31,662
What?

329
00:43:37,302 --> 00:43:39,142
Do you want to forget about me

330
00:43:39,822 --> 00:43:40,902
or remember?

331
00:43:55,902 --> 00:43:56,622
Why are you here?

332
00:43:58,622 --> 00:44:01,182
You're so bad at changing subjects!

333
00:44:06,982 --> 00:44:08,862
I'm here to get some stuffs at the club.

334
00:44:37,702 --> 00:44:38,862
We're already close.

335
00:44:40,702 --> 00:44:41,302
Baibua.

336
00:44:48,342 --> 00:44:48,942
Payoo.

337
00:44:51,342 --> 00:44:52,542
Did Rain know?

338
00:44:54,622 --> 00:44:55,782
It's believed that

339
00:44:56,182 --> 00:44:58,702
we can make a wish on these comets.

340
00:44:59,022 --> 00:45:00,742
What do you wish for?
