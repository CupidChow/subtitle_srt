1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I announce that I am now a new CEO to replace the former.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,580
We also have Mr. Kimhan.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,800
Master Kim is in danger.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,810
Get me a car.

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,200
I'll go to the hospital.

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,770
And I'll finish everything.

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,500
Let's hurry.

8
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:18,330
It's time.

9
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,500
We need to turn off every device.

10
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,570
Kimhan got discharged.

11
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:30,650
Really?

12
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,700
You didn't know?

13
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,370
It looks like no one's here.

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,960
Just you and me.

15
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:14,850
You like this place?

16
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,800
Iguazu falls?

17
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,010
I've only seen it from afar.

18
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,520
Never notice that

19
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:26,820
it's so beautiful.

20
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:29,290
Yeah.

21
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:31,760
I want to see

22
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:36,840
if the real one is as beautiful as what's in front of me.

23
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,380
- Hello.
- Hello.

24
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,040
What are you doing here?

25
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,600
I'm Kim's friend.

26
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,780
We want to pay him a visit.

27
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,180
Master Kim?

28
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:19,180
Yeah.

29
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,930
He hasn't come back here from the hospital.

30
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,480
What?
Then, where is he?

31
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,540
I don't know either.

32
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,810
You can leave a message for him.

33
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,560
It's okay.

34
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:35,500
Thank you.

35
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,920
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

36
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,660
Not at home...

37
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:47,900
Weird.

38
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:50,160
Or...

39
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,730
He stays somewhere else?

40
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,930
His father is that rich.

41
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,560
He must have had a hundred more houses.

42
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:00,490
Mr. Know-it-all.

43
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,970
You should know about yourself more.

44
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,250
Calm down.

45
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:08,920
Right now,

46
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,500
what should we do?

47
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,080
Just go back for now.

48
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,600
If something's wrong, Kim would contact Sun.

49
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,250
We can do nothing

50
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,290
but wait.

51
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,780
Let's go home.

52
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:16,250
Yes, dad?

53
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,160
Everything's okay?

54
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:18,840
Yes.

55
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,410
No problem.

56
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,970
How about you?

57
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,820
Master Kim's friends came here looking for him.

58
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,180
Some went looking for him at the hospital.

59
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:35,090
I still can't figure out their motive

60
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,240
and who's the mastermind

61
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,340
behind the death of our masters and young master.

62
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:46,440
You stay there.

63
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,460
Take good care of Master Kim.

64
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:51,580
Don't worry, dad.

65
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,220
I'll protect him

66
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,780
with all my life.

67
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:57,490
Thanks, Payoo.

68
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,480
I can't go there yet.

69
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,810
I have to distract the mastermind

70
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,520
until I know who they are.

71
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:08,700
Yes, dad.

72
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:24,780
Why has no one found that damn kid yet?

73
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,850
I warned you not to call me.

74
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,020
I'll contact you myself.

75
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,680
And for the money,

76
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,180
I can't give it all to you now.

77
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,980
Because for me,

78
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,050
your work hasn't finished yet.

79
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,640
Clean all the dust.

80
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,400
And you'll get what I promised.

81
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,080
Don't!

82
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,890
No!

83
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,530
Master!

84
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:08,420
Master Kim!

85
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,480
Payoo.

86
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:20,840
Er...

87
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:26,850
What's wrong?

88
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:29,970
Nothing.

89
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,380
Just a nightmare.

90
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,690
Do we really need it?

91
00:08:58,570 --> 00:08:58,880
Yeah.

92
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,400
For your safety.

93
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,690
We need it.

94
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:13,940
Er...

95
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,450
If nothing's wrong,

96
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:17,850
I must excuse myself.

97
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:22,700
Payoo.

98
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:25,300
Yes?

99
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,490
Rain...

100
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,560
must be safe. Right?

101
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,660
I hope so.

102
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,050
Hope...

103
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,400
for the best.

104
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:50,980
Rain...

105
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:53,420
must be safe.

106
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:17,570
Do we have horse here?

107
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,920
Where have you been?

108
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:58,380
And what's that urgent matter you want to tell me?

109
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,520
Master Kim.

110
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:03,460
Master Kim.

111
00:12:25,336 --> 00:12:25,716
Here.

112
00:12:29,296 --> 00:12:29,996
Payoo.

113
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,186
We don't even have TV signal?

114
00:12:34,506 --> 00:12:35,746
We have.

115
00:12:36,096 --> 00:12:37,916
But we have to turn it off.

116
00:12:38,626 --> 00:12:40,016
So...

117
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:42,076
How do we receive new info about Rain?

118
00:12:43,226 --> 00:12:43,916
Er...

119
00:12:44,546 --> 00:12:46,616
I and my dad are working on it.

120
00:12:50,386 --> 00:12:51,396
I'm his brother.

121
00:12:52,176 --> 00:12:54,946
I have the rights to know about my brother.

122
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:01,676
We know.

123
00:13:04,056 --> 00:13:04,476
But...

124
00:13:05,596 --> 00:13:09,096
This is all for your safety.

125
00:13:10,436 --> 00:13:11,466
Safety?

126
00:13:12,636 --> 00:13:14,256
The one who needs safety now

127
00:13:14,996 --> 00:13:16,316
is Rain!

128
00:13:31,276 --> 00:13:31,946
I'm sorry.

129
00:13:35,496 --> 00:13:36,116
It's okay.

130
00:13:37,996 --> 00:13:38,856
I understand you.

131
00:14:26,976 --> 00:14:27,936
It's past noon.

132
00:14:30,876 --> 00:14:32,616
How long is he gonna sulk?

133
00:14:43,756 --> 00:14:45,316
Master Kim?

134
00:14:46,796 --> 00:14:47,356
Master?

135
00:14:49,626 --> 00:14:51,056
It's time for lunch.

136
00:14:54,506 --> 00:14:56,866
You haven't had anything since morning.

137
00:15:15,756 --> 00:15:16,346
Master Kim.

138
00:15:21,236 --> 00:15:21,786
Master.

139
00:15:30,236 --> 00:15:31,236
Excuse me.

140
00:16:25,226 --> 00:16:25,756
Master Kim.

141
00:16:26,256 --> 00:16:27,336
Meal's ready.

142
00:16:49,256 --> 00:16:49,816
Master Kim.

143
00:16:58,186 --> 00:16:58,756
Master Kim.

144
00:17:28,226 --> 00:17:28,976
This way.

145
00:17:53,546 --> 00:17:53,996
Master Kim.

146
00:18:33,956 --> 00:18:34,596
Master Kim.

147
00:18:35,986 --> 00:18:36,616
Master Kim.

148
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:50,136
You can't even deal with one kid.

149
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:53,836
How can you handle a bigger job?

150
00:18:57,696 --> 00:18:58,986
Before anyone finds Rain,

151
00:18:59,496 --> 00:19:00,736
either dead or alive,

152
00:19:01,776 --> 00:19:05,236
you have to find Kim by any means possible.

153
00:19:06,936 --> 00:19:10,346
And you know what to do when you find him, right?

154
00:19:13,936 --> 00:19:16,096
You're not allowed inside!

155
00:19:17,946 --> 00:19:19,556
Ms. President, I...

156
00:19:19,556 --> 00:19:20,146
It's okay.

157
00:19:21,146 --> 00:19:22,146
Mr. Butler.

158
00:19:26,936 --> 00:19:28,616
What's the matter, butler?

159
00:19:30,306 --> 00:19:32,466
I understand the situation.

160
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:35,996
I just want to collect my master's documents.

161
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:37,466
Nice.

162
00:19:38,336 --> 00:19:39,336
You're fast learner,

163
00:19:39,866 --> 00:19:40,976
flexible.

164
00:19:41,756 --> 00:19:42,376
That's why

165
00:19:43,106 --> 00:19:44,586
Mr. Kacha trusts you.

166
00:19:48,696 --> 00:19:49,826
Aren't those behaviors

167
00:19:50,786 --> 00:19:52,666
belong to a chameleon?

168
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:56,816
Not for good men.

169
00:20:01,096 --> 00:20:05,096
You don't have to deal with this trivial matter by yourself.

170
00:20:08,026 --> 00:20:09,106
Payoo can do it.

171
00:20:12,256 --> 00:20:13,826
Where is he?

172
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:19,396
Important documents must be handled by me.

173
00:20:20,116 --> 00:20:21,546
Not anyone else.

174
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:30,856
Okay.

175
00:21:05,986 --> 00:21:07,176
You have to find that kid

176
00:21:07,906 --> 00:21:09,096
before the officials.

177
00:21:09,876 --> 00:21:10,226
Hey!

178
00:21:31,353 --> 00:21:32,663
Am I going around in circle?

179
00:21:36,983 --> 00:21:37,253
Damn.

180
00:21:43,733 --> 00:21:44,073
You!

181
00:21:49,353 --> 00:21:49,623
Hey.

182
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:52,353
What sound?

183
00:21:53,233 --> 00:21:54,663
It's like human's sound.

184
00:21:55,273 --> 00:21:56,253
You're just hearing things.

185
00:21:56,903 --> 00:21:58,133
I don't hear a thing.

186
00:21:59,453 --> 00:22:00,583
But I heard it.

187
00:22:01,983 --> 00:22:02,393
Yong,

188
00:22:03,233 --> 00:22:04,493
you think I lost my mind?

189
00:22:05,493 --> 00:22:07,053
We've been looking for 4 days.

190
00:22:07,703 --> 00:22:08,853
Still no trace of him.

191
00:22:10,153 --> 00:22:11,383
Didn't you hear our boss?

192
00:22:12,313 --> 00:22:15,273
You need to find that kid before the officials.

193
00:22:18,013 --> 00:22:19,153
We need to hurry.

194
00:22:19,733 --> 00:22:20,703
It's almost dark.

195
00:22:21,703 --> 00:22:22,773
We need to set up a camp.

196
00:22:24,073 --> 00:22:25,383
A lot of wildlife at night.

197
00:22:26,593 --> 00:22:27,613
It's dangerous.

198
00:22:28,753 --> 00:22:29,413
I know.

199
00:22:30,983 --> 00:22:32,223
After crossing that river,

200
00:22:33,113 --> 00:22:35,303
we'll set up the camp before dark.

201
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:42,733
Who are they?

202
00:22:45,393 --> 00:22:47,993
I don't know who they are.

203
00:22:49,213 --> 00:22:50,463
Or who hired them.

204
00:22:52,103 --> 00:22:52,973
One thing for sure.

205
00:22:54,783 --> 00:22:55,893
They're not good men.

206
00:22:56,953 --> 00:22:58,593
They're looking for Master Rain

207
00:22:59,693 --> 00:23:00,733
to find out that

208
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:04,753
he's dead or alive.

209
00:23:16,053 --> 00:23:16,583
Now,

210
00:23:17,673 --> 00:23:20,343
they and the officials haven't found Rain.

211
00:23:22,013 --> 00:23:23,533
I believe we have hope.

212
00:23:25,943 --> 00:23:27,023
Even if it's just 1%,

213
00:23:28,513 --> 00:23:29,053
I still hope.

214
00:23:37,023 --> 00:23:38,733
Let's go back for now.

215
00:23:40,133 --> 00:23:41,943
You see how dangerous it is.

216
00:23:42,533 --> 00:23:43,333
But Rain...

217
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:44,013
I...

218
00:23:44,063 --> 00:23:45,053
Believe me.

219
00:23:46,823 --> 00:23:47,633
Please.

220
00:24:36,173 --> 00:24:37,593
Where have you been?

221
00:24:38,853 --> 00:24:41,263
Do you know someone's missing you.

222
00:24:51,233 --> 00:24:51,863
Oh, hey.

223
00:24:52,543 --> 00:24:53,413
What are you doing?

224
00:24:54,343 --> 00:24:55,823
It's school holidays.

225
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:58,703
Are you missing someone?

226
00:25:00,873 --> 00:25:01,393
Not at all.

227
00:25:02,063 --> 00:25:02,993
No one.

228
00:25:04,153 --> 00:25:04,863
Really?

229
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:15,833
Oh yeah.

230
00:25:16,873 --> 00:25:17,703
Why are you here?

231
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:18,953
Hey.

232
00:25:20,373 --> 00:25:23,213
Trees need to be taken care of.

233
00:25:23,703 --> 00:25:25,583
Watering and fertilizing.

234
00:25:25,973 --> 00:25:27,663
They don't have holidays.

235
00:25:28,853 --> 00:25:29,983
Just like love.

236
00:25:37,873 --> 00:25:38,393
Sun.

237
00:25:38,863 --> 00:25:39,143
Yes?

238
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:41,073
Answer me honestly.

239
00:25:43,703 --> 00:25:45,253
Do you have feelings for my friend?

240
00:25:48,773 --> 00:25:49,753
Who?

241
00:25:51,893 --> 00:25:53,263
Well...

242
00:25:59,863 --> 00:26:01,393
Apple tree's owner.

243
00:26:06,313 --> 00:26:07,093
Kim.

244
00:26:08,553 --> 00:26:09,933
He's hard to read.

245
00:26:12,253 --> 00:26:16,103
Even I've been his friend since freshmen year,

246
00:26:16,733 --> 00:26:20,463
sometimes I don't know what he's thinking.

247
00:26:21,573 --> 00:26:22,893
Especially about love,

248
00:26:23,663 --> 00:26:25,073
I can't understand at all.

249
00:26:30,633 --> 00:26:31,533
Do you think...

250
00:26:34,373 --> 00:26:35,303
He has someone?

251
00:26:39,133 --> 00:26:42,743
Does it seem like he has someone in mind?

252
00:26:44,313 --> 00:26:44,623
Yeah.

253
00:26:46,013 --> 00:26:47,233
I feel that way.

254
00:26:48,753 --> 00:26:49,983
Maybe...

255
00:26:51,013 --> 00:26:52,213
His first love.

256
00:27:02,823 --> 00:27:03,343
Do you know

257
00:27:04,943 --> 00:27:06,303
what I fear the most?

258
00:27:08,313 --> 00:27:08,903
What?

259
00:27:11,433 --> 00:27:12,303
First love.

260
00:27:21,233 --> 00:27:21,733
I think...

261
00:27:23,193 --> 00:27:26,053
It's not the right time to talk about ourselves.

262
00:27:27,023 --> 00:27:28,393
I'm worried about Kim.

263
00:27:31,573 --> 00:27:34,533
We have to be by his side

264
00:27:35,023 --> 00:27:36,933
and give him hope.

265
00:27:40,543 --> 00:27:41,583
But we don't know

266
00:27:42,893 --> 00:27:44,103
where he is.

267
00:30:50,133 --> 00:30:52,423
Why are you here alone?

268
00:30:57,903 --> 00:30:58,223
Hey.

269
00:31:09,753 --> 00:31:10,373
Good boy.

270
00:31:20,543 --> 00:31:21,033
Hey.

271
00:31:21,983 --> 00:31:23,913
You're something else.

272
00:31:26,313 --> 00:31:27,313
You like apples?

273
00:31:44,793 --> 00:31:46,173
Snow White.

274
00:31:54,653 --> 00:31:56,183
You're alone, right?

275
00:32:01,973 --> 00:32:02,733
Just like me.

276
00:32:03,753 --> 00:32:04,703
I'm alone too.

277
00:32:05,653 --> 00:32:06,473
No one else.

278
00:32:08,853 --> 00:32:09,613
At least,

279
00:32:12,503 --> 00:32:13,533
we're friends now.

280
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:22,953
Payoo.

281
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:26,303
Whose white horse is that?

282
00:32:30,953 --> 00:32:31,293
Er...

283
00:32:32,153 --> 00:32:33,273
That's Snow White.

284
00:32:34,113 --> 00:32:35,993
You've ridden him for months.

285
00:32:38,753 --> 00:32:40,953
Why is it like my first time seeing it?

286
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:46,553
Er...

287
00:32:47,463 --> 00:32:48,953
It's your horse.

288
00:32:53,733 --> 00:32:54,113
Yeah.

289
00:33:11,113 --> 00:33:11,903
I feel like

290
00:33:12,903 --> 00:33:15,533
someone loves eating apples.

291
00:33:17,383 --> 00:33:18,463
But I can't remember.

292
00:33:19,833 --> 00:33:21,393
I've been trying to remember

293
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:23,463
but I can't.

294
00:33:25,813 --> 00:33:26,503
Er...

295
00:33:27,253 --> 00:33:29,033
It's Snow White.

296
00:33:29,693 --> 00:33:30,913
It likes apples.

297
00:33:31,373 --> 00:33:33,353
So you named it Snow White.

298
00:33:37,743 --> 00:33:38,233
Really?

299
00:33:40,133 --> 00:33:40,353
Yeah.

300
00:33:45,573 --> 00:33:45,853
Er...

301
00:33:48,093 --> 00:33:49,503
In a moment,

302
00:33:50,183 --> 00:33:51,513
I'll go shopping in town.

303
00:33:52,373 --> 00:33:53,783
Do you need anything?

304
00:33:55,393 --> 00:33:56,793
No, thanks.

305
00:33:58,333 --> 00:33:58,623
Okay.

306
00:34:38,313 --> 00:34:39,253
Is this long enough?

307
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:43,033
You must've forgotten our promise.

308
00:35:14,633 --> 00:35:15,223
You're booked.

309
00:35:16,353 --> 00:35:16,633
Here.

310
00:35:21,573 --> 00:35:22,503
Let's watch the comets together.

311
00:35:33,193 --> 00:35:34,513
You booked me.

312
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:36,613
You can't cancel now.

313
00:35:50,453 --> 00:35:51,193
Why...

314
00:35:52,933 --> 00:35:53,653
do I...

315
00:35:55,093 --> 00:35:56,583
keep forgetting things.

316
00:36:17,002 --> 00:36:19,672
In the 4th quarter of this year

317
00:36:20,042 --> 00:36:21,802
under my administration,

318
00:36:22,562 --> 00:36:28,082
Kannakul Group broke the record-high in company profits.

319
00:36:28,932 --> 00:36:30,552
Even higher than in Mr. Kacha's era.

320
00:36:32,532 --> 00:36:33,802
That's not entirely true.

321
00:36:34,572 --> 00:36:36,512
Our country's GDP is also getting better.

322
00:36:36,812 --> 00:36:39,402
That's because our government boosted economy

323
00:36:39,612 --> 00:36:41,232
after the COVID-19 pandemic.

324
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:44,242
I think anybody in your position

325
00:36:44,512 --> 00:36:46,112
can set that record.

326
00:36:47,722 --> 00:36:48,412
Really?

327
00:36:48,602 --> 00:36:49,282
Mr. Pakdee.

328
00:36:50,512 --> 00:36:50,732
Yeah.

329
00:36:52,282 --> 00:36:54,042
Let's go to our next agenda.

330
00:36:54,172 --> 00:36:55,112
6th agenda.

331
00:36:56,632 --> 00:37:00,602
This agenda is to request your approval

332
00:37:01,202 --> 00:37:04,132
to create a joint venture with Well Group from Dubai

333
00:37:04,512 --> 00:37:06,532
in order to expand our business in Dubai

334
00:37:07,242 --> 00:37:09,372
with 4.5 billion baht investment.

335
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:10,762
Woah!

336
00:37:11,972 --> 00:37:13,952
That is too risky.

337
00:37:14,612 --> 00:37:15,952
Investment fund is huge.

338
00:37:16,562 --> 00:37:18,842
We have to sell most our stocks for this.

339
00:37:19,272 --> 00:37:19,872
Right.

340
00:37:20,202 --> 00:37:22,392
We need to consider thoroughly.

341
00:37:24,192 --> 00:37:25,192
If we delay this,

342
00:37:25,802 --> 00:37:28,132
there'll be other companies in our place.

343
00:37:30,232 --> 00:37:32,962
If we have rivals and couldn't reach the deal,

344
00:37:34,072 --> 00:37:35,872
then let it be.

345
00:37:38,952 --> 00:37:42,732
But this is a crucial step for all of us.

346
00:37:43,652 --> 00:37:47,472
I heard that Well Group was involved in a fraud.

347
00:37:48,412 --> 00:37:50,292
We need to investigate this.

348
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:54,472
Otherwise, we'll be called a fraud too.

349
00:37:57,872 --> 00:37:58,282
Then...

350
00:37:58,852 --> 00:38:04,152
I'll use my authority as a CEO to get this agenda approved.

351
00:38:04,492 --> 00:38:05,632
That's impossible.

352
00:38:06,392 --> 00:38:09,992
As long as Mr. Rain or Mr. Wasan still holds 26% shares.

353
00:38:10,832 --> 00:38:14,072
Mr. Kim or Mr. Kimhan holds 25% shares.

354
00:38:15,002 --> 00:38:18,162
They both have more than you at 25%.

355
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:22,632
We need to get both their approval.

356
00:38:31,402 --> 00:38:33,012
Mr. Rain has been missing.

357
00:38:34,082 --> 00:38:36,642
Mr. Kimhan is also nowhere to be found.

358
00:38:37,532 --> 00:38:40,532
Until we have evidence of their status,

359
00:38:41,812 --> 00:38:43,002
this can't be done.

360
00:38:47,032 --> 00:38:47,432
Okay.

361
00:38:48,332 --> 00:38:50,072
I'll look forward to that evidence.

362
00:38:52,352 --> 00:38:53,402
In Master Rain's case,

363
00:38:54,842 --> 00:38:58,512
if he's missing for more than 2 years,

364
00:38:59,252 --> 00:39:01,552
he'll be presumed dead.

365
00:39:02,592 --> 00:39:05,242
We'll still have time before then.

366
00:39:07,152 --> 00:39:08,442
But for Master Kim,

367
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,522
his safety is of utmost importance.

368
00:39:12,712 --> 00:39:13,762
Because we don't know

369
00:39:14,612 --> 00:39:17,452
who wants to end this as quickly as possible.

370
00:39:19,032 --> 00:39:21,952
I'll have to leave this in your hands, Santi.

371
00:39:23,802 --> 00:39:24,322
Yes, sir.

372
00:39:32,212 --> 00:39:32,632
Dad.

373
00:39:34,402 --> 00:39:39,992
Master Kim now has symptoms from his intracerebral hemorrhage.

374
00:39:41,042 --> 00:39:41,442
I know.

375
00:39:43,202 --> 00:39:45,812
But to get him a surgery here

376
00:39:47,012 --> 00:39:50,032
or bring someone there to treat him is both risky.

377
00:39:50,292 --> 00:39:53,082
His life will be in danger.

378
00:39:53,812 --> 00:39:54,712
Most importantly,

379
00:39:55,152 --> 00:39:59,162
Master Kim insisted that he not get any treatment

380
00:40:00,362 --> 00:40:04,032
unless he gets an approval from guardians.

381
00:40:10,692 --> 00:40:11,442
Master Rain.

382
00:40:12,372 --> 00:40:12,802
So...

383
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,652
What do we do now?

384
00:40:15,282 --> 00:40:16,212
We can only wait.

385
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:18,272
It's been a long time.

386
00:40:19,802 --> 00:40:21,492
But this will be over soon.

387
00:40:23,752 --> 00:40:23,972
Okay.

388
00:40:25,712 --> 00:40:28,892
I feel sorry for Master Kim.

389
00:40:30,372 --> 00:40:32,372
I've raised him since he was born.

390
00:40:33,482 --> 00:40:34,852
He's like my own child.

391
00:40:35,842 --> 00:40:38,592
You must feel the same as me.

392
00:40:41,532 --> 00:40:43,592
I can't go anywhere right now

393
00:40:44,682 --> 00:40:48,512
because I don't know if someone's monitoring me.

394
00:40:49,252 --> 00:40:51,512
You stay there and protect Master Kim.

395
00:40:53,112 --> 00:40:53,932
Don't worry about me.

396
00:40:54,832 --> 00:40:56,072
I and Mr. Pakdee,

397
00:40:56,872 --> 00:40:59,672
a board member who's on Master Kacha's side,

398
00:40:59,932 --> 00:41:00,812
will handle this.

399
00:41:04,092 --> 00:41:04,752
Yes, dad.

400
00:41:15,812 --> 00:41:17,652
You still haven't found Rain?

401
00:41:17,912 --> 00:41:19,162
Either dead or alive.

402
00:41:19,482 --> 00:41:20,972
And now there's Kimhan.

403
00:41:21,532 --> 00:41:23,362
Is he that hard to find?

404
00:41:23,552 --> 00:41:24,432
It's been 3 months.

405
00:41:25,482 --> 00:41:26,962
I've tried my best.

406
00:41:27,912 --> 00:41:29,772
But we can't find them.

407
00:41:30,772 --> 00:41:33,452
Don't make me feel like I made a mistake hiring you.

408
00:41:35,252 --> 00:41:35,552
Sure.

409
00:41:36,892 --> 00:41:38,392
Give me one more chance.

410
00:41:39,812 --> 00:41:40,852
I promise

411
00:41:41,482 --> 00:41:44,082
I'll get this done as fast as possible.

412
00:41:45,282 --> 00:41:46,832
Remember your own words.

413
00:41:47,572 --> 00:41:49,922
I'll give you one last chance.

414
00:41:50,632 --> 00:41:51,172
Yes, boss.

415
00:41:53,002 --> 00:41:53,362
Hey!

416
00:41:54,162 --> 00:41:54,632
Hurry up.

417
00:42:10,042 --> 00:42:10,882
How are you?

418
00:42:11,322 --> 00:42:13,332
Why didn't you call me last week?

419
00:42:15,092 --> 00:42:17,132
I was busy with my internship.

420
00:42:17,842 --> 00:42:19,692
So heavy workload.

421
00:42:20,552 --> 00:42:21,002
But...

422
00:42:21,752 --> 00:42:22,882
Tomorrow is my last day.

423
00:42:23,392 --> 00:42:25,572
I'll graduate after I get my grade scores.

424
00:42:26,332 --> 00:42:27,992
You're so amazing.

425
00:42:28,372 --> 00:42:30,132
You can graduate with in 3 and a half year.

426
00:42:31,722 --> 00:42:32,642
Not at all.

427
00:42:33,122 --> 00:42:35,232
Some of my friends are faster.

428
00:42:36,412 --> 00:42:37,372
Just 3 years.

429
00:42:37,692 --> 00:42:38,212
Wow.

430
00:42:40,232 --> 00:42:41,272
Oh, yeah.

431
00:42:42,272 --> 00:42:43,452
How are you feeling?

432
00:42:44,952 --> 00:42:45,952
I'm fine.

433
00:42:46,162 --> 00:42:47,232
Don't worry.

434
00:42:48,972 --> 00:42:49,562
Great.

435
00:42:50,972 --> 00:42:51,802
I'm glad.

436
00:42:53,132 --> 00:42:55,292
Thank you for doing this for me.

437
00:43:02,322 --> 00:43:03,012
Sure.

438
00:43:10,562 --> 00:43:12,482
I have a customer.

439
00:43:12,932 --> 00:43:13,972
Got to go now.

440
00:43:14,932 --> 00:43:16,602
I'll call you later.

441
00:43:18,152 --> 00:43:18,952
Love you, mom.

442
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:21,052
Love you too, son.

443
00:43:21,912 --> 00:43:22,322
Bye.

444
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:44,472
Finding someone

445
00:43:48,352 --> 00:43:50,402
is so damn hurt.

446
00:43:54,112 --> 00:43:55,362
Parting with someone

447
00:43:57,892 --> 00:44:00,092
without even saying goodbye

448
00:44:02,162 --> 00:44:04,532
is like a deep scar on my heart.

449
00:44:06,132 --> 00:44:08,432
My old wound seems about to be healed.

450
00:44:09,372 --> 00:44:10,282
But now,

451
00:44:11,252 --> 00:44:13,922
it's getting worse and worse.

452
00:44:15,192 --> 00:44:16,722
It hurts more and more.

453
00:44:17,852 --> 00:44:19,242
I can only pray

454
00:44:20,332 --> 00:44:22,812
that this pain will fade away from my heart.

455
00:44:41,472 --> 00:44:43,572
Do you want dinner now?

456
00:44:47,552 --> 00:44:48,192
Payoo...

457
00:44:51,792 --> 00:44:52,402
Why

458
00:44:54,172 --> 00:44:54,972
do I

459
00:44:56,332 --> 00:44:57,912
start forgetting things.

460
00:45:01,972 --> 00:45:03,532
Yesterday's memory

461
00:45:05,812 --> 00:45:07,112
is fading away

462
00:45:08,332 --> 00:45:09,082
little by little

463
00:45:10,192 --> 00:45:10,852
bit by bit.

464
00:45:15,042 --> 00:45:16,602
Memory from the other day

465
00:45:18,952 --> 00:45:20,092
almost fades away.

466
00:45:24,922 --> 00:45:26,012
Not just the other day

467
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:30,562
I almost can't remember

468
00:45:33,132 --> 00:45:34,452
what happened to me.

469
00:45:47,562 --> 00:45:48,312
Master Kim.

470
00:45:49,592 --> 00:45:50,402
Trust me.

471
00:45:53,372 --> 00:45:54,202
Be patient.

472
00:45:56,642 --> 00:46:00,132
Everything will be better.

473
00:46:05,072 --> 00:46:06,572
I hope so.

474
00:46:10,692 --> 00:46:14,642
To have no memories

475
00:46:20,932 --> 00:46:22,522
means no suffering,

476
00:46:26,532 --> 00:46:29,602
means I've never had happiness.

477
00:46:34,212 --> 00:46:35,632
No need to endure pain.

478
00:46:40,912 --> 00:46:42,492
No more loneliness.

479
00:46:46,812 --> 00:46:48,162
No more feelings.

480
00:47:30,442 --> 00:47:32,732
This must be the best solution.

481
00:47:35,402 --> 00:47:36,552
I'm sorry, dad.

482
00:47:41,372 --> 00:47:41,812
Who's there?!

483
00:47:43,092 --> 00:47:44,442
Where have you been?

484
00:47:46,732 --> 00:47:48,672
I feel like I have a promise.

485
00:47:50,162 --> 00:47:51,162
Do you know I miss you?

486
00:49:57,362 --> 00:50:00,362
Doctor, I want to follow up on Master Kim's condition.

487
00:50:00,722 --> 00:50:03,832
Latest medicine that I gave you

488
00:50:03,832 --> 00:50:05,532
just got imported from the USA.

489
00:50:06,192 --> 00:50:09,232
This will perform better at dissolving blood clots.

490
00:50:09,972 --> 00:50:10,232
Yeah.

491
00:50:11,282 --> 00:50:12,912
He's on that medication.

492
00:50:14,272 --> 00:50:14,722
But...

493
00:50:15,952 --> 00:50:17,682
Are there any other ways

494
00:50:18,292 --> 00:50:21,362
to recover Master Kim's memory faster?

495
00:50:21,992 --> 00:50:26,852
Because he has a partial memory loss condition,

496
00:50:27,472 --> 00:50:31,632
he should be in a familiar environment.

497
00:50:32,072 --> 00:50:35,442
For example, staying with someone in his memory.

498
00:50:36,032 --> 00:50:36,592
Or...

499
00:50:36,912 --> 00:50:38,332
His special person.

500
00:50:38,912 --> 00:50:41,802
I don't know who that is

501
00:50:42,522 --> 00:50:44,532
but you're close to him,

502
00:50:44,532 --> 00:50:46,632
so you ought to know that.

503
00:50:47,212 --> 00:50:49,442
Master Kim's special person.

504
00:50:50,612 --> 00:50:51,492
Yes.

505
00:50:54,732 --> 00:50:55,322
Sun...
