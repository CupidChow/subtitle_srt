1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,610
It's believed that we can make a wish upon those comets.

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:05,310
What would you wish for?

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,990
If I told you, it wouldn't be a wish.

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,550
I've prepared a lot of stuffs to say.

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,550
But when it's time,

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,230
I can't say it.

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,350
Mr. Kacha has a keen sense of real estate.

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,460
He's great. Everybody admires him.

9
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:21,640
But can't be him.

10
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:23,790
I'm allergic to seafood,

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:24,960
squid,

12
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:25,870
shrimp.

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,240
Oh! Kim.

14
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:27,920
Sun.

15
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:29,390
Aren't you going with Petch?

16
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,210
Why don't you call Petch now?

17
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,820
I'll buy something to cook at Sun's condo.

18
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:35,080
Call him.

19
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,440
Really?

20
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,620
Garlic bread's coming.

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,770
Come and eat with us.

22
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,490
Come.

23
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,040
I'll eat anyway.

24
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,870
You haven't eaten?

25
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:26,730
Wow.

26
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,780
I didn't know you are this good at cooking.

27
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:34,680
Actually, I live nearby.

28
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,280
Can I come here more often?

29
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,340
So,

30
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:41,360
you want to eat for free.

31
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:42,430
Right?

32
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,390
I said I'll come here more often.

33
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,550
It's okay.

34
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,580
If I'm home,

35
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,160
you can come anytime.

36
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,590
That's just a ridiculous excuse.

37
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,260
Let it slide.

38
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,240
Normally,

39
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,910
Petch doesn't have many friends.

40
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,990
Kim! That's shrimp!

41
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,520
Yeah, shrimp.

42
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,220
You're allergic!

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,400
Kim.

44
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,570
Are you okay?

45
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,700
I'm allergic.

46
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,040
Do you think I look okay?

47
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,410
It's okay.

48
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,330
Pie's there.

49
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,380
I'll help you.

50
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,790
Stay put!

51
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,830
Don't even try to resist me.

52
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:38,730
Does it hurt?

53
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,550
Get some rest.

54
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:25,640
It'll get better.

55
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,770
Get ready to meet your new owner.

56
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,480
It's been so long.

57
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:03,950
Damn.

58
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,790
Even in your sleep,

59
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,920
my heart still beats fast.

60
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,480
What the hell am I doing?

61
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,140
No.

62
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,160
Not like this.

63
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:56,940
What?!

64
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:02,160
Kim.

65
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,960
Why this side pillow is so hard?

66
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:17,880
Oh my god.

67
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,870
He's so heavy.

68
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,160
Damn.

69
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,770
Did you really sleep?

70
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,290
What did you do to me?

71
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,188
This looks exotic.

72
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:50,388
You breed them?

73
00:12:50,868 --> 00:12:51,468
No, ma'am.

74
00:12:51,868 --> 00:12:53,948
Must be the work of nature.

75
00:12:54,588 --> 00:12:56,668
I don't know much about this.

76
00:12:57,108 --> 00:12:59,188
But I heard from the gardener.

77
00:13:00,868 --> 00:13:01,868
It's natural.

78
00:13:02,588 --> 00:13:04,748
If you want to survive, you must grow.

79
00:13:05,228 --> 00:13:07,828
Didn't know you also have this side.

80
00:13:10,188 --> 00:13:12,428
Just being here with you all

81
00:13:12,748 --> 00:13:14,268
is my happiness.

82
00:13:16,108 --> 00:13:18,108
I told you you'll like it.

83
00:13:19,468 --> 00:13:21,828
This is the third time you said that.

84
00:13:23,148 --> 00:13:24,868
I believe you since the first.

85
00:13:25,668 --> 00:13:27,548
Mr. Somkid, I just...

86
00:13:27,548 --> 00:13:29,308
That's our highlight.

87
00:13:29,588 --> 00:13:31,348
Yes, it's our landmark.

88
00:13:34,028 --> 00:13:35,228
It's beautiful.

89
00:13:39,508 --> 00:13:41,988
Rain

90
00:14:00,788 --> 00:14:01,548
I fell asleep.

91
00:14:02,988 --> 00:14:03,908
Just a little while.

92
00:14:04,388 --> 00:14:05,348
3 hours.

93
00:14:07,068 --> 00:14:07,948
By the way...

94
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,828
Did you really sleep?

95
00:14:14,348 --> 00:14:14,988
Yes.

96
00:14:16,108 --> 00:14:16,348
Er...

97
00:14:17,308 --> 00:14:19,348
Was that anti-histamine or sleeping pills?

98
00:14:20,628 --> 00:14:21,668
I had a deep sleep.

99
00:14:28,028 --> 00:14:28,988
What?

100
00:14:31,908 --> 00:14:33,068
What did you do to me?

101
00:14:34,028 --> 00:14:34,828
Nonsense!

102
00:14:35,748 --> 00:14:36,908
What the hell?

103
00:14:39,148 --> 00:14:39,908
Are you sure?

104
00:14:40,868 --> 00:14:41,548
Yes!

105
00:15:12,108 --> 00:15:12,748
Fine.

106
00:15:16,268 --> 00:15:16,788
And...

107
00:15:18,428 --> 00:15:19,388
How are you feeling?

108
00:15:20,388 --> 00:15:21,108
Better.

109
00:15:22,268 --> 00:15:22,668
I'm fine.

110
00:15:24,468 --> 00:15:26,348
I have to apologize.

111
00:15:27,428 --> 00:15:29,508
I didn't know Pie bought some shrimps.

112
00:15:30,548 --> 00:15:32,708
He must have put them in when I asked him to help.

113
00:15:33,588 --> 00:15:34,268
It's okay.

114
00:15:35,308 --> 00:15:36,268
Don't blame yourself.

115
00:15:37,308 --> 00:15:38,388
Blame me.

116
00:15:40,108 --> 00:15:41,268
I shouldn't have eaten it.

117
00:15:42,028 --> 00:15:42,428
Right?

118
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:44,668
You're in good mood now.

119
00:15:50,428 --> 00:15:50,788
Then...

120
00:15:52,188 --> 00:15:53,028
I'll leave now.

121
00:15:55,108 --> 00:15:55,628
Erm...

122
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:57,468
You're okay now?

123
00:15:58,348 --> 00:15:58,748
Yeah.

124
00:15:59,308 --> 00:15:59,708
I'm fine.

125
00:16:00,428 --> 00:16:00,908
Great.

126
00:16:09,628 --> 00:16:11,868
The wait for the couple comets

127
00:16:12,908 --> 00:16:15,068
that return to each other every 70 years.

128
00:16:16,828 --> 00:16:17,708
It's believed that

129
00:16:18,348 --> 00:16:20,828
we can make a wish upon those comets.

130
00:16:29,428 --> 00:16:29,828
When?

131
00:16:30,388 --> 00:16:30,668
What?

132
00:16:33,908 --> 00:16:34,708
Oh!

133
00:16:35,348 --> 00:16:36,228
Quite a while.

134
00:16:36,908 --> 00:16:37,948
14th February.

135
00:16:42,748 --> 00:16:42,988
Eh?

136
00:16:43,748 --> 00:16:44,508
What are you doing?

137
00:16:45,788 --> 00:16:46,708
Just a little.

138
00:16:47,668 --> 00:16:48,308
Don't be stingy.

139
00:17:00,748 --> 00:17:01,188
You're booked.

140
00:17:04,188 --> 00:17:04,788
Eh?

141
00:17:06,428 --> 00:17:06,908
What?

142
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:09,108
Here.

143
00:17:26,508 --> 00:17:27,468
Let's watch it together.

144
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:43,388
Sure.

145
00:17:44,828 --> 00:17:46,348
I have two telescopes anyway.

146
00:17:47,468 --> 00:17:47,868
Promise?

147
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:50,308
Yeah.

148
00:17:52,508 --> 00:17:53,028
Oh.

149
00:17:53,588 --> 00:17:54,788
Your clothes are still wet.

150
00:17:58,828 --> 00:17:59,948
Wear mine.

151
00:18:02,468 --> 00:18:02,908
Here.

152
00:19:16,268 --> 00:19:16,788
Ready?

153
00:19:17,228 --> 00:19:17,668
Yes, sir.

154
00:19:18,108 --> 00:19:20,348
I sent your proof of transfer

155
00:19:20,588 --> 00:19:22,988
to the executor of the estate in England.

156
00:19:23,388 --> 00:19:24,988
This place is now yours

157
00:19:25,228 --> 00:19:27,148
and Kannakul's group.

158
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:31,788
I and every staff member have to leave this place immediately.

159
00:19:31,948 --> 00:19:32,188
Oh.

160
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:33,508
So soon?

161
00:19:33,828 --> 00:19:34,268
Yes.

162
00:19:34,628 --> 00:19:37,308
We have other projects to take care of.

163
00:19:37,668 --> 00:19:39,628
So we have to leave promptly.

164
00:19:40,268 --> 00:19:40,788
Okay.

165
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:42,308
Then...

166
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:44,708
I'll find someone to take care of this place.

167
00:19:45,868 --> 00:19:47,708
And for other documents

168
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,628
like utility bills,

169
00:19:49,868 --> 00:19:52,348
I'll let my son, Rain,

170
00:19:53,268 --> 00:19:55,268
and his lawyer take care of them.

171
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:56,028
Great.

172
00:19:57,468 --> 00:19:58,828
Big first job, eh?

173
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:02,108
I'll need your guidance a lot more.

174
00:20:03,028 --> 00:20:03,828
My pleasure.

175
00:20:04,668 --> 00:20:05,348
Ready?

176
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,988
Take them to the helipad.

177
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:10,228
And drive Dr. Sookwan

178
00:20:10,548 --> 00:20:11,788
to Mae Tha in Lampang.

179
00:20:12,188 --> 00:20:13,228
Yes, sir.

180
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:14,228
This way.

181
00:20:19,148 --> 00:20:19,628
Goodbye.

182
00:20:20,108 --> 00:20:20,588
Goodbye.

183
00:20:20,828 --> 00:20:22,908
Have a safe trip.

184
00:20:52,388 --> 00:20:53,588
We get to be closer now.

185
00:20:55,388 --> 00:20:56,788
I'll tell you everything.

186
00:21:52,879 --> 00:21:54,089
We get to be closer now.

187
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:57,249
I'll tell you everything.

188
00:22:26,289 --> 00:22:27,199
You're still wet.

189
00:22:27,999 --> 00:22:28,809
Hey! You!

190
00:22:33,929 --> 00:22:35,199
I've got no cash on me.

191
00:22:36,009 --> 00:22:36,959
1,200 baht, right?

192
00:22:37,499 --> 00:22:39,229
- Yes
- I'll pay along with my order.

193
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:40,109
Okay.

194
00:22:41,529 --> 00:22:42,879
Don't say I'm meddlesome.

195
00:22:43,369 --> 00:22:45,499
I just lent you so she can close the shop.

196
00:22:46,649 --> 00:22:47,869
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

197
00:22:51,489 --> 00:22:53,679
Thank you for everything.

198
00:22:54,809 --> 00:22:58,079
You make our band more completed.

199
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,169
When you say nice stuffs,

200
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:01,999
you're so warm.

201
00:23:02,609 --> 00:23:03,249
So cozy.

202
00:23:05,049 --> 00:23:06,369
Don't you want to have a lover?

203
00:23:19,469 --> 00:23:20,689
Rain, you don't have to worry

204
00:23:22,479 --> 00:23:24,379
I won't be lonely anymore.

205
00:23:29,819 --> 00:23:32,139
I've found the one for me.

206
00:23:41,209 --> 00:23:41,629
Hey.

207
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:52,799
Eat them all.

208
00:23:53,819 --> 00:23:54,909
I cleaned them for you.

209
00:23:58,939 --> 00:23:59,869
I'm right here.

210
00:24:01,689 --> 00:24:03,609
I won't let anything happen to you.

211
00:24:04,639 --> 00:24:05,439
I promise.

212
00:24:32,059 --> 00:24:32,489
Hello.

213
00:24:33,069 --> 00:24:33,419
Hello.

214
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,689
I thought Pilot Kanchit will be here today.

215
00:24:44,879 --> 00:24:45,769
I'm his substitute.

216
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:47,969
You must be my co-pilot.

217
00:24:49,169 --> 00:24:49,969
Nice to meet you.

218
00:24:51,499 --> 00:24:51,679
Yes.

219
00:24:52,509 --> 00:24:53,199
I'm Prapan.

220
00:24:54,399 --> 00:24:55,899
It's not actually my shift.

221
00:24:56,269 --> 00:24:57,529
But I got an emergency call.

222
00:24:58,109 --> 00:25:00,109
And they said I'm the only pilot.

223
00:25:01,179 --> 00:25:01,469
Uh...

224
00:25:01,949 --> 00:25:03,099
I need to recheck.

225
00:25:03,819 --> 00:25:04,879
I think...

226
00:25:05,249 --> 00:25:05,849
It's okay.

227
00:25:06,729 --> 00:25:07,969
There must be some changes.

228
00:25:08,609 --> 00:25:10,189
Our clients today are SVIP.

229
00:25:11,389 --> 00:25:11,849
They're here.

230
00:25:12,649 --> 00:25:14,719
We shouldn't be late, or we'll get complained.

231
00:25:15,929 --> 00:25:16,289
Okay.

232
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:19,209
I'll leave the black box setting

233
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:22,129
in your care, Mr. Prapan.

234
00:25:22,969 --> 00:25:23,519
Roger that.

235
00:25:42,929 --> 00:25:45,169
Are you sure you're not coming with us?

236
00:25:45,629 --> 00:25:46,449
Yeah.

237
00:25:46,749 --> 00:25:49,119
I have a meeting at Mae Tha hotel.

238
00:25:49,569 --> 00:25:52,909
We'll see each other again in 3 days at Chiang Rai airport anyway.

239
00:25:54,779 --> 00:25:56,209
Thank you Doctor.

240
00:25:56,849 --> 00:25:57,579
Well.

241
00:25:58,089 --> 00:25:59,599
Have a nice trip.

242
00:26:00,169 --> 00:26:01,569
Thank you.

243
00:27:07,249 --> 00:27:08,219
It's so beautiful.

244
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:20,449
Isn't that Sookwan's van?

245
00:27:22,109 --> 00:27:23,249
Not in Lampang's direction.

246
00:27:25,999 --> 00:27:27,499
She said she's going to Mae Tha.

247
00:27:34,239 --> 00:27:36,369
She's supposed to go the other way.

248
00:27:37,019 --> 00:27:38,169
That's the way to the airport.

249
00:27:38,939 --> 00:27:39,629
The same as ours.

250
00:27:40,749 --> 00:27:42,729
If she's going to fly to Lampang,

251
00:27:43,439 --> 00:27:44,559
why won't she come with us?

252
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:47,039
Maybe more comfortable.

253
00:27:55,179 --> 00:27:56,589
To Chiang Rai airport.

254
00:27:57,119 --> 00:27:58,169
Hurry.

255
00:27:58,609 --> 00:27:59,199
Yes, ma'am.

256
00:28:53,259 --> 00:28:53,819
Sir!

257
00:28:54,189 --> 00:28:54,969
What's wrong?!

258
00:28:55,789 --> 00:28:58,449
Propellers aren't working.
I'm currently using APU.

259
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:12,249
How about auto pilot?

260
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:13,649
No!

261
00:29:14,769 --> 00:29:15,739
Wait for my orders.

262
00:29:16,539 --> 00:29:18,029
Do something!

263
00:29:18,729 --> 00:29:19,369
I can't.

264
00:29:20,459 --> 00:29:21,609
We need to go up!

265
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:38,289
It's the survival of the fittest.

266
00:29:49,739 --> 00:29:50,459
Goodbye.

267
00:30:23,979 --> 00:30:25,009
Excuse me.

268
00:30:26,829 --> 00:30:27,289
Payoo.

269
00:30:29,129 --> 00:30:30,059
What's happening?

270
00:30:31,849 --> 00:30:32,609
No...

271
00:30:41,409 --> 00:30:42,729
Are you okay, Master Kim?

272
00:30:43,489 --> 00:30:44,329
Butler Santi.

273
00:30:46,379 --> 00:30:47,489
What happened?

274
00:30:48,909 --> 00:30:50,269
Why am I here?

275
00:30:52,879 --> 00:30:54,139
You're in a car accident.

276
00:30:57,169 --> 00:30:57,469
And...

277
00:30:58,139 --> 00:30:59,449
Does anybody hurt?

278
00:31:00,509 --> 00:31:01,039
No.

279
00:31:01,499 --> 00:31:02,349
Mistress.

280
00:31:04,589 --> 00:31:05,579
I shouldn't have.

281
00:31:07,149 --> 00:31:08,459
I shouldn't have.

282
00:31:09,009 --> 00:31:10,029
Master.

283
00:31:16,449 --> 00:31:17,499
Butler?

284
00:31:18,889 --> 00:31:20,129
What happened?

285
00:31:24,029 --> 00:31:25,099
Butler Santi!

286
00:31:25,099 --> 00:31:25,569
Master Rain.

287
00:31:27,249 --> 00:31:28,729
I said what happened?!

288
00:31:48,829 --> 00:31:49,549
Payoo.

289
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:51,929
What happened?

290
00:32:01,689 --> 00:32:03,049
Tell me!

291
00:32:05,689 --> 00:32:06,779
Mistress.

292
00:32:28,619 --> 00:32:29,369
Master.

293
00:32:44,769 --> 00:32:45,469
Master Rain.

294
00:32:45,999 --> 00:32:46,799
Master Rain.

295
00:32:48,879 --> 00:32:49,469
Mr. Rain.

296
00:32:50,059 --> 00:32:50,829
Where's Mr. Rain?

297
00:32:52,049 --> 00:32:53,969
There are only 3 corpses sent here.

298
00:32:55,019 --> 00:32:56,329
No. No. No. No. No!

299
00:32:57,069 --> 00:32:57,819
Impossible.

300
00:32:59,339 --> 00:33:00,489
Where's Mr. Rain?

301
00:33:02,509 --> 00:33:04,139
There are just these 3 corpses.

302
00:33:05,099 --> 00:33:05,849
No!

303
00:33:09,199 --> 00:33:10,109
Something's wrong.

304
00:33:10,669 --> 00:33:11,149
Master Kim.

305
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:12,429
- No!
- Let me go!

306
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:13,679
- Master Kim!
- Let me go!

307
00:33:14,609 --> 00:33:15,069
Master Kim!

308
00:33:23,739 --> 00:33:24,299
Stop!

309
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:33,739
Wow.

310
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:37,519
You wear new watch just to buy a villa?

311
00:34:07,069 --> 00:34:07,979
Dad!

312
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:11,129
Dad.

313
00:34:17,019 --> 00:34:17,519
Mom!

314
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:26,509
Mom.

315
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:28,539
Mom.

316
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:39,979
Mom.

317
00:34:45,629 --> 00:34:48,289
Tell me what happened!!

318
00:34:49,419 --> 00:34:50,809
What the hell happened?!

319
00:34:53,979 --> 00:34:54,829
It's not true.

320
00:35:05,809 --> 00:35:06,139
Dad.

321
00:35:16,129 --> 00:35:17,709
I did everything

322
00:35:19,019 --> 00:35:20,349
for both of you.

323
00:35:21,209 --> 00:35:24,009
But you might think that I don't understand you.

324
00:35:24,459 --> 00:35:25,259
But if you're me,

325
00:35:27,759 --> 00:35:28,959
you'd understand.

326
00:35:29,999 --> 00:35:31,089
I'll try to.

327
00:35:50,539 --> 00:35:51,359
Dad!

328
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:54,779
It's not true.

329
00:36:04,569 --> 00:36:05,529
Dad!

330
00:36:14,809 --> 00:36:16,299
The younger heir

331
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:19,899
was injured in a motorcycle accident.

332
00:36:20,349 --> 00:36:21,069
Kim!

333
00:36:45,458 --> 00:36:45,858
Found him?

334
00:36:46,818 --> 00:36:47,698
No, sir.

335
00:36:48,858 --> 00:36:50,298
We're more than 5KM radius

336
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:53,098
of the helicopter crash site.

337
00:36:53,618 --> 00:36:54,258
Right.

338
00:36:54,738 --> 00:36:56,658
But there's no trace at all.

339
00:36:57,338 --> 00:36:59,058
It's a dark tropical rain forest.

340
00:36:59,658 --> 00:37:01,898
We can't search via helicopter.

341
00:37:02,138 --> 00:37:03,898
Keep searching!

342
00:37:04,258 --> 00:37:04,858
Yes, sir.

343
00:37:07,218 --> 00:37:07,458
Go.

344
00:37:19,058 --> 00:37:20,458
Why isn't Rain found yet?

345
00:37:22,538 --> 00:37:23,458
At the crash site,

346
00:37:25,218 --> 00:37:26,858
there's no trace of him.

347
00:37:29,898 --> 00:37:30,578
Why...

348
00:37:36,258 --> 00:37:36,938
The helicopter

349
00:37:39,378 --> 00:37:40,418
exploded.

350
00:37:47,058 --> 00:37:47,458
And...

351
00:37:48,578 --> 00:37:48,818
Er...

352
00:37:51,378 --> 00:37:52,818
They're engulfed in flames.

353
00:37:54,498 --> 00:37:55,458
And it's very dark.

354
00:38:03,738 --> 00:38:04,778
I'll find him.

355
00:38:06,098 --> 00:38:07,898
- Master Kim!
- Let me go!

356
00:38:07,898 --> 00:38:08,458
Let me go!

357
00:38:08,458 --> 00:38:10,738
The officials are searching for him!

358
00:38:11,138 --> 00:38:11,898
Calm down.

359
00:38:11,898 --> 00:38:14,018
Everyone's looking for him.

360
00:38:14,098 --> 00:38:15,338
I'll find my brother!

361
00:38:15,338 --> 00:38:15,938
Master!

362
00:38:16,378 --> 00:38:17,338
Calm down.

363
00:38:17,338 --> 00:38:17,938
Let me go.

364
00:38:18,058 --> 00:38:19,058
- Master.
- Let me go.

365
00:38:19,978 --> 00:38:20,418
Master.

366
00:38:21,658 --> 00:38:22,218
Master Kim.

367
00:38:23,978 --> 00:38:24,578
Nurse!

368
00:38:25,138 --> 00:38:25,898
Nurse!

369
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:26,818
Nurse!

370
00:38:26,818 --> 00:38:28,618
That must be from the accident.

371
00:38:32,138 --> 00:38:33,538
I'll give him painkiller.

372
00:38:34,618 --> 00:38:35,378
My head hurts.

373
00:38:36,178 --> 00:38:37,098
Breathe.

374
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:39,578
Calm down.

375
00:38:41,658 --> 00:38:42,498
It hurts.

376
00:38:43,098 --> 00:38:43,898
Breathe.

377
00:38:46,258 --> 00:38:46,858
Done.

378
00:38:49,738 --> 00:38:50,378
How are you?

379
00:38:52,338 --> 00:38:52,938
Fine.

380
00:38:53,538 --> 00:38:54,298
I'm fine.

381
00:38:56,338 --> 00:38:58,898
There's been a shocking accident.

382
00:38:59,258 --> 00:39:01,618
Kacha Kannakul and his wife,

383
00:39:01,858 --> 00:39:03,618
a real estate billionaire,

384
00:39:03,898 --> 00:39:06,618
were found dead in helicopter crash in Chiang Rai

385
00:39:06,978 --> 00:39:09,218
along with one pilot.

386
00:39:09,578 --> 00:39:12,298
A cause of the crash hasn't been identified as of now.

387
00:39:12,778 --> 00:39:16,858
Furthermore, Wasan Kannakul, the eldest heir was also on board.

388
00:39:17,218 --> 00:39:17,818
However,

389
00:39:18,178 --> 00:39:19,538
- He hasn't been found yet.
- Rain!

390
00:39:19,538 --> 00:39:22,098
Chiang Rai's forest rangers and local police

391
00:39:22,418 --> 00:39:25,058
are currently searching for him.

392
00:39:25,618 --> 00:39:27,858
- Morever,
- Rain...

393
00:39:28,018 --> 00:39:32,658
The younger heir was injured in a motorcycle accident.

394
00:39:32,658 --> 00:39:33,378
Kim!

395
00:39:33,698 --> 00:39:35,378
He's admitted to Piyathani Hospital.

396
00:39:35,658 --> 00:39:38,818
We will keep you updated once we receive more information.

397
00:39:38,818 --> 00:39:39,538
Chuenjit!

398
00:39:39,738 --> 00:39:40,498
Chuenjit!

399
00:39:41,018 --> 00:39:41,658
Yes?

400
00:39:42,458 --> 00:39:44,498
Get my car ready.
I'm going to the hospital.

401
00:39:50,978 --> 00:39:51,898
Why...

402
00:39:52,338 --> 00:39:53,658
Why must this happen?

403
00:39:54,338 --> 00:39:55,018
Master.

404
00:39:56,618 --> 00:39:58,938
You need to recover here.

405
00:39:59,818 --> 00:40:01,498
Wait for more information.

406
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:05,258
I can't sit around and wait here.

407
00:40:05,698 --> 00:40:06,938
Trust me.

408
00:40:08,618 --> 00:40:10,418
We can't do anything

409
00:40:11,378 --> 00:40:12,178
but wait.

410
00:40:19,818 --> 00:40:21,378
As expected,

411
00:40:21,498 --> 00:40:25,338
there's intracerebral hemorrhage from the accident.

412
00:40:26,338 --> 00:40:27,618
How will that affect him?

413
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:30,098
We'll have to wait and see.

414
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:33,098
Because both his physical and mental condition

415
00:40:33,538 --> 00:40:35,898
are not ready for any surgery.

416
00:40:36,378 --> 00:40:38,098
If we use drug to breakdown blood clot,

417
00:40:38,498 --> 00:40:41,138
the blood will be drained out automatically.

418
00:40:41,858 --> 00:40:45,778
But there's a chance that the blood clot will damage the nerves

419
00:40:46,018 --> 00:40:49,378
and cause him to be lethargic or confused,

420
00:40:49,698 --> 00:40:52,618
or could lead to partial memory loss.

421
00:40:53,378 --> 00:40:54,498
What are the symptoms?

422
00:40:55,098 --> 00:40:58,458
It depends on the hemorrhage location.

423
00:40:58,938 --> 00:41:00,738
He may have complete memory loss.

424
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:04,418
Or partial memory loss, jumbled memory.

425
00:41:06,658 --> 00:41:07,578
Poor Master Kim.

426
00:41:08,778 --> 00:41:10,378
I didn't know it's this bad.

427
00:41:25,898 --> 00:41:26,338
Ouch.

428
00:41:27,458 --> 00:41:30,098
I will not let you hurt again.

429
00:41:31,818 --> 00:41:33,258
If you want to do me a favor,

430
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,338
take care of Kim while I'm not here.

431
00:41:37,058 --> 00:41:37,618
Just that.

432
00:41:48,938 --> 00:41:49,698
Damn you.

433
00:41:49,898 --> 00:41:50,338
Rain!

434
00:41:51,418 --> 00:41:52,458
If I'm not here,

435
00:41:53,458 --> 00:41:54,858
you'll have to laugh like this.

436
00:41:56,178 --> 00:41:56,898
Where you going?

437
00:42:01,898 --> 00:42:02,738
You're okay by yourself?

438
00:42:04,938 --> 00:42:05,778
I'll be fine.

439
00:42:09,138 --> 00:42:09,578
Rain.

440
00:42:13,058 --> 00:42:13,698
Don't worry.

441
00:42:14,018 --> 00:42:17,138
I'll come back to compete diving with you, brother.

442
00:42:40,258 --> 00:42:41,378
There may be something

443
00:42:42,338 --> 00:42:44,098
more than just an accident.

444
00:42:44,618 --> 00:42:46,618
Protect Master Kim with your life.

445
00:42:46,978 --> 00:42:48,018
Don't let him out of sight.

446
00:42:48,138 --> 00:42:49,458
I'll go to the hospital.

447
00:42:50,098 --> 00:42:52,018
So I can finish everything.

448
00:42:52,298 --> 00:42:53,698
You must get some rest.

449
00:42:54,058 --> 00:42:55,578
If something happens to you,

450
00:42:56,738 --> 00:42:58,698
Kannakul Group must be in ruin.

451
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:07,538
Oh, sorry.

452
00:43:07,538 --> 00:43:08,578
Wrong room.

453
00:45:18,578 --> 00:45:21,258
There's been a shocking accident.

454
00:45:21,538 --> 00:45:23,818
Kacha Kannakul and his wife,

455
00:45:24,218 --> 00:45:25,938
a real estate billionaire,

456
00:45:26,218 --> 00:45:28,818
were found dead in helicopter crash in Chiang Rai

457
00:45:29,578 --> 00:45:32,138
Madam, the dinner's ready.

458
00:45:32,818 --> 00:45:34,578
I'll be right there.

459
00:45:35,098 --> 00:45:39,218
Furthermore, Wasan Kannakul, the eldest heir was also on board.

460
00:45:39,458 --> 00:45:41,738
However, he hasn't been found yet.

461
00:45:41,778 --> 00:45:44,378
Chiang Rai's forest rangers and local police

462
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:47,298
are currently searching for him.

463
00:45:47,858 --> 00:45:50,298
Moreoever,

464
00:45:50,418 --> 00:45:55,658
The younger heir was injured in a motorcycle accident.

465
00:45:55,978 --> 00:45:57,538
He's admitted to Piyathani Hospital.

466
00:45:57,938 --> 00:46:00,978
We will keep you updated once we receive more information.

467
00:46:00,978 --> 00:46:01,778
Chuenjit!

468
00:46:02,058 --> 00:46:02,778
Chuenjit!

469
00:46:03,298 --> 00:46:03,978
Yes?

470
00:46:04,738 --> 00:46:06,818
Get my car ready.
I'm going to the hospital.

471
00:46:07,298 --> 00:46:08,778
Something's wrong?

472
00:46:09,698 --> 00:46:10,298
Yes!
