1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,720
If you put effort in my job as much as in what you carry,

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:05,880
I'd die peacefully.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:07,760
Today,

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,880
you exceeded my expectation.

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:11,720
Sun.

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,160
You can say nice things now.

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,960
Is he insulting me?

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,520
You're about to graduate.

9
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:21,920
Aren't you glad?

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,680
Or...

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,080
There's something to care for?

12
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,640
I have two more days of my life
before giving it all to you.

13
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,160
Why so late?

14
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,480
M...Mr. Rain!

15
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,280
You want to come home late because everyone's asleep?

16
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,600
It's crowded tonight.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,720
Really?

18
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,200
This time of month?

19
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:07,960
Yeah.

20
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,640
I'll believe you then.

21
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,560
And I'm happy that you believe me.

22
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,600
And don't wait for me.

23
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:24,800
Payoo.

24
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,200
Don't trade your life for me again.

25
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,640
It's not worth it.

26
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,440
Promise me.

27
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,000
Follow your own path.

28
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,280
Okay?

29
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:48,720
Okay.

30
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,360
I promise.

31
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,360
Good.

32
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,120
Nice.

33
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,080
Er...

34
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,360
Why are you

35
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,480
standing here in the dark?

36
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,480
Just for some fresh air.

37
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,160
And I just competed diving with Kim.

38
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,840
Oh.

39
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,560
And...

40
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,280
You lose again?

41
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,120
You know us well.

42
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,480
Since I was young,

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,480
I've never won against him.

44
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,080
And...

45
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,920
Do you know why?

46
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,240
Hope, maybe.

47
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:43,880
Er...

48
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,840
It's hope

49
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,960
that makes Master Kim hold his breath so long

50
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,800
that he doesn't need air.

51
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,760
So, if I want to win...

52
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,760
You...

53
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,640
need to find your hope.

54
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,480
I'm sorry I said that.

55
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,840
Hey, it's okay.

56
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,480
Oh.

57
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,080
Your head's wet and you're out here.

58
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,840
You might catch a cold.

59
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,880
You need to travel tomorrow too.

60
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,000
Worried about me?

61
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,720
I'm not worried at all.

62
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,800
I have you.

63
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,360
Er...

64
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,640
This towel's wet.

65
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,120
I'll bring the dry one for you.

66
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,360
Er... I'll get you the dry one.

67
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,720
Uh huh.

68
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:49,920
Here.

69
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,120
I don't think that'd make your hair dry.

70
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,000
Excuse me.

71
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,000
Okay.

72
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,640
After coming back from the camp

73
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,120
of music and sports club,

74
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,200
I have to go on a business trip with father.

75
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,680
Maybe for a while.

76
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,160
He wants to close a deal.

77
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,040
Do you like this place?

78
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,320
Iguazu falls?

79
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,320
Yeah.

80
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:31,920
I like it.

81
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,440
Why?

82
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,480
It's beautiful.

83
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,040
What else?

84
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,480
Hm...

85
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,240
It's imposing.

86
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,080
But cold.

87
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,920
How? I'd like to see it.

88
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,560
Okay.

89
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,240
I've only seen it from afar.

90
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,760
Never notice that

91
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,440
it's so beautiful.

92
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:33,760
Yeah.

93
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,360
I want to see

94
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,320
if the real one is
as beautiful as what's in front of me.

95
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,280
I never knew this side of you.

96
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,880
Dry my hair.

97
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,160
Okay.

98
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,280
Excuse me.

99
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,880
You'd better do it.

100
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,400
I'll get you some clothes before you catch a cold.

101
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:38,800
Thanks.

102
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,080
I'll take a bath now.

103
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,480
I've been bustling about and forgot to pack my stuff!

104
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,080
Not now, Sun.

105
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,560
If I miss the bus,

106
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,880
I'll blame you Zombie.

107
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,000
Just saying your name

108
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,200
can cure me?

109
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,480
I hope that these two days

110
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,640
you won't hurt me.

111
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,840
Do you think I'm that disgusting?

112
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,840
I bet Rain doesn't think so.

113
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,160
Because he doesn't,

114
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,760
that's why he did it.

115
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:49,472
[Baibua]
Are you home yet?

116
00:17:19,152 --> 00:17:19,992
What to do?

117
00:18:02,872 --> 00:18:06,872
Welcome to annual music & sports bonding camp.

118
00:18:07,032 --> 00:18:10,192
Everyone from any faculties or major is welcomed.

119
00:18:10,392 --> 00:18:11,532
It's almost the end of semester.

120
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:14,432
Our club will make you have fun.

121
00:18:14,732 --> 00:18:17,272
Get on the bus quickly if you're here.

122
00:18:17,532 --> 00:18:19,492
Fun activities await you all.

123
00:18:19,752 --> 00:18:22,732
I guarantee you'll have fun.

124
00:20:31,032 --> 00:20:31,392
Here.

125
00:20:31,932 --> 00:20:32,472
Apples.

126
00:20:33,292 --> 00:20:34,052
I washed them.

127
00:20:34,852 --> 00:20:35,692
Eat these here.

128
00:20:36,832 --> 00:20:37,432
And eat these

129
00:20:38,452 --> 00:20:39,272
when we arrive.

130
00:20:41,312 --> 00:20:42,332
My maid prepared them.

131
00:21:07,112 --> 00:21:09,592
Room No. 203 - Petch and Pie.

132
00:21:09,592 --> 00:21:10,192
Okay.

133
00:21:10,192 --> 00:21:13,552
Room No. 204 - Tony and Oh.

134
00:21:13,792 --> 00:21:16,232
Rain and Shun - Room No. 403.

135
00:21:16,492 --> 00:21:19,732
Payoo and Sun - Room No. 303.

136
00:21:23,972 --> 00:21:25,952
Switch room with me, my lovely code-brother.

137
00:21:29,052 --> 00:21:29,552
Okay.

138
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,932
Let's go. My 303 roommate.

139
00:21:41,272 --> 00:21:43,672
Toy and Kim - Room No. 404.

140
00:21:53,572 --> 00:21:54,012
Oh.

141
00:21:55,852 --> 00:21:56,632
Double bed.

142
00:22:19,192 --> 00:22:21,032
Ah... So tired.

143
00:22:31,572 --> 00:22:32,172
Looking for what?

144
00:22:35,012 --> 00:22:35,852
Additional bed.

145
00:22:38,532 --> 00:22:40,152
Don't be troublesome.

146
00:22:41,952 --> 00:22:43,912
It's a waste of money to request one.

147
00:22:45,932 --> 00:22:46,932
Just sleep with me.

148
00:22:50,772 --> 00:22:51,512
Mr. Rain...

149
00:22:51,992 --> 00:22:52,392
I think...

150
00:23:29,932 --> 00:23:30,272
Er...

151
00:23:31,732 --> 00:23:32,152
I...

152
00:23:33,372 --> 00:23:34,692
I'll take a bath.

153
00:24:08,652 --> 00:24:09,792
Wow!

154
00:24:13,832 --> 00:24:15,152
Wow.

155
00:24:29,692 --> 00:24:30,072
Sun.

156
00:24:30,512 --> 00:24:31,032
What?

157
00:24:32,592 --> 00:24:35,252
Do you think I'm that disgusting?

158
00:24:39,872 --> 00:24:40,932
What the hell?

159
00:24:46,032 --> 00:24:47,872
I bet Rain doesn't think so.

160
00:24:51,212 --> 00:24:52,072
You're right.

161
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,012
Because he doesn't,

162
00:24:58,172 --> 00:24:59,172
that's why he did it.

163
00:25:04,692 --> 00:25:05,732
You're tired?

164
00:25:12,012 --> 00:25:14,092
Yeah, but I won't give up.

165
00:25:17,452 --> 00:25:18,512
I'm honest.

166
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:21,592
If he doesn't care,

167
00:25:22,232 --> 00:25:23,112
I don't mind.

168
00:25:24,332 --> 00:25:25,372
If I'm happy with it,

169
00:25:25,912 --> 00:25:26,852
I'll do it.

170
00:25:29,632 --> 00:25:31,652
That's my Shun!

171
00:25:34,072 --> 00:25:35,312
I'll take a bath.

172
00:25:35,312 --> 00:25:36,592
And then let's take a walk.

173
00:25:36,692 --> 00:25:37,252
Okay?

174
00:25:37,492 --> 00:25:38,172
Okay.

175
00:25:52,952 --> 00:25:55,572
Now's the last game of the night.

176
00:25:55,572 --> 00:25:58,632
The first person you see face to face

177
00:25:58,992 --> 00:26:01,172
will be named your 'soul mate.'

178
00:26:30,473 --> 00:26:31,813
I didn't expect to see you here.

179
00:26:45,653 --> 00:26:47,433
Didn't know you'd take a walk around here.

180
00:26:51,293 --> 00:26:52,633
I think you know.

181
00:26:55,593 --> 00:26:56,393
Clever.

182
00:26:59,393 --> 00:27:00,093
Actually,

183
00:27:01,233 --> 00:27:02,233
you're not hard to read.

184
00:27:05,293 --> 00:27:06,073
Then...

185
00:27:07,493 --> 00:27:08,533
Read me now.

186
00:27:09,533 --> 00:27:10,773
What am I thinking?

187
00:27:18,213 --> 00:27:19,973
The one who can read you like a book

188
00:27:21,153 --> 00:27:21,813
is there.

189
00:27:22,813 --> 00:27:23,733
Ask him instead.

190
00:27:31,713 --> 00:27:32,093
What?

191
00:27:33,473 --> 00:27:33,833
Kim.

192
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:42,073
Such a try-hard.

193
00:27:45,213 --> 00:27:45,493
Well...

194
00:27:47,253 --> 00:27:48,993
Better than not trying at all.

195
00:27:50,873 --> 00:27:51,853
Who?

196
00:27:54,233 --> 00:27:54,673
No one.

197
00:27:56,553 --> 00:27:56,993
But...

198
00:27:58,013 --> 00:27:59,253
If you think it's you,

199
00:28:00,013 --> 00:28:00,913
you can take it.

200
00:28:06,553 --> 00:28:07,613
You and I

201
00:28:07,893 --> 00:28:10,793
will die if we're nice to each other?

202
00:28:16,533 --> 00:28:18,493
I think it's nice to be here.

203
00:28:22,313 --> 00:28:23,553
If you and I

204
00:28:24,693 --> 00:28:25,993
were not fencers,

205
00:28:26,733 --> 00:28:28,193
did not practice everyday,

206
00:28:29,953 --> 00:28:30,853
maybe

207
00:28:31,913 --> 00:28:35,173
we could go to university together,

208
00:28:36,533 --> 00:28:39,173
or we could have relaxing weekends like anyone.

209
00:28:41,073 --> 00:28:41,873
And...

210
00:28:42,593 --> 00:28:44,293
We might be able to live our own lives.

211
00:28:58,093 --> 00:28:58,993
I'll go take a bath.

212
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:01,733
Key?

213
00:29:03,913 --> 00:29:04,353
Oh.

214
00:30:17,673 --> 00:30:18,333
Thanks.

215
00:30:21,573 --> 00:30:21,973
For?

216
00:30:24,073 --> 00:30:25,013
The apples.

217
00:30:30,153 --> 00:30:30,953
Even if it's not you,

218
00:30:31,853 --> 00:30:32,853
I'd help anyway.

219
00:30:43,433 --> 00:30:43,633
Ouch.

220
00:30:46,393 --> 00:30:47,353
Kim!

221
00:30:48,113 --> 00:30:49,273
Kim.

222
00:30:51,733 --> 00:30:52,433
What's wrong?

223
00:31:50,713 --> 00:31:51,933
Now we're even.

224
00:32:00,593 --> 00:32:01,453
Everyone!

225
00:32:01,673 --> 00:32:03,253
Gather around.

226
00:32:34,533 --> 00:32:36,613
We'll split into two teams.

227
00:32:36,813 --> 00:32:39,033
And we'll play for three sets.

228
00:32:39,653 --> 00:32:42,453
The result of this game is very important.

229
00:32:42,453 --> 00:32:43,053
Because...

230
00:32:43,233 --> 00:32:45,233
It'll affect our tonight activity.

231
00:32:45,513 --> 00:32:47,773
Therefore, I want you all

232
00:32:47,993 --> 00:32:49,753
to do your best!

233
00:32:49,993 --> 00:32:50,893
Ready?

234
00:32:56,153 --> 00:32:57,173
Go!

235
00:32:57,673 --> 00:32:58,393
Like that!

236
00:32:58,393 --> 00:32:59,273
Spike!

237
00:33:01,953 --> 00:33:02,613
Go!

238
00:33:20,073 --> 00:33:20,933
Go!

239
00:33:20,933 --> 00:33:21,733
Like that!

240
00:34:00,433 --> 00:34:01,713
Okay, everyone.

241
00:34:01,993 --> 00:34:04,773
The result of volleyball match this evening is...

242
00:34:04,913 --> 00:34:06,193
We already know

243
00:34:06,473 --> 00:34:07,833
which team won.

244
00:34:08,633 --> 00:34:11,493
The winning team is...

245
00:34:11,913 --> 00:34:12,673
Is...

246
00:34:12,793 --> 00:34:15,673
Captain Rain's team!

247
00:34:15,673 --> 00:34:21,053
Yahoo!

248
00:34:21,053 --> 00:34:22,533
Wow.

249
00:34:22,533 --> 00:34:25,353
Such a great sportsmanship.

250
00:34:25,853 --> 00:34:27,173
Okay then...

251
00:34:27,173 --> 00:34:29,773
Now's the last game of the night.

252
00:34:30,213 --> 00:34:31,513
Which is...

253
00:34:31,853 --> 00:34:33,653
Soul mate hide-n-seek.

254
00:34:35,113 --> 00:34:38,753
The first person you see face to face

255
00:34:39,093 --> 00:34:41,173
will be named your 'soul mate.'

256
00:34:41,753 --> 00:34:44,933
Captain Rain's team is a winner,

257
00:34:45,413 --> 00:34:47,393
so your team will be the hiders.

258
00:34:47,613 --> 00:34:50,593
And the other team will be the seekers.

259
00:34:50,933 --> 00:34:51,573
But...

260
00:34:51,853 --> 00:34:53,833
If you find one of your teammates,

261
00:34:54,113 --> 00:34:55,473
you lose.

262
00:34:56,173 --> 00:34:57,853
And if you want to win,

263
00:34:58,153 --> 00:35:00,153
you must be the last 'soul mate' to find each other.

264
00:35:00,513 --> 00:35:01,573
Remember.

265
00:35:02,013 --> 00:35:04,233
Only the last 'soul mate'

266
00:35:04,493 --> 00:35:05,433
will win.

267
00:35:07,333 --> 00:35:07,753
Okay.

268
00:35:08,853 --> 00:35:10,293
If you're ready,

269
00:35:10,833 --> 00:35:11,453
then...

270
00:35:12,173 --> 00:35:15,833
Captain Rain's team, time to hide!

271
00:35:15,993 --> 00:35:17,273
Get up!

272
00:35:17,273 --> 00:35:18,693
Get up, everyone.

273
00:35:22,793 --> 00:35:23,933
Ready?

274
00:35:24,313 --> 00:35:25,753
Let's go!

275
00:35:25,913 --> 00:35:29,613
Yeah.

276
00:35:35,393 --> 00:35:35,773
Sun!

277
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:37,033
Sun, wake up!

278
00:35:37,433 --> 00:35:37,973
Sun.

279
00:36:57,784 --> 00:36:58,484
Hey!

280
00:36:58,964 --> 00:36:59,544
Oh!

281
00:37:00,764 --> 00:37:01,724
My win.

282
00:37:03,244 --> 00:37:04,884
Why it must be you, Toy.

283
00:37:05,644 --> 00:37:06,044
Why?

284
00:37:06,844 --> 00:37:07,884
What's wrong if it's me?

285
00:37:08,744 --> 00:37:09,704
Disappointed?

286
00:37:10,804 --> 00:37:11,904
Piss off.

287
00:37:13,144 --> 00:37:14,004
Or...

288
00:37:15,224 --> 00:37:17,484
You have someone in your mind?

289
00:37:17,884 --> 00:37:19,064
Really?

290
00:37:19,624 --> 00:37:21,444
Sigh...

291
00:37:26,784 --> 00:37:27,164
Eh..?

292
00:37:28,444 --> 00:37:28,944
What?

293
00:37:30,024 --> 00:37:31,604
Hey, Oh! Wait for me.

294
00:37:43,164 --> 00:37:43,724
Ra...

295
00:37:48,304 --> 00:37:49,384
Tony.

296
00:37:49,784 --> 00:37:50,904
Why are you here?

297
00:37:51,904 --> 00:37:52,344
Why?

298
00:37:53,564 --> 00:37:55,024
Disappointed much?

299
00:37:56,584 --> 00:37:58,424
I know whom you want to find.

300
00:38:01,144 --> 00:38:02,144
I'm also disappointed

301
00:38:02,784 --> 00:38:04,644
to lose to someone like you.

302
00:38:04,964 --> 00:38:06,664
Damn, mosquitoes.

303
00:38:07,344 --> 00:38:07,924
So itchy.

304
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:33,384
Hey!

305
00:38:35,044 --> 00:38:35,504
Petch.

306
00:38:36,504 --> 00:38:37,404
You meant for this.

307
00:38:38,124 --> 00:38:38,844
You and I

308
00:38:39,364 --> 00:38:40,284
are on the same team.

309
00:38:41,544 --> 00:38:42,724
We lose.

310
00:38:44,164 --> 00:38:44,924
And?

311
00:38:49,504 --> 00:38:50,184
Moreover,

312
00:38:50,864 --> 00:38:52,104
I hate this game.

313
00:39:10,704 --> 00:39:11,364
Mr. Rain.

314
00:39:13,844 --> 00:39:15,124
You made us lose.

315
00:39:25,844 --> 00:39:26,644
I'm sorry.

316
00:39:27,184 --> 00:39:28,304
I wasn't careful.

317
00:39:29,824 --> 00:39:30,364
No.

318
00:39:32,724 --> 00:39:33,064
What?

319
00:39:35,124 --> 00:39:36,024
I planned this.

320
00:39:37,464 --> 00:39:38,684
This is just

321
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,344
a child's play.

322
00:39:47,784 --> 00:39:49,304
Don't tell me you believe it?

323
00:39:51,704 --> 00:39:52,724
N...No.

324
00:41:03,484 --> 00:41:04,184
Kim!

325
00:41:08,964 --> 00:41:09,344
Sun!

326
00:41:09,744 --> 00:41:10,164
Sun!

327
00:41:10,884 --> 00:41:11,584
Help!

328
00:41:11,724 --> 00:41:12,784
Anybody's here?

329
00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:14,764
Sun!

330
00:41:18,484 --> 00:41:18,764
Hey.

331
00:41:21,344 --> 00:41:21,804
Sun.

332
00:41:23,724 --> 00:41:24,144
Sun.

333
00:41:25,284 --> 00:41:25,764
Sun.

334
00:41:26,324 --> 00:41:27,144
Wake up, Sun.

335
00:41:36,124 --> 00:41:36,604
Sun.

336
00:41:55,524 --> 00:41:58,184
If you say it from your heart,

337
00:41:58,184 --> 00:41:59,524
there won't be no Kim.

338
00:42:01,304 --> 00:42:03,944
What do I have to do to make you stay?

339
00:42:10,664 --> 00:42:12,004
When I remember,

340
00:42:13,084 --> 00:42:14,524
I'll never forget.

341
00:42:14,944 --> 00:42:15,524
How about me?

342
00:42:16,004 --> 00:42:16,404
What?

343
00:42:17,124 --> 00:42:18,724
Do you want to forget about me

344
00:42:19,584 --> 00:42:20,564
or remember?

345
00:44:36,524 --> 00:44:37,244
Mr. Rain.

346
00:44:39,704 --> 00:44:41,004
You made us lose.

347
00:44:51,704 --> 00:44:52,284
I'm sorry.

348
00:44:52,984 --> 00:44:53,984
I wasn't careful.

349
00:44:55,744 --> 00:44:56,224
No.

350
00:44:58,624 --> 00:44:58,904
What?

351
00:45:00,944 --> 00:45:01,864
I planned this.

352
00:45:03,324 --> 00:45:04,484
This is just

353
00:45:05,024 --> 00:45:06,144
a child's play.

354
00:45:10,564 --> 00:45:11,984
Don't tell me you believe it?

355
00:45:13,964 --> 00:45:15,504
N...No.
