1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,720
What's up there?

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,020
Thank you, bigfoot.

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,010
For giving me good dreams.

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,970
This must be the best solution.

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,160
I'm sorry, dad.

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,980
I'm sorry, dad.

7
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:26,900
Who are you?

8
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,660
Kim lost some of his memories.

9
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:31,960
And I hope that...

10
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:33,740
The coming of his friends

11
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,800
will bring back his memories.

12
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:48,880
Kim.

13
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:52,020
Kim!

14
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,410
How are guys here?

15
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:12,300
Well...

16
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,060
[Kim]

17
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,740
[Kim]

18
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:20,980
Hello, Kim!

19
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:22,490
Kim!

20
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:24,180
Sun.

21
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,640
It's Payoo.

22
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,090
Payoo.

23
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,160
Er...

24
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:32,530
How's Kim?

25
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,400
We can't contact him.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,610
Right.

27
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,240
Where's Kim?

28
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,100
Er...

29
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,060
Sun.

30
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,580
Please tell everyone

31
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:43,780
that Master Kim is safe.

32
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,480
Payoo said Kim is safe.

33
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:49,060
Sun.

34
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,170
Please turn on the speaker.

35
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,240
Okay.

36
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:01,080
I want you and Kim's friends to come here.

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,900
Where?

38
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:06,700
Chiang Rai.

39
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:13,780
That's it.

40
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,420
So we...

41
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,760
came to see you here.

42
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,490
How are you?

43
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,040
I'm fine.

44
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,970
But I still stand by my words.

45
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,240
I'm not okay for you all to stay here.

46
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,220
Er...

47
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,120
Everyone, let's get your stuffs to your room.

48
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:48,890
Payoo.

49
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,330
Uh...

50
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,160
I don't think it's possible to travel now.

51
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,530
I'll arrange their trip later.

52
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,300
- But...
- Okay, everyone.

53
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,250
It's self-service.
We have no staffs here.

54
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,040
Let's go.

55
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:02,060
Tony.

56
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:06,080
Let's meet in the dining room after this.

57
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,020
Payoo will...

58
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,360
Take you on a tour around this villa.

59
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,690
Yeah.

60
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,280
We have a lot to see.

61
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:15,540
Don't forget.

62
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:16,770
Everyone.

63
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,960
Hurry up.

64
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,650
What?

65
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,290
Why so hurry?

66
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:54,500
Thanks, Toy.

67
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,220
Is there something up there?

68
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:26,680
I'm Sun.

69
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,780
I remember.

70
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:32,420
I'm Kim.

71
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,650
I know.

72
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:39,380
It'd be horrible If I don't know the owner of the house

73
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,370
and come here.

74
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,400
So can you tell me

75
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,700
what's up there?

76
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,140
A promise.

77
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,000
I think

78
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:04,600
it's a promise.

79
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,620
With whom?

80
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,800
About what?

81
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:17,480
Can you tell me?

82
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,080
I don't know.

83
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:24,650
If I know,

84
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,780
I won't tell you.

85
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,410
Otherwise, it's not a promise.

86
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,080
Right?

87
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,000
How do you know Payoo?

88
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:50,540
Well...

89
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,680
From his relationship with my brother.

90
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:56,740
Rain?

91
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,620
You know him?

92
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,500
In this university,

93
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,160
there's no one who doesn't know Wasan Kannakul.

94
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:12,340
And...

95
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,730
Do you know

96
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,360
Kimhan Kannakul?

97
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,290
Heh.

98
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,340
Zombie?

99
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,100
Everybody knows.

100
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,340
Seems polar opposite.

101
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,780
Seems like...

102
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,740
You can remember your distant past.

103
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,920
Someone who had stories

104
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,130
and interactions with you.

105
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:02,360
Do we have any

106
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,770
stories or interactions?

107
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:36,200
Judging from your face,

108
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,610
I guess it's not a good one.

109
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,440
You think so?

110
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:16,820
You keep staring at them.

111
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:19,300
How do you feel?

112
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,040
Hurt?

113
00:11:59,975 --> 00:12:00,715
Snow White.

114
00:12:45,035 --> 00:12:45,775
Snow White.

115
00:12:54,055 --> 00:12:54,695
Who's there?

116
00:12:55,865 --> 00:12:56,455
Master Kim.

117
00:12:57,295 --> 00:12:57,895
It's me.

118
00:12:59,485 --> 00:12:59,995
Payoo.

119
00:13:01,005 --> 00:13:02,095
Why are you here?

120
00:13:03,785 --> 00:13:04,235
Uh...

121
00:13:04,955 --> 00:13:07,055
I... heard Snow White's neigh.

122
00:13:07,215 --> 00:13:08,015
So I came here.

123
00:13:09,005 --> 00:13:11,975
I'm worried about pythons sneaking in.

124
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:15,355
I saw some in the forest the other day.

125
00:13:16,015 --> 00:13:16,315
So...

126
00:13:17,355 --> 00:13:18,475
Did you find any?

127
00:13:21,225 --> 00:13:23,035
I've looked around and found none.

128
00:13:25,325 --> 00:13:25,645
Good.

129
00:13:27,785 --> 00:13:30,055
We should go back.

130
00:13:31,295 --> 00:13:33,195
It's dangerous here at night.

131
00:13:34,205 --> 00:13:34,985
Let's go.

132
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,175
Okay.

133
00:13:41,725 --> 00:13:42,345
Let's go.

134
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:51,085
Breakfast's ready, guys.

135
00:13:52,105 --> 00:13:53,375
Wow.

136
00:13:55,965 --> 00:13:56,875
Looks delicious.

137
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,365
Baibua's amazing.

138
00:13:59,225 --> 00:14:02,285
Your boyfriend will love you to death for sure.

139
00:14:02,555 --> 00:14:03,095
Ahem!

140
00:14:04,555 --> 00:14:07,815
Hey, I can't just love anybody.

141
00:14:10,395 --> 00:14:12,735
Actually, I didn't cook these.

142
00:14:14,935 --> 00:14:17,415
Payoo did.

143
00:14:18,205 --> 00:14:19,245
Wow.

144
00:14:19,245 --> 00:14:20,105
Then...

145
00:14:21,035 --> 00:14:23,595
Your boyfriend will love you to death for sure.

146
00:14:24,135 --> 00:14:24,515
Ahem!

147
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:31,085
Wow!

148
00:14:31,515 --> 00:14:34,415
Simple dish with magnificent scenery.

149
00:14:35,695 --> 00:14:36,505
So beautiful.

150
00:14:45,775 --> 00:14:47,705
Where's Kim?

151
00:14:48,175 --> 00:14:48,975
He's not eating?

152
00:14:51,335 --> 00:14:52,455
He's the home-owner.

153
00:14:55,805 --> 00:14:56,505
And...

154
00:14:57,815 --> 00:14:59,145
He always isolates himself.

155
00:15:01,655 --> 00:15:04,585
I think he's at the pen in this early morning.

156
00:15:05,775 --> 00:15:06,895
Wow, Tony!

157
00:15:07,595 --> 00:15:08,685
That's so beautiful.

158
00:15:13,355 --> 00:15:14,475
We haven't posted any photos...

159
00:15:15,435 --> 00:15:16,215
I forgot.

160
00:15:16,745 --> 00:15:17,885
We don't have our phones.

161
00:15:19,145 --> 00:15:20,335
It's fine.

162
00:15:21,385 --> 00:15:22,445
We'll just...

163
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:24,955
keep this in our memory.

164
00:15:26,135 --> 00:15:27,785
Wow.

165
00:15:27,965 --> 00:15:29,275
Wise word.

166
00:15:29,815 --> 00:15:31,495
I love you to death.

167
00:15:35,175 --> 00:15:36,295
That's enough.

168
00:15:38,815 --> 00:15:40,075
You're so persistent.

169
00:15:40,635 --> 00:15:41,565
Like a disease.

170
00:15:41,935 --> 00:15:43,705
Damn you Oh!

171
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:45,625
I'm not a disease!

172
00:15:46,155 --> 00:15:47,645
Let's eat.

173
00:15:49,145 --> 00:15:50,455
That's not good.

174
00:15:50,455 --> 00:15:52,285
Don't tease me so much.

175
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,485
Just let me be.

176
00:16:04,135 --> 00:16:04,375
Trot.

177
00:16:06,985 --> 00:16:07,295
Good.

178
00:16:10,695 --> 00:16:10,925
Trot.

179
00:16:15,135 --> 00:16:15,385
Walk.

180
00:16:16,845 --> 00:16:17,095
Walk.

181
00:16:18,155 --> 00:16:18,955
Hold.

182
00:16:20,025 --> 00:16:20,795
Hi, Kim.

183
00:16:23,995 --> 00:16:25,435
What can you not do?

184
00:16:25,565 --> 00:16:28,875
You do everything so well: studying, music, and sports.

185
00:16:33,015 --> 00:16:33,695
Remembering, I guess.

186
00:16:40,635 --> 00:16:42,735
I've never touched a horse.

187
00:16:43,785 --> 00:16:45,975
Is its skin rough?

188
00:16:48,795 --> 00:16:49,405
Don't be afraid.

189
00:16:50,295 --> 00:16:50,855
Try touch it.

190
00:16:55,065 --> 00:16:55,915
What's its name?

191
00:16:58,415 --> 00:16:59,415
Snow White.

192
00:17:02,335 --> 00:17:03,255
Why's that name?

193
00:17:06,635 --> 00:17:08,935
Because it likes apples.

194
00:17:12,825 --> 00:17:13,655
Try touch it.

195
00:17:14,445 --> 00:17:15,895
If you want to be familiar with it,

196
00:17:16,315 --> 00:17:17,335
you have to touch it.

197
00:17:18,175 --> 00:17:20,605
Then, there'll be trust between you two.

198
00:17:23,145 --> 00:17:23,545
Try it.

199
00:17:55,535 --> 00:17:56,205
So soft.

200
00:17:57,965 --> 00:17:58,375
I feel...

201
00:17:59,915 --> 00:18:00,335
What?

202
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:03,735
Safe.

203
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:10,015
You can feel that much?

204
00:18:15,335 --> 00:18:16,605
It lets me touch it.

205
00:18:17,225 --> 00:18:18,335
Can I ride it now?

206
00:18:19,415 --> 00:18:19,885
Sure.

207
00:18:20,575 --> 00:18:20,955
Come.

208
00:18:29,095 --> 00:18:29,735
Hold.

209
00:18:30,505 --> 00:18:30,955
Come.

210
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,365
Easy.

211
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:48,935
Okay?

212
00:18:50,135 --> 00:18:50,475
Go.

213
00:19:44,045 --> 00:19:44,775
You keep staring at them.

214
00:19:46,775 --> 00:19:47,275
How do you feel?

215
00:19:48,475 --> 00:19:49,085
Hurt?

216
00:19:58,505 --> 00:19:59,035
And you?

217
00:20:00,205 --> 00:20:00,825
How do you feel?

218
00:20:06,635 --> 00:20:07,175
Honestly?

219
00:20:08,335 --> 00:20:08,665
Yeah.

220
00:20:10,845 --> 00:20:11,485
Nothing.

221
00:20:14,825 --> 00:20:15,195
Why?

222
00:20:19,855 --> 00:20:20,455
Because...

223
00:20:23,115 --> 00:20:24,825
He's the way he is.

224
00:20:30,745 --> 00:20:32,025
It's always been like that.

225
00:20:35,645 --> 00:20:36,045
Really?

226
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:46,455
How about you?

227
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:50,285
How do you feel?

228
00:21:24,315 --> 00:21:24,775
Uh...

229
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:26,815
I...

230
00:21:27,575 --> 00:21:28,395
I'll go back.

231
00:21:28,815 --> 00:21:29,065
Uh...

232
00:21:30,015 --> 00:21:31,575
I think I heard Oh call me.

233
00:21:32,495 --> 00:21:33,735
I didn't hear a thing.

234
00:21:34,825 --> 00:21:35,735
But I heard it.

235
00:21:36,445 --> 00:21:37,805
I'll go now.

236
00:21:56,775 --> 00:21:59,165
Someone's selling 2 million stocks.

237
00:22:00,015 --> 00:22:01,005
Buy them all.

238
00:22:01,895 --> 00:22:04,535
It's so much higher than the par value.

239
00:22:04,815 --> 00:22:06,695
I'm worried you'll buy the overpriced.

240
00:22:07,385 --> 00:22:08,905
I said buy them all.

241
00:22:10,345 --> 00:22:10,955
And...

242
00:22:11,255 --> 00:22:13,435
Your budget in the portfolio is empty.

243
00:22:14,605 --> 00:22:15,275
Hold on.

244
00:22:17,565 --> 00:22:18,585
Yes, president?

245
00:22:18,905 --> 00:22:20,215
Come inside.

246
00:22:27,215 --> 00:22:30,285
Is my OD transferred to my bank account?

247
00:22:30,665 --> 00:22:31,775
It's just transferred.

248
00:22:31,775 --> 00:22:33,085
Transfer it to my portfolio. STAT!

249
00:22:33,455 --> 00:22:34,505
Yes, president.

250
00:22:36,175 --> 00:22:37,865
It'll be ready in 5 minutes.

251
00:22:38,555 --> 00:22:39,385
Buy them all.

252
00:22:39,785 --> 00:22:41,095
Go all in.

253
00:22:41,865 --> 00:22:42,855
Be ready.

254
00:22:43,355 --> 00:22:43,835
Yes, ma'am.

255
00:22:51,755 --> 00:22:52,735
Calm down.

256
00:22:53,515 --> 00:22:54,055
Doctor.

257
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:06,105
We've spent almost 3 months on this case.

258
00:23:08,175 --> 00:23:11,215
The conclusion we have is worth our time.

259
00:23:13,035 --> 00:23:13,815
That's right.

260
00:23:15,115 --> 00:23:17,325
We have many fortunate events,

261
00:23:17,885 --> 00:23:20,205
especially about the bodies of the victims.

262
00:23:20,535 --> 00:23:23,305
They haven't been cremated yet.

263
00:23:24,535 --> 00:23:25,815
It's a well-laid plan.

264
00:23:26,575 --> 00:23:27,965
The criminal swapped pilot's body.

265
00:23:29,115 --> 00:23:31,015
If we didn't figure out the identity of the co-pilot,

266
00:23:31,965 --> 00:23:33,175
we couldn't solve this case.

267
00:23:35,325 --> 00:23:37,145
Business benefits

268
00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:41,065
can turn someone into an evil easily.

269
00:23:43,695 --> 00:23:45,005
I have to thank you

270
00:23:45,775 --> 00:23:48,455
for helping us solve this case.

271
00:23:49,675 --> 00:23:50,365
My pleasure.

272
00:23:51,885 --> 00:23:54,745
The evildoers must be punished for their crime.

273
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:59,755
Order our agents to follow the suspects immediately.

274
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:02,075
Then issue the arrest warrant

275
00:24:02,615 --> 00:24:04,765
before those criminals do anything further.

276
00:24:05,595 --> 00:24:06,175
Roger that.

277
00:24:28,015 --> 00:24:28,925
Do you think...

278
00:24:30,495 --> 00:24:32,535
Kim will remember you?

279
00:24:33,255 --> 00:24:34,135
And if...

280
00:24:35,195 --> 00:24:37,615
He can't remember you forever

281
00:24:37,815 --> 00:24:40,475
Will you... forget him?

282
00:25:00,285 --> 00:25:00,605
Hold.

283
00:25:02,285 --> 00:25:02,565
Hold.

284
00:25:05,965 --> 00:25:07,045
Thank you so much.

285
00:25:07,685 --> 00:25:08,765
It was amazing.

286
00:25:11,805 --> 00:25:12,965
Thank Snow White

287
00:25:13,485 --> 00:25:14,205
not me.

288
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:20,325
Thank you, Snow White.

289
00:25:39,285 --> 00:25:39,485
Come.

290
00:25:40,885 --> 00:25:41,325
I'll help.

291
00:26:11,365 --> 00:26:11,845
Are you okay?

292
00:26:13,365 --> 00:26:13,965
I'm fine.

293
00:26:14,925 --> 00:26:15,445
Then...

294
00:26:16,165 --> 00:26:17,765
I'll go take a bath.

295
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:19,605
Okay.

296
00:26:44,125 --> 00:26:45,245
Where have you been?

297
00:26:47,285 --> 00:26:48,405
I tried horse riding.

298
00:26:49,365 --> 00:26:49,765
Wow.

299
00:26:50,325 --> 00:26:53,445
Didn't know you can ride a horse.

300
00:26:58,725 --> 00:26:59,645
And...

301
00:27:00,565 --> 00:27:01,645
How's Kim?

302
00:27:06,325 --> 00:27:06,925
Same as ever.

303
00:27:07,885 --> 00:27:09,325
Always keep his cool.

304
00:27:14,885 --> 00:27:15,725
Do you think...

305
00:27:17,285 --> 00:27:19,525
Kim will remember about you and him?

306
00:27:23,485 --> 00:27:24,165
I don't know.

307
00:27:24,885 --> 00:27:25,885
It's hard to guess.

308
00:27:26,725 --> 00:27:28,285
We can only let it be.

309
00:27:32,285 --> 00:27:33,085
What if...

310
00:27:36,245 --> 00:27:38,925
Kim will never remember you,

311
00:27:41,565 --> 00:27:42,685
what would you do?

312
00:27:52,725 --> 00:27:53,685
I've never thought of that.

313
00:27:57,645 --> 00:27:58,525
Okay, then.

314
00:28:00,925 --> 00:28:02,965
If Kim can't remember you,

315
00:28:04,165 --> 00:28:06,725
will you forget about him?

316
00:28:12,885 --> 00:28:14,405
To forget someone

317
00:28:16,085 --> 00:28:16,965
is painful.

318
00:28:22,445 --> 00:28:23,165
Well,

319
00:28:23,925 --> 00:28:25,085
If I were Kim,

320
00:28:26,645 --> 00:28:29,045
I'll never forget you.

321
00:28:31,845 --> 00:28:32,885
Thank you.

322
00:28:36,325 --> 00:28:37,405
I must excuse myself.

323
00:28:50,245 --> 00:28:51,325
I can't wait any longer.

324
00:28:52,085 --> 00:28:52,965
Calm down, boss.

325
00:28:54,005 --> 00:28:56,485
I now know where Kimhan is.

326
00:28:57,245 --> 00:28:57,845
What?

327
00:28:58,845 --> 00:29:02,085
Someone used Kimhan's phone to contact someone in Bangkok.

328
00:29:03,085 --> 00:29:04,125
I ran a check.

329
00:29:05,205 --> 00:29:08,085
So I know he is now hiding in the safe house.

330
00:29:08,765 --> 00:29:10,285
Chateau Villa in Chaing Rai.

331
00:29:12,005 --> 00:29:13,445
He's more clever than I thought.

332
00:29:14,245 --> 00:29:15,925
It's right under my nose.

333
00:29:16,565 --> 00:29:19,125
That's why I can't find him.

334
00:29:20,205 --> 00:29:20,565
Great.

335
00:29:21,605 --> 00:29:23,045
You wait there.

336
00:29:23,325 --> 00:29:24,005
Sure, boss.

337
00:29:27,245 --> 00:29:28,005
Kimhan.

338
00:29:29,365 --> 00:29:30,685
Even if you have wings,

339
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:33,085
I'll clip all your wings.

340
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:35,005
Secretary.

341
00:29:35,525 --> 00:29:36,445
Yes, president?

342
00:29:36,805 --> 00:29:39,325
Cancel the board meeting tomorrow,

343
00:29:39,845 --> 00:29:41,925
and book a private jet for me, STAT.

344
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:43,525
I'll leave tomorrow morning.

345
00:29:44,085 --> 00:29:45,245
Where to?

346
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:47,805
Chiang Rai.

347
00:29:57,205 --> 00:29:58,045
Cook one for me.

348
00:30:02,965 --> 00:30:03,525
Here.

349
00:30:04,165 --> 00:30:05,085
For not handsome man.

350
00:30:08,085 --> 00:30:09,005
What if he's handsome?

351
00:30:10,885 --> 00:30:12,245
What more will you give?

352
00:30:18,485 --> 00:30:19,005
This one.

353
00:30:19,725 --> 00:30:20,365
A bonus.

354
00:30:22,285 --> 00:30:23,645
Aww, Baibua.

355
00:30:24,485 --> 00:30:25,485
Meanie.

356
00:30:27,925 --> 00:30:28,365
It's fine.

357
00:30:29,085 --> 00:30:30,325
For you,

358
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:31,925
I'll eat this.

359
00:30:32,885 --> 00:30:33,485
Wow.

360
00:30:33,885 --> 00:30:34,165
Hehe.

361
00:30:35,205 --> 00:30:36,125
I'll grill for you.

362
00:30:45,765 --> 00:30:46,245
Looks yummy.

363
00:30:59,205 --> 00:31:00,405
Looking for me?

364
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:03,525
No.

365
00:31:05,125 --> 00:31:06,045
Looking for Kim.

366
00:31:08,245 --> 00:31:08,605
Yeah.

367
00:31:09,445 --> 00:31:09,805
I'm hurt.

368
00:31:11,365 --> 00:31:12,165
Satisfied?

369
00:31:13,965 --> 00:31:14,525
No.

370
00:31:24,565 --> 00:31:27,205
We haven't gone on a trip like this for a while.

371
00:31:30,565 --> 00:31:31,045
And?

372
00:31:33,205 --> 00:31:34,805
I think it feels nice.

373
00:31:35,845 --> 00:31:37,045
How do you feel?

374
00:31:46,085 --> 00:31:47,645
You're all in your head.

375
00:31:49,725 --> 00:31:50,965
You're smiling!

376
00:31:52,725 --> 00:31:53,285
No!

377
00:31:54,885 --> 00:31:55,485
I didn't.

378
00:31:57,045 --> 00:31:58,805
I'll refill my cup.
Want anything?

379
00:31:59,965 --> 00:32:01,125
Can I have you?

380
00:32:01,845 --> 00:32:02,565
Piss off!

381
00:32:04,405 --> 00:32:04,845
Pervert!

382
00:32:05,685 --> 00:32:06,685
No!

383
00:32:06,885 --> 00:32:07,685
I mean...

384
00:32:08,005 --> 00:32:09,445
I want the same as you.

385
00:32:15,525 --> 00:32:16,365
Damn you.

386
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:41,765
What the hell?

387
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:42,765
I'm serious.

388
00:32:46,325 --> 00:32:48,005
There'll be rumor if someone sees this.

389
00:32:49,245 --> 00:32:50,365
Why do you care?

390
00:32:52,005 --> 00:32:53,125
Why can't you care about me,

391
00:32:53,925 --> 00:32:55,165
like you care about others?

392
00:32:57,885 --> 00:32:58,325
Enough.

393
00:32:59,005 --> 00:32:59,565
Or...

394
00:33:00,245 --> 00:33:00,805
What?

395
00:33:02,005 --> 00:33:03,005
Or Kim will see us?

396
00:33:05,285 --> 00:33:05,685
Yeah.

397
00:33:09,845 --> 00:33:10,845
You think I'm hurt?

398
00:33:13,605 --> 00:33:14,005
Yes.

399
00:33:29,765 --> 00:33:30,205
Well.

400
00:33:31,925 --> 00:33:32,605
I didn't feel a thing.

401
00:33:34,685 --> 00:33:36,165
But it was okay.

402
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:40,365
Say it again.

403
00:33:42,165 --> 00:33:42,965
Say it,

404
00:33:43,725 --> 00:33:44,805
and I'll kiss you again.

405
00:33:47,805 --> 00:33:48,325
You kiss

406
00:33:49,365 --> 00:33:50,245
doesn't mean a thing.

407
00:34:02,725 --> 00:34:03,165
So what?

408
00:34:11,885 --> 00:34:12,685
The best you can do?

409
00:34:14,565 --> 00:34:15,605
If you want me to notice you,

410
00:34:18,285 --> 00:34:19,525
you have to be brave.

411
00:34:20,805 --> 00:34:23,085
You can't do any better.

412
00:34:24,485 --> 00:34:25,445
That's why...

413
00:35:06,925 --> 00:35:07,685
You want me to be hurt.

414
00:35:08,965 --> 00:35:09,685
Now I am.

415
00:38:26,264 --> 00:38:26,624
Here.

416
00:38:30,944 --> 00:38:32,144
Thank you, Payoo.

417
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:38,904
Not having fun?

418
00:38:44,184 --> 00:38:44,704
Oh, no!

419
00:38:46,344 --> 00:38:48,144
I'm just lost in my thoughts.

420
00:38:53,384 --> 00:38:54,024
Payoo, wait.

421
00:38:57,144 --> 00:38:57,784
I'm sorry.

422
00:39:01,504 --> 00:39:02,264
For what?

423
00:39:04,984 --> 00:39:05,864
That night,

424
00:39:08,944 --> 00:39:09,704
at the sea,

425
00:39:10,784 --> 00:39:13,544
I knew that you saw me and Rain.

426
00:39:24,544 --> 00:39:25,664
It's your rights,

427
00:39:27,384 --> 00:39:28,424
your heart.

428
00:39:31,464 --> 00:39:33,944
I don't want to get in your way.

429
00:39:35,904 --> 00:39:36,704
You're amazing.

430
00:39:39,384 --> 00:39:40,544
I respect you.

431
00:39:41,904 --> 00:39:43,144
If you ask me

432
00:39:44,344 --> 00:39:45,784
am I still missing Rain?

433
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:50,784
I won't lie.

434
00:39:52,944 --> 00:39:53,704
Everyday.

435
00:39:57,624 --> 00:39:58,424
Especially,

436
00:40:00,144 --> 00:40:01,224
today.

437
00:40:12,184 --> 00:40:13,904
Do you think time will help?

438
00:40:20,104 --> 00:40:20,784
Time

439
00:40:22,184 --> 00:40:23,544
is just a clock ticking.

440
00:40:25,504 --> 00:40:26,904
It's nothing to do with your heart.

441
00:40:35,464 --> 00:40:36,464
Some day,

442
00:40:38,704 --> 00:40:40,304
you'll find the right one.

443
00:40:42,184 --> 00:40:44,304
The one who belongs to you.

444
00:40:47,784 --> 00:40:48,424
The one

445
00:40:50,184 --> 00:40:52,904
who makes you proud to tell others that

446
00:40:54,264 --> 00:40:56,824
he's the one.

447
00:41:01,304 --> 00:41:01,984
How about you?

448
00:41:04,384 --> 00:41:05,984
Are you proud to tell everyone

449
00:41:10,544 --> 00:41:11,584
that he's the one?

450
00:44:09,344 --> 00:44:10,504
It may sound rude.

451
00:44:11,344 --> 00:44:14,024
But I want everyone to leave as soon as possible.

452
00:44:14,944 --> 00:44:15,984
Better yet, tomorrow.

453
00:44:15,984 --> 00:44:17,904
This must be your gratitude

454
00:44:18,904 --> 00:44:20,024
from my wish.

455
00:46:31,184 --> 00:46:32,104
What did you do?

456
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:33,544
What have you done?

457
00:46:34,784 --> 00:46:35,864
I'm sorry, dad.

458
00:46:36,344 --> 00:46:37,344
I made a rash decision.

459
00:46:38,144 --> 00:46:41,104
Why didn't you discuss this important matter with me first?

460
00:46:45,944 --> 00:46:49,224
I know they are Master Kim's true friends.

461
00:46:50,344 --> 00:46:53,024
And I want Master Kim to recover.

462
00:46:53,624 --> 00:46:55,984
Because there's no other ways.

463
00:46:58,744 --> 00:47:00,624
You need to be more careful.

464
00:47:01,304 --> 00:47:02,504
Be more cautious.

465
00:47:03,264 --> 00:47:06,464
You can't act without consulting me first.

466
00:47:07,584 --> 00:47:09,864
Because this is for the safety of Master Kim.

467
00:47:11,064 --> 00:47:11,904
I'm sorry.

468
00:47:13,424 --> 00:47:14,464
Retrieve every phone.

469
00:47:15,064 --> 00:47:16,104
Remove their SIM card.

470
00:47:16,624 --> 00:47:17,984
All the while they're there.

471
00:47:18,424 --> 00:47:20,104
Don't contact anyone else.

472
00:47:20,584 --> 00:47:22,024
Because it's a safe house.

473
00:47:22,904 --> 00:47:23,224
Okay.

474
00:47:24,984 --> 00:47:27,104
I'm sorry, dad.
